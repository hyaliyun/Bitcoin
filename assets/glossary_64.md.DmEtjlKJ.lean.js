It serves the Northeast Line (Route 202). It opened on April 27, 1985 as part of the original Northeast line. The station is located in the median of Memorial Drive Northeast, 1.4 km from the City Hall Interlocking. A pedestrian overpass connects the station to both sides of Memorial Drive and stairs and escalators, as well as an elevator provide access down to the center-loading platform. The station serves St. Patrick's Island, which is only a short walk away, as is the Calgary Zoo, although it is also accessible via the Zoo station of the system. In 2004 and 2005 the station underwent upgrading and renovations to improve safety and access for visually impaired users wishing to access the nearby CNIB facility, and also in preparation for increased usage as work on The Bridges - a major inner city redevelopment project on the north side of the station - progresses. The station was closed for a couple of weeks in the Summer of 2004 due to the construction. As part of Calgary Transit's plan to operate 4-car trains by the end of 2014, all 3-car platforms are being extended. Construction on the extension of the platform at Bridgeland/Memorial started and was finished in 2014.http://www.calgarytransit.com/html/lrt_platform_construction.html In 2005, the station registered an average transit of 1,300 boardings per weekday.

Cartoons shorts and animated bridging sequences, starring Daffy Duck. It was the final theatrical production in which Mel Blanc provided the voices of the various Looney Tunes characters before his death on July 10, 1989. Unlike previous compilation films, Quackbusters uses pre-existing music from older Looney Tunes shorts composed by Carl Stalling, Milt Franklyn and William Lava for both the new animation and classic footage. It was also one of the two compilation films of classic Warner Bros. cartoon shorts not composed by Robert J. Walsh (the other being 1979's The Bugs Bunny/Road Runner Movie, which was composed by Dean Elliott). The film was released to theaters by Warner Bros. on September 24, 1988. Similar to The Looney Looney Looney Bugs Bunny Movie, which was preceded with the Oscar-winning Knighty Knight Bugs (1958), Quackbusters is preceded with the exclusive short The Night of the Living Duck (1988). This movie is inspired by Ghostbusters. Synopsis The story of the film serves as a continuation/re-working of Daffy Dilly. Street corner salesman Daffy tries to make a pitch to reclusive billionaire and \\"ailing buzzsaw baron\\" J.P. Cubish (a dog) - who has offered wealth to anyone who can make him laugh before he passes on - only to be stymied by Cubish's butler (also a dog). Eventually driving off the butler, Daffy becomes Cubish's jester, taking uncounted pies in the face while Cubish laughs uproariously. After Cubish's death soon afterward (\\"died laughing\\", reports one newspaper), Daffy inherits the Cubish fortune, which is locked in a safe, under the provision that he will use the money to provide a beneficial public service and follow Cubish's creed to display honesty in business affairs. The now-wealthy Daffy derides the idea (\\"What a rube!\\" he says of Cubish), but his deceased benefactor returns as an unseen ghost, with the intention of reclaiming his fortune from Daffy, unless Daffy agrees to provide a service to the community as the terms of Cubish's will stated. The irked Daffy vows to use the money to wipe out ghosts (√† la Ghostbusters) such as Cubish. Setting himself up as a \\"Paranormalist at Large\\", Daffy persuades Bugs Bunny to appear in commercials (despite the rabbit's insistence of going to Palm Springs for his vacation), then hires Porky Pig (accompanied by Sylvester) as an underling; Cubish continues to make money vanish from inside the safe whenever Daffy seems to do or say something dishonest. Sylvester has an exploit with Tweety, where Sylvester is relentlessly chased by a monstrous version of Tweety and develops paranoia in front of Daffy and Porky. Daffy assigns Porky to investigate the resort town of Dry Gulch for any suspicious ghost activity. Porky agrees to take the case and takes the now-paranoid Sylvester with him, who has to defend his owner from killer mice in the town's hotel. Although Daffy successfully exorcises the ghosts possessing a lady duck (with Daffy momentarily falling under possession from them himself), he discovers that Cubish has stripped his money down to his last million. He then receives a call from Porky, who is returning with Sylvester from their assignment to Dry Gulch, and Daffy reassigns him to the Superstition Mountains, much to Sylvester's chagrin. After receiving a call from Transylvania, Daffy then calls up Bugs and assigns him to investigate. Bugs encounters Count Blood Count, whom the rabbit defeats in a duel of magic words, but Daffy is displeased to hear from him about \\"getting two couples together\\". After receiving a call from the Himalayas, Daffy phones up Bugs again, who is leaving following his encounter with Count Blood Count, and together they go up against Hugo the Abominable Snowman, with Hugo repeatedly mistaking Daffy for a rabbit. When the city is swept with reports of a tiny elephant, Daffy, presuming this \\"teensy-elephant thing\\" to be mere hysteria, hopes to profit by soothing the public with his \\"expert\\" testimony. However, no sooner does he announce to the audience that there is no such thing as a tiny elephant then it turns up on Daffy's television interview, rendering him a public laughing stock. Daffy decides to blame the debacle on the absent Porky and absent- mindedly remarks that there was \\"nothing wrong with a little dishonesty in business affairs.\\" This proves to be Daffy's undoing, however, as upon realization of what he said, Daffy discovers that the safe is now completely empty except for a few cobwebs and a sign from Cubish: \\"YOU LOSE, DUCK!\\" Things get worse for a defeated Daffy when Egghead appears as a singing telegram, announcing to Daffy that due to unpaid rent, he is being dispossessed. After the repo crew takes away his desks, the building is condemned and destroyed, with Daffy still inside. Before impact, Daffy sadly tells the audience, \\"One thing's for sure, I've got nowhere else to go but up!\\" In the \\"epilog,\\" Bugs is shown enjoying his vacation in Palm Springs (after the encounter with Hugo) and reading about Daffy's downfall (\\"Quackbusted\\", reports the newspaper Bugs is reading), and Porky and Sylvester are stranded in the Superstition Mountains, with Sylvester as cowardly as ever. After a shot of Cubish's grave is shown where it states that Cubish is still dead, it is revealed that Daffy is back where he started, as a street corner salesman, this time selling paranormal-themed trinkets (including wind-up dolls of Gossamer). However, when Daffy earns a dollar bill, it instantly vanishes. The film ends with Daffy angrily shaking his fist at the sky and screaming \\"Cubish!\\" (implying that Cubish is still haunting Daffy) which cuts to a 'Finis' card.

As Kahn, Kasat portrayed an Asian savage despite being Caucasian. He worked as part of Paul Jones' Army in Jim Crockett Promotions and also worked for the American Wrestling Association (AWA). Professional wrestling career Kasat made his professional wrestling debut in 1986 portraying the Asian savage ring character Teijo Kahn (also spelled Teijho Kahn) despite being Caucasian. Kasat shaved his head bald and grew a thick Fu Manchu moustache to try to look more Asian. Having Caucasians portray Asian characters (or indeed having wrestlers from all manner of ethnic backgrounds portray ethnicities other than their own) were not unheard of in professional wrestling, examples such as Canadian Newton Tattrie working as Geeto Mongol or Florida native Chris Champion portraying Yoshi Kwan. As Teijo Kahn he worked as a heel, wrestling term for those that portray the bad guys, as part of manager Paul Jones's Paul Jones' Army. As part of the army he teamed up with The Barbarian, The Warlord, Abdullah the Butcher, Superstar Billy Graham, Shaska Whatley, Baron von Raschke, Manny Fernandez, Rick Rude, Ivan Koloff and Vladimir Petrov as part of their storyline feud with \\"The Boogie Woogie Man\\" Jimmy Valiant, Wahoo McDaniel and Hector Guerrero. Kahn and Whatley teamed up for the 1987 Jim Crockett, Sr. Memorial Cup Tag Team Tournament.

As an executive function, self-control is a cognitive process that is necessary for regulating one's behavior in order to achieve specific goals. A related concept in psychology is emotional self-regulation. Self-control is thought to be like a muscle. According to studies, self-regulation, whether emotional or behavioral, was proven to be a limited resource which functions like energy. In the short term, overuse of self-control will lead to depletion. However, in the long term, the use of self-control can strengthen and improve over time.Longitudinal Improvement of Self-Regulation Through Practice: Building Self-Control Strength Through Repeated Exercise. (Muraven, M., Baumeister, R. F., & Tice, D. M.) Self-control is also a key concept in the general theory of crime, a major theory in criminology. The theory was developed by Michael Gottfredson and Travis Hirschi in their book titled A General Theory of Crime, published in 1990. Gottfredson and Hirschi define self-control as the differential tendency of individuals to avoid criminal acts independent of the situations in which they find themselves. Individuals with low self-control tend to be impulsive, insensitive towards others, risk takers, short-sighted, and nonverbal. About 70% of the variance in questionnaire data operationalizing one construct of Self-Control had been found to be genetic. Research=Counteractive Desire is an affectively charged motivation toward a certain object, person, or activity, but not limited to, that associated with pleasure or relief from displeasure. Desires vary in strength and duration. A desire becomes a temptation when it impacts or enters the individual's area of self-control, if the behavior resulting from the desire conflicts with an individual's values or other self-regulatory goals. A limitation to research on desire is the issue of individuals desiring different things. New research looked at what people desire in real world settings. Over one week, 7,827 self-reports of desires were collected and indicated significant differences in desire frequency and strength, degree of conflict between desires and other goals, and the likelihood of resisting desire and success of the resistance. The most common and strongly experienced desires are those related to bodily needs like eating, drinking, and sleeping. Desires that conflict with overarching goals or values are known as temptations. Self-control dilemmas occur when long-term goals and values clash with short-term temptations. Counteractive Self-Control Theory states that when presented with such a dilemma, we lessen the significance of the instant rewards while momentarily increasing the importance of our overall values. When asked to rate the perceived appeal of different snacks before making a decision, people valued health bars over chocolate bars. However, when asked to do the rankings after having chosen a snack, there was no significant difference of appeal. Further, when college students completed a questionnaire prior to their course registration deadline, they ranked leisure activities as less important and enjoyable than when they filled out the survey after the deadline passed. The stronger and more available the temptation is, the harsher the devaluation will be.Fishbach, A., & Trope, Y (2008). Implicit and explicit counteractive self-control. In J.Y. Shah, W.L. Gardner (Eds.). Handbook of motivation science (pp. 281-294). New York, NY US: Guilford Press. One of the most common self-control dilemmas involves the desire for unhealthy or unneeded food consumption versus the desire to maintain long-term health. An indication of unneeded food could also be over expenditure on certain types of consumption such as eating away from home. Not knowing how much to spend, or overspending one's budget on eating out can be a symptom of a lack of self control. Experiment participants rated a new snack as significantly less healthy when it was described as very tasty compared to when they heard it was just slightly tasty. Without knowing anything else about a food, the mere suggestion of good taste triggers counteractive self-control and prompted them to devalue the temptation in the name of health. Further, when presented with the strong temptation of one large bowl of chips, participants both perceived the chips to be higher in calories and ate less of them than did participants who faced the weak temptation of three smaller chip bowls, even though both conditions represented the same amount of chips overall. Weak temptations are falsely perceived to be less unhealthy, so self-control is not triggered and desirable actions are more often engaged in, supporting the counteractive self-control theory. Weak temptations present more of a challenge to overcome than strong temptations, because they appear less likely to compromise long- term values. Satiation The decrease in an individual's liking of and desire for a substance following repeated consumption of that substance is known as satiation. Satiation rates when eating depend on interactions of trait self-control and healthiness of the food. After eating equal amounts of either clearly healthy (raisins and peanuts) or unhealthy (M&Ms; and Skittles) snack foods, people who scored higher on trait self-control tests reported feeling significantly less desire to eat more of the unhealthy foods than they did the healthy foods. Those with low trait self-control satiated at the same pace regardless of health value. Further, when reading a description emphasizing the sweet flavor of their snack, participants with higher trait self-control reported a decrease in desire faster than they did after hearing a description of the healthy benefits of their snack. Once again, those with low self-control satiated at the same rate regardless of health condition. Perceived unhealthiness of the food alone, regardless of actual health level, relates to faster satiation, but only for people with high trait self-control. Construal levels Thinking that is characterized by high construals, whenever individuals \\"are obliged to infer additional details of content, context, or meaning in the actions and outcomes that unfold around them\\",Ross, L. (1987). The Problem of Construal in Social Inference and Social Psychology. In N. Grunberg, R.E. Nisbett, J. Singer (eds), A Distinctive Approach to psychological research: the influence of Stanley Schacter. Hillsdale, NJ: Earlbaum. will view goals and values in a global, abstract sense. Whereas low level construals emphasize concrete, definitive ideas and categorizations. Different construal levels determine our activation of self-control in response to temptations. One technique for inducing high-level construals is asking an individual a series of \\"why?\\" questions that will lead to increasingly abstracted responses, whereas low-level construals are induced by \\"how?\\" questions leading to increasingly concrete answers. When taking an Implicit Association Test, people with induced high-level construals are significantly faster at associating temptations (such as candy bars) with \\"bad,\\" and healthy choices (such as apples) with \\"good\\" than those in the low- level condition. Further, higher-level construals also show a significantly increased likelihood of choosing an apple for snack over a candy bar. Without any conscious or active self-control efforts, temptations can be dampened by merely inducing high-level construals. It is suggested that the abstraction of high-level construals reminds people of their overall, lifelong values, such as a healthy lifestyle, which deemphasizes the current tempting situation. Human and non-human Positive correlation between linguistic capability and self-control has been inferred from experiments with common chimpanzees. Human self-control research is typically modeled by using a token economy system. A token economy system is a behavioral program in which individuals in a group can earn tokens for a variety of desirable behaviors and can cash in the tokens for various backup, positive reinforcers. The difference in research methodologies with humans - using tokens or conditioned reinforcers versus non-humans using sub-primary forces suggested procedural artifacts as a possible suspect. One aspect of these procedural differences was the delay to the exchange period. Non-human subjects can and most likely would access their reinforcement immediately. The human subjects had to wait for an \\"exchange period\\" in which they could exchange their tokens for money, usually at the end of the experiment. When this was done with the non-human subjects, in the form of pigeons, they responded much like humans in that males showed much less control than females. Logue, (1995), who is discussed more below, points out that in her study done on self-control it was male children who responded with less self-control than female children. She then states, that in adulthood, for the most part, the sexes equalize on their ability to exhibit self-control. This could imply a human's ability to exert more self-control as they mature and become aware of the consequences associated with impulsivity. This suggestion is further examined below. Most of the research in the field of self-control assumes that self-control is in general better than impulsiveness. As a result, almost all research done on this topic is from this standpoint and very rarely is impulsiveness the more adaptive response in experimental design. Self-control is a measurable variable in humans. In the worst circumstances people with the most or high self-control and resilience have the best odds of defying the odds they are faced with, which could be poverty, bad schooling, unsafe communities, etc. Those at a disadvantage with high self-control go on to higher education and professional jobs, but this seems to have a negative effect on their health. When looking at people who come from advantage backgrounds with high self-control, we see a different phenomenon happening. Those who come from an advantaged background tend to be high-achieving and with their achievement comes good health. The psychological phenomenon known as ‚ÄúJohn Henryism‚Äù posits that when goal-oriented, success- minded people strive ceaselessly in the absence of adequate support and resources, they can‚Äîlike the mighty 19th-century folk legend who fell dead of an aneurysm after besting a steam-powered drill in a railroad-spike-driving competition‚Äîwork themselves to death. Or, at least, toward it. In the 1980s Sherman James a socio-epidemiologist from North Carolina found that black Americans in the state suffered disproportionately from heart disease and strokes. He too landed on \\"John Henryism\\" as the cause of this phenomenon. More recently some in the field of developmental psychology have begun to think of self-control in a more complicated way that takes into account that sometimes impulsiveness is the more adaptive response. In their view, a normal individual should have the capacity to be either impulsive or controlled depending on which is the most adaptive. However, this is a recent shift in paradigm and there is little research conducted along these lines.Logue, A.W. (1995). Self-Control: Waiting Until Tomorrow For What You Want Today. Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice Hall  Skinner's survey of techniques  B.F. Skinner's Science and Human Behavior provides a survey of nine categories of self-control methods.Skinner, B.F. Science and Human Behavior, Chapter XV  Physical restraint and physical aid  The manipulation of the environment to make some responses easier to physically execute and others more difficult illustrate this principle. This can be referred to as physical guidance which is the application of physical contact to induce an individual to go through the motions of a desired behavior. This concept can also be referred to as a physical prompt. Examples of this include clapping one's hand over one's own mouth, placing one's hand in one's pocket to prevent fidgeting, and using a ‚Äòbridge‚Äô hand position to steady a pool shot all represent physical methods to affect behavior.Skinner, B.F. Science and Human Behavior, Chapter XV p. 231  Changing the stimulus  Manipulating the occasion for behavior may change behavior as well. Removing distractions that induce undesired actions or adding a prompt to induce it are examples. Hiding temptation and reminders are two more.Skinner, B.F. Science and Human Behavior, Chapter XV p. 233 The need to hide temptation is a result of its effect on the mind. A common theme among studies of desire is an investigation of the underlying cognitive processes of a craving for an addictive substance, such as nicotine or alcohol. In order to better understand the cognitive processes involved, the Elaborated Intrusion (EI) theory of craving was developed. According to the EI theory, craving persists because individuals develop mental images of the coveted substance that are instantly pleasurable, but which also increase their awareness of deficit. The result is a cruel circle of desire, imagery, and preparation to satisfy the desire. This quickly escalates into greater expression of the imagery that incorporates working memory, interferes with performance on simultaneous cognitive tasks, and strengthens the emotional response. Essentially the mind is consumed by the craving for a desired substance, and this craving in turn interrupts any concurrent cognitive tasks. Obviously a craving for nicotine or alcohol is an extreme case, but nevertheless the EI theory holds true for more normal motivations and desires.  Depriving and satiating  Deprivation is the time in which an individual does not receive a reinforcer, while satiation occurs when an individual has received a reinforcer to such a degree that it will temporarily have no reinforcing power over them. If we deprive ourselves of a stimulus, the value of that reinforcement increases. For example, if an individual has been deprived of food, they may go to extreme measures to get that food, such as stealing. On the other hand, when we have an exceeding amount of a reinforcer, that reinforcement loses its value; if an individual eats a large meal, they may no longer be enticed by the reinforcement of dessert. One may manipulate one's own behavior by affecting states of deprivation or satiation. By skipping a meal before a free dinner one may more effectively capitalize on the free meal. By eating a healthy snack beforehand the temptation to eat free \\"junk food\\" is reduced.Skinner, B.F. Science and Human Behavior, Chapter XV p. 235 Also noteworthy is the importance of imagery in desire cognition during a state of deprivation. A study conducted on this topic involved smokers divided into two groups. The control group was instructed to continue smoking as usual until they arrived at the laboratory, where they were then asked to read a multisensory neutral script, meaning it was not related to a craving for nicotine. The experimental group, however, was asked to abstain from smoking before coming to the laboratory in order to induce craving and upon their arrival were told to read a multisensory urge-induction script intended to intensify their nicotine craving. Once the participants finished reading the script they rated their craving for cigarettes. Next they formulated visual or auditory images when prompted with verbal cues such as \\"a game of tennis\\" or \\"a telephone ringing.\\" After this task the participants again rated their craving for cigarettes. The study found that the craving experienced by the abstaining smokers was decreased to the control group's level by visual imagery but not by auditory imagery alone. That mental imagery served to reduce the level of craving in smokers illustrates that it can be used as a method of self-control during times of deprivation.  Manipulating emotional conditions  We manipulate emotional conditions in order to induce certain ways of responding. One example of this can be seen in theatre. Actors often elicit tears from painful memories if it is necessary for the character they are playing. This idea is similar to the notion if we read a letter, book, listen to music, watch a movie, in order to get us in the \\"mood\\" so we can be in the proper state of mind for a certain event or function. Additionally, treating an activity as \\"work\\" or \\"fun\\" can have an effect on the difficulty of self-control. In order to analyze the possible effects of the cognitive transformation of an object on desire, a study was conducted based on a well- known German chocolate product. The study involved 71 undergraduate students, all of whom were familiar with the chocolate product. The participants were randomly assigned to one of three groups: the control condition, the consummatory condition, and the nonconsummatory transformation condition. Each group was then given three minutes to complete their assigned task. The participants in the control condition were told to read a neutral article about a location in South America that was devoid of any words associated with food consumption. Those in the consummatory condition were instructed to imagine as clearly as possible how consuming the chocolate would taste and feel. The participants in the nonconsummatory transformation condition were told to imagine as clearly as possible odd settings or uses for the chocolate. Next, all the participants underwent a manipulation task that required them to rate their mood on a five-point scale in response to ten items they viewed. Following the manipulation task, participants completed automatic evaluations that measured their reaction time to six different images of the chocolate, each of which was paired with a positive or a negative stimuli. The results showed that the participants instructed to imagine the consumption of the chocolate demonstrated higher automatic evaluations toward the chocolate than did the participants told to imagine odd settings or uses for the chocolate, and participants in the control condition fell in-between the two experimental conditions. This indicates that the manner in which one considers an item influences how much it is desired.  Using aversive stimulation  Aversive stimulation is used as a means of increasing or decreasing the likelihood of target behavior. Similar to all methods of self-management, there is a controlling response, and a controlled response. An averse stimuli is sometimes referred to as a punisher or simply an aversive. Closely related to the idea of a punisher is the concept of punishment. Punishment is the idea that in a given situation, someone does something that is immediately followed by a punisher, then that person is less likely to do the same thing again when she or he next encounters a similar situation. An example of this can be seen when a teenage stays out past curfew. After staying out past curfew the teenagers parents ground the teenager. Because the teenager has been punished for his or her behavior he or she is less likely to stay out past their curfew again, thus decreasing the likelihood of the target behavior.  Drugs  Certain types of drugs affect self-controls. Stimulants, such as methylphenidate and amphetamine, improve inhibitory control in general and are used to treat ADHD. Similarly, depressants, such as alcohol, represent barriers to self-control through sluggishness, slower brain function, poor concentration, depression and disorientation.  Operant conditioning  Operant conditioning sometimes referred to as Skinnerian conditioning is the process of strengthening a behavior by reinforcing it or weakening it by punishing it. By continually strengthening and reinforcing a behavior, or weakening and punishing a behavior an association as well as a consequence is made. Similarly, a behavior that is altered by its consequences is known as operant behavior There are multiple components of operant conditioning; these include reinforcement such as positive reinforcers and negative reinforcers. A positive reinforcer is a stimulus which, when presented immediately following a behavior, causes the behavior to increase in frequency. Negative reinforcers are a stimulus whose removal immediately after a response cause the response to be strengthened or to increase in frequency. Additionally, components of punishment are also incorporated such as positive punishment and negative punishment. Examples of operant conditioning can be seen every day. When a student tells a joke to one of his peers and they all laugh at this joke, this student is more likely to continue this behavior of telling jokes because his joke was reinforced by the sound of their laughing. However, if a peer tells the student his joke is \\"silly\\" or \\"stupid\\", he will be punished by telling the joke and his likelihood to tell another joke is greatly decreased.  Punishment  Self-punishment of responses would include the arranging of punishment contingent upon undesired responses. This might be seen in the behavior of whipping oneself which some monks and religious persons do. This is different from aversive stimulation in that, for example, the alarm clock generates escape from the alarm, while self-punishment presents stimulation after the fact to reduce the probability of future behavior.Skinner, B.F. Science and Human Behavior, Chapter XV p. 237 Punishment is more like conformity than self-control because with self-control there needs to be an internal drive, not an external source of punishment that makes the person want to do something. There is external locus of control which is similar to determinism and there is internal locus of control which is similar to free will. With a learning system of punishment the person does not make their decision based upon what they want, rather they base it on the external factors. When you use a negative reinforcement you are more likely to influence their internal decisions and allow them to make the choice on their own whereas with a punishment the person will make their decisions based upon the consequences and not exert self-control. The best way to learn self- control is with free will where people are able to perceive they are making their own choices.Logue, Self Control: Waiting Until Tomorrow For What You Want Today 34-77  \\"Doing something else\\"  Skinner noted that various philosophies and religions exemplified this principle by instructing believers to love their enemies.Skinner, B.F. Walden Two 1948 When we are filled with rage or hatred we might control ourselves by 'doing something else' or more specifically something that is incompatible with our response. Brain regions involved Functional imaging of the brain has shown that self-control is correlated with an area in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC), a part of the frontal lobe. This area is distinct from those involved in generating intentional actions, attention to intentions, or select between alternatives. This control occurs through the top-down inhibition of premotor cortex. There is some debate about the mechanism of self-control and how it emerges. Traditionally, researchers believed the bottom-up approach guided self-control behavior. The more time a person spends thinking about a rewarding stimulus, the more likely he or she will experience a desire for it. Information that is most important gains control of working memory, and can then be processed through a top-down mechanism. Increasing evidence suggests that top down processing plays a strong role in self-control. Specifically, top-down processing can actually regulate bottom-up attentional mechanisms. To demonstrate this, researchers studied working memory and distraction by presenting participants with neutral or negative pictures and then a math problem or no task. They found that participants reported less negative moods after solving the math problem compared to the no task group, which was due to an influence on working memory capacity. There are many researchers working on identifying the brain areas involved in the exertion of self-control; many different areas are known to be involved. In relation to self-control mechanisms, the reward centers in the brain compare external stimuli versus internal need states and a person's learning history. At the biological level, a loss of control is thought to be caused by a malfunctioning of a decision mechanism. A mechanistic explanation of self-control is still in its infancy. However, there is strong demand for knowledge about these mechanism because knowledge of these mechanisms would have tremendous clinical application. Much of the work on how the brain reaches decisions is based on evidence from perceptual learning. Many of the tasks that subjects are tested on are not tasks typically associated with self-control, but are more general decision tasks. Nevertheless, the research on self-control is informed by more general research on decision tasks. Sources for evidence on the neural mechanisms of self-control include fMRI studies on human subject, neural recordings on animals, lesion studies on humans and animals, and clinical behavioral studies on humans with self-control disorders. There is broad agreement that the cortex is involved in self-control. The details of the final model have yet to be worked out. However, there are some enticing findings that suggest a mechanistic account of self-control could prove to have tremendous explanatory value. What follows is a survey of some of the important recent literature on the brain regions involved in self-control. Prefrontal cortex The prefrontal cortex is located in the most anterior portion of the frontal lobe in the brain. It forms a larger portion of the cortex in humans. The dendrites in the prefrontal cortex contain up to 16 times as many dendritic spines as neurons in other cortical areas. Due to this, the prefrontal cortex integrates a large amount of information. The orbitofrontal cortex cells are important factors for self-control. If an individual has the choice between an immediate reward or a more valuable reward which they can receive later, an individual would most likely try to control the impulse to take that immediate reward. If an individual has a damaged orbitofrontal cortex, this impulse control will most likely not be as strong, and they may be more likely to take the immediate reinforcement. Additionally, we see lack of impulse control in children because the prefrontal cortex develops slowly. Todd A. Hare et al. use functional MRI techniques to show that the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) and the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) are crucially involved in the exertion of self-control. They found that activity in the vmPFC was correlated with goal values and that the exertion of self-control required the modulation of the vmPFC by the DLPFC. The study found that a lack of self- control was strongly correlated with reduced activity in the DLPFC. Hare's study is especially relevant to the self-control literature because it suggests that an important cause of poor self-control is a defective DLPFC. Outcomes as determining whether a choice is made Alexandra W. Logue is interested in how outcomes change the possibilities of a self-control choice being made. Logue identifies three possible outcome effects: outcome delays, outcome size, and outcome contingencies. The delay of an outcome results in the perception that the outcome is less valuable than an outcome which is more readily achieved. The devaluing of the delayed outcome can cause less self- control. A way to increase self-control in situations of a delayed outcome is to pre-expose an outcome. Pre-exposure reduces the frustrations related to the delay of the outcome. An example of this is signing bonuses. Outcome size deals with the relative, perceived size of possible outcomes. There tends to be a relationship between the value of the incentive and the desired outcome; the larger the desired outcome, the larger the value. Some factors that decrease value include delay, effort/cost, and uncertainty. The decision tends to be based on the option with the higher value at the time of the decision. Finally, Logue defines the relationship between responses and outcomes as outcome contingencies. Outcome contingencies also impact the degree of self- control that a person exercises. For instance, if a person is able to change his choice after the initial choice is made, the person is far more likely to take the impulsive, rather than self-controlled, choice. Additionally, it is possible for people to make precommitment action. A precommitment action is an action meant to lead to a self-controlled action at a later period in time. When a person sets an alarm clock, they are making a precommitted response to wake up early in the morning. Hence, that person is more likely to exercise the self-controlled decision to wake up, rather than to fall back in bed for a little more sleep. Cassandra B. Whyte studied locus of control and academic performance and determined that internals tend to achieve at a higher level. Internals may perceive they have options from which to choose, thus facilitating more hopeful decision-making behavior as opposed to dependence on externally determined outcomes that require less commitment, effort, or self- control.Whyte, Cassandra B., (1975) A Specific Study of the Effects of Three Modes of Counseling on the Academic Achievement and Internal External Locus of Control of High-Risk College Freshmen. Dissertation Abstracts,.48106. 36 (4). Physiology of behavior Many things affect one's ability to exert self- control, but it seems that self-control requires sufficient glucose levels in the brain. Exerting self-control depletes glucose. Reduced glucose, and poor glucose tolerance (reduced ability to transport glucose to the brain) are correlated with lower performance in tests of self-control, particularly in difficult new situations. Self-control demands that an individual work to overcome thoughts, emotions, and automatic responses/impulses. These strong efforts require higher blood glucose levels. Lower blood glucose levels can lead to unsuccessful self-control abilities. Alcohol causes a decrease of glucose levels in both the brain and the body, and it also has an impairing effect on many forms of self-control. Furthermore, failure of self-control occurs most likely during times of the day when glucose is used least effectively. Self-control thus appears highly susceptible to glucose. An alternative explanation of the limited amounts of glucose that are found is that this depends on the allocation of glucose, not on limited supply of glucose. According to this theory, the brain has sufficient resources of glucose and also has the possibility of delivering the glucose, but the personal priorities and motivations of the individual cause the glucose to be allocated to other sites. This theory has not been tested yet.  The Mischel Experiments  In the 1960s, Walter Mischel tested four-year-old children for self-control in \\"The Marshmallow Test\\": the children were each given a marshmallow and told that they can eat it anytime they want, but if they waited 15 minutes, they would receive another marshmallow. Follow up studies showed that the results correlated well with these children's success levels in later life.Mischel, W., Shoda, Yth the members of the original study whom he was able to find. His reported results appear to show that the life- expectancy of the group was more strongly correlated with their assessed self- control level than anything elseReported in the book \\"The Attitude Factor\\" by Thomas Blakeslee A strategy used in the marshmallow test was the focus on \\"hot\\" and \\"cool\\" features of an object. The children were encouraged to think about the marshmallow's \\"cool features\\" such as its shape and texture, possibly comparing it to a cotton ball or a cloud. The \\"hot features\\" of the marshmallow would be its sweet, sticky tastiness. These hot features make it more difficult to delay gratification. By focusing on the cool features, the mind is adverted from the appealing aspects of the marshmallow, and self- control is more plausible. Years later Dr. Mischel reached out to the participants of his study who were then in their 40s. He found that those who showed less self-control by taking the single marshmallow in the initial study were more likely to develop problems with relationships, stress, and drug abuse later in life. Dr. Mischel carried out the experiment again with the same participants in order to see which parts of the brain were active during the process of self-control. The participants received scans through M.R.I to show brain activity. The results showed that those who exhibited lower levels of self-control had higher brain activity in the ventral striatum, the area that deals with positive rewards. Reviews concluded that self-control is correlated with various positive life outcomes, such as happiness, adjustment and various positive psychological factors. Self-control was also negatively correlated with sociotropy which in turn is correlated with depression.Needleman, L. D. (1999). Cognitive Case Conceptualization : A Guidebook for Practitioners. Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, Inc. Retrieved December 11, 2011  Ego depletion  There's conflicting evidence about whether will power is finite, infinite or self-reinforcing resource, a phenomenon sometimes termed ego depletion or reverse ego depletion. However, belief that will-power is infinite or self-reinforcing is associated with greater will power, voluntary executive function. Exerting self-control through the executive functions in decision making is held in some theories to deplete one's ability to do so in the future. Ego depletion is the view that high self-control requires energy and focus, and over an extended period of self-control demands, this self-control can lessen. There are ways to help this ego depletion. One way is through rest and relaxation from these high demands. Additionally, training self-control with certain behaviors can also help to strengthen an individual's self-control. This seems to be particularly effective in those who would otherwise have difficulty controlling their impulses in the domain of interest. Another way to overcome unwanted desires is to change the method with which we approach desire. One study in particular analyzed the impact of approaching a temptation by defining it in abstract, general terms as opposed to specific, concrete details. For the purposes of the study, approaching a situation using general terms was defined as the high-level construal condition whereas using specific details was termed the low-level construal condition. The study involved 42 college students who were randomly assigned to either the high-level or low-level construal condition. The participants were then presented with a packet that described five scenarios, each one involving a unique self-control conflict. For those participants in the high-level construal condition the scenarios were described using only general terms and for those in the low-level construal condition the scenarios were described using only specific details. After imagining themselves in each scenario, the participants were asked to indicate how bad they would feel if they indulged in the temptation using a six-point scale ranging from \\"not at all bad\\" to \\"very bad.\\" The data showed that participants in the high-level construal condition reported greater negative evaluations of temptations than did participants in the low-level construal conditions. This implies that individuals using high-level construals are better able to place a temptation in context and properly evaluate its long- term impact, and therefore are more likely to maintain self-control.

It is at 600 de Maisonneuve Ouest and has an official height of . The building is owned and operated by BentallGreenOak. The KPMG Tower was built on a plot of land owned by the Christ Church Cathedral, which lies directly in front of the building when viewed from Saint Catherine Street. It was designed by WZMH Architects and was styled to relate to the cathedral. The tower incorporates an underground shopping centre, Promenades Cath√©drale, as part of the underground city that is connected to the Metro.  Overview  The building was originally called Maison des Coop√©rants for the then-anchor tenant, as can be seen on the inscription in the lobby; however, it was later named Place de la Cath√©drale. At the end of 2005 the tower was renamed to its current name for KPMG, the new anchor tenant that occupies floors 6 to 15 and part of the 17th. Part of its local claim to fame was that the Promenades Cath√©drale shopping mall underneath the tower, built at the same time, was built beneath the existing Christ Church Cathedral. It was a sight to behold, as the Cathedral was perched on top of cement piles with the soil removed from under it, resulting in a cathedral that seemed to be floating in mid air. From time to time, the building administration runs an exhibit in the shopping mall displaying the construction of the complex. A consequence of this arrangement is that the cathedral no longer has its proverbial basement. The functions traditionally done in the church basement are now performed in a space reserved for the church on the third floor of the tower's east side. At the time of its opening, the shopping mall had three floors with a food court occupying most of the lower floor. Later renovations converted that shopping floor into a second floor of parking garage. A memorial to Raoul Wallenberg stands in a small park between the office tower and church, where a bust of Wallenberg and a caged metal box (styled as a barbed-wire gate) stand beside each other. The building features prominently during the Temptation of Christ scene in the 1989 Denys Arcand film Jesus of Montreal, reflecting the tower's status as the most prominent and modern skyscraper built in Montreal during the late 1980s as well as its unique relationship with the church. Tenants The building contains the headquarters of Gildan Activewear and holds offices for the professional services firm KPMG, law firm Blake, Cassels & Graydon, Empire Life, and the offices of the Anglican Diocese of Montreal.

Yakshinis (‡§Ø‡§æ‡§ï‡•ç‡§∑‡§ø‡§£‡•Ä or yak·π£ƒ´; or yakkhƒ´) a class of nature spirits in Hindu, Buddhist, and Jain religious mythologies that are different from devas (gods), asuras (demons), and gandharvas or apsaras (celestial beings). Yakshinis and their male counterparts, the yakshas, are one of the many paranormal beings associated with the centuries-old sacred groves of India. The well behaved and benign ones are worshipped as tutelaries,https://www.britannica.com/topic/yaksha they are the attendees of Kubera, the treasurer of the gods, and also the Hindu god of wealth who ruled Himalayan kingdom of Alaka. There are also malign and mischievous yakshinis with poltergeist-like behaviours, that can haunt and curse humans according to Indian folklore. The ashoka tree is closely associated with yakshinis. The young girl at the foot of the tree is an ancient motif indicating fertility on the Indian Subcontinent. One of the recurring elements in Indian art, often found as gatekeepers in ancient Buddhist and Hindu temples, is a yakshini with her foot on the trunk and her hands holding the branch of a stylized flowering ashoka or, less frequently, other tree with flowers or fruits. Yakshinis in Buddhism Shunga, 2nd-1st century BC, India The three sites of Bharhut, Sanchi, and Mathura, have yielded huge numbers of Yakshi figures, most commonly on the railing pillars of stupas. These show a clear development and progression that establishes certain characteristics of the Yakshi figure such as her nudity, smiling face and evident (often exaggerated) feminine charms that lead to their association with fertility. The yakshi is usually shown with her hand touching a tree branch, in a sinuous tribhanga pose, thus some authors hold that the young girl at the foot of the tree is based on an ancient tree deity. Yakshis were important in early Buddhist monuments as a decorative element and are found in many ancient Buddhist archaeological sites. They became Salabhanjikas (sal tree maidens) with the passing of the centuries, a standard decorative element of both Indian sculpture and Indian temple architecture.Buddhistische Bilderwelt: Hans Wolfgang Schumann, Ein ikonographisches Handbuch des Mahayana- und Tantrayana-Buddhismus. Eugen Diederichs Verlag. Cologne. , The sal tree (Shorea robusta) is often confused with the ashoka tree (Saraca indica) in the ancient literature of the Indian Subcontinent.Eckard Schleberger, Die indische G√∂tterwelt. Gestalt, Ausdruck und Sinnbild Eugen Diederich Verlag. Cologne. , The position of the Salabhanjika is also related to the position of Queen MƒÅyƒÅ of Sakya when she gave birth to Gautama Buddha under an asoka tree in a garden in Lumbini, while grasping its branch.

A similar list of Yakshas and yakshinis are given in the Tantraraja Tantra, where it says that these beings are givers of whatever is desired. They are the guardians of the treasure hidden in the earth. 36 Yakshinis The list of thirty six yakshinis given in the Uddamareshvara Tantra is as follows: A Yakshin, 10th century, Mathura, India.

Each is regarded as the guardian goddess of one of the present tirthankar Shri Simandhar Swami and twenty-four Jain tirthankara. The names according to Tiloyapannatti (or Pratishthasarasangraha) and Abhidhanachintamani are: * * Panchanguli *Chakreshvari * Rohini, Ajitbala * Prajnapti, Duritari * Vajrashrankhala, Kali * Vajrankusha, Mahakali * Manovega, Shyama * Kali, Shanta * Jwalamalini, Mahajwala * Mahakali, Sutaraka * Manavi, Ashoka * Gauri, Manavi * Gandhari, Chanda * Vairoti, Vidita * Anantamati, Ankusha * Manasi, Kandarpa * Mahamansi, Nirvani * Jaya, Bala * Taradevi, Dharini * Vijaya, Dharanpriya * Aparajita, Nardatta * Bahurupini, Gandhari * Ambika or Kushmandini * Padmavati * Siddhayika Yakshis in modern literature The Besnagar Yakshi, 3rd-1st century BC. In the horror fictions of Malayalam literature, Yakshis are mostly not considered benevolent. They are being portrayed by people alluring men and finally killing them. The following are the prominent fiction characters. Kalliyankattu Neeli One of the most famous Kerala Christian legendary stories of Yakshis is that of Kalliyankattu Neeli, a powerful demoness who was fabled to have finally been stopped by the legendary Christian priest Kadamattathu Kathanar. The Yakshi theme is the subject of popular Keralite tales, like the legend of the Yakshi of Trivandrum, as well as of certain movies in modern Malayalam cinema. Mangalathu Sreedevi Another lesser known Yakshi is Mangalathu Sreedevi also known as Kanjirottu Yakshi. She was born into a Padamangalam Nair tharavad by name Mangalathu at Kanjiracode in South Travancore. She was a ravishingly beautiful courtesan who had an intimate relationship with Raman Thampi, son of King Rama Varma and rival of Anizhom Thirunal Marthanda Varma.Kaimal, Kesava. 'Thekkan Thiruvithamkurile Yakshikal'. Srinidhi Publications, 2002. Reserve Bank of India headquarters, Delhi entrance with a yakshini sculpture(c. 1960) depicting \\"Prosperity through agriculture\\". Mangalathu Sreedevi was infatuated with one of her servants, Raman. Raman, a Pondan Nair (palanquin-bearer), was a fair, tall, well-built and handsome young man. She and her brother Govindan used to ride on Raman's back to nearby places. A predatory sadist, Sreedevi enjoyed torturing Raman physically and mentally. She did everything possible to separate him from his wife. In course of time, the unmarried Govindan and Raman became bosom friends. They often shared the same room. Sreedevi was not quite comfortable with the growing fondness of her brother for her lover. But she did not act. Sreedevi hatched a plot and raped Raman's wife. Once Govindan was travelling on Raman's back when the former revealed the details of the plot. Days later, Raman strangled Sreedevi to death when they were sharing a bed. Govindan winked at the crime and protected his beloved friend. Statue of Yakshi by Kanayi Kunjiraman at Malampuzha Dam Sreedevi was reborn as a vengeful Yakshi to a couple at Kanjiracode. She grew into a bewitching beauty within moments of her birth. Though she seduced many men and drank their blood, her heart was set on the handsome Raman. She told him that she was willing to pardon him if he married her. Raman flatly refused. The Yakshi channeled all her energies in tormenting him. Devastated, Raman sought the assistance of Mangalathu Govindan, who was a great upasaka of Lord Balarama. Govindan was for a compromise. He said that the Yakshi could have Raman for a year provided she conformed to three conditions. One, she must agree to be installed at a temple after one year. Two, after many years the temple will be destroyed and she must then seek refuge in (saranagati) Lord Narasimha for attaining moksham. Three, she must pray for Govindan and his relationship with Raman not only in their current birth but also in their subsequent births. The Yakshi swore upon 'ponnum vilakkum' that she would abide by all the three conditions. Thus the compromise formula worked.Nair, Balasankaran. 'Kanjirottu Yakshi'. Sastha Books, 2001. A year later, the Yakshi was installed at a Temple which later came to be owned by Kanjiracottu Valiaveedu. The Temple does not exit anymore.

Alas, it was not a masterpiece\\". The Globe and Mail, February 27, 2009. He was most noted for his novels Place d'Armes and Civic Square, among the first works of LGBT literature ever published in Canada,W. H. New, Encyclopedia of Literature in Canada. University of Toronto Press, 2002. . as well as a personal life that was often plagued by scandal and interpersonal conflict. He was openly gay at a time when this was very difficult, publishing his first novel, Place d'Armes, which dealt directly with homosexuality, two years before gay sex was decriminalized in Canada. He was an avid diarist, and many of his observations and episodes from his life found their way into his novels. His writing style was marked by experimental forms and structures, with one of his novels being published as handwritten pages packaged in a box, and by a blurring of the lines between fiction and non-fiction. Early life He was born in Toronto, Ontario, the son of businessman and writer Harry L. Symons and the brother of academic Thomas Symons. A rebellious teenager, his parents sent him to Trinity College School in Port Hope, where he took up gymnastics and established a lifelong friendship with journalist Charles Taylor. He also first came to realize that he was gay, falling in love with a fellow student but repressing his feelings in sport. Symons would later describe the experience as emotionally crippling, leaving him an \\"eternal thirteen; eternally the boy reaching out to touch but never being allowed to do so‚Ä¶ except as Mommy and Authority permitted.\\"Ian Young, \\"A Whiff of the Monster: Encounters with Scott Symons\\". Encounters with Authors. Toronto: Sykes Press, 2013. . One night while practicing in the gymnasium, he fell off the high bar and broke his back, and was immobilized in a body cast for several months. After completing high school, he enrolled at the University of Toronto, where he earned a bachelor's degree in modern history as well as enlisting as a naval cadet and serving on the student government. He subsequently pursued graduate studies at Cambridge University. Still attempting to repress his sexuality, Symons married Judith Morrow, the granddaughter of a president of the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, in 1958.Christopher Elson, \\"Introduction: Siting La Place\\" in Scott Symons, Combat Journal for Place d'Armes. Dundurn Press, 2010. . Taylor was his best man. Early career He briefly took a job on the editorial page of the Toronto Telegram, but was soon fired for not being deferential to his bosses; he then took a job with the Quebec Chronicle-Telegraph, and integrated so quickly into the intellectual elites of Quebec that he was invited to join the St-Jean-Baptiste Society even though he was neither francophone nor Roman Catholic. Symons and his wife spent some time studying at the Sorbonne in 1959; during this time, he met writer Julien Green, whom Symons would later describe as having reawoken his dormant sexuality. Symons and his wife returned to Canada the following year with their newborn son Graham after Symons accepted a job with La Presse in Montreal. While there, he won a National Newspaper Award for a series of articles about the early stirrings of what would become Quebec's Quiet Revolution. With the nomadic restlessness that would characterize much of his life, however, he soon quit journalism and returned to Toronto, taking a job as a curator at the Royal Ontario Museum; within a few years, he was also an assistant professor of fine art at the University of Toronto, and briefly held a visiting curatorship at the Smithsonian Institution and a research associate's position at the Winterthur Museum. He was later offered a permanent position at the Smithsonian, but declined. During this period he began to write but never finished a book on Canadian history and a stage play, and botched an audition to host This Hour Has Seven Days. Writing In 1965 he fled the family farm in Claremont and holed up in a small hotel in Montreal for 21 days, during which he wrote Place d'Armes. Place d'Armes contained both autobiographical and metafictional elements; its protagonist Hugh Anderson was, like Symons, a wealthy but socially alienated man from Toronto abandoning his comfortable bourgeois life to hole up in a hotel in Montreal, rediscovering himself in sex with male prostitutes in Place d'Armes, and in turn writing his own novel within a novel about Andrew, a character who himself fit the same profile as both Symons and Anderson. The writing was liberally peppered with sexualized puns such as \\"fingertits\\", \\"cocktit\\" and \\"assoul\\". The novel did not garner favourable reviews upon its publication in 1967; writing in the Toronto Star, Robert Fulford deemed Anderson as \\"the most repellent single figure in the recent history of Canadian writing\\", and criticized Symons, whom he called \\"the monster from Toronto\\", for being incapable of writing about love. Despite the criticism, however, Place d'Armes won the Beta Sigma Phi First Canadian Novel Award.Martin Levin, \\"Scott Symons, novelist, dies at 75\\". The Globe and Mail, February 23, 2009. Its critical reception has improved over time; in 2005, the Literary Review of Canada named Place d'Armes as one of the 100 most important books in Canadian literary history.\\"The LRC 100 (Part One)\\". Literary Review of Canada, January/February 2006. He followed up in 1969 with Civic Square, a novel whose working title The Smugly Fucklings was nixed by publisher Jack McClelland.\\"Uncivil Elegies: The Mystery of Civic Square\\". Reading Toronto, March 14, 2006. The novel was noted for its unconventional form ‚Äî a series of polemical letters addressed to \\"Dear Reader\\" ‚Äî and presentation; 848 pages in length, it was neither typeset nor bound, but rather the original handwritten manuscript was duplicated by Gestetner, hand-decorated by Symons and then packaged in a blue box which was wrapped in white ribbon and emblazoned with a wax seal, with the title stamped on the box in silver ink. (Due to its unique format, the novel was published only as a limited edition, and was not widely available until Dundurn Press reissued it as a conventional paperback in 2007.) Once the project had been completed, Symons took a copy of the novel and placed it in the collection plate at his parents' church, Toronto's St. James Cathedral. Around this time, Symons left his wife and entered his first long-term relationship with another man, a 17-year-old student named John McConnell. This relationship led to an incident which came to define public awareness of Symons; while media reports claimed that Symons had \\"run off to Mexico with an underage boy\\", in reality Symons had travelled to Mexico to attend an artists' retreat in San Miguel de Allende with York Wilson and Leonard Brooks rather than with McConnell, who had been sent by his parents to Nassau; McConnell separately travelled to Mexico, of his own accord, when he learned of Symons' whereabouts. Regardless, McConnell's parents posted a reward for Symons' arrest, putting police forces in Canada, the United States and Mexico on his trail, although the reward and arrest warrant were rescinded after McConnell contacted his family and threatened to commit suicide if Symons were jailed. Symons and McConnell then spent some time living in northern British Columbia, although they returned to Toronto by 1970. The pair continued to move frequently, residing at different times in Toronto, San Miguel de Allende and Trout River, Newfoundland and Labrador.\\"The spy staying out in the cold to fight Blandman and Methodism-on-the-make\\". The Globe and Mail, April 28, 1973. Despite this, Symons was hurt by the process of divorcing Judith, often insisting that he still loved her and wanted to stay married to her even if his actual conduct suggested otherwise. By this point, Symons was also virtually estranged from his own birth family, some of whom never saw him again until he was near death. In 1971, Symons published the non-fiction book Heritage: A Romantic Look at Early Canadian Furniture. Although packaged and formatted as a coffee table book, Symons conceptualized it as a \\"furniture novel\\", deliberately blurring the lines between fiction and non-fiction by incorporating a narrative aspect which verged on erotic in some of its descriptions of the furniture.\\"O walnut flesh\\". The Globe and Mail, December 2, 1971. He and McConnell broke up soon afterward. Exile in Morocco By 1973, Symons had left Canada to live in Essaouira, Morocco, which would remain his primary residence for much of the remainder of his life. He was the subject of a chapter in Graeme Gibson's non-fiction work Eleven Canadian Novelists, published that same year. In 1977, he published \\"The Canadian Bestiary: Ongoing Literary Depravity\\", a scathing review of Marian Engel's novel Bear, in West Coast Review (Vol. 11, No. 3). The review digressed to criticize many of the era's Canadian literary figures, including Irving Layton, Robertson Davies, Mordecai Richler, Victor Coleman, Jacques Godbout and Coach House Press, effectively burning many of Symons' bridges. Around the same time, Taylor published Six Journeys: a Canadian Pattern, which included a biographical essay about Symons.Sandra Martin, Working the Dead Beat: 50 Lives That Changed Canada. House of Anansi, 2012. . In 1979, he published a series of essays in The Globe and Mail under the title \\"Canada: A Loving Look\\".David Warren, \\"Tribute to a contrarian\\" . Ottawa Citizen, February 25, 2009. He was also a regular contributor to The Body Politic. His third and final novel, Helmet of Flesh, was published in 1986. Semi- autobiographical like his earlier works, Helmet of Flesh centred on York Mackenzie, a Canadian man fleeing to Morocco after the breakup of his relationship with a younger man.\\"Emotional states\\". The Globe and Mail, March 22, 1986. The novel had been sent to Dennis Lee for editing several years before it was published. Upon the release of Helmet of Flesh, Symons described his guiding philosophy in an interview with June Callwood for The Globe and Mail: \\"I gave up everything so, first of all, I could feel, and in feeling, I could see, and in seeing, with some inner exploration, I could express...You have to risk. Sometimes I risk to the point of an anarchy, but I risk.\\"June Callwood, \\"Author sad that many have robbed themselves of inner life\\". The Globe and Mail, May 21, 1986. Although purportedly the first book of a trilogy, no follow-up books to Helmet of Flesh have been published. In 1990, he published two essays in The Idler, a critique of Margaret Atwood and a defense of Mazo de la Roche. Having published relatively little new writing since leaving Canada, however, he spent most of his time in Morocco relying primarily on financial support from Taylor. He was in a relationship with Aaron Klokeid for much of his time living in Morocco; despite this, he strongly identified with the subversive \\"outlaw\\" aspects of homosexuality and disliked the increasing normalization and acceptance of gay people. He had little interest in participating in the gay liberation movement, and even harshly criticized Pierre Trudeau for decriminalizing homosexuality in his 1968 revision of the Criminal Code. Despite his frequent opposition to conventional sexual values, however, he often railed against the decline of Canada's British and French cultural traditions; he was especially outraged by Canada dropping the Canadian Red Ensign in favour of the contemporary maple leaf Flag of Canada, and dismissed many of the mainstream cultural institutions of Canada ‚Äî including the Canada Council, Massey College, the Parliament of Canada and the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation ‚Äî as \\"a Finishing School System for Wesleyans\\". In an Ottawa Citizen column after Symons' death, former Idler editor David Warren characterized Symons as a \\"violent Tory of the old school\\". Symons returned to Toronto in 1986 for the publication of Helmet of Flesh, and in 1998 for an appearance at Toronto's International Festival of Authors on the release of God's Fool, a documentary film about him by filmmaker Nik Sheehan,Nik Sheehan, \\"Scott Symons blew the hinges off the closet door\\". Xtra!, March 12, 2009. and Dear Reader: Selected Scott Symons, an anthology of his published and unpublished writings edited by Christopher Elson. In declining health and with his financial support having dried up after Taylor's death, he returned to Toronto permanently in 2000. In an interview with The Body Politic during his visit to promote Helmet of Flesh, Symons articulated his philosophy of sexual identity: \\"I am certainly a devoted homosexual. Nobody could doubt my credentials. But I think, politically, we allowed this word gay to...It buggers up a nice word. It doesn't cover what we are. A lot of us are not very joyous. We have a hard life to live, against the current. Gay doesn't cover that ‚Äî and worst of all, it labels us. They can dismiss you and put you off in a corner: \\"Oh, he's gay,\\" and that's it. That's the end. You can no longer be central to what's going on. That's tragic....The world loses central contact with some of the most beautiful, sentient, sensitive and agitated, creative and emotional people in our society. The result is that a lot of people who operate centrally in our society can't let on that they're gay. It's tragic. It's very dangerous.\\"\\"Monstrous visions\\". The Body Politic, June 1986. p. 24-27. He published a few journalism pieces in the National Post and worked on an unpublished novella, Kali's Dance. Both of his earlier novels, Place d'Armes and Civic Square, were reissued by Dundurn Press in the late 2000s. He eventually moved into a nursing home, and died there in 2009 at the age of 75. Along with Robin Hardy and Norman Elder, he was the subject of a chapter in Ian Young's 2013 book Encounters with Authors: Essays on Scott Symons, Robin Hardy, Norman Elder.\\"'Encounters with Authors: Essays on Scott Symons, Robin Hardy, Norman Elder' by Ian Young\\".

It was active in the late 1930s and early 1940s, and was individualist in outlook. It campaigned for a reduction in the size of government, a reform of the civil service, a limit on the powers of political parties, and an end to the governing Labour Party's \\"socialist\\" policies. Although the Movement had a relatively high political profile, it did not achieve any notable successes. In April 1940, the Movement was joined by Albert Davy, an astute political organiser who had been credited with successful campaigns for the United Party and the Reform Party. However his Democrat Party formed in 1934 only split the conservative vote in the and the , and aided the 1935 Labour landslide. Again, Davy and the People's Movement failed to make much impact. In February 1941, a faction of the Movement merged into the National Party, and in 1942, Davy branched off to found the New Zealand Co-operative Party. In the 1943 elections, the remnants of the People's Movement (organised by Davy) sponsored 25 candidates under the name of the \\"Independent Group\\" or \\"Independent People's Group\\" (IPG), but the candidates got only 7,389 votes (0.89%; provisional vote count) and none were elected. Davy complained that the 1943 election was decided on \\"strictly party\\" lines, and said that the effect of the Democratic Labour Party standing was to give six seats to the National Party.

Lorica hamata comes from the Latin hamatus (hooked) from hamus which means \\"hook\\", as the rings hook into one another.  Usage In The Roman Army  Modern historians believe that mail armor was invented by the Celts.This must mean that the Romans' knowledge of mail manufacture probably came from conflicts with the Celts in the third century.http://www.middle- ages.org.uk/chainmail.htmIt was utilized by both legionary and auxilia troops. The first documented use occurred during the Roman conquest of Hispania. There were several versions of this type of armour, specialized for different military duties such as skirmishers, cavalry\\"The development of Roman mailed cavalry\\", By JOHN W. EADIE and spearmen. Over its lifetime, lorica hamata remained in constant use by legionaries and it was the preferred armour of centurions, who favored its greater coverage and lower maintenance. Constant friction kept the rings of the lorica hamata free of rust. Only the richest soldiers could afford to wear it. During the early empire depictions of emperors wearing either the lorica hamata or lorica squamata were very rare.However, during the later empire such depictions were more common. During the 1st century AD it was starting to be supplemented by lorica segmentata, but had been reintroduced as sole standard-issue armour by the 4th century. Despite that, the lorica hamata was still common among the legionary soldiers in the 2nd century.  Forging  132x132px The flaps on a lorica hamata The lorica hamata and was mostly manufactured out of bronze\\"A Fragment of Chain- Mail from the Romano-British Temple Site at Woodeaton\\" or iron. The armor was made from alternating rows of rings and rows of riveted rings. The rings would be made from punching holes in iron sheets. The riveted rings would be made from wires with their ends butted together. This produced very flexible, reliable and strong armour. Each ring had an inside diameter of about 5 mm, and an outside diameter of about 7 mm. There were 35,000 to 40,000 rings in the armor. The armor was cut like a Greek curiass made of linen. Leather pyterges were underneath the armor. The lorica hamata contained flaps that ran from the center of the back of the armor to the center of the front of the armor. These flaps were connected to the main armor through hooks made of either brass or iron that connected to studs riveted through the ends of the flaps. During the Republican period of Rome, the armor was also sleeveless. Despite the lack of sleeves, the lorica hamata still protected the wearers shoulders through shoulder pieces. During the Imperial period of Roman History, the armor would gain sleeves. By the 3rd century, those sleeves would extend to the elbows of the soldier wearing it. During the reign of Augustus the previously mentioned shoulder pieces would extend to the upper arm. The shoulder pieces were attached to the regular armor through bronze hooks. Those hooks would be stylized as snakes and horns. The practice of stylizing the armor probably originated from the Celts. By the end of the first century the practice of stylizing the hooks fell out of favor. A standard lorica hamata weighed around 11 kg, though this would vary depending on the design and the materials used. Despite the fact that the armor was difficult to forge, with good maintenance, the armour could be used for several decades. The comfort of the armor did come at the cost of some protection. However, the armor still protected its wearers well.The estimated production time was two months, even with continual slave labor at the state-run armories.

Glaze took over vocal duties in 1982 after Hart left the band, while still contributing some additional guitar parts on some of the band's songs. His vocal range caught the attention of many record label A & R's and he was credited for bringing Pantera to the forefront of heavy metal music, but a dispute in the band's direction led to Glaze's departure. Post-Pantera In 1986, Glaze joined three rock musicians from Tennessee to form the band Lord Tracy, releasing one LP (Deaf Gods of Babylon) in 1989 through Uni Records. The band broke up in 1991 and Glaze formed another band, Blowphish, which included Mike Malinin (Goo Goo Dolls).

He played on over 250 recordings and released more than two dozen albums as a soloist. He was inducted into the Alabama Jazz Hall of Fame in 1995.  Early years  Born in Mobile, Alabama, Green was taught the piano as a child by his mother. He learned jazz and popular tunes from the beginning. He started to play trombone, which both older brothers played, when he was about 12. Although he listened to trombonists Tommy Dorsey, J. C. Higginbotham, Jack Jenney, Jack Teagarden and Trummy Young, he has said he was more influenced by the styles of Dizzy Gillespie, Charlie Parker, and Lester Young. His style was also influenced by the vocals of Perry Como and Louis Armstrong.  Career  When Green was fifteen his father died and he began his music career, first with the Tommy Reynolds in California, then with Bob Strong, Jan Savitt, and Frankie Carle. At Auburn High School he was member of The Auburn Knights Orchestra. In 1947 he joined Gene Krupa's band and three years later, with his brother Jack, became a member of Woody Herman's Thundering Herd In 1953 he moved to New York City and a year later was voted New Star trombonist in the International Critics Poll at Down Beat magazine. During the 1950s and 1960s he toured with Benny Goodman and led the Tommy Dorsey orchestra after Dorsey's death in 1956. He worked with record producer Enoch Light on the albums The Persuasive Trombone of Urbie Green and 21 Trombones. Green spent his later life with his second wife Kathy, a jazz singer, at their home in the Poconos region of Pennsylvania. In 1995 Green was elected into the Alabama Jazz Hall of Fame. He continued playing live at the Delaware Water Gap Celebration of the Arts (COTA) Festival every September into the last years of his life. Green's obituary was published in the Pocono Record.

The manga was serialized in Akita Shoten's Young Champion magazine, spanning 3 volumes. In 2003, Tomizawa released a 1-volume sequel to the series called Alien 9 Emulators. In 2015, Tomizawa also released a sequel doujinshi to Alien 9 and Alien 9 Emulators called Alien 9 Next. Both the manga and anime are noted for their moe art style contrasting the realistic art style seen in most seinen series at the time and heavy violence despite the young main characters, Pok√©mon-like monster designs, and initial appearances of a slice-of-life-esque series. The English adaptation of the series was first licensed by Central Park Media, and has played on Comcast's Anime Selects. Central Park Media released the title under their \\"US Manga Corps\\" line, on a single DVD, and later re-released the DVD in a box set with all three manga volumes, which was also licensed by Central Park Media under their \\"CPM Manga\\" line. Central Park Media filed for bankruptcy in 2009, and the DVDs and manga volumes subsequently went out of print in North America.  Story = Alien Nine  In the year 2014, 16 years after humanity's first contact with aliens, Yuri Otani, a rather melancholic 12-year-old, has just arrived in the sixth grade at Elementary School No. 9. She is elected, against her wishes, by an overwhelming majority of her classmates in the Tsubaki (Camellia) Class to join the \\"Alien Party\\", a team whose primary objective is to capture any otherworldly aliens that may appear on campus, advised by the teacher Megumi Hisakawa. To make matters even worse for Yuri, the only way to capture the aliens is to adjoin with a Borg, a symbiotic life-form whose sole purpose is to protect their host, incapacitate, and ultimately capture other aliens, using anything available to their arsenal (which includes, but is not limited to: Borgs, inline roller blades, knee pads, tranquilizer dart guns, and lacrosse sticks.) Yuri is not alone in her tribulations, for she has two other Alien Party member friends - Kasumi T≈çmine and Kumi Kawamura. Over time it becomes clear that Kumi and Kasumi are far more capable alien fighters than Yuri, who is terrified of the aliens and wants nothing more than to leave the Alien Party. It is subsequently revealed that Ms. Hisakawa is the one releasing the aliens for the alien fighters to train with, as the Alien Party is really intended to raise suitable human hosts for symbiotic fusion with the Borg of the Drill Clan (Ms. Hisakawa herself being one result of the process). In an attempt to push Yuri harder in order to speed up her progress, Ms. Hisakawa gives three boys in the school the aggressive \\"Gladius\\" parasitic alien in order to serve as training targets because of the apparently \\"relatively weak\\" nature of the alien. She also instructs Yuri to take care of the aliens in the alien storeroom by herself, setting her up for the three boys to corner and attack her. However, this backfires when Yuri is overcome by fear and panic, causing her Borg to overreact and kill every alien in the storeroom (including the \\"Gladius\\" aliens). As she walks out of the storeroom to meet her close friend Miyu, traumatized and still wearing her Borg, she encounters Kumi and Kasumi (who telepathically sense her overwhelming fear through their connection with their Borgs) and also ends up killing their Borgs as her own Borg instinctively lashes out against the other aliens she fears. She finally collapses at Miyu's feet on her knees in tears, her own Borg dying due to the overreaction and falling off her head. As a result of the incident, Ms. Hisakawa is rebuked by the headmistress of the school, Ms. Okada (another Borg-fused human), and informed that she may even be replaced by another advisor by the supervisors. With the Borgs dead, it will take about a month for her to create new ones with the memories of the old ones. Fortunately, the incident takes place just before the summer, and the alien fighters go on a vacation together with Miyu in order to cheer up Yuri and allow her to recover from the traumatizing incident with the \\"Gladius\\" aliens. With renewed determination, Yuri resolves to do better in the coming semester. After returning to school, a new alien type known as a \\"Yellow Knife\\" lands on the school. Kasumi displays an unusual attraction towards the \\"Yellow Knife\\" and ends up letting herself be consumed by it, somehow coming to identify it with her beloved older brother. In order to \\"protect\\" Kasumi by making sure nobody gets close to her, the \\"Yellow Knife\\" then starts projecting psychic waves that induce headaches in people unprotected by Borg symbiotes. The Alien Party remains unaffected and attempts to cut Kasumi out of the \\"Yellow Knife\\". Feeling threatened by the Alien Party and using her desperate loneliness following her older brother's departure for the United States, the \\"Yellow Knife\\" then projects her an illusion towards the Alien Party that makes them think they are completely alone in the world. Both Yuri and Kumi are emotionally crippled by the loneliness, but Kumi's Borg manages to snap her out of it and she is able to see through the illusion and reach Yuri. Together, they are able to fatally wound the \\"Yellow Knife\\" and extract Kasumi from it, but not before it manages to symbiotically fuse with Kasumi. Kasumi then proceeds to strangle Kumi for hurting the \\"Yellow Knife\\" until Yuri's pleas cause the \\"Yellow Knife\\" to convince her to stop, since their fusion meant that it would always be with her. The \\"Yellow Knife\\" then explodes, perishing. Still recovering from the \\"Yellow Knife\\" incident, Kumi is then discovered dead in the school library by Kasumi. It is at this point that the OVA series ends. In the manga, it is shown that Kumi had become suspicious of Kasumi's behavior following her rescue from the \\"Yellow Knife\\" and had gone into the library to research more about the \\"Yellow Knife\\" when she was attacked and killed. Her body severely damaged by the alien, she is then put under reconstruction with the cell gel. In the meantime, while looking for clues about the attacker, Yuri and Kasumi are themselves attacked by the alien, a \\"Lynax\\". The \\"Lynax\\" proves to be beyond the capabilities of Yuri and Kasumi, and they both begin to be overwhelmed. Sensing their desperation, Kumi's reconstruction is sped up by an unusual merging with her Borg, and she recovers just in time to save Yuri and Kasumi. Following this incident, Yuri, uncomfortable with Kasumi's unusual behavior and Kumi's apparent return from the dead, wanders into the Forest of Spaceships, a dangerous area of the school inhabited by aliens, where she is attacked and separated from her Borg. In order to protect its host, the Borg stores Yuri's memories, but has gone into hiding. In order to restore Yuri's memories, Kumi and Kasumi enter the forest in search of Yuri's Borg. There, they succeed in recovering the critically injured Borg but are themselves attacked by other aliens. Kasumi ends up revealing her fusion with the \\"Yellow Knife\\", successfully fending off and killing multiple attacking aliens, while Kumi's arm is torn off, revealing that she no longer has a human body: her arm is nothing more than a layer of skin surrounding several Borg drills. After recovering the Borg, they restore Yuri's memories. In the aftermath, Kasumi and the \\"Yellow Knife\\" inside her are interrogated by Ms. Hisakawa. The \\"Yellow Knife\\" remarks about how humans make good symbiotic hosts for aliens and that other aliens have figured out the strategy of the Drill Clan; they have now targeted humans for symbiosis as well. With Kasumi having fused with the \\"Yellow Knife\\" and Kumi herself turned into a Borg, losing human functions such as reproduction and no longer viable as a symbiotic host, Yuri is the only viable human host left among the Alien Party members for the Drill Clan. Kumi then resolves to protect Yuri from getting fused with any alien and enlists Kasumi's help. In the third and final semester of school, Yuri's Borg begins to become agitated as it desperately wants to fuse with Yuri. Taking pity on it, Ms. Hisakawa allows Yuri's Borg to attempt to force Yuri to fuse with it, but Yuri resists and the Borg is stopped by Kumi and Kasumi. Meanwhile, the Sunflower Clan, mortal enemies of the Drill Clan, arrive at the school. They succeed in capturing Yuri and attempt to fuse with her and other students in the Tsubaki Class, but are far more aggressive and manipulative, resulting in serious injury to most students the Sunflowers attempt to fuse with. Kasumi attempts to disable Yuri using her \\"Yellow Knife\\" psychic abilities, but is overwhelmed by Yuri and three other boys controlled by the Sunflowers. The Sunflowers attempt to fuse with Kasumi, who struggles furiously against them, begging for them to be removed. Yuri, having not completely fused with the Sunflowers, removes the Sunflower from Kasumi just as Ms. Hisakawa and her Borg arrive to kill the Sunflowers and Yuri. Kumi, believing that Yuri can still be saved because she has not fused completely with the Sunflower, stops Ms. Hisakawa. With the help of Yuri's Borg, is able to reach into Yuri's mind and ultimately get her to overcome the Sunflowers. In the aftermath of the Sunflower invasion, the Tsubaki Class is treated for their injuries, with the students permitted to miss the Japanese entrance exam and pick any junior high school they wish. Headmistress Okada points out to Ms. Hisakawa that it may be a good thing for the humans to be allowed to choose other clans or aliens they wished to fuse with. When Ms. Hisakawa replies that it will be much harder and they'll have to convince the humans that they'll be happier living with the Drill Clan, the headmistress chides her, saying she'd \\"better get it together.\\" The following spring, Yuri has moved in together with Kasumi and Kumi, who are attending the same junior high school. While apparently still unchanged from her elementary school habits such as sleeping in late (much to Kumi's chagrin) and apparently still an ordinary human, as she wakes up and gets ready for school, she notices a lock of her hair has started curling into a drill.  Alien Nine Emulators  Alien Nine Emulators is set in the spring of 2015, picking up immediately after the end of Alien Nine. Yuri, Kumi, Kasumi, and Miyu are now students at the Hinode Junior High School, with the first three now sharing an apartment. Thinking she has put all alien-related matters behind her, Yuri is dismayed to find herself once again drafted as an alien fighter along with Kumi and Kasumi when a spaceship lands at Hinode. They are drafted by Monami Komai, a third- year student at Hinode who is herself an alien fighter and alien symbiont. Yuri is subsequently kidnapped by 6th and 7th generation Borg symbionts, who intend to use her and another kidnapped student to evolve into 10th generation Borg symbionts. However, the older Borg symbionts are killed by an 8th generation Borg symbiont in order to evolve itself into a 10th generation Borg symbiont. The other alien fighters, along with Ms. Hisakawa who was sent by Principal Okada to investigate the reports of older generation Borg appearing at Hinode, arrive to rescue Yuri. Kumi recognizes the 8th generation Borg as the one who stabbed her in the library back in Elementary School No. 9, leading to her death at the hands of the \\"Lynax\\" alien. Enraged, she fights and kills the 8th generation Borg. Principal Okada subsequently informs Ms. Hisakawa that the \\"committee\\" suspects that Kumi may be a 10th generation Borg. A resurgence in the number of aliens arriving at the school leads to Ms. Hisakawa putting the fighters in charge of an \\"alien district\\"; since Yuri is not a symbiont, she is given an apparently defective Borg that cannot fuse with her for protection. However, the \\"defective\\" Borg is actually Ms. Hisakawa's fused Borg in disguise, assigned to observe the students. It observes Kumi feeling very lonely and homesick and crying in her apartment, thus ruling her out as a 10th generation Borg. Yuri has also become friends with a male schoolmate, which leads to the overprotective Kumi becoming jealous. While reporting its findings to Ms. Hisakawa, Kasumi becomes aware of the true nature of Yuri's Borg. Having tried to comfort Kumi during her bouts of loneliness, she and the Yellow Knife fused with her decide to help Kumi. In May 2015, Kasumi enacts her plan, and a group of Yellow Knife aliens descend on the Hinode Junior High School. Using psychic interference waves to knock out nearly everyone within a radius of the school and begin to consume students. Kasumi also kills Ms. Hisakawa's Borg, much to her distress. Kasumi then wakes Kumi up, who is swallowed by a Yellow Knife. Revealing that Kumi is dying of loneliness from her refusal to fuse with Yuri, Kasumi tells Yuri that she has an obligation to save Kumi after all the times Kumi has saved her. Yuri is then engulfed by the same Yellow Knife. Ms. Hisakawa, still agitated by her Borg's death, steals the Principal's Borg and attempts to use it to kill Kasumi, but is stopped by Monami. However, Monami's Borg, on its own initiative, stabs Kasumi with a tendril, disabling her. Ms. Hisakawa then goes off to destroy the Yellow Knives and release the trapped students. Inside one of the Yellow Knives, the Borg within Kumi as now taken control and wishes to fuse with Yuri. Having destroyed some of the Yellow Knives, Monami restrains Ms. Hisakawa before she can destroy the next Yellow Knife and chastises her for her callousness. However, the Yellow Knife releases an apparently fused Yuri and Kumi, much to their surprise. Restrained for examination, \\"Yuri\\" is revealed to be Kumi in disguise. Unwilling to sacrifice Yuri in order to save herself, Kumi begs Monami to kill her before her Borg takes over completely. Yuri crawls out from the Yellow Knife's stomach, but by the time she reaches the containment cell, Kumi's Borg has already taken over and she starts to lash out in desperation in order to fuse. In order to save Kumi, Monami disables Kumi and uses her Borg to transfer Kumi's memory into Kasumi's unfused Borg. The story ends with Kasumi and Ms. Hisakawa going to California along with Kumi in order to help her recover, while Yuri remains in Japan as a member of the Hinode Junior High Alien Fighters.  Alien 9 Next  Alien 9 Next is set 11 years after the original series, in September 2025. Yuri has now joined an alien pest handling company started by Monami, while Kumi, Ms. Hisakawa, and Kasumi (who is now Queen of the Yellow Knives) have embarked on a joint Yellow Knife-Borg venture, creating the first Earth-made \\"Star Seed.\\" Kumi, along with Borgs carrying Kasumi and Yuri's personalities, embarks on the maiden voyage of the Star Seed as an \\"astro-navigator\\". The craft ends up landing on the Borg homeworld, and Kumi is captured by the original Borg. Kasumi's Borg-Yellow Knife hybrid onboard the now-crippled Star Seed combines its power with Yuri's Borg to send a signal back to Earth to inform the team. However, the signal compels the Principal to \\"obey the originals\\" and she kills Kasumi, leaving two Borgs trapped in the Star Seed with no communications with Earth. Because of her fusion with the Yellow Knives, the Yellow Knives simply birth another Kasumi after she dies, who remarks that the original Borg are no longer a myth. The series ends with a man approaching Monami and Yuri with a request for the alien fighters.  Characters  ; : :A quiet girl, who was voted by her 6th-grade classmates to be their representative on the Alien Party. Yuri is very reluctant to merge with her Borg. She is easily frightened and there is hardly anything that won't make her cry, being scared or happy. ; : :The most independent member of the Alien Party, and a 6th-grade student. She has been a member of the Student Council for years and has assisted her widowed mother in her writing activities as well as an above average number of chores for a student her age.

Other characters ; Yuri's Mom : ; Hiroshi Iwanami : ; Yellow Knife : ; Principal : Release=Alien NineAlien Nine Emulators=Anime The first half of the series (through the middle of Volume 2) was later adapted into an original video animation (OVA) series, which was released across four volumes by Bandai Visual from 2001 to 2002, containing one episode each. Animated by J.C.Staff and produced by Genco, the first volume of the series was directed by Jir≈ç Fujimoto, while volumes 2-4 were directed by Yasuhiro Irie, who also handled the entire series' character designs, and was written by Sadayuki Murai. A special TV broadcast was aired prior to the series' DVD release on AT-X. The opening themes are \\"Flower Psychedelic: Kasumi Tomine Version\\" by Noriko Shitaya, \\"Flower Psychedelic: Kumi Kawamura Version\\" by Kaori Shimizu, and \\"Flower Psychedelic: Yuri Otani Version\\" by Juri Ihata, the ending theme is \\"rebirth\\" by en avant. It has been broadcast by the anime television network Animax across its respective networks worldwide, including East Asia and its English-language networks in Southeast Asia (where it was previously also aired by its sister network AXN) and South Asia. The anime was licensed and released in North America by Central Park Media, with the series being aired across the region on Comcast's Select On Demand service. As the OVA series ends halfway through the story, the DVD was made available in America in an \\"Ultimate Edition\\", which included all three original volumes of the collected translated manga. Tar≈ç Maki (President of Genco and executive producer of the anime OVA adaptation) has stated in an interview that due to the abruptness of the anime OVA ending, he stated that will raise funds to continue the series. However, this has not happened for over a decade and is considered to be in development hell and is most likely cancelled. That does not, however, rule out the possibility of a reboot to cover all three of the manga volumes plus the sequel, Alien Nine Emulators. Because of its rarity and cheap price, it has somewhat become a cult classic amongst fans and collectors alike.

Gold served as a government witness and testified in the case of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, who were convicted and executed in 1953 for their roles. Gold served 15 years in prison. Born in Bern, Switzerland, to parents from the Russian Empire, Gold had immigrated to the US with his parents as a child at the age of four. They settled in Philadelphia. During the Great Depression, he found work and finished his degree in chemistry at night. He returned to work as a clinical chemist after release from prison. Early life Heinrich Golodnitsky was born on December 12, 1910, in Bern, Switzerland to Samson and Celia (Ominsky) Golodnitsky, both Jewish immigrants from what is now Ukraine–î–æ–∫—É–º–µ–Ω—Ç—ã –§–ë–†: Golodnitzki. and was then part of the Russian Empire. Samson had grown up in Smila, where his father was a successful merchant. He was sent to Switzerland for additional schooling, as opportunities for Jews were limited in Russia, but he was already influenced by reading Leo Tolstoy, and chose to go into woodworking. He became a carpenter. Henrich's mother Celia had first emigrated from central Ukraine (Russia) as a teenager to Paris, where she studied dentistry. She had become radicalized in Russia and supported the Zionist movement. After running out of money, she took a job in a cigar factory in Bern, where she met Samson. They married about 1907 or 1908.Alan M. Hornblum, The Invisible Harry Gold: The Man Who Gave the Soviets the Atom Bomb, New Haven, CT: Yale University Press, 2010 When Heinrich was 4, his family immigrated to the United States, seeking more opportunity. After they arrived at New York in July 1914, an agent at Ellis Island suggested they shorten their surname to Gold, which they agreed to, and they kept that version. In the United States, the boy became known as Harry. They first went to Chicago, where Sam worked in a coalyard and Celia in a tobacco factory, both limited by their lack of English. After a year, they left. Sam went to Norfolk, Virginia, where he had some relatives. Celia took their son to Philadelphia, where her brother Shama had settled. When the shipyard job and conditions in Norfolk did not work out, Sam joined them in Philadelphia, a major industrial city. They settled in South Philadelphia in 1915 in the Jewish section. Ethnic Irish occupied territory to the north, and Italians to the west. After some other jobs, Sam found work as a cabinetmaker at the Victor Talking Machine Company in Camden, New Jersey, across the Delaware River. In 1917, Gold‚Äôs mother had another son, named Yussel (Joseph) after a grandfather. Neighbors on Philip Street later described the Gold family as having been unusually quiet and stand-offish, but Harry Gold said he had a happy and secure childhood. He greatly enjoyed learning and was a good student in school. To supplement Sam's modest earnings, Celia taught Hebrew and Yiddish to neighborhood children, and was considered an excellent teacher. She expanded the lessons with Jewish folklore and Hebrew literature. But in the early 20th century, immigrant groups in Philadelphia clashed over their territories; Gold as a boy in the neighborhood suffered with this, especially since he was small and slight, and non- athletic. His father complained of discrimination by newly hired Italian immigrants at the Victor Company, where he was one of the few Jews. In the mid-1920s an Irish foreman tried to drive him out of the factory, but he persisted. Gold admired his father's stoicism but resented the conflicts and developed a desire to fight prejudice. He had an early interest in chemistry and graduated from South Philadelphia High School in 1929. Early career After high school graduation, Gold was offered a job by one of his father‚Äôs acquaintances at Giftcrafters, a woodworking firm in the northern Kensington section of the city. While looking for other positions, Gold applied and gained a job at the Pennsylvania Sugar Company, located on the banks of the Delaware River. A job there would give him economic security and the chance to work with college-educated chemists and state-of-the art labs. He saved money from his work and attended the University of Pennsylvania full time from 1930 to 1932 before his money ran out. The Great Depression was unfolding and he returned to PA Sugar to help his family. Great Depression, work, and espionage Gold had expressed interest in the Socialist Party early in life, influenced by his mother, and the family bought the Jewish Daily Forward. He later said that he thought Communism was related to \\"a wild and vaguely defined phenomenon going on in a primitive country thousands of miles away.\\"Richard Rhodes (1995) Dark Sun: The Making of the Hydrogen Bomb, Simon & Schuster Paperbacks. pp. 83‚Äì84. For other Americans, the economic crisis challenged faith in capitalism. A week before Christmas 1932, Gold was laid off by the sugar company. Both Harry and his father Sam looked for work each morning, to no avail. The Gold family faced economic ruin. Gold was offered a job by Tom Black, a former classmate, at the Holbrook Manufacturing Company in Jersey City. Black befriended him and tried to recruit Gold to the Communist Party. Grateful to Black for his friendship and a chance to work, Gold reluctantly became involved. But he continued to hold his views against the Party. When Gold found that the PA Sugar Company was hiring at the same salary he was making, he decided to return to the company, Philadelphia, and his family. Black visited Gold and his family, all the while encouraging him to attend communist meetings and join the party. In 1934, Gold started passing industrial secrets to Black from the sugar company. During this time, Gold also attended Drexel Institute of Technology, and took night courses in chemistry, to keep working toward his goal in chemistry. In 1940, Jacob Golos activated Gold for Soviet espionage, but he was not a recruited agent of the rezidentura. In the late 1940s, Soviet Case Officer Semyon Semenov appropriated Gold from Golos for use by the NKVD. Gold became a formally recruited Soviet agent at this time, and was assigned the codename GUS, GOS, or GOOSE. Semenov remained Gold's control officer until March 1944. After the war, tensions increased between the US and the Soviet Union following its takeover of territory in Eastern Europe. Communist governments led East Germany, Poland, Yugoslavia, and other eastern nations dominated by the Soviet Union. The Cold War between the US and the Soviet Union had begun. Gold in 1966 In 1950, Klaus Fuchs, an NKVD agent, was arrested in England and charged with espionage. Fuchs confessed that while working in the United States during World War II, he had passed information about the atom bomb to the Soviet Union, then a US ally. Fuchs denied working with other spies, except for a courier who collected information from him. When initially shown photographs of suspects, including Gold, he failed to identify him. After prompting by the prosecution, he identified Gold. Gold was arrested that year. Under interrogation by US officials, he admitted that he had been involved in espionage since 1934 and had helped Fuchs pass information about the Manhattan Project to the Soviet Union by way of Soviet General Consul Anatoli Yakovlev. Gold's confession identified many other people connected to the espionage network, and led to the arrest of David Greenglass. He had worked as a machinist at the Manhattan Project and passed material to Gold. Greenglass's testimony resulted in the arrest in 1950 of his sister Ethel and her husband Julius Rosenberg, who were also charged with conspiracy to commit espionage. Gold cooperated and was a government witness in the trial of the Rosenbergs, as was Greenglass. The latter's testimony contributed to their convictions and death sentences; they were executed. Unable to make the $100,000 bail, Gold was jailed for 7 and a half months before his trial. In 1951, he was convicted and sentenced to 30 years' imprisonment. In May 1965, one of his appeals resulted in his being paroled for good behavior after serving less than half that time. He was also credited for the time in jail before his trial. Gold returned to Philadelphia. He worked as a clinical chemist in the pathology lab of John F. Kennedy Memorial Hospital, and ultimately for the chief pathologist. He died on August 28, 1972, during heart surgery, at the age of 62. He had never married. He was interred in Har Nebo Cemetery in Philadelphia County, Pennsylvania.

The network carries programs related to the military, warfare, and military history and science. As of February 2015, the channel is available to approximately 59,917,000 pay television households (51.5% of households with at least one television set) in the United States. Background The channel launched in July 1998, as Discovery Wings Channel; it originally focused on programs relating to aircraft and aerospace. During its early years, the network also aired a weather segment near the top of each hour featuring aviation forecast data from the National Weather Service. Discovery Communications filed a trademark application with the United States Copyright Office for the use of the name \\"Military Channel\\" in 2002, after the trademark was abandoned by an unrelated start-up cable network based in Louisville, Kentucky, also named The Military Channel, which went dark in 1999 and later went bankrupt. That network ‚Äì which focused on the heroes, history and hardware of the international military scene ‚Äì experienced difficulty raising capital, despite early success. Logo as Military Channel, used from January 10, 2005 to March 2, 2014. On January 10, 2005, the network was rebranded as the Military Channel.December 2004 reuters.com article Carrying over from its original format, many of the network's programs as the Military Channel were dedicated to aerial warfare and related technologies and issues. In 2005, the channel aired its first live program from Philadelphia at the site of the Army‚ÄìNavy college football game, two hours before that game's kickoff, in which Fox Sports commentator Chris Myers hosted from a set outside of Lincoln Financial Field. On March 3, 2014, the channel was rebranded as American Heroes Channel, with the intent to \\"provide more history based, narrative-style documentary programming.\\" The network is a sponsor of the United Service Organizations (USO) and frequently runs commercials for that organization. Programming Many of the programs featured on American Heroes Channel are war documentaries, the contents of which deal in large part with modern warfare, and in particular the U.S. military from World War II onward. While the A+E Networks-owned History, Military History and H2 air similar programming, those networks tend to show more programs about other time periods and cultures (ancient, Roman, Medieval, Eastern, and other forms of warfare). AHC has a more contemporary subject matter than those competitors, but it occasionally presents historical programming as well. Actor Dennis Haysbert serves as the network's continuity announcer for its on-air promotions. In addition, the channel also presents feature films with a military theme (usually within the hosted movie series An Officer and a Movie, which is hosted by Lou Diamond Phillips), as well as individual episodes of other shows (such as Belly of the Beast, Build It Bigger, Extreme Machines, Timewatch and Unsolved History), which incorporate military-related content. These are often shows that were produced for other Discovery Communications- owned channels.

He spent some time in the American Wrestling Association with Golden in 1988, and they feuded with The Rock 'n' Roll Express (Ricky Morton and Robert Gibson). He also wrestled in the Texas area where he teamed with Jeff Jarrett. In 1993, Fuller went to World Championship Wrestling as manager Col. Robert Parker, a takeoff of Col. Tom Parker of Elvis Presley fame. He managed Sid Vicious and teamed with manager Harley Race and his protege, Vader to form \\"The Masters of the Powerbomb\\". They feuded with Sting and Davey Boy Smith. In 1994, he managed \\"Stunning Steve\\" Austin before reforming his \\"Stud Stable\\" with Golden as \\"Bunkhouse Buck\\", Meng, Dick Slater, Terry Funk and Arn Anderson. They feuded heavily with Dusty and Dustin Rhodes. In 1995, Col. Parker courted Sherri Martel to the dismay of both the Stud Stable and Sherri's charges, Harlem Heat. Parker and Sherri went to get married and Sherri was attacked by Madusa, who was supposed to be Parker's wife. Parker and Sherri split and feuded and then made up again, with Parker leaving the Stud Stable to help Sherri manage Harlem Heat. While with Harlem Heat, Parker's official title was \\"promoter\\", while Sherri retained the \\"manager\\" designation. One trademark of Parker's managing would be his fanning himself during matches. In October 1996, Harlem Heat fired Parker after he cost them the WCW World Tag Team Championships. He quickly started to manage The Amazing French Canadians (Jacques Rougeau and Carl Ouellet), trading in his gray suit for a French Foreign Legion uniform. Harlem Heat and The Amazing French Canadians began feuding. Fuller was released from WCW in 1997 and in March 1998, he resurfaced in the WWF as Tennessee Lee, a character similar to his Col. Parker character, and began managing Jeff Jarrett. His time in the WWF was short-lived; he would be released in August 1998 and went back to wrestling with Golden on the independent circuit in Alabama. On June 2, 2006 in Irondale, Alabama, Fuller managed Shannon Spruill against El Mexico for the NWA Wrestle Birmingham Junior Heavyweight Championship. With the help of Fuller (who referred to Spruill as his \\"Million Dollar Baby\\"), Spruill defeated El Mexico to win her third wrestling title. On September 14, 2006, Fuller was seen, once again as Col. Parker, being interviewed by Robert Roode on TNA Impact!. On February 8, 2018, Fuller made a return to professional wrestling as Col. Robert Parker, a manager for Major League Wrestling. He reactivated The Stud Stable with the Dirty Blondes as his first signees. Personal life Robert Fuller comes from a wrestling family: his father Buddy Fuller and his grandfather Roy Welch were wrestlers, as were his brother Ron Fuller and his cousin Jimmy Golden (\\"Bunkhouse Buck\\"). He has been married four times: Joyce Logan, who he has his oldest daughter Kimberly by; Sylvia Wilson (Miss Sylvia), who he has Katie and Charlotte by; Susan Lostraglio, who he had no children with; and his current wife Laverne Stewart. He has 7 grandchildren. Fuller currently resides in Seminole, Florida.

The island was formerly inhabited, but the inhabitants were evacuated due to volcanic eruptions in 1981. Geography Pagan is located about north of Saipan, the main island of the Northern Mariana Islands. With an area of , it is the fourth largest island of the Northern Marianas. The island is a double island consisting of two stratovolcanoes joined by a narrow strip of land with a width of only . The southern volcano , is high with a caldera approximately in diameter, consisting of four craters joined together. Although several fumaroles were active in 1992, the southern volcano last erupted in 1864. The northern volcano, also known as Mount Pagan, , has a height of . The volcano is in the center of a caldera with a diameter of approximately , and eruptions have been documented in the 1820s, 1872‚Äì1873, 1925 and 1981‚Äì85. Pagan has two large lakes. Laguna Sanhalom (also Inner Lake) had an area of and depth of in the 1970s. Laguna Sanhiyon (also Laguna Lake) on the west coast of the northern island had an area of and depth of . Both lakes contain brackish water.Pacific Planning and Design Consultants: Physical Development Master Plan for the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands. Volume V, Pagan, Government Printing Office, January 1978, S. 10. History  Archaeological finds indicate that Pagan was settled from several centuries BC. The first European contact was in 1669, when the island was sighted by the Spanish missionary Diego Luis de San Vitores who named it San Ignacio (Saint Ignatius in Spanish). It is likely that it was previously visited in 1522 by the Spanish sailor Gonzalo de Vigo, deserter from the Magellan expedition in 1521, and the first European castaway in the history of the Pacific.Coello, Francisco \\"Conflicto hispano-alem√°n\\" Bolet√≠n de Sociedad Geogr√°fica de Madrid, t.XIX. 2¬∫ semestre 1885, Madrid, p.233,301. The native Chamorro population was forcibly deported to Saipan in 1695, and then three years later to Guam. The Chamorros began to return to Pagan in the early 19th century, but found that the island had been colonized by freed Kanakas from the Caroline islands. In the 1870s, first coconut plantations were established. After the sale of the Northern Mariana islands by Spain to the German Empire in 1899, the island was administered as part of the colony of German New Guinea and leased to a private company, the Pagan Society, which traded mainly copra. The company was a partnership between a German and Japanese man. The island was devastated by typhoons in July and September 1905, September 1907 and in December 1913 which destroyed the coconut plantations and bankrupted the Pagan Society. In 1914, during World War I, the island was captured by the Empire of Japan, which was awarded control by the League of Nations as part of the South Seas Mandate. The island was settled by ethnic Japanese and Okinawans, who restored the coconut plantations and raised cotton and sweet potatoes for export. In addition, the Japanese developed commercial fishing for bonito and tuna. An airfield was constructed in 1935, and the Imperial Japanese Navy established a garrison in 1937. In 1942 the Japanese civilian population was 413 persons, with another 229 Chamorro residents. In June 1944 a garrison force of 2,150 men of the Imperial Japanese Army arrived, only to be cut off and isolated by the ongoing Allied offensive. Receiving supplies only occasionally by submarine, the garrison soon faced starvation, and several hundred died of malnutrition before the surrender of Japan. Landsat view of Pagan After World War II and under United States occupation, Pagan became part of the UN Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands until being granted U.S. Commonwealth status. After the war the United States Navy maintained a small establishment on Pagan and during the 1950s built public institutions, including a church, a copra warehouse, an infirmary and a school house. However the civilian population was under 100 people by the end of the 1970s, many of whom were seasonally present from Saipan. On May 15, 1981, Mount Pagan erupted, with lava flows covering a large part of the island's arable land and part of the airfield runway; the island's inhabitants were evacuated to Saipan. The eruption continued until 1985, with further small outbreaks in 1987, 1988, 1992, 1993, 1996, 2006, 2009, 2010 and 2012. Repeated petitions by the islanders to return have been rejected by US authorities due to the continuing threat posed by the volcano. Efforts are underway by the Northern Islands Mayor's Office and concerned citizens to assist the approximately 300 displaced residents of the Northern Islands who wish to return and resettle in Anatahan, Alamagan, Pagan and Agrigan. Pagan Island was included during Operation Christmas Drop 2006. United States Air Force C-130 aircrew observed cattle and a small cluster of buildings, including a grass airstrip, located on the island. Plans by a Japanese investor group to use Pagan as a dumping ground for debris and rubble from the 2011 T≈çhoku earthquake and tsunami in Japan were provisionally shelved after protests in June 2012.Haidee V. Eugenio: No more tsunami debris. Japanese investors will still mine pozzolan. In: Saipan Tribune, 1. Jun 2012 Politically, Pagan remains part of the Northern Islands Municipality. Military live-fire training range plans In 2013 the US Naval Command filed a proposal to obtain the island for a new group of live-fire and maneuver Ranges and Training Areas (RTAs). The proposal spawned an online community called Our Islands are Sacred, a petition on Change.org, and rallies against it held by the Sierra Club, Save Pagan Island, Roots Action and Care2Make a Difference. Pagan island, March 2012 On April 3, 2015 (HST) the Department of Defense (DoD) released a long-awaited draft of the Environmental Impact Statement (EIS). According to Michael G. Hadfield, a professor of biology at the University of Hawaii-Manoa who led an insect survey team to Pagan in 2010, ‚ÄúSpeaking as a biologist, it‚Äôs got some really unique things about it. ... It‚Äôs not a wasteland, which I think some people envision because it‚Äôs got an active volcano. There‚Äôs a lot there that‚Äôs worth preserving ‚Äî a couple of endangered bird species and snail species ‚Äî which I specialize in and is about to hit the U.S. endangered species list.‚Äù Jerome Aldan (died in February 2017), the mayor for CNMI's Northern Islands, which includes Pagan, told a New Zealand radio program that the U.S. military's description of the island as ‚Äúuninhabited‚Äù was false. According to an article by James Cave for the Huffington Post, an article which used Hadfield as its source: \\"More than 50 families in Saipan consider Pagan their home island and have plans and desires to return to homesteads,\\" The island is occupied by two people, who live in shacks and have one flushing toilet and plumbing, electricity and small ranch. According to an April 17, 2015, article by Wyatt Olson for Stars and Stripes military news network, \\"the [legislature of the Northern Mariana Islands] is considering a joint resolution calling on the governor to oppose the military expansion on the 10-mile-long island. ... In wording that hints at the hornet‚Äôs nest the U.S. may have stirred with the proposal, the joint resolution asserts that ‚Äúthroughout the CNMI‚Äôs history, foreign powers and outside influences have made major decisions and have dictated the course of development‚Äù for the region and that the U.S. ‚Äúonce again stands poised to make some very important decisions with respect to the military utilization of the Northern Islands.‚Äù \\" On May 15, 2015, a map of the proposed site was made available online. Demographics As of 1980 the population of Pagan often changed as secondary students moved back and forth between their residences on Pagan and their schools on Saipan. In October 1977 Pagan had seven families with a total of 37 people. The resident commissioner's office stated that 51 people lived on Pagan in December 1977. As of 1980 Pagan had nine families with total of 85 people, including some people residing in Saipan.Northern Mariana Islands Coastal Resources Management: Environmental Impact Statement.

It starred Lucille Ball, in an attempt to make a dramatic \\"breakout\\" from her years in comedy, portraying an older homeless woman with few resources and even fewer options. Plot Carrie Lange (Daphne Zuniga) has just begun her career in social work. She wants to make a difference but must first learn what life is really like for New York City's homeless. She meets an elderly woman named Florabelle (Ball), who makes it known she does not want company or help. Equipped with the precious cart that contains all of her belongings, Flora takes care of herself on the streets of Manhattan. Carrie wins Flora's trust after saving her cart. Flora takes her for a runaway, and Carrie plays along as Flora finds her the best food and warmest places the street have to offer. Flora even divulges painful memories about her past life. They go to Grand Central Terminal for the night, but are separated after the police throw everyone out. Flora looks for Carrie at a shelter and is stunned to find her working there. She feels she has been betrayed. Against her will, Flora is shuttled off to a woman's shelter in Brooklyn, where she is treated poorly, and then must find her way back to Manhattan. Finding compassion difficult to come by even in those within her profession, Carrie decides she can make a difference one person at a time. Finally realizing she cannot go on living the way she does, Flora accepts Carrie's helping hand. Through Carrie's intervention, for the first time in years, Flora has a place to call home.

Biography=Early life Edward Hamersley was born in Paris on 1 September 1835. The Hamersleys were a well connected family, and he was related by blood or marriage to a number of prominent Western Australian farmers and politicians. His father Edward was one of the leading Western Australian landholders of his day; his brother Samuel and nephew Vernon both became Members of the Legislative Council; William Locke Brockman was his uncle; his sister Margaret married Sir John Forrest; and his wife Jane was sister to Andrew and Charles Dempster. In 1837, his family emigrated to Western Australia, where his father, Edward, became a wealthy and prominent pastoralist. In 1843, the family returned to France, but again went to Western Australia in 1850, building a home in Guildford, Western Australia near Perth. Career In 1853, he took charge of his father's horse station Richmond, in the Williams district. He was extremely unhappy at being sent away from the social scene at Guildford, and he managed the station poorly, prompting a contemporary John Wollaston to write :Hamersley's horse station... seems to me quite an apology for a breeding establishment... not a bit of hay nor handful of corn to be had.... The native dogs destroy the foals as soon as dropped. In 1858, his younger brother took over the station, and Hamersley was transferred to Wilberforce, another of his father's stations, located in York, Western Australia. In 1857, the governor agreed to allow settlers to elect men whom he would then nominate to the Western Australian Legislative Council. Edwards stood for election, but was defeated by his father's former partner and later enemy Samuel Pole Phillips.Erickson (1979) incorrectly states that Hamersley won the election but was overlooked in favour of Phillips; in fact Phillips polled 433 votes against Hamersley's 398. Western Australia having obtained representative government in 1870, he stood for election in 1874, and on 29 September of that year, he was elected to the Legislative Council seat of Toodyay. Two months later, his father died, and he was bequeathed two of his father's stations, Wilberforce and Woodside. He resigned his seat in the Legislative Council on 6 October 1875. On 11 February 1880, he was elected to the Legislative Council seat of York. He did not stand for election in 1884 and so ceased to be a member on 27 October of that year. After Western Australia gained responsible government in 1890, he was nominated to the Legislative Council on 24 December of that year, serving until the Council became fully elective in June 1894. He then contested the Legislative Council's East Province, but was unsuccessful. Personal life and death In February 1867, he married Jane Dempster. They had seven sons and three daughters. He was widowed in April 1913, and died in York, Western Australia on 14 January 1921. See also * French Australian References * * Erickson (1979) is primarily about Edward Hamersley Snr.

Among the acts he discovered were the Crows, Frankie Lymon and the Teenagers, and Little Anthony and the Imperials. He established (or helped establish) a number of record labels, including Tico, Rama, Gee, Roulette, End, Gone, and Red Bird. It was said of him that he \\"discovered more talent, both in front of the microphone and behind the scenes, than most producers get to record in a lifetime.. Moreover, in the decades since, much of the music that Goldner recorded and released has retained an astonishing appeal to generations of listeners\\". Early life Goldner was born to a Jewish family in 1918 to a mother Rose originally from Poland and father Adolph from Austria. He and his two sisters grew up in the Turtle Bay neighborhood of the east side of New York City, and he attended Peter Stuyvesant High School. While still in school he worked weekends as a waiter at the Shelton Hotel, where his father also worked while acquiring furnished brownstones. Goldner later worked in the garment business, before opening a chain of dance halls in New York and New Jersey. Biography by Bruce Eder, Allmusic.com. Retrieved 24 June 2014David Edwards and Mike Callahan, The George Goldner Story, 2009. Retrieved 6 April 2020 Latin music and Tico Records Goldner's dance clubs thrived in the late 1940s during the craze for Latin music, a style that Goldner loved. In 1948, he established his first record label, Tico Records, named after the song \\"Tico-Tico\\". The company recorded and distributed music by such artists as Tito Puente, Joe Loco and Machito, becoming the most important Latin music label and helping to integrate the music into mainstream pop, especially through mambo music. R&B; and rock 'n' roll Finding that increasing numbers of African-American patrons were visiting his clubs, Goldner decided in 1953 to start a new label, Rama, to record jazz, vocal group and R&B; music. One of his earliest records on the label was \\"Gee\\" by The Crows. The record soon rose to the top of the R&B; chart, but - to the surprise of Goldner and others - was also bought by white teenagers, who were increasingly listening to hitherto \\"black\\" radio stations, and rose to #14 on the pop chart as well. This crossover success, as \\"the first R&B; single to get a significant part of its sales and chart success from purchases by white teenagers\\", has led to some describing it as \\"the first rock and roll record\\". Because radio stations would play only a few records from each label, Goldner also set up Gee Records, and found some success immediately with the Cleftones. He also recruited Richard Barrett, lead singer of another doo-wop group, the Valentines, as his production assistant. They mostly worked at the Bell recording studios in Manhattan. Although Goldner could not read music, he had an ear for rock and roll, and acted as the producer of most recordings on his labels. Jerry Leiber said that he had the taste of a fourteen-year-old girl, and that, as far as sales and promotion went, Goldner was a master. In promoting his records, he sometimes gave gratuities or paid DJs at radio stations, to give consideration to his companies' records. This practice, which came to be known as payola, was widespread.Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller, Hound Dog, The Leiber and Stoller Autobiography, Simon & Schuster New York, 2009, , pp.198-206 According to one source: George Goldner, at Black Cat Rockabilly: adapted from the entry for Goldner in The Encyclopedia of Record Producers, by Eric Olsen et al., Billboard Books, 1999. Retrieved 24 June 2014 > \\"In the studio, Goldner and his right-hand man Richard Barrett... had multi- > faceted jobs: find the right key and \\"groove\\" for a song; collaborate with > the musicians to create a \\"head\\" arrangement; encourage and control the > young, often inexperienced singers during their maiden visits to the > recording studio; oversee the vocal balance by placing the singers at the > proper distance from the microphone; keep an eagle eye on the clock > (sessions were traditionally three hours in length, after which overtime > kicked in); and, most importantly, recognize the magical \\"best take\\" that > would ultimately click with the record-buying teenagers.\\" Goldner signed and recorded Frankie Lymon and the Teenagers, whose song \\"Why Do Fools Fall in Love\\" also became a crossover hit in early 1956, this time also becoming an international success. By then, Goldner - who was an inveterate gambler and frequently needed to pay off his debts - had sold half of his share of the Tico, Rama and Gee labels to Joe Kolsky, an associate of club owner and juke box distributor Morris Levy, who reportedly had links to the Mafia. Goldner also started the Luniverse label with Bill Buchanan and Dickie Goodman, to release novelty records. In 1956 its first release, \\"The Flying Saucer\\", pioneered the idea of \\"break-in\\" or \\"mashup\\" records, featuring segments of popular songs intertwined with spoken \\"news\\" commentary, and sold over a million copies. In January 1957, Goldner, Kolsky and Levy formed Roulette Records, but shortly afterwards Goldner sold his interest in the company, as well as his remaining interests in Tico, Rama, and Gee, to Levy. In their place, he started two more new labels, End and Gone, both distributed by Morris Levy's Roulette organization. Both labels provided hits for doo-wop groups. The End label saw success with \\"He's Gone\\" and \\"Maybe\\" by the Chantels; \\"Tears on My Pillow\\" by Little Anthony and the Imperials; and, in 1959, \\"I Only Have Eyes For You\\" by the Flamingos. The first release on Gone, \\"Don't Ask Me To Be Lonely\\" by the Dubs, was also a hit, and the label had further hits with Ral Donner. Goldner also recorded the Isley Brothers, the Four Seasons and Johnny Rivers on Gone. In 1958, Goldner hired a young Artie Ripp, (who went on establish his own record labels and was the first to sign and produce Billy Joel as a solo act), as his \\"gofer\\". Goldner taught Ripp his practices regarding how to create and distribute music, including how to structure a record contract, how to work a studio, and how to get a record on the radio. By the early 1960s, Goldner had sold his End and Gone labels to Levy, and worked for a time as a record producer at Roulette. Red Bird Records and later life Goldner's last successful label, Red Bird Records (which had a subsidiary, Blue Cat Records) was actually co-founded by Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller. Goldner became a partner in the company, promoting Red Bird releases, while Leiber and Stoller worked on production. The company was successful, producing hits for the Dixie Cups, the Shangri-Las, and the Ad-Libs. However, the label lasted just two years, as Leiber and Stoller wanted out of the record business, either due to creative differences, or once Goldner's gambling debts again led to Morris Levy's involvement. After an abortive attempt to merge it with Atlantic Records, Leiber and Stoller sold their interest in Red Bird Records to Goldner in 1966 for $1, by which time Goldner's uncontrolled gambling habit had placed the label under the control of the Mafia. Goldner's final venture was to form the short-lived Firebird label in early 1970. Death Goldner died of a heart attack on April 15, 1970, at age 52.

Sampled data reconstruction filters The sampling theorem describes why the input of an ADC requires a low-pass analog electronic filter, called the anti-aliasing filter: the sampled input signal must be bandlimited to prevent aliasing (here meaning waves of higher frequency being recorded as a lower frequency). For the same reason, the output of a DAC requires a low-pass analog filter, called a reconstruction filter - because the output signal must be bandlimited, to prevent imaging (meaning Fourier coefficients being reconstructed as spurious high-frequency 'mirrors'). This is an implementation of the Whittaker‚ÄìShannon interpolation formula. Ideally, both filters should be brickwall filters, constant phase delay in the pass-band with constant flat frequency response, and zero response from the Nyquist frequency. This can be achieved by a filter with a 'sinc' impulse response.  Implementation  While in theory a DAC outputs a series of discrete Dirac impulses, in practice, a real DAC outputs pulses with finite bandwidth and width. Both idealized Dirac pulses, zero- order held steps and other output pulses, if unfiltered, would contain spurious high-frequency replicas, \\"or images\\" of the original bandlimited signal. Thus, the reconstruction filter smooths the waveform to remove image frequencies (copies) above the Nyquist limit. In doing so, it reconstructs the continuous time signal (whether originally sampled, or modelled by digital logic) corresponding to the digital time sequence. Practical filters have non- flat frequency or phase response in the pass band and incomplete suppression of the signal elsewhere. The ideal sinc waveform has an infinite response to a signal, in both the positive and negative time directions, which is impossible to perform in real time ‚Äì as it would require infinite delay. Consequently, real reconstruction filters typically either allow some energy above the Nyquist rate, attenuate some in-band frequencies, or both. For this reason, oversampling may be used to ensure that frequencies of interest are accurately reproduced without excess energy being emitted out of band. In systems that have both, the anti-aliasing filter and a reconstruction filter may be of identical design. For example, both the input and the output for audio equipment may be sampled at 44.1 kHz. In this case, both audio filters block as much as possible above 22 kHz and pass as much as possible below 20 kHz. Alternatively, a system may have no reconstruction filter and simply tolerate some energy being wasted reproducing higher frequency images of the primary signal spectrum.  Image processing  In image processing, digital reconstruction filters are used both to recreate images from samples as in medical imaging (Project webpage) and for resampling. A number of comparisons have been made, by various criteria; one observation is that reconstruction can be improved if the derivative of the signal is also known, in addition to the amplitude, and conversely that also performing derivative reconstruction can improve signal reconstruction methods. Resampling may be referred to as decimation or interpolation, accordingly as the sampling rate decreases or increases ‚Äì as in sampling and reconstruction generally, the same criteria generally apply in both cases, and thus the same filter can be used. For resampling, in principle the analog image is reconstructed, then sampled, and this is necessary for general changes in resolution. For integer ratios of sampling rate, one may simplify by sampling the impulse response of the continuous reconstruction filter to produce a discrete resampling filter, then using the discrete resampling filter to directly resample the image. For decimation by an integer amount, only a single sampled filter is necessary; for interpolation by an integer amount, different samplings are needed for different phases ‚Äì for instance, if one is upsampling by a factor of 4, then one sampled filter is used for the half-way point, while a different sampled filter is used for the point 1/4 of the way from one point to another. A subtlety in image processing is that (linear) signal processing assumes linear luminance ‚Äì that doubling a pixel value doubles the luminance of the output. However, images are frequently gamma encoded, notably in the sRGB color space, so luminance is not linear. Thus to apply a linear filter, one must first gamma decode the values ‚Äì and if resampling, one must gamma decode, resample, then gamma encode.  Common filters  The most common day-to-day filters are:dpreview: Interpolation, by Vincent Bockaert * nearest-neighbor interpolation, with kernel the box filter ‚Äì for downsampling, this corresponding to averaging; * bilinear interpolation, with kernel the tent filter; * bicubic interpolation, with kernel a cubic spline ‚Äì this latter has a free parameter, with each value of the parameter yielding a different interpolation filter. These are in increasing order of stopband suppression (anti-aliasing), and decreasing speed For reconstruction purposes, a variety of kernels are used, many of which can be interpreted as approximating the sinc function, either by windowing or by giving a spline approximation, either by cubics or higher order splines. In the case of windowed sinc filters, the frequency response of the reconstruction filter can be understood in terms of the frequency response of the window, as the frequency response of a windowed filter is the convolution of the original response (for sinc, a brick-wall) with the frequency response of the window. Among these, the Lanczos window and Kaiser window are frequently praised. Another class of reconstruction filters include the Gaussian for various widths, or cardinal B-splines of higher order ‚Äì the box filter and tent filter being the 0th and 1st order cardinal B-splines. These filters fail to be interpolating filters, since their impulse response do not vanish at all non-zero original sample points ‚Äì for 1:1 resampling, they are not the identity, but rather blur. On the other hand, being nonnegative, they do not introduce any overshoot or ringing artifacts, and by being wider in the time domain they can be narrower in the frequency domain (by the Fourier uncertainty principle), though at the cost of blurring, which is reflected in passband roll-off (\\"scalloping\\"). In photography, a great variety of interpolation filters exist,Digital Photo Interpolation Review some proprietary, for which opinions are mixed. Evaluation is often subjective, with reactions being varied, and some arguing that at realistic resampling ratios, there is little difference between them, as compared with bicubic,Interpolation -- Part I, Ron Bigelow though for higher resampling ratios behavior is more varied. Wavelet reconstruction filters Reconstruction filters are also used when \\"reconstructing\\" a waveform or an image from a collection of wavelet coefficients. In medical imaging, a common technique is to use a number of 2D X-ray photos or MRI scans to \\"reconstruct\\" a 3D image. * Reconstruction algorithm * Iterative reconstruction  See also  * Signal reconstruction * Signal processing References Category:Digital signal processing Category:Linear filters Category:Electronic filter applications ","title":"Reconstruction filter"},{"id":"1875250","text":"The Berberidaceae are a family of 18 genera of flowering plants commonly called the barberry family.

Mahonia is very closely related to Berberis, and included in it by many botanists. However, recent DNA-based phylogenetic research has reinstated Mahonia, though with a handful of species transferred into the newly-described genera Alloberberis (formerly Mahonia section Horridae) and Moranothamnus (formerly Mahonia claireae). Species of Mahonia and Berberis can be hybridised, with the hybrids being classified in the genus √ó Mahoberberis. Diphyllaea is closely related to or perhaps embedded within Podophyllum. Instead of the current trend to subdivide Podophyllum into three genera (Podophyllum, plus Dysosma and Sinopodophyllum), inclusion of Diphyllaea in a larger Podophyllum is equally warranted.

It is the first game in Tecmo's Monster Rancher series, featuring the raising, fighting, and breeding of monsters. A remaster of the game was released in Japan for iOS and Android on November 28, 2019, and for Nintendo Switch on December 19, 2019. Gameplay Although it is possible to acquire a monster in-game, the series is known for the ability to acquire new monsters using Compact Discs (CDs). Players can use any readable CD, and the game creates a monster using the CD's metadata. Certain CDs would result in unique monsters: for example, some Christmas music albums will give the player a monster of type \\"Santa\\". Once the player has two or more monsters in reserve, they can be combined, creating a new monster with traits of both 'parents'. There are twelve basic types of monsters that can be combined, as well as eight special types players can receive as rewards by completing tasks or inserting a CD into the PlayStation. The common types are Dinos, Golems, Suezos, Hares, Tigers, Galis, Monols, Worms, Nagas, Jells, Pixies, and Plants. The rare types are Dragons, Magics, Apes, Ghosts, Hengers, Doodles, Nyas, and Disks. Monsters can be combined to create a new monster with a main type and a sub-type which are determined randomly. Once the player has a monster, it can then be raised to fight other monsters. There are six stats that determine how the monster does in battle: Power fuels physical attacks, Intelligence fuels and defends against energy attacks, Life determines monster's hit points, Skill affects accuracy, Speed helps evade opponents' attacks, and Defense reduces damage received from physical attacks. Monsters train either by doing chores nearby, or can be sent to be trained by experts, where they have the chance to gain new attack techniques. It is possible to increase some of the monster's stats with food or vitamins, but vitamins comes at a price of decreasing one stat as well as shorting the life span dramatically. Currency can be used to purchase items in the game, earned by winning monster fighting tournaments. The game can end if the player runs out of currency to manage the monster. The primary way to advance through the game is through monster fighting tournaments. While in battle, each monster has attacks available to it, some moves are only available at close range, others from a distance. Players cannot control the monster directly in a fight, but can call for their monster to stay away or close in, and attack with whichever move is available at the current range. In Monster Rancher 2 and Monster Rancher Advance 2, Holly, the assistant from this game, cameos as a rancher from the group, AGIMA, for whom the player trains monsters. Reception The game received \\"favorable\\" reviews according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. Next Generation called it \\"an addictive yet time-consuming title that deserves to attract a whole new and greatful [sic] audience to the narrow niche of life sim gaming.\\" In Japan, Famitsu gave it a score of 31 out of 40. The game was a hit in Japan, with domestic sales above 500,000 units by early December 1997. At the time, GameSpot reported that it was \\"enjoying brisk sales\\" in the United States as well.

Barb√©, Tous les pr√©noms (died 10 May, c. 880The tenth of May is the day she is venerated; the year is an approximation.) was a Frankish shepherdess and a locally venerated Christian saint and cephalophore, whose cult is restricted to Sainte-Solange, Cher. Saint Solange was the patron of the traditional Province of Berry, of which Cher is a part. Solange was born to a poor but devout family in the town of Villemont, near Bourges, and consecrated her virginity at the age of seven; according to some, her mere presence cured the sick and exorcised devils. The son of the count of PoitiersA name for him, Bernard de la Gothie, or Bernard of Gothia, refers to a Carolingian name for Septimania. was highly taken with the beauty and popularity of Solange and approached her when she was tending to her sheep, but she rejected his suit. He argued with her to no avail, and so he decided to abduct her. At night, he came and took Solange by force, but she struggled so violently that she fell from his horse while he was crossing a stream. Her abductor grew enraged and beheaded her with his sword. According to the fully-developed legend, Solange's severed head invoked three times the Holy Name of Jesus, and like Saint Denis and other saints in Gaulish territories, Solange picked up her head in her own hands and walked with it as far as the church of Saint-Martin in the village of Saint-Martin-du-Crot (which now bears the name of Sainte-Solange, the only commune in France to bear this name), only dropping truly dead there.Sainte Solange\\"Sainte Solange, berg√®re...\\" Veneration Immediately, a cult surrounding her grew up. Many miraculous cures were attributed to her intercession. In 1281, an altar was erected in her honor at that church, and it preserved her severed head as a relic and began to call itself the church of St. Solange, while a nearby field where she had prayed began to be referred to as the \\"Field of St. Solange\\". It was a habit of the locals, in times of great stress, to form a procession through Bourges with the reliquary head before them and to invoke her against drought. Solange's feast day in the Roman Catholic Church is May 10. File:Sainte-Solange (CHer, Fr), l'√©glise.JPGChurch of St. Solange. Sainte- Solange, Cher, France.

The team achieved their greatest success in World Championship Wrestling (WCW), where they won the WCW World Tag Team Championship a record ten times. Kevin Powers of WWE remarked: \\"When debating the greatest tag team in WCW history, Harlem Heat and The Steiner Brothers are more or less interchangeable.\\" Harlem Heat was inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame on April 6, 2019 as part of the 2019 class.  History = The Ebony Experience  Booker T and Stevie Ray started to team together as The Huffman Brothers in Ivan Putski's Western Wrestling Alliance after a brief feud with each other. Soon after, the WWA ceased operating and the brothers started touring the Texas Independent circuit until they caught the eye of Skandor Akbar who was involved with the Global Wrestling Federation out of Dallas in 1992. The brothers were repackaged as The Ebony Experience and quickly rose through the ranks of the GWF tag team division under the guidance of Gary Hart, defeating Skandor Akbar's \\"Goodfellows\\" (\\"Gorgeous\\" Gary Young and Steve Dane) for the GWF Tag Team Championship on July 31, 1992. Their first run with the GWF tag title lasted only a week before they were defeated by The Blackbirds (‚ÄùIceman‚Äù King Parsons and Action Jackson). Booker and Stevie Ray made a comeback and defeated the cheating birds in September. The second run with the title lasted a bit longer than a week but was ultimately short lived as the Rough Riders (Black Bart and Johnny Mantell) won the gold on October 23. The title loss was forced due to Booker T suffering a knee injury that needed surgery and time off to recover. In early 1993 the Ebony Experience returned to action and started to chase The Bad Breed (Axl and Ian Rotten) who had won the titles while Booker T recovered. On February 26 the Ebony Experience won their third GWF Tag Team championship, becoming the only team to hold that title three times. Their third run with the title proved to be their longest as they held them until May 7 where Guido Falcone and Vito Mussolini (known as The Sicilian Stallions) defeated them for the titles. Not long after this Booker T and Stevie Ray left the GWF, having signed with World Championship Wrestling (WCW).  Harlem Heat  In August 1993, the brothers debuted in WCW as the tag team Harlem Heat, with Booker renamed Kole and Lash renamed Kane. They were then billed from Harlem. Originally, they were supposed to be a pair of wrestling prisoners won in a card game by manager Col. Rob Parker, but was changed due to racial sensitivity based on their look, coming out to the ring in wrist and foot shackles. They became heels and teamed with Vader and Sid Vicious in the War Games at Fall Brawl on September 19, 1993, against Sting, Davey Boy Smith, Dustin Rhodes, and The Shockmaster. They lost the match but were over as heels because of the caliber of faces they wrestled. Sister Sherri began managing the team in 1994 and changed their names back to Booker T and Stevie Ray, at their request. By the end of 1994, they were already Tag Team Champions, having defeated Stars and Stripes (The Patriot and Marcus Alexander Bagwell) in December, en route to a five-month title reign. This would be their first of ten WCW World Tag Team Championship reigns together. After dropping the title to the Nasty Boys, Harlem Heat regained the belts on June 24, 1995. Harlem Heat became tweeners and entered a feud with Col. Parker's Stud Stable of \\"Dirty\\" Dick Slater and Bunkhouse Buck, eventually dropping the titles to them on an episode of Saturday Night on July 22, 1995, thanks to interference from Parker. Parker and Sherri were carrying on a love affair and Parker eventually left the Stud Stable in favor of the Heat to be with Sherri. Harlem Heat regained the WCW World Tag Team titles from Slater and Buck at Fall Brawl 1995. Their third title only lasted one day, but the duo regained the tag team title nine days later from the American Males (Marcus Alexander Bagwell and Scotty Riggs). On the June 24, 1996 Nitro, Harlem Heat defeated Lex Luger and Sting to capture their fifth WCW World Tag Team titles. Three days after losing the tag team titles to the Steiner Brothers, Harlem Heat regained the straps from the Steiners on July 27, 1996. On September 23, 1996 Booker T and Stevie Ray were defeated by Public Enemy (Rocco Rock and Johnny Grunge) but took the titles back for the seventh time on October 1, 1996. After the loss of their seventh WCW World Tag Team Championship, to The Outsiders (Kevin Nash and Scott Hall) on October 27, 1996 they became full-fledged faces when they fired Col. Parker and beat him up. They briefly feuded against Parker's newest team The Amazing French Canadians, a feud they would win. In 1997, they feuded with Public Enemy, The Steiners, and the nWo. On the July 7, 1997 Nitro, they fired Sherri and added a new manager, Jacqueline, on the September 15 Nitro. They were briefly put out of action by the nWo, but returned to feud with the Faces of Fear (Meng and The Barbarian). Stevie then took five months off from WCW to recover from an ankle injury and Jacqueline left for the WWF while Booker made a transition to singles competition. Booker managed to win the WCW World Television Championship during Stevie's absence. Upon his return to WCW, Stevie Ray joined the New World Order, while Booker continued to be a rising singles star. Despite being on opposite sides they managed to peacefully co-exist (despite Booker expressing dismay at Stevie for joining the nWo). By mid-1999, Booker was able to convince his brother to leave the nWo and reunited Harlem Heat once more. The two defeated Bam Bam Bigelow and Kanyon for their record- breaking eighth WCW World Tag Team championships at the 1999 Road Wild but lost them to Barry and Kendall Windham. Harlem Heat would defeat them about a month later at the 1999 Fall Brawl for the WCW World Tag Team titles. When The Filthy Animals were stripped of the WCW World Tag Team belts due to an injury suffered by Rey Mysterio Jr., the title was put up in a three-way dance at Halloween Havoc 1999. Harlem Heat claimed their tenth WCW World Tag Team title defeating members of The First Family (Hugh Morrus and Brian Knobs) and the Filthy Animals (Konnan and Billy Kidman).  Harlem Heat 2000  In late 1999, a female bodybuilder named Midnight joined Harlem Heat. While Booker T liked the addition, Stevie Ray neglected her help and started arguing with Booker T. Ray eventually challenged Midnight in a match that would decide whether she would stay with Harlem Heat. After being defeated with a surprise small package, Stevie Ray turned on both Booker T and Midnight. In February, 2000 Stevie Ray formed Harlem Heat, Inc. with Big T, Kash (formerly known as 4x4 from The No Limit Soldiers) and J. Biggs. Stevie Ray and Big T referred to themselves as Harlem Heat 2000. Booker T lost the rights to his music and the \\"T\\" in his name, as it was owned by Harlem Heat and was referred to simply as Booker. Harlem Heat 2000 won the rights to the Harlem Heat name when Big T pinned Booker on February 20, 2000 at SuperBrawl 2000, and also the rights to use the \\"Rap Sheet\\" theme, as he used a cartoonish theme called \\"The Woodchuck's Game\\". Kidman and Booker defeated Harlem Heat 2000 (Stevie Ray and Big T) at Uncensored.  The Final Heat  On February 21, 2015, Booker T and Stevie Ray reunited as Harlem Heat for one last match at Booker T's promotion, Reality of Wrestling's The Final Heat event, where they defeated The New Heavenly Bodies for the ROW Tag Team Championship.

Biography=Early years Victor Perlo was born May 15, 1912 in East Elmhurst, Queens, New York City, N.Y. Perlo was the son of ethnic Jewish parents who had both emigrated in their youth to America from the Russian empire.Autobiography prepared by Perlo and relayed in summary form to Moscow in December 1944 by KGB Washington Station Chief Anatoly Gorsky, KGB file 45100, v. 1, pp. 44-45; transcribed in Vassiliev White Notebook #3, pp. 72-73 and published in John Earl Haynes, Harvey Klehr, and Alexander Vassiliev, Spies: The Rise and Fall of the KGB in America. New Haven, CT: Yale University Press, 2009; pp. 271-272. His father, Samuel Perlo, was a lawyer and his mother, Rachel Perlo, was a teacher. Perlo received his Bachelor's degree from Columbia University in New York City in 1931 and Master's degree in mathematics from the same school in 1933.Victor Perlo, August 9, 1948 testimony, Hearings Regarding Communist Espionage in the United States Government (Alger Hiss Case), Part 1, Committee on Un-American Activities, US House of Representatives. Washington: US Government Printing Office, 1948; pg. 699. Late in 1932 or early in 1933, while still a student at Columbia, Perlo joined the Communist Party USA, an organization with which he was affiliated throughout his life. Perlo married his first wife, Katherine, in 1933 and divorced in 1943. Subsequently, he married his second wife, Ellen (whose uncle was Robert Menaker), with whom he remained for the rest of his life. The couple had three children, a girl and two boys.Joseph B. Treaster, \\"Victor Perlo, 87, Economist For Communist Party in US,\\" New York Times, December 10, 1999. Perlo had varied interests, which included tennis, mountain climbing, and chess. He was also a talented pianist. Governmental career After his graduation from Columbia in 1933, Perlo went to work as a statistical analyst and assistant to a division chief at the National Recovery Administration (NRA), remaining at that post until June 1935. Perlo then moved to the Federal Home Loan Bank Board where he was an analyst for the Home Owners' Loan Corporation, establishing statistical analyses for properties mortgaged to the corporation and projecting long term financial accounts.Perlo, August 9, 1948 HUAC testimony, pg. 679. Perlo worked in that capacity until October 1937. In October 1937, Perlo left government service to work in the Brookings Institution, a liberal think tank established in 1916, where he stayed as a researcher for more than two years. In November 1939, Perlo went to work in the US Department of Commerce, where he worked as a senior economic analyst in the Bureau of Foreign and Domestic Commerce. Perlo moved to the Office of Price Administration (OPA) in November 1940, where he was head of the economic statistics division. There Perlo engaged in the study of inflationary pressures in the American economy, particularly with the advent of World War II, which helped provide documentation enabling the institution of price controls. Perlo remained in that capacity until leaving to become head of the aviation section of the Bureau of Programs and Statistics at the War Production Board (WPB). Perlo's work at the WPB involved analysis of the various economic problems of aircraft production.Perlo, August 9, 1948 HUAC testimony, pg. 680. In September 1944 he was made a special assistant to the director of the Bureau of Programs and Statistics of the WPB. During his time in the federal bureaucracy, Perlo was a contributor to the Communist Party's press, submitting articles on economic matters under a variety of pseudonyms. He also secretly assisted I.F. Stone in gathering materials for various journalistic expos√©s. About December 1945, Perlo went to the U.S. Treasury Department, where he worked in the Monetary Research department.Perlo, August 9, 1948 HUAC testimony, pg. 681. There he was an alternate member of the Committee for Reciprocity Information, which took care of technical work relating to trade agreements under the Reciprocal Trade Agreement Act and doing preparatory work for the International Trade Organization. Perlo left government service in 1947, when his loyalty was called into question during an investigation by the House Unamerican Activities Committee. Perlo denied allegations that he had spied for the Soviet Union.Perlo, August 9, 1948 HUAC testimony, pg. 683. Espionage career A dedicated Communist, Victor Perlo allegedly headed the Perlo group of Soviet espionage agents in the United States. Before World War II, Perlo had been a member of the Ware spy ring. The Perlo ring included several important U.S. officials, including a Senate staff director, and the ring supplied the Soviet Union with economic, political, and military intelligence, including United States aircraft production figures. Perlo infiltrated through the United States Department of Commerce in 1938 to gather economic intelligence, and passed on intelligence concerning basic economic decisions he presented to Harry Hopkins, Secretary of Commerce. He transferred to the Division of Monetary Research, and served under Harry Dexter White, followed by Frank Coe and Harold Glasser, all of whom were later found to be Soviet agents. Career after government In 1948, Perlo obtained a position as an economist for the Progressive Party, assisting the Presidential campaign of former U.S. Secretary of Agriculture and Vice President Henry Wallace.Perlo, August 9, 1948 HUAC testimony, pg. 678. Following the publication of his book Economics of Racism, Victor Perlo received the Myers Center award for his exceptional work on intolerance in North America.http://www.frostburg.edu/lewis-ort- library/aboutlib/depts/arch/perlo/perlobio/ In 1968, he signed the \\"Writers and Editors War Tax Protest\\" pledge, vowing to refuse tax payments in protest against the Vietnam War.\\"Writers and Editors War Tax Protest\\" January 30, 1968 New York Post Death and legacy He died on December 1, 1999 at his home in Croton-on-Hudson, New York.

Biography He was born in Springfield, Missouri on August 14, 1908. He attended Drury College (now Drury University), and graduated from Harvard Business School with an MBA in 1935. Ulmann then took a job with the National Recovery Administration. There he met Greg and Helen Silvermaster. The three jointly bought a house in 1938. In 1937 Ullman transferred to the Resettlement Administration (which became the Farm Security Administration). In 1939 Ulmann was recommended by his superior C. B. Baldwin to Harry Dexter White and was hired at the Division of Monetary Research in the United States Department of the Treasury. His immediate supervisor in his new post was Frank Coe. By 1941 Ullmann had become White's administrative assistant. Ullmann worked in the Treasury until he was drafted into World War II 1942. He then obtained a commission in the Army Air Force and through George Silverman was assigned to the Pentagon. He was \\"chief photographer of stolen government documents for the Silvermaster espionage ring\\" while a Major in the Material and Services Division of the Army Air Corps. Among the information Ullmann supplied to Soviet intelligence were: aircraft production figures, allocation and deployment of aircraft, results of aircraft testing, reports on the efficiency of particular types of planes, technological developments in aircraft manufacture, statistics regarding high octane gasoline, personal data regarding important Air Force officers, opinions of aircraft personnel on other nations, Army gossip, all pertinent developments concerning planning, construction and actual completion of the B-29 Superfortress, proposed movements of the planes when they were completed, the approximate schedule of D Day, copies of directives issued to General George Marshall, and information concerning production, allocation and development of tanks, guns and motorized equipment. He provided the Soviets with a considerable volume of almost every conceivable type of information relating to the United States Army Air Force's part in World War II. In the basement of the Silvermaster and Ullmann home, Ullmann maintained a photographic darkroom for copying and processing stolen documents and reducing them to microfilm. The volume of information eventually became so overwhelming that only negatives were completed because Ullman could not process the stolen documents fast enough. The information was then passed on through Elizabeth Bentley. Kathryn S. Olmsted, the author of Red Spy Queen (2002), points out: \\"Every two weeks, Elizabeth would travel to Washington to pick up documents from the Silvermasters, collect their Party dues, and deliver Communist literature. Soon the flow of documents grew so large that Ullmann, an amateur photographer, set up a darkroom in their basement. Elizabeth usually collected at least two or three rolls of microfilmed secret documents, and one time received as many as forty. She would stuff all the film and documents into a knitting bag or other innocent feminine accessory, then take it back to New York on the train.\\" Kathryn S. Olmsted, Red Spy Queen (2002) page 46 Moscow complained that around half of the photographed documents received in the summer of 1944 were unreadable and suggested that Ullmann should receive more training. However, Pavel Fitin, who was responsible for analyzing the material, described it as very important data. After his discharge in 1943, he returned to the Treasury Department. Ullmann was a United States delegate to the United Nations Charter meeting at San Francisco and to the Bretton Woods Conference as Harry Dexter White's assistant. Ullmann was never prosecuted. He later became a real estate developer in New Jersey and died on February 3, 1993 in Beach Haven, New Jersey with an $8 million estate.Social Security Death IndexIt appears that he was living with Helen Silvermaster who also died in Beach Haven.

It is a manual condensing and systematizing the 5th century understanding and interpretation of the Buddhist path as maintained by the elders of the Mahavihara Monastery in Anuradhapura, Sri Lanka. It is considered the most important Theravada text outside of the Tipitaka canon of scriptures, and is described as \\"the hub of a complete and coherent method of exegesis of the Tipitaka,\\" but it has also been criticised for its non- canonical departures, and its interpretation of dhyana as concentration- meditation. Background=Structure The structure of the Visuddhimagga is based on the Ratha-vinita Sutta (\\"Relay Chariots Discourse,\\" MN 24), which describes the progression from the purity of discipline to the final destination of nibbana in seven steps.See Thanissaro (1999) for a translation of the Ratha-vinita Sutta. See the various Visuddhimagga printings listed below to see the manner in which this sutta is explicitly integrated into the work. The Visuddhimagga's material also strongly resembles the material found in an earlier treatise called the Vimuttimagga (c. 1st or 2nd century).Vimuttimagga & Visuddhimagga - A Comparative Study. PV Bapat, lvii Reflecting later developments The Visuddhimagga's doctrine reflects Theravada Abhidhamma scholasticism, which includes several innovations and interpretations not found in the earliest discourses (suttas) of the Buddha.Kalupahana, David J. (1994), A history of Buddhist philosophy, Delhi: Motilal Banarsidass Publishers Private Limited Buddhaghosa's Visuddhimagga includes non-canonical instructions on Theravada meditation, such as \\"ways of guarding the mental image (nimitta),\\" which point to later developments in Theravada meditation. Kasina-meditation The Visuddhimagga is centered around kasina-meditation, a form of concentration-meditation in which the mind is focused on a (mental) object.Bhikkhu Thanissaro, Concentration and Discernment According to Thanissaro Bhikkhu, \\"[t]he text then tries to fit all other meditation methods into the mold of kasina practice, so that they too give rise to countersigns, but even by its own admission, breath meditation does not fit well into the mold.\\" In its emphasis on kasina-meditation, the Visuddhimagga departs from the Pali Canon, in which dhyana is the central meditative practice, indicating that what \\"jhana means in the commentaries is something quite different from what it means in the Canon.\\" Non-Theravada influences Kalupahana notes that the Visuddhimagga contains \\"some metaphysical speculations, such as those of the Sarvastivadins, the Sautrantikas, and even the Yogacarins\\". Kalupahana comments: Contents=Summary The Visuddhimagga is composed of three sections, which discuss: 1) Sƒ´la (ethics or discipline); 2) SamƒÅdhi (meditative concentration); 3) Pa√±√±a (understanding or wisdom). * The first section (part 1) explains the rules of discipline, and the method for finding a correct temple to practice, or how to meet a good teacher. * The second section (part 2) describes samatha practice, object by object (see Kammatthana for the list of the forty traditional objects). It mentions different stages of concentration. * The third section (part 3-7) is a description of the five skandhas (aggregates), ayatanas, the Four Noble Truths, dependent origination (Pratitya-samutpada), and the practice of vipassana through the development of wisdom. It emphasizes different forms of knowledge emerging because of the practice. This part shows a great analytical effort specific to Buddhist philosophy. Seven Stages of Purification This comparison between practice and \\"seven relay chariots\\" points at the goal. Each purity is needed to attain the next. They are often referred to as the \\"Seven Stages of Purification\\" (satta-visuddhi): # Purification of Conduct (sƒ´la-visuddhi) # Purification of Mind (citta- visuddhi) # Purification of View (ditthi-visuddhi) # Purification by Overcoming Doubt (kankha-vitarana-visuddhi) # Purification by Knowledge and Vision of What Is Path and Not Path (maggamagga-√±anadassana-visuddhi) # Purification by Knowledge and Vision of the Course of Practice (patipada- √±anadassana-visuddhi) ## Knowledge of contemplation of rise and fall (udayabbayanupassana-nana) ## Knowledge of contemplation of dissolution (bhanganupassana-nana) ## Knowledge of appearance as terror (bhayatupatthana- nana) ## Knowledge of contemplation of danger (adinavanupassana-nana) ## Knowledge of contemplation of dispassion (nibbidanupassana-nana) ## Knowledge of desire for deliverance (muncitukamyata-nana) ## Knowledge of contemplation of reflection (patisankhanupassana-nana) ## Knowledge of equanimity about formations (sankharupekka-nana) ## Conformity knowledge (anuloma-nana) # Purification by Knowledge and Vision (√±anadassana-visuddhi) ## Change of lineage ## The first path and fruit ## The second path and fruit ## The third path and fruit ## The fourth path and fruit The \\"Purification by Knowledge and Vision\\" is the culmination of the practice, in four stages leading to liberation and Nirvana. The emphasis in this system is on understanding the three marks of existence, dukkha, anatta, anicca. This emphasis is recognizable in the value that is given to vipassana over samatha in the contemporary vipassana movement. Siddhis According to scholars, the Visuddhimagga is one of the extremely rare texts within the enormous literatures of various forms of Jainism, Buddhism, and Hinduism to give explicit details about how spiritual masters were thought to actually manifest supernormal abilities. Abilities such as flying through the air, walking through solid obstructions, diving into the ground, walking on water and so forth are performed by changing one element, such as earth, into another element, such as air. The individual must master kasina meditation before this is possible. Dipa Ma, who trained via the Visuddhimagga, was said to demonstrate these abilities. Influence=Traditional Theravada The Visuddhimagga is considered the most important Theravada text outside of the Tipitaka canon of scriptures.See, for instance, Kheminda Thera, in Ehara et al. 1995 p. xliii: \\"The Visuddhimagga is a household word in all TheravƒÅda lands. No scholar of Buddhism whether of TheravƒÅda or of MahƒÅyƒÅna is unacquainted with it.\\"Biographical article Britannica ‚Äì June 14th, 2017 \\"...According to the various traditions of Buddhism, there have been buddhas in the past and there will be buddhas in the future. Some forms of Buddhism hold that there is only one buddha for each historical age; others hold that all beings will eventually become buddhas because they possess the buddha nature (tathagatagarbha)...\\" According to Nanamoli Bhikkhu, it is \\"the hub of a complete and coherent method of exegesis of the Tipitaka, using the ‚ÄòAbhidhamma method' as it is called. And it sets out detailed practical instructions for developing purification of mind.\\" Contemporary Theravada The Visuddhimagga is one of the main texts on which contemporary vipassana method is based, together with the Satipatthana Sutta. Yet, its emphasis on kasina-meditation and its claim of the possibility of \\"dry insight\\" has also been criticised and rejected by some contemporary Theravada scholars and vipassana-teachers. According to Thanissaro Bhikkhu, \\"the Visuddhimagga uses a very different paradigm for concentration from what you find in the Canon.\\" Bhante Henepola Gunaratana also notes that what \\"the suttas say is not the same as what the Visuddhimagga says [...] they are actually different,\\" leading to a divergence between a [traditional] scholarly understanding and a practical understanding based on meditative experience. Gunaratana further notes that Buddhaghosa invented several key meditation terms which are not to be found in the suttas, such as \\"parikamma samadhi (preparatory concentration), upacara samadhi (access concentration), appanasamadhi (absorption concentration).\\" Gunaratana also notes that the Buddhaghosa's emphasis on kasina-meditation is not to be found in the suttas, where dhyana is always combined with mindfulness. Bhikkhu Sujato has argued that certain views regarding Buddhist meditation expounded in the Visuddhimagga are a \\"distortion of the Suttas\\" since it denies the necessity of jhana. The Australian monk Shravasti Dhammika is also critical of contemporary practice based on this work. He concludes that Buddhaghosa did not believe that following the practice set forth in the Visuddhimagga will really lead him to Nirvana, basing himself on the postscript to the Visuddhimagga: See also * Buddhaghosa * Vimuttimagga * Patisambhidamagga * ≈öƒ´la * Samatha * Vipassana Editions=Printed Pali editions * Caroline A.

Pollan is best known for his books that explore the socio-cultural impacts of food, such as The Botany of Desire and The Omnivore's Dilemma. Early years Pollan was born to a Jewish family on Long Island, New York. He is the son of author and financial consultant Stephen Pollan and columnist Corky Pollan. Pollan received a B.A. in English from Bennington College in 1977 and an M.A. in English from Columbia University in 1981. Career=The Botany of Desire In The Botany of Desire, Pollan explores the concept of co-evolution, specifically of humankind's evolutionary relationship with four plants‚Äîapples, tulips, marijuana, and potatoes‚Äîfrom the dual perspectives of humans and the plants. He uses case examples that fit the archetype of four basic human desires, demonstrating how each of these botanical species are selectively grown, bred, and genetically engineered. The apple reflects the desire for sweetness, the tulip for beauty, marijuana for intoxication, and the potato for control. Throughout the book, Pollan explores the narrative of his own experience with each of the plants, which he then intertwines with a well-researched exploration into their social history. Each section presents a unique element of human domestication, or the \\"human bumblebee\\" as Pollan calls it. These range from the true story of Johnny Appleseed to Pollan's first-hand research with sophisticated marijuana hybrids in Amsterdam, to the alarming and paradigm-shifting possibilities of genetically engineered potatoes. The Omnivore's Dilemma In The Omnivore's Dilemma, Pollan describes four basic ways that human societies have obtained food: the current industrial system, the big organic operation, the local self-sufficient farm, and the hunter-gatherer. Pollan follows each of these processes‚Äîfrom a group of plants photosynthesizing calories through a series of intermediate stages, ultimately into a meal. Along the way, he suggests that there is a fundamental tension between the logic of nature and the logic of human industry, that the way we eat represents our most profound engagement with the natural world, and that industrial eating obscures crucially important ecological relationships and connections. On December 10, 2006, The New York Times named The Omnivore's Dilemma one of the five best nonfiction books of the year. On May 8, 2007, the James Beard Foundation named The Omnivore's Dilemma its 2007 winner for the best food writing. It was the book of focus for the University of Pennsylvania's Reading Project in 2007, and the book of choice for Washington State University's Common Reading Program in 2009‚Äì10. Michael Pollan speaks to the Marin Academy community. Pollan's discussion of the industrial food chain is in large part a critique of modern agribusiness. According to the book, agribusiness has lost touch with the natural cycles of farming, wherein livestock and crops intertwine in mutually beneficial circles. Pollan's critique of modern agribusiness focuses on what he describes as the overuse of corn for purposes ranging from fattening cattle to massive production of corn oil, high-fructose corn syrup, and other corn derivatives. He describes what he sees as the inefficiencies and other drawbacks of factory farming and gives his assessment of organic food production and what it's like to hunt and gather food. He blames those who set the rules (e.g., politicians in Washington, D.C., bureaucrats at the United States Department of Agriculture, Wall Street capitalists, and agricultural conglomerates like Archer Daniels Midland) of what he calls a destructive and precarious agricultural system that has wrought havoc upon the diet, nutrition, and well-being of Americans. Pollan finds hope in Joel Salatin's Polyface Farm in Virginia, which he sees as a model of sustainability in commercial farming. Pollan appears in the documentary film King Corn (2007). In Defense of Food: An Eater's Manifesto TED in 2007 Pollan's book In Defense of Food: An Eater's Manifesto, released on January 1, 2008, explores the relationship with what he terms nutritionism and the Western diet, with a focus on late 20th century food advice given by the science community. Pollan holds that consumption of fat and dietary cholesterol does not lead to a higher rate of coronary disease, and that the reductive analysis of food into nutrient components is a mistake. Throughout the book, Pollan questions the view that the point of eating is to promote health, pointing out that this attitude is not universal and that cultures that perceive food as having purposes of pleasure, identity, and sociality may end up with better health. He explains this seeming paradox by vetting, and then validating, the notion that nutritionism and, therefore, the whole Western framework through which we intellectualize the value of food is more a religious and faddish devotion to the mythology of simple solutions than a convincing and reliable conclusion of incontrovertible scientific research. Pollan spends the rest of his book explicating his first three phrases: \\"Eat food. Not too much. Mostly plants.\\" He contends that most of what Americans now buy in supermarkets, fast food stores, and restaurants is not in fact food, and that a practical tip is to eat only those things that people of his grandmother's generation would have recognized as food. Food Rules: An Eater's Manual In 2009, Food Rules: An Eater's Manual was published. This short work is a condensed version of his previous efforts, intended to provide a simple framework for a healthy and sustainable diet. It is divided into three sections, further explicating Pollan's principles of \\"Eat food. Not too much. Mostly plants.\\" It includes his rules (i.e., \\"let others sample your food\\" and \\"the whiter the bread, the sooner you'll be dead\\"). Cooked: A Natural History of Transformation In Cooked: A Natural History of Transformation, published in 2013, Pollan explores the methods by which cooks mediate \\"between nature and culture.\\" The book is organized into four sections corresponding to the classical elements of Fire (cooking with heat), Water (braising and boiling with pots), Air (breadmaking), and Earth (fermenting). The book also features Samin Nosrat, who later became known for the bestselling cookbook Salt, Fat, Acid, Heat, and as \\"the chef who taught Michael Pollan how to cook.\\" How to Change Your Mind In 2018, Pollan wrote How to Change Your Mind, a book about the history and future of psychedelic drugs. He argues that psilocybin and LSD are not drugs that make people crazy, which he calls the biggest misconception people have about psychedelics, but rather drugs that can help a person become \\"more sane\\" by, for example, eliminating a fear of death. While promoting his book on TV, he explained that along with LSD and psilocybin, his research included ingesting ayahuasca and 5-MeO-DMT, and that he experienced a dissolution of ego.Michael Pollan On The Healing Power Of Psychedelics (Time, posted to YouTube on May 18, 2018)Michael Pollan Tried A Series Of Psychedelic Drugs... For Research! (The Late Show with Stephen Colbert, posted to YouTube on May 15, 2018) Other work Pollan is a contributing writer for the New York Times Magazine and a former executive editor for Harper's Magazine. His first book, Second Nature: A Gardener's Education, was published in 1991. Pollan has contributed to Greater Good, a social psychology magazine published by the Greater Good Science Center at the University of California, Berkeley. His article \\"Edible Ethics\\" discusses the intersection of ethical eating and social psychology. In his 1998 book A Place of My Own: The Education of an Amateur Builder, Pollan methodically traced the design and construction of the out-building where he writes. The 2008 re-release of this book was re-titled A Place of My Own: The Architecture of Daydreams. Pollan wrote and narrated an audiobook, Caffeine: How Caffeine Created the Modern World, for Audible.com In 2014, Pollan wrote the foreword in the healthy eating cookbook The Pollan Family Table. The book is co-authored by his mother, Corky Pollan, and sisters, Lori Pollan, Dana Pollan, and Tracy Pollan. Pollan also co-starred in the documentary, Food, Inc. (2008), for which he was also a consultant. In 2010 Pollan was interviewed for the film Queen of the Sun: What are the bees telling us?, a feature-length documentary about honey bees and colony collapse disorder.Michael Pollan. Queen of the Sun. He was also interviewed for Vanishing of the Bees, a documentary also about colony collapse, directed by Maryam Henein and George Langworthy. In 2015, a documentary version of Pollan's book In Defense of Food premiered on PBS. In 2016, Netflix released a four-part documentary series, which was based on Pollan's book, Cooked (2013), and was directed by Alex Gibney. Recognition In 2015, Pollan received the Washburn Award from the Boston Museum of Science, awarded annually to \\"an individual who has made an outstanding contribution toward public understanding and appreciation of science and the vital role it plays in our lives\\" and was named as a fellow at Harvard University's Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study. He has also won the James Beard Leadership award, the Reuters World Conservation Union Global Awards in environmental journalism, the James Beard Foundation Awards for best magazine series in 2003, and the Genesis Award from the Humane Society of the United States. His articles have been anthologized in Best American Science Writing (2004), Best American Essays (1990 and 2003), The Animals: Practicing Complexity (2006), and the Norton Book of Nature Writing (1990). In 2008, Pollan received the Washington University International Humanities Medal. Criticisms In the American Enterprise Institute's magazine, Blake Hurst argues that Pollan offers a shallow assessment of factory farming that does not take cost into account. Daniel Engber criticized Pollan in Slate for arguing that food is too complex a subject to study scientifically and blaming reductionism for today's health ills, while using nutritional research to justify his own diet advice. Engber likened Pollan's \\"anti-scientific method\\" to the rhetoric used by health gurus who peddle diet scams. Pollan's work has also been discussed and criticized by Jonathan Safran Foer in his non-fiction book Eating Animals. Foer criticizes Pollan's argument regarding table-fellowship. According to Foer, Pollan claims that a vegetarian dinner guest causes socially reprimandable inconvenience for the host. Foer responds that in the year 2010 it is easier for hosts to accommodate vegetarians than locavores as hosts will need to do extensive research to find (expensive) non factory-farmed meat. Pollan has been accused by Jon Entine, who supports GMOs (genetically modified organisms), of using his influence to promote \\"anti-GMO junk science\\". A number of scientists and journalists have similarly characterized Pollan's work as biased against GMOs. For example, after Pollan posted a tweet that was critical of a New York Times article on GMOs, U.C. Berkeley biologist Michael Eisen posted a tweet calling Pollan's comment \\"a new low even in Pollan's 'anti-GMO crusade'\\".Michael Pollan Promotes 'Denialist' Anti-GMO Junk Science, Says He Manipulates New York Times' Editors, Jon Entine. Forbes, October 24, 2013. In response to Pollan's statement that GMOs have been one \\"tremendous disappointment,\\" food writer James Cooper criticized Pollan's tendency to cite poor or selected scientific sources. In 2014, Pollan co-hosted a discussion and informal debate on the topic of genetic modification at UC Berkeley featuring prominent plant geneticist Pamela Ronald, professor at UC Davis, whose research-based position \\"strongly disagrees with Pollan‚Äôs view that G.M.O. crops, broadly, are failing.\\" A New Yorker reporter observed that Pollan's largely anti-GMO student base at the discussion itself constituted, \\"a kind of monoculture,\\" yet that Pollan sought \\"to introduce an invasive species\\" by engaging Ronald. The event, while predictably contentious, reportedly produced a rare instance of courteous, productive exchange between the two main sharply-opposed viewpoints on genetically-modified crops.

Later that year, Atari, Inc. sued Coleco for patent infringement, and the companies wound up settling out of court, with Coleco becoming a licensee of Atari's patents. Gemini vs. 2600 The internals of the Gemini The main difference between the Coleco Gemini and the Atari 2600 is the controller design. The Coleco Gemini controllers (dubbed the 'Dual Command') featured an 8-way joystick and a 270-degree paddle on the same controller (the joystick was at the top of the controller, and the paddle was at the bottom of the controller). To play paddle games on the 2600, a Y-connector could be used to connect a joystick and paddles to the controller jack at the same time, rather than physically swapping controllers. The Gemini was more compact than the large faux- woodgrain or gloss black-trimmed consoles sold by Atari at the time. The Gemini also had a different game included with the system. Atari was including its version of \\"Pac-Man\\" along with the Combat game released in 1977. The Gemini most commonly included Donkey Kong, but at some point also included Carnival, Mouse Trap and Front Line.

The EP has eight tracks. There are two other (bootleg) versions of the EP, but the original has only eight tracks. It was released December 24, 2001 on D.P.G. Recordz. The tracks were recorded at Death Row Records between 1995-96 for Tupac's and Boot Camp Clik's project \\"One Nation\\". Later when Daz left Death Row, he stole an unknown amount of Tupac's unreleased masters, some of which can be heard on this EP. The only track left untouched by Daz is \\"They Don't Give a Fuck About Us\\", all other tracks were remixed and Daz also added himself onto tracks he originally didn't appear on, despite Dillinger marketing the EP as an original collaboration album.  Versions  Version 0: The original track listing posted on hitemup.com included eight tracks: Wake Up My People, First To Bomb, Let's Fight, Um Dumpin, Don't Go To Sleep, They Don't Give A Fuck About Us, 187 Um, Heaven or Hell Outro. This version never saw the light of day however, and track-listings were soon changed. Version 1: The first leaked release was ripped into poor quality and cut differently so that the tracks all ran together much like they do on the Makaveli album. This was in fact the first release available, and was put out thanks in part to certain members of the Pacboard community. This release included the same six tracks as above, as well as the originals of First to Bomb and Don't Go To Sleep instead of 187 Um and Heaven or Hell Outro. The cover read \\"Tupac Shakur & Daz Dillinger\\" in green lettering. This release was also released on a label dubbed \\"Pacaveli Records\\" and shows up from time to time on eBay. Version 1.5: This was the actual eight track release of the album by Daz Dillinger. It included the usual eight songs and was pressed and sold on the streets. The cover for the album had \\"D.P.G. Recordz Presents\\" in green lettering at the top of the album and had the track-listing on the back cover. Version 2: This is the Japan import version. This release included the same eight tracks as before, but also included the tracks \\"Move for the Money\\", \\"Don't Go To Sleep Soul-G Remix\\", \\"First To Bomb\\" instrumental, as well as \\"First to Bomb BBK Remix\\". For this release the cover was altered as real photos were photoshopped into the background of the cover for the 100 dollar bills. The top of the cover was changed to say Tupac Shakur & Daz Dillinger in white lettering. This release was released by Makaveli Records, and is the most common and easy to find release. Version 3: Finally, on 13 September 2003, Daz put out what he called \\"Makaveli & Dillinger, The Whole Album\\". This was basically the Japan import with some skits and filler tracks on it. The only new track that included 2Pac was the song \\"Initiated\\" which was released in 1998 on Daz's Retaliation, Revenge & Get Back album. The full track-listing for this album included 25 tracks, most of which was from Daz's then new album. Thus far, this was the last Makaveli & Dillinger release.  Controversy  On August 27, 2001, mother of Tupac, Afeni Shakur filed a lawsuit against Delmar Arnaud better known as Daz Dillinger seeking unspecified damages caused by his unauthorized pre-release online order for this album on the official website of D.P.G. Recordz. As the only legal successor of the copyright of anything connected with the brand names \\"2Pac\\" and \\"Makaveli\\" and executor and estate administrator of Tupac's musical compositions, Afeni Shakur has the right only to grant permission to release the recordings or to use her son's name, that - according to her - she was never earlier asked to do so by any of the management of D.P.G. Recordz. The lawsuit contains 13 causes of action, including : * trademark infringement, * unfair competition, * trademark dilution, * copyright infringement, * trademark infringement under common law, * conversion, * unjust enrichment, * declaratory relief, * and accountings. Shakur also maintains that Dillinger was still promoting the release of the album and accepting PayPal orders through his website all unauthorized. Daz stopped the selling of the Makaveli & Dillinger EP and days after the September 11 attacks the main page of the whole site changed into a tribute design. Later deathrowrecords.com adopted the material claiming the rights of the license for \\"Tha Dogg Pound\\" and \\"Dat Nigga Daz\\" and all material recorded under these pseudonyms. It is still purchasable there with some slight modifications in the number of tracks and their order. Daz claims in the April, 2005 issue of XXL that he still owns several recordings of 2Pac never heard before. While living in Los Angeles he was insulted in several warranted house searches by Suge Knight and by the police that were attempts to confiscate the reels. The legal status of those copies, however, still remains unclear.

Tower is located at 13 Prospect Avenue between the university-run Campus Club and the Cannon Club; it currently has a membership of approximately two hundred and fifteen. History In the spring of 1902, based on the idea of four sophomores, John Lee '04, Henry Pogue '04, Otto Wolff '04, Conway Shearer '04, and Frank \\"Pop\\" Little '03 led the formation of a new upperclass eating club. In April, a stake of four hundred dollars was placed to ensure the secure formation of the club the following year. In September of the same year, the Princeton Tower Club was formed in the old Monastery Club on University Place, across the University from its current location. It was composed of thirteen members of the senior class and thirteen juniors. During that year, the club hoped to move to a much coveted plot on Prospect Avenue, but settled for the Gulick House on Olden Street. Gulick was also known as the \\"Incubator\\" because it had served as a first home for a number of the infant eating clubs. After one term in the Incubator, Tower purchased a plot of land from the Cottage Club and, in September 1904, moved to a new home at 89 Prospect Avenue. Seven years later, Tower moved to its current location at 13 Prospect Avenue. Under the leadership of Tower, an Inter-Club Council was formed to address issues involving all of the Princeton eating clubs. Tower also led the formation of the Princeton Prospect Foundation, which enables educational opportunities on \\"The Street.\\" In 1971, Tower became one of the first clubs to accept women. Tower Club has long been an incubator of student activism and intellectual exploration. Such activities include the formation of at least one long- standing secret society, known only for keeping the hearth aflame. Membership Only currently enrolled Princeton students can be members of Tower Club; the majority of the membership is composed of juniors and seniors, with new sophomore members admitted each spring during \\"bicker.\\" Spring bicker is held during the first two to three days of the second semester. Students are informed of their membership status on the Friday of the first week of second semester classes, then initiated the same weekend. There is also a smaller bicker process held each October and open exclusively to students in their junior and senior years. The details of bicker, discussions and initiations are kept secret to preserve club tradition. Traditionally known to attract both artistic and politically engaged students on campus, Tower was the most bickered eating club between 2007 and 2010 with an acceptance rate of under 50%.With 217 bickering, Tower Club sets recordTI, Cottage, Ivy, Cap see spike in numbers while Tower sees fall References * Club Life at Princeton, 1994.

His wife, Helen and stepson, Anatole Volkov, were members of his ring. He was identified as a Soviet agent in the WPB operating under the code names Pel, Pal, \\"Paul\\" in the Venona decrypts; and as \\"Robert\\" both in Venona and independently by defecting Soviet intelligence courier Elizabeth Bentley.FBI Report, Underground Soviet Espionage Organization (NKVD) in Agencies of the United States Government, October 21, 1946 (FBI Silvermaster file, Volume 82), pg. 12 (PDF, pg. 17) Background Silvermaster was born to a Jewish family in Odessa, Russia (present-day Odessa, Ukraine) in 1898. He moved with his family to China, where he learned to speak perfect English with a British accent. He emigrated to the United States and earned his B.A. from the University of Washington in Seattle (where he was \\"stated to be a known Communist\\") and a Ph.D. from the University of California, Berkeley, where his thesis was entitled Lenin's Economic Thought Prior to the October Revolution. He became a naturalized American citizen in 1926. He was reported to be in contact with a very large number of Communist Party USA officials, and was active in a number of Communist front groups.FBI Report, op. cit., pgs. 21-23 (PDF pgs. 26-28) Career=Civil service From August 1935 to November 1938, Silvermaster worked in the Farm Security Administration. From November 1938 to July 1940, he worked on the Maritime Labor Board. From July 1940 to December 1944, he worked in the Department of Agriculture. While nominally remaining on the employment rolls of the Farm Security Administration, Silvermaster arranged in 1942 to be detailed to the Board of Economic Warfare. The transfer, however, triggered objections from military counter-intelligence who suspected he was a hidden Communist and regarded him as a security risk. On July 16, 1942 the U.S. Civil Service Commission recommended \\"Cancel eligibilities ... and bar him for the duration of the National Emergency.\\" Silvermaster denied any Communist links and appealed to Under Secretary of War Robert Patterson to overrule the security officials. Both White House advisor Lauchlin Currie (identified in Venona as the Soviet agent operating under the cover name \\"Page\\"Robert J. Hanyok, Eavesdropping on Hell: Historical Guide to Western Communications Intelligence and the Holocaust, 1939-45 (Washington, DC: Center for Cryptologic History, National Security Agency, 2005, 2nd edition), pg. 119 (PDF pg. 124)) and Assistant Secretary of the Treasury Harry Dexter White (identified in Venona as the Soviet agent operating under the cover names \\"Lawyer\\"; \\"Jurist\\"; \\"Richard\\") intervened on his behalf. Silvermaster subsequently received two promotions and pay raises. From 1942 to 1945, he was also assigned to the United States Treasury. In mid-1945, he joined the Reconstruction Finance Corporation (later War Assets Corporation). In March 1946, he resigned from government. On August 28, 1950, Lee Pressman (a member of the Ware Group, a precursor to the Silvermaster and Perlo) said of Silvermaster, \\"I believe he was with the Maritime Labor Board when I was with the CIO, and in that connection I may have had some business dealings with him\\" (apparently referring to Silvermasters time with that union 1938‚Äì1940). Espionage: Silvermaster Group Kathryn S. Olmsted, the author of Red Spy Queen (2002), points out: \\"Every two weeks, Elizabeth would travel to Washington to pick up documents from the Silvermasters, collect their Party dues, and deliver Communist literature. Soon the flow of documents grew so large that Ullmann, an amateur photographer, set up a darkroom in their basement. Elizabeth usually collected at least two or three rolls of microfilmed secret documents, and one time received as many as forty. She would stuff all the film and documents into a knitting bag or other innocent feminine accessory, then take it back to New York on the train.\\" Kathryn S. Olmsted, Red Spy Queen (2002) page 46 Moscow complained that around half of the photographed documents received in the summer of 1944 were unreadable and suggested that Ullmann receive more training. However, Pavel Fitin, who was responsible for analyzing the material, described it as very important data. At the War Production Board, Silvermaster was able to provide the Soviet Union with a large amount of data on arms, aircraft, and shipping production. In June 1943, Silvermaster sent a War Production Board report on arms production in the United States, including bombers, pursuit planes, tanks, propelled guns, howitzers, radar and submarines, sub chasers, and the like, to Soviet intelligence. Then, in December 1944, the New York MGBFBI Memorandum L.V. Boardman to A.H. Belmont, FBI Operations of the MGB Residency at New York, 1944-45, November 26, 1957 office cabled another Silvermaster report stating: \\"(Silvermaster) has sent us a 50-page Top Secret War Production Board report ... on arms production in the U.S.\\" In 1944, Silvermaster was associated with Harry Dexter White at the Bretton Woods conference, and his testimony before the US Senate Internal Security Subcommittee covers \\"175 pages of interrogation and exhibits\\" regarding his espionage activities in the U.S. The Silvermaster spy ring operated primarily in the Department of the Treasury but also had contacts in the Army Air Force and in the White House. Sixty-one of the Venona cables concern the activities of the Silvermaster spy ring. This represents 1% of the total (approx 6,000 cables) and 3% of the (2,000) translated/partially translated VENONA cables. *Nathan Gregory Silvermaster, Chief Planning Technician, Procurement Division, United States Department of the Treasury; Chief Economist, War Assets Administration; Director of the Labor Division, Farm Security Administration; Board of Economic Warfare; Reconstruction Finance Corporation Department of Commerce *Helen Silvermaster, wife *Anatole Boris Volkov, stepson *Solomon Adler aka Schlomer Adler, U.S. Department of the Treasury *Norman Chandler Bursler, United States Department of Justice Anti-Trust Division *Frank Coe, Assistant Director, Division of Monetary Research, Treasury Department; Special Assistant to the U.S. Ambassador in London; Assistant to the Executive Director, Board of Economic Warfare; Assistant Administrator, Foreign Economic Administration *Lauchlin Currie, Administrative Assistant to President Roosevelt; Deputy Administrator of Foreign Economic Administration; Special Representative to China *Bela Gold, Assistant Head of Program Surveys, Bureau of Agricultural Economics, United States Department of Agriculture; Senate Subcommittee on War Mobilization; Office of Economic Programs in Foreign Economic Administration *Sonia Steinman Gold, Division of Monetary Research U.S. Treasury Department; U.S. House of Representatives Select Committee on Interstate Migration; U.S. Bureau of Employment Security *Irving Kaplan, Foreign Funds Control and Division of Monetary Research, United States Department of the Treasury Foreign Economic Administration; chief advisor to the Military Government of Germany *George Silverman, civilian Chief Production Specialist, Material Division, Army Air Force Air Staff, War Department, Pentagon *William Henry Taylor, Assistant Director of the Middle East Division of Monetary Research, United States Department of Treasury *William \\"Lud\\" Ullman, delegate to United Nations Charter meeting and Bretton Woods conference; Division of Monetary Research, Department of Treasury; Material and Services Division, Air Corps Headquarters, Pentagon *Harry Dexter White, Assistant Secretary of the Treasury; Head of the International Monetary Fund Death He died on October 7, 1964, aged 65, possibly in Harvey Cedars, New Jersey.

Among his character creations are the Silver Age version of DC super-speedster the Flash with writer Robert Kanigher, the stretching Elongated Man with John Broome, Deadman with writer Arnold Drake, and Christopher Chance, the second iteration of the Human Target with Len Wein. He was inducted into comics' Will Eisner Award Hall of Fame in 2000. Early life Carmine Infantino was born via midwife in his family's apartment in Brooklyn, New York City. His father, Pasquale \\"Patrick\\" Infantino, born in New York City, was originally a musician who played saxophone, clarinet, and violin, and had a band with composer Harry Warren. During the Great Depression he turned to a career as a licensed plumber. Carmine Infantino's mother, Angela Rosa DellaBadia, emigrated from Calitri, a hill town northeast of Naples, Italy.Carmine Infantino with J. David Spurlock, The Amazing World of Carmine Infantino: An Autobiography'. Lebanon, New Jersey: Vanguard Productions, 2000; , pp. 12‚Äì13 Infantino attended Public Schools 75 and 85 in Brooklyn before going on to the School of Industrial Art (later renamed the High School of Art and Design) in Manhattan. During his freshman year of high school, Infantino began working for Harry \\"A\\" Chesler, whose studio was one of a handful of comic-book \\"packagers\\" who created complete comics for publishers looking to enter the emerging field in the 1930s‚Äì1940s Golden Age of Comic Books. As Infantino recalled: Career With Frank Giacoia penciling, Infantino inked the feature \\"Jack Frost\\" in USA Comics #3 (cover-dated Jan. 1942), from Timely Comics, the forerunner of Marvel Comics. He wrote in his autobiography that Infantino would eventually work for several publishers during the decade, drawing Human Torch and Angel stories for Timely; Airboy and Heap stories for Hillman Periodicals; working for packager Jack Binder, who supplied Fawcett Comics; briefly at Holyoke Publishing; then landing at DC Comics. Infantino's first published work for DC was \\"The Black Canary\\", a six-page Johnny Thunder story in Flash Comics #86 (Aug. 1947) that introduced the superheroine the Black Canary. Infantino's long association with the Flash mythos began with \\"The Secret City\\" a story in All-Flash #31 (Oct.-Nov. 1947).Wallace \\"1940s\\" in Dolan, p. 56 \\"The first Carmine Infantino art of the Flash character appeared in this issue's twelve- page adventure \\"The Secret City\\"...it was Infantino's work on the Flash that would become the cornerstone of his career. He additionally became a regular artist of the Golden Age Green Lantern and the Justice Society of America. During the 1950s, Infantino freelanced for Joe Simon and Jack Kirby's company, Prize Comics, drawing the series Charlie Chan. Back at DC, during a lull in the popularity of superheroes, Infantino drew Westerns, mysteries, science fiction comics. The Silver Age In 1956, DC editor Julius Schwartz assigned writer Robert Kanigher and artist Infantino to the company's first attempt at reviving superheroes: an updated version of the Flash that would appear in issue #4 (Oct. 1956) of the try-out series Showcase. Infantino designed the now-classic red uniform with yellow detail (reminiscent of the original Fawcett Captain Marvel), striving to keep the costume as streamlined as possible, and he drew on his design abilities to create a new visual language to depict the Flash's speed, using both vertical and horizontal motion lines to make the figure a red and yellow blur. The eventual success of the new, science-fiction-oriented Flash heralded the wholesale return of superheroes, and the beginning of what fans and historians call the Silver Age of comics.Irvine, Alex \\"1950s\\" in Dolan, p. 80 \\"The arrival of the second incarnation of the Flash in [Showcase] issue #4 is considered to be the official start of the Silver Age of comics.\\" Showcase #4 (Oct. 1956): The Silver Age starts. Cover art by Carmine Infantino and Joe Kubert. Infantino drew \\"Flash of Two Worlds,\\" a landmark story published in The Flash #123 (Sept. 1961) that introduced Earth-Two, and more generally the concept of the multiverse, to DC Comics.McAvennie, Michael \\"1960s\\" in Dolan, p. 103 \\"This classic Silver Age story resurrected the Golden Age Flash and provided a foundation for the Multiverse from which he and the Silver Age Flash would hail.\\" Infantino continued to work for Schwartz in his other features and titles, most notably \\"Adam Strange\\" in Mystery in Space, succeeding the character's initial artist, Mike Sekowsky. In 1964, Schwartz was made responsible for reviving the faded Batman titles. Writer John Broome and artist Infantino jettisoned the sillier aspects that had crept into the series (such as Ace the Bathound, and Bat-Mite) and gave the \\"New Look\\" Batman and Robin a more detective-oriented direction and sleeker draftsmanship that proved a hit combination.McAvennie \\"1960s\\" in Dolan, p. 110: \\"The Dark Knight received a much-needed facelift from new Batman editor Julius Schwartz, writer John Broome, and artist Carmine Infantino. With sales at an all-time low and threatening the cancelation of one of DC's flagship titles, their overhaul was a lifesaving success for DC and its beloved Batman.\\" Other features and characters Infantino drew at DC include \\"The Space Museum\\", and Elongated Man. With Gardner Fox, Infantino co-created the Blockbuster in Detective Comics #345 (Nov. 1965) and Barbara Gordon as a new version of Batgirl in Detective Comics #359 (Jan. 1967).McAvennie \\"1960s\\" in Dolan, p. 122 \\"Nine months before making her debut on Batman, a new Batgirl appeared in the pages of Detective Comics ... Yet the idea for the debut of Barbara Gordon, according to editor Julius Schwartz, was attributed to the television series executives' desire to have a character that would appeal to a female audience and for this character to originate in the comics. Hence, writer Gardner Fox and artist Carmine Infantino collaborated on 'The Million Dollar Debut of Batgirl!'\\" Writer Arnold Drake and Infantino created the supernatural superhero Deadman in Strange Adventures #205 (Oct. 1967).McAvennie \\"1960s\\" in Dolan, p. 125 \\"In a story by scribe Arnold Drake and artist Carmine Infantino, circus aerialist Boston Brand learned there was much more to life after his death...Deadman's origin tale was the first narcotics-related story to require prior approval from the Comics Code Authority.\\" This story included the first known depiction of narcotics in a story approved by the Comics Code Authority. DC Comics editorial director In late 1966/early 1967, Infantino was tasked by Irwin Donenfeld with designing covers for the entire DC line. Stan Lee learned this and approached Infantino with a $22,000 offer to move to Marvel. Publisher Jack Liebowitz confirmed that DC could not match the offer, but could promote Infantino to the position of art director. Initially reluctant, Infantino accepted what Liebowitz posed as a challenge, and stayed with DC.Ro, Ronin. Tales to Astonish: Jack Kirby, Stan Lee and the American Comic Book Revolution, p. 117-118 (Bloomsbury, 2004) When DC was sold to Kinney National Company, Infantino was promoted to editorial director. He started by hiring new talent, and promoting artists to editorial positions. He hired Dick Giordano away from Charlton Comics, and made artists Joe Orlando, Joe Kubert and Mike Sekowsky editors. New talents such as artist Neal Adams and writer Denny O'Neil were brought into the company. Several of DC's older characters were revamped by O'Neil including Wonder Woman;McAvennie \\"1960s\\" in Dolan, p. 131 \\"Carmine Infantino wanted to rejuvenate what had been perceived as a tired Wonder Woman, so he assigned writer Denny O'Neil and artist Mike Sekowsky to convert the Amazon Princess into a secret agent. Wonder Woman was made over into an Emma Peel type and what followed was arguably the most controversial period in the hero's history.\\" Batman; Green Lantern and Green Arrow; and Superman.In, respectively, Wonder Woman #178 (Sept.-Oct. 1968), Detective Comics #395 (Jan. 1970), Green Lantern #76 (April 1970), and Superman #233 (Jan. 1971) at the Grand Comics Database In 1970, Infantino signed on Marvel Comics' star artist and storytelling collaborator Jack Kirby to a DC Comics contract. Beginning with Superman's Pal Jimmy Olsen, Kirby created his Fourth World saga that wove through that existing title and three new series he created. After the \\"Fourth World\\" titles were canceled, Kirby created several other series for DC including OMAC, Kamandi, The Demon, and, together with former partner Joe Simon for one last time, a new incarnation of the Sandman before returning to freelancing for Marvel in 1975. DC Comics publisher Infantino was made DC's publisher in early 1971, during a time of declining circulation for the company's comics, and he attempted a number of changes. In an effort to increase revenue, he raised the cover price of DC's comics from 15 to 25 cents, simultaneously raising the page-count by adding reprints and new backup features.McAvennie \\"1970s\\" in Dolan, p.144: \\"Although decreasing sales and inflation dictated a hefty cover price increase from 15 to 25 cents, Infantino saw to it that extra pages containing classic reprints and new back-up features were added to DC titles.\\" Marvel met the price increase, then dropped back to 20 cents; DC stayed at 25 cents for about a year, a decision that ultimately proved bad for overall sales.McAvennie \\"1970s\\" in Dolan, p. 150: \\"Despite its renewed excitement, and a mid-year cover price decrease to 20 cents, DC's line of superhero comics was experiencing uneven sales results in 1972.\\" Infantino and writer Len Wein co- created the \\"Human Target\\" feature in Action Comics #419 (December 1972).McAvennie \\"1970s\\" in Dolan, p. 153: \\"Starting as a back-up feature in the pages of Action Comics, scribe Len Wein and artist Carmine Infantino introduced Christopher Chance, a master of disguise who would turn himself into a human target ‚Äì provided you could meet his price.\\" The character was adapted into a short-lived ABC television series starring Rick Springfield which debuted in July 1992.\\"Human Target on ABC\\".

Infantino later drew for a number of titles for Warren Publishing and Marvel, including the latter's Star Wars, Spider-Woman, and Nova. His brief collaboration with Jim Shooter saw the introduction of Paladin in Daredevil #150 (Jan. 1978). During Infantino's tenure on the Star Wars series, it was one of the industry's top selling titles. In 1981, he returned to DC Comics and co-created a revival of the \\"Dial H for Hero\\" feature with writer Marv Wolfman in a special insert in Legion of Super-Heroes #272 (February 1981).Manning, Matthew K. \\"1980s\\" in Dolan, p. 192 \\"Within a sixteen-page preview in Legion of Super-Heroes #272...was \\"Dial 'H' For Hero,\\" a new feature that raised the bar on fan interaction in the creative process.

In 1990, he followed Marshall Rogers as artist of the Batman newspaper comic strip and drew the strip until its cancellation the following year. During the 1990s Infantino also taught at the School of Visual Arts before retiring. Despite his retirement, Infantino made appearances at comic conventions in the early 21st century. In 2004, he sued DC for rights to characters he alleged to have created while he was a freelancer for the company. These include several Flash characters including Wally West, Iris West, Captain Cold, Captain Boomerang, Mirror Master, and Gorilla Grodd, as well as the Elongated Man and Batgirl. The lawsuit was dismissed in September of that same year.

However the town went into decline again and the school closed in 1979, followed nine years later by the post office. In July 2020, the name of the locality was officially gazetted as Whangam≈çmona by the New Zealand Geographic Board.  Republic Day  In 1989, regional council boundaries were redrawn, with an emphasis on connected catchments. These revised maps made Whangam≈çmona part of the then-Manawatu-Wanganui Region. Residents objected, as they wanted to continue being part of the Taranaki Region, and on 1 November 1989, they responded by declaring themselves the \\"Republic of Whangamomona\\" at the first Republic Day. Though the move began as a pointed protest, the town continued to hold a celebratory Republic Day once a year, during which a vote for President was held. The day has become a local festival day, and attracts visitors from throughout the North Island. In 2001, the celebration became biennial, held in January to take advantage of the summer weather. Presidents Ian Kjestrup (1989‚Äì1999) After being put on the ballot without his knowledge, Kjestrup became the first elected President, serving 10 years. Billy Gumboot the Goat (1999‚Äì2001) Gumboot was the first elected animal. He won election by a landslide, although some residents speculate he ate the other challengers' ballots in order to win. He died in office after serving for 18 months. Tai the Poodle (2003‚Äì2004) Tai retired after he was attacked by a mastiff, but some speculate it was an assassination attempt. Though he survived the attack, Tai was left unfit for service and died in 2010. Sir Murt \\"Murtle the Turtle\\" Kennard (2005‚Äì2015) The local garage owner fought off strong competition from former President Kjestrup and a cross-dresser called \\"Miriam\\" to become the 4th President. He was re-elected in 2009 by one vote, and again by a landslide in 2011. Kennard died at New Plymouth Hospice on 25 October 2015. Vicki Pratt (2015‚Äì2017) Pratt was the first female President appointed for the Whangamomona Republic. The local publican was \\"somehow picked while working in the kitchen\\". John Herlihy (2017‚Äìpresent) Herlihy was elected ahead of Jack Spearow, Lili Jiao (who wanted to be a cat) and Ted (who was already a cat), despite reported attempts by Spearow to steal ballots. On Republic Day 2019 (19 January) President Herlihy was re-elected for a second term, having fought off challenges from Maketoni the Teddy Bear, Sherman the Cockatoo, Eunice the Sheep, Griff Robb (who proposed that the land-locked nation should enter into maritime tourism) and a Mrs Brown look- alike at the polls. Controversy surrounded the election due to the disappearance of candidate Eunice the Sheep, with commentators noting that mutton sandwiches were for sale at the Republic Day barbecue.

He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the San Diego Padres, Minnesota Twins and New York Mets. Amateur career=High school and college Stauffer graduated Saratoga Central Catholic High School in Saratoga Springs, New York and attended the University of Richmond through his junior year, where was twice named the Atlantic 10 Conference Pitcher of the Year. As a sophomore in 2002, Stauffer established Atlantic 10 records for wins (15) and strike-outs (140). He posted a 1.54 ERA and was named a first- team All-American. In 2003, Stauffer broke his own Atlantic 10 strike-out record with 146 and posted a 9-5 record with a 1.97 ERA and 10 complete games. He was again selected to the All-America Team. Summer collegiate league Stauffer played for the Keene Swamp Bats of the New England Collegiate Baseball League in the summer of 2001, where he set an NECBL record with a 7-0 win/loss mark. In 2002, he played for the Chatham A's of the Cape Cod League, and is featured in the book The Last Best League: One Summer, One Season, One Dream by Jim Collins. Professional career=San Diego Padres Stauffer was selected in the first round by the San Diego Padres as the fourth overall pick of the June 2003 draft. Stauffer had been bothered by shoulder soreness since the end of the college season, and an MRI in July showed weakness in the shoulder joint. He and his agent went to the Padres with this information during negotiations, and as a result he signed with the Padres for a bonus much less than a fourth overall pick would normally receive. The Padres scouting director Bill Gayton said about the disclosure, \\"Their honesty and integrity is second to none. They didn't have to do that.\\" Stauffer rested his arm in 2003, and began 2004 with the Class A Advanced Lake Elsinore Storm. He was quickly promoted through Double-A and reached the Triple-A Portland Beavers in June, posting a 3.54 ERA in 14 starts with the club. He was being projected as a number 3 starter, soon to reach the major leagues. Stauffer began the 2005 season in Triple-A. He made his Major League debut on May 11 against the Cincinnati Reds and earned his first win in a 6-inning, 2-run outing. He pitched to a 3-6 record with a 5.33 ERA with the Padres in 2005, and was returned to Triple-A after a July 31 relief appearance. Stauffer spent most of 2006 and 2007 with Triple-A Portland. He was called up to the Padres for a single appearance on August 21, 2006, in order to temporarily fill a spot in a pitching rotation hampered by injuries. His third and fourth call- ups came on July 29, 2007 and August 26, 2007, where he again made spot starts before being sent back to Triple-A. He posted a 15-17 record and 4.98 ERA in 46 starts over his 2006 and 2007 Triple-A seasons. After the 2007 season, Stauffer elected to have surgery to repair a tear in the labrum of his right shoulder. The surgery and rehab cost him the entire 2008 season, and Stauffer began 2009 with the Double-A San Antonio Missions after a month of extended spring training to build arm strength. Stauffer was called back up to the big leagues on July 11, 2009. He made 14 starts for the Padres in the second half, posting a 4-7 record and 3.58 ERA. In 2010, Stauffer started the season working out of the Padres bullpen and posted a 0.49 ERA in 9 appearances. He got his first opportunity to start on May 9, taking the place of Kevin Correia, but Stauffer required an emergency appendectomy on May 11, sidelining him for nearly two months. When he rejoined the club, he worked out of the bullpen until September when he made six more starts. Stauffer finished the season with a 6-5 record and 1.85 ERA, with 61 strike-outs and 24 walks in 82 innings pitched. Stauffer was the Padres Opening Day pitcher in 2011 and was a mainstay of the rotation. He started 31 games and finished the season with a 9-12 record and 3.73 ERA, with 128 strike-outs versus 58 walks over 185 innings. In early 2012, Stauffer and the Padres agreed on a one-year $3.2 million contract to avoid arbitration. Stauffer was again the planned Opening Day starter, but he suffered an elbow strain in spring training and went on the disabled list. He only made a single start in May before going back on the DL. In August, he had surgery on the flexor tendon in his right elbow. After the season, the Padres did not tender an offer to Stauffer, and he elected for free agency after clearing waivers. On January 29, 2013, Stauffer re-signed with the Padres on a minor league deal. After going 2-2 with a 3.16 ERA in Triple A, Stauffer's contract was selected, and he was called up to the Majors on May 17, 2013. Stauffer settled into a long relief role with the Padres bullpen, pitching multiple innings in 22 of his 43 relief appearances. He finished the 2013 season with a 3-1 record and 3.75 ERA, recording 64 strike- outs in 69 innings. Stauffer signed a new one-year, $1.6 million deal with San Diego on December 2, 2013, avoiding arbitration. Stauffer again primarily worked out of the pen as long reliever, making three starts in late May and early June after Robbie Erlin went to the disabled list. He finished the 2014 season with an overall 3.50 ERA, and a 2.56 ERA as a reliever, striking out 67 in 64 innings. Minnesota Twins Stauffer signed a one-year $2.2 million contract with the Minnesota Twins on December 23, 2014. On May 1, Stauffer landed on the disabled list with a strained right intercostal muscle. He was designated for assignment on June 11, 2015 and released on June 17. Sugar Land Skeeters After being released by the Twins, Stauffer signed with the Sugar Land Skeeters of the Atlantic League of Professional Baseball. New York Mets On July 31, 2015 Stauffer signed a minor league contract with the New York Mets. Stauffer pitched for the Las Vegas 51s of the Class AAA Pacific Coast League, and was promoted to the major leagues on September 8. Stauffer was designated for assignment by the Mets on October 12, 2015, thus making him a free agent to make room for Matt Reynolds on the 40-man roster. Stauffer had a 7.94 ERA in five appearances for the Mets. Arizona Diamondbacks On December 23, 2015, Stauffer agreed to a minor league deal with the Arizona Diamondbacks. He was released on March 28, 2016.

Its causative agent is lymphocytic choriomeningitis mammarenavirus (LCMV), a member of the family Arenaviridae. The name was coined by Charles Armstrong in 1934.Edward A. Beeman: Charles Armstrong, M.D.: A Biography, 2007 pp. 183ff. (also online here (PDF) Lymphocytic choriomeningitis (LCM) is \\"a viral infection of the membranes surrounding the brain and spinal cord and of the cerebrospinal fluid\\".Lasker, Jill S. \\"Lymphocytic choriomeningitis\\". The name is based on the tendency of an individual to have abnormally high levels of lymphocytes during infection. Choriomeningitis is \\"cerebral meningitis in which there is marked cellular infiltration of the meninges, often with a lymphocytic infiltration of the choroid plexuses\\".\\"choriomeningitis\\" Signs and symptoms LCMV infection manifests itself in a wide range of clinical symptoms, and may even be asymptomatic for immunocompetent individuals.CDC. \\"Information for Pet Owners: Reducing the Risk of Becoming Infected with LCMV from Pet Rodents\\". Onset typically occurs between one or two weeks after exposure to the virus and is followed by a biphasic febrile illness. During the initial or prodromal phase, which may last up to a week, common symptoms include fever, lack of appetite, headache, muscle aches, malaise, nausea, and/or vomiting. Less frequent symptoms include a sore throat and cough, as well as joint, chest, and parotid pain. The onset of the second phase occurs several days after recovery, and consists of symptoms of meningitis or encephalitis. Pathological findings during the first stage consist of leukopenia and thrombocytopenia. During the second phase, typical findings include elevated protein levels, increased leukocyte count, or a decrease in glucose levels of the cerebrospinal fluid). Occasionally, a patient improves for a few days, then relapses with aseptic meningitis, or very rarely, meningoencephalitis. Patients with meningitis may have a stiff neck, fever, headache, myalgia, nausea and malaise. In some occasions, meningitis occurs without a prodromal syndrome. Meningoencephalitis is characterized by more profound neurological signs such as confusion, drowsiness, sensory abnormalities and motor signs. Under reported complications include myelitis, Guillain‚ÄìBarr√©-type syndrome, cranial nerve palsies, transient or permanent hydrocephalus, sensorineural hearing loss, orchitis, arthritis and parotitis. LCMV infections have also been associated with pancreatitis, pneumonitis, myocarditis and pericarditis. The entire illness usually lasts 1 to 3 weeks, nonetheless, temporary or permanent neurological damage is possible in all central nervous system infections, especially in cases of meningoencephalitis. Chronic infections have not been reported in humans and deaths rarely occur. Cause=Virus biology There are several strains of LCM virus, among which the most widely used are LCMV Armstrong and LCMV Clone 13. Armstrong is the original virus strain which was isolated from the brain by Charles Armstrong in 1934. It triggers a vigorous cytotoxic T lymphocytes(CTL) response and thus, it is cleared rapidly by the host. This is referred to as acute (Armstrong) LCMV infection. On the other hand, Clone 13 is a variant of the Armstrong viral strain, isolated from the spleen and is consequently tropic for visceral organs. It was first isolated from mice which sustained a persistent LCMV infection from birth. This variant potentiates a less vigorous CTL response in the immune system, and thus can ultimately persist in the host organism indefinitely. The latter is referred to as chronic (Clone 13) LCMV infection. LCMV is a spherical enveloped virus with a diameter between 60 and 300 nm. The helical nucleocapsid contains an RNA genome consisting of two negative single-stranded RNA segments. The negative RNA strand, complementary to the necessary mRNA strand, indicates that it must first be transcribed into a positive mRNA strand before it can be translated into the required proteins. The L strand is ambisense RNA, encoding multiple proteins in opposite directions, separated by an intergenic region. It is approximately 7.2 kb in size and encodes a high-molecular-mass protein (L; 200 kDa) and an 11 kDa small polypeptide Z with unknown function and a ring finger motif. The viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase is encoded by the L protein which contains conserved characteristic motifs throughout all the RNA-dependent, RNA- polymerases. The S strand is ambisense and approximately 3.4 kb in size. It encodes the two main structural proteins: nucleo-protein (63 kDa) and glycoprotein C (75kDa).[27] The latter undergoes posttranslational cleavage and results in the synthesis of two mature virion glycoproteins, GP-1 (40 to 46 kDa) and GP-2 (35 kDa). The spikes present on the virion envelope are dictated by tetramer formation of GP-1 and GP-2. When LCMV attacks a cell, the process of replication starts by attachment of the virus to host receptors through its surface glycoproteins.Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics. Viral Zone \\"Arenaviridae\\". It is then endocytosed into a vesicle inside the host cell and creates a fusion of the virus and vesicle membranes. The ribonucleocapsid is then released in the cytoplasm. The RNA-dependent, RNA- polymerase brought along with the virus initially binds to a promoter on the L and S segments and begins transcription from negative-stranded to a positive- stranded mRNA. The formation of a strong hairpin sequence at the end of each gene terminates transcription. The mRNA strands are capped by the RNA- dependent, RNA-polymerase in the cytoplasm and are then subsequently translated into the four proteins essential for LCMV assembly. The ribonucleocapsid interacts with the Z matrix protein and buds on the cell membrane, releasing the virion out from the infected cell. The first arenavirus, Lymphocytic choriomeningitis mammarenavirus (LCMV), was isolated in 1933 by Charles Armstrong during a study of an epidemic in St. Louis. Although not the cause of the outbreak, LCMV was found to be a cause of nonbacterial or aseptic meningitis. In 1996, Peter Doherty and Rolf Zinkernagel shared the Nobel Prize in Medicine and Physiology, for their work with LCMV which led to a fundamental understanding of the adaptive immune response, MHC restriction. In the 1970s, studies concerning the importance of MHC locus were done exclusively in transplantation and tumor rejection. Taking this into consideration, Doherty and Zinkernagel were working on the response of mice to virus infections. They observed that T-cell receptors must recognise a complex of foreign antigen and an MHC antigen in order to destroy infected cells. Their key experiment involved harvesting of splenocytes containing LCMV-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes(CTL) from an infected mouse strain A. These were then mixed in vitro with virus infected fibroblasts or macrophages from two different mouse strains, A and B. By the method of Cr- release cytotoxicity assay, thereby tagging the CTL with chromium-51 (Cr-51), the CTL destruction of infected cells was quantified by release of Cr-51. The results showed that CTL killed only the infected cells from strain A, and they did not lyse uninfected cells or infected cells from strain B. They concluded that these virus specific CTLs only lyse cells carrying the same molecules of the major histocompatibility site (MHC) as the CTLs themselves. Thus, the virus-specific CTLs are \\"MHC-restricted\\". This discovery lead to a greater understanding of an important aspect of the immune system. Spread LCMV is naturally spread by the common house mouse, Mus musculus. Once infected, these mice can become chronically infected by maintaining virus in their blood or persistently shedding virus in their urine. Chronically infected female mice usually transmit infection to their offspring (vertical transmission), which in turn become chronically infected. Other modes of mouse-to-mouse transmission include nasal secretions, milk from infected dams, bites, and during social grooming within mouse communities. Airborne transmission also occurs. The virus seems to be relatively resistant to drying and therefore humans can become infected by inhaling infectious aerosolized particles of rodent urine, feces, or saliva, by ingesting food contaminated with virus, by contamination of mucous membranes with infected body fluids, or by directly exposing cuts or other open wounds to virus-infected blood. The only documented cases of transmission from animals have occurred between humans and mice or hamsters. Cases of lymphocytic choriomeningitis have been reported in North and South America, Europe, Australia, and Japan, particularly during the 1900s.CDC. \\"Lymphocytic choriomeningitis.\\" However, infection may occur wherever an infected rodent host population exists. LCMV occurs worldwide and its natural host, the rodent, has become established on all continents, except Antarctica.The centre for Food Security and Public Health. Institute for International Co-operation and in Animal Biologics. Iowa State University. Ames, Iowa. 2010. http://www.cfsph.iastate.edu/Factsheets/pdfs/lymphocytic_choriomeningitis.pdf Seroprevalence is approximately 5% (0.7‚Äì4.7%) of the US population. It tends to be more common among lower socio-economic groupings, probably reflecting more frequent and direct contacts with mice. However, obtaining an accurate sense of prevalence by geographic region is difficult due to underreporting. =Congenital infection= Lymphocytic choriomeningitis is a particular concern in obstetrics, as vertical transmission is known to occur. For immunocompetent mothers, there is no significant threat, but the virus has damaging effects upon the fetus. If infection occurs during the first trimester, LCMV results in an increased risk of spontaneous abortion. Later congenital infection may lead to malformations such as intracranial calcifications, hydrocephalus, microcephaly or macrocephaly, intellectual disabilities, and seizures. Other findings include chorioretinal scars, and optic atrophy. Chorioretinitis, which is followed by chorioretinal scarring, is the most common ocular lesion. Mortality among infants is approximately 30%. Among the survivors, two thirds have lasting neurologic abnormalities. Other ocular defects including optic atrophy, microphthalmia, vitreitis, leukokoria and cataracts can also be seen. Most of the infants in one case series were of normal birth weight, although 30% were underweight. Aspiration pneumonia can be a fatal complication. Infants who survive may have severe neurological defects including epilepsy, impaired coordination, visual loss or blindness, spastic diplegia or quadriparesis/quadriplegia, delayed development and intellectual disability. Less severe cases with isolated cerebellar hypoplasia and symptoms of ataxia and jitteriness have been reported occasionally. There have also been rare cases with evidence of chorioretinitis but without neurological signs. Systemic signs seem to be rare, but hepatosplenomegaly, thrombocytopenia and hyperbilirubinemia have been documented in a few cases, and skin blisters were reported in one infant. If a woman has come into contact with a rodent during pregnancy and LCM symptoms are manifested, a blood test is available to determine previous or current infection. A history of infection does not pose a risk for future pregnancies.CDC. \\"Lymphocytic Choriomeningitis Virus (LCMV) and Pregnancy: Facts and Prevention.\\" =Organ donation= Patients infected in solid organ transplants have developed a severe fatal illness, starting within weeks of the transplant. In all reported cases, the initial symptoms included fever, lethargy, anorexia and leukopenia, and quickly progressed to multisystem organ failure, hepatic insufficiency or severe hepatitis, dysfunction of the transplanted organ, coagulopathy, hypoxia, multiple bacteremias and shock. Localized rash and diarrhea were also seen in some patients. Nearly all cases have been fatal. In May 2005, four solid-organ transplant recipients contracted an illness that was later diagnosed as lymphocytic choriomeningitis. All received organs from a common donor, and within a month of transplantation, three of the four recipients had died as a result of the viral infection. Epidemiologic investigation traced the source to a pet hamster that the organ donor had recently purchased from a Rhode Island pet store. Similar cases occurred in Massachusetts in 2008, and Australia in 2013.Transplant patients died from donor's disease‚ÄîAustralian Broadcasting Corporation‚ÄîRetrieved 7 May 2013. There is not a LCMV infection test that is approved by the Food and Drug Administration for organ donor screening. The Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report advises health-care providers to \\"consider LCMV infection in patients with aseptic meningitis and encephalitis and in organ transplant recipients with unexplained fever, hepatitis, or multisystem organ failure.\\" Diagnosis Current or previous infection can be detected through a blood test. However, some authors note that such complement-fixation tests are insensitive and should not be used for diagnosis. Dr. Clare A. Dykewicz, et al. state, : Infection with LCMV should be considered in the differential diagnosis of any compatible, severe viral infection or aseptic meningitis, especially when there is a history of occupational exposure to laboratory rodents. Timeliness of diagnosis is important not only in expediting treatment of infected persons, but also in preventing further LCMV transmission to other workers and animals. Clinical diagnosis of LCM can be made by the history of prodrome symptoms and by considering the period of time before the onset of meningitis symptoms, typically 15‚Äì21 days for LCM. Pathological diagnosis of congenital infection is performed using either an immunofluorescent antibody (IFA) test or an enzyme immunoassay to detect specific antibody in blood or cerebrospinal fluid. A PCR assay has been recently developed which may be used in the future for prenatal diagnosis; however, the virus is not always present in the blood or CSF when the affected child is born.\\" Diagnoses is subject to methodological shortcomings in regard to specificity and sensitivity of assays used.Craighead, John E. MD. Pathology and Pathogenesis of Human Viral Disease. For this reason, LCMV may be more common than is realized. Another detection assay is the reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests which may detect nucleic acids in the blood and cerebrospinal fluid.(CSF) Virus isolation is not used for diagnosis in most cases but it can be isolated from the blood or nasopharyngeal fluid early in the course of the disease, or from CSF in patients with meningitis. LCMV can be grown in a variety of cell lines including BHK21, L and Vero cells, and it may be identified with immuno- fluorescence. A diagnosis can also be made by the intracerebral inoculation of blood or CSF into mice. Prevention LCMV is susceptible to most detergents and disinfectants including 1% sodium hypochlorite, 70% ethanol, 2% glutaraldehyde and formaldehyde. The effectiveness of infection quickly declines below pH 5.5 and above pH 8.5. In addition, LCMV can also be inactivated by heat, ultraviolet light or gamma irradiation. Studies have indicated that human infection of the virus occurs primarily during the fall and winter months, presumably due to the movement of mice indoors.Bauers, Sandy. \\"House vs. Mouse: The Latest Ideas in Humanely Showing Our Disease- Ridden Fall Visitors the Door.\\" Several measures can be taken to prevent exposure to LCM from wild rodents in the home. A checklist of precautions is provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, providing tips for sealing the home to keep rodents out, using traps to eliminate existing rodents, and maintaining a clean, healthy home.CDC. \\"Prevent LCMV from wild rodents.\\"p. 1. New technology reflects a growing trend for more humane means of eliminating rodents. Products include devices that emit ultrasonic sound that allegedly irritates mice and drives them away, and more swift, painless means of death such as mini electrocution or gas chambers. However, the traditional snap trap remains an economic and popular option. Treatment Treatment is symptomatic and supportive. Children with hydrocephalus often need a ventriculoperitoneal shunt. Nucleoside analog ribavirin is used in some cases due to the inhibitory effect the agent has in vitro on arenaviruses. However, there is not sufficient evidence for efficacy in humans to support routine use.CDC. \\"Lymphocytic choriomeningitis.\\" The only survivor of a transplant-associated LCMV infection was treated with ribavirin and simultaneous tapering of the immunosuppressive medications. Early and intravenous ribavirin treatment is required for maximal efficacy, and it can produce considerable side effects. Ribavirin has not been evaluated yet in controlled clinical trials. Use of ribavirin during pregnancy is generally not recommended, as some studies indicate the possibility of teratogenic effects. If aseptic meningitis, encephalitis, or meningoencephalitis develops in consequence to LCMV, hospitalization and supportive treatment may be required. In some circumstances, anti-inflammatory drugs may also be considered. In general, mortality is less than one percent. Prognosis Lymphocytic choriomeningitis is not a commonly reported infection in humans, though most infections are mild and are often never diagnosed. Serological surveys suggest that approximately 1‚Äì5% of the population in the U.S. and Europe has antibodies to LCMV. The prevalence varies with the living conditions and exposure to mice, and it has been higher in the past due to lower standards of living. The island of Vir in Croatia is one of the biggest described endemic places of origin of LCMV in the world, with IFA testing having found LCMV antibodies in 36% of the population. Individuals with the highest risk of infection are laboratory personnel who handle rodents or infected cells. Temperature and time of year is also a critical factor that contributes to the number of LCMV infections, particularly during fall and winter when mice tend to move indoors. Approximately 10‚Äì20% of the cases in immunocompetent individuals are thought to progress to neurological disease, mainly as aseptic meningitis. The overall case fatality rate is less than 1% and people with complications, including meningitis, almost always recover completely. Rare cases of meningoencephalitis have also been reported. More severe disease is likely to occur in people who are immunosuppressed. More than 50 infants with congenital LCMV infection have been reported worldwide. The probability that a woman will become infected after being exposed to rodents, the frequency with which LCMV crosses the placenta, and the likelihood of clinical signs among these infants are still poorly understood. In one study, antibodies to LCMV were detected in 0.8% of normal infants, 2.7% of infants with neurological signs and 30% of infants with hydrocephalus. In Argentina, no congenital LCMV infections were reported among 288 healthy mothers and their infants. However, one study found that two of 95 children in a home for people with severe mental disabilities had been infected with this virus. The prognosis for severely affected infants appears to be poor. In one series, 35% of infants diagnosed with congenital infections had died by the age of 21 months. Transplant-acquired lymphocytic choriomeningitis proves to have a very high morbidity and mortality rate. In the three clusters reported in the U.S. from 2005 to 2010, nine of the ten infected recipients died. One donor had been infected from a recently acquired pet hamster while the sources of the virus in the other cases were unknown. Epidemiology LCMV has been isolated from fleas, ticks, cockroaches and Culicoides and Aedes mosquitoes. Ticks, lice and mosquitoes have been shown to transmit this virus mechanically in the laboratory. The presence of LCMV in laboratories may cause serious long-term repercussions to worker safety. In 1989, an outbreak among humans occurred in a US cancer research institute that studied the effects of various therapeutic and diagnostic agents in animal models. Such agents had been developed in the animal care facility, which periodically screened sentinel animals for extraneous infection. Due to an oversight, no sentinel animals were monitored from August 1988 to March 1989. When testing resumed, LCMV antibodies were found in the oldest sentinel hamsters. Several workers reported symptoms consistent with LCMV infection, leading to an investigation. Blood samples were obtained and tested for LCMV antibodies. Of the 82 workers that were tested, seven had definite serologic evidence of past LCMV infection, and two were hospitalized for an acute febrile illness. All seven reported direct contact with the animals at the institute. An additional hazard associated with LCMV in laboratories misleading experimental results. Interference with research may involve: : [Inhibition of] tumor induction due to polyoma virus, and mammary tumor virus in the mouse, and [interference] with transplantable leukaemia in the guinea pig and the mouse. Infection is associated with depression of cellular immunity in the mouse. Rejection of cutaneous grafts or transplantable tumors may be delayed. In addition, infection will increase the sensitivity of the mouse to ectromelia virus and to bacterial endotoxins. Reported outbreaks have decreased, perhaps due to improved biohazard management in laboratories. However, it is possible that sporadic cases have been overlooked because of the wide range of clinical presentations. Clare A. Dykewicz, et al. recommend vigilant screening laboratory animals to be used in research facilities either through serum samples or cell line aliquots, as well as ensuring adequate ventilation in housing areas and use of appropriate sanitation products. Other practices to reduce cross-contamination in rodents include washing hands or changing gloves between animal care activities, thoroughly decontaminating cages before reusing them, and avoiding housing healthy rodents in the vicinity of potentially infected rodents. Other animals Although the house mouse (Mus musculus) is the primary reservoir host for LCMV, it is also often found in the wood mouse (Apodemus sylvaticus) and the yellow-necked mouse (Apodemus flavicollis). Hamster populations can act as reservoir hosts. Other rodents including guinea pigs, rats and chinchillas can be infected but do not appear to maintain the virus. LCMV has been shown to cause illness in New World primates such as macaques, marmosets and tamarins. Infections have also been reported in rabbits, dogs and pigs. After experimental inoculation, the incubation period in adult mice is 5 to 6 days. Congenitally or neonatally infected mice and hamsters do not become symptomatic for several months or longer. Mice A house mouse Mus musculus A study conducted by John Hotchin and Heribert Weigand, of the New York State Department of Health, concluded, \\"The age of the mouse when first exposed to the virus determines its immune response.\\" If LCMV infection occurs in utero or within the first few hours of life, during the immunologically unresponsive period, the mouse will develop immune tolerance. The virus will continue to proliferate for an indefinite time. However, if a mouse is infected after the neonatal period, when the immune system is responsive, the immune response is active. This immunological conflict can result in one of three ways; immunological paralysis, significant or complete suppression of virus with immunity to reinfection, or death. Mice that are infected after the neonatal period often pass through a \\"runt\\" stage, which may last for several weeks. Clinical symptoms include excitability, weight loss, and severe retardation of growth and hair development. In general, as the period of time between birth and inoculation decreases, less disease and mortality occurs. Post mortem lesions in mice show signs of hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, lymphaden opathy, and swollen or shrunken and pitted kidneys due to glomerulonephritis. Histological findings in persistently infected mice often show chronic glomerulonephritis. In these mice, and some hamsters, vasculitis and lymphocytic infiltrates in many organs and tissues including the liver, spleen, lung, kidneys, pancreas, blood vessels, meninges and brain are present. Hamsters Pathogenesis occurs in the same manner in hamsters as in mice.Vilches, Jose MD ed. Pam Mouser, MD. \\"Lymphocytic Choriomeningitis.\\" Symptoms in hamsters are highly variable, and typically indicate that the pet has been infected and shedding the virus for several months. Early signs may include inactivity, loss of appetite, and a rough coat. As the disease progresses, the animal may experience weight loss, hunched posture, inflammation around the eyes, and eventually death. Alternatively, some infected hamsters may be asymptomatic.CDC. \\"Lymphocytic Choriomeningitis Virus from Pet Rodents.\\" Rats Experimental intracerebral infection of suckling rats results in microcephaly, retinitis and the destruction of several brain regions, leading to permanent abnormalities of movement, coordination, vision and behavior. Primates LCMV causes callitrichid hepatitis in New World primates. The onset of the infection is nonspecific and may include fever, anorexia, dyspnea, weakness and lethargy. Jaundice is characteristic and petechial hemorrhages may develop. Prostration and death usually follow. Necropsy lesions in primates with callitrichid hepatitis show signs of jaundice, hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, and subcutaneous and intramuscular hemorrhages. Pleural and pericardial effusion, sometimes sanguineous, has also been reported. On histology, multifocal necrosis with acidophilic bodies and mild inflammatory infiltrates are typically found in the liver. Diagnosis As in humans, the sensitivity of testing methods for rodents contributes to the accuracy of diagnosis. LCMV is typically identified through serology. However, in an endemically infected colony, more practical methods include MAP (mouse antibody production) and PCR testing. Another means of diagnosis is introducing a known na√Øve adult mouse to the suspect rodent colony. The introduced mouse will seroconvert, allowing use of immunofluorescence antibody (IFA), MFIA or ELISA to detect antibodies.Charles River Laboratories International. \\"Lymphocytic Choriomeningitis Virus.\\" Treatment Immunosuppressive therapy has been effective in halting the disease for laboratory animals. Morbidity and mortality LCMV infections are focal Estimates of its prevalence in wild mouse populations range from 0% to 60%, with an average prevalence of 9%. The incidence of LCMV in pet rodents is unknown, yet very few human cases have been associated with exposure to pets. In the transplant-associated cases linked to a pet hamster in 2005, two other hamsters and a guinea pig at the pet shop, and approximately 4% of the hamsters at the distributor, were also infected. Morbidity and mortality rates vary with the species of animal and its age at infection, as well as the strain of the virus and route of exposure. Neonatally and congenitally infected mice remain asymptomatic for many months, but the onset of glomerulonephritis reduces overall life expectancy. The morbidity rate in naturally infected post-neonatal mice is unknown; however, subclinical disease may be the most common form, as few natural outbreaks have been reported. In hamsters, approximately half of all congenitally infected animals clear the virus when they are approximately three months old and remain healthy; the remaining animals develop chronic disease. Hamsters infected as adults usually remain asymptomatic. Callitrichid hepatitis is reported to be highly fatal in naturally infected marmosets and tamarins in zoos. Since 1980, 12 outbreaks with 57 deaths have been reported in the U.S. In experimentally infected rhesusmacaques, three of four animals became fatally ill when inoculation was by the intravenous route. In contrast, inoculation by the intragastric route usually led to asymptomatic infections, with occasional disease and few deaths. In pets Pet rodents are not known to be natural reservoirs for lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus. However, pets can become vectors if they are exposed to wild house mice in a breeding facility, pet store, or home. Such infections are rare. To date, (January 2017) documented infections in humans have occurred only after introduction to infected mice, guinea pigs, and hamsters, with the majority of cases transmitted by mice. LCMV infection in other animals, including zoo animals, may be possible. In choosing a pet, the CDC advises looking for general indications of health both in the prospective pet and others in the facility. The rodent of choice should be lively and alert, have a glossy coat, breathe normally and have no discharge from eyes or nose. If one of the animals in the facility looks ill, the others may have been exposed, and none of the rodents at that location should be purchased. Serologic testing is not recommended for pet rodents, as it has been unreliable in detecting antibodies in animals with active infections. For laboratory purposes, immunohistochemistry staining of tissues and virus isolation are used for more accurate testing, but this is unnecessary for the general house pet. The greatest risk of infection to humans occurs shortly after purchase of a pet, so that exposure to the virus, if present, has likely already occurred to existing pet owners. Continued ownership poses negligible additional risk. The National Center for Infectious Disease suggests the following precautions to reduce the risk of LCMV infection: :*Wash hands with soap and water after handling pet rodents; use waterless alcohol-based hand rubs when soap is not available. :*Keep rodent cages clean and free of soiled bedding. :*Clean the cage in a well-ventilated area or outside. :*Wash hands thoroughly with soap and water after cleaning up pet droppings. Closely supervise young children, especially those less than five years old, when cleaning cages, and make sure they wash their hands immediately after handling rodents and rodent caging or bedding. :*Do not kiss pet rodents or hold them close to your face. Rodent owners who no longer wish to keep their pet should consult a veterinarian. Pets should not be released into the wild for humane, legal, and ecological reasons. After a rodent has been purchased, it should not be returned to the pet store as it may have been exposed to LCMV through house mice.  Research  LCM is the archetypal arenavirus, and was instrumental in research which uncovered the major pathogenetic mechanisms of all arenaviruses. The field of viral immunology will continue to be uncovered by the model system of LCMV. Specifically, the study of persistent viral infections as well as vaccine development, represent two essential areas. LCMV is already identified as the best model to examine the difference between acute and viral infection in its natural host Mus musculus, the common house mouse. Conveniently, the mouse is also the most widely used genetic model for mammalian genetics. A major phenotypic difference results from only two nucleotide differences between acute LCMV, also known as Armstrong LCMV, and one of its variant, Clone 13, which leads to persistent LCMV infection. One of the nucleotide mutations is in the process of glycoprotein formation and affects tropism. The second base pair mutation affects the polymerase which influences replicative capacity. The mechanism of these mutations and how they confer such a profound physiological difference, acute versus chronic LCMV infection is yet to be understood. An important aspect of the present modern society is the thorough understanding of the burden of cancer. In many ways, this disease mirrors persistent viral infection, in the way that it evades and progresses despite the immune system's effort to eliminate it. The LCMV model will be a great path towards advancements in cancer studies. Furthermore, LCMV has been a widely used model system for understanding T cell memory and vaccine synthesis. It was the original model when first studied focused on CD-8 T cells response towards LCMV infection. In addition, a better understanding of CD-4 T cell memory is also a result of studies with LCMV and will continue to contribute to a more efficient mechanism of vaccine formation. Specifically, LCMV has been recently used to quantify the efficiency of a new hydrogen peroxide-based vaccine formation mechanism. The future enhancement of the field of vaccinology will greatly depend on the LCMV model system. LCMV is a prototype of more severe hemorrhagic fever viruses, especially Lassa virus with the greatest prevalence in sub-Saharan Africa. However, other strains of this virus ( Junin and Machupo viruses) are present in parts of South America and other strains continue to significantly affect the southern African population. Since the modern society continue to become a more inter-connected world, the spread of these virus strains will continue to pose a severe threat around the globe. Understanding the biology of the LCMV model virus will help in advancing the understanding of this important class of viruses and more specifically will give insight into the biology of the Lassa virus which proves to be a growing threat around the world. Furthermore, the United States National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) has appointed the family of arenaviridae to be \\"Category A Priority Pathogens\\". This translates to the highest level of importance for the high potential for morbidity and mortality from an infectious agent which is relatively easy to produce and transmit. All in all, the fast advancements in the potential experiments with the LCMV model system will guide future investigators towards the enrichment of biomedical research.

It is a Canadian company based in Toronto that focuses on integrated communications as a provider of data, e-business and voice services to business and households. It used to be known as Sprint Canada Inc., pursuant to a 1993 branding agreement between parent Call-Net Enterprises Inc. with what is now Sprint Nextel Corporation. In 1998, Call-Net acquired long-distance service and data-circuit provider Fonorola of Montreal for about $1.8 billion and merged it into Sprint Canada. On May 11, 2005, Rogers Communications Inc. and Call-Net jointly announced that they entered into an agreement under which RCI would acquire 100% of Call-Net under a plan of arrangement (). The deal was approved by shareholders and an Ontario court on June 30, 2005, and completed July 1. The deal allowed Rogers to enter the residential phone business to challenge Bell Canada. On July 7, 2005, Sprint Canada Inc. became Rogers Telecom Inc. and Call-Net Enterprises Inc. became Rogers Telecom Holdings Inc. History Sprint Canada was launched in the early 1990s with Candice Bergen as its spokesperson. Bergen also was pitching the products of their U.S. sister company. CallNet licensed the name Sprint from the United States Sprint Corporation up until it was bought out and renamed by Rogers Communications. Home Phone service=Current The Rogers Home Phone service in Canada was launched on July 1, 2005, on the same day that Rogers Telecom was acquired by Rogers Communications Inc. The current offering is VoIP technology using Rogers's Internet cable. A special converter offers home-phone service with traditional RJ11 telephone-line jacks within the house. The VoIP service is currently available in regions served by Rogers Hi-Speed Internet. This service operates using the PacketCable technology over the company's cable network. Service is delivered by cable to the subscriber's residence and is connected into a home-phone terminal, which then provides the connection to the internal wiring at the address. The home-phone terminal has a six-hour backup and can support up to two different phone numbers. Legacy (2005-2010) The landline service, which was available from mid-2005 to mid-2010, operated switches co-located in the Bell Canada network. As such, Rogers did not maintain the phone lines and was affected by the Bell Subco strike of 2005, which impaired its ability to provide timely service. The same also applied to the Telus strike in Alberta and British Columbia. During the time of the local strikes, Rogers Telecom was not able to provide exact installation dates in those two provinces. Due to legal obligations, however, Rogers's customers received higher-priority service during strikes than actual Bell Canada or Telus customers. Rogers wanted to discontinue its traditional voice services by the end of 2008. For this reason, Rogers's customers with this service were sent a notice in June 2008. They could either switch to Rogers's VoIP home phone or have their accounts automatically cancelled. However, Rogers did not take these steps until August 2010, when Rogers partnered with Primus Canada. The latter company now manages all traditional home-phone accounts formerly served by Rogers.

In May 2005, it became public knowledge that she had been deported, although DIMIA knew of its mistake in 2003. Solon's family had listed her as a missing person since July 2003, and until May 2005, did not know that she had been deported. The circumstances surrounding Solon's unlawful deportation have caused much controversy in the Australian media. In October 2005, a report on Solon's deportation was released, following an inquiry conducted by former Victoria Police commissioner Neil Comrie. The report revealed that several senior DIMIA officials in Canberra knew about Solon's unlawful deportation in 2003 and 2004, and failed to act. It also found that Solon's mental and physical health problems were not given proper attention. Solon has since returned to Australia on 18 November 2005. Background Vivian Alvarez Solon was born in the Philippines on 30 October 1962. On 26 May 1984, she married an Australian man, Robert Young, in the Philippines. She then changed her name to Vivian Solon Young. The two moved to Brisbane, Queensland, where Solon was naturalised as an Australian on 3 March 1986. In 1990, the couple separated, and they divorced in 1993. After the divorce, she changed her name back to Vivian Alvarez Solon.McMillan, John: Inquiry into the Circumstances of the Vivian Alvarez Matter, Office of the Commonwealth Ombudsman, September 2005. Between 1995 and 2000, Solon received treatment for mental health issues. She was diagnosed as suffering from a paranoid psychotic condition, which affected her behaviour. During this time she developed a minor criminal record with the Queensland Police, and was at one point taken into protective custody by police in Brisbane, who were worried about the effects of her mental condition. On one occasion, her fingerprints were recorded and entered into the national law enforcement database, CrimTrac. Deportation from Australia According to a police report, Solon had left her five-year-old son at the Brisbane City Hall childcare facility on 16 February 2001, but did not return to pick him up. Queensland Premier, Peter Beattie revealed on 6 May 2005, that her son, by then nine, has been in foster care since. At 11:47pm on the night of 30 March, ambulance services were called to a park in Lismore, in the far north of New South Wales. They found Solon next to an open drain in the park, suffering from head injuries. She also had difficulty moving her legs. She had most likely sustained these injuries after falling into the drain, although some media reports speculated that she had been in a car accident. To this day she claims she was knocked off a pushbike by a passing car, but the medical view has always been that she was physically assaulted . She was taken to Lismore Base Hospital, where she was treated for her injuries. She was soon moved to the psychiatric ward because she was behaving aggressively towards hospital staff, presumably due to her head injuries. A social worker Guing Coop who visited Solon at the hospital identified that she was of Filipino background, and suspected that she was an illegal immigrant. On this basis the social worker contacted the local branch of the Department of Immigration, Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs. DIMIA officers first interviewed Solon on 3 May 2001. According to the Comrie report, the officers presumed that Solon was an illegal immigrant, and did not do proper background checks. On 12 July, Solon was transferred from the hospital to DIMIA custody, and taken to a motel in Brisbane. She told the officials that she was an Australian citizen, and did not want to leave the country, however she was ignored. On 17 July, Queensland Police officially listed Solon as a missing person, several months after she had failed to collect her son from childcare. However, this information was not picked up by DIMIA. A representative from the Philippines consulate in Brisbane visited Solon on 18 July. In the meeting Solon said that she had been married to an Australian man, a Mr Young, but this information was not passed on to DIMIA. The consulate refused to issue Solon with travel documents, because they did not consider her fit enough to travel (she was in a wheelchair at the time), and so DIMIA arranged for a different doctor to visit her. This doctor declared her fit to fly, and signed the medical certificate allowing Solon to be deported. On 20 July Solon was escorted onto a plane by Queensland Police, and flown to Manila. Handed over to Qantas ground staff at the airport, she was eventually taken to a hospice run by the Catholic Church. Discovery In July 2003, the Missing Persons Bureau in Queensland contacted DIMIA with an enquiry about Solon, who had been listed as a missing person for two years. Two DIMIA officers in Canberra conducted searches of records, and made a match between Vivian Solon (as she was known to the missing persons authorities) and Vivian Alvarez (as she was known to DIMIA ‚Äì Alvarez is her middle name). They told their supervisor (referred to in the Comrie Report as officer 'A') on 14 July that an Australian citizen had been deported, but the supervisor did nothing. On 20 August 2003, an episode of the television program Without A Trace was aired, which contained a Crime Stoppers segment, with information about Solon and her photograph, at the conclusion of the program. One of the officers in Canberra (referred to in the Comrie Report as officer 'E') again told the supervisor, who again did nothing. At the same time, a DIMIA officer in Brisbane who had worked on Solon's case in 2001 also saw the Crime Stoppers segment, and informed her supervisor. That supervisor also did nothing. Officer 'E' decided to approach the Missing Persons Bureau directly. In September 2003, the Bureau approached the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT) for help in searching for Solon. DFAT informed the Bureau that Solon had traveled to the Philippines. Eventually Solon's former husband, Robert Young, was informed where Solon was. Throughout early 2004, Young persisted in questioning the Bureau, until it eventually decided to contact DIMIA. The Bureau was put through to officer 'A' in Canberra (who had already been told twice of Solon's unlawful deportation). Officer 'A' then contacted the Brisbane office, and learned that other people there knew about the error made. However again no action was taken, and the Minister for Immigration at the time, Philip Ruddock, was not informed. On 4 April 2005, Young contacted the new Minister for Immigration, Senator Amanda Vanstone, directly. Vanstone's office inquired into the case, and discovered what had happened to Solon. Solon's DIMIA case file was not stored with the normal case files, and was instead found separately, in the desk of one of officer 'A's subordinates. Vanstone then ordered the Australian Federal Police (AFP), in cooperation with the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) in the Philippines, to locate Solon. NBI chief Ricardo Diaz reported on Lateline on 6 May 2005, that their search was unsuccessful after three weeks. Mr Diaz also claimed that the AFP was not forthcoming with information to locate Ms Solon. While watching the news on ABC Asia Pacific, Catholic priest Father Mike Duffin, an Australian from Saint Vincent's Parish Church, watched reports about the hunt for Vivian Solon and wondered if the reports may have referred to a Vivian that was brought to the Mother Teresa Sisters, Missionaries of Charity, in Olongapo City by Australian representatives four years ago. He recognised her from the photo that was used in the report. Father Duffin was surprised that the Australian Government was unaware of her location. Duffin said: > \\"They are the ones who told her before she left Australia she was coming to > the mission, coming to Mother Teresa Sisters, and then when they brought > her, they left her at the Mother Teresa Sisters, Missionaries of Charity.\\" > \\"So I find it very hard that they don't know where they left her, do they > have no records or do people forget things as soon as they do them?\\" However, Senator Vanstone disputed Father Duffin's claims of prior knowledge by the Australian Government. She informed the media on 12 May 2005 that immigration records had no mention of Ms Solon being brought to a convent. Instead, her records showed that she was met at the airport by a woman from the Overseas Workers Welfare Association. Ms Vanstone also revealed that the files also showed that there was mention of a discussion with Solon on the possibility of her making contact with some nuns. Following identification of Vivian Solon at the Mother Teresa Sisters, Missionaries of Charity, the Australian Government sent consular officials to confirm her identity. Senator Vanstone announced that if Ms Solon wished to return to Australia, the Australian Government would provide assistance for her to do so. There was speculation in the media that Solon did not want to return to Australia. Media controversy An anonymous senior immigration official reported to Lateline that Solon's situation was due to a systemic problem in the Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs. Lateline reported that the official said: > \\"In the compliance area, people on the whole are a bunch of cowboys, under > so much pressure to deport people. All proper processes have broken down. > They put their energy into picking up people and deporting them without > proper investigation.\\" The social worker who was one of the last people given access to Ms Solon before her deportation said she had requested from Immigration the grounds for Solon's deportation. > \\"This one, it just really baffled me because they said they couldn't find > any paperwork or documentation about her.\\" While being escorted back to Manila by Australian Embassy officials on 13 May 2005, Ms Solon revealed that she was unaware that she had been deported. According to Solon, she was informed by Australian officials that she had to be sent to Philippines for treatment, and received travel assistance from them. She also indicated that she had informed Immigration Officers that she had an Australian passport, but was not carrying it at that time. Lateline confirmed with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade on 14 May 2005 that Ms Solon had been issued a passport, valid at the time she was deported. Since Ms Solon has been an Australian, she was issued three passports, and had traveled on an Australian passport for ten years. Her last passport was issued in November 2000, but never collected. Comrie inquiry The Solon case was initially referred to the Palmer Inquiry, which was set up to inquire into the unlawful detention of Cornelia Rau in an immigration facility. Senator Vanstone decided that the case should be inquired into separately, and instructed the Commonwealth Ombudsman, Professor John McMillan, to hold an investigation. The Ombudsman appointed Neil Comrie, former Commissioner of the Victoria Police, to conduct the investigation. Criticism of the inquiry The decision to hold a non-judicial inquiry was criticised by certain groups, who did not believe that it had sufficient powers to compel witnesses to testify. Dr Sev Ozdowski, a commissioner on the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission, called for a Royal Commission into Solon's case, saying: > \\"It certainly warrants an open inquiry which can get all of the facts, it > warrants an inquiry which would allow witnesses to come forward, which would > provide protection to witnesses and it warrants an inquiry which will have > access to all relevant documents. > \\"So, it could be a judicial inquiry, it could be a Royal Commission, it > could be some other form of inquiry but it's important that it's an > independent inquiry with access to both witnesses and information.\\" Premier of Queensland Peter Beattie had also written to Prime Minister John Howard calling for a Royal Commission into Solon's deportation, and the detention of Cornelia Rau. According to Beattie, the framework of the Palmer inquiry did not provide sufficient legal protection, leading to the refusal of twelve Corrective Services staff to give testimony. On 12 May 2005, Australian Democrats Senator Andrew Bartlett, with the support of the Australian Greens and the Australian Labor Party (ALP), initiated a debate in the Australian Senate for a judicial inquiry or Royal Commission into the operation and administration of mandatory detention, deportation and enforcement. The government expressed a belief that was not necessary to rush into a judicial inquiry then, as the facts of the matters had not been determined by the Palmer Inquiry. Report of the inquiry The report was completed on 26 September 2005, and was released on 6 October. The report was strongly critical of DIMIA, concluding that a combination of incompetence, inadequate training, improper data systems and poor management led to Solon's deportation. The report found that DIMIA had not investigated Solon's case properly before it decided to deport her. The only evidence in Solon's file which seemed to indicate that she was not legally in Australia was a handwritten note, which was not dated or signed by anyone, which stated: > \\"Smuggled into Australia as a sex slave. Wants to return to the Philippines. > Has been physically abused.\\" The inquiry concluded that DIMIA officials had simply acted on unfounded assumptions about Solon, rather than discovering real evidence. They assumed that Solon's surname was Alvarez (actually her middle name) and conducted their initial searches based on this name. As such, they found no record of her. There were eleven different spellings used by various officials, which also led to confusion. The initial investigation did not take into account the fact that Solon had been treated in the psychiatric ward in Lismore, which might have explained inconsistencies in evidence she gave to DIMIA officials. Some key recommendations of the inquiry were: * that the negative culture in the Compliance division of DIMIA be redressed; * that DIMIA should review its information systems; * that all staff should be instructed to take more care when performing their duties, and not act on the basis of assumptions; * that all immigration detainees should be provided with adequate healthcare services. The report also reaffirmed a number of the recommendations of the Palmer inquiry. Response to the report Following the release of the report, Senator Vanstone announced that A$50.3 million would be spent on a College of Immigration, Border Security and Compliance in order to train DIMIA staff. A$17.9 million would also be spent on improving healthcare services at immigration facilities. Labor spokesperson for immigration, Tony Burke called for Senator Vanstone to take responsibility for Solon's deportation, under the doctrine of ministerial responsibility. However, Vanstone refused to resign, saying that the general presumption was that ministers should not be responsible for things they did not know about. She also said: > \\"I'm thinking of trying to buy the copyright on Elton John's song 'I'm Still > Standing', but I don't want to tempt fate. So I'll just play it to myself > quietly at night.\\" Compensation claims Before Ms Solon's return to Australia, there was speculation in both the media and in the legal community about the possibility of a compensation claim being brought by her against the Commonwealth Government and/or the Department of Immigration. Sydney-based lawyer George Newhouse brought a legal team together including former Federal Court Judge and Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission president Marcus Einfeld Q.C. and lawyer Harry Freedman, who travelled to Manila to discuss legal options with the Solon family. Terry O'Gorman, President of the Australian Council for Civil Liberties defended the urgency of legal action. He said: > Only the Federal Government having to pay out money and having to defend a > court case will bring home to the Federal Immigration Minister, and the > Prime Minister, that rights and principles are there to be observed. > Criticism of this government over its immigration policy is simply waived > away; only when they have to pay money will they sit up and take notice. On Solon's return to Australia on 18 November 2005, Marcus Einfeld Q.C. confirmed that her compensation would be determined by retired High Court Judge Sir Anthony Mason after she and her legal team had reached agreement on the form of a private arbitration. As part of the deal the Commonwealth Government confirmed that it would care for Solon until the arbitration process was completed. On 30 November 2006, Mason awarded Solon a compensation payout, reported by The Age newspaper as A$4.5 million, although the Australian Government refused to confirm the amount, citing privacy reasons.

The Jebal Ali Port is located there. Al Maktoum International Airport has been constructed just outside the port area. Jebel Ali is connected to Dubai via the UAE Exchange (formerly Jebel Ali), Danube (formerly Jebel Ali Industrial) and Energy stations on the Dubai Metro. Among the infrastructure projects built to support the port and town is the world's largest desalination plant, the Jebel Ali Desalination Plant (Phase 2), providing an ample supply of fresh water. History Many Arab historians argue that it was named after Ali ibn Abi Talib who was the cousin and son-in-law of Muhammad while expanding the Islamic Caliphate had stood on one hill and looked towards the sea and perhaps supplicated as well although no such recorded proof has been found. \\"Jebel\\" means Mountain in Arabic. On 23 September 1983, Gulf Air Flight 771 crashed in Jebel Ali killing all 112 people on board. The cause of the crash was a terrorist bomb that had been planted on board the aircraft by the Abu Nidal Organization. Jebel Ali Port Jebel Ali has become the port most frequently visited by ships of the United States Navy outside the United States. Due to the depth of the harbour and size of the port facilities, a and several ships of the accompanying battle group can be accommodated pierside. Due to the frequency of these port visits, semi-permanent shore-leave facilities (referred to by US Navy service personnel as \\"The Sandbox\\") have been erected adjacent to the carrier berth. Jebel Ali Free Zone In 1985, the Jebel Ali Free Zone (JAFZA) was created: an industrial area surrounding the port. International companies that relocate there enjoy the special privileges of the free zone. These include exemption from corporate tax for 50 years, no personal income tax, no import or re- export duties, no restriction on currency, and easy labour recruitment.

In April 2016 Vanderbilt University and VUMC became separate organizations legally and financially. The two organizations cooperate, and VUMC clinicians continue to serve as faculty members at Vanderbilt University School of Medicine and Vanderbilt University School of Nursing.Fletcher, Holly. VUMC's split ushers in 'bright' era of change, growth. Tennessean, April 30, 2016.  Rankings and awards  VUMC was ranked as the best hospital in Tennessee in the 2014 annual ranking by U.S. News & World Report. In the 2014 annual rankings by the magazine, the following VUMC specialty programs were nationally ranked: Cancer; Ear, Nose and Throat; Nephrology; Neurology and Neurosurgery; Pulmonology; and Urology. High performing specialty programs were: Cardiology and Heart Surgery; Diabetes and Endocrinology; Gastroenterology; Geriatrics; Gynecology; and Orthopaedics. Vanderbilt University was named in Fortune's \\"100 Best Companies to Work For\\" list for 2009. More than 80% of the university's employees work for the Medical Center. The other rankings VUMC has achieved include being listed in the 100 Top Hospitals by Truven Health Analytics; being listed as among the nation's 100 \\"Most Wired\\" hospitals by the American Hospital Association; and listed as one of the \\"100 Great Hospitals in America\\" by Becker's Hospital Review. Vanderbilt is also the home of BioVU, one of the world's largest DNA databanks, which holds more than 170,000 samples and is used to discover new genetic predictors of disease and drug action by scientists worldwide. The center has also hosted an award since 2006, the Vanderbilt Prize in Biomedical Science, which honors \\"women who have made significant contributions to the science of medicine\\". Controversies As of March 2014, the institution is being sued by the federal government in a whistle-blower case for a decade-long Medicare fraud scheme. In May 2015, a federal court ruled Vanderbilt University Medical Center was in violation of the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification (WARN) Act for laying off 200 employees without adequate notice and will have to pay out $400,000 pending an appeal. Finally, the university admitted one of its scientists fraudulently falsified six years of biomedical research in high-profile journals.  Monroe Carell Jr. Children's Hospital  Monroe Carell Jr. Children's Hospital at Vanderbilt The Vanderbilt Children's Hospital has been in operation since the 1970s, but was housed in the main Vanderbilt hospital until 2004. Monroe J. Carell, Jr., former CEO of Central Parking Corporation, raised $79 million for the construction of a new stand-alone facility, including $20 million from his family's personal donations and additional money secured through fundraising efforts. History Vanderbilt faculty have won two Nobel Prizes in Physiology or Medicine. In 1971 Earl Sutherland, Jr., received the prize for his discovery of Cyclic AMP. Stanley Cohen received a Nobel in 1986, as he shared the award with Rita Levi-Montalcini of Italy for their discovery of epidermal growth factor, a hormone that can speed up certain biological processes. Some other important research firsts from Vanderbilt's history: *In 1933, Alfred Blalock and his research assistant Vivien Thomas conducted pioneering research leading to the first cardiothoracic surgery for infants born with \\"blue baby syndrome\\". Thomas and Blalock's work was essential to the development of open heart surgery. *In the early 1940s, Ernest Goodpasture developed the method of culturing vaccines in chick embryos, which allowed the mass production of vaccines to prevent viral diseases worldwide.Jacobson, 222. *In the 1950s, Amos U. Christie, chair of pediatrics, led a team that achieved worldwide notice for pioneering work in histoplasmosis. Patient care Vanderbilt operates the only Level 1 Trauma Center, the only Level 4 Neonatal Intensive Care Unit and the only Level 3 Burn Unit in its region. (Each of those levels represents the highest in its field.) The LifeFlight helicopter ambulance service has eight helicopters, operated by Air Methods but staffed with Vanderbilt Flight Paramedics and Nurses, and an airplane transport and makes more than 2,800 flights a year. Vanderbilt also offers an organ transplantation center. Vanderbilt's first kidney transplant was in 1962; since then there have been more than 3,000 kidneys transplanted at Vanderbilt. VUMC has also had more than 2000 liver transplants and 600 heart and lung transplants. Among Vanderbilt's other transplant milestones were Tennessee's first pancreas transplant in 1985, the first successful heart-lung transplant in the state in 1987, the first pediatric heart transplant in the state in 1987, and the first triple organ transplant of heart, lungs and liver in 2000. The Vanderbilt-Ingram Cancer Center is one of 50 National Cancer Institute-designated cancer centers, and the only one in Tennessee that provides treatment for adult and pediatric cancers. The center is also a member of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network, a non-profit alliance of 21 centers focused on improving quality and efficiency of cancer care. Research VUMC ranks in the top 10 among the 126 medical schools in the United States in receipt of research funding from the National Institutes of Health Education Both the Vanderbilt University School of Medicine and the Vanderbilt University School of Nursing rank in the top 20 in the U.S. News & World Report rankings. The School of Medicine was founded in 1874. The School of Nursing was founded in 1908. It became a part of the Medical Center in 1984. The School of Nursing phased out its undergraduate nursing degree in 1989, becoming exclusively a graduate school with a mission of educating advanced-level nurses.

Generally these projects involve tunneling, caisson excavation, road building, or some other type of underground construction or mining projects. The miners work with a variety of equipment from tunnel boring machines to explosives to remove material for the project they are building. The term is an American colloquialism. Starting with their first job in 1872, the Brooklyn Bridge, the \\"hogs\\" have built a large part of the New York City infrastructure including the subway tunnels and sewers, Water Tunnels No. 1 and No. 2 as well as the currently under construction Water Tunnel No. 3, the Lincoln, Holland, Queens- Midtown, and Brooklyn-Battery tunnels. In addition, they worked on the foundations for most of the bridges and many of the skyscrapers in the city. Many of these workers are Irish or Irish American and West Indian. Sandhogging is often a tradition and is passed down through generations of families; since mining projects span decades, it is not uncommon for multi-generations of families to work together on the same job.  Appearances in media  *In the October 1997 issue of Esquire magazine, a series of photographs by David Allee, with a text accompaniment by Thomas Kelly, document the life and work of sandhogs.

Banister as a young man, posed for a \\"tin type\\" photograph. John Riley Banister with Luther Alred (Oklahoma, November 11, 1911) John Riley Banister (May 24, 1854 ‚Äì 1918) was an American law officer, cowboy and Texas Ranger. Early years Banister was born in Banister Hollow, a small settlement located in Camden County, Missouri, which was to become a local hub or center for surrounding communities. His parents were William Lawrence and Mary (Buchanan) Banister. According to biographical sources, all the Banisters were musicians and played fiddle, banjo, guitar and other instruments. They also sang long ballads and played Irish and Scottish jigs and reels. Around 1863 John's father, after being wounded twice while serving in the Confederate Army, did not return home and instead moved to Texas and married Mary Catherine Miller, a young woman of mixed Anglo-Saxon and Native American descent, with whom he had six other children. Whether or not William had formally ended his marriage with Buchanan prior to marrying Miller is a fact not noted in any historical record. Move to Texas What inspired Banister to leave Banister Hollow is not clear, although oral history suggests that it was in part due to his mother's unhappiness and abusive treatment from an uncle named Argiles Hicks. Further anecdotal evidence suggests that the wild, chaotic nature of the region was also an influence, as, according to Leona Bruce, mobs and guerillas were a constant threat. Furthermore, the attraction to the West, the land where Banister's father had gone before, may have been the strongest impetus. Banister, at age thirteen, along with his brother, Will (who was named after their father) decided to leave their home to seek out their father in Texas. Not having a map or any kind of predefined route, one Spring night in 1867 the two boys did not return home from hunting at the Niangua River. This timing was chosen because the boys understood that their leaving would not have been permitted by their family and their grandfather would have followed them and punish them had he had sufficient warning. There is no historical or anecdotal record to suggest that the boys ever set foot in Banister Hollow again. Nor is there record to show how John and Will Banister traveled or what transpired during that time, although there is record of the boys asking other passing travelers at the earlier stages of their journey questions about how and where to cross the rivers, what kind of storms normally occurred in the Spring, how to plan a route and stay on track and where there might be danger from Native Americans. They traveled nearly six- hundred miles alone, armed with only a single rifle, a small amount of lead and powder, and a bag of Banister Hollow cornmeal. Four months after leaving Banister Hollow, the boys arrived in Fort Worth, Texas, a well-known town which was a source of supplies for settlements in the surrounding region. Adoption After arriving in Fort Worth, Banister and his brother, after inquiring after their father from many strangers, were befriended by a man named Colonel Rufus Winn, who was a Confederate veteran. Winn, who had two young children with his wife, Mary Elizabeth Vaughn, was touched by the boys' tale and was concerned for their safety. Not wanting them to join outlaws, Winn and his wife took them in. On the Rufus Winn ranch Banister assisted Winn with all manner of chores and duties, and within a short time became a vital family and community member. From cattle driving to catching outlaws After driving cattle for the Rufus Winn Ranch near Menardville and later the Sam Golson ranch in Coleman and Mason counties, Banister joined the Texas Rangers in Austin, Texas for Frontier Battalion service, which involved escorting murderer John Wesley Hardin to Comanche for trial, and later the capture of outlaw Sam Bass. After leaving ranger service in 1881, John Banister moved to San Saba and returned to cattle driving until 1883, making drives to Kansas. In 1883 Banister married Mary Ellen Walker and settled on a ranch near Brownwood. After moving to Coleman to run a livery stable, the couple had six children. Mrs. Banister died in 1892, and Banister married Emma Daugherty on September 25, 1894, in Goldthwaite. Banister and Daugherty had five children. Special assignment, field-inspection, sheriff Between 1889 and 1892, Banister accepted special assignments as a detective for the Santa Fe and other railroads. In 1892, he became a Treasury Agent assigned to help police the U.S.-Mexico border against cattle smugglers. After six years, he resigned and became inspector for the Texas Cattle Raisers Association (now the Texas and Southwestern Cattle Raisers Association). He originated the field- inspection service for the association and was its first chief. Banister investigated cattle rustling for the association in Texas, New Mexico, Kansas, and Oklahoma until 1914, when he became sheriff of Coleman County. Banister's career is documented by a collection of his papers in the Southwest Collection of Texas Tech University. Documents detailing his investigations of cattle theft are particularly valuable in detailing the longtime efforts of the cattlemen's association in protecting livestock. Banister died of a stroke on August 1, 1918, in Coleman, and was buried in Santa Anna. His wife then took over his job and in so doing became the first female sheriff in the United States.

Crocodile Lolong crocodile Lolong In early September 2011, local residents and veteran crocodile hunters caught a saltwater crocodile weighing in a local creek. The municipality planned to make the giant beast the centerpiece of an ecotourism park for species found in the marshlands. On November 9, 2011, the National Geographic Team confirmed that Lolong was the world's biggest crocodile. The crocodile was transferred at the Bunawan Eco-Park and Research Center in Barangay Consuelo. Villagers had witnessed the crocodile attack and kill a water buffalo, and they suspected it also killed a fisherman who went missing that summer. Experts from an area crocodile farm were called in to capture the wild animal, which destroyed four traps before a stronger one caught it. A hundred villagers were needed to drag the crocodile to a truck before a crane was used to put it in a truck. From there it was taken to a special cage where it was expected to be held until the ecotourism park was built around it. The crocodile was declared dead a few hours after flipping over in a pond with a bloated stomach on February 10, 2013. The crocodile, despite being responsible for many deadly attacks, was be mourned by residents of the town, as it was the only tourist attraction that kept the town from sulking in obscurity. Its remains is preserved to allow the municipality to keep its fame. Several other crocodiles roam the marshy areas on the outskirts of town, and villagers have been told to avoid the marshes at night.

Bell P-39 Repair Line. To step up its delivery of Speedy Bell P-39 \\"Airacobra\\" fighter airplanes to American pilots in the South Pacific, the Army Air Forces Air Service Command put American production line methods to work in its repair docks at McClellan Field, California. Two and one-half million dollars worth of airplanes were overhauled by civilian Air Service Command workers at Sacramento, California preparatory to being sent against the enemy. Memorial Plaque of McClellan AFB History For the vast majority of its operational lifetime, McClellan was a logistics and maintenance facility for a wide variety of military aircraft, equipment and supplies. Initially known as the Pacific Air Depot and Sacramento Air Depot, in 1939 the base was renamed for Major Hezekiah McClellan, a pioneer in arctic aeronautical tests. Born in 1894, he died on 25 May 1936 when his Consolidated P-30 which he was flight testing crashed near Centerville, Ohio. The depot went through several name changes, finishing its life in 1995 as the Sacramento Air Logistics Center (SALC). The SALC reported to the Air Force Logistics Command (AFLC) and later the Air Force Materiel Command (AFMC). In 1986, the U.S. Air Force established the McClellan Aviation Museum on what was then McClellan Air Force Base. The museum was later chartered by the National Museum of the United States Air Force. The United States Coast Guard previously operated Coast Guard Air Station Sacramento at McClellan AFB as a tenant activity, operating and maintaining several HC-130 Hercules aircraft. CGAS Sacramento continues to operate at McClellan following its closure as an Air Force Base and is the only remaining military aviation unit and installation on the airfield. In 1993, the base was selected by the Pentagon for closure. At first, McClellan was scratched from a list of bases to be closed, but that decision was faced with allegations that the Clinton administration was playing politics. The base was eventually selected for closure, and there were plans to offset the expected loss of $1.5 billion, and 11,000 jobs, to the California economy. The plan relied on privatization and other investment to offset the economic and employment losses. The base is now McClellan Business Park, a growing business enclave that hosts a diverse mix of companies spread across more than 8 million square feet of space of all types. This former military facility is now home to hundreds of private companies, as well as state, federal and local government agencies.https://www.mcclellanpark.com/About/History In 2005 the McClellan Aviation Museum changed its name to the Aerospace Museum of California. Various military aircraft sit on display inside one of the hangars, and many more are outside on the flightline. The museum has displays which highlight the mission of the base when it was active, as well as neighboring bases such as Beale AFB, Travis AFB and the since closed Mather AFB. The museum hosts educational programs to schools in the local area. In 2015 the Sacramento Bee reported that McClellan Airfield had been designated as a Superfund site, because the Environmental Protection Agency has identified 326 waste areas on the base.

Lectures Perspectives on Post-conflict Justice in the Lecture Series of the United Nations Audiovisual Library of International Law. Controversies=International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia While many felt that Bassiouni would become the first prosecutor of the ICTY, failure to secure the prosecutor position was blocked by the United Kingdom and has been attributed in part to a perception that he would \\"move too quickly to charge Serb and possibly Croatian leaders with war crimes\\".http://www.americanbarfoundation.org/uploads/cms/documents/rlfall06.pdf Many politicians feared that allowing Bassiouni to be a prosecutor of the ICTY would be a conflict of interest because many communities that were ethnically cleansed by Serb paramilitary forces were Bosnian Muslim villages, and because Bassiouni himself is a Muslim, born in the Middle East. One representative to the Security Council was reported saying that Bassiouni was \\"a fanatic who had too much information\\". In the initial vote count in the Security Council, Bassiouni was supported by seven countries, the United States being one of them, and was opposed by seven countries with one abstention. Lawsuits Bassiouni sued the FBI (No. 04-3888), which heard oral arguments in 2005. The case centered around information collected and maintained by the FBI about Bassiouni; in March 2001, upon receiving documents as a result of a request protected by the Freedom of Information Act, Bassiouni attempted to amend the documents, which ‚Äì according to Bassiouni ‚Äì wrongfully linked him with Palestine liberation forces and other paramilitary organizations. In a letter to the United States Department of Justice in 2002, Bassiouni argued that information retained by the FBI violated subsection (e)(7) of the Privacy Act of 1974, which states: \\"Each agency that maintains a system of records shall maintain no record describing how any individual exercises rights guaranteed by the First Amendment unless expressly authorized by statute or by the individual about whom the record is maintained or unless pertinent to and within the scope of an authorized law enforcement activity.\\" 5 U.S.C. ¬ß 552a(e)(7). The FBI denied Bassiouni's request to amend records in his name, and Bassiouni appealed the decision with the United States Department of Justice; however, the US DOJ affirmed the decision, stating that the records were exempt from the Privacy Act of 1974 pursuant to 5 U.S.C. ¬ß 552a(j)(2). Bassiouni appealed the DOJ's decision but the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals found in favor of the FBI. Bassiouni Commission  Bassiouni was appointed head of the Bahrain Independent Commission of Inquiry (BICI), known locally as the Bassiouni Commission, at the time of its establishment, 29 June 2011, by the King of Bahrain. On 9 August 2011, Nabeel Rajab, head of the Bahrain Centre for Human Rights, criticized Bassiouni in an open letter for statements he (Bassiouni) made in an 8 August 2011 interview with Reuters. In the interview, Bassiouni praised the cooperation that the BICI has received from the Interior Ministry and states that there was never a policy of excessive use of force.

Davis, born October 21, 1952) is a space artist known for his portrayals of space-related subjects. His work is characterised by attention to detail and authentic portrayals based on what is known of the subject. Chesley Bonestell, considered by many to be one of the most accomplished practitioners of the space art genre, critiqued Davis' early paintings and encouraged him to pursue an artistic career. Davis worked for the U. S. Geological Survey's branch of Astrogeologic Studies during the Apollo Lunar expeditions and has since painted many images for NASA. The NASA art included portrayals of interiors of giant space colonies, based on the work of Gerard O'Neill. He was part of the team of space artists gathered to provide the visual effects for the PBS series Cosmos by Carl Sagan. Later he painted the cover of Sagan's Pulitzer Prize‚Äìwinning book The Dragons of Eden. Other books by Carl Sagan including Don's work are Comet and Pale Blue Dot. Davis has made numerous paintings of impact events for publications and for NASA. In the early 1980s he created planetary texture maps for use in Jet Propulsion Laboratory computer graphic simulations of the Voyager encounters with the outer planets. During the 1980s and early 1990s Davis created models and film animations as part of the visual effects production teams for the PBS shows Planet Earth, Infinite Voyage, Space Age, and Life Beyond Earth with Timothy Ferris. He painted and filmed in 35 mm an animation of the Galileo probe entry into Jupiter for NASA Ames. Numerous sequences for Discovery Channel science shows such as Savage Sun and Cosmic Safari were later created using computer graphic animation methods. Animations done in immersive hemispheric formats for planetarium type domed theaters now form the balance of his work. Davis received an Emmy for his work on Cosmos, and the 2002 Klumpke-Roberts Award by the Astronomical Society of the Pacific for outstanding contributions to the public understanding and appreciation of astronomy. The asteroid 13330 Dondavis is named after him. In 2000 he was elected a Fellow in the International Association of Astronomical Artists.

It is the site of a uranium deposit, found in 1949, which has been mined. The area derives its name from an incident when a thief stole 750 ounces of gold from miners after getting them drunk with rum. Original uranium mine George Goyder noted an unidentified copper-like green ore in 1869 at \\"Giants Reef\\", which was later \\"rediscovered\\" and identified to be torbernite. In 1949, John Michael \\"Jack\\" White discovered torbernite in old nearby copper shafts. In 1952 the Australian Government funded the setting up of a mine and treatment plant to provide uranium oxide concentrate to the UK-US Combined Development Agency under a contract which ran from 1953 to 1962. Rum Jungle was then the largest construction in the Northern Territory. The Government, through the Australian Atomic Energy Commission, was responsible for the mine, although management of it was on a contract basis by Territory Enterprises Pty Limited, a subsidiary of the Rio Tinto Group. A town called Batchelor was built 8 km south of the mine to accommodate the mining personnel. The project was officially opened in September 1954. Pollution and cleanup The Rum Jungle mine closed in April 1971 and the 200 hectare site was abandoned. The Federal Government (which controlled the mine through its agency the Australian Atomic Energy Commission (AAEC), now known as Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation (ANSTO)) decided not to rehabilitate the mine site . The mining company Conzinc (now part of the Rio Tinto Group, which owns Energy Resources of Australia (ERA), operators of the Ranger Uranium Mine in Kakadu National Park) have consistently denied any responsibility for rehabilitation. This led to the mine becoming known as one of Australia's most polluted environments due to the oxidation of sulphides and the release of acid and metals into the East Branch of the Finniss River. The 1500 mm annual rainfall, along with the pyritic mineralisation in the area, created ideal conditions for such oxidation. An initial attempt to clean up Rum Jungle was made in 1977, which led to the setting up of a working group to examine more comprehensive rehabilitation. A $16.2 million Commonwealth-funded program got under way in 1983 to remove heavy metals and neutralise the tailings. One of the principal problems associated with rehabilitating the Rum Jungle Creek South (RJCS) open cut was that the area was converted to a lake after mining ceased, and as the only water body in the Darwin region not infested with crocodiles, the site quickly became very popular with locals and Darwin residents as a recreation reserve including activities such as swimming, canoeing and scuba diving. After mining, the area suffered elevated gamma radiation, alpha-radioactive dust, and significant radon daughter concentrations in air. These levels were so high that in the late 1980s it was decided that something had to be done . Radiation protection standards were being revised, so that the levels of pollution would now be officially recognised as unsafe for human health. As a result, a supplementary $1.8 million program to improve Rum Jungle Creek South waste dumps was undertaken in 1990. One of the main environmental impacts of uranium mining is the creation of large volumes of radioactive mine waste (tailings) which are left behind on the site. The major radioactive component of these tailings is uranium-238, an isotope with a halflife of 4.46 billion years. In 2003, a government survey of the tailings piles at Rum Jungle found that capping which was supposed to help contain this radioactive waste for at least 100 years, had failed in less than 20 years. The Territory and Federal Governments continue to argue over responsibility for funding rehabilitation on the polluted East Finniss River Contamination of local groundwater has yet to be addressed. Brown's Oxide Project In December 2001, Compass Resources lodged a Referral under the EPBC Act with Environment Australia (which is now DEH). That document referred to the proposed development of a large-scale mining project, the Browns Polymetallic Project, that would produce lead, cobalt, copper, nickel and silver over a project life of at least 15 years. As indicated in the 2001 Referral, Compass considered that the Browns Polymetallic Project was a ‚Äònuclear action‚Äô under the EPBC Act, on the basis that the project could be considered to include rehabilitating a facility or area in which mining or milling of uranium ore has previously been undertaken.Brown's Oxide - Natural Resources, Environment and the Arts Compass suspended its work on the polymetallic proposal in 2002 when low metal prices caused the withdrawal of Compass‚Äôs financial partner (Doe Run). In 2005, Compass lodged an application for a much smaller project focussing on cobalt, nickel and copper mining. Because this project, the Brown's Oxide Project is much smaller than the polymetallic project proposed previously, Compass is in a position to progress it on its own. The Northern Territory Government has completed assessing this project and Ms Marion Scrymgour MLA, Minister for Natural Resources, Environment and Heritage in the Northern Territory Government has advised that she has concluded that the Browns Oxide Project as proposed in the Public Environmental Report and subsequent documents \\"can be managed without unacceptable environmental impacts\\" The Hon. Kon Vatskalis MLA Minister for Mines and Energy announced this approval as \\"good news\\" during question time in the Northern Territory Parliament on 4 May 2006. To ensure the environment is managed properly, this approval and its recommendations is subject to final review by the Commonwealth Government under a bilateral agreement between the Northern Territory Government and the Commonwealth of Australia.http://aspect.comsec.com.au/asxdata/20060505/pdf/00612091.pdf Pending final Commonwealth approval, the project is set to be in production by early 2007. While the project is located near the old Rum Jungle mine, the Browns Oxide Project is targeting copper cobalt and nickel‚Äînot uranium. Nonetheless, Compass acknowledges that at some future point it would be interested in mining uranium at the nearby Rum Jungle site (over which it holds a lease). Any proposal to mine uranium would require a totally new application and environmental assessment as a separate project. Geology The major uranium prospects of Brown's, Intermediate, White's, White's extension and Dyson's occur northwest of, but parallel to, the northeast trending Giant's Reef Fault. Ore deposits occur in Precambrian carbonaceous slate and graphitic schist of the Lower Proterozoic Brooks Creek Group. Structurally, the deposits are within a sheared anticline on the southern flank of a granite dome. Primary minerals include chalcopyrite, bornite, bournonite, pyrite, and uraninite. Oxidized ores include azurite, malachite, pseudomalachite, iron oxides, torbernite, saleeite, and phosphuranylite.

At least six residents were killed, though most groups estimated the true casualties to be higher. In 2000, a Haitian court tried fifty-nine people for alleged roles in the massacre, of whom 37, including former coup leader Raoul C√©dras, were tried in absentia. Sixteen of those tried in person were convicted, while all 37 of those tried in absentia were convicted and given sentences of life imprisonment. In May 2005, all sentences from the tribunal were overturned by the Supreme Court.  Massacre  Raboteau is a shanty town neighborhood by the sea in Gona√Øves in north-west Haiti. Following the 1991 Haitian coup d'√©tat against President Jean-Bertrand Aristide, residents held rallies in support of Aristide and opposing the de facto military dictatorship that replaced him. On April 22, 1994, soldiers and paramilitary forces made a dawn raid on the neighborhood. They went house-to- house, beating and arresting residents, including children and the elderly, making some lie in open sewers. People who ran were shot. Soldiers also fired indiscriminately on citizens who were collecting firewood, and commandeered rowboats to attack fishing boats off-shore. The military forbade families from collecting the bodies of the dead, making an exact count impossible. Journalists in Raboteau estimated that at least thirty people were killed, while later court proceedings stated that at least six people were known to have been killed. Human rights lawyers estimated that eight to fifteen people had been killed.  Court cases in Haiti  In 2000, fifty-nine people were put on trial for their alleged roles in the massacre, 37 of whom, including coup leader Raoul C√©dras, former Chief of National Police Michel Fran√ßois, and paramilitary leaders Emmanuel Constant and Louis-Jodel Chamblain, were tried in absentia. Prosecutors were aided in preparing the case by Mario Joseph and Brian Concannon of the Bureau des Avocats Internationaux. The trial lasted 6 weeks and ended on November 9, 2000. The jury found 16 of the 22 defendants in custody guilty of participation in the massacre, acquitting six. Twelve of those found guilty were sentenced to life imprisonment, while the other four were given four- to nine-year sentences. The 37 defendants who were tried in absentia were all convicted and given life sentences of hard labor. The New York Times described the trial as a \\"landmark\\" case for Haiti, \\"a step in bringing to justice an elite tier of military and paramilitary officers and their cohorts for human rights abuses\\". The trial was the subject of a 2003 documentary, Pote Mak Sonje: The Raboteau Trial. By 2005, one of the sixteen imprisoned defendants had died, while the remaining fifteen had reportedly escaped from prison, some in a mass jailbreak in Gonaives in which a bulldozer was driven through the walls of a prison On May 3, 2005, the Supreme Court overturned the sentences, ruling that \\"the Criminal Tribunal of Gona√Øves, having been established with the assistance of a jury, was not competent to rule the case\\". The reversal was condemned by Amnesty International, which called it \\"a huge step backwards\\".

In 1996, Secretary of State Warren Christopher submitted an affidavit to the immigration court, advocating Constant's deportation. Secretary Christopher noted the extensive and credible accusations of human rights violations by Constant, and reasoned that a failure to deport Constant would give the appearance that the U.S. government supported Constant's activities. The judge agreed and issued a deportation order, but it has not been executed. Following the order, Constant filed suit against Janet Reno claiming that the CIA had \\"collaborated\\" with him. Constant was eventually freed from U.S. custody with a gag order.

Told by a Catholic monk, Gjon (a name used by Northern Albanians who were mostly catholic prior to Turkish invasions), the story of the bridge, as seen by Gjon is filled with prissy, unhappy bureaucrats, who take the events at face value without ever trying to understand the larger forces at work. Both the river Ujana e Keqe and the bridge itself are major characters in the book, and they undergo significant transformations. One of the startling events of the book is when a \\"volunteer\\" is immured inside the bridge in order to make a \\"sacrifice\\" to the river. The man's face is captured in the plaster that surrounds him, as unforgettable as it is horrifying. Though clearly a punishment for the crime of sabotage against the bridge, as Gjon recounts this event, it is less an act of vengeance than it is a true sacrifice.

The ladder-like apparatus in the middle is the cangue that was worn by Pierre Borie in captivity. A cangue () or tcha is a device that was used for public humiliation and corporal punishment in East AsiaJamyang Norbu, From Darkness to Dawn, site Phayul.com, May 19, 2009. and some other parts of Southeast Asia until the early years of the twentieth century. It was also occasionally used for or during torture. Because it restricted a person's movements, it was common for people wearing cangues to starve to death as they were unable to feed themselves. The word \\"cangue\\" is French, from the Portuguese \\"canga,\\" which means yoke, the carrying tool has also been used to the same effect, with the hands tied to each arm of the yoke. Frequently translated as pillory, it was similar to that European punishment except that the movement of the prisoner's hands was not as rigorously restricted and that the board of the cangue was not fixed to a base and had to be carried around by the prisoner. Forms Although there are many different forms, a typical cangue would consist of a large, heavy flat board with a hole in the center large enough for a person's neck. The board consisted of two pieces. These pieces were closed around a prisoner's neck, and then fastened shut along the edges by locks or hinges. The opening in the center was large enough for the prisoner to breathe and eat, but not large enough for a head to slip through. The prisoner was confined in the cangue for a period of time as a punishment. The size and especially weight were varied as a measure of severity of the punishment. The Great Ming Legal Code (Â§ßÊòéÂæã) published in 1397 specified that a cangue should be made from seasoned wood and weigh 25, 20 or 15 jƒ´n (roughly 20‚Äì33 lb or 9‚Äì15 kg) depending on the nature of the crime involved. Often the cangue was large enough that the prisoner required assistance to eat or drink, as his hands could not reach his own mouth. Cage Execution after the Boxer Rebellion, China, 1900 The cangue would be placed atop a cage, such that the prisoners feet could not quite touch the ground. supports would be placed under the feet initially, so that he would stand without pressure on the neck. gradually, the supports would be removed, forcing the cangue to slowly strangle him. Ritual Historically cangues were used in rituals of penance in Chinese folk religion. These cangues either resembled the traditional wooden ones or were made out of three swords tied together or paper. Similar to its use as a torture and public humiliation device the penitant writes their sins on the board and parades themselves through the city until coming to the temple (generally a temple to the City God) and having their sins absolved. Often the cangue was then burned, especially if made of paper. The selling of ritual cangues was a major source of income for Chinese temples and continues to be one in Taiwan. The selling of fake ritual cangue by commoners was criminalized during the Qing dynasty.

What is needed A common rig for fishing on the bottom is a weight tied to the end of the line, and a hook about an inch up line from the weight. The method can be used both with hand lines and rod fishing. The weight can also be used to cast or throw the line to an appropriate distance. Bottom fishing can be done both from boats and from the land. Bottom fishing targets groundfish such as sucker fish, bream, catfish, and crappie. Specialized fishing rods called \\"donkas\\" are also commonly used for bottom fishing. The objective for rigs used for bottom fishing is to take your bait to the bottom of the water and lure in the fish. The bait must appear appetizing to the fish. The most common rig used in bottom fishing is called a \\"fish finder rig\\". The next rig is called a \\"porgy rig\\" for the reason that it is effective on porgies, grunts, snapper, and any other schooling, medium- sized fish. A rig that is rarely used is called a \\"break-away rig\\". The final rig is called a \\"party boat rig\\" because you will see it on almost every party. Other meaning In stock market terminology, bottom fishing can mean buying the cheapest investments (in terms of valuation ratios) available. Bottom fishing is value investing concentrated on the very cheapest companies. The term can be derogatory as it can imply a lack of attention to the quality of the investments selected. In stock trading, bottom fishing can also describe the practice of driving the price of a security lower in order to trigger stop-loss orders, which will then commonly drive a security's price even lower, at which point the person or entity responsible for the triggering will then buy up those shares. As part of this phenomenon, a security's price will then often rise again quickly above the stop-loss order mark.

John Harold Buckley, a pilot from Longmont, Colorado, who was killed in a mid-air collision in France on September 27, 1918.Buckley Air Force Base, \\"From Air to Space: A Brief History of the 460th Space Wing and Buckley Air Force Base,\\" https://www.buckley.af.mil/Portals/13/documents/2016%20Heritage%20Booklet.pdf?ver=2016-12-27-161000-643&timestamp;=1482873009433 (accessed 9 Aug 2018) left Following the entry of the United States into World War II, the War Department called for a dramatic expansion of Lowry Field's armament training program to 55,000 graduates per year. Lowry officials decided to transfer its fighter armament school to Buckley, and set aside 5,740 acres in the auxiliary field area for this purpose. Under the command of the 336th Headquarters and Air Base Squadron (Army Air Forces Technical Training Command), later the 3702d Army Air Force Base Unit, construction on the base began in May 1942, resulting in the construction of over 700 buildings. On July 1, 1942, the U.S. Army Air Corps Technical Training School began classes at the base. Along with its primary mission as a fighter armament training base, it also hosted schools for basic training, military police, post engineers, chemical warfare, and an arctic survival school for aircrew headed for the Alaskan Wing of the Air Transport Command. The arctic survival school conducted classroom training at Buckley and field training at Echo Lake, near the summit of Mt. Evans. Technical training at the base was under the jurisdiction of the Western Technical Training Command. During the war, Buckley Field graduated over 52,000 armament students, 4,500 arctic survival students, and 37,000 basic trainees.History Office, Buckley Field, April 1942-September 1946 The Cold War years After World War II, Buckley Field's military role quickly diminished. Beginning in 1945, it alternated roles as a sub-post of Lowry Field and a separate installation. Army Air Force Technical Training Command finally placed it on temporary inactive status in June 1946, and fully inactivated Buckley Field in September 1946. It allowed the Colorado Air National Guard to relocate to the base from Denver Municipal Airport during the same period to serve as custodian, although it never formally transferred control to the Guard during this time. In November 1946, the Department of the Navy announced that it planned to assume command of the base and convert it to a training installation for Reserve forces. The Navy formally assumed command of the base on September 28, 1947, renaming it Naval Air Station Denver. left The renamed base was the location of Naval Air Reserve aviation squadrons, as well as for veterans and their families waiting to return to civilian life. Thousands of veterans returned to civilian life here over the next four years, while Naval Air Reservists concurrently conducted operational training. The Navy remained here for 12 years before decommissioning its base on June 30, 1959, and transferring it to the U.S. Air Force (which had become a separate service branch in 1947). However, the Naval Reserve remained at Buckley as a tenant activity known as Naval Air Reserve Center Denver, the predecessor of the present day Navy Operational Support Center Denver. The Colorado Air National Guard continued to operate at NAS Denver as a tenant organization during this period, first under the 86th Fighter Wing and then the 140th Fighter Wing. Buckley Field became the Buckley Air National Guard Base on April 18, 1960 under a license from the USAF. At the time, it became the first stand-alone Air National Guard base in the country. The Colorado Air National Guard remained in control of Buckley Field for the next 40 years, operating it as a fighter base. During the Cold War era, the Colorado Air National Guard mobilized the Buckley-based 120th Tactical Fighter Squadron for events as the Cuban Missile Crisis, the USS Pueblo crisis, and the Vietnam War. Assigned aircraft during this period transitioned over time from P-51s to F-80s and F-86s, to F-100s, to A-7s. The 140th Wing has flown the F-16 Fighting Falcon since 1992. From 1961 to 1965, the base's former bombing range housed four Titan I missile silos, operated by the 451st Strategic Missile Wing, headquartered at Lowry AFB.Buckley Air Force Base, \\"From Air to Space: A Brief History of the 460th Space Wing and Buckley Air Force Base,\\" https://www.buckley.af.mil/Portals/13/documents/2016%20Heritage%20Booklet.pdf?ver=2016-12-27-161000-643&timestamp;=1482873009433 (accessed 8 Aug 2018) During the 1950s and 1960s, the growth of Aurora, Denver's eastern neighbor, edged toward Buckley Field. The land of the air base was annexed to Aurora in 1965 and 1966; however, the installation is US Government property under Federal jurisdiction. Growth and encroachment in Aurora and east Denver eventually forced the closure of air operations at Lowry AFB and transfer of all transient military flights to Buckley ANGB on July 1, 1966. From about 1970 through 1989, another tenant unit at Buckley Field was the 154th Tactical Air Support Group, an Air National Guard (ANG) unit trained to provide close air support for United States Army ground operations. The 154th Group had its own truck-mounted tactical radar units and radar-control vans, but no aircraft were assigned. In the spring of 1969, construction began on a top-secret satellite communications installation that eventually became known as the Aerospace Data Facility-Colorado. Two years later, additional construction took place to house the US-based operational center for the Defense Support Program satellite missile-warning system, designed to provide 24-hour detection of intercontinental ballistic missile launches and atmospheric explosions. This complex also featured what eventually became one of Aurora's most iconic architectural landmarks - white geodesic domes to protect the satellite dishes that came to be nicknamed the \\"giant golf balls\\" by local residents. For over 25 years, the existence of these satellite dishes was highly classified, until base leaders conducted a tour of the domes for the press in November 1996. The 1990s Although the Cold War ended in the early 1990s, the 120th Tactical Fighter Wing did not see any decrease in its responsibilities. It deployed from Buckley Field numerous times during the decade of the 1990s to take part in various military operations such as Operation Desert Storm, Operation Northern Watch, and Operation Iraqi Freedom. DSP operators also provided support for detection of Iraqi SCUD missile launches during Desert Storm. Due to base closures and realignments in the late 1980s and early 1990s, Buckley ANGB soon became host to an increasing number of tenant and support units, growing from fifteen organizations in the mid-1970s to over 40 by the end of the 1990s. This over- taxed the support capabilities and resources of the 140 WG, prompting National Guard leaders and Governor Bill Owens to request assistance from the Air Force to determine a solution. Twenty-first century Secretary of the Air Force F. Whitten Peters determined that the best long-term solution was to convert Buckley to an active-duty base, so that a larger, more dedicated installation support function could be built for the base's growing tenant units and mission partners, along with the ADF-C and DSP complex. On 1 October 2000, the United States Air Force took control of the base and it was assigned the 821st Space Group to oversee its operations. It was renamed Buckley Air Force Base. A year later, control of Buckley AFB was transferred to the newly reactivated 460th Air Base Wing, which assumed the responsibility for installation support of the base and its tenant units. On August 19th, 2004, Air Force Space Command redesignated the 460 ABW as the 460th Space Wing, bringing the base's satellite missile warning mission under control of the wing as well. Since the return of Buckley AFB to the Air Force in 2000, the base has seen an unprecedented amount of new construction and modernization. New enlisted airmen's dormitories, the commissary, the base exchange, chapel, and the fitness center have all been completed, augmented by the completion of family housing units - the first ones ever constructed there. In 2018, the base also saw the consolidation of all medical support functions on site, including a dedicated dental clinic, for the first time since the end of World War II.Buckley Air Force Base, \\"From Air to Space: A Brief History of the 460th Space Wing and Buckley Air Force Base,\\" https://www.buckley.af.mil/Portals/13/documents/2016%20Heritage%20Booklet.pdf?ver=2016-12-27-161000-643&timestamp;=1482873009433 (accessed 6 Jun 2019)https://www.buckley.af.mil/News/Article- Display/Article/1064935/buckley-opens-state-of-the-art-dental-clinic-first- time-since-wwii/ (accessed 9 Jun 2019) In late 2016, the Air Force approved an upgraded version of the Space-Based Infrared System (SBIRS) ground system from Lockheed Martin. The newly-improved system will strengthen the constellation's efforts in delivering critical infrared data for defense purposes. The Block 10 system, included as part of the initial SBIRS development plan and implemented from 2014-2016, provided the capability of speedier collection times in detecting potential threats, and is located at the SBIRS Mission Control Station at Buckley AFB. In Homeland Preparedness News, a Lockheed Martin spokesman said, \\"With the Block 10 upgrade, the mission-critical data supplied by SBIRS is now being managed from a single ground control station.\\"Buckley Air Force Base, \\"From Air to Space: A Brief History of the 460th Space Wing and Buckley Air Force Base,\\" https://www.buckley.af.mil/Portals/13/documents/2016%20Heritage%20Booklet.pdf?ver=2016-12-27-161000-643&timestamp;=1482873009433 (accessed 6 Jun 2018)  U.S. Space Force  The United States Space Force (USSF) was established as a separate branch of the armed services on 20 December 2019, with Air Force Space Command being elevated from a US Air Force major command to create the new service. At the same time, the Fourteenth Air Force, under which Buckley AFB operated, was re-designated as Space Operations Command (SpOC). Whilst initially retaining the Buckley Air Force Base name, it is expected bases such as Buckley will eventually be renamed to reflect their role as part of the Space Force. Notwithstanding, there would be heavy reliance of the Air Force to continue to operate and maintain them.

The industry also includes software services, such as training, documentation, consulting and data recovery . History The word \\"software\\" was coined as a prank as early as 1953, but did not appear in print until the 1960s. adapted from Sophisticated: The Magazine Before this time, computers were programmed either by customers, or the few commercial computer vendors of the time, such as UNIVAC and IBM. The first company founded to provide software products and services was Computer Usage Company in 1955. The software industry expanded in the early 1960s, almost immediately after computers were first sold in mass-produced quantities. Universities, government, and business customers created a demand for software. Many of these programs were written in-house by full-time staff programmers. Some were distributed freely between users of a particular machine for no charge. Others were done on a commercial basis, and other firms such as Computer Sciences Corporation (founded in 1959) started to grow. Other influential or typical software companies begun in the early 1960s included Advanced Computer Techniques, Automatic Data Processing, Applied Data Research, and Informatics General. The computer/hardware makers started bundling operating systems, systems software and programming environments with their machines. When Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) brought a relatively low-priced microcomputer to market, it brought computing within the reach of many more companies and universities worldwide, and it spawned great innovation in terms of new, powerful programming languages and methodologies. New software was built for microcomputers, so other manufacturers including IBM, followed DEC's example quickly, resulting in the IBM AS/400 amongst others. The industry expanded greatly with the rise of the personal computer (\\"PC\\") in the mid-1970s, which brought desktop computing to the office worker for the first time. In the following years, it also created a growing market for games, applications, and utilities. DOS, Microsoft's first operating system product, was the dominant operating system at the time. In the early years of the 21st century, another successful business model has arisen for hosted software, called software-as-a-service, or SaaS; this was at least the third time this model had been attempted. From the point of view of producers of some proprietary software, SaaS reduces the concerns about unauthorized copying, since it can only be accessed through the Web, and by definition no client software is loaded onto the end user's PC. Size of the industry According to industry analyst Gartner, the size of the worldwide software industry in 2013 was US$407.3 billion, an increase of 4.8% over 2012. As in past years, the largest four software vendors were Microsoft, Oracle Corporation, IBM, and SAP respectively. Mergers and acquisitions The software industry has been subject to a high degree of consolidation over the past couple of decades. Between 1995 and 2018 around 37,039 mergers and acquisitions have been announced with a total known value of US$1,166 bil. USD. The highest number and value of deals was set in 2000 during the high times of the dot-com bubble with 2,674 transactions valued at 105. bil. USD. In 2017, 2,547 deals were announced valued at $111 billion. Approaches to successfully acquire and integrate software companies are available. Business models within the software industry Business models of software companies have been widely discussed.Cusumano M.

The genealogy of Chingis Khan which began 1.500 years or 40-50 generations ago and comprises hundreds of thousands of people prevented Mongolian blood from being mixed with that of other nations. Due to the encouragement of intra-tribal marriages family lines were kept stringent. From 1920 onward people were not allowed to keep genealogical records, and the descendants of the nobles and scholars were tortured and killed. This prohibition lasted for about 70 years or three generations. Although the keeping of genealogical records was rare during that period, Mongolians used to pass information about their ancestors to their children orally.

Zanuck from a screenplay by Mankiewicz, based on the German play by Curt Goetz, which had been made into a movie in Germany (Doctor Praetorius, 1950). Released by Twentieth Century Fox, the film stars Cary Grant and Jeanne Crain, with supporting performances by Hume Cronyn, Finlay Currie, Walter Slezak, and Sidney Blackmer. The film was nominated for the Writers Guild of America screen Award for Best Written American Comedy (Joseph L. Mankiewicz). Plot People Will Talk describes an episode in the life of Dr. Noah Praetorius, a physician who teaches in a medical school and founded a clinic dedicated to treating patients humanely and holistically. The plot contains two parallel story lines: a professional- misconduct challenge brought against Praetorius by his more conventional colleague Dr. Rodney Elwell, who dislikes Praetorius's unorthodox but effective methods; and the struggle of a distressed young woman named Deborah Higgins, who falls in love with Praetorius while dealing with an out-of- wedlock pregnancy. The film also highlights Praetorius's close friend and confidant, physics professor Lyonel Barker, who plays double bass in the student/faculty orchestra conducted by Praetorius.  Elwell's misconduct suit  At the start of the film, Elwell has hired a detective to investigate Praetorius. A housemaid who once worked for Praetorius reacts visibly when Elwell asks her about Praetorius's mysterious friend Mr. Shunderson, who rarely leaves Praetorius's side and has a deep, intuitive understanding of human and animal nature. Elwell's detective discovers that Shunderson was once convicted of murder, and Elwell calls for a misconduct hearing against Praetorius. At the hearing, Praetorius explains that he started his career in a small town by opening a butcher shop as a front for his undeclared medical practice, because the people of the town didn't trust doctors. Elwell accuses Praetorius of \\"quackery\\", but Praetorius defends himself with the fact that he was a licensed practitioner, describing how he was forced to leave town after his maid discovered his medical degree. Praetorius refuses to answer questions about Shunderson, but Shunderson explains that he served 15 years in prison for the alleged death of a man who had tried to murder him, then somehow survived being hanged after actually murdering the man, who had gone into hiding during the first trial. When he woke up, he was lying on a table in front of Praetorius, who was at that time a medical student examining what he believed was a cadaver. Praetorius kept Shunderson's survival a secret, and Shunderson became Praetorius's devoted friend. After this story is told, the chairman concludes the hearing in Praetorius's favor, and Elwell walks away alone and discredited.  Deborah Higgins  Meanwhile, Deborah enters Praetorius's life, displaying signs of emotional distress. After she faints during a lecture, Praetorius examines her and informs her that she's pregnant. Upset by this news, \\"Mrs. Higgins\\" admits that she's not really married. She will not reveal who the unborn child‚Äôs father is, and says knowing about her condition would be too much for her own father to bear. In a hallway near Praetorius's office, she shoots herself. After successfully operating on Deborah, Praetorius tries to calm her by telling her there was a mistake in her pregnancy test, but she has fallen in love with him, and becomes upset at her own embarrassing behavior. She runs away from the clinic, forcing him to find her so he can tell her she really is pregnant. Praetorius and Shunderson drive out to where Deborah and her father Arthur live, a farm owned by Arthur's brother, John. Deborah and Praetorius hide Deborah's shooting incident from her father, who is a failure in life and lives unhappily as a dependent of his stingy brother. Deborah is his only pride in life, which might become intolerable for him with a baby to take care of and his daughter's reputation ruined. While showing Praetorius the farm, Deborah admits her love for him. She also wonders why he is visiting and begins to suspect that he is attracted to her. After she seductively interrogates him, they share a passionate kiss. They soon get married, and Arthur comes to live with them. A few weeks later, Deborah suggests to Noah that she may be pregnant, and he admits that she was pregnant all along. She ruefully concludes that he married her out of pity, but he convinces her that he really did fall in love with her. Elwell had purposefully arranged for Praetorius's misconduct hearing to be scheduled for the same time as the student/faculty orchestra's concert. After the hearing and Praetorius' acquittal, the film ends with Deborah, her father, and Shunderson in the audience watching Barker play in and Praetorius conduct the orchestra in the finale of Brahms's Academic Festival Overture : Gaudeamus Igitur.

(retrieved 28 May 2013) the movie has a number of political overtones. The review says the film is a reaction to \\"Mankiewicz‚Äôs own experiences during the communist witch hunts of the late 1940s and early 1950s, while he was president of the Directors Guild of America (1950-51). The film's investigative trial has parallels to the congressional hearings by anti- communist crusaders. And just as some refused to name names in such hearings, Cary Grant's lead character declines to clear his own name by revealing the private business of another person, in this case a convicted murderer. The review said that although the movie is meant as a cautionary tale about the dangers of witch hunts it deals with many other issues, including the pregnancy of a single woman, the \\"corrosive effect of unfettered capitalism, the human cost of the Korean war, among others.\\" Music The score for the film consists of two classical pieces: Johannes Brahms' Academic Festival Overture and Richard Wagner's Prize Song, both adapted and conducted by Alfred Newman.

Cowles (April 5, 1836 ‚Äì November 26, 1887) was a 19th-century American businessperson, founder of banks, companies, and a railway, and Southern California landowner. He was one of the early business leaders in San Diego and a prominent rancher in San Diego County. Early life Born April 5, 1836, and raised on a Connecticut farm in Hartford, his father had been the first to manufacture broadcloth in the US. George was placed to work in a local dry goods store at age 14, by the time he left at 21, he had been promoted to first salesman. He went on to start a cotton mill of his own which unfortunately burned a year later. Cotton business Cowles became successful in the cotton business as a broker in New York City, moving there when he was 25. That same year he married Jennie Blodgett from Hartford, a girl of 16. He helped organize, and at 30 was the first president of the NY Cotton Exchange. He retired from the cotton exchange at age 33. During the following year Cowles and his wife traveled the southern states. He next began a manufacturing business producing cotton cloth under government contract using a process he patented. He continued successfully in this venture until 1875. Cowles and his wife traveled regularly, apparently in part due to her health. In 1870, while touring the South, he contracted malaria in Florida. They traveled several times to California, where Cowles was searching for a preferred site to establish a ranch. California The Cowleses first visited the San Diego area in 1873, and in 1875 they began making large purchases of ranch land in the El Cajon Valley in San Diego County. After nearly a year of traveling through Europe, including stays at many health resorts, they settled at their El Cajon ranch in 1877 to begin a career in ranching, though he was in noticeably poor health. Arriving in California wealthy, and with expertise in business, finance, and agriculture, Cowles accomplished much in the ten years before his death in 1887. The property he purchased eventually totaled about 4,000 acres (16 km¬≤) in the El Cajon Valley and comprised two ranch sites about a mile apart. One was named \\"Woodside\\" where the ranch house was located and the other, probably by their having planted 17 magnolia trees, was named \\"Magnolia\\" (today, street names Woodside Ave in Santee and Magnolia Ave in El Cajon are from the Cowles ranches). He planted a great variety of different fruit trees and grapevines, olives, grains and potatoes. The greatest success was in raisins and olives. Cowles' products gained nationwide attention for San Diego's farming potential, particularly in fruits and vines, and he was called the \\"Raisin King of the US.\\" He raised fine thoroughbred horses, maintaining about 100 head, and 30 head of cattle. The community that developed around his Woodside ranch became known as Cowlestown. Other businesses George Cowles was an organizer of the Consolidated National Bank, a director of the Commercial Bank, and vice president of the San Diego Trust & Savings Bank. He was also a cofounder of the San Diego Marine Ways & Dry-dock Company on North Island, and was vice president after having turned down the offer of presidency.UCSD Library: \\"Schooner at San Diego Marine Ways & Drydock Company\\" - 1890s photograph. =California Southern Railroad= As a director of the California Southern Railroad, later part of the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway, he was responsible for extending the railroad from San Diego's 22nd Street Station into the north end of El Cajon Valley,. This included giving free right of way through his ranch properties. The San Diego Trolley Green Line route now runs on some of the right of way, and California State Route 67 also uses a section of the right of way as it turns east from Santee. Death George A. Cowles died at age 51 on November 26, 1887, in his room at San Diego's then premier Florence Hotel, succumbing after two weeks to an intestinal ailment. He had just completed the California Southern Railroad negotiations, an effort that some had said hastened his death. After a well attended funeral at a church in new Downtown San Diego, Cowles was buried in the El Cajon Valley. Two years later his remains were moved to the Mount Hope Cemetery in San Diego. Estate Having named both his wife Jennie Cowles, with a trusted friend, as the executors of his will, he left all of his estate to his wife. (They had no children.) The estate was considerable, estimated at between $370,000 and $500,000 then (present day $15‚Äì$20 million). The year after his death, some of her ranch property was subdivided and placed on the market as San Diego's 1880s land boom was ending. Jennie Cowles continued with the remaining ranches into the 1890s. She married Milton Santee, a real estate developer, in November 1890, and they moved to a house at 11th & B in \\"New Town\\" San Diego. Cowlestown's first school was held in a large room at the former Cowles ranch house. A new schoolhouse was built on land Jennie had donated for the school, and the Cowles School was renamed Santee School. Cowlestown was officially renamed Santee in 1893, for Cowles' second husband Milton Santee. According to historian Harriette Wade, Jennie \\"lobbied hard\\" to change the name to Santee in honor of her new husband. A \\"reluctant vote of the citizens\\" approved the idea in 1893, Wade said.Bill Owens, \\"Stampeding Toward Santee\\", San Diego Magazine\\", October 1997. Cowles Spring later became known as Dog Spring. Legacy Cowles Mountain was losing the name that honored George Cowles, becoming locally known as Black Mountain, a second one in the county; and/or 'S' Mountain, from the large white 'S' painted on its face for San Diego State University. However, the historically significant Cowles Mountain name has been used by Mission Trails Regional Park, which it has been within since 1974.

Born in New York City, Aldridge is the only actor of African-American descent among the 33 actors of the English stage honoured with bronze plaques at the Shakespeare Memorial Theatre at Stratford-upon-Avon. He was especially popular in Prussia and Russia, where he received top honors from heads of state. At the time of his sudden death, while on tour in Poland, he was arranging a triumphant return to America, with a planned 100-show tour to the United States. He was married twice, once to an Englishwoman, once to a Swedish woman, and had a family in England. Two of his daughters became professional opera singers. Early life and career Aldridge was born in New York City to Reverend Daniel and Luranah (also spelled Lurona) Aldridge on July 24, 1807. At the age of 13, Aldridge went to the African Free School in New York City, established by the New York Manumission Society for the children of free black people and slaves. They were given a classical education, with the study of English grammar, writing, mathematics, geography, and astronomy.Nicholas M. Evans, \\"Ira Aldridge, Shakespeare and Minstrelsy\\", The American Transcendental Quarterly, 1 September 2002, carried at Goliath. His classmates at the African free school included Charles L. Reason, George T. Downing, and Henry Highland Garnet.Simmons, William J., and Henry McNeal Turner. Men of Mark: Eminent, Progressive and Rising. GM Rewell & Company, 1887. p657 His early exposure to theater included viewing plays from the high balcony of the Park Theatre, New York's leading theater of the time, and seeing productions of Shakespeare's plays at the African Grove Theatre. Aldridge's first professional acting experience was in the early 1820s with the African Company, a group founded and managed by William Henry Brown and James Hewlett. In 1821, the group built the African Grove Theatre, the first resident African-American theatre in the United States.Nelson, E.S. (2004). In African American Dramatists: An A-to-Z Guide. Santa Barbara, CA: Greenwood. The short-lived company was the subject of protests by neighbors, thuggery attacks by a competitor, and racist parody by the Sheriff of New York who was also a newspaper publisher, making it clear that Aldridge's career prospects in America were dim. Aldridge made his acting debut as Rolla, a Peruvian character in Richard Brinsley Sheridan's Pizarro. He may have also played the male lead in Romeo and Juliet, as reported later in an 1860 memoir by his schoolfellow, Dr. James McCune Smith.Hill, Errol G., and James Vernon Hatch. (2003). A History of African American Theatre. Cambridge University Press. Confronted with the persistent discrimination which black actors had to endure in the United States, Aldridge emigrated to Liverpool, England, in 1824 with actor James Wallack. During this time the Industrial Revolution had begun, bringing about radical economic change that helped expand the development of theatres. The British Parliament had already outlawed the slave trade and was moving toward abolishing slavery in the British colonies, which increased the prospect of black actors being able to perform. Ira Aldridge as Mungo in The Padlock Having limited onstage experience and lacking name recognition, Aldridge concocted a story of his African lineage, claiming to have descended from the Fulani princely line. By 1831, he for a time took the name of Keene, a homonym for the then popular British actor, Edmund Kean. Aldridge observed a common theatrical practice of assuming an identical or similar nomenclature to that of a celebrity in order to garner attention. In addition to being called F. W. Keene Aldridge, he would later be called African Roscius, after the famous Roman actor of the first century BCE. At 17, Aldridge first appeared on the London stage in May 1825 in a low profile production of Othello. On October 10, 1825, Aldridge made a much more high profile debut at London's Royal Coburg Theatre, and became the first African-American actor to establish himself professionally in a foreign country. He played the lead role of Oroonoko in The Revolt of Surinam, or A Slave's Revenge; this play was an adaptation of Thomas Southerne's Oroonoko (itself adapted from Aphra Behn's original work). According to the scholar Shane White, English theatre audiences had heard of the African Theatre because of British actor and comedian Charles Mathews, which had the ironic effect of boosting Aldridge's profile. In a forerunner of blackface entertainment, Mathews had recently produced a popular comedic lampoon of what he imagined the African Theater was like (he had never actually been). Bernth Lindfors says: > [W]hen Aldridge starts appearing on the stage at the Royalty Theatre, he's > just called a gentleman of color. But when he moves over to the Royal > Coburg, he's advertised in the first playbill as the American Tragedian from > the African Theater New York City. The second playbill refers to him as \\"The > African Tragedian\\". So everybody goes to the theater expecting to laugh > because this is the man they think Mathews saw in New York City. An innovation Aldridge introduced early in his career was a direct address to the audience on the closing night of his engagement at a given theatre. Especially in the years leading up to the emancipation of all slaves in the British colonies in 1832, he would speak of the injustice of slavery and the passionate desire for freedom of those held in bondage. Critical reception Aldridge as Aaron in Titus AndronicusIn the mid 19th century, the African- American actor Ira Aldridge and the English playwright C.A. Somerset collaborated on a new version that transformed Aaron, a Moor and the lover of the barbarian queen Tamora, from villain to hero, subverting racial stereotype. Aldridge and Somerset cut out most of the carnage and interpolated at least one scene from a contemporary melodrama that Aldridge had also starred in. Aldridge‚Äôs opinion: ‚ÄúI will venture to say that there is not a play on the stage with a more powerful climax.‚Äù A Scottish critic praised Aldridge‚Äôs performance as Aaron as ‚Äúremarkable for energy, tempered by dignity and discretion.‚Äù During Aldridge's seven-week engagement at the Royal Coburg, the young actor starred in five plays. He earned admiration from his audiences while most critics emphasized Aldridge's lack of stage training and experience. According to modern critics Errol Hill and James Vernon Hatch, early reviews were mixed. For The Times he was \\"baker-kneed and narrow-chested with lips so shaped that it is utterly impossible for him to pronounce English\\"; The Globe found his conception of Oroonoko to be very judicious and his enunciation distinct and sonorous; and The Drama described him as \\"tall and tolerably well proportioned with a weak voice that gabbles apace.\\" The Times critic also found fault with Aldridge's \\"copper\\" complexion, considering it insufficiently dark for Othello.The Times (London, England), 11 October 1825, p. 2. Aldridge performed scenes from Othello that impressed reviewers. One critic wrote, \\"In Othello (Aldridge) delivers the most difficult passages with a degree of correctness that surprises the beholder.\\"Herbert Marshall, Ira Aldridge: The African Tragedian, He gradually progressed to larger roles; by 1825, he had top billing at London's Coburg Theatre as Oronoko in A Slave's Revenge, soon to be followed by the role of Gambia in The Slave, and the title role of Shakespeare's Othello. He also played major roles in plays such as The Castle Spectre and The Padlock. In search of new and suitable material, Aldridge also appeared occasionally as white European characters, for which he would be appropriately made up with greasepaint and wig. Examples of these are Captain Dirk Hatteraick and Bertram in Rev. R. C. Maturin's Bertram, the title role in Shakespeare's Richard III, and Shylock in The Merchant of Venice. Aldridge's success also created enemies. The Athenaeum was scandalized by a black man with white actresses, and Figaro in London sought to \\"drive him from the stage\\" because of his color. Touring and later years Aldridge as Othello by William Mulready, Walters Art Museum In 1831 Aldridge successfully played in Dublin; at several locations in southern Ireland, where he created a sensation in the small towns; as well as in Bath, England and Edinburgh, Scotland. The actor Edmund Kean praised his Othello; some took him to task for taking liberties with the text, while others attacked his race. Since he was an American black actor from the African Theatre, The Times called him the \\"African Roscius\\", after the famed actor of ancient Rome. Aldridge used this to his benefit and expanded African references in his biography that appeared in playbills, also identifying his birthplace as \\"Africa\\" in his entry in the 1851 census.1851 England, Wales and Scotland census, folio 446, p. 30. Aldridge is staying at a boarding house in Derby with his wife and son, and gives his occupation as \\"Tragedian'\\". In June 1844 he made appearances on stage in Exmouth (Devon, England).\\"Exmouth. This pleasant watering place has during the last two days been enlivened by the performances of the 'African Roscius'. Numerous assemblies have on each night testified their approbation of his impersonation of Othello and Revenge.\\" in Trewman's Exeter Flying Post, 26 June 1844 (issue no. 4103). By at least 1833 he had added the anti-heroic role of Zanga in Edward Young's The Revenge to his repertoire. The Revenge (1721) race-flips the plot of Othello by showing how Zanga, a captured Moorish prince who has become the servant and confidant of the noble Don Alonzo, vengefully tricks him into believing his wife is unfaithful. Alonzo finally kills himself and Zanga exults: \\"Let Europe and her pallid sons go weep; / Let Afric and her hundred thrones rejoice: / Oh, my dear countrymen, look down and see / How I bestride your prostrate conqueror!\\"The Revenge: A Tragedy by Edward Young. An illustrated review of this performance\\"The Theatre\\", Black Presence, The National Archives. at the Surrey Theatre shows Aldridge triumphing over Alonzo, dressed in flowing Moorish robes, which, according to the critic, \\"reminds one of the portraits of Abd-el Kader\\". The same reviewer praised Aldridge's comic talents in the contrasting role of Mungo (in the Bickerstaffe farce The Padlock), describing them as a refreshing corrective to current stereotypical \\"blackface\\" representation, \\"...differing entirely from the Ethiopian absurdities we have been taught to look upon as correct portraitures; his total abandon is very amusing.\\"The Illustrated London News, 1 April 1848, p. 218. Aldridge first toured to continental Europe in 1852, with successes in Germany, where he was presented to the Duchess of Saxe- Coburg-Gotha, and performed for Frederick William IV of Prussia; he also performed in Budapest. An 1858 tour took him to Serbia and to Imperial Russia, where he became acquainted with Count Fyodor Tolstoy, Mikhail Shchepkin and the Ukrainian poet and artist Taras Shevchenko, who did his portrait in pastel. Now of an appropriate age, about this time, he played the title role of King Lear (in England) for the first time. He purchased some property in England, toured Russia again (1862), and applied for British citizenship (1863). Shortly before his death he was apparently ready to return to America to perform. It was reported that Aldridge had negotiated a 100-show-tour throughout the post-Civil War United States In its obituary of Aldridge, The New York Times stated he had been booked to appear in the city's Academy of Music in September, but \\"Death has prevented the fulfilment of his intention\\".The New York Times, 12 August 1867: \\"Obituary: Ira Aldridge, the African Tragedian\\". Marriage and family Portrait in pastel, by Taras Shevchenko, 1858 Soon after going to England, in 1824 Aldridge married Margaret Gill, an English woman. They were married for 40 years until her death in 1864. Aldridge's first son, Ira Daniel, was born in May 1847. The identity of his mother is unknown, but it could not have been Margaret Aldridge, who was 49 years old and had been in ill health for years. She raised Ira Daniel as her own; they shared a loving relationship until her death. He emigrated to Australia in February 1867. Aldridge bought 5 Hamlet Road, in the prosperous suburbs of Upper Norwood, London, in 1861‚Äì2 shortly before becoming a naturalised British citizen in 1863. It was where his wife, Margaret, and later his second wife, Amanda, brought up his children. He named the house ‚ÄòLuranah Villa‚Äô in memory of his mother. It now bears his English Heritage blue plaque. A year after Margaret's death, on April 20, 1865, Aldridge married his mistress, the self-styled Swedish countess Amanda von Brandt (1834-1915). They had four children: Irene Luranah, Ira Frederick and Amanda Aldridge, who all went on to musical careers, the two girls as opera singers. Their daughter Rachael Frederica was born shortly after Aldridge's death and died in infancy. Brandt died in 1915 and is buried at Highgate Woods, London. Aldridge spent most of his final years with his family in Russia and continental Europe, interspersed with occasional visits to England. He planned to return to the post-Civil-War United States, but he died in August 1867 while visiting ≈Å√≥d≈∫, Poland.Simmons, William J., and Henry McNeal Turner.

Ira Aldridge Troupe As Othello in Poland, 1860 Aldridge enjoyed enormous fame as a tragic actor during his lifetime, but after his death, he was soon forgotten (in Europe). The news of Ira Aldridge's death in Poland and the record of his achievement as an actor reached the American black community slowly.Lindfors, Bernth. Ira Aldridge, the African Roscius. Rochester, New York: University of Rochester Press, 2007 In African-American circles, Aldridge was a legendary figure. Many black actors viewed him as an inspirational model, so when his death was revealed, several amateur groups sought to honor his memory by adopting his name for their companies. Many troupes were being founded in various places around America. In the late nineteenth century Aldridge-titled troupes were established in Washington, DC, in Philadelphia, and in New Haven, their respective productions at the time being an adaptation of Kotzebue's ' by Sheridan as Pizarro in 1883, School by Thomas William Robertson in 1885, and George Melville Baker's Comrades in 1889. The most prominent troupe named for him was the Ira Aldridge Troupe in Philadelphia, founded in 1863, some 35 years after Aldridge left the US for good.Shalom, Jack. \\"The Ira Aldridge Troupe: Early Black Minstrelsy in Philadelphia.\\" African-American Review 28.4 (1994): 653‚Äì658 The Ira Aldridge Troupe was a minstrelsy group that caricatured Irish white men. The Ira Aldridge Troupe is unique in annals of minstrelsy; it was named for a Black actor who had left his homeland some 35 years before and achieved fame in Europe. Unlike most, later, Black minstrel companies, the Aldridge Troupe apparently did not do plantation material, although they were billed as a 'contraband troupe'‚Äîthat is, fugitive slaves. Perhaps because of their substantially Black audience, the troupe felt no need to \\"put on the mask.\\" Although much of the material the group performed was standard fare, several of the company's acts were downright subversive. The Ira Aldridge Troupe appearing during the American Civil War made it \\"unique in the annals of minstrelsy.\\" The Clipper (New York City) thought it was important enough to review; and it performed before a mixed audience, at a time when often white and black audiences were separated. Third, it was a black troupe presenting a program designed to appeal to their black audience. The Ira Aldridge Troupe performances eschewed the southern genre of old \\"darkies\\" longing for the plantation. The exclusion of southern nostalgia may have been in deference to a majority-black audience. The New York Clipper reported them as \\"A more incorrigible set of cusses we never saw; they beat our Bowery gods all to pieces.\\" The troupe also created performances and songs that referred to the continuing Civil War. A ballad, \\"When the Cruel War is Over\\", became well known; it was performed by three members of the troupe‚ÄîMiss S. Burton, Miss R. Clark, and Mr. C. Nixon. The song sold over a million copies of sheet music and was one of the most popular sentimental songs of the Civil War. The song describes a soldier's farewell to his lady, the wounds he receives in battle, and his dying request for a last caress. The song, highly popular with white minstrel groups, was an example of the change in white minstrelsy that had been occurring at this time.) Another popular production was a farce called The Irishman and the Stranger, with a Mr. Brown playing a character called Pat O'Callahan and a Mr. Jones playing the Stranger. This farce displayed black actors in white face speaking in a \\"nigger accent\\". The Clipper reporter referred to the performance as a \\"truly laughable affair, the 'Irish nagur' mixing up a rich Irish brogue promiscuously with the sweet nigger accent\\". Perhaps the Aldridge Troupe's audience got its biggest satisfaction, however, from the role reversal inherent in the piece: since the beginning of minstrelsy, minstrels of Irish heritage, such as Dan Bryant and Richard Hooley, had been caricaturing Black men‚Äînow it was the turn of Black men to caricature the Irish. The history of minstrelsy also shows the cross- cultural influences, with Whites adopting elements of Black culture. The Ira Aldridge Troupe tried to pirate that piracy, and, in collaboration with its audience, turn minstrelsy to its own ends.  Aldridge family  * Ira Daniel Aldridge, 1847‚Äì?. Teacher.

The Black Doctor (1847) The Black Doctor, originally written in French by Auguste Anicet-Bourgeois, was adapted by Aldridge for the English stage. The Black Doctor is a romantic play about Fabian, a bi-racial physician, and his patient Pauline, the daughter of a French aristocrat. The couple falls in love and marries in secret. Although the play depicts racial and family conflict, and ends with Fabian's death, Aldridge was said to portray his title character with dignity. Some plot points mirror Aldridge's own life, as he married a white Englishwoman.Hatch, James V., and Ted Shine, eds. Black Theatre U.S.A.. The Free Press, 1996 [1974], p. 4.

The resulting force is proportional to the velocity, but acts in the opposite direction, slowing the motion and absorbing energy. It is commonly used in conjunction with a spring (which acts to resist displacement). The process and instrumentation diagram (P&ID;) symbol for a dashpot is 35px.  Types  The two most common types of dashpots are linear and rotary ones.  Linear damper  Linear dashpots ‚Äî or linear dampers ‚Äî are used to exert a force opposite to a translation movement. They are generally specified by stroke (amount of linear displacement) and damping coefficient (force per velocity).  Rotary damper  Similarly, rotary dampers will tend to oppose any torque applied to them, in an amount proportional to their rotational speed. Their damping coefficients will usually be specified by torque per angular velocity. One can distinguish two kinds of viscous rotary dashpots: * Vane dashpots which have a limited angular range but provide a significant damping torque. The damping force is the result of one or multiple vanes moving through a viscous fluid and letting it flow via calibrated openings. * Continuous rotation dashpots which aren't limited in their rotation angle but provide a smaller damping coefficient. These use the friction generated by the shearing forces induced in the viscous fluid itself by the difference in motion between the dashpot's rotor and stator.  Eddy current damper  A less common type of dashpot is an eddy current damper, which uses a large magnet inside a tube constructed of a non- magnetic but conducting material (such as aluminium or copper). Like a common viscous damper, the eddy current damper produces a resistive force proportional to velocity.  One-way operation  Dashpots frequently use a one-way mechanical bypass to permit fast unrestricted motion in one direction and slow motion using the dashpot in the opposite direction. This permits, for example, a door to be opened quickly without added resistance, but then to close slowly using the dashpot. For hydraulic dashpots this unrestricted motion is accomplished using a one-way check-valve that allows fluid to bypass the dashpot fluid constriction. Non-hydraulic rotatry dashpots may use a ratcheting gear to permit free motion in one direction.  Applications  Zenith-Stromberg carburetor A dashpot is a common component in a door closer to prevent it from slamming shut. A spring applies force to close the door, which the dashpot offsets by forcing fluid to flow through an orifice, often adjustable, between reservoirs, which slows the motion of the door. Consumer electronics often use dashpots where it is undesirable for a media access door or control panel to suddenly pop open when the door latch is released. The dashpot provides a steady, gentle motion until the access door has fully opened. Dashpots are commonly used in dampers and shock absorbers. The hydraulic cylinder in an automobile shock absorber is a dashpot. They are also used on carburetors, where the return of the throttle lever is cushioned just before the throttle fully closes, then is allowed to fully close slowly to reduce emissions. The British SU carburettor's main piston carries a stepped needle. This needle is held in the fuel flow orifice. The manifold vacuum causes this piston to rise allowing more fuel into the airflow. The SU's dashpot has a fixed hydraulic piston, damping the main piston as it moves upward. A valve in the piston disables the damping as the main piston returns. Large forces and high speeds can be controlled by dashpots. For example, they are used to arrest the steam catapults on aircraft carrier decks. Relays can be made to have a long delay by utilizing a piston filled with fluid that is allowed to escape slowly. Electrical switchgear may use dashpots in their overcurrent sensing mechanism to reduce reaction speed to brief events, thus making them less sensitive to false-triggering during transients whilst still remaining sensitive to sustained overloads. Another use is for delaying the closing or opening of an electrical circuit. Such a dashpot timer might be used for example for timed staircase lighting. Anti-stall mechanisms in internal combustion engines are aimed to prevent stalling of the engine at low rpm. Anti-stall mechanisms use dashpots to arrest the final closing movement of the throttle. Viscoelasticity Dashpots are used as models of materials that exhibit viscoelastic behavior, such as muscle tissue. Maxwell and Kelvin‚ÄìVoigt models of viscoelasticity use springs and dashpots in series and parallel circuits respectively. Models containing dashpots add a viscous, time-dependent element to the behavior of solids, allowing complex behaviors like creep and stress relaxation to be modeled.

Adults always have red feet, but the colour of the plumage varies. They are powerful and agile fliers, but they are clumsy in takeoffs and landings. They are found widely in the tropics, and breed colonially in coastal regions, especially islands. The species faces few natural or man-made threats, although its population is declining it is considered to be a least-concern species by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). Taxonomy The first formal description of the red-footed booby was by the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus in 1766 in the twelfth edition of his Systema Naturae. He introduced the binomial name Pelecanus sula. The type locality is Barbados in the West Indies. The present genus Sula was introduced by the French scientist Mathurin Jacques Brisson in 1760. The word Sula is Norwegian for a gannet. There are three subspecies: * S. s. sula (Linnaeus, 1766) ‚Äì Caribbean and southwest Atlantic islands * S. s. rubripes Gould, 1838 ‚Äì tropical Pacific and Indian Oceans * S. s. websteri Rothschild, 1898 ‚Äì eastern central Pacific Description The red-footed booby is the smallest member of the booby and gannet family at about in length and with a wingspan of up to .\\"Red-footed Booby\\".

Dunning Jr. (Editor). CRC Press (2008), . It has red legs, and its bill and throat pouch are coloured pink and blue. This species has several morphs. In the white morph the plumage is mostly white (the head often tinged yellowish) and the flight feathers are black. The black-tailed white morph is similar, but with a black tail, and can easily be confused with the Nazca and masked boobies. The brown morph is overall brown. The white-tailed brown morph is similar, but has a white belly, rump, and tail. The white-headed and white-tailed brown morph has a mostly white body, tail and head, and brown wings and back. The morphs commonly breed together, but in most regions one or two morphs predominates; for example, at the Gal√°pagos Islands, most belong to the brown morph, though the white morph also occurs. The sexes are similar, and juveniles are brownish with darker wings, and pale pinkish legs, while chicks are covered in dense white down. The species has been recorded three times from Sri Lanka. In September 2016, a male red-footed booby was found washed up on a beach in East Sussex, UK, 5,000 miles from its nearest usual habitat. It was the first of its species ever recorded in the UK. The bird, later named Norman, was said by some to be exhausted and malnourished, though it flew onto the beach freely and was of normal weight when checked. He was brought back to health before being transported by plane to an environmental center in the Cayman Islands in December 2016, where he subsequently died before ever being released into the wild. In January 2017, a red-footed booby was sighted on the New Zealand mainland for the first time. A red-footed booby was observed to be preyed upon by a large coconut crab on the Chagos Archipelago in 2016. Breeding Red- footed booby Egg, Collection Museum Wiesbaden This species breeds on islands in most tropical oceans. When not breeding it spends most of the time at sea, and is therefore rarely seen away from breeding colonies. It nests in large colonies, laying one chalky blue egg in a stick nest, which is incubated by both adults for 44‚Äì46 days. The nest is usually placed in a tree or bush, but rarely it may nest on the ground. It may be three months before the young first fly, and five months before they make extensive flights. Red-footed booby pairs may remain together over several seasons. They perform elaborate greeting rituals, including harsh squawks and the male's display of his blue throat, also including short dances. Diet Red-footed boobies dive into the ocean at high speeds to catch prey. They mainly eat small fish or squid which gather in groups near the surface. Conservation The International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) lists the red-footed booby as a species of least concern, though the population worldwide is decreasing. The warm phase (El Ni√±o) of the El Ni√±o‚ÄìSouthern Oscillation in 1982 and 1983 negatively impacted on breeding on Christmas Island as higher water temperatures reduced food supply. Where usually 6000 pairs nested, 30 pairs and the around 60 pairs attempted breeding in 1982 and 1983 respectively. References * * Hilty.

It was produced by the Grundy Organisation in association with Telecip, S.A. and Spain's public broadcaster Televisi√≥n Espa√±ola. Series synopsis  Secret Valley is a fictitious children's holiday camp in Bildarra which had been transformed from a run down ghost town into a resort. The children who worked and visited the camp often found themselves in battle against a gang of bad kids ‚Äì Spider McGlurk and his gang from \\"Spider Cave\\". These battles usually featured flour bombs and other food related missiles and everyone inevitably ended up in a big mess. Spider McGlurk and his gang were not the biggest threat to the peace at Secret Valley. Secret Valley was also under threat of closure by the local council, and property developer William Whopper (also known as 'WW') played by Hugh Keays-Byrne. It was produced by Roger Mirams who also produced the series Professor Poopsnagle's Steam Zeppelin in 1986, amongst other programs and series. The 1980 pilot was directed by Howard Rubie and written by Terry Bourke.Ed. Scott Murray, Australia on the Small Screen 1970-1995, Oxford Uni Press, 1996 p137 International screenings  The series was aired in New Zealand, Spain, Greece, Italy, the UK on ITV in the 1980s, and the Netherlands in 1982/1983 by KRO television. It was also broadcast by the Dutch TV station Kindernet in 1989/1990. It was also aired in South Africa in 1983 on the state-owned SABC. Production * This program was a co-production between Australia, Spain and France (Grundy Organisation, TVE and Telecip). * Some of the child actors in this show were real-life siblings ‚Äì Beth, Miles and Simone Buchanan. * The series was at Smokey Dawson's ranch in the NSW town of Terrey Hills and also at the theme park El Caballo Blanco. Roger Mirams originally intended to make a series called The Ghost Town Gang at Smoky Dawson's ranch at Ingleside, which had been used to film Luke's Kingdom and Lost Islands. However bushfires went through it, and there was no ghost town so the show became Secret Valley. Thirteen days after the fire, filming started again. Producer Mirams says the overall theme of Secret Valley is depicted through kids doing their own thing in what usually is an adult world. The theme song The theme song \\"My Secret Valley\\" was sung to the tune of \\"Waltzing Matilda\\" and composed by Bob Young, with lyrics by series producer Roger Mirams (credited as David Phillips).

He was the U.S. Ambassador to Israel and a six-term United States Representative from Westchester County, New York. Early life Reid was born in New York City, the son of publishers Helen Rogers Reid (1882‚Äì1970) and Ogden Mills Reid (1882‚Äì1947), and the brother of Whitey Reid (1913‚Äì2009) and Elisabeth Reid, who died in childhood. He was the grandson of diplomat and 1892 Republican Vice Presidential candidate Whitelaw Reid (1837‚Äì1912). His family owned the New York Herald Tribune and before that the New York Tribune. His aunt, Jean Templeton Reid (1884‚Äì1962), was married to Sir John Hubert Ward (1870‚Äì1938), the son of William Ward, 1st Earl of Dudley. His grandmother, Elisabeth Reid (n√©e Mills) (1857‚Äì1931), and her brother, Ogden Mills (1856‚Äì1929), were the children of Darius Ogden Mills (1825‚Äì1910). He graduated from Deerfield Academy in 1943 and Yale University, where he was a member of Book and Snake, in 1949. He was widely known by his nickname, \\"Brownie\\". Career=Military service Reid enlisted as a private in the United States Army in 1943 and was discharged as a First lieutenant in 1946. He later served as a Captain in the United States Army Reserve. New York Herald Tribune From 1955 until 1958, Reid served as publisher, president, and editor of the family paper, the New York Herald Tribune. During his tenure, he brought puzzle contests and stories from Hollywood into the newspaper, but did little to help the paper's finances. John Hay Whitney bought the paper shortly thereafter in August 1958. From 1956 until 1959, Reid was a director of the Panama Canal Company. Political careerAmbassador to Israel= From 1959 to 1961, Reid was the United States Ambassador to Israel. In this role, he interacted with Foreign Minister Golda Meir, who expressed Israel's opposition to a proposal to revive the Palestine Conciliation Commission in an attempt to solve the Arab refugee problem. Following his return to the United States, he became a director of the Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance Company in 1961. =United States Congress= In 1962, Reid was elected to the Eighty-eighth Congress as a Republican. He was on the liberal fringe of the GOP and faced repeated challenges in primaries. In 1965, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. wrote to Rep. Reid thanking him for coming to Alabama and visiting Selma. King wrote that \\"Your very presence there has had an electric effect upon the voteless and beleaguered Negro citizens of this city, county, state and nation.\\" On March 22, 1972, he switched parties and joined the Democratic Party. Reid said that he could not support Richard Nixon for re-election and the Republican Party had \\"moved to the right\\" and was \\"not showing the compassion and sensitivity to meet the problems of the average American.\\" After switching parties he turned back a Republican challenge in 1972. Then in 1974 at the end of that term Reid declined to seek re-election to the House. While in Congress, Reid sponsored 85 pieces of legislation and co-sponsored 99 pieces of legislation. Later career In 1974, he briefly ran for Governor of New York, dropping out of the race before the election. He later served in the administration of Democratic governor Hugh Carey as Commissioner of Environmental Conservation and was the unsuccessful Democratic nominee for the post of Westchester County Executive in 1983. His papers are held with the Manuscripts and Archives at the Sterling Memorial Library at Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut. Personal life In July 1949, Reid married Mary Louise Stewart (b. July 8, 1925), a Barnard College and Columbia University graduate who was the daughter of William Harold Stewart and Dorothy Miller. She was a granddaughter of Roswell Miller (1843‚Äì1913), the former president of the Chicago, Milwaukee & St. Paul Railroad, and Mary Louise Roberts (1866‚Äì1955). Her uncle, Roswell Miller, Jr. (1894‚Äì1983) married Margaret Carnegie (1897‚Äì1990), the only daughter of Andrew Carnegie. Together, the Reids had six children: * Stewart Mills Reid, who married Vivian Green, the daughter of Paul Green, in 1973. * Michael Whitelaw Reid, who married Anne Katherine Burrows, daughter of Kenneth G. Burrows, in 1984. * William Rogers Reid, who married Elizabeth Garno, the daughter of Edmund Forsythe Garno, Jr., in 2000. * Elisabeth Reid (b. 1960), who married Richard W. Taylor, Jr., son of Richard W. Taylor, in 1981. * Ogden Reid (b. 1961) * David Whitelaw Reid (b. 1967) During his youth Reid lived at Ophir Cottage, the home in Purchase, New York that was built by his grandfather, Whitelaw Reid. He owned Flyway, a 430‚Äêacre estate in North Carolina near the Virginia border that was worth $600,000 in 1974. Reid was a member of the New York Athletic Club, the River Club and the Wings Club. Reid died on March 2, 2019, at his home in Waccabuc, New York, at the age of 93.

Circuit rider clergy, in the earliest years of the United States, were clergy assigned to travel around specific geographic territories to minister to settlers and organize congregations. Circuit riders were clergy in the Methodist Episcopal Church and related denominations, although similar itinerant preachers could be found in other faiths as well, particularly among minority faith groups. History In sparsely populated areas of the United States it always has been common for clergy in many denominations to serve more than one congregation at a time, a form of church organization sometimes called a \\"preaching circuit\\". In the contemporary United Methodist Church, a minister serving more than one church has a \\"(number of churches) point charge\\". However, in the rough frontier days of the early United States, the pattern of organization in the Methodist Episcopal denomination and its successors worked especially well in the service of rural villages and unorganized settlements. In the Methodist denominations, congregations do not \\"call\\" (or employ) a pastor of their own choice. Instead, a bishop \\"appoints\\" (assigns) a pastor to a congregation or a group of congregations, and until late in the 20th century, neither pastor nor congregation had any say in the appointment. This meant that in the early days of the United States, as the population developed, Methodist clergy could be appointed to circuits wherever people were settling. A \\"circuit\\" (nowadays referred to as a charge) was a geographic area that encompassed two or more local churches. Pastors met each year at \\"Annual Conference\\" where their bishops would appoint them either to a new circuit or to remain at the same one. Most often they were moved to another appointment every year. (In 1804, the Methodist Episcopal General Conference decreed that no pastor was to serve the same appointment for more than two consecutive years.)Hyde, A. B. The Story of Methodism (revised edition). Springfield, Mass: Willey & Co., 1889, p. 470. The 1887 edition is available as a Google Book. Once a pastor was assigned a circuit, it was his responsibility to conduct worship and visit members of each church in his charge on a regular basis in addition to possibly establishing new churches. He was supervised by a Presiding Elder (now called a District Superintendent) who would visit each charge four times a year (the \\"Quarterly Conference\\"). Rural locations Riding on horseback between distant churches, these preachers were popularly called \\"circuit riders\\" or \\"saddlebag preachers\\" although their official role was \\"traveling clergy\\" (a term still used in Methodist denominations). Carrying only what could fit in their saddlebags, they traveled through wilderness and villages, preaching every day at any place available (peoples' cabins, courthouses, fields, meeting houses, even basements and street corners). Unlike clergy in urban areas, Methodist circuit riders were always on the move, needing five to six weeks to cover the longest routes. Their ministerial activity boosted Methodism into the largest Protestant denomination at the time,Gaustad, Edwin Scott. Historical Atlas of Religion in America. New York: Harper and Row, 1962, pp. 77‚Äì78. with 14,986 members and 83 traveling preachers in 1784 Porter, James. A Compendium of Methodism. New York: Carlton & Porter, 1851, p. 134. The 1853 edition is available as a Google Book. and by 1839, 749,216 members served by 3,557 traveling preachers and 5,856 local preachers.Porter, James. op. cit., p. 160. The early frontier ministry was often lonely and dangerous. Samuel Wakefield's hymn describes a circuit rider's family anxiously waiting for the preacher's return; the final stanza reads :Yet still they look with glistening eye, :Till lo! a herald hastens nigh; :He comes the tale of woe to tell, :How he, their prop and glory fell; :How died he in a stranger‚Äôs room, :How strangers laid him in the tomb, :How spoke he with his latest breath, :And loved and blessed them all in death.Christ-Janer, Albert, Charles W. Hughes, and Carleton Sprague Smith. American Hymns Old and New. New York: Columbia University Press, 1980. p.380. Bishop Francis Asbury Francis Asbury (1745‚Äì1816), the founding bishop of American Methodism, established the precedent for circuit riding. Together with his driver and partner \\"Black Harry\\" Hosier, he traveled 270,000 miles and preached 16,000 sermons as he made his way up and down early America supervising clergy. He brought the concept of the circuit from English Methodism, where it still exists: British Methodist churches are grouped in circuits, which typically include a dozen or more churches, and ministers are appointed (\\"stationed\\") to the circuit, not to the local church. A typical English circuit has two or three times as many churches as ministers, the balance of the services being led by lay Methodist local preachers or retired (\\"supernumerary\\") ministers. The title circuit rider, however, was an American coinage born of American necessities. Although John Wesley, the founder of Methodism, covered enormous distances on horseback during his career, and early British Methodist preachers also rode around their circuits, in general they had far less formidable traveling commitments than their American counterparts. The end of circuit riding It makes sense to date the beginning of circuit riding at the Christmas Conference of 1784, but it is much more difficult to date the end of circuit riding because it was never an official category of ministry, so it never appeared in Annual Conference records. The U.S. census eliminated \\"frontier\\" as a category in 1890,Riegel, Robert E. America Moves West (Third edition). New York: Henry Holt and Co., 1956, p.633 but the need for \\"old fashioned\\" circuits generally ended much earlier, sometime before the U.S. Civil War. Whenever Methodist Episcopal congregations became well established, bishops would appoint clergy to groupings of small congregations rather than the territories to which earlier clergy had been appointed. Of course, this development moved west as the U.S. frontier moved west.For any specific area of the U.S., this development can be traced in the Methodist \\"Annual Conference Journals\\", available in the libraries of United Methodist seminaries. Modern Methodist practices As well as being constantly on the move between the churches in their charge, Methodist ministers were regularly moved between charges, a principal known as itinerancy. Although most charges in the United States now consist of a single church, the tradition of itinerancy is still alive and functioning today in American Methodism, as it is in most Methodist Churches worldwide. Although not moving as frequently as in the past, the average U.S. United Methodist Church pastor will stay at a local church for 2‚Äì5 years before being appointed to another charge at the Annual Conference (although technically, every pastor is assigned to a charge every year, it is just usually the same one). In British Methodism, ministers are normally appointed to a circuit for five years (again, they are stationed there annually by the Conference); the Conference may not station someone beyond this period without an invitation from the Circuit Meeting for that minister to remain in the circuit, but it is unusual for a minister to stay for longer than seven or eight years in one circuit. Examples Possibly the most famous circuit rider was Peter Cartwright, who wrote two autobiographies.Cartwright, Peter (Ed. W. P. Strickland). Autobiography of Peter Cartwright the Backwoods Preacher. Cincinnati: Cranston and Curts, 1856; Cartwright, Peter (Ed. W. S. Hooper). Fifty Years as a Presiding Elder. Cincinnati: Hitchcock and Walden, 1871. John B. Matthias was an early circuit rider from New York state who is credited with having written a gospel hymn, \\"Palms of Victory.\\" Wilbur Fisk, who became an educator, served as a circuit rider for three years. It was not uncommon for clergy to serve on circuits for a few years and then go to other work. Kentucky native Eli P. Farmer, a circuit rider for the Methodist Episcopal Church on the Indiana frontier from 1825 to 1839, became a Bloomington, Indiana, farmer, newspaper editor, and businessman.

The father of outlaw John Wesley Hardin, James \\"Gip\\" Hardin, was a Methodist preacher and circuit rider in the mid-1800s. Hardin's father traveled over much of central Texas on his preaching circuit until 1869 when he and his family settled in Sumpter, Trinity County, Texas where he established a school ‚Äì also named for John Wesley, the founder of Methodism. Thomas S. Hinde was a Methodist circuit rider in Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky and Missouri from the early 1800s until about 1825. He eventually settled in Mount Carmel, Illinois, the town he had earlier founded. Hinde was a notable minister, newspaper publisher, attorney, real estate entrepreneur and clerk for the Ohio House of Representatives. More than 47 volumes of his personal and business documents are among the Lyman Draper collection at the Wisconsin Historical Society, since they were donated after his death by his son in law Charles H. Constable. Father Pierre Yves K√©ralum was a Catholic priest who ministered to ranchers in the Lower Rio Grande Valley from 1853 to 1872. He was one of about thirty Catholic priests known as the Cavalry of Christ because they traveled on horseback. K√©ralum was also an architect who designed and helped build churches such as the Immaculate Conception Cathedral in Brownsville, Texas, as well as chapels, rectories, and other buildings in the region. In culture In retrospect, the circuit rider became a romantic figure and was featured in a number of novels in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Two of the better known novels are Edward Eggleston's The Circuit Rider.Eggleston, Edward. The Circuit Rider: A Tale of the Heroic Age. New York: Scribner's, 1878, 1902. Available as a Google Book and Ernest Thompson Seton's Preacher of Cedar Mountain.Seton, Ernest Thompson. The Preacher of Cedar Mountain. New York: Grosset & Dunlap, 1917. Available as a Google Book A circuit rider is also a character in the Newbery Award‚Äìwinning novel for children, \\"Caddie Woodlawn\\", set in western Wisconsin in the 1860s.Brink, Carol Ryrie. Caddie Woodlawn. New York: Simon & Schuster, 1935. During the 1970s, prior to its sign-off message, Richmond, Virginia television station WWBT broadcast \\"Justice and The Circuit Rider\\", a rural preacher appearing on his mount, Justice, and presenting a brief parable using props from his saddlebag. These spots also appeared on the Richmond ABC affiliate WXEX, now operating as WRIC-TV just after the end of \\"Shock Theater\\". In these short films, the host was identified only as the Circuit Rider from Cobbs Creek, Virginia at the end of the three-minute segment. The preacher was William B. Livermon, Sr., who served several Virginia churches during his lifetime before passing away in 1992. Inspired by the story of Catholic circuit rider Pierre Yves K√©ralum, author Paul Horgan wrote a fictionalized account of the priest's last days titled The Devil in the Desert (1952). Autobiographies The first-person accounts of pioneer circuit riders give insight to the culture of the early United States as well as the theology and sociology of religion (and especially Methodism) in the young nation. Quite a few circuit riders published memoirs. These are generally available in the collections of United Methodist seminary libraries. The United Library of Garrett-Evangelical Theological Seminary and Seabury- Western Theological Seminary (Evanston, Illinois) seems to have the largest collection of these writings, including over 70 items. (Search books for the subject heading, \\"Methodist Episcopal Church --Clergy --Biography,\\" and look for 19th Century publications.) Through his role as chairman of the United Methodist editorial committee in Shreveport, Louisiana in the latter 1970s, the historian Walter M. Lowrey spearheaded a project, A History of Louisiana Methodism, which includes material on the church's extensive network of circuit riders.

The majority of the Champlain Heights area is leasehold property, with many of those leases attached to Coop/ affordable housing. The co-ops now at the end of their leases are facing steep increases in unit housing charges, some as much as 200%, and years of negotiations with the city due to these increases. Everett Crowley Park, a 40-hectare park (the city's 5th largest) and a former city landfill, is located in the area. The park is named after Everett Crowley, former city planner and parks board commissioner. Everett Crowley Park is the home of the longest Earth Day Celebration in the City.http://www.earthdayvancouver.org/ The City has been using this celebration as part of its long term reforestation project for the Park. The education in the area is serviced by Champlain Heights Community School, designed by one of Canada's foremost architects, Arthur Erickson. Champlain Heights Community School services grades from kindergarten to grade seven. The school has many different extracurricular programs such as a photography club, knitting club, volleyball team, and basketball team. There is also an annex located on Champlain Crescent which provides education to children in kindergarten to grade three. The Annex also provides program space to other community groups which include a program for children age newborn to five years old and their caregivers or parents as well as community space to the nearby public recreation centre. Those moving on to grade four from the annex usually transfer to the main school.

Corruption scandal  PC (as he was colloquially known) was a successful and famous campaign treasurer in Alagoas and a relatively unsuccessful businessman before associating himself with Collor in 1981. As campaign treasurer, PC typically collected much more than he spent on the campaign. The remainder (which was estimated to be over 50 million US dollars) was invested in his own businesses (such as an air taxi service) or hidden in anonymous overseas accounts. Once Collor was elected, PC Farias masterminded the vast corruption scheme that rendered Collor's presidency a high-priced toll booth for government favors. He set up dummy companies to collect bribes, with 30 percent of the money going to him and 70 percent to Collor. Politics, Passion and Graft at Issue in Rio Slayings, The New York Times, June 28, 1996 As much as US $9 million went to PC's accounts between 1990 and 1992. As the corruption scandal emerged in 1992, it was revealed that a fraction of money from PC's businesses was sent directly to Collor to finance the president's personal expenditures, including household staff and extensive landscaping at his home in Bras√≠lia. After Collor's impeachment, PC fled to the UK and Thailand, where he was arrested by the Interpol and extradited back to Brazil. In 1994 he was condemned to 7 years in prison. He was released in December 1995 by an indult from the Brazilian president Fernando Henrique Cardoso.  Murder  In 1996, PC and his young girlfriend Suzana Marcolino were found both dead, shot by a .38 Special caliber Rossi revolver in PC's beach house in Macei√≥. Local police ascribed the deaths to a crime of passion, where Suzana, fearing the imminent dissolution of the relationship, shot PC and then herself. Others would claim it was a form of \\"destruction of evidence\\" over what PC may know and subsequently reveal. In 1999, both their bodies were exhumed and subjected to another round of forensic examinations by three separate experts from three different institutions. Their conclusions were that while there was not enough evidence to rule out suicide, there was evidence to suggest it was not a suicide.

The amount of ripple in each band is independently adjustable, and no other filter of equal order can have a faster transition in gain between the passband and the stopband, for the given values of ripple (whether the ripple is equalized or not). Alternatively, one may give up the ability to adjust independently the passband and stopband ripple, and instead design a filter which is maximally insensitive to component variations. As the ripple in the stopband approaches zero, the filter becomes a type I Chebyshev filter. As the ripple in the passband approaches zero, the filter becomes a type II Chebyshev filter and finally, as both ripple values approach zero, the filter becomes a Butterworth filter. The gain of a lowpass elliptic filter as a function of angular frequency œâ is given by: :G_n(\\\\omega) = {1 \\\\over \\\\sqrt{1 + \\\\epsilon^2 R_n^2(\\\\xi,\\\\omega/\\\\omega_0)}} where Rn is the nth-order elliptic rational function (sometimes known as a Chebyshev rational function) and :\\\\omega_0 is the cutoff frequency :\\\\epsilon is the ripple factor :\\\\xi is the selectivity factor The value of the ripple factor specifies the passband ripple, while the combination of the ripple factor and the selectivity factor specify the stopband ripple.  Properties  The frequency response of a fourth-order elliptic low-pass filter with Œµ = 0.5 and Œæ = 1.05. Also shown are the minimum gain in the passband and the maximum gain in the stopband, and the transition region between normalized frequency 1 and Œæ A closeup of the transition region of the above plot. * In the passband, the elliptic rational function varies between zero and unity. The gain of the passband therefore will vary between 1 and 1/\\\\sqrt{1+\\\\epsilon^2}. * In the stopband, the elliptic rational function varies between infinity and the discrimination factor L_n which is defined as: :L_n=R_n(\\\\xi,\\\\xi)\\\\, :The gain of the stopband therefore will vary between 0 and 1/\\\\sqrt{1+\\\\epsilon^2L_n^2}. * In the limit of \\\\xi \\\\rightarrow \\\\infty the elliptic rational function becomes a Chebyshev polynomial, and therefore the filter becomes a Chebyshev type I filter, with ripple factor Œµ * Since the Butterworth filter is a limiting form of the Chebyshev filter, it follows that in the limit of \\\\xi \\\\rightarrow \\\\infty, \\\\omega_0 \\\\rightarrow 0 and \\\\epsilon \\\\rightarrow 0 such that \\\\epsilon\\\\,R_n(\\\\xi,1/\\\\omega_0)=1 the filter becomes a Butterworth filter * In the limit of \\\\xi \\\\rightarrow \\\\infty, \\\\epsilon \\\\rightarrow 0 and \\\\omega_0\\\\rightarrow 0 such that \\\\xi\\\\omega_0=1 and \\\\epsilon L_n=\\\\alpha, the filter becomes a Chebyshev type II filter with gain ::G(\\\\omega)=\\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{1+\\\\frac{1}{\\\\alpha^2 T^2_n(1/\\\\omega)}}}  Poles and zeroes  Log of the absolute value of the gain of an 8th order elliptic filter in complex frequency space (s = œÉ + jœâ) with Œµ = 0.5, Œæ = 1.05 and œâ0 = 1\\\\. The white spots are poles and the black spots are zeroes. There are a total of 16 poles and 8 double zeroes. What appears to be a single pole and zero near the transition region is actually four poles and two double zeroes as shown in the expanded view below. In this image, black corresponds to a gain of 0.0001 or less and white corresponds to a gain of 10 or more. An expanded view in the transition region of the above image, resolving the four poles and two double zeroes. The zeroes of the gain of an elliptic filter will coincide with the poles of the elliptic rational function, which are derived in the article on elliptic rational functions. The poles of the gain of an elliptic filter may be derived in a manner very similar to the derivation of the poles of the gain of a type I Chebyshev filter. For simplicity, assume that the cutoff frequency is equal to unity. The poles (\\\\omega_{pm}) of the gain of the elliptic filter will be the zeroes of the denominator of the gain. Using the complex frequency s=\\\\sigma+j\\\\omega this means that: :1+\\\\epsilon^2R_n^2(-js,\\\\xi)=0\\\\, Defining -js=\\\\mathrm{cd}(w,1/\\\\xi) where cd() is the Jacobi elliptic cosine function and using the definition of the elliptic rational functions yields: :1+\\\\epsilon^2\\\\mathrm{cd}^2\\\\left(\\\\frac{nwK_n}{K},\\\\frac{1}{L_n}\\\\right)=0\\\\, where K=K(1/\\\\xi) and K_n=K(1/L_n). Solving for w :w=\\\\frac{K}{nK_n}\\\\mathrm{cd}^{-1}\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\pm j}{\\\\epsilon},\\\\frac{1}{L_n}\\\\right)+\\\\frac{mK}{n} where the multiple values of the inverse cd() function are made explicit using the integer index m. The poles of the elliptic gain function are then: :s_{pm}=i\\\\,\\\\mathrm{cd}(w,1/\\\\xi)\\\\, As is the case for the Chebyshev polynomials, this may be expressed in explicitly complex form :s_{pm}=\\\\frac{a+jb}{c} :a=-\\\\zeta_n\\\\sqrt{1-\\\\zeta_n^2}\\\\sqrt{1-x_m^2}\\\\sqrt{1-x_m^2/\\\\xi^2} :b=x_m\\\\sqrt{1-\\\\zeta_n^2(1-1/\\\\xi^2)} :c=1-\\\\zeta_n^2+x_i^2\\\\zeta_n^2/\\\\xi^2 where \\\\zeta_n is a function of n,\\\\,\\\\epsilon and \\\\xi and x_m are the zeroes of the elliptic rational function. \\\\zeta_n is expressible for all n in terms of Jacobi elliptic functions, or algebraically for some orders, especially orders 1,2, and 3. For orders 1 and 2 we have :\\\\zeta_1=\\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{1+\\\\epsilon^2}} :\\\\zeta_2=\\\\frac{2}{(1+t)\\\\sqrt{1+\\\\epsilon^2}+\\\\sqrt{(1-t)^2+\\\\epsilon^2(1+t)^2}} where :t=\\\\sqrt{1-1/\\\\xi^2} The algebraic expression for \\\\zeta_3 is rather involved (See ). The nesting property of the elliptic rational functions can be used to build up higher order expressions for \\\\zeta_n: :\\\\zeta_{m\\\\cdot n}(\\\\xi,\\\\epsilon)= \\\\zeta_m\\\\left(\\\\xi,\\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{1}{\\\\zeta_n^2(L_m,\\\\epsilon)}-1}\\\\right) where L_m=R_m(\\\\xi,\\\\xi).  Minimum Q-factor elliptic filters  upright=2thumbright The normalized Q-factors of the poles of an 8-th order elliptic filter with Œæ = 1.1 as a function of ripple factor Œµ. Each curve represents four poles, since complex conjugate pole pairs and positive- negative pole pairs have the same Q-factor. (The blue and cyan curves nearly coincide). The Q-factor of all poles are simultaneously minimized at ŒµQmin = 1 / = 0.02323... See . Elliptic filters are generally specified by requiring a particular value for the passband ripple, stopband ripple and the sharpness of the cutoff. This will generally specify a minimum value of the filter order which must be used. Another design consideration is the sensitivity of the gain function to the values of the electronic components used to build the filter. This sensitivity is inversely proportional to the quality factor (Q-factor) of the poles of the transfer function of the filter. The Q-factor of a pole is defined as: :Q =-\\\\frac{s_{pm}}{2\\\\mathrm{Re} (s_{pm})} = -\\\\frac{1}{2\\\\cos(\\\\arg(s_{pm}))} and is a measure of the influence of the pole on the gain function. For an elliptic filter, it happens that, for a given order, there exists a relationship between the ripple factor and selectivity factor which simultaneously minimizes the Q-factor of all poles in the transfer function: :\\\\epsilon_{Qmin}=\\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{L_n(\\\\xi)}} This results in a filter which is maximally insensitive to component variations, but the ability to independently specify the passband and stopband ripples will be lost. For such filters, as the order increases, the ripple in both bands will decrease and the rate of cutoff will increase. If one decides to use a minimum-Q elliptic filter in order to achieve a particular minimum ripple in the filter bands along with a particular rate of cutoff, the order needed will generally be greater than the order one would otherwise need without the minimum-Q restriction. An image of the absolute value of the gain will look very much like the image in the previous section, except that the poles are arranged in a circle rather than an ellipse. They will not be evenly spaced and there will be zeroes on the œâ axis, unlike the Butterworth filter, whose poles are arranged in an evenly spaced circle with no zeroes. Comparison with other linear filters Here is an image showing the elliptic filter next to other common kind of filters obtained with the same number of coefficients: upright=3.6 As is clear from the image, elliptic filters are sharper than all the others, but they show ripples on the whole bandwidth.

Charles Lindbergh's nonstop solo crossing of the Atlantic Ocean in 1927 heightened city officials' interest to establish air operations in Charleston. In 1928, the City of Charleston rented land and began operating a simple airfield about twelve miles north of city limits. Foreseeing a commercial future in air travel, the city formed the Charleston Aircraft Corporation to acquire the land for a municipal airport. In May 1931, the corporation purchased for $25,000 from the South Carolina Mining and Manufacturing Company. Later in the year, the city acquired the airport facility for $60,000 and immediately began improvements. During the 1930s, airport operations expanded to keep pace with advances in general and commercial aviation being experienced throughout the country. Despite the Great Depression, the Federal Government stepped in to assist the city with modernizing the airport. In 1935, the Works Progress Administration poured $313,000 into the airport. Workers paved one and constructed a second . The project also improved upon the existing lighting system with up-to-date field lighting. Given the continuing growth in passenger aviation, Pan American Airways selected Charleston Airport as its western terminus for trans-Atlantic flights. Although this plan never came to fruition, it contributed to a burgeoning increase in traffic for the airport. As a result, the city purchased 300 more acres (120 ha) of land surrounding the airport for $300,000 in 1937 to accommodate additional service buildings and hangars. = World War II = In 1939, with world tensions heightening, the United States Army Air Corps began a massive buildup of troops, bases, and equipment in preparation for war. As a result, Charleston acquired more land in 1940 for additional airport improvements that included construction of a hangar and administration building and lengthening of the runways to 5,000 feet. Prior to the U.S. entering World War II, in 1941 the War Department allotted another $199,000 to the Charleston Airport for runway extension and other improvements needed for aircraft dispersal against attack After the Pearl Harbor attack on 7 December 1941, the 56th Pursuit Group based at Charlotte Airport, North Carolina, and its 61st Pursuit Squadron arrived at the Charleston airport. The squadron's P-39 Airacobra and P-40 Warhawk aircraft provided coastal defense operations for the Southern Defense Command, Third Air Force, Carolina Sector. Arriving later that month, the 67th Observation Group, 107th Observation Squadron and the Federalized 105 Observation Squadron (Tennessee National Guard) provided antisubmarine patrols along the east coast with North American O-47 and Stinson O-49 Vigilant observation aircraft. On 11 December the War Department assumed de facto control of Charleston Municipal Airport yet allowed Delta and Eastern commercial airlines to continue their civilian operations. Although Air Corps personnel had operated from the airport since the war began, true occupancy did not take place until 23 March 1942 when the city of Charleston and the War Department signed a lease and formally activated the installation. Effective 1 April 1942, the base was assigned to Air Service Command and 29th Air Base Group, Distribution Point No. 2 became the first host unit responsible for building, maintaining and operating the installation infrastructure. On 9 June that same year, the base transferred to First Air Force and was officially named Charleston Army Air Base on 22 October 1942. The installation transferred back to Air Service Command in December 1942, then moved back to First Air Force in September 1943 where it remained until the end of the war. At the same time as the base struggled to find its niche, the 16th Antisubmarine Squadron operated B-34 Lexington bombers helping defend the eastern seaboard from possible attack. On 31 March 1944, Johns Island Army Airfield became an auxiliary of Charleston AAB, providing an emergency landing field for the base. Renamed Charleston Army Air Field on 15 June 1943, initially the base served mainly as an air depot training station, providing the final phase of training to service groups and air depot groups departing home for the war overseas. Concurrent with its reassignment to First Air Force, in September 1943 the base changed missions. Now it would give the final phase of training to B-24 Liberator crews. The 454th Bombardment Group arrived in September and left Charleston for the European Theater of Operations in December 1943. This same month the 400th Bombardment Group arrived, but this organization was to function as a replacement training unit rather than an operational training unit. On 10 April 1944, the 113th Army Air Field Base Unit (CCTS-H) activated and took over as Charleston's host unit. But the need for B-24 crews ended with Germany's defeat and end of the war in Europe. In their place, however, the Army Air Force required a large number of transport crews. Consequently, the base was transferred to Air Transport Command on 1 June 1945 and began C-54 Skymaster crew training that lasted until late August 1945. Only a few months after the Japanese surrender, on 25 April 1946 the government placed the base in surplus status as part of the massive postwar draw down. The city of Charleston requested that the field, which originally had been leased to the U.S. Army for $1 per year, be returned to the municipality. By this time, the field consisted of with more than $12 million worth of facilities and improvements. Despite not being official returned to the city until 19 October 1948, the city council voted to construct a new air terminal in 1947, and commercial air operations resumed on a full-time basis at the now fully civilian airport. = Cold War = As a result of the Cold War, the now independent United States Air Force requesting funds from Congress to begin troop carrier operations at the Charleston airport. By August 1951, Congress approved a $28 million public works improvement package, and during the remainder of the year, preliminary work was underway to construct facilities for a troop carrier wing. In March 1952, the city of Charleston signed a lease agreement with the Air Force for joint use of the airport. For $1 per year the lease allowed the U.S. Air Force to occupy all properties south and west of the Southern Railway's tracks while the city retained terminal buildings, hangars, and other buildings along the north and east boundaries of the airport. Construction of base facilities, meanwhile, began in May 1952. By early 1953, elements of the 456th Troop Carrier Wing, assigned to Tactical Air Command, arrived at Charleston to prepare the base for operational status. On 1 June 1953, the base received its current name of Charleston Air Force Base and activated on 1 August. Two weeks later, on 15 August 1953, the arrival of 50 C-119 Flying Boxcars effectively made the base operational. Although numerous construction projects were still underway, the wing held a dedication ceremony on 13 November 1953 to open the base officially. = Worldwide Airlift = With the 456th already in place, advance elements of the newly activated 1608th Air Transport Group, assigned to Military Air Transport Command (later, Military Airlift Command), first arrived in February 1954 to establish operations. One month later on 4 March 1954, the group received its first C-54 Skymaster transport. As the 1608th increased in size, MATS and TAC negotiated ownership of the base. Eventually, on 1 March 1955, Charleston AFB came under the jurisdiction and control of MATS and the 1608th Air Transport Wing (Medium) became the base's host unit. Also upon assignment to MATS, the base became the terminus for all C-54 airlift to Europe and the Near East. On 16 February 1954, Air Defense Command established the 444th Fighter- Interceptor Squadron as a tenant unit on Charleston flying F-86D Sabre fighter aircraft as the east coast's air defense against airborne invaders. Soon after, the base achieved permanent status and with that declaration MATS began various facility construction projects to further improve upon the base's status. Meanwhile, the 1608th received its first C-121C Constellation appropriately named \\"City of Charleston\\" on 16 September 1955 (tail number 54-153). Shortly thereafter the base was designated as an aerial port of embarkation, giving Charleston AFB more prominent role in MATS. Tactical Air Command and the 456th left Charleston on 16 October 1955, which also ended the base's association with the C-119 Flying Boxcars. Charleston AFB underwent a significant change on 18 June 1958 when the 1608th received its first C-124C Globemaster aircraft, then again a month later when it lost its last C-54 transports. The 444th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron's aircraft changed as well. In February 1960, it began operating F-101 Voodoo aircraft and lost its F-86Ds. The next big change came in 1962. The Air Force decided to retire the C-121 fleet and sent the 1608th its first replacement C-130 Hercules on 16 August 1962. The last C-121 Connie left Charleston AFB on 9 February 1963. Only two years later, on 14 August 1965, the wing received its first C-141 Starlifter, the newest airlifter in the Air Force inventory. But, unlike the previous aircraft changes, the arrival of this new aircraft meant a change in host units. On 8 January 1966, the 437th Military Airlift Wing took over as Charleston AFB's host unit. Although the 1608th inactivated and the 437th activated its place, it appeared that every unit with a \\"1608\\" in its name simply changed it to \\"437.\\" All of the 1608th's people, aircraft, buildings, etc. became the 437th's. The operational history of Charleston AFB is now inextricably tied to the 437th Airlift Wing's history. Soon after the wing's arrival, on 30 September 1968 the 444th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron inactivated, ending Charleston AFB's long-standing association with air defense and fighter aircraft. In September 1969, the Air Force Reserve Command's 943d Military Airlift Group activated at Charleston AFB making it the first associate unit in the southeastern United States. On 1 July 1973, the 315th Military Airlift Wing (Associate) activated and replaced the 943d as the 437th's associate Reserve wing, similar to how the 437th replaced the 1608th a few years earlier. = From the 1990s = In 1992, following the disestablishment of MAC as part of an Air Force-wide reorganization, the 437th Military Airlift Wing (437 MAW) was placed under the newly established Air Mobility Command (AMC) and redesignated as the 437th Airlift Wing (437 AW) and 315th Airlift Wing (315 AW), respectively. Today, the 437 AW and 315 AW (Associate) operate the C-17 Globemaster III. The base has also maintained an alert site for fighter-interceptor aircraft (primarily Air National Guard aircraft) of Tactical Air Command (TAC) and Air Combat Command (ACC), conducting the continental air defense mission. The last unit to occupy the alert site was a detachment of F-16 aircraft from the 158th Fighter Wing of the Vermont Air National Guard. Detachment operations officially ended at the end of FY99, with the facility placed in caretaker status. However, since 11 September 2001, the facility has seen intermittent operations by various USAF fighter aircraft of the Active and Reserve Components resuming the continental air defense mission under the cognizance of United States Northern Command and NORAD. In FY 2014-2015 the alert site and associated hangar were demolished. = Major commands to which assigned = * Air Service Command, 1 April 1942 * First Air Force, 9 June 1942 * Air Service Command : Designated for concurrent use by Army Air Forces Antisubmarine Command, 19 December 1942 * First Air Force, 17 September 1943 * Air Transport Command, 1 June 1945 ‚Äì 29 April 1946. * Tactical Air Command, : Eighteenth Air Force, 23 April 1952 ‚Äì 1 March 1955 * Air Defense Command (Attached) 16 February 1954 ‚Äì 30 September 1968 : Eastern Air Defense Force, 16 February 1954 ‚Äì 1 January 1960 * Military Air Transport Service : Eastern Transport Air Force, 1 March 1955 : Redesignated: Military Airlift Command : Twenty-First Air Force, 1 January 1966 ‚Äì 1 June 1992 * Air Mobility Command : Twenty-First Air Force, 1 June 1992 ‚Äì 1 October 2003 : Eighteenth Air Force, 1 October 2003 ‚Äì present = Major units assigned = * 67th Observation Group, 23 December 1941 ‚Äì 26 January 1942 * 421st Base HQ and Air Base Squadron, 1 November 1942 ‚Äì 10 April 1944 * 521st Bombardment Squadron : Redesignated 16th Antisubmarine Squadron, 18 October 1942 ‚Äì 18 September 1943 * Charleston Air Defense Region, 1 January 1943 ‚Äì 10 April 1944 * 36th Fighter Group, 22 June ‚Äì 14 September 1943 * 400th Bombardment Group, 15 December 1943 ‚Äì 10 April 1944 * 454th Bombardment Group, 3 October ‚Äì 10 April 1944 * 113th AAF Base Unit, 10 April 1944 ‚Äì 31 May 1945 * 389th Bombardment Group, 12 June 1945 ‚Äì 13 September 1945 * 392d Bombardment Group, 25 June 1945 ‚Äì 13 September 1945 * 593d AAF Base Unit, 20 May 1945 ‚Äì 25 April 1946 * 456th Troop Carrier Wing, (TAC) 1 August 1953 ‚Äì 16 October 1955 * 444th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron, (ADC) 16 February 1954 ‚Äì 30 September 1968 * Aerial Port of Embarkation, 3 January 1956 ‚Äì 15 February 1978 * 1608th Air Transport Group, 15 January 1954 : Redesignated 1608th Air Transport Wing, 1 March 1955 : Redesignated: 437th Military Airlift (later Airlift) Wing, 8 January 1966 ‚Äì present * 315th Military Airlift (later Airlift) Wing, 1 July 1973‚Äìpresent * 628th Air Base Wing, 8 January 2010‚Äìpresent Mueller, Robert (1989).

The $30 million project to rebuild the deteriorating runway began 9 April 2009. Its completion was marked with the first take off and landing of a Charleston C-17. The runway now has newly paved asphalt overruns, and asphalt-paved shoulders, both of which the runway lacked. The runway also has new edge lighting, distance remaining markers and runway end indicator lights on both ends. Because of that construction, larger and heavier aircraft were cleared to land on runway 03/21, which was key when work scheduled for Fiscal Year 2012 began on runway 15/33, the base's main runway. The last major work done on Joint Base Charleston runways was in 1968.

They are predatory fish, largely associated with reefs and are found in tropical and subtropical seas throughout the world. They are important target species for fisheries. Characteristics The fishes in the genus Epinephelus have elongate, subcylindrical bodies which may be oblong or deep and compressed in shape. The depth of the body varies between 2.3 and 3.7 times the standard length and head is usually around the same length as the body is deep. The preopercle can be rounded or angular and has a serrated rear edge with the serrations at the angle being enlarged to a lesser or greater extent. In a small number of species serrations are small and on the lower edge they are covered by skin. Caniform teeth are found at the front of jaws, although these can be rather small in a few species. They do not have any obviously enlarged caniform teeth in the middle of the lower jaw. There are teeth on the roof of the mouth. In adults, the maxilla does not have a noticeable bony protrusion on the lower rear angle, although they can have an deep step or hook-like process which is hidden by the upper lips, on the rear part of its lower edge. The dorsal fin normally contains 9 spines, although some species have 10, as well as 12 to 19 rays. The origin of the dorsal fin sits above the opercle and the soft rayed part is shorter than the spiny part. The anal fin contains 3 distinct spines and 7 to 10 soft rays. The pectoral fin is rounded with its middle rays being longer than the others longest. The caudal fin may be rounded, truncate or concave, contains 8 branched rays and 8 to 10 fin rays which are slender, unbranched and unsegmented (referred to as \\"procurrent\\") fin rays at the leading edges of he caudal fin on the upper lobe and 7 branched rays and 7 to 10 procurrent rays in the lower lobe. The body is covered in ctenoid or smooth scales. Habitat and biology Epinephelus groupers are occur mainly on coral or rocky reefs, although a small number of species have been recorded over substrates consisting of sand, silt or mud. A few species are found in deep water, down to at least , but the majority occur between . The two largest members of the genus, E. itajara and E. lanceolatus, either of which may attain a length in excess of and a weight greater than have frequently been recorded in estuaries and harbours. Most of the species in the genus Epinephelus are predatory fish which feed on larger invertebrates, mostly crustaceans, and other fishes taken on or close to the substrate. E. undulosus is an unusual grouper species distinguished by having many, long gill rakers and this species has been reported to feed on pelagic tunicates, at least on occasion. Only a few species have had their reproductive biology studied and many species appear to be protogynous hermaphrodites. However, in some species there are males in the populations which are smaller than some of the females, suggesting a more complex biology and this suggests that some females do not change sex, and that some males may not have a undergone a functional female stage. Distribution Epinephelus species are found around the world in tropical and subtropical seas and oceans. The greatest diversity occurs in the Indo-West Pacific, while 8 species are found in the eastern Pacific, 11 in the western Atlantic Ocean 9 species in the eastern Atlantic Ocean and the Mediterranean. Four species have entered the Mediterranean Sea from the Red Sea via the Suez Canal as Lessepsian migrants. Utilisation Epinephelus groupers are among the most valuable species exploited by commercial fishes in the world's tropical seas and they fetch some of the highest prices when marketed. They have also been used in aquaculture. Species The 89 recognized species in this genus are: Some of these species are placed in the genus Hyporthodus by some authorities, for example Epinephelus darwinensis is treated as Hyporthodus darwinensis by the Catalog of Fishes.

Revenue estimates detailed in the budget are raised through the Australian taxation system, with government spending (including transfers to the states) representing a sizeable proportion of the overall economy. Besides presenting the government's expected revenues and expenditures, the federal budget is also a political statement of the government's intentions and priorities, and has profound macroeconomic implications. Australia follows, to a great extent, the conventions of the Westminster system. For example, the prime minister must have the support of a majority in the House of Representatives, and must in any case be able to ensure the existence of no absolute majority against the government. In relation to the budget, that requires that if the House fails to pass the government's budget, even by one dollar, then the government must either resign so that a different government can be appointed or seek a parliamentary dissolution so that new general elections may be held in order to re-confirm or deny the government's mandate. Process The process of putting together the budget begins in November when the Central Budget Management System (CBMS)CBMS site finance.gov.au is updated with the latest estimates, and the senior ministers' review, where the Prime Minister, Treasurer, and Minister for Finance meet to establish the policy priorities and strategy for the coming financial year. The outcome of the senior ministers' review determines how the different portfolios will prepare their budget submissions for cabinet. Agencies within each portfolio do not submit a request for new funding, because their potential savings within the agency are unfounded. After Finance has agreed to the costings, the submissions are circulated for coordination comments and lodged with the cabinet office by late February. The Expenditure Review Committee (ERC), a committee of Cabinet, meets in March to consider all submissions. They decide which proposals will be funded and the level of funding each will receive. At the end of the ERC, the ad hoc revenue committee meets to make decisions on the revenue streams of the budget. A pre-budget review of the estimates is conducted after all decisions have been finalised to ensure that they are reflected in CBMS. Budget documentation commences at the end of the ERC process. Agencies prepare two components: the portfolio budget statements and the mid-year economic and fiscal outlook. The portfolio budget statements provide additional details and explanations of the budget and the statement of risks, which is included in Budget Paper No. 1. The final budget is presented and tabled in Parliament by the Treasurer on budget night as part of the Second Reading of the Appropriation Bill (No. 1), which \\"appropriates money out of the Consolidated Revenue Fund for the ordinary annual services of the government\\".Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2014‚Äì2015 Charter of Budget Honesty Act The budget has to be presented within the framework that has been established by the Charter of Budget Honesty Act (1998). The charter provides for: * sound fiscal management of the Australian economy * open dissemination about the status of public finances * transparency in Australia's fiscal policy Budget night Between 1901 and 1993, the practice was for the budget to be brought down in August, on the first Tuesday night of the Spring session.Budget Speech, 10 May 1994, Ralph Willis Since 1994, the Treasurer has presented the budget on the second Tuesday in May, with the exceptions of 1996 (due to an election and a change of government in March, the budget was brought down in August), 2016 (it was held on the first Tuesday in May to allow the government to potentially call a double dissolution election following the presentation of the budget), 2019 (when an election called for 18 May caused the budget to be brought forward to 2 April) and 2020 (when it was postponed to October due to the COVID-19 pandemic). On budget day, but before the presentation of the budget, the Treasurer spends the day behind locked doors briefing media and interest groups on various aspects of the budget. This is known as the budget lock- up.Invitation to the 2013‚Äì14 lock-up Because of the market sensitive nature of some of the information which they are being provided, those invited to attend the briefings are not allowed access to the outside world until the budget has been presented in Parliament by the Treasurer, which normally commences at 7.30 pm. In modern times, the budget has been broadcast live from Parliament House on the ABC and Sky News Australia. It is hosted on the ABC, without interruption from 7:30 pm to 8 pm, normally followed up with a report by a panel assessing the changes, benefits and flaws in the budget. Additional budget documents and materials are available on the government budget website for other interested parties. A convention in Australian politics is that the Leader of the Opposition is given a \\"right of reply\\", which they deliver in Parliament two days after the government's budget speech, and which is also broadcast on television. Budgetary policy developments Large cyclical changes in cash receipts (in white) and payments (in black) reflect changes in the government's economic objectives. In comparison with similar economies,Key indicators of economic activity in Australia, such as cost-push inflation and manufacturing and retailing sector productivity, are usually compared with other Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development member countries. Australia's government spending is relatively low. For the twenty-year period from 1960 to 1980, the growth in spending roughly matched percentages in the much higher populated nations of Japan and the United States. In the first half of the 1980s, spending surged by approximately 3% of gross domestic product and the tax rate surpassed that of Ronald Reagan's administration. However, government accountability was a highly contentious issue in the late 1970s, and John Howard maintains that under Fraser \\"spending went up... at about two per cent per year in real terms... Reagan [didn't do] better than that\\".John Howard; quoted in As the debate played out, the free-market politicians turned to attacking the political parties which were in power in the Australian states, and public sector medium enterprises came to be seen as inefficient. The economic term \\"current account deficit\\" was in vogue. Riding on strong economic growth in the latter part of the 1980s, the Hawke Government brought forward an agenda for public sector reform that had been pioneered in the US. Declaring a number of debt reduction strategies ranging from tariff rate reductions to privatisation and competitive tendering, Australia's public sector significantly declined in the period. Spending in the 1990s saw significant shifts in social policy expenditure as part of a broader scheme of \\"low inflation targeting\\". Although outlays for services to industry increased, the budget outcome remained the same throughout the early 1990s recession. The Howard Government actually reduced expenditure by 1.3% of gross domestic product in its first two years, making large cutbacks to outlays for the hospital system and education. Overall the government continued to run down public debt and promote asset trading in the private sector.

An earlier prototype, the Skycycle X-1 designed by Doug Malewicki and retired U.S. Navy engineer Robert Truax. It was tested in November 1973 and dove in the Snake River. The Skycycle X-2 was designed by Truax, and ridden by Knievel in his attempt to jump the Snake River approximately west of Shoshone Falls near the city of Twin Falls, Idaho, on September 8, 1974. The parachute deployed during the launch, causing the stunt to fail.Evel Knievel's X-1 Skycycle, rocket powered CANYON JUMPING motorcycle! A later analysis showed that a design flaw in a mechanical parachute retention cover, which did not properly take base drag into account, caused the premature parachute deployment. Following the failed jump, Truax blamed Knievel for the failure and vice versa. Later, Truax accepted full responsibility for the failure. The jump Although the parachute deployed early, the aerial photographs show the X-2 cleared the canyon. However, the winds blew the rocket back to launch side, crashing at the bottom of the canyon, barely missing the river. Knievel stated that if the X-2 had landed in the water, he would have drowned, as he did not have the ability to release himself from the harness.Stuart Barker, Life of Evel Knievel, St. Martin's Press, 2008. In order to obtain permission from the State of Idaho to perform the canyon jump, the X-2 was registered as an airplane rather than a motorcycle.

In the era before cable networks, the Sunday afternoon jump was covered live by Top Rank on paid closed circuit television in several hundred theaters and arenas, promoted by Bob Arum with an average price of ten dollars. Taped coverage by ABC was shown on Wide World of Sports later in the month. The ticket price at the launch site was twenty-five dollars. The jump was pushed out of the newspaper headlines by the pardon of Richard Nixon by President Gerald Ford. Monument Monument near the Perrine Bridge A memorial to Knievel is located near the Perrine Bridge, which crosses the Snake River about west of the jump site. The monument was dedicated in September 1985, at a small ceremony attended by Knievel. Re-creation of the jump Since the 1974 launch, seven daredevils have expressed interest in recreating the jump, including Knievel's two sons Robbie and Kelly. Robbie announced he would recreate the jump in 2010. Stuntman Eddie Braun worked with Kelly and Robert Truax's son to recreate the jump using a replica of the Skycycle X-2.

The kaishakunin is standing at the rear with his sword raised and prepared to partially sever the head, cutting through the spinal column, of the person performing seppuku. A kaishakunin () is a person appointed to behead an individual who has performed seppuku, Japanese ritual suicide, at the moment of agony. The role played by the kaishakunin is called kaishaku (\\"nin\\" means person). Aside from being spared prolonged anguish until death, both the condemned and those on hand to observe are spared the spectacle of the writhing death throes that would ensue. The most recent kaishakunin of the 20th century was Hiroyasu Koga, who beheaded the novelist Yukio Mishima and political activist Masakatsu Morita during their seppuku. Ritual Still preserved in modern-day movements (kata) of the martial art Iaid≈ç, the ritual of performing kaishaku varies very little between Japanese fencing schools, but all of them are bound to the following steps to be performed by the kaishakunin: #First, the kaishakunin sits down in the upright (seiza) position, or remains standing, at the left side of the person about to commit seppuku, at a prudent distance but close enough to be reached with his sword (katana) at the appropriate time. #If seated, the kaishakunin will rise slowly, first on his knees, then stepping with the right foot while drawing the katana very slowly and silently and standing up in the same fashion (keeping in mind that the target (teki) is not an enemy, but rather a fellow samurai). If the kaishakunin was in a standing stance, he will draw his sword slowly and silently as well. In both cases, after the sword is out of the scabbard (saya), he will raise it with the right hand and wait for the seppuku to begin. Some classic (ko-ry≈´) Iaid≈ç styles, like the Mus≈ç Jikiden Eishin-ry≈´ school, establish this \\"waiting stance\\" as the kaishakunin having taken one step back with the right foot, katana behind his head parallel to the floor held with the right hand, left hand holding the scabbard in the proper (sayabiki) position; other styles, like Mus≈ç Shinden-ry≈´, establish that the katana is to be held vertically, parallel to the body, held in the right hand, the left hand resting at the kaishakunin side, feet together. In any case, the kaishakunin will always keep eye contact with the samurai performing seppuku, and waiting for his cut (kiri) through his abdomen (hara). #When the samurai actually performs the seppuku, and after he returns the dagger (tant≈ç) back to its place, the kaishakunin steps forward, letting the katana drop straight through the back of the neck of the dying samurai. Just before making contact, the kaishakunin grips the handle (tsuka) with both hands, giving precision to the katanas blade and strength to the downward cut (kiritsuke). The final cut must be controlled in order to reach only half the neck of the samurai; the kaishaku, leaving the required skin to hold the head attached to the samurai's body, was performed by a single slashing/withdrawing motion of the katana. The complete cut-slash-withdraw motion is called daki-kubi. After the dead samurai falls, the kaishakunin, with the same slow, silent style used when unsheathing the katana, shakes the blood off the blade (a movement called chiburi) and returns the katana to the scabbard (a movement called noto), while kneeling towards the fellow samurai's dead body. When this is completed, the kaishakunin remains kneeling for a while, as a sign of deep respect to the fallen samurai who performed the ritual suicide, always in a state of \\"total awareness\\" (zanshin) before standing up and bowing (rei) to his body. Role as executioner In some seppuku rituals, no disembowelment occurs. The condemned person merely moves the tant≈ç, or, sometimes, a wooden stick or fan, across his stomach, followed by a beheading by the kaishakunin. In this variation, the kaishakunin becomes in effect the executioner, and seppuku becomes effectively a beheading. In other seppuku rituals, the cut to the neck may be done as the condemned person simply reaches for the tanto. The reaching gave honor to the condemned, as he was exhibiting intent by doing so, and the \\"early\\" stroke of the sword could be dismissed as a small mistake in timing by an overzealous kaishakunin. In reality, this was planned ahead of time to spare the condemned the pain of actually trying to disembowel himself.

These vines became the basis for the contemporary vineyards of Baja California. The architecture of the mission is reminiscent of the medieval styles of the country of origin of Retz, with carved stone.

Calgary's Chinese Cultural Centre with its traditional architecture and decor (styled after the Temple of Heaven in Beijing) is the largest facility of its kind in North America. The Dragon City Mall is also located in this district. The area along Centre Street north of downtown and continuing for several blocks is also very Asian-influenced and is often thought of as the city's second Chinatown. International Avenue is also a major multi-ethnic centre in the city's southeast with considerable Asian influence. The community has an area redevelopment plan in place. History Chinatown Calgary Celebrates 100 Years In 2010, Calgary's Chinatown community celebrated 100 years of challenge, growth and prosperity on its way to becoming Canada's third largest Chinese community by population and its largest in area. But 100 years marks only the time since Chinatown settled in its permanent home in Calgary. Its actual history dates back to the mid-19th century when the struggles for Calgary's earliest Chinese citizens were just beginning. Railroaded by the Canadian Government Upon completion of the rail line to Canada's west coast (1885), the Canadian government reneged on its promise to provide Chinese rail workers return fare to their homeland. It also severely curtailed Chinese immigration, by way of a costly $500 head tax, leaving many displaced Chinese workers, predominately men, stranded in a strange land without their families. Strength in Unity Compelled to form protective and culturally supportive enclaves with their fellow countrymen, Calgary's first Chinese community took root beginning in the 1880s. It was located in the area of 8th Avenue and Centre Street on Calgary's eastern edge near the site of today's Glenbow Museum. A growing Chinese population, as well as a huge fire in 1886 that consumed much of the original Chinese district, forced the relocation of \\"Chinatown\\" south and west to 10th Avenue and 1st Street in the area today known as the \\"Beltline.\\" Less than ten years later, the Canadian Pacific Railway announced its plan to run tracks between 9th and 10th Avenues, as well as building the Palliser Hotel (now the Fairmont Palliser Hotel) and a railway station between Centre and First Street S.W. Again Calgary's Chinese community was displaced as property owners took advantage of suddenly soaring land values in the area. In turn, around 1910, several prosperous Chinese merchants bought land in what today is the heart of Chinatown near 2nd Avenue and Centre Street south. City Council rejected a public call for a deliberately segregated Chinese community and elected only to pass a bylaw regulating sleeping and living space in houses. Over the next decade, many organizations such as the Chinese Public School, Chinese Mission, the Chinese National League and Chinese YMCA were established giving Calgary's Chinese community substance and a sense of permanency, although at the time its population was considerably less than 1,000. With the repeal of the Chinese Exclusion Act in 1947, the City's Chinese population soared, more than doubling between 1951 and 1961. Many Chinese newcomers, however, opted to live outside Chinatown and the community began to fall into disrepair. Growth Without Vision Since rising in its present location, Calgary's Chinatown evolved without any formal development plan. Then, in 1966, Chinatown's survival was again threatened when the City released a draft Downtown Master Plan which proposed a major freeway, known as the \\"east-west downtown penetrator\\" to run as an extension of Bow Trail through downtown between second and third avenues; directly through the heart of Chinatown. After years of debate, protests and revision, City Council adopted the three-part, Bow Trail Staging Report in February 1970 with construction of the \\"east-west downtown penetrator\\" scheduled to begin in 1978. Taking Control of Destiny In response to the newly adopted Bow Trail Staging Report with its \\"east-west downtown penetrator\\" making community devastation almost a certainty, Chinatown residents, merchants and businessmen rallied together through the leadership of Calgary's first Chinese-Canadian Alderman and then Member of the Legislature for Calgary McCall, George Ho Lem. At a packed meeting in the Chinese United Church on November 18, 1973, the Calgary Chinatown Development Task Force (CCDTF) was born, with the full support of the Chinese community. Brian Lee, a future Alderman and member of the Legislative Assembly, was recruited as its coordinator. Under the chairmanship of George Ho Lem, the CCDTF set out to fight the \\"downtown penetrator\\" and insure Chinatown's survival. Initially, the CCDTF was entirely funded by two Chinese community organizations, the United Calgary Chinatown Association and the Sien Lok Society of Calgary. Sien Lok was formed in 1968 and counts among its many achievements the creation of Chinatown's Sien Lok Park. The CCDTF assembled a broad coalition of community leaders who worked for three years to author the Chinatown Design Brief, a comprehensive plan, notable primarily for its exclusion of the east-west downtown penetrator as well as a call for substantial improvements to housing, schools and cultural facilities within its boundaries. The Chinatown Design Brief was formally approved by City Council on November 9, 1976, ensuring the future integrity of Chinatown. The 30th Anniversary of the approval of the document that saved Chinatown was celebrated on the same date in 2006 with over 30 of the original Task Force members in attendance to receive long overdue recognition for their contributions. More Victories for Chinatown The Chinatown Development Task Force also played a role in the building of the Oi Kwan Foundation's seniors' housing project and later doubling its capacity as well as the construction of Bowside Manor, a ten-storey public-housing apartment building for low income and elderly Chinese Calgarians. In a marvellous example of community cooperation, land for the building was secured when George Ho Lem convinced the Lee Family Association and the Calgary Chinese School, both in aging buildings on either side of a large vacant lot, to pool their resources. Together, they purchased the middle vacant lot and developed the entire parcel for the good of the community. The result, Bowside Manor, was approved under the National Housing Act, and opened in April 1980. Management was handed to the Calgary Chinatown Development Foundation where it remains today. In addition to housing hundreds of Chinese tenants, Bowside Manor remains home to the Calgary Chinese School and the Lee Family Association which celebrated its 100th Anniversary on May 23, 2010. Another of the task force's achievements was its role as mediator between Chinatown and Canada Public Works when the federal government expropriated crucial Chinatown land for the planned Harry Hays Federal Building. While the project went ahead as planned, a large number of displaced, low-income Chinatown residents were relocated to significantly improved housing elsewhere. Chinatown Growth Continues With numerous elements of the Chinatown Design Brief including dozens of new commercial and apartment buildings, Family Associations and recreation and cultural activity centres such as the Dragon Mall and the Chinese Cultural Centre, (1982) Calgary's Chinatown is a proud and thriving community that has spilled over its formal boundaries and now occupies most of both sides of Centre Street North and west along 16th Ave. Calgary's Chinatown is the first Chinatown in Canada identified in local city bylaws. Calgary City Council approved a half million dollar budget for Chinatown's 100th Anniversary in 2010. Clearly, the district called a \\"festering sore\\" by the Calgary Herald in 1910 has blossomed like a lotus to become an unlikely success story among Chinatowns in North America. It is the second to oldest china town Demographics Chinatown between Bow River, Eau Claire and downtown core In the City of Calgary's 2012 municipal census, Chinatown had a population of living in dwellings, a 24.3% increase from its 2011 population of . With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2012. Residents in this community had a median household income of $16,174 in 2000 (the lowest in the city), and there were 57% low income residents living in the neighbourhood. As of 2000, 92.1% of the residents were immigrants. A proportion of 98.6% of the buildings were condominiums or apartments, and 86% of the housing was used for renting.

Bayley won gold medals for the Sprint and Team Sprint track cycling events at the 2002 Commonwealth Games in Manchester. His greatest success as a track cyclist came in the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, where he won gold medals in the sprint and Keirin events. Following Bayley's failure to win a medal at the World Cup round in Sydney in December 2007, he was criticized by Martin Barras, the national coach, for not developing his tactics. He was still employing the same final kick which achieved success in Athens, the opposition had learnt to attack early to counter this. In February 2008, tension was brewing between Bayley and his rival for Olympic selection, Shane Perkins. Both were deemed by the judges to be riding improperly at the Australian National Track Championships. Bayley crashed when Perkins moved down on him during a race, burning a hole in the back of his skinsuit. The relationship between the two riders was given another dimension, when Perkins announced his engagement to Bayley's younger sister, Kristine Bayley. Bayley was finally selected to ride at the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, as Perkins had not competed in any Team Sprint events. Bayley qualified in 12th place in the sprint event and eventually finished 11th, he was eliminated from the Keirin in the second round, placing 8th overall; he blamed himself for poor tactics. Bayley was also a member of the Team Sprint squad along with Daniel Ellis and Mark French, they qualified for the final ride-off for the bronze medal. After a strong start, they faded and finished fourth, missing out on a medal by 0.008 of a second. Bayley now lives in Brisbane with his wife and their two children.

In 1984, a second edition saw a print run of 4000 and new expanded version was released in 1992. Fringeworthy is famous for being the first alternate history adventure role-playing game ever published. In 2009, Tri Tac Games released a d20 Modern edition. Setting 2013: A Japanese research team in the Antarctic finds a gateway to Alien and Alternate Earths. Sayuri Tanuma became the first known Fringeworthy, a person with the special ability that lets one use the Fringepaths. She explored our local system and our nearest Alternate Earths, meeting an alien named Schmert.Fringeworthy , Homepage. The United Nations forms the United Nations Interdimensional Survey Service (UNISS) along with IDET (Inter-Dimensional Exploration Teams) to oversee the administration of the Fringepaths and their exploration. As a member of IDET, characters help explore other worlds, help other alternate worlds with their problems, and face down the menaces that exist on the Fringepaths. Players play characters with the 1-in-100,000 ability to use the equipment left behind by a race named the Tehrmelern. They created the pathways, called the fringes, that lead to other worlds and other places. The Mellor are a species of shape-changers, engineered by the Tehrmelern to aid in their undetected study and social uplift of other beings. Centuries ago, the Mellor became infected by some mysterious force that turned them to a path of indiscriminate genocide. As of 2013, they have nearly eradicated the Tehrmelern and have wiped out entire worlds of other races. They are a cunning and implacable enemy. Original system The game was written by Tri Tac Games founder Richard Tucholka, one of the creators of the game called The Morrow Project. He based it on a series of unpublished science fiction stories he wrote in the '70s. The original game system uses Tri Tac's Classic combat/rules model which is highly detailed. The game system makes it possible to use real weapons in the game as long as basic stats are known about the weapon, so an issue of Guns and Ammo magazine or Jane's Defence Weekly can be used as a Tri Tac game supplement. Character creation, like combat, in the Classic Edition, is highly \\"granular\\", with 15 basic attribute scores and between 6 and 19 secondary abilities and skills, many of which may be moderated by an Education Type attribute.

She is the younger daughter of U.S. President Lyndon B. Johnson and his wife, former First Lady Lady Bird Johnson. Early years Born in Washington, D.C., Johnson has an older sister Lynda Bird. Johnson's first name was originally spelled \\"Lucy\\"; she changed the spelling in her teens as a rebellion towards her parents. As her parents both had the initials LBJ, they named their two daughters to have these initials also. Although her father was a member of the Christian Church (Disciples of Christ), her mother was an Episcopalian, and she and her older sister, Lynda Bird, were raised as Episcopalians. Johnson converted to Roman Catholicism at the age of eighteen, when she requested and received conditional baptism. Johnson had been baptized with water and in the name of the Trinity at five months old by an Episcopal priest in Austin, Texas. Her rebaptism caused protests from leading figures in the Episcopal Church, which made headlines, as the Roman Catholic teaching does not require converts who are already baptized to receive baptism a second time. She was sixteen when President John F. Kennedy was assassinated in Dallas on November 22, 1963. Johnson heard of the assassination while attending a Spanish class at the National Cathedral School. She was unaware whether her father had been injured as well but realized he had been sworn in as the 36th President of the United States when Secret Service agents showed up on her school campus a few hours later. She later attended Georgetown University School of Nursing and Health Studies but dropped out in 1966 as the school prohibited married students (Johnson married her first husband in August 1966). Career Since 1993, Johnson has been the Chairman of the Board and manager of LBJ Asset Management Partners, a family office, as well as Chairman of the Board of BusinesSuites, a national operator of executive suites, which she co-founded with her husband in 1989. She received a BLS in Communication from St. Edward's University in 1997. She is on the Board of Directors of the LBJ Foundation and has served on multiple civic boards, raising funds for The Lady Bird Johnson Wildflower Center and the American Heart Association, acting as trustee of Boston University, and as a member of the advisory board of the Center for Battered Women.Baptism of Fire, Time, July 16, 1965 Personal life=Marriages and children All the Way movie premiere at the LBJ Presidential Library in 2016 On August 6, 1966, Johnson married Air National Guardsman Patrick John \\"Pat\\" Nugent in front of 700 guests at the Basilica of the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception in Washington, D.C.. The wedding was broadcast on television (drawing 55 million viewers) and was featured on the August 19, 1966, cover of Life magazine. They had four children: Patrick Lyndon (born 1967), now a lawyer and a pilot in San Antonio; Nicole Marie (born 1970); Rebekah Johnson (born 1974); and Claudia Taylor Nugent (born 1976). The couple later divorced, and the marriage was annulled by the Catholic Church in August 1979.Lady Bird Johnson, former first lady, dies at 94, Catholic priest at her bedside - Catholic Online On March 3, 1984, she married Ian J. Turpin (born 1944), a Scottish-born Canadian financier; he is president of LBJ Asset Management Partners at LBJ Ranch. Through that marriage, she has a stepson. Health issues In April 2010, Johnson was diagnosed with Guillain‚ÄìBarr√© syndrome (also known as Landry's paralysis), an autoimmune disorder affecting the peripheral nervous system. She was flown to the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, to begin treatment. Johnson returned to Austin in May 2010. Her doctor called her case \\"less severe than usual,\\" and she experienced a full recovery.

He is best known for his time with Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW), where he became notorious for his willingness to take dangerous bumps and his stiff hardcore wrestling style, often taking high risks and \\"shooting\\" on opponents, including in the infamous 1996 Mass Transit incident. He is also known for being the only wrestler to have had his theme song (\\"Natural Born Killaz\\" by Ice Cube and Dr. Dre) play throughout his matches in ECW. He committed extreme acts of violence in wrestling rings. Professional wrestling career=United States Wrestling Association (1992‚Äì1993) Young trained under Ray Candy and debuted in 1992 in the Memphis, Tennessee-based United States Wrestling Association (USWA), where he adopted the name New Jack, inspired by the movie New Jack City. In June 1993, he won his first championship, the USWA World Tag Team Championship with his partner Homeboy, defeating Simply Devine for the titles. They would hold onto the titles for two weeks before losing them to C.W. Bergstrom and Melvin Penrod, Jr. He would remain with the company until the end of the summer. North Georgia Wrestling Alliance (1993‚Äì1994) After leaving Memphis, New Jack, returned to Atlanta and wrestled for North Georgia Wrestling Alliance, and won their WorldHeavyweight Championship. In early 1994, he paired up with former WCW enhancement talent Mustafa Saed and formed The Gangstas, and won NGWA Tag Team Championship in July 1994, but quickly vacated them, as they left the territory. Smoky Mountain Wrestling (1994‚Äì1995) New Jack earned his name working for Jim Cornette in Smoky Mountain Wrestling. He formed a wrestling crew called the Gangstas. He toured the south and was normally squared off against Southern babyface tag team the Rock ‚Äôn‚Äô Roll Express. New Jack's partner was Mustafa Saed. Extreme Championship WrestlingThe Gangstas (1995-1997)= New Jack at an ECW event in 1998 In June 1995, The Gangstas joined the Philadelphia-based Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW) promotion, debuting for the promotion as a villainous team by attacking The Public Enemy (Rocco Rock and Johnny Grunge) at Barbed Wire, Hoodies and Chokeslams on June 17, 1995. Gangstas made their ECW in-ring debut at Hardcore Heaven by competing against Public Enemy in a losing effort. The two teams engaged in a lengthy rivalry and traded wins against each other throughout the year, with the feud ending in a street fight at House Party, which Public Enemy won. Public Enemy departed ECW after the event, thus ending the rivalry. At CyberSlam Gangstas were scheduled to compete in a match against The Headhunters but Jack was imprisoned in Atlanta and Mustafa was attacked by Headhunters. Jack returned to ECW on March 8 at Big Ass Extreme Bash rescue Mustafa from an assault by The Headhunters, resulting in Gangstas turning into fan favourites. Gangstas began pursuing the ECW World Tag Team Championship and entered into a rivalry with the tag team champions The Eliminators (John Kronus and Perry Saturn) and received several title shots against Eliminators but came up short. At Fight the Power, Samoan Gangstas Party (L.A. Smooth and Sammy the Silk) made their ECW debut by attacking Gangstas. Samoan Gangsta Party cost Gangstas, another title shot against Eliminators at Hardcore Heaven. Gangstas then faced Samoan Gangstas Party in a match at Heat Wave which ended in a brawl between both teams. Gangstas' feud with Eliminators, Samoan Gangsta Party and The Bruise Brothers led to a four-way dance between the four teams at The Doctor Is In, which Gangstas won to capture their first World Tag Team Championship. Gangstas successfully defended the title against teams such as Samoan Gangsta Party, The Eliminators and Rob Van Dam and Sabu throughout the year. New Jack was involved in the Mass Transit Incident on November 23, 1996 in Revere, Massachusetts. The Gangstas were scheduled to face D-Von Dudley and Axl Rotten. Axl, however, never made it to the show for reasons never made clear. (In the 2005 documentary Forever Hardcore, New Jack said he thinks something happened with Axl's grandmother, which forced Axl to not make it). Rotten was replaced with \\"Mass Transit\\" Eric Kulas, an untrained seventeen-year-old who convinced booker Paul Heyman that he was twenty-one and had been trained by the veteran Killer Kowalski. Kulas requested that New Jack \\"blade\\" him during the match, but the incision was made incorrectly, causing excessive bleeding. Kulas was hospitalized as a result, eventually receiving fifty stitches. New Jack was charged with aggravated assault stemming from the incident, but was acquitted. Kulas subsequently sued New Jack and ECW for damages in July 1998, but lost the case. Kulas died on May 12, 2002 at the age of 22 due to complications from gastric bypass surgery. Later, Kulas' parents tried to sue New Jack because they believed their son's death was caused due to depression and a major eating disorder after what New Jack did to him. Gangstas lost the World Tag Team Championship back to Eliminators on the January 4, 1997 episode of Hardcore TV, ending their reign at 139 days. Gangstas feuded with Eliminators and The Dudley Boyz over the titles for the next several months. At Heat Wave, Gangstas defeated Dudley Boyz in a steel cage match to capture their second World Tag Team Championship. Mustafa Saed left ECW after the title win, leading to the dissolution of Gangstas. The following month, at Hardcore Heaven, Dudley Boyz were returned the titles via forfeit due to Saed's departure. =The Gangstanators (1997-1998)= The departure of Mustafa Saed and Perry Saturn from ECW led New Jack to form a new tag team with former Eliminator John Kronus called The Gangstanators on August 21, 1997 by defeating The Dudley Boyz. The team debuted on television on the September 20 episode of Hardcore TV when Kronus earned a title shot at the ECW World Tag Team Championship by defeating the Dudleys and then Jack showed up as his tag team partner. They received their title shot at As Good as it Gets, where Gangstanators defeated Dudley Boyz to win the World Tag Team Championship, marking Jack's third tag title reign. They lost the titles to The Full Blooded Italians (Little Guido and Tracy Smothers) on the November 1 episode of Hardcore TV. They defeated Hardcore Chair Swingin' Freaks (Axl Rotten and Balls Mahoney) and Dudley Boyz in a three-way dance at Fright Fight and received a rematch for the titles against FBI, the Freaks and Dudleys in a four-way dance at November to Remember but failed to win the titles. Gangstanators resumed their feud with Dudley Boyz as the two teams competed in a match at the 1998 House Party, which Dudleys won. Gangstanators formed an alliance with Spike Dudley, an arch rival of the Dudleys. At the Living Dangerously pay-per-view, New Jack and Spike Dudley defeated Hardcore Chair Swingin' Freaks and Dudley Boyz in a three-way dance. Jack would then face Bam Bam Bigelow in a losing effort at Wrestlepalooza. Jack began emerging as a singles competitor while feuding with Dudley Boyz. This led to Jack and Kronus quietly dissolving Gangstanators and going their separate ways as Jack more frequently teamed with Spike Dudley to feud with Dudley Boyz. New Jack began dragging in a garbage can full of weapons and throwing it into the ring as a sort of ultra-violent trash bag. =Singles competition (1999-2001)= New Jack's feud with Dudley Boyz continued in 1999 as he teamed with Spike Dudley to compete against Dudley Boyz in a losing effort at Guilty as Charged. At Crossing the Line, Jack brought out his former Gangstas tag team partner Mustafa Saed to compete against Dudley Boyz but Mustafa turned on Jack by smashing a guitar on his head and revealed himself to be the mysterious benefactor of Dudleys, who wanted to run out The Public Enemy and New Jack out of ECW. As a result, Jack began a rivalry with Mustafa, which culminated in a match between the two at Living Dangerously, which Jack won. At CyberSlam, Jack teamed with Hardcore Chair Swingin' Freaks (Axl Rotten and Balls Mahoney) against Mustafa and the Dudley Boyz in an Ultimate Jeopardy match in a losing effort. After the match, Jack drove Mustafa through a table with a diving splash from the top of the cage. Jack was out of action for the next few months until he returned to ECW at Heat Wave, where he attacked Dudley Boyz with weapons from a shopping cart. On the October 22 episode of ECW on TNN, Jack received his first opportunity for the World Heavyweight Championship against Mike Awesome but failed to win the title. On the November 5 episode of ECW on TNN, Jack rescued Hardcore Chair Swingin' Freaks from an attack by Da Baldies (The Spanish Angel, Vito LoGrasso, Tony DeVito and Vic Grimes) but Angel stapled Jack in the eyes. This led to a lengthy rivalry between Jack and Angel over the unofficial title of \\"King of the Streets\\". The two battled back and forth over the matter in bloody street fights. One of ECW television's most gruesome moments was when in the course of a match, Angel used New Jack's staple gun (which he often wore around his neck with a chain) against him, stapling him in the eye. Referees called off the match, and New Jack disappeared from the air for many months. New Jack returned by the end of 1999 with his eye seemingly recovered, now sporting a scythe around his neck, claiming that he had \\"upgraded\\" the staple gun. Their first encounter was at November to Remember, where Jack and the Freaks lost to Da Baldies in a handicap match. At the 2000 Guilty as Charged pay-per-view, Jack lost a singles match to Angel due to interference by Da Baldies. At the Living Dangerously live pay-per-view in Danbury, Connecticut on March 12, New Jack suffered serious injuries during a match against Vic Grimes involving a bump that required them to jump and fall 15 feet off a scaffold. Mere seconds before the jump, Grimes became reluctant to take this very risky bump, and New Jack, annoyed with Grimes's reluctance and unprofessionalism (because of the live broadcast they had no time to improvise) dragged Grimes down with him after a count of 3, and Grimes awkwardly fell half a second after Jack instead of falling together in the safest fashion. They fell off the scaffold, missed the tables that were supposed to absorb the force of their fall and landed on the concrete floor, with Grimes landing on New Jack's head. New Jack suffered legitimate brain damage, a broken leg, a skull fracture (resulting in permanent insomnia) and was permanently blinded in his right eye, and spent 6 months recovering, but even while injured Jack defeated Da Baldies leader Angel in a match 2 months later at Hardcore Heaven. He appeared at Heat Wave where he appeared on crutches and Angel stapled him with his staple gun in the forehead until Nova and Chris Chetti made the save and defeated Da Baldies in a tag team match. Jack was out of action for the next few months. He returned to ECW on the September 22 episode of ECW on TNN, where he rescued Spike Dudley from an assault by Justin Credible and Rhino but was double teamed by the two. Jack was named the number one contender for Rhino's World Television Championship at November to Remember, where he failed to win the title. In his last ECW match, Jack defeated longtime rival Angel on the December 17 episode of Hardcore TV. Jack remained with the promotion which was closed due to bankruptcy a month later in January 2001. XPW and the independent circuit (2001‚Äì2012) After ECW declared bankruptcy in April 2001, New Jack began wrestling on the independent circuit. In 2001 and 2002, he wrestled for XPW, and in 2003, he made multiple appearances with Total Nonstop Action Wrestling and also Combat Zone Wrestling, competing in Cage of Death V. . In 2004 New Jack in IWA & appeared at the ECW reunion show, Hardcore Homecoming, on June 10, 2005, as well as competing on the \\"Extreme Reunion\\" tour from September 15‚Äì16. New Jack came across Grimes again in February 2002 in a scaffold match, and Jack was personally affronted by Grimes's civil behavior towards him to regain Jack's trust because Grimes had not contacted Jack when he was recovering from his injuries after their fall in Danbury 18 months before. Towards the end of the match, Jack broke from the script and legitimately shocked Grimes with a taser before throwing Grimes from the scaffold and sending him crashing to the ring 40 feet below; there were over 12 tables stacked on top of each other in the ring to break the fall, but Grimes missed all but two of them and came within less than a foot of missing the ring completely, which almost certainly would have killed him. Grimes broke his fall on the top rope, dislocating his ankle and suffering multiple other injuries in the process. In the 2005 documentary Forever Hardcore, New Jack claimed that his intentions were to throw Grimes so hard that he would fall head-first onto the steel turnbuckle and be killed, as retaliation for Grimes's lack of caring after the botched spot in Danbury 18 months before. Some believe this to have been a 'work' on New Jack's part as closer inspection of the footage appears to show that Grimes threw himself off the scaffolding at an unexpected angle and with more velocity than intended. In April 2003, New Jack was in a hardcore match with longtime wrestler Gypsy Joe. Before the match, Jack met Gypsy Joe and went to the booker of the show and asked exactly what he was supposed to do with Joe. Jack was told \\"Gypsy Joe is as tough as leather\\", and Jack replied that he was not going to lose dollar value from this match and would not have a comedy or gimmick match- but that he would kill Gypsy Joe in this match. For unknown reasons, Joe was continuously no-selling New Jack, and Joe headbutted him in the nose. New Jack then got angry with Joe and decided to get genuine sells by legitimately attacking the 69-year-old man with a chain, a framed picture of his aunt, a baseball bat wrapped in barbed wire, and several other weapons. The crowd, horrified by Jack's savage beating of this man either left the show in disgust or started calling Jack the \\"n\\" word- a term he had been called almost every week during his days in Smoky Mountain Wrestling. In an interview for Vice in 2019, Jack stated \\"the more they called me a n****r, the angrier I got and the more I beat the guy (Gypsy Joe) up.\\" In October 2004, New Jack, wrestling for Thunder Wrestling Federation, was scheduled to fight fellow wrestler William Jason Lane at an event near Jacksonville, Florida. During the match, Lane, to New Jack's surprise began punching him in the face legitimately and landed a few blows. New Jack then pulled out a metal blade from his camouflage wrestling attire, and stabbed Lane multiple times in the head. New Jack stated in the Vice documentary series Dark Side of the Ring that the news stated he stabbed Lane 16 times. This action caused New Jack to receive various felony charges, including for aggravated assault with a deadly weapon, and aggravated assault to commit murder. New Jack claims that the two met prior to the match and agreed to use a \\"piece of metal\\" to inflict injury. Despite this, a police officer who was recording the incident stated that it looked like it went \\"past a routine wrestling match.\\" The promoter of the event, Mr. Maurice Williams, claims the event was never intended to be hardcore. New Jack has claimed that he only stabbed Lane nine times. New Jack announced his retirement on XPW's A Cold Day To Hell in 2008 though he continued working independent shows. In 2012, New Jack competed for Extreme Rising and CZW. Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (2003, 2004, 2010) During 2003 and 2004 New Jack wrestled occasional events for TNA wrestling. on the April 2, 2003 NWA-TNA, New Jack, Perry Saturn and The Sandman defeated Chris Daniels and The Harris Brothers. on the April 9 NWA-TNA, New Jack and Sandman lost a 3-way match to The Harris Brothers. on the April 14 NWA-TNA, New Jack and The Sandman lost to Brian Lee and Slash. On August 8, 2010, New Jack appeared at TNA's ECW reunion show, Hardcore Justice, where he and Mustafa assaulted Team 3D and Joel Gertner after a match. Retirement On April 5, 2013 at Pro Wrestling Syndicate's Super Card 2013 Night 2, New Jack defeated Necro Butcher in his official retirement match. Following the match New Jack and Necro Butcher embraced passionately & performed his theme song & celebrated with Marty Jannetty & Ricky Morton.  Return to professional wrestling (2016-2019) New Jack has been wrestling for Money Mark Productions and most recently wrestled Brad Cash in Lewisberg, Tennessee on April 16, 2016. On June 11, 2016, New Jack was set to face former UFC star Phil Baroni in an unsanctioned match at a Pro Wrestling Syndicate event at Starland Ballroom in Sayreville, New Jersey. In October, New Jack appeared at the Crushed 2 wrestling event in Minneapolis, MN interfering in a match between Eugene and Tommy Lee Curtis. He ran out with the garbage can full of weapons and saved Eugene from a beat down and ended up doing a diving splash through a table to pin Tommy Lee Curtis even though he was only interfering. It was billed as his last appearance in the Midwest. In January, Jack was eliminated in battle royal by White Mike but went on to defeat Mike in a singles match. In March, he teamed with fellow ECW Alumni The Sandman & Justin Credible in a winning effort at an ECW show. In his final matches Jack faced fellow ECW alumni C.W. Anderson & Shane Douglas before taking time off due to surgery. Personal life Young has described his childhood as tumultuous. At the age of five he and his siblings witnessed his father stab his mother multiple times after he found out she had been adulterous. Five months later when his mother tried to leave and take Young with her, his father shot her in the leg. His father passed away from a heart attack when he was five years old. Other media In the video game ECW Anarchy Rulz, New Jack's theme song was rerecorded by Bootsy Collins with unique lyrics, unlike every other character's theme, which consisted of cover versions of their real themes. The real theme (\\"Natural Born Killaz\\") could not be featured; copyright issues from their record labels wouldn't allow it. New Jack was featured in the 1999 wrestling documentary Beyond the Mat. In addition, he appeared in the television series Early Edition on May 6, 2000 as a biker in the episode \\"Mel Schwartz, Bounty Hunter\\". He was also featured in the video game Backyard Wrestling 2: There Goes the Neighborhood. New Jack is also the subject of an episode of the documentary series \\"Dark Side of the Ring.\\" The hour-long episode debuted on Vice on March 31, 2020. New Jack is referenced in the 1996 Weezer single \\"El Scorcho\\". The line \\"watchin' Grunge legdrop New Jack through a press table\\" was derived from a caption for a photograph of New Jack fighting wrestler Johnny Grunge that was published in Pro Wrestling Illustrated. New Jack took part in a shoot interview with The Iron Sheik and The Honky Tonk Man where the subject was the Chris Benoit double-murder and suicide. New Jack commented that nothing could excuse what Benoit had done and all people on WWE and elsewhere who were making excuses for him were hypocrites. He also thought it was ironic how Extreme Championship Wrestling was seen as violent and dangerous wrestling when he was working there and still only one person died under New Jack's time with the company, whereas WWE was \\"averaging three a year.\\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E6YBZbKVo9A New Jack has expressed some hatred toward Paul Heyman, notably because of his penchant for lying to his employees, as well as cheating them out of paychecks.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7G-c_2Ywqw New Jack, along with indy wrestler Jay Lover, made a one-time appearance on The Daily Show, on the May 9, 2013 episode of the show, in a segment entitled \\"Stay Out Of School\\".http://www.newsday.com/entertainment/pop-cult-1.811972/new-jack-done- with-daily-show-barks-at-dog-the-bounty-hunter-1.5586423 Championships and accomplishments *American Championship Pro Wrestling **ACPW Hardcore Championship (1 time) *Extreme Championship Wrestling **ECW World Tag Team Championship (3 times) - with Mustafa Saed (2) and John Kronus (1) *Legends Pro Wrestling **XWF/LPW Hall of Fame Inductee (2/22/08) *North Georgia Wrestling Association **NGWA Heavyweight Championship (1 time) **NGWA Tag Team Championship (2 times) - with Festus and Mustafa Saed *Smoky Mountain Wrestling **SMW Tag Team Championship (1 time) - with Mustafa Saed *United States Wrestling Association **USWA World Tag Team Championship (1 time) - with Home Boy *Pro Wrestling Illustrated **PWI ranked him #386 of the 500 best singles wrestlers of the PWI Years in 2003.

It is currently being exhibited at the Salvador Dal√≠ Museum in St. Petersburg, Florida. In The Hallucinogenic Toreador Dal√≠ transmits his wife's dislike for bullfighting by combining symbolism, optical illusions, and estranging yet familiar motifs. Dali used his paranoiac- critical method to create his own visual language within the painting, and combined versatile images as an instructive example of his artistic ability and vision. Description The entire scene is contained within a bullfighting ring, submerged under a barrage of red and yellow tones, alluding tentatively to the colors of the Spanish flag. In the upper left section we observe a representational portrait of his wife, Gala, to whom he dedicated this piece. Her serious, rigid expression could be interpreted as a pictorial representation of her deep-seated dislike for bullfighting. In the bottom left section there is a pattern of multicolored circles. This rectangular-shaped burst of colors immediately grasps the viewer's attention and steers it down towards the visibly emerging shape of a dying bull's head (probably Islero), dripping blood and saliva from its mouth. This pool of blood transforms itself into a sheltered bay where a human figure on a yellow raft comes into sight. The lower section of the bay takes on the shape of a Dalmatian. The slain bull slowly rises to become the landscapes of Cap de Creus, around Dal√≠'s living place. It was said that concern for an increase in tourism led Dal√≠ to embrace its features in the painting. The mountain is mimicked on the right; however, this time, the mountain bears greater resemblance to the precipitous mountains around the town of Roses, near Dal√≠'s studio. An old anecdote lies behind the painter's desire to represent the sculpted figures of Venus de Milos, seen 28 times in the painting. Dal√≠ decided to incorporate these particular silhouettes in his paintings after a visit to New York, where he purchased a box of pencils with a reproduction of the goddess on the cover. Dal√≠ uses negative spaces to produce an image, alternate and complementary to the Venus de Milo. This complementary image encourages the eye to contemplate the painting in such a way as to introduce the quasi-hypnotic array of forms that inhabit the canvas. Examined from a distance, the body of the second Venus reveals the face and torso of the toreador (bullfighter, likely Manolete). Her breasts as his nose, while her face transform into his eye. Their long skirts make up his white shirt and red scarf of the Toreador. The green layer makes up his necktie. His eye is found within the face of the second Venus. The soft white area unveils a tear slipping from his eye. The gadflies of Saint Narcissus of Gerona march over the arena in seemingly straight and parallel lines, forming the cap, hairnet and cape of the toreador. Situated on the lower right hand corner, the whole spectacle is being watched by an infant boy dressed in a sailor's suit who is said to represent Dal√≠ as a youth. When the painting was exhibited in a New York City gallery in the late 1960s as a work in progress, it was accompanied by an illustration of the design, matting out the areas not relevant to the Toreador so the Toreador was easier to see. It was labeled explicitly, \\"How to see the toreador.\\" References Category:Paintings by Salvador Dal√≠ Category:1970 paintings Category:Cattle in art Category:Paintings in St. Petersburg, Florida Category:Insects in art Category:Bullfighting in art ","title":"The Hallucinogenic Toreador"},{"id":"1875877","text":"Ralph Towner (born March 1, 1940, Chehalis, Washington) is an American multi- instrumentalist, composer, arranger and bandleader. He plays the twelve-string guitar, classical guitar, piano, synthesizer, percussion and trumpet. Biography Ralph Towner with Oregon at Bach Dancing & Dynamite Society, Half Moon Bay CA 4/30/89. Towner was born into a musical family in Chehalis, Washington. His mother was a piano teacher and his father a trumpet player. Towner learned to improvise on the piano at the age of three. He began his career as a conservatory-trained classical pianist, attending the University of Oregon from 1958-1963, where he also studied composition with Homer Keller. He studied classical guitar at the Vienna Academy of Music with Karl Scheit from 1963-64 and 1967-68. He joined world music pioneer Paul Winter's \\"Consort\\" ensemble in the late 1960s. He first played jazz in New York City in the late 1960s as a pianist and was strongly influenced by the renowned jazz pianist Bill Evans. He began improvising on classical and 12-string guitars in the late 1960s/early 1970s and formed alliances with musicians who had worked with Evans, including flautist Jeremy Steig, bassists Eddie G√≥mez, Marc Johnson, Gary Peacock, and drummer Jack DeJohnette. Along with bandmates Paul McCandless, Glen Moore, and Collin Walcott, Towner left the Winter Consort in 1970 to form the group Oregon, which over the course of the 1970s issued a number of highly influential records mixing folk music, Indian classical forms, and avant-garde jazz-influenced free improvisation. At the same time, Towner began a longstanding relationship with the influential ECM record label, which has released virtually all of his non-Oregon recordings since his 1973 debut as a leader Trios / Solos. Towner appeared as a sideman on Weather Report's 1972 album I Sing the Body Electric. His 1975 album Solstice which featured a popular track called Nimbus demonstrates his skill and versatility to the full using a 12-string guitar. Since the early 1990s, Towner has lived in Italy, first in Palermo and then in Rome.  Technique  Towner eschews amplification, using only 6-string nylon-string and 12-string steel-string guitars. As a result, he tends to avoid high-volume musical environments, preferring small groups of mostly acoustic instruments that emphasize dynamics and group interplay. Towner also obtains a percussive effect (e.g., \\"Donkey Jamboree\\" from Slide Show with Gary Burton) from the guitar by weaving a matchbook among the strings at the neck of the instrument. Both with Oregon and as a solo artist, Towner has made significant use of overdubbing, allowing him to play piano (or synthesizer) and guitar on the same track; his most notable use of the technique came on his 1974 album Diary, in which he plays guitar-piano duets with himself on most of the album's 8 tracks. In the 1980s, Towner began using the Sequential Circuits Prophet-5 synthesizer extensively but has since de-emphasized his synthesizer and piano playing in favor of guitar.  Honors  Two lunar craters were named by the Apollo 15 astronauts after two of Towner's compositions, \\"Icarus\\" and \\"Ghost Beads.\\" Discography=As leader * Trios / Solos (ECM, 1973) with Glen Moore * Diary (ECM, 1974) * Matchbook (ECM, 1975) with Gary Burton * Solstice (ECM, 1975) * Sargasso Sea (ECM, 1976) with John Abercrombie * Solstice/Sound and Shadows (ECM, 1977) * Batik (ECM, 1978) * Old Friends, New Friends (ECM, 1979) * Solo Concert (ECM, 1980) * Five Years Later (ECM, 1982) with John Abercrombie * Blue Sun (ECM, 1983) * Slide Show (ECM, 1986) with Gary Burton * City of Eyes (ECM, 1989) * Open Letter (ECM, 1992) * If You Look Far Enough with Arild Andersen, Nana Vasconcelos (ECM, 1993) * Oracle (ECM, 1994) with Gary Peacock * Lost and Found (ECM, 1996) * Ana (ECM, 1997) * A Closer View (ECM, 1998) with Gary Peacock * Verso with Maria Pia De Vito (Provocateur, 2000) * Anthem (ECM, 2001) * Time Line (ECM, 2006) * From A Dream (Material Records, 2008) with Wolfgang Muthspiel and Slava Grigoryan * Chiaroscuro (ECM, 2009) with Paolo Fresu * Travel Guide with Wolfgang Muthspiel, Slava Grigoryan (ECM, 2013) * My Foolish Heart (ECM, 2017) With Atmosphere * Atmospheres Featuring Clive Stevens & Friends (Capitol, 1974) * Voyage to Uranus (Capitol, 1974) With Oregon * Music of Another Present Era (Vanguard, 1972) * Distant Hills (Vanguard, 1973) * Winter Light (Vanguard, 1974) * In Concert (Vanguard, 1975) * Together (Vanguard, 1976) * Friends (Vanguard, 1977) * Out of the Woods (Elektra, 1978) * Violin (Vanguard, 1978) * Roots in the Sky (Elektra, 1979) * Moon and Mind (Vanguard, 1979) * In Performance (BGO, 1980) * Our First Record (Vanguard, 1980) * Oregon (ECM, 1983) * Crossing (ECM, 1985) * Ecotopia (ECM, 1987) * 45th Parallel (Portrait, 1989) * Always, Never, and Forever (veraBra, 1991) * Troika (veraBra, 1994) * Beyond Words (Chesky, 1995) * Northwest Passage (ECM, 1997) * Music for a Midsummer Night's Dream (Oregon Music 1998) * Oregon in Moscow (ECM, 2000) * Live at Yoshi's (ECM, 2002) * Prime (C.A.M.

The Bureau's motto is \\"Protecting America from Everything\\". Stalking the Night Fantastic is a Bureau 13 horror game released by Tri Tac Games in 1983. In 1991, the Bureau 13 series won the Gamers Choice Award at Gencon for best Fantasy Game. In 2008 a new d20 Modern edition was released. The series has a definite tongue in cheek attitude that is emphasized by both the background stories and the illustrations. Background Bureau 13 (the 13th Bureau of the U.S. Department of Justice) was founded in 1862 by Abraham Lincoln to deal with supernatural and paranormal threats to the Union (and to suppress public knowledge of them). Its first agents were a motley crew of military personnel, Pinkerton detectives, civilian consultants, freed slaves, paroled criminals, and even Confederate prisoners of war. After the Civil War, the Bureau had access to a large budget and limitless resources. Safe houses and caches of equipment were stockpiled across the country. The headquarters in Washington, D.C., later became the East Coast office. A West Coast office was created in Silver City, New Mexico Territory, to speed up response times to threats on the frontier. After the Indian Wars and the settling of the West, Bureau 13 began to face threats outside the jurisdiction of the United States, and so the Bureau's agents served during World War I, World War II, and the Cold War. On 7 July 1977, an attack destroyed the Bureau 13 headquarters and killed hundreds of agents. This was later dubbed the \\"'77 Massacre\\". This shattered the organization. Scattered groups of survivors took years to re-form. The remaining agents decided to go underground as a cell-based network. Gradually they began to create networks of \\"friendlies\\" ‚Äì assets and sympathizers that would help the Bureau when called upon. As the number of original agents retired or died, the \\"friendlies\\" started to be promoted to agent status. Most agents encountered are usually civilians who received their training on the job. The job of Bureau 13 is as it has always been. Investigate the strange or unusual, analyze the evidence to see if there is a supernatural or paranormal cause, and assess whether the cause is hostile or dangerous. Role-play style Bureau 13 tends to have a weird, humorous or satirical bent to it. Another factor is that the characters are usually mundane civilians rather than commandos or Men In Black. They don't usually have a lot of military or espionage skills. Current games  ;Bureau 13 *Bureau 13: Stalking the Night Fantastic (1st Ed.)

He is best known for his appearances with the World Wrestling Federation from 1999 to 2001 under the ring name Rodney. Early life Lienhardt was a childhood friend of Shane McMahon, the son of World Wrestling Federation owner Vince McMahon. Lienhardt and Shane attended junior high together in Greenwich, Connecticut, befriending Pete Gasparino in high school, where the trio played American football. After graduating from high school, Lienhardt and Gasparino would exercise at the WWF gym in Stamford, Connecticut. Professional wrestling career=World Wrestling Federation (1999-2001) In 1999, Shane McMahon invited Lienhardt and Gasparino to appear on WWF television as part of an angle. Lienhardt (known simply as \\"Rodney\\") and Gasparino (renamed \\"Pete Gas\\") debuted on WWF television on the March 22, 1999 episode of Raw is War as part of a stable known as the \\"Mean Street Posse\\", and began assisting Shane in his feud with Test and helping him retain the European Championship. Joey Abs was added to the faction three months later. Shane eventually turned face and briefly feuded with his former allies before leaving WWF television. The Posse took part in a tag team battle royal for the number one contendership to the WWF World Tag Team Championship at Armageddon 1999, and gained an advantage by switching places with the third wrestler behind the referees' backs, thus enabling them to outnumber the other teams three to two. Despite this advantage, they failed to win and were the first team eliminated. In early 2000, the Posse repeatedly tried to defeat Crash Holly for the WWF Hardcore Championship, attacking the champion in unlikely venues such as an airport, a circus and his hotel room. At WrestleMania 2000 on April 2, the trio took part in a Hardcore battle royal for the Hardcore Championship. Lienhardt pinned Funaki to win the title after stunning him by throwing him into a metal fence railing, but was pinned by Abs just fourteen seconds later. Despite the infighting, the Posse remained a relatively cohesive unit. On an episode of Sunday Night Heat later that year, Edge and Christian briefly became the managers of the Mean Street Posse. They accompanied them to ringside for the duration of their WWF World Tag Team Championships title match with the Hardy Boyz, assisting the Posse with the proviso that they would receive a title shot if the posse was to win. The Hardy Boyz, however, thwarted the interference of Edge and Christian and retained their titles. Later that year, all three members of the Posse were sent to Memphis Championship Wrestling, then a WWF developmental territory. On May 24, 2000 in Tunica, Mississippi, Lienhardt and Abs defeated Bull Pain and Todd Morton to win the MCW Southern Tag Team Championship.http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/profiles/r/rodney.html Online world of Wrestling They lost the titles to The Kingpins on July 26 in Memphis, Tennessee, but regained the titles on August 12, 2000 in Jackson, Mississippi. Their second reign ended when they were defeated by The Dupps on October 28 in Jonesboro, Arkansas. Lienhardt was then sent to the MCW affiliate Memphis Power Pro Wrestling, where he was renamed RodRageous. He defeated Bulldog Raines to win the MPPW Television Championship on January 27, 2001 in Memphis. He lost the title to Grandmaster Sexay on February 21 of that year in Jonesboro, but regained the title just three days later in Memphis. His second reign came to an end on March 17, 2001, when MPPW severed all connection with the WWF and vacated all titles held by WWF employees. Lienhardt and the remainder of the Posse were released by the WWF later that June. Personal life Lienhardt is married with two daughters.

Freeride is a discipline of mountain biking closely related to downhill biking and dirt jumping focused on tricks, style, and technical trail features. It is now recognized as one of the most popular disciplines within mountain biking. The term freeriding was originally coined by snowboarders, meaning riding without a set course, goals or rules on natural terrain. In mountain biking, it is riding trail with the most creative line possible that includes style, amplitude, control, and speed. Many in the cycling industry suggest that the Laguna Rads were the first to freeride, that is riding terrain that didn't already have an existing path or network of trails. History The original freeride bikes were modified downhill bikes which utilized gearing that enabled the rider to go up hills as well as down them. Modern freeride bikes are similar to downhill bikes, but feature slightly less suspension travel and are lighter ‚Äì which enables them to be ridden not just downhill but through more technical sections, such as North Shore obstacles. Most freeride bikes feature slightly steeper headangles and shorter wheelbases than pure downhill bikes. Although a minimal difference, it is done to help with maneuverability and spin tricks. Ski areas have started to embrace the sport of freeriding, adding bike racks to chairlifts to create \\"lift accessed mountain biking\\". This helps ski areas operate year-round and gives the bikers the ability to ride more runs in less time. Notable riders A few specialist riders have embraced the sport including: *Ryan Nyquist *Darren Berrecloth *Brandon Semenuk *Brett Rheeder *Kelly McGarry *Gee Atherton *Cameron Zink *Robbie Bourdon *Sam Reynolds *Jeff Lenosky *Kurt Sorge *Martin S√∂derstr√∂m *Andreu Lacondeguy *Graham Aggasiz *Hans Rey *Nicholi Rogatkin *Wade Simmons *Anthony Messere *Andrew Shandro *C√©dric Gracia *Matt Hunter Differences between downhilling and freeriding Freeride Mountain Bikers. hardtail freeride bike. Due to similarities with the bicycles used and often the riding locations, the divisions between downhill riding and freeriding are often overlooked. For example, freeride bikes have steeper head tube angles and shorter wheelbases for low-speed stability on technical stunts, while downhill bikes have slacker headtube angles and longer wheelbases for absolute high-speed stability at the cost of low-speed maneuverability. Downhill riding is primarily concerned with descending a slope on a given course as quickly as possible. There are often many obstacles in downhill riding, including jumps, drops, and rocky sections. Freeride is, by definition, a much broader realm of riding. For example, a freerider may often ride a very narrow wooden plank raised as many as twenty five feet above the ground, drop off of cliffs, raised platforms, or other man-made or natural objects onto a landing, or \\"transition\\" up to forty feet below. This may involve jumping over a structure below, such as a road or highway. Many aspects of freeriding are similar to downhill riding, with wide open speed and technical and very steep sections, or dirt jumping, with a series of man-made jumps and landings. Another key difference is the emphasis on performing tricks or stylish riding stances while airborne. A freeride course can be compared to a skatepark, where the purpose of the trail is to provide ample opportunities for the rider to become airborne, throw tricks, and create new and imaginative lines on and over the terrain. Main features of Freeride bikes=Frame The frame is made usually of aluminium alloys and/or steel, and usually smaller build compared to a downhill bike. It is also equipped with rear suspension systems, and many manufacturers still rely on simpler systems (i.e. single-pivot) in order to preserve strength and uninterrupted suspension travel. Freeride frames can also be lighter (where weight is an important consideration) than downhill frames, with these bikes being designated freeride lite and may come equipped with the new, oversized \\"onepointfive\\" (inch) head tube standard, in order to cater for increasing demand for stronger, long-travel(150‚Äì200 mm), single crown forks. There also exists a burlier breed of freeride bicycles. These bikes were originally designed for weight-no-object strength and reliability rather than lighter weight. However, in recent years, due to the emergence of new forging techniques for aluminum and the introduction of carbon fiber as a viable construction material, these frames have become considerably lighter than earlier generations, sometimes comparable to the weight of normal bicycles. Fork Single crown forks are now more popular. Companies such as Fox, Answer Products (Manitou), Marzocchi and RockShox, introduced them with very similar strength to their dual crown counterparts, with the immense advantage of being single crown. This enables a significantly narrower steering diameter, and, more recently, airborne tricks such as 'barspin' or 'tailwhip', at the expense of torsional rigidity. This enables the bike to be used in a variety of ways. Gearing Freeride mountain bikes are often geared differently to downhill or other mountain bikes. There are three main types of freeride mountain bike gearings, these are single speed, short range and long range. Single speed mountain bikes use a single chainring at the front, mounted to the cranks, and a single cog at the rear, normally mounted to a freewheel or a freehub. A short range freeride bike uses a single chainring at the front, with a cassette hub, containing multiple (usually 7 or 10) cogs, ranging in size from 10 teeth to 24 teeth. A long range freeride bike normally has a single chainring at the front (however older bikes may have 2 or 3) with multiple (10, 11 or 12) cogs at the rear mounted on a cassette hub, ranging in size from 10-52 teeth. The larger number of gears and larger rear rings provide a \\"low low gear\\" for climbing up steep surfaces. Notable competitions There are many competitions in the discipline of freeride mountain biking that take place around the globe, similar to downhill mountain biking. The most popular competitions include Red Bull Rampage, Red Bull Crankworx and Red Bull Joyride, all of which take place once a year. X-Games had slopestyle mountain bike event introduced and debut in X-Games Munich 2013. The sport has not been able to follow up with X-Games since despite its popularity and growth over the years. This is partially due to the poorly executed event which had a poorly designed course. Along with bad wind conditions and constant rain throughout the weekend. Due to the conditions and sketchy course many riders chose not to ride and in the finals only consisted of 6 riders.

Red Bull Joyride, known as the Super Bowl of the sport takes place in Whistler Canada. Red Bull District Ride is a street style contest that goes throughout the streets of a city and later into the final massive jump. The North Shore Dirt Jumping at a professional Freeride contest in Seattle, Washington. The sport has spread across the planet, but the widely recognized starting point for the addition of man-made obstacles for downhill trails is Vancouver, British Columbia's \\"North Shore\\". This refers to three mountains across the Burrard Inlet from downtown Vancouver, Mount Seymour, Mt. Fromme, and Cypress Mountain. The mountains weren't the first places to have downhill trails with natural obstacles, but they were one of the first places to have man-made obstacles such as skinny bridges and teeter totters. The trail builders often integrate many natural features, using fallen logs to ride on and rocks faces to jump or ride down. Trails on the North Shore are mostly described as \\"technical\\". This means that the trails corners are tight and the tread strewn with natural obstacles such as rocks and roots. Advocacy The \\"shore\\" has seen some controversy. Most of the trails are built on private property or parkland. BC Parks has responded to growing popularity of freeriding with increased enforcement against illegal trail building and usage. A major voice in the conflict in North Vancouver District was Councillor Ernie Crist, who had been lobbying for the closing of all the trails on Mt. Fromme. Housing developments at the base of the mountains complain of bikers going across their lawns, etc. The expansion of the residential areas called for the destruction of some trails on Cypress Mountain. There were also cases of sabotage (such as the removal of bridge supports). Most recently, Howell at the Moon Productions partnered with IMBA to create \\"Pedal-Driven: a bikeumentary\\", a documentary film highlighting the conflicts and confrontations between freeriders and public land managers over the right to build trails and ride on public lands. North Shore Mountain Biking Association To help promote biking and keep the trails open there is an advocacy group, the North Shore Mountain Biking Association (NSMBA). They negotiate with landowners, organize volunteers to maintain the trails and hold races. The NSMBA 101 document explains the organizations involvement. Freeriding in film Freeride mountain-biking movies are films about freeride mountain-biking and downhill mountain biking. Scenes from freeride competitions are normally included. Given the high spectacularity of the freeride and downhill action, an increasing number of films are released every year, covering the annual major competitions and promoting particular trails and champions. The Film \\"Where the Trail Ends\\" and the YouTube series \\"Life Behind Bars\\" are very good examples of freeriding.

In the mid-1950s, he began an abusive relationship with actress Lana Turner. In 1958, he was stabbed to death by Turner's daughter, Cheryl Crane, who said she did it to defend her mother from a vicious beating by Stompanato. His death was ruled as justifiable homicide because he had been killed in self-defense. Early life John Stompanato () during the Pacific War in WWII, with his comrades gathering behind the grave of Pfc. Joseph J. Petillo of Asbury Park, NJ. KIA Okinawa John Stompanato Jr., was born into an Italian American family in Woodstock, Illinois. His father, John Sr., owned a barber shop and his mother, Carmela, was a seamstress. Both parents were born in Italy but were married in Brooklyn. They had moved to Woodstock in 1916. Stompanato was the youngest of four children: he had two older sisters, Grace and Teresa; and an older brother, Carmine. Six days after his birth, his mother died of peritonitis. Johnny's father soon married a woman named Verena Freitag. In 1940, after Stompanato's freshman year at Woodstock High School, his father sent him to Kemper Military School for boys in Boonville, Missouri. In 1942, he graduated at the age of 17. In 1943, Stompanato joined the U.S. Marines serving with the 1st Service Battalion, 1st Marine Division. He served in the South Pacific theater, in Peleliu and Okinawa, and then served in China. Stompanato left the Corps in March 1946, being discharged in China. Stompanato met his first wife, Sara Utush, a Turkish woman, while stationed in Tianjin, China. They wed in May 1946. Utush was a dress designer who had formerly lived in Beijing. Stompanato converted to Islam in order to marry her. They returned to Woodstock where they had their first son, John Stompanato III, who was born in September 1947. Stompanato left his wife and child and moved to Hollywood, California, in 1947. His wife was granted a divorce in Illinois on the grounds of desertion in January 1949. The next month, Stompanto, described in a news article as a \\"ceramics manufacturer,\\" married actress Helen Gilbert. Three months later, Gilbert announced she would seek to end the marriage, calling it a \\"mistake.\\" They divorced in July 1949. Organized crime After moving to Los Angeles, Stompanato owned and managed \\"The Myrtlewood Gift Shop\\" in Westwood. The business sold inexpensive pieces of crude pottery and wood carvings as fine art. Through connections to the LA underworld, he became a bodyguard for gangster Mickey Cohen and as well as an enforcer for his crime family. Stompanato also established himself within Hollywood society. In 1948, Frank Sinatra asked Cohen to tell Stompanato to keep away from Ava Gardner. But the mob boss instead told Sinatra to go back to his wife and children, because he never got between men and their \\"broads.\\" In August 1949, Stompanato was described in the press as the \\"new right hand man\\" and bodyguard of rackets boss Mickey Cohen, replacing Neddie Herbert, who was slain in an ambush the previous month. At the time, Stompanato was arrested on a charge of vagrancy. He was driving a Cadillac at the time of his arrest, which was ordered as part of a campaign by Los Angeles County sheriff Eugene W. Biscailuz to \\"de-hoodlumize\\" the Sunset Strip. He was carrying checks totaling $33,657.50. In 1950, Stompanato, described as a \\"recent and inexperienced recruit from Illinois,\\" was listed as one of the principal members of the Cohen gang by the California Commission on Organized Crime. Throughout the 1950s, he was arrested seven times by the LAPD for various criminal charges ranging from vagrancy to suspicion of robbery. In October 1952, Stompanato left Cohen and started dating Helene Stanley, a former 20th Century Fox contract player. By December, he was working as her manager. The following year, she became his third wife; however, they divorced two years later. Relationship with Lana Turner By 1957, Stompanato was in a relationship with actress Lana Turner (who had split up from her fifth husband Lex Barker). She had also just lost her MGM contract after a series of box office flops. In recognition of their relationship, he wore a heavy gold-link bracelet on his wrist with \\"Lanita\\" inscribed inside. Turner's daughter Cheryl Crane described him as: > B-picture good looks... thick set ... powerfully built and soft spoken ... > and talked in short sentences to cover a poor grasp of grammar and spoke in > a deep baritone voice. With friends, he seldom smiled or laughed out loud, > but seemed always coiled, holding himself in ... had watchful hooded eyes > that took in more than he wanted anyone to notice .... His wardrobe on a > daily basis consisted of roomy, draped slacks, a silver buckled skinny > leather belt and lizard shoes. Their relationship was stormy; it was punctuated with frequent arguments and fights. In 1957, Stompanato became so jealous about Turner's relationship with future James Bond actor Sean Connery, he flew to the United Kingdom. He stormed onto the set of Another Time, Another Place threatening Connery with a gun. Unperturbed, the 6 ft 2 in Scotsman, who was a former body builder and karate black belt, bent Stompanato's hand back, forcing him to drop the weapon. He was reported to the police and quietly deported from the United Kingdom. After Stompanato's death, it was rumored that at least one LA mobster held Connery responsible, leading the actor to go into hiding for a short time afterwards. Fatal stabbing Lana Turner's former home in Beverly Hills where Stompanato was killed in 1958. On April 4, 1958, Stompanato was stabbed to death by Turner's teenage daughter Cheryl Crane at her mother's home in Beverly Hills, California. She claimed that Stompanato had been violently attacking her mother, so she stabbed him. A coroner's inquest returned a decision of justifiable homicide.Doug Smith, \\"In a 1958 Inquest, Killing of Lana Turner's Boyfriend Was Detailed\\", Los Angeles Times, August 10, 2015. After the ruling, Stompanato's family sued Turner for $750,000 (they later settled for $20,000). Stompanato is interred at Oakland Cemetery, in Woodstock, McHenry County, Illinois beside his mother Carmela (1890‚Äì1925), his father John (1890‚Äì1952), and his stepmother Verena (1901‚Äì1967). His brother Carmine (1912‚Äì1961) is buried nearby.

He was selected as Leader of the Opposition. In an opinion piece written on the day the UK left the EU, Leech said Brexit was \\"not in our [Lib Dems] name, and we will fight back.\\" He called for members and activists to \\"fight for a progressive and optimistic future because it‚Äôs the right thing to do. And look forward to sharing that future once again with our European neighbours and friends with hope, courage and confidence in our hearts.\\"  COVID-19 Pandemic  On 15 October 2020, Leech endorsed a Tier 3 lockdown for Greater Manchester and accused the region's leaders of being \\"completely irresponsible\\". http://www.mcrlibdems.org.uk/liberal_democrats_endorse_tier_3_lockdown_for_greater_manchester The position was in direct contradiction with the Labour leaders in Greater Manchester including Mayor Andy Burnham and Council Leader Sir Richard Leese.https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-manchester-54553907 Campaigns In 2005 Leech campaigned for the Metrolink tram system to come through his constituency. In 2012 it began running through south Manchester, terminating at East Didsbury. Leech campaigned to reduce the stake on fixed odds betting terminals (FOBTs) from ¬£100 to ¬£2. The issue received cross-party support and was supported by campaign groups including Stop The FOBT's. A bill he introduced to have the Statuary Instrument (SI) reduced to ¬£50 FOBT threshold in February 2015 was defeated. For many years Leech campaigned against homophobia and for same-sex marriage. In 2013, he ran a campaign calling for homophobic chants at football matches to be outlawed.

His campaign then turned to acquiring pardons for the 75,000 other men convicted of the same crime. Leech said it was \\"utterly disgusting and ultimately just embarrassing\\" that the conviction was upheld as long as it was, and celebrated the posthumous pardon. Leech's campaign gained public support from popular physicists such as Stephen Hawking. In November 2018 after The Bank of England invited members of the public to vote on which figure should appear on the new ¬£50 note, Leech said it should be Alan Turing so as to \\"serve as a stark and frankly painful reminder of what we lost in Turing\\" A number of Leech's campaign posters, letters and campaign material went on display at the Manchester Museum of Science and Indsutry after the Bank of England announced Turing as the new face of the ¬£50 note. https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/greater-manchester- news/manchester-computer-pioneer-alan-turing-16585966 Leech led a campaign for safe standing at football matches. Standing has been banned in English football's top two divisions following the Taylor Report into the 1989 Hillsborough disaster. Leech told the Commons that clubs should be allowed to install 'rail-seating' allowing supporters to stand with the option of sitting down following the lead of countries including Germany, Austria and Sweden that operate safe standing. Leech campaigned to remain during the 2016 EU referendum. On 5 October 2016, Leech said that Manchester had not accepted any refugees under the Government's 2015 resettlement scheme due to disagreements with funding. He accused the council of being \\"sickeningly shallow\\" and demanded it commit to housing 50 Syrian refugee families and as many unaccompanied Syrian refugee children as possible. The council was vague in its response but said 'Manchester would play its part.' Leech has criticised the city council's attitude towards homelessness. In January 2017, Leech revealed statistics about the number of sexual attacks linked to the dating apps Tinder and Grindr. In March he called on the council to implement 'Ask for Angela', a scheme to help people get out of uncomfortable situations in bars and pubs to which the council agreed. In September 2017, Leech launched a Manchester-based campaign to tackle what he described as an \\"appalling\\" rise in homophobic and transphobic bullying in local schools. In September 2017, Leech released a report on homophobic and transphobic bullying in Manchester's schools. It revealed that incidents had doubled in the last two years. Speaking at the Liberal Democrats conference, he said 'We have absolutely no right to claim we live in a decent society when this kind of behaviour is still rife in our schools.' Seventeen schools refused to take part in his report which he criticised as a 'worrying lack of transparency'. Leech pledged to work with schools, LGBT+ groups and called on both Manchester Council and the UK Government to work harder to 'stamp out the deplorable behaviour'. Also in September 2017, Leech delivered a speech at the Liberal Democrats Conference in which he called on the Government to take a more proactive role in youth crime. He criticised Government cuts but also spoke of the need for police to become role models in their communities and \\"completely immerse themselves in their communities to really get to know local people and earn their trust.\\" Leech worked with youth charity Kids Count to work to a solution. In October 2018, Leech criticised the shortlisting of two companies for a ¬£330m contract to renovate Manchester Town Hall. He said that \\"Under absolutely no circumstances\\" should Lendlease ever be considered for a council contract again until they paid a ¬£3m Grenfell-style cladding bill in the Green Quarter of Manchester. In January 2019, Lendlease was announced as the winner of the contract. Leech criticised the decision and said it showed a lack of concern for local people. In an opinion piece for Manchester Confidential, Leech stated he was seeking to implement special paid leave for Manchester Council employees seeking gender reassignment treatment, comparing it to any other health-related appointment. In August 2020, Leech wrote to the Big Five tech giants ‚Äì Amazon, Apple, Google, Facebook and Microsoft ‚Äì urging them to donate ¬£400,000 each to secure the future of the Bletchley Park trust where Turing did much of his work after the organisation announced it was to lose more then ¬£2m and cut a third of its workforce. Leech said the trust was important for protecting Turing's legacy and that the country \\"mustn‚Äôt be allowed to forget the dark stain in our history\\" ‚Äì referring to Turing's treatment and conviction for homosexuality. https://inews.co.uk/news/uk/mp- pardon-alan-turing-bletchley- park-611512?ITO=newsnow&utm;_source=%3Fito%3Dsocial%7Ctwitter%7Ctw_theipaper In September 2020, Leech blamed a \\"toxic social atmosphere\\" created by PM Boris Johnson for a rise in attacks against the LGBTQ+ community. https://www.pressreader.com/uk/sunday-mirror/20200913/281904480592252 Awards In 2005, Politics.co.uk gave him the magazine's monthly ‚ÄòTop MP‚Äô honour for his campaign to outlaw homophobic chanting at football matches. in 2008, He won Brake's Road Safety MP of the Year for his work to reduce speed limits in his constituency. in 2010, UK Lung Cancer Coalition awarded him their 'Parliamentary Champion' award for his work to improve cancer services in Greater Manchester. in 2011, Former Spice Girl Geri Halliwell presented him the Breast Cancer Campaigner award. In 2013, Leech won the first-ever Patchwork MP of the Year award for his work with LGBT and BAME groups. In 2020, he was shortlisted for a 'Lifetime Achievement' in public service for his dedication to the LGBTQ+ community from over 200 nominations. https://www.libdemvoice.org/john-leech-shortlisted-for-lifetime-achievement- award-66095.html International relations John Leech has campaigned to improve and progress liberal parties across Europe. In the 2019 EU elections, he worked with the Liberal Democrats' sister party D66 to deliver a campaign aimed at young people. He highlighted the importance of voting for pro- European parties in the elections citing Brexit as his reasoning. At an event held in central Utrecht, Leech told the audience that Brexit was \\"destroying the soul\\" of the UK whilst in a video for D66 he told Dutch voters that \\"if anyone knew the impact of not voting for pro-Europe parties, it was us [British people].\\" In a press conference in Utrecht, he said the saddest thing about Brexit was losing the close and long relationship the Netherlands and the UK have had for generations. Personal life Leech is an amateur dramatics enthusiast with Manchester Road Players. He is a supporter of Manchester City F.C. and was a member of the Parliamentary Football team. Harassment In November 2016 police investigated a number of \\"very serious\\" threats directed at Leech on Twitter. One tweet received on 6 October 2016, was in response to Leech being invited to a walking basketball event at the Amaechi Basketball Centre in Whalley Range. Leech responded: \\"Thinking about coming down one time this month. How is 23rd or 30th for you guys?\\" An anonymous user then entered the conversation to say: \\"Excellent I'll bring the knuckle dusters.\\" Police advised Leech not to post his schedule publicly and to temporarily pause his advice surgeries whilst the force worked with Twitter to find the user. Lib Dems did not press charges. During the 2017 General Election police investigated a number of theft and intimidation reports. The activists boasted about stealing garden posters on Twitter, publicly planned where to target next and posed in pictures with the posters in balaclavas. The events happened just days after a terrorist targeted the Manchester Arena. Controversy In July 2013 correspondence between Leech and a constituent attracted mixed reactions. In the letter, the constituent accused Leech of trying to ‚Äúbrainwash children‚Äù into supporting homosexuality after Leech led a report on eradicating homophobia from football. Responding to the constituent, Leech wrote that the majority of people \\"are sick and tired of a small minority of homophobic people like you\\". The constituent claimed he would not vote for Leech based on his \\"obsession with that Turing bloke\\", referring to Leech's campaign to pardon Alan Turing. Responding, Leech said he \\"did not seek the vote of homophobes\\", signing off with \\"You are, of course, entitled to hold your offensive views, but please do not bother to waste my time, and yours, by expressing them to me.\\" The exchange attracted praise from the LGBT community. On 12 February 2019 Leech sparked controversy when he tweeted that a potential council policy, which was still out for public consultation, was \\"absolute crap\\". Manchester Council announced it was consulting the public on a new Public Spare Protection Order (PSPO) which, among other things, targeted 'aggressive' begging and rough sleepers who pitch tents or sleep in doorways. When asked to clarify his comments by local media, Leech refused to apologise and instead went on to describe the policy as a \\"Homeless Tax\\", \\"social cleansing\\" and promised his party would \\"oppose it until the end of time.\\" On 8 March 2019, at a routine council budget meeting, a row broke out. The argument was prompted by a sign put up by Labour above the Lord Mayor's chair at the front of the council chamber, reading '10 Years of Tory And Lib Dem Cuts'. When Leech entered the chamber, he took down the message‚Äîprompting senior Labour Councillor Pat Karney to 'thunder' across the chamber. He began 'screaming' and 'shouting' at Leech and told him to hand over the laminated A4 pieces of paper at least 11 times, according to Manchester Evening News journalist Jen Williams, who filmed and reported the events.

He is signed to Impact Wrestling, where he is one half of the current Impact World Tag Team Champions as one half of The Motor City Machine Guns with Chris Sabin in their second reign, and is known for his time in Ring of Honor. He first gained fame on the independent circuit, working for Ring of Honor (ROH), as well as in Japan, for Pro Wrestling Zero1-Max. He has also worked for New Japan Pro-Wrestling (NJPW), where he is a former three-time IWGP Junior Heavyweight Tag Team Champion. Aside from wrestling, he is the lead singer of a rock band called The High Crusade, which includes his friends and fellow wrestlers Chris Sabin and Petey Williams. Professional wrestling career=Training and early career (2002‚Äì2005) Martin initially started training in the early 2002 under Breyer Wellington and Truth Martini. He then joined the Border City Wrestling's Can-Am Wrestling School, and began training under Joe E. Legend and Scott D'Amore. Martin debuted in March 2002 as Alex Shelley, a name he created by combining the forename of Alex, the protagonist of the 1962 novel A Clockwork Orange, with the surname of Pete Shelley, the lead singer of the 1970s punk rock band the Buzzcocks. Six months into his career, he was hospitalized with a shattered jaw when he slipped on a wet ring and hit the unpadded ring apron. Shelley had steel plates inserted into his jaw as a result. After eight months, Shelley joined Ian Rotten's IWA Mid-South promotion. He worked in the IWA for six months before joining the Philadelphia-based Combat Zone Wrestling. Not long after that, he joined Ring of Honor (ROH). On June 12, 2005, Shelley made an appearance on the international version of WWE Heat, losing to Simon Dean after being hit with the Simonizer. His appearance was a tryout, but nothing came of it. Ring of HonorGeneration Next (2003‚Äì2004)= Shelley debuted in Ring of Honor on June 28, 2003, at WrestleRave 2003, facing B.J. Whitmer, Tony Mamaluke and Jimmy Jacobs in a Four Corners Survival match, which was won by Whitmer. He appeared with ROH sporadically throughout the remainder of 2003 and early 2004, feuding with Jimmy Jacobs and Matt Stryker. At Generation Next on May 22, 2004, Shelley formed a stable, \\"Generation Next\\", with Austin Aries, Jack Evans and Roderick Strong. Generation Next, led by Shelley, spent the entirety of the event attacking other wrestlers, claiming that they were \\"the best that Ring of Honor has to offer\\". They began feuding with wrestlers with a respect for tradition such as Matt Stryker, Jimmy Rave and John Walters. On July 17, 2004, at Reborn: Completion, Shelley lost to Doug Williams in the finals of a tournament for the vacant ROH Pure Championship. That same night, Generation Next attacked Ricky Steamboat during his confrontation with CM Punk, with Punk subsequently siding with Steamboat to fend off Generation Next. This led to a feud between Generation Next and the allies of Ricky Steamboat, culminating in a forty‚Äìfive-minute-long eight‚Äìman elimination match at The Midnight Express Reunion on October 2, pitting Generation Next against CM Punk, John Walters, Jimmy Jacobs and Ace Steel. The match was won by Generation Next, with Shelley and Aries surviving. Following the match, Shelley announced his intention of challenging Samoa Joe for the ROH World Championship. Aries then announced he too was going after the title, with Shelley telling him to \\"remember where your loyalties lie\\". On December 26, 2004, at Final Battle 2004, Shelley and Strong were defeated by CM Punk and Steve Corino. Following the match, Aries, feeling that Shelley was spending far too much time in Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA) than he was leading Generation Next, came to the ring and demanded that Shelley step‚Äìdown as the leader. Before Shelley could give an answer, he was attacked by Aries and Strong and kicked out of Generation Next, turning him into a fan favorite in the process. =The Embassy (2005‚Äì2006)= PWG show in 2006 Shelley feuded with Generation Next throughout early 2005, unsuccessfully challenging Aries for the ROH World Championship at Manhattan Mayhem on May 7. On July 23, Shelley was in a tag match against Aries and Strong, with him choosing a mystery partner. Shelley gave speculation in a backstage promo as to who his partner would be, saying it could be a new wrestler making their debut in Ring of Honor. He later revealed that he did not bring someone in to ROH, but had joined \\"The Embassy\\", a heel stable controlled by Prince Nana. Teaming with Fast Eddie Vegas that night, The Embassy won their first match in a feud with Generation Next that would last for the remainder of the year. The feud culminated in an eight‚Äìman elimination steel cage match on December 3, with Austin Aries, Roderick Strong, Jack Evans and Matt Sydal of Generation Next defeating Shelley, Jimmy Rave, Abyss and Nana of The Embassy. At Hell Freezes Over on January 14, 2006, Shelley teamed up with Rave to defeat the duo of Claudio Castagnoli and Azrieal. Later that evening, Prince Nana offered to buy the ROH World Championship from Bryan Danielson after his successful defense against Chris Hero. When Danielson refused to sell it, he was attacked by The Embassy with Shelley giving him a Sliced Bread #2 claiming it was his \\"Kryptonite\\" as Danielson's long‚Äìtime rival and former Embassy member, Spanky, utilized the move to defeat him on numerous occasions. The following show, The Embassy of Shelley, Rave and Abyss won the 2006 Trios Tournament defeating Generation Next of Jack Evans and Matt Sydal and their partner Jimmy Yang in the finals, and thus each wrestler was granted any match they wanted, with Shelley and Rave both announcing they wanted a shot at the ROH World Championship. Shelley was originally scheduled to face Danielson for the title on February 11, but a severe snowstorm hit the Northeast and Shelley was told by Total Nonstop Action Wrestling to fly back early to Orlando, Florida so he would not miss their pay-per-view the following day. Shelley would eventually get his title shot one month later at Arena Warfare, but was unable to defeat Danielson. Shelley would then wrestle sporadically in ROH for the next few months before quietly leaving in June. His last appearance as a regular in Ring of Honor took place on June 24 when he managed Jimmy Rave and Conrad Kennedy III in a losing effort against the Briscoe Brothers. =Sporadic tag team appearances (2007‚Äì2008, 2010, 2014‚Äì2015)= He returned to ROH along with Chris Sabin on March 30, 2007, following the Briscoe Brothers winning the ROH World Tag Team Championship. The two challenged Jay Briscoe for a shot at the title on April 28 in Chicago, then attacked him after he accepted. The two would ultimately lose the match and leave the company. In April 2008, Shelley and Sabin returned to ROH, losing to The Age of the Fall (Jimmy Jacobs and Tyler Black) and defeating the Briscoe Brothers (Jay and Mark) on the 18 and 19 respectively. In August 2008, Shelley and Sabin once again returned to ROH, wrestling Austin Aries and Bryan Danielson to a 25-minute time limit draw and losing to Kevin Steen and El Generico on the 1st and 2nd respectively. Shelley and Sabin were scheduled to return to ROH on October 24 and 25, but were pulled from the events by TNA and replaced by The Latin American Xchange. On February 13, 2010, Ring of Honor announced at their 8th Anniversary Show that the Motor City Machine Guns would return to the company on May 8 in New York City. On May 8 the Motor City Machine Guns were defeated by the ROH World Tag Team Champions The Kings of Wrestling (Chris Hero and Claudio Castagnoli) via disqualification, when the Briscoe Brothers interfered in the match. Shelley returned to ROH on December 7, 2014, at Final Battle 2014, where he and Kushida unsuccessfully challenged reDRagon (Bobby Fish and Kyle O'Reilly) for the ROH World Tag Team Championship. The Time Splitters returned to ROH on August 22, 2015, losing to the Briscoes at Field of Honor. Pro Wrestling Zero-1 Max (2005‚Äì2008) In March 2005, Shelley joined Pro Wrestling Zero1-Max. He won the vacant Zero1-Max United States Openweight Championship on September 19, 2005, in Tokyo, Japan, defeating Sonjay Dutt. His reign lasted until November 23 of that year, when he lost the title to Christopher Daniels. On August 25, 2006, at Korakuen Hall's Zero-1 Max show, Shelley and Chris Sabin became NWA International Lightweight Tag Team Champions, when they defeated champions, Ikuto Hidaka and Minoru Fujita. They lost the titles to the team of Minoru Fujita and Takuya Sugawara on April 6, 2008. Total Nonstop Action WrestlingGoldy Locks and the X Division (2004‚Äì2005)= Shelley signed a non‚Äìexclusive contract with Total Nonstop Action Wrestling on July 8, 2004. He was paired with Goldy Locks and dubbed \\"Baby Bear\\" Alex Shelley. Shelley requested his release from TNA late that year after booker Dusty Rhodes stopped utilizing him. Shelley signed a new contract with TNA in 2005 after Rhodes resigned as TNA booker, and returned on June 19, 2005, at Slammiversary, losing to Shocker. He went on to form a tag team with Michael Shane, with the duo losing to America's Most Wanted at No Surrender 2005 on July 17. Shelley entered the TNA 2005 Super X Cup Tournament, but lost to Samoa Joe in the semifinals on August 7. He then entered the Chris Candido Memorial Tag Team Tournament with Sean Waltman as his tag team partner, and won the tournament by defeating Shocker and Chris Sabin in the finals on the September 9 episode of TNA Impact!. As a result of their victory, Waltman and Shelley were granted a shot at the NWA World Tag Team Championship in a four‚Äìway tag team bout at Unbreakable on September 11. After Waltman no-showed the event, Shelley was left without a partner, but opted to wrestle alone. He was doubled teamed by Team Canada (Eric Young and A-1) for much of the match until Johnny Candido, the brother of Chris Candido, climbed onto the apron and accepted Shelley's tag. However, Candido was pinned by Young shortly thereafter, with Shelley being eliminated from the match as a result. Throughout late‚Äì2005, Shelley wrestled in the X Division as a villain, facing Austin Aries on several occasions. In November 2005, he introduced a gimmick that saw him bring a camcorder (the \\"Shelley‚Äìcam\\") to ringside in order to film matches to study later for strategic purposes (in reality, Shelley owned over 200 professional wrestling videotapes at the time). In late 2005, he began teaming with his former Generation Next teammates Austin Aries and Roderick Strong, feuding with established X Division fan favorites, Sonjay Dutt, Chris Sabin, and Matt Bentley and demanding bigger roles in the company from road agent Jerry Lynn which led to a series of matches in which the re‚Äìformed Generation Next came out on top. =Paparazzi Productions (2006‚Äì2007)= In early 2006, after both Aries and Strong were suspended by TNA, Shelley was recruited by Jeff Jarrett to obtain candid video footage of Jackie Gayda for the purposes of blackmail. Shelley went on to create the fictional enterprise \\"Paparazzi Productions\\" and obtain footage of Sting, Christian Cage and their respective families for the purposes of intimidation. Throughout April and May 2006, Shelley wrestled in the 2006 World X Cup Tournament as a member of the victorious Team USA. In May whilst the World X Cup was in progress, he interviewed Kevin Nash, during which Nash announced that the X Division was mere filler, and that intended to destroy the X Division. Shelley's lack of defense for the division created friction between his team mates and himself, with Shelley ultimately aligning himself with Nash after the tournament's end. Shelley at a TNA house show in January 2009 Since then the two did several well‚Äìreceived comedy vignettes (some exclusive to YouTube) mostly focusing on their feud with Chris Sabin. At Slammiversary, Shelley helped Nash defeat Sabin. Earlier Shelley had been ranked fifth in the X Division after being the second person eliminated in a six‚Äìman contender's match. In a post‚Äìmatch interview with Nash, Shelley claimed there was \\"ten guys, twenty guys ‚Äì some of them had knives. I think I spotted a couple gats... guns\\". On July 16, 2006, Shelley teamed with Nash to face Chris Sabin and Jay Lethal in a losing effort. At Hard Justice, Shelley replaced Nash in a match for the number one contendership of the X Division Championship. Shelley and Devine moved into the tag team division until they lost a Triple Chance Tag Team Battle Royal at No Surrender. Shelley also appeared in Kevin Nash's Open Invitational X Division Battle Royal at Bound for Glory on October 22, 2006. He lost the match to Austin Starr. On the June 29, 2006, Impact!, Shelley recruited former Team Canada member Johnny Devine as a production assistant of Paparazzi Productions. Devine was later fired by the Paparazzi. Devine was replaced much to the dismay of Shelley by former Generation Next team mate Austin Starr due to Kevin Nash's wishes. Since this, the three were seen backstage on various episodes of Impact! in a tournament known as the Paparazzi Championship Series, which he won at Final Resolution. Afterwards, he would tape two storyline attacks by The Latin American Xchange (LAX). One on Brother Rays uncle, another on Johnny Rodz. When he showed the footage of the LAX beatdown on Rodz, he was confronted by Brother Ray. Before a fight could breakout, the LAX attempted to attack Brother Ray. When it seemed Ray had the upper hand, however, Kevin Nash distracted him, allowing Shelley to hit him with a low blow. At Destination X 2007 Shelley helped LAX win the match by hitting Brother Devon with a video camera and giving him a Frog Splash through a table. Shelley lost in the five‚Äìman Xscape match at Lockdown 2007. He was pinned by Jay Lethal. Later, Jay Lethal and Chris Sabin were the remaining two and Sabin escaped, retaining the X Division Championship. =The Motor City Machine Guns (2007‚Äì2012)= During the summer of 2007, Shelley began wrestling as a tag team in TNA with Chris Sabin. The two had been teaming in several independent promotions under the names Murder City Machine Guns and The Motor City Machine Guns, both names being a play off of one of Shelley's former tag teams, \\"The Sexy Time Machine Guns\\" and the fact that both Sabin and Shelley hail from Detroit, Michigan. In October 2007, Shelley and Sabin started a feud with Team 3D, during which Team 3D declared a war on the entire X Division and was looking to kill it off. After months of feuding, Shelley and Sabin along with Jay Lethal were able to defeat Team 3D and Johnny Devine in a Street Fight at Against All Odds to save the X Division and to end the feud. With the win, Team 3D were forced to drop their weights under 275 pounds if they wanted to keep on wrestling for the company. Shelley then fought for Team TNA in the World X Cup alongside Kaz, the team captain, his tag team partner Chris Sabin, and Curry Man. On June 19, in the first round of the tournament, Shelley and Sabin defeated Daivari and Tyson Dux of Team International to give Team TNA their first point. In the finals of the tournament, held at Victory Road, Shelley, Sabin and Curry Man represented Team TNA in the twelve‚Äìman, four‚Äìteam elimination tag team match. Shelley made it to the end of the match and finally pinned Masato Yoshino of Team Japan to win the match and give Team TNA the lead ahead of the final round of the tournament, an Ultimate X match contested between the team captains. Despite Shelley's efforts, Team TNA was defeated in the final round by Team Mexico, who won the 2008 World X Cup. A month later, on July 25, 2008, Shelley and five other TNA wrestlers traveled to Mexico to compete in the Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre International Grand Prix, contested in a sixteen‚Äìman torneo cibernetico match. In the end, Shelley managed to avenge Team TNA's loss in the World X Cup, by winning the Gran Prix, after pinning √öltimo Guerrero. This led to a match on September 19 at CMLL's 75th Anniversary Show, where Shelley, Sabin and Sonjay Dutt unsuccessfully challenged Guerrero, Atlantis and Negro Casas for the CMLL World Trios Championship. After the tournaments Shelley and Sabin slipped into the role of tweeners, showing disrespect to Christian Cage, A.J. Styles, Consequences Creed, B.G. James and The Latin American Xchange however still being cheered heavily by the fans towards whom they did show respect. Shelley at Bound for Glory IV On the October 30, 2008, Impact!, Shelley, Samoa Joe, A.J. Styles, Jay Lethal, Consequences Creed, Petey Williams, Eric Young, ODB and Chris Sabin formed a faction knows as The Frontline to battle The Main Event Mafia of Kurt Angle, Sting, Kevin Nash, Booker T and Scott Steiner. Despite their alliance Shelley and Sabin showed disrespect to both their stablemates and the TNA executive shareholder Mick Foley. On the November 27, 2008, Impact!, Shelley took part in the second annual Turkey Bowl, defeating Cute Kip and Consequences Creed in a three‚Äìway dance in the semifinals. In the finals Shelley faced the reigning X Division Champion Sheik Abdul Bashir and Rhino in another three‚Äìway dance where the winner would receive a check for $25,000, and the loser had to wear a turkey suit. Rhino won the match, pinning Shelley following a Gore forcing him to wear the suit. Shelley finally agreed to put on the suit after Mick Foley threatened to fire him if he did not. After putting on the turkey suit Shelley gave Foley a middle finger and was laid out with a double arm DDT. At Final Resolution in December 2008, Shelley and Sabin competed in the Feast or Fired match, but did not win a title contract. During December 2008 and January 2009, Shelley qualified for the finals in the X Division title tournament after defeating Jay Lethal and Eric Young. At Genesis, he defeated his tag team partner Chris Sabin for his first reign as the X Division Champion. At Destination X in March 2009, he lost the title to Suicide in an Ultimate X match, which included Jay Lethal, Consequences Creed, and Chris Sabin. At Slammiversary Shelley, Sabin, Lethal, Creed and Suicide competed in the first ever X Division Title King of the Mountain match, in which Shelley was unsuccessful in regaining the title. Shelley (left) and Sabin in July 2010 After Slammiversary Shelley and Sabin went inactive, barely making television appearances. In making a comeback on the July 30 Impact! they could be seen in the crowd holding signs that read, \\"Conspiracy Victims\\" and \\"Yes, We Still Work Here\\". On August 6 the duo interrupted Daniels' backstage interview before his match with World Elite leader Eric Young and agreed to accompany him to the ring in order to get some TV time. Later that night, after being attacked by Sheik Abdul Bashir and Kiyoshi of World Elite, Shelley and Sabin aligned themselves with Daniels and other fan favorites in a brawl with the alliance of World Elite and Main Event Mafia, which made them fan favorites again. During September Shelley and Sabin began appearing as occasional commentators alongside Mike Tenay and Taz on Impact! broadcasts. In late 2009, Shelley and Sabin gained two shots at the TNA World Tag Team Championship, but were both times defeated by the Champions British Invasion (Doug Williams and Brutus Magnus), first at Turning Point in a three‚Äìway match, which also included Beer Money, Inc. (Robert Roode and James Storm) and then in a regular tag team match at Final Resolution. At Destination X Shelley and Sabin defeated Generation Me (Jeremy Buck and Max Buck) in an Ultimate X match to earn another shot at the TNA World Tag Team Championship. Shelley and Sabin received their title shot on the April 12 Impact!, but were defeated by World Tag Team Champion Matt Morgan and Amazing Red, who replaced the injured Hernandez in the match. Shelley posing with a TNA World Tag Team Championship belt The following month at Sacrifice the Motor City Machine Guns defeated Beer Money, Inc. and Team 3D in a three‚Äìway match to earn another shot at the Tag Team Championship. On July 11 at Victory Road the Motor City Machine Guns defeated Beer Money, Inc. to win the vacant TNA World Tag Team Championship for the first time. After Victory Road the Motor City Machine Guns entered a Best of Five Series with Beer Money, Inc., contested for the TNA World Tag Team Championship. Beer Money won the first two matches, a ladder match and a Street Fight, after knocking their opponents out with beer bottles. However, Shelley and Sabin came back to win the two following matches, a steel cage match and an Ultimate X match, to even the score to 2‚Äì2 and set up a deciding match for the August 12 Impact!. On the August 12 Impact! the Motor City Machine Guns defeated Beer Money, Inc. in a Two Out of Three Falls match to win the Best of Five Series and retain the TNA World Tag Team Championship. The following month at No Surrender, the Motor City Machine Guns retained their titles in a match against Generation Me. After the match Generation Me turned heel by attacking the Machine Guns and injuring Shelley in storyline. On the following Impact!, Generation Me laid claim to the TNA World Tag Team Championship, claiming that the champions would not be able to defend them for 30 days, due to Shelley's injury, before stealing Sabin's title belt. Shelley would however make his return two weeks later and promised Generation Me a rematch for the World Tag Team Championship at Bound for Glory. At the pay‚Äìper‚Äìview the Motor City Machine Guns defeated Generation Me to retain the TNA World Tag Team Championship. Also at Bound for Glory, Team 3D announced their retirement from professional wrestling, but requested one final match against the Motor City Machine Guns, whom they called the best tag team in wrestling. The Motor City Machine Guns accepted and the match took place on November 7, 2010, at Turning Point, where they defeated Team 3D to retain the TNA World Tag Team Championship. After Jeremy Buck pinned Sabin in an eight- person tag team match, where the Motor City Machine Guns teamed with Jay Lethal and Velvet Sky and Generation Me with Robbie E and Cookie, on the November 18 Impact!, the Motor City Machine Guns challenged Generation Me to an Empty Arena match. The match took place later that same night on Reaction with the Motor City Machine Guns coming out victorious. On December 5 at Final Resolution the Motor City Machine Guns defeated Generation Me in a Full Metal Mayhem match to retain the World Tag Team Championship. The following month at Genesis, Shelley and Sabin lost the World Tag Team Championship to Beer Money, Inc., after Roode rolled up Sabin, following a miscommunication between the Machine Guns. Shelley and Sabin received their rematch for the title on the following Impact!, but lost again due to a miscommunication. On January 16 Shelley broke his collarbone during a match in Hagerstown, Maryland. Originally, Shelley was advertised to make his return on April 17 at Lockdown in a nine-man Xscape match, but on April 7 he was removed from the match and his return postponed. Shelley made his return on April 20 at the tapings of the April 28 Impact!, saving Sabin from Mexican America (Anarquia and Hernandez). Ironically, the same day Shelley made his return, Sabin suffered a knee injury in his match with Anarquia. Later that same week, Sabin underwent knee surgery, which would sideline him for the rest of the year. Bobby Roode at Slammiversary IX On the June 2 Impact Wrestling, Shelley formed an alliance with former rivals Beer Money, Inc., who were looking for a partner to replace the injured Bobby Roode in their World Tag Team Championship defense against the British Invasion at Slammiversary IX. At the pay-per-view, Shelley and Storm were successful in their title defense. At Destination X, Shelley defeated Amazing Red, Robbie E and Shannon Moore in an Ultimate X match to become the number one contender to the TNA X Division Championship. Shelley received his shot at the X Division Championship, held by Brian Kendrick, on the July 21 Impact Wrestling, but was defeated following outside interference from Austin Aries. Two weeks later, Aries defeated Shelley in a singles match. On August 7 at Hardcore Justice, Shelley and Aries competed in a three-way match for the TNA X Division Championship, but were both unable to win the belt from the defending champion, Brian Kendrick. After a four-month absence, Shelley returned on the January 19, 2012, Impact Wrestling, confronting and challenging X Division Champion Austin Aries. The following week, Shelley defeated Zema Ion to become the number one contender to Aries' title. On February 12 at Against All Odds, Shelley was unsuccessful in his title challenge against Aries, after submitting to the Last Chancery. On March 18 at Victory Road, TNA started promoting the returns of Chris Sabin and the Motor City Machine Guns. Sabin returned on the April 5 Impact Wrestling, where he and Shelley defeated Mexican America in a tag team match, before announcing their intention of going for the TNA World Tag Team Championship, held by Magnus and Samoa Joe. On April 15 at Lockdown, The Motor City Machine Guns unsuccessfully challenged Magnus and Joe for the TNA World Tag Team Championship in a steel cage match. During the next month, The Motor City Machine Guns did not make another appearance on Impact Wrestling, instead wrestling exclusively on TNA house shows. On May 21, it was reported that Shelley had chosen not to renew his contract with TNA, ending his eight-year run with the promotion. On May 29, Shelley was removed from the official TNA roster page, confirming his departure from the promotion. New Japan Pro- WrestlingEarly appearances (2009‚Äì2010)= On January 4, 2009, Shelley and Sabin defeated No Limit (Tetsuya Naito and Yujiro) at New Japan Pro- Wrestling's Wrestle Kingdom III in Tokyo Dome to win the IWGP Junior Heavyweight Tag Team Championship. They followed in the footsteps of American Dragon and Curry Man as the only other gaijin team to win those titles. After three successful title defenses, two of which took place in TNA, Shelley and Sabin lost the IWGP Junior Heavyweight Tag Team Title to Apollo 55 (Prince Devitt and Ryusuke Taguchi) on July 5, 2009, at NJPW's Circuit 2009 New Japan Soul. On November 8, 2010, NJPW announced that the Motor City Machine Guns would be returning to the promotion the following month, competing at events on December 11 and 12. On December 11 the Motor City Machine Guns were defeated by No Limit in their New Japan return match. The following day they defeated Apollo 55 in the fourth ever match between the two teams. =Time Splitters (2012‚Äì2015)= Following his departure from TNA, New Japan announced on August 13, 2012, that Shelley would be returning to the promotion the following month. Before Shelley's return to Japan, he and A.J. Kirsch unsuccessfully challenged Forever Hooligans (Alex Koslov and Rocky Romero) for the IWGP Junior Heavyweight Tag Team Championship on August 26 at a Sacramento Wrestling Federation (SWF) event in Gridley, California. Following the match, Kushida saved Shelley from a beatdown at the hands of Koslov and Romero. Shelley wrestled his New Japan return match on September 7, when he, Bushi, M√°scara Dorada and Ryusuke Taguchi were defeated in an eight-man tag team match by Alex Koslov, Averno, Low Ki and Rocky Romero. Afterwards, Shelley continued teaming with Kushida with the two forming the tag team \\"Time Splitters\\" and scoring several wins over Koslov and Romero in multiple man teamed matches, after debuting their new double-team finishing maneuver, the I-94. On October 8 at King of Pro-Wrestling, Time Splitters unsuccessfully challenged Forever Hooligans for the IWGP Junior Heavyweight Tag Team Championship. On October 21, the Time Splitters entered the 2012 Super Jr. Tag Tournament, defeating Jado & Gedo in their first round match.

PYMOM is named such because of the shape the cue-cards form during the progression of the game, a right-angled or Pythagorean triangle. It is a theoretical educational method that is made up of several established and tested educational methods that have been in use for decades. Methodology PYMOM is a composite body of techniques that claims, in its digital form, to incorporate (to a greater or lesser degree): spaced repetition, non-failure redundant subroutine, chromatics, positive reinforcement, the Von Restorff effect, picture association, selective musical tonality, kinesthetics, the serial-position effect and meditation. There are two branches of this methodology: #the historical, physical incarnation, the Triangular Movement Cycle and #the digitized version, incorporating the significant addition of the aforementioned educational methods and theories, Pythagorean Method of Memorization. Process & application As with both branches, there is only one variable in the game or learning method: a correct or incorrect answer. The initial movement cycle also remains largely unchanged. The movement cycle which is most crucial to the methodology and reinforces the spaced repetition, begins with either 3, 4 or 5 cards; 3 cards for a 6-card session, 4 cards for a 10-card session and 5 cards for the most advanced 15-card session. Because two-sided associative cue-cards are being used, all cards are presented with a congruent side up, either all \\"terms\\" or \\"definitions,\\" not mixed. Once cards have been answered correctly, the predominant row has reached its maximum and a card must be graduated out of this row to continue the game. Thus the card to the far right comes into play. Routines are repeated as each row reaches its maximum. A cue-card is finally eliminated from the game session by being answered correctly once more, after it has graduated to the top tier or row. Triangular Movement Cycle The first manifestation, referred to as the \\"Triangular Movement Cycle\\" or TMC, was a simple paper-based learning technique that was primarily a manual movement cycle using physical cue-cards, which allowed for manual-spaced repetition to elicit psychological retention of information. Its origins, however, are not very clear. Using TMC, teachers would move the cards for the student in a one-on-one setting according to either the correct or incorrect feedback from the student. This presented challenges for the teacher or tutor using this method. The first challenge lies in the fact that, although TMC lent itself well to a two-party learning group (i.e. teacher & student), it could also be done by the student themselves on their own. It was a very easy system to utilize once learned, however, it was found exceptionally difficult to teach the complex movement cycle and principles behind such to students, especially where a linguistic barrier was present. The second challenge lay in that the educator needed to create and remember innumerable cue-cards or create custom master lists in order to know the correct answers ‚Äî and properly guide the student, thus progressing or digressing the card in play. TMC often failed to keep the attention of many students owing to the fact that cards were not very visually appealing. To make them so required tremendous effort ‚Äî and was very time consuming. The term \\"Pythagorean Method of Memorization\\" was coined in 2013 and officially copyrighted in October 2014 by a Canadian company named You Learn Educational Solutions & Linguistics Inc. PYMOM takes the movement cycle from TMC and remedied the challenge of teaching the movement cycle itself to students by providing a software-based solution to handling cycles by means of sub-routines prompted by the user‚Äôs input. PYMOM wove established educational theory into the fabric of TMC to create a viable educational platform for academic and linguistic study by several means. Because spaced repetition is intrinsically part of the movement-cycle subroutines, it adds to the content and surrounding experience making it into a platform. The developers of PYMOM describe it as an ‚Äúorganic learning experience.‚Äù The tenets that truly allow a learning system to be a PYMOM-based system are enumerated thusly: The Von Restorff effect: for example, where it features a language, this method is employed to further aid in memory retention of the highlighted word in the phrase. *Chromatics: there are no white backgrounds where learning takes place. *Positive Reinforcement: There are no truly \\"wrong\\" responses, only mistakes. These mistakes are greeted by neutral reinforcement and \\"correct\\" responses are rewarded with positive reinforcement. *Picture Association: Visual aids should accompany concept-based material. *Selective Musical Tonality: the learning experience should always incorporate music; generally instrumental, that aids learning by increasing focus and reducing stress (which inhibits learning). *Kinesthetics: whether by utilizing a touch-screen, key board or mouse, a level of physical movement should always be present while learning to further increase retention. *The Serial Position Effect: taking breaks at specific, regular intervals to aid in learning and reduce stress levels. *Meditation: a session of meditation should be incorporated into every learning session to allow for further retention of the information.

It was closed on September 30, 2011. In 2002 Brooks Air Force Base was renamed Brooks City-Base when the property was conveyed to the Brooks Development Authority as part of a unique project between local, state, and federal government. The Brooks Development Authority is now the owner and operator of the property, and is redeveloping it as a science, business, and technology center. The Air Force was the largest tenant at Brooks City-Base. Brooks Air Force Base was one of thirty-two Air Service, United States Army training camps established in 1918 after the United States entry into World War I, being established on December 8, 1917 as Kelly Field No. 5.William R. Evinger: Directory of Military Bases in the U.S., Oryx Press, Phoenix, Ariz., 1991, p. 147.

History Brooks Air Force Base was named to honor San Antonio aviator Sidney Johnson Brooks, Jr.Evinger, 1991. Cadet Brooks died on November 13, 1917 when his Curtiss JN-4 nosed down as he prepared to land after his final training flight at Kelly Field, Texas, possibly because he had blacked out in reaction to the inoculations they had been given shortly before the flight. Brooks was one of the first to volunteer at the call for men for the American Flying Corps; he was about to complete his training for a commission as a military aviator.Location of U.S. Aviation Fields, The New York Times, 21 July 1918 He was awarded his wings and commission posthumously. World War I The history of Brooks Air Force Base parallels the history of military aviation and aviation medicine in the United States. After the United States entered World War I, in April 1917, the U.S. Army recognized the need for trained flying instructors. San Antonio was chosen for a year-round training site due to its favorable climate, good water supply and convenient transportation facilities.USAF History Office, Brooks City-Base The Chamber of Commerce assembled an 873-acre tract southeast of the city near Berg's Mill and offered it as the site for the new aviation field. The site was originally called Gosport Field, a name derived from the flight instruction system used at the new base. On December 5, 1917, the Army named the site Kelly Field No. 5, and on 8 December, ground breaking ceremonies were held. On February 16, 1918, Kelly Field No. 5 became a separate post and named Brooks Field by the Aviation Section, U.S. Signal Corps The first commander of Brooks Field was Lt. Col. H. Conger Pratt, who until the preceding October had been a cavalryman. The first aircraft flown from the new Brooks Field, on March 28, 1918, was a Curtiss JN-4D \\"Jenny\\" of World War I fame, piloted by Maj. Leo A. Walton. Brooks Field, contained the principal flight instructor's school. Brooks Field was used as the Air Service Flight Instructor's School. It was a six-week course, with a maximum student capacity of 300.Manning, Thomas A. (2005), History of Air Education and Training Command, 1942‚Äì2002.

In May 1919, the pilot instructor school was closed and a Balloon and Airship School was opened for pilots and ground crew members. A huge 91,000-square-foot airship hangar was constructed. ;; Balloon units assigned: * 67th Balloon Company, May‚ÄìJune 1919 * 72d Balloon Company, May‚ÄìJune 1919 * 93d to 99th Balloon Company, May‚ÄìJune 1919 : Consolidated into the Air Corps Balloon and Airship School, Brooks Field, June 1919 However, a series of mishaps in operating the hydrogen-filled craft led to the transfer of the school from Brooks to Scott Field, Illinois on June 26, 1922. The base commander at the time, Major John A. Paegelow, an experienced commander in lighter-than-air craft activities, left for the position of executive officer at Scott Field the same year. After the cancellation of the airship training, the 11th School Group was formed at Brooks Field as the Primary Flying School for the Air Service and Army Air Corps, replacing the World War I school at Carlstrom Field, Florida.Maurer, Maurer (1987), Aviation in the U. S. Army, 1919-1939. United States Air Force Historical Research Center Brooks Field, Texas, JN-6s, 1925 The Primary Flying School operated between September 1922 through July 1931. The school took about six months initially, with advanced training later divided into three months each of basic and advanced instruction. The dual trainer initially used was the Curtiss JN-6H. Brooks later accepted other planes, including Vought VE-7 Bluebirds and Dayton-Wright TA-3s, for evaluation, but JNs were used until 1926. The beginning class in March of that year was the first without Jennies. Students now flew in the new Consolidated PT-1, with tandem seats and a Wright E engine. A few National Guard officers went to Brooks Field in January 1923 for pilot instruction. World War I flyers underwent refresher training while others took the regular course. Eight of the ten officers entering graduated to become junior airplane pilots. The Air Service suggested, and the Militia Bureau adopted, a policy of giving men flying training before commissioning them in the Guard. During the 1920s, the Primary Flying School at Brooks expanded but still could not accommodate all primary students. Needing another school, the Air Corps reopened March Field, California. Reorganizing pilot training, the Air Corps created a Training Center at San Antonio with Brig. Gen. Frank P. Lahm in charge. He opened headquarters at Duncan Field on September 1, 1926. As an Assistant Chief of Air Corps, he commanded the Primary Flying School and the School of Aviation Medicine (Flight Surgeons) at Brooks Field, and the Advanced Flying School at Kelly Field. In 1927 basic moved out of the advanced phase and combined with primary. At that point, primary-basic changed to eight months in length and advanced to four months. With the beginning of the five- year expansion program. More than 1,400 pilots were trained during those years and graduates included such notable aviation figures as Generals Claire L. Chennault, Thomas D. White, Nathan F. Twining, and Col. Charles A. Lindbergh. Also during this period, the School of Aviation Medicine was moved from Mitchel Field, New York, to Brooks. The flying school was a source for aviation medicine research and, in turn, the School of Aviation Medicine provided a means to screen, examine and upgrade the caliber of cadets being trained at Brooks. Both organizations were transferred to the newly constructed Randolph Field in October 1931. Brooks Field, 1939 On September 28, 1929, Brooks was the site for the first successful mass parachute drop in the world. The concept, conceived and implemented at Brooks, confirmed the practicality of tactical paratrooper warfare. The concept proved its value during World War II. During the 1930s, Brooks was the center of aerial observation activity and several units were trained in tactical observation. In 1938, the Air Corps wanted to move Headquarters 21st Balloon Group to Brooks Field to organize a balloon school. Ten years had passed since it had trained observers at Scott Field. It needed 300 more observers for balloon units in mobilization plans. It wanted to run two sessions a year at Brooks, with five officers of the Regular Army and 15 from the National Guard in each class. The War Department thought the proposal significant enough to merit further study. On September 21, 1938, the small band of lighter-than-air enthusiasts in the Air Corps lost their leader (General Westover) in an aircraft crash. Instead of letting the Air Corps open a school, the War Department inactivated the 21st Balloon Group at Scott Field on June 1, 1939. Thus, the lighter-than-air branch consisted of 3 balloon squadrons, plus 10 officers and 350 enlisted men, when war broke out in Europe. In 1940, Brooks became the site for a special school for combat observers. World War II Observation Cadets and Training Instructor with O-47 Twin-engine Cessna AT-17 Bobcats on parking apron During World War II, Brooks Field housed the School for Combat Observers and the Advanced Flying School (Observation). To cope with the huge buildup in personnel and equipment, the Air Corps adopted a policy of using temporary constructio for housing and permanent structures for technical buildings, putting up tents to accommodate personnel. The observation observers and pilots were graduates of the Advanced Flying School and were selected for this hazardous duty, as the observation aircraft were unarmed when flying over enemy-held territory. They flew the North American O-47 two-man aircraft, with the pilot being in charge of the aircraft and the aircraft observer taking photographs and notes of the ground below. Brooks Army Airfield 1942-1 Classbook The Observation School course was ten weeks in length. The observers were thoroughly trained in code practice and the use of the radio for air-to-ground communication, and the pilots were trained in transition flying. Later in the course, photography from aircraft was taught and concentration of instruction was performed in flying as a team. Six student observers and three pilots were assigned to each flight. The program remained in operation until 1943 when it was disbanded. Training in the school then switched to twin-engine aircraft, flying the Curtiss AT-9 \\"Jeep,\\" the all-wood Beechcraft AT-10 Wichita, or the Cessna AT-17 Bobcat, subsequently training pilots to fly the B-25 Mitchell bomber beginning in 1943 until the end of the war. Cold WarReserve Training Center= Hangar 9 stands as the only World War I era aircraft hangar listed in the National Register of Historic Places. Hangar 9 was built as a \\"temporary\\" structure in 1918 when Brooks Field was established as the location for the Signal Corps Aviation School. When pilot training at Brooks Field concluded at the end of World War II, the base took on a new mission. In September 1951 in the midst of the Korean War, the Air Force established a reserve training center at Brooks Air Force Base. The 907th Air Reserve Wing was assigned to the center. Conceived originally as a troop carrier unit, the wing did not receive its first planes until the summer of 1952. The planes were T-6 Texans, an indication of the 907th's new mission, Air Force Reserve pilot training. Almost before it began its new mission, the 907th Air Reserve Wing was replaced by the 8707th Pilot Training Wing (Single-Engine). On the first anniversary of its activation, the 8707th had six T-6s and two C-46 Commandoes assigned. That began to change in April 1953 when the wing acquired its first five North American T-28 Trojans. In 1954 Colonel David L. \\"Tex\\" Hill, a fighter pilot who made his reputation as a member of Chennault's Flying Tigers, took over the wing's pilot training program. At year's end the wing converted to C-46s and the 8707th was replaced by the 433d Troop Carrier Wing. In 1956 reservists celebrated their fifth anniversary at Brooks with the arrival of another aircraft, the C-119 Flying Boxcar transport. Four years later, the 433d Troop Carrier Wing moved to Kelly AFB. From the time the Reserve first established a wing at Brooks in 1951, whatever the numerical designation, the people of San Antonio have always referred to the unit as the Alamo Wing. An era in aviation history ended on June 20, 1960, when the last plane took off from Brooks. The aircraft was a C-131 Samaritan piloted by Col. L.B. Matthews, commander of Det. 1, 1st Aeromedical Transport Group. =Aerospace Medicine= \\"Weightless 2,\\" an F-100 Super Sabre static display on Brooks City-Base commemorating the research done through the Aerospace Medical Division with astronaut candidates. During the late 1950s, Brooks was transformed from a flying training center to a center for modern medical research and development and education. The transition started in the summer of 1959 when the School of Aviation Medicine returned to Brooks from Randolph AFB. Brooks became the headquarters for the School of Aerospace Medicine (SAM). In 1957, SAM scientists moved into the newly completed center at Brooks AFB. SAM aided the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) with Project Mercury and served as a back-up site for lunar samples brought back to Earth on the Apollo missions between 1969‚Äì1972. The air evacuation program at Brooks AFB proved vital to the care of wounded personnel in the Vietnam War. On November 1, 1961, Air Training Command transferred jurisdiction of Brooks AFB to Air Force Systems Command (AFSC). This was all part of an Air Force plan to reorganize aerospace medical research. Along with the transfer of Brooks, ATC passed to AFSC (and its newly formed Aerospace Medical Division at Brooks) control of the USAF Aerospace Medical Center, the School of Aerospace Medicine, the USAF Hospital Lackland, and the 3790th Epidemiological Laboratory. (The School of Aviation Medicine had been re-designated as the School of Aerospace Medicine on May 8, 1961.) However, the Medical Service School at Gunter AFB, Alabama remained in the command, reassigned from the medical center to Headquarters ATC on October 1. United States President John F. Kennedy dedicated the School of Aerospace Medicine on November 21, 1963, the day before he was assassinated in Dallas. This was Kennedy's last official act as president. In 1962, USAF Colonel B. Dean Smith was conducting a test of the Gemini space suit with a colleague in a pure oxygen chamber at Brooks when a fire broke out, destroying the chamber. Smith and his partner narrowly escaped. On January 31, 1967, Airman 2/C William F. Bartley, Jr., and Airman 3/C Richard G. Harmon were killed in a flash fire while tending laboratory rabbits in the Two Man Space Environment Simulator, a pure oxygen chamber at the School of Aerospace Medicine. Like the Apollo 1 spacecraft fire, which occurred four days earlier, the SAM fire was caused by an electrical spark in a pure oxygen environment. The widows of the Apollo 1 crew sent condolence letters to Bartley and Harmon's families. After the Vietnam War, the base's mission narrowed to one centered on specific research related to aeronautically rated U.S. Air Force personnel (e.g., pilots and navigators, to include USAF astronauts) and enlisted aircrew. The aerospace era placed new demands on medical research and education, particularly in space medicine. Research efforts at the USAF School of Aerospace Medicine were instrumental in making manned space flight a reality. Researchers continued to study man's interaction with the aerospace environment, seeking ways to maximize a pilot's ability to use modern, high performance aircraft. Flight simulation devices, the centrifuge, altitude chambers, lasers and other specially developed equipment, enabled researchers to perform laboratory studies of man's tolerances in the aerospace environment. Visual reality training on pilot/cockpit systems to help make their training more realistic. In the early 1980s, other organizations relocated to Brooks AFB. Among them were the Air Force Human Resources Laboratory and the USAF Occupational and Environmental Health Laboratory. In addition to the Air Force Office of Medical Support, Brooks became home to the Air Force Drug Testing Laboratory and the Air Force Systems Command's Systems Acquisition School. A new Schriever Heritage Park, named for General Bernard A. Schriever, first commander of Air Force Systems Command, was dedicated on October 7, 1986, during the celebration of Aerospace Medical Division's 25th Anniversary. The Aerospace Medical Division was redesignated the Human Systems Division on February 6, 1987. In November 1987, Brooks celebrated its 70th anniversary. During the celebration the Sidney J. Brooks Jr. Memorial Park was dedicated. This area, along with Schriever Heritage Park, provides a quiet beauty to the base and offers a spot for remembrance of the heritage that is Brooks AFB. The 1990s ushered in a new era. For several years the Department of Defense had been looking for leaner, and smarter cost-saving ways to do business. However, this process was intensified with the unexpected collapse of communism in Eastern Europe and the demise of the Soviet Union. Americans expected a peace dividend‚Äîa reduction in defense spending. Downsizing became the key word, but Brooks AFB continued to grow. In 1991 four of its laboratories‚Äîthe Air Force Human Resources Laboratory, the Air Force Drug Testing Laboratory, the Harry G. Armstrong Aerospace Medical Research Laboratory, and the Air Force Occupational and Environmental Health Laboratory, as well as the laboratory function of the USAF School of Aerospace Medicine‚Äîcombined to become the Armstrong Laboratory, one of four super laboratories in the Air Force. Also, the Air Force Center for Environmental Excellence was formed and located at Brooks. This organization has the monumental task of restoring closing installations to their original state and of ensuring that future installations are environmentally safe. Consolidations continued in 1992 with the merging of the Air Force Systems Command and the Air Force Logistics Command into a new organization called the Air Force Materiel Command. As a part of the new command, the Human Systems Division at Brooks again changed its name to the Human Systems Center. Although the Air Force continued to shrink, it would be flexible enough to respond on short notice to a wide range of regional crises and contingencies. Brooks City- Base  Brooks City-Base, 2006. Note the airfield patterns, Hangars and runways still visible in the airphoto. Following the 1995 BRAC, when Brooks AFB was removed from the Base Realignment and Closure list, city, state, military, and community planners began several years of hard work to develop a plan to privatize approved the gradual transition in ownership of Brooks AFB from the Air Force to the Brooks Development Authority. This transition came into full effect on Jul. 22, 2002, when the Brooks Development Authority assumed control of the newly named Brooks City-Base. In 2005, Brooks City-Base was once again placed on the BRAC list. Air Force operations ceased on Sep. 15, 2011. The Brooks Development Authority has demonstrated economic development success with projects including a retail development, approximately of research and distribution facilities for DPT Laboratories, the South Texas Center for Emerging Infectious Diseases (an infectious disease research institute coordinated with the University of Texas at San Antonio), an international pharmaceutical company, and a $25.5 million City/County emergency operations center which opened in the fall of 2007. The 311th Air Base Group inactivated on Sept. 1, 2011, and the remaining few USAF personnel had shuttered the base for good by the 15th of that month. In the spring of 2006, construction of Brooks Academy of Science and Engineering, a STEM charter school, started on 8 acres of land in the southeast part of Brooks City Base. Classes had already started in August 2006 at a temporary location on South Presa Street (in the far west part of Brooks City Base), and then students were relocated to the current location of Brooks Academy (on the north side of Lyster Road) in March 2007. In August 2011, Texas A&M; University opened a satellite campus at 2601 Louis Bauer Drive (in the west part of Brooks City Base), and uses this building for the College of Business and the Department of Counseling and Leadership. In 2012, the $90 million Mission Trail Baptist Hospital opened at 3327 Research Plaza.mysanantonio.com On August 8, 2016, the University of the Incarnate Word opened a School of Osteopathic Medicine on 16 acres in the northwest part of Brooks City Base (at 100 Kennedy Circle), in buildings which were once the Air Force School of Aerospace Medicine.

Professional wrestling career  After a successful amateur wrestling career and a stint in the United States Army, James Raschke started in professional wrestling in 1966 in the American Wrestling Association as a referee. He was soon wrestling under his real name, playing off of his amateur wrestling notoriety in the area. He eventually changed his ring name to Baron von Raschke and claimed to be from Germany. He would do a goose-step and then put his finisher known as the \\"brainclaw\\", on his opponent. Earlier in his career, the Von Raschke had a finishing maneuver known as the \\"Prussian sleeper\\", a rather complex variation of a traditional sleeper hold. His mantra at the time was; \\"I am ordered to win! I must win! And I will win!\\" Throughout the 1970s and early 1980s he held numerous singles and tag team titles throughout several NWA and AWA territories, as well as wrestling for the WWWF, where his claw hold was \\"censored\\" by a huge red X on WWWF television because it was considered such a violent act. Managed by Fred Blassie, Von Raschke's highest-profile match of his 1970s WWWF run came in March 1977, where he wrestled WWWF World Heavyweight Champion Bruno Sammartino for the title at Madison Square Garden in New York. Von Raschke lost the match by disqualification when, after Sammartino became tied up in the ropes, he shoved the referee away as he had his clawhold applied to Sammartino's head. Sammartino defeated Von Raschke in a rematch a month later at Madison Square Garden, marking Sammartino's last successful title defense before losing the belt to Superstar Billy Graham. In 1978, Von Raschke was recognized as the first NWA Television champion (the Mid Atlantic Television title had been renamed). Raschke in 1975 In May 1984, Raschke and The Crusher defeated Jerry Blackwell and Ken Patera for the AWA World Tag Team Championship. They would lose the belts in August of that same year to The Road Warriors. In 1986, he wrestled for the NWA's Jim Crockett Promotions where he reunited with former tag partner Paul Jones (who was now a manager) as part of Paul Jones' Army. He also filled in for the injured Krusher Khruschev, defending the NWA World Six-Man Tag Team Championship with Ivan and Nikita Koloff. Toward the end of his run there he turned \\"face\\" against Jones and teamed with Hector Guerrero defeating the Barbarian and Pez Whatley at Starrcade (1986). After teaming with Wahoo McDaniel at the 1987 Crockett Cup he left the National Wrestling Alliance. He had a brief stint in the World Wrestling Federation in 1988 as the manager for The Barbarian and The Warlord (The Powers of Pain) under the name of the \\"Baron\\", but was released shortly after his arrival. Raschke resurfaced in the AWA, returning to the ring to feud with Soldat Ustinov and Teijho Khan in late 1988. He then went on to captain \\"Baron's Blitzers\\" during the Team Challenge Series. When the AWA folded, Raschke continued to wrestle for independent promotions, primarily in the Minnesota area, retiring in 1995. Raschke also took part in one of the legends matches at WCW's inaugural Slamboree: A Legend's Reunion in 1993. He teamed with Ivan Koloff, losing to Thunderbolt Patterson and Brad Armstrong. His last match was a victory over David Lynch at Superstars of Wrestling in Princeton, West Virginia on February 10, 1996. When not wrestling, Raschke worked as a substitute teacher. Upon retirement, Raschke purchased and managed a bric-a-brac shop called The Wigwam in Lake George, Minnesota. He sold it in 2000. In April 2007, James Raschke began a several month run at the Minnesota History Theatre in a play based around his life, persona, and times in the AWA. The play detailed how a very mild-mannered and polite man created an in-ring gimmick that drew so much heat that he and his frequent tag-team wrestling partner (and real life friend) Mad Dog Vachon often had to fight their way out of the ring.

Early life V√≠ctor Carranza was born in the small town of Guateque, Boyac√°, in a very poor family of farmers and pig growers. He had dropped school already at 2nd grade, and by age 8 he was already involved in emerald business, by scratching the soil for the gemstones, and then a few years later as a mine worker in Chivor. He started making money after moving to Gachal√°, in 1947, where he found three large sources. He found his first emerald mine in 1960, Pe√±as Blancas, and from then on his influence and power kept increasing, expanding his business by associating with others, buying share rights from new mines in Muzo and Qu√≠pama, and selling emeralds in Europe, thanks particularly to his business with lawyer Juan Beetar Down, who took Carranza to many countries and opened to him the doors of political influence and taught him in the art of diplomacy, leading to even meet often with presidents. The money flowing in from the newfound mines soon became a matter of conflict and in the 1960s a series of vendettas and disputes gave rise to the so-called \\"first green war,\\" which he not only survived but used in his favor to increase his power. He had already made a name as a wealthy and stingy man, but also as a violent man, surrounded by armed bodyguards. Associates One of his most powerful associates was Gilberto Molina Moreno, the \\"emerald czar\\" of the time, and together they were the main beneficiaries of the requests for bids of the emerald mines by the governments of Misael Pastrana and Alfonso L√≥pez, which essentially eliminated governmental control of the mines, and allowed Carranza and Molina to legalize their riches and to take control of the security of the regions. A new green war was unleashed in the 1980s, and this one also involved violent drug lord Gonzalo Rodr√≠guez Gacha, who had been an old associate of both Carranza and Molina. Carranza was always linked to Rodr√≠guez Gacha, but Carranza always denied such links and stated he always opposed the introduction of drug cartels in his region. Rodr√≠guez Gacha had wanted to consolidate his power in the region, and also received financial support from Molina to train the first paramilitary troops. When the drug lord allegedly asked them to participate as a partner in the mines, Molina and Carranza refused which led to violent retaliation by the drug lord, who murdered Molina, and later detonated a bomb in the offices of Tecminas in Bogot√°, which were property of Carranza, and whose nephew's murder he also ordered. These violent actions led Carranza to a self-imposed internment to protect himself. Reportedly, Carranza was instrumental in providing intelligence reports about Rodr√≠guez Gacha that led to his demise. The Emerald Czar The death of Rodr√≠guez Gacha and that of other emerald traders meant he obtained even more power, and in 1990 he signed a peace agreement with his rivals in the business, particularly Luis Murcia, (aka el Pequin√©s) mediated by the Catholic church. He also spread his connection to politicians, and military, which joined to his entrepreneurial proficiency led him to become the new emerald czar, one that ruled with an iron fist. As such he enjoyed some peace, and although he was completely involved in the green wars and the thousands of deaths they produced, he was never accused for that reason. He also bought many lands in the Llanos Orientales region, to such an extent that at his peak he managed to own about 10,000 acres, and he created his own militia to protect them, the feared \\"Carranceros.\\" This and his friendship with the region paramilitary leader H√©ctor Buitrago (aka Mart√≠n Llanos) only reinforced his links to illegal paramilitary groups, for which he never was judged. He was accused by paramilitary leader Don Mario of being the instigator of the war between the paramilitary organizations led by Miguel Arroyave and Buitrago respectively that led to thousands of deaths in the department of Casanare. Arrests He was accused, however, of participating in a massacre of 40 farmers in the Meta department and arrested, but he was absolved two months later. Some years later he would be part of a new conflict, this time involving Leonidas Vargas, an old worker of Rodr√≠guez Gacha who accused him of the disappearance of his daughter. His support of the Convivir watch groups which were at the root of many paramilitary organizations led him to jail once again in 1998, and a controversy was created when Juan Manuel Santos (ex president of Colombia) called the Attorney General to ask about his friend Carranza, and also when he was visited in jail by the then president of the powerful cattlemen association Fedeg√°n. Despite the finding of corpses and a paramilitary training camp in some of his farms, he only spent three years and a half jailed in a DAS installation, during which time an attempt at his life was made by poisoning his food. He was finally absolved, once again, when the judge to determine his guilt was suddenly changed, and the new judge found no reason to condemn him.http://www.professionaljeweler.com/archives/articles/2002/mar02/0302gn1.html Green Wars Once out of jail his war to Leonidas Vargas continued, until the latter was killed by hitmen in Spain in 2009. He also found himself in another war, this time against Yesid Nieto, a young emerald trader who had made a fortune in drug trafficking and had started making a name in the emerald field after being introduced to it by another rival of Carranza, Pedro Nel Rinc√≥n, (aka Pedro Orejas). Nieto appointed himself as the new emerald czar and associated with the paramilitary forces at the service of Freddy Rend√≥n (aka el Alem√°n) to fight Carranza. Nieto was killed in Guatemala in 2007. The conflict with Rinc√≥n continued, despite some attempts at negotiation, as Rinc√≥n involved himself with a number of drug lords and paramilitary leaders, particularly Pedro Oliveiro Guerrero (a.k.a. Cuchillo) and Daniel Barrera Barrera. It was in the context of this new green war that some months later another attempt at Carranza's life was made when his convoy was attacked with guns and grenades, an attack that has been attributed to Rinc√≥n and the drug lords. It's estimated that 25 assassination attempts were made on Carranza's life. Death In a 2012 interview for Al Jazeera, Carranza declared \\"Six years ago I was diagnosed with prostate cancer and I never took a pill for that. But two years ago I got lung cancer and that one has got me all the way up to the hair .... It's about time for God to remember me and call me to his side.\\" Also in 2012, prosecutors launched an investigation to find out whether Carranza financed a number of paramilitary groups in the 1990s based on testimony given by a former leader of the paramilitary group called United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia, Fredy Rendon Herrera. Carranza claimed that he was instead the victim of extortion. After being hospitalized for a week in Fundaci√≥n Santa Fe de Bogot√° he finally died of lung cancer on April 4, 2013.https://www.economist.com/news/obituary/21576363-v%C3%ADctor-carranza- ni%C3%B1o-colombias-emerald-tsar-died-april-4th-aged-77-v%C3%ADctor-carranza V√≠ctor Carranza: V√≠ctor Carranza Ni√±o, Colombia‚Äôs ‚Äúemerald tsar‚Äù, died on April 4th, aged 77 ReferencesAdditional sources *\\"Colombia's emerald tsar\\", documentary from Al Jazeera *Colombia's Great Survivor: Victor Carranza Category:1935 births Category:2013 deaths Category:Colombian businesspeople Category:Colombian mining businesspeople ","title":"V√≠ctor Carranza"},{"id":"1875958","text":"Peter Lei Wang-Kei ÊùéÂÆèÂü∫‰∏ªÊïô (March 29, 1922 ‚Äì July 23, 1974) was the fourth Roman Catholic bishop of Hong Kong.

It is currently part of the New Ireland Province of Papua New Guinea. The local language is a dialect of the Mussau-Emira language. Emira is part of what on many maps are charted as the St Matthias Islands, also known as the Mussau Islands, a small group to the north-west of the main-island group of New Ireland. Early explorers named it Squally Island, a name still found in some early records. History=World War II Early in World War II this small island became international news when over 500 prisoners from various ships (including RMS Rangitane) sunk by German surface raiders were released following the first attack on Nauru and subsequently rescued by the Australian authorities. Released prisoners on Emirau Emirau was seized unopposed by two battalions of the United States 4th Marine Division on 20 March 1944. Base development Construction activities were taken in hand by the US Navy Seabees of the 18th Construction Regiment, which consisted of the 27th, 61st, and 63rd Construction Battalions and the 17th Special Battalion, which arrived between 25 and 30 March, and the 77th Construction Battalion which arrived on 14 April. The 27th built a PT boat base, an LCT floating drydock and slipway, and roads. The 61st constructed housing, ammunition storage facilities, a runway, and some of the buildings at the PT boat base. It also handled sawmill operations. The 63rd assisted at the sawmill and worked on the roads, camps, harbor facilities, warehouses, magazines and avgas dumps. The 77th built taxiways, hardstands, aviation workshops and the avgas tank farm. The 88th worked on runways, roads, radar stations and a causeway at the eastern end of the island. Two airfields were constructed, Inshore and North Cape. These were heavy bomber strips, long and wide. The former had parking for 210 fighters or light bombers; the latter for 84 heavy bombers. Both were fully equipped with towers, lighting, and a dispensary. The aviation tank farm consisted of three and nineteen tanks together with the appropriate filling and distribution points. A reserve of was stored in drums. Three hospitals were established, a 100-bed naval base hospital, the 160-bed 24th Army Field Hospital, and the 150-bed Acorn 7 Hospital. The anchorage at Hamburg Bay could accommodate up to five capital ships. Port facilities included eight cranes, of refrigerated space, and of covered storage. The port could handle of cargo per day. Connecting the various facilities was of coral-surfaced all-weather road. All this work was completed by August and Construction Battalion Maintenance Unit (CBMU) 502 assumed responsibility for maintenance work. All the construction battalions departed by December. Garrison The 4th Marines were relieved as the garrison of Emirau by the 147th Infantry on 11 April 1944. The next day, General Noble was replaced as island commander by a marine aviator, Major General James T. Moore, the Commanding General of the 1st Marine Aircraft Wing.Shaw and Kane, Isolation of Rabaul, p. 523 In turn, the 147th Infantry was relieved as garrison by the 369th Infantry in June.Lee, The Employment of Negro Troops, p. 524 In August, General MacArthur directed that responsibility for garrisoning Emirau would be transferred to the Australian Army.Long, The Final Campaigns, p. 93 The Australian 8th Infantry Battalion arrived to take over the garrison role on Emirau on 30 September.War Diary, 23rd Infantry Brigade, 30 September 1944, AWM52 8/2/3 They were met by a small ANGAU detachment that had been on the island since May.Powell, The Third Force, pp. 132-133 Marine Aircraft Group 12 operated from Emirau until December, when it moved to Leyte, its place was taken by squadrons of the RNZAF.Shaw and Kane, Isolation of Rabaul, p. 533 On 20 March 1945, General MacArthur authorized a reduction in the garrison size to one company of the 8th Infantry Battalion.

Released on November 14, 1995, it serves as a companion album to the band's previous compilation, Collection I. Both compilations collect all the early singles and the entire Earth A.D./Wolfs Blood album, and are meant to complement Walk Among Us (not represented because Warner Bros. owns the rights) and Legacy of Brutality with little overlap. All the early singles are supposed to be represented, although alternative versions of some songs are used instead of the original releases.  Album information  Misfits II is controversial among fans because six of the tracks are not songs the Misfits recorded as a functioning band. They were recorded in 1986, several years after the Misfits broke up, by Glenn Danzig and Samhain bassist Eerie Von for a sequel to Walk Among Us. \\"Cough/Cool\\" uses the drum track of the original Misfits version, but Danzig overdubbed guitar and drum machine tracks and new vocals. The song originally had no guitar at all, and was recorded when the Misfits were a three-piece of keyboards, bass and drums. The four Walk Among Us-era tracks (\\"Hate Breeders\\", \\"Braineaters\\", \\"Nike-A-Go-Go\\", and \\"Devil's Whorehouse\\") included on Collection II were also recorded during the same sessions, and featured no participation by any other Misfits. Jerry Only is adamant that \\"Braineaters\\" was recorded only once by the Misfits. \\"Mephisto Waltz\\" was rehearsed by the Misfits but never recorded by the band. \\"We Are 138\\" and \\"Attitude\\" are the tracks from the Bullet EP that were not present on Collection I. There is very little difference between these and the mixes on the Static Age LP. \\"Last Caress\\" is from the Beware EP. This mix, exclusive to this compilation and not included on the box set, is characterized by its use of reverb and more prominent guitar. \\"Return of the Fly\\" is a song recorded at the same time as the above three during the Static Age sessions, but had previously only been available via bootlegs. \\"Children in Heat\\" is taken from the Horror Business EP. It was originally conceived as the second part of a medley with \\"Teenagers From Mars,\\" and was mixed together with that song for the Horror Business EP. The engineer's introduction at the beginning of \\"Teenagers from Mars,\\" announcing the take, mentions both songs. For the Beware EP, the intro was kept, even though \\"Children in Heat\\" was replaced by \\"Last Caress\\". The intro was also kept for Collection I, even though \\"Children in Heat\\" was nowhere to be found. \\"Rat Fink\\" is taken from the Night of the Living Dead EP, and is the only song on the EP to appear on this record or on Collection I. (the other two tracks on the EP can only be found on CD3 of the Box Set). \\"Rat Fink \\" is also the only cover (by Allan Sherman) the Misfits ever recorded. \\"Horror Hotel\\" is the final 3 Hits from Hell track re-released to CD. \\"Halloween\\" and \\"Halloween II\\" are taken from the Halloween 7-inch. These tracks are alternate versions of the tracks included on Legacy of Brutality and the aborted 12 Hits From Hell album. Unlike songs such as \\"Horror Hotel\\", \\"Halloween\\" and \\"Halloween II\\" do not reference the movies of the same name. Instead, they point to the darker pagan undertones Danzig would pursue later with Samhain. \\"We Bite\\" is taken from the Die, Die My Darling single, which is also included on the Earth A.D. CD. \\"Queen Wasp,\\" \\"Demonomania,\\" \\"Hellhound,\\" and \\"Bloodfeast\\" are the remaining Earth A.D. tracks not included in Collection I.

A rundown, informally known as a pickle or the hotbox, is a situation in the game of baseball that occurs when the baserunner is stranded between two bases, also known as no-man's land, and is in jeopardy of being tagged out. When the base runner attempts to advance to the next base, he is cut off by the defensive player who has a live ball and attempts to return to his previous base before being tagged out. As he is doing this, the defenseman throws the ball past the base runner to the previous base, forcing him to reverse directions again. This is repeated until the runner is put out or reaches a base safely. A rundown can be escaped if a fielder makes an error, the runner gets around the fielder with the ball without running out of the baseline, a fielder throws the ball elsewhere (e.g., toward home plate if another runner is trying to score), or the runner manages to get by the fielder without the ball while there is no other fielder to cover the runner's destination base.

He is a contributing editor to The Nation. He wrote the popular \\"Dissonance\\" column for LA Weekly from 2001 until November 2008. His writing has also appeared in such publications as the Los Angeles Times, The Atlantic Monthly, Harper's Magazine, The New Yorker, The Christian Science Monitor, Playboy and Rolling Stone. His translated work has been published in various European and Latin American publications, including the French daily Liberation and the Mexico City-based dailies La Jornada and Uno Mas Uno. He has also been a television producer for PBS, CBS News, and The Christian Science Monitor. His radio reports have aired on NBC, Canadian Broadcasting Corporation and the BBC. During the 2008 presidential campaign he worked as editorial coordinator of The Huffington Posts citizen-journalism project OffTheBus as well as a senior editor of the overall site. Early life Cooper was born in and grew up in Los Angeles. His career in journalism began in 1966 when he founded and edited an underground newspaper at Fairfax High School in Los Angeles, California. In 1971, he was expelled from the California State University system for his antiwar activism by order of Governor Ronald Reagan. In Chile From 1971 to 1973, Cooper served as the Spanish-English translator for Chilean Socialist president Salvador Allende. Following the military coup of 1973, he fled the country, fearing execution as a participant in the Allende government;Cooper, Marc. Pinochet and Me: A Chilean Anti-Memoir. Verso, 2001, p. 39. some of his American friends were executed by the military, including journalist Charles Horman. In 2002 he testified before a Chilean magistrate in the investigation of Horman's death. Radio From 1980 to 1983, Cooper was the news and public affairs director of Pacifica station KPFK-FM, Los Angeles. Between 1995 and 2005 he served as the principal host and executive producer of Radio Nation, a weekly syndicated one-hour production of The Nation Institute, featuring writers and editors from The Nation magazine. Cooper anchored the program from its inception in 1995 until he relinquished the post in 2006. Between 1998 and 2001, he also hosted a daily KPFK talk show, ultimately resigning amid disagreements with a dissident group that gained control of the station's parent, the Pacifica Foundation. At its peak, Radio Nation was heard on more than 100 public and community radio stations. Journalism In spring 2006, Cooper was appointed a full-time member of the journalism faculty at the USC Annenberg School for Communication for the academic year 2006‚Äì2007. He had taught the previous five years as an adjunct. He was also promoted to the post of associate director at Annenberg's Institute for Justice and Journalism. In late 2008, Cooper was also named director of Annenberg Digital News and its online publication Neon Tommy. In 2010 he was promoted to Associate Professor of Professional Practice. He also coordinates the USC Annenberg News21 fellowship which is part of a national Carnegie-Knight initiative for developing innovative journalism. His journalism prizes include awards from the Society of Professional Journalists, the Armstrong Memorial Foundation, the Sidney Hillman Foundation, the California Associated Press TV and Radio Association, the California Newspaper Publishers Association, the Best in the West, Project Censored, PEN American Center, and the Greater Los Angeles Press Club. He began his own daily blog in 2004. Since May 2005 he has been a contributing blogger at The Huffington Post. During the 2008 campaign he served as a senior editor of the site and also worked as editorial director of its OffTheBus citizen journalism reporting project. The same year he joined the advisory board of Pajamas Media, a weblog-related company. As of July 2007, Cooper is no longer affiliated with Pajamas Media. He left The Huffington Post in December 2008. He is married to Chilean writer and teacher Patricia Vargas- Cooper and has one adult daughter, Natasha Vargas-Cooper, who studied at UCLA. She graduated in May 2007 and is now a writer and journalist. Her book Mad Men Unbuttoned: A Romp Through America of the 60's was published by Harper Collins in 2010. Controversial views Although Cooper espouses many traditional leftist positions, he also criticizes some of his fellow leftists for what he says is a kneejerk and irrational tendency to support \\"unworthy\\" and marginal causes. He ruffled many ideological allies by his criticism of Mumia Abu- Jamal, whom he famously dismissed as \\"a bad choice for poster-boy of the anti- death penalty movement.\\"What's Mumia Got to Do With It? Cooper also disparaged Ward Churchill, calling him a \\"guaranteed loser\\" who was \\"an irrelevant and clearly deranged loner on the edge of the looniest left.\\" Cooper was vocal in his opposition to the 2003 invasion of Iraq and the subsequent occupation, but he has been scathingly critical of other leftist opponents to the war, such as Canadian journalist Naomi Klein, who he lambasted as a \\"friend\\" and \\"apologist\\" for prominent Iraqi Shiite Islamist Muqtada al-Sadr in response to a piece she wrote for the September 13, 2004 edition of The Nation. Cooper has also been harshly critical of Venezuelan president Hugo Ch√°vez, whom he regards as a \\"thug,\\" and very supportive of the Ukrainian Orange Revolution in 2004. Over the past few years Cooper has sharply criticized the Cuban government for its crackdown on internal dissidents‚Äîsome of whom have been handed stiff sentences for receiving funds and instructions from the United States. Cooper has helped write and circulate international letters of protest defending the locked-up dissidents. He has described his current political position as \\"contrarian\\" and declares himself \\"agnostic\\" on grand ideological schemes. Cooper has published three books: Roll Over Che Guevara: Travels of a Radical Reporter (1994), an anthology of his journalistic pieces,Pinochet and Me: A Chilean Anti Memoir (2001) which was an L.A.

It is commonly known as card√≥n, a name derived from the Spanish word cardo, meaning \\"thistle\\". Large stands of this cactus still exist, but many have been destroyed as land has been cleared for cultivation in Sonora. The fruit of this cactus was an important food for the Seri people in Sonora, who call the cactus xaasj.* The flesh of this cactus contains alkaloids, and may have been used as a psychoactive plant in Mexico. A symbiotic relationship with bacterial and fungal colonies on its roots allows P. pringlei to grow on bare rock even where no soil is available at all, as the bacteria can fix nitrogen from the air and break down the rock to produce nutrients. The cactus even packages symbiotic bacteria in with its seeds. Morphology A cardon specimen is the tallest living cactus in the world, with a maximum recorded height of , with a stout trunk up to in diameter bearing several erect branches. In overall appearance, it resembles the related saguaro (Carnegiea gigantea), but differs in being more heavily branched and having branching nearer the base of the stem, fewer ribs on the stems, blossoms located lower along the stem, differences in areoles and spination, and spinier fruit. Its flowers are white, large, nocturnal, and appear along the ribs as opposed to only apices of the stems. Lifespan and growth An average mature cardon may reach a height of , but individuals as tall as are known.(Le√≥n de la Luz and Valiente 1994). It is a slow-growing plant (Roberts, 1989) with a lifespan measured in hundreds of years, but growth can be significantly enhanced in its initial stages by inoculation with plant growth-promoting bacteria such as Azospirillum species.(Bashan et al., 1999Carrillo et al., 2000Puente and Bashan, 1993 Most adult cardon have several side branches that may be as massive as the trunk. The resulting tree may attain a weight of 25 tons.(Gibson and Nobel, 1986).

The geographic coordinates representing locations often vary greatly in positional accuracy. Examples include building centroids, land parcel centroids, interpolated locations based on thoroughfare ranges, street segments centroids, postal code centroids (e.g. ZIP codes, CEDEX), and Administrative division Centroids.  History  Geocoding ‚Äì a subset of Geographic Information System (GIS) spatial analysis ‚Äì has been a subject of interest since the early 1960s.  1960s  In 1960, the first operational GIS ‚Äì named the Canada Geographic Information System (CGIS) ‚Äì was invented by Dr. Roger Tomlinson, who has since been acknowledged as the father of GIS. The CGIS was used to store and analyze data collected for the Canada Land Inventory, which mapped information about agriculture, wildlife, and forestry at a scale of 1:50,000, in order to regulate land capability for rural Canada. However, the CGIS lasted until the 1990s and was never available commercially. On 1 July 1963, five-digit ZIP codes were introduced nationwide by the United States Post Office Department (USPOD). In 1983, nine-digit ZIP+4 codes were brought about as an extra identifier in more accurately locating addresses. In 1964, the Harvard Laboratory for Computer Graphics and Spatial Analysis developed groundbreaking software code ‚Äì e.g. GRID, and SYMAP ‚Äì all of which were sources for commercial development of GIS. In 1967, a team at the Census Bureau ‚Äì including the mathematician James Corbett and Donald Cooke ‚Äì invented Dual Independent Map Encoding (DIME) ‚Äì the first modern vector mapping model ‚Äì which ciphered address ranges into street network files and incorporated the \\"percent along\\" geocoding algorithm. Still in use by platforms such as Google Maps and MapQuest, the \\"percent along\\" algorithm denotes where a matched address is located along a reference feature as a percentage of the reference feature's total length. DIME was intended for the use of the United States Census Bureau, and it involved accurately mapping block faces, digitizing nodes representing street intersections, and forming spatial relationships. New Haven, Connecticut was the first city on Earth with a geocodable streets network database.  1980s  In the late 1970s, two main public domain geocoding platforms were in development: GRASS GIS and MOSS. The early 1980s saw the rise of many more commercial vendors of geocoding software, namely Intergraph, ESRI, CARIS, ERDAS, and MapInfo Corporation. These platforms merged the 1960s approach of separating spatial information with the approach of organizing this spatial information into database structures. In 1986, Mapping Display and Analysis System (MIDAS) became the first desktop geocoding software, designed for the DOS operating system. Geocoding was elevated from the research department into the business world with the acquisition of MIDAS by MapInfo. MapInfo has since been acquired by Pitney Bowes, and has pioneered in merging geocoding with business intelligence; allowing location intelligence to provide solutions for the public and private sectors.  1990s  The end of the 20th century had seen geocoding become more user- oriented, especially via open-source GIS software. Mapping applications and geospatial data had become more accessible over the Internet. Because the mail-out/mail-back technique was so successful in the 1980 Census, the U.S. Bureau of Census was able to put together a large geospatial database, using interpolated street geocoding. This database ‚Äì along with the Census' nationwide coverage of households ‚Äì allowed for the birth of TIGER (Topologically Integrated Geographic Encoding and Referencing). Containing address ranges instead of individual addresses, TIGER has since been implemented in nearly all geocoding software platforms used today. By the end of the 1990 Census, TIGER \\"contained a latitude/longitude-coordinate for more than 30 million feature intersections and endpoints and nearly 145 million feature 'shape' points that defined the more than 42 million feature segments that outlined more than 12 million polygons.\\" TIGER was the breakthrough for \\"big data\\" geospatial solutions.  2000s  The early 2000s saw the rise of Coding Accuracy Support System (CASS) address standardization. The CASS certification is offered to all software vendors and advertising mailers who want the United States Postal Services (USPS) to assess the quality of their address-standardizing software. The annually renewed CASS certification is based on delivery point codes, ZIP codes, and ZIP+4 codes. Adoption of a CASS certified software by software vendors allows them to receive discounts in bulk mailing and shipping costs. They can benefit from increased accuracy and efficiency in those bulk mailings, after having a certified database. In the early 2000s, geocoding platforms were also able to support multiple datasets. In 2003, geocoding platforms were capable of merging postal codes with street data, updated monthly. This process became known as \\"conflation\\". Beginning in 2005, geocoding platforms included parcel-centroid geocoding. Parcel-centroid geocoding allowed for a lot of precision in geocoding an address. For example, parcel-centroid allowed a geocoder to determine the centroid of a specific building or lot of land. Platforms were now also able to determine the elevation of specific parcels. 2005 also saw the introduction of the Assessor's Parcel Number (APN). A jurisdiction's tax assessor was able to assign this number to parcels of real estate. This allowed for proper identification and record-keeping. An APN is important for geocoding an area which is covered by a gas or oil lease, and indexing property tax information provided to the public. In 2006, Reverse Geocoding and reverse APN lookup were introduced to geocoding platforms. This involved geocoding a numerical point location ‚Äì with a longitude and latitude ‚Äì to a textual, readable address. 2008 and 2009 saw the growth of interactive, user-oriented geocoding platforms ‚Äì namely MapQuest, Google Maps, Bing Maps, and Global Positioning Systems (GPS). These platforms were made even more accessible to the public with the simultaneous growth of the mobile industry, specifically smartphones.  2010s  The 2010s saw vendors fully support geocoding and reverse geocoding globally. Cloud-based geocoding application programming interface (API) and on-premises geocoding have allowed for a greater match rate, greater precision, and greater speed. There is now a popularity in the idea of geocoding being able to influence business decisions. This is the integration between the geocoding process and business intelligence. The future of geocoding also involves three-dimensional geocoding, indoor geocoding, and multiple language returns for the geocoding platforms.  Geocoding process  Geocoding is a task which involves multiple datasets and processes, all of which work together. A geocoder is made of two important components: a reference dataset and the geocoding algorithm. Each of these components are made up of sub-operations and sub-components. Without understanding how these geocoding processes work, it is difficult to make informed business decisions based on geocoding.  Input data  Input data are the descriptive, textual information (address or building name) which the user wants to turn into numerical, spatial data (latitude and longitude) ‚Äì through the process of geocoding. = Classification of input data = Input data is classified into two categories: relative input data and absolute input data.  Relative input data  Relative input data are the textual descriptions of a location which, alone, cannot output a spatial representation of that location. Such data outputs a relative geocode, which is dependent and geographically relative of other reference locations. An example of a relative geocode is address-interpolation using areal units or line vectors. \\"Across the street from the Empire State Building\\" is an example of a relative input data. The location being sought cannot be determined without identifying the Empire State Building. Geocoding platforms often do not support such relative locations, but advances are being made in this direction.  Absolute input data  Absolute input data are the textual descriptions of a location which, alone, can output a spatial representation of that location. This data type outputs an absolute known location independently of other locations. For example, USPS ZIP codes; USPS ZIP+4 codes; complete and partial postal addresses; USPS PO boxes; rural routes; cities; counties; intersections; and named places can all be referenced in a data source absolutely. When there is a lot of variability in the way addresses can be represented ‚Äì such as too much input data or too little input data ‚Äì geocoders use address normalization and address standardization in order to resolve this problem. Address interpolation A simple method of geocoding is address interpolation. This method makes use of data from a street geographic information system where the street network is already mapped within the geographic coordinate space. Each street segment is attributed with address ranges (e.g. house numbers from one segment to the next). Geocoding takes an address, matches it to a street and specific segment (such as a block, in towns that use the \\"block\\" convention). Geocoding then interpolates the position of the address, within the range along the segment. Example Take for example: 742 Evergreen Terrace Let's say that this segment (for instance, a block) of Evergreen Terrace runs from 700 to 799. Even-numbered addresses fall on the east side of Evergreen Terrace, with odd-numbered addresses on the west side of the street. 742 Evergreen Terrace would (probably) be located slightly less than halfway up the block, on the east side of the street. A point would be mapped at that location along the street, perhaps offset a distance to the east of the street centerline.  Complicating factors  However, this process is not always as straightforward as in this example. Difficulties arise when * distinguishing between ambiguous addresses such as 742 Evergreen Terrace and 742 W Evergreen Terrace. * attempting to geocode new addresses for a street that is not yet added to the geographic information system database. While there might be a 742 Evergreen Terrace in Springfield, there might also be a 742 Evergreen Terrace in Shelbyville. Asking for the city name (and state, province, country, etc. as needed) can solve this problem. Boston, MassachusettsGoogle Maps has multiple \\"100 Washington Street\\" locations because several cities have been annexed without changing street names, thus requiring use of unique postal codes or district names for disambiguation. Geocoding accuracy can be greatly improved by first utilizing good address verification practices. Address verification will confirm the existence of the address and will eliminate ambiguities. Once the valid address is determined, it is very easy to geocode and determine the latitude/longitude coordinates. Finally, several caveats on using interpolation: * The typical attribution of a street segment assumes that all even numbered parcels are on one side of the segment, and all odd numbered parcels are on the other. This is often not true in real life. * Interpolation assumes that the given parcels are evenly distributed along the length of the segment. This is almost never true in real life; it is not uncommon for a geocoded address to be off by several thousand feet. * Interpolation also assumes that the street is straight. If a street is curved then the geocoded location will not necessarily fit the physical location of the address. * Segment Information (esp. from sources such as TIGER) includes a maximum upper bound for addresses and is interpolated as though the full address range is used. For example, a segment (block) might have a listed range of 100‚Äì199, but the last address at the end of the block is 110. In this case, address 110 would be geocoded to 10% of the distance down the segment rather than near the end. * Most interpolation implementations will produce a point as their resulting address location. In reality, the physical address is distributed along the length of the segment, i.e. consider geocoding the address of a shopping mall ‚Äì the physical lot may run a distance along the street segment (or could be thought of as a two- dimensional space-filling polygon which may front on several different streets ‚Äî or worse, for cities with multi-level streets, a three-dimensional shape that meets different streets at several different levels) but the interpolation treats it as a singularity. A very common error is to believe the accuracy ratings of a given map's geocodable attributes. Such accuracy as quoted by vendors has no bearing on an address being attributed to the correct segment or to the correct side of the segment, nor resulting in an accurate position along that correct segment. With the geocoding process used for U.S. Census TIGER datasets, 5‚Äì7.5% of the addresses may be allocated to a different census tract, while a study of Australia's TIGER-like system found that 50% of the geocoded points were mapped to the wrong property parcel. The accuracy of geocoded data can also have a bearing on the quality of research that uses this data. One study by a group of Iowa researchers found that the common method of geocoding using TIGER datasets as described above, can cause a loss of as much as 40% of the power of a statistical analysis. An alternative is to use orthophoto or image coded data such as the Address Point data from Ordnance Survey in the UK, but such datasets are generally expensive. Because of this, it is quite important to avoid using interpolated results except for non-critical applications. Interpolated geocoding is usually not appropriate for making authoritative decisions, for example if life safety will be affected by that decision. Emergency services, for example, do not make an authoritative decision based on their interpolations; an ambulance or fire truck will always be dispatched regardless of what the map says. Other techniques In rural areas or other places lacking high quality street network data and addressing, GPS is useful for mapping a location. For traffic accidents, geocoding to a street intersection or midpoint along a street centerline is a suitable technique. Most highways in developed countries have mile markers to aid in emergency response, maintenance, and navigation. It is also possible to use a combination of these geocoding techniques ‚Äî using a particular technique for certain cases and situations and other techniques for other cases. In contrast to geocoding of structured postal address records, toponym resolution maps place names in unstructured document collections to their corresponding spatial footprints. Place codes offer a new way to create digitally generated addresses where no information exists using satellite imagery and machine learning, e.g., Robocodes Research Research has introduced a new approach to the control and knowledge aspects of geocoding, by using an agent-based paradigm. In addition to the new paradigm for geocoding, additional correction techniques and control algorithms have been developed.An Agent-Based Framework to Enable Intelligent Geocoding Services The approach represents the geographic elements commonly found in addresses as individual agents. This provides a commonality and duality to control and geographic representation. In addition to scientific publication, the new approach and subsequent prototype gained national media coverage in Australia. The research was conducted at Curtin University in Perth, Western Australia. Uses Geocoded locations are useful in many GIS analysis, cartography, decision making workflow, transaction mash-up, or injected into larger business processes. On the web, geocoding is used in services like routing and local search. Geocoding, along with GPS provides location data for geotagging media, such as photographs or RSS items. Privacy concerns The proliferation and ease of access to geocoding (and reverse-geocoding) services raises privacy concerns. For example, in mapping crime incidents, law enforcement agencies aim to balance the privacy rights of victims and offenders, with the public's right to know. Law enforcement agencies have experimented with alternative geocoding techniques that allow them to mask a portion of the locational detail (e.g., address specifics that would lead to identifying a victim or offender). As well, in providing online crime mapping to the public, they also place disclaimers regarding the locational accuracy of points on the map, acknowledging these location masking techniques, and impose terms of use for the information.

Delville was the leading exponent of the Belgian Idealist movement in art during the 1890s. He held, throughout his life, the belief that art should be the expression of a higher spiritual truth and that it should be based on the principle of Ideal, or spiritual Beauty. He executed a great number of paintings during his active career from 1887 to the end of the second World War (many now lost or destroyed) expressing his Idealist aesthetic. Delville was trained at the Acad√©mie des Beaux-arts in Brussels and proved to be a highly precocious student, winning most of the prestigious competition prizes at the Academy while still a young student. He later won the Belgian Prix de Rome which allowed him to travel to Rome and Florence and study at first hand the works of the artists of the Renaissance. During his time in Italy he created his celebrated masterpiece L'Ecole de Platon (1898), which stands as a visual summary of his Idealist aesthetic which he promoted during the 1890s in his writings, poetry and exhibitions societies, notably the Salons d'Art Id√©aliste. Characteristically, Delville's paintings are idea-based, expressing philosophical ideals derived from contemporary hermetic and esoteric traditions. At the start of his career, his esoteric perspective was mostly influenced by the work of Eliphas Levi, Edouard Schur√©, Jos√©phin P√©ladan and Saint-Yves d'Alveydre, and later by the Theosophical writings of Helena Blavatsky and Annie Besant. The main underlying theme of his paintings, especially during his early career, has to do with initiation and the transfiguration of the inner life of the soul towards a higher spiritual purpose. Specifically they deal with themes symbolising Ideal love, death and transfiguration as well as representations of Initiates ('light bringers'), and the relationship between the material and metaphysical dimensions. His paintings and finished drawings are an expression of a highly sensitive visionary imagination articulated through precisely observed forms drawn from nature. He also had a brilliant gift for colour and composition and excelled in the representation of human anatomy. Many of his major paintings, such as his Les Tr√©sors de Sathan (1895), l'Homme-Dieu (1903) and Les Ames errantes (1942), represent dozens of figures intertwined in complex arrangements and painted with highly detailed anatomical accuracy. He was an astonishingly skilled draughtsman and painter capable of producing highly expressive works on a grand scale, many of which can be seen in public buildings in Brussels, including the Palais de Justice. Delville's artistic style is strongly influenced by the Classical tradition. He was a lifelong advocate of the value of the Classical training taught in the Academies. He believed that the discipline acquired as a result of this training was not an end in itself, but rather a valuable means of acquiring a solid drawing and painting technique to allow artists freely to develop their personal artistic style, without inhibiting their individual creative personality. Delville was a respected Academic art teacher. He was employed at the Glasgow School of Art from 1900 to 1906 and as Professor of drawing at the Acad√©mie des Beaux-arts in Brussels thereafter until 1937. He was also a prolific and talented author. He published a very great number of journal articles during his lifetime as well as four volumes of poetry, including his Le Frisson du Sphinx (1897) and Les Splendeurs M√©connues (1922). He authored more than a dozen books and pamphlets relating to art and esoteric subjects. The most important of his published books include his esoteric works, Dialogue entre Nous (1895) and Le Christ Reviendra (1913) as well as his seminal work on Idealist art, La Mission de l'Art (1900). He also created and edited several contemporary journals and newspapers during the 1890s promoting his Idealist aesthetic including L'Art Id√©aliste and La Lumi√®re. Delville was an energetic artistic entrepreneur, creating several influential artistic exhibition societies, including Pour l'Art and the Salons de l'Art Id√©aliste in the 1890s and later, the Soci√©t√© de l'Art Monumental in the 1920s which was responsible for the decoration of public buildings including the mosaics in the hemicycle of the Cinquantenaire in Brussels. He also founded the very successful Coop√©rative artistique, which provided affordable art materials for artists at the time. Early years and training Delville was born on 19 January 1867 at 2.00 a.m., rue des Dominicains in Louvain. He was born illegitimate into a working class household. His mother was Barbe Libert (1833‚Äì1905), the daughter of a canal worker who earned a living as a 'journali√®re' as an adult. Delville never knew his father Joachim Thibault who was a lecturer in Latin and Greek at a local college and who came from a bourgeoisie family. He bore his mother's name until she married a functionary working in Louvain, Victor Delville (1840‚Äì1918). Victor adopted Jean who, until then, was known as Jean Libert. The family moved to Brussels in 1870 and settled in Boulevard Waterloo near Porte de Hal. The Delville family later moved to St Gilles where Delville began his schooling at the Ecole Communale in rue du Fort. Delville took an early interest in drawing, even though his initial career ambitions were to become a Doctor. He was introduced to the artist Sti√©venart by his adoptive grandfather, Fran√ßois Delville, while still a young boy. Delville recalls that this was 'the first artist I had ever seen, and for me, as a child, still unaware of my vocation, this was an enchanting experience.'Quoted in Armand Eggermont, 'Jean Delville. Peintre de la Figure et de l‚ÄôId√©e', 19 janvier 1867-19 janvier 1953, Le Thyrse, IVe s√©rie, no. 4 (1 April 1953), p. 152. At the age of twelve, Delville entered the famous Ath√©n√©e Royale in Brussels. His interest in art developed around this time and he received his father's permission to enroll in evening drawing classes at the Acad√©mie des Beaux-arts in the rue du Midi in 1879. He entered the course for drawing 'apr√®s la t√™te antique' (after the classical head) and in 1882 classes for drawing 'apr√®s le torse et figure' (after torso and face). Soon after he gave up his schooling at the Ath√©n√©e to study full-time at the Acad√©mie. In 1883, he enrolled in the 'cours de peinture d‚Äôapr√®s nature' (class in painting after nature) under the direction of the celebrated teacher Jean-Fran√ßois Portaels (1818‚Äì1895). Portaels objected to Delville's youth, but he excelled in the entrance examination and was unconditionally admitted to study painting under Portaels and Joseph Stallaert. Delville was a precocious talent and at age 17 won many of the major prizes at the Academy including 'drawing after nature', 'painting after nature', 'historical composition' (with high distinction), 'drawing after the antique', and ‚Äòfigure painting‚Äô.Miriam Delville, 'Jean Delville, mon grand-p√®re' in Laoureux, et al. Jean Delville, Ma√Ætre de l'id√©al, pp. 14ff; and Brendan Cole. Jean Delville. Art Between Nature and the Absolute. pp. 19‚Äì22. Artistic career 1887‚Äì1900=L'Essor, 1887‚Äì1891 Delville first exhibited in a public context at the moderate exhibition society called l'Essor from 1887 to 1891. His early works were largely depictions of working class -and peasant life executed in a contemporary realist style influenced by Constant Meunier. Delville's early efforts exhibited in 1887 were largely favourably reviewed in the contemporary press, notably L'Art Moderne and the Journal de Bruxelles, even if they were seen to be eclectic and derivative of the works of older established artists. These included works inspired by Baudelaire's poetry including his Frontispiece and L'√©pave (now lost) and his main work La Terre of which a detailed drawing still survives. The following year his works were singled out as among the most outstanding of the 1888 exhibitors at L'Essor. This was the year in which he exhibited his highly controversial study for his painting La M√®re depicting a woman in labour. A contemporary review described it in the following: 'On a huge bed with purple sheets ... a dishevelled standing woman displays her nudity as she writhes in spasmodic movements, bending under the pains of childbirth. Her face is contorted, her gnashing teeth alternate with the curse, her clenched hands lift the bed cover over her belly in an unconscious reflex of modesty ... abominable vision ....! and poor women!' This subject, rarely depicted in art, was seen to be shocking and contrary to bourgeois taste. It does however signal an aspect of Delville's art to depict ideas that are vivid and provocative. During the 1880s, Delville's work tended towards social realism. This included images of workers and peasants (Soir and Paysan, 1888); of beggars and destitution (Asile de nuit, 1885); of hunger (L‚ÄôAffam√©,1887) and ultimately of death (Le Dernier Sommeil, 1888). Here he focussed on themes of poverty, despair and hopelessness. In an undated drawing titled Le las d‚ÄôAller Delville depicts a fallen figure curled up on his side in a barren landscape, asleep, or perhaps even dead. However, during the period 1888-9 his artistic interests started developing in a more non-realist direction and began to move towards Idealism which dominated his work from then on. This was first indicated in his Fragment d‚Äôune composition: Le cycle de la passion (now lost) displayed at L'Essor in 1889. The final work Le Cycle passionnel (9 √ó 6 metres) was displayed at L'Essor the following year (1890) and was inspired by Dante's Divine Comedy. It depicts a vast composition of intertwined figures floating through the nether regions of hell. The theme concerns lovers who have succumbed to their erotic passions. One of the main themes of initiation is to control one's lower passions in order to achieve spiritual transcendence. This painting of this work represents this idea in metaphoric form. This is an early major work by Delville sadly destroyed in the incendiary attack on Louvain in 1914. Despite its importance, it was not received with much enthusiasm in the contemporary press. Another work that display Delville's growing interest in non-realist ideas during the 1880s is his more well-knownTristan et Yseult (Royal Museums of Fine Art, Brussels, 1887). The work is inspired by Wagner's eponymous opera and deals with the relationship between love and death and the idea of transcendence that can be achieved through both. It is an early work that reveals themes closely related to the initiatory tradition which is fully discussed in Brendan Cole's recent book on Delville. A further important work dealing with non-realist, or Idealist, subject matter was exhibited by Delville at the final L'Essor exhibition in 1891 titled La Symbolisation de la chair et de l'√©sprit (the original is lost, but a detailed study recently came up for auction). It depicts a naked female figure dragging a nude male beath the water. Bright light appears above the male figure while dark sub-aquatic vegetation surrounds the base of the female. The initiatory theme here is self-evident in its depiction of the conflict between spirit (light) and matter (dark vegetation). The male aspires towards the light but is dragged down towards the bottom of the dark mass of water. The work establishes an essential duality between consciousness/unconsciousness, light/dark, as well as spirituality and materialism. In Delville's writings he emphasises this duality and its reconciliation; a theme that pervades much of Symbolist art and writings and was conspicuous amongst Romantic artists as well, especially the writings of Goethe. The theme dominates Delville's art. He wrote that: > 'Men have two very distinct trends in them. One of these two trends is > physical, which must, of course, provide for his preservation by physical > means, having the task of sustaining tangible life, sustaining the body. The > other trend, which is not only immaterial but indefinable, is that which > arises as a perpetual aspiration beyond the material, for which this world > is not enough: it is this 'something else' that overcomes all distances or > is, rather, unknowable. This is the very threshold of the occult world, in > front of which all science, seized with unsteadiness, prostrates itself in > the insuperable premonition of a world beyond!'Jean Delville, 'Conf√©rence > sur 'Comment on Devient Mage\\" du Sar M√©rodack J. P√©ladan', Le Mouvement > Litt√©raire, 45 (8 D√©cembre 1893), p. 357. Pour L'Art 1892‚Äì1895 Delville's growing interest in Idealist art led him to instigate a succession from L'Essor to start a new exhibition society called Pour L'Art. Many of the younger artists of L'Essor followed him which led to the dissolution of that group. Pour L'Art became one of the noted avant-garde exhibition societies on Brussels at the time. The leading avant- garde exhibition forum at the time was Les XX. Following Les XX, Pour L'Art invited international artists as well, several of whom became well known in Symbolist circles, including Carlos Schwabe, Alexandre S√©on, Chales Filiger and Jan Verkade. Their first exhibition took place in November 1892 and the works displayed were executed in either an Impressionist or Symbolist idiom. Delville designed the poster for the first exhibition depicting a long-necked sphinx ‚Äì a key symbol of the period ‚Äì cupping a flaming chalice in her hands. Delville's main work of that year was his L'Idole de la Perversit√© which can be considered one of the major images of the period. The new group received a largely positive press during the time. The group was closely associated with Jos√©phin P√©ladan's Salons de la Rose+Croix in Paris, and P√©ladan was frequently invited to lecture in Brussels at the time by members of the Pour L'Art group. The second exhibition of the Pour L'Art group took place in January 1894. Significantly the society also included the applied, or decorative arts, which were become widely popular at the time and a particular feature of Art Nouveau. Tapestries, bookbindings, and wrought-iron work was displayed alongside the paintings. The influence of Delville and P√©ladan was evident in the predominance of idealist works of art influenced by late fifteenth-century Florentine art, the work of Gustav Moreau, Puvis de Chavannes and the tendency towards large-scale figure compositions. The show was enthusiastically received by the press. Delville's main works exhibited that year was his celebrated La Mort d'Orph√©e (1893, Royal Museums of Fine Art, Brussels) and his outstanding Mysteriosa or Portrait of Mrs Stuart Madame Stuart Merrill (1892, Royal Museums of Fine Art, Brussels). His work was enthusiastically praised in the press. The leading critic Ernest Verlant wrote: > One of the principal members of the Pour L‚ÄôArt group, in view of his talent > and astonishing fecundity, is Jean Delville, who is also a writer and a > poet; with a powerful imagination that is funereal and tormented. These > epithets are equally suited to his large painting La Proie, a crimson vision > of apocalyptic murder, similar to his vast composition from last year, Vers > l‚Äôinconnu, and of several before that. ‚Ä¶ Here and there, for example, in > L‚Äôhomme du glaive, the Murmure profane, and Mysteriosa, he pushes the > intensity of expression to its extreme. Elsewhere, as in Satana, he draws > together, rather bizarrely, esoteric attributes in a figure derived from da > Vinci. But we are able only to express praise in front of Orph√©e, a dead > head floating between the shafts of a large lyre; in front of Elegia, a long > and supple female body appearing under the spurting and cascading waters of > a fountain; in front of Au Loin and Maternitas, two figures pensively > leaning on their elbows, of which the first of the two has a great nobility. > These works are monochrome, or nearly so. Their expression is accurate, > fine, subtle, refined, not too explicit, and all the more eloquent.Quoted in > Cole, Jean Delville, Art between Nature and the Absolute, p. 93 The final Pour L'Art show took place in January 1895. Delville also participated for the last time in P√©ladan's Salons de la Rose+Croix. This was the year when he began preparing the formation of his own exclusively Idealist exhibition Society, the Salons d'Art Id√©aliste, which opened the following year. By this time the Pour L'Art Salons were well-established, successful and enthusiastically supported by the contemporary press. Delville's L'Ange des splendeurs (1894, Royal Museums of Fine Art, Brussels), was Delville's main work of that show. Although not widely praised it stands, according to Brendan Cole, as one of his initiatory paintings par excellence of Delville's oeuvreCole, Jean Delville, p. 291.  Delville and P√©ladan's Salons de la Rose+Croix 1892‚Äì1895 Delville exhibited at Jos√©phin P√©ladan's Rosicrucian Salons for the first four years of their existence (1892‚Äì5), which coincided with his own Pour l'Art Salons. At this time Delville was closely allied to P√©ladan and his ideals. Delville probably met P√©ladan in Paris when he accompanied one of the touring exhibitions of L'Essor, around 1888.According to Michel Draguet; see Draguet, Id√©e, Idea, Id√©alisme: Figure du Mythe', in Michel Draguet (ed.), Splendeurs de l‚ÄôId√©al. Rops, Khnopff, Delville et leur temps. Li√®ge: Mus√©e de l‚ÄôArt wallon, du 17 octobre d√©cembre 1997, p. 61. Delville shared P√©ladan's concept of creating a forum that showcased art of an exclusively Idealist persuasion. Delville sought to bring Idealist art into the public eye in Belgium through the Pour l'Art salons, but more specifically in the Salons d'Art Id√©alist which he founded in 1895 and opened to the public in 1896. By 1896, Delville began severing formal ties with P√©ladan, which cleared the way for his move towards Theosophy later that decade. Delville records his association with P√©ladan in his autobiography: '... my personality as an idealist painter emerged more and more. I made the acquaintance of P√©ladan and became interested in and started participating in the esoteric movement in Paris and Brussels. I exhibited at the Rosicrucian Salon where only idealist art was allowed. P√©ladan exhibited several of my works there, notably La Mort d‚ÄôOrph√©e which he placed at the centre of the exhibition, along with La chair et l‚Äôesprit and some drawings. Under his influence, I went to live in Paris where I stayed on the Quai Bourbon among some Rosicrucian friends, disciples of P√©ladan. I stayed there for several months occupying my time not only with the organization of the P√©ladanesque salons, but also in painting the set of Babylone which was an overall success'Delville, Autobiographie, Archives d‚ÄôArt contemporaine Belgique (AACB), 23792/1-4 5‚Äì8.' p. 2. Delville is probably referring to the Salon Rose+Croix of 1893 ‚Äì the year P√©ladan staged his play Babylone in Paris, in April during the Rose+Croix Salon of that year) In 1892 Delville exhibited his La symbolisation de la chair et de l‚Äôesprit (which was reproduced in the catalogue to the first exhibition) as well as his l‚ÄôIdole de la Perversit√©. In 1893 he exhibited eight works including his Imperia, √âlegia, La symbolisation de la chair et de l‚Äôesprit, L‚ÄôAnnonciateur, Le Murmure profane, Mysteriosa, Vers l‚ÄôInconnu, and L‚ÄôHomme de Glaive. In 1894 he exhibited seven works including: La Mort d‚ÄôOrph√©e, La Fin d‚Äôun r√®gne, Le Geste d‚ÄôAme, Satana, Maternitas, Etude f√©minine and La Tranquille. In 1895 Delville exhibited four works including his portrait of P√©ladan: Portrait du Grand Ma√Ætre de la Rose+Croix en habit de choeur and L‚ÄôAnge des splendeurs. Many of these works would be displayed in Brussels as well in Delville's Pour l'Art exhibitions.See Brendan Cole, Jean Delville. Art Between Nature and the Absolute, pp. 138‚Äì44. Prix de Rome and sojourn in Italy, 1895 Delville lived as an indigent artist in St Gilles in Brussels during the course of his early career. By the middle of the 1890s he was married and had a growing family which he struggled to support as an artist. On the advice of his close friend, the sculptor Victor Rousseau, he was motivated to enter the prestigious Prix de Rome, which came with a very generous bursary that also covered the costs for a lengthy sojourn in Italy. Delville won the 1895 competition, but his entry created a controversy amongst his peers given the 'Establishment' nature of the Prix that ran counter to the ideals of the avant-garde at the time. Delville was by then a fairly established figure in avant-garde circles and his association with the Prix de Rome appeared to be a betrayal of their cause. The Prix de Rome, however, also meant that Delville could spend a significant amount of time in Italy studying the Classical art of the Renaissance that he admired so much. The rules of the competition were stringent. Competitors were isolated in small studios in the Academy of Fine Arts in Antwerp which ran the competition and were expected to produce a finished drawing of their composition before setting to work on the final painting. A strict time-limit was imposed on competitors to finish the work. The competition opened in June 1895 and he winner was announced in October.See Miriam Delville, 'Jean Delville, mon grand-p√®re', p. 21 The theme of the competition that year was Le Christ glorifi√© par les enfants. Delville recorded his experience in his autobiography: > The rules were demanding ‚Ä¶ At that time the six selected competitors for the > final exam had to paint their work in a secluded lodge, after leaving the > original preliminary drawing in a hallway of the Antwerp Academy. It was > strictly forbidden to bring any drawings into the lodge, only live models > were allowed there. While working on their painting, the competitors had to > change their clothes each time they entered their lodge, after having been > visited by a specially appointed supervisor. These procedural requirements > were the moral guarantee of this great contest in which these artists from > the country took part‚Ä¶. As soon as they were selected, they entered into a > lodge in order to produce, over three days, the sketch of the requisite > painting, and they were given eighty days to complete it without receiving > any visitors or advice from anyone ‚Äì in order to ensure that the competitors > were the unique and personal author of the work so that the jury, composed > of the country‚Äôs most well-known artists, could cast a definitive > judgement.Delville, Autobiography, p. 3. During his stay Delville was expected to paint original works reflecting his studies of classical art as well as to make copies after the old masters. He was also expected to send regular reports back to the Antwerp Academy relating to his work there. The experience proved to be a turning point in his career and brought to focus his ideal to synthesise the classical tendency in art with his interest in esoteric philosophy which was the defining attribute of his Idealist aesthetic form then onwards. Delville produced several remarkable paintings during his time in Rome that reflect a dramatic evolution in his art towards a more refined expression of this Idealist aesthetic. These included his outstanding Orph√©e aux enfers (1896), a key initiatory work, as well as his great masterpiece of the period, his L'Ecole de Platon (1898), which he exhibited at the 1898 Salon d'Art Id√©alist to universal praise.see Cole, ibid pp. 99‚Äì113. In 1895, Delville published his first book on esoteric philosophy, Dialogue entre Nous. The Salons d'Art Id√©aliste 1896‚Äì1898 Delville's Salons D'Art Id√©aliste were exclusively devoted to exhibiting artwork of an Idealist nature. Delville signalled his programme in a series of polemical articles during the course of the months preceding the opening of the first Salon, which created some controversy amongst his contemporaries. Delville's ideas were bold and confrontational, but it was characteristic of him to stick to the courage of his convictions and to carry his projects through with relentless energy and determination. The aim of the Salons were couched in a short manifesto published before the opening of the first Salon. This is an early instance of a new avant-garde art movement supported by a manifesto; something that would be a commonplace in later Modernist movements and after. The Salons were also accompanied by a series of lectures and musical soir√©es. Delville's Salons were also significant for their inclusion of women artists, something almost unheard of in other contemporary avant garde exhibition societies. The manifesto provides a valuable record of the Idealist movement founded by Delville: > The intention of the Salons d‚ÄôArt Id√©aliste is to give rise to an aesthetic > Renaissance in Belgium. They bring together, in one annual grouping, all the > scattered elements of artistic idealism, that is to say, works with the same > leanings towards beauty. Wishing in this way to react against the decadence, > against the confusion of the so-called realist, impressionist or libriste > schools (degenerate art forms), the Salons d‚ÄôArt Id√©aliste champion the > following as eternal principles of perfection in a work of art: thought, > style, and technique. The only thing they recognize as free, within > aesthetics, is the creative personality of the artist, and maintain, in the > name of harmony, that no work is susceptible to true art unless it is > composed of the three absolute terms, namely: spiritual beauty, plastic > beauty and technical beauty. Similar, if not identical, to the Parisian Rose > & Croix Salons created by S√¢r Jos√©phin P√©ladan and to the Pre-Raphaelite > movement in London, the Salons d‚ÄôArt Id√©aliste claim to wish to continue, > through modern developments, the great tradition of idealist art, from the > ancient masters to present-day masters.'Salons d‚ÄôArt Id√©aliste', La Ligue > Artistique, nr. 23 (4 December 1895), p. 6. Delville's main work exhibited that year was his visionary Tr√©sors de Sathan (1895, Royal Museums of Fine Art, Brussels). The work had previously been on show at the Salon de Gand. The depiction of a satanic figure represented under water was unique in Western Art. Instead of wings he is represented with long octopus tentacles. His 'treasures' are the sleeping figures surrounded with jewels and gold coins; objects representing materialism and avarice. The figures show no sign of torment, but are rather represented in a state of somnolent bliss, as though they have succumbed to all that is 'satanic' in Delville's occult view; sensual pleasure and materialism. The work is an apotropaic icon against the snares of the lower passions and the world of matter and sensuality generally. The second Salon took place in March 1897 at Edmond Picard's arts venue, la Maison d'Art. Delville's contributions were small and included his Orph√©e aux Enfers, Parsifal and L‚ÄôOracle √† Dodone; which are now, apart from Parsifal, in private collections. At the time Delville was in Italy on his prescribed sojourn there after winning the coveted Prix de Rome. The show received largely positive reviews in the press and Delville's Salons were becoming more widely accepted, despite his aggressive polemics in the months prior to their establishment which hackled his contemporaries. What was noted as a feature of this Idealist art was its intellectual nature and the proclivity towards the expression of ideas. The final Salon d'Art Id√©aliste took place in March 1898 and was marked by the exhibition of Delville's great masterpiece, his l'Ecole de Platon (1898, Mus√©e D'Orsay), which marked the culmination of his Idealist programme and widely celebrated amongst his contemporary critics, even those who were previously hostile to his art and aesthetic programme.See Cole Jean Delville, pp. 115ff for a detailed discussion of Delville's Idealist Salons. After 1900 In 1895 Delville published his Dialogue entre nous, a text in which he outlined his views on occultism and esoteric philosophy. Brendan Cole discusses this text in detail his book on Delville, pointing out that, though the Dialogue reflects the ideas of a number of occultists, it also reveals a new interest in Theosophy. In the late 1890s, Delville joined the Theosophical Society. He was probably introduced to Theosophy directly through his friendship with Edouard Schur√©, the author of the widely influential book Les Grandes Initi√©s. Schur√© wrote the preface to Delville's work on Idealist Art, La Mission de l'Art (1900). Delville also came into close alliance with Annie Besant who inherited the leadership of the Theosophical movement. Besant gave a series of lectures in Brussels in 1899 titled La Sagesse Antique. Delville reviewed her talks in an article published in Le Thyrse that year.Delville, 'A propos de la Sagesse Antique. Conference de Mme Annie Besant', Le Thyrse, nr 9, 1 September 1899, pp. 65‚Äì6. It is probably from this point onwards that Delville became actively involved in the Theosophical Movements as such. Delville founded La Lumi√®re, a journal devoted to Theosophical ideas in 1899, and published articles from leading Theosophists of the day, including Besant. Delville became the first General Secretary of the Belgian branch of the Theosophical Society in 1911.See Flaurette Gautier, Jean Delville et l'occulture fin de si√®cle. Unpublished Master's thesis, Tours: University Fran√ßois-Rabelais, 2012. Delville's art flourished after 1900 and he produced some of his greatest works during this period up to the First World War. He worked with undiminished strength and imagination and his paintings revealed a visionary sense of the transcendental inspired by his involvement in the Theosophical movement, seen typically in works such as his monumental L'Homme-Dieu (1903, Brughes: Groeninge Museum) and Prom√©th√©e (1907, Free University Brussels). His most striking achievement, however, is his series of five vast canvases that decorated the Cour d'Assises in the Palais de Justice on the theme of 'Justice through the Ages'. These works, monumental in conception and scale and no doubt amongst his finest, were unfortunately destroyed during the second World War as a result of German bombing of the Palais de Justice on 3 September 1944. The irony of this action in relation to the theme of this cycle of paintings cannot be overlooked. Small-scale replacements were installed during the reconstruction of the Palais after the War. The gigantic original central painting titled, La Justice, la Loi et la Piti√©, measured 11 metres by 4.5 metres. This worked was flanked by two works, La Justice de Mo√Øse and La Justice chr√©tienne (both 4 by 3 metres). The two remaining panels represents Justice of the past and present: La Justice d'autrefois and La Justice moderne.Miriam Delville, Jean Delville, mon grand-p√®re, p. 26. Professor at the Glasgow School of Art, 1900‚Äì1906 Poster advertising Delville's private atelier, c. 1906 Delville hoped to secure a teaching place at the Academy in Brussels, but was offered instead a teaching position at the flourishing Glasgow School of Art in 1900. His tenure there was highly successful, and the works of the students he trained were celebrated at the annual exhibitions in London. When Delville returned to Brussels in 1907, many of his British students followed him to further their training under his tutelage in his private studio in rue Morris. At that time, Delville fulfilled his ambition to teach at the Brussels Academy and was appointed Professor of Life Studies, a post he held until his retirement in 1937. The First World War: Exile in London 1914‚Äì18 When War broke out, Delville, amongst many Belgians, was welcomed in Britain as exiles. He moved there with his entire family, including his wife and four younger children and settled in Golders Green in London. His two oldest sons, Elie and Rapha√´l Delville, were conscripted into the Belgian War Effort (both survived the conflict). Delville played an active role in London, through his writings, art and public addresses (he was a gifted orator) in support of the Belgians in exile and the conflict against the Germans. He contributed to the Belgian expatriate newspaper in London, L'Ind√©pendence Belge and wrote several articles and poems virulently condemning German aggression. He was an active member of the philanthropic society for Belgian refugees, La Ligue des Patriotes de Belgique, and was the president of La Ligue des Artistes belges that was responsible for the creation of the successful publication Belgian Art in Exile the sale of which raised money for Belgian charities in England. The work contains a great number of representative paintings and other works of art by contemporary Belgian artists. The volume was generally well received. The Sketch ran a supportive editorial in their January edition and gave informative information about the volume: > Belgian Art in Exile is the title of a very attractive album of > reproductions, mostly in colour, of paintings by exiled Belgian artists, > with photographs of works by Belgian sculptors, which has been issued in aid > of the Belgian Red Cross and other Belgian charitable institutions. The > colour-plates, which are beautifully reproduced, show the high quality and > great versatility of modern Belgian art. Particularly notable is a picture > of a Moorish cavalry charge, by Alfred Bastien, who since he came to this > country has done some fine work for the Illustrated London News.

At that time Delville was also an active Freemason and was involved in La Loge Albert 1er that reunited Belgian Freemasons in exile living in Britain.See Olivier Delville, Jean Delville, peintre, 1867‚Äì1953, Brussels: Laconti, 1984, pp. 32‚Äì4. His time in exile also inspired several important paintings, including: La Belgique indomptable (1916), depicting a sword-wielding allegorical female figure holding off an attacking Germanic eagle,Les M√®res (1919), depicting a group of mourning mothers surrounded by dead corpses of their fallen sons, and Sur l'Autel de la patrie (1918), a modern pieta depicting a female figure with the corpse of a bleeding dead soldier at her feet. His most notable work of this period is his Les Forces (completed in 1924), depicting two vast celestial armies confronting each other. The forces of light, represented on the right, are led by a Christ-like figure seated on a horse and a torch-bearing winged figure leading an army of angels into the fray against a battalion of dark forces streaming in from the left. The work is on open display in the Palais de Justice in the vast 'cour des pas perdus' and is grand in scale, measuring 5 metres by 8 metres. The 'Soci√©t√© de l'Art Monumental' 1920 From an early point in his career Delville was interested in producing art that would be displayed in public spaces for the edification of all. For him, art was a means of uplifting the public, and to this end he despised art that was produced for an elite clique, sold by dealers for the benefit of collectors who saw in art no more than an investment opportunity. Delville's ideals were strongly aligned to the idea of a social purpose for art, about which he wrote extensively during his career. In his Mission de l'Art he wrote: 'If the purpose of Art, socially speaking, is not to spiritualise the weighted thinking of the public, then one has the right to ask oneself, what is truly its usefulness, or more precisely, its purpose'.Delville, La Mission de L'Art, 1900, p. 23. Although he had already created several large artistic schemes that decorated public buildings, notably his panels for the Palais de Justice, his ambition formally to pursue this aim was finally realised in 1920 when he collaborated with several leading painters of his generation to create the Soci√©t√© de l'Art Monumental (Society for Monumental Art). The aim of the group was to bring together painters, artists and architects who would draw attention to the need for art specifically created for public buildings. An important realisation of this aim was the decoration of the walls in the colonnades of the hemicycles flanking the Arcade of the Parc du Cinquantenaire. Five artists collaborated with Delville on this project: Constant Montald, Emile Vloors, Omer Dierickx, Emile Fabry and Albert Ciamberlani. The last two were friends of Delville's since his days at the Academy and had collaborated on many project before. Most of these artists had also exhibited in Delville's Idealist forums, Pour L'Art and the Salons d'Art Id√©aliste during the 1890s. The project went ahead under the patronage of King Albert I, and was paid for through a scheme of national subscription. The overall theme of this major cycle of works was a patriotic commemoration of 'The Glorification of Belgium' following the Great War through allegorical images relating to War and peace. In 1924 Delville expressed his idea for the cycle as a 'vision of a frieze in mosaic unfurling its rhythm of lines and its harmony of colours between the columns of the hemicycle'Delville, 'Comment est n√© le project de la d√©coration de l'H√©micycle de l'Arcade du Cinquantenaire', in Gand Artistique November 1924, p. 256. Each artist prepared six individual works (cartoons) that were then adapted to the final mosaics which were three metres high and aligned to the top part of the wall. The total distance of all the mosaics was 120 metres. An overall harmony of all the individual panels was achieved by ensuring that the artists adhered to a few common rules of composition: using the same horizon line, using the same scale for the figures, and adhering to a limited palette of related colours. The specific theme to the left of the arcade is that of Belgium at peace. Works by Fabry, Vloors and Montald represented respectively: the material life, intellectual life and moral life. The specific theme to the right side represent heroic Belgium, with works by Delville, Ciamberlani and Dierickx representing respectively: Victory, the Tribute to Heroes and War. The project was conceived between 1922 and 1926 and completed in 1932. The mosaics themselves were executed by Jean Lahaye and Emile Van Asbroeck of the company A Godchol.see Arcade et h√©micycle Parc du Cinquantenaire This monumental creation was a vindication of Idealist trends in art presented in a public space and gave his artistic perspective a wider visibility amongst the general public.See Emile Berger, ' Jean Delville et l'enjeu du monumental', in Laoureux, et al. Jean Delville, Ma√Ætre de l'id√©al. p. 126ff. Working towards the public good and alleviating the suffering of mankind was also a principle ideal of the Theosophists, an ideal to which Delville's subscribed throughout his life. Delville's Theosophical-socialist views were articulated in two articles his published before the War: Socialisme de demain (1912) and Du Principe sociale de l'Art (1913). Later years From the 1920s onwards, Delville experienced a much more settled and successful career than ever before. With the highly successful completion of the two major public projects in the Palais de Justice and the Cinquantenaire,See Clovis Pi√©rard, 'Jean Delville, Peintre, Po√®te, Esth√©ticien', Memoire et Publications des Soci√©t√© des Arts et des Lettres de Hainault, (1971‚Äì1973), pp. 228ff and 236ff, concerning the highly positive public reception of these works. and his election as a member of the prestigious Belgian Royal Academy of sciences and letters in 1924, he seemed to have been drawn much closer into the Belgian establishment during these years. He maintained his post as 'Premier Professeur' at the Academy of Fine Art in Brussels until 1937 and continued to paint until crippling arthritis in his right hand forced him to give up the brush in 1947. His ambition to create large-scale Idealist works of art was sustained right up to the end of his painting career after the Second World War; notable examples amongst which include his Les Forces (1924, 55 √ó 800 cm, Palais de Justice), Les Derni√®res Idoles (1931, 450 √ó 300 cm, private collection) and La Roue du Monde (1940, 298 √ó 231 cm, Antwerp: Royal Museum of Fine Art). He was still able to sustain a power of expression and a highly articulate finish to his works in his later years that was there from the very start. However, a change in his style took place amongst some of his works in the 1930s, (especially while he was resident in Mons). Characteristically they became more pared-down in their articulation of form and colour: Shapes became more stylised and geometric and his colours were more pallid, or 'pastel' in tone, lacking the energy, vibrant contrasts and rich tonalities that was characteristic of his work until then. His treatment of figures also became more stylised and he often articulated their facial features with characteristically 'almond'-shaped eyes, giving his figures an otherworldy appearance. Typical examples of this period include his Seraphitus-Seraphita (1932), Les Id√©es (1934), Le Dieu de la Musique (1937) and P√©gase (1938). Memorial bust of Jean Delville, Avenue Sept Bonniers, Brussels, Belgium Delville remained a committed and passionate Theosophist until his death in 1953 and he maintained in one of his biographies that this always formed the foundation to this moral and artistic perspective throughout his later life. Regarding this important aspect of his intellectual and spiritual life, he wrote in 1944: > En r√©alit√©, la philosophie occulte occupe le fond de ma pens√©e depuis bien > des ann√©es ! Je pense avoir lu √† peu pr√®s tout ce qui fut publi√© d‚Äôimportant > sur les probl√®mes de l‚Äôinvisible. ... Depuis, j‚Äôai beaucoup cherch√©, √©tudi√© > sur la nature des ph√©nom√®nes psychiques. L‚ÄôEtude des sciences occultes est √† > la base de ma vie intellectuelle et morale.Jean Delville, Autobiographie, > manuscript: fonds Eggermont, PA/AACB/2009-20 Delville died on his birthday, 19 January 1953.  Honours  * 1919 : Officer of the Order of the Crown.Royal Decree of H.M. King Albert I on 14.11.1919 Theory and technique=Idealist theory Delville wrote prolifically throughout his life outlining his Idealist aesthetic. His first main publication on the subject was his Mission de l'Art (1900). Delville's Idealist theory is a syncretic formulation of traditional Idealist thinking (in the tradition of Plato, Schopenhauer and Hegel) and contemporary esoteric philosophy.For a complete discussion of the relationship between Delville's Mission de l'Art and Hegelian Idealism, see: Brendan Cole 'Jean Delville's La Mission de l'Art: Hegelian Echoes in fin-de-si√®cle Idealism', Religion and the Arts 10/2007; 11(3‚Äì4):330‚Äì372. In summary, Delville believed that art is the expression of the Ideal (or spiritual) in material form and is founded on the principle of Ideal Beauty, in other words Beauty that is the manifestation of the Ideal, or spiritual realm, in physical objects. Contemplating objects that manifest Ideal Beauty allows us to perceive, if only fleetingly, the spiritual dimension and we are transfigured as a result.For a detailed discussion of Delville's theory of art and Beauty, see: Brendan Cole, Jean Delville, Art between Nature and the Absolute., especially the detailed chapter four, pp. 150ff. Delville outlines this in a vivid passage in his La Mission de l'Art where he emphasises the expressive value of Idealist art, in other words, that it is not merely a question of engaging passively with the image, but it is also about feeling the 'energy' that it radiates, which uplifts and transforms the consciousness of the viewer, in a spiritual way. Idealism in art is, he writes, 'the introduction of Spirituality into Art'. For Delville, the Idea is an expression of the Ideal realm, and it is a living force within human experience that dwells within the transpersonal realm of human experience. He writes further that: > The Idea, in the metaphysical or esoteric sense, is Force, the universal and > divine force which moves worlds, and its movement is the supreme rhythm > whence springs the harmonious working of Life. Where there is no thought, > there is no life, no creation. The modern western world has become > unconscious of this tremendous power of the Ideal, and Art inevitably has > thus become degraded. This ignorance of the creative forces of thought has, > nevertheless, obscured and diverted towards materialism all modern > judgement. Materialism does not know how ideas and thoughts vibrate, and how > these vibrations impinge on the consciousness of the individual. And yet > these vibrations, though invisible to the greater part of mankind, are able > to exercise an astounding influence over the mentality of human beings, and > thus assist in their evolution. Before works of genius the human > consciousness receives mental and spiritual vibrations, which are generated > by the force of the idea reflected. The more elevated, pure and sublime a > work is, the more the inner being, coming into contact with the ideal > vibrations emanated from it, will be raised, purified, and made sublime. The > artist who is not ideal, that is to say, artist who does not know that every > form must be the result of an idea, and that every idea must have its form, > the artist, in short, who does not know that Beauty is the luminous > conception of equilibrium in forms, will never have any influence over the > soul, because his works will be really without thought, that is, without > life. The Idea is the emotion of the Spirit as Emotion is the reflex of the > Soul.Jean Delville, La Mission de L'Art translated as The New Mission of > Art. A Study of Idealism in Art. Translated by Francis Colmer, with an > introduction by Cliffor Bax and Edouard Schur√©. London: Francis Griffiths, > 1910, pp 11‚Äì12. Delville goes further by dividing his understanding of Beauty into three categories: I) Spiritual Beauty: the source of beauty in physical objects, ii) Formal beauty: the physical articulation of Beauty in works of art, and iii) Technical beauty: the specific execution of line, colour, light and shade, and composition to express Ideal beauty in physical objects and works of art. In French Delville referred to these terms as: La Beaut√© spirituelle, La Beaut√© plastique and La Beaut√© technique.see Delville's, La Mission de l'Art, pp. 15ff. Delville goes further to map his threefold conception of Beauty onto his esoteric conception of the threefold nature of reality, consisting of the Natural, Human and Divine realms, as well as the threefold nature of man as body (senses), soul (feeling) and mind (thought and spirituality).Cole, Jean Delville, pp. 335‚Äì336. He writes: > The work of Idealist Art is therefore that which will harmonise in itself > the three great Words of Life: the Natural, the Human and the Divine. To > attain this degree of aesthetic balance, ‚Äì which, I am happy to concede, is > not within the reach of just anyone! ‚Äì one must find within the work the > purest idea on an intellectual level, the most beautiful form within the > artistic realm, and the most perfect technique in terms of execution. > Without an idea, a work misses its intellectual mission, without form, it > misses its natural mission and, without technique, it misses its goal of > perfection. ‚Ä¶ The veritable character of the work of Idealist Art can be > identified from the balance reigning over its accomplishment, meaning that > it does not let the essential terms of idea, art or technique prevail one > over the other, but more likely according to relations proportional to their > respective powers.Delville, La Mission de L'Art, pp.35‚Äì36. Translated in > Cole, Jean Delville, p. 335. The Classical Tradition Delville believed that the purest expression of Idealist art was to be found in the Classical Tradition of ancient Greek art and the High Renaissance. For him, Classical art was the purest expression of the spiritual in material form. Delville sought to reinterpret the Classical idiom in a contemporary context, to suite, in other words his specific Idealist style of art that he was formulating during the 1890s; not simply, in other words, to copy or imitate classical modes of artCole, pp. 191ff. The expression of harmony and equilibrium, which he saw as an essential aspect of Classical art, were fundamental in the expression of the spiritual in natural forms. There is a mystical aspect to Delville's aesthetic, and idea of Ideal Beauty, when he wrote that: > The Beautiful, taken in its classical sense, is not an illusion. The > Beautiful is the True manifested by the Idea in form. This is the highest > goal that the artist must seek to attain ‚Ä¶ When the artist causes light to > spring forth from darkness, beauty from ugliness, the pure from the impure, > he reveals Truth to humanity, he reveals God. The Beautiful, the True, the > Good are synonyms. It is the glory of Art to be able to make perceptible to > human eyes the three mysteries which form a single one!Delville, 'Autre > Pens√©e'. I-XIII, La Ligue Artistique, 14 (July 1898), p. 2. Quoted in Cole, > Jean Delville, p. 192. Idealist art Delville developed a distinct style in his painting, which is unmistakable. His finished drawing and paintings are highly articulate and precise in the way he renders forms. However, his works are not overbearingly detailed, as is often found in realist art, but he manages to capture the essence of the forms he articulates using the simplest means possible. This is especially so in his approach to figures. In his l'Amour des Ames he outlines the figures using long, curvaceous contours, and their anatomy is only lightly suggested using gentle contrasts in light and shade; the effect is the expression of great beauty without being overbearingly sensual: a technique often seen in Renaissance frescos. Delville had a great imagination for colour and its use for expressive purposes. His colours are often vivid, almost visionary; most clearly seen in his Tr√©sors de Sathan which is bathed in an atmosphere of luminous golds and yellows. In his L'Ange des Splendeurs he captures the effect of iridescent, diaphanous gold in the angel's drapery contrasting distinctly with the heavy earthiness of the natural details (animals, spiders, vegetation) at bottom right hand side. His Ecole de Platon is a paradigm of serenity in his use of muted, cool colours and pastel shades to emphasise the intellectual idyll of Plato's Akademos. Delville very seldom painted landscapes, still life or portraits for their own sake, but often incorporated these in his figure paintings. Almost all of Delville's paintings focus on the human form as the bearer of the drama of his works. He was a master of the articulation of human anatomy which he used to express vividly his Idealist technique and ideas. The various ways he articulates the human form is key to understanding his artistic programme that he unveiled in his paintings throughout his career. This is especially the case in the rendering of lithe and supple male and female figures in his Les Tr√©sors de Sathan, L'Amour des Ames and L'Ecole de Platon, or the highly expressive drawn, sinewy almost emaciated forms in the lower part of his epic l'Homme-Dieu displaying the suffering and distress of the human condition; or in the highly muscular, Titanesque rendering of anatomy in his heroic figures in his Prom√©th√©e and Les Derni√®res Idoles. For a good selection of paintings with clear reproductions see this website: \\"Jean Delville: Initiate of Spiritual Beauty\\" Practise: idealist artworks=Mysteriosa or The Portrait of Mrs. Stuart Merrill (1892) Pencil, pastel and coloured pencil on paper, 40 x 32.1 cm, Brussels: Royal Museum of Fine Art Though Delville frequently wrote about his ideas, he almost never discussed his paintings. He left the interpretations to the viewer, and as a result his best pictures have an air of mystery and intrigue. One of the most mysterious is his Portrait of Mrs. Stuart Merrill. This drawing, executed in chalks in 1892, is strikingly otherworldly. In it Delville depicts the young woman as a medium in trance, with her eyes turned upwards. Her radiating red-orange hair combines with the fluid light of her aura. The hot colours which surround Mrs. Merrill's head appear to allude to the earthly fires of passion and sensuality. On the other hand, the book on which she rests her chin and long, almost spectral hands is inscribed with an upwards-pointing triangle. This represents Delville's idea of perfect human knowledge, achieved (as he says in his Dialogue), through magic, the Kabbalah and Hermeticism. As a number of authors have pointed out, the painting, with its references to occultism and wisdom seems to hint at initiation. If so, the woman's red aura might refer to her sensual side, which will become more spiritualised as she moves into a different stage of development. Whatever its interpretation, this very unusual portrait has had a strong effect on viewers. It can be seen as eerie and supernatural (Bade, Femme Fatale, 1979), or as \\"a positively magical vision\\" (Jullian, Dreamers of Decadence, 1974). It is sometimes referred to as the Mona Lisa of the 1890s, and is also given the title La Mysteriosa . Today, few details are available about the sitter, and even her first name goes unmentioned in the literature. The most extensive information on her identity is given by Delville's son Olivier in his biography of the painter. It is not a first-hand account, however, as Olivier was born at least ten years after the picture was executed. According to him, Stuart Merrill (a Symbolist poet who published his works in Paris and Brussels) had a house near to the Delvilles in Forest at that time. Olivier adds that \\"the young Mrs Merrill-Rion\\" was a Belgian, and that Delville was struck by her strange beauty and depicted her with a mediumistic character. It is likely that Delville painted other portraits of Mrs Stuart Merrill and the 1893 drawing 'Medusa', in the same media is undoubtedly one of these. The painting was not bought by the Merrills, and remained with the Delvilles until it was sold to a Californian private collector in the late 1960s. In 1998, it was acquired by the Brussels Museum of Fine Arts, and is now on display to the public. The Angel of Splendour (L'Ange des Splendeurs, 1894) Oil in canvas, 127 x 146 cm, Brussels: Museum of Fine Art. This is undoubtedly one of Delville's most visionary images of the early 1890s. The work refers to Delville's interests in the idea of initiation and the spiritualisation of the soul. As seen in many of his works, Delville often plays on the tension between opposites: light and dark, spirit and matter, Nature and the Ideal, etc. These ideas are personified in this work in the duality between the androgynous Angel and the young androgynous youth who is ensnared in the natural or material realm. His lower torso is engulfed in serpents and surrounded by toads, spiders, butterflies and other life-forms of the natural world. The Angel, on the other hand is a vision of diaphanous gold, clothed in a dress that is more fluid than material, emanating a soft, but intense, light. Her face is of the exquisite beauty commonly seen in Renaissance portraiture, notably in the work of Leonardo, who Delville admired. The bright aureole that surrounds her face beaming light in all directions is a common signifier of her spiritual nature. Her proportions are odd, by human standards, and they were criticised by his contemporaries, but Delville understood that to humanise the angel would be to contradict her symbolic function in this work. She remains a being who is physically of her own, transcendental, realm. She points upwards indicating the path to the Ideal realm of spirit and beauty while the youth reaches towards her in an attempted gesture to release himself from the material snares that envelop him from below. There is an obvious tension here, as it is not entirely clear whether the youth will make it, or sink back into the deadening material realm from which he is emerging. The first step on the path of initiation and transcendence is to overcome and control the limitations of the illusory material dimension, and specifically to control the passions and desires, in order to clear the path for the transcendence of the soul. This painting is a totem of that moment in the initiatory drama that Delville expressed in many of his paintings and poems at the time.The work is discussed in detail in, Cole, ibid., pp 280‚Äì292. Sathan‚Äôs Treasures (Les Tr√©sors de Sathan, 1895) Oil on canvas, 258 x 268 cm, Brussels: Museum of Fine Art Delville exhibited his Tr√©sors de Sathan (Sathan's Treasures) at the Salon de Gand in September 1895 while he was working on his entry for the Belgian Prix de Rome. It was then exhibited in Brussels for the first time in 1896 at Delville's first Salon d'Art Id√©aliste. This was one of Delville's first 'breakthrough' paintings and one of his most important works from his artistic period up to 1895.See Cole, Jean Delville. Art Between Nature and the Absolute, ibid, p. 215. On the whole, Delville's works generally deal with the theme of the duality between nature (human or otherwise) and the transcendental world. Delville was an Idealist, in other words, he believed in the reality of a transcendental or spiritual dimension as the basis of reality. Our perceptual material world is, in this world-view, seen merely an illusion that brings suffering and discontent. Our goal is to spiritualise our being and refine our material selves, which includes our desires and need for the fulfillment of material satisfaction. Without a spiritual context in mind, men and women simply become deadened materialistic entities always governed by their desires, passions, greed and ego-driven need for control and power over others. This is the realm of matter, or in Delville's cosmology, the realm of Sathan, who controls and governs our lower state of being. Without a spiritual goal in life, we are merely slaves to Sathan and are completely submissive to his power; we become his 'treasure' as is implied in the title of this painting. Here Delville depicts Sathan as a rather attractive figure, beguiling, powerful and seductive, dragging the hapless mass of men and woman to his undersea lair. Significantly the figures are not in a state of pain or agony, as is usually the case in Western depictions of Satan's underworld. Here they appear to be in a state of reverie and bliss, unconscious of their lives and the value of the spiritual reality of their existence, and succumbing, rather, entirely to the lure of gold and sensual pleasure; in other words, material greed and sensualism that Delville saw as a trap and a catastrophic diversion from humanity's true goal which is to spiritualise one's being and enter the higher realm of consciousness and spiritual bliss which he referred to as the 'Ideal'.For a very detailed discussion of this work, see Cole, ibid., pp. 215 to 244. The theme of exercising control over one's lower nature, of erotic temptation and indulgence was believed by Delville and his esoteric contemporaries (especially Jos√©ph P√©ladan) to represent the first stage on the path of initiation. This was first suggested in Edouard Schur√©'s influential work The Great Initiates and outlined in a passage reconstructing the Egyptian initiatory trials. He recounts how the final trial is set to resist erotic temptation personified in the form of an alluring female figure.See Edouard Schur√©, Les Grandes Initi√©s,Paris, Perrin, reprint, 1921, p. 135. Delville expressed these ideas in an article published in the contemporary journal Le Mouvement Litt√©raire in 1893: > Erotic fever has sterilised most minds. One ordinarily thinks of himself as > virile because he satisfies a woman‚Äôs unquenched bestial desires. Well, > that‚Äôs where the great shame of the cerebral degeneration of our time > starts. The poet, the artist, the scientist are mostly attached to the > spiritual functions rather than the emasculating animal functions. The real > male is he whose mind can dominate the body and who only responds to > solicitations of the flesh as his will allows. ‚Ä¶ if the works of the Sar, a > virile man if ever there was one, energetically banish sexual conflicts, > that is, are a consistent plea in favour of chastity, it is because he has > studied the ravages of carnal love, because he has understood that one has > to beware of the feelings of the heart, a heart in love being a dangerous > accomplice of instinct. ‚Ä¶ Unfortunately, for the most part, we remain > stubbornly ignorant of the fact that real virginity develops highly the > powers of the soul, and that, to those who dedicate themselves to it, it > imparts faculties unknown to the rest of the human race.Jean Delville, > 'Conf√©rence sur \\"Comment on Devient Mage\\" du Sar M√©rodack J. P√©ladan', Le > Mouvement Litt√©raire, 45 (8 December 1893), p. 358. There are also frequent references to 'Sathan' in Delville's 1897 anthology of poems Frisson du Sphinx, for example his 'Les Murmures de l‚ÄôOmbre', 'T√™te d‚ÄôOmbre', 'La Temp√™te' and 'l‚ÄôEtoile Noire'. This last vividly evokes the motif that runs throughout Delville's writings: L'√âTOILE NOIRE Du plus profond enfer du mal et du n√©ant l'on voit le noir √©clat de l'astre satanique darder sinistrement, comme en une panique, ses n√©fastes rayons au coeur du m√©cr√©ant. Sathan br√ªle ce feu sombre des mal√©fices pour fasciner les yeux coupables et damn√©s et pour faire jaillir sur tous ceux qui sont n√©s le chaos infernal des t√©n√®bres complices. M√™lant son despotisme √† son absurdit√©, contre le Beau, l'Amour, le Ciel, la V√©rit√©, c'est le mensonge haineux et la lourde ignorance. O ! vieil astre de mort, effroyable appareil, vous √™tes la nuit froide et la morne impuissance, car le sang clair du Christ est l'√¢me du soleil! The Dark Star (translation)  The School of Plato (L'Ecole de Platon, 1898) Oil on canvas, 260 x 605 cm, Paris: Mus√©e D'Orsay In this important painting, Delville invokes the serene beauty of the Classical world and its aesthetic and philosophical principles. Delville painted this work while he was in Italy on his artistic sojourn there after winning the coveted Belgian Prix de Rome. Delville was then, at last, able to study the classical works of the Renaissance and the ancient world that profoundly influenced his artistic ideas. The scale of the painting is impressive, measuring 2.60 metres high by 6.05 metres long, and Delville certainly had in mind large-scale Academic History paintings which were the preserve of erudite artistic subjects painted in the classical tradition, which he sought to renew.See Brendan Cole, Jean Delville. Art Between Nature and the Absolute, p 310. Cole gives a highly detailed analysis and discussion of this work; see ibid., pp 307‚Äì353 The figures depicted are almost life size. The style of the painting is inspired by the Italian frescoes by Raphael and Michelangelo that Delville would have seen while in Rome; characterised by bold articuation of forms with a matte (as opposed to a glossy) finish. The painting was first exhibited at Delville's final Salon d'Art Id√©aliste in Brussels in 1898. The work was universally praised as a masterpiece by his contemporaries. The leading avant-garde art journal L'Art Moderne, which was frequently hostile towards Delville and his art, praised his work in the following: 'Jean Delville ... has created a Work! A superb work of art: The School of Plato, to which he refers as \\"an essay in Fresco\\" ‚Äì Go and see it! It is of a calm, a serene, a grand and delicious Beauty ... Ideal, yes, truly ideal. The programme shows his worth and it is magnificent.... It is beautiful, beautiful, beautiful!'Geste 3e des Salons d‚ÄôArt id√©aliste a la Maison d‚ÄôArt', L‚ÄôArt Moderne, 12 (20 March 1898), p. 93. Delville was immersed in studying the esoteric tradition and the hidden philosophies that were popular at the time. This was a tradition that extolled the virtues of self-improvement and spiritual progress through initiation. Edouard Schur√© already identified Plato as one of the 'Great Initiates', in other words, light bearers who guide humanity towards higher consciousness and deeper spiritual awareness during our earthly incarnation. Plato taught of the essential duality between the material and metaphysical dimensions; his gesture, pointing upwards and downwards alludes to this duality between macrocosm and microcosm.See Cole, ibid., pp. 339ff. Attainment of the Ideal realm and the expression of its truths in physical form was the key notion in Delville's aesthetic philosophy. He wrote often that the goal of art should aspire towards expressing Absolute, or Spiritual Beauty in physical form. He saw Classical art as the purest expression of this goal and he sought a revival of this idea in art, reworking it in a way that was appropriate for his contemporary cultural era. For Delville, moreover, the human body, was the purest expression of Ideal and Spiritual Beauty. He therefore often resorted to the depiction of nude male and female figures in his art as vehicles for the expression of this Ideal; as is clearly seen in this work. Concerning the spiritual importance of the nude as a vehicle for the expression of a Spiritual ideal he wrote > The nude has the high quality of being synthetic and universal. ‚Ä¶ in evoking > Mankind, it evokes Humanity and all the beauty of Life, not life as we > modern beings understand it, comprising nerves, morbid fevers and agitation, > but the great universal life, which enriches the spirit and the earth, makes > stars and souls resplendent and makes space vibrate, which beats in > substance as in essence, which rules and moves the Universe, the beings and > the objects, mortal or immortal, in the infinite rhythm and the mystery of > Eternity, divine macrocosm and human microcosm where Universal Beauty, made > of Love, Wisdom and Light, shines and is reflected forever.Delville, La > Mission de l'Art, Brussels: Georges Balat, 1900, pp. 62‚Äì3, translated in > Cole, ibid., p. 301. The men in this painting are conceived in an idealised androgynous form: a concept that Delville, following P√©ladan, developed to express the ideal of a non-erotic perfection of the human state that synthesises the male and female principle in an idea of wholeness and perfection, which emulates the original state of human perfection that precedes our split, dual experience of reality in our earthly incarnation.See Cole, ibid., pp. 334ff.  The Love of Souls (L'Amour des Ames, 1900)  Tempera and oil on canvas, 268 x 150 cm. Brussels: Mus√©e communal des beaux-arts d'Ixelles. This is undoubtedly one of Delville's most subtly articulated and beautiful images of the period. Delville depicts the union of souls, male and female, in a cosmic setting. This painting suggests a theme important to Delville and his contemporaries regarding the return to unity in the dual male and female principles of human experience that results in spiritual androgyny. Male energy and female energy is united to form a state of wholeness and complete unity of Being. It is a cosmic conception of the goal of existence, beyond opposites, polarity and discord. This state signifies a return to the original state of perfection and integration of opposites that unites us to the Cosmic mind; beyond time and space and the duality of physical and material existence. This spiritual union gives birth to the transcendent being; the cosmic Christ within. Delville often wrote of the nature of duality and the forces of opposites, as well as the need to bring these into harmony, in other words achieving Equilibrium. In fact, he understood the experience of opposition in nature (human as well as in the natural world) as an underlying 'law' relating to what he termed the 'Equilibrium in the Universal Order', with regard to which, he wrote: > In spite of a contrary appearance, all the forces, all the manifestations of > nature influence each other with currents of negative polarity and positive > polarity, undeniable astral influences. ‚Ä¶ The great contrasts of life, > however, are responsible for all the misery, all the hardship; are they > responsible for the production of Chaos? A huge mistake: The Great and the > Small, the Strong and the Weak, the High and the Low, the Active and the > Passive, the Full and the Empty, the Weighty and the Dense, Exterior and > Interior, the Visible and the Invisible, the Beautiful and the Ugly, the > Good and the Bad, Essence and Substance, Spirit and Matter are divergent > forces which eternally constitute the great Equilibrium in the Universal > Order. It is a Natural Law, and no philosophy, no dogma, no doctrine will > ever prevail over It.Delville, Dialogue Entre Nous. Argumentation > Kabbalistique, Occultiste, Id√©aliste (Bruges: Daveluy Fr√®res, 1895), pp. > 77‚Äì8. The setting of this work is important. Delville places the figures in an indeterminate, cosmic setting, suggesting that they are not figures that have human substance, but are rather symbols of the transcendent spiritual nature of man and woman. The ribbons of colour surrounding them suggests a fluid energy field upon which they are buoyed; an idea that Delville and his contemporaries often referred to as 'astral light' ‚Äì an energy-force that animates living entities; much like the idea of 'the field' in quantum physics. Delville painted this work in Tempera, where pigments are mixed with egg white to create a luminous finish and a highly durable work of art. He was highly influenced by the artists of the Italian Renaissance who often used Tempera in their works, and which, to this day, retain their purity of colour and luminosity to a high degree. The close-up details reveal his technique of applying the paint in small strokes, rather than blend the colours on the palette, they are blended by the eye. To achieve this effect one has to be highly skilled as a draughtsman.For a detailed discussion of this work, see Cole, Jean Delville, Art Between Nature and the Absolute, pp. 293‚Äì306 Character In his biography, Delville's son Olivier tells us that his father, determined to pass his ideals on to the world, was continually painting and writing. He supplemented this unreliable income by teaching art, but his busy professional life did not prevent him from applying his strongly held beliefs to his personal life. Olivier describes his father as a person of courage, perseverance, probity and intellect, as well as an upright family man who was strict with his six children. Legacy Delville is still not nearly as well known as some of his contemporaries of the Symbolist era. There are historical reasons for this. For instance, he never exhibited at the main exhibition societies in Brussels during the early part of his career, such as Les XX and La Libre Esth√©tique. The reputations of many of his contemporaries, like Khnopff, Mellery and Ensor, were largely founded on their participation at these Societies, which promoted heavily their art through organised marketing campaigns, and by establishing a commercial network of dealers and collectors to invest in the art exhibited there. They were also very successful in making their art well known internationally. There was an overt commercial element associated with these societies in the way they created an aura about the art exhibited there as a desirable commodity. Delville shunned the commercialisation of art and the way it was manufactured as an elite commodity. Although he sold works at his own Societies, such as Pour l'Art and the Salons d'Art Id√©aiste, their purpose was mainly to create a forum for artists working in an idealist vein. Delville was mainly committed to using art as a force to transform society and to improve the lives of those around him. He wrote: 'there will be nothing to prevent art increasingly to become an educative force in society, conscious of its mission. It is time to penetrate society with art, with the ideal and with beauty. Today's society tends to fall increasingly into instinct. It is saturated with materialism, sensualism and ... commercialism'.Jean Delville, 'Le Principe Social de l‚ÄôArt', La Belgique Artistique et Litt√©raire, v. 7, April- June 1907, p. 39. Quoted in Brendan Cole 'Jean Delville and the Belgian avant-garde: Anti-materialist polemics in support of \\"un art annonciateur des spiritualit√©s futures\\"‚Äô, in Rosina Neginsky (ed.), Symbolism, Its Origins and Its Consequences (Cambridge: Cambridge Scholars Publishing), 2010, pp. 135ff. Delville believed, rather, that a respiritulaisation of society would be a redeeming path to rescue it from the morbidity of materialism. Elsewhere he wrote: 'Idealism ... has a universalizing educational and social impact ... Idealism sees humanity in terms of the immense vitality of his ideal future. In order for the artist to become aware of this, it is necessary for him to purify and elevate himself. ... The role of modern idealism will be to draw the artistic temperament away from the deadly epidemics of materialism ... and finally to guide him towards the purified regions of an art that is the harbinger of future spirituality.'Delville, 'L‚ÄôEsth√©tique Id√©aliste'. (II) L‚ÄôArt Moderne. No. 21, 21 May 1899, pp. 176‚Äì177. See Brendan Cole 'Jean Delville and the Belgian avant-garde: Anti-materialist polemics in support of \\"un art annonciateur des spiritualit√©s futures\\"‚Äô, pp. 135ff. Delville remained desperately poor during the early part of his career and his condition was only occasionally relieved by the stipend associated with the Prix de Rome that he won as well as his employment at the Glasgow School of Art, and later the Ecole des beaux-arts. Delville never sold to dealers and only very seldom took on private commissions for portraits (a genre he would have excelled in). Most of his paintings were on a grand scale and he devised these mostly to be exhibited in public spaces, following his ideal of the social role of art. Thus, the poor reputation associated with Delville's art is in part probably related to the lack of any committed exposure and sustained marketing of his work, which was essential in forging the reputations of the early avant garde and afterwards. Delville also came from a working-class background which was a huge disadvantage in the contemporary bourgeois-dominated culture in Belgium. This would certainly have contributed to the erasure of his worth as an artist over time. And finally Delville was fiercely independent in his approach to promoting his ideas and artistic ideals, seldom bending to the will of what was popular or acceptable in conservative bourgeois circles that controlled and dominated the art market during his formative years. Mainstream critics and peers generally shunned his Art and ideals as a result. Despite his immense talent and vision, Delville remained a 'voice in the wilderness' during this time. This reputation persisted during the course of his life and afterwards as well.see Cole, ibid. Another great disadvantage related to Delville's reputation relates to the limited exposure of his major works in public museums, and the relative paucity of published material (until recently) concerning Delville's art and career. The Museum of Fine Art in Brussels houses, by far, more works than any public collection, but few of these are on public display. This is also the case in other centres in Belgium (Bruges and Antwerp, for example). Few of his works are to be seen in major museums outside Belgium; with the exception of his l'Ecole de Platon in the Mus√©e d'Orsay in Paris. Many of his smaller works have long since disappeared or have been destroyed, which leaves conspicuous lacunae in his catalogue of extant works. The loss of major paintings like his Cycle passionnel and La Justice √† travers les √¢ges, amongst others also diminishes the impact of his known oeuvre. Moreover, a great number of his works are in private collections and their whereabouts still needs to be determined. This all means that access to his works is extremely limited and they remain out of the 'public eye', and hence the collective imagination generally. Reproductions of some of his paintings and drawings are available on the Internet, but usually of poor quality which reduces their impact considerably. Finally, until very recently, there have been no major studies or monographs on the artist's work, which until now has left considerable gaps in our understanding of his life, art and ideas. Despite this, a resurgence of interest in his work and ideas appears to be taking place, notably with the recent important retrospective exhibition in Namur that brought together many important paintings and drawings, many of which have not been seen before in public since they were first exhibited in the nineteenth century. Several Belgian and English Art Historians, working in collaboration with Delville's heirs and estate, are also taking a renewed interest in Delville's work, revealing detailed aspects of his life and work for the first time through detailed studies and monographs on aspects of Delville's life and art (see 'Sources').

Background The International Council of Nurses (ICN) has celebrated this day since 1965. In 1953 Dorothy Sutherland, an official with the U.S. Department of Health, Education and Welfare, proposed that President Dwight D. Eisenhower proclaim a \\"Nurses' Day\\"; he did not approve it. In January 1974, 12 May was chosen to celebrate the day as it is the anniversary of the birth of Florence Nightingale, the founder of modern nursing. Each year, ICN prepares and distributes the International Nurses' Day Kit. The kit contains educational and public information materials, for use by nurses everywhere. As of 1998, 8 May was designated as annual National Student Nurses' Day.

Additionally, in each of the Australian states and territories, various nursing award ceremonies are conducted during the week.  China  In 2007, 5000 nurses gathered in Yichun, East China's Jiangxi Province.  Ireland  Since 2012, Nurse Jobs Ireland (an Irish nurse recruitment agency) launch a week long pro-bono campaign to celebrate nurses on the 6‚Äì12 May every year. This week long celebration uses digital platforms such as Twitter and Facebook to promote the great work nurses do using the hashtag #CelebrateNurses. The public leave their positive comments and thanks on the Celebrate Nurses website where they are collated into an ebook which is shared in medical facilities throughout Ireland.  Singapore  Singapore celebrates Nurses Day on 1 August. Back in the 1800s, a thriving Singapore found itself in need of providing better healthcare and medical services to a growing population. While there were several hospitals, there was a lack of nurses to support the doctors. French nuns from the Convent of the Holy Infant Jesus were trained to become nurses to fulfil this need, as they were seen as the only educated European women in Singapore who could undertake this challenge. 1 August 1885 marks the beginning of the development of nursing in Singapore when these nuns began their nursing duties in the General Hospital at the Sepoy Lines in the Outram area. Taiwan In 2003, after the outbreak of highly contagious SARS, spread from but hidden by China, President Chen Shui-bian visited a hospital on International Nurses Day to express admiration for 3 nurses, infected with SARS and sacrificed, among other medical personnel fighting on the frontline. He conveyed wishes to nurses for their devotion to duty of caring and reminded hospital staff that they should adopt strict precautionary measures to protect themselves before contacting with patients. President Tsai Ing-wen, with the Minister of Health and Welfare, attends International Nurses Day celebration At 2017 International Nurses Day celebration, the first female President Tsai Ing-wen conducted a \\"passing of the torch\\" ceremony with leaders of the Taiwan Union of Nurses Association and the Taiwan Nurses Association. She honored nurses recognized for outstanding professionalism and service as well as over 2,200 nurses at the event who have been working for over 25 years. President Tsai expressed deepest respect and gratitude for their contributions to the health of people in Taiwan, and stressed the government has responsibility to increase benefits available to nurses and achieve more reasonable nurse-to- patient ratios and ensure friendlier workplaces. She also praised Taiwan's long tradition of providing international medical aid with the participation of nurses and emphasized the need to interact with other countries to share experience in nursing care. She emphasized the nursing profession's concern for global health is a shared value for all nations. Thailand Starting in 1990, Thailand observes 21 October as National Nurses' Day (Wan Phayaban Haeng Chat). The date commemorates the birth of Srinagarindra the Princess Mother and was adopted 4 April 1990.  United Kingdom  Each year a service is held in Westminster Abbey in London. During the Service, a symbolic lamp is taken from the Nurses' Chapel in the Abbey and handed from one nurse to another, thence to the Dean, who places it on the High Altar. This signifies the passing of knowledge from one nurse to another. At St Margaret's Church at East Wellow in Hampshire, where Florence Nightingale is buried, a service is also held on the Sunday after her birthday.  United States and Canada (National Nursing Week)  US President Donald Trump signs a proclamation in honor of National Nurses Day in May 2020 The U.S. celebrates National Nursing Week each year from 6 May to 12 May (the birthday of Florence Nightingale). Canada celebrates National Nursing Week each year during the week that includes 12 May. The Canadian Minister of Health instituted National Nursing Week in Canada in 1985. In the U.S., National Nurses Week was first observed from 11‚Äì16 October 1954 in honor of the 100th anniversary of Florence Nightingale's mission to Crimea. President Nixon later proclaimed a \\"National Nurse Week\\" in 1974. In 1982, President Reagan signed a proposal officially designating 6 May as \\"National Recognition Day for Nurses,\\" now known as National Nurses Day or National RN Recognition Day. In 1990, the American Nurses Association (ANA) expanded the holiday into the current National Nurses Week celebrated from 6 May to 12 May. In 1997, at the request of the National Student Nurses' Association, the ANA designated 8 May as National Student Nurses Day. In 2003, the ANA designated the Wednesday within National Nurses Week as National School Nurse Day. The National Association of School Nurses, however, claims that National School Nurse Day has been recognized since 1972.

The grounds are the respective homes of Yorkshire County Cricket Club (CCC) and Leeds Rhinos rugby league club. Initially owned by the Leeds Cricket, Football and Athletic Company, the complex is now owned by Yorkshire CCC, which jointly manages it with Leeds Rugby Limited, a joint venture of two rugby clubs. From 2006 until 2017, the stadium was officially known as the Headingley Carnegie Stadium as a result of sponsorship from Leeds Metropolitan University, whose sports faculty is known as the Carnegie School of Sport Exercise and Physical Education. Since 1 November 2017, the stadium is known as the Emerald Headingley Stadium due to the purchase of the naming rights by Emerald Group Publishing. Owning the ground In December 2005, Yorkshire County Cricket Club obtained a loan of ¬£9 million from Leeds City Council towards the cost of purchasing the cricket ground for ¬£12 million. Shortly afterwards, 98.37% of members who participated in a vote backed the deal. On 11 January 2006, the club announced plans to rebuild the stand next to the rugby ground with 3,000 extra seats, taking capacity to 20,000. The club also announced plans to redevelop the Winter Shed (North) stand on 25 August 2006 providing a ¬£12.5 million pavilion complex. Cricket ground The cricket ground in 2006. The cricket ground sits to the northern side of the complex. It opened in 1891 and has been used for Test matches since 1899. It is the main home ground of Yorkshire County Cricket Club and Yorkshire Vikings Twenty20 cricket team. The ground last hosted The Ashes in 2019. Since 2015 the cricket ground has been floodlit. The ground has a seated capacity of 18,350, executive facilities and a new media centre opened in 2010. All but the stand at the football ground end have been rebuilt since 2000, it is proposed to replace this stand in conjunction with redeveloping its other side facing the rugby ground. Rugby ground Headingley rugby ground The rugby ground sits to the southern side of the complex. Historically a rugby league ground it now also hosts some rugby union. It is home to Leeds Rhinos rugby league team. The ground consists of three stands and an open terrace at one end, one stand is completely seated, and two mixed. It has a capacity of 21,500. In 2019, a new modern Tetley South Stand was opened. Future developments North Stand and entrance Redevelopment on the rugby side of the ground Yorkshire County Cricket Club have shown keen interest in redeveloping the northern side of the ground. This is a major inconvenience to Leeds Rugby Limited as they wish to redevelop their North Stand, which backs onto the Cricket Ground, any redevelopment of this stand cannot go ahead until Yorkshire Cricket are also willing to redevelop their side of the cricket pitch. If Headingley is to retain Test Ground Status it is likely that further improvements will need to be made to the ground. On 5 June 2014 Yorkshire CCC announced the \\"Headingley Masterplan\\". The phased redevelopment costing around ¬£50 million will take place over the next 20 years. Phase One Erection of four permanent floodlight pylons. The floodlights, which have light arrays in the shape of the Yorkshire Rose, were installed in 2015. The first full game to be played under them was the T20 match against Derbyshire Falcons on Friday 15 May 2015, but they were also called upon for the County Championship game against Warwickshire a few weeks earlier. Phase Two The rebuild of the Football Ground End, in conjunction with Leeds Rugby, to incorporate a three- tiered seating area, which will accommodate 5,060 seats, enhanced corporate facilities and new permanent concession units. Phase Three To incorporate an additional 915 seats to the upper tier of the North East Stand with the possibility of a cantilever roof from the side of the Carnegie Pavilion to the existing scoreboard. Phase Four The development of a new Pavilion located in the North West area of the stadium complex. Built on five levels, the Pavilion will be adjacent to the existing Carnegie Pavilion. To include state-of-the- art corporate facilities, new dressing rooms for the players and coaching staff, Members‚Äô Long Room and seating and the creation of a main entrance to the stadium on Kirkstall Lane. Phase Five The erection of a translucent cantilever roof to cover the White Rose Stand on the western side of the ground. Phase Six Landscaping on the White Rose Stand and North East stand concourses. left Yorkshire County Cricket Club and Leeds Metropolitan University have collaborated in building the Headingley Carnegie Pavilion, which replaced 'The Shed' to the northern side of the Cricket Ground (which, dating from the early 1970s, was the oldest surviving structure). The new pavilion replaces 'The Winter Shed' and 'The Media Centre' at the Kirkstall Lane end of the ground, which had become obsolete, according to Yorkshire County Cricket Club, no longer meeting the requirements of modern broadcasting. The changing facilities are replaced by 'state of the art' changing facilities, designed specifically for cricket, while the new executive boxes will provide the expected level of service. Yorkshire County Cricket Clubs offices will also be relocated into the pavilion, which boasts environmentally friendly features such as a ground source heat pump and solar hot water heating. The rugby ground has also been significantly rebuilt since 2006, when the Carnegie Stand at the east end was opened containing both standing and seated areas, private boxes and catering. In 2017 both the North and South Stands were torn down following Leeds' last home game of the season: the new South Stand will be a two-tier structure similar to the Carnegie Stand with an expanded terrace, while the North Stand's replacement will feature additional executive boxes and state-of-the-art facilities for players, staff and media, as well as thousands of new seats for the cricket ground.

Though technically the band's debut album, it was not released in its entirety until 1996. History In August 1977 The Misfits released their debut single \\"Cough/Cool\\" on Blank Records, a label operated by the band's lead vocalist Glenn Danzig. Several months later Mercury Records issued a Pere Ubu record on their own Blank Records imprint, unaware that Danzig held a trademark on the name. The parties came to a settlement, with Danzig accepting thirty hours of studio time for his band in exchange for the rights to the Blank Records name. In January and February 1978 the Misfits, then consisting of Danzig, guitarist Franch√© Coma, bassist Jerry Only, and drummer Mr. Jim, recorded seventeen songs at C.I. Recordings in New York City with engineer and producer Dave Achelis. Due to time constraints, the band recorded the songs live in the studio with only a few takes and very few overdubs. Ultimately fourteen of the seventeen tracks produced during the sessions were assembled for the Misfits' anticipated debut album, to be titled Static Age. However, the band were unable to find a record label interested in releasing the album. Instead, the Misfits released four of the new tracks (\\"Bullet\\", \\"We Are 138\\", \\"Attitude\\", and \\"Hollywood Babylon\\") as the \\"Bullet\\" single in June 1978 on Danzig's newly created label Plan 9 Records (the same four tracks, along with a remixed version of \\"Last Caress\\", were reissued on the Beware EP in January 1980). While on tour in Canada that October, guitarist Franch√© Coma abruptly quit the band, followed by drummer Mr. Jim at the tour's conclusion. With the band's future far from certain, the Static Age recordings were shelved indefinitely. Danzig recruited new members Bobby Steele and Joey Image and the Misfits shifted their style away from the traditional punk rock of the Static Age sessions to a more horror film-inspired direction. None of the remaining Static Age tracks were released during the early era of the band, though a re- recorded version of \\"Teenagers from Mars\\" appeared on the \\"Horror Business\\" single in 1979, and a live version of \\"We Are 138\\" appeared on the Evilive EP in 1982. After the band's breakup in 1983, Danzig overdubbed guitar and bass tracks on nine of the unreleased Static Age tracks (\\"Static Age\\", \\"TV Casualty\\", \\"Hybrid Moments\\", \\"Come Back\\", \\"Some Kinda Hate\\", \\"Theme for a Jackal\\", \\"Angelfuck\\", \\"Spinal Remains\\", and \\"She\\"), releasing these new versions on the 1985 Legacy of Brutality compilation album. Misfits followed in 1986, reissuing the tracks \\"Bullet\\" and \\"Hollywood Babylon\\" as well as the overdubbed version of \\"She\\". Collection II (1995) reissued \\"We Are 138\\" and \\"Attitude\\", the remixed version of \\"Last Caress\\", and the previously unreleased \\"Return of the Fly\\". With the release of The Misfits box set in 1996, the complete original Static Age album saw the light of day for the first time, eighteen years after the songs were recorded. The box set included all three compilation albums as well as a disc with all fourteen Static Age tracks that had been mixed in 1978. The remaining three tracks, \\"She\\", \\"Spinal Remains\\", and \\"In the Doorway\\", were mixed by Alan Douches and Tom Bejgrowicz on February 24, 1997 at West West Side Music and were included when Static Age was finally released as a standalone album that July. \\"In the Doorway\\" had never before been released, as it had remained unmixed on the master tapes for nineteen years. The album also included an unlisted eighteenth track consisting of a collage of studio banter and outtakes. Songs Several of the songs on Static Age were based on horror films and American historical events from the 1960s and 1970s. \\"Return of the Fly\\" borrows its title from the 1959 film Return of the Fly, and most of the song's lyrics consist of repetition of the film's title, actors, and characters: \\"Return of the Fly, Return of the Fly/With Vincent Price/Helen Delambre, Helen Delambre/Fran√ßois, Fran√ßois/Cecile, Cecile\\". \\"Bullet\\" references the 1963 assassination of President John F. Kennedy, with sexually explicit lyrics directed at his wife Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis: \\"Texas is an outrage when your husband is dead/Texas is an outrage when they pick up his head/Texas is the reason that the President's dead/You gotta suck, suck, Jackie, suck\\". Although the subject of \\"She\\" is not mentioned in the lyrics, Misfits associate Eerie Von noted in The Misfits box set that the song was about Patty Hearst. The lyrics reference Hearst's participation in a San Francisco bank robbery in 1974: \\"She walked out with empty arms, machine gun in her hand/She is good and she is bad, no one understands/She walked in in silence, never spoke a word/She's got a rich daddy, she's her daddy's girl\\". \\"Hollywood Babylon\\" borrows its title from Kenneth Anger's 1959 book Hollywood Babylon. Influence Early in his amateur career, Mike Diana, who would later become the first American artist to be convicted of obscenity in the United States,\\"Mike Diana Talks to Richardson Magazine\\".

They may be of any breed or combination of breeds, though many have a significant amount of Thoroughbred breeding. They are called \\"ponies\\", but that is a reference to their agile type rather than their size; almost all are horse-sized. They require considerable training and ongoing conditioning, and because each rider requires several horses in a single match, this can be a considerable expense. For competition, polo ponies have their manes roached and tails braided so that there is no danger of being tangled in the mallet. Size Depending on time and location, the height of polo ponies has varied from about in the sixteenth century to modern horses of and over.Summerhayes, R S, Encyclopaedia for Horsemen, Frederick Warne & Co, London and New York Today, most polo ponies stand around , although it is not unusual to see a horse over 16 hands. Although they are called \\"ponies\\", this is a reference to their agile type rather than their size. True pony breeds typically stand a maximum of . Breeds Various breeds used include mountain ponies from the Himalayas, Manipur ponies from Manipur, Arabians and the ever-popular Thoroughbred and its crosses. In the United States, Thoroughbreds and Quarter Horses are often crossed to produce polo ponies, while in recent years crosses of Thoroughbreds and Criollo horses from Argentina have become popular.\\"What is a Polo Pony?\\" . SportPolo. Reference 5/19/08. In Australia, Australian Stock Horses are the most common breed used in polo.ASH Ministerial Statement Preparation Polo ponies need to be trained so that they are not afraid to bump into other horses, and not to shy at the ball or at mallets swinging near their heads. They need to be quick and agile so they can turn and follow the ball through its many movements. They also need to be in good physical condition; there are usually four to six chukkas per match, each chukka lasting seven and a half minutes, with the horse being on the move throughout. It is typical for a single player to have numerous horses available for each match, using a separate horse for each chukka, sometimes two. Thus there are significant costs of ownership and time required for exercise and conditioning of a polo string. Grooming Docked and banged tail on a polo pony, photographed between 1910 and 1915 A modern polo pony's tail prepared for competition Polo ponies have their manes hogged and their tails plaited up before a match, so that the polo mallet will not get tangled in them. Formerly, their tails would be docked and banged. Today, polo ponies in competition often have their dock trimmed or shaved, and the skirt of the tail is braided and folded up against the tailbone. The braid is tied off with a lock of hair excluded from the braid, taped, or tied off and taped.

Circa 1920. The Mle 1914 Hotchkiss machine gun chambered for the 8mm Lebel cartridge became the standard machine gun of the French Army during the latter half of World War I. It was manufactured by the French arms company Hotchkiss et Cie, which had been established in the 1860s by American industrialist Benjamin B. Hotchkiss. The gas-actuated Hotchkiss system was first formulated in 1893 by Odkolek von Ujezda and improved into its final form by Hotchkiss armament engineers, American Laurence Ben√©t and his French assistant Henri Merci√©. The Mle 1914 was the last version of a series of nearly identical Hotchkiss designs : the Mle 1897, Mle 1900 and the Mle 1909. The Hotchkiss Mle 1914 became the French infantry standard in late 1917, replacing the unreliable St. √âtienne Mle 1907. The American Expeditionary Forces (AEF) in France also purchased 7,000 Mle 1914 Hotchkiss machine guns in 8mm Lebel, and used them extensively at the front in 1917 and 1918. Hotchkiss heavy machine guns, some being of earlier types, were also used in combat by Japan, Chile, Mexico, Spain, Belgium, Brazil, and Poland. The Hotchkiss machine gun, a sturdy and reliable weapon, remained in active service with the French army until the early 1940s. By the end of 1918, 47,000 Hotchkiss machine guns had already been delivered to the French army alone. Including all international sales, the grand total of all Hotchkiss machine guns sold by the manufacturer in various calibers was well in excess of 100,000 units. History and design=Early models 8mm Lebel ammunition in a feed strip The Hotchkiss was based on a design by Captain Baron Adolf Odkolek von Ujezda of Vienna, first patented in July 1889 with further patents following in the following years, tested in 1893 in Saint-Denis, near Paris. The patents had been purchased in 1894‚Äì1895 by the firm of Benjamin Hotchkiss. Benjamin Hotchkiss was no longer alive at the time of the purchase, but the Odkolek design was further developed and greatly improved under the direction of American-born Laurence Vincent Ben√©t. In 1898 an export model was offered for international sales by Hotchkiss and sold to Brazil, Chile, Japan, Mexico, Norway and Venezuela that year. With some useful changes, such as the addition of five cooling radiator rings on the barrel, the same basic design led to the Mle 1900.The designation Model 1900 was coined by collectors and the design is older. The gun was tested in 1901 by two Chasseur battalions and in 1903‚Äì1904 with cavalry units. The French Army bought another 50 Hotchkiss machine guns in 1906 for comparative trials but adopted the more complex Puteaux Mle 1905 (upgraded as the St. √âtienne Mle 1907) to equip the infantry in 1907‚Äì1909. Nevertheless, 600 Mle 1900 machine guns were also purchased by the French military for use in overseas colonies Model 1914 At the beginning of the World War I, the Manufacture d'armes de Saint-√âtienne proved to be unable to produce enough St. Etienne machine guns. The French military forces chose to adopt the Hotchkiss Mle 1900 with some minor modifications, as the Mitrailleuse Automatique mod√®le 1914. The Hotchkiss gun is initially supplied to second-line troops but in 1916 front- line units began to use the Mle 1914. That year, a parliamentary committee of inquiry concluded that the Hotchkiss was more reliable than the St. Etienne and the production of the latter was stopped.  Design  The Hotchkiss machine gun was gas actuated and air-cooled, in contrast to the Maxim gun which was recoil operated and water-cooled. The Hotchkiss machine gun barrel features five large rings which materially assisted natural cooling and retarded overheating. The gas cylinder under the barrel features a regulator piston which can be adjusted to the normal rate of fire of 450 rounds per minute. The Hotchkiss machine gun itself (excluding the tripod) has only 32 parts, including four coil springs, and no screws or pins whatsoever.Handbook of the Hotchkiss Machine Gun, Model of 1914 US War Department All parts of the gun are constructed in such a manner that it is impossible to assemble them improperly. The Hotchkiss fired from an open bolt, like almost all modern machine guns, in order to avoid \\"cook-offs\\" ‚Äì cartridges being prematurely ignited by the overheated chamber. Although the Hotchkiss machine gun was easy to feed continuously with a three-man team, each individual strip held only 24 rounds of 8mm Lebel ammunition. This feature proved to be one of the Hotchkiss's shortcomings, as the crew needed to reload the gun several times for every minute of firing, far more often than on every other machine gun of the same period (the Maxim used a 250-round continuous cloth belt). Each empty feed strip was ejected automatically after its last round had been fired, leaving the bolt open in the rear position. Then introducing a new loaded strip into the gun triggered the release forward of the bolt and firing resumed. The Hotchkiss strips performed well with a three-man crew, but their capacity was too small for a single gunner firing from the inside of a tank. This led to the adoption of a 250-round articulated metal belt in 1917. It was widely used in all French tanks of the period and in some military airplanes. Beginning in 1900, two basic tripod types were used prior to World War I, when the final and most effective third Hotchkiss tripod model (the Mle 1916) became adopted and widely distributed. A tripod that could be used for both the Hotchkiss and the St. Etienne machine guns was issued in 1915, the so- called \\"Omnibus Tripod\\". The French Hotchkiss had a rate of fire of approximately 450 rounds per minute of 8 mm Lebel ammunition, and a maximum effective range of 3,800 m (4,150 yd) with the \\"Balle D\\" bullet. Fire for effect was usually in successive bursts of 8 to 10 rounds. The gun could sustain continuous firing of about 120 aimed shots per minute almost indefinitely, except for occasional barrel changes (during continuous fire, approximately every 1,000 rounds) which were quick and easy to perform with a special wrench. The barrel could attain a temperature of about 400 ¬∞C, at which temperature it would be dark red in color. At this point the barrel dissipated heat as fast as it was generated. This only occurred after long continuous firing in a combat emergency situation. The most common complaint about the Hotchkiss was its weight: the gun and tripod weighed a total of 110 pounds. There were also complaints concerning the tripods, particularly the \\"Omnibus\\" tripods, which were perceived as too high above ground and too heavy. Service history=World War I  U.S. Army soldiers operating the Mle 1914 Hotchkiss gun in France, 1918. The principal user of the Mle 1914 Hotchkiss machine gun was the French infantry during World War I and the early days of World War II. The Hotchkiss company delivered 47,000 Mle 1914 machine guns to the French Army between 1914 and the end of 1918. Several hundred were chambered in 11mm Gras for use against enemy balloons,as that was the smallest caliber of incendiary bullet; all other French examples were in 8mm Lebel. The second-largest user of the Hotchkiss was the American Expeditionary Force in France between 1917 and 1918, with the US purchasing and deploying 7,000 Hotchkiss machine guns during the war. Naval Service  The Mle 1914 Hotchkiss was used by the Marine Nationale during the inter-war period, primarily on the twin Mle 1926 mount. It was replaced in service by the Hotchkiss Mle 1929 as it became available. During World War II some of these mountings were returned to service to try and compensate for the slow production of larger and more capable weapons, along with newer 7.5mm machine guns like the Darne. An early Japanese version in 6.5x50mm. Japanese version Type 3 (Taish≈ç 14) Heavy Machine Gun. Mus√©e de l'Arm√©e, Paris. During the Boxer Rebellion, Japanese forces acquired a French Mle 1897. Japan acquired a license and began producing Hotchkiss Mle 1897 machine guns in 6.5x50mm Arisaka caliber. During the Russo-Japanese War, each Japanese division had 24 Hotchkiss machine guns. Being lighter than the Russian Maxims, the Hotchkiss performed well. The production evolved to become the Type 3 Heavy Machine Gun in 1914. The Type 92 Heavy Machine Gun, a scaled-up Type 3 chambered for 7.7mm, was also based on the Hotchkiss design. In China In 1930 to 1935, the Republic of China bought 1,192 Hotchkiss Mle 1914 machine guns from France. The Chinese also copied this gun and used the German 7.92√ó57mm Mauser. After the Second Sino-Japanese War broke out in 1937, China ordered 1,300 more guns, but only 300 guns were delivered. It was also used during the Chinese Civil War.  In Czechoslovakia  In 1919‚Äì1920, Czechoslovakia bought 855 Mle 1914s from France and received another 89 from the Czechoslovak Legion in France. 985 Hotchkiss Mle 1914 machine guns were in service within the Czechoslovak Army at the end of 1920 and 929 were still recorded in 1938.  In Poland  ckm wz. 25 machine gun crew during exercise, 1931 Poland received its first Mle 1914 Hotchkiss machine guns together with the arrival of the Blue Army in 1919. During and after the Polish-Bolshevik War the Polish Army bought additional guns in France and by 1936 there were 2,620 guns in Polish service (used under the ckm wz. 14 - \\"HMG Mk. 1914\\"). In the mid-1920s the army ordered 1,250 guns of a slightly modified version rechambered to the standard 7.92√ó57mm Mauser calibre. However, the army found that the newly delivered machine guns, dubbed ckm wz.25 Hotchkiss were substandard: the barrel was prone to overheating and the accuracy was found to be too low. Instead of trying to renegotiate the contract with Hotchkiss, the Polish General Staff ordered large numbers of Ckm wz.30 machine guns instead and both 1914 and 1925 models of Hotchkiss were withdrawn from infantry service by 1936. Some were sold abroad; many were modified to arm the Renault FT tanks, TK-3 and TKS tankettes, and Samoch√≥d pancerny wz. 29 and wz. 34 armored cars. During the Invasion of Poland of 1939, the wz. 25 and wz. 14 machine guns were nevertheless used in combat by some Polish infantry units, notably the Border Defence Corps and National Defense.  In Spain  Spain bought the license of the Hotchkiss machine gun Model 1903, firing the 7√ó57mm Mauser ammunition. Adopted as the standard heavy machine gun of the Spanish Army, it was built at Oviedo. 2,000 were in service when the Civil War broke and they were widely used by the conflicting parties involved. This machine gun also saw action during the Ifni War in 1957-1958. Other countries Hotchkiss machine guns firing 7 mm Mauser ammunition equipped both sides (government and rebels) during the Mexican Revolution (1911‚Äì1920). Furthermore, the Mle 1914 Hotchkiss in 8 mm Lebel was mounted in all French tanks and armored cars of World War I. Some examples of tanks that used the Mle 1914 Hotchkiss include the Schneider CA1, Saint- Chamond, Renault FT and Char 2C. Conversely, British tanks and armored cars were fitted with the distinctly different Mle 1909 light Hotchkiss (a.k.a. the \\"Ben√©t‚ÄìMerci√©\\"). A recently published series of modern firing tests with vintage machine guns summarizes the Mle 1914 Hotchkiss as being: \\"A heavy and rock-steady combination of gun and tripod, the world's first efficient air cooled machine gun is admirably reliable and accurate\\" (Robert Bruce, 1997). These qualities provided the French military with an excuse to keep the Hotchkiss in active service far beyond its point of obsolescence and into World War II. The last recorded uses of the Hotchkiss by the French Army were in Indochina and Algeria, after World War II, to defend outposts in static positions. It is said to have been used by Communist forces in Korean and Vietnam Wars.

In the absence of a deacon, it may be sung by a priest or by a cantor. It is sung after a procession with the paschal candle before the beginning of the Liturgy of the Word. It is also used in Anglican and various Lutheran churches, as well as other Western Christian denominations.  History  Since the 1955 revision of the Holy Week rites, the Roman Missal explicitly gives the title Praeconium (proclamation or praise) to the Exsultet, as it already did implicitly in the formula it provided for blessing the deacon before the chant: ut digne et competenter annunties suum Paschale praeconium. Outside Rome, use of the paschal candle appears to have been a very ancient tradition in Italy, Gaul, Spain and perhaps, from the reference by St. Augustine (De Civ. Dei, XV, xxii), in Africa. The Liber Pontificalis attributes to Pope Zosimus its introduction in the local church in Rome. The formula used for the Praeconium was not always the Exsultet, though it is perhaps true to say that this formula has survived, where other contemporary formulae have disappeared. In the Liber Ordinum, for instance, the formula is of the nature of a benediction, and the Gelasian Sacramentary has the prayer Deus mundi conditor, not found elsewhere, but containing the remarkable \\"praise of the bee\\"‚Äîpossibly a Vergilian reminiscence‚Äîwhich is found with more or less modification in all the texts of the Praeconium down to the present. The regularity of the metrical cursus of the Exsultet would lead us to place the date of its composition perhaps as early as the fifth century, and not later than the seventh. The earliest manuscripts in which it appears are those of the three Gallican Sacramentaries: the Bobbio Missal (7th century), the Missale Gothicum and the Missale Gallicanum Vetus (both of the 8th century). The earliest manuscript of the Gregorian Sacramentary (Vat. Reg. 337) does not contain the Exsultet, but it was added in the supplement to what has been loosely called the Sacramentary of Adrian, and probably drawn up under the direction of Alcuin. As it stands in the liturgy, it may be compared with two other forms, the blessing of palms on Palm Sunday, and the blessing of the baptismal font at the Easter Vigil. The order is, briefly: * An invitation to those present to join with the deacon in invoking the blessing of God, that the praises of the candle may be worthily celebrated. This invitation, wanting in the two blessings just mentioned, may be likened to an amplified Orate fratres, and its antiquity is attested by its presence in the Ambrosian form, which otherwise differs from the Roman. This section closes with the per omnia saecula saeculorum, leading into . . . *Dominus vobiscum etc., Sursum corda etc., Gratias agamus etc. This section serves as the introduction to the body of the Praeconium, cast in the Eucharistic form to emphasize its solemnity. * The Praeconium proper, which is of the nature of a Preface, or, as it is called in the Missale Gallicanum Vetus, a contestatio. First, a parallel is drawn between the Passover of the Old and the New Covenants, the candle corresponding to the Pillar of Fire. Here the language of the liturgy rises to heights to which it is hard to find a parallel in Christian literature. Through the outlines of ancient dogmas as through a portal we are drawn into the warmth of the deepest mysticism, to the region where, in the light of paradise, even the sin of Adam may be regarded as truly necessary and a happy fault. Secondly, the candle itself is offered as a burnt-sacrifice, a type of Christ, marked by grains of incense as with the five glorious wounds of his Passion. In pre-1970 forms of the Roman Rite the deacon or, if there is no deacon, the priest himself, puts off his violet vestments and wears a white or gold dalmatic for the entry into the church with the paschal candle and the singing or recitation of the Exsultet, resuming the violet vestments immediately afterwards. In the later form, white vestments are worn throughout. The affixing, in the pre-1955 form of the Roman Rite, of five grains of incense at the words incensi hujus sacrificium was removed in Pope Pius XII's revision. The chant is usually an elaborate form of the well-known recitative of the preface. In some uses a long bravura was introduced upon the word accendit, to fill in the pause, which must otherwise occur while, in the pre-1955 form of the rite, the deacon is lighting the candle. In Italy the Praeconium was sung from long strips of parchment, gradually unrolled as the deacon proceeded. These \\"Exsultet Rolls\\" were decorated with illuminations and with the portraits of contemporary reigning sovereigns, whose names were mentioned in the course of the Praeconium. The use of these rolls, as far as is known at present, was confined to Italy. The best examples date from the tenth and eleventh centuries.Kelly, T. F. The Exultet in Southern Italy. New York, Oxford University Press, 1996 The beginning of the Exsultet in the Liber Usualis  Roman Catholic English and Latin text  English text Exult, let them exult, the hosts of heaven, exult, let Angel ministers of God exult, let the trumpet of salvation sound aloud our mighty King's triumph! Be glad, let earth be glad, as glory floods her, ablaze with light from her eternal King, let all corners of the earth be glad, knowing an end to gloom and darkness. Rejoice, let Mother Church also rejoice, arrayed with the lightning of his glory, let this holy building shake with joy, filled with the mighty voices of the peoples. (Therefore, dearest friends, standing in the awesome glory of this holy light, invoke with me, I ask you, the mercy of God almighty, that he, who has been pleased to number me, though unworthy, among the Levites, may pour into me his light unshadowed, that I may sing this candle's perfect praises). (Deacon: The Lord be with you. People: And with your spirit.) Deacon: Lift up your hearts. People: We lift them up to the Lord. Deacon: Let us give thanks to the Lord our God. People: It is right and just. It is truly right and just, with ardent love of mind and heart and with devoted service of our voice, to acclaim our God invisible, the almighty Father, and Jesus Christ, our Lord, his Son, his Only Begotten. Who for our sake paid Adam's debt to the eternal Father, and, pouring out his own dear Blood, wiped clean the record of our ancient sinfulness. These, then, are the feasts of Passover, in which is slain the Lamb, the one true Lamb, whose Blood anoints the doorposts of believers. This is the night, when once you led our forebears, Israel's children, from slavery in Egypt and made them pass dry-shod through the Red Sea. This is the night that with a pillar of fire banished the darkness of sin. This is the night that even now throughout the world, sets Christian believers apart from worldly vices and from the gloom of sin, leading them to grace and joining them to his holy ones. This is the night when Christ broke the prison-bars of death and rose victorious from the underworld. Our birth would have been no gain, had we not been redeemed. O wonder of your humble care for us! O love, O charity beyond all telling, to ransom a slave you gave away your Son! O truly necessary sin of Adam, destroyed completely by the Death of Christ! O happy fault that earned for us so great, so glorious a Redeemer! O truly blessed night, worthy alone to know the time and hour when Christ rose from the underworld! This is the night of which it is written: The night shall be as bright as day, dazzling is the night for me, and full of gladness. The sanctifying power of this night dispels wickedness, washes faults away, restores innocence to the fallen, and joy to mourners, drives out hatred, fosters concord, and brings down the mighty. On this, your night of grace, O holy Father, accept this candle, a solemn offering, the work of bees and of your servants' hands, an evening sacrifice of praise, this gift from your most holy Church. But now we know the praises of this pillar, which glowing fire ignites for God's honour, a fire into many flames divided, yet never dimmed by sharing of its light, for it is fed by melting wax, drawn out by mother bees to build a torch so precious. O truly blessed night, when things of heaven are wed to those of earth, and divine to the human. Therefore, O Lord, we pray you that this candle, hallowed to the honour of your name, may persevere undimmed, to overcome the darkness of this night. Receive it as a pleasing fragrance, and let it mingle with the lights of heaven. May this flame be found still burning by the Morning Star: the one Morning Star who never sets, Christ your Son, who, coming back from death's domain, has shed his peaceful light on humanity, and lives and reigns for ever and ever.

R/ Amen.The Exultant Praise of the Easter ProclamationPaschal Proclamation (Exsultet). Third Edition of the Roman MissalThe Blessing of the Fire and the Preparation of the Candle Prayer for the Emperor Until 1955, the Exsultet ended with a long prayer for the (Holy Roman) Emperor: :Respice etiam ad devotissimum imperatorem nostrum [Nomen] cujus tu, Deus, desiderii vota praenoscens, ineffabili pietatis et misericordiae tuae munere, tranquillum perpetuae pacis accommoda, et coelestem victoriam cum omni populo suo. :Look also upon our most devout Emperor [Name], the desires of whose longing you, O God, know beforehand, and by the inexpressible grace of your kindness and mercy grant him the tranquillity of lasting peace and heavenly victory with all his people. Only the head of the Holy Roman Empire could be prayed for with this formula, and with the resignation in 1806 of the last emperor, Francis II of Austria, the prayer was in practice not used. The prayer now ended with the immediately preceding petition, for the members of the Church: :Precamur ergo te, Domine: ut nos famulos tuos, omnemque clerum, et devotissimum populum: una cum beatissimo Papa nostro N. et Antistite nostro N. quiete temporum assidua protectione regere, gubernare, et conservare digneris. After Pope Pius IX's Imperii Galliarum of 10 September 1857, Emperor Napoleon III of France would be prayed for from 1858 to 1870 by adding necnon gloriosissimo Imperatore nostro N. to this ending, which became: :Precamur ergo te, Domine: ut nos famulos tuos, omnemque clerum, et devotissimum populum: una cum beatissimo Papa nostro N. et Antistite nostro N. necnon gloriosissimo Imperatore nostro N. quiete temporum assidua protectione regere, gubernare, et conservare digneris. In 1955 Pope Pius XII added a phrase to the prayer for the members of the Church and definitively removed the prayer for the Holy Roman Emperor, replacing it with a generic prayer for the civil authorities inspired by the prayer for the Emperor: :Precamur ergo te, Domine: ut nos famulos tuos, omnemque clerum, et devotissimum populum: una cum beatissimo Papa nostro N. et Antistite nostro N. quiete temporum concessa, in his paschalibus gaudiis, assidua protectione regere, gubernare, et conservare digneris. Respice etiam ad eos, qui nos in potestate regunt, et, ineffabili pietatis et misericordiae tuae munere, dirige cogitationes eorum ad iustitiam et pacem, ut de terrena operositate ad caelestem patriam perveniant cum omni populo tuo. This was removed in the 1970 revision, but remains in use in the extraordinary form of the Roman Rite. All ends with the formula: :Per eundem Dominum Nostrum Iesum Christum filium tuum, qui tecum vivit et regnat in unitate Spiritus Sancti, Deus, per omnia saecula saeculorum. Amen. Anglican text The following is an example of an Anglican text of the Exsultet, taken from the Book of Common Prayer of the Episcopal Church in the United States. The paschal candle is placed in its stand. Then the deacon, or other person appointed, standing near the candle, sings or says the Exsultet as follows (the sections in brackets may be omitted): Rejoice now, heavenly hosts and choirs of angels, and let your trumpets shout Salvation for the victory of our mighty King. Rejoice and sing now, all the round earth, bright with a glorious splendor, for darkness has been vanquished by our eternal King. Rejoice and be glad now, Mother Church, and let your holy courts, in radiant light, resound with the praises of your people. (All you who stand near this marvelous and holy flame, pray with me to God the Almighty for the grace to sing the worthy praise of this great light; through Jesus Christ his Son our Lord, who lives and reigns with him, in the unity of the Holy Spirit, one God, for ever and ever. Amen.) Deacon: The Lord be with you. Answer: And also with you. Deacon: Let us give thanks to the Lord our God. Answer: It is right to give him thanks and praise. Deacon: It is truly right and good, always and everywhere, with our whole heart and mind and voice, to praise you, the invisible, almighty, and eternal God, and your only-begotten Son, Jesus Christ our Lord; for he is the true Paschal Lamb, who at the feast of the Passover paid for us the debt of Adam's sin, and by his blood delivered your faithful people. This is the night, when you brought our fathers, the children of Israel, out of bondage in Egypt, and led them through the Red Sea on dry land. This is the night, when all who believe in Christ are delivered from the gloom of sin, and are restored to grace and holiness of life. This is the night, when Christ broke the bonds of death and hell, and rose victorious from the grave. (How wonderful and beyond our knowing, O God, is your mercy and loving-kindness to us, that to redeem a slave, you gave a Son. How holy is this night, when wickedness is put to flight, and sin is washed away. It restores innocence to the fallen, and joy to those who mourn. It casts out pride and hatred, and brings peace and concord. How blessed is this night, when earth and heaven are joined and man is reconciled to God.) Holy Father, accept our evening sacrifice, the offering of this candle in your honor. May it shine continually to drive away all darkness. May Christ, the Morning Star who knows no setting, find it ever burning‚Äîhe who gives his light to all creation, and who lives and reigns for ever and ever. Amen. It is customary that the Paschal Candle burn at all services from Easter Day through the Day of Pentecost. Lutheran text The following is an example form of the Lutheran Exsultet, taken from the Lutheran Service Book. This version, or a similar translation, may be used in various Lutheran denominations. [After the candle bearer places the paschal candle in its stand, the cantor, deacon, or assisting minister turns to face the people and chants the Exsultet.] :Rejoice now, all you heavenly choirs of angels; :Rejoice now, all creation; :Sound forth, trumpet of salvation, :And proclaim the triumph of our King. :Rejoice too, all the earth, :In the radiance of the light now poured upon you :And made brilliant by the brightness of the everlasting King; :Know that the ancient darkness has been forever banished. :Rejoice, O Church of Christ, :Clothed in the brightness of this light; :Let all this house of God ring out with rejoicing, :With the praises of all God's faithful people. [The following exchange between the presiding pastor and the congregation takes place.] :The Lord be with you. :And with your spirit. :Lift up your hearts. :We lift them up to the Lord. :Let us give thanks to the Lord, our God. :It is right and just. [The presiding pastor then chants or speaks the conclusion of the Exsultet.] :It is truly good, right, and salutary :That we should at all times and in all places, :With all our heart and mind and voice, :Praise You, O Lord, Holy Father, almighty everlasting God, :And your only begotten Son, :Jesus Christ. :For He is the very Paschal Lamb :Who offered Himself for the sin of the world, :Who has cleansed us by the shedding of His precious blood. :This is the night :When You brought our fathers, the children of Israel, :Out of bondage in Egypt :And led them through the Red Sea on dry ground. :This is the night :When all who believe in Christ :Are delivered from bondage to sin :And are restored to life and immortality. :This is the night :When Christ, the Life, rose from the dead. :The seal of the grave is broken :And the morning of a new creation breaks forth out of night. :How wonderful and beyond all telling is Your mercy toward us, O God, :That to redeem a slave You gave Your Son. :How holy is this night :When all wickedness is put to flight :And sin is washed away. :How holy is this night :When innocence is restored to the fallen :And joy is given to those downcast. :How blessed is this night :When man is reconciled to God in Christ. :Holy Father, :Accept now the evening sacrifices of our thanksgiving and praise. :Let Christ, the true light and morning star, shine in our hearts, :He who gives light to all creation, :Who lives and reigns with You and the Holy Spirit, :One God, now and forever. :Amen. The version authorized by the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America and published in Evangelical Lutheran Worship (2006) retains the wording about the candle and the bees: :Therefore in this night of grace, :receive, O God, our praise and thanksgiving :for the light of the resurrection of our Lord Jesus Christ, :reflected in the burning of this candle. :We sing the glories of this pillar of fire, :the brightness of which is not diminished :even when its light is divided and borrowed. :for it is fed by the melting wax which the bees, your servants, :have made for the substance of this candle.Evangelical Lutheran Worship Leaders Desk Edition.(Minneapolis: Augsburg Fortress, 2006) page 647  Methodist text  The text of the Easter Proclamation contained in The United Methodist Book of Worship is chanted by a deacon after the procession into the church with the Paschal Candle: ReferencesExternal links *Illuminated Manuscript of a Medieval Exultet from Bari in Italy * *Chant notation from the 1970 Missale Romanum Church Music Association of America *Post 2010 version of the Exsultet as published by the ICEL Category:Christian liturgical music Category:Latin-language Christian hymns Category:Latin religious words and phrases Category:Catholic liturgy Category:Lutheran liturgy and worship ","title":"Exsultet"},{"id":"1876147","title":"Military history of India"},{"id":"1876159","text":"Plates in the crust of the earth, according to the plate tectonics theory The geology of India is diverse. Different regions of India contain rocks belonging to different geologic periods, dating as far back as the Eoarchean Era. Some of the rocks are very deformed and altered. Other deposits include recently deposited alluvium that has yet to undergo diagenesis. Mineral deposits of great variety are found in the Indian subcontinent in huge quantity. Even India's fossil record is impressive in which stromatolites, invertebrates, vertebrates and plant fossils are included. India's geographical land area can be classified into the Deccan Traps, Gondwana and Vindhyan. The Deccan Traps covers almost all of Maharashtra, a part of Gujarat, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh and Andhra Pradesh marginally. During its journey northward after breaking off from the rest of Gondwana, the Indian Plate passed over a geologic hotspot, the R√©union hotspot, which caused extensive melting underneath the Indian Craton. The melting broke through the surface of the craton in a massive flood basalt event, creating the Deccan Traps. It is also thought that the Reunion hotspot caused the separation of Madagascar and India. The Gondwana and Vindhyan include within its fold parts of Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Odisha, Bihar, Jharkhand, West Bengal, Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra, Jammu and Kashmir, Punjab, Himachal Pradesh, Rajasthan and Uttarakhand. The Gondwana sediments form a unique sequence of fluviatile rocks deposited in Permo-Carboniferous time. The Damodar and Sone river valleys and Rajmahal hills in eastern India contain a record of the Gondwana rocks. The Geological Survey of India has published the List of National Geological Monuments in India.national geo-heritage of India, INTACH Plate tectonics The Indian Craton was once part of the supercontinent of Pangaea. At that time, what is now India's southwest coast was attached to Madagascar and southern Africa, and what is now its east coast was attached to Australia. During the Jurassic Period about 160 Ma (ICS 2004), rifting caused Pangaea to break apart into two supercontinents, namely Gondwana (to the south) and Laurasia (to the north). The Indian Craton remained attached to Gondwana, until the supercontinent began to rift apart about in the early Cretaceous, about 125 million years ago (ICS 2004). The Indian Plate then drifted northward toward the Eurasian Plate, at a pace that is the fastest known movement of any plate. It is generally believed that the Indian Plate separated from Madagascar about 90 Million years ago (ICS 2004), however some biogeographical and geological evidence suggests that the connection between Madagascar and Africa was retained at the time when the Indian Plate collided with the Eurasian Plate about 50 Million years ago (ICS 2004).Briggs, John C. (2003) The biogeographic and tectonic history of India. Journal of Biogeography 30:381‚Äì388 This orogeny, which is continuing today, is related to closure of the Tethys Ocean. The closure of this ocean which created the Alps in Europe, and the Caucasus range in western Asia, created the Himalaya Mountains and the Tibetan Plateau in South Asia. The current orogenic event is causing parts of the Asian continent to deform westward and eastward on either side of the orogen. Concurrently with this collision, the Indian Plate sutured on to the adjacent Australian Plate, forming a new larger plate, the Indo- Australian Plate. Tectonic evolution Due to continental drift, the India Plate split from Madagascar and collided with the Eurasian Plate resulting in the formation of the Himalayas. The earliest phase of tectonic evolution was marked by the cooling and solidification of the upper crust of the earth's surface in the Archaean Era (prior to 2.5 billion years) which is represented by the exposure of gneisses and granites especially on the Peninsula. These form the core of the Indian Craton. The Aravalli Range is the remnant of an early Proterozoic orogen called the Aravali-Delhi Orogen that joined the two older segments that make up the Indian Craton. It extends approximately from its northern end to isolated hills and rocky ridges into Haryana, ending near Delhi. Minor igneous intrusions, deformation (folding and faulting) and subsequent metamorphism of the Aravalli Mountains represent the main phase of orogenesis. The erosion of the mountains, and further deformation of the sediments of the Dharwarian group (Bijawars) marks the second phase. The volcanic activities and intrusions, associated with this second phase are recorded in the composition of these sediments. Early to Late Proterozoic(2.5 to 0.54 billion years) calcareous and arenaceous deposits, which correspond to humid and semi-arid climatic regimes, were deposited the Cuddapah and Vindhyan basins. These basins which border or lie within the existing crystalline basement, were uplifted during the Cambrian (500 Ma (ICS 2004)). The sediments are generally undeformed and have in many places preserved their original horizontal stratification. The Vindhyans are believed to have been deposited between ~1700 and 650 Ma (ICS 2004).Ray, J.S., Journal of Earth System Science, February 2006 Early Paleozoic rocks are found in the Himalayas and consist of southerly derived sediments eroded from the crystalline craton and deposited on the Indian platform. In the Late Paleozoic, Permo-Carboniferous glaciations left extensive glacio-fluvial deposits across central India, in new basins created by sag/normal faulting. These tillites and glacially derived sediments are designated the Gondwanas series. The sediments are overlain by rocks resulting from a Permian marine transgression (270 Ma (ICS 2004)). The late Paleozoic coincided with the deformation and drift of the Gondwana supercontinent. To this drift, the uplift of the Vindhyan sediments and the deposition of northern peripheral sediments in the Himalayan Sea, can be attributed. During the Jurassic, as Pangea began to rift apart, large grabens formed in central India filling with Upper Jurassic and Lower Cretaceous sandstones and conglomerates. By the Late Cretaceous India had separated from Australia and Africa and was moving northward towards Asia. At this time, prior to the Deccan eruptions, uplift in southern India resulted in sedimentation in the adjacent nascent Indian Ocean. Exposures of these rocks occur along the south Indian coast at Pondicherry and in Tamil Nadu. At the close of the Mesozoic one of the greatest volcanic eruptions in earth's history occurred, the Deccan lava flows. Covering more than area, these mark the final break from Gondwana. In the early Tertiary, the first phase of the Himalayan orogeny, the Karakoram phase occurred. The Himalayan orogeny has continued to the present day. Greater India Greater India or the Greater India Basin means the Indian Plate plus a postulated northern extension which was squashed out of easy recognizability in the Indian‚ÄìAsia collision. The term was used before plate tectonic theory,Argand, E., 1924. La tectonique de l' Asie. Proc. 13th Int. Geol. Cong. 7 (1924), 171‚Äì372. but the term has seen increased usage since the 1970s. The Indian plate and the Eurasian Plate have converged up to ¬± . The upper crustal shortening is documented from the geological record of Asia and the Himalaya as up to approximately less. Much of the lost area was pushed under Asia to form the Tibetan highland. Major rock groups Map of chronostratigraphic divisions of India thumb Precambrian super-eon A considerable area of peninsular India, the Indian Shield, consists of Archean gneisses and schists which are the oldest rocks found in India. The Precambrian rocks of India have been classified into two systems, namely the Dharwar system and the Archaean system. The Dharwar System The rocks of the Dharwar system are mainly sedimentary in origin, and occur in narrow elongated synclines resting on the gneisses found in Bellary district, Mysore and the Aravalis of Rajputana. These rocks are enriched in manganese and iron ore which represents a significant resource of these metals. They are also extensively mineralised with gold most notably the Kolar gold mines located in Kolar. In the north and west of India, the Vaikrita system, which occurs in Hundes, Kumaon and Spiti areas, the Dailing series in Sikkim and the Shillong series in Assam are believed to be of the same age as the Dharwar system. The metamorphic basement consists of gneisses which are further classified into the Bengal gneiss, the Bundelkhand gneiss and the Nilgiri gneiss. The Nilgiri system comprises charnockites ranging from granites to gabbros. PhanerozoicPalaeozoicLower Paleozoic Rocks of the earliest part of the Cambrian Period are found in the Salt range in Punjab and the Spiti area in the central Himalayas and consist of a thick sequence of fossiliferous sediments. In the Salt range, the stratigraphy starts with the Salt Pseudomorph zone, which has a thickness of and consists of dolomites and sandstones. It is overlain by magnesian sandstones with a thickness of , similar to the underlying dolomites. These sandstones have very few fossils. Overlying the sandstones is the Neobolus Shale, which is composed of dark shales with a thickness of . Finally there is a zone consisting of red or purple sandstones having a thickness of to called the Purple Sandstone. These are unfossiliferous and show sun-cracks and worm burrows which are typical of subaerial weathering. The deposits in Spiti are known as the Haimanta system and they consist of slates, micaceous quartzite and dolomitic limestones. The Ordovician rocks comprise flaggy shales, limestones, red quartzites, quartzites, sandstones and conglomerates. Siliceous limestones belonging to the Silurian overlie the Ordovician rocks. These limestones are in turn overlain by white quartzite and this is known as Muth quartzite. Silurian rocks which contain typical Silurian fauna are also found in the Vihi district of Kashmir. Upper Paleozoic Devonian fossils and corals are found in grey limestone in the central Himalayas and in black limestone in the Chitral area. The Carboniferous is composed of two distinct sequences, the upper Carboniferous Po, and the lower Carboniferous Lipak. Fossils of brachiopods and some trilobites are found in the calcareous and sandy rocks of the Lipak series. The Syringothyris limestone in Kashmir also belongs to the Lipak. The Po series overlies the Lipak series, and the Fenestella shales are interbedded within a sequence of quartzites and dark shales. In many places Carboniferous strata are overlaid by grey agglomeratic slates, believed to be of volcanic origin. Many genera of productids are found in the limestones of the Permo-Triassic, which has led to these rocks being referred to as \\"productus limestone\\". This limestone is of marine origin and is divided into three distinct lithostratigraphic units based on the productus chronology: the Late Permian Chideru, which contains many ammonites, the Late ‚Äî Middle Permian Virgal, and the Middle Permian Amb unit. =Mesozoic= In the Triassic the Ceratite beds, named after the ammonite ceratite, consist of arenaceous limestones, calcerous sandstones and marls. The Jurassic consists of two distinct units. The Kioto limestone, extends from the lower the middle Jurassic with a thickness to . The upper Jurassic is represented by the Spiti black shales, and stretches from the Karakoram to Sikkim. Cretaceous rocks cover an extensive area in India. In South India, the sedimentary rocks are divided into four stages; the Niniyur, the Ariyalur, the Trichinopoly(a district in the Madras Presidency, covering present-day districts of Tiruchirappalli, Karur, Ariyalur and Perambalur), and the Utatur stages. In the Utatur stage the rocks host phosphatic nodules, which constitute an important source of phosphates in the country. In the central provinces, the well developed beds of Lameta contain fossil records which are helpful in estimating the age of the Deccan Traps. This sequence of basaltic rocks was formed near the end of the Cretaceous period due to volcanic activity. These lava flows occupy an area of . These rocks are a source of high quality building stone and also provide a very fertile clayey loam, particularly suited to cotton cultivation. =CenozoicTertiary period In this period the Himalayan orogeny began, and the volcanism associated with the Deccan Traps continued. The rocks of this era have valuable deposits of petroleum and coal. Sandstones of Eocene age are found in Punjab, which grade into chalky limestones with oil seepages. Further north the rocks found in the Simla area are divided into three series, the Sabathu series consisting of grey and red shales, the Dagshai series comprising bright red clays and the Kasauli series comprising sandstones. Towards the east in Assam, Nummulitic limestone is found in the Khasi hills. Oil is associated with these rocks of the Oligo-Miocene age. Along the foothills of the Himalayas the Siwalik molasse is composed of sandstones, conglomerates and shales with thicknesses of to and ranging from Eocene to Pliocene. These rocks are famous for their rich fossil vertebrate fauna including many fossil hominoids. Quaternary period The alluvium which is found in the Indo-Gangetic plain belongs to this era. It was eroded from the Himalayas by the rivers and the monsoons. These alluvial deposits consist of clay, loam, silt etc. and are divided into the older alluvium and the newer alluvium. The older alluvium is called Bhangar and is present in the ground above the flood level of the rivers. Khaddar or newer alluvium is confined to the river channels and their flood plains. This region has some of the most fertile soil found in the country as new silt is continually laid down by the rivers every year.  Earthquakes  The Indian subcontinent has a history of devastating earthquakes. The major reason for the high frequency and intensity of the earthquakes is that the Indian plate is driving into Asia at a rate of approximately 47 mm/year. Geographical statistics of India show that almost 54% of the land is vulnerable to earthquakes. A World Bank & United Nations report shows estimates that around 200 million city dwellers in India will be exposed to storms and earthquakes by 2050. National Disaster Management Authority says that 60% of Indian landmass is prone to earthquake and 8% susceptible to cyclone risks.

It is played by teams of 12 nominated players out of fifteen, of which nine enter the field who sit on their knees (chasing team), and 3 extra (defending team) who try to avoid being touched by members of the opposing team. It is one of the two most popular traditional tag games in the Indian subcontinent, the other being Kabaddi. The sport is widely played across South Asia and has a strong presence in South Africa and England. Kho-kho is a traditional Indian sport a form of tag, that is one of the oldest forms of outdoor sport, dating back to prehistoric India. It is played most often by school children in India and Pakistan and is a competitive game.  Etymology  The name comes from (), the word kho is imitative of the sound invoked while playing the game. History The origin of Kho-Kho is very difficult to trace, but many historians believe that it is a modified form of 'Run Chase', which in its simplest form involves chasing and touching a person. Originating in Maharashtra, Kho-Kho in ancient times was played on 'raths' or chariots and was known as Rathera.To develop a tapping skill test for kho-kho female players, researchgate.net The present appearance of the game was an adoption from the time of World War I in 1914. But at that time, there were neither any dimensions of the playground nor the poles which demarcate the central line. The time factor was also missing. The Deccan Gymkhana club of Pune, Maharashtra so named and baptized by the great Indian leader Lokmanya Tilak & Bhai Narorkar drafted the first-ever rules and regulations which symbolized the metamorphosis of the game soon to follow. This initial stage marked the limitation of the playground and yet sadly lacked the poles demarking the central line in the field. Instead, less experienced players were posted squatting at the ends of the latter and chasers ran around them to return to the midfield. But, even then the game caught the imagination of the experts in the field. The experts took no time to realize that the game demands the highest degree of quick and brisk movements, very high grade of nerve reflexes and tremendous stamina which are characteristic of a supreme athlete. The game requires all motor qualities alike speed, endurance, flexibility, agility, strength and neuromuscular coordination. As per merit, it is appreciated by press, media and spectators. The game with its fast pace, so fascinated the spectators that the Governor of Bombay Presidency H.E. Lord Willingdon also admired the merits and potentials of the game. The years 1923-24 saw the foundation of the Inter School Sports Organization, and Kho Kho was introduced to develop at the grassroots and consequently popularize the sport. The move certainly showed the results and the game of Kho Kho mainly owes it to the efforts taken by the Deccan Gymkhana and Hind Vijay Gymkhana. In the year 1938, Kho Kho moved one step forward when Akhil Maharashtra Sharirik Shikshan Mandal organized zonal sports at Akola which attracted tremendous response from the budding enthusiasts as well as organizers. The team size was restricted to 9 players per team and sport was played without the poles. At the beginning of the match, players used to take 3 rounds of the court from post to post and then started the match. This needed yet another few reforms which were adopted in 1943 as well as 1945. Kho kho was exhibited in Sweden and Denmark in the year 1949 but it didn't leave any effect on the spectators (foreigner). After coming back in 1949, the poles were featured in the game. Also, the 3 rounds at the beginning of the game were reduced to one round from pole to pole. In 1951, even the one round was eliminated. In the year 1955, Akhil Bharatiya Kho Kho Mandal was established and the first ever All India Kho Kho Championship was organized at Vijayawada, Andhra Pradesh in 1959-60 under the auspices of Kho Kho Federation of India. The years 1960-61 featured Women's Championship for the first time in Kohlapur, Maharashtra. Individual prizes were introduced in the year 1963. Vishwanath Mayekar won the first Man of the Tournament named \\"Ekalavya Award\\". The Woman of the Tournament \\"Rani Laxmibai Award\\" was claimed by Usha Anantham of Mysore. The years 1969 and 1970 featured the Junior age group competitions at Hyderabad, Andhra Pradesh. Youth under 18 Years and Boys under 16 Years of age were two new categories introduced where the best youth player of the tournament was honoured by \\"Abhimanyu Award\\". Junior Girls under 16 Years tournament was held in 1974 at Dewas, Madhya Pradesh, where two more categories Sub-Junior Boys under 14 Years and Girls under 12 Years also commenced. The best Sub-Juniors Boy & Girls was awarded \\"Bharat Award\\" and \\"Veer Bala Award\\" respectively. In 1970, Arjuna Award was awarded to Shri Sudhir Parab from Gujarat. In the year 1982, the Kho Kho Federation of India organized Men's and Women's Yearly Championship as Federation Cup. Kho Kho was featured in the Asian Games, 1982 for the first time in New Delhi. It was appreciated by Asian countries. After looking at its grand success Sports Authority of India and Ministry of Youth Affairs and Sports, Govt. of India deputed their coaches all over the country to develop the sport of Kho Kho scientifically at grass root level. Looking back at its success, it was one of the main featured during 12th South Asian Games, 2016 held at Guwahati, Assam from 5 to 9 February 2016. It happened just because of the sincere efforts of Shri Rajeev Mehta, President, KKFI & Secretary General, IOA. The participating countries were Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Nepal and host country India. This tournament was well organized under the leadership of Shri. M. S. Tyagi, Competition Director (Kho Kho). All the Asian countries appreciated and ensured of introducing the sport in their respective countries. 1st Asian Championship took place at Calcutta, West Bengal in 1996 followed by the 2nd Asian Championship in the year 2000 at Dhaka, Bangladesh. The 3rd Asian Championship was held in the month of April 2016 at Indore, Madhya Pradesh. The participating countries were Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Nepal, Korea and host country India. The test series was played between India and England in January‚ÄìFebruary, 2017 at different venues in India namely Mumbai, Rajasthan and New Delhi.Kho-Kho Federation of India, khokhofederation.in In 1999, The Asian Kho Kho Federation was established during the 3rd edition of the South Asian Games. Member countries included India, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Nepal and Maldives. The 1st Asian Championship was held at Kolkata in 1996 and the second championship at Dhaka, Bangladesh. India, Sri Lanka, Pakistan, Nepal, Japan, Thailand were participants of this championship. In 2013, the Kho Kho Federation of England was formed by Brij Haldania, who had played competitively for Rajasthan before settling down in United Kingdom. With the aim of developing the game to an international level, he built relationships with M.S Tyagi (Kho-Kho Federation of India), Sudhanshu Mittal (Asian Kho-Kho Federation) and Rajeev Mehta (Indian Olympic Association). With the collaborative efforts of these individuals, the sport has reached new heights. In 2018, the 'International Kho-Kho Federation' was formed to govern and guide the sport of Kho-Kho globally. Rules A match consists of two innings with each inning consisting of chasing and running turns of 9 minutes each. One team sits on their knees in the middle of the court, 8 in a row, with adjacent members facing opposite directions. The runners play in the field, three at a time and the team that takes the shortest time to touch all the opponents in the field, wins. There is a pole at each end of the field and the runner is allowed to go between two sitting players, but the chaser is not allowed to turn back while running or go between the players i.e. the chaser must run in the same direction unless he chooses to touch either end pole and run in the opposite direction. He may cross over to the other side when he is reversing directions by going around the pole. # The runner or the chaser is decided by toss. # A match consists of two innings of chasing and defending turns, which is each of 9 minutes. # The captain of chasing side may end the turn before allotted time. # The side that scores more wins a match. # When a defender is out, he should enter the sitting box from the lobby. # Incomplete match for unavoidable reasons should be played in the same session with the same players and officials. The score of the completed turn should be counted. For incomplete turn, the match will start afresh. The entire match should be replayed from the beginning if the incomplete match is not played in the same session.  Specifications  A kho kho playing field is rectangular. It is in length nio. In the middle of these two rectangles, there are two wooden poles. The central lane's dimensions are 24 m √ó 30 cm. There are eight cross lanes which lie across the central lane, whose dimensions are 16 m √ó 35 cm. It makes the small rectangles and each of them are 16 m √ó 2.3 m (the two rectangles of near by the wooden poles are 2.55 m wide), at right angles to the central lane and divided equally into two parts of each by the central lane. At the end of the central lane, the free zone tangent to the post-line, two smooth wooden posts are fixed, 120 cm to 125 cm high from the ground, and their circumference is 28.25 to 31.4 cm. The equipment used in kho kho are poles/post, strings, metallic measuring tape, lime powder, wire nails, two watches, types of rings having inner circumference of 28.25 and 31.4 cm, score shots (like a whistle, for instance), and equipment to record the results. However, for unofficial games, only lime powder (or any substitute) may be used as long as the cross lanes, centre lane and field boundaries are clearly distinguished. The strings, as well as the rings, are for the sole purpose of properly demarcating the same. Dismissal There are usually two referees standing on the opposite sides of the rectangular field. Both carry a stopwatch and each of them is responsible for giving a decision on their opposite side of the field (because they can watch the game play in front of them more clearly than when it is on their same side).

Based on the novel of the same name by Ernst Lothar, it was made at Islington Studios.Wood p.85 The film's sets were designed by the German art director Alfred Junge. Bryan Edgar Wallace contributed to the screenplay. Plot Maximus (Claude Rains), \\"King of the Mind Readers\\", performs an English music hall mind-reading act with the help of his wife, Rene (Fay Wray), using a secret code. One night, he sees the beautiful Christine Shawn (Jane Baxter) in the audience, and his act becomes reality. He is able to tell what is in a sealed letter without Rene's assistance. Maximus does not think much of it, until he and Christine meet by chance on a train and he foresees an impending crash. He pulls the emergency cord to stop the train, but nobody believes him. He, his family and Christine disembark, and a few minutes later the train crashes. Christine tells her father, who owns a newspaper. He publishes the story, making Maximus famous. Maximus realizes that his power only works when Christine is near. As they spend more time together, Christine falls in love with him and Rene becomes jealous. Maximus' mother (Mary Clare) believes that no good can come of this new gift, but Maximus pays little attention, enjoying his well-paid success. Another of his well-publicized predictions comes true: a 100-to-1 long shot wins The Derby. He chooses to ignore his own prophecy of his mother's death; when it comes true, he is so distraught that he decides to follow her wishes and abandon his ability. He feels compelled to act, however, when he foresees a great mining disaster. He is unable to convince the mining company to evacuate the mine. When the disaster occurs, hundreds are killed and more are missing and presumed dead. He is publicly accused of causing the accident and is brought to trial. The prosecution claims that Maximus himself caused both tragedies, by delaying the train and by panicking the miners into making a mistake. Maximus predicts in the courtroom that the missing miners will be found alive. When this becomes true, he is released. Maximus decides to give up his gift and he and Rene slip away into obscurity.

Background Mario and the Magician is one of Mann's most political stories. Mann openly criticizes fascism, a choice which later became one of the grounds for his exile to Switzerland following Hitler's rise to power. The magician, Cipolla, is analogous to the fascist dictators of the era with their fiery speeches and rhetoric. The story was especially timely, considering the tensions in Europe when it was written. Stalin had just seized power in Russia, Mussolini was urging Italians to recapture the glory of the Roman Empire, and Hitler with his rhetoric was quickly gaining steam in Germany. The end of the story represents Mann's changing political views; he moved from staunch support of the Kaiser during his early life to a belief in progressive, democratic values in Europe and a desire to rid the continent of fascist influences. Plot summary The narrator describes a trip by his family to the fictional seaside town of Torre di Venere, Italy. It becomes unpleasant, partly because he finds the Italian people to be too nationalistic. The family attends a performance by a magician and hypnotist named Cipolla, who uses his mental powers in a fascist way to control his audience. Cipolla represents the mesmerizing power of authoritarian leaders in Europe at the time ‚Äî he is autocratic, misuses power, and is able to subjugate the crowd, counterbalancing his inferiority complex by artificially boosting his self-confidence. Cipolla's assassination by Mario, a native of Torre di Venere, is not a tragedy but a liberation for the audience. Adaptations The story/novel has been adapted several times for the operatic stage. Stephen Oliver's adaptation was premiered in 1988 at the Battignano Festival. 1989 saw a one-act opera by the Hungarian composer J√°nos Vajda to a libretto by G√°bor B√≥kkon. A recording was issued in 1990 on the Hungaroton label. . A three- hour-long opera adaptation by composer Harry Somers with lyrics by Rod Anderson premiered 19 May 1992 at the Elgin Theatre, Toronto. Mario and the Magician was adapted into an English opera by librettist J. D. McClatchy and composer Francis Thorne. It was first performed in 2005 by the Center for Contemporary Opera in the auditorium of Hunter College. A recording of this production was released on compact disc by Albany Records in 2006. The original cast included Justin Vickers as Mario, Larry Small, Jessica Grigg, Wendy Brown, Beata Safari, Sankofa Sarah Wade, Jim Gaylord, Eric Jordan, Isai Jess Mu√±oz, Leandra Ramm, Richard Cassell, Jason Cammorata and Nathan Resika. There is also a 1994 film with Klaus Maria Brandauer as Cipolla and Julian Sands as the patriarch, directed by Brandauer. Briscula the Magician is an operatic adaptation by Bob Misbin with music by Frances Pollock. It was performed in Silver Spring Maryland in March 2020 by Bel Cantanti Opera. In this adaptation the magician prevails. This change reflects the history of the ascendance of fascism in Europe not yet evident when Mann published his story in 1929. As noted by Dr. Mark Dreisonstok in Maryland Theatre Guide, March 7 2020, this opera is an \\"accessible entry point\\" into the work of Thomas Mann.

It is a strongly right-leaning and highly political association. History Inspired by institutions such as The Brookings Institution, American Enterprise Institute, Heritage Foundation, Adam Smith Institute, Institute of Economic Affairs etc., CEPOS was founded on March 11, 2004 by a number of high-profile representatives of Danish academia, business, media, and the arts, including former Defence Minister Bernt Johan Collet, who became Chairman of the Board. Other prominent co-founders include former Prime Minister Poul Schl√ºter, former Minister of Foreign Affairs Uffe Ellemann- Jensen, university professors Nicolai Juul Foss, Jesper Lau Hansen, Bent Jensen, and Peter Kurrild-Klitgaard. Also included are well-known journalists Bent Bl√ºdnikow and Samuel Rachlin and cultural personalities such as Bent Fabricius-Bjerre and Michael Laudrup. Martin √Ögerup was hired in 2005 as the think-tank's CEO. During the summer of 2004, the new Board managed to bring in the necessary grants and contributions from foundations, corporations, and individual sponsors. At a meeting on October 2, 2004, the founders confirmed their decision to establish the think-tank, CEPOS. The official opening of CEPOS took place on March 10, 2005 at Hotel D'Angleterre. CEPOS is dedicated to preserving and strengthening what they see as the foundations of a free and prosperous society by supporting tax-cuts, limited government, and private enterprise as well as vital cultural and political institutions. The research of CEPOS claim to support a civil society consisting of free and responsible individuals and to foster policies, institutions and culture that is supportive of a free market economy, the rule of law, and a civil society consisting of free and responsible individuals. The think tank is recognized by the Danish state as an official research institution, a title only given to institutions that produce knowledge of equal quality to that of Danish universities. It is a known advocate of school choice, a more open immigration policy, lower taxes and less regulation, and a known opponent of increased public surveillance, anti-terrorism laws that curtail civil liberties and criminalizing what they see as \\"victimless crime\\". CEPOS produces both academic research and policy analyses on a wide range of issues, including education, immigration, legal reform, taxation, regulation and the public sector. It hosts numerous conferences each year and has attracted high-level speakers, including Robert Barro, George Borjas, Nobel laureate Edward Prescott, Nobel laureate Gary Becker, Nigel Lawson and many others. CEPOS has been described as a leading and serious voice in the Danish debate on taxation, regulation, and welfare, as well as on schools, education and integration. It is frequently quoted in the media, with over 5000 media clips amassed over its years in operation, and was described by the Danish business magazine Berlingske Nyhedsmagasin in 2007 as being \\"in charge of the public debate\\". CEPOS is the Danish participant in the Economic Freedom of the World Project as well as the International Property Rights Index. CEPOS University In 2006, CEPOS launched CEPOS University, a free course taught by university professors, industry leaders and former statesmen in the underlying philosophical, sociological and economic ideas behind classical liberalism, and the various theories behind the free market. Admission is highly competitive. Criticism CEPOS has repeatedly been criticized for downplaying the effects of climate change and its consequences for both the environment and the global economy. In Danish science magazine Videnskab.dk researchers have accused CEPOS of utilizing a type of deflective climate scepticism to stall serious climate action. Awards and ranking CEPOS is a five-time winner of the highly prestigious Atlas Economic Research Foundation and John Templeton Foundation awards given to the best think tanks around the world. It was awarded the 2006 Templeton Freedom Award, given an Honorable Mention in the 2007 Templeton Freedom Award Grant and received the 2007 Templeton Freedom Prize for Initiative in Public Relations. It was awarded second place in the 2008 Sir Anthony Fisher International Memorial Award for the best book published by a think tank and won the 2009 Fisher Venture Grant Award.

Etymology Giresun was known to the ancient Greeks as Choerades or more prominently as Kerasous or Cerasus (), the origin of the modern name. The name Kerasous corresponds to Œ∫ŒµœÅŒ±œÉœåœÇ (keras√≥s) \\"cherry\\" + -ŒøœÖŒΩœÑ (a place marker). Thus, the Greek root of the word \\"cherry\\", Œ∫ŒµœÅŒ±œÉœåœÇ (keras√≥s), predates the name of the city, and the ultimate origin of the word cherry (and thus the name of the city) is probably from a Pre-Greek substrate, likely of Anatolian origin, given the intervocalic œÉ in ŒöŒµœÅŒ±œÉŒø·ø¶œÇ and the apparent cognates of it found in other languages the region. Another theory derives Kerasous from Œ∫Œ≠œÅŒ±œÇ (keras) \\"horn\\" + -ŒøœÖŒΩœÑ (a place marker), for the prominent horn-shaped peninsula that the city is situated on (compare with the Greek name for the horn-shaped Golden Horn waterway in Istanbul, ŒöŒ≠œÅŒ±œÇ (Keras) \\"Horn\\"). The toponym would have later mutated into Kerasunt (sometimes written K√©rasounde or Kerassunde), and the word \\"cherry\\" (as well as its cognates found in other local languages) was derived from the name of the city itself, rather than the other way around. Pharnaces I of Pontus renamed the city Pharnacia after himself after he captured the city in 183 BCE, and it was called by that name as late as the 2nd century CE. According to A. H. M. Jones, the city officially reverted to its original name, Kerasous, in 64 CE.Arrian: Periplus Ponti Euxini, edited and translated by Aidan Liddle (London: Bristol Classical Press, 2003), p. 117 The Greek name Kerasous was Turkified into Giresun after Turks gained permanent control of the region in the late 15th century. The English word cherry, French cerise, Spanish cereza, Persian ⁄Ø€åŸÑÿßÿ≥ (gilas) and Turkish kiraz, among countless others, all come from Ancient Greek Œ∫ŒµœÅŒ±œÉœåœÇ \\"cherry tree\\". According to Pliny, the cherry was first exported from Cerasus to Europe in Roman times by Lucullus. Geography Pƒ±narlar village, Giresun Northern end of Gedikkaya crag, located in the eastern part of Giresun city. Giresun and its island The surrounding region has a rich agriculture, growing most of Turkey's hazelnuts as well as walnuts, cherries, leather and timber, and the port of Giresun has long handled these products. The harbour was enlarged in the 1960s and the town is still a port and commercial centre for the surrounding districts, but Giresun is not large, basically one avenue of shops leading away from the port. Like everywhere else on the Black Sea coast it rains (and often snows in winter) and is very humid throughout the year, with a lack of extreme temperatures both in summer and winter. As a result, Giresun and the surrounding countryside is covered by luxuriant flora. As soon as you get beyond the city buildings you get into the hazelnut growing area and the high pastures (yayla) further in the mountains are gorgeous. Climate Giresun has a humid subtropical climate (K√∂ppen climate classification: Cfa), like most of the eastern Black Sea coast of Turkey, with warm and humid summers and cool and damp winters. Giresun has a high and evenly distributed precipitation throughout the year. Precipitation is heaviest in autumn and spring. Snowfall is quite common between the months of December and March, snowing for a week or two, and it can be heavy once it snows. The water temperature is cool in winter and warm in summer and fluctuates between 8¬∞ and 29 ¬∞C throughout the year.  History  Giresun city at the beginning of the 20th century Ottoman houses in Zeytinlik neighbourhood Pontian Greek athletics team from Giresun (formerly Kerasounta) early 20th century. Aksu stream, Giresun Giresun's history goes back to the late 6th century BC, when it was founded by Greek colonists from Sinope, 110 km east of the homonymous city founded by Pharnaces I of Pontus, using citizens transferred from Kotyora (modern Ordu), circa 180 BCE.The Princeton Encyclopedia of Classical Sites, PHARNAKEIA KERASOUS (Giresun) Pontus, Turkey The name of the city is first cited in the book Anabasis by Xenophon as Kerasus. Historic records reveal that the city was dominated by the Miletians, Persians, Romans, Byzantines and Empire of Trebizond. The older parts of the city lie on a peninsula crowned by a ruined Byzantine fortress, sheltering the small natural harbour. Nearby is Giresun Island, in ancient times called Aretias, the only major Black Sea island in Turkish territory. According to legend, the island was sacred to the Amazons, who had dedicated a temple to the war god Ares here. Even today, fertility rites are performed there every May, usually involving the famed boulder named the Hamza Stone on the east side of the island, now shrouded as a popular practice but in reality a 4,000-year-old celebration. Cerasus in late antiquity became a Christian bishopric, and the names of several of its bishops are preserved in the acts of church councils: Gregorius at the Council of Ephesus in 431, Gratianus at the Council of Chalcedon in 451, Theophylactus at the Third Council of Constantinople in 680, Narses at the Trullan Council in 692, Ioannes at the Second Council of Nicaea in 787, and Simeon at the Photian Council of Constantinople in 879. An episcopal seal records a Leo of the 9th century, and a Michael was transferred from here to the see of Ancyra at the time of Michael Caerularius.Michel Lequien, Oriens christianus in quatuor Patriarchatus digestus, Paris 1740, Vol. I, coll. 513-516Raymond Janin, v.

During the medieval period, Kerasunt was part of the Byzantine Empire and later the second city of the Empire of Trebizond ruled by the Komnenian dynasty. Alexios II Komnenos, Emperor of Trebizond, defeated the Turkmen \\"Koustoganes\\" at Kerasunt in September 1302; to secure his victory, Alexios II built a fortress which overlooks the sea.William Miller, Trebizond: The last Greek Empire of the Byzantine Era: 1204-1461, 1926 (Chicago: Argonaut, 1969), p. 33 From 1244 onwards the Seljuk Turks moved into the area, pursued at times by the Mongol hordes until in 1461, subsequent to the fall of Constantinople, the whole of this coast was brought within the Ottoman Empire by Sultan Mehmet II. It was briefly occupied by Emirate of Hacƒ±emiroƒülu (Emirate of Chalybia) between 1398-1400. Local traditions claim that Kerasunt held out for many months after the fall of Trebizon in 1461, then surrendered on terms that the Christian inhabitants could remain and retain their arms, but were required to maintain a boat for the use of the Turks on a nearby river.Miller, Trebizond, p. 107 4.2 km east-northeast of Kerasus is a fortified island called Ares (ŒëœÅŒ∑œÑŒπŒ±œÇ ŒΩŒÆœÉŒøœÇ or ŒëœÅŒµœéŒΩŒ∑œÉŒøœÇ). According to the poetic account of Apollonius of Rhodes, it was here that the Argonauts encountered both the Amazons and a flock of vicious birds. The Greeks of the island held out against the Ottomans for 7 years after the fall of Trebizond (modern Trabzon) in 1461.

He is best known for his appearances with World Championship Wrestling from 1997 to 1999 under the ring name Sick Boy, where he was a member of Raven's Flock. Professional wrestling career=World Championship Wrestling (1997-1999) After training at the WCW Power Plant, he made his professional debut on the March 31, 1997 episode of Nitro under the ring name Lance Ringo, where he lost to Diamond Dallas Page. Several months later, Vick competed on the November 24 episode of Nitro as Sick Boy, where he was also revealed to be a member of Raven's Flock. His third match of his career was a loss to Chris Benoit. Sick Boy received his first title match as he competed against Page for the United States Heavyweight Championship on the January 29, 1998 episode of Thunder, but was unsuccessful in winning the title. He faced Page in a rematch for the title on the February 17 episode of Saturday Night, but was again unsuccessful. He then continued to wrestle in many feuds with Chris Benoit, Diamond Dallas Page, Steve McMichael, Bill Goldberg and others. Sick Boy would then be used as a jobber for several months afterwards, and remained with the Flock until its disbanding on September 13 at Fall Brawl. In 1999, Vick dropped the grungy attire associated with the Flock and adopted wrestling trunks in addition to dyeing his hair blond.

Early life Born to Serbian father Spasa from Kru≈°evac and Croatian mother Danica from Makarska, Milan's first years were spent in Zagreb, PR Croatia, where his father, an officer in the Yugoslav People's Army, was stationed at the time. Consequently, Milan grew up wherever it was that his dad's job took the family. In total, it ended up being three cities. When he was six, Milan's family moved to Sarajevo where he spent a notable part of his childhood. Eventually in 1970, they moved to Belgrade just short of his 12th birthday. Once in Belgrade, Milan attended the Eleventh Belgrade Gymnasium in the Lekino Brdo neighbourhood while simultaneously entering the circle of young people involved with music and arts. Musical career=Limunovo Drvo and ≈†arlo Akrobata With schoolmate Gagi Mihajloviƒá, Mladenoviƒá formed a band called Limunovo drvo (Lemon Tree) that dabbled in melodic hard rock. The group changed lineups frequently, displaying a pretty limited creative potential until the arrival of bassist Du≈°an Kojiƒá Koja and drummer Ivan Vdoviƒá Vd. Soon afterwards, they adopted a new musical direction (new wave) and changed the name to ≈†arlo akrobata. During this time Milan was musically very much fond of and inspired by Elvis Costello, Paul Weller, and Andy Partridge of XTC. ≈†arlo akrobata released only one album, Bistriji ili tuplji ƒçovek biva kad... in July 1981 and broke up soon afterward due to creative differences between Milan and Koja. The record is considered to be one of the best and most important albums of the Yugoslav new wave music scene. Katarina II and Ekatarina Velika In late 1981 Milan and his former bandmate from Limunovo drvo Gagi Mihajloviƒá (guitar) hooked up again to form Katarina II. In 1982 Margita Stefanoviƒá (keyboards), Bojan Peƒçar (bass) and Ivan Vdoviƒá Vd joined the band. After the self-titled, new wave coloured debut album, Vd and Gagi left the band. Since Gagi claimed ownership of the \\"Katarina II\\" name, the band was forced to take another one. They eventually settled on Ekatarina Velika and released a self- titled album in 1985. The album was widely critically acclaimed and brought them wider attention. Their next album S' vetrom uz lice launched them to the very top of the Yugoslav music scene, where they stayed for a long time, releasing a series of successful records. The concerts were jam packed and finally their music even made it on the state radio. Final works In 1992, Mladenoviƒá joined other Serbian musicians to form Rimtutituki project dedicated to the anti-war campaign. They released one single titled \\"Slu≈°aj 'vamo\\".Rimtuti Tuki at Discogs In the spring of 1994, Mladenoviƒá recorded and released an album called Angel's Breath in Brazil together with his old friend Suba (Mitar Subotiƒá). Death In August 1994, Mladenoviƒá discovered that he had pancreatic cancer. He died on November 5 in Belgrade, FR Yugoslavia and was buried at Novo groblje cemetery. Legacy Three streets in the capital cities of former Yugoslav republics bear Mladenoviƒá's name. A street in the Belgrade neighborhood Zemun Polje was named after him in 2004, a street in the Podgorica neighborhood Zabjelo in 2007, as well as a street in Zagreb (Croatia) in 2012.

In 2008 McVeigh suffered an injury which sidelined him for almost half the season, nevertheless he claimed 13 Brownlow votes to his name in only 14 games, McVeigh finished in the top 20. Personal life On 17 October 2009 McVeigh married his longtime girlfriend, Leanne Tucker. They have a daughter, Ariana, born in March 2011.McVeigh family welcome baby girl Mark also had a niece, Luella (the daughter of Sydney's Jarrad McVeigh), born on 25 July 2011 but she died from heart complications barely a month later. Following Essendon's seven-point victory over , its first over the side since 2004, Mark 'blew a kiss towards to the heavens' in her memory. Essendon's players wore black armbands in the match.One from the heart ‚Äì AFL.com.au Retirement McVeigh retired from professional Australian Rules Football on 29 August 2012. Injuries to his hip, knee and hamstring restricted McVeigh to only three games during the 2012 season. McVeigh stated, \\"It's a decision that I've been to-ing and fro-ing with for about eight weeks. But I've been very fortunate to part ways with the club on really good terms,\\" during a press conference at Windy Hill. McVeigh shared the role of Vice-Captain of the Essendon Football Club with David Hille for most of his career. McVeigh played a total of 232 games and kicked 107 goals during his successful career at Essendon. In 2013, following his retirement, McVeigh began a media career with the Seven Network and SEN 1116. He also began taking developmental coaching roles in New South Wales and Canberra. He coached the Under-16 and Under-18 NSW/ACT Rams teams in the national championships, and took a head coaching role at the Giants Academy, then transitioned into an assistant coaching role at the Greater Western Sydney Giants from 2015, serving as the defensive coach. On 12 January 2016, McVeigh was named as one of 34 past and present Essendon players found guilty over their use of illegal supplements during the 2012 AFL season. As a result, McVeigh was suspended from involvement in football for twenty-four months, which (due to back-dating and time served in provisional suspensions) saw him suspended until November 2016. The terms of the suspension meant that McVeigh was unable to continue assistant coaching role during 2016.

The phrase can include police officers, municipal law enforcement officers, special police officers, customs officers, state troopers, special agents, secret agents, special investigators, border patrol officers, immigration officers, court officers, probation officers, parole officers, arson investigators, auxiliary officers, game wardens, sheriffs, constables, corrections, marshals, deputies, detention officers, correction officers, and public safety officers (at public institutions). Security guards are civilians and therefore not law enforcement officers, unless they have been granted powers to enforce particular laws, such as those accredited under a community safety accreditation scheme such as a security police officer. Modern legal codes use the term peace officer (or in some jurisdictions, law enforcement officer) to include every person vested by the legislating state with law enforcement authority‚Äîtraditionally, anyone \\"sworn, badged, and armable\\" who can arrest, or refer such arrest for a criminal prosecution. Hence, city police officers, county sheriffs' deputies, state troopers and in some states corrections officers are usually vested with the same authority within a given jurisdiction. Contract security officers may enforce certain laws and administrative regulations, which may include detainment or apprehension authority, including arresting. Peace officers may also be able to perform all duties that a law enforcement officer is tasked with, but may or may not be armed with a weapon. Canada In Canada, the Criminal Code (R.S., c. C-34, s. 2.) defines a peace officer as: Section (b) allows for designation as a peace officer for a member of the Correctional Service of Canada under the following via the Corrections and Conditional Release Act: Also, provincial legislatures can designate a class of officers (i.e. Conservation Officers, Park Rangers and Commercial Vehicle Safety and Enforcement) to be peace officers. Sri Lanka Under the Code Of Criminal Procedure a peace officer includes all police officers, a Divisional Assistant Government Agent and a Grama Niladharis appointed by a Government Agent (GA) in writing to perform police duties or keep the peace.Code Of Criminal Procedure A peace officer has the power to arrest a person without a warrant or an order from a magistrate under certain circumstances such as;LAW OF CRIMINAL PROCEDURE # who in his presence commits any breach of the peace, # who has been concerned in any cognizable offense or against whom a reasonable complaint has been made or credible information has been received or a reasonable suspicion exists of his having been so concerned, # having in his possession without lawful excuse any implement of house-breaking, # who has been proclaimed as an offender, # in whose possession anything is found which may reasonably be suspected to be property stolen or fraudulently obtained and who may reasonably be suspected of having committed an offense concerning such thing # who obstructs a peace officer while in the execution of his duty or who has escaped or attempts to escape from lawful custody, # suspected of being a military deserter, # suspected of concealing his presence under circumstances which afford reason to believe that he is taking such precautions intending to commit a cognizable offense, # who has been concerned in or against whom a reasonable complaint has been made or credible information has been received or a reasonable suspicion exists of his having been concerned in any act committed at any place out of Sri Lanka During the British colonial administration of Ceylon, when uniformed policing by the Ceylon Police Force in rural areas of the island was limited, the local government agent would appoint individuals from wealthy influential families deemed loyal to the crown as a Peace Officers with police powers to keep the peace. This was an influential post, the holder had much control over the people of the area. Commonly a Native Headman (Ralahami) was appointed as the Peace Officer to maintain law and order in rural villages. Following the formation of the State Council of Ceylon in 1931, one of its members, H. W. Amarasuriya, called for an inquiry into the headman system. A commission was formed made up of retired civil servants and lawyers headed by H.M. Wedderburn. The commission reported on reforming the headman system or replacing it with transferable District Revenue Officers. The headman system was abolished as an administrative system, with the titles of Mudaliyar (Mudali - ‡∂∏‡∑î‡∂Ø‡∂Ω‡∑í) and Muhandiram retained by the government to be awarded as honors. This practice remained until the suspension of Ceylonese honors in 1956 by S. W. R. D. Bandaranaike. The minor headman positions were retained, surviving well into the 1970s when the post of Vidane was replaced with the transferable post of Grama Niladhari (Village Officer).

(¬ß 830.75) Most peace officers have jurisdiction throughout the state, but many have limited powers outside their political subdivisions. Some peace officers require special permission to carry firearms. Powers are often limited to the performance of peace officers' primary duties (usually, enforcement of specific laws within their political subdivision); however, most have power of arrest anywhere in the state for any public offense Public offenses in California include infractions, misdemeanors, and felonies. that poses an immediate danger to a person or property. A private person (i.e., ordinary citizen) may arrest another person for an offense committed in the arresting person's presence, or if the other person has committed a felony whether or not in the arresting person's presence (Penal Code ¬ß 837),California Penal Code, Part 2, Title 3, Chapter 5, Arrest and by Whom Made, ¬ß 837. though such an arrest when an offense has not occurred leaves a private person open to criminal prosecution and civil liability for false arrest. A peace officer may: * without an arrest warrant, arrest a person on probable cause that the person has committed an offense in the officer's presence, or if there is probable cause that a felony has been committed and the officer has probable cause to believe the person to be arrested committed the felony. (Penal Code ¬ß 836).California Penal Code, Part 2, Title 3, Chapter 5, Arrest and by Whom Made, ¬ß 836. * Is immune from civil liability for false arrest if, at the time of arrest, the officer had probable cause to believe the arrest was lawful. Persons are required to comply with certain instructions given by a peace officer, and certain acts (e.g., battery) committed against a peace officer carry more severe penalties than the same acts against a private person. It is unlawful to resist, delay, or obstruct a peace officer in the course of the officer's duties (Penal Code ¬ß 148[a][1]).California Penal Code, Part 1, Title 7, Chapter 7, Other Offenses Against Public Justice, ¬ß148. New York State New York State grants peace officers very specific powers under NYS Criminal Procedure Law, that they may make warrantless arrests, use physical and deadly force, and issue summonses under section 2.20 of that law. There is a full list of peace officers under Section 2.10 of that law. Below are some examples. # That state has law enforcement agencies contained within existing executive branch departments that employ sworn peace officers to investigate and enforce laws specifically related to the department. Most often, these departments employ sworn Investigators (separate from the New York State Police) that have statewide investigative authority under the department's mission. # The New York State Bureau of Narcotic Enforcement (BNE) is a state investigative agency housed under the State Department of Health. Narcotic Investigators with the Bureau of Narcotic Enforcement are sworn peace officers who carry firearms, make arrests, and enforce the New York State Controlled Substances Act, New York State Penal Law, and New York State Public Health Law. # The New York State Department of Taxation and Finance employs sworn peace officers as Excise Tax Investigators and Revenue Crimes Investigators. These State Investigators carry firearms, make arrests, and enforce New York State Penal Law related to tax evasion and other crimes. Excise Tax Investigators may execute Search Warrants. # The New York State Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) Division of Field Investigation also employ sworn peace officers as State Investigators.

It affects the neurotransmitter glutamate, with trials showing the drug improves cognitive functioning and memory. Approval process In 2005 the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) accepted Cortex Pharmaceuticals' Investigational New Drug (IND) application to initiate pilot Phase II clinical trials in the United States. Also, in 2005, the United States Department of Defense funded a study to look into CX717 and the physiological effects of sleepiness. The study found that rhesus monkeys performed faster and better after receiving the drug, and it counteracted the effects of sleep deprivation. However, a 2006 study funded by DARPA found that CX717 did not improve cognitive performance in humans subjected to simulated night shift work. In early March 2006 Cortex reported that, in a small pilot Phase II study, CX717 had demonstrated positive clinical and statistical results on the primary endpoint, the ADHD rating scale and the sub-scales related to attention and hyperactivity which are used for the approval of all currently available ADHD treatments. According to a Cortex Pharmaceuticals press release, \\"Consistent with all previous studies involving over 220 patients and healthy adults, this study demonstrated that CX717 was safe, well tolerated, and produced no increase in heart rate, blood pressure or other cardiovascular side effects\\". In April 2007 Cortex Pharmaceuticals submitted two large data packages to the FDA regarding CX717. One data set went to the FDA's Division of Neurology Drug Products for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease, while the other went to the Division of Psychiatry Products where the company filed a second CX717 IND for the treatment of ADHD. According to a Cortex Pharmaceuticals press release, the submitted data package \\"provides clear evidence that the specific histopathological changes seen in animal toxicology studies, which previously caused the FDA to put CX717 on clinical hold, is a postmortem fixation artifact and is not found in the tissue of the animal when it is still living\\". Roger G Stoll PhD, Chief Executive Officer of Cortex, stated, > ‚ÄúWhen CX717 was removed from clinical hold on October 6, 2006 by the > Neurology Division a dose was permitted for continuing a study in patients > with Alzheimer's disease, but that dose was too low to permit the assessment > of the drug in patients with ADHD. Further information was needed to better > understand the cause of the histopathological changes. We now have a > substantial data base which clearly documents the fact that the histological > changes of concern occur postmortem when the fixative solution is used to > prepare the slides of the tissue specimens.‚Äù However, in October 2007 the FDA denied Cortex's IND application for a Phase IIb study of CX717 for treatment of ADHD, based on the same animal toxicology results. Cortex responded by inactivating the application, although it will \\"continue its plans to develop CX717 for the acute treatment of respiratory depression (RD) and continue its study of CX717 in its Alzheimer‚Äôs disease PET scan study. Cortex believes that the IND application previously filed with the Division of Neurology Products of the FDA for the treatment of Alzheimer‚Äôs disease will not be affected by the actions of the DPP.\\" The company hopes that after the use of the compound in treating a high-risk acute condition is approved and well-established, the risks of longer-term use at higher doses, such as for treatment of ADHD, will be shown to be less than the FDA had concluded. Use for reversal of respiratory depression The relatively poor oral bioavailability and blood‚Äìbrain barrier penetration of CX-717 ultimately led to Cortex abandoning development of the 800 mg oral formulation of CX-717 for ADHD, although research into its action in the brain continues. However the unexpected discovery of the strong respiratory stimulant effects of the ampakine drugs on the pre-Botzinger complex of the brain has led to continued development of an intravenous formulation of CX-717 for use alongside opioid analgesics, along with an oral formulation of CX-1739, which is around 3-5x more potent than CX-717 and has better oral bioavailability, and is being trialled for treatment of sleep apnea. Further research has investigated the neurological mechanisms behind the anti-respiratory depressant effects of CX-717, and demonstrated that it can be used in humans alongside opioid drugs to reduce this side effect without affecting analgesia. Related AMPAkines Other AMPAkine drugs from Cortex Pharmaceuticals such as CX-546 and CX-614 have already been researched for use in treating Alzheimer's disease and ADHD. These drugs were reasonably effective at reducing the symptoms of Alzheimer's and it was hoped that they could also slow the progression of the disease, but both CX-546 and CX-614 have poor bioavailability, and are only active at very high doses of 1000 mg or more. CX-717 and CX-1739 are newer and more potent drugs in the same series.

It was released in May 2000 by record label V2. It is seen by some as a concept album about problems concerning modern technology in society. The album was released to critical acclaim.  Writing and recording  The album was written and recorded by frontman Jason Lytle alone in a remote farmhouse. He has been quoted as saying: \\"I just remember everything out there was dusty. Humidity and dust\\", and described having made the recordings \\"in my boxer shorts, bent over keyboards with sweat dripping off my forehead, frustrated, hungover and trying to call my coke dealer\\".  Content  The album's title The Sophtware Slump is a reference to a sophomore slump, a term given to an artist's second album which is seen to fail to live up to the first. \\"Jed the Humanoid\\" concerns an android named Jed, and is a eulogy for the robot, who drinks himself to death. Regarding Jed, who also appears in \\"Jed's Other Poem (Beautiful Ground)\\" and had appeared earlier in the song \\"Jeddy 3's Poem\\" from the 1999 EP Signal to Snow Ratio, Lytle noted: \\"I used Jed as my therapy vehicle, I guess... I was attempting to approach the subject of drinking, and possibly the fact that you may perhaps drink a little bit too much. [...] Humour has always been way up there at the top of my list of dealing with anything that could be considered serious. Sometimes you don't wanna be smacked in the face with certain bits of reality like that.\\" A music reviewer for The Guardian, Dorian Lynskey, called it \\"the saddest robot song ever written.\\" The album's penultimate song, \\"Miner at the Dial-a-View\\", originates from a 1989 home demo, with Lytle noting: \\"After a certain point, when the Earth has been tapped of all its resources, they start mining other planets. And there's these machines ‚Äì they're a lot like, y'know, the tabletop poker games that you find in bars now ‚Äì and the idea is to add coins to it, and you can punch in the latitude and longitude of places on earth, and revisit wherever you want. And [the narrator]'s actually revisiting his house, and he's seeing the girl that he's got back home is hanging out with some other guy, and he misses home.\\"  20th anniversary re-recording  On August 28, 2020 it was announced that Grandaddy would release a new recording of The Sophtware Slump to mark its 20th anniversary, the whole album being performed solo by Jason Lytle with a piano and no other instruments. The album was initially recorded during lockdown by Jason Lytle and is set for release in November 2020.  Release  The Sophtware Slump was released on May 29, 2000. It reached No. 36 on the UK Albums Chart in its first week of release, re- entering the chart in 2001, peaking at number 63. By February 2001 the album had sold 20,000 copies in the US and almost 80,000 worldwide. By 2006 it had sold 107,000 copies. Three singles were released from the album: \\"The Crystal Lake\\", released the same day, which charted at number 38 on the UK Singles Chart; \\"He's Simple, He's Dumb, He's the Pilot.\\"; and \\"Hewlett's Daughter\\", which charted at number 71 on the UK Singles Chart. The album was reissued in 2011 with a second disc of bonus material containing B-sides, EP tracks, outtakes and demos.  Reception  The Sophtware Slump was released to widespread critical acclaim. The CMJ New Music Monthly noted Jason Lytle's \\"new infatuation with technology, expertly juxtaposed with his almost spiritual connection to the West's wide-open spaces and bird-filled skies\\", and stated that \\"Lytle expresses sympathy for the lost souls and machines of the high-tech dot-com landscape throughout the album\\". The New York Times called the album \\"a heart-achingly beautiful requiem for a culture in which progress and technology have led to alienation and disposability\\". AllMusic called it \\"Grandaddy's most impressive work yet\\". The Daily Telegraph said the album was one of the highlights of 2000, describing it as \\"a work of rare and precious qualities. A collection of emotional, richly melodic songs that deal with modern man's uneasy relationship with technology\\". Steve Taylor, in his book The A to X of Alternative Music, viewed The Sophtware Slump as \\"clean, lush and less understated\\" than the band's previous work, describing \\"The Crystal Lake\\" as \\"a perfectly executed pop song\\".  Legacy  The indie music magazine Under the Radar ranked The Sophtware Slump fifteenth in its list of the best albums of the 2000s. Regarding the album's acclaim and legacy, Jason Lytle noted: \\"I would record The Sophtware Slump over again. The fact that this album has gotten this sort of acclaim only reconfirms to me what a load of shit this business is. An album about trees and computers that came out right after OK Computer? I don't get it... but I do.\\" In a 2011 review of the album's deluxe edition, Mike Powell of Pitchfork wrote: \\"If Radiohead captured a feeling of pre-millenial tension, The Sophtware Slump captured the feeling of disappointment that came afterward ‚Äî the feeling that life was going to be more or less the same as it had been, only now we'd have to live with the fact that we once thought it'd be so different: the feeling of January 2, 2000.\\"  Track listing  Personnel  ; Grandaddy * Jason Lytle ‚Äì vocals, all instruments, producer, mixing * Jim Fairchild ‚Äì \\"on/off switch assistance\\", performer * Aaron Burtch ‚Äì performer * Kevin Garcia ‚Äì performer * Tim Dryden ‚Äì performer ; Additional personnel * Greg Calbi ‚Äì mastering  References  External links  * Category:2000 albums Category:Concept albums Category:Grandaddy albums Category:V2 Records albums ","title":"The Sophtware Slump"},{"id":"1876278","text":"The Fuzz Club was an indie rock night hosted by University of Sheffield Union of Students, which ran from 1999 to 2009. It claimed to be the biggest students union rock night in the UK outside London. The night ran weekly on Thursdays throughout termtime and hosts new bands; sometimes local, sometimes national. The club provided a variety of music from heavy rock in the Bleach room to indie in the main fuzz room. Fuzz Club was part of the circuit for new bands trying to make a name for themselves. In recent years, it had hosted Keane, The Long Blondes, Editors, The Zutons, The Killers, Bloc Party, The xx, La Roux, Future of the Left, British Sea Power, 65daysofstatic, Ida Maria, Hot Chip, Florence and the Machine and The Others. The club night ran since 1999 and initially alternated with Bleach, a heavier rock night, which instead became resident in the Fuzz Club's second room - essentially part of Fuzz Club. At the end of the academic year 2008/09, the Fuzz Club is ended, with the last night held on 11 June 2009. The night has now been replaced with Live Wire, opening 23 September 2010.

The activities are in three main areas: military training, sport and culture. History=Establishment The Lithuanian Riflemen's Union was established in Kaunas on 27 June 1919 as a shooting section within the Lithuanian Sport Union. Several historic events determined the establishment of the Union ‚Äì the Lithuanian State had just declared independence and was asserting it in the wars against the Bolsheviks, the Western Russian Volunteer Army and the Polish forces. Vladas Putvinskis and Matas ≈†alƒçius were the most important activists behind the idea to form a Union, and Putvinskis became the first Commander of the LRU and its main ideologue. Both of them came up with the idea to form a paramilitary group at almost the same time, but the scope that they envisioned was different. In 1919 Matas ≈†alƒçius together with Antanas Vienuolis-≈Ωukauskas, Faustas Kir≈°a and other employees at the Press Office decided to form an organisation that would be able to protect Kaunas city; they intended to call it the Steel Battalion. At the same time another initiative was launched by a group headed by Putvinskis, and they prepared a statute for the organisation. Their aim was to support Lithuanian military in the entire Lithuanian territory. In June 1919, the Press Office employees invited Putvinskis to their meeting. Putvinskis joined the organisation that was being created and became one of the most active members. There were many famous and important Lithuanians among the founders of the Union, including writers Antanas Vienuolis- ≈Ωukauskas, Juozas Tumas-Vai≈ægantas and Balys Sruoga, poet Faustas Kir≈°a, painter Antanas ≈Ωmuidzinaviƒçius, zoologist Tadas Ivanauskas and many others. In the beginning, only civilians participated in the LRU, but later on soldiers and officers started to actively join its ranks. This reflects the main aim of the organisation ‚Äì to unite civilians who want to support the military. The ideology and the guiding principles of the LRU were influenced by earlier similar organisations: Sokol in Czechoslovakia, Suojeluskunta in Finland, and a paramilitary organisation of Switzerland. Putvinskis stated that ‚Äúthe Riflemen's Union is an organisation of free citizens, who are volunteering their time and efforts for the sake of protecting their homeland.ÀÆ Administrative division After its establishment in 1919, the LRU quickly expanded throughout Lithuania; many guerilla fighters from the recent wars joined in. In the beginning, the organisation was divided into sections covering the entire Lithuanian territory, and the sections had riflemen units. In 1925 an administrative reform was carried out, dividing the organisation into regiments, in line with the administrative division of Lithuania into districts. In 1936 a separate regiment was created for rail- road workers and their family members. Activities in 1919‚Äì1940 Event of the 12th Regiment of the Lithuanian Riflemen Union in Panevƒó≈æys in 1930 One of the many orchestras of the Lithuanian Riflemen (Salakas, 1931) The LRU had three main areas of activities in 1919-1940 ‚Äì culture, sport and military training. The riflemen's units had orchestras, theatres, libraries and sport clubs. The union published weekly magazine Trimitas. The riflemen were required to educate themselves and to participate in educating the society. To help with that they aimed at building riflemen centres in all cities and towns, where the union was active. The centres were to be dedicated to the needs of the nation. Centres were built in Utena, Tauragƒó, Alytus and some other cities and towns. The centres served as meeting and training places for riflemen, as well as housing their clubs and administration and hosting cultural activities. The organisation received a unique legal basis, in 1921, 1924 and 1935 laws on the LRU were passed that defined the activities of the organisation and its functions in the State. The laws aimed at restricting the autonomy of the LRU and to tie it as closely as possible to the Ministry of Defence and the Military. In 1935 the LRU became directly subordinate to the Chief of Defence (See the List of governments of Lithuania in 1918-1940). The law abolished dual leadership ‚Äì previously the organisation was led by the Chairman of the Central Board, elected by riflemen, and by the LRU Commander, appointed by the Minister of Defence. Thus the riflemen were fully integrated in the defensive structure of the country, and the district military commanders became the commanders of riflemen regiments. It was recorded that in 1935, the LRU had 33,276 members, of which 24,976 were soldiers. The organisation had 7,371 rifles and 32 machine guns. By 1940 the LRU had become one of the most popular and largest organizations in the country, with about 62,000 members. Both men and women were active in the organisation. The LRU had units of university students, including student corporations Saja and ≈Ωivilƒó. Many famous politicians (Antanas Smetona, Rapolas Skipitis, Mykolas Sle≈æeviƒçius, Juozas Urb≈°ys), artists and other members of the cultural elite (Antanas ≈Ωmuidzinaviƒçius, Unƒó Babickaitƒó-Graiƒçi≈´nienƒó also known as Une Bay, Antanas Vienuolis-≈Ωukauskas, Petras Vaiƒçi≈´nas), scientists (Tadas Ivanauskas, Augustinas Janulaitis, Liudas Vailionis, Antanas Graugrokas) were active in the union. Even though the majority of members originated from the farmer class, the main principles of the Union were also appealing to other classes. Members of the organization are registered in the journal Soviet occupation On 15 June 1940, the Soviet Union occupied Lithuania, and the riflemen, like the rest of the military, were ordered not to resist. Aleksandras Barauskas, a rifleman and a border guard, was killed by Red Army soldiers in the early morning of June 15. The new Soviet People's Government of Lithuania immediately took steps to liquidate the union. Its commander, Colonel Pranas Salad≈æius, was dismissed on 19 June 1940, and the Chief of Defence division General Vincas Vitkauskas, who was cooperating with the Soviets, ordered the riflemen to hand over their arms to the military on 25 June 1940. On 13 July 13, 1940 a Soviet order to liquidate the union was issued. In subsequent months, a number of the most active riflemen were arrested as \\"enemies of the people\\" and sent to various Gulag camps. In June 1941, the Soviets started a mass deportation that targeted \\"anti-Soviet elements\\", including the riflemen. Among those deported were LRU's commander Colonel Pranas Salad≈æius, honorary commander of the women's section Emilija Putvinskienƒó, commander of the Utena Regiment Lt. Col. Pranas Broneviƒçius, head of the culture section Vincas Daudzvaras, and others. Remaining riflemen began forming anti-Soviet groups and played a role in the uprising of 23 June 1941, but there is no specific data on how many members participated in it. German occupation and collaboration On the 22 June 1941, Nazi Germany invaded the Soviet Union and also occupied the Baltic states. Initially treated as 'liberators' the situation later became one of 'passive resistance' against the Nazis. During the Nazi occupation, ex-riflemen formed several underground organisations, such as Laisvƒós ≈°auliai (Freedom's Riflemen), aimed at restoring Lithuania's independence. Between July 1941 and August 1944, some members of the Sauliu Sajunga [Riflemen‚Äôs Association] (see Collaboration with the Axis Powers#Lithuania) volunteered to serve the Germans and were involved in the Ponary massacre,Kazimierz Sakowicz, Yitzhak Arad, Ponary Diary, 1941‚Äì1943: A Bystander's Account of a Mass Murder, Yale University Press, 2005, , Google Print. the execution of tens of thousands of Jews, Poles, and Soviet prisoners of war in forests close to the village of Paneriai, near Vilnius. When the Soviets returned in mid-1944, many riflemen joined the Lithuanian partisans and fought a guerrilla war against the Soviet Union. Two out of eight guerrillas who signed the declaration of the Union of Lithuanian Freedom Fighters on 16 February 1949, were ex-riflemen: Leonardas Grigonis- U≈æpalis and Juozas ≈†ibaila-Merainis. Some other ex-riflemen were also prominent among the guerrillas, including Juozas Vitkus-Kazimieraitis, Zigmas Drunga-Mykolas Jonas, Dominykas Jƒóƒçys-ƒÑ≈æuolis, Vladas Montvydas-≈Ωemaitis. Restoration of the Union Headquarters in Vilnius, Va≈°ingtono Square The first attempts to restore the LRU were made still during the occupation when the movement for reform started. On 1 June 1989, during a protest in Kaunas by a club of former exiles and the Democrat party, the restoration of the LRU was officially announced. On 20 September 1989, the activists gave an oath in Kelmƒó, at the grave of Putvinskis, the founder and ideologue of the LRU. That day is considered to be the day of the restoration of the LRU in Lithuania. The members of the restored Lithuanian Riflemen's Union were active in the movement for reform, they were especially active in guarding the Lithuanian Parliament and other State buildings during the January Events in 1991 and later. On 13 January 1991, two members of Vilnius riflemen regiment were killed: Ignas ≈†imulionis and Darius Gerbutaviƒçius. On May 19, at a border crossing point in Krak≈´nai a riflemen and a border guard Gintaras ≈Ωagunis was shot to death. Administrative divisions Currently the LRU is divided into ten riflemen regiments (≈°auli≈≥ rinktinƒó): #Karininko Antano Juozapaviƒçiaus 1-oji ≈°auli≈≥ rinktinƒó #Vytauto Did≈æioji 2-oji ≈°auli≈≥ rinktinƒó #Vakar≈≥ (J≈´ros) ≈°auli≈≥ 3-oji ≈°auli≈≥ rinktinƒó #Suvalkijos ≈°auli≈≥ 4-oji ≈°auli≈≥ rinktinƒó #Alfonso Smetonos 5-oji ≈°auli≈≥ rinktinƒó #Gen.

Prano Salad≈æiaus 9-oji ≈°auli≈≥ rinktinƒó #Karaliaus Mindaugo 10-oji ≈°auli≈≥ rinktinƒó Membership After Lithuania re-established independence in 1990, the organization was restored but it has not regained its former popularity or influence. Current membership of the Lithuanian Riflemen's Union is 11,000 (in the interwar period it was 62,000). 50% of members are Young Riflemen (11‚Äì18 years old), 40% are Combat Riflemen (18 years old until death) and the remaining are Non-combat Riflemen. The LRU greatly values its traditions, so the activities are similar to what they were in the past: there are sport and culture activities, the LRU journal Trimitas is published, the members are encouraged to take interest in the history of the country. According to the law on the Lithuanian Riflemen's Union, any Lithuanian citizen who is over 11 and speaks the official language can join the Union. The members are divided into two groups: 1\\\\. Young riflemen ‚Äì youth, 11‚Äì18 years old. All young riflemen give an honorary pledge when joining the Union. The young riflemen receive training based on a 4 level programme. On each level they study Lithuanian history, receive training in leadership, as well military training. At the end of the level they pass an examination, and get a certificate and a sign. Starting in 2002, young riflemen summer camps, as well as summer courses and the international training camp \\"≈Ωalgiris\\", are organised every summer. 2\\\\. Riflemen ‚Äì persons over 18, who give a rifleman's oath. The riflemen are preparing for armed and unarmed resistance. The LRU Command also has an Honorary Guard company, a sport and technology club and a LRU orchestra. Riflemen belonging to the fighting units guard various locations in Lithuania. The LRU operates according to a law on LRU, adopted by the Lithuanian parliament in 2010, and a Statute approved by the Ministry of Defence. The highest ruling body of the Union is the Conference of Members. It decides on the most important matters of the Organisation, adopts decisions and approves the Commander of the LRU who is selected by the Minister of Defence. The current Commander of the LRU is reserve col. lt. Liudas Gumbinas, who started his term in July 2014. The LRU actively cooperates with the governmental institutions: the Lithuanian military, Police department, Fire and Rescue Department, Lithuanian State Border Guard Service and others. Riflemen students Training exercises of young riflemen The LRU also includes a riflemen student corporation SAJA. The word ‚ÄúsajaÀÆ is a Lithuanian neologism, coined by riflemen students for the word ‚ÄúcorporationÀÆ, when they created the first student riflemen corporation in Vytautas Magnus University in 1934. In 2007 a club for riflemen students was established, and on 19 May 2010 it became the Lithuanian riflemen student corporation SAJA. The corporation aims to promote the riflemen union in universities, to unite riflemen students. The corporation has sections in Vilnius, Kaunas and Klaipƒóda. Members participate in the activities of the LRU, help in organizing the summer camps for young riflemen, cooperate with other university organisations. Riflemen Union in Exile In Chicago, on 7 March 1954, the riflemen who had fled Lithuania due to World War II declared the re-establishment of the LRU, under the name of the National Guard of Lithuania in Exile. The main activists included Mantautas, P≈´tvytƒó-Mantautienƒó, Valatkaitis, Kalmantas and others. Sections of the organisation were active in the United States, the UK, Canada, and Australia. Currently, the National Guard of Lithuania in Exile forms an integral part of the LRU. It is headed by Julius Butkus and is active in the United States and Canada.

This is one of the oldest heraldic symbols used in Lithuania. It is also called the Jagiellonian cross because it was used by the Polish King and the Grand Duke of Lithuania Jogaila. During the Lithuanian Wars of Independence Vytis cross became a state military award. The current statute of the LRU states that the symbol of the Union is a golden (yellow) double cross, set in a stylised frame of golden (yellow) oak leaves. In 1919-1940 the riflemen received member badges with numbers. There was also a separate badge for supporters. The badges were worn not only on uniforms but also on civil clothing. The rifleman's badge is a white darkened metal shield, with a contour of a double cross inside. The height of the badge is 47 mm, and the width is 27 mm. The sign is attached by a metal wrench. A miniature of a rifleman's badge is 20 mm high and 12 mm wide.

The album achieved commercial success in the UK, and was well received by music critics.  Content  Around about the time of the album's release, frontman Jason Lytle commented that the album \\"represents the closest I've been to singing in the first person, writing passionately\\".  Release  Sumday was released on May 13, 2003 by record label V2. The album is the group's highest charting in the UK, peaking at No. 22. By 2006, the album had sold 110,000 copies.  Singles  Three singles were released from the album: \\"El Caminos in the West\\", which reached No. 48 on the UK Singles Chart; \\"Now It's On\\", which reached No. 23; and \\"I'm on Standby\\". An expanded version of the album was released five months later, with a bonus disc of songs recorded live at the Glastonbury Festival in 2003 (tracks 1‚Äì6) as well as three tracks taken from The Black Sessions in Paris (tracks 7‚Äì9).  Critical reception  The album was well received by music critics. PopMatters viewed the album as one where Lytle had decided to \\"tone down on the experimentation, and concentrate on developing some terrific melodies\\", calling it \\"really the next logical step for the band\\". He commented on similarities to the Alan Parsons Project (\\"Now It's On\\"), ELO (\\"The Go in the Go-for-It\\") and John Lennon (\\"Lost on Yer Merry Way\\"), and noted an improvement in Lytle's songwriting. The CMJ New Music Report made it their 'essential release' in May 2003, calling it a \\"genuinely wholehearted work\\", and in their end-of-year review placed it at No. 7 in their list of the top albums of the year. Jim DeRogatis, in his book Turn on Your Mind: Four Decades of Great Psychedelic Rock, viewed the melodies as \\"even more effervescent and more memorable\\" than on The Sophtware Slump. Sophie Best of The Age called it \\"another sprawling sonic Grandaddy adventure, shimmering with wistful sincerity and rural-tinged psychedelia\\". NME gave it a grade of 8/10, writing that the songs sound \\"pretty much like Neil Young if he'd heard an Aphex Twin record\\". Robert Christgau of The Village Voice gave the album a one-star honorable mention rating and cited \\"The Group Who Couldn't Say\\" and \\"Stray Dog and the Chocolate Shake\\" as highlights. A less favourable review came from Heather Phares of AllMusic, who described the record as being \\"bland and complacent\\", opining that it failed to live up to the expectations of The Sophtware Slump.

Top: The gene is essentially turned off. There is no lactose to inhibit the repressor, so the repressor binds to the operator, which obstructs the RNA polymerase from binding to the promoter and making lactase. Bottom: The gene is turned on. Lactose is inhibiting the repressor, allowing the RNA polymerase to bind with the promoter, and express the genes, which synthesize lactase. Eventually, the lactase will digest all of the lactose, until there is none to bind to the repressor. The repressor will then bind to the operator, stopping the manufacture of lactase. In molecular genetics, a repressor is a DNA- or RNA-binding protein that inhibits the expression of one or more genes by binding to the operator or associated silencers. A DNA-binding repressor blocks the attachment of RNA polymerase to the promoter, thus preventing transcription of the genes into messenger RNA. An RNA-binding repressor binds to the mRNA and prevents translation of the mRNA into protein. This blocking of expression is called repression. Function If an inducer, a molecule that initiates the gene expression, is present, then it can interact with the repressor protein and detach it from the operator. RNA polymerase then can transcribe the message (expressing the gene). A corepressor is a molecule that can bind to repressor and make it bind to the operator tightly, which decreases transcription. A repressor that binds with a corepressor is termed an aporepressor or inactive repressor. One type of aporepressor is the trp repressor, an important metabolic protein in bacteria. The above mechanism of repression is a type of a feedback mechanism because it only allows transcription to occur if a certain condition is present: the presence of specific inducer(s). Within the eukaryotic genome are regions of DNA known as silencers. These DNA sequences bind to repressors to partially or fully repress the expression of a gene. Silencers can be located several bases upstream or downstream from the actual promoter of the gene. Repressors can also have two binding sites: one for the silencer region and one for the promoter. This causes chromosome looping, allowing the promoter region and the silencer region to come to close proximity. Examples=lac operon lacZYA transcribes the proteins needed for lactose breakdown. lacI synthesizes the repressor of the lacZYA gene. The gene lacI is situated immediately upstream of lacZYA but is transcribed from a different promoter. The lacI gene synthesizes LacI repressor protein. The LacI repressor protein represses lacZYA by binding to the operator sequence lacO. The lacZYA repressor is constitutively expressed. It is always bound to the operator region of the promoter, which interferes with the ability of RNA polymerase (RNAP) to begin transcription of the lacZYA operon. In the presence of the inducer allolactose, the repressor changes conformation and falls off the operator. RNAP is then able to bind to the promoter and begin transcription of the lacZYA gene.Slonczewski, Joan, and John Watkins. Foster. Microbiology: An Evolving Science. New York: W.W. Norton &, 2009. Print. met operon An example of a repressor protein is the methionine repressor MetJ. MetJ interacts with DNA bases via a ribbon-helix-helix (RHH) motif. MetJ is a homodimer consisting of two monomers, which each provides a beta ribbon and an alpha helix. Together, the beta ribbons of each monomer come together to form an antiparallel beta-sheet which binds to the DNA operator (\\"Met box\\") in its major groove. Once bound, the MetJ dimer interacts with another MetJ dimer bound to the complementary strand of the operator via its alpha helices. AdoMet binds to a pocket in MetJ that does not overlap the site of DNA binding. The Met box has the sequence AGACGTCT which is a palindrome (it shows dyad symmetry) allowing the same sequence to be recognised on either strand of the DNA. The junction between C and G in the middle of the Met box contains a pyrimidine-purine step that becomes positively supercoiled forming a kink in the phosphodiester backbone. This is how the protein checks for the recognition site as it allows the DNA duplex to follow the shape of the protein. In other words, recognition happens through indirect readout of the structural parameters of the DNA, rather than via specific base sequence recognition. Each MetJ dimer contains two binding sites for the cofactor S-Adenosyl methionine (SAM) which is a product in the biosynthesis of methionine. When SAM is present, it binds to the MetJ protein, increasing its affinity for its cognate operator site, which halts transcription of genes involved in methionine synthesis. When SAM concentration becomes low, the repressor dissociates from the operator site, allowing more methionine to be produced.

Biography Mathias was born in Whitland, Carmarthenshire. A child prodigy, he started playing the piano at the age of three and began composing at the age of five. At Aberystwyth University Mathias was a member of the Elizabethan Madrigal Singers and wrote 'Gloria in Excelsis Deo' for them in 1954. He studied at the Royal Academy of Music under Lennox Berkeley, where he was elected a Fellow in 1965. In 1968, he was awarded the Bax Society Prize of the Harriet Cohen International Music Award. He was professor of music and head of department in the University of Wales, Bangor, from 1970 until 1988. His compositions include large scale works, including an opera, The Servants (1980), three symphonies and three piano concertos. Much of his music was written for the Anglican choral tradition, most famously the anthem Let the people praise Thee, O God written for the July 1981 royal wedding of the Prince and Princess of Wales, which had a television audience of an estimated 1 billion people worldwide. Mathias wrote his Sinfonietta ‚Äì initially called Dance Suite ‚Äì for the Leicestershire Schools Symphony Orchestra (LSSO) in late 1966, and it received its first performance at Leicester De Montfort Hall during the 1967 Schools Festival. It was also included in the orchestra's tour programme for Denmark and Germany later in the year. The LSSO made the first commercial recording of Sinfonietta for the Pye Golden Guinea label in July 1967 under the direction of the composer (see external links below). He founded the North Wales International Music Festival in St Asaph in 1972 and directed it until his death, aged 57, in 1992.

Origin and early career Ayyubid dominion before Mamluks took power in Egypt. Aybak (', moon; baig, commander) was an Emir/commander of Turkic origin who served with other Turkmens in the court of the Ayyubid sultan as-Salih Ayyub and therefore was known among the Bahri Mamluks as Aybak al-Turkmani. He raised to the position of Emir (commander) and worked as a Jashnkir (taster of the sultan's food and drink, or cupbearer)Al-Maqrizi, p.463/ vol.1 and used the rank of a Khawanja (Sultan's accountant).See note 1. After the death of as-Salih Ayyub during the Frankish invasion of Damietta in 1249 and the murder of his heir and son Turanshah in 1250, Shajar al-Durr, the widow of as-Salih Ayyub, with the help and support of the Mamluks of her late husband, seized the throne and became the Sultana of Egypt. The Ayyubids lost control over Egypt. Both the Ayyubids in Syria and the Abbasid Caliph al-Musta'sim in Baghdad defied the Mamluk move in Egypt and refused to recognize Shajar al-Durr as a SultanaThe Abbasid Caliph al-Musta'sim sent a message from Baghdad to the Mamluks in Egypt that said :\\"If you do not have men there tell us so we can send you men.\\"- Al-Maqrizi, p.464/vol1 but the Mamluks in Egypt renewed their oath to the new Sultana, and she appointed Aybak to the important position of Atabeg (commander in chief). Rise to power (1250) Feeling uneasy when the Syrian Emirs refused to pay homage to Shajar al-Durr and granted Damascus to an-Nasir Yusuf the Ayyubid emir of Aleppo, Shajar al-Durr married Aybak then abdicated and passed the throne to Aybak after she ruled Egypt for 80 days, starting on May 2, 1250.Al-Maqrizi, pp.462-463/vol.1 Aybak, from the end of July 1250 the new sultan of Egypt, was given the royal name al-Malik al-Muizz. Until then, Aybak relied foremost on four Mamluks: Faris ad-Din Aktai, Baibars al- Bunduqdari, Qutuz and Bilban al-Rashidi.Al-Maqrizi, p.472/vol.1Ibn Taghri, pp.103-273/ The Sultanate of al-Muizz Aybak al-Turkumani. Aybak's formal rule ended after just five days. To consolidate his position of Aybak, and attempting to satisfy their opponents in Syria and Baghdad, the Bahri Mamluks installed the 6-year-old al-Ashraf Musa,Also known as Al-Nasir Salah ad-Din Yusuf. ‚Äì Al-Maqrizi, p.464/vol.1- Ibn Taghri, pp.103-273/ The Sultanate of al- Muizz Aybak al-Turkumani.Coins of Musa show he was a Sultan and not a co- sultan. who was one of the Syrian branch of the Ayyubid familyal-Malik Sharaf Muzafer al-Din Musa was a grandson of al-Malik al-Kamil.

In addition, and to display his loyalty to his deceased Ayyubid master as-Salih Ayyub, Aybak organised a funeral ceremony for as-Salih and buried him in the tomb which as-Salih had built for himself before his death near his madrasah in the district of Bain al-Qasrain in Cairo.Al-Maqrizi, p. 464/vol.1Shayal, p.116/vol.2The death of as-Salih Ayyub was concealed by his wife Shajar ad-Durr as Egypt was under the attack of the Seventh Crusade and his coffined body was transported by a boat in secret to the castle of al-Rudah island in the Nile where it stayed till was buried by Aybak in the Sultan's tomb near as-Salih's Madrasah. ( Al- Maqrizi, pp. 441-443/vol.1 ) See also Shajar al-Durr. Nevertheless, the actual power in Egypt was still exercised by Aybak, who had returned to his position of atabak (atabeg). Ayyubid challenge An-Nasir Yusuf sent his forces to Gaza to conquer Egypt and overthrow Aybak but his forces were defeated by Emir Faris ad-Din Aktai in October 1250. Then he led a huge army and clashed with Aybak's army near Al-Salihiyya, not far from Cairo, but at the end of the battle he was forced to flee to Damascus while his son Turanshah,Not to be confused with his namesake Sultan Turanshah the son of as-Salih Ayyub. his brother Nosrat ad-Din and al-Malik al-Ashraf the Emir of Aleppo were among the prisoners caught by Aybak's army.Ibn Taghri, PP.103-273/ The Sultanate of al- Muizz Aybak al-Turkumani. Aybak's triumphs over the Ayyobids of Syria consolidated his position as a ruler of Egypt. Through negotiation and mediation of the Abbasid Caliph, Aybak freed the Ayyubid prisoners and gained control over southern Palestine including Gaza and Jerusalem and the Syrian coast.Shayal,p.116/ vol.2 Feeling secure by his victories and his agreement with the Ayyubids, Aybak imprisoned the young Ayyubid co-sultan Musa and appointed Qutuz as vice-sultan in 1252. Rebellion In 1253 a serious rebellion led by Hisn al-Din Thalab in Upper and Middle Egypt was crushed by Aktai, the leader of the Bahri Mamluks. By defeating the Ayyubid forces of an- Nasir Yusuf and the crushing of the rebellion of Thalab the power of Emir Aktai and his Mamluks increased and they began to form a new threat to the authority of Aybak. When Aktai asked Aybak to allow him to live inside the citadelCitadel of the Mountain was the abode and court of the sultan in Cairo with his future wife who was the sister of al-Malik al-Mansour, the Emir of Hama, Aybak became convinced that Aktai and his Mamluks had the intention to overthrow him and, thus, he decided to get rid of them. Crackdown on Mamluks (1254‚Äì55) In 1254, in a conspiracy with Qutuz and a few Mamluks, Aybak invited Aktai to the citadel and had him murdered. Watching the head of Aktai thrown out from the citadel, the Bahriyya Mamluks, among them Baibars al- Bunduqdari and Qalawun al-Alfi, fled during the night to Damascus, al-Karak and the Seljuk Sultanate of R√ªm. Aybak plundered the properties of the Bahriyya Mamluks and retracted Alexandria which Aktai controlled as own domain since 1252. Those who could not flee were either imprisoned or executed. As soon as he finished with Aktai and his Bahriyya Mamluks, Aybak dethroned the child co-sultan al-Ashraf Musa and sent him back to his aunts' house, which was his home before they had made him a co-sultan. Now Aybak was the absolute and sole ruler of Egypt and parts of Syria, but shortly afterwards he settled a new agreement with an-Nasir Yusuf, which limited his power to Egypt only. In 1255 a new rebellion led by his namesake Izz al-Din Aybak al-Afram arose in upper Egypt and forces of an-Nasir Yusuf arrived to the Egyptian border, this time accompanied by the Bahriyya Mamluks who had fled to Syria, including Baibars al-Bunduqdari and Qalawun al-Alfi. End Being in need to form an alliance with an ally who could help him against the threat of the Mamluks who had fled to Syria,Shayal, p.119/ vol.2 Aybak decided in 1257 to marry the daughter of Badr ad-Din Lu'lu', the emir of Mosul. Shajar al-Durr, who already had disputes with AybakAybak's conflict with the Mamluks and his attempt to increase his supremacy over political matters had its effect on his relation with Shajar Al-Durr. According to Al-Maqrizi, Aybak decided to liquidate Shajar Al-Durr after he was warned that she contacted An-Nasir Yusuf and promised him to make him the Sultan of Egypt. Al-Maqrizi, pp.493-494/vol.1 felt betrayed by the man who she made sultan, and had him murdered after he had ruled Egypt seven years. On the day of his death he was about 60 years old and had a few sons, among them Nasir ad-Din Khan and al-Mansur Ali. Aybak's 11-year-old son Ali was installed by his loyal Mamluks (Mu'iziyya Mamluks), who were led by Qutuz.Qasim,p.44 The new sultan took the royal name al-Malik al-Mansur Nour ad-Din Ali with Qutuz as a vice-sultan. Impact Aybak was not liked nor respected by the Egyptians though he was remembered by the historian as a courageous and generous Sultan.In Sirat al-Zahir Baibars, which is a fiction mixed with reality and a product of folklore, Aybak appears as a wicked and a feeble man. See Sirat al-Zahir Baibars. Aybak ruled in a turbulent time. In addition to his conflicts with an-Nasir Yusuf in Syria and Emir Aktai and his Mamluks in Egypt, there were threats from external forces, namely the Crusaders and Louis IX of France who were in Acre waiting for a chance to score a success against the Muslims after their humiliating defeat in Egypt in 1250,See Battle of Al Mansurah and Battle of Fariskur and the Mongols led by Hulagu who were starting to raid the eastern borders of the Islamic world.In 1252 during Aybak reign Mongols raided towns and territories on the eastern border of the Islamic world. ‚Äì Al-Maqrizi, p.477/vol.1 Before their deaths, Aybak and Shajar al-Durr firmly established the Mamluk dynasty that would ultimately repulse the Mongols, expel the European Crusaders from the Holy Land, and would remain the most powerful political force in the Middle East until the coming of the Ottomans.

Its first known appearance is in Wedderburn's Complaynt of Scotland (1548) under the name \\"The Frog cam to the Myl dur\\", though this is in Scots rather than English. There is a reference in the London Company of Stationers' Register of 1580 to \\"A Moste Strange Weddinge of the Frogge and the Mouse.\\" There are many texts of the ballad; however the oldest known musical version is in Thomas Ravenscroft's Melismata in 1611. Summary Frog rides to ask Miss Mouse to marry him. She is willing but must ask permission of Uncle Rat. In other versions such as \\"King Kong Kitchie Kitchie Ki-Me-O\\" by Chubby Parker, Frog fights and kills Miss Mouse's other suitors (an owl, bat and bumblebee) after they interrupt his proposal. Uncle Rat's permission received, the two work out details of the wedding. Some versions end with a cat, snake or other creature devouring the couple and wedding guests. Sometimes Frog gets away, but is later swallowed by a duck. See \\"Frog Went a-Courting\\" at Wikisource for one version of the lyrics. Usually, the final verse states that there's a piece of food on the shelf, and that if the listener wants to hear more verses, they have to sing it themselves. The notes on this song in Cazden et al. (pp. 524‚Äì532) constitute probably the best succinct summary available on variants of this piece. Origin Spaeth has a note claiming that the original version of this was supposed to refer to Fran√ßois, Duke of Anjou's wooing of Elizabeth I of England; however, this was in 1579 and the original Scottish version was already published. If the second known version (1611, in Melismata, also reprinted in Chappell) were the oldest, this might be possible ‚Äî there are seeming political references to \\"Gib, our cat\\" and \\"Dick, our Drake.\\" But the Wedderburn text, which at least anticipates the song, predates the reign of Queen Elizabeth by nine years, and Queen Mary by four. If it refers to any queen at all, it would seemingly have to be Mary Stuart. Evelyn K. Wells, however, in the liner notes to the LP Brave Boys; New England traditions in folk music (New World Records 239, 1977), suggests that the original may have been satirically altered in 1580 when it was recorded in the register of the London Company of Stationers, as this would have been at the height of the unpopular courtship. According to Albert Jack in his book \\"Pop Goes the Weasel, The Secret Meanings of Nursery Rhymes\\" (pp. 33‚Äì37, copyright 2008), the earliest known version of the song was published in 1549 as \\"The Frog Came to the Myl Dur\\" in Robert Wedderburn's \\"Complaynt of Scotland\\". He states that in 1547 the Scottish Queen Consort, Mary of Guise, under attack from Henry VIII, sought to marry her daughter Princess Mary (later Mary Queen of Scots), \\"Miss Mouse\\" to the three-year old French Prince Louis, the \\"frog\\". The song resurfaced a few years later, with changes, when another French (frog) wooing caused concern‚Äîthat of the Duke of Anjou and Queen Elizabeth I in 1579. Elizabeth even nicknamed Anjou, her favorite suitor, \\"the frog\\". Another theory traces the song to Suffolk: \\"Roley, Poley, Gammon and Spinach\\" refer to four families of Suffolk notables, Rowley, Poley, Bacon and Green. Popular culture The song has been heard by many people (as \\"Froggie Went a-Courtin) in the 1955 Tom and Jerry cartoon Pecos Pest, which uses a version arranged and performed by Shug Fisher, in character as \\"Uncle Pecos.\\" In Pecos Pest, Jerry's Uncle Pecos stays with him while getting ready for a television appearance, and continues to pluck Tom's whiskers to use as guitar strings throughout the cartoon. It is an improvised version with many lyrics that are unintelligible, and many changed. For example, he stutters and gives up when he tries to say \\"hickory tree\\" and says \\"way down yonder by the ...\\", stammers out the names of several types of trees, finally settling (ironically) on \\"eucalyptus\\". He also mentions while continuing the music \\"That's the hard part right in there, n-n-n-n-nephew!\\" and \\"there's a yodel in thar somewhar, but it's a little too high f'r me.\\" Some refer to this song as \\"Crambone\\", as it is repeated at the end of many lines and said more clearly than the other words in this version. For example, the line is \\"Froggie went a-courtin' he did ride/Crambone\\". Fisher, in character as Pecos, delivers the coda with a glottal stutter on the letter c. Woody Guthrie's version used \\"Hey-hey\\", and Bob Dylan's version used \\"uh-huh\\" in the same way after several lines. Other examples in film and TV include: * In the 1941 film Sergeant York, sung by Lee White. * Keith (played by Roger Sloman) plays a version on banjo before being distracted by a 'lovely robin' in Mike Leigh's Nuts in May. * In \\"The Muppets Valentine Show\\" (a 1973 pilot version of The Muppet Show), Kermit the Frog goes a-courtin' Miss Mousey. * A 1977 animated version of the folk tune features a happier ending for Froggie and Miss Mousie: they honeymoon around the world and give birth to two frog/mouse combination children and complete the song with \\"If you want more, you've got to sing it yourself!\\"- *In the 1980 film, Little Darlings, the girls are singing it when Angel (Kristy McNichol) returns after having sex with Randy in the boathouse. *In the 1983 Blake Edwards remake of The Man Who Loved Women (1983 film), Barry Corbin's character sings this song as he undresses for sex with his wife, played by Kim Basinger. * Ethan Hawke's character Troy Dyer is singing the song on his guitar at the end of the film Reality Bites when Winona Ryder's character Lelaina Pierce comes and tackles him on the couch. * A version is sung in the 1993 The World of Peter Rabbit and Friends animated adaption of The Tailor of Gloucester. This is one of the versions that uses the lyric \\"Kitty Alone\\". * Danny Tanner briefly sings the song while giving his oldest daughter D.J. guitar lessons in the sitcom Full House, in the episode \\"The Seven Month Inch (Part 2)\\". *Thomas Raith hums the song during a standoff with the Denarians in Jim Butcher's Small Favor, a novel of the Dresden Files. * The Dexter's Laboratory episode \\"Hamhocks and Armlocks\\" begins with the titular Dexter and his family singing the song on a road trip. * Bender sings a version of the song in the Futurama episode \\"Bendin' in the Wind\\". * Bobby Hill is heard to sing the opening verse on an episode of King of the Hill. * It has also been used in the episode of The Colbert Report that aired on May 23, 2007. This version was sung by Burl Ives. Colbert also sung a portion of the song on the June 18, 2007 episode, during an interview with Toby Keith. * The song was performed on The Fast Show by the character Bob Fleming as one of 'Bob Fleming's Country Favourites'. * An explicit adaption of the \\"King Kong Kitchie-Kitchie Ki-Me-Oh\\" version, named \\"What Do You Say\\" by Mickey Avalon, appeared on the soundtrack of the 2009 film The Hangover. * Mike Oldfield covered as a B side of Mike Oldfield's Single. * In Six Feet Under Season 4, Episode 3 \\"Parallel Play\\", Russell Corwin, played by Ben Foster, sings the chorus over and over on a stage at a party. * The song is frequently sung in The Return of Peter Grimm, an RKO film released in 1935, and the second screen adaptation of David Belasco's Broadway hit. The film starred Lionel Barrymore. * In 1941, the German composer Paul Hindemith wrote a series of variations \\"Frog He Went a Courting\\" for cello and piano. * In Van Helsing Season 2, Episode 11 \\"Be True\\", Sam (Christopher Heyerdahl), repeatedly sings and listens to the song. Recordings The song has been recorded by Almeda Riddle, Woody Guthrie, Pete Seeger and many others. Folk singer Burl Ives performed perhaps the most well-known and kid-friendly version, in which Frog and Miss Mousie are wed. * Elvis Presley version rehearsal jam * Thomas Ravenscroft version (1611) ** \\"T.

It is a spin-off to the Micro Machines games, the main difference being that players control tiny characters where a few racetracks feature the use of vehicles. The North American version was sponsored by Fox Kids, and so the game's name was changed there. Plot Micro Maniacs is set in a time where the Earth's resources are being depleted and the very planet is at risk. However a scientist named Dr. Minimizer has an idea: using a device he calls \\"The Minimizer Ray\\", he will shrink the planet's population to 1/360 of its original size, and so create a world more suitable to our current status. If this is to be successful, the doctor needs to create a supersoldier: somebody who can prepare the planet for us when we are eventually minimized. In order to do this, the doctor enlists the help of 12 volunteers for an experiment. The experiment consists of racetracks that are considered various dangerous environments as to ascertain the suitable skills for the supersoldier. Gameplay The player is controlling the character V4, who according to the data on the right is in third in Challenge mode. The timer is in the top-left of the screen and the player's power-ups in the bottom-left. As opposed to previous games in the series, players control these small volunteers more than vehicles, the main difference is that the volunteers are able to jump and use individual abilities. The volunteers (or characters) are each slightly different. None are particularly realistic, but their unusual characteristics allow the characters to make use of various power-ups. These are used to attack your opponents in a race, and include things like black holes, atomic blasts, and laser mines. Similar to the other games in the Micro Machines series, each course is based in a different environment, like a bathroom, a kitchen, a laboratory, a garage, and a bedroom. The goal is to race through the level and be the first to cross the finish line. Each course is marked out with a substance in the environment. These are related to the level in question, and include things like toothpaste, fish food and baked beans. Some courses require the use of vehicles like jet-skis, bees, motor scooters and skateboards. ;Challenge :A 1 player only mode. The racer is up against 4 AI opponents in a 3 lap race. The player must come in 1st or 2nd to win a race and advance a row. (Except for the Final Round, where 1st place is the absolute win condition.) ;Time Trial :In Time Trial mode, 1 to 8 players can race, using either one, or separate controllers. There are four Time Trial modes: *TT Free Play - 1 player attempts to earn a best time. *TT Challenge - 1 player has to beat a set lap time within three laps to progress up rows. *TT Multiplayer - 2 to 8 players attempt to set and beat opponents lap times. *TT Tournament - Similar to TT Multiplayer, but the aim to be the first player to a set number of points ;Vs. :In Versus mode, 1-8 players have to make the other opponents disappear off the screen by running as far in front as possible to score points. The player who either fills up their points gauge, passes the finish line on the final lap with the most points, or the last person standing in Play-Off (a Sudden Death mode activated if players have the same number of points upon crossing the finish line on the last lap) . Players are defined in 8 colors. There are 3 Vs. modes: *Single Player Vs. where 1 player must race against one to seven AI opponents (changed via the main Game Settings) which progresses in a similar fashion to Challenge mode. *Multiplayer Vs., where 2 to 8 players race to get the most points. *Vs. Tournament, where 2 to 8 players race to get the most wins. ;Vs. Teams :Vs. Teams is similar to Vs. mode, with the core difference being to score points for their team. This mode requires 3 to 8 players and contains four teams to choose from. ;Training :Before any of the races begin, a training mode is started. Players can train in the circles as the level loads. This mode will also show who you are up against and any vehicles that level uses. ;Bonus Tracks :In this mode, the player runs through a maze. The aim is to collect all 30 power ups within the time limit. If the player wins, they win an extra life. If they lose, they win nothing. There are 4 different bonus tracks: Blue, Green, Red and Yellow. These tracks can only be entered via Challenge, TT Challenge or Single Player Vs. if the player wins 3 races in a row in 1st place. Reception Mark Nix of IGN gave the game a score of 7.5/10. He praised the gameplay and variety, and said \\"there is still no better reason to own a multitap than Codemaster's [sic] Micro series\\".

Originally designed by Marian Gryszkiewicz, it was manufactured at the ≈Åucznik Arms Factory (Fabryka Broni ≈Åucznik) in Radom. An improved model was MAG-98, and currently is MAG-08. With the MAG-95 pistol the designers abandoned their previous design practices based on the use of the 9√ó18mm Makarov cartridge and instead utilized a Western-influenced approach involving the 9√ó19mm Parabellum cartridge and some of the latest safety and other design techniques. The MAG-95 incorporates most of the user facilities to which shooters in the West have become accustomed, but which have been absent from most Eastern Bloc pistols until recently. The PR-15 Ragun pistol is development of MAG. Development In 1993, they started work on the new pistol, at the ≈Åucznik Arms Factory in Radom, Poland. It was intended primarily for the Polish Army, to replace both the obsolete P-64 and the P-83 Wanad pistols. The obvious caliber choice was the more powerful, NATO standard 9√ó19mm Parabellum (9mm Luger), to replace the old 9√ó18mm Makarov. Since the Army had not worked out technical conditions for a pistol by then, the factory worked them out on its own, and decided to design a pistol of a classic construction, utilizing the experience of the world's best designs. The lead designer was Marian Gryszkiewicz. The gun was designed by late 1993. In 1994 prototypes were tested, and an information series appeared in 1995. The pistol's operation principle is the Short recoil operation, with a mechanism similar to that of the Browning HP. In 1995 the pistol was evaluated by the Polish Army. It had advantages over a competitor, the WIST-94, such as better reliability, durability and safety (better protection against accidental discharge, when dropped). However, the MAG model was rejected by the Army, because it did not meet technical specifications, that were set in late 1993, exceeding mass (800g) and dimensional criteria (190x135x33 mm).Sitarski, M. Dzieje pewnego MAG-a, p. 20-27 In 1996 a lighter variant, the MAG-98, was designed with an aluminum frame (initially designated MAG-96), but despite the fact that the Army showed interest, it was still too heavy, by 75g, and had the same dimensions. So the competitor, the WIST-94, was accepted into ordnance in 1999. In the following years, the MAG was produced for the Polish Border Guard and Prison Guard (Stra≈º Wiƒôzienna) and for the civilian market, though in small series (the market for civilian guns in Poland was very small due to restrictive gun laws). The Polish Police tested the gun, but others pistols (the Glock pistol and Walther P99) won public procurements organized by the Polish Police due to their lower price. The last produced variant was the MAG-98C, for sport shooting, with a 20-round magazine and adjustable sights. Also, a small series (up to 100 pistols) was made for the U.S. market, with a 10-round magazine. The production ceased in 2000, when the manufacturer went bankrupt.Powr√≥t MAG-a The pistol has a good reputation among users: It is considered a precise, well balanced and durable weapon. Its mass leads to good stability during firing. It was simpler and cheaper than the WIST-94 and, in addition, some Army users preferred the MAG as a personal sidearm. In 2008, the new variant MAG-08 was introduced, with a Picatinny rail and minor other improvements, developed by the manufacturer's successor, Fabryka Broni ≈Åucznik. As of 2008, it has not yet been widely distributed. Design details The MAG-95 pistol relies to a large extent on design features from the later Browning designs, and others, combining features from several weapons into one pistol. The locking system is the widely used dropping barrel and cam action of the Browning series. This is combined with a double-action trigger mechanism combined with a hammer decocking lever which allows the external hammer to be lowered in safety when a round is chambered. Only a positive 50 N pull on the trigger will allow the hammer to recock for firing the round. The barrel is chrome plated to prolong its life and to permit easier cleaning. The MAG-95 is suitable for use by both right and left-handed users and is designed for two-handed operation. It is claimed that the pistols are well balanced to produce greater accuracy when rapid firing. The box magazine contains 15 rounds; optional 20 and 10-round magazines are available. Other options include a laser target indicator to be mounted in front of the trigger guard. The standard finish is a matte black lacquer coating but a bright or matte chrome finish is optional. The MAG-98 incorporates a buffer while the MAG-98c, also with a buffer, is primarily a sporting pistol.

Some may have no symptoms. Other may have trouble starting urination, urinary incontinence, or frequent urination. Complications may include recurrent urinary tract infections and urinary retention. Cystocele and a prolapsed urethra often occur together and is called a cystourethrocele. Cystocele can negatively affect quality of life. Causes include childbirth, constipation, chronic cough, heavy lifting, hysterectomy, genetics, and being overweight. The underlying mechanism involves weakening of muscles and connective tissue between the bladder and vagina. Diagnosis is often based on symptoms and examination. If the cystocele causes few symptoms, avoiding heavy lifting or straining may be all that is recommended. In those with more significant symptoms a vaginal pessary, pelvic muscle exercises, or surgery may be recommended. The type of surgery typically done is known as a colporrhaphy. The condition becomes more common with age. About a third of women over the age of 50 are affected to some degree. Signs and symptoms The symptoms of a cystocele may include: * a vaginal bulge * the feeling that something is falling out of the vagina * the sensation of pelvic heaviness or fullness * difficulty starting a urine stream * a feeling of incomplete urination * frequent or urgent urination * fecal incontinence * frequent urinary tract infections * back and pelvic pain * fatigue * painful sexual intercourse * bleeding A bladder that has dropped from its normal position and into the vagina can cause some forms of incontinence and incomplete emptying of the bladder. Complications Complications may include urinary retention, recurring urinary tract infections and incontinence. The anterior vaginal wall may actually protrude though the vaginal introitus (opening). This can interfere with sexual activity. Recurrent urinary tract infections are common for those who have urinary retention. In addition, though cystocele can be treated, some treatments may not alleviate troubling symptoms, and further treatment may need to be performed. Cystocele may affect the quality of life, women who have cystocele tend to avoid leaving their home and avoid social situations. The resulting incontinence puts women at risk of being placed in a nursing home or long term care facility.  Cause  A cystocele occurs when the muscles, fascia, tendons and connective tissues between a woman's bladder and vagina weaken, or detach. The type of cystocele that can develop can be due to one, two or three vaginal wall attachment failures: the midline defect, the paravaginal defect, and the transverse defect. The midline defect is a cystocele caused by the overstretching of the vaginal wall; the paravaginal defect is the separation of the vaginal connective tissue at the arcus tendineus fascia pelvis; the transverse defect is when the pubocervical fascia becomes detached from the top (apex) of the vagina. There is some pelvic prolapse in 40‚Äì60% of women who have given birth. Muscle injuries have been identified in women with cystocele. These injuries are more likely to occur in women who have given birth than those who have not. These muscular injuries result in less support to the anterior vaginal wall. Some women with connective tissue disorders are predisposed to developing anterior vaginal wall collapse. Up to one third of women with Marfan syndrome have a history of vaginal wall collapse. Ehlers- Danlos syndrome in women is associated with a rate of 3 out of 4.  Risk factors  Risk factors for developing a cystocele are: * an occupation involving or history of heavy lifting * pregnancy and childbirth * chronic lung disease/smoking * family history of cystocele * exercising incorrectly * ethnicity (risk is greater for Hispanic and whites) * hypoestrogenism * pelvic floor trauma * connective tissue disorders * spina bifida * hysterectomy * cancer treatment of pelvic organs * childbirth; correlates to the number of births * forceps delivery * age * chronically high intra-abdominal pressures ** chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ** constipation ** obesity Connective tissue disorders predispose women to developing cystocele and other pelvic organ prolapse. The tissues tensile strength of the vaginal wall decreases when the structure of the collagen fibers change and become weaker.  Diagnosis  There are two types of cystocele. The first is distension. This is thought to be due to the overstretching of the vaginal wall and is most often associated with aging, menopause and vaginal delivery. It can be observed when the rugae are less visible or even absent. The second type is displacement. Displacement is the detachment or abnormal elongation of supportive tissue. The initial assessment of cystocele can include a pelvic exam to evaluate leakage of urine when the women is asked to bear down or give a strong cough (Valsalva maneuver), and the anterior vaginal wall measured and evaluated for the appearance of a cystocele. If a woman has difficulty emptying her bladder, the clinician may measure the amount of urine left in the woman's bladder after she urinates called the postvoid residual. This is measured by ultrasound. A voiding cystourethrogram is a test that involves taking x-rays of the bladder during urination. This x-ray shows the shape of the bladder and lets the doctor see any problems that might block the normal flow of urine. A urine culture and sensitivity test will assess the presence of a urinary tract infection that may be related to urinary retention. Other tests may be needed to find or rule out problems in other parts of the urinary system. Differential diagnosis will be improved by identifying possible inflammation of the Skene's glands and Bartholin glands. Grading A number of scales exist to grade the severity of a cystocele. The pelvic organ prolapse quantification (POP-Q) assessment, developed in 1996, quantifies the descent of the cystocele into the vagina. The POP-Q provides reliable description of the support of the anterior, posterior and apical vaginal wall. It uses objective and precise measurements to the reference point, the hymen. Cystocele and prolapse of the vagina from other causes is staged using POP-Q criteria can range from good support (no descent into the vagina) reported as a POP-Q stage 0 or I to a POP-Q score of IV which includes prolapse beyond the hymen. It also used to quantifies the movement of other structures into the vaginal lumen and their descent. The Baden‚ÄìWalker Halfway Scoring System is used as the second most used system and assigns the classifications as mild (grade 1) when the bladder droops only a short way into the vagina; (grade 2) cystocele, the bladder sinks far enough to reach the opening of the vagina; and (grade 3) when the bladder bulges out through the opening of the vagina.  Classifications  Cystocele can be further described as being apical, medial, lateral, or mediolateral. Apical cystocele is located upper third of the vagina. The structures involved are the endopelvic fascia and ligaments. The cardinal ligaments and the uterosacral ligaments suspend the upper vaginal-dome. The cystocele in this region of the vagina is thought to be due to a cardinal ligament defect. Medial cystocele forms in the mid-vagina and is related to a defect in the suspension provided by to a sagittal suspension system defect in the uterosacral ligaments and pubocervical fascia. The pubocervical fascia may thin or tear and create the cystocele. An aid in diagnosis is the creation of a 'shiny' spot on the epithelium of the vagina. This defect can be assessed by MRI. Lateral cystocele forms when both the pelviperineal muscle and its ligamentous‚Äìfascial develop a defect. The ligamentous‚Äì fascial creates a 'hammock-like' suspension and support for the lateral sides of the vagina. Defects in this lateral support system results in a lack of bladder support. Cystocele that develops laterally is associated with an anatomic imbalance between anterior vaginal wall and the arcus tendineus fasciae pelvis ‚Äì the essential ligament structure.  Prevention  Cystocele may be mild enough not to result in symptoms that are troubling to a woman. In this case, steps to prevent it from worsening include: *smoking cessation *losing weight *pelvic floor strengthening *treatment of a chronic cough *maintaining healthy bowel habits **eating high fiber foods **avoiding constipation and straining Treatment Treatment options range from no treatment for a mild cystocele to surgery for a more extensive cystocele. If a cystocele is not bothersome, the clinician may only recommend avoiding heavy lifting or straining that could cause the cystocele to worsen. If symptoms are moderately bothersome, the doctor may recommend a pessary, a device placed in the vagina to hold the bladder in place and to block protrusion. Treatment can consist of a combination of non-surgical and surgical management. Treatment choice is also related to age, desire to have children, severity of impairment, desire to continue sexual intercourse and other diseases that a woman may have.  Non-surgical Cystocele is often treated by non-surgical means: * Pessary ‚Äì This is a removable device inserted into the vagina to support the anterior vaginal wall. Pessaries come in many different shapes and sizes. There are sometimes complications with the use of a pessary. * Pelvic floor muscle therapy ‚Äì Pelvic floor exercises to strengthen vaginal support can be of benefit. Specialized physical therapy can be prescribed to help strengthen the pelvic floor muscles. * Dietary changes ‚Äì Ingesting high fiber foods will aid in promoting bowel movements. * Estrogen ‚Äì intravaginal administration helps to prevent pelvic muscle atrophy  Surgery  The surgery to repair the anterior vaginal wall may be combined with other procedures that will repair the other points of pelvic organ support such as anterior-posterior repair and anterior colporrhaphy. Treatment of cystocele often accompanies the more invasive hysterectomy. Since the failure rate in cystocele repair remains high, additional surgery may be needed. Women who have surgery to repair a cystocele have a 17% of needing another operation within the next ten years. The surgical treatment of cystocele will depend on the cause of the defect and whether it occurs at the top (apex), middle, or lower part of the anterior vaginal wall. The type of surgery will also depend on the type of damage that exists between supporting structures and the vaginal wall. One of the most common surgical repairs is colporrhaphy. This surgical procedure consists of making a longitudinal folding of the vaginal tissue, suturing it into place and creating a stronger point of resistance to the intruding bladder wall. Surgical mesh is sometimes used to strengthen the anterior vaginal wall. It has a 10‚Äì50% failure rate. In some cases a surgeon may choose to use surgical mesh to strengthen the repair. During surgery, the repair of the vaginal wall consists of folding over and then suturing the existing tissue between the vagina and bladder to strengthen it. This tightens the layers of tissue to promote the replacement of the pelvic organs into their normal place. The surgery also provides more support for the bladder. This surgery is done by a surgeon specializing in gynecology and is performed in a hospital. Anesthesia varies according to the needs of each woman. Recovery may take four to six weeks. Other surgical treatment may be performed to treat cystocele. Support for the vaginal wall is accomplished with the paravaginal defect repair. This is a surgery, usually laproscopic, that is done to the ligaments and fascia through the abdomen. The lateral ligaments and supportive structures are repaired, sometimes shortened to provide additional support to the vaginal wall. Sacrocolpopexy is a procedure that stabilizes the vaginal vault (the uppermost portion of the vagina) and is often chosen as the treatment for cystocele, especially if previous surgeries were not successful. The procedure consists of attaching the vaginal vault to the sacrum. It has a success rate of 90%. Some women choose not to have surgery to close the vagina. This surgery, called colpocleisis, treats cystocele by closing the vaginal opening. This can be an option for women who no longer want to have vaginal intercourse. If an enterocele/sigmoidocele, or prolapse of the rectum/colon, is also present, the surgical treatment will take this concurrent condition into account while planning and performing the repairs. Estrogen that is administered vaginally before surgical repair can strengthen the vaginal tissue providing a more successful outcome when mesh or sutures are used for the repair. Vaginal thickness increases after estrogen therapy. Another review on the surgical management of cystocele describes a more successful treatment that more strongly attaches the ligaments and fascia to the vagina to lift and stabilize it. Post surgical complications can develop. The complications following surgical treatment of cystocele are: * side effects or reactions to anesthesia * bleeding * infection * painful intercourse * Urinary incontinence * constipation * bladder injuries * urethral injuries * urinary tract infection. * vaginal erosion due to mesh After surgery, a woman is instructed to restrict her activities and monitor herself for signs of infection such as an elevated temperature, discharge with a foul odor and consistent pain. Clinicians may recommend that sneezing, coughing, and constipation are to be avoided. Splinting the abdomen while coughing provides support to an incised area and decreases pain on coughing. This is accomplished by applying gentle pressure to the surgical site for bracing during a cough. Recurrent surgery on the pelvic organs may not be due to a failure of the surgery to correct the cystocele. Subsequent surgeries can be directly or indirectly relating to the primary surgery. Prolapse can occur at a different site in the vagina. Further surgery after the initial repair can be to treat complications of mesh displacement, pain, or bleeding. Further surgery may be needed to treat incontinence. One goal of surgical treatment is to restore the vagina and other pelvic organs to their anatomically normal positions. This may not be the outcome that is most important to the woman being treated who may only want relief of symptoms and an improvement in her quality of life. The International Urogynecological Association (IUGA) has recommended that the data collected regarding the success of cystocele and pelvic organ repairs include the presence or absence of symptoms, satisfaction and Quality of Life. Other measures of a successful outcome should include perioperative data, such as operative time and hospital stay. Standardized Healthcare Quality of Life should be part of the measure of a successful resolution of cystocele. Data regarding short- and long-term complications is included in the recommendations of the IUGA to better assess the risk‚Äìbenefit ratio of each procedure. Current investigations into the superiority of using biological grafting versus native tissue or surgical mesh indicates that using grafts provides better results.  Epidemiology  A large study found a rate of 29% over the lifetime of a woman. Other studies indicate a recurrence rate as low as 3%. In the US, greater than 200,000 surgeries are performed each year for pelvic organ prolapse and 81% of these are to correct cystocele. Cystocele occurs most frequently compared to the prolapse of other pelvic organs and structure. Cystocele is found to be three times as common as vaginal vault prolapse and twice as often as posterior vaginal wall defects. The incidence of cystocele is around 9 per 100 women-years. The highest incidence of symptoms occurs between ages of 70 and 79 years. Based on population growth statistics, the number of women with prolapse will increase by a minimum of 46% by the year 2050 in the US. Surgery to correct prolapse after hysterectomy is 3.6 per 1,000 women-years.  History  The ancient Greek method for treating cystocele Notable is the mention of cystocele in many older cultures and locations. In 1500 B.C. Egyptians wrote about the ‚Äúfalling of the womb‚Äù. In 400 B.C. a Greek physician documented his observations and treatments: \\"After the patient had been tied to a ladder-like frame, she was tipped upward so that her head was toward the bottom of the frame. The frame was then moved upward and downward more or less rapidly for approximately 3‚Äì5 min. As the patient was in an inverted position, it was thought that the prolapsing organs of the genital tract would be returned to their normal position by the force of gravity and the shaking motion.\\" Hippocrates had his own theories regarding the cause of prolapse. He thought that recent childbirth, wet feet, 'sexual excesses', exertion, and fatigue may have contributed to the condition. Polybus, Hippocrates's son-in-law, wrote: \\"a prolapsed uterus was treated by using local astringent lotions, a natural sponge packed into the vagina, or placement of half a pomegranate in the vagina.\\" In 350 A.D., another practitioner named Soranus described his treatments which stated that the pomegranate should be dipped into vinegar before insertion. Success could be enhanced if the woman was on bed rest and reduced intake of fluid and food. If the treatment was still not successful, the woman's legs were tied together for three days. In 1521, Berengario da Carpi performed the first surgical treatment for prolapse. This was to tie a rope around the prolapse, tighten it for two days until it was no longer viable and cut it off. Wine, aloe, and honey were then applied to the stump. In the 1700s, a Swiss gynecologist, Peyer, published a description of a cystocele. He was able to describe and document both cystocele and uterine prolapse. In 1730, Halder associated cystocele with childbirth. During this same time, efforts began to standardize the terminology that is still familiar today. In the 1800s, the surgical advancements of anesthesia, suturing, suturing materials and acceptance of Joseph Lister's theories of antisepsis improved outcomes for women with cystocele. The first surgical techniques were practiced on female cadavers. In 1823, Geradin proposed that an incision and resection may provide treatment. In 1830, the first dissection of the vagina was performed by Dieffenbach on a living woman. In 1834, Mend√© proposed that dissecting and repair of the edges of the tissues could be done. In 1859, Huguier proposed the amputation of the cervix was going to solve the problem for elongation. In 1866, a method of correcting a cystocele was proposed that resembled current procedures. Sim subsequently developed another procedure that did not require the full-thickness dissection of the vaginal wall. In 1888, another method of treating anterior vaginal wall Manchester combined an anterior vaginal wall repair with an amputation of the cervix and a perineorrhaphy. In 1909, White noted the high rate of recurrence of cystocele repair. At this time it was proposed that reattaching the vagina to support structures was more successful and resulted in less recurrence. This same proposal was proposed again in 1976 but further studies indicated that the recurrence rate was not better. In 1888, treatments were tried that entered the abdomen to make reattachments. Some did not agree with this and suggested an approach through the inguinal canal. In 1898, further abdominal approaches were proposed. No further advances have been noted until 1961 when reattachment of the anterior vaginal wall to Cooper's ligament began to be used. Unfortunately, posterior vaginal wall prolapse occurred in some patients even though the anterior repair was successful. In 1955, using mesh to support pelvic structures came into use. In 1970, tissue from pigs began to be used to strengthen the anterior vaginal wall in surgery. Beginning in 1976, improvement in suturing began along with the surgical removal of the vagina being used to treat prolapse of the bladder. In 1991, assumptions about the detailed anatomy of the pelvic support structures began to be questioned regarding the existence of some pelvic structures and the non-existence of others. More recently, the use of stem cells, robot-assisted laparoscopic surgery are being used to treat cystocele.

He is often credited with sparking the Persian nationalist movement which took place under the Pahlavi dynasty. Shahrokh helped reinstate Aryan pride in Iran through excavations of ancient relics near the Iranian city of Kerman. During his tenure in Iran's Revival Party he bolstered Iranian nationalism with numerous speeches and rallies across Shiraz, Kerman, and Tehran.

He is best known for his role in the 1925 transition of the official calendar from the Islamic calendar of Hejri Ghamarei to the Iranian civil calendar, also known as Hejri shamsi. Shahrokh often credited his pride of Persian descent to his hometown of Kerman which avoided miscegenation over thousands of years due to natural barriers such as the Lut desert and nearby mountains. Shahrokh was distantly related to Dinshah Irani, the Indian lawyer and benefactor of the Zoroastrian communities of both India and Iran.

Taney, as a judge of the United States circuit court for the District of Maryland: The United States government explicitly referred to this maxim within its argument in the case Ex parte Milligan, when it remarked (with an additional reference to Cicero) that \\"these [amendments of the Bill of Rights], in truth, are all peace provisions of the Constitution and, like all other conventional and legislative laws and enactments, are silent amidst arms, and when the safety of the people becomes the supreme law.\\" The erosion of citizens' rights during World War II was upheld in the Supreme Court case Hirabayashi v. United States (1943), which held that the application of curfews against members of a minority group was constitutional when the nation was at war with the country from which that group originated. Yasui v. United States was a companion case decided on the same day. In its more modern usage, the phrase has become a watchword about the erosion of civil liberties during wartime. In the immediate wake of the September 11 attacks, the maxim was aired and questioned in the media of the United States with renewed force. The implication of the saying, as currently used, is in debate whether civil liberties and freedoms are subservient to a wartime nation's duty of self-defense. In 1998 Chief Justice William Rehnquist, in All the Laws but One: Civil Liberties in Wartime, suggested that \\"the least justified of the curtailments of civil liberty\\" were unlikely to be accepted by the courts in wars of the future: \\"It is neither desirable nor is it remotely likely that civil liberty will occupy as favored a position in wartime as it does in peacetime. But it is both desirable and likely that more careful attention will be paid by the courts to the basis for the government's claims of necessity as a basis for curtailing civil liberty. ... The laws will thus not be silent in time of war, but they will speak with a somewhat different voice.\\" In 2004, Justice Antonin Scalia used this phrase to decry the plurality decision in Hamdi v. Rumsfeld which, in his view, upheld the detention of a US citizen as an enemy combatant without charge or suspension of habeas corpus.  In fiction  The phrase was used as the title for a 1999 episode of the science fiction TV series Star Trek: Deep Space Nine. In it, the character Admiral Ross uses the phrase to justify a morally dubious act of espionage committed during a war.

Thanks to its beaches, it is a popular destination for swimming and water sports and is one of the primary tourist destinations in Tunisia. It is located in the south-eastern section of Cap Bon and is part of the Nabeul Governorate. The reported number of inhabitants varies from 100,000 to 400,000 and the population quadruples due to tourists' arrival in the summer. It is particularly known for jasmine, which is the namesake of the tourist resort of Yasmine Hammamet. All over Hammamet, souvenirs crafted from jasmine can be found. Around Hammamet, suburbs are being built as migrants from the southern region of the country come to find employment. As a popular tourist destination, the city is economically important to Tunisia. The 2005 World Scout Conference was held in Hammamet.  History  Hammamet Medina In the 1st century, there was a settlement here known as Pupput. It was a town (now in the suburbs of Hammamet) that became a Roman colony in the 2nd century. In the 13th century, walls around town were built and medina of Hammamet was built in the 15th century. Then it came under Spanish and Turkish rule. In 1601 it was the object of a successful Spanish attack. At that time the Spanish name for the place was \\"La Mahometa\\". Alonso de Contreras participated and tells the story in his autobiography. Three hundred men took seven hundred prisoners, mostly women, and children because most of the men in the town had fled. On 14 August 1605 there was another Spanish attack in which Contreras also participated but this time the result was disastrous for the attackers. It was carried out by six galleys, four from Malta, six from Sicily carrying Spanish and other Christian troops. The initial taking of the town was successful as the Spanish managed to climb the walls and open the gates but then there was an unexpected call to retreat - it could not be later determined where or how it originated. In the confusion, the retreat fell into disorder and the Spanish were massacred at the beach by a much smaller number of Moors. There were 1200 men gathered at the beach trying to get back to their ships but the wind had changed and conditions were difficult. The leader of the expedition, Adelantado de Castilla, lost his life as he tried to swim out to the Spanish ships and as the captain in charge of his skiff fled and ignored his calls for help. That captain was later court- martialed and, when it became clear he would be sentenced to death, his own brother poisoned him. This story and more details can be found in Contreras' autobiography. In World War II, it became one of the headquarters of the Nazi general Erwin Rommel. Festival international d'Hammamet was established in 1964. Former Italian prime minister Bettino Craxi moved to Hammamet in 1994 as a fugitive. He died and was buried there in 2000.

For much of his career he has teamed with Mosh, most famously as The Headbangers, a pair of metal-heads known for their outrageous costumes such as nose rings and kilts. Thrasher is best known for his stints in the World Wrestling Federation between 1990 and 2000, where he held the WWF World Tag Team Championship and WWF Hardcore Championship.  Professional wrestling career = Early career (1990‚Äì1996)  Ruth grew up in South Jersey. He trained as a wrestler under Larry Sharpe and debuted in 1990 as The Spider. He later became Sharpe's assistant and helped train wrestlers including Big Show and his future tag team partner Mosh at Sharpe's \\"Monster Factory\\" professional wrestling school. Worked in New Jersey, for the National Wrestling Alliance. In 1991, Ruth wrestled as Frankie Favorite for All Japan Pro Wrestling. In Japan he would occasionally teamed up with Johnny Favorite. In 1991 as the Spider, he won the WWA Heavyweight Championship twice in New Jersey from 1991 to 1992 and 1992 to 1993. Also worked in Maryland. On January 23, 1993 the Spider wrestled The Sandman in a Double DQ for Eastern Championship Wrestling. In 1994, he started teaming up with Chaz Warrington as the Spiders working in the independent circuit in New Jersey and Texas. They made a few appearances for Extreme Championship Wrestling in June 1994. In 1995 they moved down to Tennessee for Smoky Mountain Wrestling (SMW). It was there that they changed their gimmicks to the Headbangers. Their slogan was \\"Real men wear skirts.\\" Ruth became Thrasher and Warrington became Mosh. In December 1995 Smokey Mountain folded and they joined the United States Wrestling Association (USWA).  World Wrestling Federation (1990, 1991-1993, 1995, 1996‚Äì2000)  Ruth debuted in the World Wrestling Federation in August 1990 under his real name losing to Rick Rude. He wrestled several matches for the promotion until leaving in November 1990, making several appearances on WWF Superstars and WWF Wrestling Challenge. Ruth made a number of appearances for the World Wrestling Federation from 1991 to 1993. Losing to the big names; Ric Flair, Undertaker, Shawn Michaels and Bret Hart. He appeared on the second ever episode of Raw in 1993 a losing effort against Marty Jannetty, competing under his given name as an enhancement talent. Sometimes he even made tag teams appearances against The Smoking Gunns and The Steiner Brothers. In December 1995, they debuted as jobbers in the WWF as the Spiders, the Royal Spiders, the Arachnoids, and even used their real names. On an episode of Monday Night Raw they got a World Tag Team Title shot against the Smoking Gunns. They returned to the USWA. Wrestling as \\"The Spiders\\", Thrasher and Mosh returned to the WWF on the September 24, 1996 episode of WWF Superstars, losing to The Smoking Gunns. In November 1996, they resumed wrestling as \\"The Headbangers\\". At the outset of 1997, The Headbangers briefly began wearing nun outfits and wrestling as \\"The Flying Nuns\\" and \\"The Sisters of Love\\", with Thrasher wrestling as \\"Sister Angelica\\" and Mosh as \\"Mother Smucker\\". They were briefly managed by Brother Love. The Headbangers captured the vacant WWF World Tag Team Championships on September 7, 1997 by defeating three other teams in a four team tag match at Ground Zero. They lost the titles to The Godwinns on October 5 of that same year. The Headbangers split in January 1999 when Ruth suffered a knee injury and Warrington began pursuing a singles career, but reformed in late 1999 on the October 10 edition of Sunday Night Heat when Ruth came to Warrington's aid during a domestic violence angle, which saw him vilified by other wrestlers and officials alike for a number of weeks. Ruth had presented video footage of Warrington's (kayfabe) girlfriend Marianna Komlos putting on makeup to make it seem as if Warrington had been abusing her. The police officers arresting Warrington then uncuffed him and arrested Komlos for her lies. Shortly thereafter the two began appearing regularly as a team again, but were now heels and inexplicably came to the ring wearing cone brassieres which they wore while they wrestled. In 2000, Ruth took part in the match for the Hardcore Championship at WrestleMania 2000. He held the title for 37 seconds, pinning Joey Abs and then being pinned by Pete Gas. After the Headbangers split for the second time and Warrington went on to team with D'Lo Brown, Ruth continued to wrestle in singles competition mainly on WWF Jakked before being sent to WWF's Power Pro Wrestling developmental territory in Memphis. He was released from the WWF in December 2000.  Independent circuit (2000‚Äì2003)  After his release from the WWF, Ruth continued to wrestle until 2003 for Maryland Championship Wrestling and independent promotions before retiring from professional wrestling.  Ring Of Honor and return to the independent circuit (2011‚Äìpresent)  In 2011, The Headbangers reformed and have been wrestling on the independent circuit once again. In June 2012, Thrasher and Mosh debuted in Ring of Honor as The Guardians of Truth, a masked tag team managed by Truth Martini. As of 2014, Thrasher now wrestles for independent promotion Championship Wrestling Entertainment in Port St. Lucie, FL. On November 14, 2014, Thrasher defeated Chico Adams to become the CWE Heavyweight Champion.

After his alleged suicide, he became an icon of love and despair. The true causes of his death have not yet been agreed upon. Biography Tenco was born in Cassine (province of Alessandria) in 1938, the son of Teresa Zoccola and Giuseppe Tenco. He never knew his father, who died in unclear circumstances. It has been rumored that Luigi Tenco was the fruit of the extramarital relationship of his mother and the sixteen-year-old son of the wealthy family for whom she worked at the time. Tenco spent his childhood in Cassine and Ricaldone until 1948, when he moved to Liguria, first to Nervi and then to Genoa, where his mother had a wine shop called Enos in the quarter of La Foce. During high school, Tenco founded the Jelly Roll Morton Boys Jazz band, in which Tenco played the clarinet and another singer, later to become famous, Bruno Lauzi, the banjo. Gino Paoli, who would become one of Italy's most famous singers and songwriters as well, also played with Tenco in the band he was later involved in, I Diavoli del Rock (The Rock Devils). Tenco made his debut in the world of Italian professional music with the band I Cavalieri (The Knights), which included Giampiero Reverberi and Enzo Jannacci amongst others. During this period he used the pseudonym Gigi Mai. In 1961 Tenco released his first single under his real name, entitled Quando (\\"When\\"). He started university studying electronic engineering, trying to comply with the wish of his mother and brother. He twice failed the Analytic and Projective Geometry exam (a course he took with professor Eugenio Giuseppe Togliatti, the elder brother of the leader of the communist party Palmiro Togliatti). Later he was enrolled in political science, where he only gave two exams. Tenco was interested in cinema and videomaking. In 1962 he began a short-lived cinematic experience, with Luciano Salce's movie La Cuccagna. He also collaborated to the soundtrack of the film, also introducing his friend Fabrizio De Andr√© (unknown at the time) through the song La ballata dell'eroe (Ballad for a hero). Director Luigi Comencini considered Tenco for the role of Bube in his film La ragazza di Bube, based on Carlo Cassola's novel. He ultimately chose George Chakiris, the West Side Story star, instead. During this period Tenco also formed a strong friendship with the Genoese anarchist poet Riccardo Mannerini. In 1963, however, his friendship with Gino Paoli broke up, due to a troubled relationship with the actress Stefania Sandrelli. Tenco's first LP, Ballate E Canzoni, was released in 1962. One of the songs, \\"Cara Maestra\\" (\\"Dear Teacher\\"), was censored by the then-thriving Italian media censorship. The censors struck again in the following year, against his songs \\"Io S√¨\\" (\\"I Would\\"), considered too sexually explicit, and \\"Una Brava Ragazza\\" (\\"A Good Girl\\"), where Tenco express his admiration for a '60s \\"bad girl\\". In September 1964, he released \\"Ho capito che ti amo\\", a song written by him with musical arrangement by Ezio Leoni. It was released on the Italian record label Jolly as Side A of a 45 rpm, side B being \\"Io lo so gi√†\\".Discografia Nazionale della Canzone Italiana ‚Äì HO CAPITO CHE TI AMO/IO LO SO GI√Ä In Argentina, \\"Ho capito che ti amo\\" was the soundtrack of the popular soap opera El amor tiene cara de mujer. In 1966, suffering through a period of compulsory military service, he released Un Giorno Dopo L'Altro (One Day after Another) for RCA. The military service did not stop him from traveling to Argentina together with Gianfranco Reverberi to meet the fans of El amor tiene cara de mujer. How he actually managed to arrive in Argentina while his passport was still in possession of the Italian Army is unclear. Moreover, under the military service one was not allowed to leave Italy and the punishment was detention, which he did not experience according to his service record book. In Rome during the same year, he met and befriended the Egypt- Italo-French singer Dalida. The two were eventually to become lovers. 1967 Sanremo Festival and his death Luigi Tenco's corpse In 1967 Tenco took part in the Italian Song Festival in Sanremo. It was rumored that he participated against his will. The song he presented was \\"Ciao Amore Ciao\\" (\\"Bye, Bye my Love\\"), which he sang together with Dalida. The video of the performance is lost; however, the audio track, taken from the radio, survives. Tenco allegedly committed suicide on 27 January 1967, at the age of 28, after learning that his song had been eliminated from the final competition. Tenco was officially found by Dalida in his hotel room with a bullet wound in his left temple and a note: \\"I cared for the Italian public and I dedicated in vain five years of my life to them. I'm doing this not because I'm tired of life (I'm not) but as a gesture of dissent against the public who chose Io tu e le rose for the final night and against the commission that selected La rivoluzione. I hope this will clear somebody's head\\". On that morning Tenco and Dalida had privately announced their wedding to music producer Paolo Dossena. Tenco was buried in Ricaldone. In 1974 the Tenco Award was instituted, and has been held every year since in Sanremo. Many of the most renowned Italian singer-songwriters from the 1970s explicitly declared the influence of Tenco on their work. Francesco De Gregori's album Bufalo Bill of 1976 contained a song, \\"Festival\\", about Tenco's suicide; it points out the hypocrisy with which the music establishment tried to minimize the dramatic event, to let the show go on.  The inquiry  In 2004 on TV program Domenica in, the detective who followed the inquiry, commissario Arrigo Molinari, when asked by host Paolo Bonolis, stated that he was sure that Tenco did not commit suicide and he defined his death: \\"a collective murder\\". He also justified his own faults concerning the Tenco inquiry by declaring that he had been prevented from investigating properly. Shortly after the quoted interview, Molinari died, killed by a thief. In 2005, the French television channel TV5 carried a full-length dramatization of the love affair of Tenco and Dalida. Tenco was played by Alessandro Gassman, while Dalida was played by Sabrina Ferilli. Notwithstanding the account of Tenco and Dalida's love story on which the dramatization is based, at the beginning of the '90s Tenco's older brother Valentino met a woman, Valeria, who had in her possession several letters written by Tenco himself that would testify their love relationship started in 1964 and lasted until his death. In one of these letters, Tenco writes that his relationship with Dalida was nothing but a clumsy attempt to forget Valeria, who, months before, had left him. He describes Dalida as a woman: \\"spoiled, neurotic, ignorant, who rejects the idea of being defeated in her profession as in private life\\". Valentino Tenco identified those letters as written by his brother. The Italian judicial system later began re-examining Luigi Tenco's suicide. It was pointed out that the bullet hole was on the left temple, while the singer was right-handed. It had also been revealed that no autopsy had been done on the singer's corpse, no paraffine test, and no calligraphic analysis on the suicide note with which he explained his final gesture. On 15 February 2006, Italian police exhumed Tenco's body for further investigation.\\"Tenco: confermata l'ipotesi del suicidio.\\" 16 February 2006. Retrieved on 1 March 2009. Il Corriere della Sera (Google's automated translation) The next day, results from the new autopsy and ballistics analysis were reported. According to Italian experts, what had been thought to be the entry hole on the left temple was actually the exit site. The bullet trajectory was said to be compatible with suicide. Nevertheless, criminologists Pasquale Ragone and Nicola Guarneri, in their book Le ombre del silenzio (The shadows of silence, 2013) pointed out the several incongruences between the shell case of the bullet found in Tenco's room and the bullet Tenco's Walter PPK gun would eject. Professor of ballistic forensics Martino Farneti proved that they did not match. As there was no proof nor official statement declaring that Tenco's Walter PPK was actually present in his room the night he died (the police registers show that the gun was actually found in his car), Guarneri and Ragone assume that Tenco might have been killed. The actual weapon might have been a Beretta 70, as it is possible to put a silencer on this type of gun (similar to a Walter PPK). In fact, the night Tenco died (allegedly in his hotel room), no one heard the sound of the gunshot, not even singer Lucio Dalla, whose room was next to Tenco's, nor did journalist Sandro Ciotti, whose room was in front of Tenco's. Music producer and friend Paolo Dossena stated that he drove Tenco's car from Rome (where the songwriter lived) to Sanremo and on the way, passing through a roadblock on the Aurelia, he discovered that Tenco had his Walter PPK in the dashboard of his car. He later confronted the songwriter who confessed that he took a gun because someone in the past few weeks had tried to drop him down a steep road near Santa Margherita Ligure while he was driving. The first witnesses who entered the room did not even see the suicide note. It was journalist Piero Vivarelli who delivered the note to the police after having spent a few minutes in Dalida's room. Guarneri and Ragone assume that the alleged suicide note might in fact have been the last page of a document written by Tenco for a different aim. French journalist and novelist Philippe Brunel wrote a fiction book, La nuit de San Remo, in which he dramatizes the arduous search for truth about Tenco's death. Tributes Shortly after Tenco's death, his friend and songwriter Fabrizio De Andr√© wrote for him the song Preghiera in gennaio (A prayer in January), where he describes a benevolent God welcoming those who committed suicide into Heaven, in spite of the moral condemnation of the bigots. In 1999, the play Solitudini ‚Äì Luigi Tenco e Dalida, written and directed by Maurizio Valtieri, was performed in Rome.

The general idea behind the NGN is that one network transports all information and services (voice, data, and all sorts of media such as video) by encapsulating these into IP packets, similar to those used on the Internet. NGNs are commonly built around the Internet Protocol, and therefore the term all IP is also sometimes used to describe the transformation of formerly telephone-centric networks toward NGN. NGN is a different concept from Future Internet, which is more focused on the evolution of Internet in terms of the variety and interactions of services offered.  Introduction of NGN  NGN Seminar in Fusion Technology Center by NICT(Japan) researcher According to ITU-T, the definition is: :A next-generation network (NGN) is a packet-based network which can provide services including Telecommunication Services and is able to make use of multiple broadband, quality of Service-enabled transport technologies and in which service-related functions are independent from underlying transport-related technologies. It offers unrestricted access by users to different service providers. It supports generalized mobility which will allow consistent and ubiquitous provision of services to users. From a practical perspective, NGN involves three main architectural changes that need to be looked at separately: * In the core network, NGN implies a consolidation of several (dedicated or overlay) transport networks each historically built for a different service into one core transport network (often based on IP and Ethernet). It implies amongst others the migration of voice from a circuit-switched architecture (PSTN) to VoIP, and also migration of legacy services such as X.25, frame relay (either commercial migration of the customer to a new service like IP VPN, or technical emigration by emulation of the \\"legacy service\\" on the NGN). * In the wired access network, NGN implies the migration from the dual system of legacy voice next to xDSL setup in local exchanges to a converged setup in which the DSLAMs integrate voice ports or VoIP, making it possible to remove the voice switching infrastructure from the exchange.Next-generation networks: the MSAN strategy Retrieved on 2009-08-28. * In the cable access network, NGN convergence implies migration of constant bit rate voice to CableLabs PacketCable standards that provide VoIP and SIP services. Both services ride over DOCSIS as the cable data layer standard. In an NGN, there is a more defined separation between the transport (connectivity) portion of the network and the services that run on top of that transport. This means that whenever a provider wants to enable a new service, they can do so by defining it directly at the service layer without considering the transport layer ‚Äì i.e. services are independent of transport details. Increasingly applications, including voice, tend to be independent of the access network (de-layering of network and applications) and will reside more on end-user devices (phone, PC, set-top box).  Underlying technology components  Next-generation networks are based on Internet technologies including Internet Protocol (IP) and multiprotocol label switching (MPLS). At the application level, Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) seems to be taking over from ITU-T H.323. Initially H.323 was the most popular protocol, though its popularity decreased in the \\"local loop\\" due to its original poor traversal of network address translation (NAT) and firewalls. For this reason as domestic VoIP services have been developed, SIP has been more widely adopted. However, in voice networks where everything is under the control of the network operator or telco, many of the largest carriers use H.323 as the protocol of choice in their core backbones. With the most recent changes introduced for H.323, it is now possible for H.323 devices to easily and consistently traverse NAT and firewall devices, opening up the possibility that H.323 may again be looked upon more favorably in cases where such devices encumbered its use previously. Nonetheless, most of the telcos are extensively researching and supporting IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS), which gives SIP a major chance of being the most widely adopted protocol. For voice applications one of the most important devices in NGN is a Softswitch ‚Äì a programmable device that controls Voice over IP (VoIP) calls. It enables correct integration of different protocols within NGN. The most important function of the Softswitch is creating the interface to the existing telephone network, PSTN, through Signalling Gateways and Media Gateways. However, the Softswitch as a term may be defined differently by the different equipment manufacturers and have somewhat different functions. One may quite often find the term Gatekeeper in NGN literature. This was originally a VoIP device, which converted (using gateways) voice and data from their analog or digital switched-circuit form (PSTN, SS7) to the packet-based one (IP). It controlled one or more gateways. As soon as this kind of device started using the Media Gateway Control Protocol, the name was changed to Media Gateway Controller (MGC). A Call Agent is a general name for devices/systems controlling calls. The IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS) is a standardised NGN architecture for an Internet media-services capability defined by the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) and the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP).  Implementations  In the UK another popular acronym was introduced by BT (British Telecom) as 21CN (21st Century Networks, sometimes mistakenly quoted as C21N) ‚Äî this is another loose term for NGN and denotes BT's initiative to deploy and operate NGN switches and networks in the period 2006‚Äì2008 (the aim being by 2008 BT to have only all-IP switches in their network). The concept was abandoned, however, in favor of maintaining current-generation equipment. The first company in the UK to roll out a NGN was THUS plc which started deployment back in 1999. THUS' NGN contains 10,600 km of fibre optic cable with more than 190 points of presence throughout the UK. The core optical network uses dense wavelength- division multiplexing (DWDM) technology to provide scalability to many hundreds of gigabits per second of bandwidth, in line with growth demand. On top of this, the THUS backbone network uses MPLS technology to deliver the highest possible performance. IP/MPLS-based services carry voice, video and data traffic across a converged infrastructure, potentially allowing organisations to enjoy lower infrastructure costs, as well as added flexibility and functionality. Traffic can be prioritised with Classes of Service, coupled with Service Level Agreements (SLAs) that underpin quality of service performance guarantees. The THUS NGN accommodates seven Classes of Service, four of which are currently offered on MPLS IP VPN. In the Netherlands, KPN is developing an NGN in a network transformation program called all-IP. Next Generation Networks also extends into the messaging domain and in Ireland, Openmind Networks has designed, built and deployed Traffic Control to handle the demands and requirements of all IP networks. In Bulgaria, BTC (Bulgarian Telecommunications Company) has implemented the NGN as underlying network of its telco services on a large-scale project in 2004. The inherent flexibility and scalability of the new core network approach resulted in an unprecedented rise of classical services deployment as POTS/ISDN, Centrex, ADSL, VPN, as well as implementation of higher bandwidths for the Metro and Long-distance Ethernet / VPN services, cross-national transits and WebTV/IPTV application. In February 2014 Deutsche Telekom revealed that its subsidiary Makedonski Telekom had become the first European incumbent to convert its PSTN infrastructure to an all IP network. It took just over two years for all 290,000 fixed lines to be migrated onto the new platform. The capital investment worth 14 million euros makes Macedonia the first country in the South-East Europe whose network will be fully based on Internet protocol. In Canada, startup Wind Mobile owned by Globalive is deploying an all-ip wireless backbone for its mobile phone service. In mid 2005, China Telecom announced its commercial roll-out of China Telecom's Next Generation Carrying Network, or CN2, using Internet Protocol Next-Generation Network (IP NGN) architecture. It's IPv6-capable backbone network leverages softswitches (the control layer) and protocols like DiffServ and MPLS, which boosts performance of its bearer layer. The MPLS-optimized architecture also enables Frame Relay and ATM traffic to be transported over a Layer 2 VPN, which supports both legacy traffic and new IP services over a single IP/MPLS network.

Like transportation in the rest of the United States, the primary mode of local transportation in Portland, Oregon is the automobile. Metro, the metropolitan area's regional government, has a regional master plan in which transit-oriented development plays a major role.http://library.oregonmetro.gov/files//tod_final_report.pdf This approach, part of the new urbanism, promotes mixed-use and high-density development around light rail stops and transit centers, and the investment of the metropolitan area's share of federal tax dollars into multiple modes of transportation. In the United States, this focus is atypical in an era when automobile use led many areas to neglect their core cities in favor of development along interstate highways, in suburbs, and satellite cities. Commuting statistics for major U.S. cities in 2008. Mass transit Portland has a public transportation system. The bus and rail system is operated by TriMet, its name reflecting the three metropolitan area counties it serves (Multnomah, Clackamas, and Washington). Portland's rate of public transit use (12.6% of commutes in 2008) is comparable to much larger cities like Los Angeles, and higher than in most similarly sized U.S. cities, but is lower than in some others, such as Baltimore and Seattle. Transit service between Portland and Vancouver, Washington, the second-largest city in the metropolitan area, is provided by C-Tran, with a small number of express routes. Buses and bikes in downtown Portland. Within the downtown area (the city center) is the Portland Transit Mall, a transit-priority corridor on which buses and light rail trains from many different parts of the region converge. First opened in 1977, and for three decades served only by buses, the transit mall underwent major changes in 2009. Tracks for light rail (MAX) were added, bus stops spaced farther apart, and the left lane opened to general traffic (but with right turns prohibited). To facilitate this major renovation and rebuilding, lasting more than two years, all bus routes using the mall were diverted to other streets (mainly 3rd and 4th avenues) starting in January 2007. The transit mall reopened to buses on May 24, 2009, and operator training runs on the new light-rail tracks took place during the late spring and summer. Light rail service on the transit mall was introduced on August 30, 2009, when the MAX Yellow Line moved to the mall from its previous routing. The new MAX Green Line opened 13 days later, on September 12, and it also serves the downtown transit mall. From 1975 to 2010, all of downtown Portland was in Fareless Square, a fare zone within which all rides on buses, light rail and streetcars were fare-free, and starting in 2001 this zone also covered a portion of the adjacent Lloyd District. In 2010, free rides became limited to light-rail and streetcar service ‚Äì no longer covering bus service ‚Äì and the zone was renamed the \\"Free Rail Zone\\". In September 2012, the fareless zone was discontinued entirely, due to a $12 million shortfall in TriMet's annual budget. Ben Holladay was the first person to offer public transportation to the city of Portland when in 1872 he opened the Portland Street Railway Company, a horsecar line on First Street extending to a garage at the end of Glisan. In 1882, a second horsecar system was built for Third Street.Labbe, p. 19 Ferries such as the O&CRR; Ferry#2 were used to cross the Willamette River before the construction of the first Steel Bridge in 1888. At that point, rail expanded into Albina and East Portland. Horsecars took passengers across the river and steam trains took them further into the suburbs,Labbe, pp. 20‚Äì21 but both modes were soon replaced by electric streetcar lines, the first of which began operation on November 1, 1889, between St. Johns and Portland.\\"Cars Running By Electricity; Formal Opening of the Portland‚ÄìSt. John's Line Yesterday\\". (November 2, 1889). The Morning Oregonian, p. 7. Buses TriMet operates a fleet of 688 buses on a network of 79 bus routes. Twelve of the routes are designated \\"Frequent Service\\" bus routes, with more frequent schedules than other routes. Originally intended to have buses scheduled every 15 minutes or less all day, every day (including weekends and holidays), budget cutbacks in 2009 caused TriMet to change \\"Frequent Service\\" routes to have 15-minute-or-less wait times only during weekday peak usage times in the morning and afternoon. In August 2014, TriMet reintroduced 15-minutes-or-less wait times at all times during weekdays on Frequent Service routes, with the stated goal of reinstating weekend 15-minutes-or-less wait times on these routes. TriMet's bus fleet is made up of and buses, built in 2000 or later, and all are low-floor buses, the last of the high-floor models having been retired in 2016. The last non-air- conditioned buses were retired in December 2015. TriMet's bus routes also include express buses from downtown Portland to South Beaverton, Sherwood and Oregon City, and express buses from Marquam Hill to Beaverton, Tigard, Southwest Portland, and Milwaukie. TriMet also has several \\"cross-town\\" routes that do not serve downtown Portland. The bus network operates predominately in a hub-and-spoke network starting with the downtown Portland transit mall, and includes outlying transit centers in Portland's suburbs. In addition to the fixed-route service, TriMet operates a paratransit service known as LIFT which operates 253 minibuses and 15 sedans offering door-to-door service for citizens who cannot access regular TriMet services. MAX light rail Since September 2015, Portland's light rail system, named MAX (short for Metropolitan Area Express), consists of five color-coded lines: * The Blue Line is a east-west route. It begins in Hillsboro, a western suburb, passes through Beaverton and downtown Portland, then across the Willamette River, through Northeast Portland and east to the city of Gresham. The line between downtown and Gresham was the first light rail line opened in Portland, in 1986. MAX lines first became designated by colors in 2000. * The Red Line incorporates a north-south addition between the airport and the Gateway Transit Center near the northeast Portland neighborhood of Parkrose. From that point the line overlaps the Blue Line, running west to downtown and beyond, terminating at the Beaverton Transit Center, where it and the Blue Line meet WES Commuter Rail. * The Yellow Line added to the system. It connects North Portland's Expo Center with downtown. This line is often referred to as \\"Interstate MAX\\" because much of it runs along Interstate Avenue, and parallel to I-5. Until 2009, the Yellow Line followed the same mostly east-west alignment through downtown Portland as used by the Blue and Red lines, traveling along Morrison Street (westbound) and Yamhill Street (eastbound) through the core of the business district. However, on August 30, 2009, the Yellow Line shifted to a new north-south alignment through downtown that had been constructed along the Portland Mall (see Green Line). In 2015, the Yellow Line became through-routed at all times with the then-new Orange Line (see below). * The Green Line runs from Clackamas Town Center, in the Clackamas area, north along I-205 for 6.5 miles (10.5 km) to the Gateway Transit Center, where the Blue and Red Lines meet. From Gateway, it joins them and travels westwards to downtown Portland along the 1986-opened tracks extending to the Steel Bridge. From there‚Äîa new junction on the bridge's west deck‚Äîthe Green Line uses 1.8 miles (2.9 km) of new tracks passing Union Station and running mainly along the transit mall for the remainder of its route through downtown, sharing that routing with the Yellow Line (and since 2015 the Orange Line) and terminating at Portland State University (PSU). *The Orange Line added of newly constructed line, extending from the south end of the Portland Mall to Milwaukie. The project included construction of the Tilikum Crossing, the first new bridge opened across the Willamette River in Portland in 42 years (since 1973), which is also notable for being open only to transit vehicles, pedestrians and cyclists‚Äîand not private vehicles. From the PSU area in downtown, the Orange Line follows streets and a bus-and-light-rail-only viaduct to reach the South Waterfront district. After crossing the river, the line turns southward, passing through Southeast Portland along a new median on SE 17th Avenue and then mostly along or adjacent to previously existing railroad rights-of-way to downtown Milwaukie. The terminal station is at Park Avenue, just south of downtown Milwaukie. Operationally, it is linked to the Yellow Line at all times; southbound Yellow Line trains become Orange Line trains when they depart from Rose Quarter TC, and northbound Orange Line trains become Yellow Line trains when they reach the transit mall in downtown Portland. Portland Streetcar Portland Streetcar The Portland Streetcar is a two-line streetcar system serving the central part of Portland‚Äîdowntown and the areas immediately surrounding downtown. The system's first line opened in 2001 and, with later extensions, now follows a routeMorgan, Steve. \\"Expansion for Portland's MAX: New routes and equipment\\", pp. 38-40.

White River Productions. from Legacy Good Samaritan Medical Center at NW 23rd Avenue through inner- Northwest and Southwest, including the Pearl District and Portland State University, to the new South Waterfront neighborhood, where it connects to the Portland Aerial Tram.Portland Streetcar: Streetcar History from portlandstreetcar.org In 2012, this route was given the designation North- South Line, or NS Line. The system's second line opened in 2012 and extended service across the Willamette River to the Lloyd District and the Central Eastside. The federal share of funding for this $148-million project, a extension and fleet expansion, was approved in April 2009, and construction began in August 2009. Originally named the Central Loop Line, or CL Line, it was renamed the A Loop (clockwise) and B Loop (counterclockwise) in 2015, when it was extended from the eastside across the Tilikum Crossing bridge and also along the NS Line from South Waterfront to Portland State University. See Portland Streetcar (Eastside line) and Loop Service (Portland Streetcar) for more detail. The Willamette Shore Trolley is a seasonal, volunteer-operated heritage streetcar service established in 1990 ‚Äì after a 1987 trial run ‚Äì for the purpose of preserving an approximately former Southern Pacific railroad right-of-way running south from Portland to Lake Oswego for possible future transit use. Plans to extend the Portland Streetcar along the right-of-way were mothballed in early 2012, but remain under consideration for the long term. The right-of-way was acquired by a consortium of local governmental entities in 1988 for this purpose. Commuter rail TriMet's WES Commuter Rail connects the cities of Wilsonville, Tualatin, Tigard and Beaverton. It is one of only two suburb-to-suburb commuter rail lines in the country, along with Tri-Rail in Miami. Rather than electric railcars like those of MAX, the line uses FRA-compliant diesel multiple units running on existing Portland and Western Railroad freight tracks. The first rides open to the general public took place on Friday, January 30, 2009, and regular service began on Monday, February 2, 2009. Amtrak also exists as a rail commuting option in the Portland area with the Amtrak Cascades providing daily service between Portland and neighboring Oregon City.http://amtrakcascades.com/Schedules.htm While the frequency is less than that of TriMet, the 20-minute ride from Oregon City is faster, has cheaper tickets, and is arguably a more comfortable service.http://www.oregonlive.com/pacific-northwest- news/index.ssf/2012/03/amtrak_gaining_popularity_amon.html See the Intercity service section below for information about the many intercity bus and train services to and from Portland from outside the metro area. Portland Aerial Tram Portland Aerial Tram car descends towards the rising South Waterfront district. The Portland Aerial Tram is an aerial cableway used to connect the South Waterfront district with Oregon Health and Science University on Marquam Hill above. The cableway is two-thirds of one mile (1 km) long and was opened to the public in January 2007. =Portland, OR Public Transportation Statistics= The average amount of time people spend commuting with public transit in Portland, OR, for example to and from work, on a weekday is 90 min. 36% of public transit riders, ride for more than 2 hours every day. The average amount of time people wait at a stop or station for public transit is 14 min, while 21% of riders wait for over 20 minutes on average every day. The average distance people usually ride in a single trip with public transit is 8.2 km, while 18% travel for over 12 km in a single direction. 50x50px Material was copied from this source, which is available under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License. Cycling Bicycle use in Portland has been growing rapidly, having nearly tripled since 2001; for example, daily bicycle traffic on four of the Willamette River bridges has increased from 2,855 before 1992 to over 16,000 in , partly due to improved facilities.Portland Bicycle Counts 2008 (PDF), City of Portland Approximately 8% of commuters bike to work in Portland, the highest proportion of any major U.S. city and about 10 times the national average. In July 2016, Portland introduce a bike share program known as Biketown, initially running with 1,000 bikes. The bikes were provided by Social Bicycles, and the program is operated by Motivate. Walking According to a city video, in 1994 Portland became the first city to develop a pedestrian master plan.Portland Walks - Be Safe from the City of Portland website Blocks in the downtown area are only long. Many streets in the outer southwest section of the city lack sidewalks; however, this is partially made up with various off-street trails.SW Urban Trails, a website of the neighborhood coalition for southwest Portland A 2011 study by Walk Score ranked Portland the 12th most walkable of the fifty largest cities in the United States. The Gibbs Street Pedestrian Bridge, a new pedestrian and bicycle bridge over I-5 near the Portland Aerial Tram, opened in 2012. Electric ride-share scooters Ride-share scooters from two different providers parked on a sidewalk in Northwest Portland Electric scooter sharing systems have become popular in the past few years as an alternative form of transportation. They first came to Portland in July 2018, after being approved for a four-month pilot program. Scooters returned to Portland in April 2019 for a one-year program after positive review by the city of the first program. The system works much like most bike share systems which have also become popular in Portland and around the world. Users unlock and pay for a scooter with an app on their smartphone and then can drop it off anywhere when done with it. There were many complaints about the effectiveness and safety of the program when the program first returned to Portland. A report done by the city shows that over 700,000 rides were taken during the pilot program and that scooters are equally dangerous to other transportation systems but that many riders did not follow the safety regulations such as wearing a helmet. However despite this there are still a lot of concerns. In response to some of the backlash around safety Portland instituted specific laws that apply to scooters, which include that all riders must wear a helmet, must be 16 or older, must not ride on the sidewalk or in city parks, and must yield to pedestrians. In addition to some of the safety concerns there were also concerns about access both for low-income residents and residents with mobility issues. The city has responded to both of these and each scooter company now has discounted rates for low-income residents. These rates differ significantly by company with some being a small discount and others being up to 50 free rides of 30 minutes or less a month. All companies also offer options for non-smartphone users although most of these still require being able to receive SMS texts. The city has passed codes that outlaw leaving the scooters in the middle of sidewalks in response to complaints about the scooters, but it is unclear how often that is being enforced. Despite all of these measures taken by the City of Portland as well as the individual companies there is still much concern and controversy around the scooters. Many are still concerned about inclusivity and disability access as well safety as all complaints about riders leaving or riding the scooters on the sidewalk and not wearing helmets will be dealt with by the private companies, not the city itself. There are also concerns about access to the scooters in all parts of Portland particularly the low-income neighborhoods as most of the scooters have been centered in downtown and other wealthier and popular tourist parts of the city. As the program is still new there is a lack of data about whether or not this program is decreasing the reliance on cars and providing alternative forms of transportation in the city as its original goal. According to a report done by the city, 34% of local riders used the scooters instead of driving and 48% of visitors used the scooters rather than driving or using a rideshare system. It is unclear whether these numbers have increased or decreased with the new year-long program and as with other new technologies there are still many concerns surrounding the scooters. In June 2019, more than 50 scooters from various companies were pulled out of the Willamette River in Portland by a dive team from the Multnomah County Sheriff‚Äôs office. It is unclear who put them there or why, and it is unclear how long they were there before being spotted by the divers. Traffic flow Many streets in Portland are one-way; streets in downtown Portland (Southwest Portland bounded by I-405 and the Willamette River) are virtually all one-way, forming a grid of alternating street traffic: for north-south streets, odd- numbered avenues (1st, 3rd, etc.) are southbound, while even-numbered avenues (2nd, 4th, etc.) are northbound, and similarly east-west streets alternate. This is partly due to the streets in downtown Portland being relatively narrow (). This grid extends a short way west across I-405 into Goose Hollow, terminating at SW 18th Avenue, and extends to some degree north across Burnside Street into the Pearl District, particularly with the north-south streets extending into Old Town. Most streets on the east side are two-way, but there are a number of one-way pairs along major routes: Martin Luther King Jr. Blvd. (MLK)/Grand Avenue (the equivalent of 4th and 5th avenues), and 11th/12th east-west pairs are connected with bridges, with NE Couch/Burnside forming a pair east of the Burnside Bridge from 3rd to 14th avenues, SE Morrison/SE Belmont forming a pair from the Morrison Bridge to SE 25th Ave, and SE Madison/SE Hawthorne forming a pair from the Hawthorne Bridge to SE 12th Avenue.

Majo (masc.) or maja (fem.), also manolo and manola, after the most popular names, were people from the lower classes of Spanish society, especially in Madrid, who distinguished themselves by their elaborate outfits and sense of style in dress and manners, as well as by their cheeky behavior.Madripedia - Tipos castizos They flourished from the late 18th to early 19th century, and to some extent later. Majos and majas were one of the favorite subjects of some 19th-century Spanish painters. The majos and majas outfits were exaggerations of traditional Spanish dress. The style stood in strong contrast to the French styles affected by many of the Spanish elite under the influence of the Enlightenment. Majos were known to pick fights with those they saw as afrancesados (\\"Frenchified\\" ‚Äì fops).Charles J. Esdaile, Spain in the Liberal Age, Blackwell, 2000. . p. 10.

The flight was disbanded on 21 July 1944 at RAF Bognor, absorbed by 83 Group Support Wing. 1310 Flight was re-formed at RAF Lyneham with Avro York transport aircraft to provide transport services for the early nuclear weapon tests in Western Australia, disbanding at RAAF Base Mallala on 7 December 1953. The next incarnation of 1310 Flight was at RAF Odiham, where the Flight prepared to transfer to British Guiana, in South America, to assist the nascent government of the newly independent state. Its first role with helicopters flying Westland Whirlwind HAR 10s, with three helicopters, three pilots and approximately thirty ground crew, then deployed to Atkinson Field. This mission was carried out alongside five Alouette II helicopters of 24 Flt. Army Air Corps, in joint support of the British Army for two years before its helicopters were flown back to RAF Fairford with the Flight disbanding on 14 October 1966. Following the Falklands War, the Flight was reformed at Kelly's Garden near to Port San Carlos, as 'ChinDet Falkland Islands', flying Boeing Chinook helicopters from Nos. 7 and 18 Squadrons, renamed as No. 1310 (Tactical Support) Flight RAF. Later 1310 Flt was amalgamated with 1564 Flt to form 78 Sqn at RAF Mount Pleasant. 1310 Flt was re-formed again at Split in Croatia in December 1995 for saw service in Bosnia, flying support for British units in the Implementation Force (IFOR) and Stabilisation Force (SFOR) until relieved by Chinooks of 298 Squadron RNLAF in December 2000. More recently it was again formed in southern Iraq to provide helicopter support to the British-commanded division based in the area and operated from a Main Operating Base at Basra Airport, and from a Forward Operating Base in Al Amarah. It was stood down in April 2005 and replaced by 1419 Flt. From 2005-2006, 1310 Flight operated Chinooks in Afghanistan's Helmand and Kandahar Provinces, supporting the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF). The Chinook's role in Afghanistan includes air assault, forward operating base resupply, and casualty evacuation.

It was dedicated to his wife Ekaterina Protopova. Some scholars, such as Borodin's biographer Serge Dianin, suggest that the quartet was a 20th anniversary gift and that it has a program evoking the couple's first meeting in Heidelberg. Of its four movements, the third movement \\"Notturno\\" is the most famous. History Borodin wrote the string quartet quickly in 1881 while staying at the estate of his friend, the minor composer Nikolai Lodyzhensky, which was located in Zhitovo, southeast of Moscow.St. Petersburg String Quartet Borodin also composed the symphonic poem In the Steppes of Central Asia the same year. The quartet premiered in that year or the next. (The external links give a more complete tale but conflict on the date.) Music The string quartet has four movements: #Allegro moderato in D major and 2/2 time, with 304 bars; #Scherzo. Allegro in F major and 3/4 time, with 299 bars; #Notturno (Nocturne): Andante in A major and 3/4 time, with 180 bars; #Finale: Andante -- Vivace in D major and 2/4 time, with 671 bars. First movement The first movement is written in sonata form. The principal theme of the exposition begins in measure one, with a cello singing a lyrical melody in high register. The transition begins in measure 35, and quickly leads into the subordinate theme (measure 44) in A major, the dominant. The subordinate theme has a complex structure, a three-part form of its own (a-b-a'), which leads into the closing theme in measure 86 (Animato), which concludes the exposition in measure 107. The development (beginning in measure 108) begins with the same material as the exposition, except the cello is in the low register, and the key is changed from D major to F major. After some contrapuntal work, the development reaches a dominant pedal point (measure 167), which resolves in the main key of the piece, D major, in the recapitulation in measure 180. The recapitulation follows the broad outlines of the exposition, except the subordinate theme (measure 224) begins in E-flat major instead of the customary D major. The three-part structure of the subordinate theme, though, allows Borodin to reach the expected D major in the a' part of the subordinate theme (measure 257), and the closing theme (measure 266) concludes the movement. The first movement exemplifies Borodin's lyrical (as opposed to dramatic) treatment of the sonata form. All thematic material is lyrical; contrasts are achieved via contrapuntal writing (as in the middle section of the subordinate theme, beginning in measure 57, and especially in beginning in measure 65), or color contrasts (such as changes of keys‚Äìbeginning of the development, and particularly the non-traditional key of the subordinate theme in the recapitulation). ew Staff { \\\\relative c { \\\\key d \\\\major \\\\clef treble \\\\set Staff.midiInstrument = \\"violin\\" 2.->\\\\f q4->  q2.-> a4->  2.-> 4->  2\\\\. }} ew Staff { \\\\relative c { \\\\key d \\\\major \\\\clef alto \\\\set Staff.midiInstrument = \\"violin\\" a4->(\\\\f gis8 g fis4) f->  e->( dis8 d cis4) c->  b->( d e) gis->  a2.-> }} ew Staff { \\\\relative c { \\\\key d \\\\major \\\\clef bass \\\\set Staff.midiInstrument = \\"cello\\" e,1\\\\f ~  e  e  4-> s2 }} >> }} Second movement The scherzo second movement is also in sonata form, rather than the ABA form that is more usual for scherzo-style movements. Of note is also the appearance of a scherzo as the second movement in a sonata cycle, rather than the more customary third movement. This is characteristic for Borodin, who used the same movement scheme (scherzo as a second movement) in his Second Symphony. The principal theme of this movement (descending scale-based figure of the first violin, accompanied by a falling motive in a viola) reminds one of Mendelssohn's scherzi. \\\\version \\"2.14.2\\" \\\\relative c { \\\\key f \\\\major \\\\time 3/4 \\\\set Timing.beamExceptions = #'() \\\\set Score.tempoHideNote = ##t \\\\tempo 4 = 240 f8->( e d c d c) f->( e d c d c) a'->( g f e f e) a->( g f e f e) d'->( c) c( a f a) bes->( a) a( f d f) a->( g) g( e c e) f->( d) c( d c d) } The \\"rising thirds\\" motif of the subordinate theme (measure 29) is an inversion of the viola's accompanying falling motif. \\\\version \\"2.14.2\\" \\\\relative c' { \\\\key f \\\\major \\\\time 3/4 \\\\set Timing.beamExceptions = #'() \\\\set Score.tempoHideNote = ##t \\\\tempo 4 = 160 4( **2) 4( **2) 4( 4.) 8( 4 8 ) } The descending scale-based figure of the subordinate theme, repeated by viola starting with measure 51, recalls the principal theme. The movement's development begins at measure 100 and emphasizes counterpoint in combining the motives of the principal and subordinate themes (measure 144). The recapitulation (measure 192) brings the subordinate theme in the main key of F (measure 221), and, after a momentary burst of activity, the movement whispers away. The tuneful subordinate theme of this movement was freely used in the musical Kismet as the song ‚ÄúBaubles, Bangles and Beads.‚Äù This musical received the 1954 Tony Award. Third movement The main theme of the third movement is perhaps the most famous in the quartet. An agitated middle section, beginning in F major, followed by a series of modulations and lasting from bars 47‚Äì110 of the movement, interrupts this theme's otherwise peaceful mood. The main theme is restated after the middle section in canon (first cello and the first violin, then two violins). Finale The finale demonstrates Borodin's mastery of counterpoint. Written in a conventional sonata form, it opens with an introduction, which introduces the principal theme, broken into two elements: a dialogue between two violins, answered by a viola and cello. These \\"question-answer\\" motifs (one possibly being an imprecise retrograde inversion of another) combine into the principal theme of the movement (beginning with measure 20), where the \\"answer\\" makes an accompaniment, and the \\"question\\" makes for the upper voice. The principal theme is stated as a canon, with viola, second violin, and first violin stating the theme, which modulates into a dominant, and lead into the subordinate theme in measure 90. The subordinate theme retains the frantic pace of the principal theme, to be contrasted with a more relaxed closing theme, based on the motifs of the subordinate theme, at measure 177. The development starts similar to the exposition with the question-answer dialogue, except the question now is in lower strings, and the answer in violins. After much contrapuntal work (including a charming \\"horse-riding\\" episode worthy of Rossini, beginning in measure 296), the recapitulation begins with the now familiar question-answer motifs, this time enunciated by the combined strings (measure 371). The recapitulation proceeds as expected (with the subordinate theme in the tonic key, measure 459), only to be suddenly shifted into another key by the beginning of the coda (measure 588). But this modulation proves to be short-lived, and the coda quickly reaches the long-breathed D major close. Recordings The Borodin Quartet in both its incarnations have specialized in this work, producing recordings of it. The Emerson Quartet also produced a well-known recording in 1986. The Escher String Quartet released a recording in 2018.  In popular culture  Many parts of the piece were adapted into the 1953 Broadway musical Kismet The third movement serves as the score to Disney's 2006 short The Little Matchgirl.

It is the only species of the genus Dosidicus of the subfamily Ommastrephinae, family Ommastrephidae. Humboldt squid typically reach a mantle length of , making it the largest member of its family. They have a reputation for aggression towards humans, though this behavior may possibly only be manifested during feeding times. Like other members of the subfamily Ommastrephinae, they possess bioluminescent photophores and are capable of quickly changing body coloration (metachrosis). They notably rapidly flash red and white while hunting, earning them the name diablo rojo (Spanish for \\"red devil\\") among fishermen. These chromatophores (which belong to more than one set and are of different sizes) may rapidly cycle through colors other than red and white, flashing too quickly for the human eye to see the transitions. They have a relatively short lifespan of just 1-2 years. They are most commonly found at depths of , from Tierra del Fuego to California. This species is spreading north into the waters of the Pacific Northwest, in Oregon, Washington, British Columbia, and Alaska. They are fished commercially, predominantly in Mexico and Peru. Description The humboldt squid is the largest member of the Ommastrephid squids, as some individuals may grow to in mantle lengthNorman, M.D. 2000. Cephalopods: A World Guide. ConchBooks. and weigh up to . Generally, the mantle (or body) constitutes about 40% of the animal's mass, the fins (or wings) about 12%, the arms and tentacles about 14%, the outer skin about 3%, the head (including eyes and beak) about 5%, with the balance (26%) made up of the inner organs. Behavior Humboldt squid photographed at a depth of off California Humboldt squid are carnivorous marine invertebrates that move in shoals of up to 1,200 individuals. They swim at speeds up to propelled by water ejected through a hyponome (siphon) and by two triangular fins. Their tentacles bear 100‚Äì200 suckers, each lined with razor-sharp teeth, with which they grasp prey and drag it towards a large, sharp beak. Although Humboldt squid have a reputation of being aggressive towards humans, some disagreement exists on this subject. Research suggests these squid are only aggressive while feeding; at other times, they are quite passive. Their behavior while feeding often extends to cannibalism and they have been seen to readily attack injured or vulnerable squid of their own shoal. A quarter of squid stomachs analyzed contained remains of other squid.Life. Extraordinary Animals, Extreme Behaviour by BBC Books, Martha Holmes & Michael Gunton, 2009, , pg 22. This behavior may account for a large proportion of their rapid growth.The Curious Case of the Cannibal squid , Michael Tennesen, National Wildlife Magazine, Dec/Jan 2005, vol. 43 no. 1.Squid Sensitivity Discover Magazine April, 2003 Some scientists claim the only reports of aggression towards humans have occurred when reflective diving gear or flashing lights have been present as a provocation. Roger Uzun, a veteran scuba diver and amateur underwater videographer who swam with a swarm of the animals for about 20 minutes, said they seemed to be more curious than aggressive.Jumbo squid invade San Diego shores, spook divers, Associated Press, July 17, 2009 In circumstances where these animals are not feeding or being hunted, they exhibit curious and intelligent behavior.. Electronic tagging has shown Humboldt squid undergo diel vertical migrations, which bring them closer to the surface from dusk to dawn.Gilly, W.F., U. Markaida, C.H. Baxter, B.A. Block, A. Boustany, L. Zeidberg, K. Reisenbichler, B. Robison, G. Bazzino & C. Salinas 2006. Marine Ecology Progress Series 324: 1‚Äì17. Humboldt squid are thought to have a lifespan of only about a year, although larger individuals may survive up to 2 years. A crittercam attached to two Humboldt squid revealed that they \\"flash talk\\" with each other by changing color in certain ways, and that they can disguise themselves by shifting the color patterns in other ways. What they are communicating to each other is unknown. Recent footage of shoals of these animals demonstrates a tendency to meet unfamiliar objects aggressively. Having risen to depths of below the surface to feed (up from their typical diving depth, beyond the range of human diving), they have attacked deep-sea cameras and rendered them inoperable. Humboldt squid have also been observed engaging in swarm behavior when met by the lights of submersibles, suggesting that they may follow or are attracted to light. Reports of recreational scuba divers being attacked by Humboldt squid have been confirmed. One particular diver, Scott Cassell, who has spent much of his career videotaping this species, has created body armor to protect against attacks. Distribution Santa Barbara shoreline The Humboldt squid lives at depths of in the eastern Pacific (Chile, Peru), ranging from Tierra del Fuego north to California. It gets its name from the Humboldt Current, in which it lives, off the coast of South America. Recently, the squid have been appearing farther north, as far as British Columbia. They have also ventured into Puget Sound. Though they usually prefer deep water, between 1,000 and 1,500 squid washed up on the Long Beach Peninsula in southwest Washington in late 2004 and red algae were a speculated cause for the late 2012 beaching of an unspecified number of juvenile squid (average length ) at Monterey Bay over a 2-month period. Bulletin of the United States Fish Commission Ecology The Humboldt squid's diet consists mainly of small fish, crustaceans, cephalopods, and copepods. The squid uses its barbed tentacle suckers to grab its prey and slices and tears the victim's flesh with its beak and radula. They often approach prey quickly with all 10 appendages extended forward in a cone-like shape. Upon reaching striking distance, they open their eight swimming and grasping arms, and extend two long tentacles covered in sharp 'teeth', grabbing their prey and pulling it back towards a parrot-like beak, which can easily cause serious lacerations to human flesh. These two longer tentacles can reach full length, grab prey, and retract so fast that almost the entire event happens in one frame of a normal-speed video camera. Each of the squid's suckers is ringed with sharp teeth, and the beak can tear flesh, although they are believed to lack the jaw strength to crack heavy bone. Another method of hunting is pulling the prey to great depths until it faints. The Humboldt squid is also known to quickly devour larger prey when hunting in groups. Until recently, claims of cooperative or coordinated hunting in D. gigas were considered unconfirmed and without scientific merit.Roger T Hanlon, John B Messinger, Cephalopod Behavior, p. 56, Cambridge University Press, 1996 However, research conducted between 2007 and 2011, published in June 2012, indicates this species does engage in cooperative hunting. Scientists suspect the recent expansion of the squid's range north along the West Coast of the U.S. is the result of overfishing of longer-lived apex predators.  Reproduction  Female squids lay gelatinous egg masses that are almost entirely transparent and float freely in the water column. The size of the egg mass correlates with the size of the female that laid it; large females can lay egg masses up to 3-4 m in diameter , while smaller females lay egg masses only about 1 m in diameter . Records of egg masses are extremely sparse because they are rarely encountered by humans, but from the few masses found to date, the egg masses seem to contain anywhere from 5000 to 4.1 million eggs, depending on size .  Fishing  { align=right  Squid as taken at Port Otway, western Patagonia, 1888  chromatophoric coloring. } Commercially, this species has been caught to serve the European community market (mainly Spain, Italy, France, and Ireland), Russia, China, Japan, Southeast Asia, and increasingly North and South American markets. Fishermen catch squid at night. Lights from the fishing boats reflect brightly on the plankton, which lure the squid to the surface to feed. Since the 1990s, the most important areas for landings of Humboldt squid are Chile, Mexico, and Peru (122‚Äì297, 53‚Äì66, and 291‚Äì435 thousand tonnes, respectively, in the period 2005‚Äì2007). Humboldt squid are known for their speed in feasting on hooked fish, sharks, and squid, even from their own species and shoal. Numerous accounts have the squid attacking fishermen and divers in the area. Their coloring and aggressive reputation have earned them the nickname diablos rojos (red devils) from fishermen off the coast of Mexico, as they flash red and white when struggling with the fishermen. Changes in migration patterns Humboldt squid are generally found in the warm Pacific waters off the Mexican coast; studies published in the early 2000s indicated an increase in northern migration. The large 1997‚Äì98 El Ni√±o event triggered the first sightings of Humboldt squid in Monterey Bay. Then, during the minor El Ni√±o event of 2002, they returned to Monterey Bay in higher numbers and have been seen there year- round since then. Similar trends have been shown off the coasts of Washington, Oregon, and even Alaska, although no year-round Humboldt squid populations are in these locations. This change in migration is suggested to be due to warming waters during El Ni√±o events, but other factors, such as a decrease in upper trophic level predators that would compete with the squid for food, could be impacting the migration shift, as well. Humboldt squid and ocean acidification A 2008 study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America predicts that by the end of the 21st century, ocean acidification will lower the Humboldt squid's metabolic rate by 31% and activity levels by 45%. This will lead the squid to have to retreat to shallower waters, where they can take up oxygen at higher rates. A more recent study, however, provides empirical and theoretical evidence that squid metabolism will be unaffected by ocean acidification . In popular media In 2009, the Humboldt squid was featured in the final episode of the BBC's Last Chance to See, with Stephen Fry and Mark Carwardine. The episode was about blue whales, but the presenters interviewed fishermen who talked about the exploding diablo rojo population in the Sea of Cortez and human attacks, and showed a squid trying to take a bite of a protectively clad forearm.\\"Last Chance to See,\\" BBC A shoal of Humboldt squid are the main antagonists of the 2013 novel Below, by Ryan Lockwood. In the 2015 novel Strands of Sorrow by John Ringo, Humboldt squid are depicted in the Prologue. In 2016, the Humboldt squid featured in three television shows. The first, Man Eating Super Squid: A Monster Invasion, premiered on the National Geographic Wild channel and explored various attacks by Humboldt squid in Mexico. In the show, the Humboldt squid is referred to as a real-life kraken and as \\"a global threat\\". The second show to feature the Humboldt squid recently is River Monsters: Devil of the Deep, where angler and TV show host Jeremy Wade sets off to the Sea of Cortez to investigate strange attacks on fishermen. Jeremy discovers that the fishermen were in fact attacked by Humboldt squid and that the Humboldt squid have now moved on from the Sea of Cortez south towards the coast of Peru. After joining a local fishing crew, Jeremy Wade catches multiple Humboldt squid off the coast of Peru. In Fishing Impossible shown on British TV in 2016, the team travel 10 hours out into the Pacific Ocean and put on diving suits reinforced with chain mail to protect themselves, as they plan to capture a Humboldt squid by hand. However, bad weather prevents them from diving for the squid. In 2016, Humboldt squid were featured on BBC Earth's Blue Planet II where the Humboldt's cannibalistic pack hunting was captured on film for the first time. A Humboldt Squid is a minor antagonist in the 2016 film Finding Dory where it chases and attempts to eat the main characters. This squid is presented as much larger than its real-life counterparts, easily destroying a shipping container which it seems to barely fit inside. In another film, fishermen report, among other things, that a fisherman was caught in the abyss by a squid. And another fisherman was bitten by the squid on his skull, breaking his skull.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcAIli76rAY See also *Cephalopod size *Colossal squid *Giant squid *Thysanoteuthis rhombus *Squid as food ReferencesExternal links *Sea Wolves' presentation on Humboldt squid's physiology and behavior *National Geographic: Humboldt squid *LA Times: Jumbo squid *KQED Humboldt squid broadcast *Aggressive Eating Machines, The NewsTribune.com, Tacoma, WA *Google Techtalk by Scott Cassell on Humboldt squid *BELOW:2013 Humboldt squid fiction novel Category:Squid Category:Molluscs of the Pacific Ocean Category:Marine molluscs of North America Category:Cephalopods of North America Category:Cephalopods of South America Category:Molluscs of Chile Category:Fauna of California Category:Molluscs of Mexico Category:Invertebrates of Peru Category:Fauna of Tierra del Fuego Category:Cephalopods described in 1835 Category:Taxa named by Alcide d'Orbigny Category:Bioluminescent molluscs Category:Alexander von Humboldt ","title":"Humboldt squid"},{"id":"1876520","text":"A mass formula is an equation or set of equations in physics which attempts to predict the mass or mass ratios of the subatomic particles.

Zoologist, author and surrealist painter Desmond Morris first observed his abilities when the chimp was offered a pencil and paper at two years of age. By the age of four, Congo had made 400 drawings and paintings. His style has been described as \\"lyrical abstract impressionism\\". Biography and works Congo was born in 1954. He learned to draw near the age of two, beginning when zoologist Desmond Morris offered Congo a pencil. Morris said, \\"He took a pencil and I placed a piece of card in front of him. This is how I recorded it at the time, 'Something strange was coming out of the end of the pencil. It was Congo's first line. It wandered a short way and then stopped. Would it happen again? Yes, it did, and again and again'.\\" Morris soon observed that the chimp would draw circles, and had a basic sense of composition in his drawings. He also showed the ability of symmetrical consistency between two sides of a sketch; when Morris drew a shape at one side of a piece of paper, Congo would balance the structure by making marks on the other half of the paper. Similarly, if a color on one side contained blue for example, he would add blue to the other side as well to keep balance. He soon began painting; the patterns he made were never distinguished, pictorial images, but usually of a vague \\"radiating fan pattern\\" in the abstract impressionism style. Between the ages of two and four, he produced about 400 drawings and paintings. Through that time, Congo developed a familiarity with his routine painting sessions with Morris. When a picture was taken away that he didn't consider complete, Congo would reportedly begin to scream and \\"throw fits\\". Also, if the ape considered one of his drawings to be finished, he would refuse to continue painting even if someone tried to persuade him to do so. In the late 1950s, he made appearances on the British television show Zootime, which was presented live from the London Zoo by Desmond Morris. He died at ten years of age in 1964 of tuberculosis. Reception Media reaction to Congo's painting abilities were mixed, although relatively positive and accepted with interest. Spanish painter Pablo Picasso was reportedly a \\"fan\\" of his paintings, and hung one of the ape's pictures on his studio wall after receiving it as a gift. On June 20, 2005, Congo's paintings were included in an auction at Bonhams alongside works by Renoir and Warhol‚Äîthey sold for more than expected, while Renoir's and Warhol's did not sell. American collector Howard Hong purchased three of Congo's works for over US$25,000.

He was apparently a member of the Yngling clan (mentioned in later Norse and Anglo- Saxon literature, such as Beowulf). His name Hei√∞umh√¶ri could be translated as highly honouredGokstadh√∏vdingen og hans tid. Edited by Tore Frost. Sandefjordsmuseene, 1997. . Page 56 His greatest contribution to posterity was that he asked the skald √ûj√≥√∞√≥lfr of Hvinir to compose a poem about his ancestry. This poem is known as Ynglingatal and is not only one of the oldest, but also one of the most famous and debated of the Old Norse poems. √ûj√≥√∞√≥lfr ended the poem with these lines: :Under the heaven's blue dome, a name :I never knew more true to fame :Than Rognvald bore; whose skilful hand :Could tame the scorners of the land, -- :Rognvald, who knew so well to guide :The wild sea-horses through the tide: :The Heidumh√¶re was the proud name :By which the king was known to fame. Family Traditional sources differ as to whether Ragnvald Heidumh√¶re was the son of Ragnar Lodbrok or of Olaf Geirstad- Alf. The 13th-century account in Heimskringla, which uses Ynglingatal as a source, makes Ragnvald a cousin of Harald Fairhair. A dubious, later pedigree attributes to Ragnvald a daughter, √Ösa Ragnvaldsdatter (Aseda Rognvaldsdatter), who married Eystein Ivarsson. It is through this line that Ragnvald Heidumh√¶re is a purported ancestor of William the Conqueror (and subsequent British royal houses).

Intermediate goods, producer goods or semi-finished products are goods, such as partly finished goods, used as inputs in the production of other goods including final goods. A firm may make and then use intermediate goods, or make and then sell, or buy then use them. In the production process, intermediate goods either become part of the final product, or are changed beyond recognition in the process. This means intermediate goods are resold among industries. Intermediate goods are not counted in a country's GDP, as that would mean double counting, as the final product only should be counted, and the value of the intermediate good is included in the value of the final good. U.S. and Chinese Trade in Goods with ASEAN Countries by Use, 2014 The value-added method can be used to calculate the amount of intermediate goods incorporated into GDP. This approach counts every phase of processing included in production of final goods. Characterization of intermediate goods as physical goods can be misleading, since, in advanced economies, about half of the value of intermediate inputs consist of services. Intermediate goods generally can be made and used in three different ways. First, a company can make and use its own intermediate goods. Second, a company can manufacture intermediate goods and sell them to others. Third, a company can buy intermediate goods to produce either secondary intermediate goods or final goods. Examples * Sugar ‚Äì sugar is used as a final good (when it is sold as sugar in the supermarket) or as an input (when it is used as an ingredient in other food products) * Steel ‚Äì a raw material used in the production of many other goods, such as bicycles. * Car engines - Some firms make and use their own, others buy them from other producers as an intermediate good, then use them in their own car. * Paint, plywood, pipe and tube, and ancillary parts. * wood - wood is used in multiple purposes for construction of building or production of furniture * glass - glass can be used to make dishes, cups, bottles or windows * salt - salt is used in almost all food production * silver and gold - silver and gold can be used for production of jewelry or kitchen utensils and even for food decoration or interior design * An interesting example is the use of chlorine in the production of polyurethane, which contains no chlorine. Rock salt is electrolyzed to produce chlorine, which is reacted with carbon monoxide to give phosgene. Phosgene, a chlorine compound, and a diamine are then reacted to produce a diisocyanate and hydrochloric acid that is neutralized in situ. The chlorine is removed as chloride salt waste. The diisocyanate reacts with a diol to produce polyurethane, which contains no chlorine. Chlorine is used because chlorine is electronegative enough to produce an isocyanate, but does not become a part of the product; it lowers the atom economy.

On behalf of the local committees he had joined the revolutionary propaganda. He was delegate of the sixth congress of the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party of the Arkhangelsk party organization. He participated in the February Revolution in 1917 and was a member of the famous Petrograd Soviet. He was actively involved in the preparation and conducting of the October Revolution in 1917. In 1918 he joined the Cheka. In 1918, he was sent by Lenin to Latvia to prosecute the revolution there. In 1919 he was attached to the Red Army and later became a manager in the Construction Ministry of the Latvian Socialist Soviet Republic. After the defeat of the Soviet Latvian r√©gime he returned to Russia in 1919. He was a lecturer and political commissar in the Red Army from 1919 to 1929. In 1931 he graduated from the history department of the Moscow Institute of the Red Professoriat, and between 1931 and 1933 he was a graduate student in the institute.

In June 1940 he played a leading role in the process of admitting of Latvia into the USSR. From March 1941 to 1959 he served as Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Latvia for propaganda and agitation. During the Great Patriotic War in 1941-1945 he worked to prepare the party and the Soviet cadres to transform Latvia into a communist state.

History The first Wagamama was opened in 1992 in Bloomsbury, London, founded by Alan Yau, who subsequently created the Chinese restaurants Hakkasan and Yauatcha. In June 2005, the restaurant's owner Graphite Capital sold the majority stake of 77.5% to Lion Capital LLP for ¬£103million. In April 2011, the chain was sold to Duke Street Capital, for an estimated sum of ¬£215million. As of January 2014, the chain included over 190 restaurants, with 130 being in the United Kingdom. The chain was acquired for ¬£559m by the Restaurant Group, owner of Frankie & Benny's, Garfunkels, and other well known fast casual dining chains in October 2018. Other restaurants are located in Austria, Bahrain, Belgium, Bulgaria, Cyprus, Denmark, Gibraltar, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Malta, the Netherlands, Oman, Qatar, Slovakia, Spain, Sweden, Turkey, the UAE, and the United States. A new restaurant has opened at the beginning of 2019 in France. Previous countries served by the Wagamama brand include Australia (2002-2014) and New Zealand (until 2019). Wagamama has released two cookbooks in order to further extend its brand. The first site on Streatham Street, Bloomsbury, London, closed permanently on 19 June 2016. Brand The word is Japanese for \\"self-indulgent\\", \\"self-centred\\", \\"disobedient\\", or \\"wilful\\" and is most often translated by the brand as \\"naughty child\\". Wagamama brands itself as following the process of kaizen. News items=Environmental record In November 2015, the chain was named by the Marine Conservation Society as one of seven restaurants surveyed that failed to meet a basic level of sustainability in its seafood. However, this was later retracted, as Wagamama revealed more information about the origin of its seafood. Employment rights In December 2017, Wagamama apologised after it was revealed some workers in Finchley were warned they would face disciplinary action if calling in sick over Christmas. The manager of the North Finchley branch asserted it was the responsibility of staff members, according to their contracts and handbook, to find somebody to cover their shifts. Wagamama said this was an isolated incident, not part of its employment policy.

She is known only through the Roman historian Livy's account of the introduction, growth and spread of unofficial Bacchanalia festivals, which were ferociously suppressed in 186 BC under threat of extreme penalty. Paculla Annia is said to have presided over the corruption of Bacchus's mystery cult and its holy orgia, starting around 188. Livy describes the Bacchanalia as hitherto reserved to women, a daylight ritual held on just three days of the year; Paculla Annia changed them to nocturnal rites, increased their frequency to five a month, opened them to all social classes and both sexes - starting with her own sons, Minius and Herennius Cerrinius - and made wine-fueled violence and sexual promiscuity mandatory for all initiates. The cult was thought to function as a hidden state within the state, with particular appeal to those with leuitas animi (fickle or uneducated minds); the lower classes, plebeians, women, the young, morally weak, and \\"men most like women\\" were thought most susceptible but even men of the highest class were not immune. A virtuous ex-initiate and prostitute, Hispala Faecenia, though fearing the vengeance of the cult, revealed all to a shocked Roman senate. Once their investigation was complete, they suppressed the cult, saving Rome from the divine wrath and disaster it would otherwise have suffered. Livy claims that six thousand were executed, and that the arrests included Paculla's son, Minius Cerrineus. The legislation against the cult, or rather its forced reformation, is given in the Senatus consultum de Bacchanalibus.Erich S. Gruen, \\"The Bacchanalia affair\\", in Studies in Greek Culture and Roman Policy, University of California Press, 1996, p. 34 ff. Paculla's fate is unknown. Most modern scholarship agrees that Dionysiac or Bacchic mystery cults had been practiced in Roman Italy for several decades before 186, and were considered acceptable by Roman authorities until this abrupt \\"discovery\\" and rapid suppression.Livy describes their introduction by a foreign soothsayer, a \\"Greek of mean condition... a low operator of sacrifices\\" and their secretive spread, \\"like a plague\\", towards Rome via Etruria; see Sarolta Takacs, Vestal Virgins, Sibyls, and Matrons: Women in Roman Religion, University of Texas Press, 2008, p.95. See also Beard, M., Price, S., North, J., Religions of Rome: Volume 1, a History, illustrated, Cambridge University Press, 1998, pp. 93 - 96, and Walsh, PG, Making a drama out of a Crisis: Livy on the Bacchanalia, Greece & Rome, Vol XLIII, No. 2, October 1996. Paculla Annia is unlikely to have introduced all the changes attributed to her by Livy;Erich S. Gruen, Studies in Greek Culture and Roman Policy, University of California Press, 1996, pp 48 - 54. many of his dramatis personae, stylistic flourishes and tropes may draw more on Roman satyr plays than on the Bacchanalia themselves.The plots of Greek-based Satyr plays would have been familiar to Roman audiences from around the 3rd century BC on. See Robert Rouselle, Liber-Dionysus in Early Roman Drama, The Classical Journal, 82, 3 (1987), p. 191. Hispala Faecenia provides the dramatic trope of \\"golden-hearted prostitute\\", whose courageous testimony, goodness, and loyalty far outweigh her low origin, profession and fear of reprisal.Victoria Emma Pag√°n, Conspiracy Narratives in Roman History, University of Texas Press, 2004, pp. 61 - 65. Fontaine, assuming Plautus's Truculentus as contemporary with or no earlier than the events of 186, speculates its plot, themes and central character, the greedy, scheming, \\"evil courtesan\\" Phrynesium, arch- manipulator of men, as a \\"thinly veiled and politically conservative allegory\\" of Paculla Annia and her involvement with the Bacchanalia, particularly her illicit introduction of men into the cult, and its challenge to an established order and rule.Michael Fontaine, Funny Words in Plautine Comedy, Oxford University Press, 2010, pp. 187 - 190. The character Phrynesium is based on Phryne, a Greek courtesan charged - much as Livy charges Paculla Annia - with the impious introduction of a mystery cult in which men and women were promiscuously mixed. In Fontaine's opinion, Truculentus aims to please a knowing and educated audience of Roman aristocrats. The Senatus consultum de Bacchanalibus has been interpreted as an assertion of Rome's civil and religious authority, either throughout the Italian peninsula or within Roman territories, following the recent Punic War and subsequent social and political instability.During the Punic crisis, some foreign cults and oracles had been repressed, on much smaller scale and not outside Rome itself. See Erich S. Gruen, Studies in Greek culture and Roman policy, BRILL, 1990, pp.34-78: on precedents see p.41 ff. Illicit Bacchanals persisted covertly for many years, particularly in Southern Italy, their likely place of origin.See Sarolta A.

Biography She was the daughter of Henry Torrens Anstruther and Eva Anstruther and spent her childhood in Whitchurch in Buckinghamshire, England. In 1923 she married Anthony Maxtone Graham, a broker at Lloyd's of London, with whom she had three children. This marriage eventually failed, and she started an affair with Adolf Placzek, a Viennese art historian 12 years her junior. She married him as her second husband, 5 years before her death. Her final years were marked by severe depression, leading to a five-month stay in a psychiatric hospital. Following a mastectomy for breast cancer, she died of cancer in New York in 1953 at the age of 52. Her ashes are buried beside her father in the family grave at St. John The Evangelist Church, in Whitchurch. Jan Struther is the great-aunt of Ian Maxtone Graham, former co-executive producer of The Simpsons. Struther is the subject of a biography, The Real Mrs. Miniver, written by her granddaughter, Ysenda Maxtone Graham. Literary career In the 1930s she started to write for Punch magazine, and this brought her to the attention of The Times newspaper, where Peter Fleming asked her to write a series of columns for the paper, about \\"an ordinary sort of woman who leads an ordinary sort of life ‚Äì rather like yourself\\". The resulting character that she created, Mrs Miniver, proved a huge success from the character's inception in 1937, and the columns were subsequently published in book form in 1939. On the outbreak of war, this book became the basis for a patriotic American film, Mrs Miniver, released in 1942, which won six Academy Awards, including Best Picture. By 1942, Struther had herself gone to America as a lecturer. In the 1940s she was a frequent guest panelist on the popular American radio quiz show Information Please. She was one of the few women panelists to appear repeatedly on the program. An apocryphal story, attributed to fellow panelist Oscar Levant, tells that her appearances on the show stopped abruptly after she answered a question by referring to Agatha Christie's book Ten Little Niggers, which was the original British title of the book Ten Little Indians (later retitled And Then There Were None). However, the episode of Information Please in which Struther used the original Christie title in her answer to a listener question was in fact broadcast February 7, 1941, while the majority of Struther's appearances on the show (at least eight more occasions) occurred after this incident, through January 29, 1945. As well as the creation of the character Mrs Miniver in a fortnightly column in The Times, she is remembered for her hymns for children, including \\"Lord of All Hopefulness\\", \\"When a Knight Won His Spurs\\" and \\"Daisies are Our Silver\\". These resulted from an approach by Canon Percy Dearmer of Westminster Abbey, Words Editor of the enlarged edition of Songs of Praise published in 1931 by OUP. She herself was an agnostic, although she did go to church.

It is surely the most technologically advanced.\\"Mark Swed, Epic, extravagant, Los Angeles Times, February 5, 2005, Accessed December 21, 2010. The New York Times highly praised all the technical aspects and costumes, but felt that it did not succeed in a particularly compelling story, rather it was \\"essentially about the kind of wild physical feats that all Cirque shows are about, their jaw-dropping effect multiplied by the huge dimensions of the theatrical space.\\"Charles Isherwood, Fire, Acrobatics and Most of All, Hydraulics, The New York Times, February 5, 2005, Accessed December 21, 2010. The show has been seen by more than one million spectators since its opening in February 2005. History Created and directed by Robert Lepage, K√† began show previews on November 26, 2004 and the show premiered on February 3, 2005. K√† was the first Cirque du Soleil show to encompass a cohesive storyline. The show's title, K√†, is inspired by the ancient Egyptian belief in the \\"K√†,\\" an invisible spiritual duplicate of the body that accompanies every human being throughout this life and into the next. K√† is the first Cirque du Soleil production that deviates from the company's usual format‚Äîthe production presents a more straightforward story, unlike the more abstract visuals presented by other Cirque productions. The show and the theater cost $165 million to develop. Set and technical information K√† lacks a conventional stage with a permanent floor; instead, two giant moving platforms and five smaller lifts and platforms appear to float through a bottomless space. A narrow boardwalk separates the audience from a deep abyss where the stage floor would normally be. From the stage level of the boardwalk up to the high grid is , and the pit drops below, amounting to a total of some 15 stories from the highest ceiling grid to the lowest floor level. The opening width and depth of the performance area are each . This enormous performance space is reconfigured with each scene change by the complex movements of the show's lifts and platforms. The largest moveable platform employed in the show, the Sand Cliff Deck, measures and weighs 50 tons. A vertical gantry crane supports and controls the Sand Cliff Deck, lifting the platform up and down , rotating it 360 degrees and tilting it from flat to 100 degrees. This is attached to four hydraulic cylinders that run along two support columns. The Sand Cliff Deck is equipped with show and work lights, circular elevators to bring performers in and out, 80 'rod actuators' that sprout from the floor surface to enable performers to climb it when it is tilted vertically, and video projection tiles that allow computer-generated images to appear on the floor of the deck. In one scene, the entire deck is covered with of imported granular cork from Portugal which creates the realistic appearance of a beach. The second largest platform, the Tatami Deck, is a cantilevered platform located upstage of the Sand Cliff Deck. It weighs , and slides in and out like a drawer to provide a horizontal stage and carry massive set pieces such as the Wheel of Death. These two decks can appear alone or together or simply disappear from view; they can move in front of, behind, above or below each other. The theater and stage were designed by British architect Mark Fisher; the structural design and engineering of the stage platforms was by the New York City engineering firm McLaren Engineering Group, owned and operated by Mal McLaren. The torsion tube, wrist, and arm assembly for the Sand Cliff deck were built by Timberland Equipment, a company that normally builds mining equipment. In 2008, the unique floating stages earned K√† the prestigious Thea Award for Outstanding Technical Achievement from the Themed Entertainment Association. Effects K√† combines complex automation, pyrotechnics, puppetry, and multimedia projections that help immerse the audience in the story. Sound and video The K√† theater, which has a capacity of 1950 people, is equipped with a total of 4774 loudspeaker drivers in 2139 cabinets: a pair of speakers at ear level in every seat and hundreds more strategically placed around the auditorium. The digitally mixed audio system routes an intricate mix of sound effects and music to these speakers to create a very dynamic surround-sound audio experience. Sound effects can be targeted, manipulated and customized to any of 16 seating zones. The multimedia projection in the show utilizes both infrared video motion detecting as well as a system of touch-sensitive panels beneath the surface of the main 'Sand Cliff' deck. This allows the system to track the location of individual performers and change the video content accordingly. A similar example of the infrared portion of this technology can be seen in some movie theater lobbies where people can step on and burst video projected bubbles. Safety K√† takes safety very seriously in the form of technical implementations as well as training. Such areas include power sources, fire precautions, falling, harness equipment, and other such items among many others. As an example, many performers wear earpieces during the show in order to hear cues when they can perform various stunts safely. Due to the speed in which artists fall from the decks, an array of airbags had to be used in lieu of traditional nets alone. These airbags sit atop two nets, which at times are below the point the artist begins the fall. The airbags contain individual cells which can inflate and deflate independently. In case a power outage occurs, each airbag has its own uninterruptible power supply which can last up to 30 minutes. The sandcliff deck has pegs built into it which are used during the Climb scene. Each peg has a sensor which will not allow it to shoot out from the deck if something is blocking its path. These pegs shoot out at a speed of , simulating arrows striking the surface. Likewise, each peg can only retract with less than of pressure. Thus if someone were hanging off of it, the peg would stay in place. If something were to go wrong with the deck, a set of backup pegs are in place which can be utilized as a safety ladder to allow performers to exit the deck safely. As for the aerial rigging system which allows performers to perform tricks in the air while harnessed, it too has safety features. If a harness or wire were to fail, a fail-safe mechanism is in place which would lower the performer to the stage or in the aisles to safely detach from the cabling system. As the K√† theatre is inside the MGM, it too is integrated into the building's fire suppression system. During the show, stage managers must contact hotel security and ask that the fire officer override the fire detection equipment in the theatre during the duration of any pyrotechnic and fire stunts. =Accidents and incidents= On June 29, 2013, cast member Sarah \\"Sasoun\\" Guyard-Guillot, an acrobat from Paris, France, died after she fell about 94 feet from the show's stage at MGM Grand. She was taken to the University Medical Center of Southern Nevada where she died. It was the first reported death from an accident onstage in Cirque du Soleil's 30-year history. It was the second time in less than a week that a Cirque show on the Strip was halted for an accident involving one of its artists; a performer in one of the final preview performances of Michael Jackson One at Mandalay Bay suffered a mild concussion after slipping through the slack rope in the show‚Äôs ‚ÄúStranger in Moscow‚Äù scene, missing the protective pad below the act and landing hard upon the stage. The performer was expected to return to the show. Two artists in Zumanity at New York-New York were seriously injured in an onstage fall in November 2007. Cast A team of over 300 people make up the production team for K√†, ranging from technicians to support staff. Eighty people from this team comprise the on- stage artists and performers. * Archers and Spearmen: A malevolent underground society built on war and domination by violence. They mine a rare element that can be processed into powerful explosives for weapons. * The Chief Archer: The imposing general of the Archers' forces; he directs the archers and spearmen during their strategic attacks. * The Chief Archer's daughter: This femme fatale is desired by all the men of the Archer tribe but spurns their affections. As she falls in love with the Twin Brother, she finds her loyalty divided. * The Evil Counselor: Leader and strategist of the Archer tribe. * The Counselor's son: A brilliant designer of weapons and war machines; malignant, jealous and petty. * The Court Jester: The Fool of the court shares a special bond with the Twins. He helps protect the Twin Brother. * The Firefly Boy: The handsome leader of the Forest Tribe swings from the trees like Tarzan. He saves the Twin Sister from falling to her death. * The Forest Tribe: They live harmoniously with nature in the forests, and they offer protection to the Twin Sister. * The Mountain Tribe: They live isolated from the empire in the mountaintop. They help save the Twin Sister. * The Twins: They are brother and sister and are heirs to the throne. As children of the imperial court, they are educated, noble, and trained in combat. * The Nursemaid: She is charged with watching over the Twins in their young age. * The Valets: Bumbling servants of the Imperial Court who constantly get into trouble. They help protect the Twins. * The Empire: A noble and peaceful society which represents the pinnacle of civilization in the world of K√Ä. * The Emperor: Monarch of the Empire; father of the Twins. * The Empress: Co- ruler with the Emperor; mother of the Twins. Her elaborate dress references the traditional costumes of Peking opera. * The Imperial Guards: Martial artists and protectors of the Emperor's Court; they are dressed in Asian- inspired robes. * The Animals: Brought to life by larger-than-life puppets, the animals of K√† include a pair of crabs, a starfish, a turtle, a giant grasshopper, a snake, and a caterpillar. Choreography The choreography incorporates several types of acrobatics and martial arts, including fight scenes using the Wushu style of martial arts, Chinese opera, Poi for manipulating staves and batons, Brazilian Capoeira dance, bungees, aerial straps, swing poles, and a wheel of death. Acts K√† is a story about \\"conflict and love\\", of \\"imperial twins who are separated at the prime of their youth and must undergo a rite of passage of self-discovery. It is about their encounters with K√†, the fire that has the dual power to destroy or illuminate.\\" Unlike other Cirque du Soleil performances, K√† offers four pre- shows. Once the house opens, guests are greeted by the villagers of K√† (better known as the ‚ÄúGatekeepers\\"). Twenty minutes before curtain, two musicians enter the lobby and climb up to two stringed instruments specially designed for K√† and integrated into the architecture. Ten minutes before the show, actors appear in the metal framework to the left and right of the stage and perform flips and leaps assisted with ropes to dive into the audience and attempt to scare viewers. Five minutes before showtime, a staged act informs the audience that there is no flash photography or cell phone usage allowed. The story is told in a total of fourteen scenes, each of which is preceded by movement of one or more of the massive stage elements. * The Pageant: K√† begins with the stage set as a ship. The twins are returning home, and preparations are in motion for their arrival. The boat docks and the entire royal family is united. The court celebrates the return of the twins by displaying fantastic feats in a pageant, while the twins each perform together on their flutes. The Counselor and his son interrupt the celebration with a proposition of the alliance - the king angrily refuses, and the two intruders retreat. Just as the celebration comes to a close, pandemonium erupts when the court is attacked by a group of archers. The twins watch in horror as their parents, The Emperor and Empress, are assassinated in front of their eyes. * The Storm: As the palace burns to the ground, the surviving members flee for their lives. Accompanied by their nursemaid, Twin Sister and Twin Brother attempt to escape to a boat that will take them to safety. However, the Twin Brother is left behind, shot down by an arrow. The Court Jester jumps off the boat to save the Twin Brother from his impending doom. The boat escapes, only to sink in a terrible storm. * The Deep: As a soft piano and cello duet plays, the Nursemaid nearly drowns in the water. The Twin Sister dives into the depths to rescue her and quickly swims to the surface with the Nursemaid in tow. * Archer's Den: As light returns, the stage is now the Archer's Den. The Chief Archer, the Evil Counselor, and their men celebrate the destruction of the Imperial Palace. The Counselor's Son unveils a model of the Death Machine that he designed to \\"grind bones with the magical ore to unleash the destructive power of fire\\" and use it to kill and destroy all that stand in the Archers' path to conquer the Empire. * Wash-up on Shore: The Twin Sister, her Nursemaid, and the two Valets are reunited on a golden sandy beach. As they explore, they encounter giant sea creatures, including a crab, a turtle, a centipede, and a starfish. The group then leaves to search for other survivors. * Lantern (Shadows): In the meantime, the Court Jester and the Twin Brother have taken refuge in a cave. The Jester gently tries to nurse the Twin Brother's wounds. To distract him from his pain and fear, the Jester teaches the Twin Brother the art of shadow puppets. This beautiful moment is spoiled by the archers, who, watching at a distance, plot their capture of the two. The Jester hears a sound and investigates, leaving Twin Brother alone. The Twin Brother turns and sees the face of the Chief Archer's Daughter. Their eyes meet but are interrupted as the Archers leap out and capture him. The Chief Archer's Daughter watches helplessly as the Twin Brother is carried away. * The Climb: Meanwhile, the Twin Sister and her entourage are scaling a mountain when they are also attacked by the Archers. The Archers do not capture them, but the group becomes separated. * Blizzard: The Twin Sister and the Nursemaid are reunited through the assistance of a friendly mountain tribe, but the Archers also manage to find the clan. * Archers Attack: Under the threat of being captured by the Archers, the mountain tribe saves the Twin Sister by revealing their escape device -- a simple tent dwelling that transforms into a miraculous human-powered flying machine. The group escapes but the Twin Sister falls from the machine, plunging into a deep, lush forest. * Flutes (Captivity): The stage returns to the Archer's Den, where the Twin Brother is imprisoned in a small cage. The Chief Archer's Daughter watches from a distance, holding the flutes that the twins played before their lives were changed forever. All seems lost for the Twin Brother until he finds a friend in the kind-natured Chief Archer's Daughter, who dares to approach him. She passes the flutes to the Twin Brother, he begins to play and when she leans towards the cage for a closer look at him, he leans forward to steal a brief kiss. Although the Chief Archer's Daughter is taken aback, as she turns away from the Twin Brother it is obvious that she has also become smitten by him. After their tender moment and after great hesitation, the Chief Archer's Daughter sets the Twin Brother free from his cage, begging him to flee. Before he does, the Twin Brother makes a decision -- he returns to her his flutes, the precious ceremonial gifts that were treasured by their kingdom. The Twin Brother then escapes, leaving the Chief Archer's Daughter in hope they will meet again. She cannot hide her joy -- she expresses her love through a touching performance of dance using the twins' flutes. All of this is secretly witnessed by the Counselor's Son, who has desired the Chief Archer's Daughter for years. Engulfed by rage and jealousy of his unrequited love, he prepares for war. * The Forest: The stage lights up again revealing the lush forest into which the Twin Sister has fallen. The magical forest is home to many creatures, including enormous insects and a long snake. As the Twin Sister falls, a dashing creature comes to her rescue. It is the Firefly Boy, who lives within the forest. He swoops down and rescues her, before inviting her to dance within the trees with him. Perched high above in the vines is one of the singers, singing a sweet and exotic melody for their acrobatic dance. Knowing that she must continue her search for her brother, the Twin Sister reluctantly leaves. * Slave Cage: Back at the Archers' Den, the Death Machine has been completed and the enslaved former citizens of the Empire (including the captured Nursemaid and Valets) toil away in the mines. The Evil Counselor and his son now sense that they have enough support and admiration amongst the Archers‚Äô, forcing them to usurp the Chief Archer and assuming command of the Archers' forces. The fiendish Death Machine (Wheel of Death) is powered by slaves running in hamster-wheel cages on both ends of a long rotating pendulum arm. We recognize the two slaves in the Wheel of Death as former members of the Imperial Court. While operating the machine, the slaves escape out of the cage and brazenly taunt their captors by performing elaborate and dangerous stunts on the moving Death Machine. The enslaved Empire is inspired by the courage of the two slaves and while the Archers are distracted by the events, the Empire rises up and revolts against its captors. The bravery of the two slaves in the Wheel of Death begins to turn the tide in the war. In the conclusion, the Chief Archer‚Äôs daughter is able to rescue her father from captivity and the Twins are finally reunited. * Final Battle: An army, led by the Evil Counselor and his son, is preparing to crush the remains of the empire once and for all. With the aid of the Firefly Boy and the people of the forest, the Twins lead a counterattack and are victorious. In the Aftermath, we hear the cries of sorrow from the Counselor. He rushes to the side of his son, who apparently lies dying in the center of the battlefield. The stage slowly disappears into darkness. * Aftermath: The stage lights up for a final time, revealing the same boat the twins used to return to the land. Triumphant after the battle, peace and harmony has been restored to all of the empire. The twins now rule the empire, and each has married their beloved met on their journey. The Chief Archer has vowed peace and symbolizes this by breaking his bow over his knee. The Counselor and his son also return. Although not dead, The Counselor's Son has been blinded by the battle. To show they have realized the error of their ways, they make a magnificent display through fireworks. K√† ends the way it started; in celebration. Act changes *Pillars: Performers leapt over pillars whilst displaying their martial arts and acrobatic skills. The pillars were around 22 inches in diameter and 15 feet tall. It was taken out of the show however after director Robert Lepage felt that it didn't fit into the show well and also the act was quite dangerous and caused many injuries to the artists so was eventually taken out. *The Wash up on shore sequence has frequently changed over the years, from having two crabs instead of one, and having the original three valets wash up on shore instead of already being with the characters. *There were originally three Valets before being cut down to two. *Following the stage death of acrobatic performer Sarah Guillot-Guyard, and K√† resumes performances, K√† was presented without the \\"Battle Scene\\" act. This act was then replaced with a transition artistic scene, \\"The Dressing-Ritual\\", which was originally a rotational act that debuted in 2004, and also maintained both the storyline of production and its 90-minute running time. In November 2014, the Battle Scene started being presented during certain performances of K√†, and later returned on December 12, 2014. Costumes Asian visual iconography was the inspiration for many of the costumes in K√†: this can be seen in the imperial court and martial artists wardrobes. The Twins, for instance, have very lavish silk costumes which draw inspiration from orientalist painters from Japan, Korea, and India. Cirque du Soleil utilized a new type of digital screen printing in order to design many costumes for K√†, examples of which can be seen in the Forest People, Archers, and the Counselor's Son. The Forest People's costumes rely on printing the performers' body definitions onto the actual fabric to enhance the appearance of making their skin actually look like it is truly blue and green. Inspiration was drawn from the African Maasai warriors' ritual scar markings. As for the Archers, skin-toned Tactel was selected and tattoo designs were printed on it to make the Archers' tattoos look truly realistic. They also have moulded rubber toes attached to their shoes, giving the appearance that they are barefoot. Tattooing techniques used for the Archers were also applied to the Counselor's Son. In addition, a ripped piece of kilt is superimposed on his costume; this was made by using \\"shibori\\" (a Japanese tye-dyeing technique). The crab puppets seen in the beach scene each took approximately 1,300 hours to create. Music K√† features an off-stage band that accompanies the acting, acrobatics, and singing that takes place on stage. During various portions of the show, different musicians make appearances in the show, performing in costume directly on the stage. The vocals in K√† are provided by a mezzo-soprano(played by Rochelle Collins) and an alto(played by Lizzy Munson). Originally, K√†'s score was to be composed by Benoit Jutras. However, he left the show because of creative differences, and the music of K√† was composed by Ren√© Dup√©r√©, who has composed music for multiple other Cirque productions, including Myst√®re at Treasure Island, and Cirque's touring production of Alegr√≠a. The soundtrack for K√† was released on the 18th of October, 2005. In addition to the original score, the soundtrack features several 'inspired by' tracks. Although the album is somewhat remixed, most of the content remains faithful to the show. The original album artwork of K√†, 2005. Co-produced, arranged and engineered by Martin Lord-Ferguson, the K√† soundtrack features a symphonic orchestra of 57 musicians conducted by Hollywood veteran Simon Leclerc and a choir of over 50 singers conducted by Jean-Sebastien Allaire, making K√† Cirque du Soleil's most \\"ambitious recording to date.\\" The album features the voices of √âlise Velle (Ren√© Dup√©r√©'s wife), Ella Louise Allaire (vocalist, arranger and vocal coach) and a young soprano boy named Philippe Lapan-Vandal. In addition, the 'inspired by' tracks, with the exception of \\"If I Could Reach Your Heart\\" (performed by √âlise Velle), feature the voice of Canadian world artist Nitza Melas. Through the music of K√†, Ren√© Dup√©r√© attempts to provoke various emotions and moods such as drama, emergency, serenity, passion, and even \\"the birth of love\\". Dup√©r√© describes the music with an \\"African flavor\\" and states that he wants the audience to feel that the show is \\"full of energy\\". He says that the music is not intended to sound as though it belongs to a specific time frame. \\"It could be from medieval times or even 200 years in the future...the music itself is ageless.\\" The tracks on the K√† soundtrack, followed by the scenes to accompany the songs are listed below. # O Makund√© (Foreword / Aftermath) # Pageant (The Pageant / Finale) # Koudamare (Blizzard) # Storm (The Storm) # Deep (The Deep) # Shadowplay (Lantern (Shadows)) # Pursuit (Climb) # Forest (The Forest (Second part of the scene) / Pole jumping (Second part of the act, 2004‚Äì2007)) # Flight (Flight) # Threat (Pillars (2004‚Äì2007) / Twin's Abduction (2007‚Äìpresent)) # Love Dance (Captivity) # Battlefield (Final Battle (2004‚Äì2013, 2014‚Äìpresent)) # Aftermath (Aftermath) # If I Could Reach Your Heart (adapted from \\"O Makund√©\\") # We've Been Waiting So Long (adapted from \\"Shadowplay\\") # Reach For Me Now (adapted from \\"Deep\\") Songs in the show that are not on the soundtrack album: * The Music Box (Opening) * Archer's Den * Wash-up on Shore * Firefly Boy (Aerial straps (2007‚Äìpresent)) * The Forest (First part of the scene) / Pole jumping (First part of the act, 2004‚Äì2007) * Slave Cage * The Dressing Ritual (2004 - present) Comic book adaptation Cirque du Soleil and Marvel Entertainment teamed up to adapt K√† through a limited four-part series of collectible comic books. Created by comic book writer Bryan J.L. Glass, artist Wellinton Alves and colorist Jean-Francois Beaulieu, these comics follow the heroic journey of the Imperial Twins, separated by war, who encounter adventure and peril at every turn on their quest to reunite their kingdom. The first installment debuted at the Marvel booth at the 2012 San Diego Comic-Con on July 12 ‚Äì 15, then a wide release followed into comic book stores and a digital download version with subsequent issues to come.

Loops In the following, label is an optional identifier terminated by a colon, and block is a sequence of one of more Perl statements surrounded by braces. All looping constructs except for the C-style \`for\`-loop can have a \`continue\` block that is executed after each iteration of the loop body, before the loop condition is evaluated again. label for ( expr1 ; expr2 ; expr3 ) block This is the so-called C-style \`for\` loop. The first expression is evaluated prior to the first loop iteration. The second expression is evaluated prior to each iteration and the loop is terminated if it evaluates to false. The third expression is evaluated after each iteration, prior to deciding whether to perform the next. This \`for\` loop is the only looping construct that can not have a \`continue\` block, but expr3 is functionally equivalent. label for var ( list ) block label for var ( list ) block continue block label foreach var ( list ) block label foreach var ( list ) block continue block In \`foreach\`, var is a scalar variable that defaults to \`$_\` if omitted. For each element of list, var is aliased to the element, and the loop body is executed once. The keywords \`for\` and \`foreach\` are synonyms and are always interchangeable. label while ( expr ) block label while ( expr ) block continue block label until ( expr ) block label until ( expr ) block continue block The \`while\` loop repeatedly executes the loop body as long as the controlling expression is true. The condition is evaluated before the loop body. \`until\` is similar, but executes the loop body as long as the condition is false. label block label block continue block The label block construct is a bit of an oddity: Perl treats a bare block - with or without a label - as a loop that is executed once. This means that the loop control keywords can be used to restart the block or to exit it prematurely; a bare block can also have a \`continue\` block. Loop control keywords Perl provides three loop control keywords that all accept an optional loop label as an argument. If no label is specified, the keywords act on the innermost loop. Within nested loops, the use of labels enables control to move from an inner loop to an outer one, or out of the outer loop altogether. The loop control keywords are treated as expressions in Perl, not as statements like in C or Java. * The \`next\` keyword jumps directly to the end of the current iteration of the loop. This usually causes the next iteration of the loop to be started, but the \`continue\` block and loop condition are evaluated first. * The \`last\` keyword immediately terminates execution of the loop identified by the label. The \`continue\` block is not executed. * The \`redo\` keyword restarts the current iteration of the loop identified by the label. Neither the \`continue\` block nor the loop condition is evaluated. Conditional statements if ( expr ) block if ( expr ) block else block if ( expr ) block elsif ( expr ) block ... else block unless ( expr ) block unless ( expr ) block else block unless ( expr ) block elsif ( expr ) block ... else block where block is a sequence of one of more Perl statements surrounded by braces. The controlling expressions are evaluated in a boolean context: The numeric value 0, the strings \\"\\" and \\"0\\", and the undefined value \`undef\` are false, all other values are true. This means that the strings \\"0.0\\", \\"00\\", \\"-0\\", and \\"0 but true\\" are all true, even though their value would be converted to 0 in a numeric context; values like these are sometimes used when a successful operation needs to return 0. Evaluating an empty array in scalar context yields \`undef\`, which is false. Therefore, the following example prints \\"a is empty\\": my @a=(); unless (@a) { print \\"a is empty\\" } Statement modifiers Perl also provides variants of the loop and conditional constructs that work on a simple statement (an expression evaluated for its side-effects) instead of a block: statement if expr; statement unless expr; statement while expr; statement until expr; statement for list; statement foreach list; The \`while\` and \`until\` modifiers test the controlling expression before executing the statement, just like their loop counterparts. However, they are not considered actual loops, so the loop control keywords \`next\`, \`last\` and \`redo\` cannot be used with them. They have special semantics when combined with the \`do\` keyword: do block while expr; do block until expr; In these constructs, the condition is tested after the block is executed, so the block always executes at least once. These modifiers cannot be nested, so the following is illegal statement if expression for list; #ERROR and should be written as one of: ( expression ) and ( statement ) for list; for ( list ) { statement if expression } do { statement if expression } foreach list; goto There are two forms of goto in Perl: goto label and goto &subroutine; The first form is generally deprecated, and is only used in rare situations. For example, when attempting to preserve error status in \`$?\`, some modules will use goto like this: open(A, \\"<\\", $filea) or goto fail; open(B ,\\">\\", $fileb) or goto fail; print B or goto fail; close A or goto fail; close B or goto fail; return 1; fail: $reason = \\"In copy: $?\\"; return 0; The second form is called a tail call, and is used to enhance the performance of certain kinds of constructs where Perl's default stack management would perform non-optimally. For example: sub factorial { my $n = shift; my $total = shift(@_)  1; if ($n > 1) { @_ = ($n-1,$total*$n); goto &factorial; } else { return $total; } } This form is also used to create aliases for subroutines with minimal overhead. This can help reduce \\"Out of Memory\\" errors (or high memory usage in general) found often in repeating the same subroutine.

In this fictional world, humans live in independent city-states, each of which has developed a distinct civilization, each characterized by a distinctive architectural style. The full series is available in most Western European languages (in French and Dutch by Casterman, in German, Spanish, and Portuguese by local publishing houses) and other French speaking countries (in francophone Canada by Editions Flammarion). While the first five books of the series had been published in English by NBM Publishing, they discontinued publishing the series in 2008, with the editions going out of print. After a successful kickstarter campaign in mid 2013, Alaxis Press (an imprint of Atomic Vision Entertainment, Inc. and named after the \\"sulphuric\\" Obscure City of Alaxis) were able to fund a complete official English-language edition of The Leaning Girl (1996; volume 6 of the official series) and Leaning Mary (1995; spin-off picture book).

An important motif is the process of what he calls Bruxellisation, the destruction of this historic Brussels in favor of anonymous, low-quality modernist office and business buildings. Coming from a family of architects, Schuiten had many relatives, especially his father and brothers, who were instrumental in Bruxellisation, an important part in Schuiten's and Peeters' 1950s childhood memories of the city. Schuiten was brought up to study architecture by his father, both in university and early on at home, while young Schuiten preferred to pursue his escape to the world of Franco-Belgian bandes dessin√©es such as those he found in Pilote magazine that his older brother introduced him to, with Ren√© Goscinny, Morris, and Andr√© Franquin among his early favorites. Around 1980, having become an emerging established graphic novel artist who had made himself a name publishing in M√©tal Hurlant and creating a number of standalone albums, Schuiten began drafting a parallel world of vintage architectural splendor reflecting his childhood memories of Brussels, a world which can be reached primarily through remaining buildings of these times gone by. In an ongoing attempt to prevent the spread of knowledge of this parallel world, mostly faceless authorities in our world increasingly have these buildings torn down, and in Schuiten's world this was the true reason for chaotic, headless Bruxellisation where functional and organic buildings were destroyed in favor of ill-planned, useless, and confusing structures such as ill-planned roads, detours, freeways, and anonymous office buildings that destroyed the organic fabric of a city and resulted in dysfunctional traffic and living routines. Approaching his friend Peeters, who by now had become a comic writer, about this imaginary world, Peeters infused his own philosophical ideas into plot lines he developed for the project, and in 1982 the first Les Cit√©s obscures album, Les murailles de Samaris, began publication as a serial in the Franco-Belgian comics magazine √Ä Suivre. Requiring a few revised editions of the early albums, the basic tenets and elements of Le monde obscure were laid down since the late 1980s.  Influences  Various commentators, as well as Schuiten himself, have identified visual and theme influences in Les Cit√©s obscures from as diverse works as those by Jules Verne, Winsor McCay, Franz Kafka, Ren√© Magritte, Giovanni Battista Piranesi, Victor Horta, Henry Fuseli, and Jean-L√©on G√©r√¥me. Books in the Cit√©s obscures series The stories of the cit√©s obscures appear in a series of graphic novels and related books, published by Casterman.

Another book Schuiten and Peeters collaborated on in reference to Les Cit√©s obscures is Les Portes du Possible (2005). Counter-earth The world (or \\"continent\\", according to the authors) of the Cit√©s obscures forms a disparate grouping of cities located on a \\"counter-Earth\\", which is invisible from our Earth because it is situated exactly opposite it on the other side of the Sun. Still, travel between the two worlds is possible by means of \\"gates\\" (portes) called Obscure Passages, which are mostly to be found in buildings and constructions similar or identical to each other on both planets, whereas the distinct architectural style of a structure makes it a potential candidate to harbor an Obscure Passage to an Obscure City whose distinct style it resembles. It is not uncommon for some Earthlings and inhabitants of the Cit√©s obscures to actually come across each other (among the most notable of these travelers may be noted Jules Verne, a recurring personage in the series). On websites such as Web of the Obscure Cities (which is no longer online but is documented on AltaPlana.be, an online encyclopaedia for Obscure Cities) and Office of the Obscure Passages, Schuiten and Peeters present alleged reports, often illustrated with photos and drawings, from people that shortly crossed over into the world of the Obscure Cities via Obscure Passages by accident, and by so-called Obscurantists who have been seeking for Obscure Passages for years (compare Obscurantist, a term based upon the Epistol√¶ Obscurorum Virorum, aka \\"Letters of Obscure Men\\"). These reports on the internet correspond to the pseudorealism of Schuiten and Peeters when enclosing \\"authentic\\" documentary or amateur CDs (Le Mus√©e A. Desombres, 1990) or DVDs (L'affaire Desombres, 2002) to their print publications regarding the Obscure Cities.  Taxandria  Beno√Æt Peeters had collaborated with director Raoul Servais before on a documentary entitled Servaisgraphia on Servais's unique animation style that was released in 1992. Subsequently, there is a loose connection between the increasingly multimedia series of the Obscure Cities and the Belgian fantasy film Taxandria (1994) directed by Servais (starring, among others, Armin Mueller-Stahl), where Schuiten served as production designer. In the Obscure Cities series, at times characters refer to the vanished city-state of Taxandria which was accidentally removed from the planet during a failed scientific experiment. A common theme in steampunk-influenced Les Cit√©s obscures, Taxandrian clothing and technology appear to resemble Victorian times on our earth, Taxandria's architecture is reminiscent of Schuiten's trademark phantasmagorical architectural fantasies, and another feature the film shares with Les Cit√©s obscures is a bloated absurd, Kafkaesque bureaucracy. It is however under dispute among fans of the series whether Taxandria is truly one of the Obscure Cities due to a perceived appearance of a light-hearted children's fantasy movie to Servais's film. A reinterpreting graphic novel adaptation of the movie Taxandria was published by Schuiten and Peeters one year prior to the film's official release under the title Souvenirs de l'Eternel Pr√©sent: Variation sur le Film Taxandria de Raoul Servais (Arboris, 1993, , ), also including production background information on the film.  Multimedia  Schuiten and Peeters increasingly seek to transcend their world of the Obscure Cities from graphic novels into other media to create an entire universe, even though their comic albums remain the core foundation of Schuiten and Peeters's emerging multimedia franchise.  Books, CDs, films  This trend for multimedia expansion began with the book Le Myst√®re d'Urbicande (1985) which marked the series' acquiring a life of its own and whereby Schuiten and Peeters began to realize the true potential of their concept. Written by Belgian author and Obscure fan Thierry Smolderen (under the pseudonym Professeur R. de Brok),Series overview on A comprehensive review of the Obscure Cities series for English-speaking fans Le Myst√®re d'Urbicande purports to be a scientific essay bent to debunk the events of La fi√®vre d'Urbicande, heavily annotated in emotional handwriting by Eugen Rodick, the main character of La fi√®vre d'Urbicande who is now locked up in Br√ºsel's Sixth Hospice, the city's mental asylum. Schuiten contributed the book's illustrations under the pen-name Robert Louis Marie de la Barque (whereas the French word barque, meaning barge or rowboat in English, translates to schuiten in Dutch). Drafting and developing stages of the above- mentioned film Taxandria and its accompanying graphic novel adaptation began between Schuiten and Peeters as early as 1988. In 1990, the development was further explored with Le Mus√©e A. Desombres, an audio CD with a small booklet drawn by Schuiten, purporting to be an exhibition catalogue of paintings by Auguste Desombres, an artist living in our world in the late 19th century. The CD contains an audio play that is partly a fake report from Desombres's first exhibition, partly chronicles Desombres crossing over into the world of the Obscure Cities by accident by means of his own exhibition. In 2002, Schuiten and Peeters published the DVD L'affaire Desombres, a sequel to Le Mus√©e A. Desombres. A setting of La fi√®vre d'Urbicande, cult album in the Obscure Cities series, appears in the 2012 Canadian science fiction movie Mars et Avril by Martin Villeneuve, based on the graphic novels of the same name. As a matter of fact, Fran√ßois Schuiten agreed to have a 3D model made out of his futuristic auditorium, for a scene taking place inside the Temple of Cosmologists. The director had this image in mind when writing his books, a few years before Schuiten joined the team as production designer. Before the shooting, even the extras were chosen to look like the characters in the comic book.Mars et Avril on Alta-Plana  Urbicande.be  In 1996, Urbicande.be, the official website of the Obscure Cities went online where Schuiten and Peeters encouraged their fans all over Europe to send in their own ideas regarding the Obscure Cities and accounts of their own experiences in search for Obscure Passages. The response was so overwhelming that Schuiten and Peeters were able to expand their online activities into a complex network of in-universe sites, mainly branching from the URL ebbs.net of their official Obscure magazine called Obsk√ºr, where many amateur reports, illustrated by photos and Schuiten's drawings, and various mysterious Obscure artifacts can be found. Along with these, a number of conspiracy theories are explored, regarding authorities of our world intending to prevent the spread of knowledge regarding the parallel world and destroy various Obscure Passages. In May 2015, Urbicande.be was taken offlineAs stated in the entry for Urbicande.be in the official online encyclopaedia for Obscure Cities at AltaPlana.be and archived at AltaPlana.be, an official online encyclopaedia of the Obscure Cities universe.  La maison Autrique  After having colorfully satirized the destructive modernizing fad of Bruxellisation in the Les Cit√©s obscures album Br√ºsel in 1992, Schuiten and Peeters convinced the community of Schuiten's childhood district Schaerbeek to acquire one of the last remaining buildings in Brussels built by Art Nouveau architect Horta, La maison Autrique, and in 1999 opened a permanent pseudo-documentary exhibition inside, regarding the Obscure Cities, 19th century Art Nouveau Brussels, and detailing its ongoing Bruxellisation destruction during the 20th century, tying in with aforementioned conspiracy theories whereby Bruxellisation is supposed to be an attempt by the authorities to destroy a number of Obscure Passages situated in Brussels. In 2004, Schuiten and Peeters published the illustrated book La Maison Autrique: M√©tamorphose d'une maison Art Nouveau (published as Maison Autrique - Metamorphosis of an Art Nouveau House in English) about the building, its restoration during the 1990s, and Horta's life and work. Also, their latest Les Cit√©s obscures two-part graphic novel album La Th√©orie du grain de sable (2007; 2008) deals with the maison Autrique.

Although plans for a highway connecting Hamilton to Fort Erie south of the Niagara Escarpment have surfaced for decades, it was not until The Niagara Frontier International Gateway Study was published by the Ministry of Transportation of Ontario (MTO) in 1998 that serious examination and planning began. The study called for an alternative route to the QEW, which runs through tender fruitlands and is not capable of expansion beyond its current configuration. The land on which studies are being performed for this future freeway is referred to as the Mid-Peninsula Corridor or the Niagara-GTA Corrdior.  Route description  As proposed, the Mid-Peninsula Highway would connect Highway 403 in Hamilton with a twinned Peace Bridge in Fort Erie. North of Hamilton, it would curve and meet Highway 407 or Highway 401 north of Burlington. The entire freeway would be above the Niagara Escarpment in consideration of the wine-producing fruitlands that lie at its base; a consideration that was ignored during the construction of the QEW despite the protests of farmers. Connections with the southward extension of Highway 406 would be provided near Welland, as well as with the controlled- access section of Highway 6 north of Caledonia, where the freeway would pass near John C. Munro Hamilton International Airport. The majority of the route west of the Welland Canal would travel north of the former Highway 20.  Future  The successive Ontario Conservative governments of Premiers Mike Harris and Ernie Eves planned to forego a full environmental assessment of the freeway after a study indicated an urgent need for its construction. The Niagara Frontier International Gateway Study was published by the MTO in 1998 and indicated that the freeway was of vital importance. Prior to this study, various proposals for a freeway above the Niagara Escarpment had surfaced for several decades, though no serious examination of its merits was undertaken. However, with the election of the Liberal government under Dalton McGuinty in 2003, a formal study was initiated. After developing the Growth Plan for the Greater Golden Horseshoe, the McGuinty government launched a new Niagara to GTA corridor environmental assessment to study transportation needs in the corridor. A draft Transportation Development Study to consider alternative or complementary infrastructure to a freeway was completed in February 2011. The study recommended the routing be split into three groups, with route planning to commence for the eastern portion, further corridor study in the western portion and to halt but otherwise continue monitoring needs for a new transportation link in the central portion. As a result of the study, the Regional Municipality of Niagara has initiated an environmental assessment to identify and design a new 400-series highway freeway Highway 406 and the QEW, forming the eastern portion of the Mid-Peninsula Highway. Corridor planning has the support of the provincial government.

The Marion Branch (former Newark & Marion Railway) was operated to serve cold storage warehouses, packing operations and a fertilizer dealer in Marion. Declining traffic and poor track conditions led to the end of its operation in July 1984. During 1982 and 1983, a dinner train operation was operated out of Webster using privately owned equipment and OMID crews.

Early life and career Cooper was born in Liverpool, the daughter of deaf parents. She was educated at St Oswald's Roman Catholic Primary School, Old Swan, Bellerive Convent Grammar School, and the University of Liverpool. Cooper originally worked for a company called W. Cooper Ltd from 1973 to 1980, before joining Littlewoods initially as a buyer when, in 1994, she became the public relations manager and then, in 1995, the group corporate communications manager. She became a project coordinator in 1999, before she left Littlewoods in 2001, when she was appointed director at the Merseyside Centre for the Deaf. She was a member of the Liverpool Health Authority and held the position of vice chair between 1994 and 1996. In 1996, she became Chair of Liverpool Women's Hospital. She has also acted as a trustee of the Roy Castle Lung Cancer Foundation. Liberal to Labour Cooper was elected, aged 22, to the Liverpool City Council as a Liberal councillor in 1973 and, in 1992, became the Lord Mayor of Liverpool; she stood down from the city council in 2000. She fought her first Westminster campaign at the 1983 General Election when she was selected to contest the Conservative-held seat of Liverpool Garston as a Liberal. She finished in third place, with more than 14,000 votes behind the winner, Labour's Eddie Loyden. Next, Cooper contested the 1986 Knowsley North by-election, caused by the resignation of the Labour MP Robert Kilroy-Silk to become a television presenter. At the by-election, Labour retained the seat with George Howarth gaining a comfortable margin of 6,724 votes; when Cooper contested the seat again a few months later at the 1987 General Election she finished 21,098 votes behind Howarth. At the 1992 General Election, now a Liberal Democrat, she was back in her native Liverpool, coming second at Liverpool Broadgreen 7,027 votes behind Labour's Jane Kennedy, but ahead of the former deselected Labour MP Terry Fields. From 1973 to 1996, Cooper was councillor for the Broadgreen ward. From 1996 to 2000, Cooper represented the Allerton ward, before in 1999 she switched to the Labour Party, and stood in Netherly ward in 2000. She contested the European Parliament elections in 2004 for Labour in the North West. Parliamentary career Cooper became the Labour Party's candidate from an all-female short list, in the constituency of West Lancashire at the 2005 General Election, following the retirement of the sitting MP Colin Pickthall. Cooper was first elected to the House of Commons at her fifth attempt and third party with a majority of 6,084. She made her maiden speech on 24 May 2005.Hansard, 24 May 2005 In September 2005, Cooper, as part of the Labour Friends of Israel, made an official research visit to Israel. In September 2020, she was appointed a vice-chair of Labour Friends of Israel. Since 2005, she has been a member of the Northern Ireland Affairs Committee, and was part of the successful campaign that stopped the merger of the Southport and Ormskirk hospitals. In June 2006, she became Parliamentary Private Secretary to Lord Rooker, a Minister at the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs. On 9 August 2006, The Daily Telegraph wrote that Cooper had written to the Prime Minister's office reporting the viewpoint of some of her constituents expressed to her, that they would be appalled if Baroness Thatcher were to be given a state funeral, as a leader more politically divisive than others of the late twentieth century.\\"Blair attacked over veto on state funeral for Lady Thatcher\\".

She is a member of the All-Party Parliamentary Health Select Committee. In August 2013, she became one of the few Labour MPs to vote against the Marriage (Same Sex Couples) Bill, which eventually passed with cross-party support.George Eaton, \\"Labour and Lib Dem MPs who voted against gay marriage: full list\\", New Statesman, 6 February 2013.

He was made a Knight-Grand-Cross of the Order of St Michael and St George (GCMG) on his appointment. A freemason, he was also Grand-Master of the United Grand Lodge of South Australia during his term as Governor (1889-1895). He arrived with his family at Adelaide in South Australia on 11 April 1889 aboard the Orient and was formally welcomed by the administrator, Chief Justice Samuel Way, who later resigned as Grand Master of the United Grand Lodge of South Australia in his favour. Later life In early 1901 he was asked by King Edward to take part in a special diplomatic mission to announce the King's accession to the governments of Denmark, Sweden and Norway, Russia, Germany, and Saxony. He was also a Knight of Grand-Cross of the Order of the Crown of Italy of Italy, a 1st Class of the Order of the Red Eagle of Prussia, a Grand- Cross of the Military Order of Our Lord Jesus Christ of Portugal and a Grand- Cross of the Order of the Polar Star of Sweden. In 1911, Kintore was presented with a royal gift cigarette case by Prince Ferdinand of Bavaria (1884-1958). A century later, the gift featured in the Christie's London sale, SALE 7970 ‚ÄîIMPORTANT JEWELS held on 8 June 2011. Death He died on 3 March 1930 aged 77 at 10 Park Place, St James Street, London, of acute bronchitis and periurethral abscess and interred on 7 March 1930 at Keith Hall, Inverurie, Aberdeen. He was survived by his wife, two sons and two daughters. Family Lord Kintore married Lady Sydney Charlotte Montagu (14 October 1851 - Keith Hall, Inverurie, Aberdeen, 21 September 1932), second daughter of George Montagu, 6th Duke of Manchester, at St George's, Hanover Square, London, on 14 August 1873. He was succeeded on the earldom by his second but only surviving son, Arthur. Kintore's daughter Lady Ethel Sydney Keith-Falconer, wife of John Baird, 1st Viscount Stonehaven, eventually inherited the earldom. Legacy Localities named for Earl Kintore include: * Mt Kintore and the Kintore Range, Northern Territory - named by William Tietkens during his expedition of 1889 * The town of Kintore, Northern Territory in the Kintore Range * Kintore, Western Australia, now a ghost town, established in 1897 near Kalgoorlie.

EMS was an intermediate technology, between SMS and MMS, providing some of the features of MMS. EMS was a technology designed to work with existing networks, but was ultimately made obsolete by MMS. An EMS-enabled mobile phone could send and receive messages that had special text formatting (such as bold or italic), animations, pictures, icons, sound effects and special ringtones. EMS messages sent to devices that did not support it would be displayed as SMS messages, though they may be unreadable due to the presence of additional data that cannot be rendered by the device. In some countries, EMS messages could not generally be sent between subscribers of different mobile phone carriers, as they will frequently be dropped by the inter-carrier network or by the receiving carrier. However, in other countries, such as the UK, inter-carrier interoperability was generally achieved. EMS never really picked up due to interoperability limitations and in fact very few operators ever introduced it. EMS is defined in 3GPP Technical Specification 3GPP TS 23.040 (originally GSM 03.40). On June 9, 2008, the CTIA organization officially released an RFI for Enhanced Messaging implementation with focus on Group Messaging.

The musical part was divided into a number of smaller parts, with each part featuring a performance from one specific artist, for example Asha Puthli in \\"Indian Stryx\\", Amanda Lear in Sexy Stryx or Grace Jones in Rumstryx. The show was produced in the disco era, therefore this genre dominates the musical background of Stryx. The show caused many controversies in more conservative societies, mainly because of its devilish theme and referring to underworld as well as exposing nudity. Due to numerous protests the show was taken off the broadcast and the production of following episodes was cancelled.

It provides access to the St Gotthard Pass. Enclosed by sheer granite walls, its road and railway require several spectacular bridges and tunnels, of which the most famous is a stone bridge known as the Teufelsbr√ºcke (\\"Devil's Bridge\\"). Geology The lower Urseren marks the boundary of the Aar massif with the autochthonous sediment of the Gotthard nappe (\\"Urseren-Zone\\"). In Altkirch quarry, on the southern end of the gorge, Triassic and Jurassic sediments are exposed. In the Sch√∂llenen Gorge (at the Urnerloch tunnel), the Reuss enters the cristalline Aar massif (Aar granite), the gorge itself being an exemplary late alpine fluvial Water gap.Aaregranit in der Sch√∂llenen und gotthardmassivische Sedimente, G√©otope suisse n¬∞302 (2012). History=Early history Modern illustration of the Tw√§rrenbr√ºcke (Theodor Barth, 1919), reflecting the unhistorical (but widely repeated) tradition describing it as supported by chains. The name of the gorge is from Rumantsch *scalinae (\\"stairs, steps\\"); recorded in German as Schellenden in 1420.the modern spelling in √∂ is a hypercorrection based on the phonology of the dialect of Uri, as in G√∂schenen < *cascina. It is unclear whether the -d- in the forms Schellenden, Geschenden is anaptyctic or if it represents a Rumantsch suffix complex *-ione-ata- (as it were *skal-ion-ata- > *skalinda > schellenden; RN 2,1033). A popular etymology connecting German schellen \\"to ring, resound\\" is reported by Brandstetter, 'Urseren', Vaterland 69 (1907). ortsnamen.ch It formed the upper limit of Alemannic settlement in the Alps prior to the 12th century, and the border between the bishoprics of Constance and Raetia Curensis. The gorge appears to have been passable by a difficult footpath by the mid-12th century. This path was forced to avoid the southern part of the gorge, taking a steep ascent from Br√ºggliwaldboden, climbing above 1,800 m before descending to Hospental via B√§zberg. The eponymous scalinae presumably referred to steps hewn into the rock to facilitate the ascent.\\"Die Wegbarmachung der Sch√∂llenen musste sp√§testens in der ersten H√§lfte des 12. Jahrhunderts stattgefunden haben. Der Weg, der schon vor der Erschliessung der Sch√∂llenen begangen wurde, f√ºhrte √ºber den B√§tzberg. Von Hospental, welcher Name aus dem r√∂mischen Hospitium-Herberge herkommt, f√ºhrte der Weg √ºber die T√§nnlenbr√ºcke nach T√§nnlen, urkundlich ‚ÄπTenlon‚Ä∫ geheissen, und von da an der Lehne des B√§tzberges entlang nach dem heutigen Fort B√§tzberg. Beim Bau der dortigen Festungsanlagen stiess man auf ein gepfl√§stertes Teilst√ºck dieses Weges. Nun ging es leicht abw√§rts auf den sogenannten Br√ºckwaldboden und von da erfolgte der steile Anstieg durch die Felsen in die mittlere Sch√∂llenen. Um diesen Anstieg zu erm√∂glichen, war man gezwungen, Stufen in den Felsen zu hauen. Von diesen Stufen, lateinisch ‚Äπscalinae‚Ä∫, leitet sich ohne Zweifel das Wort Sch√∂llenen ab. Muheim, Strassenbau-Politik (1945), p. 24. The gorge was first opened up as a bridle path with the construction of a wooden bridge in the 1220s. This was of great strategic importance because it opened the Gotthard Pass, with historical consequences both regionally and to the Italian politics of the Holy Roman Empire.The construction of the bridle path dates to \\"the first third of the 13th century\\", most likely to 1225/6, certainly by 1230. The chapel to St Gotthard on the pass was consecrated in 1230. In 1231, Henry VII granted imperial immediacy to Uri in order to remove this now- important strategic asset from Habsburg influence. The first contemporary account of a crossing of the pass dates to 1236 (Albert of Stade). By 1237, there was a hospice and substantial traffic.Egli, Emil, 'Der St. Gotthard : Bedeutung und Auswirkungen', Geographica Helvetica 46 (1991), 60-66. The original bridle path across Sch√∂llenen was realised by means of a wooden ledger attached to the rock wall, known as Tw√§rrenbr√ºcke, and a wooden bridge across the gorge, recorded as stiebende Brugge (\\"spray bridge\\") in 1306. The Tw√§rrenbr√ºcke (from twer \\"across, athwart\\"Alois Kocher, Der alte St. Gotthardweg: Verlauf, Umgehung, Unterhalt (1951), p. 84) rested on beams laid across the gorge. A tradition imagining it as supported by hanging chains developed only after its collapse in the 18th century.Helmut Stalder, Mythos Gotthard: was der Pass bedeutet, Orell F√ºssli (2003), p. 29. Noch zu Anfang dieses Sekulums hieng eine h√∂lzerne Br√ºcke in Ketten, auf welcher man um den Felsen herum kam\\" (Hans Rudolf Schinz, 1783). The technology associated with the construction of the Tw√§rrenbr√ºcke is attributed to the Walser, who are known to have begun settlement in Urseren still in the 12th century.\\"Die Baumeister und -herren dieses Wegs sind unbekannt, jedoch ist eine Beteiligung der seit dem 12. Jh. in Ursern sesshaften Walser wahrscheinlich.\\" (Stadler 2011) 16th-century historiography attributes the construction of the bridge to one Heini (Heinrich), blacksmith in G√∂schenen. Robert Schedler published a historical novel surrounding the construction of the Sch√∂llenen bridle path, Der Schmied von G√∂schenen, in 1919.  Devil's Bridge legend  Detail from Johann Jakob Scheuchzer's Nova Helvetiae Tabula Geographica 1712, showing the holy man preventing the Devil from hurling the rock (illustration by Johann Melchior F√ºssli). In Early Modern Switzerland, a legend developed which attributed the construction of the bridge to the Devil. This is a motif attached to numerous old bridges in Europe (see Devil's Bridge for a comparative account). The name Teiffels Brucken (\\"Devil's Bridge\\", modern German: Teufelsbr√ºcke) is first recorded in 1587.in 1574 recorded as quo loco pons est quem Satanae aut inferni pontem nominant Simler, Vallesiae Descriptio, p. 102. The 1587 reference is Ryff, Reissbiechlin: Do kompt man stracks unversechens zuo des Teiffels Brucken, al Ponto Dilfernno genant. Dz ist ein solliche Brucken, die hoch ob dem Wasser mit einem eintzigen Bogen oder Gwelb von einem Felsen in den anderen gebauwen ist. Und diewyl dann dis Ort (= Raum Teufelsbr√ºcke) eng und rings herumb mit hochen glatten Felsen umbringet und die Wasser also rouschen und stieben, so haben die Landleut Infernno, die Hell, und die Brucken El Ponto Dilferno, die Hellbrucken oder des Teuffelsbrucken, genent.. The legend is related by Johann Jakob Scheuchzer (1716). According to Scheuchzer, he was told a local legend according to which the people of Uri recruited the Devil for the difficult task of building the bridge. The Devil requested to receive the first thing to pass the bridge in exchange for his help. To trick the Devil, who expected to receive the soul of the first man to pass the bridge, the people of Uri sent across a dog by throwing a piece of bread, and the dog was promptly torn to pieces by the Devil. Enraged at having been tricked the Devil went to fetch a large rock to smash the bridge, but, carrying the rock back to the bridge, he came across a holy man who \\"scolded him\\" (der ihn bescholten) and forced him to drop the rock, which could still be seen on the path below G√∂schenen.Johann Jakob Scheuchzer, Naturgeschichte des Schweitzerlandes vol. 2 (1747 [1716]), p. 94. A modern retelling was published by Meinrad Lienert, Schweizer Sagen und Heldengeschichten (1915). According to Lienert's version, a goat was sent across the bridge instead of a dog, and instead of the holy man, the Devil, when he was taking a break exhausted from carrying the rock, came across an old woman who marked the rock with a cross, forcing the Devil to abandon it and flee. The legend does not appear to have existed before the 16th century, and its origin in local tradition is uncertain. Lauf-Belart (1924) surmised that the name Teufelsbr√ºcke was originally due to an erroneous interpretation by learned travellers, which only in the 17th century gave rise to the local legend involving the Devil.\\"Ich bin √ºberzeugt, dass der Name Teufelsbr√ºcke ein literarischer Name ist, der von Gelehrten der Br√ºcke gegeben worden und ins Volk gedrungen ist und der die allgemein verbreitete Sage vom Teufel als Baumeister nach sich gezogen und hier lokalisiert hat. Um die Wende vom 16. zum 17. Jahrhundert mag diese Wandlung vor sich gegangen sein. Denn noch 1595 heisst die Br√ºcke in Urseren Stiebende, in der Literatur aber (vereinzelt ja schon Ende des 15. Jahrhunderts) Teufelsbr√ºcke allgemein, bis durch die Historiker um die Wende zum 19. Jahrhundert der alte Name wieder ausgegraben wurde. Bis tief in die zweite H√§lfte desselben blieb die richtige Ansicht vorherrschend, dass es zwei Namen f√ºr dasselbe Ding seien. Da wurde auf dem Umweg √ºber Deutschland der Irrtum eines z√ºrcherischen Reiseschriftstellers, der den Namen Stiebende Br√ºcke auf einen etwas eigenartig gebauten, sonst aber ganz harmlosen Steg bezog, zum Dogma erhoben, also dass dieser Steg unversehens Weltber√ºhmtheit erhielt.\\" Lauf-Belart, Gotthardpass, 1924 p. 165f. thumbContemporary situation of the Teufelsstein ( ; 2006 photograph) The Devil's Stone (Teufelsstein) is a large block of granite near G√∂schenen, with a height of c. 12 m and a mass of c. 220 tons. In 1887, it was sold to the Maestrani Schweizer Schokoladenfabrik for 80 francs. Painted yellow, it now served as an advertisement for chocolate. In 1923, there were plans to demolish it, but it was preserved on the initiative of Max Oechslin, president of Naturforschende Gesellschaft Uri. In 1970, the Devil's Stone was again scheduled for destruction, to make way for the N2 motorway. This time, there was a broad movement to preserve it, and in 1971, federal authorities agreed to move the stone, with projected costs of 250,000 francs (of which the canton of Uri was to contribute 7,000). This led to a popular campaign opposing the plan because the cost was seen as excessive. The liberal newspaper Gotthard- Post proposed to spend the money on the construction of a retirement home instead, collecting 1,000 signatures in support. The cantonal government now argued that there was no legal basis for the destruction of the stone because it had been the property of Naturforschende Gesellschaft Uri since 1925. On 1 September 1972, the Federal Council finally agreed to moving the stone, and it was moved 127 metres in an operation costing CHF 335,000.Tyfelsbrigg, Freilichtspiele Andermatt (2013), p. 28 It is now situated on the ramp of exit 40 (G√∂schenen) of the motorway, at the entrance of Gotthard Road Tunnel, visible both from the railway and from the motorway. Early modern history View of the Urnerloch tunnel (Salomon Gessner, 1781) Construction of the second bridge, Karl Blechen (c. 1833) The wooden bridge Stiebender Steg was replaced by a stone bridge in 1595, which came to be known as Devil's Bridge (Teufelsbr√ºcke). On St Patrick's Day (17 March) 1608 Hugh O'Neill, Earl of Tyrone was fleeing the English with 98 of his fellow-Gaels when, crossing the Devil's Bridge, one of the horses carrying his fortune plunged into the torrent below; the horse was recovered, but not the gold, which was lost in the raging torrent. A new road, including a tunnel with a length c. 60 m,the length of the Urnerloch is variously reported as 58 m, 61 m or 64 m. replacing the Tw√§rrenbr√ºcke was built in 1707/8. The tunnel, known as Urnerloch, was the first road tunnel to be built in the Alps. It was constructed by Pietro Morettini (1660-1737). Following its construction, the Tw√§rrenbr√ºcke was no longer maintained and allowed to collapse. H. R. Schinzin in 1783 mentions another bridge, marking the border between Uri and Urseren, known as Mittelbr√ºcke or Tanzenbein.H. R. Schinz, Beitr√§ge zur n√§hern Kenntniss des Schweizerlandes p. 29. In 1799, it was the site of one of the most dramatic battles of Suvorov's Italian and Swiss expedition during the Napoleonic Wars. The bridge was heavily damaged by the retreating French army. As a result, the route's trade with Italy shifted to the Spl√ºgenpass. The Suvorov monument, just south of the Devil's Bridge, was commissioned by the Russian Empire in 1899. Modern engineering Sch√∂llenenbahn railway bridge and tunnel A replacement cut stone bridge was planned and executed by Karl Emanuel M√ºller (1804-1869), the cantonal engineer in charge of the stretch of the new Gotthard road between G√∂schenen and Hospental. Construction took 10 years, and was the subject of a famous painting by Karl Blechen in 1830-32. The new bridge allowed (single-lane) motorized traffic, opening the Gotthard Pass to automobiles. The 1595 bridge fell out of use after the completion of the second bridge in 1830, and it collapsed in 1888. The Gotthard railway project of 1872 avoided the Sch√∂llenen Gorge by building the Gotthard Rail Tunnel under it, but the Sch√∂llenenbahn, a rack railway, was built through the gorge in 1917. The modern road bridge and tunnel date to 1958. It served as the main road across the Central Alps during the 1960s and 1970s, but since the construction of the Gotthard Road Tunnel in 1980 it has only been of regional importance, connecting Uri with canton of Valais and the Surselva.

Forty-eight people from two coach tour parties had elected an optional side event of canyoning. It was organized by Adventure World, a now defunct company located in Wilderswil, not far from Saxeten. At , flash floods began pouring through the gorge and 21 people within the group were swept to their deaths; 18 were tourists and three were canyon guides. By 7 pm, the stories had hit the world news, and the hotels they were staying in were bombarded with phone calls, but the staff knew only what they saw on television. The survivors were rescued and then questioned by Swiss Police before being released and returned to their hotel at the next morning. Until then they had no idea how many people had died nor the enormity of the disaster. Identifying the dead bodies was a serious problem for the Swiss authorities as the bodies were badly traumatized. Eleven survivors agreed to go to the mortuary to identify the dead, but many victims had to be identified through DNA and dental analysis. Families were desperate to see for themselves what had happened, and Swissair along with Swiss medical services provided meet and greet sessions for families, and also much counseling for those who had been present. Bodies of the dead washed up in Lake Brienz, a popular boating lake, during peak summer tourist season. The bodies were mostly pulled out of the lake by young Dutch tourists who stayed at the nereby campsite. This particular group was going to join an adventure world rafting or canyoning trip this same day, but decided not to go at the last moment. Since the incident, the press reported many rumors about what happened. Emergency services claim they sent someone to tell the group of the impending storms, and families of the dead claim that the company should have seen the signs of the weather. Swiss authorities were quick to blame profit- seeking and general negligence as the cause of the accident. After the disaster, Adventure World went out of business. Their former premises, near the Wilderswil Station, are now occupied by a bank. In 2001, some of the staff at Adventure World were charged in connection with the deaths. A total of six staff members were found guilty of manslaughter through culpable negligence and given suspended sentences of between two and five months and fined between 4,000 and 7,500 CHF.

An Australian international and New South Wales State of Origin representative , Lazarus won premierships with the Canberra Raiders, Brisbane Broncos and Melbourne Storm, who he also captained. He is the only player in the history of the game to win grand finals with three separate clubs, with the grand final wins also being the first for each club. After his retirement from football he assisted several NRL clubs in a coaching capacity. In the 2013 federal election, Lazarus was elected to the Australian Senate for the state of Queensland as the lead Queensland candidate for the Palmer United Party (PUP). He became PUP Senate leader at the commencement of his term on 1 July 2014. He quit PUP on 13 March 2015 citing issues with its leader Clive Palmer, and established his own political party, the Glenn Lazarus Team. He did not retain his seat in the 2016 federal election. Education Lazarus was born in Queanbeyan, New South Wales. He attended Queanbeyan South Primary School and Karabar High School, Queanbeyan. He excelled at swimming and football, both Australian rules and especially rugby league. Rugby league career Lazarus achieved a formidable reputation in prop forward position at club, state (NSW), and international levels. He was the first player in the history of the game to win premierships with three clubs: Canberra Raiders, Brisbane Broncos and Melbourne Storm. Lazarus was also named Players' Player for two consecutive Kangaroo Tours: 1990 and 1994. In addition, Lazarus scored the first rugby league try at the Melbourne Cricket Ground during a State of Origin game. Canberra Lazarus began his first-grade career with the Canberra Raiders in 1987, and was selected to make his debut for New South Wales in the 1989 State of Origin series. He played a starring role in the club's victory over the Balmain Tigers in the 1989 grand final. He travelled with the Raiders to England for the 1989 World Club Challenge, which was lost to Widnes. Lazarus played in the Raiders' victory over the Penrith Panthers in the 1990 grand final. At the end of the 1990 NSWRL season, he went on the 1990 Kangaroo tour of Great Britain and France. He also played for Canberra in their grand final loss to Penrith in 1991. Brisbane In the summer preceding the 1992 season, Lazarus was recruited from Canberra by his former coach at the Raiders, Wayne Bennett and joined the Brisbane Broncos, with whom he played the largest portion of his career. During the 1992 Great Britain Lions tour of Australia and New Zealand, he helped Australia retain The Ashes. He played for the Broncos at prop forward in the 1992 grand final victory over the St. George Dragons, following which he travelled with the Broncos to England, where he played at prop forward in the 1992 World Club Challenge against British champions Wigan, helping Brisbane become the first NSWRL club to win the match in Britain. He then played for Australia at prop forward in the World Cup final victory over Great Britain at Wembley Stadium. Lazarus played for the Broncos at prop forward in the 1993 grand final victory again over the St. George Dragons. This constituted a remarkable feat of playing in five consecutive grand finals. During the 1994 NSWRL season, Lazarus played at prop forward for defending premiers Brisbane when they hosted British champions Wigan for the 1994 World Club Challenge and lost. In 1996, he captained the Broncos in a game against the Penrith Panthers due to Allan Langer being injured. He was selected to go on the 1994 Kangaroo Tour, where he was voted the Players' Player of the tour. It was only a broken (dislocated) ankle suffered during a 1997 World Club Championship match that prevented Lazarus from playing in that year's Super League grand-final-winning Brisbane side. Melbourne Lazarus was recruited to the newly established Melbourne Storm by his former CEO (John Ribot) and teammate (Chris Johns) from the Broncos, both then responsible for setting up and managing the growth of new club in Melbourne. Lazarus commenced with the club in its inaugural year, 1998 and was named as the club's first captain and also given a newspaper column to write in The Herald Sun. He went on to lead the Melbourne Storm at prop forward in their 1999 grand final victory. Lazarus announced his retirement from the game with five premierships for three clubs (Canberra 1989‚Äì90, Brisbane 1992‚Äì93 and Melbourne 1999). Post-playing In 2000, Lazarus was awarded the Australian Sports Medal for his contribution to Australia's international standing in rugby league. In 2003, he was one of the first four former players inducted into the Broncos' official Hall of Fame. In 2005, the western grandstand of Olympic Park Stadium was named the Glenn Lazarus stand in his honour. Lazarus spent many years coaching junior rugby league in Brisbane. He also assisted the Canberra Raiders and Brisbane Broncos in an assistant coaching capacity. In February 2008, Lazarus was named in the list of Australia's 100 Greatest Players (1908‚Äì2007), which was commissioned by the NRL and ARL to celebrate the code's centenary year in Australia. Lazarus has been 612 ABC Brisbane Breakfast rugby league tipster since 2008. In 2008 New South Wales announced their rugby league team of the century, naming Lazarus at prop. At the end of the 2008 Queensland Cup season, Lazarus, who served as assistant coach at the Ipswich Jets club under the departing Kevin Walters, was named as head coach of the club from the 2009 season. Lazarus was not re-appointed for 2011. Political career Lazarus was selected to head the Palmer United Party (PUP) Senate ticket in Queensland at the 2013 federal election and was elected on a 9.89 percent primary vote. He got to the required 14.3 percent quota from a favourable preferential tally from group voting tickets. His term as a PUP Senator commenced on 1 July 2014 and he became PUP Senate leader. He announced his resignation from PUP through Facebook on 13 March 2015 and became an independent Senator. He wrote: \\"I have a different view of team work. Given this, I felt it best that I resign from the party and pursue my senate role as an independent senator.\\" In May 2015, Lazarus announced his intention to form his own party. The party, Glenn Lazarus Team, was registered on 9 July 2015. Lazarus and the Glenn Lazarus Team were unsuccessful in the 2016 federal election and did not secure any seats in the Parliament. As this was a double dissolution election, Lazarus' Senate term ended on 2 July 2016. The party was voluntarily deregistered on 14 July 2017. Personal life Lazarus is married and has three children.

They lived between the Aucilla River and Ochlockonee River, at the head of Apalachee Bay, an area known to Europeans as the Apalachee Province. They spoke a Muskogean language called Apalachee, which is now extinct. The Apalachee occupied the site of Velda Mound starting about 1450 CE, but had mostly abandoned it when Spanish started settlements in the 17th century. They first encountered Spanish explorers in 1528, when the Narv√°ez expedition arrived. Traditional tribal enemies, European diseases, and European encroachment severely reduced their population. The survivors dispersed, and over time many Apalachee integrated with other groups, particularly the Creek Confederacy, while others relocated to other Spanish territories, and some remained in what is now Louisiana. About 300 descendants in Rapides and Natchitoches parishes assert an Apalachee identity today.  Culture  The Apalachee spoke the Apalachee language, a Muskogean language which became extinct. It was documented by Spanish settlers in letters written during the Spanish Colonial period. Around 1100 indigenous peoples began to cultivate crops. Agriculture was important in the area that became the Apalachee domain. It was part of the Fort Walton Culture, a Florida culture influenced by the Mississippian culture. With agriculture, the people could grow surplus crops, which enabled them to settle in larger groups, increase their trading for raw materials and finished goods, and specialize in production of artisan goods. At the time of Hernando de Soto's visit in 1539‚Äì1540, the Apalachee capital was Anhaica (present-day Tallahassee, Florida). The Apalachee lived in villages of various size, or on individual farmsteads of or so. Smaller settlements might have a single earthwork mound and a few houses. Larger towns (50 to 100 houses) were chiefdoms. They were organized around earthwork mounds built over decades for ceremonial, religious and burial purposes. Villages and towns were often situated by lakes, as the natives hunted fish and used the water for domestic needs and transport. The largest Apalachee community was at Lake Jackson, just north of present-day Tallahassee. This regional center had several mounds and 200 or more houses. Some of the surviving mounds are protected in Lake Jackson Mounds Archaeological State Park, The Apalachee grew numerous varieties of corn, pumpkins and sunflowers. They gathered wild strawberries, the roots and shoots of the greenbrier vine, greens such as lambsquarters, the roots of one or more unidentified aquatic plants used to make flour, hickory nuts, acorns, saw palmetto berries and persimmons. They caught fish and turtles in the lakes and rivers, and oysters and fish on the Gulf Coast. They hunted deer, black bears, rabbits, and ducks. The Apalachee were part of an expansive trade network that extended from the Gulf Coast to the Great Lakes, and westward to what is now Oklahoma. The Apalachee acquired copper artifacts, sheets of mica, greenstone, and galena from distant locations through this trade. The Apalachee probably paid for such imports with shells, pearls, shark teeth, preserved fish and sea turtle meat, salt, and cassina leaves and twigs (used to make the black drink). The Apalachee made tools from stone, bone and shell. They made pottery, wove cloth and cured buckskin. They built houses covered with palm leaves or the bark of cypress or poplar trees. They stored food in pits in the ground lined with matting, and smoked or dried food on racks over fires. (When Hernando de Soto seized the Apalachee town of Anhaico in 1539, he found enough stored food to feed his 600 men and 220 horses for five months.) The Apalachee men wore a deerskin loincloth. The women wore a skirt made of Spanish moss or other plant fibers. The men painted their bodies with red ochre and placed feathers in their hair when they prepared for battle. The men smoked tobacco in ceremonial rituals, including ones for healing. The Apalachee scalped opponents whom they killed, exhibiting the scalps as signs of warrior ability. Taking a scalp was a means of entering the warrior class, and was celebrated with a scalp dance. The warriors wore headdresses made of bird beaks and animal fur. The village or clan of a slain warrior was expected to avenge his death. Ball game The Apalachee played a ball game, sometimes known as the \\"Apalachee ball game\\", described in detail by Spaniards in the 17th century. The fullest description,Available in English translation at http://earlyfloridalit.net/?page_id=59, retrieved 6/5/2015. however, was written as part of a campaign by Father Juan de Paiva, priest at the mission of San Luis de Talimali, to have the game banned, and some of the practices described may have been exaggerated. The game was embedded in ritual practices which Father Paiva regarded as heathen superstitions. He was also concerned about the effect of community involvement in the games on the welfare of the villages and Spanish missions. In particular, he worried about towns being left defenseless against raiders when inhabitants left for a game, and that field work was being neglected during game season. Other missionaries (and the visiting Bishop of Cuba) had complained about the game, but most of the Spanish (including, initially, Father Pavia) liked it (and, most likely, the associated gambling). At least, they defended it as a custom that should not be disturbed, and that helped keep the Apalachee happy and willing to work in the fields. The Apalachee themselves said that the game was \\"as ancient as memory\\", and that they had \\"no other entertainment ... or relief from ... misery\\".Bushnell:5, 6‚Äì15 No indigenous name for the game has been preserved. The Spanish referred to it as el juego de la pelota, \\"the ballgame.\\" The game involved kicking a small, hard ball against a single goalpost. The same game was also played by the western Timucua, and was as significant among them as it was among the Apalachee.Hann, John H. (1996) A History of the Timucua Indians and Missions, pp. 107‚Äì111. University Press of Florida. . A related but distinct game was played by the eastern Timucua; Ren√© Goulaine de Laudonni√®re recorded seeing this played by the Saturiwa of what is now Jacksonville, Florida in 1564. Goalposts similar to those used by the Apalachee were also seen in the Coosa chiefdom of present-day in Alabama during the 16th century, suggesting that similar ball games were played across much of the region.Bushnell:5 A village would challenge another village to a game, and the two villages would then negotiate a day and place for the match. After the Spanish missions were established, the games usually took place on a Sunday afternoon, from about noon until dark. The two teams kicked a small ball (not much bigger than a musket ball), made by wrapping buckskin around dried mud, trying to hit the goalpost. The single goalpost was triangular, flat, and taller than it was wide, on a long post (Bushnell described it, based on a drawing in a Spanish manuscript, as \\"like a tall, flat Christmas tree with a long trunk\\"). There were snail shells, a nest and a stuffed eagle on top of the goalpost. Benches, and sometimes arbors to shade them, were placed at the edges of the field for the two teams. Spectators gambled heavily on the games. As the Apalachee did not normally use money, their bets were made with personal goods.Bushnell:5‚Äì6 Each team consisted of 40 to 50 men. The best players were highly prized, and villages gave them houses, planted their fields for them, and overlooked their misdeeds in an effort to keep such players on their teams. Players scored one point if they hit the goalpost with the ball, and two points if the ball landed in the nest. Eleven points won the game. Play was rough: players would pile on fallen players, walk on them, kick them, including in the face, pull on arms and legs and stuff dirt in each other's mouths. Players were told to die before letting go of the ball. They would try to hide the ball in their mouths; other players would choke them or kick them in the stomach to force the ball out. Arms and legs were broken. Players laid out on the ground would be revived by a bucket of cold water. There were occasional deaths. According to Father Paiva, five games in a row had ended in riots.Bushnell:6‚Äì7, 9, 13, 15 The origin of the games was the subject of an elaborate mythology. The giving of challenges for a game and the erection of goalposts and players' benches involved rituals and ceremonies, \\"superstitions\\" and \\"sorceries,\\" in the view of Father Pavia. The Apalachee expanded the superstitions to include Christian elements; after losing two games in a row, one village decided that was because their mission church was closed during the games. Players also asked priests to make the sign of the cross over pileups during a game.Bushnell:10-2, 13‚Äì4, 15 History The Apalachee had a relatively dense population and a complex, highly stratified society and regional chiefdom. \\"Apalachee Province\\" , History and Archeology, Friends of Mission San Luis, 2008, accessed 1 Feb 2010 They were part of the Mississippian culture and an expansive regional trade network reaching to the Great Lakes. Their reputation was such that when tribes in southern Florida first encountered the P√°nfilo de Narv√°ez expedition, they said the riches which the Spanish sought could be found in Apalachee country. The \\"Appalachian\\" place-name is derived from the Narv√°ez Expedition's encounter in 1528 with the Tocobaga, who spoke of a country named Apalachen far to the north.Schneider, pp102-103 Several weeks later the expedition entered the territory of Apalachee north of the Aucilla River. Eleven years later the Hernando de Soto expedition reached the main Apalachee town of Anhaica, somewhere in the area of present-day Tallahassee, Florida, probably near Lake Miccosukee. The Spanish subsequently adapted the Native American name as Apalachee and applied it to the coastal region bordering Apalachee Bay, as well as to the tribe which lived in it. Narv√°ez's expedition first entered Apalachee territory on June 15, 1528. \\"Appalachian\\" is the fourth-oldest surviving European place-name in the U.S. The name and term Appalachia is also linked to the tribe. The Yamasee Tribe had links into the mountain South. It also appears the Apalachee also had such trade and family links farther north, likely linked to Cherokee, Catawba, and other tribes.  Spanish encounters  Charles M. Hudson map of 1997 Two Spanish expeditions encountered the Apalachee in the first half of the 16th century. The expedition of P√°nfilo de Narv√°ez entered the Apalachee domain in 1528, and arrived at a village, which Narv√°ez believed was the main settlement in Apalachee.Schneider, p.145 Spanish attempts to overpower the Apalachee were met with resistance. The Narv√°ez expedition turned to the coast on Apalachee Bay, where it built five boats and attempted to sail to Mexico. Only four men survived their ordeal. In 1539, Hernando de Soto landed on the west coast of the peninsula of Florida with a large contingent of men and horses, to search for gold. The natives told him that gold could be found in Apalachee. Historians have not determined if the natives meant the mountains of northern Georgia, an actual source of gold, or to valuable copper artifacts which the Apalachee were known to have acquired through trade. In any case, de Soto and his men went north to Apalachee territory in pursuit of the precious metal. Because of their prior experience with the Narv√°ez expedition and reports of fighting between the de Soto expedition and tribes along the way, the Apalachee feared and hated the Spanish. When the de Soto expedition entered the Apalachee domain, the Spanish soldiers were described as \\"lancing every Indian encountered on both sides of the road.\\" De Soto and his men seized the Apalachee town of Anhaica, where they spent the winter of 1539‚Äì1540. Apalachee fought back with quick raiding parties and ambushes. Their arrows could penetrate two layers of chain mail. They quickly learned to target the Spaniards' horses, which otherwise gave the Spanish an advantage against the unmounted Apalachee. The Apalachee were described as \\"being more pleased in killing one of these animals than they were in killing four Christians.\\" In the spring of 1540, de Soto and his men left the Apalachee domain and headed north into what is now the state of Georgia. Spanish missions and 18th-century war About 1600, the Spanish Franciscan priests founded a successful mission among the Apalachee, adding several settlements over the next century. Apalachee acceptance of the priests may have related to social stresses, as they had lost population to infectious diseases brought by the Europeans, to which they had no natural immunity. Many Apalachee converted to Catholicism, in the process creating a syncretic fashioning of their traditions and Christianity. In February 1647, the Apalachee revolted against the Spanish near a mission named San Antonio de Bacuqua in present-day Leon County, Florida. The revolt changed the relationship between Spanish authorities and the Apalachee. Following the revolt, Apalachee men were forced to work on public projects in St. Augustine or on Spanish-owned ranches. San Luis de Talimali, the western capital of Spanish Florida from 1656 to 1704, is a National Historic Landmark in Tallahassee, Florida. The historic site is being operated as a living history museum by the Florida Department of Archeology. Including an indigenous council house, it re-creates one of the Spanish missions and Apalachee culture, showing the closely related lives of Apalachee and Spanish in these settlements. The historic site received the \\"Preserve America\\" Presidential Award in 2006.Presentation of the \\"Preserve America\\" award by President Bush Starting in the 1670s, tribes to the north and west of Apalachee (including Chiscas, Apalachicolas, Yamasees and other groups that became known as Creeks) began raiding the Apalachee missions, taking captives who could be traded as slaves to the English in the Province of Carolina. Seeing that the Spanish could not fully protect them, some Apalachees joined their enemies. Apalachee reprisal raids, made in part to try to capture Carolinian traders, pushed the base camps of the raiders eastward, from which they continued to raid Apalachee missions as well as missions in Timucua Province. Efforts were also made to establish missions along the Apalachicola River to create a buffer zone. In particular, several missions were established among the Chatot tribe. In 1702, a few Spanish soldiers and nearly 800 Apalachee, Chatot and Timucuan warriors, on a reprisal raid after several Apalachee and Timucuan missions had been raided, were ambushed by Apalachicolas. Only 300 warriors escaped the ambush.Milanich183-4 When Queen Anne's War (the North American part of the War of Spanish Succession) started in 1702, England and Spain were officially at war, and attacks by the English and their Indian allies against the Spanish and the Mission Indians in Florida and southeastern Georgia accelerated. In early 1704 Colonel James Moore of Carolina led 50 Englishmen and 1,000 Apalachicolas and other Creeks in an attack on the Apalachee missions. Some villages surrendered without a fight, while others were destroyed. Moore returned to Carolina with 1,300 Apalachees who had surrendered and another 1,000 taken as slaves. In mid-1704 another large Creek raid captured more missions and large numbers of Apalachees. In both raids missionaries and Christian Indians were tortured and murdered, sometimes by skinning them alive. These raids became known as the Apalachee Massacre. When rumors of a third raid reached the Spanish in San Luis de Talimali, they decided to abandon the province.Milanich:184-5, 187 About 600 Apalachee survivors of Moore's raids were settled near New Windsor, South Carolina. Following the Yamasee War the New Windsor band joined the Lower Creek, and many returned to Florida.Ricky: 77 When the Spanish abandoned Apalachee province in 1704, some 800 surviving Indians, including Apalachees, Chatots and Yemasee, fled westward to Pensacola, along with many of the Spanish in the province. Unhappy with conditions in Pensacola, most of the Apalachees moved further west to French-controlled Mobile. They encountered a yellow-fever epidemic in the town and lost more people. Later, some Apalachees moved on to the Red River in present-day Louisiana, while others returned to the Pensacola area, to a village called Nuestra Se√±ora de la Soledad y San Lu√≠s. A few Apalachees from the Pensacola area returned to Apalachee province around 1718, settling near a fort that the Spanish had just built at St. Marks, Florida. Many Apalachees from the village of Ivitachuco moved to a site called Abosaya near a fortified Spanish ranch in what is today Alachua County, Florida. In late 1705 the remaining missions and ranches in the area were attacked, and Abosaya was under siege for 20 days. The Apalachees of Abosaya moved to a new location south of St. Augustine, but within a year most of them had been killed in raids. The Red River band integrated with other Indian groups, and many eventually went west with the Creeks, though others remained, and their descendants still live in Rapides Parish, Louisiana. When Florida was transferred to Britain in 1763, several Apalachee families from mission San Joseph de Escambe, then living adjacent to the Spanish presidio of Pensacola in a community consisting of 120 Apalachee and Yamasee Indians, were moved to Veracruz, Mexico. Eighty-seven Indians living near St. Augustine, some of whom may have been descended from Apalachees, were taken to Guanabacoa, Cuba.Milanich:187-8, 191, 195 Tony Horwitz, \\"Apalachee Tribe, Missing for Centuries, Comes Out of Hiding \\", The Wall Street Journal, 9 Mar 2005; Page A1, on Weyanoke Association Website, accessed 29 Apr 2010 Ricky: 76‚Äì77 Modern descendants Gilmer Bennett, former Chief of the Talimali Band of Apalachee In the years after the United States' Louisiana Purchase, the Apalachees in Louisiana faced encroachment by settlers, and discrimination as a non-white minority, particularly severe after the end of the American Civil War. Under the state's binary racial segregation laws passed at the end of the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, they were classified as \\"colored\\" or \\"black\\".Tony Horwitz, \\"Apalachee Tribe, Missing for Centuries, Comes Out of Hiding \\", The Wall Street Journal, 9 Mar 2005; Page A1, on Weyanoke Association Website, accessed 29 Apr 2010 The tribe's descendants in Louisiana, known as the \\"Talimali Band of Apalachee\\", still live in Rapides Parish. Some still live in Chopin, Louisiana, in the hills of the Kisatchie National Forest. In 1997 they started the process of seeking federal recognition but have ceased to seek recognition. Since they have become more public, they have been invited to consult with Florida on the reconstruction at Mission San Luis, invited to pow-wows, and invited to recount Apalachee history at special events. As of 2017 they had two co- chiefs, Arthur and TJ Bennett, sons of the former chief Gilmer Bennett.

History = Beginnings  When captain James Cook landed in Australia in 1776 he was sure to have had some Presbyterians in his crew. John Hunter the captain of HMS Sirius was a former Church of Scotland minister. Later Presbyterian Christianity came to Australia with the arrival of members from a number of Presbyterian denominations in Great Britain at the end of the 18th century. The Presbyterian missionaries played an important role to spread the faith in Australia. Since then Presbyterianism grew to the fourth largest Christian faith in the country.http://pcnsw.org.au/index.php/history/ St Andrew's Presbyterian Church, Sydney, 1840s The Presbyterian Church of Australia was formed when Presbyterian churches from various Australian states federated in 1901. The churches that formed the Presbyterian Church of Australia were the Presbyterian Churches of New South Wales, Victoria, Queensland, South Australia, Tasmania and Western Australia. These state churches were (and still are) incorporated by separate Acts of Parliament (i.e. by the respective State Parliaments) for property holding purposes. (These Acts are known as Property Trust Acts).  Church union  People who identify as Presbyterian or Reformed as a percentage of the total population in Australia divided geographically by statistical local area, as of the 2011 census In 1977 two- thirds of the Presbyterian Church of Australia together with nearly all the membership of the Congregational Union of Australia and the Methodist Church of Australasia, joined to form the Uniting Church in Australia. Much of the third who did not join the Uniting Church did not agree with its liberal views, although a number remained because of cultural connections.  After the union  Before the union the Presbyterian Church of Australia was liberal, but the continuing Presbyterian Church became increasingly conservative. A resurgence of traditional Reformed theology took place. In 1982 the denomination withdrew from the largely liberal World Communion of Reformed Churches and later joined the conservative World Reformed Fellowship. In 1987 a new hymnbook was introduced. In 1991 the General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church in Australia repealed the approval of the ordination of women. Women elders continue in some states. The heresy trial of Peter Cameron in 1993 upheld historic Reformed beliefs. The church is active in missions with about 130 missionaries working around the world, including Korea, the Pacific and Myanmar.http://www.reformiert- online.net/adressen/detail.php?lg=eng&id;=1231  Statistics  The Presbyterian Church of Australia's official website has stated that the church has over 50,000 adults and children within 740 congregations with more than 600 ministers, deaconesses and theological students. At the last Commonwealth Census (2016) nearly 540,000 people identified as Presbyterian/Reformed, representing 2.3% of the population. This makes Presbyterianism Australia's fifth largest Christian denomination, although not all Presbyterians are members of the Presbyterian Church of Australia.

Beliefs Crest of the Presbyterian Church of Australia Ministers and elders of the Presbyterian Church of Australia are required to agree to the Westminster Confession of Faith as their subordinate authority under the Bible.  Interchurch organisations  The Presbyterian Church of Australia belong to the World Reformed Fellowship, which is a conservative association, where Reformed, Presbyterian, Reformed Baptist and Reformed Episcopal denominations, congregations and individuals can also participate. Church government The Presbyterian Church of Australia is ruled by elders or presbyters. Presbyterian churches recognise two types of elders: teaching elders (ministers) and ruling elders. These elders meet at a local level in the Kirk Session. Only ordained ministers may preside at Communion, or the Lord's Supper, except in the rare circumstance where the presbytery licenses a ruling elder to do so. Likewise, only a minister can administer Baptism. A board or committee of management handles the material concerns of the local congregation. Deacons may also be elected to provide practical care.www.mgpc.org.au/AnIntroductionttothePCABooklet.pdf The minister and an elder from each parish have a seat at their regional presbytery and at their state's general assembly. The General Assembly of Australia (GA of A), composed of commissioners from each presbytery and state assembly, meets every three years. Every year each state's general assembly elects a moderator, while the General Assembly of Australia elects a moderator general for a three-year term. In 1991, the PCA's General Assembly of Australia determined that only men are \\"eligible for admission to the Ministry of Word and Sacraments.\\" The rights of women ordained prior to this time were not affected.The Scheme of Union St Paul's Presbyterian Church in Barmedman, New South Wales.  Australian Presbyterians  Current ministers in the Presbyterian Church of Australia include Allan Harman, David Mitchell, Iain Murray and Bruce W. Winter.

They grow millet and sorghum as staples and raise cattle, sheep, and goats on a small scale. Their normal domestic unit is the polygamous joint family of a man and his sons (and sometimes grandsons) with their wives and unmarried daughters. Married daughters live with their husbands in other communities, commonly nearby. Rituals and traditions=Surrounding the first-born son The Tallensi are polygamous and follow a patrilineal system of kinship and descent. Great emphasis is placed on inheritance and the tensions surrounding parents' relationships with their children. It is considered essential for a man to have a son if he is to achieve fulfillment and be venerated as an ancestor after his death. However, the birth of a first-born son, and to a lesser extent a first-born daughter, is held to mark the culmination of a man's 'rise' in the world, and the start of his decline. Meanwhile, the son grows to replace and supplant the father. The resulting ambivalence between father and son plays an important role in Tallensi rituals and taboos. Taboos begin when the first-born son reaches the age of five or six. From this time on the son may not eat from the same dish as his father, wear his father's cap or tunic, carry his father's quiver, use his father's bow, or look into his father's granary. When the son reaches adolescence, he may not meet his father in the entrance to the house compound. Similar taboos exist to regulate the relationship between mother and first-born daughter. The daughter, for example, may not look into her mother's storage pot. Upon the death of a father, his first-born son and daughter lead the rituals involved in his funeral. The son, at this point, puts on his father's cap and tunic. A tribal elder, carrying the dead man's bow, ritually guides the son to his father's granary and shows him the inside. After his father's death the son is considered a mature man for the purposes of ritual, and it is his responsibility to make sacrifices to the ancestors, chief among them being his own father, who being recently dead is held to act as an intermediary between those still living and the more remote ancestors. It is believed that these taboos and rituals serve to channel ambivalence and resentment between generations into culturally defined and culturally acceptable means of expression. Sacred Crocodile Among the Tallensi tribe there is a belief in the sacred crocodile. As Meyer Fortes highlighted in his ethnographic work \\"The concept of the person\\", special crocodiles in special pools are considered persons among the Tallensi. No local man, indeed no Tallensi would dare kill or injure a sacred crocodile. Every Tallensi knows that these crocodiles are the incarnation of important clan ancestors. To kill one of these is like killing a person. It is murder of the most heinous kind and it would bring disaster on the whole clan. However, not all crocodiles are considered persons (ni-saal) for instance, in the rivers that are fished in the dry season - is not a person, not sacred. It can be killed and eaten.

The Flowbee is an electrically powered vacuum cleaner attachment made for cutting hair. It was developed and filed for patent in 1986 by Rick E. Hunts, a San Diego, California carpenter. US patent 4679322 was granted in 1987https://www.google.com/patents/US4679322 and the product marketed since 1988. Hunt initially sold the Flowbees out of his garage before finding success with live demonstrations at a county fair. The product was advertised as being capable of performing \\"hundreds of precision layered haircuts\\" in frequently aired late-night television infomercials. By 2000, two million Flowbees had been sold. Hair cutting devices like the Flowbee have found continued use by astronauts during spaceflight missions, including on the ISS, because of its convenience. Hair particles get collected by the vacuum instead of floating away, and becoming potentially hazardous to sensitive equipment or accumulating inside the spacecraft. The Flowbee can also be used to groom dogs with long hair such as Maltese or Bichon Fris√© with a special pet grooming attachment which is sold separately. Previously, a special green-colored Flowbee Pet Groomer variant of the device was available. Over the years, the Flowbee device saw at least three revisions which can be identified by the shape and labeling of the cutting head (\\"Vac-u-cut\\", \\"Flowbee Int.\\", \\"Flowbee.com\\").

It was featured on The Fourth Hour, hosted by Pat Gray and Stu Burguiere on GBTV, during the Infomercial Friday segment which aired on June 22, 2012. The Flowbee was given poor reviews by both hosts after the product was tested despite initial optimism by Burguiere. Gray quipped that \\"the problem seems to be that [the Flowbee] doesn't actually cut hair\\". It was also spoofed in the film Wayne's World as a device called the \\"Suck Kut\\". Reference to the Flowbee was made in the American comedy series Glee. In Season 1, Episode 15 \\"The Power of Madonna\\" glee club director, Mr. Schuester told Sue Sylvester, \\"Oh, maybe you should try a new setting on your Flowbee, oh snap\\". The band Bloodhound Gang made reference to the device in their song \\"Mope\\" from their third album Hooray for Boobies with the lyric \\"Givin' myself a mullet / Hook the Flowbee to the Kirby.\\" In The Spy Next Door, the children find a Flowbee in the spy character's drawer. In an episode of The Nanny, CC comments on the fact that Niles is so stingy with his money that he \\"bought a Flowbee just so you could do your own hair!\\".

The denomination was formed in 1967, as a result of growing theological liberalism within the Presbyterian Church of Australia, prior to the formation of the Uniting Church in Australia in 1977. The PRC met for the first time in Sutherland, Sydney, on Sunday, 8 December 1967. Today it is made up of congregations in Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia, Vanuatu and Fiji. During its existence there have also been congregations and/or mission works in the Australian Capital Territory, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea and Kenya, but these have not continued. History=Events leading to the formation of the PRCA The Presbyterian Reformed Church formed in 1967 because of the desire of its founders to maintain the gospel witness of the church. The move to form a new church was a result of growing liberalism within the Presbyterian Church of Australia. As early as 1901, a Declaratory Act was passed, which toned down the distinctive Calvinistic doctrines of the Westminster Confession of Faith and allowed liberty of opinion for ministers on a wide range of doctrines set forth in the Confession. In 1936, the General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church of Australia, in a private session, shelved charges levied against Dr Samuel Angus who denied the deity of Christ and the inspiration and authority of Scripture as defined in Chapter 1 of the Westminster Confession of Faith. In 1967, Professor Lloyd Geering, the Principal of the Presbyterian Theological College in New Zealand was brought up on charges of 'doctrinal error'. During his church trial he claimed that the remains of Jesus lay somewhere in Palestine and rejected the notion that God is a supernatural being who created and continues to look over the world. http://prc.org.au/who-are-we/ Despite these views, Professor Geering was acquitted of the charges by the 1967 General Assembly. This acquittal can rightfully be considered the immediate cause of the formation of the Presbyterian Reformed Church of Australia.http://www.reformiert-online.net/adressen/detail.php?id=1236‚â∂=eng www.reformiert-online.net/adressen/detail.php?id=1236‚â∂=eng Since the formation of the PRCA For the first 6 months of its existence, the Presbyterian Reformed Church consisted of the congregation at Sutherland. During the second half of 1968, congregations were established in Brisbane, Queensland, Ryde, New South Wales and Wagga Wagga, New South Wales. During 1969 a youth group of over 20 people at Cronulla Presbyterian became part of the PRC. The PRC has grown to include congregations in Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia, and as a result of missionary work have established congregations in Vanuatu and Fiji. Other works have been undertaken in the Australian Capital Territory, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea and Kenya, but the congregations established in those areas have not continued. Doctrine The Presbyterian Reformed Church receives the Bible (consisting of the sixty six books of the Old and New Testament) as the inspired word of God and the only foundation for how to serve God and live as Christians. Being a Reformed Church, it holds to the Calvinistic system of Biblical truth and receives the Westminster Confession of Faith as it Confessional standard, with a few stated amendments. The full text of the Westminster Confession of Faith, with stated amendments, can be found here.http://prc.org.au/who-are-we/ In summary, the PRC believes: * In the Triune God consisting of the Father, Son and Holy Spirit, the God who created and controls the whole world according to his excellent purpose and plan. * That salvation is only by faith in Christ Jesus, whose perfect life and sacrificial death was sufficient to atone for sin in every person who believes in him. * God's promise to offer eternal life in heaven after death to all people who believe in the saving work of Christ Jesus and the requirement of eternal judgement in hell after death for all who reject Christ. http://prc.org.au/who-are-we/ Government The church is governed in the Presbyterian form. Essentially, each local congregation is governed by a group of elected elders, each of equal rank (including the Minister). Additionally, a council of elders from each congregation meet bi-annually to discuss and judge the denomination's beliefs and activities in various areas. Activities The PRC denomination activities include: *Regular worship services, *Sunday School classes for primary school children, *Youth studies and activities, *Missionary outreach in Australia and overseas *Publishing ministry through Covenanter Press *Ministry training through John Knox Theological College.

At the end of the 17th century the family showed up in the Free Imperial and Hanseatic City of Hamburg. The members of the family acted as long-distance merchants. They became hereditary grand burghers of Hamburg and were Lords of Wellingsb√ºttel Manor ‚Äì nowadays a quarter of Hamburg. The Jauch have brought forth some notable lineal descendants, both patrilineal and matrilineal. They can trace the nearer cognatic kinship of the issue of the progenitor Johann Christian Jauch the Elder (1638‚Äì1718) in the following centuries to a number of renowned contemporaries. Overview=Pre-Hanseatic time The Jauch originate from Thuringia where as the first family member the widow Lena Joherrin is chronicled 1495 in today's Bad Sulza. Johann Christian Jauch the Elder (1638‚Äì1718) left Sulza and entered the service of the G√ºstrow branch of the Grand Ducal House of Mecklenburg. Two of his sons joined the service of the Electors of Saxony and Kings of Poland. These branches were since the lieutenant colonel of the Franz Georg Jauch (b. 1681) and the major general Joachim Daniel Jauch (1688‚Äì1754) mistakenly regarded as members of the aristocracy. They became extinct in the 18th century.

In 1701 they gained the citizenship () of L√ºneburg.

In contrast to the mediatised burgesses in the towns located in monarchies which were governed by authoritarianism Hamburg was characterized by its free citizens tied to the culture of England. Although a republic the town was not a democracy moreover an oligarchy because it was governed solely by the Hanseaten.

The most prestigious citizens gladly served as officers in the militia. The service in the cavalry was generally a badge of high-ranking social status not least because of the high costs caused by maintaining the cavalry horses and the keeping of a groom which had to be borne by each cavalryman himself. All metal parts of a cavalry officer uniform had to be gilded. For these reasons the Hanseatic cavalry was the stomping ground for the grand burghers. The conscripted members of the family performed their service in the militia as first lieutenants in the cavalry under the cavalry commanders Rittmeister () Ernst Merck and later Rittmeister Adolph Godeffroy. =Ancestors from the Time of the Hanseatic League= Among the ancestors of the Hamburg branch of the family are several First Mayors of the city-state of Hamburg, historically equivalent to a sovereign head of state.

Lieutenant general of the Waffen- SS Karl Fischer von Treuenfeld, descendant of Eleonora Maria Jauch (1732‚Äì1797), was a close friend of Erich Ludendorff and one of the leading figures of the Beer Hall Putsch in 1923, a failed attempt by Adolf Hitler, to seize power in Germany. Charlotte Jauch's (1811‚Äì1872) grandson Otto von Feldmann (1873‚Äì1945) was policy officer of Paul von Hindenburg and in charge of the campaign by which Hindenburg became President of Germany in 1925. History=Origins in Sulza 1512 Georg, Matthias and Nikolaus Jauch were registered as propertied men () in . Matthias Jauch Jauch there was enfeoffed by the sovereign with the Segelitz estate. Georg Jauch (1606‚Äì1675) was burgomaster of Sulza. In Attendance on the Grand Ducal House of Mecklenburg Magdalene Sibylle of Holstein-Gottorp (1631‚Äì1719), whose lady's-maid and confidant Ingborg Jauch was In the 17th century Sulza has been twice devastated, 1613 by the and 1640 when it was plundered by Swedish troops. Johann Christian Jauch the Elder (1638‚Äì1718) left the fallen back Sulza and relocated to G√ºstrow where he entered 1662 the service of the Grand Ducal House of Mecklenburg at its residence G√ºstrow Castle.:de:Schloss G√ºstrow He was a member of the ducal household of Magdalena Sibylle, n√©e Duchess of Schleswig-Holstein-Gottorf, wife of Gustav Adolph, Duke of Mecklenburg- G√ºstrow, until he became 1669 First Valet de chambre () of Crown Prince Carl of Mecklenburg-G√ºstrow. 1665 he married Ingborg Nicolai (‚Ä†1696), who had come to G√ºstrow with the duchess Magdalena Sibylle from Gottorf Castle, serving her as lady's maid and confidant. The social rank of a servant at these times mirrored the lordship ‚àí the higher the lordship, the better the opportunities for the servant to reach a prestigious position himself. A ducal valet de chambre ranked in Mecklenburg-G√ºstrow equal to The Very Reverend, thus allowing the lordship to demonstrate its own rank. Suitably the first daughters of Johann Christian and Ingborg Jauch married members of the nobility. In 1688, Crown Prince Carl died without a male heir. Johann Christian Jauch the Elder quit the service and became burgher of the city of G√ºstrow, dealing at retail and being a court shoemaker, purveyor to the ducal family. His eldest son Johann Christopher Jauch (1669‚Äì1725) had been a stipendiary of the duke and carried out since the end of 1694 the function of a court chaplain (). After the death of the last Duke of Mecklenburg-G√ºstrow, Gustav Adolph, in 1695 the dukedom of Mecklenburg-G√ºstrow became extinct. Though duchess Magdalena Sibylla maintained a small court until 1718 the residence G√ºstrow lost its splendour and relevance. Moreover, Ingborg Jauch had already died. Therefore, almost all family members left G√ºstrow 1696 and turned to L√ºneburg. In Attendance on the House of Hanover 1701 the Jauchs became burghers of L√ºneburg. At L√ºneburg Johann Christopher Jauch (1669‚Äì1725) was Royal British and Electoral Brunswick-L√ºneburg Dean of the Lutheran churches () at St. John's Church, L√ºneburg, while Johann Christian Jauch (1702‚Äì1778) became canon, 1754 subsenior collegii canonici, 1760 The Very Reverend () and vice-dean () with the function of a provost of the Lutheran cathedral of Bardowick. He married Clara Maria Rh√ºden (1710‚Äì1775), who was a great-great-grandchild of the Lutheran theologian of the Protestant Reformation (1559‚Äì1605), thereby ancestor of all later Jauchs, son of deacon Paul Gesner, who was taught by Martin Luther and consecrated by Johannes Bugenhagen. Her great-great-grandfather, the professor of philosophy at Hamburg, Bernhard Werenberg (1577‚Äì1643), has been an opponent to the noted scientist Joachim Jungius at the same place. Her uncle was the predecessor of Johann Christopher Jauch and great-grandson of Philipp Melanchthon Heinrich Jonathan Werenberg (1651‚Äì1713). Ludolph Friedrich Jauch (1698‚Äì1764), son of the dean Johann Christopher Jauch, was Senior Pastor of L√ºneburg's St. Michael's Church (), his brother Tobias Christoph Jauch (1703‚Äì1776), was a legal practitioner and deputy (), member of the municipal council () of L√ºneburg. Carl Jauch (1735‚Äì1818) was Royal British and Electoral Brunswick- L√ºneburg judge of the castle court of justice () in Horneburg and canon of the Cathedral of Bardowick, Friedrich August Jauch (1741‚Äì1796), son of the imperial civil law notary Adolph Jauch (1705‚Äì1758), was senator and police governor of the city of Hannover. Carl Jauch (1680‚Äì1755), merchant in L√ºneburg, has been a supporter of the theologian, alchemist and physician Johann Conrad Dippel, by some authors debatably claimed to be the model for Mary Shelley's novel \\"Frankenstein\\". After Dippel's expulsion from Denmark 1727 Carl Jauch gave shelter to the refugee who was 1729 expelled from L√ºneburg, too. Carl Jauch was married to a grandnice of the L√ºbeck dean (1640‚Äì1698), who strongly influenced the faith and the thinking of Johann Sebastian Bach. Eleonora Maria Jauch's (1732‚Äì1797) father-in-law was the dean of Bardowick , in whose foster-parental home August Hermann Francke 1687 had been guest when he experienced his so-called \\"L√ºneburg conversion\\" (), making him one of the earliest leaders of Pietism. In Attendance on the Electors of Saxony and Kings of Poland 1698 Johann Christopher Jauch adjourned his function in L√ºneburg and served as court chaplain for Christiane Eberhardine of Brandenburg-Bayreuth, queen consort of Poland and grand duchess consort of Lithuania during her cure at Pretzsch, encouraging her to keep at her Lutheran faith after the conversion of her husband to Catholicism. Christiane Eberhardine later was named by her Protestant countrymen \\"The Praying Pillar of Saxony\\" () Hippocampus at Palais Jauch, Warsaw Joachim Daniel Jauch (1688‚Äì1754) Elect. Sax. Major General Royal Polish Colonel His brother Joachim Daniel (1688‚Äì1754) served at first in the army of the Republic of the Seven United Netherlands, before he changed 1705 as lieutenant into the Saxon army. He took part as a captain in the first siege of Stralsund 1711‚Äì12 during the Great Northern War. At the end he was contemporaneously royal Polish colonel (since 1736), electoral Saxon major general (since 1746), superintendent of the Saxon building authority in Poland (since 1721), with the title director (since 1736), remunerated for each function separately. His primary obligation was to supervise the baroque development of the city of Warsaw. Vital was his responsibility for the extensive merrymakings of the Saxon court at Warsaw. When 1730 at the end of tremendous fireworks at Zeithain which lasted for five hours, instead of the correct \\"VIVAT\\" in front of 48 foreign princes and numerous other lords a mistake in writing occurred and a \\"FIFAT\\" was illuminated, he gained his cognomen \\"Fifat\\". He erected the Palais Jauch in Warsaw's suburb Solec and was architect for a number of prominent baroque buildings in Poland. He married Eva Maria M√ºnnich, said to be the daughter of the later Russian Field Marshal Burkhard Christoph Count von M√ºnnich (1683‚Äì1767), his predecessor as superintendent of the Saxon building authority. His son August von Jauch (b. 1731) was godson of King Augustus II the Strong. The elaborate cradle endowed to his parents by the king, later the cradle for Joachim Lelewel, is exhibited in the National Museum, Krak√≥w. Joachim Daniel Jauch is buried in the Capuchins Church in the Miodowa in Warsaw. Some members of the family followed Major General Joachim Daniel von Jauch (1688‚Äì1754) as officers into the Saxon and Polish army, two of them, Franz Georg Jauch (b. 1681) and Heinrich Georg Jauch (b. 1709), serving as lieutenant colonels ‚Äì colonels in relation to the other regiments () ‚Äì in the Royal Guard of King Augustus II the Strong and King Augustus III of Poland. Franz Georg Jauch 1724 was participating as a captain in the Blood-Bath of Thorn, commanding a company of the . Blood-Bath of Thorn on 7 December 1724 Franz Georg Jauch being at the time captain in the Royal Polish Foot Guards Regiment formed up on the right side Grand Burghers of the Free and Hanseatic City of Hamburg 1699 Franz J√ºrgen Jauch and his brother Christian Jauch the Younger (‚Ä† 1720) served an apprenticeship as merchant in Hamburg. 1752 the merchant Joachim Daniel Jauch (1714‚Äì1795) moved his business from L√ºneburg to Hamburg. Lt. Johann Georg Jauch (1727‚Äì1799) kidnapped 1754 Anna , daughter of the Secretary of State of Hamburg Magnifizenz Johann Baptista Mutzenbecher (1691‚Äì1759), member of one of Hamburg's leading families and married her. Under Johann Christian Jauch senior (1765‚Äì1855), son of Johann Georg Jauch, the Jauchs became the most important and wealthiest wood traders of Hamburg who reached grand burghership status of the town. Thus, they became members of the ruling class, the Hanseatics (Hanseaten) in one of the wealthiest cities of Germany, with whose financial capacity only Vienna could compete because of the local high nobility concentrating there and its wealth. Christian Jauch senior's sons were founders of the three still existing branches of the family: Wellingsb√ºttel, Sch√∂nhagen und Fernsicht. His great- grandnephew was (1874‚Äì1923), naval archtitect and significant for the upgrowth of submarines in World War I, cousin of first president of the Federal Republic of Germany Theodor Heuss. His eldest son Johann Christian Jauch junior (1802‚Äì1880) acquired the Manor house Wellingsb√ºttel, previously domicile of the penultimate Duke of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Beck, Friedrich Karl Ludwig, ancestor of the modern-day British royal family. In addition to his land he leased the for hunting, which is today Hamburg's largest nature reserve. Alongside his home in Hamburg he erected a deer park and a cage for the bears he brought with himself from his voyages to Russia. The poet Hebbel wrote to his long-time compagnion Elise Lensing, who had lived for many years in the house Stadtdeich 43, after she moved out: 1863 he was a patron of the international agricultural exhibition on the Heiligengeistfeld. His son Carl Jauch (1828‚Äì1888) was Lord of Wellingsb√ºttel, too. He married Louise von Plessen (1827‚Äì1875), daughter of the Grand Ducal Mecklenburg Governor (Gro√üherzoglich Mecklenburgischen Oberlanddrost) Ulrich von Plessen und great-granddaughter of Baron (Reichsfreiherr) Seneca von Gelting (1715‚Äì1786), who was married to a nice of Johannes Thedens and had become highly wealthy as charg√© d'affaires of the Dutch East India Company in Cirebon. His grandfather Diederich Brodersen (1640‚Äì1717), ancestor of today's Jauchs of the Wellingsb√ºttel branch is also an ancestor to the composer Johannes Brahms. Because of this marriage the earliest notable ancestor is Helmoldus I de Huckelem, documented 1097 and connecting the Wellingsb√ºttel branch to numerous prominent other descendants of inter alia the von Plessen, von Moltke und von Oertzen families. Auguste Jauch (1822‚Äì1902) was one of the well known benefactors to the poor of Hamburg. Colonel Hans Jauch (1883‚Äì1965), Commander of the Freikorps \\"Jauch\\", took part in putting down communist uprisings in 1920 and is founder of the Roman Catholic branch of the family. Luise Jauch (1885‚Äì1933) was head nurse at The Magic Mountain at Davos, the second famous novel of Thomas Mann, when his wife Katia Mann stood there 1912. Luise Jauch's traits have been utilized for the novel's head nurse Adritacia von Mylendonk. Krummbek Manor In different polls G√ºnther Jauch (b. 1956) was elected as ‚ÄúMost intelligent German‚Äù (2002), ‚ÄúMost wanted TV-star to become politician‚Äù (2003) and ‚ÄúMost popular German‚Äù (2005). He was awarded in 2001 the World Award for entertainment. Since 2008 his sculpture is part of Madame Tussauds wax museum at Berlin. Major Landowners in Guatemala In Guatemala the coffee business was from the beginning in the hand of German investors. ‚Ä≥The US government forced the Guatemalan government to confiscate the German coffee holdings and to arrest German citizens. This allowed US companies to take control of the Guatemalan coffee industry.‚Ä≥ In the Times of the Third ReichHeinrich Jauch, First State Attorney at Hamburg= Commemorative plaque in memory of those who were beheaded in Hamburg's central place of execution, the remand prison at the Holstenglacis Heinrich Jauch (1894‚Äì1945) was the Prosecuting Attorney of the Special Tribunal () Hamburg in the criminal trial against the Soviet agent during the interwar period Jan Valtin and 52 other defendants of whom nine were condemned to death. Jauch crushed with this trial the Red Navy () Hamburg. Valtin reports in his biography ‚ÄúOut of the Night‚Äù, the US-bestseller of 1941 and the TIME ‚ÄúBook of the Year‚Äù, the trial and the executions: The trial is regarded to be the model for the Moscow Trials which were a series of three show trials held in the Soviet Union at the instigation of Joseph Stalin between 1936 and 1938. I these trials Stalin got rid of most of the surviving Old Bolsheviks, as well as the former leadership of the Soviet secret police. In addition, it is believed that Heinrich Jauch has won the majority of the death sentences in Hamburg bevor he was called to Berlin. The first who were sentenced to death were executed on 19 May 1934. Formerly a guillotine had been used, but it had been discarded as a French method of decapitation. Since then people were put to death with an executioner's ax. The executions under the direction of Heinrich Jauch became, entwined with the events of the Altona Bloody Sunday, the literary model for a novel and two films. The novelist Arnold Zweig red 1938 in a newspaper in Haifa the mistaken information that Dettmer and others had been executed by a master butcher named Fock who after a couple of months had committed suicide. Zweig made literary use of the beheadings and the alleged fate of the headsman and published 1943 the novel (The axe of Wandsbek). 1951 an East German film script, The Axe of Wandsbek was adapted from the novel followed by the West German film . In memory of Jonny Dettmer a Stolperstein was set into the ground in front of the house where he lived in Hamburg-Eilbek. In 1937 Heinrich Jauch brought the charge against Arnold Bernstein a shipowner and pioneer of transatlantic car transport. Bernstein was imprisoned on charges of foreign exchange offenses. At the time of his arrest, he was the owner of one of the largest Jewish businesses in Germany. The company was confiscated without compensation and after an additional payment of $30,000 in U.S. currency, Bernstein was allowed to leave Germany. The show trial is regarded to be the first major Aryanization of Jewish property. Hans Oster Cousin of Walter Jauch, one of the leaders of the German resistance, executed 1945, supported by Jauch & H√ºbener Similarly, Heinrich Jauch organized that the Nazi state reached control over the trading firm Alfred C. Toepfer Company owned by Alfred Toepfer. He arrested Toepfer on charges of foreign exchange offenses between 1937 and 1938 until Toepfer gave up control over his firm. =Jauch & H√ºbener and the German Resistance to Nazism= Major General Hans Oster (1887‚Äì1945), one of the earliest and most determined opponents of Adolf Hitler and Nazism, moving spirit of German resistance from 1938 to 1943, was a first cousin-in-law of Rittmeister () (1888‚Äì1976). Walter Jauch was the founder of Jauch & H√ºbener, who were at the beginning of the Second World War the largest insurance broker in continental Europe. In the Oster Conspiracy Oster planned already in 1938 to assassinate German dictator Adolf Hitler, the leader of Nazi Germany. Oster and his opposition group including Hans von Dohn√°nyi were supported by Jauch & H√ºbener, today's German branch of Aon Corporation. Walter Jauch's co-founder was arrested 1945 in Hamburg and hanged in late April 1945 without trial, a few days before the end of Nazi Germany.List of members of the 20 July plot =Robert Jauch, officer commanding in the battle of Stalingrad= Robert Jauch (1913‚Äì2000) fought as an officer, almost as an artillery observer (), ultimately as first lieutenant and officer commanding (OC) of an artillery battery of the Panzer-Artillerieregiment 16, part of the 16. Panzer-Division, in a number of major battles, including the Battle of France, the Battle of Kiev (1941), the First Battle of Kharkov and the Battle of Kalach. In 1942‚Äì1943 he took part in the Battle of Stalingrad. Of about 400,000 German casualties during the battle about 150,000 fell in the \\"Cauldron\\" of Stalingrad itself. The surviving nearly 110,000 Germans of which 2,500 were officers were captured in Stalingrad. Among those was Robert Jauch, who surrendered on his thirtieth birthday, the 2 February 1943. Out of the 110,000 survivors only about 5,000 ever returned from Russia. Robert Jauch became a member of the League of German Officers () (BDO), an anti-Nazi organization. He came back to Germany after seven years as a prisoner of war in Yelabuga, Kuibishev and Simferopol as one of the ‚Ä≥late homecomers‚Ä≥ () in 1950. =Casualties of World War I and World War II= on which Rudolf Jauch served as an officer cadet Eight lineage holders of the Jauch, half of all lineage holders in these generations, died as soldiers on the different European battlefields of the First World War and the Second World War, seven of them killed in action. They all with only one exception had no descendants. Lt. Rudolf Jauch (1891‚Äì1915) died 1915 in the sinking of the submarine U-40 by the submarine HMS C24, cooperating with the decoy-ship Taranki. It was the first U-boot trap victory by the British Royal Navy during the First World War. The Distinguished Service Cross which has been awarded for this action to Commander Captain Frederick Henry Taylor is part of the collection of the National Maritime Museum at Greenwich. The wreck was discovered a hundred years later approximately off Eyemouth, Berwickshire, Scotland. It is placed as a controlled site under the Protection of Military Remains Act 1986. ‚Äì Since their joint training als officer cadets on Rudolf Jauch was a friend of the later pacifist and anti-war activist Martin Niem√∂ller. First Lieutenant G√ºnther Jauch (1919‚Äì1942), aid de camp of the Panzer-Artillerieregiment 227 was killed in action during the Lyuban Offensive Operation, a major Russian attack as part of the Siege of Leningrad which was one of the longest and most destructive sieges in history and overwhelmingly the most costly in terms of casualties. His final resting place is since 2000 on the German war cemetery Sologubovka.Final resting place: block 2 row 47 grave 5257 Daughters of the Jauch and their DescendantsCatharina Elisabeth Jauch (1671‚Äì1736) married von Naumann= Siege of Buda 1686 by Frans Geffels After all officers of the Corps of Engineers had lost their lives Johann Christoph von Naumann volunteered in the rank of a captain, finished the trenches to the walls, blew a breach in the walls and was in the first squad storming the walls. Catharina Elisabeth Jauch (1671‚Äì1736) married the later colonel and architect of King August the Strong, Johann Christoph von Naumann. He was a member of the diplomatic mission of the Holy League in the course of the Treaty of Karlowitz 1699 with the Ottoman Empire, which ended the Great Turkish War. =Juliana Agnesa Jauch (1673 bis nach 1712) married Baroness von Schmiedel= Juliana Agnesa Jauch (1673‚Äì1712) married Baron () Johann Rudolf von Schmiedel, Saxon district governor () and councillor of the board of domains (), their son being Baron Franz Rudolf von Schmiedel, Lord Steward of the Household () of the extravagant Ernest Augustus I, Duke of Saxe-Weimar- Eisenach. =Constance Jauch (1722‚Äì1802) married von L√∂lh√∂ffel= Lelewel Palace built by Constance Jauch (1722‚Äì1802) Painting by Canaletto with the palace on the left side of Miodowa Street between the in the middle left and the Krasi≈Ñski Palace at the rear Joachim Daniel Jauch's daughter Constance Jauch (1722‚Äì1802) married Heinrich L√∂lh√∂ffel von L√∂wensprung (1705‚Äì1763), privy councillor () and physician to the King Augustus III of Poland. After the death of her father she erected 1755 by Ephraim Schr√∂ger the Lelewel Palace ‚Äì her polonized name ‚Äì in the Miodowa. Regardless the early death of her husband in 1763 she enabled a splendid career for her children. Her son Karol Maurycy Lelewel (1750‚Äì1830) married a daughter of the starosta of Babice, niece of the archbishop and metropolitan of the archdiocese of Mogilev (1745‚Äì1831). Karol Mauricy Lelewel was a Royal Polish captain, reached the indygenat, the naturalisation as a Polish noble, and became a member of the general sejm. 1789 he became appointed as cup- bearer of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania (), a title possessed prior by Stanis≈Çaw August Poniatowski before he was elected as the last king and grand duke of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. Karol Mauricy was from 1778 until 1794 the lawyer and treasurer of the Commission of National Education, which was because of its vast authority and autonomy considered the first Ministry of Education in European history. Lelwel was also centrally linked to another important achievement of the Polish Enlightenment, the Constitution of May 3, 1791. After 1789 during the Sejm Wielki the reformers had to sacrifice many of their privileges in order to gain support for the Constitution of May the 3rd. Nevertheless, it is often argued, with quite some force, that because of the efforts of the Commission of National Education, the Polish language and culture did not disappear into oblivion, during the Partitions of Poland - heavy Russification and Germanisation notwithstanding. Polish Constitution of May 3, 1791 ballot in the hall of the senators designed 1733 by Joachim Daniel Jauch, his grandson Karol Mauricy Lelewel (1750‚Äì1830) being one of the fathers of the constitution Constance Jauch's grandsons were Joachim, Prot und Jan Pawel Lelewel.

The anarchist Michail Bakunin was strongly influenced by him. He was a friend of Gilbert du Motier, marquis de Lafayette, who had given shelter to him in his manor Lagrange, where he was later arrested and then expelled from France. The 29 May is Lelewel's memorial day in the Jewish almanc for his commitment for the Jewish emancipation. Dethronement of Czar Nicholas I 1831 as King of Poland under the leadership of Joachim Lelewel, restorer and president of the radical Patriotic Club () Prot Lelewel (1790‚Äì1884) served as a captain during the French invasion of Russia, participated 1812 in the Battle of Berezina and 1813 in the Battle of Leipzig and was decorated as a chevalier of the L√©gion d'honneur and with the silver medal of the Virtuti Militari.

Their granddaughter Jadwiga ≈Åuszczewska (1834‚Äì1908), daughter of the economist Wac≈Çaw J√≥zef ≈Åuszczewski and the writer Magdalena ≈Åuszczewska, was a Polish poet and novelist. Great- grandson of Constance Jauch was the Nobel Prize-winning novelist, author of \\"Quo vadis\\", Henryk Sienkiewicz (1846‚Äì1916). His daughter was the painter Jadwiga Sienkiewicz-Korni≈Çowiczowa. Another great-grandson was the founder of the Polish historical study of literature Ignacy Chrzanowski (1866‚Äì1940), who died during the Sonderaktion Krakau at Sachsenhausen concentration camp. His son Lieutenant Bogdan Chrzanowski was murdered by Soviet soldiers, on the expressed orders of Joseph Stalin, in the Katyn massacre. His daughter Hanna Chrzanowska is being investigated by the Catholic Church for possible sainthood. The council of cardinals in Rome has decreed that she has practised the cardinal virtues of Faith, Hope and Charity to a heroic degree and, therefore, may be referred to as Venerable Servant of God. Constance Jauch's granddaughter Anna Cieciszowska was sister-in-law of Magdalena Agnieszka Sapie≈ºyna (1739‚Äì1780), daughter of Antoni Benedykt Lubomirski and informal consort of King Stanis≈Çaw August Poniatowski.

Tomb of Friedrich Overbeck San Bernardo alle Terme, Rome, Italy Pope Pius IX Her grandson was the painter and head of the Nazarene movement Johann Friedrich Overbeck (1789‚Äì1869), decorated with the Prussian Order Pour le M√©rite for Sciences and Arts. On 7 February 1857 Pope Pius IX came for a personal visit in his home, the Villa Cancellotti next to the Via Merulana in Rome. At that time he was painting the large-sized \\"Christ absconding from the Jews\\" (1858), a commission from Pius IX, and an allegory on the pope's escape 1848 from Rome in disguise as a regular priest, originally on a ceiling in the Quirinal Palace, later covered by the king, and now hanging in front of the Aula delle Benedizione in the Vatican. The Pope encouraged him: The archaeologist Johannes Adolph Overbeck (1826‚Äì1895) was Constance Jauch's grand-grandson. Her great-granddaughter C√§cilie Lotte Eleonore Overbeck (1856-post 1920), married the anthropologist and ethnologist Emil Ludwig Schmidt (1837‚Äì1906), who was personal physician of the hypochondriac \\"Cannon King\\" Alfred Krupp. The great-granddaughter Wilhelmine Friederike Charlotte Overbeck (1829‚Äì1908) was wedded to the well known mechanical engineer Franz Reuleaux (1829‚Äì1905), chairman of the German panel of judges for the Centennial International Exhibition in Philadelphia 1876. Great-great-granddaughter Agnes Elisabeth Overbeck (1870‚Äì1919), a pianist, was married under the pseudonym \\"Baron Eugen Borisowitsch On√©gin\\" to the operatic contralto Sigrid On√©gin, who sang inter alia at Metropolitan Opera and Covent Garden. Karl von Treuenfeld led the manhunt after the Operation Anthropoid Buddenbrook- Nobility The denotation ‚Ä≥Buddenbrook-Nobility‚Ä≥ traces back to Thomas Mann's novel Buddenbrooks which won Mann the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1929. Mann portrayed the manner of life and mores of the Hanseatics in the 19th century. The city where the Buddenbrook family lives shares so many of its street names and other details with Mann's hometown of L√ºbeck that the identification is perfect, although Mann carefully avoids explicit pronunciation of the name throughout the novel. In spite of this fact, many German readers, in particular such from L√ºbeck, and critics attacked Mann for writing about the \\"dirty laundry\\" of his hometown and his own family. However, for a long time that what had been attacked in the past was later regarded being an ennoblement.

The Altdorf main branch of these Jauch became known as Swiss mercenaries. This family is not related to the Hanseatic Jauch covered here. Commoners of the Grand Duchy of Baden Neither are related to the Hanseatic Jauch the Jauch of Villingen-Schwenningen and the surrounding municipalities in today's Schwarzwald-Baar district, who were commoners of the Grand Duchy of Baden. Most Jauch spread over the world in present-day time descend from these Jauch, of whom a number due to poverty and famine emigrated with hundreds of other inhabitants in several waves from 1747‚Äì1754, 1801, 1817, 1847 and in the period thereafter until about 1890 to Prussia, Bessarabia, the United States and Canada. For example, Schwenningen sent in April 1847 about 200 further residents ‚Äì including a few Jauch ‚Äì, corresponding to 5 percent of of the time, across the Atlantic. The municipality had calculated that it would cost less to send the poorest to America than it would to support them until the famine ended, which resulted from the bad potato harvest in 1846. To the Jauch of Schwennigen belongs ‚Äì though stationed in Hamburg ‚Äì the SS Oberscharf√ºhrer , who was convicted and given the death sentence in 1946 because of his involvement in the killings in the subcamp Bullenhuser Damm of the Neuengamme concentration camp. Commoners of the Electorate of Saxony Another Jauch family considered in the literature originates from Pegau and spread to Mei√üen in the Electorate of Saxony. Their ancestor was the butcher Andreas Jauch (b. 1523) and their best known member was the jurist and controlling clerk of the 17th century Haubold Gottfried Jauch. There is no relationship to the Hanseatic Jauch family, too.

In September 2010 it had five centres: Brisbane; Londonderry (Sydney); Cohuna, Victoria (preaching station); Launceston and Winnaleah (Tasmania) with until 2014 a small school at Herrick near Winnaleah. The EPC was constituted in Launceston, Tasmania, on 29 September 1961 with a doctrinal basis identical to the Presbyterian Church of Eastern Australia, three of whose ministers formed a special presbytery for the purpose of ordaining the first three ministers.Robert Humphreys and Rowland Ward, Religious Bodies in Australia, 3rd ed., p. 87. also Rowland S Ward, The Bush Still Burns: The Presbyterian and Reformed Faith in Australia 1788‚Äì1988 (Melbourne 1989) 393 Its first ministers were the Reverend Charles Rodman, Eric Turnbull and Hugh McNeilly. The denomination was originally called the Reformed Evangelical Church but in 1966 changed its name because according to the church's official history \\"it was found that Australian society was not familiar with the term 'reformed' in its historical and church connection. Many associated the word with reform or correctional schools for example.\\"'A History Of The Evangelical Presbyterian Church Of Australia' by T D, A & A J Carins and C Coleborn (History Committee of the Evangelical Presbyterian Church of Australia) The creation of the EPC was part of a revival in Reformed and Calvinist theology among Australian evangelical Christians from the 1950s. Faith and practice The EPC professes adherence to the Westminster Standards, but rejects common grace and the concept of God having unfulfilled desires for the salvation of the reprobate.Chris Connors, The Biblical Offer of the Gospel,, p.8. Universalism and the Reformed Churches. That is, the EPC denies that God has any attitude of love or favour to the non-elect in the free offer of the gospel.Modern Moderate Calvinism The EPC is also committed to the biblically regulated worship set forth in Westminster Confession of Faith and exemplified in the Directory of Public Worship. This is interpreted to maintain exclusive psalmody and exclude musical instruments in worship. The EPC's witness has included political action on moral issues such as making submissions to government on observing the Christian Sabbath and gambling and protesting against what it sees as anti-Christian activities, such as the rock opera, Jesus Christ, Superstar. It supports Bible translation through the Chinese Translation Society (formerly the Reformation Translation Fellowship), and Christian missions in places such as Uganda and the Middle East. Family and young people's camps and studies have been regularly held in Australia. Relationships with other denominations The EPC was formed because its members believed the large mainstream denominations from which they had come, including the Baptist, Presbyterian and Methodist churches in Australia, had departed from fundamental Christian truths and contained too much spiritual compromise. Instead they embraced the Reformed faith although its inclusion of infant baptism was problematic for some and at Easter 1961 the Reverend J L Lincolne, former principal of the WEC International College in Launceston left the fellowship and established a new college and congregation based on the 1689 Baptist Confession of Faith. Early encouragement from the Presbyterian Church of Eastern Australia (popularly known as \\"the Free Church\\") was significant in shaping the emerging EPC community. After contemplating joining, the leaders did not proceed with an actual union but there was a desire to continue a fruitful ecumenical relationship with it and other reformed churches. However the largely Anglo EPC saw too many doctrinal, worship style, lifestyle and cultural differences to work closely with the Reformed Church of Australia populated as it was largely by Post-war migrants from the Netherlands. The PCEA contributed to the training of EPC ministers through the John Knox Theological College operated 1963‚Äì65 out of the East St Kilda PCEA, but by 1964 the EPC was in significant conflict with the PCEA over the free offer of the gospel, as presented by Professor John Murray and Ned Stonehouse in their booklet on the subject. Some of the EPC congregations split with some members from Penguin joining the PCEA in 1965 with their minister Eric Turnbull. (Turnbull was removed from the PCEA ministry in 1979 because of his teaching that the King James Bible was the pure word of God over against other translations, and subsequently formed the Australian Free Church.) Some from Winnaleah joined the PCEA in 1971 after some years independent but returned in 1979. Controversy win the EPC was evident for a number of years. Some considered that the EPC were reacting in a rationalistic way from their previous free will (Arminian) theology, and that they preached the Bible according to the doctrine rather than the doctrine to the Bible. Two ministers withdrew to form the Southern Presbyterian Church in 1986. In 1991 the Covenant Presbyterian Church in Sydney, which had resulted from a schism from the PCEA Western Sydney in 1981, was received into the EPC. In September 2002 the Rockhampton congregation and its minister withdrew to become Grace Presbyterian Church which united in 2009 with the Australian Free Church. In 2008 the EPC apologised to the PCEA Synod for the hurt caused by accusation of schismatic conduct by the PCEA in 1965 concerning the reception of the Penguin (now Ulverstone) congregation. Relationships in Tasmania have significantly improved. EPC ministers train at the Seminary of the Protestant Reformed Churches in Michigan USA. While there are differences on some matters with the Protestant Reformed Churches the two denominations agree on the rejection of common grace. Reconciliation with Southern Presbyterian Church In March 2019, a joint meeting with officer bearers of the EPC and the SPC sought to repair damaged relations between the two denominations due to the historic split from decades before. The statement said in part: > We of the EPCA and SPCA, as we consider our two histories as churches, > acknowledge before the Lord Jesus, the Head of the Church, that while there > were honourable principles and legitimate concerns involved, and while there > was a desire on both sides for the good of Christ Jesus‚Äô cause, there was > also sin committed by all those involved in the events which led to a > separation and alienation of brethren a generation ago.Together we > acknowledge that those sad events of yesteryear have harmed the name and > cause of Christ Jesus and have hurt and caused to stumble various of His > children. ...

It is a small Presbyterian church numbering slightly over 200 persons with its largest congregation in the area of Geelong, Victoria. The first church, in Geelong, was started in 1858. It links itself historically with those in the Covenanter movement in Scotland who did not accept the settlement of Presbyterianism in that country in 1690, and has sister denominational relations with the Reformed Presbyterian churches of North America, Ireland, and Scotland. Fraternal relations exist with the Presbyterian Church of Eastern Australia. History A number of Reformed Presbyterians had migrated from Scotland or Ireland to Australia. A number who did not join other branches of Presbyterianism were against occasional hearing, and they wanted a minister of their own. They wrote to the parent church requesting this. Rev. A. M. Moore eventually answered. He was ordained in Belfast 18 August 1857, and arrived in Melbourne in late December 1857, to commence the work in Geelong which he served until his death in 1897. Geelong was the only congregation for many years, the most notable minister after Moore being H.K. Mack who served 1909-46. Congregations were begun in McKinnon, Victoria (1933 begun/1946 organised under Rev. W. R. McEwen), Frankston, Victoria (1971/1977), and Sunbury, Victoria (1979/1981, closed 2006). In 1959, Rev. A. Barkley, RP minister in Geelong, became the founding principal of the Reformed Theological College. In 1974, the Australian Presbytery petitioned the parent body, the Reformed Presbyterian Church of Ireland, and was made a separate denomination (or church) on 12 June. In former times, church law required members to believe that the Solemn League and Covenant were still binding and forbade them from participating in government because the Constitution does not explicitly make the Australia an officially Christian country; these provisions have been repealed. The Frankston congregation, after closing in 1989, was revived around 2004 as a preaching station of the McKinnon congregation. The organising pastor from February 2006 was Rev. Ed Blackwood from the United States. In 2008 it became a separate congregation meeting in a hall in Frankston South. The pastor resigned in August 2015 and returned to the U.S. Pastor Andrew McCracken moved to Frankston from the United States to take up the work again in March of 2020.

It was published in 1955. It was written for and first performed by Fred Astaire in the 1955 musical film Daddy Long Legs, and was nominated for an Academy Award in 1955 as Best Original Song, losing to \\"Love is a Many Splendored Thing\\". The song playfully uses the irresistible force paradox ‚Äì which asks what happens when an irresistible force meets an immovable object ‚Äì as a metaphor for a relationship between a vivacious woman and an older, world-weary man. The man, it is implied, will give in to temptation and kiss the woman. The song's lyrics echo the plot of Daddy Long Legs, in which a reserved man in his 50s (Astaire) falls in love with a woman in her early 20s (Leslie Caron). Popular cover versions  The biggest- selling version was recorded by The McGuire Sisters, reaching #5 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart in 1955 (see 1955 in music).Whitburn, Joel (2004).

Sammy Davis Jr. had a popular competing version out the same year which also made the Top 10 on the Billboard pop chart, peaking at #9. The following year Mel Torm√© released a version on his Sings Fred Astaire album. Bing Crosby recorded the song in 1955 for use on his radio show and it was subsequently included in the box set The Bing Crosby CBS Radio Recordings (1954-56) issued by Mosaic Records (catalog MD7-245) in 2009. Frank Sinatra recorded the song in 1959 on his album Come Dance with Me! and it was featured in the incomplete 37-minute 1962 film Something's Got to Give, which was Marilyn Monroe's last work, the film being abandoned after her death. In 1964, Ella Fitzgerald included this song on her Verve album Ella Fitzgerald Sings the Johnny Mercer Songbook, with arrangements by Nelson Riddle. In the game Fallout: New Vegas, Dean Domino from the Dead Money add-on sings this song, although it is a reused version of Bing Crosby's cover which can be heard in Radio New Vegas.

An evergreen perennial, it is widely cultivated for its dramatic flowers. In temperate areas it is a popular houseplant. Taxonomy Joseph Banks described the species in 1788. The specific epithet reginae means ‚Äúof the queen‚Äù, and commemorates the British queen Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Strelitz, wife of George III. Common names such as ‚Äúcrane flower‚Äù and ‚Äúbird of paradise‚Äù reference the open flower‚Äôs resemblance to the head and beak of a colourful exotic bird. Genetic analysis reveals Strelitzia juncea has been shown to be genetically nested within S. reginae. It is possibly a mutation that is in the process of speciating. Description The plant grows to tall, with large, strong leaves long and broad, produced on petioles up to long. The leaves are evergreen and arranged in two ranks, making a fan-shaped crown. The flowers stand above the foliage at the tips of long stalks. The hard, beak-like sheath from which the flower emerges is termed the spathe. This is placed perpendicular to the stem, which gives it the appearance of a bird's head and beak; it makes a durable perch for holding the sunbirds which pollinate the flowers. The flowers, which emerge one at a time from the spathe, consist of three brilliant orange sepals and three purplish-blue or white petals. Two of the blue or white petals are joined together to form an arrow-like nectary. When the sunbirds sit to drink the nectar, the petals open to cover their feet in pollen.Gibbs Russell, G. E., W. G. M. Welman, E. Retief, K. L. Immelman, G. Germishuizen, B. J. Pienaar, M. Van Wyk & A. Nicholas. 1987. List of species of southern African plants. Memoirs of the Botanical Survey of South Africa 2(1‚Äì2): 1‚Äì152(pt. 1), 1‚Äì270(pt. 2). Cultivation and uses Strelitzia reginae is very popular as an ornamental plant. It was first introduced to Britain in 1773, when it was grown at the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew. Since then, it has been widely introduced around the world, including the Americas and Australia, growing well in any area that is sunny and warm. In the United States, Florida and California are the main areas of cultivation, due to their warm climate. It is a common ornamental plant in Southern California, and has been chosen as the Official Flower of the City of Los Angeles. In the UK it is normally grown under glass, in a cool sunny position such as a greenhouse or conservatory, as it does not tolerate temperatures below . However it may be placed outside during the summer months. It has gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit. It is a low-maintenance plant that is easy to grow in the garden; it is fairly tolerant of soil conditions and needs little water once established. If cared for well, they will flower several times in a year. They will thrive in rich loamy soil, especially when they get plenty of water throughout the year. They do well in full sun to semi-shade and respond well to regular feeding with a controlled release fertiliser and compost. They are sensitive to cold and need to be sheltered from frost, as it can damage the flowers and leaves. Strelitzia reginae is slow-growing and will not bloom until three to five years have passed since germination (though it can exceptionally flower at two years).Joffe, P. Easy Guide to Indigenous Shrubs, Briza Publications, 2003 It flowers only when properly established and division of the plant may affect flowering patterns. The flowers are, however, quite long-lasting once they appear. Peak flowering is in the winter and early spring. There is a yellow-flowered cultivar of this plant known as ‚ÄòMandela's Gold‚Äô. It is propagated by seed or division. Allergenic potential Bird-of- paradise plants have an OPALS allergy scale rating of 1, and are considered \\"allergy-fighting\\"; they produce no airborne pollen.

Overview The initial stories were written by Katherine Phillips (adopted daughter of Irna Phillips, who created Guiding Light, As the World Turns and Another World). The story concerned a soap opera writer who adopted two children, a fictionalized version of Irna Phillips' life. Soap opera writer Betty Kahlman (Elizabeth Lawrence, Augusta Dabney) raised her adopted children without a husband. Her sounding board and friend was fellow soap opera writer Meg Johns, played by actress Anna Minot. Betty married Russell Barry (William Prince) and the early focus was on generational conflicts between a newly married middle-aged couple and their confused children. People tried to understand each other, but were ultimately \\"a world apart\\", echoing the title. Eventually, the show-within-a- show element was scaled back, and writer Katherine Phillips was replaced by Richard Holland and Suzanne Holland. At that point, Betty and Russell settled into a tranquil marriage. Other storylines centered on the Sims family, who were mired in less turmoil than the Kahlmans, but still had their problems, as Dr. Ed Sims (James Noble) and his extremely conservative wife Adrian (Kathleen Maguire) struggled with their rebellious daughter Becky (Erin Connor).  Cast  Many of the show's performers went on to later notability as actors, including Susan Sarandon (Patrice Kahlman), Nicolas Surovy (Fred Turner), Susan Sullivan (Nancy Condon), Dorothy Lyman (Julie Stark), and David Birney (Oliver Harrell). James Noble (Dr. Ed Sims) would eventually play Governor Eugene Gatling on the television comedy Benson alongside Robert Guillaume. Clifton Davis, who played Matt Hampton, would later appear in both That's My Mama and Amen, where he played Reverend Reuben Gregory. Jane White and Davis played mother and son on both A World Apart and Amen. Broadcast history The series ran Monday through Friday at 12:30 pm EST, opposite CBS' then- popular Search for Tomorrow and NBC's The Who, What, or Where Game. ABC canceled the show after a little over a year, wrapping up with a moving episode where Patrice Kahlman finally made peace with giving her newborn son up for adoption (among the few, if not only, episodes of this show known to survive).

He is best known for his role as \\"Strop\\" in The Paul Hogan Show, and he was instrumental in the introduction of World Series Cricket in 1977. Career As a journalist, Cornell reported on local events in Perth for The Daily News (a publication of West Australian Newspapers). In 1971, while working as a producer for the television show A Current Affair, Cornell recognized the talents of a Sydney Harbour Bridge rigger, Paul Hogan (who had been the subject of an interview by the station). Cornell became Hogan's manager and often appeared alongside him in his popular television show, The Paul Hogan Show, as a character called \\"Strop\\" (a dim-witted dinkum Australian surf lifesaver). He produced and co-wrote the screenplay for Hogan's 1986 film Crocodile Dundee which became the highest grossing Australian film. He also produced and directed the successful 1988 sequel, Crocodile Dundee II. Cornell worked closely with Kerry Packer and Austin Robertson in setting up World Series Cricket (WSC) in 1977. Based on a suggestion in 1976 by Dennis Lillee (whom Cornell was managing at the time), Cornell presented the idea to Kerry Packer‚Äîprimarily with the aim of providing better financial rewards to the players. Cornell was actively involved in the recruitment of players for WSC, for example travelling to New Zealand to sign players (including Doug Walters). Cornell engaged the Mojo agency to produce radio and television advertisements to promote WSC‚Äîincluding the production of the jingle \\"C'mon Aussie C'mon\\". Personal life Cornell was born in Kalgoorlie, but grew up in Bunbury in Western Australia. He states that he was considered a \\"ratbag\\" at school, but he topped the class in both English and economics at Bunbury High. Cornell married Australian television personality Delvene Delaney in 1977, and they have two children: Allira and Liana. He was married twice before, and has a daughter from one of those marriages (Melissa, born in 1970). Until its sale for a record price of $65 million in 2007, Cornell owned the Beach Hotel in Byron Bay (which he had built for $9 million in 1990). Cornell suffers from Parkinson's disease and has undergone deep brain stimulation to alleviate the symptoms. The disease had rendered Cornell largely immobile; however, treatment by Peter Silburn at St Andrew's War Memorial Hospital in Brisbane enabled him to \\"enjoy 2km walks with his wife\\". Cornell and Paul Hogan were investigated for alleged tax evasion as part of the Australian Taxation Office's Project Wickenby which commenced in 2004. They were also investigated by the Australian Crime Commission \\"over the use of offshore accounts to bank royalties from the Crocodile Dundee films\\" (with both denying any dishonest conduct). They were later cleared of any wrongdoing by the ACC. In 2012 Hogan and Cornell confirmed that they had settled the eight-year dispute with the ATO.

Officer candidates are former enlisted members (E-4 to E-7), warrant officers, inter-service transfers,In this case, Inter-Service Transfer refers to enlisted members of the U.S. Air Force, U.S. Navy, or U.S. Marine Corps transferring to the U.S. Army to attend OCS. or civilian college graduates who enlist for the \\"OCS Option\\" after they complete Basic Combat Training (BCT). The latter are often referred to as college ops. OCS is a 12-week course designed to train, assess, evaluate, and develop second lieutenants for the U.S. Army. It is the only commissioning source that can be responsive to the U.S. Army's changing personnel requirements due to its short length, compared to other commissioning programs and their requirements. Completing OCS is one of several ways of becoming a U.S. Army commissioned officer. The other methods are: *Graduation from the United States Military Academy (USMA) or any of the other U.S. federal service academies. *Completing Reserve Officers' Training Corps (ROTC) offered at many civilian universities throughout the United States *Completing Officer Candidate School programs of the Army National Guard at Regional Training Institutes (RTI) *Direct commissioning: This is normally reserved for accessions of chaplains, medical professionals, and Judge Advocate General (JAG) lawyers. *Inter-service transfer as a commissioned officer of another United States military branch.Army Regulation 614‚Äì120 Interservice Transfer of Army Commissioned Officers on the Active Duty List para 2‚Äì5 Application of officers of other uniformed services *Battlefield commissions, or meritorious commissions, though technically still provided for, have not been used by the U.S. Army since the Vietnam War.

It is a subordinate unit of the Maneuver Center of Excellence (MCoE) also headquartered at Fort Benning. As of July 2014 the battalion has five training companies and a Headquarters Company in operation, designated HHC, Alpha, Bravo, Charlie, Delta and Echo, each of which can conduct one class at a time, with a maximum of 160 candidates being trained in each class.ATRRS Course Catalog Generally, only Alpha thru Delta are used, but if there are sufficient numbers of students, Echo company will be opened-up as well. HHC serves as the \\"holding\\" company for brand new candidates going thru their in-processing or for injured candidates who are recuperating from their injuries. Those who recuperate from injury are often \\"recycled\\" into the next class. Every three weeks a class graduates and another one is started.

Historically, OCS has provided the means by which the U.S. Army could generate large numbers of junior officers during periods of increasing personnel requirements, typically during wars. Prior to 1973, OCS was branch-specific, at one time there being eight separate schools; by 1968, the Army had consolidated OCS. Candidates being commissioned in the combat support branches were sent to Fort Belvoir, Virginia, and would be trained as Combat Engineer Officers. Upon graduation, they would be commissioned in their assigned branch and sent to an officer's basic course. Candidates being commissioned in the combat arms branches would be sent to Infantry OCS at Fort Benning, Georgia or possibly Artillery OCS at Fort Sill, Oklahoma. At that time, OCS consisted of twenty-two weeks of classroom and field training. The Vietnam war brought a significant expansion of the program. In 1973, OCS was made branch immaterial and was consolidated into two courses taught at Ft. Benning, and another at Fort McClellan, Alabama for female Officer Candidates; the course length was reduced to 14-weeks. In 1976, the OCS at Ft. Benning integrated female candidates and became the only OCS left in the active Army, with the closure of the WAC School. The term \\"90-day wonders\\", both as a pejorative and term of affection, has been intermittently applied to junior officers commissioned through OCS since World War II. World War II era Officer Candidate School was first proposed in June 1938, as the Army began expanding in anticipation of hostilities when a plan for an officer-training program was submitted to the Chief of Infantry by Brigadier General Asa L. Singleton, Commandant of the Infantry School. No action was taken until July 1940, however, when Brig. Gen. Courtney Hodges, Assistant Commandant of the Infantry School, presented a revised plan to (then) Brig. Gen. Omar Bradley, Commandant of the Infantry School. In July 1941, the OCS stood up as the Infantry, Field Artillery, and Coastal Artillery Officer Candidate Schools, each respectively located at Fort Benning, Fort Sill, and Fort Monroe, Virginia. Signal Corps Graduating Class, December 1942, Fort Monmouth. In addition to the aforementioned programs, there were Officer Candidate Schools stood up for other branches, in particular, the Signal Corps at Fort Monmouth, New Jersey. Due to the rapid creation of these programs because of wartime necessity, and then the rapid closures or restructuring soon after the end of the war, historical records were not always created or adequately maintained and little is known about some of these branch specific commissioning courses. The Signal Corps however has a full list of records going back to its very first class, which graduated 336 Officers on 30 September 1941. The records are maintained by the U.S. Army Signal Corps OCS Association, which is actively collecting and archiving the personal history of many of the over 27,000 Signal Corps OCS graduates that went through its WWII, Korean War, and Vietnam War programs. The Signal Corps website includes a list of every U.S. Army Signal Corps OCS graduate, the date of their graduation, as well as all TAC Officers, training school CO's, and most enlisted men who served the Signal Corps' OCS training programs. In addition to the Signal Corps, several other units have alumni organizations that have maintained informal records and preserved documentation of the courses. On 27 September 1941, the first Infantry OCS class graduated 171 second lieutenants; 204 men started the 17-week course in July.OCS History Testament to the ability of OCS to produce new second lieutenants quickly can be found in War Department decision that ROTC could not fulfill the national demand for officers; so in May 1943, the advanced course in ROTC was suspended and basic course graduates were immediately sent to OCS so they could be commissioned sooner.Hoya Battalion History During the war, the Army's policy of racial segregation continued among enlisted members; Army training policy, however, provided that blacks and whites would train together in officer candidate schools (beginning in 1942).Women's Army Corps Chapter I \\"The Women's Army Corps, 1942‚Äì1945\\" Integration of the Armed Forces: 1940‚Äì1965 Chapter 2 \\"World War II: The Army\\" Officer Candidate School was the Army's first formal experiment with integration. Black and white candidates shared officer's quarters, with bunkmates assigned alphabetically, regardless of their race, and all of the candidates trained together. Despite this integrated training, in most instances, the graduates would go on to join racially segregated units. Camp Columbia, Australia, showing an integrated population. General Bradley is credited with establishing the format, discipline, and code of honor still used in OCS today. Bradley emphasized rigorous training, strict discipline and efficient organization. These tenets remain the base values of today's Officer Candidate School. Between July 1941 and May 1947, over 100,000 candidates were enrolled in 448 Infantry OCS classes, of these approximately 67 percent completed the course to earn commissions. After World War II, Infantry OCS was transferred to Fort Riley, Kansas, as part of the Ground General School. Due to the post-war downsizing of the Army and the declining need for new Officers, all but Infantry OCS was closed. Finally, on 1 November 1947, it was deactivated. The final class graduated only 52 second lieutenants. The Women's Army Auxiliary Corps (WAAC) was created by an act of Congress on 14 May 1942, permitting them to serve, but not as Soldiers. At that time, women did not have military status and were not integrated into the Army. Their ranks, pay, and benefits were different than the Army, along with all administration. But, being a military organization that was modeled after, and parallel, to the Army, it required a way to train Officers; therefore it created its own WAAC OCS, which stood up on 20 July 1942 at Fort Des Moines, Iowa. The course was six-weeks long, its first-class consisting of 440 candidates. Upon graduation, the women were commissioned as third officers (equivalent to a second lieutenant). It is worth noting, that among the first candidates were 40 black women. Initially, black women were segregated, but in keeping with Army policies, integrating officer training, and with pressure from the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), by November 1942, they were being trained in integrated units. Cold War 1st Officer Candidate Battalion, 2nd Student Regiment With the outbreak of the Korean War, and the Army's rapid expansion in response, the shortage of on-hand officers, and projected commissions, caused the Department of the Army to re-open Infantry OCS at Ft. Benning on 18 February 1951. The course was lengthened from 17 to 22 weeks, as a result of lessons learned from WWII; thus permitting more instruction in Infantry tactics. The Infantry Officer Candidate School became the 1st Officer Candidate Battalion, 2nd Student Regiment. The strength of OCS rapidly increased. As one of eight branch programs, Infantry OCS included as many as 29 companies with a class graduating every week. During the Korean War, OCS commissioned approximately 7,000 Infantry officers. In April 1949, the U.S. Army established the Women's Army Corps Officer Candidate School at Fort Lee, Virginia. The WAC, an active component of the regular Army, a descendant of the WAAC, operated this OCS for female candidates seeking to enter the WAC Officer Corps. The \\"wash-out\\" rate was nearly identical to the men's programs, at roughly 37%, during its first four years; an alarming statistic to observers of both programs.\\"Chapter V: Officer Procurement and Career Development\\" Women's Army Corps By 1954 WAC OCS had been closed and merged with a commissioning program for female direct commissions, due to the low numbers of women attending the WAC OCS course, due in part to tightened standards for selection ‚Äì in response to investigations of the washout rates. On 4 August 1953, the Department of the Army reduced OCS from eight to three programs: Infantry, Artillery, and Engineer, finally closing Engineer OCS in July 1954, leaving only the Infantry and Field Artillery schools open. With the onset of the Vietnam War, however, the OCS program was again expanded with officer candidates undergoing a grueling 23-week program of instruction with an extremely high attrition rate which was designed to prepare young officers to be platoon leaders in a demanding Vietnam jungle environment. In September 1965, Engineer OCS reopened at Fort Belvoir, Virginia, and before closing for good in 1971, over 10,000 Engineer Officers had been commissioned. As the war in Korea edged into 1953, several classes of Infantry School OCS students were given the authorization to transfer to the Medical Service Corps upon graduation. These selected officers (with previous medical experience) were assigned to Korea (after a short training course at Brooke Army Medical Center in San Antonio, Texas), with the explicit duty of trying to keep the direct inductee Medical Officers alive. This was necessary because of the shortage of medical officers and the lack of combat preparation training provided to them after their direct induction into the Army and their immediate assignment to Korea. At the height of the Vietnam War, Infantry OCS produced 7,000 officers annually from five student battalions, all located at Ft. Benning. Also, during the war, a female OCS was once again established; it was stood up at Fort McClellan, Alabama, as part of the WAC Center and School. Other OCS programs were located at Fort Gordon, Georgia (Signal Corps); Fort Sill, Oklahoma (Artillery), Fort Lee, Virginia (Quarter Master), Fort Eustis, Virginia (Transportation), Fort Knox, Kentucky (Armor), Fort Belvoir, Virginia (Engineer) and Aberdeen Proving Ground, Maryland (Ordnance). In April 1973, a branch immaterial OCS was established at Fort Benning, ending the Infantry and Field Artillery based courses. In 1976, with the end of the gender-separate Army, the women's OCS was merged with the branch immaterial male course, creating a program very similar to the modern OCS. The United States Military Academy at West Point, New York, also admitted its first female cadets in 1976. However, due to the length of instruction there (4 years), the newly gender-integrated Officer Candidate School had the distinction of commissioning a female second lieutenant before USMA.  List of Historical OCS Programs  * Anti-Aircraft Artillery (Fort Davis, Virginia) [March, 1942 ‚Äì January, 1944] The Anti-Aircraft Artillery School was moved to Fort Bliss in October, 1944. * Anti-Aircraft Artillery (Fort Bliss, Texas) [October, 1951 ‚Äì May, 1952] * Armor (Fort Knox, Kentucky) [July 1966 ‚Äì February 1968] From July 1966 to February 1968 the program was a dedicated Armor OCS. Previously it had been a Branch Immaterial OCS course * Army Air Forces (Miami Beach, Florida) [February 1942 ‚Äì June 1944] Moved to San Antonio, Texas in June 1944 then moved to Maxwell Field, Alabama in June 1945. * Branch Immaterial (Fort Knox, Kentucky) [December, 1965 ‚Äì September, 1966] \\"When the Nation Called a Third Time - Army Officer Candidate School at Fort Knox, Kentucky: The Vietnam Era\\" Fort Knox briefly ran a Branch Immaterial course that trained officers for the Armor, Quartermaster, Transportation, or Ordnance Corps. Classes performed Phase I (13-week basic officer's training) at Fort Knox and transferred together to complete Phase II (10-week advanced officer training course) at either Fort Lee (Quartermaster), Fort Eustis (Transportation), or Aberdeen Proving Ground (Ordnance Corps). Class 9-66 candidates who completed Phase I could pick between the Armor, Quartermaster, Transportation, or Ordnance Corps Phase II. Classes 14‚Äì66, 18‚Äì66, 22‚Äì66, and 24-66 performed both Phases I and II at Fort Knox and were Armor Corps officers. * Branch Immaterial (Fort Benning, Georgia) [April 1973 ‚Äì present] Creates general-purpose commissioned officers in the place of the previous specialized programs. * Coastal Artillery (Fort Monroe, Virginia) [1941 ‚Äì 1944] Split into the Coastal Artillery OCS at Fort Monroe and the Anti- Aircraft Artillery OCS at Fort Davis in March, 1942. * Engineers (Fort Belvoir, Virginia) [July, 1941 ‚Äì December, 1946; August, 1953 ‚Äì July, 1954; November, 1965 ‚Äì January, 1971]. * Field Artillery (Fort Sill, Oklahoma) [July 1941 ‚Äì December 1946; February 1951 ‚Äì July 1973] * Infantry (Fort Benning, Georgia) [1941 ‚Äì 1945; 1951 ‚Äì 1973] * Infantry (Fort Riley, Kansas) [1945 ‚Äì 1947] * Noncommissioned Officer Candidate Course (NCOC) (Fort Benning, Georgia) [1967 ‚Äì 1972] * Ordnance Corps (Aberdeen Proving Ground, Maryland) [1940 ‚Äì 1945; 1950 ‚Äì 1962] From 1962 to 1985 the Ordnance Corps was disestablished and its functions absorbed by the Army Materiel Command. The Ordnance Branch was placed under the AMC's Logistics Branch. * Ordnance Branch (Aberdeen Proving Ground, Maryland) [1962-1973] From 1962 to 1985 the Ordnance Corps was disestablished and its functions absorbed by the Army Materiel Command. The Ordnance Branch was placed under the AMC's Logistics Branch. * Quartermaster Corps (Fort Lee, Virginia) [July 1966 ‚Äì February 1968] * Signal Corps (Fort Gordon, Georgia) [1966 ‚Äì February 1968] * Transportation Corps (Fort Eustis, Virginia) [1966 ‚Äì February, 1968] * Women's Army Corps (Fort Des Moines, Iowa) [1941 ‚Äì 1946] * Women's Army Corps (Fort Lee, Virginia) [1949 ‚Äì 1954] * Women's Army Corps Center and School (Fort McClellan, Alabama) [1954 ‚Äì 1976] Training OCS Candidates preparing for a mission on a \\"terrain model\\". Today, Officer Candidate school is offered in two ways. Active duty OCS is a 12-week-long school, taught \\"in residence\\" at Ft. Benning, Georgia. Its primary purpose is to commission Second Lieutenants into the U.S. Army, U.S. Army Reserve and Army National Guard. Active duty The Army's Officer Candidate School is programmed to teach basic leadership and Soldier tasks, using the Infantry battle drills found in Army Field Manual 3‚Äì21.8 as a framework for instruction and evaluation of leadership potential. A total of 71 tasks are taught and tested while at OCS. A candidate should expect to be under constant observation and evaluation by their cadre. Mental and emotional stress is induced through a variety of controlled methods, to test problem- solving and moral resolve. Additionally, the course is meant to be physically demanding, with numerous tactical road marches, timed runs of varying distance from 2 miles to 5 miles, and Army Combatives training. Beginning with the first class of FY 2008, the calendar length of OCS was shortened from 14 weeks to 12 weeks, thus allowing for more classes to be conducted each fiscal year, thereby raising the maximum capacity of the school to train Second Lieutenants to meet future commissioning needs as the Army grows. The current capacity of each class that is conducted is limited to 160 Officer Candidates.U.S. Army Maneuver Center of Excellence: Officer Candidate School (OCS), Administrative Information: History . Retrieved 1 November 2016. Officer Candidate School is conducted in three phases: Basic Phase, Intermediate Phase, and Senior phase. Students are referred to as either Basic Officer Candidates (BOCs), Intermediate Officer Candidates (IOCs), or Senior Officer Candidates (SOCs) as their classes progress. Initially, upon arrival, the candidates will in- process with HHC and compete via Physical Fitness test to enter an OCS company. Candidates should expect to arrive at Ft. Benning in top physical condition as the cutoff has historically been an APFT score of 240‚Äì270. Once assigned to a class, the candidates have virtually no privileges and enter into a highly controlled environment similar to Basic Training, although they are expected to act like leaders and take charge and responsibility immediately. As they progress through the course, they may earn some limited privileges. Their bearing, deportment, and behavior, both individually and collectively, will affect the return of their privileges.Academics: OSC SOP , Chapter 1. Orientation, Para, 1-4 Course Overview, Subpara. b. Program of Instruction (POI) (p.6) as well as parts of Chapters 2 through 6. Basic Officer Candidates (BOCs) are identified by wearing a Black ascot. The basic phase will test candidates academically as well as physically; all events are scored comprising the Order of Merit (OML) list used for branch selection. The Basic Officer phase culminates with branch selection and transition to the Intermediate phase. The Intermediate Officer Candidates (IOCs) are identified with a light blue ascot. The intermediate phase continues with more difficult academic training as well as field and tactical instruction. Senior Officer Candidates (SOCs) are identified by wearing a white ascot. The senior phase consists of a field environment where students are graded on land navigation, tactics, and leadership; the last phase consists of final exams in academics, physical fitness, peer evaluations, final TAC (Training, Advising, and Counseling) Officer assessments, interviews, and preparation for graduation and follow-on basic officer branch courses. Sometimes, graduates are offered 'walk-on' slots in Fort Benning's Airborne or Air Assault schools since they are under the same higher training command as OCS. In September 2010, OCS implemented a policy of total immersion. This system removes the possibility of candidates earning on- or off-post passes and using their vehicles during the first 6 weeks of school, restricts the consumption of alcohol to 2 designated days during the course, and prohibits students to carry cell phones while in uniform.Academics: OSC SOP , Chapter 5.

Army National Guard The programs at the Army National Guard Regional Training Institutes are offered in two different formats to accommodate reserve component soldiers. The \\"Traditional\\" OCS program is a 16-month course of instruction conducted from April to August of the following year and is broken down into four phases. * Phase Zero ‚Äì is four drill weekends and designed to prepare Officer Candidates for the OCS program. * Phase I ‚Äì is a 15-day annual training period held in the Summer. * Phase II ‚Äì is conducted one weekend per month for a period of 13 months. * Phase III ‚Äì is a final 15-day annual training period, culminating with graduation and commissioning. The Army National Guard also offers an \\"Accelerated\\" OCS program, which is a 56-day, full-time program. The accelerated program is the most physically and mentally demanding program and while the majority of candidates for the accelerated program are already enlisted soldiers, the failure rate is consistently over 40%. Upon successful completion of either Army National Guard OCS program, graduates are eligible for commissioning as a second lieutenant pending federal recognition.Oregon National Guard, Officer Programs, Officer Candidate School (OCS) . Retrieved 2 November 2016. This is normally the only possibility of attaining an officer's commission without the prerequisite of having a bachelor's degree. There are, however, requirements that allow basic qualification for entrance into Officer Candidate School for the Army Reserves. However, as the Army's needs for junior grade officers ebbs and flows, the requirement for a degree may be added as a temporary measure. This will be announced to the force via an Army G1 MILPER message. The Army Regulation (AR) that governs OCS is AR 350‚Äì51. These include having at least 90 credits from an accredited college, approval from the Officer Candidate School board, and falling in the age range of 18 to 41 years.Oregon National Guard, Op. cit., Basic Eligibility Requirements. =Basic Officer Leadership Course (BOLC)= In 2009, the Army streamlined the Officer training pipeline by removing BOLC II and renaming BOLC I to BOLC-A and BOLC III to BOLC-B. Three weeks of training were added to BOLC-B which includes basic soldiering skills such as land navigation and weapons qualification. Thus, three separate schools were combined into two. Today's 'BOLC' was formerly known as the Officer Basic Course (OBC).  Selection  Officer Candidates must pass a series of tests before being accepted into the Officer Candidate School. A prospective Officer Candidate will meet with a recruiter. After the initial interview, the recruiter will decide if the prospective Officer Candidate should move forward in the process. It is up to the individual recruiter to decide if a prospective Officer Candidate can pass the OCS program successfully and is worth the time and effort it takes to submit a packet for OCS. After completing the initial interview the prospective Officer Candidate will take the ASVAB and need to make at least a 110 GT score. The prospective candidate then must complete a short essay about why they want to be an Army Officer, provide identification (usually a birth certificate and Social Security card), pass a background check, provide a minimum of 3 letters of recommendation, and complete a physical medical exam. After successful completion of these steps, the recruiter may then conduct the Officer Candidate through an Army Physical Fitness Test. Upon reaching a score on the test that the recruiter deems to be acceptable (usually in the range of 270 and above), the Officer Candidate will be scheduled to conduct an interview board. The interview board is conducted by three Officers, usually two Captains and headed by a Major. Upon successfully passing the interview board the prospective Officer Candidate is accepted into the program and has a week to sign the contract. The Officer Candidate School Hall of Honor The U.S. Army Officer Candidate School Hall of Honor was established in 1958 to honor Infantry Officer graduates of the Officer Candidate School Program who distinguished themselves in military or civilian pursuits. In 2002, it was opened to graduates from all U.S. Army Officer Candidate Schools from across the history of the U.S. Army. It is hosted at the National Infantry Museum in Columbus, Georgia, which also hosts the U.S. Army Ranger Hall of Honor.  Officer Candidate School Hall of Fame  Among the OCS Hall of Honor exhibits include the OCS Hall of Fame. It features over 2,000 inductees whom's biographies and portraits can be explored in a digital kiosk. Selection and induction into the Hall of Fame is not guaranteed and is based on several criteria. The inductee may be commissioned from any active component Army OCS program and must have accomplished at least one of the following: * Awarded the Medal of Honor * Attained the rank of Colonel while serving on active duty or the reserves. * Elected or appointed to an office of prominence in the national or state government. * Achieved national or state recognition for outstanding service to the nation. * Attained an exceptional wartime service record. =Notable Members of the Hall of Fame= There are over two thousand inductees; a few representative examples are listed here: OCS Hall of Fame FT Benning Georgia, 2019 *Hugh J.

They ruled the Principality of Svaneti from the 1720s to 1857. History Although the Dadeshkeliani themselves claimed the descent from the Shamkhal dynasty of Tarki, in Dagestan,Toumanoff, Cyril (1963). Studies in Christian Caucasian History, p. 270. Washington DC: Georgetown University Press. historic evidence shows that they were spun off from the House of Gelovani, a princely dynasty of Svaneti known since the 11th century.Note that Gelovani and Dadeshkeliani share the same coat of arms under, confirming the Gelovani connection (Imperial Russia). One princess of the Gelovani family is said to have survived the destruction of her clan by the princes Dadiani, who usurped the Principality of Svaneti in the mid-17th century, and to have fled to Kabarda in the North Caucasus. Her eldest son, called Dadesh, married into a local princely family and his name was later transformed into a separate family name locally pronounced as Dadeshkeliani. His descendants were able to return to Svaneti to reclaim the domain from the Dadiani, attaining to the principate of Svaneti in the 1720s for the second time. Brothers of Constantine Dadeshkeliani: Tsiokh (Mikhail), Tengis (Nicholas), and Isami (1850s). Since then, the Gelovani ruled the Lower Svaneti, whilst the Dadeshkelian - the Upper Svaneti. In the 1820s, the Principality of Svaneti effectively split into two as a result of a blood feud between the rival Dadeshkeliani branches. Through the mediation by the princes of Mingrelia, both branches accepted nominal Russian suzerainty in 1833. Nevertheless, they continued to run their affairs independently and did not allow Russian officials or church missions into the area until the late 1840s. Continuing dynastic strife among the Dadishkeliani, their defiance to the Russian government, and vacillation during the Crimean War (1854-1856), however, led to direct Russian intervention. In 1857, Prince Alexander Baryatinsky, Viceroy of the Caucasus, ordered Svaneti to be subdued by armed force. The prince of Svaneti, Constantine, chose to negotiate, but was ordered into exile to Erivan. On a farewell audience in Kutaisi, he quarreled with a local Russian administrator, Alexander Gagarin, and stabbed to death him and three of his staff. When captured, Constantine was summarily tried by court martial and shot. In 1858, the principality was abolished and converted into a district administered by a Russian-appointed officer (pristav). Several members of the Dadeshekeliani family were exiled to the remote Russian provinces and those who remained in Georgia were deprived of their privileges of autonomous princes.Lang, David Marshall (1962), A Modern History of Georgia, pp. 96-97.

In North America, infection by Ribeiroia has been linked to amphibians with limb malformations. The connection between parasitic infection and limb malformations has generated questions about (a) whether parasite-induced malformations in amphibians are increasing (see ), and (b) the consequences of such abnormalities for amphibian population conservation (see ).  Ribeiroia taxonomy  Ribeiroia is a genus of parasites in the class Trematoda, phylum Platyhelminthes. Currently three species and one subspecies of Ribeiroia are recognized: R. ondatrae in North America, R. marini in the Caribbean, R. m. guadeloupensis on the Caribbean island of Guadeloupe, and R. congolensis in Africa (Johnson et al. 2004). The trematode Cercaria lileta is also closely related to Ribeiroia, and molecular sequence data indicates that it may be a species of Ribeiroia (Johnson et al. 2004). All species of Ribeiroia share the distinctive morphological characteristic of esophageal diverticula (i.e., two short dead- end branches that extend laterally from the esophagus). Other genera closely related to Ribeiroia include Cladocystis trifolium, Cathemasia, and Echinostoma (Johnson et al. 2004). See Johnson et al. (2004) for more details on morphological and ecological differences as well as phylogenetic relationships between these species.  Life cycle  Ribeiroia ondatrae has an indirect complex life cycle.Beaver 1939; Basch and Sturrock 1969; Johnson et al. 2004 The adult worms live inside predatory birds or mammals (the definitive hosts), wherein they reproduce sexually if other worms are present. Mature adults release eggs into the host‚Äôs intestinal tract, which are passed with the feces of the host, and to develop need to end up in water. The eggs typically develop in 2‚Äì3 weeks,Beaver 1939; Basch and Sturrock 1969; Johnson et al. 2004 but the time varies depending on water temperature. Eggs hatch into miracidia, a ciliated free-living parasite stage, which infect the first intermediate host, ram‚Äôs horn snails in the family Planorbidae, colonizing the snail‚Äôs reproductive tissue and eventually forming rediae, a slow-moving worm- like parasite stage. The rediae reproduce asexually, castrating the snail as they feed on its reproductive tissue. The infection becomes mature in about six weeks, when the rediae within the snail begin to release a second free- swimming stage called cercariae. The key identifying characteristic of Ribeiroia ondatrae cercariae is the bifurcated esophagus (although this trait can occur in some closely related genera such as Cladocystis trifolium). Cercariae infect amphibians or fish (the second intermediate hosts) wherein they encyst in (with amphibians) the limb buds or (with fish) along the lateral line and scales of the head, body and gills. Encysted cercariae become metacercariae, a dormant parasite stage with a thin outer membrane. Metacercariae resemble cercariae without their tails and do not reproduce. The definitive hosts (birds and mammals) become infected when they consume an amphibian or fish that has encysted metacercariae. The life cycle is completed when the metacercariae emerge from their cyst and attach to the definitive host‚Äôs intestinal tract and develop into adults, typically in the proventriculus of birds and the stomach of mammals.Johnson et al. 2004  Infection and amphibian malformations  Pacific tree frog with limb malformation induced by Ribeiroia ondatrae  Laboratory studies  Experimental exposure to Ribeiroia ondatrae cercariae has been shown to cause limb malformations in various frog, toad and salamander species, including Pseudacris regilla, Anaxyrus boreas, Lithobates pipiens, A. americanus, Ambystoma macrodactylum, L. clamitans and L. sylvatica.Johnson et al. 1999; 2001; 2006; Stopper et al. 2002; Schotthoefer et al. 2003; Johnson and Hartson 2009 Cercariae appear to prefer to infect in and around the developing limb buds of larval amphibians, which can alter or inhibit limb development. The risk of malformation and mortality varies as a function of parasite exposure level, host development stage, and the amphibian species involved. As expected for macroparasitic infections, a dose-dependent relationship exists between cercariae exposure and pathology, particularly among larval amphibians at pre- or early-limb development stage.Schotthoefer et al. 2003 Cercarial penetration of host tissue involves proteolytic enzymes. The exact mechanism which alters limb development is unknown, but potential pathways include mechanical disturbance by invading parasites, release of a teratogenic chemical by parasites, or a combination of the two.Johnson et al. 1999; Stopper et al. 2002 Susceptibility to infection and the subsequent pathology differs among amphibian species. For example, gray tree frogs (Hyla versicolor) are largely resistant to infection, but toads (e.g. A. americanus) exhibit high frequencies of mortality and malformations following parasite exposure (Johnson and Hartson 2009). The types of limb malformations also vary among species and developmental stage of exposure. The most common errors in development associated with Ribeiroia exposure are skin webbings (cutaneous fusion), missing limbs and limb elements (ectromelia and hemimelia), supernumerary limbs and digits (polymelia and polydactyly), and bony triangles. The factors determining variation in susceptibility among species remain poorly understood. However these observations suggest that the type of malformation alone is unlikely to be diagnostic of Ribeiroia exposure.  Field studies  Ribeiroia infection has been linked to malformations in naturally occurring amphibian populations, especially in the western and midwestern US.reviewed in Johnson et al. 2010 In a large-scale study in the western US, both the presence and abundance of Ribeiroia infection predicted higher-than-baseline (e.g. >5%) frequencies of abnormalities in one or more amphibian species.Johnson et al. 2002 Limb malformations were observed in nine species and ranged in frequency from <5% to nearly 90%. The role of Ribeiroia in explaining accounts of amphibian malformations in other regions is varied; Ribeiroia has been associated with malformation \\"hotspots\\" in the midwestern and northeastern US,Kiesecker 2002; Lannoo et al. 2003; Sutherland 2005; Johnson and Hartson 2009 but it was not detected in malformation surveys from Vermont, Alaska, Bermuda, and Michigan.Gilliland and Muzzall 2002; Bacon et al. 2006; Skelly et al. 2007; Reeves et al. 2008  Geographic distribution  Ribeiroia ondatrae is widely distributed across the US, including records from 22 species in 37 states (Johnson and McKenzie 2008). Most records of Ribeiroia-associated malformations have been reported from California, Oregon, Washington, Montana, Minnesota, Wisconsin, New Jersey and Pennsylvania. Less is known about the distribution of Ribeiroia in Canada and Central America. In amphibians, both the abundance of the parasite and the number of observations appear to correlate positively with major bird migratory flyways, with concentrations along the Pacific, Mississippi, and Atlantic flyways (Johnson et al. 2010). This observation suggests definitive (bird) host activity is an important determinant of parasite distribution at the continental scale, but this hypothesis has yet to be rigorously tested. Ribeiroia ondatrae is most often recovered from amphibians in lentic habitats, such as ponds, lakes, and wetlands, which support planorbid snails. Other species of Ribeiroia occur in the Caribbean and South America (R. marini and R. marini guadeloupensis) and in Africa (R. congolensis). However, whether these species infect amphibians or cause limb malformations has not been explored.  Evidence for emergence  Dating back over 200 years, there have been reports of amphibian malformations suggesting that the general phenomenon is not a new occurrence in amphibian populations (Ouellet 2000). Despite the historical occurrence of amphibian malformations, the real question is whether such malformations are increasing in prevalence and severity in wild amphibian populations. Limited historical data on malformations and the absence of baseline malformation data has complicated attempts to assess whether malformations are emerging. However, research over the past decade has shown that malformations are emerging in some amphibian populations. For example, the background rate of malformations of northern leopard frogs in Minnesota increased from 0.4% in 1958‚Äì1963 to 2.5% in 1996‚Äì1997 (Hoppe 2000), with recently observed malformations more severe and more diverse. Similarly, Johnson and Lunde (2005), in a comparison of recent (1990‚Äì2000) and historical (1899‚Äì1989) publications, found that recent reports document: # a wider range of more severe malformations, # a greater number of affected amphibian species, # a larger number of affected sites, and # a higher frequency range of affected individuals at reported sites. For both of these studies, however, the mechanisms driving the apparent increase in malformations were not identified (see Factors influencing emergence). In a more rigorous study, Johnson et al. (2003) confirmed that historical malformations at six of eight sites (1947‚Äì1990) were associated with Ribeiroia infection. Moreover, three of these sites continued to support limb malformations at frequencies of 7-50% in one or more species. One pond in particular (Jette Pond in western Montana) showed increased prevalence of malformations in Pseudacris regila from 20% in 1960 to 46% in 2000, which was correlated with an increased intensity of Ribeiroia infection. Although more research is necessary, these studies provide evidence that malformations, especially those linked to Ribeiroia infection, are emerging in some amphibian populations.  Factors influencing infection  Nutrients - Nitrogen and phosphorus enrichment are widespread forms of anthropogenic environmental change that may influence parasite infection (Johnson and Carpenter 2008). Nutrient enrichment leads to eutrophication, which has been linked with emergence of Ribeiroia ondatrae through direct and indirect effects on aquatic food webs (Johnson and Chase 2004). The underlying mechanism through which eutrophication can increase infection involves increasing the density of infected first-intermediate snail hosts and by increasing the production of parasites by infected snails (Johnson et al. 2007). Pesticides - Pesticides are still considered a potential factor influencing amphibian malformations (Johnson et al. 2010). However, recent investigations have focused on the interaction of pesticides with parasite infection (Kiesecker 2002; Rohr et al. 2008). Field experiments indicated a link between agricultural run-off and increased infection (Kiesecker 2002). Laboratory studies further demonstrated that pesticide exposure reduced host immunocompetence against parasites as the biological mechanism (Kiesecker 2002). Furthermore, there may be a link between nutrient addition and pesticide contamination jointly leading to increased infections by simultaneously increasing exposure and suppressing host immune systems (Rohr et al. 2008a, b). Biodiversity - Host species diversity and community structure have been suggested to influence disease dynamics through a hypothesis termed the ‚Äòdilution effect‚Äô (Ostfeld and Keesing 2000). For Ribeiroia ondatrae, host species differences in susceptibility can influence infection patterns in multi-species communities (Johnson et al. 2008, Johnson and Hartson 2009). As a result, more diverse larval amphibian communities that include species with differing susceptibilities can alter parasite infection success and the resulting pathology in sensitive host species. For instance, larval toads (a sensitive species) raised experimentally alongside larval gray treefrogs (a resistant species) exhibited 37% less infection and fewer malformations (Johnson et al. 2008).  Parasite-induced malformations and amphibian conservation  Perhaps the most unexplored, complex and vital aspects of trematode-caused amphibian malformations are the population-level consequences. Do these parasites and the malformations they induce pose a conservation risk? While no direct evidence linking trematode deformities and amphibian population declines exists, there are legitimate reasons for concern (Johnson and McKenzie 2008). For instance, in multiple species of frogs and toads, laboratory studies show that even low levels of Ribeiroia infection can induce 30-95% mortality (see Johnson et al. 2010). Correspondingly, multi-year field studies show that in localities of high infection and malformations in metamorphosing frogs, <2% of amphibians returning to breed exhibit malformations, suggesting Ribeiroia infection and malformations have deleterious consequences for individual survival and fecundity (Johnson et al. 2001). In specific wetlands that have historically exhibited a high prevalence of infection and malformations, several amphibian species have notably declined or disappeared (see Johnson and McKenzie 2008 for review). In light of these data, and the increasing evidence that Ribeiroia infections are on the rise (Johnson and McKenzie 2008), it is prudent to treat Ribeiroia ondatrae as a threat to amphibian populations and diversity, particularly in combination with other stressors.

Founded by Ariel Sharon in 1977 prior to elections that year, it merged into Likud immediately after the Knesset term began. Background During the 1940s and 1950s, Sharon was a supporter of Mapai, the dominant left-wing party in Israel, and the predecessor of the modern Labor Party. However, he was instrumental in establishing Likud in July 1973 by uniting most of the right-wing parties in the country; Gahal, the Free Centre, the National List and the Movement for Greater Israel. Sharon was elected to the Knesset in the December 1973 elections on Likud's list, but retired from the Knesset just under a year later. From June 1975 to March 1976, Sharon was a special aide to Alignment Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin. However, with the 1977 elections looming, Sharon tried to return to the Likud and replace Menachem Begin at the head of the party. He suggested to Simkha Erlikh, who headed the Liberal Party bloc in the Likud, that he was more fitting than Begin to win an election victory, but he was rejected. Following this he tried to join the Alignment and then the centrist Dash, but was turned down by both. After his triple snub, Sharon resorted to forming his own party, Shlomtzion. The new party won two seats in the election, taken by Sharon and Yitzhak Yitzhaky. However, the party ceased to exist when it merged into Likud on 5 July 1977, and Sharon was made Minister of Agriculture. In 1980, Yitzhaky broke away from Likud to form his own party, One Israel.

Overview Third marks the most major of Soft Machine's several shifts in musical genre over their career, completing their transition from psychedelic music to jazz, and is a significant milestone of the Canterbury scene, featuring interplay between the band's personnel: Mike Ratledge on keyboards, Robert Wyatt on drums, Hugh Hopper on bass and newest member Elton Dean on saxophone. Lyn Dobson appears on saxophone and flute on \\"Facelift\\", recorded while he was a full member of the band (then a quintet), although he is credited as an additional performer. Jimmy Hastings (brother of Pye Hastings from Caravan) makes substantial contributions on flute and clarinet on \\"Slightly All the Time\\", free-jazz violinist Rab Spall (then a bandmate of Wyatt's in the part-time ensemble Amazing Band) is heard on the coda to \\"Moon in June\\", and Nick Evans (a member of the band during its short-lived septet incarnation) makes brief appearances on trombone in \\"Slightly All the Time\\" and \\"Out-Bloody-Rageous\\". In the Q & Mojo Classic Special Edition Pink Floyd & The Story of Prog Rock (2005), the album came #20 in its list of \\"40 Cosmic Rock Albums\\".Q Classic: Pink Floyd & The Story of Prog Rock, 2005. Recording The original release of Third had an unpolished sound quality, including tape hiss on the live recordings and abrupt editing. \\"Slightly All the Time\\" and \\"Out-Bloody-Rageous\\" are the most straightforward tracks on the album, representing the jazz-rock sound that would be explored further on subsequent albums. \\"Facelift\\" is the most radical track. The version on the album was recorded live at the Fairfield Halls, Croydon, 4 January 1970 (the first by the quintet version of the band), with a brief section from the Mothers Club, Birmingham, 11 January 1970, and some recordings from the 1969 Spaced project. While a large part of the finished product is essentially a live recording, parts involve tape collage and speeding up, slowing down, looping and backwards playing of tapes, the ending being the most memorable part, where two different treatments of the same basic riff (one from the live concert, the other, at double speed, from Spaced) are heard simultaneously, backwards. At the time of the 5-piece line- up, \\"Facelift\\" was typically expanded with solo improvisations and showcases by Lyn Dobson on flute, vocals and harmonica. \\"Slightly All the Time\\" is a medley of different instrumental pieces, including Ratledge's \\"Backwards\\" and Hopper's \\"Noisette\\". \\"Backwards\\" later appeared on fellow Canterbury Scene band Caravan's 1973 album For Girls Who Grow Plump in the Night, as part of the \\"A-Hunting We Shall Go\\" medley. \\"Moon in June\\" is the last song with lyrics that Soft Machine recorded, and their last look back to their progressive rock, pre-jazz sound. The song is in three parts. The first is a pastiche of vocal themes delivered in a stream of consciousness which varied in live performances. Wyatt plays all the instruments in this section. The lyrics borrow from Soft Machine's earlier \\"That's How Much I Need You Now\\" and \\"You Don't Remember\\",Soft Machine ‚Äì \\"Jet Propelled Photograph\\" LP but largely from new vignettes recorded in a demo by Wyatt in October 1968 while on holiday in New York state. An excerpt from a different demo of Part 1, recorded in November 1968, was included on Robert Wyatt's 2001 Flotsam Jetsam archive compilation.Robert Wyatt, Flotsam & Jetsam, Rough Trade Records, #3112, 1994 The second part features the whole band, and is an instrumental similar to other jazz-rock pieces on the album. The third is a drone featuring Wyatt and violinist Rab Spall; Spall's part was recorded separately and was sped up and slowed down to make the violin fit the beats of the music. This section also features Wyatt scat singing uncredited renditions of two Kevin Ayers songs: \\"Singing a Song in the Morning\\" and \\"Hat Song\\". A demo of the second and third parts was recorded in Spring 1969, which was spliced onto the October 1968 demo to be included on Soft Machine's 2002 Backwards archival release. A live recording from 24 May 1970 in London was released on Backwards, containing a shortened version of parts 2 and 3. A pre-Third performance that includes a shortened instrumental Part 1 was recorded live at the Fairfield Halls concert and appears on Soft Machine's 2000 Noisette archive release. \\"Out-Bloody-Rageous\\", the final song on the album, is an instrumental composed by Ratledge, and contains a number of tape loops inspired by the work of Terry Riley. Its name inspired the names of the 2005 Soft Machine biography Soft Machine: Out-Bloody-Rageous, and a 2 CD anthology from 2005 entitled Out-Bloody-Rageous An Anthology 1967‚Äì1973. Reissues In 2007 the album was re-issued on CD by Sony BMG with a second disc comprising a complete live album, Live at the Proms 1970, which had been previously released by a small independent company called Reckless Records in 1988. This album was recorded at The BBC Proms in the Royal Albert HallBBC Proms archive on 13 August 1970. The band's performance, opening for the BBC Symphony Orchestra, marked the first time that a popular-music band played at the classical festival. The disparity of Soft Machine's concert as compared to the hall's usual fare is explained by Robert Wyatt on the Reckless album's liner notes: > We was invited by Tim Souster, who had an evening using the hall to do what > he liked with. I believe he'd heard our second LP, asked us on the strength > of that. He discovered us on the way to discovering Motown. Via the Who, I > think. Anyway it was brave of him to invite us despite the withering > contempt of the posh music establishment. Before our bit, I went out the > back for a quick fag and then the doorman didn't want to let me back in. > \\"I've got to play in there\\", I said. \\"You must be kidding, son\\", he said, > \\"they only have proper music in there\\". Not that night they didn't. :Robert > Wyatt, album liner notes \\"Esther's Nose Job\\" on the bonus disc originally appeared on Volume Two, and no longer includes its cacophonous introduction, but adds a new section, \\"Pigling Bland\\", which appeared as a track on its own on the group's Fifth album a few years later. This version does not contain the lyrics found in the original, but it does include some scat singing from Wyatt. All three pieces on the bonus disc are performed as one continuous suite. (The original vinyl edition had a fade-out and fade-in of the drum solo connecting the second and third pieces, as was necessary for a two-sided LP.) Both discs were re- mastered for the re-issue, improving the sound quality significantly.

After playing for Ferencv√°rosi TC, FC S√®te and Hungary he became a coach, most notably with Graƒëanski Zagreb, MTK Hung√°ria FC, Olympiacos F.C. and Hungary. Together with B√©la Guttmann and Guszt√°v Sebes, he formed a trio of innovative Hungarian coaches who pioneered the 4‚Äì2‚Äì4 formation. Career Bukovi began his coaching career with Graƒëanski Zagreb in 1935, and subsequently guided the club to two Yugoslav and two Croatian league titles. After the Second World War, Graƒëanski was banned and replaced with Dinamo Zagreb and Bukovi remained on as manager of the new club. In 1947 Bukovi was appointed manager of MTK Hung√°ria FC. In 1949 when Hungary became a communist state, MTK were taken over by the secret police, the √ÅVH, and subsequently the club became known as Textiles SE. They then became B√°stya SE, then V√∂r√∂s Lobog√≥ SE and then finally back to MTK. Despite this turmoil, the 1950s proved a successful era for the club and with a team that included P√©ter Palot√°s, N√°ndor Hidegkuti, Mih√°ly Lantos and J√≥zsef Zakari√°s, Bukovi guided them to three Hungarian League titles and a Hungarian Cup. In Olympiacos F.C. Bukovi became a legend for the fans, and wrote history in Greek football by gaining 12 consecutive victories. He transformed Olympiacos and produced many young Greek players. Eventually he was forced to leave the club after a string of poor results in the 1967‚Äì68 season but mainly because of the military regime, labeled as a communist. He was forced to resign on 12 December 1967 and left Greece along with his assistant coach Mih√°ly Lantos on 21 December 1967. Bukovi also played a major role in the success of the legendary Hungary team known as the Mighty Magyars. It was Bukovi, working at MTK with P√©ter Palot√°s and N√°ndor Hidegkuti, who developed the vital 4-2-4 formation, later adopted by national coach Guszt√°v Sebes and exported to Brazil by B√©la Guttmann. This formation involved the use of either Palot√°s or Hidegkuti as a deep lying centre-forward. In 1953 Hidegkuti would exploit this position to great effect as he scored a hat-trick for Hungary when they beat England 6-3 at Wembley Stadium. During the Mighty Magyar era, Bukovi also worked as an assistant to Sebes and in March 1956, when the latter was sacked as national coach, he succeeded him.

Crataiis) is, by some accounts, the mother of Scylla. In Homer's Odyssey, Circe tells Odysseus:Homer, Odyssey 12.124-126. :\\"Nay, row past with all thy might, and call upon Crataiis, the mother of Scylla, who bore her for a bane to mortals. Then will she keep her from darting forth again.\\" (Translation by A. T. Murray) Several authors follow Homer in assigning Crataeis as the mother of Scylla, see Ovid, Metamorphoses 13.749; Apollodorus, E7.20; Servius on Virgil Aeneid 3.420; and schol. on Plato, Republic 588c.Other accounts give other parents for Scylla, for discussions of the parentage of Scylla, see Fowler 2013, p. 32, Ogden, p. 134; Gantz, pp. 731-732; and Frazer's note to Apollodorus, E7.20. Neither Homer nor Ovid mention a father for Scylla, but Apollodorus says that the father was either Trienus (Triton?) or Phorcus (a variant of Phorkys), similarly the Plato scholiast, perhaps following Apollodorus, gives the father as Tyrrhenus or Phorcus, while Eustathius on Homer, Odyssey 12.85 gives the father as Triton. Other authors have Hecate as Scylla's mother. The Hesiodic Megalai Ehoiai gives Hecate and Phorbas as the parents of Scylla,Megalai Ehoiai fr. 262 MW = Most 200. while Acusilaus says that Scylla's parents were Hecate and Phorkys (so also schol. Odyssey 12.85).Acusilaus. fr. 42 Fowler (Fowler, p. 32). Perhaps trying to reconcile these conflicting accounts, Apollonius of Rhodes says that Crataeis was another name for Hecate, and that she and Phorcys were the parents of Scylla.Apollonius of Rhodes, Argonautica 4. 828-829 (pp. 350-351). Likewise, Semos of Delos (FGrHist 396 F 22) says that Crataeis was the daughter of Hecate and Triton, and mother of Scylla by Deimos. Stesichorus (alone) names Lamia as the mother of Scylla, possibly the Lamia who was the daughter of Poseidon,Stesichorus, F220 PMG (Campbell, pp. 132-133). while according to Hyginus, Scylla was the offspring of Typhon and Echidna.Hyginus, Fabulae Preface, 151 .

He served as Archbishop of Utrecht from 1936 until his death, and was elevated to the cardinalate in 1946 by Pope Pius XII. Early life and ordination Johannes de Jong was born in Nes, a village on the island of Ameland, as the eldest of nine children of Jan de Jong, a baker, and his wife Trijntje Mosterman. After attending the minor seminary in Culemborg from 1898 to 1904, de Jong then studied at the Seminary of Rijsenburg for four years. He was ordained to the priesthood on August 15, 1908, and further studied at the Pontifical Gregorian University and the Angelicum in Rome, obtaining his doctorates in philosophy and theology. His two youngest brothers, Julius (1896-1923) and Wiebren (1898-1962) were also priests. Priest De Jong did pastoral work in Amersfoort, including work with the Sisters of Mercy, until 1914, when he was made a professor at the Rijsenburg seminary on November 6. Becoming the seminary's rector on August 14, 1931, he was named a canon of the cathedral of Utrecht in 1933. Bishop and Archbishop On August 3, 1935, de Jong was appointed Coadjutor Archbishop of Utrecht and Titular Archbishop of Rhusium. He received his episcopal consecration on the following September 12 from Bishop Pieter Hopmans, with Bishops Arnold Diepen and Johannes Smit serving as co-consecrators, in St. Catherine's Cathedral. De Jong succeeded Johannes Henricus Gerardus Jansen as Archbishop of Utrecht and thus Primate of the Netherlands. He was also the first archbishop in the Netherlands with a university degree since the restoration of the Dutch Catholic hierarchy in the middle of the 19th century. He said he didn't want to be another Theodor Innitzer, his colleague in Vienna with fascist sympathies. De Jong ordered his priests to refuse the sacraments to Nazi Dutchmen.\\"Pius XII: The Holocaust and the Cold War\\", Michael Phayer, p. 59, Indiana University Press, 2008, During the Second World War, he was one of the major leaders against the Nazi occupation of Netherlands. On July 26, 1942 Dutch bishops, including Archbishop Johannes de Jong, issued a decree that openly condemned Nazi deportations of Dutch workers and Jews. The Nazis retaliated by seizing 245 Catholics of Jewish descent, including Edith Stein. Phayer, The Catholic Church and the Holocaust, p.54 The Vatican used the Netherlands' experience to explain its silence during the years of the Holocaust. Phayer, p.55After the German retaliation, Sister Pasqualina Lehnert, Pius XII's housekeeper and confidante, said the Pope was convinced that while the Bishop‚Äôs protest cost more than two hundred lives, a protest by him would mean at least two hundred thousand innocent lives that he was not ready to sacrifice. While politicians, generals, and dictators might gamble with the lives of people, a Pope could not.NEVER AGAIN AN EXAMINATION OF CATHOLIC-JEWISH RELATIONS IN LIGHT OF THE HOLOCAUST (Trevor Fleck JUPS Senior Thesis Georgetown University April 1, 2006 ).

He became Chief of Engineers of the Army Corps of Engineers, was the first superintendent of United States Military Academy, and was elected to the Fourteenth United States Congress. Biography Williams was born in Boston, Massachusetts and attended Harvard University. Williams, a grandnephew of Benjamin Franklin, in 1779 married Marianne Alexander, a Scottish girl, daughter of William Alexander a friend of Benjamin Franklin.  His stay in Europe  He spent most of the period from 1770 to 1785 in England and France. In January 1777, aged 20, at the suggestion of Silas Deane, Jonathan Williams went to Nantes to keep a close eye on Thomas Morris, who had just taken up the post of commercial agent. Williams was also requit red to inspect shipments of ammunition, uniforms and men, which led him to rent premises and hire staff. He had also \\"to gather information on all subjects that affect American interests.\\" Many people wanted to do business with the Americans; Williams decided to rely mainly on Jean Peltier Dudoyer, a local shipowner. A dispute soon arose. Since France was not officially at war, the Americans asked Peltier Dudoyer to build a ship which, when offshore, would become a corsair. It was the Lion later named Deane. But the atmosphere was detestable, all French landed quickly, including Nicolas Baudin. J. Williams served as arbiter and signed a certificate discharging Peltier Dudoyer. When Morris died, William Lee was sent to France. He had to review and close the accounts and consider Morris‚Äô replacement. Pending a decision of the Congress, J. Williams remained in office. This was the beginning of various problems: there are 4 brothers Lee and a nephew Thomas ... Moreover, Deane departed for the United States and was replaced by John Adams, who did not speak French and began to question Williams‚Äô achievements. The resale of the Drake, seized by John Paul Jones, caused difficulties: J. Williams sold the ship to Schweighauser, a shipowner from Nantes, while American Captain NcNeil wanted to buy it. Finally, after an agreement, the Drake was resold to Peltier Dudoyer \\"on behalf of Mr. de Monthieu\\" on November 20, 1778. The dispute between J. Williams and the Lee family, was settled by a duel in Lorient, June 18, 1779. On that day, Williams, allegedly drunk, insulted Thomas Lee. They met in a room, fired at each other and both fortunately missed.  His return to the United States  Back in the United States, he joined the American Philosophical Society in 1788 and published articles on scientific subjects. President John Adams appointed Williams a major in the Corps of Artillerists and Engineers in February 1801. President Thomas Jefferson upon approval made him the Army's Inspector of Fortifications and assigned him to serve as the first superintendent of West Point in December 1801. The following year Jefferson also appointed him to concurrently command the separate Corps of Engineers established by the Military Peace Establishment Act and Congress and signed by Jefferson on March 16, 1802. He vacated (not resigned) his Superintendent position in 1803 but was reappointed in 1805. In 1802, the investor Richard Woodhull purchased in north Brooklyn and named the area Williamsburgh (later changed to Williamsburg), after Williams, who surveyed the land. From 1807 to 1811 Williams designed and completed construction of Castle Williams (the East Battery) and Castle Clinton (the West Battery) in New York Harbor. Castle Williams was the first casemated battery in the United States. He founded the U.S. Military Philosophical Society and gave it its motto, \\"Science in War is the Guarantee of Peace.\\" He resigned from the Army in July 1812 because the Secretary of War, William Eustis, refused to give him command of Castle Williams, a fortification that he designed and was named after him. At that time, New York State placed him in charge of construction of fortifications for New York City. He eventually returned to Philadelphia and headed a group of volunteer engineers building fortifications around the city when he was elected to the Fourteenth United States Congress from that city in 1814. He died of gout in Philadelphia before the Congress assembled. He was originally buried in Pine Street Cemetery between 4th and 5th Streets in Philadelphia and was re-interred in Laurel Hill Cemetery not far from his home, Mount Pleasant in Fairmount Park, in 1862.

Prior to his show business career, he had served in the British army with Gurkha and special forces units. Early life William Inglis Lindon Travers was born in Newcastle upon Tyne, England, the son of Florence (n√©e Wheatley) and William Halton Lindon Travers, a theatre manager. His sister Linden (1913‚Äì2001), and her daughter Susan, became actresses. War service Major Bill Travers MBE Travers enlisted as a private in the British Army at the age of 18, a few months after the outbreak of the Second World War, and was sent to India (then a British possession British Raj) Travers was commissioned as a 2nd lieutenant in the British Indian Army on 9 July 1942 (from the rank of private). He served in the Long Range Penetration Brigade 4th Battalion 9th Gorkha Rifles in Burma, attached to Orde Wingate's staff, during which service he came to know John Masters, who was his brigade major (Travers was later to act in Bhowani Junction, a tale written by Masters). While deep behind enemy lines, Major Travers was struck by malaria and volunteered to be left behind in a native Burmese village. To avoid capture, he disguised himself as a Chinese national and walked hundreds of miles through jungle territory until he reached an Allied position. In 1945, Travers was promoted to the rank of major, and he joined Force 136 Special Operations Executive and was parachuted into Malaya. Travers was responsible for training and tactical decisions with the main resistance movement, the communist-led Malayan People‚Äôs Anti-Japanese Army (MPAJA). Travers was one of the first allied operatives to enter the Japanese city of Hiroshima after the dropping of the atomic bomb. He wrote about his experience in his diary, registering profound horror at the destruction and loss of life. Major Travers left the armed forces in 1947. On 7 November 1946 Travers was appointed a Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) \\"in recognition of gallant and distinguished service whilst engaged in Special Operations in South East Asia\\". Acting career=Early work Travers got out of the army in 1947 and decided to become an actor.

His best chance to date was in Footsteps in the Fog (1955), starring Stewart Granger and Jean Simmons. Geordie and MGM Travers breakthrough came when he was cast in the title role of Geordie (1955), directed by Frank Launder. This was popular in Britain and the US and saw him contracted by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, which thought he was going to be a big star and brought him to Hollywood. MGM cast him in the expensive epic Bhowani Junction (1956), with Granger and Ava Gardner. He followed this as the romantic lead in a remake of The Barretts of Wimpole Street (1957), opposite Jennifer Jones. Powell and Pressburger wanted him to star in the lead of Ill Met By Moonlight Library login required but the role went to Dirk Bogarde.

MGM tested him for the lead in Ben-Hur (1959) and he wrote a swashbuckler to star himself, The Falcon. Library login required However his MGM films all performed disappointingly at the box office - Barretts and Seventh Sign were notable flops - and enthusiasm for Travers in Hollywood cooled. Travers did \\"A Cook for Mr. General\\" for Kraft Theatre (1958) on TV. Then he returned to Britain. Return to Britain Travers and McKenna starred in a melodrama for the Rank Organisation, Passionate Summer (1958). He tried to get up a war film set in Greenland, The Sledge Patrol, but it does not appear to have been made. Library login required He and Launder tried to repeat the success of Geordie with The Bridal Path (1960), but the film was not a success. Travers did \\"Born a Giant\\" for Our American Heritage (1960) on TV, then returned to Britain where he made a British monster film, Gorgo (1961). Travers and McKenna reteamed on a thriller, Two Living, One Dead (1961).

Library login required Born Free Travers' most famous film role came when he played game warden George Adamson in the highly successful 1966 film Born Free, about which experience the two co-wrote the book On Playing with Lions. He co-starred with McKenna and the experience made him and his wife very conscious of the many abuses of wild animals in captivity that had been taken from Africa and other natural environments around the world. Travers received an offer to play a support role in Duel at Diablo (1967); during filming he broke a leg and dislocated a shoulder. Library login required He played the title role in a British TV version of The Admirable Crichton (1968), alongside his wife, and had a small part in Peter Hall's adaptation of A Midsummer Night's Dream (1968).

Library login required Travers and McKenna made another \\"animal movie\\", Ring of Bright Water (1969) for which he also wrote the script. They followed this with An Elephant Called Slowly (1970), which Travers helped write and produce with James Hill, who directed. In 1969, he played Captain Hook on a stage production of Peter Pan. Library login required Travers worked as an actor only on Rum Runners (1971) with Brigitte Bardot and Lino Ventura. He directed and appeared in a documentary, The Lion at World's End (1971) about Christian the lion. He was reunited with James Hill on The Belstone Fox (1973) and co-wrote a documentary, \\"The Wild Dogs of Africa\\" for The World About Us (1973). He later produced \\"The Baboons of Gombe\\" (1975) for the same show. He and Hill wrote and produced The Queen's Garden (1977) together, and Travers helped produce Bloody Ivory (1980). Final years Travers appeared in \\"Tramps and Poachers\\", an episode of To the Manor Born (1980). In The First Olympics: Athens 1896 (1984) he and McKenna played the parents of Edwin Flack. The importance of animal rights led to Travers and his wife becoming involved in the \\"Zoo Check Campaign\\" in 1984 that evolved to their establishing the Born Free Foundation in 1991. One of his last credits was \\"Highland Fling\\" on Lovejoy (1992). Bill Travers spent his last three years travelling around Europe's slum zoos and a TV documentary that he made exposed the appalling suffering of thousands of animals.

He is best known for his work scoring many episodes of The Simpsons, for which he was the sole composer between 1990 and 2017. Clausen has scored or orchestrated music for more than 30 films and television shows, including Moonlighting, The Naked Gun, ALF and Ferris Bueller's Day Off. Clausen received an Honorary Doctorate of Music from Berklee College of Music in 1996. Personal life Clausen was born in Minneapolis, Minnesota and raised in Jamestown, North Dakota. Clausen was interested in music from a young age. He counts composer Henry Mancini as one of his heroes; his book Sounds and Scores inspired him. He sang in his high school choir and began playing the French horn in the seventh grade (Grade 7) and also learned piano. He continued playing and learned to play the bass guitar, stopping singing because the choir met at the same time as the band. He studied mechanical engineering at North Dakota State University although, after being inspired by his pianist cousin, switched his major to musical theory. Whilst there, Clausen took a correspondence course at Boston's Berklee College of Music in jazz and big band writing. He went on to attend the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison to complete his master's degree, but quit as he disliked the place, especially what he felt was an \\"anti-jazz\\" attitude. He then worked for a period as a musician. He later attended Berklee and graduated with a diploma in arranging and composition in 1966. Clausen was the first French horn player to ever attend the college and took part in many ensembles; he is also featured on some Jazz in the Classroom albums. Clausen taught at Berklee for a year after graduation. His son Scott is also a composer. Career Clausen moved to Los Angeles, California in 1967 in search of television work, wanting to become a full-time composer. For nine years he did some arrangement work for singers, ghostwriting and other composing jobs such as commercial jingles, as well as working as a teacher, music copyist and a bassist. He worked as a copyist on \\"Come On Get Happy\\", the theme song to The Partridge Family. He eventually became a score writer and later the music director and conductor for Donny & Marie between 1976 and 1979. Initially he was requested to write an emergency chart for the following day, but he was hired as a score writer and continued writing and conducting on the show, before replacing Tommy Oliver as music director. When the show moved to Utah, Clausen flew there each week from Los Angeles to record the score. He had the same role on The Mary Tyler Moore Hour in 1979. In 1981 he was nominated for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Achievement In Music Direction for Omnibus. Clausen served as the composer for the series Moonlighting from 1985 to 1989, scoring 63 of the 65 episodes. His favorite episode to score was the episode \\"The Dream Sequence Always Rings Twice\\", which featured two lengthy black and white dream sequences and enjoyed the episode \\"Atomic Shakespeare\\", also a fantasy episode. He received an Emmy nomination for each episode in the category Outstanding Achievement In Music Composition For A Series (Dramatic Underscore) in 1986 and 1987, earning two more nominations over the next two years for the episodes \\"Here's Living with You, Kid\\" and \\"A Womb with a View\\". In 1988 and 1989 he also received nominations for the Emmy for Outstanding Achievement In Music Direction. He was also the composer on ALF from 1986 to 1990. Other television compositions included Wizards and Warriors (1983), Fame (1984), Lime Street (1985), Christine Cromwell (1989) and My Life and Times (1991) as well as the television films Murder in Three Acts (1986), Double Agent (1987), Police Story: The Watch Commander (1988), My First Love (1988), She Knows Too Much (1989) and the feature film Number One with a Bullet (1987). He also conducted the orchestras and, for some, provided additional music for several films including The Beastmaster (1982), Airplane II: The Sequel (1982), Splash (1984), Weird Science (1985), Ferris Bueller's Day Off (1986), Dragnet (1987) and The Naked Gun (1988). The Simpsons and other work Following ALF's conclusion, Clausen was unemployed for seven months. Clausen's friend suggested him to a producer from the Fox animated series The Simpsons who were looking for a new composer. Clausen \\"had no interest in doing animation\\" and \\"wanted to be a drama composer.\\" However, the show's creator Matt Groening told him \\"we don't look upon this as being a cartoon but a drama where the characters are drawn, and we would like it scored that way.\\" Clausen took the job. Groening told Clausen that the \\"emotion [should be] scored first and the action scored second\\", unlike many other cartoons, and that \\"scoring the emotions of the characters\\" was the primary aim for The Simpsons. Clausen's first episode was \\"Treehouse of Horror\\", the third episode of season two, in 1990. It served as an audition and he was hired permanently after that. He has since scored almost all of the music and songs which have appeared on the show, across a wide range of musical styles through the end of the 28th season. He conducted a 35 piece orchestra for the music, a rarity for television shows, and recorded the score for an episode every week. Clausen wrote an episode's score during the week, recorded it on a Friday, with some variation if vocals are required. The limited timeframe proved the most challenging aspect of the job for Clausen; he was once required to write 57 musical cues in one week. For the show's original songs production is much longer; Clausen records the music to the writers' lyrics, over seven or eight months the scene is animated, and then Clausen can re-record the song with a full orchestra. The full orchestra allows easy transition between the wide range of musical styles required for the show. Clausen noted: Clausen intentionally opted against composing themes for each character, with some exceptions such as Mr. Burns, and instead \\"[gives] each story its own theme and thematic development...That approach helps to give each story its own special identification, more like individual mini-movies.\\" He supplements the orchestra with additional instruments, such as extra brass for the episode \\"Cape Feare\\", for which Clausen composed Sideshow Bob's theme, which continued to be played whenever Bob gets out of prison in subsequent episodes. It is based on the score of the movie Cape Fear, composed by Bernard Herrmann.Jean, Al. (2004). Commentary for \\"Cape Feare\\", in The Simpsons: The Complete Fourth Season [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. The musical requests of the writers range from rerecord a specific piece of music to compose something based on this character's emotion in a scene. Clausen has received two Primetime Emmy Awards for his work on The Simpsons, winning the award for Outstanding Individual Achievement in Music and Lyrics two years in a row. The first was for \\"We Put The Spring In Springfield\\" from the 1997 episode \\"Bart After Dark\\", the second was for \\"You're Checkin' In\\" from the 1998 episode \\"The City of New York vs. Homer Simpson\\"; the lyrics of each song were written by Ken Keeler. He has been nominated in the category a further seven times in 1994, 1995, 1996, 2002, 2003, 2004 and 2005. Clausen has also received twelve nominations for Outstanding Individual Achievement in Music Composition for a Series (Dramatic Underscore) between 1992 and 2011 and has twice been nominated for Outstanding Music Direction, in 1997 and 1998. With 30 nominations, Clausen has received more Emmy nominations than any other musician. He has won five Annie Awards for his work on The Simpsons. He won the 1997 award for Best Music in a TV Production, the award for Outstanding Music in an Animated Television Production in 1998, again for \\"You're Checkin' In\\", the same award in 2000 for the episode \\"Behind the Laughter\\", the award for Best Music in an Animated Television Production in 2003 for \\"Dude, Where's My Ranch?\\", and again in 2007 for \\"Yokel Chords\\". His work on the show has been released as part of three albums produced by Clausen: Songs in the Key of Springfield (1997), Go Simpsonic with The Simpsons (1999) and The Simpsons: Testify (2007). Clausen was not asked to score the film adaptation of the show, The Simpsons Movie, with Hans Zimmer getting the job. He noted: \\"sometimes you're the windshield, sometimes you're the bug\\". Whilst working on The Simpsons, Clausen scored The Critic from 1994 to 1995 and Bette in 2000. He also scored the 1998 film Half Baked. He recorded the album Swing Can Really Hang You Up The Most in 2003, comprising the arrangements he made over his career, performed by his jazz orchestra, after self-financing it. In 2011, Clausen was awarded the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers Golden Note Award. ASCAP President Paul Williams said his \\"decades of scores for The Simpsons and other TV programs and films are as endlessly inventive as the imaginations of the shows' writers and animators. It takes a lot of serious work and thought to compose, arrange and conduct such wonderfully happy music.\\" On August 30, 2017, after 27 years of scoring for The Simpsons, it was revealed that Clausen was dismissed from the show, with suggestions that the reasons behind the decision were largely financial. His last complete score was for \\"Dogtown\\". However, following the news of Clausen's departure, the producers of the show stated that he would \\"continue to have an ongoing role in the show.\\" Beginning with Season 29, scoring was taken over by Bleeding Fingers Music, with Clausen credited as \\"Composer Emeritus.\\" He is credited for composing the music for the episode \\"Whistler's Father\\". On August 5, 2019, Clausen announced he is suing the Fox Network for his removal from the show, saying that he was fired due to old age.

It enables users to install scripts that make on-the-fly changes to web page content after or before the page is loaded in the browser (also known as augmented browsing). The changes made to the web pages are executed every time the page is viewed, making them effectively permanent for the user running the script. Greasemonkey can be used for customizing page appearance, adding new functions to web pages (for example, embedding price comparisons within shopping sites), fixing rendering bugs, combining data from multiple web pages, and numerous other purposes.  History  The Greasemonkey project began 28 November 2004, written by Aaron Boodman. Boodman was inspired to write Greasemonkey after looking at a Firefox extension designed to clean up the interface of AllMusic. This extension was written by Adrian Holovaty, who later became a userscript developer. By May 2005, there were approximately 60 general and 115 site-specific userscripts distributed for Greasemonkey. During this time, a Greasemonkey compiler was also developed for converting a userscript into a standalone Firefox extension. Greasemonkey was initially met with complaints by publishers for its ability to block ads. However, this criticism shifted its focus to other addons starting with the 2006 release of Adblock Plus.  Userscripts.org  To accommodate the growing number of scripts, userscripts.org was founded by Britt Selvitelle and other members of the Greasemonkey community in late 2005. Userscripts.org was open sourced in 2007 but the site later moved away from this code base. As the main script repository listed on Greasemonkey's official site, userscripts.org accumulated thousands of scripts per year. In 2010, the last known admin Jesse Andrews posted that the site was in maintenance mode due to lack of time and asked for a new maintainer to volunteer. Nevertheless, he remained the sole admin of the site until a discussion about install counts began on 1 April 2013. Prior to this, many of the \\"most popular scripts\\" as listed by the site had nominal install counts of zero. Over the following year spam scripts became more common, server downtime increased and the install count bug remained. With no further communication by Andrews, userscript writers described the site as neglected and the official Greasemonkey site removed its front page link. In response, script writers and other developers began working on the fork \\"openuserjs.org\\", and later greasyfork.org, as an immediate replacement. In May 2014, userscripts.org became inaccessible on port 80, prompting users to access it on port 8080 instead. In August 2014, the site was shut down completely. Most of its scripts were backed up to the static mirror userscripts-mirror.org where they can now be found.  Technical details  Greasemonkey user scripts are written in JavaScript and manipulate the contents of a web page using the Document Object Model interface. Scripts are generally written to be either page-specific or domain-specific (applying to all pages within a domain) but may also be tagged to apply to all domains for global browser enhancements. Users of Greasemonkey can write or download scripts and save them to their own personal library. When users visit a website matching a script in their personal script library, Greasemonkey invokes the relevant scripts. Greasemonkey scripts can modify a webpage in any way that JavaScript allows, with certain Greasemonkey security restrictions. Scripts can also access other web pages and web services via a non-domain- restricted XMLHTTP request, allowing external content to be merged with the original page content. Scripts are named somename.user.js, and Greasemonkey offers to install any such script when a URL ending in that suffix is requested. Greasemonkey scripts contain metadata which specifies the name of the script, a description, resources required by the script, a namespace URL used to differentiate identically named scripts, and URL patterns for which the script is intended to be invoked or not. Writing a Greasemonkey script is similar to writing JavaScript for a web page, with some additional allowances such as cross-site XMLHttpRequests. Compared to writing a full-fledged Firefox extension, user scripting is a very modest step up in complexity from basic web programming.

Following their victory at Muye, he continued to serve as a Zhou minister. He remained loyal to the regent Duke of Zhou during the Rebellion of the Three Guards; following the Duke's punitive raids against the restive Eastern Barbarians or Dongyi, Jiang was enfeoffed with their territory as the marchland of Qi. He established his seat at Yingqiu (in modern Linzi). Names The first marquis of Qi bore the given name Shang. The nobility of ancient China bore two surnames, an ancestral name and a clan name. His were Jiang and L√º, respectively. He had two courtesy names, Shangfu and Ziya, which were used for respectful address by his peers. The names Jiang Shang and Jiang Ziya became the most common after their use in the popular Ming-era novel Fengshen Bang, written over 2,500 years after his death. Following the elevation of Qi to a duchy, his posthumous name became the , often mistakenly translated as if it were a name (\\"Duke Tai\\").

Taizhou Academy Newspapers (Âè∞Â∑ûÂ≠¶Èô¢Â≠¶Êä•) 2nd semester, 2003. Background The last ruler of the Shang dynasty, King Zhou of Shang, was a tyrannical and debauched slave owner who spent his days carousing with his favourite concubine Daji and mercilessly executing or punishing upright officials and all others who objected to his ways. After faithfully serving the Shang court for approximately twenty years, Jiang came to find King Zhou of Shang insufferable, and feigned madness in order to escape court life and the ruler's power. Jiang was an expert in military affairs and hoped that someday someone would call on him to help overthrow the king. Jiang disappeared, only to resurface in the Zhou countryside at the apocryphal age of seventy-two, when he was recruited by King Wen of Zhou and became instrumental in Zhou affairs. The Seven Military Classics of Ancient China. New York: Basic Books. 2007. p. 27. It is said that, while in exile, he continued to wait placidly, fishing in a tributary of the Wei River (near today‚Äôs Xi'an) using a barbless hook or even no hook at all, on the theory that the fish would come to him of their own volition when they were ready. Hired by King Wen of the Zhou Dai Jin, Dropping a Fishing Line on the Bank of the Wei River, National Palace Museum King Wen of Zhou, (central Shaanxi), found Jiang Ziya fishing. King Wen, following the advice of his father and grandfather before him, was in search of talented people. In fact, he had been told by his grandfather, the Grand Duke of Zhou, that one day a sage would appear to help rule the Zhou state. The first meeting between King Wen and Jiang Ziya is recorded in the book that records Jiang's teachings to King Wen and King Wu, the Six Secret Teachings (Â§™ÂÖ¨ÂÖ≠Èüú / Â§™ÂÖ¨ÂÖ≠Èü¨). The meeting was recorded as being characterized by a mythic aura common to meetings between great historical figures in ancient China. Before going hunting, King Wen consulted his chief scribe to perform divination in order to discover if the king would be successful. The divinations revealed that, \\"'While hunting on the north bank of the Wei river you will get a great catch. It will not be any form of dragon, nor a tiger or great bear. According to the signs, you will find a duke or marquis there whom Heaven has sent to be your teacher. If employed as your assistant, you will flourish and the benefits will extend to three generations of Zhou Kings.'\\" Recognizing that the result of this divination was similar to the result of divinations given to his eldest ancestor, King Wen observed a vegetarian diet for three days in order to spiritually purify himself for the meeting. While on the hunt, King Wen encountered Jiang fishing on a grass mat, and courteously began a conversation with him concerning military tactics and statecraft.\\"T'ai Kung's Six Secret Teachings\\". Trans. Ralph D. Sawyer. In , The Seven Military Classics of Ancient China. New York: Basic Books. 2007. p. 40. The subsequent conversation between Jiang Ziya and King Wen forms the basis of the text in the Six Secret Teachings. When King Wen met Jiang Ziya, at first sight he felt that this was an unusual old man, and began to converse with him. He discovered that this white-haired fisherman was actually an astute political thinker and military strategist. This, he felt, must be the man his grandfather was waiting for. He took Jiang Ziya in his coach to the court and appointed him prime minister and gave him the title Jiang Taigong Wang (\\"The Great Duke's Hope\\", or \\"The expected of the Great Duke\\") in reference to a prophetic dream Danfu, grandfather of Wenwang, had had many years before. This was later shortened to Jiang Taigong. King Wu married Jiang Ziya's daughter Yi Jiang, who bore him several sons. Attack of the Shang After King Wen died, his son King Wu, who inherited the throne, decided to send troops to overthrow the King of Shang. But Jiang Taigong stopped him, saying: \\"While I was fishing at Panxi, I realised one truth ‚Äì if you want to succeed you need to be patient. We must wait for the appropriate opportunity to eliminate the King of Shang\\". Soon it was reported that the people of Shang were so oppressed that no one dared speak. King Wu and Jiang Taigong decided this was the time to attack, for the people had lost faith in the ruler. The bloody Battle of Muye then ensued some 35 kilometres from the Shang capital Yin (modern day Anyang, Henan Province). Jiang Taigong charged at the head of the troops, beat the battle drums and then with 100 of his men drew the Shang troops to the southwest. King Wu's troops moved quickly and surrounded the capital. The Shang King had sent relatively untrained slaves to fight. This, plus the fact that many surrendered or revolted, enabled Zhou to take the capital. King Zhou set fire to his palace and perished in it, and King Wu and his successors as the Zhou dynasty established rule over all of China. As for Daji, one version has it that she was captured and executed by the order of Jiang Taigong himself, another that she took her own life, another that she was killed by King Zhou. Jiang Taigong was made duke of the State of Qi (today‚Äôs Shandong province), which thrived with better communications and exploitation of its fish and salt resources under him. As the most notable Prime Minister employed by King Wen and King Wu, he was declared \\"the master of strategy\\"‚Äîresulting in the Zhou government growing far stronger than that of the Shang Dynasty as the years elapsed. Personal views and historical influence An account of Jiang Ziya's life written long after his time says he held that a country could become powerful only when the people prospered. If the officials enriched themselves while the people remained poor, the ruler would not last long. The major principle in ruling a country should be to love the people; and to love the people meant to reduce taxes and corv√©e labour. By following these ideas, King Wen is said to have made the Zhou state prosper very rapidly. His treatise on military strategy, Six Secret Strategic Teachings, is considered one of the Seven Military Classics of Ancient China. In the Tang Dynasty he was accorded his own state temple as the martial patron and thereby attained officially sanctioned status approaching that of Confucius.

In one legend, he used the knowledge he gained at Kunlun to defeat the Shang's supernatural protectors Qianliyan and Shunfeng'er using the blood of a black dog.. He is also a prominent character in the Ming-era Romance of the Investiture of the Gods, in which he is Daji's archrival and is personally responsible for her execution. There are two xiehouyu about him: *Grand Duke Jiang fishes ‚Äì those who are willing jump at the bait (), which means \\"put one's own head in the noose\\". *Grand Duke Jiang investiture of the gods ‚Äì omitting himself (ÂßúÂ§™ÂÖ¨Â∞ÅÁ•û‚îÄ‚îÄÊºèÂíóËá™Â∑±), which means \\"leave out oneself\\". Manga The protagonist of Hoshin Engi, Taikoubou (Tai Gong Wang), is based on Jiang Ziya. However, his personality is quite comical. Video Games In the scenario \\"Chinese Unification\\" of the Civilization IV: Warlords expansion pack, Jiang Ziya is the leader of the State of Qi. He is also playable in video games Aizouban Houshin Engi, Hoshin Engi 2 and Mystic Heroes. Jiang Ziya is a playable character in Koei's Warriors Orochi 2. In the game, he is alternatively referred to as Taigong Wang. A stark contrast to the historical accounts however, would be that he is portrayed as a handsome young man, who is quite arrogant, although he is still a divinely gifted strategist and a good man at heart. He is often referred to by others, namely Fu Xi, N√ºwa and Daji as \\"boy\\". The reason for his radically improvised design may be to emphasize his rivalry with Daji, whose character design depicts her as being young and beautiful as well. Their clashes are loosely inspired by the Fengshen Yanyi. In Final Fantasy XI, the item \\"Lu Shang's Fishing Rod\\" is awarded to players for catching 10,000 carp. It is noteworthy for its ability to catch both small and large fish, and is notoriously hard to break. In the online game War of Legends, Jiang Ziya is a playable monk, with 45 \\"ability.\\" In the popular game Eiyuu Senki, Tai Gong Wang is one female amongst the ancient heroes player will encounter in the game. In Dragalia Lost, Jiang Ziya is the name of a female Qilin adventurer that is possibly obtainable.

The ward contains the areas of Baptist Mills, Montpelier, St Andrew's, St Paul's and St Werburgh's. The Ward has over 16,000 residents and is served by one community magazine and resident-led organisational body called 'Vocalise'. Politics Ashley is part of the Bristol West parliamentary constituency, which elects one Member of Parliament. The incumbent Member of Parliament is Thangam Debbonaire, of the Labour Party. Ashley sends three councillors to Bristol City Council. Currently, these are Mike Davies and Carole Johnson of the Labour Party, and Jude English of the Green Party. All three councillors were elected in May 2016. The MP was re- elected in the UK General Election in December 2019. Baptist Mills Baptist Mills is a small area of Bristol, located between St Werburghs and Easton. It was home to a brass works between 1700 and 1840, and a pottery between 1840 and 1891. The area is now often regarded as part of St Werburghs. In the 19th century, part of Baptist Mills was also known as Botany Bay and regarded as a fairly lawless area. Montpelier 'The Arches' railway bridge is a local landmark on the borders of Montpelier, St Andrews and Cotham. Montpelier is an area of North Bristol. It is bounded by Cheltenham Road to the west, St Paul's to the south, St Werburgh's to the east and St Andrew's to the north. It has its own railway station, and a reputation as bohemian. Picton Street is a haven for lovers of organic and vegetarian cuisine. Previously, Montpelier was carved by French prisoners of war (POWs) from the Napoleonic conflicts. Almost all streets are named after famous generals or have military connotations, such as Wellington, York and Banner Roads. Stories are told of the POWs transporting spoil from the New Cut to lay the foundations for the terrace housing. Original cobble stones laid by the POW's can be seen in the gutters and some secluded alleys. A view along Picton Street, Montpelier Picton Street was built and named in honour of Sir Thomas Picton who, as Captain Picton, in 1783 endeared himself to Bristolians by bravely facing the rebellious 75th Regiment on College Green and averting a military mutiny. There is a double- bayed villa in the street named after him, Picton Lodge. St Andrew's St Andrew's is a suburb of Bristol situated about 3 km (1.8 miles) north of the city centre. The area was developed in the late 19th century as St Andrew's Park Estate, and consists mostly of large Victorian villas, with some inter- war housing and some minor rebuilding in Cromwell Road and Belvoir Road following enemy action in World War II. The area is roughly bounded by the Severn Beach Railway Line, Gloucester Road, Somerville Road and Cromwell Road; however the boundary is debatable: according to the Ordnance Survey map this area is Montpelier, whereas according to the National Gazetteer of 1868, Montpelier is a hamlet within the Parish of St Andrew's. St Andrew's Church, which gave the area its name, was in St Andrew's Road, Montpelier. The church was demolished in 1969. The David Thomas Memorial church was erected 1879‚Äì1881 and demolished in 1987, destroying most of a Gothic fantasy by Stuart Colman. The building still retains a thin octagonal spire and west front but the massive halls, apse and rib vaults have now gone in favour of flats by Stride Treglown. In the mid 20th century, the area became unfashionable and many of the houses were converted to multiple occupation. However, during the 1990s, the area became fashionable again and consequently many houses are now being converted back into family homes. St Andrew's is well served by public transport, with frequent buses to all parts of the city from Gloucester Road, buses to University of West England's Frenchay Campus and a local train service from Montpelier to Bristol Temple Meads, Clifton and Avonmouth on the Severn Beach Line. St Andrew's Park St Andrew's Park is at the heart of the area. The park was laid out in 1895,Bristol City Council: Parks and open spaces: St Andrews Park and is home to events such as 'Music in the Park' during the summer, and 'Carols in the Park' at Christmas. The park features a well-sized children's play area, permanent paddling pool (serviced and used only in the summer months) and public toilets (limited opening hours). Despite being located on a hilly incline, the park is well used for football and frisbee throughout the year. On 30 April 1941 a Wellington bomber on a night training flight crashed in the park after hitting barrage balloon cables. There is now a memorial to the crash in the park. A website has been created about the crash. St Paul's St Paul's is an inner suburb of Bristol, England, situated just north east of the city centre and west of the M32. In the early 18th century it was laid out as one of Bristol's first suburbs. St Paul's ranks highly on national indices of multiple deprivation. St Werburgh's St Werburgh's Church St. Werburgh's is an area in central north-east Bristol, England. Surrounded by the M32 motorway, railway embankments and allotment slopes it has the feel of a green village in the inner city. The area became known as St.Werburgh's when St Werburgh's Church was relocated (and substantially rebuilt) to Mina Road in this district from Corn Street, Bristol in 1879. It is now a Climbing Centre run by Undercover Rock.

This was originally done partly for technological reasons, since early film and television did not deal well with high contrast ratios, but now is used to suggest an upbeat mood. It is often used in sitcoms and comedies. High-key lighting is usually quite homogeneous and free from dark shadows. The terminology comes from the higher balance in the ratio between the key light and the fill light in a traditional three point lighting setup. In the 1950s and 1960s, high-key lighting was achieved through multiple light sources lighting a scene‚Äîusually using three fixtures per person (left, right, and central) ‚Äîwhich resulted in a uniform lighting pattern with very little modeling. Nowadays, multiple hot light sources are replaced with much more efficient fluorescent soft lights which provide a similar effect. The advantage to high-key lighting is that it doesn't require adjustment for each scene which allows the production to complete the shooting in hours instead of days. The primary drawback is that high-key lighting fails to add meaning or drama by lighting certain parts more prominently than others. Shows with bigger budgets have moved away from high-key lighting by using lighting set- ups different from the standard three-point lighting. Part of the reason for this is the advent of new lighting fixtures which are easier to use and quicker to set up. Another reason is the growing sophistication of the audience for TV programs and the need to differentiate.  Movies  High-key lighting found its use in classical Hollywood cinema because it was well suited for three-point lighting and other filmmaking traditions. It is an overall lighting design which uses the fill light and backlight to create low contrast between brighter and darker areas. It can be used for both daylight and night scenes.

It is not to be confused with the slightly older abbey in Wales on the site of Bangor Cathedral. History=Foundation Comgall founded the monastery at Bangor about 558 A.D. in the County Down, on the southern shore of Belfast Lough. The ancient Annals differ about the exact year, giving various dates between 552 and 559. The earliest, the Annals of Tighernach, and the Annals of Innisfallen, give 558 A.D. as the date of the foundation.Hamilton, James. \\"A Short History of Bangor Abbey\\", Bangor Abbey Through Fifteen Centuries The name was sometimes written \\"Beannchor\\". The place was also called the \\"Vale of Angels\\", because, according to a popular legend, St. Patrick once rested there and saw the valley filled with angels.D'Alton, Edward. \\"Bangor Abbey.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia. Vol. 2. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1907. 14 April 2015 Comgall was born in Antrim in 517, and educated at Clooneenagh and Clonmacnoise. The spirit of monasticism was then strong in Ireland. Many sought solitude the better to serve God, and with this object Comgall retired to a lonely island. The persuasions of his friends drew him from his retreat; later on he founded the monastery of Bangor. Under his rule, which was rigid, prayer and fasting were incessant. Food was scant and plain. Worship held the foremost place in the life of the community. It is clear that music was a prominent feature of the worship of the Bangor monks. Crowds came to share his penances and his vigils; they also came for learning. School Bangor Abbey is regarded as one of the most important of the early Northern Irish monastic sites, second only to Armagh.McHugh, Ronan. \\"Malachy's Wall\\", Center for Archaeological Fieldwork, Queen's University Belfast Within the extensive rampart which encircled its monastic buildings, students studied scripture, theology, logic, geometry, arithmetic, music, and the classics. Mo Sinu moccu Min was the fifth abbot of Bangor. It is thought that he tutored Columbanus.Richter, Michael. Ireland and her neighbours in the Seventh Century, p.113 Robin Flower wrote that \\"It is clear that particular attention was paid to historical studies at Bangor, and the earliest Irish chronicle was probably a production of that house.\\"Flower, Robin. \\"The Irish Tradition\\", p.14, 1947 Bangor was a major center of learning‚Äîcalled the \\"Light of the World\\"‚Äîand trained many missionaries. Carthach of Lismore studied at Bangor, as did Fintan of Doon. Saint Mirin was a prior at Bangor before leaving to found Paisley Abbey in Renfrewshire. Columbanus and Gall went off to Continental Europe in 590 AD and founded the famous monasteries of Luxiell (France), St Gallen (Switzerland) and Bobbio (Italy). Decline The ruined Bangor Sundial (), now on display outside the town hall Like many early Irish monasteries, Bangor was destroyed and rebuilt on a number of occasions. The Annals of Ulster record that Bangor was burned in 616 and again in 755. No doubt at this period the buildings were constructed of wood. Easily accessible from the sea, Bangor invited attack, and between 822 and 824 the Norsemen plundered it. The Annals of Ulster and the Four Masters both record that during this raid, ‚Äúlearned men and bishops‚Äù were smitten, while the shrine containing the relics of Comgall was taken. Another probable victim of the Vikings was ‚ÄúTanaidhe MacUidhir, coarb of Bennchor, who was killed in 958. There is a consensus that the importance of Bangor declined around the latter part of the tenth century. When St. Malachy, in 1121, became Abbot of Bangor he had to build everything anew. However, three years later he was promoted to the See of Down, and Bangor again decayed. By the Statute of Kilkenny the \\"mere Irishmen\\" were excluded from making profession there. In 1469, the Franciscans had possession of it, and a century later the Augustinians, after which, at the dissolution of the monasteries in that part of Ireland, it was given by James I to Sir James Hamilton who repaired the church in 1617 and was buried in it when he died in 1644. It appears that stone from the abbey was used in the construction of the new church. All that remains of the Abbey ruins is St. Malachy's Wall.Praeger, Robert Lloyd. \\"Banger-History\\", Official Guide to County Down and the Mourne Mountains, M'Caw, Stevenson & Orr, 1900 The present Tower of the church dates back to the 14th century. A mural in the church is of Christ ascending to heaven with Saints Comgall, Gall and Columbanus at his feet. Antiphonary of Bangor The Antiphonary of Bangor was probably written by the monks of Bangor Abbey between 602 and 691. It was housed at Bobbio in Italy for over 1000 years. The manuscript, which contains a collection of Latin hymns, prayers and antiphons is one of the earliest surviving dateable monastic manuscripts from Ireland and has been described as one of the most precious surviving witnesses to the early Irish church. The manuscript provides an important insight into monastic life in Ireland and is also testament to the artistic and literary standard of the work attributed to the monks of Bangor in the seventh century. Nothing now remains of the original buildings of Comgall's monastery. In the Private Chapel at Clandeboye, however, may be seen, built into the wall, the shaft of a Cross, which was found in the Abbey precincts. This is a fragment of a Celtic High Cross, which may have stood on \\"the Cross Hill\\" adjacent to Bangor Castle, and which is indicated on a 17th-century map. This fragment probably dates from about the 8th century.

It opened in 1838, and is now used for watersports, as well as supplying water to the canal system. The Dudley Canal Line No 2 followed a circuitous route, but in the 1830s Thomas Brewin was responsible for building a more direct route. The total length of the new canal, which opened in 1838, was about , which included a tunnel, known as Brewin's Tunnel. The new route enabled a reservoir to be built over the old course of the canal, together with a steam-powered pumping engine. The tunnel did not last long, as it was opened out in 1858, necessitating the construction of a bridge to carry the lane which had previously crossed over the top of the tunnel. The bridge is now called High Bridge, and the lane is called Highbridge Road.Ordnance Survey, 1:2500 map The reservoir, which was built between 1835 and 1838, acted as a storage reservoir, so that when water was plentiful, as a result of rain, it could be pumped from the canal into the reservoir, and then released back into the canal through sluices near the tunnel when it was required. The engine was installed in 1840, and drove a scoop wheel. A cottage was provided for the sluice keeper. With the nationalisation of the canals in 1948, ownership of the reservoir passed from the Birmingham Canal Navigations, with whom the Dudley Canal had amalgamated in 1846, to British Waterways. They sold it to Dudley Metropolitan Borough Council in 1966, who wanted to improve the leisure facilities within their area, and have since developed it for watersports, although it still supplies water to the canal. Facilities The reservoir now hosts watersports including scuba diving, yachting and water skiing. The Dudley Water Ski and Yacht Club began as an informal society in 1963, and negotiated with Dudley Council to allow them to use the reservoir for their activities. Changing rooms and a clubhouse were built, and the use of the reservoir was shared with two diving clubs, although they remained independent of the original club. Subsequently, the club became the Dudley Water Sports Centre, and registered with Companies House as a private limited company in 1997. The Dudley Dolphin BSAC diving club began as a group of like- minded divers in 1959. Negotiations with the Water Ski and Yacht Club were not initially successful, as the activities appeared to conflict, but a suitable compromise was worked out in 1964, and the club was formed by constitution. Diving was suspended in 1967, as swimmers were perceived as a hazard to boats, but more negotiations led to a trial reinstatement of the activity in October 1968, and it became permanent in December 1969. The club did not affiliate to the British Sub-Aqua Club (BSAC), as they were carrying out research into fish in the reservoir, while the BSAC supported spearfishing. However, the situation had changed by 1976, and they are now part of that organisation, with all of the trainers holding BSAC qualifications.https://dudleydolphinbsac.com/club-history In March 1976, members were concerned both about the threat of certain dive sites being closed to non-BSAC clubs and about the possible need of obtaining internationally recognised qualifications to enable them to dive abroad. This led to the Dudley Dolphin club becoming an open branch of the British Sub Aqua club. Dudley Dolphin BSAC has training sessions at Dudley Leisure Centre every Friday (and will be moving to new the facility on completion), with Sunday morning diving at the reservoir. The club is a diving and snorkelling club with an active membership of over 60 members. https://dudleydolphinbsac.com/ In 1973 a group of Black Country scuba diving enthusiasts founded Dudley Nautilus Sub Aqua Club and in February 2016 they celebrated 40 years of being a BSAC branch. Dudley Nautilus hold weekly dives at the Reservoir on Saturday mornings and training sessions at Halesowen Leisure Centre on Thursday evenings.

He is best known for his appearances with Extreme Championship Wrestling in 1995 to 1996 as a member of Dudley family under the ring name Dudley Dudley. Early life and career Bradley was born in San Antonio, Texas and raised in Brandon, Florida. As a child, he attended wrestling shows at the Fort Homer Hesterly Armory along with his family, and thus developed an interest in wrestling. As an adult, he began training under Joe Malenko and his brother Dean. Bradley was also one of the last wrestlers to receive training from Hiro Matsuda, who was visiting the Malenko's school in order to train Osamu Nishimura when Bradley began training. His first match took place in Tampa, Florida and saw Bradley wrestle Gary Nice. Professional wrestling career=World Wrestling Federation (1993-1995) Following a 1993 tour of Australia as part of Dean Malenko's Wrestle Riot group, Bradley, upon his return to America, was brought into the World Wrestling Federation by Jimmy Del Ray. Bradley was given the ring name \\"Charlie Hunter\\", and worked for the WWF for two years, in the course of which he wrestled both The British Bulldog and Shawn Michaels and appeared on Monday Night Raw. Extreme Championship Wrestling (1995-1996) Renamed \\"Dudley Dudley\\", Bradley arrived in ECW on July 1, 1995. He was billed as being part of the Dudley family along with his storyline half-brothers Snot Dudley and Big Dick Dudley. Dudley Dudley was known for his deep voice and strange laugh during interviews, and had the distinction of being \\"the only pure Dudley\\" - while all the Dudleys allegedly had (the apocryphal) Big Daddy Dudley as a common father, Dudley Dudley was the only Dudley who had (the equally fictitious) Momma Dudley as a mother. As a result, Dudley Dudley was the unquestioned leader of the stable. The Dudley Boys feuded with The Pitbulls, and were members of Raven's Nest. In late 1995, the Dudleys were joined by Dances with Dudley and Buh Buh Ray Dudley. Dudley Dudley teamed with Dances With Dudley after his former partner, Snot, was badly injured in a jet ski accident. He left ECW in early 1996 after deciding to take a hiatus from wrestling. World Championship Wrestling (1995, 1997) In October 1997 Bradley appeared with WCW as a jobber. He had previously appeared with WCW as a jobber in 1995, wrestling Brian Pillman at a house show. World tour Bradley worked in Japan for Big Japan Pro Wrestling and the International Wrestling Association of Japan, competing in a variety of deathmatches, and toured the world, appearing in Africa and South America. In late 2004 Bradley toured Austria and Hungary with Chris Raaber's European Wrestling Association. Bradley also toured Puerto Rico on several occasions as part of the International Wrestling Association, wrestling as \\"Bad Boy Bradley\\". He also was a member of Carlos Colons company (WWC) P.R. Florida Bradley returned to Florida and began wrestling on the independent circuit as \\"The original Dudley Dudley\\", and for IPW Hardcore as \\"Evil Snack\\", an evil chef with his proteges Von Tankard and Kubiak, who were known as The Snack Pack. He later began wrestling for NWA Florida, but was sidelined with a serious biceps injury in January 2004. Bradley trained numerous wrestlers at Dean Malenko's School of professional wrestling in Tampa while Malenko was touring Japan, including Axis, Chad Collyer, Molly Holly, Jet Jaguar, Kane, Jeremy Lopez, Tony Mamaluke, Mike and Todd Shane, Rod Steel, Bruce Steele, and Mikey Tenderfoot. On December 1, 2004, Bradley became a trainer at Steve Keirn's School of Hard Knocks, also located in Tampa. Puerto Rico (2008) Bradley returned to Puerto Rico and began wrestling in World Wrestling Council as Bad Boy Bradley. He made tag with Todd Dean and defeat Juventud Boricua (Chris Joel and Noriega) to win the WWC Tag Team Championship. Kong made his debut for Birkenhead based All Star Wrestling, worked all over the U.K. and Wales along with Ireland and Scotland. A standout performer Bradley has also worked for Austrian wrestling promotion EWA on several occasions and held the EWA heavy weight belt in 2009 by defeating WWE developmental talent and champion Chris \\"bambikiller\\" Rabber in Leoben, Austria. Bradley was also noted for working WWF talent \\"Just Joe\\" Joe E. Legend drawing another sold out house for EWA.

The show was hosted by John Byner, and produced by CTV at the CFTO's Glen Warren Studios in the Toronto suburb of Scarborough, Ontario for first- run airing in Canada on CTV and in the United States on the Showtime premium cable network. Synopsis John Byner 1976 The series featured slapstick sketches, monologues, TV parodies, and performances by guest stand-up comics. Byner's interactions with members of the studio audience, or with show producer Bob Einstein (who often came in to halt a sketch midway through), provided an early example of removing the fourth wall. Much of the humour on the show was considered risqu√© during the original run of the series. The series utilized a rotating ensemble of supporting actors who backed Byner up in his sketches. Besides Einstein, this group included Philip Akin, Harvey Atkin, Billy Barty, Cynthia Belliveau, Jack Duffy, Jayne Eastwood, Barbara Hamilton, John Hemphill, Barry Flatman, Keith Knight, Don Lake, Kathleen Laskey, Kate Lynch, Pat Morita, Debra McGrath, Mike Myers, Earl Pennington, Melissa Steinberg, Billy Van, Steve Weston, and Wayne and Shuster alumnus Tom Harvey. Bizarre had guest star performers during its run including Steve Allen, Frances Bay, Redd Foxx, Luba Goy (who was concurrently with the Royal Canadian Air Farce, at that time primarily a radio troupe), Victoria Jackson, Murray Langston (as The Unknown Comic), Howie Mandel, Second City alumnus Dave Thomas, Willie Tyler & Lester, Marc Weiner, Henny Youngman and others. Super Dave Osborne A regular feature of the show was Super Dave Osborne (a spoof of daredevils such as Evel Knievel), portrayed by Bob Einstein, in which Super Dave would perform elaborate mock stunts meant to enthrall viewers; a reporter (usually Mike Walden) would assist in framing the sketch. Inevitably, the stunt would fail spectacularly, resulting in severe injury to Super Dave. These sketches would usually finish with a view of the scene, in which Super Dave was buried, encased, launched etc., as appropriate for the sketch. Meanwhile, feigning agony, Super Dave would discuss sundry details ‚Äì information about the next show, why the stunt failed, or what he'd do to the reporter once he recovered from his injuries. One notable Super Dave sketch was a stunt where he attempted to avoid being harmed while standing under a pile driver, by repeating the nonsense phrase \\"balloon ball\\". The stunt failed in typical Super Dave style, leaving him as a helmeted head atop two shoes. This particular sketch was popular enough that during the following season, Showtime ads for Bizarre featured a cartoon logo of Super Dave's helmeted head and shoes. The Super Dave sketches led to a spin-off series (Super Dave) with a more family-friendly style. Content editing Two versions of the show were produced: episodes that aired on the Showtime cable network in the United States contained nudity and coarse language. The versions that aired on CTV (and later in syndication) had the nudity removed and the language bleeped by a horn-honking sound. Although the \\"adult\\" version is most closely associated with Showtime, it did go out on a few independent TV stations during the 1980s, playing as late-night fare, although the \\"clean\\" version is the one that was more commonly found in syndication. Current Canadian broadcast content regulations, which are more lenient than those of the 1980s, might permit broadcast of the uncensored Showtime versions, but they have not been offered for broadcast syndication. The \\"adult\\" version was also shown regionally on ITV in the United Kingdom, usually airing after 11 PM and with some of the more extreme language bleeped out conventionally. Sketches containing nudity were censored for Canadian television and syndication by the inclusion of reverse angle scenes originally filmed from behind nude actors (generally women baring their breasts) or else alternate scenes that had been filmed with the models wearing a bra. Rare scenes involving a woman being naked below the waist, however, just had the skits end very abruptly. The \\"adult\\" version has not aired on television since the Showtime airings and original syndication ceased in the late 1980s. The syndicated episodes have been rebroadcast since. Development Bizarre was originally developed for ABC. In 1979, ABC was looking into re-entering the late night television field amid reports of Johnny Carson potentially leaving NBC's The Tonight Show due to a contract dispute. ABC made overtures to Carson and to Richard Dawson, then working for ABC as the host of their daytime game show Family Feud and also serving as Carson's regular guest host. Carson eventually renewed with NBC. Dawson taped the pilot for Bizarre at Television City Studios in Hollywood. The special aired on ABC March 20, 1979.Facebook page of The Museum of Classic Chicago Television, October 25, 2015. Ultimately, neither Dawson nor ABC decided to continue with the project (ABC instead went with Fridays and Nightline). Production moved to Canada (allowing the show to qualify for Canadian content credits, despite maintaining a mostly American cast) and impressionist John Byner was installed as host. The premiere of Bizarre used many of the same sketches as the Dawson pilot. DVD release DVDs of the unedited version, titled The Best of Bizarre Uncensored, were released in late 2005 from Canadian video label Visual Entertainment and are available to buy from Canadian and US retailers. Nine individual volumes have been released as of July 2007. While the episodes appear to be uncensored regarding language and nudity, most are missing their original end credits, which included plugs for the Royal York Hotel in Toronto and Tilden Rent-a-Car. The only episodes to retain their original end credits are ones where live-action sketches are still taking place while the credits roll, and most of those episodes have the sponsorship plugs removed, with the exception of episode 47 (on Volume Five), due to Super Dave Osborne commenting on the plugs. A generic \\"DVD credits\\" roll appears on each disc to give credit to the people who worked on the show. Reruns The \\"adult\\" version has not aired on television since the Showtime airings and original syndication ceased in the late 1980s. The syndicated episodes have been rebroadcast since then in Canada (as least as recently as 2003), where they were mostly scheduled to fulfill \\"Canadian Content\\" requirements. The Comedy Network aired Bizarre from 1997-2003. TV Land Canada, later known as Comedy Gold, aired Bizarre from New Year's Eve 2008 to August 2011.

Plot summary The book begins with an ancient vampire of Nordic descent awaking after being frozen in a block of ice for hundreds of years. The vampire, Thorne, meets Marius de Romanus and inquires about Marius' past. Marius then provides his life story. As a young Roman patrician, Marius was abducted by druids who were trying to find a replacement for their \\"god of the grove\\"‚Äîa vampire, kept locked inside a chamber underneath a tree, who took on the role of a god in a druidic religion. Marius does not want to receive the powers of the dying god, but is given them nonetheless. Unable to face a life imprisoned in a tree, Marius escapes from the druids (one of whom is Mael). He embarks on a trip to Egypt, where he learns of Akasha and Enkil, the Mother and Father or Those Who Must Be Kept‚Äîthe progenitors of all vampire-kind. He takes them back to Rome with him after learning that if they die then every other vampire in the world will suffer the same fate. He falls in love with a mortal woman, Pandora, and turns her into a vampire. They live together happily for a long time, although they argue frequently. One day, their house is attacked by a group of vampires who want to know the secrets of Those Who Must Be Kept. Though they destroy these vampires, the attack leads to an argument between the two and Marius, filled with anger, leaves Pandora. Marius then returns to Rome, where he creates a life for himself as a socialite, fraternizing with mortals and practicing painting. It is here that he meets Mael and Avicus, the latter of which is a former god of the grove‚Äîa vampire older than Marius, but who does not seem to know his own power. There is still much enmity between Mael and Marius, and Marius asks them to leave. They do so, but remain in the city of Rome. Marius does not mind this, as they keep the city free from other blood-drinkers who may pry the secrets of Those Who Must Be Kept from his mind. Marius continues to live this way even as the Roman Empire splits, with its capital city moving to Constantinople. Eventually, Marius, Mael, and Avicus leave Rome when it is sacked by barbarians. They travel to Constantinople, taking with them the Mother and Father. There they meet a powerful vampire named Eudoxia, who wants Marius to put Those Who Must Be Kept into her care. After praying to Those Who Must Be Kept for an answer, he relents just far enough to allow Eudoxia to see them. After a series of violent conflicts, Marius angrily drags Eudoxia back down into the shrine and casts her at Akasha, who suddenly awakens to destroy her. Realizing that he cannot live with other vampires due to his custody of the Divine Parents, Marius elects to return to Italy. He becomes disheartened by the horrors of the Black Death and sleeps for hundreds of years. He awakes again during the Renaissance and travels all around Italy, visiting Venice and Florence, admiring the art and culture. In Rome he meets the vampire Santino, who claims that Marius is living in sin by not serving Satan. Marius threatens him and tells Santino to never come near him again. Marius decides to make his home in Venice, and he establishes himself as an amateur painter. His house is set up as a place where young boys can come and improve themselves, preparing to go to university or to become craftsmen. During this time, he also falls in love with the works of Botticelli, whom he briefly considers turning into a vampire. It is in Venice that Marius meets Amadeo (Armand), whom he discovers in a filthy cellar, waiting to become a prostitute in the city's brothels. He purchases the boy from the slave traders and takes him back to his house, where he bathes him and promises him a better life. As the years pass Marius happily continues his life, disappearing occasionally to attend to the Divine Parents. Amadeo grows up, and the two often share a bed. Marius is sorely tempted to give Amadeo the Dark Gift, making him into a vampire, but he stops himself from doing so. When Marius is away looking after the Divine Parents, his house is attacked by the Englishman Lord Harlech who became obsessed with Amadeo after sleeping with him. Amadeo manages to kill Harlech, but sustains several wounds from Harlech's poisoned blade. He slips into a fever. Marius arrives and is told that Amadeo will die as the poison is too strong. Marius turns Amadeo into a vampire in order to prevent the boy from dying. He teaches him to prey only on evildoers in order to save his conscience. Some time after Amadeo becomes a vampire, the house is attacked by a large mob of Satan- worshiping vampires under the leadership of Santino. Marius is burnt and almost killed, but manages to save his own life by jumping into a canal. Nonetheless, he is severely wounded and believes that Amadeo will be killed. He calls a woman named Bianca to his aid. The two have known each other for a number of years and have a close relationship. Marius is too weak to hunt, so he transforms Bianca into a vampire in order to have her help him to recover his strength. The two move to the shrine of Those Who Must Be Kept and live there for over a century, where Marius gradually recovers his strength by drinking from Akasha. After Amadeo had transformed, Marius had met with Raymond Gallant, a man from the Talamasca, a group of scholars who found out information about supernatural things, just for information. He hears from him that Pandora is being kept hostage by another vampire and moved around Europe and Russia; so Marius decides to move to Dresden to try meeting with Pandora, whom he still loves. He does not tell Bianca of this. Marius does indeed find Pandora there, but discovers that she does not want to live with him and Bianca and wants to stay with her traveling companion, who was not holding her hostage after all. Marius offers to leave Bianca for Pandora, but Pandora refuses this offer. When Marius sees Bianca the next day, she declares that she is leaving him because she overheard what he said to Pandora. 50 years later, as he is shifting to America, Marius discovers a letter from Pandora offering to live with him if he comes to collect her at a certain place, but it is too late and she is gone. Marius then shelters a young vampire named Lestat de Lioncourt, who wakes up Akasha when playing a song for her on his violin. She comes to him and they drink each other's blood. Enkil is furious and almost crushes Lestat when a shocked Marius saves him. Marius sends Lestat away, thinking that he can pose a danger, but is sad that it is the fourth time he is losing a love. Years later, Marius brings a television into Those Who Must Be Kept's Chapel, for their entertainment. On this they see news, songs, etc. and also The Vampire Lestat's rock guitar music. This, Marius feels, corrupts their minds, and Akasha awakens from her slumber with the evil idea of taking over the world. She destroys Enkil and buries Marius in the ruins of his house, where he lies, injured. Marius lies there trapped, for weeks, but with the Mind Gift informs Lestat that he is in danger, and also asks for help. He is soon found by Pandora, and Santino‚Äîwhom he tries to kill, but realises that all force would be needed to stop Akasha from her evil deed of taking over the world, killing all males and having a female-dominated world with her as the leader. A council is formed and the vampires try to convince Akasha, but she does not listen. Finally, Maharet's (who created Thorne) mute sister Mekare fights with Akasha and destroys her. That is the end of Marius's story through time. The story then moves back to the present day, where Marius and Thorne are at a jungle hideaway with other old and powerful vampires‚ÄîAmadeo (now going by the name Armand), Santino, Maharet, Mekare, and Pandora. Marius wants justice against Santino for taking Armand away from him, but Maharet refuses to let Marius kill Santino, who is weak. Thorne does not want to accept her decision and so kills Santino himself with the Fire Gift. In penance for his deed, he gives over his eyes to Maharet.

Creation In 1969, actors Virginia McKenna and Bill Travers, who starred in the film Born Free, made the film An Elephant Called Slowly. This featured an elephant calf called Pole Pole who was given to London Zoo when filming finished. In 1982, McKenna and Travers went to visit Pole Pole at London Zoo. After seeing her, they launched a campaign to get Pole Pole moved to somewhere more suitable and with other elephants for company. In 1983, it was agreed to move Pole Pole to Whipsnade Zoo, but following complications during the transfer, Pole Pole died. Her death deeply affected McKenna and Travers, so in 1984 they launched Zoo Check with their eldest son Will Travers OBE. Zoo Check was renamed Born Free Foundation in 1991.

Fictional character biography Shard was a Lieutenant in Xavier's Security Enforcers, (X.S.E.) with her older brother Lucas Bishop in their native timeline in the 2080s. She is the daughter of mutant Indigenous Australian refugees (their ancestor is the mutant Gateway) who fled Australia for America the day before it was devastated in a nuclear attack. Shard was born and raised in a mutant concentration camp, in which mutants were branded over their right eyes with the letter \\"M\\" for recognition. In Uncanny X-Men Annual #17, Shard is stated as having the mutant ability of \\"transubbing ambient light into concussive force\\". Shard became the youngest X.S.E. graduate a year after Bishop attained that position. She served under Bishop as a member of the Omega Squad (which included Bishop and his officers, Randall and Malcolm), until her promotion. Together, in the X.S.E. Shard and Bishop were responsible for apprehending criminal mutants. Shard was partially infected on a mission with her brother fighting a group infected with a vampire-like affliction originating from the present day mutant, Emplate. Although Emplates are considered the \\"living dead\\", Bishop took her to the New York Stark/Fujikawa building inhabited by the Witness in order to attempt to save her life by transmitting her essence into a holographic matrix (a technology of Shi'ar origin, akin to that used in the X-Men's Danger Room). Here he was said to have made a deal in order for the experiment to even happen in the first place, the price being that he would work for him for a specified period of time. The experiment was a success, but Shard, already partially infected with the Emplate affliction, died. Due to the process involved, Bishop considered himself her murderer. The extent of, as well as the type of work he did in this deal is still yet to be known, if it ever will be.Messiah Complex TPB Bishop eventually travelled back in time, to the present, in an effort to track down Trevor Fitzroy, one of his time's most-wanted criminals and Shard's ex-lover, where he became stuck in the present day and became a member of the X-Men, his idols. Shard has also since been recreated in the present, as a computer construct, and became a clandestine member of the government-sponsored X-Factor team. There, she began a romantic relationship with her teammate Wildchild. After X-Factor disbanded in X-Factor #149, Shard was transported into an alternate future. There she died for the second and apparently final time, saving her brother Bishop.Bishop: the Last X-Man #14 from Trevor Fitzroy, her former paramour who had attempted to seduce her into becoming his consort once again by restoring her body to its original solid form.

He is best known for his appearances with Extreme Championship Wrestling as a member of The Dudley Brothers under the ring name Snot Dudley in summer 1995. He is also known for his appearances with Smoky Mountain Wrestling in Tennessee and on the independent circuit in Florida and the northeastern United States. Professional wrestling career=Smoky Mountain Wrestling (1993-1995) Deek relocated from New York City to Morristown, Tennessee to train as a professional wrestler under Tim Horner at the Smoky Mountain Wrestling training camp. He made his debut with Smoky Mountain Wrestling on August 21, 1993 as \\"Anthony Michaels\\", losing to Joe Cazana. In March 1994, Deek was repackaged as the masked \\"Fire\\" and placed in a tag team with Brimstone called \\"The Infernos\\". The Infernos went on to compete in the SMW tag team division, competing against teams such as The Thrillseekers (Chris Jericho and Lance Storm) and The Rock 'n' Roll Express. Deek alternated between the two ring names until leaving SMW in February 1995. Extreme Championship Wrestling (1995) Deek debuted in the Philadelphia, Pennsylvania-based promotion Extreme Championship Wrestling on July 1, 1995 at Hardcore Heaven. Wearing overalls, a tie-dyed shirt, high-tops and glasses, Deek was given the gimmick of \\"Lil' Snot Dudley\\", one of the three original members of The Dudley Brothers along with Dudley Dudley and Big Dick Dudley. In their debut match, Snot Dudley and Dudley Dudley scored an upset victory over The Pitbulls. Shortly after their debut, the Dudley family aligned themselves with Raven, joining Raven's Nest and feuding with The Pitbulls. At Heat Wave on July 15, 1995, Dudley Dudley and Snot Dudley teamed with Raven in a loss to Tommy Dreamer and The Pitbulls. Shortly thereafter, Deek was injured in a jet ski accident and left ECW, with his departure attributed to a broken pelvis resulting from a superbomb delivered by The Pitbulls at Heat Wave. Independent circuit (1995-present) Dudley approaching the ring in September 2005 After recovering from his injury, Deek returned to wrestling on the independent circuit in Florida. In 1998, Deek formed a tag team with Jeff Roth, who adopted the ring name \\"Schmuck Dudley\\". The duo wrestled for the Florida-based Future of Wrestling promotion as \\"The Dudleys\\". In 1999, Deek reverted to the ring name Anthony Michaels and Schmuck to Jeff Roth, changing the name of their tag team to \\"Wildside\\", then to \\"Animal House\\". The duo won the FOW Tag Team Championship on three occasions between 1998 and 2002. Deek remained with FOW until the promotion folded in 2003. Deek also wrestled for other independent promotions in Florida such as Florida Championship Wrestling and Coastal Championship Wrestling. In 2003, Deek joined the Pennsylvania- based promotion World Xtreme Wrestling, where he formed a tag team with Mark Gore called \\"The Untouchables\\". The duo won the WXW Tag Team Championship in May 2004, holding the titles until August of that year. The Untouchables continued to wrestled intermittently for WXW over the following eight years. The duo also performed for other independent promotions in the northeastern United States such as the Connecticut-based Defiant Pro Wrestling and the Massachusetts-based Powerhouse Wrestling. Deek made a one-off appearance with World Wrestling Entertainment on the March 13, 2007 episode of ECW on Sci Fi as \\"Mikey Deek\\". Deek and Danny Jacks lost to Snitsky in a handicap match. In 2010, Deek returned to the Future of Wrestling promotion after it was resurrected, repeatedly challenging for the FOW Heavyweight Championship and the FOW International Heavyweight Championship. In December 2012, Deek and The Beast won the FOW Tag Team Championship, marking Deek's fourth reign with the championship.

When he was two years old, Namkhai Norbu was recognized as the 'mindstream emanation', a tulku, of the Dzogchen teacher Adzom Drugpa (1842‚Äì1924). At five, he was also recognized as a mindstream emanation of an emanation of Shabdrung Ngawang Namgyel (1594‚Äì1651). From an early age, Namkhai Norbu undertook an accelerated course of study, attending monastic college, taking retreats, and studying with renowned teachers, including some of the most important Tibetan masters of his time. Under the tutelage of these teachers, he completed the training required by the Buddhist tradition in both Sutrayana and Tantrayana. At the age of sixteen, he met master Rigdzin Changchub Dorje (1863-1963), who became his principal Dzogchen teacher.Norbu, Namkhai (1980, 1982) The Necklace of Gzi, A Cultural History of Tibet (Information Office of HH the Dalai Lama, Dharamsala). In 1960, he came to Italy at the invitation of Professor Giuseppe Tucci, and served as Professor of Tibetan and Mongolian Language and Literature from 1964 to 1992 at the Naples Eastern University. Namkhai Norbu was widely recognized as a leading authority on Tibetan culture, particularly in the fields of history, literature, and Traditional Tibetan medicine and astrological sciences such as the Tibetan calendar. In 1983, he hosted the first International Convention on Tibetan Medicine, held in Venice, Italy.Dzogchen Romania. A brief biography of Ch√∂gyal Namkhai Norbu Online: (accessed: May 14, 2008) In 1976, Namkhai Norbu began to give Dzogchen instruction in the West, first in Italy, then in numerous other countries. He quickly became a respected spiritual authority among many practitioners, and has created centers for the study of Dzogchen worldwide.Tsegyalgar East. Ch√∂gyal Namkhai Norbu (Biographical Sketch). Online: (accessed: May 14, 2008) On 10 September 2018, the Italian government gave its highest award, Commander of the Order of Merit of the Italian Republic, to him from President Sergio Mattarella. The Tibetan government in exile regarded him as having been ‚Äúthe foremost living Dzogchen‚Äù teacher at the time of his death in 2018. Nomenclature, orthography and etymology This section details the origins and meaning of the title Ch√∂gyal and the name Namkhai Norbu (Tibetan: Chos-rGyal Nam-mkha‚Äôi Nor-bu).Capriles, El√≠as (2003). Buddhism and Dzogchen: The Doctrine of the Buddha and the Supreme Vehicle of Tibetan Buddhism - Part One Buddhism: A Dzogchen Outlook. University of the Andes: M√©rida, Venezuela. Source: (accessed: January 14, 2008) p.5 Ch√∂gyal is a title most commonly associated with the monarchy of Sikkim, now a state in far-northern India. However, Ch√∂gyal (or Chos-rGyal) is also a title conferred upon a special class of temporal and spiritual rulers of the Kingdom of Bhutan, who were recognized mindstream emanations of Shabdrung Ngawang Namgyel, the 17th Century Tibetan-born founder of Bhutan. Namkhai Norbu, recognized at the age of five as an emanation of Ngawang Namgyel, holds the title of Ch√∂gyal in this context.Norbu, Namkhai (2000). The Crystal and the Way of Light: Sutra, Tantra, Dzogchen. (Snow Lion Publications) pg.19-20 & Notes. Namkhai (Tibetan) holds the semantic field of \\"sky\\", \\"space\\" and \\"aether,\\" and has the possessive case ending, thus it may be rendered into English as \\"...of the sky\\". Norbu (Tibetan) holds the semantic field of \\"jewel\\", \\"crystal\\", \\"gem\\", \\"cintamani\\". Therefore, Namkhai Norbu may be rendered in English as \\"Jewel of the Sky\\", \\"Gem of the Aether\\" or \\"Crystal of Space\\". Biography=Recognition as a Tulku Namkhai Norbu was a recognized tulku (also trulku), a reincarnate master. At birth two of Namkhai Norbu's uncles, the Dzogchen masters Palyul Karma Yangsid and Shechen Rabjam believed him to be the reincarnation of their master, Adzom Drugpa Rinpoche (1841‚Äì1934). When Namkhai Norbu was two years old, this was confirmed by a senior tulku of the Nyingma school. Then when he was five years old, the 16th Gyalwa Karmapa and the Situ Rinpoche together recognized Namkhai Norbu as the mind emanationMindstream emanations may be either body, voice, mind, qualities or activities emanations; refer: Three vajra. of the mindstream of another well known teacher, who was in turn the emanation of Shabdrung Ngawang Namgyel, the 17th Century Tibetan-born founder of Bhutan. At a very young age, these recognitions conferred upon Namkhai Norbu a great deal of attention and prestige, as he himself remarks: \\"As I grew up, I was thus given quite a few names and titles, many of which are very long and grand sounding. But I have never used them, because I have always preferred the name my parents gave me at birth.\\" Early life In his early years Namkhai Norbu studied at the Derge Gonchen monastery. At the age of nine he entered a Sakya College where he studied Buddhist philosophy for many years with Khyenrab Ch√∂kyi Odzer. He also received numerous tantric and Dzogchen transmissions and teachings from many masters, including his paternal uncle Togden Ugyen Tendzin (who achieved the rainbow body), maternal uncle Khyentse Rinpoche Ch√∂kyi Wangchug, Drubwang Rinpoche Kunga Palden, Negyab Rinpoche, Drugse Gyurmed Dorje, Dzongsar Khyentse Ch√∂kyi Lodr√∂ and Bo Gongkar Rinpoche. In 1951, he also received Ch√∂d teachings from Ayu Khandro Dorje Paldr√∂n (1838‚Äì1953), a woman who spent over fifty years in dark retreat and was a disciple of Jamyang Khyentse Wangpo. Namkhai Norbu was invited to China in 1953 as a representative of the Tibetan monasteries. After visiting Chengdu and Chungching, he accepted the invitation to teach Tibetan language in Menyag. During this time he met Kangkar Rinpoche, from whom he received instructions on the Six Yogas of Naropa and other teachings. Namkhai Norbu met his root teacher Rigdzin Changchub Dorje in 1955 and stayed at his residence in Khamdogar for six months. From Changchub Dorje he received the authentic transmission of Dzogchen and realized the essence of the dharma (subsuming both Wylie: 'chos' & 'bon') as one state of knowledge beyond all limitations. This realization has remained a characteristic feature of his way of teaching throughout his life. In the late 1950s, Namkhai Norbu made a pilgrimage to Tibet, India, and Nepal. Because of the turmoil and aftermath of the 1959 Tibetan Rebellion, he could not return to Tibet from Sikkim, so he stayed in the erstwhile kingdom while working as an author and editor for the Chogyal government. Professorship Already recognized as extremely knowledgeable in all aspects of Tibetan culture at the age of 22, he was invited to Italy by Professor Giuseppe Tucci to work at the ISMEO Institute in Rome for two years. In 1962, he took up a post in Naples at the Istituto Universitario Orientale, where he taught Tibetan language and literature until 1992. From the time of his residence in Italy, Namkhai Norbu focused his research mainly on the ancient history of Tibet, investigating thoroughly the native B√∂n tradition. His books include works on history, Tibetan medicine, astrology, B√∂n and folk traditions such as namkha. They have been highly appreciated by Tibetans as well as scholars throughout the world. Teaching Dzogchen in the WestTrul Khor: Yantra Yoga= In 1971, Namkhai Norbu began to teach Yantra Yoga, an ancient form of Tibetan Yoga combining movement, breathing and visualization. A few years later, he started to give Dzogchen teachings to a small group of Italian students, with whom he founded the 'Dzogchen Community' (Wylie: rdzogs chen 'dus sde). At that time, Dzogchen was relatively unknown in the West. =International Dzogchen Community= body of light250x250px As interest in his teachings grew, Rinpoche dedicated himself to spreading Dzogchen and establishing 'gars' (Tibetan), seats of the International Dzogchen Community, throughout the world. Today there are gars in Italy, the United States, Mexico, Venezuela, Argentina, Australia, Romania, Russia, Spain, Ukraine and China. Apart from his spiritual activity, he founded the International Shang-Shung Institute to preserve the cultural traditions of Tibet, and ASIA, a nonprofit organization in Tibet mainly dedicated to serving the educational and medical needs of the Tibetan people.

He was not undefeated at two, however, having earlier finished second in the Railway Stakes behind a horse named Rock Of Gibraltar. Hawk Wing's subsequent victories in the National Stakes (in an all age course record time), and the Futurity Stakes led him to the position of favorite for the following year's 2,000 Guineas and Epsom Derby. 2002: Three-year-old career In the 2,000 Guineas, two distinct groups formed on either side of the straight track, with the faster ground on the far side. Hawk Wing was in the group on the stands side, while the group on the far side, containing Rock Of Gibraltar, was travelling slightly further ahead. Hawk Wing beat his own group, and was rapidly closing in on Rock Of Gibraltar but lost by a neck. His next run was in the 2002 Epsom Derby, where his run in the Guineas was enough to give him the position of market favorite again. He ran second to stablemate High Chaparral. The pair were twelve lengths clear of a field including the winners of three major Derby trials. After the Derby, he subsequently dropped back to 10 furlongs and won the prestigious Eclipse Stakes at Sandown Park. He was beaten a short head by Grandera in a renewal of the Irish Champion Stakes at Leopardstown, further prompting some in believing that he wasn't the most genuine of race horses. A runner-up finish behind Where Or When despite being the heavy favourite in the Queen Elizabeth II Stakes at Ascot and a disappointing Stateside trip to the Breeders' Cup Classic further dented his reputation. 2003: Four-year-old career He was kept in training at the age of four years. A field of six ran in the 2003 Group One Lockinge Stakes at Newbury, including: Where Or When, who had beaten Hawk Wing in the Queen Elizabeth II Stakes; Olden Times, winner of the Group One Prix Jean Prat; Domedriver, who had inflicted Rock Of Gibraltar's first defeat in eight Group One races in the Breeders' Cup Mile; Reel Buddy (priced at 50-1 despite having been placed in the Group One Sussex Stakes - an indication of the quality of the field); and Celebration Mile winner Tillerman. Hawk Wing beat this Group One field by 11 lengths, with second place Where Or When eight lengths clear of Olden Times in third. Timeform rated him at 136, suggesting that this was the best performance in the world over a mile for nearly ten years. On his only subsequent outing in the Queen Anne Stakes at Royal Ascot Hawk Wing finished unplaced after suffering a knee ligament injury which ended his racing career. Stud career He retired to Coolmore stud in Ireland. His first crop were 2yos of 2007 and included 11 winners as of the 18th August; his sons Let Us Prey and Feared In Flight have BHA Handicap marks of 98 and 97, respectively. In Australia, his Irish-bred sons Hawk Island (Wyong Cup, Parramatta Cup, and JRA Plate) and Stand To Gain (Sydney Cup) have won stakes races. After standing for a fee of ‚Ç¨15,000 in 2008 Hawk Wing was sold to stand in Korea in a deal arranged by BBA Ireland Ltd. He covered an average of 80 mares a season in his first four years in Korea but demand for his services declined and he is recorded as covering only five mares since 2016.

() is a French high-performance luxury automobiles manufacturer and a subsidiary of Volkswagen AG, with its head office and assembly plant in Molsheim, Alsace, France. Volkswagen purchased the Bugatti trademark in June 1998 and incorporated Bugatti Automobiles S.A.S. in 1999. Bugatti presented several concept cars between 1998 and 2000 before commencing development of its first production model, the Veyron 16.4, delivering the first Veyron to a customer in 2005. History At the urging of then-chairman Ferdinand Pi√´ch, Volkswagen purchased the rights to produce cars under the Bugatti marque in June 1998. This followed the earlier Volkswagen purchases of the Lamborghini marque (by VW's Audi subsidiary), the Rolls-Royce factory in Crewe, United Kingdom, and the Bentley marque. On 22 December 2000, Volkswagen officially incorporated Bugatti Automobiles S.A.S., with former VW drivetrain chief Karl-Heinz Neumann as president. The company purchased the 1856 Ch√¢teau Saint Jean, formerly Ettore Bugatti's guest house in Dorlisheim, near Molsheim, and began refurbishing it to serve as the company's headquarters. The original factory was still in the hands of Snecma, who were unwilling to part with it. At the Pebble Beach Concours d'Elegance in August 2000, VW announced that they would instead build a new modern atelier (factory) next to and south of the Ch√¢teau. The atelier was officially inaugurated on 3 September 2005. Bugatti Automobiles S.A.S. is a wholly owned subsidiary of the Volkswagen AG After the Veyron's discontinuation in 2014, the new Bugatti model was revealed to be the Chiron in 2016. With an 8-liter W16 engine delivering 1500 horsepower, an electronically limited top speed of , and a price of about ‚Ç¨2,400,000, the Chiron attempts to vastly surpass the Veyron's performance. Concept cars=Italdesign Giugiaro designs Volkswagen commissioned Italdesign's Giorgetto Giugiaro to design a series of concept cars to return the marque to prominence. The first example, the EB 118, was a two-door coup√© and was introduced at the Paris Motor Show in 1998. It was followed by the four-door EB 218 touring sedan, introduced at the Geneva Motor Show in 1999. Later that year, the 18/3 Chiron was shown at the IAA in Frankfurt. Volkswagen designs Volkswagen designed the final Bugatti concept, the EB 18/4 GT in house. Bugatti introduced the EB 18/4 at the 1999 Tokyo Motor Show. W18 Engine All of these early concepts featured a 18-cylinder engine. This was the first-ever W-configuration engine on a passenger vehicle, with three blocks of 6 cylinders each. It shared many components with Volkswagen's modular engine family. 16C Galibier The 16C Galibier was unveiled during Celebration of the Centenary of the Marque in Molsheim. The presentation was only for Bugatti customers. The car show in Molsheim showed the car in blue carbon fibre and aluminum parts. One year later Bugatti showed the world the 16C Galibier Concept at \\"VW Group Night\\" at the Geneva Auto Show in a new black and aluminum color combination. The Galibier, a 1000 HP sedan, was first shown as a concept in 2010 and when they planned to put it into production in 2015, it would have cost about $1.4 million. It would use the same 16-cylinder 8.0-litre engine as the Veyron but instead of four turbos, the 16C Galibier would instead use two superchargers to deliver better torque. Production would require new facilities in Molsheim, France, to be refitted, which pushed back potential deliveries until 2015. In 2013, it was announced that the car will never be produced as they wish to focus on a Veyron replacement. Production cars Bugatti EB110 GT In the 1980s the Bugatti brand was brought back as Bugatti Automobili S.p.A. in Italy. The company produced the EB110 in the 1990s, which put Bugatti back on the modern super-car scene. The company was then bought by Volkswagen at the end of the 20th century. Veyron Bugatti Veyron Development of this vehicle began with the 1999 EB 18/4 \\"Veyron\\" concept car, which itself had a chassis based on that of the Bugatti 18/3 Chiron concept car. It was similar in design and appearance to the final Veyron production car. One major difference was the EB 18/4's use of a W18 engine with three banks of six cylinders. The Veyron's chief designer was Hartmut Warkuss, and the exterior was designed by Jozef Kaba≈à of Volkswagen, rather than Giorgetto Giugiaro of Italdesign, who had handled the three prior Bugatti concepts. The then ‚Äì Volkswagen Group chairman Ferdinand Pi√´ch announced the Veyron at the 2000 Geneva Motor Show. It was promised to be the fastest, most powerful and most expensive car in history. Instead of the W18, it would use a VR6/WR8-style W16 engine. First seen in the 1999 Bentley Hunaudi√®res concept car, the W16 would have four turbochargers and produce a quoted (metric) 1001 horsepower (see engine section for details on the power output). Top speed was promised at 407 km/h (253 mph), and the price was announced at ‚Ç¨1 million. Development continued throughout 2001 and the EB 16/4 Veyron was promoted to \\"advanced concept\\" status. In late 2001, Bugatti announced that the car, officially called the \\"Bugatti Veyron 16.4\\", would go into production in 2003. Pi√´ch retired that year as chairman of the Volkswagen Group and was replaced by Bernd Pischetsrieder. The new chairman promptly sent the Veyron back to the drawing board for major revisions. Neumann was replaced as Bugatti president by Thomas Bscher in December 2003, and substantial modifications were made to the Veyron under the guidance of a former VW engineer, Bugatti Engineering chief Wolfgang Schreiber. The Veyron costs ‚Ç¨1,100,000 (net price without taxes); prices vary by exchange rates and local taxes (like value added taxes). Prices for the UK or the US are over ¬£880,000, or around $1,400,000. It was noted in an April issue of Live magazine (weekly men's magazine with The Sunday Times) that customers are free to order additional extras which can push the price up by the cost of a Rolls Royce Phantom. During an episode of Top Gear, the car was compared to the Concorde as a feat of technology.  Chiron  Bugatti Chiron At the 2016 Geneva Motor Show, Bugatti premiered the Bugatti Chiron as a successor to the Veyron. The pricing is set at 2.4 million euros. It is powered by a quad-turbocharged W16 engine with a peak power output of at 6,700 rpm and of torque starting from 2,000 to 6,000 rpm. It can accelerate from in 2.4 seconds according to the manufacturer and has an electronically limited top speed of ( without top speed key) for safety reasons, mainly arising from the tyres as the manufacturer concluded that no tyre currently manufactured would be able to handle the stress at the top speed the Chiron is capable of achieving. The base price is ( at the August 2016 exchange rate), and buyers were required to place a ( at the August 2016 exchange rate) deposit. Production is limited to 500 units. Unlike the Veyron, the Chiron is expected to make a profit. Divo alt= At the exclusive automotive event ‚ÄúThe Quail: A Motorsports Gathering‚Äú in Monterey, California, Bugatti premiered its latest model as a world premiere. The Divo takes inspiration from the Bugatti Type 57SC Atlantic along with the Bugatti Vision Gran Turismo concept in terms of design and has track performance as its main focus. The car is 8.0 seconds quicker than the Chiron around the Nard√≤ test track according to the manufacturer and generates of downforce at top speed, more than the Chiron. The top speed is, however, reduced to , owing to the extra drag produced by the aerodynamic elements and due to excessive pressure on the tyres resulting from a lower ride height. Power output is unchanged from the Chiron, with at 6700 rpm and of torque from 2000 to 6000 rpm. The production of the Divo is limited to 40 units and the car will be built alongside the Chiron at the Bugatti factory. The base price for the Divo was ‚Ç¨5 million (US$5.8 million), around twice the price of what the standard Chiron cost. La Voiture Noire alt= The La Voiture Noire (The Black Car) was a special edition car built and sold by Bugatti in 2019. It was presented at the 2019 Geneva Motor Show. The car pays homage to the legendary 'missing' Bugatti Type 57 SC Atlantic of Jean Bugatti. Only 1 of these cars were built and sold for a price of $12.5 million; making it the most expensive new car ever sold. Centodieci The Centodieci was unveiled by Bugatti in August 2019 and was made as a tribute to the EB110. Only 10 will be made and will be priced at 8 million euros each.

Don was controversially selected for the 2008 Beijing Olympics despite serving a ban for missed out of competition drug tests. At the Beijing Olympics Don failed to finish after exiting the swim in 48th place (out of 55) and was pulled out of the race by officials for being too far behind on the bike leg. The British team later admitted that he was ill prior to the Beijing race. On 3 September 2006 in Lausanne Don became World Champion after finishing 17 seconds in front of Hamish Carter. Following the swim, he was in the lead group on the bike but missed the initial break. He bridged the gap alone and caught the lead group on lap 5 out of 6, then took the lead along with Carter on the run, breaking clear about halfway through. However his performance was overshadowed by a three-month ban a few weeks later for missing three out of competition drug tests within an 18-month period prior to the race. The ban expired on 25 December 2006, but a byelaw meant that Don remained ineligible for Olympic selection. On Friday, 25 May 2007, Don was cleared by the British Olympic Association for selection for future Olympic Games after appealing against a ban for missing doping tests. The BOA appeals panel whilst clearing Don to compete in future Olympic Games criticised him for being \\"indisputably careless and irresponsible\\".

The term \\"≈çry≈çki\\" is mostly used in the sect of Zen Buddhism. In the and sects, the utensils are called jihatsu, which is written as ÊåÅÈâ¢ according to rinzai-sh≈´ and Ëá™Èâ¢ according to ≈çbaku-sh≈´. Jihatsu is also used to refer to the bowls alone The bowls usually made of lacquered wood, and utensils all bundled in a cloth. The largest bowl, sometimes called the Buddha Bowl or zuhatsu, symbolizes Buddha's head and his wisdom. The other bowls are progressively smaller. In describing the form of ≈çry≈çki used at John Daido Loori's Zen Mountain Monastery, author Jack Maguire wrote This is the formal style of serving and eating meals practiced in Zen temples. Buddhist tradition states that after Huineng received the monk's robe and bowl as evidence of his having received Dharma transmission, the bowl itself was considered a symbol of transmission from teacher to student. ≈åry≈çki have evolved in Buddhist monasteries in China and Japan over many years and are part of the Buddhist tradition that has now been transmitted to the West.

History The manual is a compilation of numerous scrolls and ancient scriptures pertaining to psychic powers, healing techniques, martial arts classics and Taoist philosophy. It was compiled by Huang Shang (ÈªÉË£≥) on the commission of Emperor Huizong during the Song Dynasty. Huang's compendium became the first volume of the manual. During the writing process, Huang enriched himself with Taoist knowledge and the principles of inner energy and qi. When combined with Huang's intelligence, the knowledge he acquired during the compilation turned him into a formidable martial artist. Soon after, the emperor appointed Huang to lead an army to eradicate the Ming Cult, a sect of Persian origin that had been involved in many anti-government activities. The Song army engaged the cult in a fierce battle but failed to capture the enemy's fortress. Huang fought with the cult's best fighters one-on-one and slew every single one of them until he was forced to retreat due to exhaustion. In retaliation, the Ming Cult dispatched the best of its surviving warriors to kill Huang's family. Huang was enraged and he vowed to destroy the cult. For the next four decades, Huang dedicated himself to experimenting with new techniques to counter those of the Ming Cult's martial arts. As many of the cult's members were affiliated to other sects, Huang had to develop new techniques that were capable of countering the other sects' martial arts as well. Huang succeeded in accomplishing his herculean task but his enemies had died during those four decades. Huang wrote the second volume of the manual, detailing his experiences and the new techniques he had developed and innovated during his 40 years of research.Cha, Louis. The Legend of the Condor Heroes (Â∞ÑÈµ∞Ëã±ÈõÑÂÇ≥). Hong Kong Commercial Daily, 1957 - Chapter 16 Earlier edition of The Legend of the Condor Heroes has the creator being Bodhidharma. First martial arts contest on Mount Hua The manual was lost for several years after Huang Shang's death. When it reappeared in the jianghu, it induced bloodshed as martial artists competed fiercely with each other to seize possession of the anthology of martial arts. Numerous lives were lost due to the ensuing chaos caused by the obsession with the book. To prevent further spilling of blood, martial artists decided to stage a martial arts contest on Mount Hua to determine who would be the manual's rightful owner. The Five Greats (\\"Central Divine\\" Wang Chongyang, \\"Eastern Heretic\\" Huang Yaoshi, \\"Western Venom\\" Ouyang Feng, \\"Northern Beggar\\" Hong Qigong and \\"Southern Emperor\\" Duan Zhixing) gathered on Mount Hua and agreed that the champion of the contest would gain sole possession of the manual. After an intense competition that lasted seven days, Wang Chongyang emerged as overall champion and won the manual for himself. Wang incorporated some of the manual's underlying principles into the martial arts of his Quanzhen Sect, most notably the Big Dipper Formation. He left a part of the manual that held the key to defeating the skills of the Ancient Tomb Sect in the tomb of his lover and rival Lin Chaoying. Before his death, Wang passed the manual to his junior Zhou Botong, warning the latter not to let the manual fall into wrong hands. Ouyang Feng had previously attempted to seize the manual during Wang's funeral after the latter's apparent death. However, Wang had faked his own death and he caught Ouyang completely by surprise. Ouyang was defeated and he fled. Wang also laid down a regulation that no member of Quanzhen is permitted to learn and use any of the skills in the manual.Cha, Louis. The Legend of the Condor Heroes (Â∞ÑÈµ∞Ëã±ÈõÑÂÇ≥). Hong Kong Commercial Daily, 1957 - Chapter 16 Peach Blossom Island After Wang Chongyang's death, Zhou Botong travelled to Peach Blossom Island, where Huang Yaoshi lives, to warn Huang not to think about stealing the manual. Huang tricked Zhou into allowing his wife Feng Heng to have a glance at the manual. Feng had eidetic memory and she memorised the text of the second volume after browsing through it once. She lied to Zhou that the manual was worthless, by reciting the text and claiming that it came from a book of childish rites she had read before. Zhou believed her and destroyed the book in anger. After Zhou Botong left, Feng Heng wrote a copy of the manual from memory for her husband. Two years later, Huang's disciples Chen Xuanfeng and Mei Chaofeng decided to elope as they fear that their teacher might oppose their relationship. They stole Huang's copy of the manual and fled from Peach Blossom Island. Huang was furious when he found out and he broke the legs of his other four students in anger and banished them from his island. Feng re-wrote the second volume of the manual from memory for her husband fearing that she would forget the manual and miss out on certain parts, which Huang would not be glad with as Huang was a martial arts maniac. However, tragedy struck as Feng rushed days and nights to finish the manual. It was to exhausting for her and after finishing the manual and giving birth, she died. Huang Yaoshi was filled with grief and he vowed to kill anyone who dared to learn anything from the book that cost the life of his beloved wife. Meanwhile, Zhou Botong realised that he had been fooled by Huang Yaoshi and he returned to Peach Blossom Island to confront Huang. He kept pestering and harassing Huang to hand the book to him. Huang was unable to defeat Zhou and could only imprison the latter on his island by sealing off all exit routes using a formation, a formation created by Huang using peach blossom and his knowledge of the Bagua and five elements. As for Chen Xuanfeng and Mei Chaofeng, they started practising the skills in the manual but had interpreted wrongly the underlying principles and mastered an unorthodox version of the skill, 'Nine Yin White Bone Claw' (‰πùÈô∞ÁôΩÈ™®Áà™). The manual read that the fingers/claw of the person would sink into the fatal points of the enemy, but they misinterpreted thinking the way to use this skill was to require human sacrifices during practice and hence instills fear in many martial artists by mere mention of its name. The original interpretation was to target the fatal points of the person, such as, by piercing the user's finger into the skull of the enemy and thus they do not truly master the skill. Apart from that, the couple also learned the 'Heart Shattering Palm' (ÊëßÂøÉÊéå) and Mei mastered the 'White Boa Whip Skill' (ÁôΩËüíÈû≠Ê≥ï). Chen and Mei became known as the \\"Twin Killers in the Dark Wind\\" for using those skills to commit heinous crimes and terrorize the jianghu. In the process of learning these skills they did not have sufficient inner energy and hence rushed the process of cultivating a strong inner energy by eating arsenic and forcing it out of their body. Arsenic was the most commonly known, strongest poison in ancient Chinese. The couple settled in Mongolia to avoid pursuit from their enemies in China. They met Guo Jing and the \\"Seven Freaks of Jiangnan\\" and engaged in a fierce battle. Chen was stabbed and killed by Guo for underestimating Guo as a child, while Mei was blinded by Ke Zhen'e's poison darts, but she managed to flee with her husband's dead body. As Chen had tattooed the text of the manual on his chest, Mei skins her dead husband and takes the grisly text with her. She later meets Yang Kang, who offers her shelter in an underground room in his house, and she teaches him the 'Nine Yin White Bone Claw' in return. Guo Jing Years later Mei Chaofeng encounters Guo Jing and the \\"Seven Freaks of Jiangnan\\" again at Guiyun Manor near Lake Tai and they engage in battle. Zhu Cong being a master at this, pickpockets Mei when he dusts her clothes after the fight and obtains the human skin copy of the manual and leaves it in Guo's possession. When Guo goes to Peach Blossom Island to seek Huang Rong's hand-in-marriage, he meets Zhou Botong there and they become sworn brothers even when Zhou was already past his prime age and Guo was no more than 20. Zhou still has with him a copy of the original first volume of the manual and he shares it with Guo as he was a martial arts maniac if could not understand the art he would pester anyone for it since Wang forbade his sect to learn it Zhou was also forbidden to learn he shared it with Guo as he found a suitable candidate to practise the skill and show it to him without him violating his senior wish. The first volume and the human skin copy of the second volume are then recompiled and imprinted in their memories. Guo incorporates parts of the manual's skills into his own repertoire of martial arts and becomes stronger. The power of his 'Eighteen Dragon Subduing Palms' is enhanced after the Nine Yin Manual's skills worked wonders by increasing his inner energy. His future spouse Huang Rong also benefits from the book. They later pass their knowledge of the manual to Yideng and their teacher Hong Qigong to help them recover from their internal injuries. Many decades later, after realising that Xiangyang (and the Song Dynasty) will eventually fall to Mongol invaders, Guo writes a copy of the Nine Yin Manual from memory and hides it inside the blade of the Heaven Reliant Sword (the latest edition of the third novel The Heaven Sword and Dragon Saber states that the scroll is hidden on Peach Blossom Island). He gives this sword to his younger daughter Guo Xiang, who will become the founder of the Emei Sect in the third novel. Ouyang Feng Ouyang Feng forces Guo Jing to produce a copy of the manual for him in his bid to become the most powerful fighter in the jianghu. Huang helps Guo write a fake copy of the book, with some changes to the text that only a really seasoned martial artist with the sense of contentment can detect. Some numbers were changed and verses were written in reverse order. When Huang Rong is taken hostage by Ouyang Feng later, he forces her to translate the last few verses in his copy obtained from Guo. Huang subtly changes the translated text and causes further complications. The result of all those \\"edits\\", ironically, increases Ouyang's powers but also causes him to become insane. Emei Sect Years before Zhou found the Nine Yin Manual, Chang Yuchun of the Ming Cult was wounded by a monk working for the Yuan government, who used the 'Heart Shattering Palm' on him. Chang's injury was so serious that he only managed to live until the age of 39. Guo Xiang founds the Emei Sect and she is the only person who knows the secret in the Heaven Reliant Sword. The mystery is only passed down from the sect's leader to her successor. A century later, Zhou Zhiruo succeeds Miejue as leader of Emei and she is tasked with retrieving the hidden scrolls in the sword. Zhou breaks the sword by clashing it against the Dragon Slaying Saber and obtains the Nine Yin Manual hidden in the sword's blade. She follows the shortcuts inscribed on the manual in her practice and masters the 'Nine Yin White Bone Claw', 'Heart Shattering Palm', and 'White Boa Whip Skill', just like Mei Chaofeng had done before her. As Huang had the time to spend to think of the fastest way to learn the skill without the prospects of danger, Zhou trains to learn the same techniques in a safer and less poisonous way. Zhou also teaches the Wudang Sect's renegade Song Qingshu the 'Nine Yin White Bone Claw'. Zhou encounters the Yellow Dress Maiden, a descendant of the Condor Hero Couple (Yang Guo and Xiaolongn√º), while wreaking havoc in the jianghu after Zhang Wuji betrayed her love. The Maiden uses an orthodox version of the skills in the Nine Yin Manual against Zhou and defeated her easily. Later when Zhou is injured by the Xuanming Elders' 'Xuanming Divine Palm' (ÁéÑÊòéÁ•ûÊéå), Zhang Wuji uses his 'Nine Yang Divine Skill' to heal her but it negates her 'Nine Yin Inner Energy'.

It is one of the 20 neglected tropical diseases listed by the World Health Organization, with elimination from certain countries expected by 2020. John O‚ÄôNeill, an Irish surgeon, first described Onchocerca volvulus in 1874, when he found it to be the causative agent of ‚Äòcraw-craw‚Äô, a skin disease found in West Africa. A Guatemalan doctor, Rodolfo Robles, first linked it to visual impairment in 1917. O. volvulus is primarily found in sub-Saharan Africa, and humans are the only known definitive host. It is spread from person to person via female biting blackflies of the genus Simulium. Morphology Photomicrograph (glycine mount) of several O. volvulus individuals O. volvulus parasites obtain nutrients from the human host by ingesting blood or by diffusion through their cuticle. They may be able to trigger blood-vessel formation because dense vascular networks are often found surrounding the worms. They are distinguished from other human-infecting filarial nematodes by the presence of deep transverse striations. It is a dioecious species, containing distinct males and females, which form nodules under the skin in humans. Mature female worms permanently reside in these fibrous nodules, while male worms are free to move around the subcutaneous tissue. The males are smaller than females, with male worms measuring 23 mm in length compared to 230‚Äì700 mm in females. The release of oocytes (eggs) in female worms does not depend upon the presence of a male worm, although they may attract male worms using unidentified pheromones. The first larval stage, microfilariae, are 300 Œºm in length and unsheathed, meaning when they mature into microfilariae, they exit from the envelope of the egg. Lifecycle The average adult worm lifespan is 15 years, and mature females can produce between 500 and 1,500 microfilariae per day. The normal microfilarial lifespan is 1.0 to 1.5 years; however, their presence in the bloodstream causes little to no immune response until death or degradation of the microfilariae or adult worms. Blackfly stages The lifecycle of O. volvulus # The microfilariae of O. volvulus are found in the dermis layer of skin in the host. # When a female Simulium blackfly takes a blood meal from an infected host, the microfilariae are also ingested. # From here, the microfilariae penetrate the gut and migrate to the thoracic flight muscles, where they enter the first juvenile phase, J1. # After maturing into J2, the second juvenile phase, they migrate to the proboscis, where they are found in the saliva. # J2 stage juveniles then mature into infectious stage three juveniles, J3, in the saliva. The lifecycle in the blackfly takes between one and three weeks. Human stages # When the female blackfly takes a blood meal, J3 juveniles pass into the human bloodstream. # From here, the juveniles migrate to the subcutaneous tissue, where they form nodules and mature into adult worms over a period of 6‚Äì12 months. # After maturation, the smaller adult males migrate from nodules to subcutaneous tissue, where they mate with the larger adult females. # The eggs mature internally to form stage-one microfilariae, which are released from the female's body one at a time and remain in the subcutaneous tissue. # The microfilariae are taken up by a female blackfly when she takes a blood meal, thus completing the lifecycle of O. volvulus. Disease O. volvulus causes onchocerciasis, which causes severe itching. Long-term infection can cause keratitis, an inflammation of the cornea in the eye, and ultimately leads to blindness. Symptoms are caused by the microfilariae and the immune response to infection, rather than the adults themselves. The most effective treatment involves using ivermectin, although resistance has been reported as developing to this drug. Ivermectin prevents female worms from releasing microfilariae for several months, thus relieving symptoms and temporarily preventing transmission. However, this does not kill adult worms, so it must be taken once annually as long as adult worms are present. O. volvulus has been proposed as the causative agent of nodding syndrome, a condition that affects children aged 5 to 15 and is currently only observed in South Sudan, Tanzania, and northern Uganda. Although the cause of the disease is unknown, O. volvulus is being increasingly studied as a possible cause due to its ubiquity in areas where the disease is found. Epidemiology Geographical distribution of O. volvulus as of March 2017: Endemic countries are shown in red, previous endemic countries in blue, and countries with no local cases in orange. An estimated 187 million people are at risk of O. volvulus infection, with 17‚Äì25 million people infected and 0.8 million showing some impairment of vision. O. volvulus has not directly caused a single death, but has cost 1.1 million disability adjusted life years, which measure the number of years of healthy life lost due to a specific disease and show the burden of a disease. Simulium blackfly adults require moving water to breed and eggs remain in water until they exit from the pupa and enter the adult stage of their lifecycle. Due to this restriction, O. volvulus is only found around streams or rivers. Artificial water systems, such as hydroelectric power plants, built in Africa, provide ideal conditions all year for blackfly development and make controlling its spread difficult. About 99% of cases of onchocerciasis are found in 31 countries in sub-Saharan Africa, although areas of limited transmission occur in Brazil, Venezuela, and Yemen. The disease is thought to have been imported into Latin America through the slave trade. Onchocerciasis was eliminated from Colombia in 2013, Ecuador in 2014, Mexico in 2015, and Guatemala in 2016 due to control programs that used mass drug administration with ivermectin. Genome Representation of the possible chromosome fusion seen in O. volvulus The total genome size of O. volvulus is 1.5x108 BP and contains around 4,000 genes, with genes for collagen and cuticular proteins being highly expressed in the mature adults. O. volvulus has four chromosome pairs, which include a single pair of sex chromosomes. A large X sex chromosome and a smaller Y sex chromosome determine male worms, while two X chromosomes determine female worms. One of the three nonsex chromosomes is thought to have formed by a fusion event between two smaller chromosomes. Evolution (Simplified phylogenetic tree of the genus Onchocerca.) O. volvulus has low genetic variation between individuals. This suggests a population bottleneck occurred in the past that caused a rapid decrease in the population size. It also shows high haplotype diversity, which is a measure of how unique a group of linked genes is. This pattern of low genetic variation and high haplotype diversity suggests fast population expansion after a bottleneck and has led to the theory that a host shift event from cattle allowed O. volvulus to infect humans. This is also supported by genetic data that place O. ochengi (a cattle-infecting strain) as the sister group to O. volvulus. Immune response Adult worms are found in nodules and are hidden from most components of the human immune system. Microfilariae are more vulnerable to attack by immune cells because they exit nodules to complete their lifecycle. O. volvulus can be detected by the immune system through the release of soluble antigens and antigens found on the surface of microfilariae and infective J3 juveniles. These antigens allow the immune system to detect the presence of a foreign organism in the body and trigger an immune response to clear infection. The immune response involves raising antibodies (IgG, IgM and IgE type) that can react with soluble antigens released by Onchocerca volvulus. Opsonising antibodies that tag cells for destruction are also found against the infective J3 stage and microfilariae, but there is not enough evidence at the moment to say whether this is protective. The antigens of O. volvulus are highly complex and show cross- reactivity with several other filarial worms. Little evidence indicates that antibodies made are specific to O. volvulus. However, after the age of 40, the number of parasites carried (the intensity of infection) decreases, suggesting that over time, some sort of protective immune response develops. Modulation by O. volvulus Microfilariae can also modulate the immune system to avoid destruction. The complement system is used to enhance the effect of antibodies and phagocytic cells, which engulf and destroy other cells. Microfilariae block this pathway by cleaving C3b‚Äîan important protein in this process‚Äîto form iC3b. iC3b cannot go on to activate the next step in the pathway and allows microfilariae to remain in the body with little to no attack by the immune system. Endosymbiotic relationship with Wolbachia O. volvulus, along with most filarial nematodes, share an endosymbiotic relationship with the bacterium Wolbachia. In the absence of Wolbachia, larval development of O. volvulus is disrupted or ceased. These bacteria have been proposed to enhance the symptoms and severity of onchocerciasis by triggering inflammatory responses in the host.

It was co-founded in New York City's fabled Spanish Harlem by three Puerto Rican Muslims - John (Yahya) Figueroa, Ramon (Rahim) Ocasio, and Freddie (Ibrahim) Gonzalez, who all lived within five blocks of each other. Alianza Islamica has become an iconic model for inner-city, grassroots Muslim activism with the new generation of Latino Muslim activists for its emphasis on bringing the message of Islam and Islamic service to the most disadvantaged and broken. The two remaining founders, Figueroa and Ocasio, have kept Alianza's message legacy alive through lectures, interviews and articles. most of which are available at the website alianzaislamica.org.  History  Figueroa, Ocasio, and Gonzalez all came of age during the tumultuous '60s and early '70s. As teenagers, they became associated with the militant Young Lords Party during that organization's heyday in New York City. Ocasio, Figueroa, and Gonzalez participated in organizations affiliated with the Party. That organization stood out for its activism, vigorous social and educational programs, and unwavering support for Puerto Rican independence. After ending their association with the YLP, Figueroa and Ocasio briefly joined the Nation of Islam breakaway group The Five-Percent Nation. Though short-lived, their exposure to the Nation of Islam, with its strong message of self-reliance and economic independence, was to become a significant influence. Between late 1972 and mid-1973, all three of the future founders converted to Islam. In 1975, Figueroa, Ocasio, and Gonzalez joined the Islamic Party of North America, a Washington, D.C.-based Muslim organization. It was the United States' first constitutionally-based indigenous Islamic organization. With a keen emphasis on disciplined, coordinated activism, the Islamic Party expressed Islam through civic engagement and addressed problems of poverty and social and economic injustice. Ocasio moved to IPNA's Washington headquarters and was eventually elected to that branch's Guidance Council. Meanwhile, Figueroa and Gonzalez continued the Party's work in New York. Ocasio rejoined Figueroa and Gonzalez in New York City in 1978. What followed were years of dawah (Islamic proselytizing) and attempts at organizing, which met with limited success. In 1986, the trio collaborated on a successful event at the Museo del Barrio on Fifth Avenue in New York entitled \\"Reclamado Nuestra Herencia Islamica (Reclaiming Our Islamic Heritage). There they met Daniel Ahmad Mena from Florida and Carl Askia Al Amin from Chicago, who, along with Figueroa, Ocasio, and Gonzalez, formed the first iteration of Alianza Islamica. A virtual, three-city partnership, it most notable accomplishment was its eponymous journal, the first bilingual Islamic periodical ever published in the United States. Logistical problems, however, led to the organization's dissolution after nearly two years. In the late 80s, Figueroa and Ocasio discussed going in a new direction: the establishment of a Barrio- based storefront center inspired by the Mosque of Islamic Brotherhood's tea room of the '70s. Its calm, non-intimidating ambiance would distinguish the center, and be the antidote to alienating high pressure evangelizing. The center would be an unassuming, unobtrusive, and an organic part of the neighborhood. Meanwhile, Figueroa's work with recovering addicts led to a sizable number of converts and the first-ever Muslim recovery group, Brothers in Recovery. With these new Muslims at its core, Figueroa and Ocasio decided to resurrect Alianza Islamica. A storefront was secured at 1717 Lexington Avenue, near 107th Street, in El Barrio, Spanish Harlem. Though Alianza Islamica's priority was the spread of the message of Islam, a more holistic approach was advanced to best serve its disadvantaged community. To that end, Alianza developed GED and ESL programs as well as programs on health and nutrition, employment assistance, and drug counseling. A significant number of spousal abuse cases, primarily in marriages between Latinas and Arab husbands, prompted Alianza Islamica also to take action in and initiate a counseling program in this area. At a time when Muslim institutions treated their fellow Muslims who died of AIDS/HIV as pariahs, Alianza became the first Islamic organization to ritually wash the bodies of their co-religionists who had died of the disease. Alianza Islamic also conducted outreach programs to educate Muslims and non-Muslims alike on AIDS/HIV. To dispel the spectre of the alien, Alianza embarked on Islamizing Latino cultural elements. At religious holidays such as Eid ul Fitr and Eid ul Adha, lamb and chicken replaced pork in traditional dishes, and congas and \\"guitarras\\" created a soundtrack authentically Muslim and Latino. Alianza Islamica cleared drug dealers from the neighborhood on at least two occasions. On the second occasion, the owner of a building across the street offered Alianza Islamica a new location in return for their assistance with ridding his building of drug dealers from the notorious Jamaican Posse. Alianza used the opportunity to establish La Mezquita del Barrio, the first Latino Muslim mosque on the East Coast, and quite possibly the nation. After Alianza cleared the drug dealers from the area, the landlord initiated eviction proceedings against Alianza. After its removal from the premises, Alianza resettled at 287 Alexander Avenue in the South Bronx. The organization disbanded shortly after a fire destroyed their building in 2005. 13.  Post Alianza Islamica  Ibrahim Gonzalez went on to a distinguished career as a musician, activist, and television and radio personality known primarily for his popular radio show on WBAI. He died in his sleep In 2013 at age 57. After 30 years on the railroad, Figueroa devoted himself to drug counseling and writing and lecturing on Alianza Islamica's legacy and Islam's spiritual dimension. Ocasio also ended his railroad career after 35 years and settled to a life of writing, lecturing, and spending time on the family farm.

He is best known as one-half of the tag team The Minnesota Wrecking Crew with Lars Anderson and Ole Anderson. He was a marquee performer for the National Wrestling Alliance (NWA) from the late 1960s, appearing with promotions including the American Wrestling Association (AWA), Georgia Championship Wrestling (GCW) and Mid- Atlantic Championship Wrestling (ACW). The Minnesota Wrecking Crew were named \\"Tag Team of the Year\\" by Pro Wrestling Illustrated in 1975 and 1977.  Early life Anderson was born in Saint Paul, Minnesota to Royal Anderson and Pauline Sergeant. He competed in amateur wrestling while attending South Saint Paul Secondary, becoming a state champion. He attended North Dakota State College of Science.  Professional wrestling career = Early career (1958‚Äì1961)  Anderson was trained by Verne Gagne, making his debut in 1958. He spent several years wrestling in Calgary, Alberta, Canada for Stampede Wrestling.  American Wrestling Association (1961‚Äì1966)  Anderson joined the Minneapolis, Minnesota-based American Wrestling Association (AWA) in 1961. In 1965, he formed the tag team The Minnesota Wrecking Crew with Lars Anderson, who was billed as his brother.  Georgia Championship Wrestling (1963, 1967, 1974‚Äì1981)  Anderson made his first appearance with the Atlanta, Georgia-based promotion Georgia Championship Wrestling (GCW) in 1963. In 1967, he and Lars Anderson held the NWA Southern Tag Team Championship (Georgia version) on two occasions. The duo also won the NWA World Tag Team Championship (Georgia version) in April 1967, vacating the championship later that year. Anderson resumed wrestling for Georgia Championship Wrestling (GCW) in the mid-1970s, this time with Ole Anderson as his partner. The duo held both the NWA Macon Tag Team Championship and the NWA Southeastern Tag Team Championship (Georgia version) on one occasion in 1974, and the NWA Georgia Tag Team Championship on seven occasions between 1974 and 1977.  Mid- Atlantic Championship Wrestling (1967‚Äì1985)  In 1967, Anderson (along with Lars) began wrestling for the Charlotte, North Carolina-based promotion Mid- Atlantic Championship Wrestling (MACW). After Lars relocated to Hawaii in 1969, Anderson reformed the tag team with Ole Anderson, who was also billed as his brother. Between 1970 and 1975, he and Ole Anderson won the NWA Atlantic Coast Tag Team Championship (renamed the NWA Mid-Atlantic Tag Team Championship in 1973) on six occasions. On January 29, 1975, the duo were crowned the inaugural NWA World Tag Team Champions (Mid-Atlantic version). They went on to hold the championship on six further occasions. The duo's final reign ended when they forfeited the championship in December 1981 after Anderson sustained an injury. In 1979, Anderson took control of Buddy Rogers' stable of wrestlers, naming it \\"Anderson's Army\\". Between 1979 and 1981, Anderson managed wrestlers including The Iron Sheik, Jimmy Snuka, Ray Stevens, The Masked Superstar, and Ivan Koloff. The stable was disbanded when Anderson reformed The Minnesota Wrecking Crew with Ole Anderson. In 1982, Anderson joined Sir Oliver Humperdink's stable, the House of Humperdink. Humperdink acted as Anderson's manager for the remainder of his time in Mid-Atlantic Championship Wrestling (MACW).  Retirement (1985‚Äì1991)  Anderson wrestled his final match in 1985. Anderson ran a professional wrestling school with Nelson Royal. Wrestlers trained by Anderson included Ken Shamrock. Anderson later became a deputy sheriff in North Carolina.  Personal life  Anderson was married to Edith \\"Edie\\" Anderson (n√©e Simpson). The couple had a son, Brad, who also became a professional wrestler, as well as two daughters, Alicia Anderson and Pauline Anderson.  Death  Anderson died of a sudden heart attack on October 31, 1991 while attending a training event in Huntersville, North Carolina.

The plasmid contains several reporter genes, most notably the green fluorescent protein (GFP) and the ampicillin resistance gene. GFP was isolated from the jelly fish Aequorea victoria. Because it shares a bidirectional promoter with a gene for metabolizing arabinose, the GFP gene is expressed in the presence of arabinose, which makes the transgenic organism express its fluorescence under UV light. GFP can be induced in bacteria containing the pGLO plasmid by growing them on +arabinose plates. pGLO is made by Bio-Rad Laboratories.  Structure  pGLO is made up of three genes that are joined together using recombinant DNA technology. They are as follows: *Bla, which codes for the enzyme beta-lactamase giving the transformed bacteria resistance to the beta- lactam family of antibiotics (such as of the penicillin family) *araC, a promoter region that regulates the expression of GFP (specifically, the GFP gene will be expressed only in the presence of arabinose) *GFP, the green fluorescent protein, which gives a green glow if cells produce this type of protein Like most other circular plasmids, the pGLO plasmid contains an origin (ori), which is a region of the plasmid where replication will originate. The pGLO plasmid was made famous by researchers in France who used it to produce a green fluorescent rabbit named Alba. Other features on pGLO, like most other plasmids, include: a selectable marker, Ori (origin of replication), and an MCS (multiple cloning site) located at the end of the GFP gene. The plasmid is 5371 base pairs long. In supercoiled form, it runs on an agarose gel in the 4200‚Äì4500 range.  Discovery of GFP  The GFP gene was first observed by Osamu Shimomura and his team in 1962 while studying the jellyfish Aequorea victoria that have a ring of blue light under their umbrella. Shimomura and his team isolated the protein aequorin from thousands of jellyfish until they gathered enough for a full analysis of the protein. It was through the study of aequorin that Shimomura discovered small amounts of GFP which glows green when aequorin emits blue light. After successfully discovering how GFP works with aequorin in the jellyfish, he set it aside to study bioluminescence in other organisms. Example of mutant GFP that glow different colors to paint a picture of a beach In 1994 Marty Chalfie and his team were able to successfully create bacteria and round worms that express the GFP protein. Soon after, Roger Tsien and his team were able to create mutant GFP that can emit a range of colors, not just green. The three scientist hold the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for 2008 for the discovery and development of the green fluorescent protein, GFP.

Built to transport coal from various mines to the ports of Sydney and Louisbourg, the S&L; operated in the eastern part of Cape Breton County, Nova Scotia. The railway uses a slightly different spelling for the town of \\"Louisbourg\\". 1720‚Äì1763, early efforts Mining of the Sydney Coal Field can be traced as far back as 1720 when French soldiers from Fortress of Louisbourg pried coal from exposed seams along the coast near Port Morien. Following the Seven Years' War, France ceded its remaining territories in Acadia and New France to Britain under the Treaty of Paris. Upon taking control of Ile Royale, Britain renamed it to Cape Breton Island and merged the territory into the Colony of Nova Scotia. 1763‚Äì1857, mining monopoly In 1784, Britain split the Colony of Nova Scotia, creating the colonies of New Brunswick and Cape Breton Island, reducing Nova Scotia to just its peninsular territory. In 1788, King George III authorized his son, Prince Frederick, the Duke of York, to be granted the mineral rights to Nova Scotia (then only the peninsular portion), however events such as the Napoleonic Wars put the application on hold until the end of conflict in 1815. At that time, the Duke was in financial difficulty and had an agent apply for the mineral rights which the King had authorized, however the paperwork was misplaced. In 1820, King George III died and the Duke faced financial ruin from debts; the same year saw the Colony of Cape Breton Island merged again into the Colony of Nova Scotia. In 1825 the unfinished application was discovered and approved (for all of Nova Scotia, including Cape Breton Island), whereby the Duke signed over the rights to the General Mining Association, a wholly owned subsidiary of one of the Duke's creditors: the London jewelry firm of Rundell, Bridge and Rundell. 1858‚Äì1890, organizing and merging 1876 -Mira River Railroad Bridge. Span of . The GMA maintained a monopoly on mineral rights throughout the colony until 1857-1858 when it relinquished these to the colonial government except for certain areas it had developed surrounding the Sydney, Pictou and Cumberland coal fields. Between 1858-1870, the GMA opened 19 underground mines in the Sydney Coal Field, with most production destined for export to the northeastern United States. In addition to the GMA, many independently owned collieries opened in the Sydney Coal Field after 1858, including several US- financed operations at New Victoria, Bridgeport, and Reserve Mines. Several small railways (such as the Glasgow and Cape Breton Coal and Railway Company, and the Cape Breton Railway) were built by mining companies during this time. Geographic obstacles to shipping coal were evident during this age of industrialization with the only suitable harbours being Sydney or Louisbourg; efforts to build harbours on the exposed coast near Glace Bay were rendered ineffective by the weather. Although Sydney had a much more suitable harbour than Louisbourg, the former was frequently choked by heavy sea ice during the important coal-shipment season throughout the winter months. Louisbourg Harbour, which had been selected by the French military for its year-round ice-free waters when building Fortress Louisbourg during the early to mid-18th century, again became a valuable port when a railway line was built from the mines at Reserve to Louisbourg in 1877. This line was poorly built and was soon lost to a forest fire. 1890s‚Äì1910, creation of conglomerates Large- scale industrialization came to the Sydney Coal Field when two large conglomerates were formed in the 1890s: the Dominion Coal Company, or DOMCO (in 1893), and the Nova Scotia Steel and Coal Company, or SCOTIA (in 1900). The latter was a successor to the GMA and focused its activities on the north side of Sydney Harbour, near Sydney Mines, whereas the former was a merger of various independent companies on the south side of the harbour. On February 1, 1893 DOMCO was incorporated and it acquired or purchased all coal mines and railway lines between Sydney and Louisbourg on the south side of Sydney Harbour. The conglomerate came to own a variety of both standard and narrow gauge lines, as well as various harbour facilities and coal mines. DOMCO immediately set about to standardize its operations. DOMCO's railway lines were operated as a department of the company and were rationalized beginning the following year in 1894 when the International Railway was extended to Glace Bay and Caledonia, permitting the abandonment of a roughly parallel narrow gauge line. In 1895 DOMCO extended its railway system south to Louisbourg, following a route further east than the previous 1877 attempt. In 1899, DOMCO financed the Dominion Iron and Steel Company Limited, or DISCO, which constructed a steel mill on the south side of Sydney Harbour in Sydney's Whitney Pier neighbourhood, opening in 1901; this was in direct competition to a rival steel mill that was built by SCOTIA at the same time on the north side of the harbour at Sydney Mines. In 1908 DOMCO built a spur to New Waterford and further spurs were built in the Port Morien, Birch Grove, Donkin and Broughton areas in the 1910s. During the early part of the 20th century, DOMCO's railway lines were considered to be among the most modern in Canada. 1910‚Äì1968, S&L; through boom and bust ca. 1900-1925 A view of the road (nearer) and Sydney and Louisburg Railway (further) bridges at the mouth of the Mira River at Mira Gut. Both bridges had swing spans to allow vessels to travel up the Mira River. After the railway shut down the nearer bridge was demolished and the further bridge was converted to carry the road. In 1910, the Sydney and Louisburg Railway was incorporated to operate all DOMCO railway lines. Note that the spelling of the name \\"Louisburg\\" is different from the spelling of the harbour and town of \\"Louisbourg\\", which follows the French naming found in Fortress Louisbourg. In 1914, the steel mill built by SCOTIA at Sydney Mines was closed, however the integrated mill at Sydney continued to expand, using Bell Island iron ore and locally produced coal as a fuel. In 1920, SCOTIA and DOMCO/DISCO merged to form British Empire Steel Corporation, or BESCO, which was reorganized as Dominion Steel and Coal Corporation, or DOSCO, in 1930; SCOTIA and DOMCO remained separate BESCO/DOSCO subsidiaries, with SCOTIA being reorganized as Old Sydney Collieries. S&L; generally served the DOMCO area to the south of the harbour, while the Old Sydney Collieries had its own small industrial railway which interchanged to the Intercolonial Railway line that ran around the west side of Sydney Harbour; the federal government-owned Intercolonial Railway (ICR) having built into the area in the 1890s. Following DOMCO's construction of the railway link between Sydney and Louisbourg in the mid-1890s, freight volumes rose sharply. Mining employment reached a peak on Cape Breton Island immediately prior to World War I and the dawn of increased mechanization of the underground collieries. The S&L; was operating over of track, of which was main line, and hauling in excess of 4 million tons of freight, mostly coal; this gave the S&L; the distinction of having the most freight per mile of any railway in Canada. In addition to freight, the S&L; also hauled passenger trains, mainly employees going to work in the mines or coming home; passenger traffic reached a peak of 176,000 revenue passengers hauled in 1913. Coal production peaked during World War II in the early 1940s and began to drop dramatically with the advent of internal combustion engines and other sources of heat. Due to the proximity and availability of the fuel, the S&L; was one of the last railways in North America to keep its fleet of coal-powered steam locomotives, with 31 on the roster during the 1950s and over 400 employees; the S&L; began to dieselize in 1960 however, the last steam locomotive wasn't retired until 1966. In 1961 DOSCO had its subsidiary the Cumberland Railway assume the operations of the Sydney and Louisburg Railway on Cape Breton Island. The reason for this change was that the S&L; had been formed under a provincial charter in 1910, which made it ineligible for federal railway subsidies, while the Cumberland Railway, which had a federal charter, qualified for federal railway subsidies. The road did business as the Sydney & Louisburg Division of the Cumberland Railway. With coal and steel fortunes flagging, DOSCO was purchased in 1957 as a wholly owned subsidiary of Avro Canada, whose assets were transferred to Hawker Siddeley Canada in 1962. Hawker-Siddley's DOSCO subsidiary announced in 1965 that its mines had only 15 years of production left and concluded that expense of opening new underground mines in the Sydney Coal Field would be too expensive. The company made its intentions clear that it would be exiting the coal mining business within months. In response to a vast public outcry in industrial Cape Breton County, the Minority government of Prime Minister Lester Pearson announced J.R. Donald would head a Royal Commission of Inquiry into the Cape Breton coal industry, with hearings held in 1965 and 1966. The Donald Commission recommended that a federal Crown corporation be established to acquire and manage DOSCO's coal operations, with the aim being to slowly wean the Sydney area economy off the coal industry. :\\"Future planning should be based on the assumption that the Sydney mines will not operate beyond 1981.\\" On July 7, 1967 the Cape Breton Development Corporation, or DEVCO, was established to operate the mines in the interim, while phasing them out throughout the 1970s and, at the same time, develop new economic opportunities for the surrounding communities. On March 30, 1968 DEVCO expropriated DOSCO's coal mines and the S&L;, settling with Hawker-Siddeley for a payment of $12 million. 1968 to today Sydney & Louisbourg Railway Museum The S&L; was reorganized as the Devco Railway, though for several years it continued to do business under its old name. With H.S. Haslam as general manager, the company operated of route with offices at Sydney; at that date it owned 15 diesel shunters and 1,100 freight cars.Henry Sampson (ed.), Jane's World Railways 1972-73, pp. 264-265. New York: McGraw-Hill Book Company, 1972. Although the old S&L; was essentially shut down in 1972, DEVCO then revised its plans to try and exploit the remaining deposits to the best of its ability. Thus DEVCO continued to operate modest rail services and add new spurs and other facilities where needed. The line east of Glace Bay to Louisbourg fell into disuse as older mines were closed. As part of a regional economic development initiative, DEVCO created a tourist railway named the Cape Breton Steam Railway, to operate between Glace Bay and Louisbourg. In 1973, the Sydney and Louisburg Railway Historical Society was created by retired employees of that company to assist with the tourist railway and to preserve the Louisbourg station. The tourist railway used former S&L; equipment and stations, however by the late 1970s it was proving uneconomic to operate and was closed. The track east of Glace Bay was abandoned at this time. DEVCO continued operation of the railway until 2001, when it closed the Prince colliery, its last underground coal mine. The railway's assets, which included railway track, railway rights-of-way, locomotives and rolling stock, and a coal storage facility and locomotive shops at Victoria Junction were sold to 510845 New Brunswick Incorporated, a wholly owned subsidiary of Emera, a Canadian multinational energy holding company based in Halifax, Nova Scotia. By 2003, the remaining railway was operating as the Sydney Coal Railway (SCR) which continues to operate a short line transporting coal from the international coaling piers on Sydney Harbour to the coal-fired Lingan Generating Station, owned by Emera.

Lilium formosana, a closely related species from Taiwan, has been treated as a variety of Easter lily in the past. It is a stem rooting lily, growing up to high. It bears a number of trumpet shaped, white, fragrant, and outward facing flowers. Features Plants tend to grow from about to tall. They have long oval leaves and the vein enters the horizontal direction. From April to June, the plant's flowering season, it produces pure white flowers on top of the stem. The stem has a cylindrical shape, with a diameter of about . Cultivation A variety of it, L. longiflorum var. eximium, native to the Ryukyu Islands, is taller and more vigorous. It is extensively cultivated for cut flowers. It has irregular blooming periods in nature, and this is exploited in cultivation, allowing it to be forced for flowering at particular periods, such as Easter. However, it can be induced to flower over a much wider period. This variety is sometimes called the Bermuda lily because it has been much cultivated in Bermuda. Lilium longiflorum 'Pink-Heaven' thumb thumb Use in Christian symbolism Lilium longiflorum is known as the Easter lily because in Christianity, it is a symbol of the resurrection of Christ, which is celebrated during Eastertide. The \\"lily has always been highly regarded in the Church\\", as Jesus Himself referenced the flower, saying \\"Consider the lilies how they grow: they toil not, they spin not; and yet I say unto you, that Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these\\" (). Moreover, according to pious legend, \\"after Jesus' death and resurrection, some of these beautiful flowers were found growing in the Garden of Gethsemane, where Jesus went to pray the night before His crucifixion. Legend has it that these flowers sprung up where drops of Jesus' sweat fell as he prayed\\". In many Christian churches, the chancel is adorned with Easter lilies throughout the Paschal season. A poem of the early 1900s titled Easter Lilies by Mrs. S.R. Allen, delineates this custom: History From the 1890s to the early 1920s, there was a thriving export trade of bulbs from Bermuda to New York. A disease affected the Bermuda lilies: this was identified by Lawrence Ogilvie. In 1903, USDA Agricultural Research Services (ARS) started to distribute disease free plant materials and seeds. The agency also started a breeding program, and released one of the first dwarf cultivars for potted-plant production in 1929. Prior to USDA's effort, lily bulbs were mostly imported from Japan before the 1940s. The supply of bulbs was suddenly cut off after the attack on Pearl Harbor and Easter lilies became extremely valuable in the United States. Currently, nearly all Easter lily bulbs used in North America are grown on coastal bottom lands in northwestern California and southwestern Oregon, particularly in the town of Smith River, California.  Chemistry  The Easter lily is a rich source of steroidal glycosides. It also contains bitter principles such as 3,6‚Ä≤-diferuloylsucrose.  Toxicity  Some Lilium species are toxic to cats. This is known to be so especially for L. longiflorum, though other Lilium and the unrelated Hemerocallis can also cause the same symptoms. The true mechanism of toxicity is undetermined, but it involves damage to the renal tubular epithelium (composing the substance of the kidney and secreting, collecting, and conducting urine), which can cause acute kidney injury. Veterinary help should be sought, as a matter of urgency, for any cat that is suspected of eating any part of a lily ‚Äì including licking pollen that may have brushed onto its coat.

Joseph E. Kurtz, D.D., the fourth Archbishop of Louisville,Cheny, David M (2007) Archdiocese of Louisville. Retrieved 2007-03-05. is in residence at the Cathedral. The Very Rev. Martin A. Linebach, Vicar General for the Archdiocese of Louisville, also serves as Rector.  History = St. Louis Church  In 1811, a small group of Catholics in Louisville formed Saint Louis Church at 10th and Main Streets. Previously, Father Stephen Theodore Badin, the first priest ordained in the United States, called the \\"circuit rider priest,\\" had served the Louisville area, along with much of the American frontier. In September 1821, Father Philip Hosten became the first residential pastor of Saint Louis Church. Fr. Hosten died one year later during an outbreak of yellow fever in the city. By 1830, a larger Saint Louis Church was built five blocks south of the Ohio River on Fifth Street. The Cathedral of the Assumption stands on that site to this day.  From Bardstown to Louisville  Image of the interior of the Cathedral, circa 1900. The Diocese of Bardstown, the first inland diocese in the United States, was established in 1808, with Benedict Joseph Flaget as the first Bishop of Bardstown. The diocese included most of Kentucky, Tennessee, Missouri, Illinois, Indiana, Ohio and Michigan. In 1841, the diocese was moved from Bardstown to Louisville, and Saint Louis Church became Saint Louis Cathedral. Bishop Flaget, now the Bishop of Louisville, decided in 1849 that a new cathedral should be built. However, Bishop Flaget died on February 11, 1850, a few months after the laying of the cornerstone for the new church building. His remains rest today in a chapel in the Cathedral Undercroft. The project begun by Bishop Flaget was completed by Bishop Martin John Spalding, the second Bishop of Louisville. On October 3, 1852, the new Cathedral was dedicated to the Blessed Virgin Mary under the title of the Cathedral of the Assumption. The new Cathedral was almost an identical but larger replica of its predecessor, St. Louis Church. The new Cathedral was built around St. Louis Church which, when the cathedral was completed, was disassembled and carried piece by piece out the front doors. The Diocese of Louisville was elevated in 1937 to become the Archdiocese of Louisville and the metropolitan province for all the dioceses in Kentucky and Tennessee.  Bloody Monday  The newly built Cathedral of the Assumption was nearly destroyed soon after its building due to anti-Catholic and anti- immigrant bigotry in the city of Louisville. On Monday, August 6, 1856, George D. Prentice, editor of the Louisville Journal, placed an article of his own opinion in the paper that speculated the possibility of takeover by immigrants: German and Irish. This also included accusations of vote tampering. Fearing for their safety, the \\"Know Nothing Party\\" of Nativists bombarded and ambushed local immigrant workers with ammunition, in total killing 22 German and Irish immigrants across the city. Also, the Cathedral and the newly built St. Martin of Tours (completed in 1854) were believed to house weaponry in their basements. They were threatened to be burned, but the mayor of the city at the time, John Barbee, himself a \\"Know-Nothing,\\" inspected the churches and cleared them of such accusations.  Renovation and revitalization  Night view of the restored Cathedral tower, after the 1998 renovations. With the 1982 arrival of the Most Reverend Thomas C. Kelly, the third Archbishop of Louisville, the Cathedral of the Assumption began anew as an archdiocesan center, under the pastoral direction of the Archbishop and the William L. Fichteman, the current Rector of the Cathedral. In 1985, the establishment of the Center for Interfaith Relations (formerly the Cathedral Heritage Foundation) began a push for renovation of existing facilities, expansion of the Cathedral complex, and revitalization of the Cathedral's mission to the broader community as a spiritual center in Louisville. Together, the Cathedral Parish and the Cathedral Heritage Foundation have brought the Cathedral into the new millennium. Renovation began in 1988 with the removal of sections of the Cathedral spire, along with the finial and cross. The year 1989 saw a comprehensive restoration plan adopted. In June 1991, after one hundred years of disuse, the completely restored Cathedral undercroft was reopened. Finally, in February 1993, renovation on the main Cathedral space began and continued for nearly two years. The grand reopening of the Cathedral was celebrated in 1994, with a completely renovated Cathedral space. In May 1994, Archbishop Kelly moved into the Cathedral rectory, making him the first bishop to live in Downtown Louisville in one hundred twenty years. In June 1998, the Cathedral spire and bell tower were completely renovated. In May 2005, the first phase of renovations began on the Cathedral School building, which now houses the Cathedral Parish office. Phase one renovations will provide more space for the parish offices while phase two will provide renovated, state-of-the-art practice space for the Cathedrals renowned choirs. The Cathedral complex now houses the main Cathedral building, with a Eucharistic chapel to the rear, as well as the Cathedral undercroft and St. Louis Hall, the Sandefur Dining Room for the homeless, the Patterson Education Center, the Cathedral school building (housing the parish offices), and the rectory, providing housing for the Archbishop and other Cathedral staff.  The Cathedral  The Cathedral alt= During the renovation of the Cathedral by the Conrad Schmitt Studios, the walls were faux finished to resemble stone blocks. The effect is convincing enough that many visitors to the Cathedral are astonished to learn that the walls are not actual stone. In addition, much of the architectural work around the Coronation Window is a faux finish. The stained glass that formerly stood in the side windows was removed to allow the congregation to view the surrounding buildings, in order to facilitate a sense of attachment to the community. The panels are now displayed in the front windows of the Cathedral's Patterson Education Center.  The nave  The nave, the body of the church, accommodates nine hundred sixty-six people for daily Masses and other ceremonies. The nave has no pews, utilizing individual, movable chairs, complete with kneelers. Usually arranged in straight rows facing the altar and allowing for a center aisle and two side aisles, the chairs may also be placed in rows the length of the church, facing each other across the center aisle for special services such as those of Holy Thursday, Good Friday, and the Easter Vigil. It may also be noted that during the renovations by Conrad-Schmitt, the entire building was cracked down the middle and deeply in danger of collapse. To resolve this, steel strand beams were mounted from wall to wall in the nave to provide a counter push and pull action, keeping the building from falling in or out. baptistry.  The baptistry  The baptistry holds a prominent position in the church because through it one gains entrance into the Church. A person being baptized may choose either immersion in the pool or infusion, pouring of water from the font. The old baptismal font was relocated to the rear of the nave, immediately inside the entrance doors, and an immersion pool, crafted of red granite, bronze, and marble from the original Communion rail, was added in the last renovation.  The altar  alt= The altar, the center of worship in the church, incorporates a base of gray marble and a red granite table like the granite of the Baptismal pool. The gray marble was taken from the original high altar, which was removed from the back of the sanctuary in the renovation following Vatican II. The brass Lamb of God, in Latin Agnus Dei, is a symbol of Jesus, the Paschal sacrifice offered on this altar. The gray marble base of the altar has carved on the right side an open book and several keys, on the left a bishop's mitre and crozier. The book represents God's word found in the Holy Scripture, the foundation of the bishop's teaching. The keys remind us of Christ's words to Peter, \\"I will give you the keys of the Kingdom of Heaven\\" (Matthew 16:19). The shape of the crozier recalls its origin as a shepherd's crook, or staff, suggesting the bishop's pastoral role, \\"Feed my lambs. Tend my sheep\\" (John 21:15‚Äì17).  The Coronation Window  The magnificent Coronation Window. The colorful Coronation Window illustrates the Cathedral's special dedication to the Virgin Mary, the Mother of Jesus, under the title of the \\"Cathedral of the Assumption\\". The window, designed and installed by the Blum Art Company of Louisville in 1883, depicts the crowning of the Virgin Mary as Queen of Heaven. It is one of the oldest American-made stained glass windows. This window, in the early half of the 20th century, had been moved to the front of the tower, with a new Assumption window replacing it. During restoration, the windows were switched to place the Coronation Window in its original place in the sanctuary. It was in this crane-operated delicate process that the building was cracked, temporarily halting all work. Conrad Schmitt Studios conserved the historic glass and restored the original appearance of the windows by painting the missing artwork on 2mm slide glass and sandwiching them to the conserved glass before re-leading. According to Catholic doctrine, after the Virgin Mary died, Jesus assumed her body into heaven. As the first among the faithful, she is a sign of the eternal goal toward which all the faithful advance. Centuries of Christian artists honored Mary's preeminence by depicting her being crowned as Queen of Heaven.  The ceiling fresco  The Ceiling Fresco depicts cherubs surrounding the Virgin Mary at the time of her assumption into Heaven. According to the Historic Structure Report of 1986, a Mr. Landrop, or Gandrop, of Cincinnati painted the fresco. The fresco remained until 1964, through many different changes to the interior. At that time, it was painted over after some plaster fell and was patched. It was rediscovered when again plaster fell from the ceiling, revealing the jewel that lay beneath. The fresco has been painstakingly restored to its earlier beauty.  The cathedra  The alt= The cathedra, behind the altar, is the official chair of the Archbishop. It is an ancient symbol of the tradition and authority of the bishop in the life of the Church. The cathedra represents his three main offices of teaching, sanctifying and governing. A cathedral houses the official chair of the bishop of the diocese. In Latin, the word chair is cathedra, from which the name cathedral is derived. The cathedra, upholstered in red suede, has painted on its back the coat of arms of the Archdiocese of Louisville. Symbols on the coat of arms, important to Louisville and the Archdiocese, include: * The fleur de lis, representing Louisville's French heritage * A crozier * A Star of David, an early symbol of the Virgin Mary * A stockade and water flowing downward, representing Fort Nelson and the Ohio River * Arrowheads representing the native peoples in this area The presider's chair was purchased from a local antique store because of its similarity in design to the cathedra. From here, the priest presides during the Mass. The Steiner-Reck pipe organ.  The organ  Above the entrance are the choir loft and the magnificent pipe organ built by Steiner-Reck, Inc., of Louisville in 1983. The organ features three manuals and forty-three ranks. Fanfare trumpets were added in 1994, along with both 32-foot ranks, full MIDI capability, and a Gothic casework of hand-carved mahogany. The center section of the loft railing is original, featuring small pointed arches with a reproduction of the design on the side sections.For more information on the organ, see Pipe Organs of Louisville, Kentucky  The ambo  The Ambo, or pulpit, incorporates gray marble and red granite. Here the scriptures are proclaimed, the responsorial psalm is sung, and the homilist addresses the congregation.  Role in the community  Interior view of the nave and chancel of the Cathedral of the Assumption. Like European cathedrals, the Cathedral of the Assumption has tried to respond to the needs of the community, serving as a hospice, an orphanage, and a shelter for the poor. Presentation Academy, Saint Joseph Infirmary, and Saint Vincent's Orphanage each grew out of the Cathedral undercroft. This tradition continues at the Cathedral of the Assumption, with many programs reaching out to the social and spiritual concerns of the community, including: * A Daily Lunch Program which serves approximately 125 homeless individuals * Dress for Success: A not-for- profit organization that helps low-income women transition into the workforce, providing resources and training on clothing, grooming, and professionalism * The Healing Place: Provides overnight shelter for the homeless, substance abuse programs for men and women, health care, meals, a clothes closet, and other services; provides care for mothers and their children who have fled abusive homes * Housing Initiative: volunteers for Repair Affair, Project Warm, Habitat for Humanity, and similar projects * Hunger and Poverty: involved in the AIDS Walk, Hunger Walk, the annual \\"Desserts Desserts\\" Festival, and special homeless dinners, particularly at Thanksgiving and Christmas.  The Center for Interfaith Relations  Founded in 1985 as the Cathedral Heritage Foundation, the foundation changed its name to the Center for Interfaith Relations in 2006 after achieving its three original goals. The primary mission was to undertake the restoration of the Cathedral. Twenty years later, it continues to provide community outreach, fulfilling a portion of the mission of the Cathedral. Development of spiritual, educational, and cultural experiences is CIR's continuing mission, with the goal of inspiring and fostering individual growth. In an expression of the Cathedral's commitment to ecumenism, CIR serves to increase understanding among diverse cultures and to advance ecumenical understanding.  Music at the Cathedral  alt= The Cathedral choirs have made three European tours, most recently in 2004 touring England and Ireland, singing at Killarney Cathedral, Gloucester Cathedral, and St. Martin-in-the-Fields under the direction of Dr. Phillip Brisson, DMA (Eastman School of Music, 2005), Director of Music for the Cathedral. The choirs have recorded two compact disks, and a third disk of their most recent international tour repertoire is in the planning stage. The Cathedral choirs have also performed many times with the Louisville Orchestra. The Cathedral Choir is a mixed choir of approximately forty-five voices and is completely composed of volunteer amateurs, with the exception of four paid section leaders. The Cathedral Choir of Trebles and Mixed Voices consists of approximately seven girls and boys ranging in ages from twelve to seventeen, three adult women and six adult men. The two choirs of the Cathedral, though rehearsing separately, sing the same literature for both Sunday morning Masses. Their repertoire includes examples of the great choral literature from early chant through the Renaissance, Baroque, Classical, Romantic, and 20th- century periods. They also come together for special projects, including the Masses of Holy Week and their acclaimed international tours. The Cathedral also boasts many talented semiprofessional cantors who share their gifts with the Cathedral community for weekend and Holy Day Masses. There is also a dedicated corps of weekday cantors who offer their services for each of the five weekday noon Masses. Additionally, the clock/bell tower is home to numerous Petit and Fritsen tuned bells from the Netherlands and is one of the few carillons in Kentucky. Smith's Bell and Clock Service from Mooresville, Indiana, is responsible for taking care of the bells and is currently renovating one of the clock face time pieces. Rappelling via a harness and pulley system was necessary to take the hands down and repair the clock movement. Other repairs and building renovation are currently in progress.  Covenant Community  The Cathedral of the Assumption welcomes members of Christ Church Episcopal Cathedral to visit the Cathedral, and the two Cathedrals have formed a covenant relationship. An annual Lenten Vespers is held by the covenant Cathedrals. The highlight of the covenant relationship is the joint Service of Light held on Holy Saturday. The congregations of both Cathedrals meet between the two churches and jointly bless the new fire used to light the Paschal candle. From there, each congregation processes to their respective Cathedral.  Sister parish  In November 2000, the Cathedral of the Assumption and St. Louis Parish (Jeremie, Haiti) formed a sister parish relationship. The exchange of gifts, talents, and spirituality is the goal of the sister parish relationship. Awareness and communication between the Cathedral of the Assumption and St. Louis Parish is maintained by the Sister Parish Committee.

It is situated close to Birmingham City Centre and is a Site of Importance for Nature Conservation. History The gatehouse at the entrance to the reservoir Boat house and Birmingham Level sluice gear on the dam Originally a small pool named Roach Pool in Rotton Park, it was extensively enlarged by Thomas Telford between 1824-1829 to supply water to the Birmingham and Wolverhampton Levels of the Birmingham Canal Navigations (BCN) canal system via Icknield Port Loop at the foot of the dam. It was excavated to a depth of 40 feet (12 metres) and covers an area of , holding of water, and was the largest expanse of water in Birmingham at the time. It is supplied by small streams and a feeder from Titford Reservoir (Titford Pools) in Oldbury. It was formed by damming a small stream. The dam is a 330-metre-long earth embankment with a height of 10 metres near the centre. The reservoir and gatehouse were designed by Thomas Telford and the latter is a listed building in corporate BCN octagonal style. In 1873, it was crossed by Charles Blondin, on a tightrope. His feat is marked by a 1992 statue on the nearby Ladywood Middleway ring road. Ecology The reservoir is surrounded by woodland and grassland. The total area of the site is . It supports a variety of birds, in addition to newts and bats. Leisure Sculpture of Charles Blondin In addition to supplying water to the canals, the reservoir is used for leisure activities including angling, sailing, windsurfing, canoeing, kayaking and rowing. Edgbaston Reservoir is home to three rowing clubs, Birmingham Rowing Club, Birmingham City University Rowing Club and the University of Birmingham Boat Club. All are housed within the same boathouse. The site has also been chosen to house a new Birmingham Schools rowing initiative, with the three aforementioned clubs assisting in the running of the scheme. Birmingham Canoe Club also shares the space during the summer months (June to September), paddling on the reservoir.Birmingham Canoe Club The Midland Sailing Club is also based at Edgbaston Reservoir,Midlands Sailing Club and often race sailing boats around a marked course. Windsurfers also use the reservoir. Further to this, TS Vernon Sea Cadets use the reservoir as a base. Until 2017 the Reservoir was home to Edgbaston Watersports, which provided water and land activities for school, college and youth groups from their base on the Icknield Port Road side of the reservoir. Since 2019 such water sports activities are provided by SailBirmingham.

As of April 2019 the car park is closed to vehicles after complaints of antisocial behaviour.Ladywood Police on Twitter Man standing on the frozen Reservoir in January 2010 Weather The reservoir usually has a gentle breeze across it due to the lack of large buildings or objects surrounding it, which makes it ideal for sailing. Sailors on the Reservoir During winter there can be strong, icy, northerly winds blowing over the city, which can freeze the reservoir over due to its exposed northern side (where the dam is situated). In recent years, the reservoir has frozen over - in both January 2009 and 2010 to the extent that it could be walked upon, although this is strongly discouraged. In the summer the reservoir is often extremely busy with members of the public coming for picnics and walks around the reservoir's perimeter path.

He signed many of his works, simply, \\"Gilroy\\". Life Born in Whitley Bay, Northumberland, England, Gilroy attended Durham University until his studies were interrupted by World War I, during which he served with the Royal Field Artillery. He resumed studying at the Royal College of Art in London, where he remained as a teacher. He taught at Camberwell College of Arts. In 1925, he gained employment at S.H. Benson's advertising agency, where he created the iconic advertisement art for Guinness featuring the Zoo Keeper and animals enjoying Guinness. He worked with Dorothy L. Sayers. He created cover designs for the Radio Times, most famously, in 1936, one depicting a laughing cat. He was also an accomplished portrait painter, numbering royalty, politicians, actors and many others amongst his sitters. He worked in his large studio at 10 Holland Park, London, the former home and studio of Sir Bernard Partridge. He was a long-standing and much loved member of the Garrick Club, where he was created a Life Member and Chairman of the Works of Art Committee 1970‚Äì1975.

These tests may be performed by medical specialists such as clinical neurophysiologists, physical therapists, chiropractors, physiatrists (physical medicine and rehabilitation physicians), and neurologists who subspecialize in electrodiagnostic medicine. In the United States, neurologists and physiatrists receive training in electrodiagnostic medicine (performing needle electromyography (EMG) and NCSs) as part of residency training and in some cases acquire additional expertise during a fellowship in clinical neurophysiology, electrodiagnostic medicine, or neuromuscular medicine. Outside the US, clinical neurophysiologists learn needle EMG and NCS testing. Nerve conduction velocity (NCV) is a common measurement made during this test. The term NCV often is used to mean the actual test, but this may be misleading, since velocity is only one measurement in the test suite.  Medical uses  Nerve conduction studies along with needle electromyography measure nerve and muscle function, and may be indicated when there is pain in the limbs, weakness from spinal nerve compression, or concern about some other neurologic injury or disorder., which cites * * Spinal nerve injury does not cause neck, mid back pain or low back pain, and for this reason, evidence has not shown EMG or NCS to be helpful in diagnosing causes of axial lumbar pain, thoracic pain, or cervical spine pain. Nerve conduction studies are used mainly for evaluation of paresthesias (numbness, tingling, burning) and/or weakness of the arms and legs. The type of study required is dependent in part by the symptoms presented. A physical exam and thorough history also help to direct the investigation. Some of the common disorders that can be diagnosed by nerve conduction studies are: * Carpal tunnel syndrome * Cubital Tunnel Syndrome * Guillain‚ÄìBarr√© syndrome * Guyon's canal syndrome * Peripheral neuropathy * Peroneal neuropathy * Spinal disc herniation * Tarsal Tunnel Syndrome * Ulnar neuropathy  Technique  The nerve conduction study consists of the following components * Motor NCS * Sensory NCS * F wave study * H-reflex study The nerve conduction study is often combined with needle electromyography.  Other  The Department of Health and Human Services Inspector General recently identified the use of NCSs without a needle electromyography at the same time a sign of questionable billing.http://oig.hhs.gov/oei/reports/oei-04-12-00420.pdf  Motor NCS  Motor NCS Motor NCS are obtained by stimulating a motor nerve and recording at the belly of a muscle innervated by that nerve. The CMAP is the resulting response, and depends on the motor axons transmitting the action potential, status of the neuromuscular junction, and muscle fibers. The CMAP amplitudes, motor onset latencies, and conduction velocities are routinely assessed and analyzed. As with sensory NCS, conduction velocity is calculated by dividing distance by time. In this case, however, the distance between two stimulation sites is divided by the difference in onset latencies of those two sites, providing the conduction velocity in the segment of nerve between the two stimulation sites. This method of calculating conduction velocity thereby avoids being confounded by time spent traversing the neuromuscular junction and triggering a muscle action potential (since these are subtracted out). '''  Sensory NCS  Sensory NCS are performed by electrical stimulation of a peripheral nerve while recording the transmitted potential at a different site along the same nerve. Three main measure can be obtained SNAP ( Sensory nerve action potential)amplitude, sensory latency and conduction velocity. The SNAP amplitude (in microvolts) represents a measure of the number of axons conducting between the stimulation site and the recording site. Sensory latency (in milliseconds) is the time that it takes for the action potential to travel between the stimulation site and the recording site of the nerve. The conduction velocity is measured in meters per second and is obtained dividing the distance between stimulation site and the recording site by the latency: Conduction velocity = Distance/Latency Sensory NCS: An example screenshot showing the results of a sensory nerve conduction velocity study of the right median nerve.  F-wave study  F-wave study uses supramaximal stimulation of a motor nerve and recording of action potentials from a muscle supplied by the nerve. This is not a reflex, per se, in that the action potential travels from the site of the stimulating electrode in the limb to the spinal cord's ventral horn and back to the limb in the same nerve that was stimulated. The F-wave latency can be used to derive the conduction velocity of nerve between the limb and spine, whereas the motor and sensory nerve conduction studies evaluate conduction in the segment of the limb. F waves vary in latency and an abnormal variance is called \\"chrono dispersion\\". Conduction velocity is derived by measuring the limb length, D, in millimeters from the stimulation site to the corresponding spinal segment (C7 spinous process to wrist crease for median nerve). This is multiplied by 2 as it goes to the cord and returns to the muscle (2D). 2D is divided by the latency difference between mean F and M and 1 millisecond subtracted (F-M-1). The formula is \\\\frac{2 D}{F-M-1}.  H-reflex study  H-reflex study uses stimulation of a nerve and recording the reflex electrical discharge from a muscle in the limb. This also evaluates conduction between the limb and the spinal cord, but in this case, the afferent impulses (those going toward the spinal cord) are in sensory nerves while the efferent impulses (those coming from the spinal cord) are in motor nerves. This process cannot be changed.  Specialized testing  Repetitive nerve stimulation = Small- pain-fibers method = In 1998, a small-pain-fibers (spf-NCS) method was cleared by the FDA. This method uses an electrical stimulus with a neuroselective frequency to determine the minimum voltage causing conduction. Rather than comparing the data with population averages on a bell-shape curve, which at best has about 65% sensitivity, the patient is his own control. In a three-year LSU Pain Center study, it was found that the nerve requiring the greatest voltage to cause conduction of the A-delta (Fast Pain) fibers identified nerve root pathology with 95% sensitivity. Besides being painless, the test is fast. This test can determine nerve impingement/pathology (pain causing) within the spine (nerve root level) where EMG and Velocity Tests fail. The test uses a potentiometer to objectively measure the amplitude of the action potential at a distant site along the nerve being tested. The patient confirms a sensation when the nerve fires. Objectivity of the patient's response is confirmed by the measurement of nerve recruitment for surrounding nerves and is displayed on the instrument. The impinged nerve (pain fibers) can only report (peak) momentarily while recruiting other nerves to assist and sustain the reporting of the stimulus. Non impinged nerves (pain fibers) do not recruit surrounding nerves and this is readily seen on the display. The spf-NCS does not require myelin loss to detect function change, so velocity is not measured. The Small-Pain-Fibers NCS (pf-NCS) is the preferred test with over 95% accuracy for determining the spine level(s) and side(s) for Small Pain Fiber impingement/pathology allowing for the most accurate diagnosis and treatment procedures for patients experiencing back pain. Patients diagnosed with the EMG/NCV studies alone (while experiencing pain but having no significant myelin loss) were misdiagnosed in over 50% of cases including the diagnosis and treatment of incorrect nerve root levels and sides in patients. Interpretation of nerve conductions The interpretation of nerve conduction studies is complex and requires the expertise of health care practitioners such as clinical neurophysiologists, medical neurologists, physical therapists, chiropractic neurologists or physiatrists. In general, different pathological processes result in changes in latencies, motor, and/or sensory amplitudes, or slowing of the conduction velocities to differing degrees. For example, slowing of the NCV usually indicates there is damage to the myelin. Another example, slowing across the wrist for the motor and sensory latencies of the median nerve indicates focal compression of the median nerve at the wrist, called carpal tunnel syndrome. On the other hand, slowing of all nerve conductions in more than one limb indicates generalized diseased nerves, or generalized peripheral neuropathy. People with diabetes mellitus often develop generalized peripheral neuropathy.''' Patient risk Nerve conduction studies are very helpful to diagnose certain diseases of the nerves of the body. The test is not invasive, but can be painful due to the electrical shocks. The shocks are associated with a low amount of electric current so they are not dangerous to anyone. Patients with a permanent pacemaker or other such implanted stimulators such as deep brain stimulators or spinal cord stimulators must tell the examiner prior to the study. This does not prevent the study, but special precautions are taken. Cardiac pacemakers and implanted cardiac defibrillators (ICDs) are used increasingly in clinical practice, and no evidence exists indicating that performing routine electrodiagnostic studies on patients with these devices pose a safety hazard. However, there are theoretical concerns that electrical impulses of nerve conduction studies (NCS) could be erroneously sensed by devices and result in unintended inhibition or triggering of output or reprogramming of the device. In general, the closer the stimulation site is to the pacemaker and pacing leads, the greater the chance for inducing a voltage of sufficient amplitude to inhibit the pacemaker. Despite such concerns, no immediate or delayed adverse effects have been reported with routine NCS.. No known contraindications exist from performing needle EMG or NCS on pregnant patients. In addition, no complications from these procedures have been reported in the literature. Evoked potential testing, likewise, has not been reported to cause any problems when it is performed during pregnancy.

This roadlink is composed of several bridges, viaducts and earth-filled sections. It crosses the main course of the Paran√° River and touches down on several islands of the Paran√° Delta in the way. Works on the project began in 1998, but they were repeatedly interrupted due to lack of continued funding from the national and the provincial state, especially in the worst part of the Argentine economic crisis of 2001. Public transit access to the bridge was opened on May 20, 2003. The link between the two cities spans a total of 59.4 kilometers (37 mi). The total length of the various bridges and their viaducts is 12.2 km (7.5 mi). The main bridge is 4,098 meters (13,440 ft) long, with central cable-stayed span of 350 meters (1,148 ft). Among the materials used were about 250,000 cubic meters (326,987 yd¬≥) of concrete, 63,000 tons of ADN-420 type steel, and 17,618 tons of asphalt. The access to the main bridge on the western side is in the northern border of Rosario, on the limit with the city of Granadero Baigorria. The official name of the main bridge (cable-stayed) is Nuestra Se√±ora del Rosario (Our Lady of Rosario). The project was executed by a private company (Puentes del Litoral S. A.), which was granted subsidies from the national state and the provincial states of Santa Fe and Entre R√≠os, totalling about $385 million . The company received the operation and maintenance concession of the bridge for 25 years. Until the opening of this bridge, the only road link between the two provinces, and between two commercially very important regions of Argentina, was the Hernandarias Subfluvial Tunnel which joins the cities of Santa Fe and Paran√°, about 120 kilometers (75 mi) north from Rosario. The southern Paran√° is crossed by another cable-stayed bridge, the Z√°rate-Brazo Largo Bridge, joining Entre R√≠os and Buenos Aires province.

The show was first aired on April 18, 1983, the day The Disney Channel was launched.The Disney Channel Magazine, April/May 1983 (Premiere Issue), pp. 7, 14. Its timeslot for its early run was at 8:30 a.m. Eastern/Pacific Time, making it the third program of The Disney Channel's 16 (later 18) hour programming day. Reruns of the show aired on The Disney Channel until May 30, 1997.TV Guide - May 24-30, 1997 Hal Smith, Will Ryan, and Laurie Main were the only three actors from the original four Pooh shorts to reprise their roles here (Smith, who had voiced Owl ever since the beginning of Disney's Winnie the Pooh franchise, had recently replaced Sterling Holloway as the voice of Pooh; Ryan had provided Rabbit's voice in the 1983 short Winnie the Pooh and a Day for Eeyore, replacing Junius Matthews; and Main was the narrator for Winnie the Pooh and a Day for Eeyore, replacing Sebastian Cabot). The show's title derives from the second Winnie the Pooh storybook, The House at Pooh Corner. Background This series was the only incarnation in the history of Disney's incarnations of Winnie the Pooh in which we could actually see the narrator aside from only hearing his voice. He would present each episode. The show would start off with him greeting the viewers \\"Welcome to Pooh Corner\\" and then relate what he was talking about to an event that occurred in the Hundred Acre Wood, the home of the Pooh characters, and then he would proceed to read from a book entitled Welcome to Pooh Corner. He would then narrate the episode acted out by the characters. The action was filmed before a blue screen, rather than using traditional sets (the same technique was used for Dumbo's Circus, another live-action/puppet series that ran on The Disney Channel). Since the show was designed for The Disney Channel before it began airing commercials, there were no breaks for commercials. As a result, the show lasted a full thirty minutes. The main story ran about twenty minutes followed by two shorter segments. The first segment was a sing-along music video featuring one of nine songs, used over and over throughout the show's run. These songs were written by the Oscar-winning Sherman Brothers who had provided the majority of the Winnie the Pooh music over the years. The Sherman Brothers also wrote the show's theme song, using the music from the original Winnie-the-Pooh theme song from The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh, albeit with a slightly altered tempo. The last segment of the show was a presentational arts and crafts demonstration that took place at the Thoughtful Spot. One of the cast members would speak to the narrator, looking directly into the camera, while they showed the viewers at home how to make something. When the series first started out, the narrator was seen sitting in a small library. As the series progressed, he is moved into a small playroom which eventually is seen having plush versions of Pooh and his friends.

Collection du Mus√©e r√©gional de Vaudreuil-Soulanges Joseph Quesnel (15 November 1746 ‚Äì 2 or 3 July 1809) was a French Canadian composer, poet, playwright and slave- trader. Among his works were two operas, Colas et Colinette and Lucas et C√©cile; the former is considered to be the first Canadian opera. Early life and education Quesnel was born in Saint-Malo, France, the third child of Isaac Quesnel de La Rivaudais (1712-1779), a prosperous merchant, and his wife P√©lagie-Jeanne-Marguerite Duguen. He studied at the Coll√®ge Saint-Louis (1766). Life and career Quesnel joined the French merchant marine and sailed to Pondicherry and Madagascar, travelled in Africa, and the Caribbean. He engaged in the Atlantic slave trade. In 1768, as a second-lieutenant on board the Mesny, he sailed to Cabinda (modern-day Angola) where 514 \\"Blacks of all ages\\" were purchased and taken to modern-day Haiti where they were sold, according to French archival sources quoted in a novel about him. He carried with him his violin and read the works of French playwrights. In 1779, Quesnel sailed for New York in command of a French warship which was captured by the British. Quesnel was taken to Halifax, Nova Scotia and allowed to settle in Boucherville, near Montreal, Quebec. He married Marie-Josephte Deslandes there and became partners in business with Maurice-R√©gis Blondeau, his mother-in- law's new husband. He became wealthy by trading in slaves. Quesnel published a number of theatrical works, including Colas et Colinette, which was written in 1788 and first performed in 1790, and Lucas et Cecile; he also wrote poetry; his best known poem was titled \\"L'√âp√Ætre √† M. Labadie\\". Besides several songs, he composed sacred music for the parish church of Montreal, and some motets, and wrote a short treatise on the dramatic art (1805). He founded and was part of the troupe of Montreal's Th√©√†tre de Societ√©. He died of pleurisy at Montreal in 1809 several months after he had dived into the Saint Lawrence River to save a drowning child.Contemporary Canadian Composers ed. by Keith MacMillan and John Beckwith. Toronto : Oxford University Press, 1975 Quesnel was the subject of the comic opera Le P√®re des amours, written by Eug√®ne Lapierre in 1942. Family Quesnel's son Jules Maurice Quesnel travelled with Simon Fraser on his journey to the Pacific Ocean; the town of Quesnel, British Columbia is named for him.

In 1969 Gene then brought in Alan Rogowski, and renamed him Ole Anderson. They dominated tag team wrestling in the 1970s, winning the NWA World Tag Team Titles 8 times. Over those years, Lars Anderson was on occasion brought back in as part of this team. When Gene stopped wrestling in 1981 to manage, the team was disbanded. In 1985, Ole reformed the Crew with Arn Anderson (his kayfabe nephew) as his partner. They won the NWA National Tag Team Titles and were members of the original Four Horsemen as the Wrecking Crew. They disbanded in 1987 when Ole was kicked out of the Horsemen. Arn and Ole revived the Wrecking Crew in 1990 but it lasted for only a few months before Ole retired. Ole managed the Minnesota Wrecking Crew 2 in NWA in 1990 while Arn was out injured. It was two wrestlers from Minnesota in masks, Mike Enos and Wayne Bloom.

History=Early life Born in Palmers Green, North London, Oldfield and his siblings were raised in the Roman Catholic faith of their mother, Maureen. Oldfield spent his childhood partly in Dublin and partly in Reading, Berkshire. He later attended Douai School a Benedictine monastery school and also spent a few terms at the Oratory School in Woodcote, Oxfordshire. His earliest musical experiences were in the myriad of folk clubs that sprang up in the UK during the late 1960s and early 1970s, listening to the songs of Leonard Cohen, Bert Jansch, John Renbourn and Bob Dylan. Oldfield left school at 16 to travel the world and worked as a roadie for various bands including The Byrds. During an extended stay on the Greek island of Hydra, he took up his first musical instrument, the flute. \\"I think it was learning to play in this way, with no formal guidance, that allowed me to develop the ability to compose music. I spent many happy days improvising tunes and discovering scales and arpeggios for myself, and soon started to teach myself to write these things down\\". Terry's only formal music training was in Agra, India, where he spent some time learning to play the tabla. In the early 1970s, Terry and his brother Mike formed a band called 'Barefoot' (or 'Barefeet') playing rock'n'roll at colleges and clubs throughout the UK. Mike later went on to record the highly successful Tubular Bells and Terry played the flute in the live performance at the Queen Elizabeth Hall, June 25, 1973, London. Terry also appears on Mike's albums Hergest Ridge (woodwind ‚Äì uncredited), Ommadawn (pan-pipes) and extensively on Incantations (flute). Solo career Terry, his brother Mike and his sister Sally all completed the Exegesis Programme Large Group Awareness Training course. Terry recorded a piece of flute music which was used to accompany the last section of the course. Oldfield's career began in earnest when he was asked by the BBC to compose music for a series called Great Railway Journeys of the World. Since then Oldfield has composed music for over 50 film and TV productions, receiving two Emmy nominations for Land of the Tiger and Twilight of the Dreamtime and a BAFTA nomination for the BBC series Kingdom of the Ice Bear. He also worked on Meerkats United, which in a National Television Poll was voted 'Best Wildlife Film Ever'. Oldfield had a relationship with New World Music, one of the world's leading 'World' music labels, for over 10 years and has a back catalogue of over 15 recordings. In 2001, Oldfield signed a multi- record contract with New Earth Records in Santa Fe, New Mexico. His work contains a wide range of ideas and influences and has sold over one million units worldwide. Currently Oldfield has been looking at new directions to take his music. \\"Recently I have found the advent of Global music very inspiring. Especially the Amnesty International Concerts\\". In 2001, Oldfield moved to Australia.

Richard Stallman illustrating his famous sentence \\"Think free as in free speech, not free beer\\" with a beer glass. Brussels, RMLL, 9 July 2013 An advertising mascot dressed as a mug of beer, holding a sign saying \\"Piwo gratis\\" (Polish for \\"free beer\\") in the centre of Krak√≥w, Poland, advertising beer being given away without charge. The English adjective free is commonly used in one of two meanings: \\"for free\\" (gratis) and \\"with little or no restriction\\" (libre). This ambiguity of free can cause issues where the distinction is important, as it often is in dealing with laws concerning the use of information, such as copyright and patents. The terms gratis and libre may be used to categorise intellectual property, particularly computer programs, according to the licenses and legal restrictions that cover them, in the free software and open source communities, as well as the broader free culture movement. For example, they are used to distinguish freeware (software gratis) from free software (software libre). Richard Stallman summarised the difference in a slogan: \\"Think free as in free speech, not free beer.\\" Gratis Gratis in English is adopted from the various Romance and Germanic languages, ultimately descending from the plural ablative and dative form of the first-declension noun grƒÅtia in Latin. It means \\"free\\" in the sense that some goods or service is supplied without need for payment, even though it may have value.  Libre  Libre in English is adopted from the various Romance languages, ultimately descending from the Latin word lƒ´ber; its origin is closely related to liberty. It denotes \\"the state of being free\\", as in \\"liberty\\" or \\"having freedom\\". The Oxford English Dictionary (OED) considers libre to be obsolete,OED.com, OED definition of libre: \\"Obs. Of the will: Free\\". Access to the OED is libre, but not gratis. but the word has come back into limited use. Unlike gratis, libre appears in few English dictionaries, although there is no other English single-word adjective signifying \\"liberty\\" exclusively, without also meaning \\"at no monetary cost\\".  \\"Free beer\\" vs \\"freedom of speech\\" distinction  In software development, where the cost of mass production is relatively small, it is common for developers to make software available at no cost. One of the early and basic forms of this model is called freeware. With freeware, software is licensed freely for regular use: the developer does not gain any monetary compensation. With the advent of the free software movement, license schemes were created to give developers more freedom in terms of code sharing, commonly called open source or free and open-source software (called FLOSS, FOSS, or F/OSS). As the English adjective free does not distinguish between \\"for free\\" and \\"liberty\\", the phrases \\"free as in freedom of speech\\" (libre, free software) and \\"free as in free beer\\" (gratis, freeware) were adopted. Many in the free software movement feel strongly about the freedom to use the software, make modifications, etc., whether or not this freely usable software is to be exchanged for money. Therefore, this distinction became important. These phrases have become common, along with gratis and libre, in the software development and computer law fields for encapsulating this distinction. The distinction is similar to the distinction made in political science between positive liberty and negative liberty. Like \\"free beer\\", positive liberty promises equal access by all without cost or regard to income, of a given good (assuming the good exists). Like \\"free speech\\", negative liberty safeguards the right to use of something (in this case, speech) without regard to whether in a given case there is a cost involved for this use (e.g. you still have free speech to write an essay or a lyric, even though you may have to pay for a quote, manifest or almost).  Use in open-access academic publishing  In order to reflect real-world differences in the degree of open access, the distinction between gratis open access and libre open access was added in 2006 by Peter Suber and Stevan Harnad, two of the co-drafters of the original Budapest Open Access Initiative definition of open access publishing.Suber, Peter. 2008.\\"Gratis and Libre Open Access\\". Retrieved on 2011-12-03. Gratis open access refers to online access free of charge (which Wikipedia indicates with the icon ), and libre open access refers to online access free of charge plus some additional re-use rights (Wikipedia icon ). Libre open access is equivalent to the definition of open access in the Budapest Open Access Initiative, the Bethesda Statement on Open Access Publishing and the Berlin Declaration on Open Access to Knowledge in the Sciences and Humanities. The re-use rights of libre OA are often specified by various specific Creative Commons licenses; these almost all require attribution of authorship to the original authors. Comparison with use in software The original gratis/libre distinction concerns software (i.e., code), with which users can potentially do two kinds of things: 1. access and use it; and 2. modify and re-use it. \\"Gratis\\" pertains to being to access and use the code, without a price-barrier, while \\"libre\\" pertains to being to modify and re-use the code, without a permission barrier. The target content of the open access movement, however, is not software but published, peer-reviewed research journal article texts. 1\\\\. Source code accessibility and use. For published research articles, the case for making their text accessible free for all online (Gratis) is even stronger than it is for software code, because in the case of software, some developers may wish to give their code away for free, while others may wish to sell it, whereas in the case of published research article texts, all their authors, without exception, give them away for free: None seek or get royalties or fees from their sale.Harnad, Stevan (2003) For Whom the Gate Tolls Journal of Postgraduate Medicine 49: 337-342 On the contrary, any access-denial to potential users means loss of potential research impact (downloads, citations) for the author's research‚Äîand researcher-authors' employment, salary, promotion and funding depends in part on the uptake and impact of their research. 2\\\\. Source code modifiability and re-use. For published research articles, the case for allowing text modification and re- use is much weaker than for software code, because, unlike software, the text of a research article is not intended for modification and re-use. (In contrast, the content of research articles is and always was intended for modification and re-use: that is how research progresses.) There are no copyright barriers to modifying, developing, building upon and re-using an author's ideas and findings, once they have been published, as long as the author and published source are credited‚Äîbut modifications to the published text are another matter. Apart from verbatim quotation, scholarly/scientific authors are not in general interested in allowing other authors to create \\"mashups\\" of their texts. Researcher-authors are all happy to make their texts available for harvesting and indexing for search as well as data-mining, but not for re-use in altered form (without the permission of the author). The formal analogy between open software and open access has been made,Suber, Peter (2008) Gratis and libre open access SPARC Open Access Newsletter, August 2, 2008 along with the generalization of the gratis/libre distinction from the one field to the other.

Construction The cornerstone was laid on July 16, 1816, with construction beginning thereafter, with the use of slave labor. Materials used for its construction were found in the immediate area. The architect and builder was John Rogers of Baltimore. By 1819 it was sufficiently completed for Mass to be held. The interior was fully complete by 1823. Many of the paintings and interior decorations were donated by Pope Leo XII, King Louis-Philippe of France and others. The gift from the King of France included paintings by Murillo, Van Dyke and others. Gifts of royal embroidered vestments‚Äîthe handwork of the queen and her court‚Äîand sacramental vessels were also made.the Altoona Mirror, March 30, 1928, page 2.

Thieves entered the church in the middle of the night and cut the paintings from their frames. The stolen paintings were: ‚ÄúThe Flaying of St. Bartholomew,‚Äù ‚ÄúThe Coronation,‚Äù ‚ÄúThe Descent of the Holy Ghost,‚Äù ‚ÄúSt. Anne,‚Äù ‚ÄúThe Blessed Virgin,‚Äù and four Stations of the Cross. The paintings were recovered by the F.B.I. in April of 1953. Four were found rolled up in the trunk of a car in Chicago, and five had been purchased by a New York buyer. The paintings remained in good condition. Twelve men were arrested in connection with the robbery, but only one, Norton Kretske, was sentenced. His conviction was overturned by the U.S. Supreme Court due to lack of evidence. The paintings were returned in 1957 and were rehung in the church in 1958. Painting from King Francis I of the Two Sicilies The Martyrdom of St. Bartholomew, Mattia Preti The Martyrdom of St. Bartholomew, Mattia Preti, was painted in Naples around 1650. In the early 19th century, King Francis I of the Two Sicilies made a gift of the picture to the Saint Joseph Proto- Cathedral in Bardstown, Kentucky, where it remains to this day. After suffering many years of neglect and misguided restorations (including complete over-painting of the surface in the 1950s), the picture was sent to the Getty for study and development of a plan for treatment. Two years of difficult work have restored the picture, and the exceptional character and quality of the original is once again visible. The painting was returned to Bardstown in time for re-consecration of the Proto-Cathedral as a Basilica in August, 2002. Historical significance Interior showing altar The proto-cathedral is the first Catholic Cathedral west of the Allegheny Mountains. On January 9, 1974, the proto-cathedral was listed on the National Register of Historic Places. On June 3, 1976, the listing was expanded to include the adjacent Spalding Hall and Flaget Hall, originally St. Joseph College. Over time, the location of the cornerstone was lost, until 1980 when it was uncovered during restoration of part of the building. On July 18, 2001, Pope John Paul II elevated it to the honor of a minor basilica church and an umbraculum was installed at the altar.The Casa Grande (Arizona) Dispatch, September 7, 2002, page 12 One of the most famous people from this church is Daniel Rudd. Daniel Rudd (August 7, 1854‚Äî1933) was a Catholic journalist and civil rights leader who lived his early years in Bardstown, Kentucky on Anatok Plantation, where he was born into slavery. Daniel Rudd was born on August 7th, 1854 in Bardstown, Kentucky to slave parents Robert and Elizabeth Rudd. Rudd and all 11 of his siblings were baptized in the Catholic church. Rudd was very religious, and it is unknown at what point in his life he decided to make it his life's work. Daniel Rudd moved to Springfield, Ohio in 1881 and stayed there until 1886. His journalism career started at the Sunday News. While Rudd was working at the Sunday News, he was a printer, reporter, and editor who was interested in following a Fredrick Douglass-like advocacy that was aimed at protecting the civil rights of African Americans. He believed that the press played a large role in black advancement. Rudd also thought that editors and journalists had the ability to persuade and educate Catholic, business and civic leaders. In 1885 Rudd began his first Catholic newspaper called the Ohio Tribune, he later changed the name to the American Catholic Tribune. This newspaper became the first black owned and operated national Catholic newspaper. After he founded his own newspapers, including the American Catholic Tribune in 1887, Rudd began believing that the newspaper was important in promoting the church as a transformational institution that was capable of bringing equality and social justice for African Americans. He was less concerned with the equality and social justice for other minorities such as Mexican Americans, Native Americans, and Chinese Americans. ‚ÄúCardinal Gibbons, arch-bishop of Baltimore, Md., the most Reverend Archbishops of Cincinnati and Philadelphia, and the Right Reverend Bishops of Covington, Ky., Columbus, OH., Richmond, Va., Vincennes, Ind., and Wilmington, Del.‚Äù were all listed on the master head of the newspaper as bishops who endorsed the newspaper. After only a short year Daniel moved the company to Cincinnati, where he started featuring articles that spoke out on black issues such as segregation and discrimination. Rudd‚Äôs mission and philosophy came through: ‚ÄúThe Catholic Church alone can break the color line. Our people should help her to do it.‚Äù Diocese of Bardstown The Diocese of Bardstown was erected into an Episcopal See April 8, 1808 by the Holy See. This diocese was the first inland diocese in the United States. The primal see or proto-Diocese of the United States, the Diocese of Baltimore, was subdivided into the dioceses of Boston, New York, Philadelphia, and Bardstown (Baltimore becoming the Archdiocese of Baltimore). The See of the diocese of Bardstown was moved to Louisville in 1841, and St. Joseph's was replaced as Cathedral by St. Louis Church (now the Cathedral of the Assumption) on Fifth Street in Downtown Louisville. St. Joseph's therefore became the \\"proto\\" or first cathedral. The Diocese of Louisville was elevated to Archdiocese in 1939. In 1995, the Holy See honored the proto-cathedral by naming retired Bishop Charles G. Maloney, the Titular Bishop of Bardstown. Maloney died on April 30, 2006.http://www.archlou.org/archlou/-1999988020/-1999903459/-1998754990.htm He was succeeded by Bishop Daniel E. Thomas on June 8, 2006.

Restriction sites within an MCS are typically unique, occurring only once within a given plasmid. The purpose of a MCS in a plasmid is to allow a piece of DNA to be inserted into that region. A MCS is found in a variety of vectors, including cloning vectors to increase the number of copies of target DNA, and in expression vectors to create a protein product. In expression vectors, the MCS is located downstream of the promoter.  Creating a multiple cloning site  In some instances, a vector may not contain a MCS. Rather, a MCS can be added to a vector. The first step is designing complementary oligonucleotide sequences that contain restriction enzyme sites along with additional bases on the end that are complementary to the vector after digesting. Then the oligonucleotide sequences can be annealed and ligated into the digested and purified vector. The digested vector is cut with a restriction enzyme that complements the oligonucleotide insert overhangs. After ligation, transform the vector into bacteria and verify the insert by sequencing. This method can also be used to add new restriction sites to a multiple cloning site.A diagram showing the process of inserting a multiple cloning site into a plasmid vector.  Uses  Multiple cloning sites are a feature that allows for the insertion of foreign DNA without disrupting the rest of the plasmid which makes it extremely useful in biotechnology, bioengineering, and molecular genetics. MCS can aid in making transgenic organisms, more commonly known as a genetically modified organism (GMO) using genetic engineering. To take advantage of the MCS in genetic engineering, a gene of interest has to be added to the vector during production when the MCS is cut open. After the MCS is made and ligated it will include the gene of interest and can be amplified to increase gene copy number in a bacterium-host. After the bacterium replicates, the gene of interest can be extracted out of the bacterium. In some instances, an expression vector can be used to create a protein product. After the products are isolated, they have a wide variety of uses such as the production of insulin, the creation of vaccines, production of antibiotics, and creation of gene therapies. Example One bacterial plasmid used in genetic engineering as a plasmid cloning vector is pUC18. Its polylinker region is composed of several restriction enzyme recognition sites, that have been engineered into a single cluster (the polylinker). It has restriction sites for various restriction enzymes, including EcoRI, BamHI, and PstI. Another vector used in genetic engineering is pUC19, which is similar to pUC18, but its polylinker region is reversed. E.coli is also commonly used as the bacterial host because of the availability, quick growth rate, and versatility. In order to genetically engineer insulin, the first step is to cut the MCS in the plasmid being used. Once the MCS is cut, the gene for human insulin can be added making the plasmid genetically modified. After that, the genetically modified plasmid is put into the bacterial host and allowed to divide. To make the large supply that is demanded, the host cells are put into a large fermentation tank that is an optimal environment for the host. The process is finished by filtering out the insulin from the host. Purification can then take place so the insulin can be packaged and distributed to individuals with diabetes.

Professional wrestling career Heiniemi started wrestling in 1965. He formed a tag team with his \\"brother\\" Gene Anderson and also tagged with his other \\"brother\\" Ole Anderson. Anderson was only the real last name for Gene Anderson . Ole and Lars had changed their names to pretend to be the real life brothers of Gene .Bourne, Dick. Anderson Brothers Timeline The Glory Days (Retrieved November 19, 2007) He occasionally wrestled with them as the Minnesota Wrecking Crew. Lars did not have the success that the other Andersons had. He did win numerous NWA regional championships, however, including winning the Georgia version of the NWA World Tag Team Championship with Gene Anderson. Lars wrestled briefly in the Carolinas as \\"Luscious\\" Lars Anderson. In the early 1970s, he wrestled in the San Francisco bay area (again as Luscious Lars Anderson), winning the NWA (San Francisco) World Tag Team title with partner Paul DeMarco in 1972. On the microphone, Larry was one of the best talkers in an era when getting over on the microphone was important. In the early '70s, after leaving Gene Anderson, he returned to the AWA and hooked up with Larry \\"Pretty Boy\\" Hennig. The latter needed a new partner after the departure of \\"Handsome\\" Harley Race who ventured to the NWA. In the mid 1970s, Heiniemi was joined by his college friend, Les \\"Budd\\" Wolfe. Together they formed a solid combination, and many felt they should have won the AWA World Tag Team titles. In March 1975, Heiniemi announced he was retiring from the ring, and after losing his last match to England's Billy Robinson, Larry left the AWA. However, he did not retire; he was back to using the Lars Anderson handle and briefly feuded with his \\"brothers\\" Gene and Ole in Atlanta in 1977. He spent the last years of his career wrestling in Hawaii for Polynesian Pacific Wrestling (PPW). When its owner, Peter Maivia, died in 1982, his wife hired Heiniemi as head booker. This lasted until 1988 when the dwindling promotion folded. Dwayne Johnson, former wrestler and grandson of Peter Maivia, spoke poorly of Heiniemi in his 2000 autobiography, The Rock Says.... Johnson described a scene where, as a teenager, he angrily confronted Heiniemi when he refused to drop the Polynesian Pacific Heavyweight title to Allen Coage, who was wrestling as Bad News Allen at the time. In 1996, Heiniemi established World League Wrestling. This little known promotion consisted largely of wrestlers from his training school and former PPW talent.

He was also the first major exponent of Swadeshi values in Indian art, thereby founding the influential Bengal school of art, which led to the development of modern Indian painting.Abanindranath Tagore, A Survey of the Master‚Äôs Life and Work by Mukul Dey, reprinted from \\"Abanindra Number,\\" The Visva-Bharati Quarterly, May ‚Äì Oct. 1942. He was also a noted writer, particularly for children. Popularly known as 'Aban Thakur', his books Rajkahini, Budo Angla, Nalak, and Khirer Putul were landmarks in Bengali language children's literature and art. Tagore sought to modernise Mughal and Rajput styles to counter the influence of Western models of art, as taught in art schools under the British Raj. Along with other artists from the Bengal school of art, Tagore advocated in favour of a nationalistic Indian art derived from Indian art history, drawing inspiration from the Ajanta Caves. Tagore's work was so successful that it was eventually accepted and promoted as a national Indian style within British art institutions. Personal life and background Abanindranath Tagore was born in Jorasanko, Calcutta, British India, to Gunendranath Tagore and Saudamini Tagore. His grandfather was Girindranath Tagore, the second son of \\"Prince\\" Dwarkanath Tagore. He was a member of the distinguished Tagore family, and a nephew of the poet Rabindranath Tagore. His grandfather and his elder brother, Gaganendranath Tagore, were also artists. Tagore learned art when studying at Sanskrit College, Kolkata in the 1880s. In 1890, around the age of twenty years, Abanindranath attended the Calcutta School of Art where he learnt to use pastels from O. Ghilardi, and oil painting from C. Palmer, European painters who taught in that institution. In 1889, he married Suhasini Devi, daughter of Bhujagendra Bhusan Chatterjee, a descendant of Prasanna Coomar Tagore. At this time he left the Sanskrit College after nine years of study and studied English as a special student at St. Xavier's College, which he attended for about a year and a half. He had a sister, Sunayani Devi. Painting career \\"Ganesh-janani\\" by Abanindranath Tagore Early life In the early 1890s several illustrations were published in Sadhana magazine, and in Chitrangada, and other works by Rabindranath Tagore. He also illustrated his own books. Around 1897 he took lessons from the vice-principal of the Government School of Art, studying in the traditional European academic manner, learning the full range of techniques, but with a particular interest in watercolour. At this time he began to come under the influence of Mughal art, producing a number of works based on the life of Krishna in a Mughal-influenced style. After meeting E. B. Havell, Tagore worked with him to revitalise and redefine art teaching at the Calcutta School of Art, a project also supported by his brother Gaganendranath, who set up the Indian Society of Oriental Art. Tagore believed in the traditional Indian techniques of painting. His philosophy rejected the \\"materialistic\\" art of the West and came back to Indian traditional art forms. He was influenced by the Mughal school of painting as well as Whistler's Aestheticism. In his later works, Tagore started integrating Chinese and Japanese calligraphic traditions into his style. Later career Tagore believed that Western art was \\"materialistic\\" in character, and that India needed to return to its own traditions to recover spiritual values. Despite its Indocentric nationalism, this view was already commonplace within British art of the time, stemming from the ideas of the Pre-Raphaelites. Tagore's work also shows the influence of Whistler's Aestheticism. Partly for this reason many British arts administrators were sympathetic to such ideas, especially as Hindu philosophy was becoming increasingly influential in the West following the spread of the Theosophy movement. Tagore believed that Indian traditions could be adapted to express these new values, and to promote a progressive Indian national culture. His finest achievement however was the Arabian Nights series which was painted in 1930. In these paintings he uses the Arabian Nights stories as a means of looking at colonial Calcutta and picturing its emergent cosmopolitanism. With the success of Tagore's ideas, he came into contact with other Asian cultural figures, such as the Japanese art historian Okakura Kakuz≈ç and the Japanese painter Yokoyama Taikan, whose work was comparable to his own. In his later work, he began to incorporate elements of Chinese and Japanese calligraphic traditions into his art, seeking to construct a model for a modern pan-Asian artistic tradition which would merge the common aspects of Eastern spiritual and artistic cultures.Video of a London University Lecture detailing Abanindranath's Importance to Global Modernism, London University School of Advanced Study, March 2012. Rabindranath Tagore, Uccelli migranti, Carabba, 1918 His close students included Nandalal Bose, Samarendranath Gupta, Kshitindranath Majumdar, Surendranath Ganguly, Asit Kumar Haldar, Sarada Ukil, Kalipada Ghoshal , Manishi Dey, Mukul Dey, K. Venkatappa and Ranada Ukil. For Abanindranath, the house he grew up in (5 Dwarakanath Tagore Lane) and its companion house (6 Dwarakanath Tagore Lane) connected two cultural worlds ‚Äì 'white town' (where the British colonizers lived) and 'black town' (where the natives lived). According to architectural historian Swati Chattopadhay, Abanindranath used the Bengali meaning of the word, Jorasanko ('double bridge') to develop this idea in the form of a mythical map of the city. The map was, indeed, not of Calcutta, but an imaginary city, Halisahar, and was the central guide in a children's story Putur Boi (Putu's Book). The nineteenth-century place names of Calcutta, however, appear on this map, thus suggesting that this imaginary city be read with the colonial city as a frame of reference. The map used the structure of a board game (golokdham) and showed a city divided along a main artery; on one side a lion-gate leads to the Lal-Dighi in the middle of which is the 'white island.'Swati Chattopadhyay, Representing Calcutta: Modernity, Nationalism, and the Colonial Uncanny. Routledge 2006. Abanindranath maintained throughout his life a long friendship with the London-based artist, author and eventual president of London's Royal College of Art, William Rothenstein. Arriving in the autumn of 1910, Rothenstein spent almost a year surveying India's cultural and religious sites, including the ancient Buddhist caves of Ajanta; the Jain carvings of Gwalior; and the Hindu panoply of Benares. He ended up in Calcutta, where he drew and painted with Abanindranath and his students, attempting to absorb elements of Bengal School style into his own practice.Rupert Richard Arrowsmith, \\"An Indian Renascence and the rise of global modernism: William Rothenstein in India, 1910‚Äì11\\", The Burlington Magazine, vol.152 no.1285 (April 2010), pp.228‚Äì235. However limited Rothenstein's experiments with the styles of early Modernist Indian painting were, the friendship between him and Abanindranath ushered in a crucial cultural event. This was Rabindranath Tagore's time living at Rothenstein's London home, which led to the publication of the English-language version of Gitanjali and the subsequent award to Rabindranath in 1913 of the Nobel Prize for Literature. The publication of Rabindranath Tagore's Gitanjali in English brought the Tagore family international renown, which helped to make Abanindranath's artistic projects better known in the West. Abanindranath became chancellor of Visva Bharati in 1942.Samsad Bangali Charitabhidhan (Biographical Dictionary), Chief Editor: Subodh Chandra Sengupta, Editor: Anjali Bose, 4th edition 1998, , Vol I, page 23, , Sishu Sahitya Samsad Pvt. Ltd., 32A Acharya Prafulla Chandra Road, Kolkata. Rediscovery Within a few years of the artist's death in 1951, his eldest son, Alokendranath, bequeathed almost the entire family collection of Abanindranath Tagore's paintings to the newly founded Rabindra Bharati Society Trust that took up residence on the site of their famous house on No. 5, Dwarakanath Tagore lane. In a situation where only a small number of the artist's paintings had been collected or given away in his lifetime, the Rabindra Bharati Society became the main repository of Abanindranath's works of all periods. Banished into trunks inside the dark offices of the society, these paintings have remained in permanent storage ever since. As a result, the full range and brilliance of Abanindranath's works has never be effectively projected into a public domain. They remained intimately known only to a tiny circle of art connoisseurs and scholars in Bengal, some of whom like K. G. Subramanyan and R. Siva Kumar have long argued that the true measure of Abanindranath's talent is to be found in his works of the 1920s, 30s and 40s but could do little to offer up a comprehensive profile of the master for the contemporary art world. R. Siva Kumar's Paintings of Abanindranath Tagore (2008) is a path-breaking book redefining Abanindranath's art.

The speaker is most commonly provided with their topic in the form of a quotation, but the topic may also be presented as an object, proverb, one-word abstract, or one of the many alternative Tommy invented Impromptu While specific rules and norms vary with the organization and level of competition, the speeches tend to follow basic speech format and cover topics that are both humorous and profound.  Collegiate impromptu speaking  Impromptu speaking is an individual event offered and regulated by both the National Forensics Association and the American Forensics Association, both of whom follow nearly identical formats in proctoring the event. Both organizations provide seven minutes of time to be allocated between speaking and preparation as the speaker sees fit, allow minimal notes (usually a 3\\"x5\\" index card) to be used, and provide undisclosed prompts to determine the speech's topic. While the competitor's success and ranking is ultimately determined by the judge's decision, there are several general criteria that many competitors and judges adhere to: * Experienced speakers are generally expected to avoid exceeding two minutes of preparation time, with some speakers preferring to use only one minute or less. * The speaker is to create an interpretation of the prompt and use it to establish an argument/thesis that the speech will support. * The speaker is heavily encouraged to use examples (e.g. historical events) in the \\"body\\" of their speech to support their argument. * Advanced speakers often use theories in conjunction with examples that illustrate them. * As with any competitive speech, the speaker is expected to offer a clear and defined structure in their speech. * Competitors are advised to avoid giving pre-prepared, or \\"canned\\" impromptu speeches. Neither the AFA nor NFA regulate specific speech formats to be used by competitors, however there are two formats that are predominantly used: Two point format: I. Introduction (Attention getter, interpretation of prompt, argument/thesis) II. First main point A. Supporting example B. Supporting example III. Second main point A. Supporting example B. Supporting example IV. Conclusion Three point format: I. Introduction II. First main point A. Supporting example III. Second main point A. Supporting example IV. Third main point A. Supporting example V. Conclusion  Editorial impromptu  In 2008, the National Forensics Association officially introduced a new form of impromptu for competition. In this event students are given a short editorial (ideally 3 to 5 paragraphs) to which they will develop a response. Students will be allowed nine minutes to divide between preparation and speech time. Speakers must speak for at least five minutes. Limited notes, prepared in the round, are permitted. Editorial Impromptu represents an attempt to return ‚Äúimpromptu‚Äù to impromptu speaking. The speech should involve the development of an argument in response to the thesis developed or opinion shared in a given editorial.  High school competitions  Typically in high school speech competitions, a competitor is given 30 seconds to select a topic from a set of topics (usually three). The competitor will then have 5 minutes to compose a speech of five minutes with a 30-second grace period. There is a general outline for impromptu speeches, it is as follows: # Introduction/roadmap (1 minute) # First section (1 minute) # Second section (1 minute) # Third section (1 minute) # Conclusion (1 minute) The introduction begins with an attention-getter, the statement of the topic and an outline of the speech. The conclusion is usually like the introduction except backwards, ending with a profound statement, although a lighthearted ending is also accepted. For the three body points, there are many kinds of formats that can be used. For example, if the topic is a quote, a competitor may go over how the quote is true, how the quote is false, and why he or she believes what he or she believes. Other examples are: past, present, future; local, national, international. More advanced speakers will use formats that look deeper into a subject such as: physical, moral, intellectual; books, video, digital (media.) However, many speakers choose not to follow a format at all. That being said, most beginners who fail to follow a solid format often find themselves lost in a jumble of ideas. Judging usually involves one judge in the preliminary round, one to three judges in the semi-finals/qualifying round, and a panel of three judges in the finals round. Judges look for overall coherency, impact, and confidence, and usually overlook basal errors due to the short preparation time.

His CBC Television series Don Messer‚Äôs Jubilee (1959‚Äì69) featured Messer's down-east fiddle style and the \\"old-time\\" music of Don Messer and His Islanders, and was one of the most popular and enduring Canadian television programs of the 1960s. Messer was known as a shy fiddler, who preferred to have the other members of the band take the spotlight. Life Born in Tweedside, New Brunswick, Don Messer was the youngest of 11 children to John and Margaret Agnes (Moffitt) Messer. He began playing the violin at age five, learning fiddle tunes with Irish and Scottish influences. By the age of seven he was playing fiddle for square dances. As a young boy, Messer would play concerts in the local area and later throughout southwestern New Brunswick. By the time he was a young man he had amassed a repertoire of hundreds of reels, jigs, breakdowns, and other pieces for fiddle. He was playing endless square dances, country dances, weddings, and other parties. At age 16 he moved to Boston, Massachusetts where he received his only formal instruction in music. He moved back to New Brunswick in March, 1929. He was married to Naomi Dorothy Gray on the 28th of July, 1934 in Lancaster Parish, Saint John, New Brunswick. He died of a heart attack in 1973 in Halifax, Nova Scotia. A monument was erected in his memory in Tweedside, New Brunswick. A fiddle also stands in Harvey, New Brunswick as a monument.  Career = Radio  Messer began his radio career on CFBO in Saint John, New Brunswick in 1929 when he joined the station staff. He had organized a small studio band of musicians by that point and in 1934, they began a regular radio show for the Canadian Radio Broadcasting Commission (forerunner to the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation or CBC), broadcasting from CHSJ in Saint John under the name the New Brunswick Lumberjacks. Messer also began to make personal appearances throughout the Maritimes and New England using a smaller group named the \\"Backwoods Breakdown.\\" Messer left Saint John in 1939 and moved to Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island where he joined CFCY as music director.  Don Messer and His Islanders  While in Charlottetown, Messer formed the \\"Islanders\\" and by 1944 the group was airing a show nationally on CBC radio. The show established itself as the most popular on Canadian radio during the 1940s-1960s and Don Messer and The Islanders began to tour outside of the Maritimes. It was formed around two of the original members, lumberjack- vocalist Charlie Chamberlain from Bathurst, N.B., and bass player Julius (Duke) Neilson from Woodstock, N.B. Other members were added throughout the years and Don Messer and the Islanders was later changed to Don Messer and His Islanders. The band remained together after the late 1930s. The musicians provided a backdrop for vocalists, guest performers and, after 1959, the Buchta Dancers. Charlie Chamberlain and Marg Osburne were the lead vocalists. Television In 1956, Messer's music group began to make regular television appearances on CBHT-TV in Halifax, Nova Scotia. CBC television began a summer series called The Don Messer Show on August 7, 1959, which continued into the fall as Don Messer's Jubilee, produced out of Halifax. Continuing as Don Messer's Jubilee throughout the 1960s, the show won a wide audience and reportedly became the second-most watched television show in Canada during the decade (next to Hockey Night in Canada). The show was notable because it had a regular guest performer time slot, giving rise to many important Canadian folk singers through their national exposure, including Stompin' Tom Connors and Catherine McKinnon, and fiddler Graham Townsend among many others including a young 10 year old fiddler named Jim Elliott. Don Messer's Jubilee was cancelled by CBC television in April 1969, raising a national protest among viewers and fans and even raising questions from the floor of the House of Commons. At the time the show was dropped, it still rated in the top 10 and the network was not specific about its reasons for dropping the show. The audience protest came particularly from the Maritimes and from thousands of Maritimers living in other parts of Canada, including former Prime Minister John Diefenbaker, who was a fan of the show. Messer and his band continued Don Messer's Jubilee in syndication on CHCH-TV in Hamilton, Ontario following the 1969 CBC cancellation until Messer's death four years later. Legacy Messer's television show became the subject of the National Film Board feature Don Messer: His Land and His Music in 1971 and CBC produced a commemorative video of the show in 1985. Messer died in Halifax and his library and papers are held by the Public Archives of Nova Scotia. One of his fiddles is now located at the Country Music Hall of Fame in Nashville, Tennessee, although he always claimed that his folk music was neither country, nor western - the Irish and Scottish-influenced fiddle tunes having pre-dated the country/western genre by several hundred years. Don Messer's estate, which is run by his daughter Dawn Attis, has attempted to protect his name and image and his music. The estate gave sole license to contemporary Canadian folk musician Frank Leahy, who also owns and performs with one of Messer's fiddles. He received the honorary violin in 1997. Leahy recorded a tribute on Don Messer for the CBC and created a full-length stage production on \\"Don Messer's Violin,\\" which was presented across Canada. In the production, the role of Messer vocalist Marg Osborne was played by Catherine MacKinnon and Leahy played the role of Messer. A fiddle purchased by Messer in 1930 for $150 sold at an auction on July 23, 2006 for $11,750 to a resident of St. Stephen, New Brunswick. The fiddle was a copy of an instrument made by luthier Antonio Stradivari from the late 1600s. Messer owned 14 fiddles in his lifetime. A plaque to recognize the former home of Don Messer was installed by the City of Charlottetown to commemorate his contribution and presence in the community. The home is located on Belmont St. in Charlottetown and was built in 1950. Messer bought the home in 1960 and lived there for several years.

It codes for an isozyme of pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK). Pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) is a part of a mitochondrial multienzyme complex that catalyzes the oxidative decarboxylation of pyruvate and is one of the major enzymes responsible for the regulation of homeostasis of carbohydrate fuels in mammals. The enzymatic activity is regulated by a phosphorylation/dephosphorylation cycle. Phosphorylation of PDH by a specific pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK) results in inactivation. Structure The mature protein encoded by the PDK4 gene contains 407 amino acids in its sequence. To form the active protein, two of the polypeptide chains come together to form an open conformation. The catalytic domain of PDK1 might exist separately in cells and important for the regulation of the PDK1 substrate. The crystal structural studies suggest that the PIF-pocket is located at the catalytic domain as well.  Function  The Pyruvate Dehydrogenase (PDH) complex must be tightly regulated due to its central role in general metabolism. Within the complex, there are three serine residues on the E1 component that are sites for phosphorylation; this phosphorylation inactivates the complex. In humans, there have been four isozymes of Pyruvate Dehydrogenase Kinase that have been shown to phosphorylate these three sites: PDK1, PDK2, PDK3, and PDK4. PDK1 is the only enzyme capable of phosphorylating the 3rd serine site. When the thiamine pyrophosphatase (TPP) coenzyme is bound, the rates of phosphorylation by all four isozymes are drastically affected; specifically, the incorporation of phosphate groups by PDK1 into sites 2 and 3 is significantly reduced. Regulation As the primary regulators of a crucial step in the central metabolic pathway, the pyruvate dehydrogenase family is tightly regulated itself by a myriad of factors. PDK activity has been shown to decrease in individuals consuming a diet that is high in n-3 fatty acids; however, PDH activity remained unaffected. Additionally, PDK1 is inihibited by AZD7545 and dichloroacetic acid (DCA); the mechanism was discovered to be the trifluoromethylpropanamide end of AZD7545 projecting into the lipoyl-binding pocket of PDK1. Dichloroacetic acid was found near the helix bundle in the N-terminal domain of PDK1. Bound DCA promotes local conformational changes that are communicated to both nucleotide-binding and lipoyl-binding pockets of PDK1, leading to the inactivation of kinase activity. Clinical Significance PDK1 is relevant in a variety of clinical conditions throughout the body. As PDK1 regulates the PDH complex, it has been proven to be an important regulator in certain cells, including the beta cells within the islets of the pancreas. In order to optimize glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS), a primary function of the pancreas, a low PDK1 activity must be maintained to keep PDH in a dephosphorylated and active state. Maintaining low PDK1 levels has also proven to be beneficial in certain regions of the brain, as it confers a high tolerance to amyloid beta, a metabolite that is directly correlated with the development of Alzheimer‚Äôs disease. Cancer The ubiquitous role of this gene lends itself to being involved in a variety of disease pathologies, including cancer. PDK1 mRNA expression is significantly associated with tumor progression; in fact, the presence of PDK1 can serve as a prognostic marker, indicating the level of success a patient can achieve. Specifically, this may serve as a biomarker in patients with gastric cancer. In coordination, the inhibitor dichloroacetic acid may be used in the future as a treatment option for patients with this type of cancer. PDK1, as it regulates hypoxia and lactate production, is associated with a poor outcome in patients with head and neck squamous cancer. The buildup of glycolytic metabolites may promote Hypoxia-Inducing Factor (HIF) activation, which creates a feed-forward loop for malignancy progression. As such, using HIF-1 as a metabolite to regulate PDK1 is seen as another potential therapy, either on its own or in tandem with other therapies, for this type of cancer. In a further developed study, combined PDK1 and CHK1 inhibition was shown to be required to kill glioblastoma stem-like cells in vitro and in vivo.

It is closely related to the Icelandic Sheepdog and the J√§mthund. The Buhund is used as an all purpose farm and herding dog, as well as watch dog and a nanny dog.  Description =Name origin The name Buhund is derived from the Norwegian word \\"bu\\", which means homestead, a simple building or mountain hut (where the shepherd lived while looking after his herd in the summer) but can also mean stock, as in livestock, and \\"hund\\" which means dog. The modern buhund was bred on the rainy western coastlands of Norway from similar dogs used by Vikings. General appearance The Norwegian Buhund has a square profile, is a little under medium-sized and sports a high set, tightly curled tail carried over the center of the back. The head is wedge shaped with pricked ears and a black nose. Their back is level with a deep chest. Measurements The Buhund ranges in size from about 43 to 45 centimeter (17 to 18 inches) with the males being 43-46 cm (17-18 in) and females to 44 cm(17 in) high. The weight range is 14-18 kg (31‚Äì40 pounds) for males and 12-16 kg (26‚Äì35 pounds) for females. Coat Wheaten - Any shade from pale cream to bright orange, with or without dark tipped hairs; as little white as possible; black mask acceptable. Black - Preferably without too much bronzing; with as little white as possible. Areas where white is permissible: a narrow white ring around the neck, a narrow blaze on the face, a small patch of white hairs on the chest, white feet and tip of the tail. Gray dogs with coats similar to the Norwegian Elkhound are sometimes found. In the UK Wolf Sable is also listed in the Kennel Club Breed Standard. Temperament The Norwegian Buhund is a highly cheerful and active breed. They do not tire easily and require extensive exercise on a daily basis. The Norwegian Buhund needs to expel its energy and becomes destructive and ill-mannered if ignored or made to stay still frequently. In conjunction with their high level of activity and energy, they are also extremely lovable and are known for their love of children. However, due to their high level of energy and need for intensive training, Norwegian Buhunds should always be supervised, especially around children and the elderly. This breed loves to cuddle and give kisses to their masters and families. They form strong bonds with their owners and therefore are natural watch dogs. This can result in aloof behavior and wariness or anxiety around strangers. New owners may find this problematic, since the Norwegian Buhund may bark at each new alarming noise or movement. They are communicative and brave, but rarely will snap or bite without provocation. The Norwegian Buhund is highly intelligent. They are extremely headstrong and demonstrate an intense desire to be taught and to learn new things. If appropriate stimulus is not made available, the breed may resort to destructive or inappropriate behavior. The Buhund breed does become bored easily and is known to become restless. Daily exercise is required. This breed is ideal for owners who can dedicate time to exercise and training. With this desire for activity and learning combined with a high level of energy, the Norwegian Buhund makes an excellent agility dog. People who live active lifestyles, or are seeking a dog with which they can become involved in dog sports, will appreciate the personality of the Norwegian Buhund. It is also an ideal dog for people who are athletic and desire a dog to go running, hiking or biking with. This breed makes an excellent companion for a sports enthusiast. Health The Norwegian Buhund is prone to inherited eye issues and hip dysplasia. Grooming The Norwegian Buhund breed has a short to medium length coat that does not tangle or mat when shedding. Brushing weekly will be fine, but extra brushing is required when the dog is blowing coat twice a year. Two black Buhund. History The Norwegian Buhund belongs to a large class of dogs called the Spitz type. There are many variations in size, coat and color among the Spitz breeds. These dogs protected farms and herded cattle and sheep.

Biography Robert Applegarth was born in Hull in England. His father was the captain of a whaling brig. He spent a brief period in a dame school but had no other formal education and began work in a shoemaker's shop aged ten. He learned the skills of carpentry, before moving to Sheffield where he met and married Mary Longmore, a farmer's daughter. Applegarth moved to New York City in December 1854, seeking well paid employment, with only a half crown in his possession. He lived with another immigrant from Sheffield for a time, and held a variety of jobs including master at a railroad station. He admired the democracy of the United States, but was appalled by slavery, and visited Mississippi to witness it for himself, where he met Frederick Douglass. By 1857, Applegarth was confident that he could support his wife in America so sent for her from Sheffield, but she was too ill to travel and so he returned to Sheffield. During the American Civil War, Applegarth strongly supported the Union. Once back in the United Kingdom he joined the Sheffield Carpenters Union, and rose to become their secretary. In 1861 the Sheffield Carpenters Union merged with the Amalgamated Society of Carpenters and Joiners (ASCJ), and in 1862 was elected as general secretary of the union.Raymond Postgate, \\"Robert Applegarth\\" in Great Democrats, edited by Alfred Barratt Brown. Nicholson and Watson, 1934 (p. 24) The ASCJ was a New Model Union, and Applegarth regularly met with other leading New Model Unionists in London, in what Sidney and Beatrice Webb termed a junta. Applegarth also became an executive member of the London Trades Council (LTC), and advocated a moderate approach to trade unionism with an emphasis on negotiations rather than strike action, telling his fellow trade unionists to \\"Never surrender the right to strike, but be careful how you use a double-edged weapon\\". This stance led to conflict with George Potter, the founder of the LTC's journal The Bee-Hive, who argued that the journal should give its support unreservedly to all strike action undertaken by trade unions throughout the country. Applegarth accused him of being a \\"manufacturer of strikes\\" and of personal dishonesty and maladministration following an investigation into the Bee-Hive in 1865. As a result, Potter was forced to leave the LTC. Under Applegarth's leadership, the ASCJ's membership increased from 1000 in 1862 to over 10,000 in 1870,Briggs, Asa: \\"Victorian People\\", pg. 185, Pelican 1955 and accumulated funds of over ¬£17,000. During the Royal Commission on Trade Unions (1867), Applegarth vigorously advocated the benefits of New Model Unionism to the committee, answering a total of 633 questions, and was generally regarded as the most impressive pro-trade union witness. Applegarth campaigned for the pro-trade unionist minority report of the commission to be accepted by Gladstone's Liberal government, leading to the Trade Union Act of 1871. In May of the same year he was offered a position on the Royal Commission on Contagious Diseases, which he took despite the protests of the ASCJ, leading him to resign from his position as general secretary. At around this time he joined the Working Men's Committee for Promoting the Separation of Church and State along with Potter and George Howell. After his work for the Royal Commission, Applegarth became a commercial traveller for a French firm selling Henry Fleuss's underwater breathing apparatus. He took out the English patent for the Yablochkov candle and made a fairly successful business out of it based in Epsom. When his old friend Howell lost his seat in Parliament in 1895 and fell ill, Applegarth and the TUC raised a ¬£1650 testimonial to buy him an annuity. In 1898 he became a poultry farmer in Bexley, where he introduced a new breed of French hen. Applegarth spent his retirement in Brighton, where he was offered the title of Companion of Honour by Lloyd George in 1917. He turned the offer down, saying he preferred to remain \\"plain Robert Applegarth\\". When he died in 1924 he was cremated at West Norwood Cemetery and given a secular ceremony, according to his instructions.

Life and career He was born in Munich, Bavaria, and studied Mechanical Engineering at the Technical University of Munich from 1968 to 1972. He earned the degree of \\"Diplom-Ingenieur\\", and began his career at BMW in 1973 as a Production Planning Engineer. He was promoted to become chairman of the board of BMW from 1993 through 1999. He was also chairman of the Board of Management of Volkswagen AG, the parent company of the Volkswagen Group, from 2002 to 2006, and chairman of Scania AB until 2007. During his time as head of BMW, Pischetsrieder was known for solidifying the company's position as a leader in the luxury car market with a solid sporting and engineering reputation. His decision in 1994 to purchase Rover Group from British Aerospace was widely regarded as a failure on paper. Although many of the assets were sold at vast profit and the purchase brought the valuable Mini and Land Rover marques into BMW ownership, the Rover passenger car operation drained the company's coffers. Rover was sold off in 2000, with Ford taking on Land Rover, and the Mini brand remaining at BMW. A more lasting achievement was the assumption of the Rolls-Royce marque, a deal which left rival Volkswagen Group manager, Ferdinand Pi√´ch, with only the Bentley marque, and the Crewe factory. However, this operation has turned out to be much more successful than the Rolls Royce operation, and it is a matter of debate whether BMW would have been better off keeping Bentley rather than having to take a licence for the Rolls Royce name Late in 2000 Pischetsrieder joined Volkswagen Group, mandated initially to take responsibility for quality, as \\"the voice of the customer\\" across the group, along with specific responsibility for giving the group's SEAT operation a new focus. In fact on 1 July 2000 he was appointed chief executive officer at SEAT and stayed to this position up to 6 March 2002. On 16 April 2002, Pischetsrieder succeeded Pi√´ch as chairman of Volkswagen AG. At Volkswagen, he directed Bugatti Automobiles SAS to reengineer the Bugatti Veyron 16.4, delaying an expected launch. He continued moving the Audi and Volkswagen marques upmarket to some controversy. He is known to be an enthusiastic driver, and once wrote off a silver McLaren F1 exotic sports car. There were only 64 street legal versions of the McLaren manufactured. In a surprise announcement on 7 November 2006, it was revealed that Pischetsrieder would be stepping down from the top job at Volkswagen AG on 31 December that year. He was to be replaced by Martin Winterkorn, who was head of the Audi division. During Pischetsrieder's time at the helm, the Volkswagen share price rose by 80%, and his dismissal was opposed by (among others) supervisory board member Christian Wulff, who held his position on the board as a result of his position as Minister-President of Lower Saxony: Lower Saxony is a major Volkswagen share holder. Pischetsrieder's dismissal appeared to result from differences with Ferdinand Pi√´ch. Since 2013 he is chairman of the reinsurance company Munich Re. In April 2014, he was elected as one of the three new members of the supervisory board at Daimler AG, which role he will be performing until 2019.http://www.autoblog.com/2014/04/14/daimler-names- bernd-pischetsrieder-to-supervisory-board/ Family connection Sir Alec Issigonis, the British car designer and engineer who created the Morris Minor and the Mini, was a first cousin once removed of Pischetsrieder which was regarded as the reason why BMW purchased the Rover Group so Pischetsrieder could get his hands on the Mini brand.

It is named for Zachary Taylor, the 12th president of the United States, who is buried there with his wife, Margaret Mackall Smith Taylor. Zachary Taylor National Cemetery was listed in the National Register of Historic Places on November 3, 1983. As of 2014, the cemetery has over 14,000 interments and is one of seven national cemeteries in the Commonwealth of Kentucky, and one of 112 in the United States. Those buried at the national cemetery served in six wars: Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War, World War I, World War II, Korean War, Vietnam War, and the Persian Gulf War. The cemetery began as the Taylor family cemetery and holds the graves of the president's parents, Richard Taylor, a colonel in the American Revolutionary War, and Sarah Strother Taylor; W.G.L. Taylor, a captain for the Confederate States of America and other family members. President Taylor's son, Richard Taylor, a general for the Confederate States of America, is buried at Metairie Cemetery in New Orleans. History The land which became Zachary Taylor National Cemetery was part of Richard Taylor's estate, known as Springfield, given to him in gratitude for his service in the American Revolutionary War. The house in which the family lived for most of their time in Louisville is still nearby, and is called the Zachary Taylor House. On November 1, 1850, Zachary Taylor was buried in his family's burial ground. His remains were moved there from the Congressional Cemetery in Washington, D.C. where he was interred temporarily from July 13 to October 25, 1850.Kleber pg.869. In 1883, the commonwealth of Kentucky placed a fifty-foot monument, topped by a life-sized statue of Zachary Taylor, near his grave. In 1930, a sundial was added. The Taylor family in the 1920s initiated the effort to turn the Taylor burial grounds into a national cemetery. The commonwealth of Kentucky donated two adjacent parcels of land for the project, turning the half-acre Taylor family cemetery into . However, the Army judge advocate general ruled against acquiring the Taylor cemetery. When the national cemetery was created, the federal government constructed a new mausoleum for Zachary Taylor, made of limestone with a granite base and a marble interior. The mausoleum and adjacent Taylor family graves lie within the boundaries of the national cemetery, but are not owned by the United States government. However, the National Cemetery Administration maintains the Taylor graves as it does the rest of the national cemetery. There have been several attempts to increase the size of the cemetery, but each time local residents stopped the growth. The National Cemetery made the national news on June 17, 1991, when Zachary Taylor's remains were exhumed to determine if the real cause of death was arsenic poisoning and not an intestinal ailment as previously thought. Today Zachary Taylor's mausoleum The cemetery is currently closed to new interments. However, space may be available in the same grave site for eligible family members. It is administered by the National Cemetery Administration, a division of the Department of Veterans Affairs. The cemetery is the burial site of two Medal of Honor recipients, Sergeant Willie Sandlin (World War I), United States Army, and Sergeant John C. Squires (World War II), United States Army. Also, United States Air Force Lieutenant General Roscoe Charles Wilson is buried there. The Taylor family section is at the rear of the national cemetery. The vault in which Zachary Taylor was first buried still stands near the 1926 mausoleum. Soldiers from Fort Knox engage in a wreath-laying ceremony every November 24, the anniversary of Zachary Taylor's birth. The cemetery also contains the war graves of three British Army soldiers who died on the same day (18 March 1944) in the World War II.

The garrison at Naas numbered approximately 250 men, supplemented by a number of local yeomen, some of whom had already deserted to the rebels. Importantly, the defenders had some cannon. Attack The rebel attack was launched from three directions at around 2:30 a.m and achieved a degree of surprise, driving the garrison back to a barricade outside the gaol, on a slight hill at the centre of the town's main street. Rebel assaults on the barricade were eventually beaten back when the military managed to bring two artillery pieces to bear, firing at close range into the mass of rebels advancing on the then gaol from the north. Hemmed in by buildings, the rebels could not manoeuver, and cavalry were sent in to take advantage of the confusion. The rebels then began to retreat and the bulk of their casualties, about 135, were inflicted at this stage for the loss of about 25 of the military.

Career Born in Quinton,Stephanie Wood a suburb of Birmingham, Chris Wood had an interest in music and painting from early childhood. Self-taught on flute and saxophone, which he began playing at the age of 15, he began to play locally with other Birmingham musicians who would later find international fame in music: Christine Perfect (later Christine McVie), Carl Palmer, Stan Webb, and Mike Kellie. Wood played with Perfect in 1964 in the band Shades of Blue and with Kellie during 1965‚Äì1966 in the band Locomotive.Biography of Locomotive; www.brumbeat.net. He attended the Stourbridge College of Art, then the Birmingham School of Art (Painting Dept.) and subsequently was awarded a grant to attend the Royal Academy of Art starting in December 1965. Aged 18, Wood joined the Steve Hadley Quartet, a jazz/blues group in 1962. His younger sister Stephanie designed clothes for the Spencer Davis Group, based in Birmingham, and it was through her that Wood was first introduced to fellow Birmingham native Steve Winwood.Ellie Iglio and Stephanie Wood, Chris Wood Biography ; www.winwoodfans.com. A well-known Birmingham club, the Elbow Room, was an after-hours haunt of local bands and musicians and it was here that Wood used to meet up with Winwood and Jim Capaldi. At the age of 18, Winwood abandoned the Spencer Davis Group at the height of their popularity and, along with Wood, Capaldi, and Dave Mason, formed Traffic.Dan Ropek, author of Chris Wood biography To focus his fledgling band, Island Records' founder Chris Blackwell arranged for the four to retreat to an isolated farmhouse on the Berkshire Downs near Aston Tirrold. Initially without electricity, telephone or running water, The Cottage (as it became universally known) was so remote that a generator had to be installed to power the group's equipment. A concrete outdoor stage was built with the band's stage equipment set up to overlook the surrounding fields. After six months honing their music, Traffic released their first single, \\"Paper Sun\\". In Traffic, Wood primarily played flute and saxophone, occasionally contributing keyboards, bass and vocals. Wood also co-wrote several of Traffic's songs, particularly during the earlier period of the band's recording career. His most notable contribution is as the co-writer (with Winwood and Capaldi), of \\"Dear Mr. Fantasy\\".Wood's contributions to certain songs may have initially been overlooked. For example, some songwriting credits on Traffic changed between the original LP issue and the more recent CD reissues. The credits for \\"Vagabond Virgin\\" changed from Mason/Capaldi to Mason/Wood, and the credits for \\"Who Knows What Tomorrow May Bring?\\" changed from Winwood/Capaldi to Winwood/Capaldi/Wood. See Stephen Smith (ed.), The Smiling Phases Compendium: Traffic; www.winwoodfans.com. BMI lists \\"Who Knows What Tomorrow May Bring?\\" as by Winwood/Capaldi/Wood, while Allmusic (page retrieved 09-06-21) still lists \\"Vagabond Virgin\\" as being co-written by Capaldi and Mason. Matthew Greenwald, [ Review of \\"Vagabond Virgin\\"]; www.allmusic.co. Wood introduced the 17th century traditional song \\"John Barleycorn\\" to the band after hearing it on The Watersons album Frost and Fire. It became the title song of their 1970 album, \\"John Barleycorn Must Die.\\"Dan Ropek Wood played with Jimi Hendrix in 1968, appearing on Electric Ladyland. When Winwood temporarily formed supergroup Blind Faith in 1969, Wood, Mason and Capaldi joined Mick Weaver otherwise known as Wynder K Frog, to become Mason, Capaldi, Wood and Frog. Mick Weaver History, The Musician's Olympus. He then went on to tour the United States with Dr. John, where he met singer Jeanette Jacobs (formerly of the 1960s girl group The Cake). Wood and Jacobs married in November 1972, at Kensington Registry Office, when he was 28 and she was 22. In 1969, Wood also appeared on the eponymous second album of Free and the Small Faces' The Autumn Stone. In 1970, Wood and his wife, along with Steve Winwood, joined Ginger Baker's Air Force, releasing one album before reforming Traffic. Wood remained with Traffic from the time of its 1970 reformation until its 1974 breakup. He played on John Martyn's Inside Out (1973). Throughout Traffic's life, Chris was also in demand as a session musician with his immediately identifiable flute or saxophone playing cropping up on albums by Rebop Kwaku Baah, Tyrone Downie, Fat Mattress, Gordon Jackson, Crawler, The Sky, Bobby Whitlock and others. Through much of his life, Wood suffered from addiction to drugs and alcohol, which were initially attributed to a fear of flying. His wife was unfaithful while he was on tour, leading to an increased drinking, culminating in liver disease. He cut down on drinking, but his medication caused further complications. His wife Jeanette, from whom he had separated, died in 1982, at the age of 31, from the effects of a seizure. Wood was profoundly affected by her death. Death and legacy The death of two close friends, Free's Paul Kossoff and former bandmate Rebop Kwaku Baah followed by that of his (by then, estranged) wife laid very heavy on Wood. In 1983, Wood died of pneumonia at Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham, England. At the time, he was working on a solo album that was to be titled Vulcan, and had recorded material for the album over the previous few years, mostly in London at Island's Hammersmith Studio, The Fall Out Shelter, with engineer Terry Barham, as well as at Pathway Studios in London. Following Wood's death, the Vulcan recordings remained in the possession of Wood's sister, Stephanie. In 2008, with the consent of Stephanie Wood a CD titled Vulcan, consisting of selected material Wood recorded while working on the incomplete album (plus an unreleased Traffic live performance of one of Wood's compositions), was released by Esoteric Recordings.Esoteric Recordings News Release , October, 2008; www.cherryred.co.uk. Traffic recorded one additional studio album, Far from Home (1994), after Wood's death.

Harcourt Brace) The World's Last Night and Other Essays is a collection of essays by C. S. Lewis published in the United States in 1960. The title essay is about the Second Coming of Jesus Christ. The volume also contains a follow-up to Lewis' 1942 novel The Screwtape Letters in the form of \\"Screwtape Proposes a Toast.\\" The second, fourth and fifth pieces were published in the U.K. in a volume called Screwtape Proposes a Toast and other pieces (1965); the first, sixth and seventh were published in the U.K. in Fern-seed and Elephants and other essays on Christianity (1975). All the pieces were later collected in the comprehensive Essay Collection and Other Short Pieces (2000). Contents=\\"The Efficacy of Prayer\\"\\"On Obstinacy in Belief\\"\\"Lilies That Fester\\"\\"Screwtape Proposes a Toast\\"\\"Good Work and Good Works\\"\\"Religion and Rocketry\\" / \\"Will We Lose God in Outer Space\\" What did Lewis think of the possibility of discovering life on other planets? What implications might such a discovery have for Christian theology? Originally published in the Christian Herald and entitled ‚ÄúWill We Lose God in Outer Space,‚Äù Lewis's essay on the subject was first published in 1958 and later became titled ‚ÄúReligion and Rocketry.‚Äù The essay was written in partial response to the writings of Professor Fred B. Hoyle, the Cambridge astronomer and founder of the Institute of Astronomy at Cambridge. In 1958, Hoyle was Plumian professor of astronomy at Cambridge and engaged in the study of the structure and evolution of the stars. Even though he coined the phrase ‚ÄúBig Bang,‚Äù Hoyle rejected the ‚Äòbig bang‚Äô theory of the origin of the universe in favor of the steady state theory, which claimed that the universe has always looked as it does now. Martin Ryle, however, held to the big bang theory for the creation of the universe in a moment, the theory that eventually held sway. Some of Hoyle's writings, including science fiction and plays, popularized astronomy. Christopher H. Derrick of Geoffrey Bles publishers, presumably in 1963 and before Lewis's death, wrote a proposal for a book that was to include ‚ÄúReligion and Rocketry,‚Äù stating that ‚ÄúThis essay seems to have been written in rebuttal of an argument which is only likely to be brought forward by a rather silly minority (though an academically distinguished one)‚Ä¶‚Äù Hoyle would have been part of that academically distinguished, but silly, minority. Lewis also mentioned Professor Hoyle (1915‚Äì2001) in his essay ‚ÄúThe Seeing Eye‚Äù (1963). In ‚ÄúThe Seeing Eye,‚Äù Lewis challenged the conclusion of the Russian cosmonauts, who concluded that there was no God, since they did not find Him in outer space. In that same essay, Lewis claimed that Hoyle and many others were saying that life must have originated in many, many times and places, given the vast size of the universe. He was referring to a series of broadcast talks that Hoyle had given in 1950, later published as The Nature of the Universe, a series of talks that argued against a Christian view of origins and the uniqueness of the Christian faith. Later, in 1977, Hoyle championed the ancient theory of panspermia, supported these days by Richard Dawkins, that life on earth originated with the importation of living cells from space. The philosopher C.E.M. Joad agreed with Lewis and concluded that the size of the universe and the span of time in which it formed did not have ‚Äúany necessary bearing upon our views as to the nature of the universe as a whole, more particularly as regards its origin, purpose, destiny and end.‚Äù The enlargement of the scale of the universe did not reduce the importance of mankind. Disagreeing with Hoyle, Lewis thought it unlikely that life existed anywhere else in our solar system, but that it was at least possible elsewhere in the galaxy. He argued that ‚Äúthose who do not find Him on earth are unlikely to find Him in space.‚Äù People with dogmatic preconceptions, and scientists are not immune to such positions, will find themselves looking for evidence to support their preconceived opinions. Science is not equipped to do theology and evaluate the arguments for the existence of God, and, furthermore, the discovery of life in other parts of the universe would have no effect upon Christianity. The essay itself starts with Lewis proclaiming two equal and opposite scientific proposals: one, that life only began on earth with the rarest of accidents, and another, proposed by Hoyle, that life probably began in many places. Both positions, Lewis wrote, claim to show the absurdity of the Christian belief in divine origins and the Incarnation of Christ. There is nothing odd about arguments from two very different positions both being able to attack Christianity. Since the world is full of many mutually inconsistent theories, the combination of disagreements between them is multidimensional. The cogency of Hoyle's argument, wrote Lewis, was dependent upon five other questions, which must be answered before we can give any credence to Hoyle. * 1. Are there animals anywhere else besides earth? * 2. If yes, do any of these animals have what we call ‚Äòrational souls‚Äô? That is, are they spiritual beings? * 3. If there are such spiritual beings, are any or all of them, like us, fallen? * 4. If any of them have fallen, have they been denied Redemption by the Incarnation and Passion of Christ? Christ could have come to those worlds also. * 5. Finally, if all of the first four questions could be answered yes, is it certain that this is the only possible mode of Redemption? In Paul's letter to the Romans (8:19‚Äì23), Lewis argued, God hints that the longing for redemption is cosmic, and therefore not limited to this world. Perhaps redemption has happened for all those who need it, has happened through Christ's redemption, and has somehow been extended to other creatures. But we really don't know. And to speculate about other creatures in other worlds takes us into the imaginative narrative that comprises Lewis's Ransom Trilogy, especially Out of the Silent Planet and Perelandra. One paragraph of the essay in particular, beginning with the words ‚ÄúIt is interesting to wonder‚Ä¶,‚Äù imagines the scenario that Lewis spells out in Out of the Silent Planet. We find Lewis speculating that the vast distances in the universe are ‚ÄúGod‚Äôs quarantine precautions,‚Äù designed to prevent the rest of the universe from being contaminated by the corruption of our world. The rest of the essay continues that speculation, and I will leave it to the reader of this article to pursue the original article by Lewis and enjoy his speculation for itself. \\"The World's Last Night\\" / \\"Christian Hope - Its Meaning for Today\\" The last essay was written by Lewis about the Second Coming, using for its title (and part of the original essay) a phrase from the first line and title of a poem by seventh-century poet John Donne (1572-1631). That poem, \\"Holy Sonnet XIII: What If This Present Were The World's Last Night?\\" raises the question of how we should live if the world were ending today. Originally entitled \\"Christian Hope--Its Meaning for Today,\\" this essay was first printed in the periodical Religion in Life (Winter 1952-53). Its purpose is stated in the first paragraph of the essay: \\"I shall endeavor to deal with some of the thoughts that may deter modern men from a firm belief in, or a due attention to, the return or Second Coming of the Saviour.\\" Dr. Albert Schweitzer had overemphasized this doctrine, but we should not compensate by underemphasizing it. The essay especially focuses on the nature of Christ, who was the God-Man, and it challenges the modern thought that history always produces progress. He concludes by suggesting that we live our lives, our vocations, with the understanding that there is a judgment coming. External links * Survey of C.S.

She is the founder of the Arsion all-women professional wrestling promotion and has won several championships in both singles and tag team divisions throughout her career, primarily while with All Japan Women's Pro-Wrestling. Professional wrestling career=All Japan Women's Pro-Wrestling Shishido was trained by All Japan Women's Pro-Wrestling (AJW) and graduated as part of their class of 1986. She made her debut that summer against Noriyo Toyoda. She immediately joined Dump Matsumoto's heel stable Gokuaku Domei (\\"Atrocious Alliance\\"), along with classmate and tag team partner Nobuko Kimura. After the stable dissolved in 1988 due to Matsumoto's retirement, Shishido and Kimura went their separate ways, but re-formed in 1990 as Jungle Jack. Now called Aja Kong and Bison Kimura, they entered a two-year feud against their former allies Bull Nakano and her heel stable Gokumon-to. During their partnership they won the WWWA World Tag Team Championship twice. They lost a hair versus hair match on January 11, 1991, resulting in both women being shaved bald. Kong herself also pursued Nakano for the WWWA World Single Championship during the early 1990s. She failed in several attempts before finally achieving her goal on November 15, 1992, ending Nakano's three-year reign. World Wrestling Federation In 1995, Kong made an appearance in the American World Wrestling Federation (WWF) as the sole survivor of a women's elimination match at the pay-per-view Survivor Series by pinning all 4 members of her opposing team, including WWF Women's Champion, Alundra Blayze. Kong also appeared on two episodes of Monday Night Raw and was victorious in both bouts. During one bout, she broke the nose of Chaparita Asari. Kong was being built up as a challenger for the WWF Women's Championship held by Alundra Blayze. Kong was scheduled to face Blayze at the Royal Rumble pay-per-view in January 1996, but the company elected to end its women's division after Alundra Blayze showed up on WCW Monday Nitro with the WWF Women's championship and threw the title into a garbage can. Arsion In 1997, Kong left AJW and started the independent promotion Hyper Visual Fighting Arsion (usually referred to as simply Arsion). She led the organization until February 12, 2001, when she walked out of a tag team match and announced she was quitting. Freelance in Japan On April 30, 2004 at the joshi promotion Gaea Japan's event Limit Break, Kong wrestled Amazing Kong in the latter's Japanese debut. Later in the night, the duo formed a tag team called W Kong. The duo defeated Chigusa Nagayo and Lioness Asuka for the AAAW Tag Team Championship on May 5. The team defended the championship all summer, eventually losing to Manami Toyota and Carlos Amano on September 20. They also held tag team championships in Japanese women's promotions AJW and Ladies Legend Pro-Wrestling. On June 6, 2006, wrestling as Erika and Margaret, the team defeated Wataru Sakata and Ryoji Sai for the Hustle Super Tag Team Championship. They lost the titles on October 9, 2006 to American tag team Bubba Ray and Devon in a three-way match which also included the team of Sodom and Gamora. On August 26, 2015, Kong reformed the W Kong tag team with Amazing Kong. Kong also wrestled for Mayumi Ozaki's promotion, Oz Academy where she is affiliated with the Jungle Jack 21 stable. She has also held the promotion's championship. Freelance in the United States (2011-2012,2017-2019) In December 2011, Kong took part in American promotion Chikara's JoshiMania weekend, losing to Sara Del Rey in the main event of night one on December 2. The following day, Kong defeated Ayako Hamada in the main event. On the third and final night of the tour, Kong teamed with Mio Shirai and Tsubasa Kuragaki to defeat Hanako Nakamori, Manami Toyota and Sawako Shimono in a six-woman tag team match. Kong returned to the United States on April 11, 2015, working for Shimmer Women Athletes. Kong was brought in as a surprise to take part in Tomoka Nakagawa's retirement event. On November 11, 2017, Kong returned to Shimmer Women Athletes joining the Trifecta heel stable with Mercedes Martinez and Nicole Savoy to replace the recently departed (for WWE) Shayna Baszler and appeared in matches the following night as well.  All Elite Wrestling (2019)  On May 25, 2019, Kong made her All Elite Wrestling (AEW) debut, as she teamed with Emi Sakura and Yuka Sakazaki where they unsuccessfully challenged the team of Hikaru Shida, Riho, and Ryo Mizunami.

The school's mission is to protect populations from illness and injury by pioneering new research, deploying its knowledge and expertise in the field, and training scientists and practitioners in the global defense of human life. The school is ranked first in public health in the U.S. News and World Report rankings and has held that ranking since 1994. History=Overview Originally named the Johns Hopkins School of Hygiene and Public Health, the school was founded in 1916 by William H. Welch with a grant from the Rockefeller Foundation. The school was renamed the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health on April 20, 2001, in honor of Michael Bloomberg (founder of the eponymous media company) for his financial support and commitment to the school and Johns Hopkins University. Bloomberg has donated a total of $2.9 billion to Johns Hopkins University over a period of several decades. The school is also the founder of Delta Omega (est. 1924), the national honorary society for graduate training in public health. The Bloomberg School is fully accredited by the Council on Education for Public Health (CEPH). Origins In 1913, the Rockefeller Foundation sponsored a conference on the need for public health education in the United States. Foundation officials were convinced that a new profession of public health was needed. It would be allied to medicine but also distinct, with its own identity and educational institutions. The result of deliberations between public health leaders and foundation officials was the Welch‚ÄìRose Report of 1915, which laid out the need for adequately trained public health workers, and envisioned an \\"institute of hygiene\\" for the United States. The Report, reflected the different preferences of the plan's two architects‚ÄîWilliam Henry Welch favored scientific research, whereas Wickliffe Rose wanted an emphasis on public health practice. In June 1916, the executive committee of the Rockefeller Foundation approved the plan to organize an institute or school of public health at the Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland, United States. The institute was named the School of Hygiene and Public Health, indicating a compromise between those who wanted the practical public health training on the British model and those who favoured basic scientific research on the German model. Welch, the first Dean of the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine also became the founding Dean of the first school of public health in the United States. The facility is located on the former Maryland Hospital site founded in 1797. The Maryland Hospital was originally built as a hospital to care for Yellow Fever for the indigent away from the city. In 1840, the hospital expanded to exclusively care for the mentally ill. In 1873, the buildings were torn down as the facility relocated to a new site as the Spring Grove Hospital Center. Legacy The Johns Hopkins School of Public Health represents the archetype for formalized public health training and epidemiology education in the United States. By 1922, other schools of public health at Harvard, Columbia and Yale had all been established in accordance with the Hopkins model. The Rockefeller Foundation continued to sponsor the creation of public health schools in the United States and around the world in the 1920s and 1930s, extending the American model of the Johns Hopkins School of Public Health to countries such as Brazil, Bulgaria, Canada, Czechoslovakia, England, Hungary, India, Italy, Japan, Norway, the Philippines, Poland, Rumania, Sweden, Turkey, and Yugoslavia.  Centennial Celebration  The school celebrated its 100th anniversary during the 2015‚Äì2016 academic year with programs, festivities, and innovative projects to spotlight 100 years of pioneering public health‚Äîconnecting a century of achievements to the promise of new advances for the next century. Reputation and ranking The Bloomberg School is the largest school of public health in the world, with 530 full-time and 620 part-time faculty, and 2,030 students from 84 countries. It is home to over fifty Research Centers and Institutes with research ongoing in the U.S. and more than 90 countries worldwide. The School ranks first in federal research support from the National Institutes of Health (NIH), receiving nearly 25 percent of all funds distributed among the 40 U.S. schools of public health, and has consistently been ranked first among schools of public health by U.S. News & World Report. Academic degrees and departments The School offers: *9 master's degrees: Master of Public Health, Master of Science in Public Health, Master of Health Science, Master of Health Administration, Master of Bioethics, Master of Arts, Master of Applied Science, Master of Public Policy and Master of Science *3 doctoral degrees: Ph.D, Doctor of Public Health, and Doctor of Science (ScD), *Postdoctoral training and residency programs in general preventive medicine and occupational medicine. *combined and certificate training programs in various areas of public health.

Marie Ontario Lottery and Gaming Corporation (), known for corporate branding purposes simply as OLG since 2006, is a Crown corporation owned by the Government of Ontario, Canada. It is responsible for the province's lotteries, charity and Aboriginal casinos, commercial casinos, and slot machines at horse-racing tracks. It was created in April 2000 when the Ontario Lottery Corporation (OLC) was merged with the Ontario Casino Corporation (OCC), established in 1994; prior to 2006, the combined entity was known in short form as the OLGC (or SLJO in French). OLG employs over 8000 individuals throughout Ontario. OLG's prize centre is located in Toronto, while the corporation's primary headquarters is located in Sault Ste. Marie. Whereas OLG is responsible for, and operates a variety of gaming services, the Alcohol and Gaming Commission of Ontario (AGCO) regulates casino gaming. OLG reports through its board of directors to the Minister of Finance. From 2003 to 2007 it was under the Ministry of Public Infrastructure Renewal. The OLG operates a self-exclusion program for people with gambling addictions, although this program has been controversial. The Ontario problem gambling hotline is 1.888.230.3505  History  OLG Prize Centre in Toronto. The Ontario Lottery Corporation was created in February 1975 under the Ontario Lottery Corporation Act, 1975 (repealed in 1999 and replaced with the current Ontario Lottery and Gaming Corporation Act). Wintario was the first lottery game offered by the fledgling OLC on April 3, 1975 and the first drawing took place on May 15, 1975. The product was discontinued in late 1996 after awarding over CAD$1.1 billion in winnings.  Modernization  OLG has chosen to modernize as over the past 30 years, demographics have changed, as have people‚Äôs shopping patterns. Global gaming options are more accessible ‚Äî particularly online. At the same time, U.S. visitors have declined. All of these shifts have put the industry and its contribution to the province at risk in the long term. Modernization will enable OLG to provide additional revenues to the Province to help fund the operation of hospitals and other provincial priorities. As a result of modernization, OLG will: * Become more customer-focused * Expand the regulated private sector delivery of lottery and gaming * Renew its role in the conduct and management of lottery and gaming. Modernization will help to create jobs across Ontario and trigger private sector investment. The capital costs of expanding, improving or simply maintaining gaming facilities will no longer be carried by taxpayers. Ontario residents and visitors will have access to more innovative and fun games. In addition, the existing lottery distribution network will be expanded to include multi-lane sales at large retailers, accommodating a broader customer base. = iGaming = As part of modernization efforts OLG has introduced iGaming. iGaming is the first provincially government-regulated internet gambling site. OLG has launched PlayOLG.ca as well as a mobile app PlayOLG. These are new secure online gambling programs that features fun and exciting games, along with a comprehensive Responsible Gambling program.

They are located at: *Ajax Downs - operated by Great Canadian Gaming *Clinton Raceway *Dresden Raceway *Flamboro Downs - operated by Great Canadian Gaming *Georgian Downs *Grand River Raceway *Hanover Raceway *Kawartha Downs - operated by Great Canadian Gaming *Mohawk Racetrack *Rideau Carleton Raceway *Sudbury Downs *Western Fair Raceway *Woodbine Racetrack - operated by Great Canadian Gaming *Woodstock Raceway Slots at racetracks generated $300 million annually for the racetracks until 2012 when the program ended. However, threatened with the closure of numerous tracks, the Ontario government extended the plan while it determined its future direction in gaming facilities.  E-bingo  OLG operates e-bingo (electric bingo) centres in Barrie, Peterborough, Kingston and Sudbury. Some games are linked to be played at all four simultaneously.  Age requirements  The minimum age to purchase OLG lottery tickets is 18; however, for patronizing casinos and/or parimutuel facilities in the province, it is 19. Violators who sell OLG lottery tickets to anyone under the age of 18 can face significant fines under the legislation passed in 1997. In addition OLG reserves the right to suspend violators found to have sold OLG lottery tickets to anyone under the age of 18.  Collections  Prizes under $1000 can be collected directly from a retailer that has a lottery terminal in store. This is subject to cash availability. People can collect bigger prizes by visiting an OLG Casino or Slot facility. This can be done by mailing the ticket to the OLG Prize Centre or by visiting the OLG Prize Centre in Toronto. When claiming the prize at the OLG Prize Centre, the prizewinner must have valid government identification as well as providing a signature. The ticket will be double checked in case of fraud. If the prize money is $5000 or more the terminal will freeze and OLG will be contacted. OLG will inform the winner directly of how to claim their prize. If the prize money is $10,000 or more, the process of claiming your prize will involve an interview and an investigator validating the authority of the ticket. Once approved, there will be a picture taken of you with your cheque. OLG publicizes all winners of $1,000 or more on their website. There is a time period of exactly one year from the draw date to claim Ontario lottery games.  Controversies = Retailer fraud  On October 25, 2006, the CBC program The Fifth Estate aired an investigative report on lottery retailers winning major prizes, focusing on the ordeal of 82-year-old Bob Edmonds. His $250,000 winning Encore ticket was stolen by a convenience store clerk when he went to have his ticket checked in 2001. For the next four years, OLG ignored Edmonds' inquiries after the clerk and her husband were falsely named the rightful winners. Later, when the couple were arrested for fraud, OLG refused to return his winnings, maintaining that it wasn't their responsibility that they had been tricked; in 2004, a judge disagreed, and forced OLG to give Edmonds his money. They did so, on the condition that Edmonds sign a confidentiality agreement, so that he would never tell the press about certain details of the ordeal. Also, The Fifth Estate uncovered internal OLG memos where several employees admitted they believed Edmonds' story. Immediately following the broadcast, Edmonds received a call from OLG's president, Duncan Brown, who apologized and claimed he was ashamed about how his staff treated Edmonds. OLG later released Edmonds from the confidentiality agreement. He died on April 2, 2007. In another case, Toronto variety store owner Hafiz Malik had defrauded four school board employees out of their $5.7 million prize. He was arrested after the original ticket owners filed a complaint with police. The OPP seized or froze over $5-million of Malik's assets, including bank accounts, three cars, and a home in Mississauga. OLG has since awarded the rightful winners the prize plus interest. The report by the fifth estate added that over 200 lottery retailers in Ontario have won major prizes from 1999 to 2006. A statistician featured in the report, Jeff Rosenthal, calculated that the chance that this would occur purely out of luck is one in a \\"trillion trillion trillion trillion\\" (or quindecillion). OLG did have a policy on insider wins, but it was rarely enforced during that period. Provincial ombudsman Andr√© Marin released a report stating that Ontario store owners and their families claimed about $100 million in lottery wins between 1999 and 2006, with tens of millions of fraudulent claims being ignored by the OLGC. OLG has since mandated new security measures to protect lottery customers, notably with customer-facing displays when tickets are checked, as well as special music played with a winning ticket. As of January 28, 2008, lottery retailers are required to ensure that tickets are signed. There is a signature box shown on the front of all on-line lottery tickets. Sign Your Lotto Ticket, As of January 28, 2008, lottery customers are required to sign their lottery tickets.  Lottery ticket recalls  2007 Super Bingo recall = In March 2007, OLG announced that it had recalled over 1,000,000 scratch and win tickets. The \\"Super Bingo\\" series of tickets were removed from retail stores after it was announced that a customer made the claim that he could visually tell which tickets were winners. It was the largest recall ever of a lottery ticket in Canada, and were prompted in part from greater media scrutiny regarding ongoing fraud investigations. = 2009 Fruit Scratch recall = In January 2009, OLG announced it has recalled over 1,000 scratch and win tickets. The \\"Fruit Scratch\\" series of lottery tickets were removed from retail stores after it was discovered that over dozens of lottery tickets were reportedly misprinted. Up to 150 of the misprinted tickets were reportedly purchased at eight stores across Southern Ontario one-week before the recall was issued. OLG has since reached an undisclosed settlement with a 27-year-old Thomas Noftall from Brampton, Ontario, who was mistakenly told that he may have won $135,000 on a misprinted lottery ticket.  Slot machine recall  In February 2007, it was discovered that 87 slot machines at Provincially run casinos were displaying subliminal messages on slot machine screens to players. An image of a winning symbol combination was shown quickly before or during the simulated spinning of the slot machine reels. The manufacturer, Konami, provided a software update for the machines.  Aftermath  In the wake of these controversies, the provincial government ordered Duncan Brown to be relieved of his position as OLG chief on 21 March 2007. This was not public knowledge until two days later, when Brown's dismissal took effect. David Caplan, Ontario's minister responsible for OLG, intended to announce this firing on 26 March following the release of a report on OLG's situation by provincial ombudsman Andr√© Marin. Marin criticized the OLG for being more fixated on profits than the integrity of games after a disproportionate number of lottery retailers or their families claimed winning tickets.  Exclusion program inefficiency  Casino clients who recognize that they have a gambling addiction can benefit from the self-exclusion program operated by the OLG. An investigation conducted by the CBC's The Fifth Estate (TV series) in late 2017 led to concerns as to whether the program is effective. According to a CBC article, \\"Gambling addicts ... said that while on the ... self-exclusion list, they entered OLG properties on a regular basis\\" in spite of the facial recognition technology in place at the casinos. As well, a CBC journalist who tested the system found that he was able to enter casinos and gamble on four distinct occasions, in spite of being registered and photographed for the program. Previous studies in other countries have also confirmed that self- exclusion programs can be difficult to enforce. Some experts maintain that casinos in general arrange for self-exclusion programs as a public relations measure without actually helping those with problem gambling issues. A campaign of this type \\"deflects attention away from problematic products and industries,\\" according to Natasha Dow Schull, a cultural anthropologist at New York University and author of the book Addiction by Design. Other experts believe that self-enforcement is part of the problem gambler's own responsibility, as one aspect of any therapy program. \\"Without such acceptance of responsibility, much of the effectiveness of self-exclusion programs would be lost\\", as one explained. As OLG literature confirms, the enforcement by a casino cannot be expected to be 100% foolproof. \\"If you attempt to re-enter a gaming facility in Ontario, your image may be captured by cameras and you may be automatically detected by security.\\" An OLG spokesman provided this response when questioned by the CBC after the investigation of the self- enforcement program had been completed: \\"We provide supports to self-excluders by training our staff, by providing disincentives, by providing facial recognition, by providing our security officers to look for players. No one element is going to be foolproof because it is not designed to be foolproof\\".  Chair of the Board of Directors of the OLGC  * Peter M. Deeb 2019 - present * George L.

Firle refers to an old-English/Anglo-Saxon word fierol meaning overgrown with oak. Although the original division of East Firle and West Firle still remains, East Firle is now simply confined to the houses of Heighton Street, which lie to the east of the Firle Park. West Firle is now generally referred to as Firle although West Firle remains its official name. It is located south of the A27 road four miles (9 km) east of Lewes. History of the village The Street, Firle in 1901 During the reign of Edward the Confessor (1042‚Äì66) Firle was part of the Abbey of Wilton's estate. Following the Norman conquest of England the village and surrounding lands were passed to Robert, Count of Mortain. Half-brother of King William I, Robert was the largest landowner in the country after the monarch. The village is mentioned in the Domesday Book, referred to as 'Ferla'. The value of the village is listed as being ¬£44, which was amongst the highest in the county. The manor house, the site on which Firle Place now stands, was occupied from the early 14th century by the 'de Livet' (Levett) family, an ancient Sussex gentry family of Norman descent who owned the manor. The Levett family would later include founders of Sussex's iron industry, royal courtiers, knights, rectors, an Oxford University dean, a prominent early physician and medical educator, and even a lord mayor of London. An ancient bronze seal found in the 1800s near Eastbourne, now in the collection of the Lewes Castle Museum, shows the coat-of-arms of John Livet and is believed to have belonged to the first member of the family named lord of Firle in 1316. On the bankruptcy of lord of the manor Thomas Levett in 1440, the ownership passed to Bartholomew Bolney, whose daughter married William Gage in 1472. Following the death of Bolney in 1476 without a male heir, the seat of Firle Place was passed to William Gage and has remained the seat of the Viscount Gage ever since. During the Second World War, Firle Plantation to the south of the village was the operational base of a four-man Home Guard Auxiliary Unit.  The Greengage at Hengrave Hall, Suffolk  The commonly used word greengage is linked with another branch of the Gage family who lived at Hengrave Hall in Suffolk. It would appear that Sir William Gage, 2nd bart (c. 1650-1727), introduced the Gross Reine Claude fruit tree to England from France ca. 1725, and later became known as the greengage plum. Francis Young, author of The Gages of Hengrave, Suffolk Catholicism 1640-1767  Notable residents  The writer Virginia Woolf visited nearby Lewes in December 1910 and decided to relocate in Firle, where she rented a house and renamed it Little Talland House. Pointz Hall, a fictional manor from her novel Between the Acts, is believed to be inspired by Firle Place. Woolf's sister, the painter and interior designer Vanessa Bell, moved to Firle in 1916 taking residence with her live-in lover Duncan Grant in Charleston Farmhouse, which subsequently became a regular haunt of the Bloomsbury Group. Vanessa Bell, her son Quentin Bell, and Duncan Grant are all buried in the churchyard of St Peter's, Firle. Writer Katherine Mansfield, who had close ties with the Bloomsbury Group, also lived in Firle for a brief time. Economist John Maynard Keynes, another member of the Bloomsbury Group, took an extended lease in a house in Firle in 1925 and died there in 1946. Keynes was cremated and his ashes scattered above the downs of nearby Tilton. General Thomas Gage was born in Firle.  Village features  John Piper window St Peter's Church notably contains an alabaster effigy of Sir John Gage wearing his Order of the Garter and lying beside his wife Philippa. It also has a John Piper stained-glass window in warm colours, depicting Blake's Tree of Life. There are also memorials for those named Bolney, Moreton, Levett, Swaffield and others. The current vicar is the Reverend Peter Owen- Jones. The Ram Inn is the only remaining one of the village's three original public houses, that previously all acted as resting stops on the Lewes to Alfriston coach road. It was also the village court room where the rents for tenants farmers were collected and set. The area in front of the Ram is called the Beach, not to be confused with the Dock which is further up the street. Firle Cricket Club was founded in 1758 and is said to be one of the oldest in the country. Even earlier in 1725 Sir William Gage, 7th Baronet challenged the Duke of Richmond to a game of cricket, one of the first recorded matches. The club continues to be central to village life and has two teams which both compete in the East Sussex Cricket League. The Firle 1st XI are in ESCL Division 3 and the Firle 2nd XI are in ESCL Division 9. Previously both teams played in the Cuckmere Valley League; 2007 was their first year in the ESCL. South of the village lie the South Downs and Firle Beacon, which reaches a height of 712 feet (217 m). The beacon was once a lighting beacon used as part of a warning system during the time of the Spanish Armada in 1588. On the site there are also around 50 Bronze Age burial barrows. Monument to Sir John Gage and his wife Phillippa in St Peter's Church, Firle. Samuel Hieronymus Grimm Firle Bonfire Society is first mentioned in 1879 in a diary of the then vicar of Firle, Reverend Crawley, though it was re-formed in 1982 to encourage and promote traditional bonfire festivities in the village. The society forms part of a network of bonfire societies in the Lewes area which serve the purpose both of remembering the Gunpowder Plot and of recalling the fate of the Sussex Martyrs. The village holds its celebrations in October before the main event in Lewes. Traditionally the Firle Bonfire Society Pioneers wear Valencian costumes. It is customary to burn an effigy other than Guy Fawkes; in 2003 an effigy of a Gypsy family in a caravan was burned, sparking a controversy that resulted in members of the bonfire society being arrested. Governance On a local level, Firle is governed by Firle Parish Council, which meets every two months in the Firle village memorial hall. Its responsibilities include footpaths, street lighting, playgrounds and minor planning applications. The parish council has five seats available which were uncontested in the May 2007 election. The next level of government is the district council. The parish of Firle lies within the Ouse Valley and Ringmer ward of Lewes District Council which returns three seats to the council. The election on 4 May 2007 elected two Liberal Democrats and one Conservative. East Sussex County Council is the next tier of government, for which Firle is within the Ouse Valley East division. The council has responsibility for education, libraries, social services, civil registration, trading standards and transport. Elections for the county council are held every four years. The Liberal Democrat Thomas Ost was elected in the 2005 election. The UK Parliament constituency for Firle is Lewes. The Liberal Democrat Norman Baker served as the constituency MP since 1997, before losing his seat in the 2015 general election to the Conservative Maria Caulfield. She had her majority reduced to just over 2,000 in the 2019 general election by runner up Lib Dem candidate, Oli Henman. Landmarks Firle Escarpment is a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) within the parish which extends into the neighbouring parish of Beddingham. The site is an extensive area of chalkland which hosts a wide range of flora. The rarest of these is the early spider orchid Ophrys sphegodes.

The club has taken a significant part in the development of mountaineering in the United Kingdom, and many famous British climbers have been members of the club. Andrew Irvine was at Merton College and was a member of the OUMC at the time of his fatal attempt to climb Everest with George Mallory. Tom Bourdillon (whose father was one of the club's founders), Charles Evans and Michael Westmacott, all former members of the OUMC, were members of the successful 1953 British Expedition to Everest. Evans was Deputy Leader to John Hunt on that expedition, Bourdillon was responsible for the oxygen apparatus, and Westmacott was in charge of keeping the dangerous passage through the Khumbu Icefall open. Bourdillon and Evans made the first attempt on the summit, on 26 May 1953, three days before the successful climb by Sir Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay. They reached the South Summit (at 8750 m then the highest summit to have been climbed), but had to turn back due to severe exhaustion. Charles Evans was later the Leader of the first successful expedition to Kangchenjunga in 1955. Stephen Venables was the first British climber to climb Everest without using an oxygen cylinder; he climbed to the South Col via the Kangshung Face, creating a new route, and then went solo to the summit, as his colleagues were exhausted. The club has sent exploratory mountaineering expeditions to mountain ranges all over the world. It claims first ascents of peaks in such places as Greenland, the Himalayas, the Karakoram, Kishtwar, Peru, Spitsbergen, and Wakhan.

It was used for monumental brasses, in decorative effects on borders, rivets or other details of metalwork (particularly armour), in livery and pilgrim badges or funerary effigies. Latten commonly contained varying amounts of copper, tin, zinc and lead, giving it characteristics of both brass and bronze. Metalworkers commonly formed latten in thin sheets and used it to make church utensils. Brass of this period is made through the calamine brass process, from copper and zinc ore. (Later brass was made with zinc metal from Champion's smelting process and is not generally referred to as latten.) This calamine brass was generally manufactured as hammered sheet or \\"battery brass\\" (hammered by a \\"battery\\" of water-powered trip hammers) and cast brass was rare. \\"Latten\\" also refers to a type of tin plating on iron (or possibly some other base metal), which is known as white latten; and black latten refers to laten-brass, which is brass milled into thin plates or sheets. The term \\"latten\\" has also been used, rarely, to refer to lead alloys. In general, metal in thin sheets is said to be latten such as gold latten; and lattens (plural) refers to metal sheets between 1/64\\" and 1/32\\" in thickness.

Scorchy Smith was a pilot-for-hire whose initial adventures took him across America, fighting criminals and aiding damsels in distress. Later, Scorchy traveled the world fighting spies and foreign aggression.  Publication history=Terry and Sickles Sample Noel Sickles strips. Charles Lindbergh's 1927 transatlantic flight increased interest in aviation, and together with several other flight- related adventure strips, Scorchy Smith debuted in 1930, created by John Terry for AP Newsfeatures. When Terry developed fatal tuberculosis in 1933, the strip was assigned to Noel Sickles; Sickles' first credited strip ran on April 2, 1934. Sickles increased the popularity of Scorchy Smith, which became AP's leading strip. Sickles' impressionistic style and cinematic compositions, plus his frequent use of areas of pure black ink and Zipatone shading, was dramatically different from any other cartoonist at the time. Milton Caniff's mastery of the medium is frequently attributed to his collaborations with Sickles. After working on the strip for two years, Sickles estimated that Scorchy Smith was running in about 250 newspapers, which would make the syndicate about $2,500 a month. He only got paid $125 a month, so he asked the syndicate for a raise. He didn't get it, so he quit the strip to become a commercial illustrator. His last strip ran on October 24, 1936. From Sickles to Christman Rodlow Willard drew the strip from 1946 to 1954. Sickles was succeeded by Bert Christman, who began drawing and scripting the strip November 23, 1936. Christman, a cartoonist who also co-created the Sandman for DC Comics, joined the U.S. Navy as an aviation cadet in June 1938, resigning his commission three years later to join the American Volunteer Group being recruited to fly for the Chinese Air Force. He was shot down, bailed out, then strafed and killed in Burma as a pilot with the AVG, by then famous as the Flying Tigers. After Christman left Scorchy Smith, a succession of artists handled the strip, including Howell Dodd and Frank Robbins, who began signing the strip on May 22, 1939. Robbins, who had never had a feature of his own before, soon developed a solid reputation for creating comic-strip adventure. A wartime sequence set in Russia drew the following comment.\\"...formidable reality: it creates the sense of deep snows, it is full of bitter, bloody struggle\\".Coulton Waugh, \\"The Comics\\" (1947) In 1944, he was hired by King Features Syndicate, where he created Johnny Hazard, another pilot-adventurer. Robbins' last strip ran March 12, 1944. After Robbins left the strip, it was taken on by Edmund Good (1944-1946), Rodlow Willard (1946‚Äì1953), Alvin Hollingsworth (1953-1954), George Tuska (1954‚Äì1959), and John Milt Morris (1959‚Äì1961). The strip ended on December 30, 1961.. Hollingsworth was long believed the last to do Sundays as well as dailies, but using online newspaper sources it was discovered The Fabulous Fifties blog, May 4 2017 that George Tuska did a daily version until July 25 1959 with AP staff artist John Morris continuing into 1961. last Tuska daily and first Morris daily can be seen at The Fabulous Fifties blog, May 4 2017 and a two tier Sunday version until the end of 1955.

The feast day is observed by Roman Catholics as well as some Anglicans. It is originally based on the Catholic devotion to the Divine Mercy that Faustina Kowalska reported as part of her encounter with Jesus, and is associated with special promises from Jesus and indulgences issued by the Catholic Church. The feast of Divine Mercy, according to the diary of Kowalska, receives from Jesus the biggest promises of grace related to the Devotion of Divine Mercy, in particular that a person who goes to sacramental confession (the confession may take place some days before) and receives holy communion on that day, shall obtain the total expiation of all sins and punishment. That means each person would go immediately after death to heaven without suffering in purgatory. Additionally, the Roman Catholic Church grants a plenary indulgence (observing the usual rules) with the recitation of some simple prayers.Saints of the Jubilee by Tim Drake 2002 pages 85-95Ann Ball, 2003 Encyclopedia of Catholic Devotions and Practices pages 174-175 Devotion to the Divine Mercy Faustina Kowalska, a Polish nun, reported visions and visitations from Jesus and conversations with him.

She wrote: \\"The crowd was so enormous that the eye could not take it all in. Everyone was participating in the celebrations.\\" Divine Mercy Sunday is also the day after the culmination of the novena of the Chaplet of Divine Mercy.EWTN on the Divine Mercy NovenaDivine Mercy Novena Kowalska wrote Jesus instructed her that the Feast of Mercy (the Sunday after Easter) be preceded by a Divine Mercy Novena which would begin on Good Friday.

They are located in the 11th district, Simmering. They were used from 1899 to 1984 as gas storage tanks. After the changeover from town gas to natural gas between 1969 and 1978, they were no longer used and were shut down. Only the brick exterior front walls were preserved. The structures have found new residential and commercial use in modern times. History The Gasometers were built from 1896 to 1899 in the Simmering district of Vienna near the Gaswerk Simmering gas works of the district. The containers were used to help supply Vienna with town gas, facilities which had previously been provided by the English firm Inter Continental Gas Association (ICGA). Once the contracts with the ICGA expired, the city decided to construct facilities to handle its own gas needs. At the time, the design was the largest in all of Europe. The Gasometers were retired in 1984 due to new technologies in gasometer construction, as well as the city's conversion from town gas and coal gas to natural gas. Gas can be stored underground or in modern high-pressure gas storage spheres under much higher pressures and in smaller volumes than the relatively large gasometers. In 1978, they were designated as protected historic landmarks. Vienna undertook a remodelling and revitalization of the protected monuments and in 1995 called for ideas for the new use of the structures. The chosen designs by the architects Jean Nouvel (Gasometer A), Coop Himmelblau (Gasometer B), Manfred Wehdorn (Gasometer C) and Wilhelm Holzbauer (Gasometer D) were completed between 1999 and 2001. Each gasometer was divided into several zones for living (apartments in the top), working (offices in the middle floors) and entertainment and shopping (shopping malls in the ground floors). The shopping mall levels in each gasometer are connected to the others by skybridges. The historic exterior wall was conserved. One of the ideas rejected for the project was the plan by architect Manfred Wehdorn to use the Gasometers for hotels and facilities for the planned World Expo in Vienna and Budapest. On 30 October 2001, the mayor attended the official grand opening of the Gasometers, but people had begun moving in as early as May 2001.

They are each 70 meters tall and 60 meters in diameter. The Gasometers were gutted during the remodelling and only the brick exterior and parts of the roof were left standing. Coal gas was dry-distilled from coal and was stored in these containers before it was distributed into the city gas network. The \\"town gas\\" was originally used only by the street lamps, but in 1910, its use for cooking and heating in private homes was introduced. Today Indoor facilities include a music hall (capacity 2000-3000 people), movie theatre, student dormitory, municipal archive, and so on. There are about 800 apartments (two thirds within the historic brick walls) with 1600 regular tenants, as well as about 70 student apartments with 250 students in residence.

Introduced in the 1983 film Return of the Jedi, he was brought to life both as a puppet and a costumed actor during the film. Nunb was puppeteered by Mike Quinn and was portrayed by Richard Bonehill in wide shots. The character was voiced by Kipsang Rotich, a Kenyan student who spoke in his native Kalenjin, as well as in the Kikuyu. Quinn and Rotich both returned for the role in the sequel trilogy, namely Star Wars: The Force Awakens (2015), Star Wars: The Last Jedi (2017), and Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker (2019). Within the fictional Star Wars universe, Nien Nunb is an arms dealer of the Sullustan species who joins the Rebel Alliance in fighting the evil Galactic Empire. Three decades later, Nunb is a starfighter pilot in the Resistance against the First Order, including the Battle of Starkiller Base. Creation and portrayal Nunb's name originated from the fact that he was referred to as \\"Number Nine\\" on creature packaging. In an interview, Richard Marquand described Nien Nunb as, \\"‚Ä¶a Muppet, a guy under the deck does his thing. He's got some dialogue to do. He's got this funny, twitchy face. He's a terrific character in my mind\\". Nien Nunb was brought to life by both a puppeteer and as a costumed-actor during the film. Initially, he was just to appear in the briefing room scenes, and the Endor celebration. For these appearances he was portrayed by stuntman Richard Bonehill, in costume and mask. However, Nunb was later chosen, by series creator George Lucas, to appear in the Millennium Falcon, as Lando Calrissian's co-pilot. Since the character now had dialogue, it was decided that the mask would be reworked into a puppet, with mechanisms to allow for moving lips and eyes. For these scenes, in the cockpit, the role was handed over to puppeteer Mike Quinn. The character was voiced by Bill Kipsang Rotich, a Kenyan student and native Kalenjin speaker, who spoke in Kikuyu and Haya for the role. After voicing the character, Rotich became a local celebrity in his home country, as many Kenyan viewers could hear their own languages in a Star Wars film, and understand the character's dialogue. Quinn returned to the role for The Force Awakens, without Bonehill, who died in February 2015. Rotich was also tracked down in his native Kenya, by actor Christian Simpson, to voice the character again. Appearances=FilmsReturn of the Jedi (1983)= Nunb is introduced as a member of the Alliance Fleet, selected to fly as co-pilot to General Lando Calrissian (Billy Dee Williams) aboard the Millennium Falcon during the Battle of Endor, where they lead the assault to destroy the second Death Star. Before the battle, when the Alliance Fleet gathers near Sullust, Nunb expresses concern about the plan of attack and whether General Han Solo (Harrison Ford), Princess Leia Organa (Carrie Fisher), and their team would be able to successfully destroy the Death Star's shield generator on the moon of Endor before the fleet arrived. Calrissian assures him that Solo would have the shield down on schedule. With Nunb and Calrissian in the cockpit of the Millennium Falcon leading the attack, the Alliance Fleet arrives over Endor to find that the shield generator is still operational, quickly realizing that the battle is a trap set by Emperor Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid) to engage and destroy the Rebel Alliance once and for all. The fleet remains over Endor and engages Imperial forces in the hopes that Solo and his team would still be able to complete their mission and destroy the generator. The fleet keeps to fighting Imperial TIE fighters and Star Destroyers, particularly once they learn that the Death Star is operational. Once Solo's team destroys the shield generator, the Millennium Falcon enters the Death Star's superstructure and fires the shot that begins a chain reaction that destroys the battle station. Nunb and Calrissian escape the Death Star just before it is consumed in a massive explosion. Nunb joins his fellow Rebels and the native Ewoks on the surface of Endor in celebrating the destruction of the Death Star and the downfall of the Empire. =The Force Awakens (2015)= Mike Quinn confirmed on October 19, 2015 via Facebook that he would return in Star Wars: The Force Awakens as Nien Nunb. Later on December 6, the character's appearance was seen in a TV spot for the film. Kipsang Rotich also reprised his role as the voice for Nien Nunb, having been tracked down by actor Christian Simpson. In the film, when the First Order destroys the Hosnian System with the Starkiller Base superweapon, the Resistance base on D'Qar becomes the next target. Quickly establishing a plan to destroy Starkiller Base, Nunb, along with the rest of the Starfighter Corps, flies to the planet in an attempt to destroy its thermal oscillator and disable the weapon. During the battle, many Resistance pilots are killed before the oscillator is destroyed by Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac). Nunb is one of seven surviving X-wing pilots, and he celebrates with the rest of the Resistance upon returning to D'Qar. =The Last Jedi (2017)= Mike Quinn reprised his role as Nien Nunb in Star Wars: The Last Jedi, the second installment of the sequel trilogy. Kipsang Rotich, on the other hand, did not, because the character doesn't have any lines in this film. In the film, Nien Nunb evacuates alongside his fellow soldiers from the Resistance base of D'Qar, and is present aboard the Raddus during the battle of the Resistance's bombers against the First Order. Nunb later escapes offscreen alongside Leia and other Resistance members to the old Rebellion base on the planet of Crait. On Crait, Nien pilots a ski speeder along with Poe Dameron, rogue stormtrooper Finn (John Boyega), Resistance mechanic Rose Tico (Kelly Marie Tran) and X-wing pilot C‚Äôai Threnalli. He (along with Poe, Threnalli and Tico) has to bail out as the super laser, which they were trying to destroy, becomes too powerful. Nunb is seen at the end of the film talking with Finn as the remaining members of the Resistance escape from the clutches of the First Order once more. =The Rise of Skywalker (2019)= Kipsang Rotich returned as Nien Nunb for the first time since The Force Awakens, and Mike Quinn returned as his puppeteer. Over one year since the last fight with the First Order, Nien Nunb follows the Resistance to relocate to Ajan Kloss, where they discuss how they are going to defeat Sheev Palpatine and his evil Sith Empire. Minutes before take-off, as the Resistance plan their final offensive, Nunb suggests to the Resistance that there aren't enough of them to defeat Palpatine's Sith Fleet. Poe persuades him and all of the Resistance that that is what Palpatine wants them to think - but it is not true. During the climatic final battle on Exegol, Nien Nunb flies the Tantive IV, Leia‚Äôs personal craft. He loses control of the ship when Palpatine uses Force lightning to disable all of the Resistance ships in an attempt to stop them from destroying his fleet, before Rey stopped him and is killed in the process. ComicsPrincess Leia (2015)= In the comic Star Wars: Princess Leia (2015), which is set shortly after the end of Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope, Nunb helps Leia with a mission to unite the few survivors of the destruction of Alderaan. On his native planet, Sullust, Nunb helps Leia smuggle the Alderaanians away from the Empire. He also provides the arms in his ship to Leia and her people, to use against the Empire. Leia presents him with a necklace that once belonged to her adoptive mother, Queen Breha Organa of Alderaan, as a token of her gratitude. Later in the mission, Leia turns herself over to Imperial Commander Dreed on the desert world of Skaradosh in exchange for the release of Tula, an Imperial officer from Alderaan; Tula's sister, Tace, is part of Leia's group of refugees and Tula secretly manipulates her sister for information about Leia‚Äôs whereabouts. Before she can be taken captive, the Mellcrawler arrives to rescue her, with Nunb having slipped the ship onto the planet without the orbiting Imperial forces noticing. Leia thanks Nunb for his efforts, but he says that the real test would be making it past the Imperial forces alive. Nunb launches a decoy to fool the Imperial vessels, leaving them to follow the sensor decoy as the Mellcrawler avoids their detection. The trick is successful and the Star Destroyer crew believes the Mellcrawler has been destroyed, and Leia with it. At that moment, a fleet of Alderaanians from Espirion arrive to assist Leia. The arrival of the fleet allows the Alderaanians to destroy the Star Destroyer, and the Alderaanian fleet escapes the wrath of the Empire. Nunb later attends a celebration to celebrate the success of the mission to unite them. Video games Nien Nunb appears as a playable Hero character in the Outer Rim expansion pack for the video game Star Wars Battlefront (2015). Nien Nunb is a \\"Unique\\" unit in the 2017 ftp Mobile game Star Wars Force Arena by Netmarble. He is partnered with Lando Calrissian. He uses a ranged weapon to do area of effect damage and can evade melee attackers. He also appears as a playable character in LEGO Star Wars: The Force Awakens and is expected to appear in the upcoming LEGO Star Wars: the Skywalker Saga.

It was composed of two lines, one connecting Richmond (immediately north of Halifax) with Windsor, the other connecting Richmond with Pictou Landing via Truro. The railway was incorporated March 31, 1853 and received a charter to build railway lines from Halifax to Pictou by way of Truro, as well as from Halifax to Victoria Beach, Nova Scotia on the Annapolis Basin opposite Digby by way of Windsor. The company also received a charter to build from Truro to the border with New Brunswick. The railway was a key project of the visionary Nova Scotian leader Joseph Howe who felt a government built railway led by Nova Scotia was necessary after the failure of the Intercolonial Railway talks and several fruitless private proposals. Sandford Fleming supervised construction of the Eastern Line of the NSR in 1867. The railway line to Windsor (known as the Windsor Branch) was opened in June 1858 and the line to Truro (known as the Eastern Line) was opened in December 1858. No further work was undertaken on the line to Victoria Beach beyond Windsor but the Eastern Line to Pictou Landing was completed by June 1867, under the supervision of Sir Sandford Fleming. The construction of the Nova Scotia Railway by the colonial government was partly encouraged by the construction failures and ongoing delays in building the Shubenacadie Canal The success of the railway came at the expense of the canal which opened in 1861, but soon fell into disrepair from lack of use (and because the rail bridges over the canal were too low for the steamers on the canal). One noteworthy early feature of operations on the Nova Scotia Railway was the first known case of intermodal operations involving the \\"piggyback\\" transport of road vehicles on railway cars. Farmers in the Windsor area were able to drive their teams of horses and loaded wagons onto railway cars and be transported into Halifax to sell their loads, returning to Windsor the same day. On July 1, 1867, ownership of the NSR was passed from the Government of Nova Scotia to the Government of Canada. Engine No. 6, Pictou The Windsor Branch was leased to the Windsor and Annapolis Railway in 1871. The W&A; became part of the Dominion Atlantic Railway or DAR in 1894 and the DAR itself was purchased by the Canadian Pacific Railway or CPR in 1912, although it was operated as a separate entity. When the DAR was sold by CPR in 1994, the Windsor Branch came under the control of the shortline Windsor and Hantsport Railway. The Government of Canada dissolved the NSR in 1872 when it became part of the Intercolonial Railway. The ICR in turn was controlled by Canadian Government Railways from 1915-1918 and was merged into the Canadian National Railways or CNR in 1918. The Halifax to Truro line remains part of CN, however the rest of the Eastern Line from Truro to Pictou was sold by CN in 1993 to the Cape Breton and Central Nova Scotia Railway as part of CN's sale of the entire Truro to Sydney line.

The total population in 2017 was 9,312. Molsheim had been a very fast-growing city between the French censuses of 1968 and 1999, passing from 5,739 to 9,335 inhabitants, but this increase came to a noticeable halt since. The urban unit of Molsheim had 26,925 inhabitants in 2017, from 16,888 in 1968. Molsheim is part of the urban area of Strasbourg. Cityscape The old town of Molsheim is well preserved and contains a considerable number of old houses and buildings of typically Alsatian architecture. The most notable buildings are the medieval Tour des Forgerons, the Renaissance Metzig, the baroque (although built in late gothic style) Eglise des J√©suites ‚Äì an inordinately large church insofar as it could house the entire population of the town when built ‚Äì and the classical H√¥tel de ville.

Bishop Adeloch is buried in the church of Saint- Thomas in Strasbourg. In 1219, the Holy Roman Emperor Frederick II granted the town many rights and franchises. By 1263 Molsheim was already surrounded by a wall which, in the medieval sense, made town a city. However, the bishops of Strasbourg continued to own properties in Molsheim, resulting in conflicts iwth the Germanic emperors, a quarrel that was resolved in 1308 in favor of Bishop Jean de D√ºrbheim (German: Johann I. von Stra√üburg). Jean de D√ºrbheim enlarged the city wall in 1318 and built a ch√¢teau. When the bishop died in 1328, he was entombed in the chapel of a hospice he had founded, the future site of the Jesuit church, which is the present parish church of Molsheim. His tomb is still visible today. Molsheim as a center of the Counter- Reformation Etching depicting skirmishes between Dachstein and Molsheim on 2 December 1592. The strength of the Protestant Reformation in the Alsace and especially Strasbourg put pressure on Catholic institutions. In 1580 Laurent Gutjahr, the abbot of Altorf, acquired property in Molsheim; the Benedictines, established since the 11th century in Altorf, a town lacking fortifications, moved here for safety behind the ramparts of Molsheim. Also in 1580, the Jesuits established a school in Molsheim which Leopold V, Archduke of Austria. Similarly, in 1591, due to the suppression of the Carthusians in Strasbourg, members of the order moved to Molsheim and built a convent, the splendid stained glass of which was partly destroyed during the French Revolution. The stained glass that survived the Revolution was eventually transferred to Strasbourg. Siege of Molsheim (1610). In 1592, with the death of the bishop Jean de Manderscheid, a conflict arouse between the catholic parishioners of Molsheim and the protestant majority in the chapter of the diocese of Strasbourg, who elected Johann Georg von Brandenburg) as the bishop of Strasbourg; in opposition the catholics elected Charles of Lorraine (bishop of Metz and Strasbourg). This resulted in the Strasbourg Bishops' War (1592‚Äì1604), with a dismal effect on Molsheim. In 1618 the Thirty Years' War broke out, ending with the Peace of Westphalia in which control of Molsheim was transferred from the Holy Roman Empire to France. Molsheim was part of the Holy Roman Empire until 1648, when it found itself located on the French side of the border. Between 1871 and 1919 and again between 1940 and 1944, the German speaking city was part of Germany. A number of Merovingian tombs, dating from the sixth and seventh centuries were discovered in 1935 to the north of the town, on the Roman road leading from Avolsheim. Coat of Arms The town's coat of arms features a breaking wheel of gold, in which a nude man with a golden halo is interlaced and bound, against an azure field. The coat of arms is based on a seal of 1263 representing the martyrdom of Saint George. Economy Molsheim is notable as the home of the Bugatti automotive industry factory.

Piqu√© fabrics vary from semi-sheer dimity to heavy weight waffle cloth. Twilled cotton and corded cotton are close relatives. The weave is closely associated with white tie, and some accounts even say the fabric was invented specifically for this use. It holds more starch than plain fabric, so produces a stiffer shirt front. Marcella shirts then replaced earlier plain fronts, which remain a valid alternative. Marcella use then spread to other parts of the dress code and it is now the most common fabric used in the tie and waistcoat of white tie. A knit fabric with a similar texture is used in polo shirts. Marcella weaving was developed by the Lancashire cotton industry in the late 18th century as a mechanised technique of weaving double cloth with an enclosed heavy cording weft. It was originally used to make imitations of the corded Proven√ßal quilts made in Marseille, the manufacture of which became an important industry for Lancashire from the late 18th to the early 20th century. The term \\"marcella\\" is one of a number of variations on the word \\"Marseille\\". Piqu√© fabrics are a type of dobby construction. Piqu√©s may be constructed in various patterns such as cord, waffle, honeycomb and birdseye piqu√©s. These fabrics require the addition of extra yarns, called stuffer yarns. These stuffer yarns are incorporated into the back of the fabric to give texture and added depth to the fabric design. Some piqu√©s may be made using the Jacquard attachment on the loom. Although made of 100% cotton today, cotton-silk blends and even pure silk versions were made in the past and in a variety of weaves.

As an axiom, it offers a non-perturbative approach to quantum field theory. One example is the vertex operator algebra, which has been used to construct two- dimensional conformal field theories. Whether this result can be extended to QFT in general, thus resolving many of the difficulties of a perturbative approach, remains an open research question. In practical calculations, such as those needed for scattering amplitudes in various collider experiments, the operator product expansion is used in QCD sum rules to combine results from both perturbative and non-perturbative (condensate) calculations.  2D Euclidean quantum field theory  In 2D Euclidean field theory, the operator product expansion is a Laurent series expansion associated to two operators. A Laurent series is a generalization of the Taylor series in that finitely many powers of the inverse of the expansion variable(s) are added to the Taylor series: pole(s) of finite order(s) are added to the series. Heuristically, in quantum field theory one is interested in the result of physical observables represented by operators. If one wants to know the result of making two physical observations at two points z and w, one can time order these operators in increasing time. If one maps coordinates in a conformal manner, one is often interested in radial ordering. This is the analogue of time ordering where increasing time has been mapped to some increasing radius on the complex plane. One is also interested in normal ordering of creation operators. A radial-ordered OPE can be written as a normal-ordered OPE minus the non-normal-ordered terms. The non-normal-ordered terms can often be written as a commutator, and these have useful simplifying identities. The radial ordering supplies the convergence of the expansion. The result is a convergent expansion of the product of two operators in terms of some terms that have poles in the complex plane (the Laurent terms) and terms that are finite. This result represents the expansion of two operators at two different points as an expansion around just one point, where the poles represent where the two different points are the same point e.g. :1/(z-w). Related to this is that an operator on the complex plane is in general written as a function of z and \\\\bar{z}. These are referred to as the holomorphic and anti-holomorphic parts respectively, as they are continuous and differentiable except at the (finite number of) singularities. One should really call them meromorphic, but holomorphic is common parlance. In general, the operator product expansion may not separate into holomorphic and anti-holomorphic parts, especially if there are \\\\log z terms in the expansion. However, derivatives of the OPE can often separate the expansion into holomorphic and anti-holomorphic expansions. This expression is also an OPE and in general is more useful. Operator product algebra In the generic case, one is given a set of fields (or operators) A^i(x) that are assumed to be valued over some algebra. For example, fixing x, the A^i(x) may be taken to span some Lie algebra. Setting x free to live on a manifold, the operator product A^i(x)B^j(y) is then simply some element in the ring of functions. In general, such rings do not possess enough structure to make meaningful statements; thus, one considers additional axioms to strengthen the system. The operator product algebra is an associative algebra of the form :A^i(x)B^j(y) = \\\\sum_k f^{ij}_k (x,y,z) C^k(z) The structure constants f^{ij}_k (x,y,z) are required to be single-valued functions, rather than sections of some vector bundle. Furthermore, the fields are required to span the ring of functions. In practical calculations, it is usually required that the sums be analytic within some radius of convergence; typically with a radius of convergence of x-y. Thus, the ring of functions can be taken to be the ring of polynomial functions. The above can be viewed as a requirement that is imposed on a ring of functions; imposing this requirement on the fields of a conformal field theory is known as the conformal bootstrap. An example of an operator product algebra is the vertex operator algebra. It is currently hoped that operator product algebras can be used to axiomatize all of quantum field theory; they have successfully done so for the conformal field theories, and whether they can be used as a basis for non-perturbative QFT is an open research area.  Operator product expansion  In quantum field theory, the operator product expansion (OPE) is a convergent expansion of the product of two fields at different points as a sum (possibly infinite) of local fields. More precisely, if y is a point, and A and B are operator-valued fields, then there is an open neighborhood O of y such that for all x \\\\in O\\\\setminus {y} :A(x)B(y)=\\\\sum_{i}c_i(x-y)^i C_i(y) where the sum is over finitely or countably many terms, Ci are operator-valued fields, ci are analytic functions over O\\\\setminus {y} and the sum is convergent in the operator topology within O\\\\setminus {y} . OPEs are most often used in conformal field theory. The notation F(x,y)\\\\sim G(x,y) is often used to denote that the difference G(x,y)-F(x,y) remains analytic at the points x=y. This is an equivalence relation.

Establishment In 1976, Larry Levenson, a high school friend of Al Goldstein and a former fast-food manager who was selling ice cream at Coney Island, was introduced to the swinging lifestyle by a woman he met at a bar. After organizing swinging parties himself for a time, he opened a club \\"for swingers\\" in 1977, in the basement of the Kenmore Hotel on East 23rd Street between Lexington and Third Avenue, and called it \\"Plato's Retreat.\\" The same year, he moved it to the basement of the Ansonia Hotel, a 19th-century building on 2109 Broadway between West 73rd and West 74th Streets on the Upper West Side of Manhattan. The hotel used to house the Continental Baths, a gay bathhouse where singer Bette Midler, often accompanied by Barry Manilow on a baby grand piano, first became a national figure. Rules and premises Plato's Retreat was a \\"members-only\\" establishment that required everyone to follow the club's rules. Levenson barred male homosexuals, and accepted only straight couples - and women, escorted or otherwise - in the premises. Once a woman left a room after a sexual encounter, her male companion had to accompany her within two minutes. This rule was intended to ensure that women nearly always outnumbered men. Levenson strictly prohibited sexual activity between males but welcomed lesbians. Drugs, including alcohol, and prostitution services were forbidden, though, by subsequent accounts, prostitutes did frequent the premises and there was \\"rampant\\" use of drugs (most often quaaludes) by patrons. According to a 1979 advertisement in SCREW magazine, the club offered, besides a heated swimming pool, a sauna steam, whirlpool baths, disco dancing, free bar and buffet, \\"cozy living rooms and lounging areas\\", a \\"variety of swing areas\\", and a backgammon lounge. The Ansonia Hotel, 2109 Broadway, location of Plato's Retreat (1977-80) Fame During its heyday, Plato's Retreat was considered the world's most infamous sex club, popular with celebrities, porn stars, and well-to-do couples. The clientele was described as \\"an assortment of kinky types from the suburbs: dry cleaners and their wives, or fat men in toupees with their heavily made-up girlfriends.\\" Owner Levenson often partook in sexual activity on the premises, once winning a bet against Al Goldstein and 'Butch' Katz, owner of 42nd Street's Roxy Burlesk theater, that he could ejaculate fifteen times within a twenty-four-hour day. In 1980, Plato's relocated to 509 West 34th Street. Decline and closure In 1985, New York City Mayor Ed Koch backed the New York City Health Department's decision to shut down the city's gay bathhouses, in response to concerns over the spread of HIV/AIDS. In closing the gay bathhouses while allowing the heterosexual swingers' clubs - most notably Plato's Retreat - to remain open, the city found itself in violation of the newly adopted anti-discrimination law. The Health Department, with Koch's approval, reacted by ordering the heterosexual clubs, including Plato's Retreat, to close as well. The club's Manhattan location was shut down on New Year's Eve 1985, ostensibly for violating public-health ordinances. In 1981, Levenson and his by-then two partners along with Plato‚Äôs accountant were tried and convicted for tax evasion. When the prosecutor asked Levenson‚Äîwho was the only owner to take the stand‚Äîwhy Plato‚Äôs kept its accounting records off the premises, Levenson replied, ‚ÄúWhere would I keep them, in the swimming pool?‚Äù He served an 8-year prison sentence at the Allenwood federal prison. After serving his sentence, Levenson worked in various jobs, such as cab driver. He died in 1999 after a quadruple bypass heart surgery. In Florida Plato's Retreat relocated to Fort Lauderdale, Florida, where it reopened under the name \\"Plato's Retreat 2.\\" Located at 321 West Sunrise, the new location was in operation as an on-premises heterosexual swingers' club, open Monday through Sunday from eight p.m. until the last person left. Saturday night was for couples only. Plato's Retreat in Fort Lauderdale was a bring-your-own-bottle club, since no liquor was sold on the premises; however, it provided complimentary mixers, soft drinks, juices, and ice. In 2006, Plato's Retreat 2 closed, and then reopened as a sex club \\"for men only,\\" keeping the same location and bring-your-own format. The club at the Fort Lauderdale location currently operates under the business name \\"321 Slammer.\\"321 Slammer website In the 2010s, there are reportedly numerous on-premises swingers' clubs operating in South Florida. In popular culture In 1978, Joe Thomas released a disco single, \\"Plato's Retreat,\\"\\"Plato's Retreat\\" by Joe Thomas (1978), Discogs with lyrics referring to the club. The 2009 documentary American Swing relates the story of Plato's Retreat with archival footage and interviews. A scene in Spike Lee's film Summer of Sam takes place at Plato's Retreat.

Overview The player characters are humans abducted by alien slave traders. Together, with other extraterrestrial slaves, they turn on their captors and kill them during the fight, destroying the vital navigational records. Left with possession of one of the fastest and most powerful spaceships, the Anshani space tug Ardanna Nuu, they do not know how to reach their homeworlds, since they all come from non-spacefaring planets in the backwaters of the galaxy that do not turn up in other spacefarers' logs. Incursion is technically set in the same universe as Bureau 13: Stalking the Night Fantastic, but places the player characters adrift in a complex society, rife with politics and people after them for their ship.

Career Love Sculpture was founded in Cardiff in 1966 by former members of The Human Beans. The group disbanded in 1970, although Edmunds went on to enjoy solo success in the 1970s. Love Sculpture mostly performed blues standards, slightly revved- up, but still close to the originals. Their debut album, Blues Helping, included such songs as \\"Summertime\\" and \\"Wang Dang Doodle\\". They are best known for their 1968 novelty hit in the UK Singles Chart, a high speed cover version of the classical piece \\"Sabre Dance\\" by Aram Khachaturian, released on the Parlophone label (R 5744), which reached No. 5 in the UK Singles Chart in December 1968. The recording was inspired by Keith Emerson's classical rearrangements.Rick Clark, liner notes from The Dave Edmunds Anthology (1968‚Äì90), Rhino Records R2 71191 (1993) \\"Sabre Dance\\" became a hit after receiving air play by British DJ John Peel, who was so impressed that he played it twice in one programme. In December 1968, the UK music magazine, NME, reported that Love Sculpture had signed a US recording contract with London Records, guaranteeing ¬£250,000. The band were also given an invitation to perform \\"Sabre Dance\\" live, on the German Beat-Club television programme of Radio Bremen, being broadcast in monochrome at that time. This was followed by a second album Forms and Feelings, with songs including: \\"In The Land of the Few\\", \\"Farandole\\", \\"People People\\", \\"Seagull (West Coast Oil Tragedy)\\", written by Paul Korda, and the equally fast cover of Chuck Berry's \\"You Can't Catch Me\\". The US version of the album also featured a recording of \\"Mars\\" from Gustav Holst's The Planets, but Holst's estate refused to license the tune for the UK version. They recorded three times for BBC Radio 1's John Peel sessions in 1968 (twice) and 1969. In 1970 Mickey Gee joined the band as a second guitarist, and Terry Williams replaced Rob Jones on drums.Mannerisms II ‚Äì Man and Roots/Offshoots by Michael Mycock, published June 1995, page 108 Love Sculpture split up after a US tour, having recorded two albums.

Background  Mad Professor was contacted by Massive Attack after Protection was released to remix a song for a single. After the single was remixed, the band asked Mad Professor to listen to more of the album to explore the possibility of further remixes. The project then became a track by track remix of almost the entire album. Mad Professor heavily edited the original material to form a slow, pulsating mix in which the beat is emphasised, reverb is extensively used and the occasional vocals (many of the tracks are almost entirely instrumental) fade in-and-out in typical dub fashion.  Critical reception  According to music journalist Robert Christgau, No Protection was the most ballyhooed album during dub music's revival in the mid-1990s. In his review for The Village Voice, he found the music well defined and textured: \\"It also sustains a convincing gravity‚Äîa sense that all these whooshings and clangings and suckings and scrapings and boomings and snatches of tune relate to each other and the rest of the physical universe.\\" Track listing #\\"Radiation Ruling the Nation\\" (based on \\"Protection\\") ‚Äì 8:35 #\\"Bumper Ball Dub\\" (based on \\"Karmacoma\\") ‚Äì 5:59 #\\"Trinity Dub\\" (based on \\"Three\\") ‚Äì 4:22 #\\"Cool Monsoon\\" (based on \\"Weather Storm\\") ‚Äì 7:10 #\\"Eternal Feedback\\" (based on \\"Sly\\") ‚Äì 6:26 #\\"Moving Dub\\" (based on \\"Better Things\\") ‚Äì 5:57 #\\"I Spy\\" (based on \\"Spying Glass\\") ‚Äì 5:07 #\\"Backward Sucking\\" (based on \\"Heat Miser\\") ‚Äì 6:17 ReferencesExternal links *Mad Professor MySpace page *Massive Attack home page Category:Massive Attack albums Category:Albums produced by Nellee Hooper Category:1995 remix albums ","title":"No Protection (Massive Attack album)"},{"id":"1877961","text":"Pomponesco (Casalasco-Viadanese: ) is a comune in the Italian Province of Mantua.

After graduating in 1953, Bizzarrini eventually joined Alfa Romeo as a test driver. He gained a reputation for identifying and solving problems and was head hunted by Ferrari in 1957. Bizzarrini's responsibility increased until he became sports car development chief at Ferrari in the late 1950s, working on such notable projects as the Ferrari 250 GTO. He split from the company as part of the 'Great Walkout' in 1961, worked first with ATS, and then in 1962 started his own company, Societ√† Autostar, whose name was changed to Bizzarrini in 1964. In addition to producing the exotic Bizzarrini 5300 GT, Bizzarrini also worked for other makers including Iso, Lamborghini, and Alfa Romeo. Several concept cars in the 2000s bear his name.  Early life  Bizzarrini was the son of a rich landowner from Livorno. His grandfather, also named Giotto Bizzarrini, was a biologist who had worked with Guglielmo Marconi on his inventions, especially the radio, following which one of the Livorno Library sections was named The Bizzarrini Library. Bizzarrini received an engineering degree from the University of Pisa in 1953. His design thesis in his senior year was a complete redesign of a used Fiat Topolino, in which he modified the engine for increased power and relocated it in the chassis for improved handling. Alfa Romeo After graduation, he taught briefly before joining Alfa Romeo's 'Servizio Esperimenze Principali' unit under Ing. Nicolis in August 1954. He was assigned to the development of the Alfa Romeo Giulietta chassis, which was disappointing, as he aspired to become a powerplant engineer. He was later able to move to the Experimental Department, receiving on-the-job training to become a test driver. In his words: \\"I became a test driver who coincidentally was also an engineer, with mathematical principles. I always needed to know why something fails, so I can invent a solution.\\"  Ferrari  Bizzarrini left Alfa Romeo in 1957 and went to Ferrari when that company needed a test driver. He was quickly promoted to controller of experimental, Sports and GT car development. He worked for five years at Ferrari as chief engineer. He also worked as a developer, designer, and skilled test driver. The 250 GT 2+2/GTE, the 3 litre Testa Rossa V12 engine, the 250 TR Testa Rossa, and the 250GT SWB (Short Wheelsbase Berlinetta or Berlinetta Passo Corto) were influenced by his ideas and technical solutions. For one of the most successful Ferrari racing series, the 250, Bizzarrini worked hard to develop the chassis, engines, and advanced dynamic solutions.  Ferrari 250 GTO  His masterpiece at Ferrari was the 1962 250 GTO. He became involved with the project in 1960. Ferrari wanted a GT racer with better aerodynamics than the previous 250 GT SWB. The SWB was a great racer but had considerable aerodynamic drag. Jaguar had just launched the E-Type and Ferrari needed a top contender in the tracks. Enzo Ferrari wanted to ensure that his racing team did not suffer another loss as it had in the 1959 LeMans race. 1959 GT Boano Tests started secretly with a 250 GT, bodied by Mario Boano, with chassis number #2643GT which was Bizzarrini's personal car. This car was developed and was used as a test mule for technical solutions later seen in the GTO. This car was known as the Bizzarrini Ugly Duck. (He said, \\"We dubbed the car Il Mostro.\\" 'The Monster') Experiments with the SWB chassis indicated considerable speed loss due to aerodynamic drag, so Bizzarrini reduced the frontal area and increased the bonnet length, to reduce both drag and tendency to front lift at high speeds. Bizzarrini moved the engine well back into the chassis and lowered it (by using a dry sump lubrication system) to improve weight distribution and handling. The result was the 250 GTO.  Count Volpi, the specials and ATS  ATS 2500 GT In 1961, Bizzarrini was one of the \\"famous five\\" engineers who left Ferrari in the so-called \\"Ferrari night of the Long Knives\\", provoked by a reorganisation of the engineering staff. With other ex- Ferrari engineers (including Carlo Chiti) Bizzarrini founded the Automobili Turismo e Sport (ATS) company to build a Formula 1 single seater and a GT sports car, the ATS Serenissima. In 1962, Bizzarrini was hired by Count Giovanni Volpi, owner of the Scuderia Serenissima Republica di Venezia, to upgrade a Ferrari 250 GT SWB (chassis number 2819GT) to GTO specification. Ferrari was upset with Volpi and refused to sell him a GTO, so they had to acquire and modify a used vehicle. Ferrari 250GT Drogo #2819GT \\"Breadvan\\" Bizzarrini applied all the ideas from the GTO and developed with Piero Drogo of Carrozzeria Sports Cars in the Modena works an aerodynamically advanced body, even lower than the GTO, with the roof line dramatically extended to the rear end, then abruptly truncated following the Kamm aerodynamic theory. The car was completed in just 14 days. The mechanicals were extensively reformed and the engine set well back into the chassis and lowered, using dry-sump lubrication. This car, chassis number #2819GT was called the Ferrari Breadvan, and is currently raced in vintage Sport Car events. The car was raced at the time with some success, with Carlo Abate and other drivers at the wheel, but could not beat the GTOs because it still had the four-speed gearbox. At least another two 250GT series cars were developed by Bizzarrini, Piero Drogo and Neri and Bonacini to GTO specifications and received distinctive bodies with similar advanced shapes. In 1962 Bizzarrini founded Societ√† Autostar, an engineering firm through which he would bid for freelance engineering projects.  Lamborghini engine  Bizzarrini-designed Lamborghini V12 in Miura engine bay Ferruccio Lamborghini commissioned Societ√† Autostar to design an engine for his automaking firm, Lamborghini's, new GT cars. The Lamborghini V12 was first manufactured for use in the 350GT in 1964. Variations of the basic design were used in every V-12 Lamborghini until 2010. Originally displacing in the 350GT, it had been increased in displacement to in the Murci√©lago SV.  Iso Autoveicoli S.p.A.=Iso Grifo Iso Grifo Societ√† Autostar developed cars for Iso Autoveicoli S.p.A. including the Iso Rivolta IR 300 and the Iso Grifo. A dispute between Bizzarrini and Iso ended their collaboration, and led to Societ√† Autostar building variants of the Iso Grifo under the Bizzarrini marque. This led Bizzarrini to change the name of Societ√† Autostar first, in 1964, to Societ√† Prototipi Bizzarrini and then in 1966 to Bizzarrini SpA. Bizzarrini SpA=5300 GT Strada Bizzarrini 5300 GT Strada Bizzarrini SpA is best known for the Bizzarrini 5300 GT Strada, produced between 1965-1968. This car had styling from Giorgetto Giugiaro when he was working for Bertone. Giugiaro's Italdesign was founded on February 13, 1968 with a forty day target to build their first design based on the Bizzarrini Grifo racing car with a deadline date for the Turin Motor Show in April. Giugiaro's Manta prototype caused a sensation and successfully launched the company.https://www.italdesign.it/project/manta/ Bizzarrini SpA was declared bankrupt in 1969, which ended Bizzarrini's days as an automobile manufacturer. After Bizzarrini SpA, Giotto Bizzarrini also developed advanced designs for other companies, including American Motors for which he built prototypes for the AMX/3 project, and as style and technical consultant for GM in Europe and USA, top Japanese motorcycle marques and well-known designer marques such as Pininfarina.  Bizzarrini today  Giotto Bizzarrini teaches and works with Rome University, developing advanced projects and designing, building and developing his own sport cars. He is often quoted as saying: \\"I'm not a car designer, I am a worker\\". On October 23, 2012, during the inauguration of the University of Florence's new Design Campus in Calenzano, Professor Giotto Bizzarrini was given the Honoris Causa Degree in Industrial Design.http://mycarquest.com/2012/10/giotto-bizzarrini-receives-an-honorary- doctorate-from-the-university-of-florence-italy.html  References  Category:1926 births Category:Living people Category:People from Livorno Category:Italian engineers Category:Ferrari people Category:Alfa Romeo people Category:Bizzarrini Category:Formula One people Category:Formula One designers Category:Italian motorsport people ","title":"Giotto Bizzarrini"},{"id":"1877983","text":"The Hook Peninsula is a peninsula in County Wexford, Ireland.

The National Jewish Welfare Board (JWB) was formed on April 9, 1917, three days after the United States declared war on Germany, in order to support Jewish soldiers in the U.S. military during World War I. The impetus for creating the organization stemmed from Secretary of War, Newton Baker and Secretary of Navy, Josephus Daniels. The organization was also charged with recruiting and training rabbis for military service, as well as providing support materials to these newly commissioned chaplains. The JWB also maintained oversight of Jewish chapel facilities at military installations. Postcard, 1919 In 1921, several organizations merged with the JWB to become a national association of Jewish community centers around the country in order to integrate social activities, education, and active recreation. These merged organizations included the YWHA, YMHA, and the National Council of Young Men's Hebrew and Kindred Association. In 1941, in a response to a mandate from President Franklin D. Roosevelt, six private organizations - the YMCA, YWCA, the National Jewish Welfare Board, the Traveler's Aid Association and the Salvation Army were challenged to handle the on-leave morale and recreational needs for members of the Armed Forces. The six organizations pooled their resources and the United Service Organizations, which quickly became known as the USO, was incorporated in New York on February 4, 1941.

Djemal was the Minister of the Navy. Biography governor of Adana. Ahmed Djemal was born in Mytilene, Lesbos, to Mehmet Nesip Bey, a military pharmacist. Destined for the army, Djemal graduated from Kuleli Military High School in 1890. He went on to the Military Academy (Mektebi Harbiyeyi ≈ûahane), the staff college in Istanbul, in 1893. He was posted to serve with the 1st Department of the Imperial General Staff (Seraskerlik Erk√¢nƒ± Harbiye), and then he worked at the Kirkkilise Fortification Construction Department bound to Second Army. Djemal was assigned to the II Corps in 1896; being appointed two years later, the staff commander of Novice Division, stationed on the Salonica frontier. Meanwhile, he began to sympathize with the reforms of Committee of Union and Progress (CUP) on military issues. It was in 1905 that Djemal was promoted to major and designated Inspector of Roumelia Railways. The following year he signalled his democratic credentials and joined the Ottoman Liberty Society. He became influential in the department of military issues of the Committee of Union and Progress. He became a member of the Board of the III Corps in 1907. Here, he worked with future Turkish statesmen Major Fethi (Okyar) and Mustafa Kemal (Atat√ºrk), although Atat√ºrk soon developed a rivalry with Djemal Pasha and his colleagues over their policies after they seized power in 1913. Between 1908 and 1918, Djemal was one of the most important leaders of the Ottoman government. Following the Young Turk Revolution in 1908 he became a member of the central committee (Merkezi Umum-i) of the CUP and later was deployed as a Kaymakam to √úsk√ºdar, Constantinople and in 1909 he was assigned as a WƒÅli to the Adana Vilayet. Balkan Wars In 1911, Djemal was appointed Governor of Baghdad. He resigned to rejoin the army in the Balkan Wars on the Salonica front line, attempting to bolster Turkey's European possessions from encroachment. In October 1912, he was promoted to colonel. At the end of the First Balkan War, he played an important role in the propaganda drawn up by the CUP against negotiations with the victorious European countries. He tried to resolve the problems that occurred in Constantinople after the Bab-ƒ± Ali Attack (Coup of 1913). Djemal played a significant role in the Second Balkan War, and with the revolution of the CUP on 23 January 1913, he became the commander of Constantinople and was appointed Minister of Public Works. He was assigned the military command in the Constantinople Vilayet by Grand Visier Mahmud Sevket Pasha and by December 1913 he was given the title Pasha. In February 1914 he was promoted to Minister of the Ottoman Navy.Kurt, √úmit (2019), p.222 World War I and Armenian Genocide Ahmed Djemal on the shore of the Dead Sea in 1915. When Europe was divided into two blocs before the First World War, he supported an alliance with France. He went to France to negotiate an alliance with the French, but failed and then sided with Enver and Talaat, who favoured the German side. Djemal, along with Enver and Talaat, took control of the Ottoman government in 1913. The Three Pashas effectively ruled the Ottoman Empire for the duration of World War I and were the three main perpetrators of the Armenian, Greek, and Assyrian genocides. Djemal was one of the designers of the government's internal and foreign policies, nearly all of which proved disastrous for the Empire. For example, his policy to oppose the powers in Eastern Europe caused a dramatic escalation and the 'balkanisation' of the Slavic republics. Multiple contradictory allegiances in a redundant balance-of-powers strategy added immense complexity and immeasurable difficulties to Ottoman logistics across thousands of miles of desert. After the Ottoman Empire declared war on the Allies in World War I, Enver Pasha nominated Djemal Pasha to lead the Ottoman army against British forces in Egypt, and Djemal accepted the position. In late 1914, he was assigned with the Governorship and the military command for the southern provinces of the Ottoman Empire. Previously snubbed by the Allies, Djemal switched his attention to an alliance with the Central Powers, although he had at first been opposed to a full alliance with Germany. Nevertheless, he agreed in early October 1914 to use his ministerial powers to authorise Admiral Souchon to launch a pre-emptive strike in the Black Sea, which led to Russia, Britain and France declaring war on the Ottoman Empire a few days later.  Governor of Greater Syria  Djemal Pasha with Iraqi tribal leaders, celebrating the completion of the al-Hindya dam on the Euphrates river near al-Hilla, south of Baghdad. Djemal Pasha was appointed with full powers in military and civilian affairs as Governor of Syria in 1915. A provisional law granted him emergency powers in May of that year. All cabinet decrees from Constantinople concerning Syria became subject to his approval. His offensives on both his first and second attacks on the Suez Canal failed. Coupled with the wartime exigencies and natural disasters that afflicted the region during these years, this alienated the population from the Ottoman government, and led to the Arab Revolt. In the meantime, the Ottoman army usually commanded by Colonel Kress von Kressenstein pushed towards and occupied Sinai. The two men had a thinly disguised contempt for each other, which weakened the command.Djemal, Memories; Kress, Zwischen Kaukasus und Sinai; RUSI journal 6, p.503-13; Grainger, Battle for Palestine, p.17 He was known among the local Arab inhabitants as al-Saffah, \\"the Blood Shedder\\", being responsible for the hanging of many Lebanese, Syrian Shi'a Muslims and Christians wrongly accused of treason on 6 May 1916 in Damascus and Beirut.Cleveland, William: A History of the Modern Middle East. Boulder: Westview Press, 2004. \\"World War I and the End of the Ottoman Order\\", 146‚Äì167. In his political memoirs, the leader of the \\"Beirut Reform Movement\\" Salim Ali Salam recalls the following: > Jamal Pasha resumed his campaign of vengeance; he began to imprison most > Arab personalities, charging them with treason against the State. His real > intent was to cut off the thoughtful heads, so that, as he put it, the Arabs > would never again emerge as a force, and no one would be left to claim for > them their rights ‚Ä¶ After returning to Beirut [from Istanbul], I was > summoned ‚Ä¶ to Damascus to greet Jamal Pasha ‚Ä¶ I took the train ‚Ä¶ and upon > reaching Aley we found that the whole train was reserved for the prisoners > there to take them to Damascus ‚Ä¶ When I saw them, I realized that they were > taking them to Damascus to put them to death. So ‚Ä¶ I said to myself: how > shall I be able to meet with this butcher on the day on which he will be > slaughtering the notables of the country? And how will I be able to converse > with him? ‚Ä¶ Upon arriving in Damascus, I tried hard to see him that same > evening, before anything happened, but was not successful.

Chevalier, Les Arabes par leurs archives: XVIe-XXe siecles. > Paris: Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique. During 1915-1916, Djemal had 34 political opponents executed as martyrs.Elie Kedourie, England and the Middle East, pp.62-4 At the end of 1915, Djemal with viceregal powers is said to have started secret negotiations with the Allies for ending the war; he proposed to take over the Ottoman administration himself as an independent King of Syria. These secret negotiations came to nothing, in part because the Allies reportedly could not agree on the future territory of the Ottoman Empire; France objected strongly, and Britain was unwilling to fund the Imperial operations.Fromkin, David, A Peace to End All Peace: The Fall of the Ottoman Empire and the Creation of the Modern Middle East]. New York: Avon Books, 1989, p. 214. In a new interpretation, historian Sean McMeekin casts doubt on the tradition that Djemal made any such overtures to the Allies. The Pasha was an outspoken critic of the Allies, collaborated fully with the German army, and grew to hate the British Empire. His most successful military exploit was against the British Mesopotamian Expeditionary Force, which had arrived in early 1915 from India. 35,000 British troops marched north on Baghdad, hoping to take the citadel with relatively few casualties. Djemal Pasha was appointed to command and marshalled a vast army, ultimately led by General Halil Kut, which by the time of the siege of Kut al- Amara numbered 200,000 Turks and Arab auxiliaries. The British could only evacuate their wounded with Djemal's consent and attempted to send emissaries requesting permission to evacuate while the city was encircled on three sides. Djemal refused to compromise his advantageous position, and strafed enemy attempts by the Tigris Corps to take relief boats up river. They had underestimated Djemal's considerable administrative capabilities and will to resist the Allied armies. The Ottoman troops fought hard at the Battle of Ctesiphon, but the subsequent fate of POWs and civilians later enhanced Djemal Pasha's wartime reputation as a capricious and cruel general. Nonetheless, the successes impressed T. E. Lawrence to write a significant account of their diplomatic encounters when finally Kut fell in April 1916, which provides for \\"a colourful character\\".Lawrence, Seven Pillars of Wisdom The ever-present threat of Arab Revolt fomented by British intelligence was rising throughout 1916 and 1917. Djemal instituted strict control over Syria Province against Syrian opponents. Djemal's forces also fought against the Arab nationalists and Syrian nationalists from 1916 onwards. Ottoman authorities occupied the French consulates in Beirut and Damascus and confiscated French secret documents that revealed evidence about the activities and names of the Arab insurgents. Djemal used the information from these documents as well as from others belonging to the Decentralization Party. He believed that insurgency under French control was the main reason for his military failings. With the documents he gathered, Djemal moved against the insurgent forces which were led by Arab political and cultural leaders. This was followed by the military trials of the insurgents known as √Çliye Divan-ƒ± Harb-i √ñrfisi in which they were punished.  Commander of Fourth Army  Supreme Commander of the Fourth Army Djemal Pasha and his chief of staff Fuad Bey at a command post in southern Palestine in April 1917. Gaza's head of garrison, Major Tiller, had 7 infantry battalions, a cavalry squadron, and some camel troops. The British under Colonel Chetwode already had 2,000 troops in front of the city. Reluctantly, Djemal marched with the 33rd Division to relieve Gaza. Kressenstein was delighted to have repelled the British assault and wanted to mobilise aggressively by driving into Shellal, Wadi Ghazze, and Khan Yunis, but Djemal absolutely forbade it. The British had a whole division in retreat, so Djemal apprehended that a two-battalion sortie would have been annihilated.Grainger, p.35 One of Djemal's associates in Iraq was engineer Colonel Heinrich August Meissner who had built both the Hejaz and Baghdad railways and who was employed on an ambitious project to construct a railway to the Suez canal at Bir Gifgafa. By October 1915, the Central Powers had already built 100 miles of track as far as the oasis of Beersheba. Djemal insisted that an extended railway would be needed to attack British Egypt. Djemal was completely committed to the Turko-German military machine, and Britain would not relinquish its ambitions to control Syria.Fromkin, A Peace to End All Peace, p.214-15; P G Weber, Eagles on the Crescent, pp.107 and 153-4; Grainger, p.69-70 Kemal and Djemal became increasingly sceptical of German capabilities, but Djemal was not yet prepared to openly back the German allies. He insisted on the possibility of a planned allied assault behind the Yƒ±ldƒ±rƒ±m Army, as the Seventh Army gathered at the Turco-German Aleppo Conference.Djemal, pp.183-4 In the shake-up that followed, Djemal was demoted to a command of the Fourth Army under General Erich von Falkenhayn. They now adopted a plan similar to the Kress Plan for Gaza and sent the Yƒ±ldƒ±rƒ±m Army to Baghdad. It was not until October 1917 that the Seventh Army could march south to face the growing threat from Allenby, hampered by the limitations of the single-gauge railway, which was built away from the coastline to avoid Royal Navy salvos. On 7 November, the British captured Gaza, but Djemal had long since been forced to evacuate. Although chased, he managed to retreat at speed.Official History, 2.1.75; Grainger, p.149 In December, the Turks were driven out of Jaffa, Djemal's army still in retreat, and the city fell without a fight. Falkenhayn had ordered an evacuation on 14th, and the enemy had begun to enter the same day.Grainger, p.173-5 But now the Turkish Eighth formed a much stronger line of entrenchment; Djemal's organized defence of Gaza had been amply anticipated by the British. His army delayed them further at the vital Junction railway station. But the British were probably unaware of its importance. The fighting in the hills was all but over by 1 December. On 6 December, Djemal Pasha was in Beirut to make a speech publicizing the allied deal to 'carve up' Syria-Palestine into partitioned spheres of influence in the Sykes-Picot agreement.Kedourie, The Middle East, p.Grainger, p.202 At the end of 1917, Djemal ruled from his post in Damascus as a near-independent ruler of his portion of the Empire. But he had resigned from the 4th Army and returned to Istanbul. On 9 April and then 19 April 1918, Djemal ordered the evacuation of civilians from Jaffa and Jerusalem. The Germans were furious and rescinded the order, revealing the chaos in the Ottoman Empire. Djemal's ambiguous attitude to the subject populations played into the hands of British rule. The Turkish line was solidified in readiness for the final onslaught at Nebi Samwell and Nahr-el-Auja. To the south of Nebi were the defences of Beit Iksa; the Heart and Liver Redoubts before Lifa; and Deir Yassin, two systems behind Ain Karim. In all, there were 4 miles of fortifications.Grainger, p.202-3 Parliament Naval Minister. In the last congress of Committee of Union and Progress held in 1917, Djemal was elected to the Board of Central Administration. With the defeat of the empire in October 1918 and the resignation of Talaat Pasha‚Äôs cabinet on 2 November 1918, Djemal fled with seven other leaders of the CUP to Germany, and then Switzerland. Military trial and assassination A military court in Turkey accused Djemal of persecuting Arab subjects of the Empire and sentenced him to death in absentia. Later in 1920, Djemal went to Central Asia, where he worked on modernising the Afghan army.Adamec, Ludwig W. (1974). Afghanistan's Foreign Affairs to the Mid-Twentieth Century: Relations with the USSR, Germany, and Britain. Tucson, AZ: University of Arizona Press. p. 70. . Due to the success of the Bolshevik Revolution, Djemal travelled to Tiflis to act as a military liaison officer to negotiate over Afghanistan with the Soviets. Together with his secretary, he was assassinated on 21 July 1922 by Stepan Dzaghigian, Artashes Gevorgyan, and Petros Ter Poghosyan, as part of Operation Nemesis, in retribution for his role in the Armenian Genocide and the First World War. Djemal's remains were brought to Erzurum and buried there.  Family  His grandson Hasan Cemal is a well-known columnist, journalist and writer in Turkey.

Also see Definition of international law Sources of international law include treaties, international customs, general widely recognized principles of law, the decisions of national and lower courts, and scholarly writings. They are the materials and processes out of which the rules and principles regulating the international community are developed. They have been influenced by a range of political and legal theories.  Modern views  Article 38 (1) of the Statute of the International Court of Justice is generally recognized as a definitive statement of the sources of international law. It requires the Court to apply, among other things, (a) international conventions, whether general or particular, establishing rules expressly recognized by the contesting states; (b) international custom, as evidence of a general practice accepted as law; (c) the general principles of law recognized by civilized nations; (d) subject to the provisions of Article 59, judicial decisions and the teachings of the most highly qualified publicists of the various nations, as subsidiary means for the determination of rules of law.  Historic considerations and development  During the 19th century, it was recognized by legal positivists that a sovereign could limit its authority to act by consenting to an agreement according to the principle pacta sunt servanda. This consensual view of international law was reflected in the 1920 Statute of the Permanent Court of International Justice, and was later preserved in Article 38(1) of the 1946 Statute of the International Court of Justice.Statute of the International Court of Justice.  Hierarchy  On the question of preference between sources of international law, rules established by treaty will take preference if such an instrument exists. It is also argued however that international treaties and international custom are sources of international law of equal validity; this is that new custom may supersede older treaties and new treaties may override older custom. Also, jus cogens (peremptory norm) is a custom, not a treaty. Certainly, judicial decisions and juristic writings are regarded as auxiliary sources of international law, whereas it is unclear whether the general principles of law recognized by 'civilized nations' should be recognized as a principal or auxiliary source of international law. Nevertheless, treaty, custom, and general principles of law are generally recognized as primary sources of international law.  Treaties as law  Treaties and conventions are the persuasive source of international law and are considered \\"hard law.\\" Treaties can play the role of contracts between two or more parties, such as an extradition treaty or a defense pact. Treaties can also be legislation to regulate a particular aspect of international relations or form the constitutions of international organizations. Whether or not all treaties can be regarded as sources of law, they are sources of obligation for the parties to them. Article 38(1)(a) of the ICJ, which uses the term \\"international conventions\\", concentrates upon treaties as a source of contractual obligation but also acknowledges the possibility of a state expressly accepting the obligations of a treaty to which it is not formally a party. For a treaty-based rule to be a source of law, rather than simply a source of obligation, it must either be capable of affecting non-parties or have consequences for parties more extensive than those specifically imposed by the treaty itself. Thus, the procedures or methods by treaties become legally binding are formal source of law which is a process by a legal rule comes into existence: it is law creating.Martin Dixon, Textbook on International Law (Oxford University Press, 7th ed 2013) 24  Treaties as custom  Some treaties are the result of codifying existing customary law, such as laws governing the global commons, and jus ad bellum. While the purpose is to establish a code of general application, its effectiveness depends upon the number of states that ratify or accede to the particular convention. Relatively few such instruments have a sufficient number of parties to be regarded as international law in their own right. The most obvious example is the 1949 Geneva Conventions for the Protection of War Victims. Most multi-lateral treaties fall short of achieving such a near- universal degree of formal acceptance and are dependent upon their provisions being regarded as representing customary international law and, by this indirect route, as binding upon non-parties. This outcome is possible in a number of ways: * When the treaty rule reproduces an existing rule of customary law, the rule will be clarified in terms of the treaty provision. A notable example is the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties 1969, which was considered by the ICJ to be law even before it had been brought into force.Legal Consequences for States of the Continued Presence of South Africa in Namibia (South-West Africa) notwithstanding Security Council Resolution 276 (1970) (Advisory Opinion) [1971] ICJ Reports 16 at 47. * When a customary rule is in the process of development, its incorporation in a multilateral treaty may have the effect of consolidating or crystallizing the law in the form of that rule. It is not always easy to identify when this occurs. Where the practice is less developed, the treaty provision may not be enough to crystallize the rule as part of customary international law.North Sea Continental Shelf cases, note 6 at 38. * Even if the rule is new, the drafting of the treaty provision may be the impetus for its adoption in the practice of states, and it is the subsequent acceptance of the rule by states that renders it effective as part of customary law.North Sea Continental Shelf cases, note 6 at 41. See also Trial of the Major War Criminals before the International Military Tribunal, Vol. 1, Judgment, 171 at 253‚Äì4. If a broad definition is adopted of state practice, the making of a treaty would fall within the definition. Alternatively, it is possible to regard the treaty as the final act of state practice required to establish the rule in question, or as the necessary articulation of the rule to give it the opinion juries of customary international law. * Convention-based \\"instant custom\\" has been identified by the ICJ on several occasions as representing customary law without explanation of whether the provision in question was supported by state practice. This has happened with respect to a number of provisions of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties 1969. If \\"instant custom\\" is valid as law, it could deny to third parties the normal consequences of non-accession to the  The United Nations Charter  Pursuant to Chapter XVI, Article 103 of the United Nations Charter, the obligations under the United Nations Charter overrides the terms of any other treaty. Meanwhile, its Preamble affirms establishment of the obligations out of treaties and source of international law.  International custom  Article 38(1)(b) of the ICJ Statute refers to \\"international custom\\" as a source of international law, specifically emphasizing the two requirements of state practice plus acceptance of the practice as obligatory or opinio juris sive necessitatis (usually abbreviated as opinio juris). Derived from the consistent practice of (originally) Western states accompanied by opinio juris (the conviction of States that the consistent practice is required by a legal obligation), customary international law is differentiated from acts of comity (mutual recognition of government acts) by the presence of opinio juris (although in some instances, acts of comity have developed into customary international law, i.e. diplomatic immunity). Treaties have gradually displaced much customary international law. This development is similar to the replacement of customary or common law by codified law in municipal legal settings, but customary international law continues to play a significant role in international law.  State practice  When examining state practice to determine relevant rules of international law, it is necessary to take into account every activity of the organs and officials of states that relate to that purpose. There has been continuing debate over where a distinction should be drawn as to the weight that should be attributed to what states do, rather than what they say represents the law. In its most extreme form, this would involve rejecting what states say as practice and relegating it to the status of evidence of opinio juris.D'Amato, A., The Concept of Custom in International Law (Cornell University Press: Ithaca, New York, 1971) at 88. A more moderate version would evaluate what a state says by reference to the occasion on which the statement was made.Thirlway, H., International Customary Law and its Codification (A. W. Sijthoff: Leiden, 1972) at 58. It is only relatively powerful countries with extensive international contacts and interests that have regular opportunities of contributing by deed to the practice of international law. The principal means of contribution to state practice for the majority of states will be at meetings of international organizations, particularly the UN General Assembly, by voting and otherwise expressing their view on matters under consideration. Moreover, there are circumstances in which what states say may be the only evidence of their view as to what conduct is required in a particular situation.See Case Concerning Military and Paramilitary Activities in and against Nicaragua (Nicaragua v United States of America) (Merits) [1986] ICJ Reports 14. The notion of practice establishing a customary rule implies that the practice is followed regularly, or that such state practice must be \\"common, consistent and concordant\\".Fisheries Jurisdiction Case (United Kingdom v Iceland) (Merits) [1974] ICJ Reports 3 at 50. Given the size of the international community, the practice does not have to encompass all states or be completely uniform. There has to be a sufficient degree of participation, especially on the part of states whose interests are likely to be most affected,North Sea Continental Shelf Cases (Federal Republic of Germany v Denmark; Federal Republic of Germany v Netherlands) [1969] ICJ Reports 4 at 42. and an absence of substantial dissent.Nicaragua case (Merits), note 4 at 98. There have been a number of occasions on which the ICJ has rejected claims that a customary rule existed because of a lack of consistency in the practice brought to its attention.Asylum Case (Colombia v Peru) [1950] ICJ Rep 266 at 277; Advisory Opinion on the Legality of the Threat or Use by a State of Nuclear Weapons in Armed Conflict [1996] ICJ Reports 226. Within the context of a specific dispute, however, it is not necessary to establish the generality of practice. A rule may apply if a state has accepted the rule as applicable to it individually, or because the two states belong to a group of states between which the rule applies.Case Concerning Right of Passage over Indian Territory (Portugal v India) (Merits) [1960] ICJ Reports 6 at 39; Asylum case, note 8 at 276. A dissenting state is entitled to deny the opposability of a rule in question if it can demonstrate its persistent objection to that rule,North Sea Continental Shelf cases, note 6 at 229, 232 per Judge Lachs. either as a member of a regional groupAsylum case, note 8 at 277‚Äì8. or by virtue of its membership of the international community.Fisheries Case (United Kingdom v Norway) (Judgment) [1951] ICJ Reports 116, at 131. It is not easy for a single state to maintain its dissent. Also, rules of the jus cogens have a universal character and apply to all states, irrespective of their wishes.See North Sea Continental Shelf cases, note 6 at 229 per Judge Lachs. Demand for rules that are responsive to increasingly rapid changes has led to the suggestion that there can be, in appropriate circumstances, such a concept as \\"instant custom\\". Even within traditional doctrine, the ICJ has recognized that passage of a short period of time is not necessarily a bar to the formation of a new rule.North Sea Continental Shelf cases, note 6 at 43. Because of this, the question is sometimes raised as to whether the word \\"custom\\" is suitable to a process that could occur with great rapidity.  Practice by international organizations  It may be argued that the practice of international organizations, most notably that of the United Nations, as it appears in the resolutions of the Security Council and the General Assembly, are an additional source of international law, even though it is not mentioned as such in Article 38(1) of the 1946 Statute of the International Court of Justice. Article 38(1) is closely based on the corresponding provision of the 1920 Statute of the Permanent Court of International Justice, thus predating the role that international organizations have come to play in the international plane. That is, the provision of Article 38(1) may be regarded as 'dated, and this can most vividly be seen in the mention made of 'civilized nations', a mentioning that appears all the more quaint after the decolonization process that took place in the early 1960s and the participation of nearly all nations of the world in the United Nations.  Opinio juris  A wealth of state practice does not usually carry with it a presumption that opinio juris exists. ‚ÄúNot only must the acts concerned amount to a settled practice, but they must also be such, or be carried out in such a way, as to be evidence of a belief that this practice is rendered obligatory by the existence of a rule of law requiring it.‚ÄùSee North Sea Continental Shelf cases, note 6 at 44. In cases where practice (of which evidence is given) comprises abstentions from acting, consistency of conduct might not establish the existence of a rule of customary international law. The fact that no nuclear weapons have been used since 1945, for example, does not render their use illegal on the basis of a customary obligation because the necessary opinio juris was lacking.Legality of Nuclear Weapons Advisory Opinion (GA), note 8. Although the ICJ has frequently referred to opinio juris as being an equal footing with state practice,Case Concerning the Continental Shelf (Libyan Arab Jamahiriya v Malta) (Judgment) [1985] ICJ Reports 13 at 29; Legality of Nuclear Weapons Advisory Opinion (GA), note 8 at 16. the role of the psychological element in the creation of customary law is uncertain.  Jus cogens  A peremptory norm or jus cogens (Latin for \\"compelling law\\" or \\"strong law\\") is a principle of international law considered so fundamental that it overrides all other sources of international law, including even the Charter of the United Nations. The principle of jus cogens is enshrined in Article 53 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties: :For the purposes of the present Convention, a peremptory norm of general international law is a norm accepted and recognised by the international community of States as a whole as a norm from which no derogation is permitted and which can be modified only by a subsequent norm of general international law having the same character.1155 UNTS 331. Rules of jus cogens generally require or forbid the state to do particular acts or respect certain rights. However, some define criminal offenses which the state must enforce against individuals. Generally included on lists of such norms are prohibitions of such crimes and internationally wrongful acts as waging aggressive war, war crimes, crimes against humanity, piracy, genocide, apartheid, slavery and torture. The evidence supporting the emergence of a rule of jus cogens will be essentially similar to that required to establish the creation of a new rule of customary international law. Indeed, jus cogens could be thought of as a special principle of custom with a superadded opinions juries. The European Court of Human Rights has stressed the international public policy aspect of the jus cogens.  General principles of law  The scope of general principles of law, to which Article 38(1) of the Statute of the ICJ refers, is unclear and controversial but may include such legal principles that are common to a large number of systems of municipal law. Given the limits of treaties or custom as sources of international law, Article 38(1) may be looked upon as a directive to the Court to fill any gap in the law and prevent a nonliquet by reference to the general principles. In earlier stages of the development of international law, rules were frequently drawn from municipal law. In the 19th century, legal positivists rejected the idea that international law could come from any source that did not involve state will or consent but were prepared to allow for the application of general principles of law, provided that they had in some way been accepted by states as part of the legal order. Thus Article 38(1)(c), for example, speaks of general principles \\"recognized\\" by states. An area that demonstrates the adoption of municipal approaches is the law applied to the relationship between international officials and their employing organizations,Amerasinghe, C., The Law of the International Civil Service, 2nd rev. ed, vol. 1 (Clarendon Press: Oxford, 1994) at 151‚Äì8. although today the principles are regarded as established international law. The significance of general principles has undoubtedly been lessened by the increased intensity of treaty and institutional relations between states. Nevertheless, the concepts of estoppel and equity have been employed in the adjudication of international disputes. For example, a state that has, by its conduct, encouraged another state to believe in the existence of a certain legal or factual situation, and to rely on that belief, may be estopped from asserting a contrary situation in its dealings.See North Sea Continental Shelf cases, note 6 at 26; Flegenheimer Claim 25 ILR 91; Case Concerning the Temple of Preah Vihear (Cambodia v Thailand) (Merits) [1962] ICJ Reports 6 at 32‚Äì3. The principle of good faith was said by the ICJ to be \\"[o]ne of the basic principles governing the creation and performance of legal obligations\\".Nuclear Tests Cases (Australia v France; New Zealand v France) [1974] ICJ Reports 253 at 268. Similarly, there have been frequent references to equity.River Meuse Case (Netherlands v Belgium) PCIJ Reports Series A/B No 70 76 at 76 per Judge Hudson. It is generally agreed that equity cannot be employed to subvert legal rules (that is, operate contra legem).Case Concerning the Frontier Dispute (Burkina Faso v Republic of Mali) (Judgment) [1986] ICJ Reports 554 at 567‚Äì8; North Sea Continental Shelf cases, note 6 at 46‚Äì50. This \\"equity as law\\" perception is reinforced by references to equitable principles in the text of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea 1982, though this may be little more than an admission as to the existence, and legitimation, of the discretion of the adjudicator. However, the principles of estoppel and equity in the international context do not retain all the connotations they do under common law. The reference to the principles as \\"general\\" signify that, if rules were to be adapted from municipal law, they should be at a sufficient level of generality to encompass similar rules existing in many municipal systems. Principles of municipal law should be regarded as sources of inspiration rather than as sources of rules of direct application.International Status of South-West Africa (Advisory Opinion) [1950] ICJ Reports 128 at 148.  Judicial decisions and juristic writings  According to Article 38(1)(d) of its Statute, the ICJ is also to apply \\"judicial decisions and the teachings of the most highly qualified publicists of the various nations, as subsidiary means for the determination of rules of law\\". It is difficult to tell what influence these materials have on the development of the law. Pleadings in cases before the ICJ are often replete with references to case law and to legal literature.  Judicial decisions  The decisions of international and municipal courts and the publications of academics can be referred to, not as a source of law as such, but as a means of recognizing the law established in other sources. In practice, the International Court of Justice does not refer to domestic decisions although it does invoke its previous case-law. There is no rule of stare decisis in international law. The decision of the Court has no binding force except between the parties and in respect of that particular case.Article 59 of the ICJ Statute Statute of the International Court of Justice. Nevertheless, often the Court would refer to its past decisions and advisory opinions to support its explanation of a present case. Often the International Court of Justice will consider General Assembly resolutions as indicative of customary international law.  Juristic writings  Article 38(1)(d) of the International Court of Justice Statute states that the 'teachings of the most highly qualified publicists of the various nations' are also among the 'subsidiary means for the determination of the rules of law'. The scholarly works of prominent jurists are not sources of international law but are essential in developing the rules that are sourced in treaties, custom and the general principles of law. This is accepted practice in the interpretation of international law and was utilized by the United States Supreme Court in The Paquete Habana case (175 US (1900) 677 at 700-1).

The village is surrounded by green belt land. Over the county border in Cheshire, Widnes town centre is to the south- southeast. History Historically a part of Lancashire, Cronton is an ancient village and was once a centre for the makers of watch parts and movements. There is an ancient cross, now no more than a column of stone on ruined steps. This was one of many stopping places on the way to the parish church at Farnworth. The five-holed stocks next to the war memorial in Coronation Gardens are almost unique to Cronton with few other specimens found anywhere. Many of the 19th Century residents of Cronton were farmers. There was a blacksmith in Cronton Lane (opposite what is now the Black Horse pub). Family names common in Cronton during the 19th Century census returns: Leather, Haughton, Pitt, Coughlin, Critchley, Dwerryhouse, Atherton, Hillyer, Glover and Lister. The Catholic Church, Holy Family, was opened at the start of the 20th Century. There is also Holy Family Primary school. Prior to this, many Cronton Catholics were carried to St Bartholomew's Church, Rainhill for burial. In the early twentieth century, Cronton was \\"a favourite resort for cyclists and picnic parties, both from Liverpool and Widnes, on account of a public recreation ground on Pexhill. This hill, rising to only above sea level, is covered with heather and gorse, and on the top are the Widnes Corporation reservoirs, formed in 1868\\".'Townships: Cronton', A History of the County of Lancaster: Volume 3 (1907), pp. 392-94. URL: http://www.british- history.ac.uk/report.asp?compid=41353; Today the Liverpool Astronomical Society has an Observatory - Leighton Observatory - at Pex Hill. It was formerly known as Pex Hill Observatory and Visitors' Centre. The village has grown since the 1950s but in recent years has slowed with very little new housing development as it is surrounded by Green Belt. The village has two primary schools and just over the border in Widnes is Riverside College (formerly Widnes sixth-form college and then renamed Widnes and Runcorn sixth- form college with the advent of another campus being added in Runcorn), and locally referred to as \\"Cronton College\\" as the site directly borders Cronton. Two pubs are located in the village, The Unicorn and The Dandelion Tavern (formerly The Black Horse Hotel. Cronton is the location of Pex Hill JFC which is a fast-growing junior football club that utilises the Holy Family Club as its social club. It is also the home of Cronton Villa F.C who play in the Warrington and District league. Nearby stood Cronton Colliery which ceased production in March 1984, shortly before the Great UK miners' strike (1984‚Äì1985). Although Cronton 'pit' was a twentieth century enterprise, the surrounding area had supported a coal mining industry throughout the previous century. It was in the 19th century that a large number of Welsh people moved nearby to work 'down the pit' and they brought their distinctive brand of Non- Conformist Christianity with them. There were once at least 31 non-conformist chapels within just three miles (5 km) of Cronton, including three Welsh chapels (Congregational, Methodist and Presbyterian) in Widnes, Welsh Calvinistic Methodists in Huyton Quarry, and a Welsh Methodist in Whiston.GENUKI; Methodism was especially strong in coal-mining communities and Cronton had its own Wesleyan Methodist chapel in Chapel Lane. This chapel still exists and now forms part of the Liverpool District (Widnes Circuit) of the Methodist Church. Cronton Colliery Cronton colliers mined the pit's first coal during the Great War in 1915. Cronton thrived and the pit was one of 65 Lancashire collieries at the time of nationalisation. Mainly because of the exhaustion of economically viable reserves, the number of Lancashire collieries had been reduced to 41 by 1962. Five years later this had fallen to 21. By the time Cronton colliery finally closed in 1984 it had been making heavy financial losses for many years and the remaining coal reserves were both limited and difficult to mine. Local coal miners were offered alternative jobs at one of the seven remaining Lancashire collieries. (The last Lancashire deep-pit to close was Parkside Colliery in 1993). The 43 hectare colliery site lay completely derelict for years until it was acquired by English Partnerships, the government's national regeneration agency, as part of the National Coalfield Programme. In 1995 the site was partially restored by removing both the colliery infrastructure and major earthworks, and then reclaiming colliery spoil by mixing it with paper mill crumb (provided by Brigewater newsprint mill in Ellesmere Port) and sewage cake to create soils for successful woodland planting. The colliery site's ownership was transferred to the Northwest Regional Development Agency in 1999 but it will pass the Land Reclamation Trust in the autumn of 2007. The site has a future as public access land, probably as a new country park. To help improve nutrient-poor topsoil conditions, which are currently hindering plant development, compost made from recycled garden waste will be added. The aim is to help improve local biodiversity; establish sustainable, low-maintenance native plant communities; and encourage natural wildlife habitats. Governance Since 1 April 1974, Cronton has been one of six civil parishes within the Metropolitan Borough of Knowsley, in the metropolitan county of Merseyside, and its boundaries fall within the Whiston South ward for election of Borough councillors. From 1894 until the local government reorganisation of 1974, Cronton was part of Whiston Rural District within the administrative county of Lancashire.Youngs, F., Local Administrative Units: Northern England (London: Royal Historical Society, 1991), p. 689; Before this Cronton was a township and civil parish, part of the Ecclesiastical Parish of Prescot in West Derby Hundred within the historic county boundaries of Lancashire. To this day the bordering town of Widnes recognises the village as part of its 'empire' which includes the village of Farnworth, though no other surrounding area does. Transport links Cronton village is on the A5080, which links Edge Hill in Liverpool to Penketh on the outskirts of Warrington. It lies from Junction 7 on the M62 motorway. Hough Green railway station, on the Liverpool to Warrington line, is away. There are also bus links between Liverpool city centre and Warrington.
