Upon finalization of the adoption, the original birth certificate is sealed and replaced with an amended birth certificate declaring the adoptee to be the child of his or her adoptive parents, \\"as if\\" born to them. Many states, provinces and countries adopted this practice in the early to mid-20th century with the aim of protecting the adopted person from the shame of an illegitimate birth. Sealed or closed birth records are generally associated with closed adoption. Open records is generally referred to as the practice of opening original birth records to adult adoptees, and should not be confused with open adoption, which can occur with or without sealed records, depending on the laws of the state or province in which it is carried out. Many nations have granted adult adoptees unrestricted access to their original birth certificates. Mike Leigh's Oscar- nominated film Secrets & Lies (1996) revolves around a British woman who accesses her original birth certificate. History=United States While Minnesota was the first state in 1917 to seal and make court adoption records unavailable to the public,Minnesota Statutes 1917 (Suppl.) section 7159, effective January 1, 1918. The court records, however, until 1945 remained available to the parties in interest and their attorneys. in 1935 California became the first state to seal and make an adoptee's original birth record unavailable except by court order.[Vital Statistics Registration Act, ch. 608, 1935, effective September 1, 1935, available at https://clerk.assembly.ca.gov/content/statutes-and-amendments-codes-1935, retrieved January 1, 2019] This act, however, also required the sealing of the original birth record of a child who was born illegitimate but who was later legitimated by affidavit or court order. Sealing birth records after an adoption or legitimation was intended to protect the child from any stigma associated with being born illegitimate. It was also intended to prevent a birth parent from interfering later with the adoptive family. After World War II, the laws in most states were changed to permanently seal adoptees' original birth certificates to all parties, including the adoptee when an adult. While Kansas and Alaska seal an adoptee's original birth certificates after an adoption, the original birth record in these two states has always been available upon request once the adoptee reaches 18 years of age.Kansas Stat. sec. 65-2423(a)(2017)Alaska Stat. sec. 18.50.500 (2017) Many states and provinces of the U.S. and Canada have recently begun return the right of adult adoptees to access their original birth certificates.Adoption Data from States Who Have Enacted Access from the American Adoption Congress Canada The history of sealed birth records in Canada mirrors that of the United States.

Built between 1904 and 1908 by the Pennsylvania Railroad (PRR) to allow its trains to reach Manhattan, they opened for passenger service in late 1910. History=Context The PRR had consolidated its control of railroads in New Jersey with the lease of United New Jersey Railroad and Canal Company in 1871, extending its network from Philadelphia northward to Jersey City. Crossing the Hudson River remained an obstacle; to the east, the Long Island Rail Road (LIRR) ended at the East River. In both situations, passengers had to transfer to ferries to Manhattan. This put the PRR at a disadvantage relative to its arch competitor, the New York Central Railroad, which already served Manhattan. After unsuccessfully trying to create a bridge over the Hudson River, the PRR and the LIRR developed several proposals for improved regional rail access in 1892 as part of the New York Tunnel Extension project. The proposals included new tunnels between Jersey City and Manhattan, and possibly one to Brooklyn; a new terminal in midtown Manhattan for both the PRR and LIRR, completion of the Hudson Tubes, and a bridge proposal. These proposals finally came to fruition at the turn of the century, when the PRR created subsidiaries to manage the project. The Pennsylvania, New Jersey and New York Railroad, incorporated on February 13, 1902, was to oversee construction of the North River Tunnels. The PNJ&NY; would also be in charge of the Meadows Division, which would handle the construction of the North River Tunnel approaches on the New Jersey side. The original proposal for the PRR and LIRR terminal in Midtown, published in June 1901, called for the construction of a bridge across Hudson River between 45th and 50th Streets in Manhattan, and two closely spaced terminals for the LIRR and PRR. This would allow passengers to travel between Long Island and New Jersey without changing trains. In December 1901, the plans were modified so that the PRR would construct the North River Tunnels under the Hudson River, instead of a bridge over it. The PRR cited costs and land value as a reason for constructing a tunnel rather than a bridge, since the cost of a tunnel would be one-third that of a bridge. The North River Tunnels themselves would consist of between two and four steel tubes with the diameter of . The New York Tunnel Extension quickly gained opposition from the New York City Board of Rapid Transit Commissioners, who objected that they would not have jurisdiction over the new tunnels, as well as from the Interborough Rapid Transit Company, which saw the New York Tunnel Extension as a potential competitor to its as-yet-incomplete rapid transit service. The project was approved by the New York City Board of Aldermen in December 1902, on a 41‚Äì36 vote. The North and East River Tunnels were to be built under the riverbed of their respective rivers. The PRR and LIRR lines would converge at New York Penn Station, an expansive Beaux-Arts edifice between 31st and 33rd Streets in Manhattan. The entire project was expected to cost over $100 million. Design and construction Construction of the northern tube under the Hudson River in 1905 Led by Chief Engineer Charles M. Jacobs, the tunnel design team began work in 1902. The contract for building the North River Tunnels was awarded to O'Rourke Engineering Construction Company in 1904. Originally, the tunnel would have comprised three tubes, but this was later downsized to two tubes. The first construction work comprised the digging of two shafts: one just east of 11th Avenue a few hundred yards east of the river's eastern shore; and a larger one in Weehawken, a few hundred yards west of the river's western shore. Construction on the Weehawken Shaft started in June 1903. It was completed in September 1904 as a concrete- walled rectangular pit, at the bottom and deep. When the shafts were complete, O'Rourke began work on the tunnels proper. The project was divided into three parts, each managed by a resident engineer: the \\"Terminal Station\\" in Manhattan; the \\"River Tunnels\\", east from the Weehawken Shaft and under the Hudson River; and the Bergen Hill tunnels, west from the Weehawken Shaft to the tunnel portals on the west side of the Palisades. The tunnels were built with drilling and blasting techniques and tunnelling shields, which were placed at three locations and driven towards each other. The shields proceeded west from Manhattan, east and west from Weehawken, and east from the Bergen portals. Under the river itself, the tunnels started in rock, using drill and blast, but the strata under the river was pure mud for a considerable depth. As a result, this part was driven under compressed air, using 194-ton shields that met about from the Weehawken and Manhattan portals. The mud was such that the shield was shoved forward without taking any ground; however, it was found that the shield was easier to steer if some mud was taken in through holes at the front, since the mud had the consistency of toothpaste. After the tubes had been excavated, they were lined with segmental cast-iron rings, each weighing 22 tons. The segments were bolted together and lined with of concrete. The two ends of the northern tube under the river met in September 1906; at that time it was the longest underwater tunnel in the world. Meanwhile, the John Shields Construction Company had begun in 1905 to bore through Bergen Hill, the lower Hudson Palisades; William Bradley took over in 1906 and the tunnels to the Hackensack Meadows were completed in April 1908. Opening and use Workers in the North River Tubes tighten bolts and caulk seams in 1907 1907 exposition display showing cross-section of North and East River tunnels The tunnels opened November 27, 1910, when the New York Tunnel Extension to New York Penn Station opened. Until then, PRR trains used the PRR main line to Exchange Place in Jersey City, New Jersey. The New York Tunnel Extension branched off from the original line two miles northeast of Newark, then ran northeast across the Jersey Meadows to the North River Tunnels and New York Penn. The tunnel project included the Portal Bridge over the Hackensack River and the Manhattan Transfer interchange with the Hudson and Manhattan Railroad (now PATH). The opening of the North River Tunnels and Penn Station made the PRR the only railroad with direct access to New York City from the south. In 1967 the Aldene Plan was implemented, allowing trains of the floundering Central Railroad of New Jersey (CNJ) and Reading (RDG) to run to Newark Penn, connecting to PRR and PATH trains to New York. Penn Central Transportation Company went bankrupt in 1970 and in 1976 its suburban trains were taken over by Conrail, then by NJ Transit in 1983. Penn Central long- distance service (including part of today's Northeast Corridor and Empire Corridor) had been taken over by Amtrak in 1971.Pinkston, Elizabeth (2003). \\"A Brief History of Amtrak.\\" The Past and Future of U.S. Passenger Rail Service. (Washington, D.C.: U.S. Congressional Budget Office) Amtrak took control of the North River Tunnels in 1976, and NJ Transit started running trains through the tunnels under contract with Amtrak. Portals Hackensack portals in 1910 The west portals are in North Bergen, at the west edge of the New Jersey Palisades near the east end of Route 3 at U.S. Route 1/9 (). They run beneath North Bergen, Union City, and Weehawken, to the east portals at the east edge of 10th Avenue at 32nd Street in Manhattan. When the top of the Weehawken Shaft was covered is a mystery; the two tracks may have remained open to the sky until catenary was added circa 1932. The two portals on the Manhattan side fanned out into 21 tracks just east of 10th Avenue, serving the platforms at Penn Station. 450 West 33rd Street (now Five Manhattan West), on the east side of 10th Avenue, was built above the east portals in 1969. Except for a curve west of the west end of Pier 72 that totals just under a degree, the two tracks are straight (in plan view). They are apart from west of 11th Avenue to the Bergen Hill portals. The third rail now ends just west of the Bergen Hill portals. Operation and useful life The North River Tunnels allow a maximum of 24 crossings per hour each way. Since 2003, the tunnels have operated near capacity during peak hours. The number of NJ Transit weekday trains through the North River Tunnels increased from 147 in 1976 to 438 in 2010. Trains ordinarily travel west (to New Jersey) through the north tube and east through the south. During the busiest hour of morning rush, about 24 trains are scheduled through the south tube, and the same through the north tube in the afternoon. The tubes run parallel to each other underneath the river; their centers are separated by . The two tracks fan out to 21 tracks just west of Penn Station. Expansion and restoration=Access to the Region's Core Access to the Region's Core (ARC), launched in 1995 by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey (PANYNJ), NJ Transit, and the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, was a Major Investment Study that looked at public transportation ideas for the New York metropolitan area. It found that long-term goals would best be met by better connections to and in- between the region's major rail stations in Midtown Manhattan, Penn Station and Grand Central Terminal. The East Side Access project, including tunnels under the East River and the East Side of Manhattan, which would divert some LIRR traffic to Grand Central, is expected to be completed in December 2022. The Trans-Hudson Express Tunnel or THE Tunnel, which later took on the name of the study itself, was meant to address the western, or Hudson River, crossing. Engineering studies determined that structural interferences made a new terminal connected to Grand Central or the current Penn Station unfeasible and its final design involved boring under the current rail yard to a new deep cavern terminal station under 34th Street.New Jersey Transit (October 2008). Newark, NJ. \\"Access to the Region's Core: Final Environmental Impact Study.\\" Executive Summary. Amtrak had acknowledged that the region represented a bottleneck in the national system and had originally planned to complete work by 2040. The ARC project, which did not include direct Amtrak participation, was cancelled in October 2010 by New Jersey governor Chris Christie, who cited potential cost overruns. Amtrak briefly engaged the governor in attempt to revive the ARC Tunnel and use preliminary work done for it, but those negotiations soon broke down. Amtrak said it was not interested in purchasing any of the work. New Jersey Senator Robert Menendez later said some preparatory work done for ARC may be used for the new project. Costs for the project were $117 million for preliminary engineering, $126 million for final design, $15 million for construction and $178 million real estate property rights ($28 million in New Jersey and $150 million in New York City). Additionally, a $161 million partially refundable pre-payment of insurance premiums was also made. Subsequently, Amtrak's timetable for beginning its trans-Hudson project was advanced. This was in part due to the cancellation of ARC, a project similar in scope, but with differences in design. Gateway Program and Hurricane Sandy Amtrak's plan for a new Trans-Hudson tunnel, the Gateway Program was unveiled on February 7, 2011, by Amtrak CEO Joseph Boardman and New Jersey Senators Menendez and Frank Lautenberg. The announcement also included endorsements from New York Senator Charles Schumer and Amtrak's Board of Directors. Officials said Amtrak would take the lead in seeking financing; a list of potential sources included the states of New York and New Jersey, the City of New York, the PANYNJ, and the MTA as well as private investors. As of 2017, the Gateway Program is expected to cost $12.9 billion. In October 2012, a year after the Gateway Program was announced, the North River Tubes were inundated by seawater from Hurricane Sandy, marking the first time in the tunnel's history that both tubes had been completely flooded. The surge damaged overhead wires, electrical systems, concrete bench walls, and drainage systems. As a result of the storm damage and the tunnels' age, component failures within the tubes increased, resulting in frequent delays. One report in 2019 estimated that the North River Tubes and the Portal Bridge, two components the Gateway Program seeks to replace, contributed to 2,000 hours of delays between 2014 and 2018. After the North River Tunnels were flooded, the Gateway Program was prioritized. In May 2014, Boardman told the Regional Plan Association that there was less than 20 years before one or both of the tunnels would have to be shut down. If and when the new Gateway Program tunnels are built, the two North River Tunnels would close for repairs, one at a time, with the existing level of service maintained. The North River Tubes and the Gateway Program tunnels would both be able to carry a maximum of 24 trains per hour. Once the new North River tunnels reopen in 2030, capacity on the line would be doubled. The Hudson Tunnel Project would also allow for resiliency on the Northeast Corridor to be increased, making service along the line more reliable with redundant capacity. In July 2017, the draft Environmental Impact Study for the project was issued. Funding for the Gateway Project had been unclear for several years due to a lack of funding commitments from New Jersey officials and the federal government. In 2015, a Gateway Development Corporation, consisting of members from Amtrak, the Port Authority, the United States Department of Transportation, was created to oversee construction of the Gateway Project. The federal government and the states agreed to split the cost of funding the project. The administration of President Donald Trump has cast doubts about funding for the project, and in December 2017, a Federal Transit Administration official called the previous funding agreement \\"nonexistent\\". In March 2018, up to $541 million for the project was provided in the Consolidated Appropriations Act. On June 24, 2019, the state governments of New York and New Jersey passed legislation to create the bi-state Gateway Development Commission, whose job it is to oversee the planning, funding and construction of the rail tunnels and bridges of Gateway Program. In February 2020, Amtrak indicated that it would go forward with the renovation of the North River Tunnels regardless of the Gateway Program's status. The existing North River Tunnels can carry a maximum of 24 trains per hour in each direction. If the new Hudson Tunnel is not built, the North River Tunnels will have to be closed one at a time, reducing weekday service below the existing level of 24 trains per hour. Due to the need to provide two-way service on a single track, service would be reduced by over 50 percent. In the best-case scenario, with perfect operating conditions, 9 trains per hour could be provided through the existing North River Tunnels, or a 63% reduction in service. During the duration of construction, passengers would have to use overcrowded PATH trains, buses, and ferries to get between New Jersey and New York. On the other hand, if the new Gateway tunnel is built, it would allow an additional 24 trains per hour to travel under the Hudson River, supplementing the 24 trains per hour that could use the existing North River Tubes.

All students are required to participate in the Naval Junior Reserve Officers Training Corps, or NJROTC. It enrolls about 560 cadets in grades nine through twelve, and enjoys academic recognition from the state of Delaware and the United States Navy. As a public charter school, there are no admission requirements. The school uses an application and interview, but its selections are governed by charter school law. Campus The Delaware Military Academy lies within the boundaries of the Red Clay Consolidated School District, but as a charter school it is not part of the school district. The school is on Middleboro Road in Wilmington, Delaware, adjacent to nearby Banning Park, a local housing development, and several light industrial and commercial operations. Due to the lack of on-campus athletic facilities, students often walk to Banning Park for sports practices or physical education classes. Other nearby schools have reached agreements with the Academy that allow it to use their athletic facilities and fields. There are plans to create these facilities on campus. Because it is a charter school, it serves students from across the county, and employs faculty from as far away as the city of Dover, over an hour away in driving distance. There are two buildings on campus: Talley Hall and the unnamed \\"Naval Science building.\\" They are separated by a parking lot and sidewalk island. Talley Hall contains strictly academic classrooms, and is where most of the students' academic education will take place. In addition, the school's main office and nurse's office are in Talley Hall. The Naval Science building contains classrooms for military instruction, as well as classrooms used by the science department. It also contains the school cafeteria, (referred to as a \\"mess hall\\"), gymnasium (or \\"drill deck\\"), weight room, NJROTC supply office, Naval Science Instructor offices, the cadet staff office, and two dressing rooms (added in 2009). In 2010, the school bought a large amount of land around the campus and a parade field surrounded by a paved track and additional parking was completed behind the academy in 2012. There are plans to add a third building, a \\"Language building\\", which will house the school's English language arts and foreign language classrooms as funds become available. Organization As a high school in which every student is also a cadet, the Delaware Military Academy has a special organizational structure. In terms of faculty, there are typical academic teachers and administrative positions, but there is a significant military presence as well. In addition to some academic teachers being retired from the United States armed forces, there are seven Naval Science Instructors, or NSIs, who oversee the military aspect of the school. Six of these NSIs teach Naval Science classes to the student. There is also a student organizational structure, referred to as a Chain of Command. This chain of command depicts the roles of each cadet in the school, ranging from \\"Squad Leader,\\" (no special responsibility), to \\"Regimental Commander,\\" the cadet in charge of the entire school's military section. Various positions are available to the students, in various levels of the organization. There are leaders for each subdivision of the Regiment, and for each subdivision of that, etc. Special positions are also available, such as \\"Public Affairs Officer\\" and \\"Web Site Manager.\\" Much of the school's activity is handled by the cadets, only traveling to the staff for approval and supervision. The school's student organization resembles a United States military organization, as per JROTC standards set forth by the military. However, the school differs slightly from most NJROTC units, as the standards were created with the thought of a small section of students being devoted to JROTC. Considering every student is a member of NJROTC, many standards are applied differently. The student body is referred to as a \\"Regiment.\\" Within the Regiment are two \\"Battalions\\" within each Battalion there are four \\"Companies\\" a student is assigned to a company based on when he or she has Naval Science class each year, and the companies are named the same way. Each company consists of four to five \\"platoons,\\" named according to the phonetic alphabet used by the United States military. A student's platoon is simply his or her Naval Science class. The platoon is then further divided into three \\"squads,\\" each containing an equal number of students. Squads are randomly assigned to students by the students' instructor. Core values and honor code In keeping with the military atmosphere of the school, new students are introduced early on to the concept of \\"core values.\\" Delaware Military Academy takes directly from the Navy in this, and maintains core values of \\"honor, courage, and commitment.\\" It is expected that all students adhere to these values at all times when representing the school, whether actually in school or not. Another item taken from the military is the concept of an \\"honor code.\\" Delaware Military Academy's honor code is outlined in its school handbook, which details its purpose and requirements. In the military, there is an inherent sense of trust between superiors and subordinates. Seeking to recreate this trust in an academic setting, the school set up an honor code which all students are required to adhere to. Academics A major facet of the school's identity is the relationship between its academic areas and its military areas. Delaware Military Academy offers an entirely college-preparatory academic curriculum, with \\"Honors\\" classes available to students in grades ten through twelve, and two Advanced Placement classes available to those who have completed the prerequisite courses. Class selection is poor in comparison to other high schools in the same area, due to a low number of class periods per day (five) and a large portion of each student's schedule occupied by Naval Science. All students must take Naval Science I through Naval Science IV, one class each year. The Academy has been recognized by both the state of Delaware and the United States Navy for academic achievement. The state has awarded the title of \\"Superior\\" to the school for high scores on standardized testing, for five consecutive years. The Navy awarded the title \\"Distinguished Unit with Academic Honors\\" to the school the very first year the school was eligible. With that title came nine appointments to three military service academies, three each to the United States Naval Academy in Annapolis, MD; the United States Air Force Academy in Colorado Springs, CO; and the United States Military Academy in West Point, NY. Graduates from the school attend each of these academies, as well as various other military academies and universities throughout the United States. DMA was the first full-time JROTC high school in the nation. Athletics The Delaware Military Academy offers a variety of varsity and club sports to students. In addition to the typical junior varsity and varsity teams, certain sports also maintain a \\"freshmen\\" team reserved specifically for ninth grade students. The school is a member of the Delaware Interscholastic Athletic Association and participates in the Diamond State Conference. The following are sports which the school offers: Baseball, Basketball, Cheerleading, Cross Country, Field Hockey, Football, Golf, Ice Hockey, Lacrosse, Marksmanship, Soccer, Softball, Swimming, Winter Track, Wrestling, Outdoor Track, and Volleyball. In 2010, the Seahawks Ice Hockey Team became the first Delaware Military Academy team to go undefeated 19-0 and gave the school its first team championship by defeating Hodgson Vo-Tech High School in the Flight B Conference Finals. In 2012, the Seahawks Ice Hockey Team became Delaware Scholastic Hockey Association Varsity Champions, defeating A. I. duPont High School in the Flight A Conference Finals. This was the team's first varsity championship and DMA's second overall sports championship. In 2015, the Seahawks volleyball team gave Delaware Military Academy their first DIAA state championship. They would go on to win again in 2016. Finances The school receives the limited state funding available to charter schools. It therefore must raise funds for capital improvements and student activities through donations and fees. The school's \\"Superintendent\\" often meets with military groups regarding financial assistance for the school and promotes the school with legislative and administrative agencies. In debt from building construction, funding is not available for all desired technology and conveniences; for example, meal preparation facilities are limited to microwaves spread throughout the cafeteria.

It focuses primarily on the stories of three Jehovah's Witnesses, and how their lives demonstrate three fundamental Witness teachings that have affected society in general: Conscientious objection, and rejection of blood transfusions and saluting the flag. Knocking explored how the unpopular religion of Jehovah's Witnesses played a major role in First Amendment history, setting Supreme Court precedents that expanded individual liberties for all Americans. In interviews, director Joel Engardio said Knocking is not about the theology of Jehovah's Witnesses but instead uses the religion as a case study to examine how disparate and disagreeable groups can hold their unique beliefs without marginalizing or limiting the freedom of others. \\"We may not be each others' cup of tea,\\" Engardio said on NPR, \\"but tolerance allows a variety of kettles to peacefully share the stove.\\" Knocking won several film festival awards including Best Documentary at the USA Film Festival and was covered in Newsweek, USA Today and newspapers across the United States. Entertainment Weekly named it \\"What to Watch.\\" Knocking was broadcast in the United States on PBS. It was also broadcast in Australia, Canada, Greece and Israel. Knocking was released on DVD in English, Spanish, Portuguese, Russian and Korean. Criticism Critics of Jehovah's Witnesses said the film did not deal harshly enough with controversies surrounding the religion, like the practice of disfellowshiping. Engardio told film festival audiences that Knocking contained criticism organic to the film's story. Engardio has written Washington Post essays critical of Jehovah's Witness practices, including shunning and refusal of blood transfusions. Engardio has also written essays for the Washington Post and USA Today about civil rights issues involving Jehovah's Witnesses outside the scope of his film. Most notable was the 2010 ruling by a federal judge that overturned California's ban on gay marriage, in which the key legal precedent cited by the judge was a 1943 Supreme Court case won by Jehovah's Witnesses. Another Washington Post essay by Engardio warns that a ban on Jehovah's Witnesses in Russia is a dangerous precedent that could lead to the loss of freedoms for other unpopular groups in the emerging democracy. Main characters ;Lillian Gobitas: As a girl in Pennsylvania, she and thousands of other Witness children's refusal to salute the flag of the United States initiated controversy that led to a pivotal U.S. Supreme Court ruling on freedom of religion. ;Joseph Kempler: Born a Jew, he converted to the Jehovah's Witness faith after observing their integrity alongside Jews in Nazi concentration camps during World War II. After converting, Kempler remained distant from his daughter who had been raised by Jewish relatives. To draw his family closer together, Kempler took them on a trip to Europe to see his home country and visit the Melk and Auschwitz concentration camps. ;Seth Thomas: A 23-year-old Witness who, despite the risk and opposition from non- Witness relatives, refused blood transfusions with his liver transplant operation. While initially refused treatment by the Baylor University Medical Center of Texas, surgeons with the University of Southern California University Hospital in Los Angeles agreed to perform the operation, believing that research in bloodless surgery is necessary and should be explored.

History Predominating before the dominance of Italic script, it arose out of the need for a hand more legible and universally recognizable than the book hand of the High Middle Ages, in order to cope with the increase in long-distance business and personal correspondence, in cities, chanceries and courts. The hand thus used by secretaries was developed from cursive business hands and was in common use throughout the British Isles through the seventeenth century. In spite of its loops and flourishes it was widely used by scriveners and others whose daily employment comprised hours of writing. By 1618 the writing-master Martin Billingsley in his The Pen's Excellency, 1618, distinguished three forms of secretary hand, as well as \\"mixed\\" hands that employed some Roman letterforms, and the specialised hands, the \\"court hand\\" used only in the courts of the King's Bench and Common Pleas and the archaic hands used for engrossing pipe rolls and other documents. William Shakespeare's will, written in 1616 in secretary hand At the time of Henry VII, many writers began to use the \\"Italian\\" style instead, a cursive script developed from the humanist minuscule or \\"Roman\\" hand which was easier to read but also easier to forge. English ladies were often taught an \\"Italian hand\\", suitable for the occasional writing that they were expected to do. Grace Ioppolo notes that the convention in writing the texts of dramas was to write act and scene settings, characters' names and stage directions in italic, and the dialogue in secretary hand. The modern use of italic font stems from these distinctions. Aside from palaeographers themselves, genealogists, social historians and scholars of Early Modern literature have become accustomed to reading secretary hand. William Henry Ireland used the secretary hand to forge many Shakespeare documents.

It lives in Africa, in the Sahara desert and the Sahel. This critically endangered species has disappeared from most of its former range due to overhunting and habitat loss, and natural populations only remain in Chad, Mali, and Niger. Its habitat includes grassland, shrubland, semi-deserts, open savanna and mountain plateaus. Its diet includes grasses, leaves (especially Acacia leaves), shoots, and fruit. In Niger, the dama gazelle has become a national symbol. Under the Hausa name meyna or m√©nas, the dama gazelle appears on the badge of the Niger national football team, who are popularly called the M√©nas. Description Close-up of the head of a mhorr gazelle (N. d. mhorr) The dama gazelle is white with a reddish-brown head and neck. Both sexes usually have medium-length ringed horns curved like an \\"S\\". Males' horns are about long, while females' horns are much shorter. The head is small with a narrow muzzle, and the eyes are relatively large. It has a longer neck and longer legs than most gazelles. It is between tall at the shoulder, weighs between , and has a lifespan up to 12 years in the wild or 18 in captivity. A few days following birth, dama young are strong enough to follow the herd, and after a week, they are able to run as fast as the adults. The dama gazelle is considered the largest species of gazelle, with incredibly long legs, which provide extra surface area to dissipate heat, one of the many ways it stays cool in its hot desert environment. It also tends to need more water than some of its desert relatives, but it can withstand fairly long periods of drought. Unlike many other desert mammals, the dama gazelle is a diurnal species, meaning it is active during the day. Always on the alert, the dama gazelle uses a behavior called pronking to warn herd members of danger. Pronking involves the animal hopping up and down with all four of its legs stiff, so that its limbs all leave and touch the ground at the same time. Males also establish territories, and during breeding season, they actively exclude other mature males. They mark their territories with urine and dung piles and secretions from glands near their eyes. Subspecies status and conservation The dama gazelle is generally divided into three subspecies based on the colour of the animal's back, flanks and haunches. These three subspecies occupied three blocks running along the east‚Äìwest axis of the gazelle's range. The easternmost is the N. dama ruficollis (common name addra gazelle) whose historical range was to the east of 15¬∞E. The westernmost is the N. dama mhorr (common name mohor or mhorr gazelle) whose historical range was to the west of 7¬∞E. Between the two was the historical range of the N. dama dama. Genetic studies have raised questions over the validity of these subspecies and the variation in colour (phenotype) appears to be clinal. * N. d. mhorr, the mhorr gazelle, is extinct in the wild (last known wild sighting was in 1968), but present in captive breeding programs in Europe, North America, North Africa and the Middle East, and several efforts have reintroduced animals into former and similar habitat areas. * N. d. dama (nominate subspecies) is only kept in captivity at Al Ain Zoo in the United Arab Emirates, and is very rare in the wild. * N. d. ruficollis, the addra gazelle, is present in captive breeding programs in Europe, North America and the Middle East, and very rare in the wild. File:The book of antelopes (1894) Gazella ruficollis.pngIllustration of N. d. ruficollis File:The book of antelopes (1894) Gazella mhorr.pngIllustration of N. d. mhorr The numbers of this species in the wild have fallen by 80% over the last decade. The IUCN now lists it as critically endangered with a wild population of less than 500 (the most recent review suggests c. 300). It occurs in poor countries and little action is taken to protect the species. The national parks are not well guarded, and poaching still occurs. It has been extirpated from Libya, Mauritania, Morocco and Nigeria. Populations remain in Chad, Mali and Niger, and it has been reintroduced in Senegal and Tunisia. Threats to survival=Biological threats The Dama gazelle does not need a lot of water, but it needs more than other desert animals. It is not as resistant and perishes from a lack of water during the drought season. The environment has become ill-suited for it. Habitat pressure from pastoral activity is another reason for decline, as are introduced diseases from livestock. Human threats Another reason for the decline of the dama gazelle is habitat destruction. Humans cut down the branches of the trees on which this gazelle feeds. As a result, the trees die and the gazelle cannot eat. Human threats are the most dangerous of threats to the dama gazelle. The main reason this species of gazelle is endangered is because of mechanized hunting; hunters using vehicles increase its decline. Civil unrest, for instance in Sudan, also negatively affects the life of the dama gazelle. Since the gazelle is already having a hard time surviving, these conditions have made its habitat unsuitable. A potential threat the dama gazelle faces is tourism. Tourists want to take pictures of this endangered species, and in doing so, may be perceived as a threat, especially during the hot season. Gazelles will run away from perceived danger, and in the hot season may overheat and die of stress. Conservation efforts Relatively few actions have been taken in the conservation of the dama gazelle. The few measures that have been taken are reserves so the animal can live in peaceful environment and captive breeding to help rebuild the populations. A reserve for mhorr gazelles was set up in 1971 to help avoid extinction. This reserve, Parque de Rescate de la Fauna Sahariana (Rescue Park for Saharan Fauna) of the Estaci√≥n Experimental de Zonas √Åridas (Experimental Station of Arid Zones), is in Spain. The reserve has been a success and is still around today. Another reserve for the mhorr subspecies was set up in Chad, the Ouadi Rime-Ouadi Achime Faunal Reserve. This reserve was effective from 1978‚Äì1987, but due to civil war, it was abandoned. Captive breeding is a very popular way to help an endangered species repopulate. The species reproduces in captivity, but the small founder population potentially presents a problem and may result in inbreeding. The primary focus of European EAZA zoos is the mhorr gazelle (N. d. mhorr), while the primary focus of North American AZA zoos is the addra gazelle (N. d. ruficollis). Mhorr gazelles are also kept in North African facilities and both subspecies are kept in the Middle East. These are maintained as part of the European Endangered Species Programme and Species Survival Plan. The studbooks include 293 mhorr (2014) and 168 addra gazelles (2012). One participant in the addra gazelle plan, White Oak Conservation in Yulee, Florida, has bred the gazelles since 1983, resulting in nearly 300 births. Several hundred additional animals that are not managed as part of the studbooks are kept privately, especially in Texas. Small population size and inbreeding are a serious concern in this population due to the increased parasite load and reduced reproductive viability. Few substantial in situ conservation efforts have been mounted due to the political situation in their currently fragmented habitat. The survival of this species in the wild depends on more reserves being created in the Sahelian and Saharan zones and better protection in the reserves that do exist. As the population deteriorates, researchers in 2008 stressed the need for healthy captive population and for help to preserve their habitats in the wild. In 2015, a reintroduction project was conducted in the Western Saharan territory of Morocco, in the Safia Natural Reserve close to the border with Mauritania. 24 gazelles were released in a semi-enclosed facility, seven of which were monitored with telemetry collars. During the course of the project, animals experienced a poaching event, resulting in the deaths of three animals. Additionally, seven animals were killed by domestic dogs from nearby military outposts, suggesting that the animals do not recognize potential predators. This milestone project proved that reintroduction of wild animals in this part of the world is extremely difficult despite the favorable sentiment of the majority of local communities.

He is on record as High Sheriff of Norfolk and Suffolk in 1442, 1458 and 1464 and 1476. Calthorpe is recorded on 28 June 1443, when he released one of his villeins, from serfdom and set him free from all future services. He became locum tenens and Commissary-General to the late most noble and potent William, Duke of Norfolk, Earl of Pembroke, and Lord Great Chamberlain of England, Ireland and Aquitaine, during the minority of the Duke's son and heir, Henry, Earl of Exeter. In 1469, Sir William described himself as Sir William Calthorp of Ludham, a manor which he owned, as well as that of Burnham Thorpe. In 1479, he was Steward of the household of the Duke of Norfolk. Calthorpe was made a Knight of the Bath in the Tower of London, by King Edward IV, on the Coronation of his Queen, Elizabeth Wydville, Ascension Day, 26 May 1465. Calthorpe's first wife was Elizabeth (1406-1437), daughter of Reginald Grey, 3rd Baron Grey de Ruthyn (1362-1440), by whom Sir William had a son and two daughters. His second wife was Elizabeth (c. 1441-18 February 1505), eldest daughter and co-heir of Sir Miles Stapleton, of Ingham, Norfolk, by his spouse, Katherine de la Pole (c. 1416-1488)), who settled the manor of Hempstead, Norfolk, upon Elizabeth. Sir William was subsequently found to be lord of three parts of it in 1491; his second surviving son, Sir Francis, died possessed of it in 1544, and his son William next inherited it, and sold it about 1573. Calthorpe made Presentations to the Rectory of Beeston, Norfolk in 1460, 1481, 1492, and the Rectory of Hempstede in 1479 and 1485. In the church of St Martin at Palace, Norwich, is a tablet showing that in 1550 Lady Calthorp (Sir William's daughter-in-law) gave a silver cup and a velvet carpet to that church. It appears that the Calthorpes had their town house in this parish for many years, and Sir William Calthorp certainly lived there in 1492, and probably long before then, for it is recorded that in 1447 the Executors of Joan Lady Bardolph, sold the old seat of the Erpinghams, in St.Martin's at the Palace, to William Calthorp, Esq., and the receivership of the Erpingham manor was vested in Sir Philip Calthorp (d. 1535 - grandson of Sir William) and his wife Joan (n√©e Blennerhasset), in 1487. In Sir William's will, he mentions that many of his ancestors were buried in North Creake Church, Norfolk. This Will is given in full in East Anglian Notes & Queries (vol.ii, p.210), as an interesting specimen of wills of that date. He mentions many of his family. He was buried within the Church of the White Friars, Norwich, beside his first wife. One of Sir William's daughters by his second marriage, Anne (d. bef. March 1558), married Sir Robert Drury, of Thurston, and Hawstead, Suffolk. Another of Sir William's daughters by his second marriage, Elizabeth Calthrope married Francis Hasilden on 31 May 1494. They had a daughter, Frances Hasilden who married Sir Robert Peyton, of Isleham in January 1516, becoming ancestors of the Peyton baronets. Sir Robert Peyton, of Isleham was the son of Sir Robert Peyton, of Wicken by Elizabeth Clere. References *Banks, Sir T. C., Bt., Baronia Anglica Concentrata; or Baronies in Fee, London, 1844.

LAL reacts with bacterial endotoxin lipopolysaccharide (LPS), which is a membrane component of gram-negative bacteria. This reaction is the basis of the LAL test, which is widely used for the detection and quantification of bacterial endotoxins. In Asia, a similar Tachypleus amebocyte lysate (TAL) test based on the local horseshoe crabs Tachypleus gigas or Tachypleus tridentatus is occasionally used instead. The recombinant factor C (rFC) assay is a replacement of LAL/TAL based on a similar reaction. Background Fred Bang reported in 1956 that gram-negative bacteria, even if killed, will cause the blood of the horseshoe crab to turn into a semi-solid mass. It was later recognized that the animal's blood cells, mobile cells called amoebocytes, contain granules with a clotting factor known as coagulogen; this is released outside the cell when bacterial endotoxin is encountered. The resulting coagulation (gelling) is thought to contain bacterial infections in the animal's semi-closed circulatory system. Modern analysis of the lysate has led to understanding of this system of cascade, with multiple enzymes working in sequence to produce the gel. The entry point of endotoxin-induced clotting is Limulus clotting factor C. In 1977 the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved LAL for testing drugs, products and devices that come in contact with the blood. Prior to that date, a much slower and more expensive test on rabbits had been used for this purpose. Horseshoe crabs are collected and blood is removed from the horseshoe crab's pericardium; the crabs are then returned to the water. LAL manufacturers have measured mortality rates of 3% in bled crabs; however, recent studies indicate that this number may be closer to 15% or even 30%. The blood cells are separated from the serum using centrifugation and are then placed in distilled water, which causes them to swell and burst (\\"lyse\\"). This releases the chemicals from the inside of the cell (the \\"lysate\\"), which is then purified and freeze-dried. To test a sample for endotoxins, it is mixed with lysate and water; endotoxins are present if coagulation occurs. The LAL test There are three basic methodologies: gel- clot, turbidimetric, and chromogenic. The primary application for LAL is the testing of parenteral pharmaceuticals and medical devices that contact blood or cerebrospinal fluid. In the United States, the FDA has published a guideline for validation of the LAL test as an endotoxin test for such products. The LAL cascade is also triggered by (1,3)-Œ≤-D-glucan, via a different Factor G. Both bacterial endotoxins and (1,3)-Œ≤-D-glucan are considered pathogen-associated molecular patterns, or PAMPs, substances which elicit inflammatory responses in mammals. Overcoming inhibition and enhancement One of the most time-consuming aspects of endotoxin testing using LAL is pretreating samples to overcome assay inhibition that may interfere with the LAL test such that the recovery of endotoxin is affected. If the product being tested causes the endotoxin recovery to be less than expected, the product is inhibitory to the LAL test. Products which cause higher than expected values are enhancing. Overcoming the inhibition and enhancement properties of a product is required by the FDA as part of the validation of the LAL test for use in the final release testing of injectables and medical devices. Proper endotoxin recovery must be proven before LAL can be used to release product.  Alternatives = Recombinant factor C  The LAL test is a major source of animal product dependence in the biomed industry, and with reports of the higher-than anticipated mortality rate, it has been considered more ethical to devise alternatives to the test. (The idea that moving away from LAL to reduce the use of Atlantic horseshoe crabs will help conservation efforts should be carefully evaluated, as moving to rFC could produce counterproductive effects by endangering the conservation efforts many have fought to implement.) Since 2003, a synthetic substitute for the LAL test has been commercially available. Named the recombinant factor C (rFC) assay, it is based on the same Limulus clotting factor C protein, produced by genetically modified organisms like insect gut cells. (The specific factor C sequence used does not necessarily come from the Atlantic horseshoe crab.) Instead of emulating the whole clotting pathway, rFC tests let factor C cleave a fluorogenic molecule, so that the sample lights up when endotoxin activates the factor. Since it does not contain factor G, (1,3)-Œ≤-D- glucan will not cause false-positives. As of 2018, available evidence appears to show the rFC test no worse than the LAL test. The adoption of the rFC test was slow, which began to change in 2012 when the US FDA and the European health ministry acknowledged it as an accepted alternative. Its lack of mention in Pharmacopeias remained an issue, as there was no good standard for running the test in production. In 2016, it was added to the European Pharmacopoeia. A patent on rFC also limited adoption until its expiration in 2018. On June 1st, 2020, the United States Pharmacopeia (USP) decided to cancel the proposal to include recombinant technology for endotoxin testing in chapter <85> Bacterial Endotoxins and start the development of a separate chapter that expands on the use, validation, and comparability of endotoxin tests based on recombinantly derived reagents. The separate chapter 1085.1 will be a guidance chapter only, meaning rFC will not be a compendial method. USP chapter 1085.1 will require the rFC user to perform validation of alternative microbiological methods as detailed in USP chapter <1223> if they want to implement rFC.https://www.uspnf.com/notices/bacterial-endotoxin-test- gen-announcement-20200529  Monocyte Activation Test  The monocyte activation test (MAT) is another proposed method to test for endotoxins based on monocytes in human blood. It measures the release of cytokines from these due to the presence of pyrogens, basically mirroring the process by which these toxins cause fever in humans. A protocol for the MAT test, using cultured cells, is described in the European Pharmacopeia.

The island is about 8 km from north to south and only 5 km or so at its widest point. The island is dominated by hills, rising to a height of around 550 m in the north. Paama lies a short distance south of Ambrym, a little further east of Malakula, about 7 km west of the large active volcano Lopevi (Ulvae, in the vernacular (see Crowley 1982), and a short distance north of the island of Epi. During daylight, all of Paama's neighbouring islands are clearly visible from various locations on the island. Indeed, on a clear night the red glow of Ambrym's twin volcanos can be seen clearly from the black sand beach at Liro. The now uninhabited island of Lopevi dominates the view east from the village of Lulep, on the northeast coast of the island. This active volcano is reasonably regular, erupting every two years or so, causing quite serious problems for those living in the villages of Lulep and Luli in the northeast of the island. The acidic volcanic ash falls onto gardens, ruining crops, and onto the natangura thatched roofs, rotting it. Population Today the majority of people living on Paama live in villages close to the coast of the island and make their gardens on the hillsides nearby. Agricultural produce is by and large for subsistence although some is exported for sale in Port Vila (Vanuatu's capital on √âfat√©) and Luganville (on Espiritu Santo). Liro, the island's council and administrative centre is the most heavily populated village on the island. The council building, standing a hundred or so metres up from the shore is said to have been the house of the Rev. Maurice Frater, the Presbyterian missionary resident on the island in the early 1900s.Frater, Maurice. (1928) [1922]. Midst Volcanic Fires. James Clarke & CO., Limited.Miller, J. Graham. (1989).

The APA was acquired by Catalyst Paper from Abitibi Consolidated in 2008. The Snowflake paper mill shut down permanently on September 30, 2012. In late 2015, the railway was purchased out of bankruptcy by a group including Aztec Land & Cattle Company and Midwest Poultry Producers, L.P., thereby avoiding a shutdown and scrappage of the line. The railway continues to operate, and its revenues are driven primarily by car repair and storage. The railway's freight revenues have not yet recovered from the shutdown of the Snowflake paper mill then owned by Catalyst, although efforts to enhance them continue.

It was extended south to McNary in 1920. From October 1, 1931, until 1936, amid the Great Depression, the APA was placed in receivership. A tourist railroad, the White Mountain Scenic Railroad, operated steam powered passenger excursions over the Southwest Forest Industries-owned line from McNary to the logging camp of Maverick, AZ, beginning in 1964. As track conditions deteriorated, the excursions were cut back in later years to a point about half way to Maverick. In the final years, it operated north from Pinetop Lakes to a place called Bell Siding on U.S. Route 60. In 1976, the White Mountain Scenic Railroad ceased operations and moved its equipment to Heber City, Utah to be used on an excursion there known as the \\"Heber Creeper.\\" The line from Maverick to McNary, with some elevations exceeding , was removed in 1982 after the McNary sawmill closed. By the 1980s, the Apache Railway was Arizona's only remaining logging railroad. The track from Snowflake to McNary was abandoned in 1982. In July 2012, the owner of the railroad and an on-line paper mill, Catalyst Paper, announced that the mill and railroad would shut down and be sold later in the year. In December, Catalyst agreed to sell the railroad and mill to Hackman Capital. Hackman planned to dismantle the railroad along with the mill, but local officials who wanted to retain rail service formed a non-profit foundation to purchase the railroad from lenders, using a federal Railroad Rehabilitation and Improvement Financing loan, which was denied in November 2014. Hackman took over control again and put the railroad into bankruptcy in May 2015, while local officials attempted to secure a rural economic development loan from the USDA. A bankruptcy court ruled on September 1, 2015 to postpone the sale deadline of the railroad, which the court valued at $7.2 million, until November 30. Passenger service The Apache Railway offered passenger service until the 1950s. In July 1954, the mixed train operated on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays, departing McNary at 7:15am, arriving Holbrook at 12:15pm, departing there at 1:30pm and returning to McNary at 7:00pm.

The original album art, which depicted two severed, partially decomposed heads kissing (in fact, it is one head which had been sawed in half by Joel-Peter Witkin), had to be changed for the Australian release. The cover art can also be seen as a parody of a famous picture with Leonid Brezhnev and Erich Honecker kissing at the celebrations of the 30th birthday of the former German Democratic Republic in 1979.

Wright started inventing the geography as a young boy and continued the hobby into adulthood. Size \\"Islandia\\" is a fictional country at the extreme southern end of Karain. Neither the specific dimensions of the Karain semi-continent, nor Islandia, are ever specifically stated in the book, however a number of things are implied. Judging from the author's own maps published in some versions of the novel, and the travel times the protagonist takes getting from one point to another, Islandia appears to be roughly the same size as the American region of New England, and has a generally similar climate. Using the same maps for reference, that would make the semi-continent appear to be about half the size of Australia, or about 1.5 million square miles (3.9 km2) in area. Location The exact location of the semi-continent is a matter of some debate. In the novel, the author never specifically states its exact location; however in personal correspondence and in his unpublished notes, he states quite clearly that it is in the South Atlantic ocean (i.e., \\"... not on the Spanish side of the Pope's line ...,\\") in between South America, Africa, and Antarctica, somewhat closer to Africa and Antarctica than to South America. However, readers such as Elmer Davis have concluded that it lies in the South Pacific, somewhere between New Zealand and South America. Indeed, Mark Saxton, who edited the manuscript for Islandia, pointedly ignored the author's own notes on the location of the fictional land, and wrote three sequels setting it in the South Pacific. When asked about this, he repeated geographer John K. Wright's opinion that the Atlantic was already too crowded. Isabel Huggan placed it in the Indian Ocean. Internal evidence in Islandia itself supports the Atlantic locale. First, there is direct steamer traffic between Karain and England, with the travel time being only 19 days, far shorter than would be required to sail from England to the Pacific. Second, the semi-continent was invaded by a Negroid group who were displaced from Africa by the advent of Islam in the sixth and seventh centuries AD. This would clearly not be feasible if Karain was several thousand nautical miles from Africa. And third, ships from Europe made regular voyages to Islandia and Saint Anthony in the 12th century AD, clearly beyond the capabilities of Europe at that time, if the continent were in the Pacific. Inhabitants Descendants of the Africans who settled on the semi-continent are called \\"Bants\\" ‚Äî probably derived from the name \\"Bantu\\" ‚Äî and make up the vast majority of the population. The Karain are a \\"... mixed race of Bant and Saracen blood ...\\" who settled the coastal areas of the semi-continent. The Demiji are Arab nomads inhabiting the Col Plateau. Native inhabitants, a Caucasoid race calling themselves \\"Islandians,\\" live only in the extreme south, separated from the rest of the population by an alpine mountain chain. The novel makes it clear that the Islandians themselves once occupied the entire semi-continent, but were progressively driven further and further south by the various waves of invaders from Africa. The mountain range became a natural border, and the lands to the south became the refuge of the original, mostly displaced, Islandians Boundaries The political divisions portrayed are as of the year 1907, when the semi-continent (excluding Islandia) has been partitioned among several outside powers. A German protectorate controls the southwest, bordering Islandia, and in the extreme northwest is the French Colony of Biacra. Abutting both is a large German Colony administered from the port city of Sulliaba. On the east coast, a British protectorate comprises most of the country of Mobono, governed from the city of the same name, formerly the capital of the native Karain Empire. To the northeast of the British protectorate is the much larger and more prosperous British Crown Colony of St. Anthony, named for and governed from the city of the same name. The remainder of the non-Islandian portion of the semi-continent, about 40% of the whole, is independent. This region comprises primarily interior lands, chiefly the Col Plateau, which is mostly desert. The largest populated area of the independent portion of Karain is the Demiji, located between the Col Plateau and Mobono. Later political developments in Karain have not been portrayed in the published fiction on Islandia. Presumably after World War I the German controlled regions would have been assigned to other nations as trustee territories. The last glimpse of Karain is from 1969, at which time Islandia is contemplating joining the United Nations; no information about the status of other countries in Karain at that time is provided. Natural features Three offshore volcanic islands, Carnia, Kernia, and Ferrin, have been known since 1472. They supply the Islandians with iron, copper, and other minerals. The largest river in the semi-continent is the Karain River, which runs more or less south-to-north. At its mouth is one of the largest river deltas in the world, rivaling that in Louisiana. The largest city on the delta is Shobo-n-Po, which is independent. There is a great deal of pirate activity near the city. Not counting the arid Col Plateau, the interior of the continent is reputed to be unbroken jungle surrounding the river. The largest lake is at the headwaters of the Karain River, Lake M'Pulo. This in turn is fed by a number of large rivers (the Treacher, the Ono, the Turain, the Kasiholo, the Loborango, the M'Pulo, and the Puchiaihipopolobanjo), which are themselves fed by runoff from the mountain range that separates Islandia from the rest of Karain. The only city of note on lake M'Pulo is Todojil, and to its south and west is the massive Karain Swamp, which forms the upper end of the German Protectorate. The Karain semi-continent has four distinct watersheds, the largest of which makes up the entire core of the semi-continent itself. The Karain Watershed The center of the semi-continent is a massive valley running roughly south to north, and bordered on three sides by mountain chains. Runoff from the mountains flows downhill until it meets Lake M-pulo. To the south, the Karain watershed is bordered by the alpine Islandia Mountains, and meltwater from these provides most of the water to the valley. In the west, the Ono and Matclorn Rivers flow south and east out of the mountains over the Sobo steppes, which eventually merge into the Karain River. As the Karain River flows north, it merges with the Sesipopolo River flowing out of the central Sobo region. A bit further north the Karain merges with the Pachicachipopolobango River which flows north and east out of the eastern Steppes and the Islandia mountains, with its headwaters just north of the Omoa pass. Perhaps thirty miles further north, the Karain meets up with the Kesikolo River bringing meltwaters from Mount Nokono in the east. From there the Karain bends sharply, and enters the large Karain Swamp, where it merges with the Treacher River, which itself originates in the alpine Omoa Pass region. From there the Karain empties into massive Lake M-pulo. M-pulo is fed by several other large rivers, most notably the Todojl River flowing in from the Tahitikl mountains to the west. Lake M-polo empties into the northern Karain River, but the elevation of the land in the valley is very slight, so the river meanders through fifteen large bends before it reaches the ocean (presumed to be the Atlantic) to the south. There are only three settlements of any size along the northern Karain, the entire interior of the continent being essentially one vast, trackless jungle or rainforest. The southernmost of these is Karain Town, which was renamed Wilhelmsburg during the German colonial period. A hundred or so miles south of that is Shobo-n-po, at which point the river breaks up into numerous tributaries in the massive delta. There is a large Pirate Stronghold in the delta, though details about it are lacking. The Meroma River is a second large river in the Karain Watershed, running for perhaps a hundred miles roughly south-to-north from the northern end of the Col Plateau until it reaches the ocean (again, presumed to be the Atlantic) about a hundred miles east, and a little bit to the north of the Karain. The Mobono Watershed To the south and east of the Karain Watershed is the Mobono Watershed, dominated by the Mobono, a comparatively minor river perhaps sixty miles long. It flows down to the east from Mount Nokono, where it meets the city of Mobono at the ocean. The Eastern Watershed The region between the western mountains and the ocean is devoid of rivers, with the only one of any consequence being the Tillie River, which flows west from the Omoa pass about to the ocean, with the city of M-paba at its mouth. The Islandia Watershed Islandia is a broad peninsula that is cut off from the remainder of the semi-continent by a large curved chain of alpine mountains. The area is well watered, but most of the rivers are comparatively short. On the east coast we find the Carran River, the Miltain River, and the Beal River, each named for the dominant towns nearest them. The Niven River is the longest in the eastern half of the country, running more or less southeast from the Frays, a large plateau in the mountains. The Frays also produce several small creeks and streams which eventually merge to form Islandia's central river, the Bannar River, which leads due north to Islandia bay, which then opens into the ocean. Islandia's capital city, \\"Elanery\\" (in the local language, but generally translated as simply \\"The City\\") is on three islands in the mouth of this river. On the west, the Bannar River also opens into Islandia Bay. East of there, the northern coast is broken by the Helby and Inerria rivers. On the west coast is the Doring River, far and away the longest river in all Islandia, starting out below the Mora Pass atop the Frays, and running roughly southwest through the town of Doring until it breaks up into a delta and meets the ocean. The Lay River, really more of a large stream, runs south and west and joins the delta. north of that lies the Dale and Farrant Rivers.

It is situated between the Berwyn and Lawrence stations on the Red Line, which runs from Rogers Park at Chicago's northern city limits, through downtown Chicago, to Roseland. It is an elevated station with a single island platform located at 1118 West Argyle Street in the West Argyle Street Historic District of Chicago's Uptown community area. Location Argyle is situated on W. Argyle Street, close to the intersection with Broadway. The station is located in the West Argyle Street Historic District in the Uptown community area of Chicago; the area surrounding the station consists of a mixture commercial and residential areas, and is particularly noted for the high concentration of Vietnamese restaurants, bakeries and shops; as well as Chinese, Cambodian, Laotian, and Thai businesses. History The new embankment at Argyle Station in 1916 The site of Argyle station was first used as Argyle Park on the Chicago and Evanston branch of the Chicago, Milwaukee & St. Paul Railroad route, which opened on May 21, 1885. On opening, the station houses along the route were described as \\"attractive frame structures built in the Gothic and Queen Anne styles.\\" In 1908, the Northwestern Elevated Railroad was extended north from Wilson, using the tracks of the Chicago, Milwaukee & St. Paul Railroad, and a new station was constructed on the site of the previous depot. The station was again rebuilt to a design by architect Charles P. Rawson when the tracks between Wilson and Howard were elevated onto an embankment between 1914 and 1922. In 1979, the station received a $250,000 facelift and, in 1991, a Chinese-style hipped-and-gabled roof was added to the platform canopy. The station was closed for renovation from August 24 to October 5, 2012. Services A northbound train at Argyle station, July 2010 Argyle is part of CTA's Red Line, which runs from the northern city limits at Howard Street to downtown Chicago and 95th street. The station has an island platform on an embankment located between Broadway and Winthrop Avenue. It serves the Red Line's two tracks; the northbound track serves trains to Howard, while the southbound track serves trains to 95th. The station entrance is located on the north side of Argyle Street, built into the embankment. It is located between the Berwyn and Lawrence stations. Red Line trains serve Argyle 24 hours a day, every day of the year; trains operate roughly every 3 to 9 minutes during rush hour and midday operation, with longer headways of up to 15 minutes at night. The station is also located a block from the 36 Broadway bus. Red & Purple Modernization Project The Argyle station will be rebuilt as part of this project, The station will receive new wider platforms, new signage, new lights, new security cameras, and new elevators, reconstruction will begin in 2021 and will be completed by the end of 2024.http://loyolaphoenix.com/2019/10/despite-short-term-inconveniences-cta- project-expected-to-increase- accessibilityhttps://transitchicago.com/rpm/lawrmawr/  Notes and references = Notes  References = External links  *Argyle Station Page CTA official site *Argyle Street entrance from Google Maps Street View Category:CTA Red Line stations Category:Railway stations in the United States opened in 1908 Category:1908 establishments in Illinois ","title":"Argyle station (CTA)"},{"id":"4425859","text":"Club Mondo Bizarre ‚Äì For Members Only is the third album of the Austrian death metal band Pungent Stench. It was originally released in 1994 on Nuclear Blast. The lyrical subject matter has shifted from cannibalism to BDSM and other extreme forms of sexual acts. The album booklet shows various weird pornographic images that are slightly censored in black and white, but also a fully censored cover exists. Four songs had been put on the album as hidden tracks, being a karaoke version - i.e. without the main vocals. The idea was that fans could send their versions of the songs to the band and the best performances would appear on-stage with Pungent Stench. This never happened as the band fell apart shortly after this release. Musical style Pungent Stench toned down their extreme metal roots on their third record, similar to what Carcass did on Heartwork and Entombed on Wolverine Blues. A greater emphasis on clear-cut song structuring, melodic songwriting and slower tempos became evident. Pungent Stench's blues and rock and roll influences also became more pronounced on Club Mondo Bizarre.

The group is composed of MC d√§lek (vocals and producer) and Mike Manteca (aka Mike Mare) (electronics and producer). History The group originated in the New Jersey DIY scene of the mid-1990s, based around a studio lineup of D√§lek (Will Brooks), Oktopus (Alap Momin) and Joshua Booth. The group recorded and played live with several DJs, including DJ rEk on from 1998 to 2002, from 2002 and 2005 with still (Hsi- Chang Lin), and from 2006 to 2009 with Motiv. With this core, the group released four full-length LPs on Ipecac Recordings, and a string of EPs, singles and remixes on various independent labels. Booth left the group to complete his doctorate in 2009, and Oktopus had relocated to Berlin by 2010. D√§lek released a single LP, Untitled, with Brooks and Momin as the sole members, in 2011. From 2011 to 2015 the group was on permanent hiatus. In 2015, Brooks reunited with DJ rEk and D√§lek collaborator Mike Manteca (Destructo Swarmbots). In 2016 the group released a full-length LP Asphalt for Eden on Profound Lore Records. In December 2016, Ipecac Recordings announced that they had re-signed D√§lek. Their most recent album, Endangered Philosophies, was released in August 2017. Spyros Stasis of PopMatters described it as an 'enticing and alluring' mix of 'hip-hop, krautrock, noise and shoegaze'. Paul Simpson of AllMusic found it 'equally abrasive and hypnotic' and 'bracing yet beautiful'. D√§lek have often shared the stage with artists covering a wide range of genres, such as Godflesh, Isis, Prince Paul, The Melvins, Tool, De La Soul, RJD2, The Young Gods, Meat Beat Manifesto, Jesu, The Pharcyde, Grandmaster Flash, KRS-One, Dub Trio, Charles Hayward, Cult of Luna, Zu, Blackie, The Gaslamp Killer, Earth, The Dillinger Escape Plan, The Bug, Mastodon and Lovage. Oktopus and MC d√§lek collaborated with experimental metal/hardcore punk band Starkweather on their 2010 album This Sheltering Night. Style and influence D√§lek's music is dark, noisy and atmospheric, equally inspired by industrial music like Einst√ºrzende Neubauten, the layered noise of My Bloody Valentine and the dense sound collages of Public Enemy. Their sound is often constructed through sampling and a musical base atypical of most hip hop, making it difficult for people to classify their sound. They have been described as trip hop, glitch hop, metal, shoegaze, and hip hop, as well as being criticized for their broad range of sound.

It was originally released in 1997 through Nuclear Blast, two years after the band had split-up. The album, \\"which collected all the rare and unreleased Pungent Stench material available,\\" contains tracks from the band's early demo tapes, Mucous Secretion, and Extreme Deformity, which was released as the group's first EP in 1989. These \\"infamous\\" demos, along with a split-LP with Disharmonic Orchestra, caused a considerable amount of interest in the group, eventually leading them to sign a record deal with German label Nuclear Blast. The compilation comes in special packaging, which consists of a black box with the CD and a 24-page booklet containing all of Pungent Stench's releases, live shows and photos of the band that were taken from around the world. By this package, Jason Birchmeier of Allmusic praised the release stating, \\"Well packaged, Praise the Names of the Musical Assassins effectively sums up the group's early days when they were strictly a 'brutal splatter metal' group, before they would eventually slow down their music and write songs about sex rather than gore.\\" Birchmeier also defined Praise the Names of the Musical Assassins as a \\"suitable retrospective for one of the most notorious death metal bands of the 1990s.\\" Adam Wasylyk of Chronicles of Chaos webzine, gave the album a rating of 9 out of 10, stating that \\"Praise the Names of the Musical Assassins is composed of hard-to-find, rare and compilation tracks to serve almost as a 'best of,' a quality remembrance to one of Nuclear Blast's better bands.\\" Track listing All songs were written by Pungent Stench. # \\"Pulsating Protoplasma\\" ‚Äì 2:51 # \\"Dead Body Love\\" ‚Äì 4:00 # \\"Miscarriage\\" ‚Äì 2:20 # \\"In the Vault\\" ‚Äì 3:00 # \\"Rip You without Care\\" ‚Äì 3:40 # \\"Festered Offals\\" ‚Äì 2:54 # \\"Pungent Stench\\" ‚Äì 2:20 # \\"Extreme Deformity\\" ‚Äì 4:05 # \\"Mucous Secretion\\" ‚Äì 2:53 # \\"Molecular Disembowelment\\" ‚Äì 5:26 # \\"The Ballad of the Mangled Homeboys\\" ‚Äì 3:30 # \\"Daddy Cruel\\" ‚Äì 3:32 # \\"Tony\\" ‚Äì 4:05 # \\"Madcatmachopsychoromantik\\" ‚Äì 9:15 # \\"Extreme Deformity\\" ‚Äì 5:15 # \\"Festered Offals\\" ‚Äì 2:59 # \\"Pulsating Protoplasma\\" ‚Äì 2:41 # \\"Pungent Stench\\" ‚Äì 2:28 # \\"Embalmed in Sulphuric Acid\\" ‚Äì 1:58 Tracks 1‚Äì5 were taken from the split-LP with Disharmonic Orchestra; tracks 8‚Äì10 were taken from the Extreme Deformity 7-inch EP; tracks 6‚Äì7 and 11‚Äì14 were taken from various compilation appearances; tracks 15‚Äì19 were taken from the Mucous Secretion demo.

History The Times Square Theater was built in 1920 by the Selwyn brothers from a design by Eugene De Rosa.Building Age and National Builder Vol. 47, Nos. 7‚Äî12 (1925), p. 82.\\"Times Square and Apollo Theatres\\". Architecture and Building Vol. 52, No. 12 (December 1920), pp. 104-5. Online at Google Books. It was one of three theaters they built and controlled on 42nd Street, including the Apollo and the Selwyn. It opened on September 30, 1920, with Florence Reed starring in The Mirage.Woollcott, Alexander (October 1, 1920). \\"The Play\\". The New York Times.\\"The Week's New Plays\\". The New York Times (September 26, 1920) (photo of Florence Reed). G.K. Chesterton spoke on the topic \\"Shall We Abolish the Inevitable?\\" at the theater in 1921. Battling Butler, the basis for the Buster Keaton film of the same name, transferred from the Selwyn to the Times Square in 1924. Notable shows presented at the Times Square included the original New York productions of The Front Page by Hecht and MacArthur in 1928, George and Ira Gershwin's Strike Up the Band in 1930 and No√´l Coward's Private Lives starring Coward and Gertrude Lawrence in 1931. Only three years after Private Lives, the Times Square was converted to a cinema. It would remain in operation as a movie theater until the early 1990s, when it closed. The final scene of the 1980 motion picture Times Square was filmed at the Times Square Theater, with Robin Johnson's character performing a \\"midnight concert\\" atop the theater's marquee. The City and State of New York took possession of the Times Square Theater in 1990. In 1992, it was one of six 42nd Street theaters to come under the protection of the New 42nd Street organization. It was not immediately restored or renovated, as the theater lacks any entrances not directly on 42nd Street, rendering it more difficult to use for loading of scenery and props. Development proposals Since 1992, the theater has been the focus of a number of development proposals that were later abandoned. Canadian production company Live Entertainment Corporation of Canada briefly considered a redevelopment project in 1998. MTV and Marvel Mania also considered redeveloping the property. In 2005, the Times Square Theater was leased to Eck≈ç Unltd., which planned to make it a store for clothing and other urban youth market items. In 2009, the company walked away from its lease. In 2012, a group called Broadway 4D Theaters, LLC signed a long term lease to make the theater home to a \\"4D\\" film presentation called Broadway Sensation, dedicated to the history of Broadway. The presentation was to be produced by lawyer Robert Kory and producer/director Gary Goddard and the theater renovated to house it. The attraction was expected to open in spring 2015, however on May 28, 2014 it was reported that the project had been canceled due to financial troubles. In August 2015, Elie Samaha and Donald Kushner announced they purchased the assets of Broadway 4D Theaters and would continue the project. In March 2015, the New York Post reported that the British-based Ambassador Theatre Group, which controls the adjacent Lyric Theatre, was in negotiations to take over management of the building, converting it back into a Broadway theater after completing renovations. Later, in 2016, the Post reported speculation that Oracle Projects International of Singapore was interested in the theater as a space for special events. In fall 2018, developers announced the venue would be converted to retail space that would retain the proscenium, boxes, and many elements from the original structure. The work would take approximately two years at a cost of $100 million.

Massachusetts Archives Collection, Vol. 135, No. 9 Eunice Cole (c. 1590, England - October 1680, Hampton, New Hampshire, United States), maiden name unknown, was a woman from the coast of New Hampshire. Better known as \\"Goody Cole\\", she is the only woman convicted of witchcraft in New Hampshire.There is conflicting opinion about whether Cole was actually convicted. John Putnam Demos argues that she likely wasn't convicted because witchcraft was a capital crime and she was not executed (See Demos, p. 322; 494-496, nn. 48-49) but Carol Karlsen cites several instances of women who were convicted yet not executed (See Karlsen, p. 53; p. 283 nn. 21) Family Her husband was William Cole. There are no records of this union producing children, although since they came to this country when they were already well past childbearing age, it is certainly possible that they had children in England. Both of them were indentured servants of Matthew Craddock, a wealthy London merchant. After their service with Craddock was over, the Coles were released from Craddock's service and came to New England with their passage furnished, for ¬£10. In Boston they were granted of land in Mount Wollaston (now Quincy), Massachusetts on February 20, 1637, though they left for Exeter, New Hampshire, before the end of the year. Both of the Coles were followers of Reverend John Wheelwright, who believed in antinomianism. Very soon after, they moved to neighboring Hampton, New Hampshire, receiving a parcel of land. The house lot was situated slightly east of where the Baptist church stands today on Winnacunnet Road. The other was a good source of income, considering William Cole was a carpenter. William Cole died on May 26, 1662. Witchcraft accusations and death Cole was formally accused of witchcraft three times in her life, the first in Boston in 1656 when several townspeople testified against her. She was imprisoned until 1660, but was released until 1662 when she was returned to prison until sometime between 1668 and 1671. She was eventually acquitted, despite the \\"just ground of vehement suspicion\\" of her guilt. She was accused again in 1673, but acquitted, and once again in 1680, and although she was not indicted, she was still kept in prison.Karlsen, Carol F. pp. 52-57 in The Devil in the Shape of a Woman: Witchcraft in Colonial New England. W.W. Norton, New York, 1987. Upon her death in 1680, she was hastily buried in an unmarked grave in Hampton; its precise whereabouts are unknown, although it is believed to be near the site of today's Tuck Museum. Local legends suggest that a stake was driven into her body after her death \\"in order to exorcise the baleful influence she was supposed to have possessed,\\" and a horseshoe hung on the stake, just to be on the safe side. Goody Cole was much maligned - Hampton historian Joseph Dow referred to her as \\"ill-natured and ugly, artful and aggravating, malicious and revengeful\\" - but certainly not a witch. Such behaviour is unsurprising given the accusations leveled against her and her treatment by those in her community. Goody Cole in the 20th century In anticipation of the 300th anniversary of the town of Hampton in 1938, people organized in 1937 to clear Cole's name, forming \\"The Society in Hampton Beach for the Apprehension of Those Falsely Accusing Eunice (Goody) Cole of Having Familiarity With the Devil\\" ‚Äî usually shortened to \\"The Goody Cole Society\\"\\"Goody Cole Society Formed in 1937,\\" by William D. Cram, Boston Sunday Post, October 3, 1937 A doll in her image was made and sold locally. In 2003, a barbecue restaurant opened in Exeter with the name \\"Goody Cole's Smokehouse,\\" relocating in 2006 to Brentwood, New Hampshire. In 2013, the Progressive Rock project, Telergy (led by composer Robert McClung) released the album \\"The Legend of Goody Cole\\". Which tells the Goody Cole story using epic, classically inspired, progressive rock music. The album features a myriad of famous musicians, including Twisted Sister frontman Dee Snider. In literature John Greenleaf Whittier tells Cole's tale in his poem, Wreck at Rivermouth. See also *Margo Burns *Mount Wollaston Notes and referencesBibliography *Demos, John Putnam.

The novel takes place in St. Petersburg, Russia and Geneva, Switzerland and is viewed as Conrad's response to the themes explored in Crime and Punishment; Conrad was reputed to have detested Dostoevsky. It is also, some say, Conrad's response to his own early life; his father was a famous revolutionary imprisoned by the Russians, but, instead of following in his father's footsteps, at the age of sixteen Conrad left his native land, only to return briefly decades later. Indeed, while writing Under Western Eyes, Conrad suffered a weeks-long breakdown during which he conversed with the novel's characters in Polish. This novel is considered to be one of Conrad's major works and is close in subject matter to The Secret Agent. It is full of cynicism and conflict about the historical failures of revolutionary movements and ideals. Conrad remarks in this book, as well as others, on the irrationality of life, the opacity of character, the unfairness with which suffering is inflicted upon the innocent and poor and the careless disregard for the lives of those with whom we share existence. The book's first audience read it after the failed Russian Revolution of 1905. A second audience read it after the Russian Revolutions of 1917, which changed the reader's perception of the author's insight. Writing to Edward Garnett in 1911, Conrad said \\" ...in this book I am concerned with nothing but ideas, to the exclusion of everything else \\".Michael John DiSanto, Under Conrad's Eyes: The Novel as Criticism, p132, citing The Collected Letters of Joseph Conrad, vol IV, p489 Plot summary= Part First  The narrator, an English teacher of languages living in Geneva, is narrating the personal record of Kyrilo Sidorovitch Razumov. Razumov is a student in the University of St. Petersburg in the early 1910s. Razumov never knew his parents and has no family ties. He is trusted by his fellow students, many of whom hold revolutionary views, but Razumov takes no clear position on any of the great questions of his time because he considers all of Russia his family. (A better view, perhaps, would be to say that Razumov has no family to fall back on, feels isolated from his contemporaries, takes no interest in the \\"great issues\\" of the day, and merely seeks a middle-class secure position within the Czarist system ‚Äì thus, very ironically, he sees \\"all Russia\\" as his \\"family.\\") One night, Mr. de P‚Äî, the brutal Minister of State, is assassinated by a team of two, but the bombs used also claim the lives of his footman, the first assassin and a number of bystanders. Razumov enters his rooms to find Victor Haldin, a fellow student. Haldin tells Razumov that he was the one who murdered Mr. de P‚Äî, but that he and his accomplice did not make a proper escape plan. He requests Razumov's help because he trusts him, even though he realises that they do not quite belong in the same camp. Razumov agrees to help, if only to get Haldin out of his flat. Haldin tasks him with finding Ziemianitch, who was supposed to help Haldin escape. Haldin's request launches Razumov into a deep identity crisis. He feels that his life will be destroyed by the authorities simply because of his association with Haldin. Consequently he becomes intensely aware of his social isolation and lack of family ties. Harbouring no sympathy for Haldin's actions or his ideals, Razumov is brought closer to conservatism out of the simple fear to survive. He seeks out Ziemianitch and, when he finds him, drunk and incapacitated, beats him. Afterwards he makes up his mind to betray Haldin to save his own life and turns to his university sponsor, Prince K. They go to the chief of police, General T‚Äî. Then a trap is laid for Haldin. Razumov returns to his apartment and attempts to explain his predicament to Haldin while concealing the fact that he has just betrayed him. Haldin leaves and, later that night, is caught. Razumov is distressed for days after Haldin's capture. In his apartment, he writes down a set of political principles which paint him as a reformist and not a revolutionary. Finally, he receives a summons to the police headquarters and meets Privy Councillor Mikulin. In a scene reminiscent of Crime and Punishment, Razumov is highly paranoid that Mikulin suspects him of being a revolutionary. Mikulin reveals that Haldin was interrogated, sentenced and hanged the same day without implicating Razumov. Mikulin also reveals that he supervised a search of Razumov's quarters and was impressed by his manifesto. Razumov attempts to leave, but Mikulin makes him pause. Part Second The narrative shifts to Haldin's sister, Natalia, and their mother, Mrs Haldin, who live in Switzerland after Haldin persuaded them to sell their house in Russia and move. Having lived in Zurich for a while, they then settle in Geneva, which has a vibrant Russian community. There, they wait for Haldin. Natalia has been friendly with the narrator for some time from whom she receives English lessons. One day, the narrator chances upon the news of Haldin's arrest and execution in an English newspaper, and tells Natalia and her mother. Natalia takes the news stoically but her mother is deeply distressed. Peter Ivanovitch, a leader in the revolutionary movement, having learnt of Haldin's execution, meets with Natalia and attempts to recruit her, but Natalia is sceptical and noncommittal. He also tells her that Razumov is about to arrive in Geneva, which excites Natalia, as Haldin had described him in glowing terms in his letters. Natalia is invited to the Chateau Borel, a big, neglected house that Madame de S‚Äî rents from the widow of an Italian banker, and meets Tekla, the abused companion of Madame de S‚Äî and secretary to Peter Ivanovitch. Tekla recounts her life story. Afterwards, they come upon Peter Ivanovitch and Razumov. Peter Ivanovitch leaves and Natalia introduces herself to Razumov, who feel compassion for her. Tekla, like most of the characters whom Razumov encounters, misinterprets his taciturn cynicism ‚Äì which is in fact motivated by his hatred for the entire situation he has fallen into ‚Äì as the expression of a true revolutionist, and pledges her help to him, even to the point of leaving Madame de S- and Peter Ivanovitch. Part Third The narrative shifts back to a few weeks earlier and describes how Razumov arrived in Geneva, having first stayed in Zurich for three days with Sophia Antonovna, the right hand of Peter Ivanovitch. Razumov did not further seek Peter Ivanovitch after their first meeting but instead took long walks with Natalia, where she took him into her confidence and asked about her brother's last hours, to which Razumov gave no definite answer. Razumov is abrasive towards the narrator, who detects a deep distress under Razumov's exterior. He is invited to the Chateau Borel, where he is received on friendly terms, as Madame de S‚Äî and Peter Ivanovitch think that he was a collaborator of Haldin. In fact, Razumov has gone to Geneva, working as a spy for the Russian government. His taciturnity and reserve are interpreted by each character in their own way. The revolutionaries reveal some of their plans to Razumov and he is given his first assignment: to bring Natalia to Peter Ivanovitch so he can convert her, as Peter Ivanovitch cherishes female followers above everything else. Razumov then meets Sophia Antonovna and comes to see her as his most dangerous adversary because of her single-mindedness and perception. Suppressing his distress, he manages to deceive her. Sophia Antonovna reveals that Ziemianitch hanged himself soon after Haldin's execution, which makes the revolutionaries believe that he was the one who betrayed Haldin. Part Fourth The narrative shifts back to Razumov's initial interview with Mikulin. Mikulin admits having read Razumov's private notes but reassures him that he is not suspicious of him. After telling Razumov that some of the best Russian minds ultimately returned to them (referring to Dostoevsky, Gogol and Aksakov), he lets him go. Razumov spends the next few weeks in an increasing state of malaise where he alienates his fellow students and professors. In the meantime, Mikulin has received a promotion and sees an opportunity to use Razumov. He summons him to further interviews where he recruits him, with the blessings of Prince K., to act as a secret agent for the Czarist authorities of the Russian Empire. The narrative shifts to Geneva, where Razumov is writing his first report to Mikulin. On his way to the post office, the narrator comes upon him, but Razumov takes no notice of him. The narrator goes to Natalia's flat, only to learn that Natalia must find Razumov urgently and bring him to her distraught mother, as she needs to meet the only friend of Haldin that she knows. The professor and Natalia go to the Cosmopolitan Hotel to ask Peter Ivanovitch where Razumov stays. There, they find the revolutionaries preparing an insurgency in the Baltic provinces. They visit Razumov's lodgings but do not find him. They then return to Natalia's quarters where Razumov has unexpectedly visited her mother. After a long conversation with Natalia in which Razumov makes several obscure and cryptic remarks, and Natalia asks how her brother spent his last hours, Razumov implies that he was the one who betrayed him. Razumov retires to his quarters where he writes his record. He explains to Natalia that he fell in love with her as soon as she took him into her confidence, that he had never been shown any kind of love before, and that he felt he had betrayed himself by betraying her brother. He mails the record to Natalia and goes to the house of Julius Laspara where a social gathering of revolutionaries is taking place. Razumov declares to the crowd that Ziemianitch was innocent and explains his motives only partially, but confesses that he was the one who betrayed Haldin. Some revolutionaries, led by Necator, attack him and smash his eardrums. A deaf Razumov is crushed by a tramcar and crippled. Tekla finds him and stays by his side at the hospital. A few months pass and Mrs Haldin has died. Natalia has returned to Russia to devote herself to charity work after giving Razumov's record to the narrator. Tekla has taken the invalid Razumov to the Russian countryside, where she looks after him. Major characters * Kyrilo Sidorovitch Razumov: Razumov is a student in the University of St. Petersburg, a hotbed of revolutionary activity at the time. He is described as a serious young man, studious and hard working. He survives on a modest allowance provided by Prince K., his sponsor. Having known no family, he considers all of Russia his family. Handsome and aristocratic in appearance, he inspires trust in people by his obliging manner and attentive listening. His ultimate ambition before de P‚Äî's assassination was to become a professor or a Privy Councillor. Deeply aware of the fact that he has no meaningful connections to anyone, he relies on his hard work as a means of advancement. Razumov is held in high esteem by the Geneva revolutionaries because they think he was a collaborator of Haldin. In fact, after Haldin's arrest, Razumov is nerve-wracked and paranoid. He holds the revolutionaries in contempt and often makes sarcastic sneers, something that confuses them. He falls in love with Natalia Haldin but having never known neither love nor family, his identity crumbles, and he finally confesses to her that he betrayed her brother. * Victor Victorovich Haldin: A fellow student of Razumov, he assassinates Mr de P., but several innocent bystanders are killed as well. With his escape plan compromised, he breaks into Razumov's rooms and asks for his help. Haldin is highly idealistic but has mistaken Razumov's studiousness and thoughtfulness for trustworthiness. He does not realise that placing Razumov into an impossible situation can have unpredictable consequences for him. Haldin mentions an uncle who was executed under Nicholas I. * Natalia Victorovna Haldin: The independent-minded and sincere sister of Victor Haldin, she is not impressed by Peter Ivanovitch. She is described as \\"full-figured\\" with \\"trustful eyes\\". She has a confident manner and a reputation for liberalism. She was educated in an institute for women (women were not easily allowed to study at university) where she was looked upon unfavourably because of her views. Both mother and daughter were later placed under surveillance in their country place. Natalia thinks that by befriending Razumov, she will stay faithful to the spirit of her brother, as he had described Razumov in his letters as possessing a \\"lofty, unstained and solitary\\" existence. She is suspicious of the circumstances of Haldin's capture, as she thinks he would have had an escape plan. * Peter Ivanovitch: The bombastic leader of the revolutionaries, Ivanovitch served in the Guards when he was young. He is very popular in Russia but lives in Geneva sponsored by Madame de S‚Äî and constantly flatters her. In his autobiography, he recounts how he was imprisoned in Russia and made a dramatic escape to the Pacific coast with the help of a woman. He is considered a revolutionary feminist but regularly mistreats Tekla and is a profligate author of numerous books. In the end, Peter Ivanovitch is portrayed as ineffectual, having allowed not one but two informers in his circle. When Madame de S‚Äî dies, she leaves none of her fortune to Peter Ivanovitch, who marries a peasant girl and moves back to Russia, but he is still deeply admired by his believers. Peter Ivanovitch is mainly based on Mikhail Bakunin, while his feminist theories seem inspired from Fyodor Dostoevsky (in his \\"Notes from the Underground\\" (1864), part 2, chapter 1, there is a reference to this name). Also in Tolstoi's \\"The Death of Ivan Ilyich\\" (1886) there is a character with the same name, referred since the first page. Actually there was a Russian ambassador for the US, from 1817 to 1822, named Pyotr Ivanovich Poletika (1778‚Äì1849). * Sophia Antonovna: The right hand of Peter Ivanovitch, Antonovna is an old revolutionary who is held in high regard because she is being trusted by Peter Ivanovitch with carrying out \\"certain most important things\\". She is the daughter of a clever but unlucky artisan, who was brutally exploited by his masters and died at fifty. She, therefore, became a revolutionary despite her youth. She is quick to see that Razumov is not particularly impressed with them. Razumov views her as \\"the true spirit of destructive revolution\\" because she is devoid of the mysticism and rhetoric of Ivanovitch. He makes serious efforts in deceiving her and takes pleasure when he succeeds. In the end, Antonovna admits to the narrator that she bears a grudging respect for Razumov because he confessed of his own volition and from a position of safety. * Tekla: The dame de compagnie of Madame de S‚Äî, Tekla was the daughter of a clerk in the Finance Ministry. Distressed by seeing her family living on a government salary when half of Russia was starving, she left them at a young age to live with revolutionaries where she went through great hardship. As a result, she has sustained a hatred of Finance Ministries and has done odd jobs for revolutionaries. She takes dictation from the psychologically abusive Ivanovitch. Razumov notes that Tekla is perpetually terrified in the presence of Madame de S‚Äî and Peter Ivanovitch. At the end of the novel, she takes a crippled Razumov back to Russia and looks after him. It has been suggested that Conrad was influenced by the legend of Saint Thecla to create Tekla. Minor characters * The narrator: A passive, obscure teacher of languages. Conrad often uses that device to elaborate his views on Russia. He wishes to advise Natalia but because he is old and a Westerner, he feels the gap between them is too big for Natalia to listen to him. * Mrs Haldin: The world-weary old mother of Victor and Natalia, she becomes suspicious when she does not receive news of Victor for some time after Mr. de P‚Äî's assassination. After she learns of his execution, she falls ill. When she learns of Razumov, she wants to meet him. In the end of the novel, she dies. She is described as having had a fine, lucid intellect in her youth. * Prince K.: A Russian aristocrat and ex- Guardsman who acts as Razumov's sponsor, it is also implied he is Razumov's father. Before P‚Äôs assassination Razumov had met him only once, when he was summoned to the office of an obscure attorney, and Prince K. encouraged him to do well in his studies and shook his hand. He is married to an aristocratic lady, who has a temper and is rumoured to beat him. Razumov turns to Prince K. for help after he finds Haldin in his room, having no other person to rely on. Prince K is angry at first but afterwards takes Razumov to General T‚Äî and clarifies that Razumov is not involved in revolutionary activity. * Privy Councillor Gregory Gregorievitch/Matvievitch Mikulin: The subtle Head of Department at the Secretariat General, he is the right hand of General T‚Äî. He subjects Razumov to several interviews, successfully trying to recruit him to act as an informer for the Czarist authorities against the revolutionaries. He does this partly for his own reasons, as he views Razumov as a tool that he can use after he receives a promotion to general supervisor over European operations. A hedonistic and greatly influential official. He meets his end a few years after the events of the novel as the consequence of a state trial. * General T‚Äî: Modelled after Fyodor Trepov, General T‚Äî is a high official in the Secretariat General of the Ministry of Interior of the police secretariat, to whom Razumov betrays Haldin's escape plan. General T‚Äî is initially suspicious of Razumov, but his mind is set at ease by Prince K., who vouches for Razumov's character. He believes that the structure of society is based on fidelity to institutions, and he has a deep hatred of revolutionaries that he describes as natural. * Mr de P‚Äî: The brutal and repressive Minister of State in the Czarist government. Fanatical and single-minded, he imprisoned, exiled or condemned to execution revolutionaries of every age and gender. He does not believe in liberty and justifies this using religion. He is assassinated by Haldin in a scene based on the real-life assassination of Vyacheslav von Plehve. * Baroness Eleanora Maximovna de S‚Äî: The pretentious widow of a Russian diplomat, she left Russia some years before the events of the novel because she was suspected of having had foreknowledge of the assassination of Alexander II of Russia. She is an ardent believer in Ivanovich and met him when he was serving in the Guards as a young man, and she supports him financially in Geneva. Razumov describes her as looking like a \\"galvanised corpse\\". She is described as greedy, avaricious and unscrupulous by the narrator. * Nikita Necator: A brutal revolutionary assassin, Necator is responsible for numerous murders and has a fearsome reputation. Fat to the point of obesity, he is greatly excited by violence. He cripples Razumov near the end of the novel by smashing his eardrums. In the end, Councillor Mikulin informs Ivanovitch in a chance meeting in Russia that Necator had been a double agent all along, providing information to the Russian authorities. Razumov was apparently aware of this as he taunted Necator before he was attacked. He bears many similarities to the historical double agent Yevno Azev. Publication history The novel was initially published in 1911, when the failed revolution of 1905 in Russia was history. Conrad started work on the novel soon after his fiftieth birthday. In this version \\"Razumov\\", the story that would become Under Western Eyes, over the next two years, was intended to extend and rework ideas in the plot of The Secret Agent.The Collected Letters of Joseph Conrad, vol. III, p.513. When Conrad finally delivered the completed manuscript to his agent at the end of January 1910, the occasion itself proved explosive and led to a breach in relation that lasted two years. J.B. Pinker, to whom Conrad was very heavily in debt, seems to have lost patience with his author's pace of work and precipitated a quarrel. Shortly after a heated exchange, Conrad collapsed, his doctor diagnosing \\"a complete nervous breakdown\\" that had \\"been coming for months\\".The Collected Letters of Joseph Conrad, vol. IV, p.321, note 1. Describing her husband's breakdown, Jessie Conrad wrote: \\"he lives mixed up in the scenes and hold converse with the characters\\" of Under Western Eyes. Elsewhere she recalls how Conrad, in delirium, \\"spoke all the time in Polish, but for a few fierce sentences against poor J.B. Pinker\\" His delusions apparently included symptoms of persecution mania. In 1920, Conrad wrote an Author's Note for this novel, reflecting on its changed perception due to events of history, specifically the Russian Revolution of 1917. He said \\"It must be admitted that by the mere force of circumstances Under Western Eyes has become already a sort of historical novel dealing with the past.\\" The novel is fundamentally connected to Russian history. Its first audience read it against the backdrop of the failed Revolution of 1905 and in the shadow of the movements and impulses that would take shape as the revolutions of 1917. Despite Conrad's protestations that Dostoevsky was \\"too Russian for me\\" and that Russian literature generally was \\"repugnant to me hereditarily and individually\\",The Collected Letters of Joseph Conrad, vol. V, p.70, vol. VII, p.615 critics have long discerned the influence of Crime and Punishment on this work. Adaptations The novel was adapted into a film in 1936; and into a full-length opera by John Joubert in 1969, first performed by New Opera Company at Sadler's Wells Theatre in London. It was also adopted into a stageplay that premiered at Teatr Polski in Warsaw on June 8, 2018.

Moheyan (Êë©Ë®∂Ë°ç) is a brief translation of Mahayana in Chinese, so the name literally means a Mahayana monk. He became famous for representing Chan Buddhism in the so called \\"Council of Lhasa,\\" a debate between adherents of the Indian teachings of \\"gradual enlightenment\\" and the Chinese teachings of \\"sudden enlightenment,\\" which according to tradition was won by the \\"gradual teachings.\\" Etymology Hvashang is a Tibetan approximation of the Chinese h√©shang \\"Buddhist monk (). This, in turn, comes from the Sanskrit title upƒÅdhyƒÅya \\"teacher\\".Chua, Ying (1998), Arhats. (accessed: January 14, 2008)] Biography=Dunhuang sojourn Whilst the East Mountain Teachings (known as the \\"Northern School\\" Chan) were in decline, having been attacked by Shenhui (a student of Huineng) as a supposed \\"gradual enlightenment\\" teaching, Moheyan traveled to Dunhuang, which at the time belonged to the Tibetan Empire, in 781 or 787. For Moheyan, this was a new opportunity for the spread of (Northern) Chan. Council of Lhasa The main building of Samye After teaching in the area of Dunhuang, Moheyan was invited by Trisong Detsen of the Tibetan Empire to settle at Samye, then the center of emerging Tibetan Buddhism.Sam van Schaik (2008), Tibetan Chan I: The Emperor's Chan Moheyan promulgated a variety of Chan Buddhism and disseminated teachings from Samye where he attracted a considerable number of followers. However, in 793 Trisong Detsen resolved that Moheyan did not hold the true Dharma. Following intense protests from Moheyan‚Äôs supporters, Trisong Detsen proposed to settle the matter by sponsoring a debate. The most famous of these debates has become known as the \\"Council of Lhasa\\", although it may have taken place at Samye, a considerable distance from Lhasa. For the famed Council of Lhasa, an Indian monk named Kamala≈õƒ´la was invited to represent Indian Buddhism, while Moheyan represented East Mountain Teachings and Chinese Buddhism. While Moheyan took a subitist approach to enlightenment, his position was weakened when conceding that practices such as the perfection of morality, studying the sutras and teachings of the masters, and cultivating meritorious actions were appropriate. These types of actions were seen as part of the \\"gradualist\\" school, and Moheyan held that these were only necessary for those of \\"dim\\" facility and \\"dull\\" propensity. Those of \\"sharp\\" and \\"keen\\" facility and propensity do not need these practices, as they have \\"direct\\" access to the truth through meditation. This concession to the \\"gradualists\\", that not everyone can achieve the highest state of meditation, left Moheyan open to the charge that he had a dualistic approach to practice. To overcome these inconsistencies in his thesis, Moheyan claimed that when one gave up all conceptions, an automatic, all-at-once attainment of virtue resulted. He taught that there was an \\"internal\\" practice to gain insight and liberate one- self, and an \\"external\\" practice to liberate others (upaya, or skillful means). These were seen as two independent practices, a concession to human psychology and scriptural tradition. Most Tibetan sources state that the debate was decided in Kamala≈õƒ´la's favour (though many Chinese sources claim Moheyan won) and Moheyan was required to leave the country and that all sudden-enlightenment texts were gathered and destroyed by royal decree. This was a pivotal event in the history of Tibetan Buddhism, which would afterward continue to follow the late Indian model with only minor influence from China. Nevertheless, Chan texts were produced until the 10th century in Tibet, which casts doubt on these Tibetan sources. Teachings=Sudden teachings Moheyan‚Äôs teachings were a mixture of the East Mountain Teachings associated with Yuquan Shenxiu and Baotang Chan. Broughton gives the following nomenclature: The dichotomy of the gradual north and sudden south is a historical construction, as both Northern and Southern Schools contained \\"gradualist teachings\\" and \\"sudden teachings\\" and practices. Liberation from vikalpa-citta G≈çmez gives a detailed account of the doctrinary differences that were at stake at the \\"council of Lhasa\\", based on Buton Rinchen Drub's Chos-'yun, which in turn may have been based on Kamala≈õƒ´la's Third BhƒÅvanƒÅkrama. Buton Rinchen Drub had chosen two points to summarize the conflict, which entails complex doctrinal and historical issues. Most of what is known of Moheyan‚Äôs teaching comes from fragments of writings in Chinese and Tibetan found in the Mogao Caves of Dunhuang (now in Gansu, China). The manuscript given the appellation IOL Tib J 709 is a collection of nine Chan texts, commencing with the teachings of Moheyan. According to Buton Rinchen Drub, the conflict centered around two theses set out by Moheyan: # \\"As long as one carries out good or evil acts, one is not free from transmigration.\\" # \\"Whoever does not think of anything, whoever does not reflect, will be totally free from transmigration. Not thinking, not pondering, non-examination, non- apprehension of an object - this is the immediate access [to liberation].\\" yet, a principal point of Moheyan's teaching is that according to Moheyan, the root cause of samsara is the creation of false distinctions, vikalpa-citta. As long as these false distinctions are being created, one is bound to samsara. =Good and evil acts= According to Buton Rinchen Drub, Moheyan taught that carrying out good or evil acts binds one to transmigration. Moheyan's point is that the concept of good or false is itself still conceptual thinking, which obscures enlightenment. If all thought, good or bad, obscures enlightenment, then all actions must be based on the simplest principles of conduct. To achieve proper conduct, all conceptions, without exception should be seen as false: =Not-thinking= Sam van Schaik notes that Moheyan \\"didn‚Äôt advocate the suppression of thoughts,\\" but rather advised, in his own words: By practicing dhyana, awareness should be reverted toward this awareness itself: By turning the attention inward, one discovers that no \\"self-nature\\" can be found in the movements of the mind. Eventually, dhyana leads to the realisation that awareness is empty, and cannot be grasped by concepts: Influence The teachings of Moheyan and other Chan masters were unified with the Kham Dzogchen (\\"Great Perfection\\") lineages through the Kunkhyen (Tibetan for \\"omniscient\\"), Rongzom Chokyi Zangpo. The Dzogchen of the Nyingma was often identified with the subitist (\\"sudden enlightenment\\") of Moheyan, and was called to defend itself against this charge by avowed members of the Sarma lineages that held to the staunch view of \\"gradual enlightenment\\" Iconography According to Ying Chua, Moheyan is often iconographically depicted holding a shankha (Sanskrit) and a mala (Sanskrit): An iconographic thangka depiction of Moheyan is held in the Southern Alleghenies Museum of Art (SAMA) collection, St. Francis College, Loretto, Pennsylvania.Kaladarshan Arts See also * Ch√∂d NotesReferencesSources=Printed sources    Web-sources=External links * Moheyan (undated). * Moheyan (undated). * Sam van Schaik (2008), Tibetan Chan II: the teachings of Heshang Moheyan * Sam van Schaik (2008, Tibetan Chan III: more teachings of Heshang Moheyan * Vladimir K., On Thoughts in Zazen Category:Tibetan Buddhism Category:Tang dynasty Buddhist monks Category:Chan Buddhist monks Category:Rangtong-Shentong ","title":"Moheyan"},{"id":"4426002","text":"The National Association of Congregational Christian Churches (NACCC) is an association of about 400 churches providing fellowship for and services to churches from the Congregational tradition. The Association maintains its national office in Oak Creek, Wisconsin, a suburb of Milwaukee. The body was founded in 1955 by former clergy and laypeople of the Congregational Christian Churches in response to that denomination's pending merger with the Evangelical and Reformed Church to form the United Church of Christ in 1957. The NACCC has congregations in 39 states, with concentrations in California, Connecticut, Illinois, Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan, and Wisconsin. History First Congregational Church, an NACCC church in Ceredo, West Virginia. The NACCC belongs to the American Congregationalist tradition, which originated as part of the English Puritan movement, which was strongly influenced by Calvinism. By the early 20th century, Congregational churches affiliated with the National Council of Congregational Churches and participated in that body's 1931 merger with the General Convention of the Christian Church, which created the General Council of Congregational Christian Churches. The churches that eventually formed the NACCC opposed subsequent initiatives to merge the Congregational Christian Churches with the Evangelical and Reformed Church to form the United Church of Christ. Central to their opposition was the belief that the merger would create unwieldy bureaucracies that might impinge upon the historic freedom of the local congregation, one of the few ideas that have united this otherwise theologically diverse fellowship. These concerns drove activists, beginning after World War II when talks between the national entities of the two merging denominations reached the point of preliminary organization planning, to persuade local Congregational Christian churches to refuse their support to this movement. These clergy and laypeople first organized at a meeting in Evanston, Illinois, in 1947 to express their concerns about not only the possible loss of autonomy on behalf of individual churches, but also their contentions that the General Council of the CC Churches possessed no authority to enter its churches into any legal union with another denomination. Other related issues were control over missionary funds and a possible diversion of some of them into ministerial pension annuities; fears of imposition of creeds, confessions, and neo-orthodox theology onto their ministers (who generally favored a 19th-century liberal, tolerant outlook); and ownership of church property in cases of congregations withdrawing from the proposed UCC. When the CC national General Council adopted a \\"Basis of Union\\" with the E&R; Church in 1948, the dissenters organized into two groups: the Committee for the Continuation of Congregational Christian Churches, formed by the pastor of Los Angeles' Congregational Church of the Messiah, Harry R. Butman; and the League to Uphold Congregational Principles, led by a Hartford, Connecticut pastor, Henry Gray. These two groups conducted an extensive pamphlet and church-meeting campaign to forestall the merger process, despite the General Council's and the E&R; General Synod's revision of the Basis in favor of explicit congregational autonomy. Their counterpart on the pro-UCC side of the denominational merger debate was the then-current CC general minister and president, Douglas Horton. When these efforts only produced a small minority of sympathizers, some \\"continuing\\" clergy and laypeople in a Brooklyn congregation decided to take legal action, suing CC moderator Helen Kenyon in 1949, in order to place a legal restraint on the process. Some years later, after appellate courts reversed the lower court's finding in favor of the merger opponents, the activists turned instead to forming a new fellowship, with no legal claims to any portion of the assets of the majority. Representatives from 102 U.S. congregational churches met at a Detroit hotel in 1955 to organize the NACCC as an alternative to joining the UCC. Because the existing denominational organization was being transferred to the UCC, the NACCC started out without any funds, staff, or organizational structure. Dr. Harry Johnson of Idaho, who previously been superintendent of the Intermountain Conference of the Congregational Christian Churches, became its first Executive Secretary in 1956. He was succeeded in 1959 by the Rev. Neil Swanson, minister of a church in Wauwatosa, Wisconsin. Under Swanson's leadership, the first denominational office was established in Milwaukee. The NACCC moved into its own newly built headquarters building in Oak Creek in 1973. All Congregational-heritage colleges except for Piedmont College in Georgia approved the UCC merger, which finally took place in 1957. Piedmont joined the UCC in the early 2000s while keeping its NACCC affiliation. Current ethos and practices During the 1960s through the 1990s, the NACCC slowly built a network of, or formed alliances with, voluntarily-supported missions and agencies to replace those lost in the UCC merger. One distinction between the NACCC and UCC is the former body's refusal to engage in political activity on behalf of its constituent churches. By its governing ethos, the NACCC refrains from taking political positions of any kind. The NACCC's commitment to local church autonomy is so pronounced, that it has adopted a highly unusual measure in its national legislative process. Congregations taking exception to measures passed by the NACCC's annual meeting may seek a referendum vote in order to have the legislation vetoed. This appears to be a unique practice not found in any other American Protestant denomination. In terms of the ministry, the NACCC, again, respects local autonomy to the point of refusing to keep a membership list for those clergy serving its churches, although the denomination's annual yearbook provides a list of known pastors for convenient reference. Ordination by a local church is sufficient for recognition by this tradition; clergy from other congregations may participate in the ordination service at their discretion, but their presence conveys no special authority over the procedure, as is the case with an association and/or conference in the UCC. Regional associations in the NACCC are strictly for the purpose of fellowship and mutual edification; like the national entity, they have no authority whatsoever over their member congregations. Also, unlike the UCC, there is no necessary relationship between a regional association and the NACCC. In fact, a congregation can belong to the NACCC without simultaneously belonging to a regional group. By contrast, in the UCC, a church must hold membership in the association covering its geographic territory before participating in the affairs of its conference and the General Synod. Further, unlike the UCC where congregations have no direct representation in the General Synod, each NACCC congregation may send its clergy and delegate to the national annual meeting. The NACCC does not have organizational affiliations with interdenominational organizations such as the National Council of Churches and the World Council of Churches. It did not participate in the Consultation on Church Union. Relationships with other Congregational bodies Another Congregational denomination whose member churches mostly stayed out of the UCC, the Conservative Congregational Christian Conference, came into being not primarily because of church governance disputes, but because of decades-long opposition to the dominant liberal theological orientation in the main part of American Congregationalism. Founded in 1948, the CCCC (or \\"4C's\\", colloquially) had no relation to the \\"continuing\\" movement per se, although some congregations may belong to both bodies simultaneously. The body requires its member churches to subscribe to, as its name implies, a standard evangelical statement of faith; neither the NACCC nor the UCC requires its congregations to adhere to any specific doctrinal position. In fact, some NACCC congregations have actually retained nominal ties to the UCC, via the latter's listing of special \\"schedule\\" categories of membership. Resulting from the submission of the UCC Constitution and Bylaws to each individual Congregational Christian church for approval (a condition of membership to all UCC associations and conferences), those congregations who did not vote at all or voted disapproval but who did not take action to withdraw from their associations (or conferences, in the absence of associations) remained listed in that denomination's yearbook. As of 2011, 95 churches continue to hold this status in the UCC, although not all of them are NACCC members. Some NACCC churches, though, are simultaneously full members of the UCC.

He was one of two deputies elected in 1788 by the L√©on assembly of clergy to represent them at the Estates-General convened by Louis XVI. At the National Constituent Assembly, Expilly was president of the Ecclesiastical Committee working on the Civil Constitution of the Clergy, which in 1790 reorganised the Church in France, notably by creating one diocese per d√©partement. The Constitution also stated that bishops should in future be elected, not appointed by the Vatican. On 30 September 1790 the Bishop of Cornouaille (also known as the Bishop of Quimper) died. His successor would be the first bishop to be chosen by the new constitutional rules. On 1 November, the electoral body for Finist√®re was convened at Quimper Cathedral despite opposition from the cathedral chapter. Under Canon law, the chapter or one of their number could act as bishop until a new one was appointed. In a third round of voting, Expilly was supported by 233 of the 380 electors while 125 votes went to the Bishop of L√©on, Monsignor Jean-Fran√ßois de La Marche, in exile in London as a dissenter from the new Civil Constitution, and known as a refractory priest.Refractory priests or refractaires, also called non-jureurs (non-jurors or non-oath-takers) were priests who would not promise to uphold the new Civil Constitution of the Clergy. Expilly was proclaimed the first constitutional bishop of France. Church traditionalists would not support an elected bishop and so there was no-one to consecrate him. The Archbishop of Rennes refused, and in the end, Expilly had to go to Paris to be made a bishop by Talleyrand, the revolutionary Bishop of Autun. The consecration eventually took place on 24 February 1791. In April 1791, Pope Pius VI issued an encyclical condemning Expilly and Talleyrand.Encyclical of Pope Pius VI Charitas (On The Civil Oath In France) promulgated on 13 April 1791: \\"They had received no commission to do so from the Apostolic See; they omitted the oath of obedience to the Pope; they neglected the examination and confession of faith which are prescribed in the Roman pontifical which should be observed universally; and they broke and despised all laws. They did this even though they must have known that the former candidate had been wrongly elected bishop of Quimper against the serious and repeated objections of the Chapter...\\" Expilly was connected with the Girondist Commission des douze (Committee of Twelve), a group which stirred up opposition by a vigorous campaign of arresting \\"conspirators\\". He was imprisoned in June 1793, but released in August after modifying his position. However, he did not survive much longer. On 22 May 1794 he was guillotined in Brest, the last person executed that day as he had been giving absolution to his fellows waiting at the scaffold. There would be no Bishop of Quimper/Cornouaille for the next four years.

Gannascoli"},{"id":"4426054","text":"Hobbes is one of the two main characters in the comic strip Calvin and Hobbes by Bill Watterson. He is Calvin's stuffed tiger and best friend, being depicted with two distinct identities. Hobbes' personality Hobbes is seen in two differentiating perspectives. Calvin perceives him as a live tiger and a best friend, capable of speech and independent action. To everybody else, he is an inanimate stuffed tiger. Hobbes is often shown to be smarter and wiser than Calvin when he is perceived as a real tiger. He is seen reading more often than his owner and attempts to be the voice of reason when Calvin tries to perform a risky stunt or engage in a dubious scheme. Hobbes' advice often falls on deaf ears with Calvin, who usually ignores his reasoning and winds up getting in trouble for his actions. Because of this, some fans say that Hobbes represents Calvin's conscience. However, Hobbes is shown as terrible at math and spelling, quite possibly worse than Calvin himself, seemingly reflective of Calvin's own limitation. He is named after Thomas Hobbes, a philosopher who at times had a bleak outlook on life and human nature. When Hobbes is shown to be alive, he is proud of his species and glad not to be a human, showing that when Hobbes comes to life, he too believes he is a real tiger. Relationship with Calvin For the most part, Calvin and Hobbes converse and play together, reveling in what is ultimately a deep friendship and almost brotherly relationship. Hobbes acts as a philosophical foil to Calvin; where Calvin is preoccupied with predestination and dreams of grandeur, Hobbes is a much more realistic thinker; he is much more focused on the present and the simple pleasant things in life. A prime example is a strip in which the two talk about what they would do with a wish; Calvin makes it clear that he'd want material things, while Hobbes wishes for a simple sandwich. In the final strip, he is eating a sandwich, and points out that he got his wish. Later Calvin asks Hobbes \\"If you could wish for anything, what would it be?\\", and he replies \\"A big sunny field to be in\\", something he already has. They also frequently argue or even fight with each other, though their disagreements are generally short-lived. Hobbes often beats up Calvin with an energetic pounce- and-tackle attack, which leaves Calvin bruised and scraped up but not seriously harmed. Hobbes takes great pleasure in his demonstrations of feline prowess, while Calvin expresses keen frustration at his inability to stop the attacks or explain his injuries to his skeptical parents. Hobbes is proud to be an animal and seems to have a low opinion of humans in general (when Calvin is wondering why people exist, Hobbes simply responds \\"tiger food\\"), and Calvin claims that he once ate a kid in his school named Tommy Chesnutt for making fun of Calvin bringing Hobbes to school. Hobbes is shown to be an enthusiastic, if not particularly talented, artist, a trait which he shares with Calvin, though to a lesser degree, sometimes supplying the (often unnecessary) artwork for Calvin's school projects, such as a letterhead featuring a \\"Calvin shield\\" surrounded by \\"lance-toting tigers\\". Hobbes also appears to be more enthusiastic about knowledge than Calvin since Hobbes likes reading more than he and sometimes does Calvin's homework. Hobbes is almost always willing to finish Calvin's homework when Calvin gets lazy, despite that Hobbes' motive for doing so is usually only to boast of the academic knowledge and skill of tigers while solving the problems (according to Hobbes tigers need to learn physics, biology, and artistic expression to hunt).Calvin and Hobbes, September 24, 1992 While he explains the homework to Calvin in a seemingly scientific and advanced method, the answer that he provides is usually completely incorrect (for example, saying 7+3=73), even though most times the problem only involves simple addition or subtraction. When Hobbes is not trying to explain the homework to him, Calvin is usually reading comics or otherwise doing anything but work. Calvin often yells, \\"I'M HOME!\\" when he gets home, making him an easy target for Hobbes to leap out of the front door and tackle him. Sometimes, though, Calvin realizes that this is not a good idea, and manages to thwart his tiger, although this can lead to more trouble. Calvin once managed to go through his back door to sneak up on Hobbes, yelled \\"I'M HOME!\\" before opening the door (causing Hobbes to leap into the door, or in one occasion, startling him into attacking Calvin anyway), and locked the door after Hobbes left the house (accidentally locking out his mother as well). Calvin also sometimes creates decoys wearing his clothes using pieces of wood, paper bags of leaves with his face on it, or makeshift snowmen, also in his clothes. Hobbes, however, usually sees through Calvin's decoy and either spots him or uses the decoy to his advantage. In one strip, Calvin's fear and expectation of this attack is used as humor; Calvin opens the door as usual, but is not attacked; he then goes upstairs to find Hobbes reading comic books, apparently uninterested in Calvin's arrival. Hobbes is also \\"President- and-First-Tiger\\" of the G.R.O.S.S. (Get Rid Of Slimy GirlS) club. The club headquarters are located in a treehouse (although in one strip an emergency meeting was held in a cardboard box called the \\"Box of Secrecy\\"), which Hobbes can get into without needing the rope ladder. He takes advantage of this by not allowing Calvin access into the treehouse without reciting the club's password, which is eight verses of a poem extolling tigers. It can also be much more than this; in one strip Hobbes remarked \\"You're not doing the dance.\\" Origins and development Watterson based some of Hobbes's characteristics, especially his playfulness and attack instinct, on his own pet cat, Sprite, who was known to unexpectedly jump out of nowhere. Hobbes takes great pride in being a feline (his love affair with tuna borders on addiction) and frequently makes wry or even disparaging comments about human nature, declaring his good fortune to lead a tiger's life. Reflecting upon his work in the introduction he wrote to The Complete Calvin and Hobbes, Watterson observed that his two characters revealed different facets of his own personality. Calvin generally voices what Watterson considered his immature side, often echoing the sentiments Watterson saw prevalent in modern America. (\\"The consumer is always right\\"; \\"There has to be a way to cram more violence into ninety minutes\\"; \\"Hold on, I need to inflate my basketball shoes.\\") By contrast, Hobbes offers a voice of ironic maturity ‚Äî though he is himself far from immune to silliness. Calvin captures Hobbes in a \\"tiger trap\\" during the first strip of the comic. Watterson initially believed that it was important to establish how his two main characters first met, but by the time he wrote the Tenth Anniversary Book, he had changed his opinion, saying it was unnecessary and even detrimental to the feel of the strip. Much later, it is apparent in several strips that Hobbes and Calvin have known each other their whole lives, including when Calvin was an infant. This contradicted the first two strips, which show Calvin and Hobbes' first meeting. One strip especially shows Calvin claiming that he didn't remember much of his infancy. While Calvin starts going on and on about how he suspects he was being brainwashed when he was very, very young, and asking nobody in particular what he remembered that someone wanted him to forget, Hobbes says \\"I seem to recall that you spent most of the time burping up.\\" Also, in an earlier strip, Hobbes once mused about some advice his father gave him. Hobbes' appearance changed over the strip's run; in the beginning he was slightly shorter, his tufts of fur less defined and shorter. His eyes also had more of a round shape, as opposed to the oval shape of later years. The most notable change, however, were the pads on Hobbes's hands. In earlier years, Watterson drew the pads on Hobbes' hands as a reminder that they were really paws, but later removed them on the grounds that he found them to be visually distracting. However, in one strip after Waterson stopped drawing the pads, Hobbes remarks in response to a complaint by Calvin, \\"Well, I'll be! My fuzzy mittens have pads!\\" Hobbes' name was revealed in the third strip when Calvin claims that Hobbes was making a lot of noise by jumping on the bed. Hobbes has claimed that he actually had a family. In one strip, Calvin asks Hobbes what he should do if Moe tries to attack him. Hobbes claims that Calvin should scramble for a tree and sit in it all day. Calvin is outraged by the advice and Hobbes states, \\"It doesn't impress the girls, of course, but there's no sense in impressing them and getting killed, my dad used to say.\\" Hobbes' reality From Calvin's point of view, Hobbes is an anthropomorphic, usually bipedal tiger, larger than Calvin, full of his own attitudes and ideas. But when the perspective shifts to any other character, readers see merely a stuffed tiger (there are some occasions in which Calvin's perspective of Hobbes is visible in the same panel as a parent, but the parent was not looking at the time). This is, of course, an odd dichotomy, and Watterson explains it as thus: Many readers assume that Hobbes is either a product of Calvin's imagination, or a stuffed animal that comes to life when Calvin is the only one around, or when nobody else but him is looking. However, Watterson rejects both of these interpretations, saying, \\"Hobbes is more about the subjective nature of reality than dolls coming to life\\"; thus, there is no concrete definition of Hobbes' reality. Watterson explained: \\"Calvin sees Hobbes one way, and everyone else sees Hobbes another way.\\" Hobbes' reality is in the eye of the beholder. The so-called 'gimmick' of Hobbes is the juxtaposition of Calvin and Hobbes' reality and everyone else's, with the two rarely agreeing. Despite this, in the world of the comic the other characters often speak of Hobbes as Calvin's \\"imaginary friend.\\" As well, it is sometimes difficult to imagine how the \\"stuffed toy\\" interpretation of Hobbes is consistent with what the characters see. For example, when Hobbes pounces on Calvin, the next panel shows Calvin lying on the ground, covered with dirt, with Hobbes lying on top of him, then when Calvin walks in, his mother can clearly see him beaten up, and she is left completely baffled. Another example is when Calvin wants Hobbes to take a bath with him, so Hobbes disguises himself with bubbles, and when Calvin assumes that Hobbes needs a hat and tie, he attempts to get his Dad's hat. As Calvin is bringing a tie through the living room, sneaking behind his Dad, his Mom exclaims, \\"Dear, why are you taking a bath? And wearing your best hat?!\\" Also, Hobbes \\"cuts\\" Calvin's hair (rather unsuccessfully), leading his parents to think that he cut his own hair badly. In several strips, Hobbes accompanies Calvin to his bus stop, and always seems to come home, even eating Calvin's lunch once (though in a later strip, Calvin's mother is shown going out to grab Hobbes after the bus has left). In another example, Hobbes \\"assists\\" Calvin's attempt to become a Houdini-style escape artist by tying Calvin to a chair. Calvin, however, cannot escape, and his irritated father must undo the knots, all the while asking Calvin how he could do this to himself. In a rare interview, Watterson explained his approach to this situation: Additionally, aspects of Hobbes' existence as a \\"real\\" tiger and a stuffed animal converge with little dispute from Calvin. An example is Hobbes's frequent washings or \\"baths\\" in the laundry machine which Calvin accepts. Likewise, in one strip, Calvin states that Hobbes becomes \\"a little loopy\\" when he comes out of the dryer. Another example is when Calvin's mom signed Calvin up for swimming lessons, Calvin asks why Hobbes can't come, so she responds (eyes rolling) \\"it's not good to get tigers wet,\\" to which Calvin asks Hobbes why this is true, and Hobbes replies \\"it takes us all day to dry out, and until we do, we smell funny.\\" Another example is that although the debut strip showed Calvin capturing Hobbes with a snare in such a way that seems like it's the first time they've ever met, another strip implies that Hobbes is older than Calvin and has been around his entire life. This strip has Calvin quoting that he can't recall anything from when he was under the age of three. Hobbes responds to this by saying Calvin spent most of the time burping up. Though other characters often refer to Hobbes as a \\"stuffed tiger\\" to Calvin, he avoids or ignores those comments (for example, when Hobbes is believed to have been stolen during a burglary, Calvin's mom reassures him that a robber would not want a stuffed tiger, to which Calvin responds \\"But Hobbes is so trusting ...\\"). In response to the journalist's assumption that Hobbes was a figment of Calvin's imagination, Watterson responded, Hobbes is often the voice of reason, contrasting Calvin's manic impulsiveness. It is ambiguous if this rationality is in Hobbes as a distinct personality, or in Calvin as a kind of conscience. In the end, the question becomes less about absolute truth and more about different versions of reality: the nature of Hobbes' existence is never a puzzle to be solved, but rather a subtle comment on the power of imagination, and on the similar power of a lack thereof. Susie Derkins also comments on Hobbes. After Calvin vigorously refuses her proposal to play with her and her toy rabbit, Mr. Bun, Hobbes comments that \\"Mr. Bun seems comatose, did you notice?\\" contrasting Hobbes' \\"reality\\" to that of another stuffed animal. Hobbes has a heavy crush on Susie.

The concept was popularised in birdwatching, but is so useful that it has since been adopted increasingly widely by field biologists in referring to the impression of the general characteristics of other animals. It similarly appears in such fields of observational biology as microscopy. Ecologists and botanists may speak of \\"habitat jizz\\" or the jizz of a plant. Sean Dooley described jizz as \\"the indefinable quality of a particular species, the 'vibe' it gives off\\" and notes that although it is \\"dismissed by many as some kind of birding alchemy, there is some physical basis to the idea of jizz.\\" Experienced birders can often make reliable identifications in the field at a glance by using jizz. Often jizz is useful for identifying to the family or genus level, rather than the species level, as in: \\"It definitely had the jizz of a thrush, but I couldn't see what kind.\\"  Etymology  The term was first used in print in 1922, in Thomas Coward's \\"Country Diary\\" column for the Manchester Guardian of 6 December 1921 ‚Äì the piece was subsequently included in his 1922 book Bird Haunts and Nature Memories. He attributed it to \\"a west-coast Irishman\\", and explained: Jeremy Greenwood concludes that the term was further popularised by its use by Miss E.I. Turner, \\"a popular author\\", in the journal Open Air in 1923. There is a theory that it comes from the World War II RAF acronym GISS for \\"General Impression of Size and Shape (of an aircraft)\\"Lare Svensson and Peter Grant, Bird Guide, Collins 2000, p. 8., but the use of the term in 1922 precludes that. Another theory claims that jizz is a corruption of gestalt, a German word that roughly means form or shape. Other possibilities include the word gist, or a contraction of just is. These theories were debunked by Jeremy Greenwood and his brother Julian in 2018.

Education She studied initially at Swanley Horticultural College in Kent, UK (1899-1901) and then specialised in botany at the Royal College of Science in London, studying under J. B. Farmer. Her postgraduate research was into seeds of the Alsinoidae (Caryophyllaceae). While a student, she collected plants from the European Alps and developed her identification skills with help from the Botanical Department at the Natural History Museum. Career Gibbs was employed by the Natural History section of the British Museum in London for her entire career but also collaborated with the Herbarium at the Royal Botanic Gardens,Kew and undertook histological and plant development work at the Royal College of Science. Expeditions between 1905 and 1915 to Australia, New Zealand, Fiji, Iceland, Indonesia, Malaysia, South America, the US and Zimbabwe allowed her to see plant life worldwide, and mountain plants were her particular interest. In 1905 she was part of a British Association visit to Rhodesia (Zimbabwe) and collected plant material. She visited Fiji in 1907 and explored the flora on the northern slopes of the Mount Victoria range, and then studied the bryophyte flora of New Zealand on her way home, identifying four new species of liverwort in the WaitƒÅkere Ranges. She also reported on the destruction of the New Zealand forests to permit grazing on her return to the UK in the Gardener's Chronicle in 1908 and 1909. She was the first woman and the first botanist to ascend Mount Kinabalu in February 1910 while leading an expedition for three months that recorded 15 new plant species.Phillipps, A. & F. Liew 2000. Globetrotter Visitor's Guide ‚Äì Kinabalu Park. New Holland Publishers (UK) Ltd. One outcome of this expedition was to show the importance of New Guinea as a centre for subsequent radiation of plants to south and east. In 1912 she collected in Iceland. 1913 found her in the Arfak Mountains, Dutch New Guinea and she continued to the Bellenden-Ker Range in Queensland, Australia in 1914 and then returned to London from Tasmania in 1915. Her final visit was to South America. Her travels were limited after 1921 due to ill-health and she died in 1925 at Santa Cruz, on Tenerife in the Canary Islands. Gibbs collected many plants new to science. Her specimens are in the collections at the British Museum. Others have named genera and species in her honour. These include Racemobambos gibbsiae (Stapf) Holttum or Miss Gibbs' Bamboo, the genus Gibbsia Rendle (Urticaceae) and the moss species Calobryum gibbsiae Steph. and Lepidozia gibbsiana Steph. Gibbs had the personality and ability to organise and carry out her expeditions successfully but was also remembered for her skill as a hostess at afternoon tea-parties. Awards Gibbs was elected a Fellow of the Linnean Society in 1905. In 1910 she was awarded the Huxley medal and prize for research in natural science and also joined the Microscopial Society. She became a Fellow of the Royal Geographical Society in 1919.

The plaintext message being solved for was \\"The secret message is: Many hands make light work.\\" DES Challenge II-2 was solved in just 56 hours in July 1998, by the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF), with their purpose-built Deep Crack machine. EFF won $10,000 for their success, although their machine cost $250,000 to build. The contest demonstrated how quickly a rich corporation or government agency, having built a similar machine, could decrypt ciphertext encrypted with DES. The text was revealed to be \\"The secret message is: It's time for those 128-, 192-, and 256-bit keys.\\"DES-II-2 Challenge DES Challenge III was a joint effort between distributed.net and Deep Crack.

Trolleys serving this station go eastbound to Center City Philadelphia and westbound to the neighborhoods of Eastwick and Angora, as well as the Delaware County suburbs of Yeadon and Darby. History Trolley tracks on Woodland Avenue on the University of Pennsylvania campus The station was opened in November 1955 by the Philadelphia Transportation Company (PTC) as part of a larger project to move portions of the elevated Market Street Line and surface trolleys underground.Puckett, John L. and Mark Frazier Lloyd. , accessed May 31, 2020. The original project to bury the elevated tracks between 23rd to 46th streets was announced by the PTC's predecessor, the Philadelphia Rapid Transit Company (PRT), in the 1920s, but was delayed due to the Great Depression and World War II. The PTC's revised project also included a new tunnel for trolleys underneath the campus of the University of Pennsylvania, continuing from the original western portal at 23rd and Market streets to new portals at 36th and Ludlow streets and 40th Street and Baltimore Avenue. The station's platforms are offset because during construction, the above intersection was a five-way junction between Spruce Street, Woodland Avenue, and South 37th Street. The latter two streets were later converted to pedestrian walkways. In October 2006, Penn's class of 1956 donated a new covered headhouse for the eastbound platform entrance. The entrance is a replica of the Peter Witt trolley manufactured by J. G. Brill Company from 1923‚Äì26 for Philadelphia's trolley system. The replica was built by the Gomaco Trolley Company. Station layout The station has two low-level offset side platforms, each capable of platforming two trolleys at a time. Fares are collected manually on board the trolley cars.

Their quadrupedal gait has never been reported in anatomically intact adult humans. The gait is different from the knuckle-walking quadrupedal gait of apes. In 2006, the family was the subject of a documentary: The Family That Walks On All Fours. The affected siblings have a form of non-progressive congenital cerebellar ataxia. The brain impairments include cerebellar hypoplasia, mild cerebral cortex atrophy and a reduced corpus callosum. They are also mildly intellectually disabled and have problems in balancing on two legs.

They all share a recessive mutation on chromosome 17p.  Sources  √úner Tan of √áukurova University Medical School in Adana, Turkey, has said that they show characteristics of the primate ancestors of Homo sapiens, before the move to bipedalism. He calls the process \\"backward evolution\\" and he named the condition Uner Tan syndrome. However, Nicholas Humphrey, John Skoyles, and Roger Keynes have argued that their gait is due to two rare phenomena coming together. First, instead of initially crawling as infants on their knees, they started off learning to move around with a \\"bear crawl\\" on their feet. Second, due to their congenital brain impairment, they found balancing on two legs difficult. Because of this, their motor development was channeled into turning their bear crawl into a substitute for bipedality.

According to John Ballinger, this was probably a \\"child marriage\\". There is said to be a letter written by young Salusbury while at Westminster School in which he mentions his wife.

One of their two surviving sons was Sir Henry Salusbury, 1st Baronet, the first of the Salusbury Baronets of Lleweni (1619). Henry was the father of Anne Salusbury, the wife of Arthur Stanhope and ancestor of all the Earls of Chesterfield from the fifth Earl.

Prior to the Muslim conquest of Persia, Zoroastrianism was the primary religion of the Persian Empire. According to the country's official census, there were 25,271 Zoroastrians within the country as of 2011.Iran is young, urbanised and educated: census, AFP, The National Background Darius the Great There are no impartial written records from Zarathushtra's time. The earliest surviving written references to Zarathushtra (from non-Iranians) seem to be those of Greek writers. Zarathushtra and his first followers were Iranians that lived between the Bronze Age and Iron Age (est. 1200-600 BC).Mary Boyce \\"Zoroastrians, Their Religious Beliefs and Practices\\" The time of the Iranian peoples' migration to Iran can be mainly estimated through Assyrian records. Also, Herodotus (I, 101) recalled one of the Mede tribes to be called \\"Magoi\\", better known as \\"Magis\\", a tribe known to have included many priests, who served both Medes and Persians. By the time of the Median empire (est. 612 BC), Zoroastrianism is known to have been well established in both the Pars region (later capital of Persia) as well as in the Eastern regions. Achaemenid dynasty Persians led by Cyrus the Great soon established the second Iranian dynasty, and the first Persian empire by defeating the Medes dynasty in 549 BC. As Persians expanded their empire, Zoroastrianism was introduced to Greek historians such as Hermodorus, Hermippus, Xanthos, Eudoxus and Aristotle; each giving a different date regarding the life of Zoroaster but naturally believed him to be a Persian prophet and called him \\"Master of the magi\\" Although there are no inscriptions left from the time of Cyrus about his religion, the fire-altars found at Pasargadae, as well as the fact that he called his daughter Atossa, name of the queen of Vishtaspa (Zoroaster's royal patron), suggests that he indeed may have been a Zoroastrian. However, it is clear that by the time of Darius the Great (549 BC‚Äì 485/486 BC), the empire was clearly Zoroastrian. Darius declares in one of his inscriptions that: Persepolis Persepolis (or Parsa) was one of the four capitals of the Achaemenid empire, built by Darius the Great and his son Xerxes; it was a glorious city known to the world as the \\"richest city under the sun\\". It was also the trading capital of the Near East. One of the main functions of Persepolis was to serve as the host of the ancient Zoroastrian festival, Norouz. Therefore, every year representatives from each country under the rule of Persia would bring gifts to Persepolis to show their loyalty to the king and the empire. Arsacid dynastySassanid dynasty The Sassanid dynasty (224-651 AD) declared Zoroastrianism as the state religion and promoted a religious revival of Zoroastrianism. During the period of their centuries long suzerainty over the Caucasus, the Sassanids made attempts to promote Zoroastrianism there with considerable successes, and it was prominent in the pre-Christian Caucasus (especially modern-day Azerbaijan). Due to its ties to the Christian Roman Empire, Persia's arch-rival since Parthian times, the Sassanids were suspicious of Roman Christianity, and after the reign Constantine the Great sometimes persecuted it. The Sassanid authority clashed with their Armenian subjects in the Battle of Avarayr (451 CE), making them officially break with the Roman Church. But the Sassanids tolerated or even sometimes favored the Christianity of the Nestorian Church of Persia. The acceptance of Christianity in Georgia (Caucasian Iberia) saw the Zoroastrian religion there slowly but surely decline,Dr Stephen H Rapp Jr. The Sasanian World through Georgian Eyes: Caucasia and the Iranian Commonwealth in Late Antique Georgian Literature Ashgate Publishing, Ltd., 28 sep. 2014. p 160 but as late the 5th century AD it was still widely practised as something like a second established religion.Ronald Grigor Suny. The Making of the Georgian Nation Indiana University Press, 1994 p 22Roger Rosen, Jeffrey Jay Foxx. The Georgian Republic, Volume 1992 Passport Books, 1992 p 34 Prophet Mani The prophet Mani was an Iranian of noble Parthian roots who established Manichaeism which contained many elements of Zoroastrianism as well as Gnosticism, however it saw the experience of life on earth by humans as miserable, which was a contrast to the Zoroastrian view which was to celebrate life through happiness. Mani was received kindly by king Shapur I and spent many years at his court where he was protected during all of Shabuhr's reign. However Mani wrote in a semitic language (Syriac Aramaic), and all his work had to be translated into Middle Persian by his followers, who rendered the name of Mani's supreme god as Zurvan and called him the father of OhrmazdMary Boyce, \\"Zoroastrians, Their Religious Beliefs and Practices\\": Under the early Sassanians (Ahuramazda, God of Wisdom, main deity of Zoroastrianism). Zurvanism Although the origins of Zurvanite Zoroastrianism are unclear, it was during the Sassanid period that it gained widespread acceptance, and many of the Sassanid emperors were at least to some extent Zurvanites. Zurvanism enjoyed royal sanction during the Sassanid era but no traces of it remain beyond the 10th century. Unlike Mazdean Zoroastrianism, Zurvanism considered Ahura Mazda not the transcendental Creator, but one of two equal- but-opposite divinities under the supremacy of Zurvan. The central Zurvanite belief made Ahura Mazda (Middle Persian: Ohrmuzd) and Angra Mainyu (Ahriman) twin brothers that had co-existed for all time. Non-Zoroastrian accounts of typically Zurvanite beliefs were the first traces of Zoroastrianism to reach the west, which misled European scholars to conclude that Zoroastrianism was a dualist faith. The Zoroastrian cult of Zurvan should not be confused with the Manichaeism's use of the name Zurvan in Middle Persian texts to represent the Manichean deity of light. Mani had himself introduced this practice (for perhaps political reasons) in his Shapurgan, which he dedicated to his patron Shapur II. For much of the rest of the Sassanid era, the Manichaens were a persecuted minority, and Mani was sentenced to death by Bahram I. Calendar reformsSacred fires Fire Temple in Yazd The three great sacred fires of Persia at the time of the Sassanids were the Adur Farnbag, Adur Gushnasp and the Adur Burzen-Mihr which burnt in Pars, Media and Parthia respectively. Of these three the Adur Burzen-Mihr was the most sacred fire as it was linked to the prophet Zarathustra himself and king Vishtaspa.Mary Boyce, \\"Zoroastrians, Their Religious Beliefs and Practices\\": Under the mid Sassanid period Mazdakite movementAvesta=Arab conquest and under the Caliphate The Muslim conquest of Persia, also known as the Arab conquest of Iran led to the end of the Sasanian Empire in 651 and the eventual decline of the Zoroastrian religion in Iran. Arabs first attacked the Sassanid territory in 633, when general Khalid ibn Walid invaded Mesopotamia (what is now Iraq), which was the political and economic center of the Sassanid state. Following the transfer of Khalid to the Roman front in the Levant, the Muslims eventually lost their holdings to Iranian counterattacks. The second invasion began in 636 under Saad ibn Abi Waqqas, when a key victory at the Battle of Qadisiyyah led to the permanent end of Sasanian control west of Iran. The Zagros mountains then became a natural barrier and border between the Rashidun Caliphate and the Sassanid Empire. Owing to continuous raids by Persians into the area, Caliph Umar ordered a full invasion of the Sasanian Iranian empire in 642, which was completed with the complete conquest of the Sasanians around 651 The quick conquest of Iran in a series of well coordinated multi-pronged attacks, directed by Caliph Umar from Medina several thousand kilometres from the battlefields in Iran, became his greatest triumph, contributing to his reputation as a great military and political strategist. Iranian historians have sought to defend their forebears by using Arab sources to illustrate that \\"contrary to the claims of some historians, Iranians, in fact, fought long and hard against the invading Arabs.\\" By 651, most of the urban centers in Iranian lands, with the notable exception of the Caspian provinces and Transoxiana, had come under the domination of the Arab armies. Many localities in Iran staged a defense against the invaders, but in the end none was able to repulse the invasion. Even after the Arabs had subdued the country, many cities rose in rebellion, killing the Arab governor or attacking their garrisons, but reinforcements from the caliphs succeeded in putting down all these rebellions and imposing the rule of Islam. The violent subjugation of Bukhara after many uprisings is a case in point. Conversion to Islam was, however, only gradual. In the process, many acts of violence took place, Zoroastrian scriptures were burnt and many mobads executed. Once conquered politically, the Persians began to reassert themselves by maintaining Persian language and culture. Regardless, Islam was adopted by many, for political, socio-cultural or spiritual reasons, or simply by persuasion, and became the dominant religion. Mongol empire The Mongol invasion of Iran resulted in millions of deaths and ruined many cities. The early Mongol invaders were, however, pagans or Buddhists so their persecution was not as targeted against Zoroastrians as before. However, within half a century of the conquest, the leader of the Il- Khanate, Ghazan Khan, covered to Islam, which did not help the status of Zoroastrians in Iran. However, by the time that the Mongols were expelled, Pars province had escaped major damage and the Zoroastrians moved to the North of Pars mainly in the regions of Yazd and Kerman,Mary Boyce, \\"Zoroastrians, Their Religious Beliefs and Practices\\": Under the Caliphs where even today the main Zoroastrian communities are found.  Safavid dynasty  The Shiite Safavid dynasty destroyed what was once a vibrant community of Zoroastrians. As per official policy, Safavids wanted everyone to convert to the Shia sect of Islam and killed hundreds of thousands of Zoroastrians and other minorities when they refused. The majority of Zoroastrians also left for India though about 20% remained, most of whom had to migrate in the late 19th century as the Qajar dynasty imposed greater restrictions on them.  Qajar dynasty  Qajar Iran about 1910. During the Qajar Dynasty, religious persecution of the Zoroastrians was rampant. Due to the increasing contacts with influential Parsi philanthropists such as Maneckji Limji Hataria, many Zoroastrians left Iran for India. There, they formed the second major Indian Zoroastrian community known as the Iranis.  Modern history =Pahlavi dynasty Starting from the early twentieth century, Tehran, the nation's capital, experienced rapid migrations from all Iranian minorities. The Zoroastrian population increased from about 50 merchants in 1881 to 500 by 1912.Hukht (1973) During the reign of the Pahlavi dynasty, Zoroastrians changed from being one of the most persecuted minorities in Iran to a symbol of Iranian nationalism.Janet Kestenberg Amighi \\"Zoroastrians of Iran, Conversion, Assimilation, or Persistence\\" pp. 143 This notion carried on all the way through the 1979 Islamic Revolution when Ayatollah Sadughi proclaimed that \\"We Muslims are like the branches of a tree, if our roots are cut off, we shall shrivel up and die\\", also the last prime minister before the revolution Shapour Bakhtiar held an anti-Ayatollah Khomeini meeting in Los Angeles, California on the day of the Zoroastrian Mehregan festival (1980), in tribute to \\"true nationalism\\" (see Iranian nationalism). Post-Revolution Like the Armenian, Assyrian and Persian Jewish communities, Zoroastrians are officially recognized and on the grounds of the 1906 Constitution allocated one seat in the Iranian Parliament, currently held by Esfandiar Ekhtiari Kassnavieh.Press TV - Results for the minority MPs Out-marriage and low birth rates affect the growth of Iran's Zoroastrian populationRichard Foltz, ‚ÄúZoroastrians in Iran: What Future in the Homeland?‚Äù Middle East Journal 65/1 (2011): 73-84. which, according to Iran's 2012 census results stood at 25,271, though this represented an increase of 27.5% on the 2006 population A June 2020 online survey found a much smaller percentage of Iranians stating they believe in Islam, with half of those surveyed indicating they had lost their religious faith. The poll, conducted by the Netherlands-based GAMAAN (Group for Analyzing and Measuring Attitudes in Iran), using online polling to provide greater anonymity for respondents, surveyed 50,000 Iranians and found 7.7% identified as Zoroastrians. In 2013, Sepanta Niknam was elected to the city council of Yazd and became the first Zoroastrian councillor in Iran. but he was removed by Guardian council of Islamic Republic of Iran on the grounds that non-Muslims should not be a member of a city council in Iran.

Types of establishments include chemical warehousing, chemical production facilities and some distributors. Details The principal aim of the regulations is to reduce the risks of potential major accidents, such as the Flixborough disaster, that are associated with the handling of hazardous substances. The regulations operate on two levels depending on the establishment's status which is divided into two categories,'Lower Tier' and 'Upper Tier', determined by inventory. Lower tier establishments are required to document a Major Accident Prevention Policy which should be signed off by the managing director. A top tier COMAH establishment is required to produce a full safety report which demonstrates that all necessary measures have been taken to minimise risks posed by the site with regard to the environment and local populations. The penalty for unauthorised storage can be severe and companies unsure of whether the COMAH regulations apply should seek advice from trade associations and local health and safety inspectors.

Route  The Third Ring Road in the area of the Moscow International Business Center. The Third Ring is 35 kilometers (km) in length, i. e. about 10 km in diameter. Lanes varies from three to five. As one of Moscow's main roads, the Third Ring Road suffers from heavy traffic congestion. There is a planned Fourth Ring between the Moscow Ring Road and the Third Ring. The Third Ring can be used to get from areas such as Sokolniki Park to Sparrow Hills, on the other side of the city. The road is used by many Moscovites who live in the suburbs of Moscow to bypass the city centre. The Third Ring Road was completed in 2004 with the Lefortovo Tunnel, the third longest urban tunnel in Europe after the S√∂dra l√§nken tunnel in Stockholm, Sweden and the Dublin Port Tunnel in Dublin, Ireland. The Third Ring Road also serves as the main highway access for the Moscow International Business Center (MIBC), a modern high-rise office district located along the western portion of the Third Ring, where it crosses the Moscow River.  Limited-Access Highway  The limited-access highway sections of the Third Ring Road are located on the northern sections of the beltway. The northern sections can be identified as this type of highway due to its access to adjacent property and many intersections with streets. The section starts east from the interchange with Begovaya Street in the Begovoy District to the Lefortovo Tunnel in the Basmanny District. The Begovaya Street Interchange is a variation of the Directional T Interchange and the Year 1905 Street terminates at this interchange. There are two intersections with Polikarpova Street and Begovaya Street of which they intersect with the beltway and some ramps of the interchange. The beltway later intersects with Begovaya Lane, Botkinskiy Driveway, and Proyektiruemyy Driveway. The Third Ring Road then underpasses the 12-lane Leningradsky Avenue with a variant diamond interchange that includes a few overpasses. The beltway then intersects Petrovsko Razumovskiy Driveway and overpasses Nizhnyaya Maslovka Street, in which the street served as a ramp, bordering the Savyolovsky District in the north. The beltway then intersects Bashilovskaya Street, Raskovoy Street, Nizhny Maslovskiy Driveway, Vyatskaya Street, and Pravdy Street. The Third Ring Road then interchanges with Butyrskaya Street-Novoslobodskaya Street with a hybrid folded parclo diamond interchange, coming into the Maryina Roshcha District. The beltway later intersects Savelovskiy Driveway, Tikhvinskaya Street, Dvintsev Street, Novosushchevskaya Street, and Vysheslavtsev Lane. The Third Ring Road later underpasses both Sheremetyevo Street-Oktyabrskaya Street with a diamond interchange and intersects Maryinoy Roshschi Street a few meters east. Later, the beltway overpasses Rizhskaya Place, Mira Avenue, Bolshaya Pereyaslavskaya Street several railways near the Riga Railway Station, and Sokolnicheskiy Val Street, thus leading it into the Basmanny District. The Third Ring Road later intersects Rybinskaya Street, underpasses Lobachika Street and Mitkovskaya railway with a tunnel, and overpasses Rusakovskaya Avenue-Krasnoprudnaya Street with a diamond interchange and another railway. The beltway then intersects with Novaya Perevedenovskaya Street and goes into the Lefortovo Tunnel, but not without a folded diamond interchange with Bakuninskaya Street. This ends the limited-access highway section of the Third Ring Road.  Controlled-Access Highway  The Third Ring Road crosses the Yauza River by the Lefortovo Tunnel in eastern Moscow. The tunnel is the 3rd longest urban tunnel in the world. The image shown here is the north exit of the tunnel in the Basmanny District. The controlled-access highway sections of the Third Ring Road are located on the eastern, southern, and western sections of the beltway. These sections can be identified as this type of highway due to its lack of access to adjacent property and no intersections with streets; however, there are some exceptions. The section starts south from the Lefortovo Tunnel in the Lefortovo District to the interchange with Begovaya Street in the Begovoy District. The section starts when the Third Ring Road exits out the Lefortovo Tunnel in the Lefortovo District and forms a cloverleaf-like interchange with Entuziastov Highway, also known as Highway of the Enthusiasts. The beltway then overpasses a railway and forms a hybrid interchange with Nizhegorodskaya Avenue, now bordering the Tagansky District in the west and the Nizhegorodsky District in the east. The Third Ring Road then turns southwest, over passing and under passing a few railroads, and forming a hybrid interchange with Ostapovskiy Thoroughfare and Volgogradskiy Avenue. The beltway then touches southeastern part of the Moscow Central Circle (MCC) line, also known as Line 14, of the Moscow Metro, in the south. Later, the Third Ring Road forms a hybrid interchange with Yuzhnoportovaya Street and the beltway splits to make the MCC line as a median strip. The beltway then underpasses the Velozavodskaya Street, leading to the Danilovsky District. The MCC Line later underpasses the southern lanes of Third Ring Road, thus ending its purpose as a median strip. There is also a ramp on the beltway leading to Trofimova Street. The Third Ring Road then forms an interchange with Avtozavodskaya Street and then intersects with Leninskaya Sloboda Street and the southern portion of Avtozavodskaya Street. The beltway later overpasses the Moskva River on the Avtozavodskii Bridge, leading the beltway to the Donskoy District.

Around the year 1960, construction of the beltway started on Begovaya Street to Riga. Construction of the beltway started eastward at the northern sections. In 1961, a tunnel under Leningradsky Avenue was completed and put into effect. In the same year, the Avtozavodskii Bridge was constructed. In 1965, the overpass near the Savelovskaya Railroad Station was completed. The overpass includes the beltway going over a railway and Butyrskaya Street-Novoslobodskaya Street. In 1975, the overpass near the Riga Railway Station was built. This overpass would go over Mira Avenue and another railway. In 1984, the overpass over Rusakovskaya Avenue was constructed and put into effect. A tunnel under Mitkovskaya Railway was completed connecting the northern branch and the northeastern branch of the road. Now the Third Ring Road was over one-fourths completed, with the western, eastern, and southern branches needed to be built. However, economic hardships during the time halted the construction of the beltway, and no progress was made for about over a decade.  Contemporary Era (1993-present)  Russian president Vladimir Putin at the opening of a new section of the Third Ring Road in December 12th, 2001. After the early 1990s when the Soviet Union and the RSFSR dissolved, construction of the beltway continued, starting in the southwestern sections of the beltway, with the general contractor behind it being the Transstroy Corporation. On October 28, 1998, the Berezhkovskii Bridge was constructed and opened. The bridge is located over the Moskva River between the Dorogomilovo District and the Khamovniki District. On May 10, 1999, the overpass over the Luzhnetskaya Thoroughfare from Komsomolsk Avenue to Berezhkovsky Bridge was built and opened. Plans to create a new Riga overpass to replace the old one were approved and construction started. The first phase of the new overpass was finished on August 31 while the second phase finished on December 4. Seven days later, the section from the Berezhkovskii Bridge to the Kutuzovsky Avenue was completed, with a tunnel interchange going under the avenue. In the fall of the year 2000, the section between Komsomolsk Avenue in the Khamovniki District to Leninsky Avenue in the Donskoy District was completed and opened, with St. Andrew's Bridge which crosses the Moskva River between the two avenues. On December 30, the section between Kutuzovsky Avenue of the Dorogomilovo District and Shmitovsky Thoroughfare of the Presnensky District was built and opened, which includes the Dorogomilovsky Bridge located between the two districts and over the Moskva River. The area east of the beltway north of Moskva River after crossing the Dorogomilovsky Bridge would become the MIBC. A tunnel interchange on Nizhnyaya Maslovka Street which goes under the beltway was built and opened on August 28, 2001 in the northern parts of the highway in the Savyolosky District. The interchange the beltway crosses Leninsky Avenue is a tunnel interchange under Gagarin Square named Gagarin's tunnel. It was constructed along with a section to Volgograd Avenue of southeastern central Moscow, with a reconstructed Avtozavodskii Bridge, on December 12. In the same year, the section between Shmitovsky Avenue and the Zvenigorod Highway was completed although the date is not clarified. On November 6, 2002, the section between Zvenigorod Highwayand and Begovaya Street located on the western part of the beltway was completed and opened, thus connecting the northern beltway with the western and southern beltway. The section between Ostapovsky Thoroughfare and Nizhny Novgorod Street on the eastern part of the beltway were built and opened on the same time as well. The area between Spartakovskaya Street and the Krasnokazarmennaya embankment by the Yauza River were finished in the Basmanny District on October 1, 2003. The section between Nizhny Novgorod Street to the Highway of the Enthusiasts, also known as Entuziastov Highway which borders the Lefortovo District in the north was finished in the same time as well. One month later, the Lefortovo Tunnel finished construction and was opened, connecting the Third Ring Road's sections in the Basmanny District, therefore closing and finishing the beltway. On November 4, 2005, four interchanges were redesigned and reconstructed: the Leningradsky Avenue interchange over the Third Ring Road (due to extensive renovation and conversion of the Avenue into a 12-lane freeway which includes an extra overpass), Sheremetyevo Street-Oktyabrskaya Street over the beltway converted into a diamond interchange, and the Zvenigorod Highway over the beltway converted into a variation of the diamond interchange. Traffic on the ring was continuous, with no traffic lights on the beltway till June 15, 2016, where a traffic light and road markings were placed on an intersection between a ramp to the Third Ring Road and Leningradsky Avenue.

The inhabitants are called Havrincourtois. Situation The village lies about 14 kilometres south-west of Cambrai near the Havrincourt service area on the Autoroute A2. It is in the south-east corner of Pas-de-Calais, near to both the Nord and the Somme d√©partements. It stands on the Upper Cretaceous plateau of the Artesian anticline, between the Somme at P√©ronne and the Escaut at Cambrai. In this satellite photograph Cambrai is top right. The dark patch down left of centre is the Bois d'Havrincourt. The Canal du Nord runs northwards from there and the Autoroute A2 goes diagonally. The village lies north-east of the wood and the A26 runs in curves from north to south of the picture. To the east of that, the Canal de Saint-Quentin winds from Cambrai to the south of the picture. The chalk soil of the plateau shows pale in the fields. If you know where to look, it is just possible to detect the soil disturbance around the Hindenburg Line. Communications Havrincourt is close to the A2 - A26 motorway interchange which leads to south and north- going junctions of the A1. Three motorway access points are distant about from the village. The Canal du Nord passes through the western edge of the commune. Economy and village life The commune produces cereals, endives, and beet. Livestock raised includes poultry and beef. Timber is harvested from the wood. There is a camping and caravan site. The village holds a festival on the Sunday nearest 24 June. Sports pursued are shooting and fishing and there is a village hall. History In 1125 it was referred to as Haverencort. The barony of Havrincourt was promoted to a marquisate in 1693. The Cardevacque d'Havrincourt family then played a prominent role during the French R√©gence period (1715‚Äì1723). The construction of the Canal du Nord had reached the commune in 1914 when the First World War broke out. In the winter of 1916-17, its incomplete earthworks were here incorporated into the defences of the Hindenburg Line, the main or front line of which ran right through the village. As a consequence, the commune was the scene of two battles each of which was in its own way, significant in the history of the war. In November 1917, the Hindenburg Main Line (Siegfried Stellung) ran through the village. The taking of Havrincourt was part of the opening phase of the Battle of Cambrai (1917), when tanks were used in a coordinated way for the first time. On the night of 19‚Äì20 November, soldiers of British 62nd (2nd West Riding) Division prepared for the event in Havrincourt Wood. The motorway now passes through the part which in 1917 had been felled as part of the front of the Hindenburg Line and was occupied by an artillery battery. The Tank Corps mustered behind the battery, in the south-west corner of the wood. The infantry battalions present were the 2/5th, 2/6th, 2/7th (Leeds Rifles) and 2/8th (Leeds Rifles) Bns West Yorkshire Regiment, 2/4th and 2/5th Bns KOYLI, 2/4th and 2/5th Bns York and Lancaster Regiment. The second battle was the Battle of Havrincourt, opening on 12 September 1918, which was significant because it began the German retreat back to the Belgian border with France. Arrival in that vicinity coincided with the implementation of The Armistice. At Havrincourt, on 12 September, 62nd Division was again present, this time with the New Zealand Division. The commune was awarded the French Croix de Guerre on 23 September 1920. See memorial record. Heritage There are no really old buildings as everything was destroyed by the establishment of the Hindenburg Line and the two battles, particularly that of 1917. However, the ch√¢teau was rebuilt by 1925 in the style of the periods of Henri IV and Louis XIII (1589‚Äì1643), the equivalent of the English Jacobean. It consists of five adjoining blocks of building each with a steeply pitched roof. See picture of the north front. The park is extensive. The church of St G√©ry too, was rebuilt after 1918. It includes seven grave slabs of the Cardevacque d'Havrincourt family from the period 1648 to 1776. There is a chapel of the Virgin with a black Madonna and a chapel of St Martin. The Bois d'Havrincourt is extensive and there is a fine panoramic view from the Bridge on the Canal du Nord.

Serata (Nitta) Arichika, a samurai of the 14th century, was the common ancestor of both the Sakai clan and the Matsudaira clan, which the Sakai later served. In the Sengoku period, under Tokugawa Ieyasu (who was the head of what was formerly the main Matsudaira family line), the Sakai became chief retainers. In the Edo period, because of their longstanding service to the Tokugawa clan, the Sakai were classified as a fudai family, in contrast with the tozama (\\"outsider clans\\"). Clan branches and histories Site of the Sakai clan's residence in Edo The fudai Sakai clan originated in 14th century Mikawa Province. They claim descent from Minamoto no Arichika. Arichika had two sons; one of them, Yasuchika, took the name of Matsudaira, while the other son, Chikauji, took the name of Sakai. Chikauji is the ancestor of the Sakai clan. Sakai Hirochika, Chikauji's son, had two sons as well, and the descendants of these two sons gave rise to the two principal branches of the clan.Papinot, Jacques Edmond Joseph. (1906). Dictionnaire d‚Äôhistoire et de g√©ographie du Japon; Papinot, (2003). \\"Sakai\\" at Nobiliare du Japon, pp. 50-51; retrieved 2013-8-8. The senior branch was founded by Sakai Tadatsugu (1527‚Äì1596). Tadatsugu, a vassal of Tokugawa Ieyasu, was charged with the defense of Yoshida Castle in Mikawa Province. In 1578, Sakai Ietsugu (1564‚Äì1619) succeeded to his father's role as defender of Yoshida Castle. The Ie- in the beginning of Ietsugu's name was a special honor bestowed by Tokugawa Ieyasu, who intended to emphasize bonds of loyalty with those who were allowed to share in any part of his name. When Ieyasu's holdings were transferred to the Kant≈ç region in 1590, Ietsugu was installed at Usui Domain (30,000 koku) in K≈çzuke Province, but, in 1604, he was moved to Takasaki Domain (50,000 koku). In 1616, he was again moved to Takada Domain (100,000 koku), this time in Echigo Province. In 1619, he was moved to Matsushiro Domain in Shinano Province; and then, from 1622 to 1868, he was installed at Tsuruoka Domain (120,000 koku) in Dewa Province. The Sakai of Tsuruoka (which later grew to 170,000 koku) in Dewa Province were prominent in the late Edo period as a military power. Charged with the safety of Edo, they were patrons of the Shinchogumi police force, and were very effective in their duties. Following the surrender of Edo, the Sakai withdrew and returned north to their domain, where they were active in the northern theater of the Boshin War, as well as becoming signatories to the pact that created the ≈åuetsu Reppan D≈çmei in 1868. The head of this clan line was ennobled as a \\"Count\\" in the Meiji period.Papinot, p. 50. A cadet branch was created in 1647. These Sakai were installed from 1647 through 1868 at Matsumine Domain (20,000 koku) in Dewa Province; the castle at Matsumine was constructed in 1779. The head of this clan line was ennobled as a \\"Viscount\\" in the Meiji period. Another cadet branch was founded by Sakai Masachika (+1576). Vassal of the Tokugawa ‚Äì Tokugawa Nobutada, Tokugawa Kiyoyasu and Tokugawa Hirotada. In 1561, he was installed at Nishio Castle in Mikawa Province, and the security of the castle was confided in him. In 1590, Sakai Shigetada, the son of Masachika, received the Kawagoe Domain (15,000 koku) in Musashi Province; then in 1601, he was installed at Umayabashi Domain (35,000 koku) in K≈çzuke Province.Papinot, p. 51. In 1749, the descendants of Sakai Tadakiyo (1626‚Äì1681) were transferred to Himeji Domain (150,000 koku) in Harima Province ; and they remained daimy≈ç at Himeji until the Meiji period. This cadet branch of the Sakai had been created in 1590. The head of this clan line was first ennobled as a \\"Count\\" and in the Meiji period. Yet another cadet branch of the Sakai had been created in 1668, These Sakai were installed from 1668 through 1868 at Katsuyama Domain (12,000 koku) in Awa Province. The head of this clan line was ennobled as a \\"Viscount\\" in the Meiji period. A further cadet branch of the Sakai had been created in 1681, These Sakai were installed in 1681 through 1868 at Isezaki Domain (20,000 koku) in K≈çzuke Province. The head of this clan line was ennobled as a \\"Viscount\\" in the Meiji period. Sakai Tadatoshi (1562‚Äì1627) received the fief of Tanaka Domain (10,000 koku) in Suruga Province in 1601; then his holding was transferred in 1609 to Kawagoe Domain (30,000 koku) in Musashi province. Sakai Tadakatsu (1587‚Äì1662) was installed in 1634 through 1868 at Obama Domain (103,500 koku) in Wakasa Province . This cadet branch of the Sakai had been created in 1590. The head of this clan line was ennobled as a \\"Count\\" in the Meiji period. Finally, another cadet branch of the Sakai had been created in 1682. These Sakai were installed in 1682 through 1868 at Tsuruga Domain (10,000 koku) in Echizen Province. The head of this clan line was ennobled as a \\"Viscount\\" in the Meiji period.

The secondary school served the Roman Catholic community of the towns of Irvine and Kilwinning and the villages of Beith, Kilbirnie and Dalry, which make up the Garnock Valley. Opened in Irvine in 1921, and located in Kilwinning from 1965, the school held over 800 pupils and 200 members of staff. When St Michael's closed in 2007, a staff committee compiled a history of the 86 years, a paperback which sold out of 1000 copies in six months. Most (95%) of its contents were then adapted for the web by a now-retired staff member - the link is shown below. A new school, St Matthew's Academy was built in Saltcoats to accommodate pupils and staff from both the old St Michaels in Kilwinning and St Andrews Academy. The new school opened in October 2007. History Before 1921 Catholic children in Irvine, North Ayrshire attended primary classes in the existing St Marys church situated on West Road for their fundamental education, they then had to travel outside the Region to carry on any further education. In 1920 the Sisters of the Cross and Passion purchased Williamfield Estate on Kilwinning Road in the town to act as a convent and school which they staffed. They had their first intake of (7) pupils, November 1921. The new secondary, St. Michael's College, Irvine, opened in August 1923 followed by St. Mary's Primary in August 1928. Then on 25 October 1939 the building was destroyed by fire, and as a stop gap, wooden huts were erected on the site so that the education could continue. The Second World War was soon to start leading to a period of deprivation and austerity which meant school building was now very low on the list of national priorities. This set up with the wooden school huts becoming increasingly overcrowded was to remain until the 1960s when the College moved to new premises costing ¬£453,000 built in the neighbouring town of Kilwinning. This new building was formally opened in June 1966 with Ayr County Council changing the name from College to Academy the following year. It was further extended as well as updated in 1984 and remained in use till 2007 when it closed its doors for the final time.

Early life Clough was from a humble background, but his fortunes were improved when he was noticed, as a boy chorister in Chester Cathedral, for his remarkable singing voice and was sent to court in London: :\\"Some were so affected by his singing therein, that they were loath he should lose himself in empty air (church musick beginning then to be dis-countenanced) and persuaded, yea, procured his removal to London\\".Worthies of England by Thomas Fuller, 1662 By virtue of his visit to Jerusalem, he became a Knight of the Holy Sepulchre. Back in London, he became a factor (or manager) for Thomas Gresham and entered the Mercers' Company. Trader in Antwerp In 1552 he was located in Antwerp, then the centre of North European commerce and banking. Here he met his wife Catherine Muldart, from that city. With her, he had a son, Richard. In 1561, he wrote to Gresham ‚Äì his employer ‚Äì with the suggestion that something along the lines of the Antwerp Bourse could be established in London. Gresham took this up, founding the London Royal Exchange, which opened in 1571. Clough played an important role in its development, providing finance and appointing Hendrik van Passe, the Flemish architect to work on the building. Many of his lengthy letters, which were passed by Gresham to the government for their use in intelligence, have survived and been used by historians. His eyewitness account of the \\"Iconoclastic Fury\\" or Beeldenstorm in Antwerp in 1566, is often quoted. He saw: \\"all the churches, chapels and houses of religion utterly defaced, and no kind of thing left whole within them, but broken and utterly destroyed, being done after such order and by so few folks that it is to be marvelled at.\\" The Church of Our Lady in Antwerp, later made the cathedral: \\"looked like a hell, with above 10,000 torches burning, and such a noise as if heaven and earth had got together, with falling of images and beating down of costly works, such sort that the spoil was so great that a man could not well pass through the church. So that in fine [short], I cannot write you in x sheets of paper the strange sight I saw there, organs and all destroyed.\\"Spicer, 109 (spelling modernized); see also Arnade, 146‚Äì148Eyewitness Account of Image-breaking at Antwerp , Universiteit Leiden Return to Wales Bachegraig Plas Clough near Denbigh Clough returned to Wales in 1565, and introduced Flemish building styles into the area with the building of two houses, Bach-y-graig and Plas Clough. He was so rich that in his home area his name became a synonym for wealth. He devised a scheme to dredge the River Clwyd and make it navigable. He was active in astronomy, a patron of the map publisher Humphrey Llwyd of Denbigh and friends with Ortelius. In 1567, he was named \\"court master\\" of the London Merchant Adventures, now resettled from Antwerp to Hamburg. He died unexpectedly in Hamburg, some time between March and July 1570, while preparing to bring his second wife, Katheryn of Berain, home to the new house he had built for her at Plas Clough on the outskirts of Denbigh. In local folk-tales of Tremeirchion, Clough is supposed to have been carried off by the Devil, never to be seen again, after being discovered by his wife discussing alchemy and other \\"godless\\" subjects at the house he had built for her.

Morgan, which take place in or around the 26th century. Fictional history [Note that Kovacs backstory, and that of the Envoys, differs significantly in the TV adaptation from that of the novels. This depiction reflects that found in the novel] A native of the planet Harlan's World (born in the city Newpest), Kovacs is of Japanese and Hungarian descent. Kovacs is a former Envoy, a member of an elite military force of futuristic soldiers, part intelligence operative and part shock trooper, trained to adapt quickly to new bodies and new environments. Envoys are used by the governing Protectorate to infiltrate and crush planetary unrest and maintain political stability. Envoy training is actually a form of psychospiritual conditioning that operates at subconscious levels. After leaving the Envoys, Kovacs returned to criminal life and became a mercenary. He was eventually imprisoned, his cortical \\"stack\\" stored without a body (or \\"sleeve\\") for decades at a time as punishment, before being paroled or hired out to work high-risk situations. Envoys possess total recall and are able to discern subtle patterns within seemingly unrelated events. They possess a thorough understanding of body language and vocal tonality, such that they can discern intention and manipulate others with ease. They are able to control their physiological and psychological responses, such as fear and anger, at will. Another aspect that figures prominently in an Envoy's training is the systematic removal of every violence-limiting instinct a human is born with. Due to this training, most worlds prohibit past or present Envoys from holding any political or military office. The fear elicited by the mere mention of Envoys is often used by Kovacs to threaten and intimidate. Reception Author Paul Di Filippo said of the character \\"Takeshi Kovacs has to be the worst friend you can have. Everyone who's affiliated with him eventually ends up slaughtered. His enemies die in smaller numbers than his buddies and allies. If you had a choice, you'd be wise to get on his bad side.\\" Adaptations In the Netflix series Altered Carbon, Kovacs is portrayed by Joel Kinnaman (in the body of Elias Ryker) in the show's first season, Will Yun Lee (original body), Byron Mann (Takeshi's prior body), and Morgan Gao (Young Tak). Anthony Mackie portrays the character in a different host body for the show's second season. Jihae played the character as a Torch Singer in the season 2 premiere episode. In the spin-off anime film Altered Carbon: Resleeved, Kovacs is voiced by Tatsuhisa Suzuki and Ray Chase in Japanese and English respectively. The television adaptation makes several significant changes to the source material of the novels, including changing the nature of the Envoys to freedom fighters, creating a relationship between Takeshi and Quellcrist Falconer, and changing the character of Reileen Kawahara to be Takeshi's sister (amongst many).

Nicknamed \\"Balkin' Bob\\" and \\"Balk-a-Day Bob\\" for his tendency to liberally invoke baseball's balk rule, Davidson was an umpire on the National League (NL) staff from 1982 to 1999, and he was on the combined MLB umpiring staff from 2005 to 2016. He worked one World Series (1992) and several other postseason series. A former baseball player at the University of Minnesota Duluth (UMD), Davidson spent several years umpiring in the minor leagues before he was promoted to the NL in 1982. In 1999, he was one of nearly two dozen umpires to participate in a mass resignation that was intended as a union bargaining tactic. The maneuver backfired when baseball officials simply replaced those umpires. During four years away from professional baseball, Davidson hosted a sports radio show and worked as a college baseball umpire. Davidson returned to minor-league umpiring in 2003. After prolonged negotiations and legal battles, baseball officials promoted Davidson back to the major leagues in 2007. Early life After graduating from Duluth East High School in Duluth, Minnesota, Davidson played baseball at the University of Minnesota Duluth. In the mid-1970s, Davidson went to umpiring school in St. Petersburg, Florida, with a friend and former Duluth East and UMD baseball teammate. Davidson graduated at the top of his class at the umpire academy, and he was given an assignment in the minor leagues. Davidson spent eight years as a minor-league umpire, and his assignments included the Midwest League, Florida State League, Southern League and the American Association. He also umpired in the Florida Instructional League and in a winter league in the Dominican Republic during those years. MLB career Davidson was on the full-time umpiring staff for the National League (NL) from 1982 to 1999. He wore uniform number 31 during his career in the NL. Davidson officiated in the 1992 World Series, as well as the National League Championship Series in 1988, 1991 and 1996. He also worked in the National League Division Series in 1995, 1998 and 2009, and in the 1987, 1993, and 2014 All-Star Games. Nicknamed \\"Balkin' Bob\\" or \\"Balk-a-day-Bob\\" due to his frequent balk calls, Davidson was voted by players and managers as one of the worst umpires in MLB, placing fourth-worst in a Sports Illustrated poll in 2011.Rosecrans, C. Trent, \\"MLB suspends umpire Bob Davidson and Phillies' Charlie Manuel\\", www.cbssports.com, Friday, May 18, 2012. Resignation Davidson resigned from the NL staff in 1999 as part of a failed mass resignation during labor negotiations. Instead of furthering negotiations, the resignations backfired when baseball officials accepted the resignations and replaced the umpires with people who did not belong to the union. Reflecting on the resignations several years later, Davidson criticized the move orchestrated by umpire union executive Richie Phillips, saying, \\"I went from being cocky, to just being plain dumb, to realizing I'm lucky I have a job. What we did in 1999 was just asinine. We were victims of our own success. Phillips had always beaten baseball, but baseball had enough. They called our bluff. It was a huge wake-up call.\\" During the baseball off-season and during his late 1990s hiatus from baseball, Davidson was a part-time talk show host for 850 KOA in Denver, the radio broadcast partner of the Colorado Rockies. Davidson said that he was not very good on talk radio, leading the station to dismiss him. He also umpired baseball at the collegiate level during the period after his resignation from the major leagues. In 2000, MLB officials negotiated with the dismissed umpires, agreeing to give Davidson and nine others their jobs back. However, the agreement was contingent upon Richie Phillips dropping his lawsuit against the league, and Phillips did not agree to do that. A December 2001 district court ruling upheld the terminations of Davidson and several other umpires. Return to umpiring Davidson was out of professional baseball until 2003, when he resumed umpiring in the minor leagues. His first minor-league assignment was in the Class A Northwest League. Davidson, who was making $160,000 per year in the major leagues, earned $1800 per month during the league's three-month season and he traveled by car between the league's baseball parks in the northwestern U.S and Canada. An article in the Seattle Post-Intelligencer estimated that Davidson might work his way back to the major leagues by 2008. In December 2004, he and fellow resignees Tom Hallion and Ed Hickox were guaranteed three of the next five positions on the MLB umpire staff, with Davidson reportedly guaranteed the first vacancy. Davidson returned in 2007 to umpiring MLB games after Joe Brinkman retired. Brinkman said that he was glad to find that his spot went to Davidson, because he considered Davidson a friend. Number 31 was worn by umpire Mike Reilly in the American League (AL), and it was assigned to Reilly when the AL and NL merged their umpiring staffs in 2000, so when Davidson returned to MLB he was assigned 61 as his new number. For the 2011 season, he wore number 6, later changing back to 61. Criticism and suspension Davidson was sometimes sharply criticized for his on-field performance, especially for the manner in which he handled confrontations. He was ranked the fourth-worst umpire in the major leagues in a 2011 poll of MLB players. That year, Aaron Gleeman of NBC Sports wrote that Davidson was \\"one of the worst and definitely the most confrontational umpire in baseball.\\" On May 15, 2012, during a game in Philadelphia, Davidson and Phillies' catcher Brian Schneider bumped into each other during a play involving a strike three wild pitch. Jason Castro, batting for Houston at the time, was able to safely make it to first base on the play. Davidson yelled into the Philadelphia dugout \\"You think I wanted to block his ass? What the hell are you yelling about?\\" http://philadelphia.phillies.mlb.com/mlb/gameday/index.jsp?gid=2012_05_15_houmlb_phimlb_1&mode;=wrap&c;_id=mlb#/play?content_id=21456561Video: Manuel's ejection These expletives were clearly audible on television broadcasts of the game. During the argument, Philadelphia manager Charlie Manuel was ejected by Davidson. Three days later, MLB suspended Davidson from umpiring one game because of \\"repeated violations of the Office of the Commissioner's standards for situation handling\\". According to MLB, the suspension resulted from a \\"culmination of several incidents\\" as well as Davidson's conduct during the argument with Manuel. Manuel was also suspended for one game. Other notable calls * On August 23, 1989, Davidson ejected Montreal Expos mascot Youppi! from a game against the Los Angeles Dodgers following repeated complaints from Dodgers manager Tommy Lasorda. * On October 21, 1992, Davidson missed Kelly Gruber's tag on Deion Sanders during Game 3 of the 1992 World Series, costing the Toronto Blue Jays a World Series Triple Play. * On September 21, 1998, Davidson controversially ruled that a ball hit by St. Louis Cardinals slugger Mark McGwire in Milwaukee County Stadium was an automatic double instead of a home run. Davidson said that a fan reached over the outfield fence to catch the ball, interfering with a ball in play. The home run would have been the 66th of the season for McGwire, who had broken Roger Maris's single-season home run record earlier that month. McGwire and Cardinals president Bill DeWitt said after watching replays that they thought it should have been ruled a home run, and DeWitt attempted to appeal the ruling to Major League Baseball. *On May 16, 2009, Davidson ejected Anaheim Angels pitcher John Lackey after just two pitches after the latter threw behind Texas Rangers second baseman Ian Kinsler, then hit him with the next pitch. It was Lackey's first start of the season after spending the first month on the disabled list. This came after Kinsler hit two home runs against the Angels the previous night. * On August 5, 2010, Gaby S√°nchez of the Florida Marlins hit a hard ground ball down the third base line which was ruled foul by Davidson. However, subsequent replays showed that the ball landed just in fair territory, bounced over the base and landed again in fair territory, sparking outrage from the Marlins dugout. The Philadelphia Phillies went on to win the game in ten innings by a score of 5‚Äì4. Davidson later stated, \\"In my opinion, where it goes over the bag, you can't tell. ... I'm very confident I got it right. What the ball did when it went past me is irrelevant.\\" * On September 8, 2010, Davidson ejected three people during a game between the St. Louis Cardinals and the Milwaukee Brewers.http://stlouis.cardinals.mlb.com/video/play.jsp?content_id=11838637&c;_id=mlb In the bottom of the 3rd inning, Davidson ejected Cardinals pitching coach Dave Duncan for arguing balls and strikes from the dugout. Later, during the bottom of the 5th inning, Davidson ejected Brewers batter Chris Dickerson after Dickerson threw his helmet and bat to the ground after taking a called third strike. The final ejection occurred during the bottom of the 7th inning when Davidson ejected a fan for heckling Cardinals catcher Yadier Molina. Personal life Davidson is married to Denise and has two daughters, Amber and Andrea, and two grandchildren, Alana and Brock. He resides in Colorado. In 2010, Davidson was elected into the University of Minnesota Duluth Athletic Hall of Fame.UMD Bulldogs - News Retirement Davidson announced his retirement at the end of the 2016 MLB season.

A long-time contributor to self-published philosophical web sites, including The Secular Web and Freethought Blogs, Carrier has published a number of books and articles on philosophy and religion in classical antiquity, discussing the development of early Christianity from a skeptical viewpoint, and concerning religion and morality in the modern world. He has publicly debated a number of scholars on the historical basis of the Bible and Christianity. He is a prominent advocate of the theory that Jesus did not exist, which he has argued in a number of his works. Carrier's methodology and conclusions in this field have proven controversial and unconvincing to specialists,Gathercole, Simon. \\"The Historical and Human Existence of Jesus in Paul‚Äôs Letters.\\" Journal for the Study of the Historical Jesus 16.2-3 (2018): 183-212. and he and his theories are often identified as \\"fringe\\". Background In his autobiographical essay, \\"From Taoist to Infidel\\", Carrier discusses his upbringing in a benign Methodist church, his conversion to Taoism in early adulthood, his confrontation with Christian fundamentalists while in the United States Coast Guard, and his deeper study of religion, Christianity, and Western philosophy, which eventually led to his embrace of naturalism. From 1995 to 2015, he was married to Jennifer Robin Carrier. Announcing their divorce, Carrier revealed that he is polyamorous, and that after informing his wife of his extramarital affairs, the last two years of their marriage had been an open relationship. In 2008, Carrier received a doctorate in ancient history from Columbia University, where he studied the history of science in antiquity. His thesis was entitled \\"Attitudes Towards the Natural Philosopher in the Early Roman Empire (100 B.C. to 313 A.D.).\\" He has published several articles and chapters in books on the subject of history and philosophy. For a number of years, Carrier was editor of and a substantial contributor to The Secular Web, where he wrote on the topics of atheism and metaphysical naturalism; these later formed the basis for his book Sense and Goodness without God. He also authored a regular column on the web site Freethought Blogs; this was suspended in 2016 amid allegations of sexual misconduct.PZ Myers. Richard Carrier's Blog. Carrier has frequently been a featured speaker at various skeptic, secular humanist, freethought and atheist conventions, such as the annual Freethought Festival in Madison, Wisconsin, the annual Skepticon convention in Springfield, Missouri, and conventions sponsored by American Atheists. Carrier strongly advocated a movement in atheism called \\"Atheism Plus\\" which held that being an atheist meant one had to have particular political agendas, not just lack a belief in god. Philosopher Massimo Pigliucci criticized Carrier for being very intolerant of people who disagreed with him or his atheistic views and for radicalizing the \\"Atheism plus\\" agenda. Pigliucci also quoted the originator of the \\"Atheism plus\\", Jen McCreight, criticizing Carrier: \\"Finally had time 2 read Richard Carrier's #atheismplus piece. His language was unnecessarily harsh, divisive & ableist. Doesn't represent A+.\\" In recent years, Carrier has been embroiled in several sexual misconduct scandals, having been accused of engaging in predatory and sexually aggressive behavior towards females at skeptic and atheist conventions. His behavior has resulted in him being uninvited and banned from Skepticon.https://the- orbit.net/almostdiamonds/2016/06/20/summarizing-current-allegations-richard- carrier/https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/acts-of- faith/wp/2018/09/06/americas-leading-atheist-accused-of-sexual-misconduct- speaks-out/ Public debates and other media Carrier has engaged in several formal debates, both online and in person, on a range of subjects, including naturalism, natural explanations of early Christian resurrection accounts, the morality of abortion, and the general credibility of the Bible. He debated Michael R. Licona on the Resurrection of Jesus at the University of California, Los Angeles on April 19, 2004. Carrier debated atheist Jennifer Roth online on the morality of abortion. He has defended naturalism in formal debates with Tom Wanchick and Hassanain Rajabali. He has debated David Marshall on the general credibility of the New Testament. His debates on the historicity of Jesus have included professor of religious studies Zeba A. Crook, Christian scholars Dave Lehman and Doug Hamp. The March 18, 2009 debate Did Jesus Rise From The Dead? with William Lane Craig was held at the Northwest Missouri State University and posted online in two parts by ReasonableFaithOrg (YouTube channel). Prior to the debate, Carrier commented that \\"I originally insisted we first debate [on the topic] Are the Gospels Historically Reliable? for the simple reason that you can't honestly debate the former until you've debated (and in fact settled) the latter.\\" In his post debate commentary, Carrier argued that Craig \\"focused almost entirely on protecting the Gospels as historical sources, and it was there that his shotgun of arguments got well ahead of my ability to catch up.\\" Another debate with Craig was broadcast on Lee Strobel's television show Faith Under Fire.Audio Archive of Debate The October 25, 2014 debate Did Jesus Exist? with Trent Horn was held in San Diego, California, and posted online by the \\"MABOOM Show\\" (YouTube channel). A debate with Craig A. Evans, entitled Did Jesus Exist? was held at Kennesaw State University on April 13, 2016, and posted online by KSUTV. In 2006, Carrier was the keynote speaker for the Humanist Community of Central Ohio's annual Winter Solstice Banquet, where he spoke on defending naturalism as a philosophy. Carrier appears in Roger Nygard's 2009 documentary The Nature of Existence, in which persons of different religious and secular philosophies are interviewed about the meaning of life.Imdb cast listing In 2007, famed English philosopher Antony Flew, who had long advocated atheism in the absence of empirical evidence of divinity, published his final book with co-author Roy Varghese, There is a God: How the World's Most Notorious Atheist Changed His Mind. Flew espoused the position that there was an intelligent creator, thereby embracing the concept of deism. Carrier wrote to Flew, and discussed the philosopher's supposed conversion on The Secular Web. In Carrier's analysis he came up with an incorrect theory that There is a God was authored primarily by Varghese, and misrepresented Flew's opinion regarding religion. Without addressing Carrier directly, Flew released a rebutting statement through his publisher: \\"My name is on the book and it represents exactly my opinions. I would not have a book issued in my name that I do not 100 percent agree with. I needed someone to do the actual writing because I'm 84 and that was Roy Varghese's role. This is my book and it represents my thinking.\\" Publications Carrier's best-known works concern the development of early Christianity and atheism, as well as modern views of religion and philosophy. Criticism of Hitler's Table Talk In collaboration with Reinhold Mittschang, Carrier challenged several anti- Christian statements attributed to Adolf Hitler in a collection of monologues known as Hitler's Table Talk. Carrier's paper argues that the French and English translations are \\"entirely untrustworthy\\",\\"'Hitler's Table Talk': Troubling Finds.\\" German Studies Review 26 (3): 561‚Äì576. and suggests that translator Fran√ßois Genoud doctored portions of the text to enhance Hitler's views.Carrier (2003), p. 565. Carrier put forward a new translation of twelve quotations, based on the German editions of Henry Picker and Werner Jochmann, as well as a fragment of the Bormann-Vermerke preserved at the Library of Congress, challenging some of the quotations frequently used to demonstrate Hitler's hostility to Christianity. Carrier concludes that Hitler's views in Table Talk \\"resemble Kant's with regard to the primacy of science over theology in deciding the facts of the universe, while remaining personally committed to a more abstract theism.\\"Carrier (2003), p. 574. Carrier also maintains that throughout Table Talk, Hitler takes a cynical view of Catholicism, \\"voicing many of the same criticisms one might hear from a candid (and bigoted) Protestant.\\"Carrier (2003), p. 573. In a new forward to Table Talk, Gerhard Weinberg comments that \\"Carrier has shown the English text of the table-talk that originally appeared in 1953 and is reprinted here derives from Genoud's French edition and not from one of the German texts.\\"Weinberg, Gerhard (2003). Foreword In Hugh Trevor-Roper, ed. 2003. Hitler's Table Talk 1941‚Äì1944. New York: Engima Books, p. xi Derek Hastings cites Carrier's paper for \\"an attempt to undermine the reliability of the anti-Christian statements.\\" Carrier's thesis that the English translation should be dispensed with entirely is rejected by Richard Steigmann-Gall, who while acknowledging the controversies raised by Carrier,Steigmann-Gall, Richard (2003). The Holy Reich: Nazi conceptions of Christianity, 1919‚Äì1945. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, pp. 255‚Äì256. \\"ultimately presume[d] its authenticity.\\"Steigmann-Gall, Richard (2007). Christianity and the Nazi Movement. Journal of Contemporary History 42 (2): 208. ' Johnstone writes that Carrier only purports to show that four of the forty-two anti-Christian comments in Table Talks have been misrepresented, without discussing the rest; for this reason Johnstone contends that Carrier has been far from successful in removing the historical view of Hitler's anti-Christian character.Johnstone, Nathan. The New Atheism, Myth, and History: The Black Legends of Contemporary Anti-Religion. Palgrave Macmillan, 2018, 90. The empty tomb In \\"The Spiritual Body of Christ and the Legend of the Empty Tomb\\", Carrier argues that the earliest Christians probably believed that Jesus received a new spiritual body in the resurrection, and that stories of his original body disappearing from his tomb were later embellishments. Alternatively, he suggests the possibility that Jesus' body was stolen or misplaced. Carrier's analysis was criticized by philosophy professor Stephen T. Davis and Christian theologian Norman Geisler. Science education in the Early Roman Empire This was Carrier's dissertation with some expansion. Here he attempts to describe the Roman education system that pertained to the sciences and how Jews and Christians held different views, which set the stage for dark ages. Michiel Meeusen, in his review, states the work had issues such as \\"whiggism employed in dealing with ancient science and scientists.\\" The scientist in the Early Roman Empire This book is a follow up to his dissertation \\"Science Education In The Early Roman Empire\\". Carrier argues that science in the Roman world was very advanced and progressive and would have reached a scientific revolution in a few more centuries had Christians not stepped in. In it he argues that Christians held back science for over a thousand years while ignoring or forgetting the scientific advancements of pagans. In Cristian Tolsa's review of the book, he notes that Carrier's view of science as essentially unaltered since Aristotle is a reductionist view that is inaccurate of the time period and that the book has \\"serious anachronisms\\". He also observes that Carrier fails to demonstrate the supposed stagnation of science from the Roman period to the modern period, but mainly assumes such is the case and relies on focusing on the advances made by pagans as enough to show that science really would have continued to grow indefinitely. Historicity of Jesus Earlier in his career, Carrier was not interested in the historicity of Jesus. His first thought was that it was a fringe theory, not worthy of academic inquiry; but a number of individuals requested that he investigate the subject, and raised money for him to do so. Since then, Carrier has become a vocal advocate of the theory that Jesus was not a historical person. In Not the Impossible Faith: Why Christianity Didn't Need a Miracle to Succeed (2009), Carrier writes on the social and intellectual context of the rise and early development of Christianity. Despite his initial skepticism of Christ myth theory, since late 2005 Carrier has considered it \\"very probable Jesus never actually existed as a historical person.\\" In a blog entry from 2009, he writes \\"though I foresee a rising challenge among qualified experts against the assumption of historicity [of Jesus], as I explained, that remains only a hypothesis that has yet to survive proper peer review.\\" In Proving History: Bayes's Theorem and the Quest for the Historical Jesus (2012), Carrier describes the application of Bayes' theorem to historical inquiry in general, and the historicity of Jesus in particular. According to Carrier, the Bayes theorem is the standard by which all methodology for any historical study must adhere in order to be logically sound. In his Bayesian analysis, the ahistoricity of Jesus is \\"true\\": that is, the \\"most probable\\" Bayesian conclusion. By the same methodology, Carrier posits that Jesus originated in the realm of mythology, rather than as a historical person who was subsequently mythologized. Carrier argues that the probability of Jesus' existence is somewhere in the range of 1/3 to 1/12000, depending on the estimates used for the computation. A number of critics have rejected Carrier's ideas and methodology, calling it \\"tenuous\\", or \\"problematic and unpersuasive\\". Simon Gathercole writes that Carrier's arguments \\"are contradicted by the historical data.\\" In On the Historicity of Jesus: Why We Might Have Reason for Doubt (2014), Carrier continues to develop his Bayesian analysis of the historicity of Jesus. Carrier described his work as \\"the first comprehensive pro-Jesus-myth book ever published by a respected academic press and under formal peer review.\\" The essence of his argument is that there is insufficient evidence, in the context of Bayesian probability, to believe in the historicity of Jesus. Furthermore, Carrier posits that as a celestial figure, Jesus was probably known originally only through private revelations and hidden messages in scripture, which were then elaborated into an allegorical person, communicating the claims of the gospels. The allegorical aspect of Jesus was then lost during the struggle for control of the Christian churches during the first century. Noting that the gospels were written decades after Jesus' death, Carrier claims that the gospels are \\"wildly fictitious\\", and proposes that the Gospel of Mark is really an extended meta-parable. He further claims that post-biblical writings mentioning Jesus should not be regarded as independent sources for his existence, since they may have relied on the gospels for their information.Raphael Lataster. Questioning the Plausibility of Jesus Ahistoricity Theories ‚Äî A Brief Pseudo-Bayesian Metacritique of the Sources. The Intermountain West Journal of Religious Studies, 2015, 75. Apart from the hero archetype pattern, Carrier contends that nothing else in the Gospels is reliable evidence for or against the historicity of Jesus. Celestial Jesus In 2002, Carrier reviewed the work of Earl Doherty, who posited that Jesus was originally a mythological being who subsequently came to be regarded as a historical person. Carrier concluded that Doherty's theory was plausible, although at the time he had not yet concluded that this hypothesis was more probable than the historical Jesus. He also criticized some of Doherty's points, which he considered untenable, although he regarded the basic concept as coherent and consistent with the evidence.Did Jesus Exist? Earl Doherty and the Argument to Ahistoricity Over time, Carrier's views shifted to the point that he accepted Doherty's premise as the most likely explanation of Jesus. He wrote, \\"It does soundly establish the key point that Jesus was regarded as a pre-existent incarnate divine being from the earliest recorded history of Christianity, even in fact before the writings of Paul, and that this was not even remarkable within Judaism.\\"Bart Ehrman on How Jesus Became God Elaborating on this hypothesis, Carrier asserts that originally \\"Jesus was the name of a celestial being, subordinate to God, with whom some people hallucinated conversations\\", and that \\"The Gospel began as a mythic allegory about the celestial Jesus, set on earth, as most myths then were.\\" Stories developed placing Jesus on Earth, and placing him in context with historical figures and places. Subsequently, his worshipers came to believe that these allegories referred to a historical person. Carrier asserts that the idea of a pre-Christian celestial being named \\"Jesus\\" is known from the writings of Philo of Alexandria on the Book of Zechariah.Carrier, On the Historicity of Jesus, pp. 200‚Äì05. He argues that Philo's angelic being is identical to the Apostle Paul's Jesus: he is God's firstborn son, the celestial 'image of God', and God's agent of creation.Richard Carrier. Why We Might Have Reason for Doubt: Should We Still Be Looking for a Historical Jesus?. Bible and Interpretation, 2014. However, Larry Hurtado contends that the figure named \\"Jesus\\" in Zechariah is a completely distinct figure, and that the Logos Philo discusses is not an angelic being at all.Larry Hurtad. Gee, Dr. Carrier, You‚Äôre Really Upset! 2017. In Carrier's view, Paul's reference in Romans 1:3 to Jesus being the \\"seed\\" of David describes his incarnation from a \\"cosmic sperm bank\\",Carrier, On the Historicity of Jesus, p. 577. rather than the usual interpretation of Jesus as a descendant of David. In Carrier's interpretation of Paul, Jesus possessed a surrogate human body, and thus the religious requirement of a blood sacrifice was fulfilled by his crucifixion by demons.Carrier, On the Historicity of Jesus, p. 570. Gathercole, however, notes that Paul's reference in Romans 1:3 is a common expression in the Septuagint, which simply refers to a \\"descendant\\", and that the theme of the descendants of David is common throughout the Old Testament.Gathercole, Simon. \\"The Historical and Human Existence of Jesus in Paul‚Äôs Letters.\\" Journal for the Study of the Historical Jesus 16.2-3 (2018): 191, n. 32. Carrier argues that like the school of early Jewish mysticism (100 BC‚Äì AD 1000), known as Merkabah mysticism, together with its views on the heavens and firmaments of creation, \\"Mythicism places the incarnation of Jesus below the heavens... being the whole vast region between the earth and the moon [the firmament], was well-established in both Jewish and pagan cosmology (see Element 37, Chapter 4, OHJ, pp. 184‚Äì93).\\"Carrier, On the Historicity of Jesus, pp. 184‚Äì193. Jewish and Hellenistic syncretism Carrier notes four major trends in religion, occurring prior to the formation of Christianity: syncretism, the development of monotheism, the transformation of agricultural salvation cults into personal salvation cults, and cosmopolitanism. Carrier writes that \\"Mithraism was a syncretism of Persian and Hellenistic elements; the Mysteries of Isis and Osiris were a syncretism of Egyptian and Hellenistic elements. Christianity is simply a continuation of the same trend: a syncretism of Jewish and Hellenistic elements. Each of these cults is unique and different from all the others in nearly every detail‚Äîbut it's the general features they all share in common that reflect the overall fad that produced them in the first place, the very features that made them popular and successful within Greco-Roman culture.\\"Carrier, On the Historicity of Jesus, p. 100. Furthermore, Carrier says; > Christianity, as a Jewish sect, began when someone (most likely Cephas, > perhaps backed by his closest devotees) claimed this [celestial deity] > \\"Jesus\\" had at last revealed that he had tricked the Devil by becoming > incarnate and being crucified by the Devil (in the region of the heavens > ruled by Devil), thereby atoning for all of Israel's sins... It would be > several decades later when subsequent members of this cult, after the world > had not yet ended as claimed, started allegorizing the gospel of this > angelic being. By placing him in earth history as a divine man, as a > commentary on the gospel and its relation to society and the Christian > mission. Reception and criticism On the Historicity of Jesus was positively reviewed by collaborator and fellow mythicist Raphael Lataster in the Journal of Religious History, who concurs that according to the gospels, \\"Jesus fits almost perfectly\\" the Rank-Raglan mythotype, and claims that there is \\"not a single confirmed historical figure\\" that conforms to the mythotype. However, most contemporary scholarship has been critical of Carrier's methodology and conclusions. Both classicists and biblical scholars agree that there is a historical basis for a person called Jesus of Nazareth. Writing in 2004, Michael Grant stated, \\"In recent years, 'no serious scholar has ventured to postulate the non-historicity of Jesus' or at any rate very few, and they have not succeeded in disposing of the much stronger, indeed very abundant, evidence to the contrary.\\"Michael Grant (2004), Jesus: An Historian's Review of the Gospels, page 200 More recently, Patrick Gray posited, \\"That Jesus did in fact walk the face of the earth in the first century is no longer seriously doubted even by those who believe that very little about his life or death can be known with any certainty.\\"Patrick Gray (2016), Varieties of Religious Invention, chapter 5, Jesus, Paul, and the birth of Christianity, Oxford University Press, p.114 For this reason, the views of Carrier and other proponents of the belief that a historical Jesus did not exist are frequently dismissed as \\"fringe theories\\" within classical scholarship.Robert M. Price (2010), Secret Scrolls: Revelations from the Lost Gospel Novels, p.200 Aviezer Tucker, previously an advocate of applying Bayesian techniques to history, expressed some sympathy for Carrier's view of the gospels, stating: \\"The problem with the Synoptic Gospels as evidence for a historical Jesus from a Bayesian perspective is that the evidence that coheres does not seem to be independent, whereas the evidence that is independent does not seem to cohere.\\" However, Tucker argues that historians have been able to use theories about the transmission and preservation of information to identify reliable parts of the gospels. He says that \\"Carrier is too dismissive of such methods because he is focused on hypotheses about the historical Jesus rather than on the best explanations of the evidence.\\" New Testament scholar Bart Ehrman writes that Carrier is one of only two scholars with relevant graduate credentials who argues against the historicity of Jesus. Discussing Carrier's theory that some Jews believed in a \\"humiliated messiah\\" prior to the existence of Christianity, Ehrman criticizes Carrier for \\"idiosyncratic\\" readings of the Old Testament that ignore modern critical scholarship on the Bible. Ehrman concludes by saying \\"[w]e do not have a shred of evidence to suggest that any Jew prior to the birth of Christianity anticipated that there would be a future messiah who would be killed for sins‚Äîor killed at all‚Äîlet alone one who would be unceremoniously destroyed by the enemies of the Jews, tortured and crucified in full public view. This was the opposite of what Jews thought the messiah would be.\\" Ehrman has also publicly addressed Carrier's use of Bayes' Theorem, stating that \\"most historians simply don't think you can do history that way.\\" He said he only knows of two historians who have used Bayes' Theorem, Carrier and Richard Swinburne, and noted the irony of the fact that Swinburne used it to prove Jesus was raised from the dead. Ehrman rejected both Carrier and Swinburne's conclusions, but conceded that he was unqualified to assess specifics about how they applied the theorem. \\"I'm not a statistician myself. I've had statisticians who tell me that both people are misemploying it, but I have no way of evaluating it.\\" Reviewing On the Historicity of Jesus, Daniel N. Gullotta says that Carrier has provided a \\"rigorous and thorough academic treatise that will no doubt be held up as the standard by which the Jesus Myth theory can be measured\\"; but he finds Carrier's arguments \\"problematic and unpersuasive\\", his use of Bayesian probabilities \\"unnecessarily complicated and uninviting\\", and he criticizes Carrier's \\"lack of evidence, strained readings and troublesome assumptions.\\" Furthermore, he observed that using Bayes theorem in history seems useless, or at least unreliable, since it leads to absurd and contradictory results such as Carrier using it to come up with low probability for the existence of Jesus and scholar Richard Swinburne using it to come up with high probability that Jesus actually resurrected. Gullotta also says that there is absolutely no evidence whatsoever, either documentary or archaeological, that there was a period when Jews or Christians believed that Jesus only existed in heaven as a celestial being, which is Carrier's \\"foundational\\" thesis, rather than living as a human being on earth. Carrier is observed to constantly misinterpret and stretch sources and he also uses extensively fringe ideas like those of Dennis MacDonald on Homeric epics paralleling some of the Gospels, while downplaying the fact that MacDonald is still a historicist, not a mythicist. Gullotta also observes that Carrier relies on outdated and historically useless methods like Otto Rank and Lord Raglan's hero myth archetype events lists, which have been criticized and rejected by most scholars of folklore and mythology, in which Carrier alters the quantity and wording of these lists arbitrarily to his favor. Gullotta describes the belief that a historical Jesus never existed as a \\"fringe theory\\" that goes \\"unnoticed and unaddressed within scholarly circles\\". Concerning the same book, Christina Petterson of the University of Newcastle writes, \\"Even if strictly correct, the methodology is tenuous. In addition, the numbers and the statistics seem like a diversion or an illusionary tactic which intentionally confuse and obfuscate\\". Unlike Gullotta, Petterson describes On the History of Jesus as somewhat amateurish: \\"Maths aside, nothing in the book shocked me, but seemed quite rudimentary first year New Testament stuff.\\" With respect to Carrier's argument that the later tales of a historical Jesus should be studied for their literary and rhetorical purpose, and not for their historical content, Petterson says that this \\"reveals Carrier's ignorance of the field of New Testament studies and early Christianity.\\" M. David Litwa of Australian Catholic University, in a discussion of Carrier's work with a focus on On the Historicity of Jesus, notes that Carrier portrays himself \\"as a kind of crusader fighting for the truth of secular humanism\\", whose mission it is \\"to prove Christianity (or Carrier's understanding of it) wrong.\\" He also notes that \\"Carrier's cavalier dismissal of the Bible and animosity toward the biblical deity would not seem to predispose him for careful biblical scholarship.\\" Litwa describes Carrier as \\"on the fringes of the academic guild\\", although he is a trained scholar and does employ scholarly methods. Litwa goes on to argue against several arguments made by Carrier in On the Historicity of Jesus. Litwa writes that Carrier's application of the Rank-Raglan mythotype to Jesus relies on forced similarities and that \\"the pattern ignores major elements of [Jesus's] life.\\" He also criticizes Carrier's attempts to derive Jesus from James Frazer's theory of the Near-Eastern dying-and-rising fertility god as relying on a \\"largely defunct\\" category in religious scholarship. He notes that few gods die and rise, usually staying dead in some way. Although Litwa acknowledges a parallel between the suffering experienced by dying deities and Jesus's suffering, he argues that pagan dying deities do not choose to die as Jesus does. Regarding Carrier's appeals to other ancient religious figures such as Romulus and the prophet Daniel who appear not to have existed, Litwa argues that Jesus is attested only twenty years after his death by Paul: \\"A name and a human character to go with it could not have been invented in this short period without invoking suspicion.\\" Litwa dismisses Carrier's hypothesis that Paul's Jesus was an angelic being crucified on the celestial plane as relying on \\"baseless\\" speculation that the second-century Ascension of Isaiah was available to Paul and that its mention of Jesus's birth on earth and his crucifixion in Jerusalem are later additions, despite scholarship to the contrary. Professor Emeritus Larry Hurtado of the University of Edinburgh writes that, contrary to Carrier's claims, Philo of Alexandria never refers to an archangel named \\"Jesus\\". Hurtado also states that the Apostle Paul clearly believed Jesus to have been a real man who lived on earth, and that the deities of pagan saviour cults, such as Isis and Osiris, were not transformed in their devotees' ideas from heavenly deities to actual people living on earth. Similar criticisms were voiced by Simon Gathercole of Cambridge, who concludes that Carrier's arguments, and more broadly, the mythicist positions on different aspects of Paul's letters, are contradicted by the historical data, and that Paul's description of Jesus' life on Earth, his personality and family, tend to establish that Paul regarded Jesus as a natural person, rather than an allegorical figure. In addition, Carrier's counter-consensus thesis that the early reference to Christ in the Roman historian Tacitus was a Christian interpolation has been recently rejected by Willem Blom, who finds that Carrier's thesis relies on unconvincing silences and mistaken understandings of the 1st and 2nd centuries.Blom, Willem JC. \\"Why the Testimonium Taciteum Is Authentic: A Response to Carrier.\\" Vigiliae Christianae 73.5 (2019): 564-581.

Soon afterward, he felt the call to priesthood and in 1857 began studying at the Pontificio Collegio Urbano de Propaganda Fide in Rome. He was ordained on June 14, 1862, and received a Doctor of Divinity degree the next year. Following his ordination, he served as Vice-Rector of the Pontifical North American College in Rome. In 1868, he became Rector of the college. During his time as Rector, the First Vatican Council was held, and was able to meet many American Bishops who stayed at the College while in Rome. Chatard was apparently a favorite of Pope Pius IX. On March 26, 1878 he was named Bishop of the Diocese of Vincennes, in Indiana. At his consecration in Rome on June 14, 1878, he switched his first and middle name, taking the name of Francis Silas. He was installed in the cathedral at Vincennes on August 11, 1878 and he went almost immediately to Indianapolis, arriving there on August 17, 1878. Said to be \\"the most scholarly clergyman in America\\", in 1883, Chatard was rumored as the new Archbishop of Philadelphia,\\"Bishop Francis s. Chatard\\", The New York Times, December 18, 1883 That appointment never took place for reasons unknown. Chatard did have some impact on the American Church, however. He aligned himself with the more conservative wing of the Church, led by Michael Corrigan of New York and others. The more progressive wing was led by the likes of Cardinal Gibbons and Archbishop Ireland. Sts. Peter & Paul Cathedral, Indianapolis While bishop, he oversaw the movement of the Episcopal see of the diocese of Vincennes to Indianapolis in 1898.Woods, Marcus Eugene II, \\"Chatard, Francis Silas Marean\\", The Encyclopedia of Indiana He established his see at Saint John the Evangelist Church, which served as the proto-cathedral for the diocese in Indianapolis from 1878 to 1906, when Saints Peter and Paul Cathedral was built. Following the move, he was named as the first bishop of the newly renamed Diocese of Indianapolis. In January 1899, he suffered a stroke, from which he never fully recovered. By the time of his death on September 7, 1918, at the age of 83, he had enormously changed the face of the Catholic Church in Indiana. During his tenure the Catholic population of the diocese increased from 80,000 to 130,000. His body was interred in the crypt of the Cathedral of Sts. Peter and Paul in Indianapolis. On June 8, 1976, Bishop Chatard‚Äôs remains were transferred from the cathedral to the Calvary Cemetery, Chapel Mausoleum, Indianapolis. The diocese of Indianapolis was split in 1944. The old see city of Vincennes became part of the new diocese of Evansville with Indianapolis being raised to the status of Archdiocese.

Antwerp Mannerism is the name given to the style of a group of largely anonymous painters active in the Southern Netherlands and principally in Antwerp in the beginning of the 16th century. The style bore no relation to Renaissance art or Italian Mannerism, which it mostly predates by a few years, but the name suggests a peculiarity that was a reaction to the \\"classic\\" style of the earlier Flemish painters. Name Adoration of the Magi by Anonymous Antwerp Mannerist The term Antwerp Manierists was first used in 1915 by Max Jakob Friedl√§nder in his work Die Antwerpener Manieristen von 1520, in which he made a first attempt to put order in the growing number of works from the Netherlands that were catalogued under the 'name of embarrassment 'pseudo-Herri met de Bles'.Max J.

Antwerp pictures for the European market 1500-1525 at Codart Artists Although attempts have been made to identify the individual artists that were part of this movement, most of the paintings remain attributed to anonymous masters as the paintings were not signed. This anonymity has contributed to a lack of knowledge about or popularity of their works. Only a minority of the works have been classified. The makers of the altarpieces have been given notnames based on any external knowledge about the works such as an inscription, a previous owner, the place where it was kept or a date found on the work such as the Pseudo-Bles, the Master of the Von Groote Adoration, the Master of Amiens, the Master of the Antwerp Adoration and the Master of 1518. Works that cannot be attributed directly to a named master are attributed to Anonymous Antwerp Mannerist. It has been possible to identify some of the artists. Jan de Beer, the Master of 1518 (possibly Jan Mertens or Jan van Dornicke) and Adriaen van Overbeke are some of the identified artists who are regarded as Antwerp Mannerists. The early paintings of Jan Gossaert and Adriaen Isenbrandt also show characteristics of the style. The paintings combine Early Netherlandish and Northern Renaissance styles, and incorporate both Flemish and Italian traditions into the same compositions. Virgin and Child by the Master of Hoogstraeten, c. 1510 Subjects and style The Antwerp Mannerists typically depicted religious subjects, which they interpreted generally in a more superficial manner than the Flemish artists of the previous century in favour of a more fluid form and an abundance of meticulously rendered details.\\"H. Bex-Verschaeren\\" \\"Meester van de Antwerpse aanbidding\\", in: Openbaar Kunstbezit, 1965 They also show a preference for a changing palette. Their compositions are typically chock-full of agitated figures in exotic, extravagant clothes. The compositions typically include architectural ruins. The architecture is initially Gothic but later Renaissance motifs become dominant.De schilderkunst der Lage Landen: De Middeleeuwen en de zestiende eeuw, Amsterdam University Press, 2006, p. 172-175 Many of the panels or triptychs produced by the Antwerp Mannerists depicted scenes of the Nativity of Jesus, usually situated at night, the Adoration of the Magi and the Crucifixion. The theme of the Adoration of the Magi was in particular dear to them as it allowed the artists to give free rein to their preoccupation with ornament and the simulation and imitation of luxury products.Elizabeth A.

Though uncredited, producer Dennis Muren also served as a second director. The film focuses on four teenagers picnicking in a California canyon, where they stumble upon an ancient book containing secrets of a strange world that exists alongside humans, and consequently unleash a plethora of evil creatures.Equinox. (eVideo, 2014)-WorldCat.org The film was originally conceived as a short by producer-director Muren‚Äîthen titled The Equinox: Journey into the Supernatural‚Äîwho developed and shot it with friends Dave Allen and Jim Danforth in 1967. After independent distributor Tonylyn Productions expressed interest in distributing the film, director Jack Woods was hired to direct additional footage and expand Muren's short into a full- length feature film. Equinox initially gained a reputation as a midnight movie during its theatrical run, but has in later years been noted for its economical yet sophisticated use of stop-motion special effects and cel animation, which were provided by Dave Allen and Jim Danforth; the latter later worked on Flesh Gordon, in which he animated a giant monster similar to the ones in Equinox. The film has been influential to the horror and sci-fi monster genres, receiving praise from filmmaker George Lucas and special effects artist Ray Harryhausen. It was released on DVD by the Criterion Collection in 2006. Plot Four young adults ‚Äì David Fielding, Susan Turner, Jim Hudson, and Jim's girlfriend, Vicki, head into the woods to look for a lost scientist, Dr. Arthur Waterman. They have a picnic and see a mysterious castle in the woods. They find that Dr. Waterman's cabin seems to have been destroyed. A forest ranger, who is Asmodeus in human form, watches over them. When the group stumbles into a cave, a strange old man presents them with an ancient book filled with magical lore and symbols. Asmodeus sends monsters ‚Äì a giant ape-like creature and a green-skinned, fur-clad giant ‚Äì to retrieve the book from them at all costs. The ape-like creature kills the old man. Reading through the book, David learns that it belonged to Dr. Waterman, who had experimented with its demon-summoning rituals. He lost control of the giant tentacled creature he conjured, however, which destroyed his house. The castle seems to have disappeared; however, the friends discover that it has been rendered invisible by magic. After killing Jim, Asmodeus reveals his true form, that of a winged red demon. Asmodeus kills Vicki and then attacks Dave and Susan. Dave and Susan flee to a cemetery and destroy the demon with a cross. As it dies, the cemetery explodes, killing Susan. Dave sees a shadowy giant who prophesies that Dave will be dead in one year and one day. Dave loses his sanity, and is confined to a mental hospital. One year and one day later, an evil-faced Susan arrives at the hospital to visit him. The film concludes with end credits saying \\"The End?\\". CastProduction=Development While studying business at Pasadena City College, producer and aspiring filmmaker Dennis Muren devised a short science fiction film, The Equinox ... A Journey into the Supernatural, with his friends Dave Allen and Jim Danforth. The short film was made on a budget of approximately $6,500. Tonylyn Productions, a small film company, liked the film enough to distribute it. Producer Jack H. Harris hired film editor Jack Woods, who previously worked with John Cassavetes, to direct additional footage in order to make Equinox into a feature-length film.Blobs, Demons, and Dark Stars: Remembering Jack H. HarrisThe CurrentThe Criterion Collection The American Film Institute notes that the final production budget was $8,000. Re-titled to simply Equinox, Muren was credited as associate producer in spite of having directed much of the film and creating the special effects himself. Filming Principal photography took place in Tujunga, California, and Griffith Park in Los Angeles. Jim Duron played both the Orderly and the Green Giant. Release Equinox premiered theatrically in Dallas, Texas on May 6, 1970. It later opened in Detroit on August 26, 1970, and in Los Angeles on March 31, 1971. Home media Not long after its original theatrical release, the film was made available in abridged Super 8 film reels designed for home exhibition. Equinox was released on DVD in June 2006 as release 338 in the Criterion Collection, including both the theatrical version and Muren's original production, the first time the latter was officially released. It also featured an introduction by the film's champion Forrest J. Ackerman.Equinox (1970)DVD ReviewHorrorview.com Critical response and legacy In his review of the film, Bill Gibron from DVD Talk wrote, \\"In a strange way, Equinox is The Evil Dead with Ray Harryhausen substituting for Sam Raimi. There are so many obvious connections that you have to imagine Sam and his clan came across this version somewhere in the formation of their film and starting taking stylistic notes. While it can't compare with Dead's decided darkness, Equinox manages to be an effective entertainment\\". Dave Sindelar from Fantastic Movie Musings and Ramblings gave the film a positive review, noting that \\"despite the obvious cheapness and the long shooting schedule which results in characters aging before your eyes\\", he felt the film was powerful and commended the film for its \\"compelling sense of Lovecraftian evil\\". Noel Murray from The A.V. Club rated the film a grade B, writing, \\"It's clear these guys had more ingenuity than resources, and watching Equinox is like a lesson in how to make something out of nothing.\\" Dennis Schwartz from Ozus' World Movie Reviews awarded the film a grade C, stating that the film was \\"noted only for its great special effects\\" Author and film critic Leonard Maltin gave the film 2 out of 4 stars, stating that the film \\"Mixes movie clich√©s with good special effects\\". Due to the similarities in their plots, Equinox is believed to have inspired Evil Dead, though this has not been confirmed.Equinox (1970), Lookback-Den of Geek It was seen by members of the crew of Evil Dead before production:Cinematic Soulmates: Equinox and The Evil Dead-Galaxy of Geek ReferencesSources  * External links   Backyard Monsters: Equinox and the Triumph of Love an essay by Brock DeShane at the Criterion Collection Equinox Equinox Equinox Category:American supernatural horror films Category:1970s monster movies Category:English- language films Category:Films using stop-motion animation Category:Films set in California Category:Amateur filmmaking Category:Demons in film Category:American monster movies ","title":"Equinox (1970 film)"},{"id":"4426513","text":"A Silylenoid in organosilicon chemistry is a type of chemical compound with the general structure R2SiXM where R is any organic residue, X a halogen and M a metal. Silylenoids are the silicon pendants of carbenoid and both compounds have carbene or silylene like properties. Silylenoids are encountered as reactive intermediates in chemical reactions. A stable silylenoid can be prepared by reaction of a fluorobromosilane with a silyllithium compound in THF : :(t-Bu2MeSi)2SiFBr + t-Bu2MeSiLi/THF -> (t-Bu2MeSi)2SiFLi.3THF + t-Bu2MeSiBr In this silylenoid the silicon atom is bonded with three substituents and not the usual four. X-ray diffraction shows that the Si-F bond with 170 pm is longer than usual for fluorosilanes. The F-Li bond is ionic with an estimated (in silico) positive charge of 0.88 residing on lithium and a negative charge of 0.74 on fluorine making it a t-Bu2MeSi)2SiF‚àí, Li+.3THF salt. The Si-F bond is likewise polarized with only 10% of the charge on silicon. When the silylenoid is irradiated or heated a disilene forms probably via a silylene intermediate. With electrophiles it reacts as an anion and with organolithium compounds it reacts as a silylene.

Midgley is an educator, management consultant and former US Army officer from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA. He has been on the faculties of Carnegie Mellon University, the University of Pittsburgh and the United States Military Academy, and held executive positions with Ernst & Young, the Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation and Center for Public Affairs before being asked to resign, Roland Berger Strategy Consultants and Commerce One. During the 2004-2005 academic year, he briefly held the presidency of the Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology, and subsequently joined TriNet, Inc. as Vice President, Human Capital Consulting, and then later Deloitte Consulting LLP. Midgley earned his Bachelor of Science degree from United States Military Academy in 1976. He also holds a degree in public policy from Harvard University and a Ph.D. from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Prior to his work in education and the private sector, Midgley served as a commissioned officer in the United States Army. There, he worked with Army General Staff, the Strategy Plans and Policy Directorate of the Organization of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and the U.S. mission to NATO. He was awarded the Meritorious Service Medal and the Army Commendation Medal. Midgley was chosen to be the 12th president of the Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology in 2004, after Samuel F. Hulbert, the engineering college's longest-serving president, stepped down. Strife between his administration and other parts of the Institute came swiftly. In January 2005 the president and the executive vice president of Rose-Hulman Ventures, a business and technology incubator affiliated with the Institute, abruptly asked to return to faculty status amid rumors of conflicts with Dr. Midgley. In March of that year, a memo citing concerns from the school's Faculty Affairs Committee was leaked to the Terre Haute Tribune Star, a local newspaper. A student-run website, called \\"About Midgley\\", soon appeared where faculty, students, and alumni posted their complaints and support. On 29 April 2005, a group of students held a rally citing concerns with Dr. Midgley, with some calling for him to step down. Days later, a faculty meeting approved a vote of no confidence 87 to 42, and forwarded a transcript of the meeting and the vote to the school's board of trustees. Midgley resigned from his position on 11 June 2005, less than a year after he took office. After leaving Rose, Midgley served as a Vice President at TriNet and as a civilian consultant to the US Combined Joint Interagency Task Force 435 deployed in Afghanistan. As of May 2016, he was a Director at Deloitte Consulting's defense consulting practice, concerning the Japan region.

No written documents of this settlement exist and the name Middle settlement is constructed by modern archaeologists. The red dots indicate known Norse farm ruins. The region was first settled by people of the Saqqaq culture arriving from the north. The area was resettled by the Norse between the 10th century and the 14th century. Thule people were the second southbound Inuit migration, to arrive in the region in the 15th century, with the area permanently settled since then. The discovery of cryolite in Ivittuut in the inner parts of Arsuk Fjord attracted the interest of the Danes during the colonial era, leading to the formal foundation of the settlement in 1805. The timber Lutheran church was built in 1830. The mines closed in 1987, with the Ivittuut settlement abandoned soon thereafter, leaving Arsuk on the economic periphery despite its tourism potential.

Born in Eschweiler, he applied to become a priest after graduation in school in 1974. After studying theology and philosophy at the Pontifical Gregorian University in Rome, he was ordained a priest on 10 October 1980. From 1981-85 he worked as chaplain at the St. Cornelius parish, Viersen- D√ºlken. He then worked at the Gregorian University, until he graduated as Doctor of Theology in 1990. Returning to his home diocese, he then worked in the general vicariate, as well as being an auxiliary priest appointed to support the parishes of Kornelim√ºnster/Walheim and Venwegen. In 1992 he became spiritual advisor at the Collegium Leoninum seminary in Bonn, 1997 also spiritual for the deacons. In 2002 he was appointed as priest for several parishes in Heimbach (Eifel), he also worked in the diocese for the beatification of Heinrich Hahn.

Coat of arms Coat of arms The coat of arms of Johannes B√ºndgens is based on the coat of arms of the diocese of Aachen, a black cross on a golden shield. The inner blue shield displays a golden \\"love knot\\" in the middle, symbolizing the love between God and men. It is also an allusion to his family name, which relates to the word bonding. It also looks similar to Celtic ornamentic plaits, which connects the coat of arms to his titular diocese of √Ård Carna in Ireland. A golden trefoil leaf above and below the knot also symbolizes the connection with Ireland, as well as his ancestry of farmers. The colors blue and golden were chosen as the colors of his hometown Eschweiler. The slogan of Bishop B√ºndgens is Mysterium magnum Ecclesia (This is a great mystery: but I speak concerning Christ and the church), taken from Epistle to the Ephesians (5:32).

Biography She was born in Napier to Bertrand and Ivy Bartlett (n√©e Boult). She attended Sacred Heart school in Napier and failed her University Entrance examination. In 1947, she became a primary school teacher. She entered a Sisters of Mercy (R.S.M.) convent at Hill Street in Wellington after her mother died in 1950. She left the cloister in 1969 to become increasingly involved in social conservative political activism.Carolyn Moynihan, A Stand for Decency: SPCS: Lower Hutt: 1995 In 1970, she founded the Society for Promotion of Community Standards (SPCS), which survived her death, albeit in much reduced circumstances. Bartlett remained the secretary of her organisation for 25 years, during which time SPCS campaigned against exposure of bared female breasts (1970) and won initial bipartisan support from social conservative New Zealand Labour Party and New Zealand National Party MPs and local government leaders in Wellington and Auckland. From its beginning, SPCS sought assistance from conservative Catholics and fundamentalist Protestants alike. SPCS membership would often come from kindred conservative Christian pressure groups, such as SPUC (the Society for the Protection of the Unborn Child - now Voice for Life, and the Christian Heritage Party (a fundamentalist Christian- based socially conservative political party outside Parliament, which is now defunct)Carolyn Moynihan, A Stand for Decency: SPCS: Lower Hutt: 1995 SPCS also networked with counterpart international Christian Right pro-censorship organisations elsewhere in the world such as Dr John H Court and the Adelaide- based Australian Festival of Light, Mary Whitehouse and her National Viewers and Listeners Association in the United Kingdom and Dr Judith Reisman and her \\"Institute for Media Education\\" within the United States. Over the years, she campaigned for theatre censorship, against the stage show Hair in Wellington, (1972) and prohibition of adolescent-oriented sex education books like Down Under the Plum Trees (1972). SPCS tried to have Stanley Kubrick's A Clockwork Orange and Last Tango in Paris (1972) prohibited, which led to New Zealand Film Society activism against SPCS attempts to stifle freedom of artistic expression throughout the late seventies and early eighties. In the 1977 Queen's Silver Jubilee and Birthday Honours, Bartlett was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire, for services to the community. In the mid- eighties, Bartlett and SPCS fell afoul of social change, as the High Court issued its Howley v Lawrence Publishing decision in 1986, shortly after the Fourth New Zealand Labour Government (1984‚Äì1990) passed the Homosexual Law Reform Act 1986 and decriminalised homosexuality. The High Court ruled that magazine presentations of gay men did not depict criminal acts per se, and over the course of the late 80s, conservative Christians found themselves hampered by new rigorous empirical justifications for censorship policy. Adjusting to the new circumstances, social liberal opponents of rigorous state censorship successfully used social scientific data to offset conservative claims within state censorship policy. Central government regulatory rationalisation led to consolidation of previously disparate film, video and publications censorship agencies spread across several New Zealand government departments into one body, the Office of Film and Literature Classification, in 1993 Paul Christoffels: Censored: A Short History of Censorship in New Zealand: Wellington: Department of Internal Affairs: 1989 In 1993, Bartlett was awarded the New Zealand Suffrage Centennial Medal. As time went on, Bartlett's elderly former patrons and pro-censorship activists died. In 1995, Bartlett learned she had inherited her own mother's cardiovascular problems, which meant her enforced retirement from public life. In 1996, she retired as SPCS Secretary, and lived quietly in Upper Hutt until her death in November 2000. She never married.\\"Anti-pornography battler Patricia Bartlett dies\\" Dominion Post: 11.11.2000: 9 Legacy Bartlett's pro-censorship campaigns contributed to a backlash against social conservatism in New Zealand during the eighties and nineties.

Rather than set forth any particular obligations, the rules of state responsibility determine, in general, when an obligation has been breached and the legal consequences of that violation. In this way they are \\"secondary\\" rules that address basic issues of responsibility and remedies available for breach of \\"primary\\" or substantive rules of international law, such as with respect to the use of armed force. Because of this generality, the rules can be studied independently of the primary rules of obligation. They establish (1) the conditions of actions to qualify as internationally wrongful, (2) the circumstances under which actions of officials,It can safely be ruled out that the military can be summoned for the execution of an order issued from his state in violation of a rule of international law: private individuals and other entities may be attributed to the state, (3) general defences to liability and (4) the consequences of liability. Until recently, the theory of the law of state responsibility was not well developed. The position has now changed, with the adoption of the Draft Articles on the Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts (\\"Draft Articles\\") by the International Law Commission (ILC) in August 2001.Draft Articles on the Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts, Report of the ILC on the Work of its Fifty-third Session, UN GAOR, 56th Sess, Supp No 10, p 43, UN Doc A/56/10 (2001). The Draft Articles are a combination of codification and progressive development. They have already been cited by the International Court of JusticeThe ICJ cited an earlier draft text of the Articles in Gabƒç√≠kovo-Nagyamaros Project (Hungary/Slovakia), ICJ Reports 1997, at 7. and have generally been well received. Although the articles are general in coverage, they do not necessarily apply in all cases. Particular treaty regimes, such as the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and the European Convention on Human Rights, have established their own special rules of responsibility.  History  Traditionally, the term \\"state responsibility\\" referred only to state responsibility for injuries to aliens. It included not only \\"secondary\\" issues such as attribution and remedies, but also the primary rights and duties of states, for example the asserted international standard of treatment and the right of diplomatic protection. Early efforts by the League of Nations and private bodies to codify the rules of \\"state responsibility\\" reflected the traditional focus on responsibility for injuries to aliens.See Y. Matsui, \\"The Transformation of the Law of State Responsibility\\" (1993) 20 Thesaurus Acroasium 1. The League's 1930 Codification Conference in The Hague was able to reach an agreement only on \\"secondary\\" issues such as imputation, not on substantive rules regarding the treatment of aliens and their property. Attempts to codify and develop the rules of state responsibility have continued throughout the life of the United Nations. It took nearly 45 years, more than thirty reports, and extensive work by five Special Rapporteurs in order for the International Law Commission to reach agreement on the final text of the Draft Articles as a whole, with commentaries. At the same time, the customary international law of state responsibility concerning matters such as detention and physical ill-treatment of aliens and their right to a fair trial has been rendered less important than formerly by the development of international human rights law, which applies to all individuals, whether aliens or nationals. The concept of a general regime of legal responsibility, which the rules of state responsibility have taken on, is an inception of the civil law system and is largely foreign to the common law tradition.  Codification  The topic of state responsibility was one of the first 14 areas provisionally selected for the ILC's attention in 1949.Report to the General Assembly, 1949 Yearbook of the International Law Commission 277, at 281. When the ILC listed the topic for codification in 1953, \\"state responsibility\\" was distinguished from a separate topic on the \\"treatment of aliens\\", reflecting the growing view that state responsibility encompasses the breach of an international obligation.1949 Year Book of the International Law Commission 46, 49-50, UN Doc. A/CN.4/SER.A/1949. The ILC's first special rapporteur on state responsibility, F.V. Garc√≠a Amador of Cuba, appointed in 1955 noted, \\"It would be difficult to find a topic beset with greater confusion and uncertainty.\\"F. V. Garc√≠a Amador, First Report on International Responsibility 1956 2 Yearbook of the International Law Commission 173 at 175, para. 6, UN Doc. A/CN.4/SER.A/1956/Add.1. Garc√≠a Amador attempted to return to the traditional focus on responsibility for injury to aliens but his work was essentially abandoned by the ILC when his membership ended in 1961. His successor, Roberto Ago of Italy, reconceptualised the ILC's work in terms of the distinction between primary and secondary rules, and also established the basic organisational structure of what would become the Draft Articles. By focusing on general rules, stated at a high level of abstraction, Ago created a politically safe space within which the ILC could work and largely avoid the contentious debates of the day. From 1969 until his election to the ICJ in 1980, Ago completed work on part 1 of the draft articles, addressing the origin of state responsibility. Most of the thirty-five articles adopted during his tenure are reflected in the final draft. Work on the remainder of the articles proceeded slowly throughout the 1980s and early 1990s. Willem Riphagen of the Netherlands, who served as special rapporteur to 1986, stressed that particular primary rules may specify the consequences of their breach - an idea conveyed by the articles through the recognition of lex specialis. Gaetano Arangio-Ruiz, special rapporteur from 1988, helped clarify the consequences of breaches of international obligations. Over the next eight years, the ILC completed its first reading of parts 2 and 3. In 1995, the United Nations General Assembly adopted a resolution in effect pressing the Commission to make progress on the state responsibility articles and other long-pending projects.GA Res. 50/45, para. 3 (Dec. 11, 1995). James Crawford of Australia, appointed as special rapporteur in 1996, approached the task pragmatically. The ILC moved rapidly through a second reading of the draft articles, adopting what it could agree on and jettisoning the rest, most notable of which was Article 19 on state crimes and the section on dispute settlement. Draft Articles The final text of the Draft Articles was adopted by the ILC in August 2001, bringing to completion one of the Commission's longest running and most controversial studies. On 12 December 2001, the United Nations General Assembly adopted resolution 56/83, which \\"commended [the articles] to the attention of Governments without prejudice to the question of their future adoption or other appropriate action.\\"GA Res. 56/83, para. 3 (Dec. 12, 2001). Crawford notes that the rules are \\"rigorously general in character,\\"James Crawford, The International Law Commission's Articles on State Responsibility: Introduction, Text and Commentaries (Cambridge University Press, 2002) at 12. encompassing all types of international obligations.  Internationally wrongful acts  According to the Draft Articles, an internationally wrongful act must: *be attributable to the state under international law; and *constitute a breach of an international obligation of the state.Note 1, Article 2. International crimes Earlier drafts of the Articles on State Responsibility contained Article 19, which provided for \\"state crimes\\".International Law Commission's Draft Articles on State Responsibility, 1991 Article 19 included the following provisions: 2\\\\. An internationally wrongful act which results from the breach by a State of an international obligation so essential for the protection of fundamental interests of the international community that its breach is recognized as a crime by that community as a whole constitutes an international crime. 3\\\\. Subject to Paragraph 2, and on the basis of the rules of international law in force, an international crime may result, inter alia, from: (a) a serious breach of an international obligation of essential importance for the maintenance of international peace and security, such as that prohibiting aggression; (b) a serious breach of an international obligation of essential importance for safeguarding the right of self- determination of peoples, such as that prohibiting the establishment or maintenance by force of colonial domination; (c) a serious breach on a widespread scale of an international obligation of essential importance for safeguarding the human being, such as those prohibiting slavery, genocide and apartheid; (d) a serious breach of an international obligation of essential importance for the safeguarding and preservation of the human environment, such as those prohibiting massive pollution of the atmosphere or of the seas. 4\\\\. Any internationally wrongful act which is not an international crime in accordance with paragraph 2 constitutes an international delict. Article 19 was deleted from the final Draft Articles.International Law Commission's Articles on Responsibility of States for internationally wrongful acts, as adopted 2001 However, the listed serious crimes of article 19 (3) are today covered by the scope of article 40 of the articles adopted in 2001. Article 40 (and 41) refer to State responsibility for violating peremptory norms (jus cogens norms) and the ILC commentaries to this provision refer to it encompassing the \\"serious crimes\\" of the previous article 19 (3).Report of the Commission to the General Assembly on the work of its fifty-third session (23 April ‚Äì 1 June and 2 July‚Äì 10 August) A/56/10 (2001) II (Part Two) Yearbook of the International Law Commission p. 113. Article 40 refers to the responsibility which a State can incur if it violates a jus cogens norm and article 41 refers to all the obligation for all States to co-operate in ensuring that such violations are stopped.The latter example of article 19 (3)(d), referring to \\"preservation of the human environment (incl. prohibiting massive pollution of the atmosphere or of the seas)\\", has led to discussion on whether environmental norms could, at some point, be considered norms of peremptory (jus cogens) character. See ch. 16-18 of Jesper Jarl Fan√∏ (2019). Enforcing International Maritime Legislation on Air Pollution through UNCLOS. Hart Publishing.  Attribution  Before a state can be held responsible for any action, it is necessary to prove a causal connection between the injury and an official act or omission attributable to the state alleged to be in breach of its obligations. This has become an increasingly significant contemporary issue, as non-state actors such as Al Qaeda, multinational corporations, and non-governmental organisations play greater international roles, and as governments privatise some traditional functions. The state is responsible for all actions of its officials and organs, even if the organ or official is formally independentNote 1, Art 5. and even if the organ or official is acting ultra vires.Note 1, Art 7. Persons or entities not classified as organs of the State may still be imputable, when they are otherwise empowered to exercise elements of governmental authority, and act in that capacity in the particular instance. Persons or entities not performing public functions may equally be imputable, if they in fact acted under the direction or control of the State.Note 1, Art 8. Where there is a breakdown of normal governmental authority and control, such as in so-called \\"failed states\\", the actions of those acting as the \\"government\\" in a de facto sense will be acts of the state.Note 1, Art 9. The acts of an \\"insurrectional or other movement that becomes the new government of an existing state or succeeds in establishing a new state\\" can also be attributed to the state.Note 1, Art 10. See further Liesbeth Zegveld, The Accountability of Armed Opposition Groups in International Law (Cambridge University Press, 2002). This is also the case where a state acknowledges and adopts the conduct of private persons as its own.Note 1, Article 11. Despite their apparent concreteness, the standards stated in some rules involve important ambiguities, and their application will often require significant fact-finding and judgment. Most rules state responsibility involving private acts already arise under primary rules. For example, environmental and human rights agreements require states to prevent abuses by private parties.  Defences  If the general elements to establish state responsibility are established, the question arises as to whether any defences may be available to the respondent state. These include force majeure (Article 23), distress (Article 24), state of necessity (Article 25) and counter measures (Articles 49-52), self-defence (article 21) and consent (article 20).  Consequences of breach  The breach of an international obligation entails two types of legal consequences. Firstly, it creates new obligations for the breaching state, principally, duties of cessation and non-repetition (Article 30), and a duty to make full reparation (Article 31). Article 33(1) characterises these secondary obligations as being owed to other states or to the international community as a whole. Articles indirectly acknowledges in a savings clause also that states may owe secondary obligations to non-state actors such as individuals or international organisations. Second, the articles create new rights for injured states, principally, the right to invoke responsibility (Articles 42 and 48) and a limited right to take countermeasures (Articles 49-53). These rights, however, are heavily state-centred and do not deal with how state responsibility is to be implemented if the holder of the right is an individual or an organisation. The principal element of progressive development in this area is Article 48, which provides that certain violations of international obligations can affect the international community as a whole such that state responsibility can be invoked by states on behalf of the larger community. This provision picks up on the ICJ's celebrated suggestion in Barcelona Traction that some obligations are owed erga omnes, toward the international community as a whole.Barcelona Traction, Light & Power Co. (Belgium v. Spain), New Application, 1970 ICJ Reports 4, 32.

Reparation  If illegal actions are continuing, the state has a duty to cease.Note 1, Art 30. The state also has duties to make reparation, which could involve restitution, compensation, or satisfaction. Remedies will be dependent on the particular forum, such as the United Nations, International Court of Justice, World Trade Organization, International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea, International Criminal Court, and on the purpose of reparation.Hardman Reis, T., Compensation for Environmental Damages under International Law, Kluwer Law International, The Hague, 2011, See also *Nuremberg Principles *Rule according to higher law *Sovereign state *Collective responsibility  Notes  Further reading  *Harriet Moynihan, \\"Aiding and Assisting: Challenges in Armed Conflict and Counterterrorism\\" (2016). *Helmut Philipp Aust, \\"Complicity and the Law of State Responsibility\\" (2011), *Daniel Bodansky and John R.

The risk of corruption can be minimized by taking all possible precautions against interruption. Installing firmware with errors, or for a different revision of the hardware, or installing firmware incompetently patched such as DVD firmware which only plays DVDs sold in a particular region, can also cause bricking. Devices can also be bricked by malware (malicious software) and sometimes by running software not intentionally harmful but with errors that cause damage. Some devices include two copies of firmware, one active and the other stored in fixed ROM or writable non-volatile memory and not normally accessible to processes that could corrupt it, as well as a way to copy the stored firmware over the active version, even if corrupt, so that if the active firmware is damaged, it can be replaced by the copy and the device will not be bricked. Other devices have minimal \\"bootloader\\" firmware, enabled usually by operating a switch or jumper, which does not enable the device to work normally but can reload the main firmware. Types Bricking is classified into two types, namely hard and soft, depending on the device's ability to function. Hard brick Hard bricked devices generally show little to no signs of life. A hard bricked device does not power on or show any vendor logo; the screen remains turned off or blank. Some of the major reasons for hard bricking include installing firmware not intended for the device, severe physical damage, interrupting a firmware flashing procedure, or following a flashing procedure incorrectly. In the case of Android devices, some kernel bugs have been known that affect the /data partition in the eMMC chip, which becomes corrupted during certain operations such as wiping and flashing. Recovering from a hard brick is generally considered difficult and requires the use of a more direct programming interface to the device; such an interface usually exists, as there must be a way to program the initial firmware on an unprogrammed device. However, additional tools or connections may be needed. Most devices can be bricked in a variety of ways. Resolution generally follows a process of analyzing the boot process, determining the sub-type of hard brick, and making changes with the help of external (non-bricked) devices. Soft brick A \\"soft bricked\\" device may show signs of life, but boots unsuccessfully or may display an error screen. Soft bricked devices can usually be fixed; for example, a soft bricked iOS device may display a screen instructing the user to plug it into a computer to perform an operating system recovery using iTunes software. In some cases, soft bricked devices are unable to be repaired without physical repairs being carried out; an example of this would be an iOS device locked with iCloud Activation Lock, of which the only solution is to contact the owner of the iCloud account the device is locked to, or to replace the entire logicboard with a non-locked board. Unbricking Some devices that become \\"bricked\\" because the contents of their nonvolatile memory are incorrect can be \\"unbricked\\" using separate hardware (a debug board) that accesses this memory directly.Neo1973 Debug Board v2/Unbricking - Openmoko This is similar to the procedure for loading firmware into a new device when the memory is still empty. This kind of \\"bricking\\" and \\"unbricking\\" occasionally happens during firmware testing and development. In other cases software and hardware procedures, often complex, have been developed that have a good chance of unbricking the device. There is no general method; each device is different. There are also user-created modifier programs to use on bricked or partially bricked devices to make them functional. Examples include the Wiibrew program BootMii used to fix semi- bricked Nintendo Wiis, the Odin program used to flash firmware on Samsung Android devices,Unbrick Android phones and tablets or the fastboot Android protocol which is capable of reflashing a device with no software installed. A soft bricked rooted Kindle Fire can be unbricked by using unrooting tools. A personal computer may be unbricked by using System Restore or backup. Systems In principle any device with rewritable firmware, or certain crucial settings stored into flash or EEPROM memory, can be bricked. Many, but not all, devices with user-updatable firmware have protection against bricking; devices intended to be updated only by official service personnel generally do not. Amongst devices known to have bricking issues are: older PCs (more recent models often have dual BIOSes or some other form of protection), many mobile phones, handheld game consoles like the PlayStation Portable and Nintendo DS, video game consoles like the Nintendo Wii, Xbox 360, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, many SCSI devices and some lines of hard disk drives and routers. At least some older consumer market router models can become unresponsive when the user tries to define a subnet mask that does not contain one contiguous run of 1s and then 0s. If even a single bit is set so that it breaks one of the runs, the router may become bricked, unresponsive to any standard troubleshooting or resolving procedures listed in the manual. Unbricking the router may require opening the case, shorting some jumper pins on the board, then connecting the router by the USB cable to an old PC with USB 1.1 hardware, running a special DOS level program supplied by the manufacturer, and powering the router up. This procedure will flash the router to factory settings and original firmware. Electric cars such as the Tesla Roadster (2008) can brick if the battery is completely discharged.Tesla Motors' Devastating Design Problem Sometimes an interrupted flash upgrade of a PC motherboard will brick the board, for example, due to a power outage (or user impatience) during the upgrade process. It is sometimes possible to unbrick such a motherboard, by scavenging a similar but otherwise broken board for a BIOS chip in the hopes that the BIOS will work even halfway, far enough to boot from floppy. Then it will be possible to retry the flash process. Sometimes it is possible to boot from a floppy, then swap the old presumably dead BIOS chip in and reflash it. On some Gigabyte boards, it can also be possible to reflash the bricked main BIOS using a backup BIOS. Some vendors put the BIOS chip in sockets, allowing the corrupted BIOS chip to be removed and reprogrammed using an external tool, like a universal programmer or an Arduino. Online and mobile services Mobile phones have a fixed identification code, the IMEI; a telephone reported stolen can have its IMEI blocked by networks‚Äîpreventing their ability to be used as mobile devices. iOS offers a similar \\"Activation Lock\\" feature via the \\"Find My iPhone\\" security software, where a device can be remotely prevented from operating (even after it has been erased), protected by the owner's Apple ID. Devices that have a strong dependency on online services in order to function may be bricked after services are discontinued by the manufacturer, or some other technological factor (such as expired security certificates or other services quietly becoming unavailable) effectively prevents them from operating. This can happen if the product has been succeeded by a newer model and the manufacturer no longer wishes to maintain services for the previous version, or if a company has been acquired by another or otherwise ceases operations, and chooses not to, or is no longer able to maintain its previous products. The practice has especially been scrutinized within the Internet of things and smart home markets. Bricking in these cases have been declared a means to enforce planned obsolescence.

It is the administrative center of Dolyna Raion (district). Population: . In 2001, population was around 20,900. History The city's history reaches the 10th century, making it one of oldest in the region. By the 14th century Dolyna became renowned for its salt mine. In 1349 the city came under the rule of the Kingdom of Poland, where it remained until 1772 (see Partitions of Poland). In 1525 Dolyna, or Dolina, as it is called in Polish, was granted city rights under the Magdeburg law and the right to trade salt similar to that of Kolomyia. In 1740 in the city there was a riot of opryshky (Ukrainian rebels). In 1772 the city fell to Austrians and in 1791 it lost its status. During the second half of the 19th century a railroad line linking Stryi with Stanislaviv was led through the city. By the end of the 19th century big fires destroyed the town completely. The first decade of the new century was dedicated to the revival of the town. After the collapse of Austria-Hungary, reborn Polish and Ukrainian states struggled for control over Dolyna in a fratricidal war won by Poles (see Polish-Ukrainian War). In the Second Polish Republic, the town, with population of almost 10 000, belonged to the Stanis≈Çaw√≥w Voivodeship and was the capital of the Dolina County. Neighboring villages were inhabited by German settlers, who came there in the times of Joseph II. During World War II the city was occupied by the USSR (September 1939 - June 1941), Hungary (July 1941), and Germany (August 1941-1944). During the German occupation, the Jewish population of Dolyna was murdered with only a few survivors. Most were murdered in Dolyna itself, including on August 3, 1942 when German police and their Ukrainian police auxiliaries drove 3500 Jews into the market square. They shot numerous children, sent some of the able bodied to labor camps, and took the remaining 2500 to the Jewish cemetery where they were shot. After the Germans removed valuables from the bodies, they ordered locals to bury the bodies in a mass grave. Some Jews had hidden and fled to the forests to join Jewish partisan groups. However, Ukrainian policeman and the Germans hunted down those in hiding and murdered them too. After the war, Dolyna became part of the Ukrainian SSR. In the 1950s, oil deposits were discovered in the region which by 1958 produced 65% of oil extracted in the Ukrainian SSR. In the 1960s, the Dolynske oil field was the oil field that produced the largest amount of oil of the whole USSR. Dirty lands. As Kolomoisky struggles with the community for the sake of oil profits, Economichna Pravda (10 April 2018) Since 1991, Dolyna has been in independent Ukraine. Its oil field is one of the most powerful of Ivano-Frankivsk Oblast (region). People Most prominent among the people hailing from the city was Myroslav Ivan Lubachivsky, Major Archbishop of Lviv and head of the Ukrainian Church. Among other notable inhabitants of Dolyna, there is Rudolf Regner, a hero of the Polish World War II resistance.

A Democrat and attorney from the rural town of Columbia, he first served in other state offices. In 1967 he gained passage after his first term of a constitutional amendment to allow governors to serve two successive terms. He was the first governor of his state in the twentieth century to be elected and serve two consecutive terms. He strongly advocated the construction of the Louisiana Superdome in New Orleans. He had served in the US Army in the Pacific Theater during World War II. During the Civil Rights era, in 1965 McKeithen intervened in events in Bogalusa, Louisiana, to end violence after the Ku Klux Klan continued to violently resist change for African Americans, following passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. He established a commission to work on social transition in the state.  Early life  McKeithen was born in the village of Grayson just south of Columbia in Caldwell Parish, the son of contractor and farmer, Jesse J. McKeithen and the former DeEtte Eglin. He graduated from high school there and attended college in High Point, North Carolina. While in North Carolina he befriended Terry Sanford . In 1942, he earned his law degree from Louisiana State University Law Center in the capital city of Baton Rouge. From 1942‚Äì1946, during World War II, McKeithen served as a first lieutenant in the 77th Infantry Division, United States Army in the Pacific Theater of Operations. He fought in the battles of Guam, Gulf of Leyte, Ie Shima, and Okinawa. He was awarded two Bronze Star Medals and the Distinguished Service Cross.Affirmed on the John McKeithen obelisk gravestone, Hogan Cemetery, Caldwell Parish, Louisiana After the war, McKeithen started practicing law in Columbia. On June 14, 1942, he married a young teacher, Marjorie \\"Margie\\" Howell Funderburk (September 30, 1919 - March 24, 2004). She had a twin sister, Margaret Funderburk. Reared in Winnsboro, Marjorie graduated from Louisiana Tech University in Ruston. She taught mathematics and chemistry at Jena High School in Jena and, thereafter, at the Ward 5 School in Caldwell Parish. The McKeithens had six children: their oldest son was Jesse Jay McKeithen (1943‚Äì1998). Their son Fox McKeithen (1946‚Äì2005) became a politician, being elected as State Representative and Louisiana Secretary of State. Their daughters are Rebecca Ann, Melissa Sue, Pamela Clare, and Jenneva Maude.Information on Marjorie McKeithen gravestone, Hogan Cemetery, Caldwell Parish, Louisiana Marjorie McKeithen was the homemaker at their Hogan Plantation, yielding the spotlight to her popular husband, whom she affectionately called \\"J. J.\\" State legislator and public service commissioner McKeithen joined the Democratic Party, still the only competitive party in the state since disenfranchisement of blacks at the turn of the century. He was elected as a Louisiana state representative in 1948. He became a prominent floor leader for Governor Earl Kemp Long. As a legislator, McKeithen consistently voted for tax increases, believing that the government had to invest in the state. In the 1948 session, he supported the implementation of the 2 percent state sales tax, a 2-cent-per-gallon increase in gasoline taxes, higher tobacco and alcohol levies, taxes on chain stores, greater severance taxes, and higher rates on electricity.Minden Press, Minden, Louisiana, November 18, 1963, p. 9 In 1952, as a 33-year-old state legislator, McKeithen was an unsuccessful Democratic primary candidate for lieutenant governor on a slate headed by gubernatorial candidate Carlos Spaht and supported by the Longs. The \\"anti-Longs\\", led that year by Judge Robert F. Kennon of Minden, won the governorship and other top positions. In a runoff election, McKeithen lost the lieutenant governor's race to C. E. \\"Cap\\" Barham of Ruston, who had originally run on the gubernatorial intra-party ticket with U.S. Representative Thomas Hale Boggs, Sr., of New Orleans. Barham switched to the Kennon ticket in the runoff against McKeithen. Once in office, Kennon and Barham were often at odds. McKeithen was elected to the Louisiana Public Service Commission, serving from 1955 to 1964. In the 1954 Democratic primary for the PSC, he defeated incumbent Harvey Broyles and a second challenger, Louis S. \\"Buck\\" Hooper (1902‚Äì1984). Because Louisiana was essentially a one- party Democratic state due to the disenfranchisement of blacks since the turn of the century, McKeithen was unopposed in the general election. During the primary campaign, he had called for an investigation regarding the disparity in charges between in-state and out-of-state long-distance telephone calls, having noted that it was cheaper to call from Shreveport to Jackson, Mississippi, than from Shreveport to Monroe.Minden Herald, 9 July 1954, p. 2 McKeithen represented Huey Long's old north Louisiana district, and was described as making populist attacks on the Southern Bell Telephone Company. He was credited with preserving the traditional nickel telephone call, when most states had raised rates to a dime or higher at pay phone outlets. (In the early 21st century, this service is very rare in the age of individual cellular phones.) In the 1960 Democratic primary, McKeithen defeated Hooper again.Minden Press, July 25, 1960 When McKeithen left the PSC after being elected as governor, he appointed John S. Hunt, II (1928‚Äì2001), of Monroe, a nephew of Governors Huey and Earl Long, to finish his term. In 1966 Hunt won a six-year term on the PSC in the Democratic runoff primary, defeating State Representative John Sidney Garrett of Haynesville. McKeithen supported the choice of Garrett as Speaker of the Louisiana House.  Election as governor, 1963‚Äì64  In his gubernatorial race, McKeithen retained the young political consultant Gus Weill to manage the campaign. A Lafayette native, Weill had earlier done similar work for Jimmie Davis, a former governor. After the election, Weill served during the first term as McKeithen's executive secretary. In the first primary in December 1963, McKeithen faced a wide array of intra-party opponents, including former Governor Robert Kennon; Shelby M. Jackson, who was a segregationist Education Superintendent; and Addison Roswell Thompson, a taxicab operator from New Orleans who was known to be a high-ranking Wizard of the Ku Klux Klan. Frank Voelker, Jr., of Lake Providence, the former chairman of the Louisiana State Sovereignty Commission, ran too but did poorly in polls, and withdrew to become Kennon's campaign manager. Kennon finished in fourth place in the primary. Three LSU scholars described McKeithen as he launched his first gubernatorial campaign by the following: > McKeithen is ... dependent on identification with the Longs for establishing > himself initially in the campaign. His organizational supporters are much > less impressive than those behind [U.S. Representative] Gillis Long. He is > obviously intent on strengthening his Long identification by emphasis on his > proximity to Earl Long and neutralizing Gillis Long's strength by tying him > to the national party and localizing his own candidacy. ... His potential > for victory appears secondary to his capacity to split essential votes that > might seriously injure Gillis Long's efforts. At the same time, the > situation is fluid enough that McKeithen cannot be counted out > altogether.William C. Havard, Rudolf Heberle, and Perry H. Howard, The > Louisiana Elections of 1960, Baton Rouge: Louisiana State University > Studies, 1963, p. 101 McKeithen, with Earl Long's widow, Blanche Long as his campaign manager, fought to win the backing of the still-influential 'Longite' forces. He otherwise ran on a reform platform, promising to \\"clean up the mess in Baton Rouge.\\" He also ran as a defender of segregation, having criticized what he described as the meddling of U.S. President John F. Kennedy in Louisiana politics. McKeithen benefited from grass-roots support generated by Aubrey W. Young of Monroe, an organizer for Alcoholics Anonymous; he later worked to establish drug and alcohol treatment programs through the Louisiana Department of Health and Hospitals. McKeithen emerged in the primary in second place to frontrunner DeLesseps Story \\"Chep\\" Morrison, Sr., with Gillis Long third and Robert Kennon fourth. In the runoff campaign, McKeithen rallied the supporters of fifth-place finisher Shelby Jackson by warning of the dangers of a NAACP \\"bloc vote\\" for Morrison. McKeithen won the runoff, 492,905 (52.2 percent) to 451,161 (47.8 percent). Though he had maintained segregation, he indicated that he welcomed African-American support in the primary. A low percentage of African Americans had managed to register to vote, overcoming the state's barriers. The Republican Party, which they had supported during Reconstruction, had been fatally weakened for decades as blacks had been essentially excluded from politics since the turn of the 20th century. McKeithen ran as a populist. The following quote from his 1963‚Äì64 campaign is inscribed on his tomb: > I wasn't born to material wealth, nor do I have claim to an aristocratic > name. But if I am elected governor, it will prove that any mother's son can > aspire to the highest political office of this state. I've come this far > because you the people have given me your support ‚Äì with all the > professional politicians, power brokers and big money people fighting me > every step of the way. Because I owe you so much, you can be assured when I > raise my hand to take the oath of office as Governor of Louisiana, there > will be a prayer in my heart that God will always guide me to do what is > best for the state and all the people in it. We'll win this race, but I need > your help. Won't you help me? Edward Kennon, a nephew of former Governor Robert Kennon and a Minden contractor who later held McKeithen's former seat on the Louisiana Public Service Commission, campaigned actively against McKeithen in the 1963‚Äì1964 gubernatorial race. Kennon recalled that McKeithen in the 1960 PSC campaign boasted of his support from both organized labor and its long-term president Victor Bussie and the NAACP. At the time, candidates in Louisiana were identified on the ballot by race.Minden Herald, January 9, 1964, p. 10 McKeithen said, \\"There's room in Louisiana for all people, for all races. They must be treated with dignity and respect without ridicule and without abuse.Minden Herald, October 13, 1963 In his campaign advertising, he railed against bloc voting by African Americans, which he said \\"results in government that is anti-business and which penalizes the man who is willing to work for a living.\\"McKeithen advertisement, Minden Herald, January 9, 1964, p. 8 McKeithen overcame the conservative Republican Party candidate Charlton Havard Lyons, Sr., a Shreveport oilman, in the first seriously contested Louisiana gubernatorial general election since Reconstruction. McKeithen defeated Lyons, 469,589 (60.7 percent) to 297,753 (37.5 percent).  McKeithen as governor =First term McKeithen was inaugurated in Baton Rouge on May 12, 1964. Judge James E. Bolin of Minden administered the oath of office. C. H. \\"Sammy\\" Downs, an aide and adviser to the governor, was the master of ceremonies for the festivities. McKeithen's two terms as governor were characterized by economic expansion and job creation. He pushed for expansion of the state's industrial sector and called a special session to create a Labor Management Commission of Inquiry to resolve a strike in Baton Rouge early in his first term. He offered tax concessions to bring new industry to the state, particularly along the Mississippi River corridor between New Orleans and Baton Rouge. In 1966 and 1967, he conducted a \\"right to profit\\" campaign. After he antagonized organized labor, the governor received death threats, and a bomb exploded in the state senate chamber. McKeithen signed legislation establishing a state code of ethics for elected and appointed public officials, the investment of idle funds to bring additional interest income to the state, and disclosure of the state's previously secret unclassified payroll, three proposals sponsored in the state House by Representative Joe Henry Cooper of Mansfield in northwestern Louisiana. When McKeithen was elected, Louisiana governors were limited by law to one term, as the legislature wanted to retain control. Politicians had to sit out a term if they wanted to seek second or third terms as governor. McKeithen sponsored \\"Amendment 1\\" in the 1966 general election, which voters approved. He could seek a succeeding second term in the 1967‚Äì1968 election cycle. McKeithen named Aubrey Young as his aide-de-camp and as a colonel in the Louisiana State Police. He removed Young in 1967 after reports surfaced of a bribery attempt and involvement with mobster Carlos Marcello. Life Magazine reported that when McKeithen threatened to fire Young over the proposed bribery, Young resigned. McKeithen's other close advisors included former State Senator William R. \\"Billy\\" Boles, Sr., a high-powered Monroe attorney and banker, and Theodore \\"Ted\\" Jones, who advised him on the newly established federal Medicare program. McKeithen also depended strongly on Senator Sixty Rayburn of Bogalusa, a favorite of organized labor, and the Democrat constituency groups. He named Leon Gary, former mayor of Houma, as his director of the Department of Public Works. In 1969, he replaced Gary with his executive counsel C. H. \\"Sammy\\" Downs, who served until 1972. In 1967, McKeithen elevated Ralph Perlman, a business graduate of Columbia University in New York, as the state budget director. Perlman held this position for twenty-one years, under four governors of both parties. He named the Louisiana Tech University English professor Robert C. Snyder, who worked to establish the Lincoln Parish Library, to the state board of library commissioners. In 1967, McKeithen named David Wade, a retired Lieutenant General of the Air Force, as director of the Louisiana Department of Public Safety and Corrections. The next year, he assigned him as adjutant general of the Louisiana National Guard. McKeithen considered returning the colorful state Senator Dudley J. LeBlanc of Abbeville to the position of Senate President Pro Tempore, a slot that LeBlanc had filled from 1948 to 1952. The governor changed his mind as opposition developed; LeBlanc was considered politically damaged from the 1950s by his promotion of the patent medicine Hadacol. McKeithen tapped E. W. Gravolet of Pointe √† la Hache as the Senate President Pro Tempore. Vail M. Delony of East Carroll Parish was the Speaker of the Louisiana House of Representatives until his death in 1967, when the position passed to John Sidney Garrett of Claiborne Parish. McKeithen recruited African Americans into his administration, including Jesse N. Stone, a Bienville Parish native, whom he named to head the Louisiana Commission on Human Relations, Rights and Responsibilities. Stone was later appointed as president of the Southern University System, serving from 1974‚Äì1985.  Re-election campaign, 1967 McKeithen's reelection campaign of 1967 was, for all practical purposes, held on November 8, 1966, when voters approved his \\"pet\\" Amendment 1, which for the first time allowed Louisiana governors to succeed themselves‚Äîfor one additional four-year term. They could also sit out a term and return for a third or fourth term thereafter, as Edwin Washington Edwards did in 1983 and 1991. In September 1966, McKeithen announced while at the Southern Governors Conference in Gilbertsville, Kentucky, that he would run again if Amendment 1 were approved.\\"McKeithen to Succeed Himself If Possible\\", Minden Press-Herald, September 20, 1966, p. 1 Opponents of Amendment 1 included former governor Jimmie Davis and two of his past political associates, legislative floor leader State Representative Risley C. Triche of Napoleonville and Fred W. Huenefeld, Jr. (born December 1929), Davis' welfare director from Monroe. McKeithen's rival from 1963, Gillis Long, also worked against the amendment. Supporters of Amendment 1 included Victor Bussie of the AFL-CIO, U.S. senators Allen J. Ellender and Russell Long, the Republican physician Alton Ochsner of New Orleans, and most of the state newspapers, including the New Orleans Times-Picayune, the Baton Rouge Morning Advocate, Alexandria Daily Town Talk, Shreveport Times, and the since defunct Shreveport Journal.Minden Press- Herald, November 7, 1966, p. 6 McKeithen was so popular that he easily took the 1967 Democratic Party primary. His main opponent was freshman U.S. Representative John Rarick, a conservative Indiana-born politician from the Sixth District of St. Francisville. He was backed by elements of the Ku Klux Klan. Rarick did not warm to rural voters, and his strict constitutionalist views did not appeal to many in the statewide electorate. People responded positively to McKeithen's folksy mannerisms and trademark \\"Won't you 'hep me?\\" appeal. Aware of heightened feelings among many in the state against civil rights, which had achieved national legislation authorizing enforcement of the franchise for African Americans, Republicans did not field a candidate for governor in the general election on February 6, 1968. McKeithen used his influence to defeat a state senator in northwestern Louisiana. Harold Montgomery of Doyline was unseated after two terms by a challenger of the same surname but no relation, attorney John Willard \\"Jack\\" Montgomery from Minden. The 1968 Presidential Election In the spring of 1968 McKeithen was approached by Representative Hale Boggs and Vice President Hubert H Humphrey with an offer to become Humphrey's running mate: the thinking was that as a Southern Governor McKeithen could bring balance to the Democratic ticket. McKeithen seriously considered the offer. However, the chaos at the Democratic National Convention lead him to reconsider. In the event he wasn't selected. During the fall campaign McKeithen endorsed the election of Humphrey for the U.S. presidency. He had been neutral in the 1964 contest between Lyndon B. Johnson and Barry M. Goldwater. The support for Humphrey brought McKeithen into conflict with local backers of George C. Wallace, a former Democratic governor of Alabama who ran on the American Independent Party ticket, which opposed the civil rights laws that Congress had passed. McKeithen ally C. H. \\"Sammy\\" Downs worked in the Wallace campaign.\\"George Wallace Slates Dinner in Shreveport\\", Minden Press-Herald, August 1, 1968, p. 1 In the 1972 and 1976 campaigns he supported the candidacy of his long-time friend, former North Carolina Governor Terry Sanford. Second term as governor During his second term, pushing for the construction of the Superdome in New Orleans was one of McKeithen's priorities. He believed that it would help stimulate tourism and businesses in the port city. Despite initial misgivings by many, McKeithen was responsible for gaining approval of construction of the Louisiana Superdome, as it was originally called, by the Legislature. He asserted the benefits of associated economic development would be worth the high cost. McKeithen faced legislative opposition by a group of mostly young reformers known as the \\"Young Turks.\\" One of their leaders was Robert G. \\"Bob\\" Jones, a state representative from Lake Charles and the son of former Governor Sam Houston Jones. Jones objected to state funding of the Superdome in New Orleans and many state bond projects. The Young Turks favored a \\"pay-as-you- go\\" approach, rather than too much bonded indebtedness. Jones ran unsuccessfully for governor in 1975. In 1968, McKeithen launched a campaign to remove deadheads, or workers performing few productive tasks, from the state payroll. He faced a $61 million shortfall in the upcoming budget.Minden Press- Herald, June 14, 1968, p. 1 In 1970 he gained passage of a 2-cent sales tax increase to fund higher pay for teachers and state employees. He worked to expand construction on many public college and university campuses. He reformed the Department of Corrections and improved conditions at Angola State Penitentiary. In the summer of 1968, McKeithen's life was threatened after he began an investigation into labor-management racketeering. One man admitted to having received $5,000 to kill the governor. McKeithen's security was enlarged, and no further threats were reported.\\"McKeithen Under Guard After Assassination Plot\\", Minden Press-Herald, June 26, 1968, p. 1 In 1968, McKeithen suspended the controversial, colorful Sheriff Jessel Ourso of Iberville Parish, who was indicted in a repeated series of federal and state corruption charges. Ourso received acquittals or hung juries in all of them. He died in office in 1978 at the age of forty-six. McKeithen tapped freshman state Representative Chris Faser, Jr., of Baton Rouge, a confidant of former Governor Jimmie Davis, as the administration floor leader in the state House during the second term. McKeithen's administration was criticized in the national press. Journalist David Chandler reported in Life magazine that the Mafia had influence in Louisiana's state government. Thirty-nine state and local officials were eventually indicted for illegal activities, but no ties were found to McKeithen himself. The McKeithen administration lost popularity in its second term in part because of voter opposition to a one-cent increase in the state sales tax in the summer of 1970. This was levied to fund pay increases for teachers and state employees.\\"McKeithen Says He Is a Lover, Not a Fighter\\", Minden Press-Herald, April 11, 1972, p. 8. There was also a three- cent rise in cigarette taxes. The new revenues were projected to generate $120 million. In 1970, McKeithen said that he believed national social unrest had become especially harmful to the nation. In a civic address to the American Legion in Minden, he said: > Our country has gone too far to protect individual rights of citizens. We > are now protecting the very persons who are trying to destroy our country > from within. Russia, with all its might, would not dare to try to destroy > the United States by force, but we are allowing the radicals, the scum of > the country, to begin to destroy us from within.\\"McKeithen Challenges Legion > Members Here\\", Minden Press-Herald, 11 November 1970, p. 1 In 1971, McKeithen appointed Lake Charles attorney Henry L. Yelverton to a 14th Judicial District judgeship. Later, Yelverton served on the Third Circuit Court of Appeal. McKeithen and race McKeithen, presiding over Louisiana during the turbulent civil rights era, had an ambiguous record on race relations. He was elected in 1964 as a segregationist and used race-baiting rhetoric in his campaign. He fought publicly with President Lyndon Johnson's Office of Economic Opportunity and tried to appoint segregationist Shelby Jackson to head the state's management of federal War on Poverty funds. As late as 1965, McKeithen publicly stated his support for segregation as the best system for Louisiana, but he later moderated his views on race relations. He personally intervened to stem racial violence in Bogalusa in 1965. After repeated attacks by the KKK on civil rights activists in this mill town and resistance to change authorized by national legislation, African Americans founded a chapter of the Deacons for Defense and Justice, an armed self- defense group. That summer there were numerous violent confrontations. McKeithen established a Biracial Commission on Human Rights, Relations, and Responsibilities to work on easing tensions and managing transition. He appointed Israel Augustine and Ernest \\"Dutch\\" Morial as Louisiana's first African-American judges since Reconstruction. But during 1967 disturbances, McKeithen took a hard line, threatening to have authorities shoot looters and rioters. McKeithen later became a national spokesperson for the opposition to busing school children to achieve integration. John Martzell, a New Orleans attorney and executive secretary of the State Human Relations Commission from 1966 to 1972, said that McKeithen's efforts to promote racial harmony remained little known. In 1969, McKeithen sent 250 Louisiana National Guard troops into Baton Rouge to support a curfew declared by Mayor-President, W. W. Dumas. He was trying to suppress rioting that had broken out after police fatally shot a fleeing 17-year-old black suspect. The officer was temporarily suspended from the force, as was customary. Dumas said he would fully support police in such instances. Former Governor George Wallace of Alabama urged McKeithen in 1967 to take the leadership against the civil rights movement, but he declined, having told Wallace, \\"I just don't feel as strongly about it as you do, George.\\" In April 2016, nearly half a century after events, The Monroe News- Star reported that McKeithen in the summer of 1965 arranged for $10,000 of private funds to be sent to Bogalusa to be divided equally between leaders of the Ku Klux Klan leadership and the Deacons for Defense, to keep peace during racial demonstrations in Washington Parish. McKeithen's counselor, Gus Weill, said that the payments \\"bought peace\\". The payments were made through the now defunct Fountain Insurance Agency in Baton Rouge, the owner of which was a member of the Louisiana State Sovereignty Commission. McKeithen supporters helped raise the funds for this purpose. The unnamed agent mailed \\"insurance checks\\" to the recipients' homes and was later reimbursed by the Sovereignty Commission, since disbanded. The late James C. Kelly, a police chief in Monroe known for his opposition to the KKK, was found to have been a conduit for other payments to Klan leaders. The Federal Bureau of Investigation noted that rank-and-file Klansmen were at first unaware of the payments to their leaders, but they began to question the loyalty of the leadership after learning that Chief Kelly had paid $200 to Houston Morris, a leader in Monroe. Achievements Edward F. Renwick, director of the Loyola University New Orleans Institute of Politics and specialist on McKeithen's career, credited him with four major accomplishments: beginning to end segregation in Louisiana, gaining approval for construction of the Superdome, leadership in the passage of a state constitutional amendment to permit governors to serve two successive four-year terms, and developing consensus politics. In his last days as governor in the spring of 1972, McKeithen spoke before the AFL-CIO convention. He credited union president Victor Bussie with having helped him to achieve what McKeithen considered the landmarks of his tenure in office: industrial expansion, improved race relations, prison reform, and increases in the pay of teachers and state employees. The latter required an unpopular increase in 1970 from 2 to 3 cents in the state sales tax.\\"McKeithen Says He Is a Lover, Not a Fighter\\", Minden Press-Herald, April 11, 1972, p. 8 The McKeithen administration had some instances of corruption. In January 1972, former public works director C. H. \\"Sammy\\" Downs, who had served as a state senator from Alexandria, was indicted by a federal grand jury in connection with the sale of voting machines to the state.\\"'As long as people run, stealing will occur', says Downs\\", Minden Press-Herald, March 30, 1972, p. 1 McKeithen's commissioner of administration, W. W. McDougall, was indicted in March 1972 for giving false statements to a grand jury in Alexandria concerning an investigation into insurance company kickbacks to state legislators.\\"McDougall Resigns Administration Post\\", Minden Press-Herald, March 8, 1972, p. 1 In his April 1972 speech, McKeithen told the union delegates that he abhorred corruption in government. He discouraged the idea that all public servants were corrupt, saying: > There are too many people with evil minds and evil hearts that can't help > but believe that anybody in public office can't help but steal everything > that isn't nailed down. After governorship The John J.

He died fourteen months before his father. After he left office in the spring of 1972, McKeithen sought the U.S. Senate seat vacated by the death of Allen J. Ellender, a long- term Democratic incumbent. The filing deadline had closed for the Democratic primary, so McKeithen ran as an Independent in the general election. He had to explain to Democratic-registered voters, the great majority of the Louisiana electorate at the time, why they should vote for him. In 1963, he had stressed voting by party affiliation as a reason why registered Democrats should support him against the Republican candidate Lyons. He lost to the Democratic nominee, J. Bennett Johnston, Jr., a former Louisiana state Senator. The Republican Senate nominee in the contest was Ben C. Toledano, a lawyer and journalist who had run for mayor of New Orleans in 1970. A fourth candidate was Hall Lyons, a Lafayette oilman and the younger son of Charlton Lyons. Hall Lyons left the Louisiana GOP to run for the Senate as the nominee of the American Independent Party. George C. Wallace of Alabama had run as an AIP candidate for U.S. President in 1968 against Nixon and Hubert Humphrey. In 1972 Republicans Richard M. Nixon and Spiro T. Agnew easily carried Louisiana in the presidential election, as white conservatives in Louisiana and other southern states were voting more solidly for national Republican candidates. (white conservatives have since mostly shifted into the Republican Party.) In 1983, Governor David C. Treen, a Republican, appointed the Democrat McKeithen to the LSU Board of Supervisors. He served until 1988, resigning because of exhaustion and a heavy work schedule.Minden Press-Herald, July 29, 1988, p. 1 In his later years, McKeithen practiced law in Columbia and in Baton Rouge with his granddaughter, Marjorie. She was named for his wife, her grandmother. In 1991, McKeithen made headlines by resigning from his local country club after it barred a black high school golfer from playing in a tournament there. McKeithen became a close friend of Sam Hanna, Sr., publisher of the Franklin Sun in Winnsboro, the Concordia Sentinel in Ferriday, and later The Ouachita Citizen in West Monroe. The McKeithens' younger son, W. Fox McKeithen (1946‚Äì2005), became an attorney and politician like his father. He was elected to the Louisiana legislature, serving two terms (1984‚Äì1988). In 1987 he was elected as secretary of state, serving 1988‚Äì2005. After his first election as secretary of state in 1987, he switched his party affiliation to Republican. Both his father and daughter, who were staunchly Democratic, were surprised. His daughter ran for Louisiana's 6th congressional district seat in Baton Rouge in 1998. When Fox McKeithen died in 2005, Sam Hanna Sr. wrote a moving column about his relationship with all the McKeithen family. In 1993, McKeithen was among the first thirteen inductees into the Louisiana Political Museum and Hall of Fame in Winnfield. Fox McKeithen was inducted posthumously in 2006. John McKeithen died in 1999. Hogan Cemetery McKeithen is interred in the private Hogan Cemetery, which bears the same name as his estate. His wife Marjorie and their two sons, Jesse Jay McKeithen and Walter Fox McKeithen, were also buried at the gravesite. It is located off Louisiana Highway 559. Behind the graves is a wooded area alongside scenic Long Lake. References * Dawson, Joseph G. The Louisiana Governors: From Iberville to Edwards. Baton Rouge: LSU Press, 1990. * Miriam G. Reeves.

July 2014 to July 2019, he was the Minister-President of Flanders. He previously worked as a lawyer at the Kortrijk bar, and served as a member of the Belgian federal parliament for the Volksunie (1995-2001) and for the N-VA (2001-2004). Biography Geert Bourgeois‚Äôs father, Emiel Bourgeois, was born in Hulste on 10 October 1918, towards the end of the First World War. He went on to work as a primary school teacher. After the Second World War he was accused of collaboration and spent some time in prison. He was subsequently rehabilitated and appointed headmaster at the primary school where he had previously been teaching. He died in 1998. Emiel Bourgeois married Izegem-born Gaby Vens (1920-2015), with whom he had two sons and two daughters. Geert Bourgeois attended secondary school at Saint Joseph‚Äôs College in Izegem before he went on to read law at Ghent University from 1970 to 1975. That same year, he married Betty Hoste with whom he set up a law firm. The couple have two sons. Bourgeois was politically engaged from an early age.[6] During his time at secondary school, he became a member of the Catholic Student Action (Katholieke Studentenactie - KSA). In 1966 he set up, along with his brother Kris and his class mate Koen Baert, a Blue Banner group of Father Boucquillon. When the group later merged with the VNJ (Flemish Nationalist Youth League), he left the local chapter. He later became involved with the Flemish Nationalist Student Union (Vlaams-Nationale Studentenunie) and the Language Action Committee (Taal Aktie Komitee). At the age of 17, he became the secretary of the local Volksunie branch and the chairman of the Volksunie Youth Wing of Izegem.[7] Political career=Local politics Bourgeois took part in the municipal council elections for the first time in 1976. He was elected into office with 997 preferential votes. As he still had to comply with his national service obligations, he was unable to take up his seat until 1977. In 1982, he was re-elected, with the Volksunie joining the city council. Bourgeois served as Alderman for Public Works, Town and Country Planning, Town Centre Regeneration, Trade, Small Business Owners & Industry and Legal Affairs. He has consistently been re-elected ever since. After the 1988 elections, he again became Alderman in the municipal council, an office he held until 1994. The 1994 elections put a different majority coalition in power in Izegem. He continued to sit as a member of the Izegem municipal council until 2018 and did not stand again in the municipal council elections held that same year.[8] From 2013 until 2018, he chaired the Izegem municipal council. National politics From 1977 onwards, Geert Bourgeois ran in all national elections. He joined the national board of the Volksunie party, and from 1990 until 1993 served as chairman of the Association of Flemish (political) Office Holders. In 1996, he joined the Volksunie party leadership. In the 1995 elections, he was elected as a member of the federal parliament. In the federal Chamber of Representatives, he primarily focused on legal affairs and matters concerning Belgium‚Äôs different Communities. Even though he served as a member of the opposition, he managed to get several private member‚Äôs bills of his adopted, such as the Protection of Sources Act, which means that reporters are now only required to reveal the identity of their sources in the event of an emergency. He gained nationwide acclaim for his activities as a member of the Dutroux Committee and the role he played in the Octopus negotiations. In 1999, Bourgeois became leader of the Volksunie political group in the Chamber of Representatives. The following year he was elected general party chairman by the membership of what was then the Volksunie, which saw sitting party chairman Patrik Vankrunkelsven ousted. This election sparked a series of conflicts between the party chairman, who had been directly elected by the members, and the VU‚Äôs party board, appointed by the party leadership. The differences in opinion came to a head at the time of the Lambermont Agreement. Bourgeois was not prepared to back this agreement, in spite of the fact that it had been approved by the Volksunie‚Äôs party board. As such, he did not approve it, thus acting contrary to the relevant instructions of the competent bodies within the party. Headed up by then Minister Bert Anciaux, the party board got behind the agreement, in response to which Bourgeois stepped down as party chairman. Around this time, Geert Bourgeois put together the so-called \\"Oranjehofgroep\\" (which would go on to become the bedrock of the N-VA) along with people such as Frieda Brepoels, Eric Defoort, Ben Weyts and Bart De Wever. The Oranjehofgroup was a group of Flemish nationalist Volksunie members who opposed the direction in which the party was being taken by Anciaux. The group derived its name from a Ghent hospitality business where the members would meet. The antagonisms between Bourgeois's Flemish Nationalist wing which wanted the VU to pursue a conservative, independent Flemish Nationalist direction, and the wing helmed by Bert Anciaux, who was looking to merge the Volksunie with its progressive programme with another political party, eventually resulted in the break-up of the VU. In a referendum for the general membership, the Bourgeois group, with just under 50% of the votes cast, came out victorious against the two other groups participating, headed up by Bert Anciaux and Johan Sauwens respectively. Since at least 50% of the votes had to be gained to earn the right to continue under the Volksunie name, Bourgeois and his supporters set up a new party in November 2001: the New Flemish Alliance (Nieuw-Vlaamse Alliantie N-VA). From 2001 until 2004, Bourgeois served as the first party chairman of the N-VA which engaged in fierce opposition against the ‚Äúpurple‚Äù coalition government. In his book entitled De puinhoop van Paars-groen (The Shambles of Purple-Green), he heaped scathing criticism on the Belgian government that had been in power from 1999 to 2002. In May 2003, Bourgeois was re-elected into the federal Chamber of Representatives as the only N-VA candidate; he held his seat until 2004. In the third direct Flemish elections held on 13 June 2004, he was elected in the electoral constituency of West Flanders. He remained a Member of the Flemish Parliament for over one month until he joined the Government of Flanders on 22 July 2004; he was succeeded as Member of the Flemish Parliament by Jan Loones. He was succeeded as N-VA party chairman by Bart De Wever when he took up office in July 2004 as Flemish Minister for Public Governance, Foreign Policy, Media and Tourism in the Leterme I Government. On 22 September 2008, he tendered his resignation as a serving Minister in the Government of Flanders, in the wake of which the cartel with the CD&V; \\\\- of which Bourgeois has been one of the architects - was ended.[9] Bourgeois subsequently resumed his seat as Member of the Flemish Parliament until June 2009. From the very outset, he went into opposition mode against the government he had just left. This was contrary to the tradition that former Ministers should remain absent for a while after they have stood down.[10] In the Flemish elections of 7 June 2009, Geert Bourgeois was again directly elected in the electoral constituency of West Flanders. One month later, on 13 July 2009, Bourgeois was appointed Vice-Minister‚ÄìPresident and Minister in the Peeters II Government. He was in charge of Public Governance, Local and Provincial Government, Civic Integration, Tourism and the Vlaamse Rand. By decision of the Government of Flanders of 24 July 2009, he was also assigned the competence 'Immovable Heritage'. He passed on his tenure as a Member of the Flemish Parliament to Wilfried Vandaele. In June 2010, he ran in the federal elections as the leading candidate for the province of West Flanders. He was elected as a Member of Parliament. However, in order to be sworn in as a Member of Parliament, he had to temporarily step down as a Flemish Minister. This occurred on 5 July 2010. Two days later, he was re- appointed Minister and resigned from the Chamber of Representatives. In the wake of the Flemish elections of 25 May 2014, he was sworn in as a Member of the Flemish Parliament at the inaugural meeting of the Flemish Parliament on 17 June 2014. On 25 July 2014, he was sworn in as the Minister-President of the Government of Flanders. His seat as a Member of the Flemish Parliament was taken by his successor Bert Maertens. On 2 December 2015, a formal tribute was paid to Geert Bourgeois in the Flemish Parliament‚Äôs plenary assembly for having served 20 years as a Member of Parliament/Minister. In 2019, he will be running for the European elections. The Flemish elections are to be held on the same date, with Bart De Wever running for the office of Minister- President.[11] European Parliament He was elected as a Member of the European Parliament in 2019.

The battle was a victory for the Florentines, securing Florentine domination of central Italy. The battle is well known for its depiction in a failed attempt at a painting by Leonardo da Vinci, now known only by its preparatory sketches. It is also remarkable for the fact that though the battle lasted all day, involving several thousand troops, it was said that only one soldier was killed. According to Niccol√≤ Machiavelli after four hours of skirmishing the single death occurred \\"when a soldier fell off his horse\\".  Battle  The League's army concentrated on Anghiari, a small centre of Tuscany, and comprised: 4,000 Papal troops, under Cardinal Ludovico Trevisan; a Florentine contingent of around the same size, and a company of 300 men-at-arms (knights) from Venice, led by Micheletto Attendolo. Other men joined for the occasion from Anghiari itself. The numerically superior Milanese force was led by the famous condottiero Niccol√≤ Piccinino in the name of Duke Filippo Maria Visconti and reached the area on the night of 28 June. Some 2,000 men from the nearby town of Sansepolcro joined the Milanese. Confident in his superior manpower, and on the element of surprise Piccinino ordered an attack in the afternoon of the following day. However, the dust lifted by the Milanese on the Sansepolcro-Anghiari road was noticed by Micheletto and the League's forces were made ready for battle. Micheletto's Venetian knights blocked the Milanese vanguard on the only bridge over the channel protecting the League's camp. Micheletto and the Venetians held the bridge allowing the greater part of the League's army to form for battle but were eventually pushed back by Milanese reinforcements led by the two captains Francesco Piccinino and Astorre II Manfredi. The Milanese advanced but their right flank was soon ferociously engaged by the Papal troops and were obliged to retreat to the bridge. The battle continued for four hours, until a surrounding manoeuvre managed to cut off a third of the Milanese on the League side of the channel. The battle continued into the night but ended with a victory for the League army.Pia F. Cuneo, Artful Armies, Beautiful Battles: Art and Warfare in Early Modern Europe, Brill, Boston, 2002, p.18.  Casualties  Plaque in memory of the battle of Anghiari The battle was described in histories written by contemporaries Leonardo Bruni and Flavio Biondo, both of whom concentrate on the actions of individuals, though there is some discussion of equipment and tactics. Machiavelli, in contrast, gives a detailed account of the strategy and tactics used by both sides, but presents the battle as \\"a striking example of the wretched state of military discipline in those times\\", arguing that the mercenary knights who ran the armies of the day had no motive to fight for victory.Niccol√≤ Machiavelli, History of Florence and of the Affairs of Italy: From the Earliest Times to the Death of Lorenzo the Magnificent, Walter Dunne: 1901. p.253 Machiavelli adds that \\"This victory was much more advantageous to the Florentines than injurious to the duke; for, had they been conquered, Tuscany would have been his own; but he, by his defeat, only lost the horses and accoutrements of his army, which could be replaced without any very serious expense\\". Whether or not the claimed single death is an exaggeration is not known. Hans Delbr√ºck argues that, Delbr√ºck says that \\"close examination of the contemporary reports has shown that there is not a true word in this entire description\\". However, it is true that the warfare of the period was far less brutal than that of the later period in which Machiavelli wrote, as knights could indeed expect to surrender for ransom.Hans Delbr√ºck (trans. Walter J. Renfroe Jr.), History of the Art of War: Within the Framework of Political History. Volume: 4.: Greenwood Press: Westport, CT.: 1985, p.17 While it is possible that only one mounted knight died at Anghiari, foot-soldiers are unlikely to have been as lucky. Frances S. Saunders says that \\"as many as 900\\" soldiers may in fact have died in the battle.  Cultural depictions  A study drawing by Leonardo for The Battle of Anghiari According to Pia F. Cuneo, \\"Anghiari is one of the most frequently represented battles of the era\\". The earliest known image, painted within a decade of the battle is a cassone panel by an unknown artist known as the Anghiari Master, which emphasises the tournament-like nature of the conflict, with banners and ritual engagements. More than seven decades later, the battle was the subject of a now-lost painting by Leonardo da Vinci, known through copies of the central scene made by other artists. The known portion of the painting depicted a battle over a standard between knights on opposing sides. The picture was commissioned to occupy one of the walls of the council chamber of the Florentine republic in the Palazzo Vecchio. The other wall was to have a painting by Michelangelo depicting an earlier Florentine victory at the Battle of Cascina in 1364. A 1687 relief sculpture depicting the battle by Baroque artist Giovanni Battista Foggini in Santa Maria del Carmine, Florence depicts Saint Andrew Corsini guiding the Florentine forces to victory.

It was (and in Croatia still is) the leader of the administrative unit ≈æupa (or zhupa, ≈æupanija). The term in turn was adopted by the Hungarians as isp√°n and spread further. Origin of the title The exact origin of the title is not definitively known and there have been several hypotheses: Slavic (Franz Miklosich), Turkic-Avarian (A. Bruckner), Iranian (F. Altheim), Proto Indo- European (V. Machek), Indo-European (D. Dragojeviƒá), Illyrian-Thracian (K. O≈°tir), Old-Balkan (M. Budimir), among others. The title was preserved primarily among the Slavic peoples and their neighbours who were under their influence. Its presence among Pannonian Avars and Avar language is completely undetermined. The title origin is not necessarily related to the origin of the titleholder. In 2009, A. Alemany considered that the title *ƒçu(b)-pƒÅn, often in a northeastern Iranian milleu, had an Eastern and Central Asian derivation, ƒçupan, and a Western and European derivation, ≈æupan. The Eastern ƒçupan first occurs, but allegedly as is usually connected with ƒçupan, in a Bactrian contract dated to 588 AD, where are mentioned two \\"headman\\" (œÉœâœÄŒ±ŒΩŒø, \\"sopano\\"); among the Western Turks (582‚Äì657), the leader of the fifth Shunishi Duolu tribe was a chuban chuo (ƒçupan ƒçor), while the leader of the fifth Geshu Nushibi tribe was chuban sijin (ƒçupan irkin), with chuo and sijin being the standard title of the each tribe's leader, inferior to qayan (khagan), but superior to b√§g. However, there is no mention of ƒçupan in Old Turkic runic incsriptions; a Chinese document (c. 8th century) near Kucha mentions several persons (allegedly Tocharians) with patronymic Bai and title chuban; in the same century, in the Chinese documents of province Khotan are mentioned word chiban and alleged title of low rank chaupam; the first (Old) Turkic document recording the title ƒçupan is a Uyghur decree from Turpan dated c. 9th‚Äì11th century. According to the work Dƒ´wƒÅnu l-Luƒ°at al-Turk by the 11th century scholar Mahmud al-Kashgari, a ƒçupan is an assistant to a village headman. The first known mention of Western ≈æupan occurs in a charter of Kremsm√ºnster abbey, by Bavarian duke Tassilo III in 777 AD, in which the monastery was granted by a group of Slavs, headed by the chieftains Taliup and Sparuna, whose abode lied beneath the boundaries reported under oath by the iopan Physso; the zo(≈ç)apan of Buyla inscription on a buckled bowl of a heterogeneous and chronologically uncertain (7th or 8th century) Treasure of Nagyszentmikl√≥s; the supan in Lusatian and Latin language (7th century): the Œ∂ŒøœÖœÄŒ±ŒΩŒøœÇ (zoupanos) on a silver bowl found at Veliki Preslav, capital of First Bulgarian Empire (893‚Äì972), and zhupan in Greek stone inscriptions and Cyrillic alphabet (Codex Suprasliensis) ; the zuppanis in Latin charter of St. George's church at Putalj by Croatian duke Trpimir in 852 AD; the Slavic, generally considered of White Croats, title of king's deputy mentioned by Ibn Rusta in the 10th century, the s≈´t.ƒü or s≈´b.ƒü, of which corrupted text some transcribe as s≈´banƒü (probably Turkic s≈´ be·∏´); according to Constantine VII in his 10th century work De Administrando Imperio, Croats, Serbs and other Slavic nations of Dalmatia had the Œ∂ŒøœÖœÄŒ¨ŒΩŒøœÖœÇ (zoupanous), \\"Princes, as they say, these nations had none, but only ≈æupans, elders, as is the rule in the other Slavonic regions\\"; also the Croatian state was divided in 11 Œ∂ŒøœÖœÄŒ±ŒΩŒØŒ±œÇ (zoupanias) administrative regions, with additional three ruled by Œ≤ŒøŒ¨ŒΩŒøœÇ (boanos) or ŒºœÄŒ¨ŒΩŒøœÇ (b/mpanos) (Ban); and is individually mentioned Œ∂ŒøœÖœÄŒ±ŒΩŒøœÖ (zoupanou) Beloje of Travunia; later among Serbs it also temporary became a title for supreme leader Œ∂ŒøœÖœÄŒ±ŒΩŒøœÇ ŒºŒµŒ≥Œ±œÇ (zoupanos megas, Grand ≈Ωupan); in Czech sources supani (1187). Etymology In Polish, Czech, Slovak and Ukrainian allegedly from ≈æupan was shortened to pan, meaning \\"master, mister, sir\\". *Franz Altheim derived the title from Iranian etymon *fsu-pƒÅna- that evolved to ≈°uŒ≤ƒÅn in Parthian, ≈°upƒÅn and ≈°ubƒÅn in Persian; all these words meaning \\"shepherd\\". Gerhard Doerfer suggested possible Iranian origin for Mahmud al-Kashgari's ƒçupan linking it with New Persian ƒç≈çpan, a variant form of ≈°ubƒÅn, with usual change of ≈°- to ƒç-. Omeljan Pritsak in Iranian *fsu-pƒÅna saw \\"shepherd of (human) cattle\\" in Avar service, using the Slavic masses as cannon fodder. Some scholars derived it from alleged Old Iranian a≈°urpan/aszurpan, meaning \\"great lord, noblemen\\". It is considered that the title origin can be traced to the Slavic and Iranian cultural interrelation in the Eastern and Southeastern Europe in the first centuries AD. *Karl Brugmann derived the Common Slavic *≈æupan—ä from ≈æupa \\"district, small administrative region\\", < *geupƒÅ, comparing this word with Skt. gopƒÅ- (herdsman, guardian), derived from gopaya (to guard, protect), of gup-, or even go-pƒÅ (cow-herd), Avestan gufra- (deep, hidden), among others. Oleg Trubachyov derived it from *gupana (from gopaya, the guard of cattle). A Central Asian descent was claimed by Karl Heinrich Menges, who considered ≈æupan a slavicized form of Altaic ƒçupan (a loanword from Iranian), with modified meaning from \\"clan, community\\" to \\"district\\". According to research done by scholars Ambro≈ºy Bogucki, Bohumil Vykypƒïl and Georg Holzer, in 2007 Franjo Smiljaniƒá concluded that is excluded any Avar influence on the origin, yet within the Avar authority were preserved the remnants of Slavic tribal organization. *According to Alemany, the (Old) Turkic ƒçu(b) is most probably a Turkic loanword from Khotanese -c≈´ and Chinese zhou (perfecture), which was a Chinese territorial administration applied to Central Asian regions inhabited by Iranians, but it has even older meaning of small island; a township unit; a region, up to zhoumu (regional governor) from Han to Sui dynasty. Alemany pointed out that, as there were settlements of Central Asian Iranians at least in some of those zhou, the title ƒçupan as *ƒçu(b)-pƒÅn (protecting a ƒçu(b) or zhou), was an Iranian rendering (see marz-bƒÅn, \\"protecting the marches\\"), of the Chinese zhoumu. The suffix -pƒÅn (from Avestan and Old Persian pat, \\"protector\\"; pƒÅ-, \\"to protect, to care\\") is well documented in Manichean Parthian texts from Turpan, and lesser extent in Sogdian and Khotanese. He concluded that the title designs both regio and rector, and if ƒçupan was a loanword introduced by the Avars as some assumed, but there was already a common Slavic word ≈æupa, their association could explain the shift ƒç- > ≈æ- in ≈æupan. However, as the title among Avars is undetermined, on the basis of preserved toponyms which are etymologically related to the title ≈æupan, like ≈Ωupanovo kolo in Novgorod, Russia, and ≈Ωupany kolo in Ukraine, as well it was spread in Slavic languages which were not in contact with Avar language, the assumption it was of Avar origin is highly doubtful and dismissed by many scholars as it occurs in wider area than is the area where lived Slavs and Avars together. Usage of the title and division The title had a widespread distribution, and did not always had a concrete institutional definition. Slavic tribes were divided into fraternities, each including a certain number of families. The territory inhabited by a tribe was a ≈æupa, and its leader was the ≈æupan. The ≈æupans, once as kopan, of the First Bulgarian Empire are traditionally seen as Slavic chiefs, or leaders of a local tribe and district. The ≈æupan title was also used in Wallachia and Moldavia (in modern Romania) but only with the meaning \\"mister\\" and bearing no administrative connotations. Croatia As heads of the ≈æupanija, the most important role of the ≈æupans were their public authority function. They were the primates populi, nobile aristocracy from where the king (or duke) recruited the official servants. Those ≈æupans by origin most probably belonged to the tribal or noble family structure, in historiography known as the Twelve noble tribes of Croatia, which are mentioned in the Pacta conventa and Supetar Cartulary. In the Supetar Cartulary, and in Croatian redaction of Chronicle of the Priest of Duklja, they were called as nobile sapienciroes and starac (elderman), indicating that to the agreement with king Coloman went twelve \\"elders ≈æupan\\". According to the charter by Croatian duke Muncimir (892 AD) it can be identified various official functions; ≈æupans who work at the ducal palace (Budimiro zuppani palatii, Prisna maccererarii, Pruade zuppano cauallario, Zelestro zuppano camerario, Zestededo zuppano pincernario, Bolledrago zuppano carnicario, Budimiro zuppano comitisse, Augina zuppano armigeri), who are part of territorial organization (Zelllerico zuppano Cleoniae, Sibidrago zuppano Clesae), or are only noble by position (Petro zuppano, Pribritreco filius Petri zuppano). The ≈æupans were usually listed in historical documents only as witnesses, without mark of duty. The transition of 12th to the 13th century is characterized by terminological change of the title ≈æupan and the spreading beyond the tribal main territory. The older social rank of the ≈æupan (iupanus) in Latin documents was changed with the title comes. The Latin term comes in the 14th and 15th century Croatia was translated in two different ways, as ≈°pan and knez. The first signified the royal official in the ≈æupanija, while the second the hereditary lord of the ≈æupanija exempted from the direct royal rule. Thus the term lost its old tribal and got a new administrative meaning, while the old Croatian tribes (genus) under the title of knez preserved the inheritance rights over the lands of ≈æupanija. Hungary There were several \\"isp√°n\\"'s in the royal court of Hungarian Kingdom: 'n√°dorisp√°n' (palatine), 'udvarisp√°n' (court isp√°n), 'k√°polna isp√°n' (chapel isp√°n), and 'isp√°n's of the financial hierarchy ('harmincadisp√°n', 'p√©nzver≈ëisp√°n', 's√≥kamaraisp√°n', 'urburaisp√°n'). Similarly the leaders of the ethnic groups were called 'isp√°n' like 'beseny≈ëk isp√°nja' (Besermian isp√°n) 'sz√©kelyisp√°n' (Szekler isp√°n). Serbia According to Fine, the governorship was hereditary, and the ≈æupan reported to the Serbian prince, whom they were obliged to aid in war. The earlier ≈æupan title was abolished and replaced with the Greek-derived kefalija (kephale, \\"head, master\\").p. 290 Slovakia The title ≈æupan is widely used as an informal name for presidents of self- governing regions (≈æupa) in Slovakia. Slovenia In Slovenia, ≈æupan is the official title of the mayor of the 212 municipalities. In the Slovene-speaking municipalities in Italy, the term ≈æupanstvo is used for the municipal administration (similar to the Spanish ayuntamiento), while in Slovenia, this usage is obsolete. Before the 19th century, ≈æupan was used as a name for the village elder. With the introduction of modern municipal administration in the Austrian Empire in 1849, it became the official Slovene title for mayors. The Slovene name for parishes, ≈æupnija, has the same etymology. The parish priest is called ≈æupnik. The name ≈æupanija is used to refer to the counties of Hungary (the term has been historically used by the Prekmurje Slovenes, who were part of the Kingdom of Hungary from the 10th century until 1918).

On 19 December 2008, Risteska held her first solo concert in Skopje. It was staged at the Metropolis Arena and featured guests such as Lambe Alabakovski, Tuna, Parketi, and Regina. In 2009, she released a video for her song \\"Usni Kako Temno Mastilo\\". The same as her previous videos director was again Aleksandar Ristovski - Princ. On November 3, 2009 Elena released her single \\"Dosta\\" which is the first single from Elena's fourth studio album.On March 14, 2010 Elena released her second single of her fourth studio album named \\"Sakam Po Dobro Da Te Pamtam\\". Later that year, Elena released her single \\"Srekna Nov Godina\\" (Happy New Year). 2010 was the year of the fourth M2 Search For A Star which was the show that Elena was discovered in, but this time Elena had the role of a judge along with Ivo Jankoski, Darko Dimitrov & Vesna Petrusevska.The following year Elena was chosen as \\"Best Song in the Balkans from North Macedonia for 2010\\" with her hit single \\"Sakam Po Dobro Da Te Pamtam\\"(I want to remember you for good).On the 24.06.2011 Elena & Lambe Alabakovski released their second duet titled \\"Najdobro Do Sega\\" (The Best Til Now), a music video was later recorded for the song which had already become a summer hit single. Later that year in August, Risteska held a special concert in Ohrid, North Macedonia, she performed many traditional Macedonian songs and some of her past hits but with a traditional arrangement. In September 2012, she announced that her new single will called \\"Opasni Vreminja\\". It was released in October with new video. She shot her new video in many different places such as Ohrid and other cities in North Macedonia. In late 2014, she was a contestant of the second season of the Serbian version of Your Face Sounds Familiar. She imitated artists such as Nina Badric, Severina, Jennifer Lopez, and Esma Redzepova. She won only in the fifth week, as Jennifer Lopez singing \\"Booty\\", but she was chosen by the public to participate in the finals. She placed as the runner-up in the finals as Beyonc√©, singing \\"End of Time\\". Artistry=Influences Risteska is best known for her distinct mezzo-soprano vocal range and stage presence. Throughout her career, Risteska has drawn frequent comparisons to Beyonce and Christina Aguilera. In terms of vocals, choreography and stage presence, she has been citing both as influences in her work. She has also covered Beyonce's song Halo in 2010. She stated in an interview that in her earliest youth, Celine Dion and Whitney Houston were her main influences, but as she grew she found more inspiration in Beyonce Knowles and Christina Aguilera. In 2010, Risteska also covered \\"Hit The Road Jack\\" with Lambe Alabakovski. Discography=Albums * Den i Nok (2003) * 192 (2006) * Milioner (2008) * The Very Best of ...

It tells the story of a cybernetic anti-heroine, Katrina Cupertino, who carries the consciousness of Yamiko Gamorra. Publication history Cybernary began as a backup story to Jim Lee's run on Deathblow,Deathblow #1, 1993 but Manabat's work on the series was cut short with his untimely demise due to a longtime illness. Gerber continued the storyline through a 1995 mini-series with art by Jeff Rebner and Richard Friend. On this post-Manabat series, Gerber remarked, \\"The artist, unfortunately, had no feel for the kind of cyber-civilization we were trying to portray. I admit, I lost interest a couple of issues into the series.\\" https://groups.yahoo.com/group/howard_the_duck/message/2106 (for members only) A second Cybernary, based on Yamiko Gamorra herself, was created in a short story written by Tommy Yune for the Wildstorm Thunderbook that overlapped with some of the events of The Authority. The story was continued by Joe Harris for a six-part Cybernary 2.0 limited series that started in 2001. Fictional character biography Katrina's story takes place in the Wildstorm Universe on the fictional post-apocalyptic island of Gamorra. She is a member of the American colony. Her parents die in a suspicious accident and Katrina opts for a life on the street. With her 'street smarts' and low-level telepathy, she prospered in the criminal circles. She teams up with a male partner named Cisco. During one mission, there were mistakes and Vandalla, one of Gamorra's main scientists, ends up with custody of Cisco. Her rescue attempt seemingly works, but Cisco is not truly freed and Katrina herself is vastly altered. While her outside looks like a very carefully made nympho-droid, her insides are built for killing. Not only that, her mind also contains the consciousness of Kaizen Gamorra's lost daughter Yamiko. Intended as a present for Kaizen himself, she instead escapes and helps overthrow him. Cybernary spends some time dimension-hopping with Savant's unofficial super-hero team called Savant Garde. There she fought side by side with Savant herself, Mr. Majestic, the cat-girl Sheba, and many other heroes, some of whom resembled Cybernary herself. Cicsco becomes part of the team, but he is now the large cyborg known as Met-L. Also joining the team is the murderous mercenary Innuendo, who helps out the heroes despite his own dark nature. After the World's End event, the Yamiko-Cybernary is able to make her way to the now floating island of Gamorra, trying to enact vengeance over her long lost father. However Kaizen Gamorra convinces her to join forces, taking her place at his side as the heiress of the ruined world that Gamorra intends to rule. As her first mission, Cybernary is sent to capture the last free stronghold on Earth, the ruins of the former Carrier. After having subdued Hawksmoore and taken him to Gamorra to be tortured by her father, her prisoner eventually escaped into the city itself since being in the last urban environment on earth had healed and strengthened him. Just before they could commence battle after having intercepted him as he rampaged through Gamorra city, he quickly disappears from view only to be accosted by Engineer later who removes all of her cybernetics and possibly along with the secondary persona of Yamiko Gamorra leaving her as Katrina Cupertino again. Some time after an invasion by the Knights of Khera, Katrina somehow regained her cyborg additions, as noted by the antlers and outfit she sported as Cybernary. She served under Zannah as squad commander and combat instructor to the former's Coda somewhere deep within Zanzibar. She was on guard duty while a skulking Midnighter was prowling in the background. Although she took notice of him while training new coda recruits, she chose to continue the seminar instead of reporting him. She eventually called him out after finding the heart of their operation, stating Zealot wanted to see him.

Towards a practical programming language based on dependent type theory. PhD Thesis. Chalmers University of Technology, 2007. The original Agda system was developed at Chalmers by Catarina Coquand in 1999. The current version, originally known as Agda 2, is a full rewrite, which should be considered a new language that shares a name and tradition. Agda is also a proof assistant based on the propositions-as-types paradigm, but unlike Coq, has no separate tactics language, and proofs are written in a functional programming style. The language has ordinary programming constructs such as data types, pattern matching, records, let expressions and modules, and a Haskell-like syntax. The system has Emacs and Atom interfaces but can also be run in batch mode from the command line. Agda is based on Zhaohui Luo's unified theory of dependent types (UTT),Luo, Zhaohui. Computation and reasoning: a type theory for computer science. Oxford University Press, Inc., 1994. a type theory similar to Martin-L√∂f type theory. Agda is named after the Swedish song \\"H√∂nan Agda\\", written by Cornelis Vreeswijk, which is about a hen named Agda. This alludes to the naming of Coq.  Features = Inductive types  The main way of defining data types in Agda is via inductive data types which are similar to algebraic data types in non-dependently typed programming languages. Here is a definition of Peano numbers in Agda: data ‚Ñï : Set where zero : ‚Ñï suc : ‚Ñï ‚Üí ‚Ñï Basically, it means that there are two ways to construct a value of type ‚Ñï, representing a natural number. To begin, \`zero\` is a natural number, and if \`n\` is a natural number, then \`suc n\`, standing for the successor of \`n\`, is a natural number too. Here is a definition of the \\"less than or equal\\" relation between two natural numbers: data _‚â§_ : ‚Ñï ‚Üí ‚Ñï ‚Üí Set where z‚â§n : {n : ‚Ñï} ‚Üí zero ‚â§ n s‚â§s : {n m : ‚Ñï} ‚Üí n ‚â§ m ‚Üí suc n ‚â§ suc m The first constructor, \`z‚â§n\`, corresponds to the axiom that zero is less than or equal to any natural number. The second constructor, \`s‚â§s\`, corresponds to an inference rule, allowing to turn a proof of \`n ‚â§ m\` into a proof of \`suc n ‚â§ suc m\`. So the value \`s‚â§s {zero} {suc zero} (z‚â§n {suc zero})\` is a proof that one (the successor of zero), is less than or equal to two (the successor of one). The parameters provided in curly brackets may be omitted if they can be inferred.  Dependently typed pattern matching  In core type theory, induction and recursion principles are used to prove theorems about inductive types. In Agda, dependently typed pattern matching is used instead. For example, natural number addition can be defined like this: add zero n = n add (suc m) n = suc (add m n) This way of writing recursive functions/inductive proofs is more natural than applying raw induction principles. In Agda, dependently typed pattern matching is a primitive of the language; the core language lacks the induction/recursion principles that pattern matching translates to.  Metavariables  One of the distinctive features of Agda, when compared with other similar systems such as Coq, is heavy reliance on metavariables for program construction. For example, one can write functions like this in Agda: add : ‚Ñï ‚Üí ‚Ñï ‚Üí ‚Ñï add x y = ? \`?\` here is a metavariable. When interacting with the system in emacs mode, it will show the user expected type and allow them to refine the metavariable, i.e., to replace it with more detailed code. This feature allows incremental program construction in a way similar to tactics- based proof assistants such as Coq.  Proof automation  Programming in pure type theory involves a lot of tedious and repetitive proofs. Although Agda has no separate tactics language, it is possible to program useful tactics within Agda itself. Typically, this works by writing an Agda function that optionally returns a proof of some property of interest. A tactic is then constructed by running this function at type-checking time, for example using the following auxiliary definitions: data Maybe (A : Set) : Set where Just : A ‚Üí Maybe A Nothing : Maybe A data isJust {A : Set} : Maybe A ‚Üí Set where auto : ‚àÄ {x} ‚Üí isJust (Just x) Tactic : ‚àÄ {A : Set} (x : Maybe A) ‚Üí isJust x ‚Üí A Tactic Nothing () Tactic (Just x) auto = x Given a function \`check-even : (n : ‚Ñï) ‚Üí Maybe (Even n)\` that inputs a number and optionally returns a proof of its evenness, a tactic can then be constructed as follows: check-even-tactic : {n : ‚Ñï} ‚Üí isJust (check-even n) ‚Üí Even n check-even-tactic {n} = Tactic (check-even n) lemma0 : Even zero lemma0 = check-even-tactic auto lemma2 : Even (suc (suc zero)) lemma2 = check-even-tactic auto The actual proof of each lemma will be automatically constructed at type-checking time. If the tactic fails, type-checking will fail. Additionally, to write more complex tactics, Agda has support for automation via reflection. The reflection mechanism allows one to quote program fragments into ‚Äì or unquote them from ‚Äì the abstract syntax tree. The way reflection is used is similar to the way Template Haskell works.Van Der Walt, Paul, and Wouter Swierstra. \\"Engineering proof by reflection in Agda.\\" In Implementation and Application of Functional Languages, pp. 157-173. Springer Berlin Heidelberg, 2013. Another mechanism for proof automation is proof search action in emacs mode. It enumerates possible proof terms (limited to 5 seconds), and if one of the terms fits the specification, it will be put in the meta variable where the action is invoked. This action accepts hints, e.g., which theorems and from which modules can be used, whether the action can use pattern matching, etc.Kokke, Pepijn, and Wouter Swierstra. \\"Auto in Agda.\\"  Termination checking  Agda is a total language, i.e., each program in it must terminate and all possible patterns must be matched. Without this feature, the logic behind the language becomes inconsistent, and it becomes possible to prove arbitrary statements. For termination checking, Agda uses the approach of the Foetus termination checker.Abel, Andreas. \\"foetus ‚Äì Termination checker for simple functional programs.\\" Programming Lab Report 474 (1998).  Standard library  Agda has an extensive de facto standard library, which includes many useful definitions and theorems about basic data structures, such as natural numbers, lists, and vectors. The library is in beta, and is under active development.  Unicode  One of the more notable features of Agda is a heavy reliance on Unicode in program source code. The standard emacs mode uses shortcuts for input, such as \`\\\\Sigma\` for Œ£.  Backends  There are two compiler backends, MAlonzo for Haskell and one for JavaScript.

It is an ancient settlement that traces its roots to the settlement of Terebovl which existed in Kievan Rus. The name may also be variously transliterated as Terebovlya, Terebovla, or Terebovlja. The population census was 13,661; in 2012 there were 13,796 residents.–ß–∏—Å–µ–ª—å–Ω—ñ—Å—Ç—å –Ω–∞—è–≤–Ω–æ–≥–æ –Ω–∞—Å–µ–ª–µ–Ω–Ω—è –£–∫—Ä–∞—ó–Ω–∏ –Ω–∞ 1 —Å—ñ—á–Ω—è 2013 —Ä–æ–∫—É. –ö–∏—ó–≤: –î–µ—Ä–∂–∞–≤–Ω–∏–π –∫–æ–º—ñ—Ç–µ—Ç —Å—Ç–∞—Ç–∏—Å—Ç–∏–∫–∏ –£–∫—Ä–∞—ó–Ω–∏, 2013, s. 96. In 1913 the city counted 10,000 residents, of whom 4,000 were Poles, 3,200 were Rusyns (Ruthenians) and 2,800 were Jews. In 1929 there were 7,015 people, mostly Polish, Ukrainian and Jewish. Until September 17, 1939, the day of the Soviet invasion of Poland, Trembowla was a county seat within the Tarnopol Voivodeship of the Second Polish Republic. Prior to the Holocaust, the city was home to 1,486 Jews, and most of them (around 1,100) were shot by Germans in the nearby village of Plebanivka on April 7, 1943. History Terebovlia is one of the oldest cities in West Ukraine. It was first mentioned in the chronicles of 1097 (Primary Chronicle). During the Red Ruthenia times it used to be the center of Terebovlia principality. It was called Terebovl (). Terebovlia principality included lands of the whole southeast of Galicia, Podolia and Bukovyna. Polish King Casimir III the Great became the suzerain of Halych after the death of his cousin, Boleslaw-Yuri II of Galicia, when the city became part of the Polish domain. It was fully incorporated into Poland in 1430 during the reign of king W≈Çadys≈Çaw II Jagie≈Ç≈Ço, while his son Casimir IV Jagiellon granted the town limited Magdeburg Rights. After the rebuilding of the castle in Terebovlia in 1366, Poland (Podole Voivodeship) administered the town. It was part of the system of border fortifications of the Polish Kingdom and later the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth against Moldavian and Wallachian incursions. The town also later resisted frequent invasion by the Crimean Tatars, the Ottomans and the Zaporozhian Cossacks from the south and southeast. Because of the threat of invasion, the Terebovlya castle, monastery and churches were all designed as defensive structures. The town was the seat of the famous starost and the most successful 16th-century anti-Tatar Polish commander Bernard Pretwicz, who died there in 1563. In 1594, the Ukrainian cossack rebel Severyn Nalyvaiko sacked the town. Khmelnytsky Uprising During the Khmelnytsky Uprising, Terebovl became one of the centers of the struggle in Podolia. The city was frequently raided by Crimean Tatars, Turks and their erstwhile allies, the Zaporozhian Cossacks. The most destructive attacks happened in 1498, 1508, 1515 and 1516, resulting in a temporary decline of the town. In 1674, as preparations were undertaken for another war with the Turks who were then at war with Muscovy, the Diet decided to further strengthen Terebovlia and send garrisons there. The following year, the Janissary once again embarked on raids against towns and villages, and on 20 September 1675 destroyed the town, but the castle was held by a small group of defenders (80 soldiers and 200 townsmen) until King Jan III Sobieski arrived to relieve them. This episode is known as the Battle of Trembowla. The castle was destroyed during the final Turkish invasion of 1688.  Modern history  After the first partition of Poland in 1772, Trembowla became part of the Habsburg Empire's Galicia until 1918. From November 18, 1918, until June 9, 1919, the town was under control of the West Ukrainian People's Republic. Following the Polish‚ÄìUkrainian War, Trembowla reverted to Polish rule, and served as seat of a county in Tarnopol Voivodeship. In the interbellum period, the town was home to the 9th Regiment of Lesser Poland Uhlans. The Soviet Union took the city along with interwar eastern Poland in September 1939. The Soviets remained in power until the German invasion in June 1941. Later, the Soviet Union retook the town, and it became part of the Soviet Ukraine between 1944‚Äì1991. In the first month of the German occupation, Ukrainian police arrested, tortured, and shot forty Jews. In 1942 and 1943, Germans, assisted by Ukrainian police, rounded up thousands of Jews. They murdered thousands nearby, in mass executions. After the liberation, only fifty or sixty people from the entire Jewish community had survived. https://www.aish.com/ho/p/Personal-Accounts-During-the-Holocaust.html#10 During World War II, Trembowla and the surrounding areas also witnessed mass murders of ethnic Poles. After investigation of crimes done by Ukrainian nationalists and local Ukrainian peasantry, the Institute of National Remembrance of Poland confirmed the death at least 1002 persons in the territory of Tarnopol and Trembowla powiats (counties)Zako≈Ñczenie ≈õledztwa w sprawie zbrodni ukrai≈Ñskich nacjonalist√≥w, dokonanych na osobach narodowo≈õci polskiej na terenie powiat√≥w Tarnopol i Trembowla (woj. tarnopolskie) w latach 1939‚Äì1945 at the Institute of National Remembrance, 3 July 2017. As a result, and following the population exchange between Poland and Soviet Ukraine, almost all Polish survivors left the town in 1945, moving to the Recovered Territories of Poland. In 1991 Terebovlia became part of an independent Ukraine.  Sites of interest  The town has ruins of a castle which was built by King Kazimierz Wielki in the second half of the 14th century. In 1534, the castle was expanded by the Voivode of Krak√≥w, Andrzej Teczynski, and in 1631 it was once again expanded by the Castellan of Trembowla, Andrzej Balaban. In 1648, it was captured by the Cossacks. Other sites of interest are a Carmelite church and monastery complex, founded in 1617 by Piotr Ozga. It formerly housed the painting of Our Lady of Trembowla, which was moved to St. Catherine Church in Gda≈Ñsk after World War II. Communist authorities turned the complex into a factory, and later a house of culture. Currently, it is an Orthodox church.

Having received protected status in 2002, they are a popular tourist destination and are about 20 minutes taxi ride from the largely indigenous town of Otavalo. Mojanda is a complex of two volcanoes which were active simultaneously. The volcanic vents are only 3 km apart. The other volcano, which produced at least two Plinian Eruptions of its own, is known as Fuya Fuya. Fuya Fuya partially collapsed around 165,000 years ago, creating a large caldera to the west. A new volcanic cone and other lava domes subsequently extruded inside the caldera, probably during the Late Pleistocene. The high altitude grasslands and shrublands of Mojanda, which lie above the cloud forests, are collectively known as p√°ramo. They are frequently grazed by cattle.

In the case of T cells, two stimuli are required to fully activate their immune response. During the activation of lymphocytes, co-stimulation is often crucial to the development of an effective immune response. Co-stimulation is required in addition to the antigen-specific signal from their antigen receptors.  T Cell Co-stimulation  T cells require two signals to become fully activated. A first signal, which is antigen-specific, is provided through the T cell receptor (TCR) which interacts with peptide-MHC molecules on the membrane of antigen presenting cells (APC). A second signal, the co-stimulatory signal, is antigen nonspecific and is provided by the interaction between co-stimulatory molecules expressed on the membrane of APC and the T cell. One of the best characterized co-stimulatory molecules expressed by T cells is CD28, which interacts with CD80 (B7.1) and CD86 (B7.2) on the membrane of APC. Another costimulatory receptor expressed by T cells is ICOS ( Inducible Costimulator), which interacts with ICOS-L. T cell co-stimulation is necessary for T cell proliferation, differentiation and survival. Activation of T cells without co- stimulation may lead to T cell anergy, T cell deletion or the development of immune tolerance.  B Cell Co-stimulation  The latter case induces recognition by antigen-specific Th2 cells or Tfh cells, leading to activation of the B cell through binding of TCR to the MHC-antigen complex. It is followed by synthesis and presentation of CD40L (CD154) on the Th2 cell, which binds to CD40 on the B cell, thus the Th2 cell can co-stimulate the B cell.Janeway CA, Travers P, Walport M, Shlomchik M (2001). Immunobiology 5 : The Immune System in Health and Disease, 5th ed. New York: Garland Pub., Without this co-stimulation the B cell cannot proliferate further. Co- stimulation for B cells is provided alternatively by complement receptors. Microbes may activate the complement system directly and complement component C3b bind to microbes. After C3b is degraded into a fragment iC3b (inactive derivative of C3b), then cleaved to C3dg, and finally to C3d, which continue to bind to microbial surface, B cells express complement receptor CR2 (CD21) to bind to iC3b, C3dg, or C3d.Frank K, Atkinson JP (2001). \\"Complement system.\\" In Austen KF, Frank K, Atkinson JP, Cantor H. eds. Samter's Immunologic Diseases, 6th ed. Vol. 1, p. 281‚Äì298, Philadelphia: Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, This additional binding makes the B cells 100- to 10,000-fold more sensitive to antigen. CR2 on mature B cells forms a complex with CD19 and CD81. This complex is called the B cell coreceptor complex for such sensitivity enhancement to the antigen.Abbas AK, Lichtman AH (2003). Cellular and Molecular Immunology, 5th ed. Philadelphia: Saunders, . Applications Abatacept (Orencia) is a T cell co-stimulation modulator approved for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. The cytokines secreted by activated T cells are thought to both initiate and propagate the immunologically driven inflammation associated with rheumatoid arthritis. Orencia, a soluble fusion protein, works by altering the co-stimulatory signal required for full T-cell activation. Belatacept is another novel molecule which is being tested as an anti-rejection medication for use in renal transplantation. A new co-stimulatory superagonistic drug, TGN1412, was the subject of a clinical trial at Northwick Park Hospital, London. The trial became surrounded in controversy as the six volunteers became seriously ill within minutes of being given the drug. In essence, the co-stimulatory molecules function as \\"flashing red lights\\" that interact with the T cell, communicating that the material being presented by the dendritic cell material indicates danger. Dendritic cells displaying co-stimulatory molecules while presenting antigen are able to activate T cells. In contrast, T cells that recognize antigen presented by a dendritic cell not displaying co-stimulatory molecules are generally driven to apoptosis, or may become unresponsive to future encounters with the antigen.

The Chocolate Papers Darryl Vincent and the Flares was formed in Meridian, MS in 1956, and Cummings joined the group in 1959. In the 1960s, Cummings was a member of the Chocolate Papers, along with Ray Sawyer, Bill Francis, Bobby Dominguez, Popeye Phillips, and Jimmy \\"Wolf Cub\\" Allen. The Chocolate Papers toured clubs in Mississippi, Alabama, and South Carolina, before settling in Biloxi as the house band at the popular 800-seat Gus Stevens Restaurant, the first Gulf Coast supper club to offer upscale entertainment with such headliners as Elvis Presley, Andy Griffith, Mel Torm√©, Jayne Mansfield, and Mamie Van Doren. The Chocolate Papers moved to Chicago, but Cummings soon decided to form his own band in the New York area. Dr. Hook & the Medicine Show Cummings found fame with Dr. Hook & the Medicine Show, the group he named and founded in Union City, New Jersey in 1968. He invited former Chocolate Papers bandmates Ray Sawyer, Billy Francis, and Popeye Phillips to join his new band (Phillips left to join The Flying Burrito Brothers before the band achieved success, and Francis rejoined Cummings shortly after Locorriere joined.) Cummings brought the nineteen-year-old Dennis Locorriere into the band as a bass player. While playing the Bandbox club in Union City, the owner asked George what the name of his band was, and on the spur of the moment, he wrote down \\"Dr. Hook & the Medicine Show, Straight from the South, serving up Soul Music\\". They recorded their debut album for CBS/Columbia in 1970, and sold a million copies of their single, \\"Sylvia's Mother,\\" when it was re-released in July, 1972. The group was caricatured on the cover of Rolling Stone. Cummings sang the bass-register lead vocal on the second verse of \\"The Cover of the Rolling Stone\\", as well as playing the comical lead guitar on the instrumental break in concerts (Locorriere actually played it on the recording). He also sang \\"Makin' It Natural\\", \\"Penicillin Penny\\" (both written by Shel Silverstein), and \\"I Got Stoned and I Missed It\\" (co-written by Cummings with Silverstein). Collaborations In 1978, at the Muscle Shoals Sound Studio, he collaborated with the legendary Delta bluesman Big Joe Williams on one of the singer's last albums, The Final Years: Big Joe Williams. Co-produced by Cummings, Joe B. Stewart, and Ken Hatley, this album was released in 1993 by Gitanes Jazz/Verve. In 2003, Cummings worked with Ken Hatley on the soundtrack for Florida City, a film drama about advance knowledge of the Pearl Harbor attack. In the spring of 2004, the Flares were reborn in Lebanon, Tennessee when Cummings joined original members Jim Pasquale (guitar) and Norman \\"Knobby\\" Lowell (drums), along with Nashville singer-songwriters Scotty Cothran, Harold Hutchcraft, Jack Bond, and Forest Borders, to cut the comeback album, It Is What It Is. In September 2005, Cummings began recording a solo CD, working with Pasquale and Hutchcraft.

She made her UK debut in 2001 at the Guildford Festival and since then has undertaken two British tours.  Early life  Addys was born in 1973 in Moa, a city in the east of Holgu√≠n Province. At the age of 10, she had learnt a vast repertoire ‚Äì from Cuban songs to boleros, Mexican rancheras to American pop-songs. At the age of 15, Addys started performing with her first professional band Timbre Latino. Shortly thereafter, she was asked by the nationally successful band \\"Los Neiras\\" to join them. At the age of 18, Addys became part of a newly founded band with a daily gig in the tourist area Guardalavaca. During the periodo especial, when food was difficult to obtain, this was the gig every musician was dreaming of. She had a room in the hotel and was fully catered. With the fee and tips she made, she was able to support her family. In 1993, Addys was invited to Germany and quickly learned German. She founded her first trio and began writing her own songs. She regularly visited her family in Cuba but also absorbed the new influences of her new home. Musical career In 1999, she moved to D√ºsseldorf and was signed by the label Media Luna. She began the production of her debut album which was mainly recorded in Havana with musician friends from her hometown. Ra√∫l Planas was a special guest on the recording. Mundo Nuevo was released in 2001 by the label Media Luna (Warner) and became a huge success in European media. In 2003, Addys released her second album, Nomad (Media Luna / Sony), recorded in Germany and Barcelona and mixed her Cuban roots with electronic elements. She performed in many concerts and toured in 16 European countries, sharing stages with artists like Eric Clapton, Bob Geldof, Mike Rutherford, Gary Brooker, Ringo Starr, Juan Luis Guerra, Compay Segundo and Tito Nieves. Singles and video clips were made for her songs Mundo Nuevo, Gitana Loca and Esa Voz. In addition to the albums produced by Cae Davis, her label Media Luna released several remixes from DJs Andry Nalin (Afro D'Mercedes), Ramon Zenker (Cha Ka Cha), Tony Brown (Mundo Nuevo), Guido Craveiro (Cry It Out) and 4tune Twins (Oye Colombia) From 2005 to 2011, Addys lived in Germany and the Canarian island of Tenerife. In Spain she frequently appeared on TV and performed on national TV-stations like Antena3, Tele5, MTV and other local stations. Since 2011, Addys has been living in Essen, Germany. That May, her new single Sabado Roto was released. Produced by Cae Davis and Pomez di Lorenzo (Sasha, Dick Brave), Sabado Roto is the first single out of the third album Addys released in 2012. Different from her last Album Nomad, electronic elements completely disappeared. Accompanied by mandolins, ukuleles and a Cuban tres, Addys sings of a rainy Saturday in summer, a Sabado Roto (broken Saturday). In addition to shows with her band, Addys started a Trio with Pomez di Lorenzo (guitar) and Cae Davis (bass) under the name En Casa de Addys. In it, Addys provides vocals and also plays guitar, cajon and Cuban percussion instruments such as maracas, guiro and claves. During her 2-month spring tour in 2012 she was accompanied by her daughter Lia on violin, who was a junior student at Folkwang University.

It was formed in 1983 to oppose the conscription of all white South African men into military service in the South African Defence Force.  Apartheid government's policy on military conscription  The apartheid government had a policy of compulsory conscription for young white men who were expected to perform military service at regular intervals, starting with an extended training which began in the year immediately following the one in which they left school or as soon as they turned 16, whichever came last. Many were granted deferment, for example to attend University and complete an undergraduate degree first, but very few young men were exempted from conscription for any reason other than being medically unfit or for a race classification error. Valid reasons included conscientious objection based on religious beliefs, but these exceptions were tightened in 1974. Increasingly stringent laws were passed increasing periods of service, broadening the base of eligible white men who could be called up, and providing stringent sentences for those men who objected. Conscripts comprised a significant part of the South African Defence Force.  Formation  The End Conscription Campaign (ECC) was formed in 1983, in protest against compulsory military service. It mobilised support for its campaigns, proposed service alternatives, supported conscientious objectors and provided a forum for the public with information and education on conscription and the alternatives. The ECC was founded in response to a resolution passed by Black Sash at their annual conference, which condemned South Africa's occupation of Namibia and charged the South African Defence Force with fighting a civil war. Conscientious objection was a serious choice as the consequences were severe. The reasons for conscientious objection included political, ethical and religious reasons. Some religious organisations, parent groups and student organisations such as the National Union of South African Students also engaged in anti-conscription activities. At its peak, conscription in South Africa consisted of two years of mandatory military service, followed by camps at intervals. Under apartheid, the call-up applied to all white men after completing their schooling or further studies.  Objections to war and participation  Objections to military service were generally based on the role of the military and security forces in enforcing the policy of apartheid, as well as opposition to ongoing South African military commitments in South West Africa (Namibia) and Angola. Those who refused military service were subject to contempt from the minority white community, and left with the choice of either going underground (internal exile) fleeing the republic (external exile) or imprisonment of up to double the length of the allotted military service. Many conscripts simply went absent without leave, failed to report, or got lost in the system. The End Conscription Campaign, one of many anti-war movements alongside Congress of South African War Resistors mobilised against the draft, promoted alternatives to military service, provided information about the situation in the townships and support to those brave enough to speak out against the war, as conscientious objectors.  Troops out of the townships  In 1985, the ECC held the \\"Troops out of the Townships\\" rally and were overwhelmingly successful in demonstrating the growing dissatisfaction within the white community, with the government of the day The rally was preceded by a three-week fast by objectors Ivan Toms, Harold Winkler and Richard Steele. It was announced in parliament that 7 589 conscripts failed to report for National Service in January 1985, as opposed to only 1 596 in the whole of 1984. As there were two intakes annually, in January and July, this would suggest a tenfold increase in non-reportees over the previous year. An estimated additional 7 000 \\"draft-dodgers\\" were also said to be living in Europe in 1985. This campaign received as significant boost when at 1983 Durban Conference the National PFP Youth, its Western Cape Chairperson Stephen Drus (Stephen Darori) endorsed the ECC and proposed a motion calling for Alternative to Conscription. The motion was passed unanimously. He proposed the same motion at the Annual Conference of the PFP in Cape Town a few months later which passed with little opposition. Following intense backroom negotiations between Harry Schwarz and Philip Myburg, the Defense Spokesmen of the PFP, the Nationalist Government passed an amendment that introduced a four-year Alternative to Conscription. 1452 people opted for the Alternative to Conscription between 1984 and the cancelling of Conscription in South Africa in 1993. January 1985 and July 1985 were the first so-called \\"immigrant intakes\\" after the involuntary nationalisation of white immigrant men (all foreign nationals (men and women) who had been resident in South Africa for an extended period) of a predetermined age group in November 1984. The high number of non-reportees was due to many of these immigrants opting to return to their countries of origin rather than do military service, since this opportunity was easily available to them because of their dual citizenship.  Group of 23 refuse military call-up  In 1987, a group of 23 conscientious objectors from the Universities of Cape Town and Stellenbosch, including Cameron Dugmore, then University of Cape Town Students Representative Council Chairperson and Jonathan Handler, South African Union of Jewish Students chairperson, refused to do military service in the South African Defense Force. Handlers' objection was based upon the notion of an \\"Unjust War\\" as opposed to the Pacifist position held by many Christian students.  ECC banishment  The organisation was banned in August 1988 under emergency regulations. In a press statement Adriaan Vlok, then Minister of Law and Order said: \\"The changes posed by the activities of the End Conscription Campaign to the safety of the public, the maintenance of public order and the termination of the State of Emergency, leave no other choice than to act against the ECC and to prohibit the organisation from continuing any activities or acts.\\" The same month, an issue of an alternative newspaper, the Weekly Mail, was confiscated by security police, \\"on the grounds that it had covered, and therefore promoted, opposition to conscription.\\" News coverage included a cartoon, an advertisement from War Resisters International, and \\"a report on 143 men who stated they would never serve in the South African Defence Force.\\" As a result of the banning of the ECC and confiscation of the Weekly Mail, protests at the University of Cape Town and other campuses were held. According to Grassroots, a crowd of 3000 university students marched on campus after a meeting condemning the banning.Grassroots, August 1988 The paper said, \\"government fears losing control of white youth. This is the message sent by the banning of the ECC under emergency regulations...the ECC pointed out that there is a civil war in our country, and that the South African Defence Force is being used against fellow South Africans... ECC's growing influence, led PW Botha and Magnus Malan to close it down. They fear that the message of the ECC will undermine apartheid's defence force.\\"Grassroots, August 1988 After the End Conscription Campaign was banned, hundreds of white South African war resisters refused the call-up, and conscription into the War in Angola and Civil War raging in South Africa's Black Townships continued. Some dodged the draft, others fled the country, some stood-up and faced the consequences for what they believed. None were ever given recognition by either the South African government or the newly elected democracy.  Shortening of conscription  In 1989, conscription was reduced from two years to one year, and during the negotiations to end apartheid from 1990 to 1994, it was less rigorously enforced. A Kairos campaign against conscription was the 1989 Campaign focussing on the End Conscription Campaign with participation of Alistair Teeling Smith, Rob Watson and Mandy Tailor. Saul Batzofin, 27, a member of the End Conscription Campaign, was sentenced to 18 months' imprisonment in 1989 for refusing to serve in the South African Defence Force. After he had completed his sentence he later told the Truth and Reconciliation Commission that he wanted to apply for amnesty to clear his criminal record. Although he was proud to have been a conscientious objector, the record caused difficulties with visa applications for foreign countries. During September 1989, thirty Stellenbosch conscientious objectors joined more than 700 listed COs nationwide by publicly refusing to do military service. The National Registry of Conscientious Objectors was also launched.Argus, Thursday 21, September 1989  End of conscription  On 24 August 1993 Minister of Defence Kobie Coetsee announced the end of conscription. In 1994 there would be no more call-ups for the one- year initial training. But although conscription was suspended it was not entirely abandoned. Indeed, in January 1994 for the first time there was no call-up for initial training, but at the same time conscripts who had already undergone training could be subject to \\"camp\\" call-ups, as they were technically subject to military law rather than civilian law. Actually \\"camp\\" call-ups reached record proportions over the period of the April 1994 elections, and for the first time in history the ECC called on conscripts to consider these call-ups to be different from previous call-ups. * (However, as of 2015: An alliance led by the African National Congress has reportedly begun pushing for the return of military conscription to the country, in a bid to contain youth unemployment and also instill discipline, patriotism and volunteerism into young people from the ages of 18. African National Congress secretary general Gwede Mantashe has stated he would support the reintroduction of conscription, saying the country moved away from the system ‚Äútoo soon‚Äù. Although reintroducing conscription may go against the spirit of the Constitution, Mantashe said ‚Äúthe country must do what it needs to do for the country to work‚Äù. The draft plan still needs to be approved, but if so, young South Africans may be forced to attend a compulsory military programme as soon as 2016.)  Conscription moratorium  Until the August 1994 moratorium on prosecutions for not responding to call-ups, several of those who did not respond to \\"camp\\" call-ups were fined. After the first multi- racial election in 1994, conscription has no longer applied in South Africa and the civilian draft has been exchanged for a professional standing army. However, conscripts who failed to report for duty, still faced prosecution under South Africa's Defence Act. An amendment to the act promulgated in 2002 allows for absentee members of the SANDF to be regarded as discharged from official duty.  Absent without leave  3 Section 59(3) of the Defence Act determines that: A member of the Regular Force absent from official duty without permission of their commanding officer for more than thirty days is regarded as having been dismissed if an officer, or discharged if of other rank, for misconduct with effect from the day immediately following the day of attendance to duty or last day of official leave, but the Chief of the Defence Force may, with good cause, authorise reinstatement of such conditions as they determine. According to a Department of Defence bulletin, dated 10 July 2003, \\"In essence, this means that if a member has absented himself or herself for a continuous period of thirty days, he or she is automatically discharged from the SANDF. It is therefore no longer necessary to approach the Minister of Defence for such a dismissal or discharge, as the individual will effect their own discharge if absent thirty days without permission. Should a member wish to be reinstated in the SANDF, he or she should approach the Chief of the SANDF with sound reasons why he or she was absent without permission.\\"Department of Defence Bulletin, 10 July 2003: No 43/03  Forces Favourites and musicians against conscription  In 1986, Shifty Records released Forces Favourites in conjunction with the ECC. Named after a radio programme for sending greetings to the troops fighting in the South African Border War. The ironically titled Forces Favourites compilation features some of the strongest political songs of the time. # \\"Pambere\\" - Mapantsula # \\"National Madness\\" - Aeroplanes # \\"Potential Mutiny\\" - Stan James # \\"Numbered Again\\" - The Facts # \\"Shot Down In The Streets\\" - Cherry Faced Lurchers # \\"Don't Dance\\" - Kalahari Surfers # \\"Whitey\\" - The Softies # \\"Don't Believe\\" - In Simple English # \\"Too Much Resistance\\" - Nude Red # \\"Spaces Tell Stories\\" - Roger Lucey # \\"Suburban Hum\\" - Jennifer Ferguson  Counter-operations against the ECC  Many ECC members were subject to persecution. During 1986, 98 members were detained, and others subjected to systematic harassment and intimidation. Meetings, publications and activities of the organisation were banned. Disinformation, death threats, fire-bombings, assaults, break-ins, and anonymous counter-propaganda against the organisation was commonplace. Evidence in a Cape Town court in 1988 revealed that the South African Defence Force had been running a disinformation campaign against the ECC. Political and military figures adopted varying and sometimes contradictory methods and messages to try to contain the threat of conscientious objection. National Party politicians characterised ECC activists as naive, malevolent in intent, in league with 'communist revolutionaries' and also as sexually deviant (i.e. homosexual) and cowardly. However, there is evidence that sentencing magistrates and even state prosecutors came to admire objectors for their stand.  Psychiatric oppression and the ECC  In order to get out of forced conscription into the South African Defence Force, many conscripts allowed themselves to be labeled as mentally ill, sick, or incapable of carrying a weapon. The price was incarceration in one of South Africa's psychiatric facilities. Instances of psychiatric abuse of conscripts who refused national service have also been recorded.

A native of California, Adams was one of the dominant players in the 1980s, as she was ranked #1 or #2 every pro season between 1980 and 1991. Adams was attending Orange Coast College, and a middle distance track athlete, when she first tried racquetball at age 19. Shortly after beginning to play, she met Jim Carson, who became her coach and stayed with her throughout her career. Professional career In the first half of the 1980s, Adams had a fierce rivalry with Heather McKay that helped to establish the women's pro racquetball tour. Adams was the dominant women's professional racquetball player after McKay moved back to her native Australia in 1985, and was undefeated in the 1985-86 season. She finished as the #1 player on the women's pro tour at the end of six seasons during the 1980s. She was Player of the Year eight times (1982‚Äì88, 1990) and won the women's pro Nationals six times (1982, 1983, 1985‚Äì88). Personal Adams's relationship with Carson developed into a romantic one and they married in 1982, but that only lasted to 1986, yet they were able to continue working together as player and coach. Their relationship remained positive evidenced by Carson being in the wedding party for Adams's second marriage to Rich Clay in 1990. Adams had serious health concerns beginning in December 1987, which was when she began having symptoms of multiple sclerosis that eventually led to her retirement in 1991. After retiring, Adams was on the staff of America's Most Wanted Racquetball Camps, and co-authored an instructional racquetball book with Erwin Goldbloom. Honors Adams was inducted into the USA Racquetball Hall of Fame in 1997. She was later inducted into the World Racquetball Hall of Fame in 2017 for her dominance in outdoor sports. She is also in the Orange Coast College Alumni Hall of Fame.

Rava- Rus'ka; ; , Rave) is a city in Zhovkva Raion, Lviv Oblast of western Ukraine. It is a border town between Ukraine and Poland. The border checkpoint is situated west of the city, along the international autoroute Warsaw - Lviv. Its population is approximately .  History  Rawa-Ruska was founded in 1455 by the Polish prince W≈Çadys≈Çaw I of P≈Çock, Duke of Be≈Çz and Mazovia, who named the settlement after his regional seat, Rawa Mazowiecka located further west. Due to a convenient location along the merchant trail from Lublin to Lviv, the newly located town quickly developed. For centuries, Rawa was part of the Kingdom of Poland and the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. It remained in private hands of several consecutive szlachta families, such as the G≈Çogowski, Suchodolski, Rzeczycki and Bogusz. In 1622, the town received permission of the King of Poland to organize fairs. In 1672, a skirmish between Polish and Crimean Tatar forces took place here, in which Polish unit under Atanazy Miaczynski freed hundreds of captured peasants. In 1698, Rawa was the site of a meeting between Peter the Great and Augustus the Strong, which led to the Treaty of Preobrazhenskoye in 1699. From the first partition of Poland in 1772 until the end of World War I in 1918, the town was part of the Austrian Partition ruled first by the Austrian Empire and then by Austria-Hungary after the compromise of 1867. It was a seat of the Rawa Ruska district, one of the 78 Bezirkshauptmannschaften in Austrian Galicia province (Crown land) in 1900.Wilhelm Klein (1967), Die postalischen Abstempelungen auf den √∂sterreichischen Postwertzeichen-Ausgaben 1867, 1883 und 1890. In 1880, its population was 10,500, with 37% Jews, 35% Poles, 20% Germans and 7% Ukrainians. In 1857, Rawa received a rail connection with Jaros≈Çaw, and next year, the railroad reached Sokal. 20th century In the early 20th century, Rava-Ruska developed into a rail junction, with a connection to Lviv and Rejowiec, built in 1915. After the rebirth of Poland Rawa-Ruska became part of the Lw√≥w Voivodeship, and the seat of the Powiat Rawski county (area ). The line from to Rejowiec was of leading importance, as it connected the two main cities of Poland, Warsaw, and Lw√≥w. Due to the rail lines, Rawa prospered, and several businesses operated in the town. In 1924, a Belgian company opened here a factory of railroad ties. Furthermore, in the interbellum period Rawa was home to Main School of the Border Guard, which was moved there in 1928 from G√≥ra Kalwaria. The school had a department of training of guard dogs, also located in Rawa-Ruska. According to Polish census of 1921, the population of the town was approximately 9,000; with 42% Poles, 42% Jews and 14% Ukrainians. By 1938, the population increased to 12,000. =World War II and the Holocaust= On 14 September 1939, during the Invasion of Poland, Rawa-Ruska was captured by the Wehrmacht. The German troops left the town within days in accordance with the German-Soviet Frontier Treaty, and Rava-Ruska was occupied by the Soviet forces. A year and a half later, it was again recaptured by the Germans on the 28 June 1941 during the German invasion of the Soviet Union, Operation Barbarossa. The Ukrainian People's Militia was formed. The town was incorporated into the General Government territory. The Judenrat was established in July 1941. In March 1942 the nearby Belzec extermination camp began its killing operations, and at the end of the month the first transport of 1,000 Jews left Rawa Ruska for Belzec. Many Jewish residents were killed at Belzec in further deportations, usually organized by the Germans and sometimes assisted by the Ukrainian police. Approximately 5,000 Polish Jews from Rava-Ruska were shot during a liquidation Aktion between 7 and 11 December 1942. The last mass shootings of Jews occurred in June 1943, during which 300-400 Jews were killed in a forest outside the village. =After World War II= After World War II, the Polish community of Rava-Ruska was forced to abandon the town and move to the Recovered Territories. Nevertheless, Rava-Ruska remains one of the key centres of the Polish minority in Ukraine, with the local office of the Association of Polish Culture of the Lviv Land operating here. Transportation It is located near the border with Poland, opposite the town of Hrebenne. Through the city passes the European route . At the border there is a \\"checkpoint Rava-Ruska\\". Rail station The city has a railroad station which also has a border and customs checkpoint. Since 2005 it has been used exclusively for freight transportation only and has two directions, one towards Hrebenne, another towards Werchrata.

Examples in English-speaking countries are the United States Congress and the Parliament of the United Kingdom.  History  The classical republics of Greece, Rome and Carthage included citizen assemblies (e.g. the Roman comitia). Popular assemblies (things) also emerged in pre-civilised Germanic and Scandinavian lands (and the modern assemblies in those countries are often named after the originals). However, all of these were direct rather than indirect expressions of democracy, since their members were the people themselves rather than representatives of the people. The idea of an assembly of representatives, a representative assembly, as a political institution of a literate society first appeared in Europe in the Middle Ages, more specifically in the twelfth to fifteenth centuries. Perhaps it was brought into being by rulers determined to avoid being overawed by their powerful warrior barons by appealing to lower ranks of society: lesser landowners, townsmen and clergy. Whatever the explanation for its emergence, it is considered by many to be the most important political innovation of the European Middle Ages. The idea appeared first in Spain, then in England, France and Italy, then spread to Germany and Scandinavia, even Poland and Hungary. Various names were used for these institutions: in England, Ireland, Scotland, Sicily, the Papal States and the Kingdom of Naples they were called parliaments or parlamenti; in the Iberian peninsula they were called cortes or corts; in France they were called estates-general and in the Low Countries the estates- or states-general; in Germany the term used was landtag; in Denmark and Norway it was rigsdag, in Sweden riksdag, and in Poland sejm. The number of chambers roughly corresponded to the organised orders or estates of mediaeval society: typically the church, the nobility, and the rest of society. Sometimes however (as in Spain and Portugal) the gentry or lesser nobility formed a separate order; sometimes (as in Sweden) the richer peasantry did likewise. The English parliament, which was to be an important example, was a deviant case in that only two orders were represented: the nobility and the rest. The representative assembly fell into disuse in many of the more important states of Europe in the seventeenth century. However, it survived in England, Sweden, Poland, Hungary and many of the German statelets, the southern ones particularly. In the eighteenth century, the English parliament was effectively transplanted to the United States, and in the nineteenth century it evolved there in an increasingly democratic direction. The American variant propagated in due course to Latin America, but meanwhile in Europe there was a general revival of the representative assembly based principally on the English model. France revived its Estates General in the wake of its revolution. Later, after the disintegration of the empire of Napoleon Bonaparte, assemblies re-emerged in Sweden, the Netherlands, France and Spain. The British Empire especially at the time of its dismantlement in the twentieth century was instrumental in spreading parliamentary democracy far and wide, and in modern times the immense international influence of the United States has encouraged the spread of representative democracy worldwide. Where forms of representative democracy have spread to countries that already had a tradition of assemblies, a merger of ideas has often taken place and the traditional name has tended to be used. Examples include majlis in certain Muslim countries, jirga in Afghanistan, duma in Russia. See list of national legislatures for more examples.  The first instance: the councils of Le√≥n and Galicia  In Galicia in 1113, Bishop Diego II of Santiago de Compostela ordered a monthly convening of councils in the regions of his bishopric ‚Äúas it was the custom of our ancestors‚Äù, bringing together churchmen, knights ('milites') and peasants to do justice, in what has been interpreted as a continuation of old Celtic or Suevi local traditions. Later, in 1188, King Ferdinand II of Le√≥n and Galicia called for a general council of his kingdoms to meet in the capital, Le√≥n, bringing together bishops, nobility and ‚Äì allegedly for the first time in European history ‚Äì representatives of the major cities and towns.  State of the art  In more modern times, the supremacy of the lower chamber became normal, so did the organisation of representatives into competing parties, so did election and an extended franchise, so did the idea that the ministers of the executive should be responsible to it.

F√©lix du Temple de la Croix (18 July 1823 - 3 November 1890) (usually simply called F√©lix du Temple) was a French naval officer and an inventor, born into an ancient Norman family. He developed some of the first flying machines and is credited with the first successful flight of a powered aircraft of any sort, a powered model plane, in 1857. and is sometimes credited with the first manned powered flight in history aboard his Monoplane in 1874.

Military life F√©lix du Temple as a young Naval officer. F√©lix du Temple entered the French Navy Academy (√âcole Navale) in 1838. He participated in most of the conflicts during the Second French Empire, especially the Crimean War, the French intervention in Italy against Austria, and the French intervention in Mexico. At the age of 41, he returned to France, became a captain (Capitaine de Fr√©gate), and joined the Loire Army (Arm√©e de la Loire). A partisan of the Comte de Chambord and a legitimist (an \\"Ultra-Royalist\\"), he was forced to quit the Navy in 1876.

He built several large models together with his brother Luis. One of them, weighing 700 grams, was able to fly, first using a clockwork mechanism as an engine, and then using a miniature steam engine. The two brothers managed to make the models take off under their own power, fly a short distance and land safely. As they tried to build a machine capable of carrying a man, they realized that steam engines lacked power and were too heavy. In 1867 they designed an original \\"hot air\\" engine, which did not prove satisfactory. They also experimented with the new internal combustion gas engine design developed by Lenoir, but this also lacked the necessary power. Felix du Temple de la Croix du Temple circa 1870. Du Temple continued his research and finally succeeded in creating a very compact high-speed circulation steam engine, for which he applied for a patent on 28 April 1876. The engine used very small pipes packed together \\"to obtain the highest possible contact surface for the smallest possible volume\\" The patent describes \\"une demande pour une chaudi√®re √† vapeur √† circulation rapide donnant la plus grande surface de chauffe possible sous le plus petit volume et le moindre poids.\\" : \\"When he began with the aid of his brother, M. Louis du Temple, to experiment on a large scale, the inadequacy of all motors then known became apparent. They first tried steam at very high pressures, then a hot-air engine, and finally built and patented, in 1876 a very light steam boiler weighing from 39 to 44 lb. to the horse power, which appears to have been the prototype of some of the light boilers which have since been constructed. It consisted in a series of very thin tubes less than 1/8 inches in internal diameter, through which water circulated very rapidly, and was flashed into steam by the surrounding flame.\\" Octave Chanute, Aeroplanes: Part III, August 1892 The \\"Monoplane\\" Monoplane. In 1874, the two brothers built the Monoplane, a large plane made of aluminium in Brest, France, with a wingspan of 13 meters and a weight of only 80 kilograms (without the pilot). Several trials were made with the plane, and it is generally recognized that it achieved lift off under its own power after a ski-jump run, glided for a short time and returned safely to the ground, possibly making it the first successful powered flight in history, depending on the definition ‚Äî since the flight was only a short distance and a short time. The plane was displayed at the 1878 World Fair (Exposition Universelle (1878)) in Paris.

During the war, the 55th Pursuit Group garnered two Distinguished Unit Citations. The group fostered 16 aces who were credited with 90 air-to-air victories. After the war, Strategic Air Command activated and redesignated the 55th Fighter Group as the 55th Reconnaissance group at MacDill Field, Florida, operating the RB-17. The newly activated group's mission consisted of aerial photography, mapping, charting, and photo reconnaissance missions, some of which flew around the globe. Activated after the end of the Cold War, the 55th Operations Group has maintained an unmatched operational tempo, supporting every US contingency worldwide.

The history of the Fightin‚Äô Fifty-Fifth began in January 1941, when the 55th Pursuit Group was activated at Hamilton Field, California. Training along the west coast, the group move to England, August- September 1943 and was assigned to VIII Fighter Command. The 55th FG began operations with Lockheed P-38H Lightnings on 15 October 1943, and was the first to use these aircraft on long-range escort missions from the UK. The P-38H differed from earlier versions in being powered by 1425 hp Allison V-1710-89/91 engines. The Lightnings' engines were troubled by the addition of alcohol used as an anti-knock compound in their fuel supply; a British war economy solution which caused problems with water condensation on the ground and fuel line icing at altitude. Another British attempt to correct fuel composition caused lead metal deposits to coat cylinders and foul plugs throughout the squadron. The -H series Lightnings did not have adequate cooling for extended high-power usage, as their engine development had outstripped the cooling capacity of the integral intercooler which ran through the wing's leading edge. Pilots were instructed to restrict their periods of highest engine power to defined time limits, but many did not. As a result of these various influences, the Group's Lightnings suffered a high rate of attrition. Nevertheless, 55FG P-38H pilots provided cover for missions against aircraft plants during Big Week in February 1944. Lt. Col. Jack Jenkins led the group on 3 March 1944, when they became the first Allied fighters to reach Berlin on an escort mission.Bodie, Warren M. The Lockheed P-38 Lightning: The Definitive Story of Lockheed's P-38 Fighter. On 16 April 1944 the group moved to RAF Wormingford to accommodate the arrival of the 398th Bomb Group. The 55FG converted to North American P-51D Mustangs in July 1944, continuing their primary task of escorting B-17 and B-24 bombers that attacked such targets as industries and marshalling yards in Germany, and airfields and V-weapon sites in France. In July the group attacked gun emplacements during the Saint-L√¥ breakthrough in July 1944, and transportation facilities during the Battle of the Bulge, December 1944 ‚Äì January 1945. The group also patrolled the air over the English Channel and bombed bridges in the Tours area during the invasion of the Continent in June 1944. The unit patrolled the Arnhem sector to support the airborne invasion of the Netherlands in September 1944 along with strafing trucks, locomotives, and oil depots near Wesel when the Allies crossed the Rhine in March 1945. The unit received a Distinguished Unit Citation for eight missions to Germany between 3 and 13 September 1944 when the group not only destroyed enemy fighters in the air to protect the bombers it was escorting, but also descended to low levels, in spite of intense anti-aircraft fire, to strafe airfields and to destroy enemy aircraft on the ground. Received second DUC for operations on 19 February 1945 when the organization flew a sweep over Germany to hit railway tracks, locomotives, oil cars, goods wagons, troop cars, buildings, and military vehicles. The 55th Flew last combat mission on 21 April 1945. The 55th Fighter Group moved to AAF Station Kaufbeuren Germany on 22 July 1945 as part of the occupation forces. It was assigned to United States Air Forces in Europe. While on occupation duty, the group was one of the units to receive the first U.S. operational jet fighter, the Lockheed P-80B Shooting Star in July 1946. However, the Group continued to fly P-51s and according to. one source, A-26s. On 29 April, the unit moved to AAF Station Giebelstadt, Germany, and on 20 August 1946, the unit was inactivated, the resources being transferred to the 31st Fighter Group. With more than 600 combat missions, the group destroyed over 400 enemy aircraft while damaging more than 100. The 55th, inactivated in August 1946, had 16 aces credited with 90 victories. Postwar era Unidentified RB-17G of the 55th Reconnaissance Group On 24 February 1947, Strategic Air Command activated and redesignated the 55th Fighter Group as the 55th Reconnaissance group at MacDill Field, Florida, operating the RB-17. The newly activated group's mission consisted of aerial photography, mapping, charting, and photo reconnaissance missions, some of which flew around the globe. RB-17s were specifically used by the 55th RG to probe the borders of the Soviet Union, who had by then begun to emerge as a potential threat to the Western Powers. Little was known about the air defence capability of the Soviet Union at this time and the most effective way of determining their capability was to probe the borders and see whether they would respond. Gradually the RB-17s and other aircraft mapped the perimeter of the Soviet Air Defences from the Baltic to the Sea of Okhotsk, north of Japan. The group then converted to RB-29s and transferred to Topeka (later Forbes) AFB, Kansas, in 1948, but was again inactivated in October 1949. On 1 November 1950, the 55th Strategic reconnaissance group was activated as a \\"paper organization\\" with the tactical squadrons attached directly to the 55th Strategic Reconnaissance wing. The wing was bestowed with the awards and honors of the 55th Reconnaissance Group and moved to Ramey AFB, Puerto Rico. In 1952 the group was again inactivated on 16 June 1952 as the Air Force reorganized its wings into the tri-deputate system. Modern era The group was reactivated in on 29 August 1991 as the 55th Operations Group and assigned to the 55th Wing. It was activated on 1 September 1991. The 55th OG was the operational component of the wing under the new \\"Objective Wing\\" concept adapted by the Air Force, and was bestowed the history and honors of the 55th 55 Strategic Reconnaissance Group. The 55th Operations Group activated with one of the largest and most diverse missions in the USAF. The 24th Reconnaissance Squadron at Eareckson AFB, Shemya, Alaska, joined the group with its Cobra Eye and Cobra Ball missions. On 1 April 1993, the 55th OG Wing took operational control of the 11th Airlift Flight. The 11 ALF flew operational airlift missions in support of the commander of the United States Strategic Command and transported high-ranking military, Department of Defense officials, and members of Congress. This unit has since inactivated and the mission has reverted to Air Mobility Command. The 2 ACCS also inactivated in 1994 with its mission transferring to the 7th Airborne Command and Control Squadron.

The series was produced by Aaron Spelling and was set behind the scenes of a top entertainment magazine titled \\"Glitter\\" and attempted to combine the urgency of journalism and business politics with the glamorous lifestyles of the rich and famous featured in the pages of the magazine. The leading cast members were David Birney, Morgan Brittany and Arthur Hill. The format of the series was similar to two other popular ABC shows which were also produced by Aaron Spelling; The Love Boat and Hotel, in that each week it featured high-profile guest appearances from famous celebrities, including Ginger Rogers and Cyd Charisse. Unlike the other shows, Glitter was not a ratings success. It was scheduled on Thursday nights against Simon & Simon, Cheers and Night Court which were all among the Top 20 most-watched programs at that time. The first three episodes aired in September 1984, and then the show was taken off the air (though was still in production) until December 1984 when three more episodes were shown. Ratings did not improve and the series was cancelled. The remaining eight episodes were shown during December 1985 as part of ABC's late-night line-up. Despite its lack of success in the US, Glitter was sold internationally. It was shown in the UK on BBC1 in the summer of 1985 (though not all episodes were shown).

The male has a black head, a yellow body, black flight feathers and a stout bright yellow-orange conical bill. The female is a dull greenish-olive but has black flight feathers and a yellow bill. The oriole finch is found in Africa and is native to Burundi, Cameroon, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Kenya, Malawi, Nigeria, Rwanda, South Sudan, Tanzania and Uganda. It lives in subtropical or tropical moist evergreen montane forests. The species was described by the British zoologist and collector Louis Fraser in 1843 and given the binomial name Coccothraustes olivaceus. The oriole finch is placed in its own monotypic genus Linurgus. The exact relationship of this genus to other finch genera is unclear. In their phylogenetic analysis published in 2012, Zuccon and colleagues found that the oriole finch was a sister group to the genus Serinus. This contrasts with the earlier 2009 analysis by Nguembock and colleagues which found that the oriole finch was sister to the genus Carduelis. Four subspecies are recognised: *L. o. olivaceus (Fraser, 1843) ‚Äî Cameroon line ; *L. o. prigoginei Schouteden, 1950 ‚Äî Albertine Rift montane forests ; *L. o. elgonensis van Someren, 1918 ‚Äî Imatong Mountains, Kenya and Uganda ; *L. o. kilimensis (Reichenow & Neumann, 1895) ‚Äî northern Malawi and Tanzania.

After the 2006 World Cup, Montiel joined Udinese Calcio. However, following just one season with the club, he was sold to Reggina. In the 2008‚Äì2009 season, he was loaned to the Romanian Liga I team Politenica Ia≈üi, helping them to avoid relegation. For the 2009‚Äì2010 season, Montiel was loaned to the Argentine club Tigre, making his debut on the 2nd day of Apertura 2009 tournament. He substituted Lucas Oviedo in the game against Rosario Central. He reenters in Italy in March 2010. In the season 2010/2011 he is bought to definitive title by the Reggina. Following a period at Benevento between 2012 and 2014. Montiel returned to Olimpia for the 2014 Clausura where he played 14 games before moving to the Copa Libertadores finalist Nacional Asunci√≥n in 2015. In 2016, he has signed a one-year deal with the Peruvian side Uni√≥n Comercio.

This happens because soil is a two-phase material, comprising soil grains and pore fluid, usually groundwater. When soil saturated with water is subjected to an increase in pressure, the high volumetric stiffness of water compared to the soil matrix means that the water initially absorbs all the change in pressure without changing volume, creating excess pore water pressure. As water diffuses away from regions of high pressure due to seepage, the soil matrix gradually takes up the pressure change and shrinks in volume. The theoretical framework of consolidation is therefore closely related to the diffusion equation, the concept of effective stress, and hydraulic conductivity. In the narrow sense, \\"consolidation\\" refers strictly to this delayed volumetric response to pressure change due to gradual movement of water. Some publications also use \\"consolidation\\" in the broad sense, to refer to any process by which soil changes volume due to a change in applied pressure. This broader definition encompasses the overall concept of soil compaction, subsidence, and heave. Some types of soil, mainly those rich in organic matter, show significant creep, whereby the soil changes volume slowly at constant effective stress over a longer time-scale than consolidation due to the diffusion of water. To distinguish between the two mechanisms, \\"primary consolidation\\" refers to consolidation due to dissipation of excess water pressure, while \\"secondary consolidation\\" refers to the creep process. The effects of consolidation are most conspicuous where a building sits over a layer of soil with low stiffness and low permeability, such as marine clay, leading to large settlement over many years. Types of construction project where consolidation often poses technical risk include land reclamation, the construction of embankments, and tunnel and basement excavation in clay. Geotechnical engineers use oedometers to quantify the effects of consolidation. In an oedometer test, a series of known pressures are applied to a thin disc of soil sample, and the change of sample thickness with time is recorded. This allows the consolidation characteristics of the soil to be quantified in terms of the coefficient of consolidation (C_{v}) and hydraulic conductivity (K). History and terminology According to the \\"father of soil mechanics\\", Karl von Terzaghi, consolidation is \\"any process which involves a decrease in water content of saturated soil without replacement of water by air\\". More generally, consolidation refers to the process by which soils change volume in response to a change in pressure, encompassing both compaction and swelling. Magnitude of volume change The experimentally determined consolidation curve (blue dots) for a saturated clay showing a procedure for computing the preconsolidation stress. Consolidation is the process in which reduction in volume takes place by the gradual expulsion or absorption of water under long-term static loads. When stress is applied to a soil, it causes the soil particles to pack together more tightly. When this occurs in a soil that is saturated with water, water will be squeezed out of the soil. The magnitude of consolidation can be predicted by many different methods. In the classical method developed by Terzaghi, soils are tested with an oedometer test to determine their compressibility. In most theoretical formulations, a logarithmic relationship is assumed between the volume of the soil sample and the effective stress carried by the soil particles. The constant of proportionality (change in void ratio per order of magnitude change in effective stress) is known as the compression index, given the symbol \\\\lambda when calculated in natural logarithm and C_C when calculated in base-10 logarithm. This can be expressed in the following equation, which is used to estimate the volume change of a soil layer: \\\\delta_c = \\\\frac{ C_c }{ 1 + e_0 } H \\\\log \\\\left( \\\\frac{ \\\\sigma_{zf}' }{ \\\\sigma_{z0}' } \\\\right) \\\\ where :Œ¥c is the settlement due to consolidation. :Cc is the compression index. :e0 is the initial void ratio. :H is the height of the compressible soil. :œÉzf is the final vertical stress. :œÉz0 is the initial vertical stress. When stress is removed from a consolidated soil, the soil will rebound, regaining some of the volume it had lost in the consolidation process. If the stress is reapplied, the soil will consolidate again along a recompression curve, defined by the recompression index. The gradient of the swelling and recompression lines on a plot of void ratio against the logarithm of effective stress often idealised to take the same value, known as the \\"swelling index\\" (given the symbol \\\\kappa when calculated in natural logarithm and C_S when calculated in base-10 logarithm). Cc can be replaced by Cr (the recompression index) for use in overconsolidated soils where the final effective stress is less than the preconsolidation stress. When the final effective stress is greater than the preconsolidation stress, the two equations must be used in combination to model both the recompression portion and the virgin compression portion of the consolidation processes, as follows, \\\\delta_c = \\\\frac{ C_r }{ 1 + e_0 } H \\\\log \\\\left( \\\\frac{ \\\\sigma_{zc}' }{ \\\\sigma_{z0}' } \\\\right) + \\\\frac{ C_c }{ 1 + e_0 } H \\\\log \\\\left( \\\\frac{ \\\\sigma_{zf}' }{ \\\\sigma_{zc}' } \\\\right)\\\\ where œÉzc is the preconsolidation stress of the soil. This method assumes consolidation occurs in only one- dimension. Laboratory data is used to construct a plot of strain or void ratio versus effective stress where the effective stress axis is on a logarithmic scale. The plot's slope is the compression index or recompression index. The equation for consolidation settlement of a normally consolidated soil can then be determined to be: The soil which had its load removed is considered to be \\"overconsolidated\\". This is the case for soils that have previously had glaciers on them. The highest stress that it has been subjected to is termed the \\"preconsolidation stress\\". The \\"over-consolidation ratio\\" (OCR) is defined as the highest stress experienced divided by the current stress. A soil that is currently experiencing its highest stress is said to be \\"normally consolidated\\" and has an OCR of one. A soil could be considered \\"underconsolidated\\" or \\"unconsolidated\\" immediately after a new load is applied but before the excess pore water pressure has dissipated. Occasionally, soil strata form by natural deposition in rivers and seas may exist in an exceptionally low density that is impossible to achieve in an oedometer; this process is known as \\"intrinsic consolidation\\".  Time dependency = Spring analogy  The process of consolidation is often explained with an idealized system composed of a spring, a container with a hole in its cover, and water. In this system, the spring represents the compressibility or the structure of the soil itself, and the water which fills the container represents the pore water in the soil. Schematic diagram of spring analogy # The container is completely filled with water, and the hole is closed. (Fully saturated soil) # A load is applied onto the cover, while the hole is still unopened. At this stage, only the water resists the applied load. (Development of excess pore water pressure) # As soon as the hole is opened, water starts to drain out through the hole and the spring shortens. (Drainage of excess pore water pressure) # After some time, the drainage of water no longer occurs. Now, the spring alone resists the applied load. (Full dissipation of excess pore water pressure. End of consolidation)  Analytical formulation of consolidation rate  The time for consolidation to occur can be predicted. Sometimes consolidation can take years. This is especially true in saturated clays because their hydraulic conductivity is extremely low, and this causes the water to take an exceptionally long time to drain out of the soil. While drainage is occurring, the pore water pressure is greater than normal because it is carrying part of the applied stress (as opposed to the soil particles). T_v=\\\\frac{c_v*t}{(H_{dr})^2} \\\\ Where Tv is the time factor. Hdr is the average longest drain path during consolidation. t is the time at measurement Cv is defined as the coefficient of consolidation found using the log method with C_v=\\\\frac{T_{50}H_{dr}^2}{t_{50}} or the root method with C_v=\\\\frac{T_{95}H_{dr}^2}{t_{95}} t50 time to 50% deformation (consolidation) and t95 is 95% Where T95=1.129 T50=0.197  Creep  The theoretical formulation above assumes that time-dependent volume change of a soil unit only depends on changes in effective stress due to the gradual restoration of steady-state pore water pressure. This is the case for most types of sand and clay with low amounts of organic material. However, in soils with a high amount of organic material such as peat, the phenomenon of creep also occurs, whereby the soil changes volume gradually at constant effective stress. Soil creep is typically caused by viscous behavior of the clay-water system and compression of organic matter. This process of creep is sometimes known as \\"secondary consolidation\\" or \\"secondary compression\\" because it also involves gradual change of soil volume in response to an application of load; the designation \\"secondary\\" distinguishes it from \\"primary consolidation\\", which refers to volume change due to dissipation of excess pore water pressure. Creep typically takes place over a longer time-scale than (primary) consolidation, such that even after the restoration of hydrostatic pressure some compression of soil takes place at slow rate. Analytically, the rate of creep is assumed to decay exponentially with time since application of load, giving the formula: S_s=\\\\frac{H_0}{1+e_0} C_{a} \\\\log \\\\left( \\\\frac {t} {t_{95} } \\\\right) \\\\ Where H0 is the height of the consolidating medium e0 is the initial void ratio Ca is the secondary compression index t is the length of time after consolidation considered t95 is the length of time for achieving 95% consolidation  See also  * Compaction (geology) * Soil mechanics * Vacuum consolidation * Settlement (structural)  References Bibliography  Category:Soil mechanics Category:Sedimentology ","title":"Soil consolidation"},{"id":"4427052","text":"The Big Stony Railway is a historic intrastate railroad that operated in Virginia.

T cell stimulation through CD28 in addition to the T-cell receptor (TCR) can provide a potent signal for the production of various interleukins (IL-6 in particular). CD28 is the receptor for CD80 (B7.1) and CD86 (B7.2) proteins. When activated by Toll-like receptor ligands, the CD80 expression is upregulated in antigen-presenting cells (APCs). The CD86 expression on antigen-presenting cells is constitutive (expression is independent of environmental factors). CD28 is the only B7 receptor constitutively expressed on naive T cells. Association of the TCR of a naive T cell with MHC:antigen complex without CD28:B7 interaction results in a T cell that is anergic. Signaling CD28 possesses an intracellular domain with several residues that are critical for its effective signaling. The YMNM motif beginning at tyrosine 170 in particular is critical for the recruitment of SH2-domain containing proteins, especially PI3K, Grb2 and Gads. The Y170 residue is important for the induction of Bcl-xL via mTOR and enhancement of IL-2 transcription via PKCŒ∏, but has no effect on proliferation and results a slight reduction in IL-2 production. The N172 residue (as part of the YMNM) is important for the binding of Grb2 and Gads and seems to be able to induce IL-2 mRNA stability but not NF-Œ∫B translocation. The induction of NF-Œ∫B seems to be much more dependent on the binding of Gads to both the YMNM and the two proline-rich motifs within the molecule. However, mutation of the final amino acid of the motif, M173, which is unable to bind PI3K but is able to bind Grb2 and Gads, gives little NF-Œ∫B or IL-2, suggesting that those Grb2 and Gads are unable to compensate for the loss of PI3K. IL-2 transcription appears to have two stages; a Y170-dependent, PI3K-dependent initial phase which allows transcription and a PI3K-independent second phase which is dependent on formation of an immune synapse, which results in enhancement of IL-2 mRNA stability. Both are required for full production of IL-2. CD28 also contains two proline-rich motifs that are able to bind SH3-containing proteins. Itk and Tec are able to bind to the N-terminal of these two motifs which immediately succeeds the Y170 YMNM; Lck binds the C-terminal. Both Itk and Lck are able to phosphorylate the tyrosine residues which then allow binding of SH2 containing proteins to CD28. Binding of Tec to CD28 enhances IL-2 production, dependent on binding of its SH3 and PH domains to CD28 and PIP3 respectively. The C-terminal proline-rich motif in CD28 is important for bringing Lck and lipid rafts into the immune synapse via filamin-A. Mutation of the two prolines within the C-terminal motif results in reduced proliferation and IL-2 production but normal induction of Bcl-xL. Phosphorylation of a tyrosine within the PYAP motif (Y191 in the mature human CD28) forms a high affinity- binding site for the SH2 domain of the src kinase Lck which in turn binds to the serine kinase PKC-Œ∏.  Structure  The first structure of CD28 was obtained in 2005 by the T-cell biology group at the University of Oxford.  As a drug target  The drug TGN1412, which was produced by the German biotech company TeGenero, and unexpectedly caused multiple organ failure in trials, is a superagonist of CD28. Unfortunately, it is often ignored that the same receptors also exist on cells other than lymphocytes. CD28 has also been found to stimulate eosinophil granulocytes where its ligation with anti-CD28 leads to the release of IL-2, IL4, IL-13 and IFN-Œ≥.

It was written by Don Priestley and based on the British children's television show of the same name. The music was composed by David Dunn. Gameplay Gameplay In Trap Door, the player takes control of Berk, who must perform tasks for \\"The Thing Upstairs\\" a never-seen entity who lives in the upper floors of the castle where Berk works. In order to help him complete his task, Berk must make use of the many objects lying around his part of the castle as well as the creatures that emerge from the trap door. Berk is assisted by Boni, a talking skull, who provides hints when picked up. He is also somewhat hindered by Drutt, Berk's pet who loves eating worms. Gameplay is largely based around puzzle-solving and the use and manipulation of the many objects littered around Berk's chambers. Berk will also need help from some of the strange creatures that lurk in the caverns under the trap door and these creatures can often be as much a hindrance as a help (as well as downright dangerous). Once Berk has finished taking advantage of a creature's \\"assistance\\" he also has to find a way of making sure it goes back down the trap door. The game has two different skill levels: \\"Learner Berk\\" and \\"Super Berk\\". The difference is that \\"Super Berk\\" mode includes flying ghosts that appear a set time after each task is announced. The ghosts hinder the player's progress by attacking Berk, sending him spinning into another room if he doesn't manage to avoid them. The game can only be completed in \\"Super Berk\\" mode. Reception The game was runner up for best original game of the year at the Golden Joystick Awards. Legacy The Trap Door was followed by a sequel in 1987 called Through The Trap Door, also written by Priestley and published by Piranha.

It was the first American \\"combination\\" candy bar to achieve nationwide success, and is now similar to the Butterfinger and 5th Avenue bars. The Clark Bar was introduced in 1917 by David L. Clark and was popular during and after both World Wars. It was manufactured in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, by the original family-owned business until 1955. It was then manufactured by corporate owners until a series of sales and bankruptcies in the 1990s resulted in transfer of production to the Revere, Massachusetts‚Äìbased New England Confectionery Company (Necco). Following Necco's 2018 bankruptcy, the Clark Bar is now produced in western Pennsylvania, by the Altoona-based Boyer Candy Company. History The original formula of the Clark Bar was pioneered by Irish immigrant David L. Clark in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, in 1917. Its manufacture took advantage of a recently-developed approach that allowed a thin milk chocolate shell to surround a non-chocolate filling. In the case of the Clark bar, the interior consisted of a crispy confection that included ground peanuts around a caramel core. As such, the Clark Bar became the first successful 'combination' candy bar.Tim Richardson, A History of Candy, (Bloomsbury, 2002), p. 230 The bar was developed to be sent to troops during World War I,Bruce Kraig, The Oxford Encyclopedia of Food and Drink in America, 2nd ed. (Oxford University Press, 2012), vol. 1, p. 292 individually wrapped for ease of delivery. It began to be distributed nationally after the war's end, inspiring many manufacturers to produce their own combination bars.Andrew F. Smith, Food and Drink in American History: A \\"Full Course\\" Encyclopedia, (ABC-Cleo, 2013), vol. 1, pp. 141, 182 The small size of its double-bars contributed to their popularity.Tim Richardson, A History of Candy, (Bloomsbury, 2002), p. 327 During World War II the company was sending daily 1.5 million bars to the armed forces, and when several labor strikes at its plant led to shortages among the troops, the federal government stepped in, calling production \\"essential\\" to the war effort. Related products were also produced, such as the smaller-sized Clark Bar Miniatures, Clark Bar Bites and Clark Bar Juniors, along with seasonal Clark Bar Easter Eggs, and a dark chocolate variety. The Clark Bar originally included a caramel 'center of attraction'. In 1965, the recipe was changed to increase the peanut butter content and thus enhance flavor. The caramel center would be removed from the recipe in the 1980s to increase its shelf-life. In 1995, an alternative recipe would briefly be used. Ownership changes From 1911, the Clark company operated out of a North Side production facility, and this was long where the Clark Bar was produced. The illuminated oversized roof-top Clark Bar sign that decorated the original North Side factory would become a Pittsburgh landmark, while a restaurant that operates in the retasked building is named the Clark Bar & Grill in reflection of the treat once made there. The D. L. Clark Co. and its Clark Bar were acquired by Beatrice Foods in 1955, then sold to Leaf Candy Company in 1983. It was under Leaf that production was moved to a new facility in O'Hara Township (suburban Pittsburgh) in 1986. In late 1990, Leaf announced plans to close its O'Hara facility and move production of two other D. L. Clark candy bars, the Zagnut and P. B. Crunchers, to the Chicago area. They decided to cease production of the other Clark products, including the Clark Bar, for which their marketing efforts had failed to achieve a national profile. Pittsburgh-area entrepreneur Michael Carlow purchased D. L. Clark Co. and its remaining brands from Leaf, and combined it with another struggling but iconic local producer, the Pittsburgh Brewing Company and its Iron City beer, as well as a local bakery and a glass manufacturer, plus the Fort Wayne, Indiana-based producer of Bun Bars under the umbrella of the Pittsburgh Food & Beverage Company, continuing production of the Clark Bar in O'Hara. However, amidst accusations of a check kiting scheme that would lead to Carlow's eventual imprisonment, he was forced to relinquish control in 1995, and production ceased. Leaf then foreclosed on a $3 million loan they were still owed, and commenced making Clark Bars at their Illinois facility with an altered recipe. Months later, Clark's assets were sold through bankruptcy court to the newly-formed Clark Bar America, Inc., which restarted production at the O'Hara facility using the prior recipe. This was short-lived, and the company was shuttered in 1999. The recipe and production equipment were bought at bankruptcy by Necco for $4.1 million, and they moved production to their facility in Revere, Massachusetts. Almost two decades later, Necco would in turn fail and in May 2018 was sold at bankruptcy court to Round Hill Investments LLC, who briefly operated the candy manufacturer under a Sweetheart Candy Co. subsidiary before selling the assets in July 2018 and abruptly closing Necco's Revere production facility. The undisclosed buyer, later revealed to have been Spangler Candy Company, would in turn sell the rights to the Clark Bar to the Boyer Candy Company, maker of the Mallo Cup. Based in Altoona, Pennsylvania, they had originally bid on the Clark Bar in the 1990s. At the time of purchase, Boyer planned to restart production of the Clark Bar in western Pennsylvania within six months. Challenges with production machinery speed (\\"They were shooting five feet off the line ‚Äî it was crazy to see.\\") and reproducing the bar's consistency and shape pushed back their reintroduction, but did provide the raw material for Boyer's first Clark-related product, the Clark Cup, a peanut butter cup that originally included ground misshapen Clark Bar in the filling. Once Boyer resolved these production issues, the Clark Bar was available at the factory outlet in late- December 2019, and was released on a limited basis to stores in the Pittsburgh area in mid-February 2020, to be followed first by a full Pittsburgh release, and then sale nationwide. Manufacturing process As described during the period of Necco's ownership, the Clark Bar is produced by a process taking about 90 minutes. The core ingredients are heated into a taffy-like consistency and flattened into a sheet, which is then coated with a layer of peanut butter, and rolled. After cutting into bar-sized lengths, it is enrobed in liquid chocolate, cooled to harden both core and coating, then packaged.Steve Almond, Candyfreak: A Journey Through the Chocolate Underbelly of America, (Algonquin Books, 2004), pp. 52-3 The process of manufacturing the Clark Bar was featured on a segment of the documentary television series How It's Made in 2016.

It serves as the administrative center of Vyshhorod Raion. Its population is approximately . Vyshhorod is a historical town that experienced rises and declines over the centuries. It is now a notable industrial center as well as a growing bedroom community for Kyiv. Geography and climate Vyshhorod is located on a hilly right bank of the Dnieper River adjoining the dam of the Kyiv Reservoir. History Borysohlebska Church (Church of Saints Boris and Gleb) in Vyshhorod. Remains of the ancient walls of Vyshhorod View of Kyiv Reservoir near Vyshhorod Historical building Monument in Vyshorod WW2 museum The earliest historical mention of Vyshgorod (the name literally translates as \\"the town upstream\\") dates from as early as 946, when it was described as the favourite residence of Saint Olga. Also mentioned in De Administrando Imperio, Vyshgorod served as the fortified castle and residence of the monarchs of Kyivan Rus on the Dnieper from that time until 1240, when the Mongols sacked it. At Vyshhorod Vladimir the Great (reigned 980 to 1015) kept a harem of 300 concubines. After the Mongol invasion, the location does not appear in the records again until 1523 - and even then it was documented as a poor village. Vyshgorod grew considerably following the construction of the hydroelectric Kyiv power plant and was finally incorporated as a town in 1968. In 1934-37 and 1947 the archaeological remnants of the medieval town were excavated. The most striking find was the basement of the eight-pillared Church of St. Basil, founded by Vladimir the Great and named after his patron saint. As the church was one of the largest in Kyivan Rus, it took twenty years to complete it. Before the Mongol invasion the church housed the relics of the first East Slavic saints, Boris and Gleb, but their subsequent fate remains a mystery. The ancient Cossack military monastery, the Mezhyhirskyi Monastery, stood not too far away from the city.  Industry  There are more than 1500 enterprises and companies functioning today in Vyshhorod, most important of them being the Kyiv Hydroelectric Power Plant, the Kyiv Pumped Storage Power Plant (both divisions of the Ukrhydroenergo) and a building materials factory controlled by the Henkel. Transportation Vyshhorod is connected to the Kyiv and other destinations mainly by roads. There is also a non-electrified terminus rail connection to Kyiv used for both freight transport and peak hour commuter passenger service. City's riverport facilities are used for local industrial purposes only. Jitney buses run between Vyshhorod and the Heroiv Dnipra station of the Kyiv Metro's Obolonsko‚ÄìTeremkivska line.  Culture  Vyshgorod has been famous for its cultural traditions and original talents for ages. The name of Exemplary amateur town children and youth brass band ‚Äì studio Vodograi (Fountain) is famous not only in Ukraine but also abroad. The band visited many countries of European Union. Well known and famous not only in Ukraine but also abroad is Korali, the municipal choir of Vyshgorod. Korali is laureate of different national and international festivals and competitions. But the major achievement of the choir is no doubt a victory at International competition named after F. Shubert (2003 Vienna, Austria). Korali won the first prize and the special prize of sponsor sympathy. In the area of the town there is Vyshgorod historical-cultural reserve which includes the Pottery center, the Historical museum and the house of Klyukva. For the recent years Vyshgorod has been adorned with new monuments and memorials such as Memorial to the soldiers ‚Äì internationalists, Memorial to the victims of Holodomor, Memorial to the heroes of Chernobyl, Memorial to Sts. Boris and Gleb ‚Äì patron saints of the town. Each of them is a work of art with its soul and history.

Early life and career  Henry Hall was born in Peckham, South London. He won a scholarship to Trinity College of Music where he studied trumpet, piano, harmony and counterpoint. His first job was as copyist at the head office of the Salvation Army for which he wrote several marches. During World War I, Hall served with the Royal Field Artillery and played trumpet and piano in the regimental band. Hall's musical career was slow to start but eventually he was engaged by the London Midland and Scottish Railway to take charge of music throughout their then large chain of hotels, including Gleneagles Hotel, where he had previously led the band. Hall describes in his autobiography, Here's to the Next Time, that on a Thursday in October 1923 he met a young woman, Margery Harker, while travelling by rail to Dartmoor. Hall mentions that he and Margery were about the same age and had much in common, after discussing the C. B. Cochran production of the musical Little Nellie Kelly and Paul Whiteman's take on \\"Till My Luck comes Rolling Along\\", a number from the show. The following day, Henry invited Margery to a dance and proposed to her at the end of the evening. By Saturday, just two days after meeting, the two were engaged and were married in January 1924, at St. George's, Hanover Square, London.\\"Hall, Henry R, & Harker Margery\\" in Register of Marriages for St. George's Hanover Square Registration District, vol. 1a (1924), p. 648 Henry and Margery had two children during their marriage, Mike and Betty. In June 1924, on the opening night of the Gleneagles Hotel, Hall persuaded the BBC to broadcast the event on radio, which began his long association with BBC radio.  The 1930s: broadcasting star  It was from Gleneagles that the BBC took him in 1932 to succeed Jack Payne as band leader of the BBC Dance Orchestra. At 5.15pm each weekday, Hall's radio programme from Broadcasting House gathered a huge following across the nation. His signature tune was \\"It's Just the Time for Dancing\\", and he usually concluded with \\"Here's to the Next Time\\". In 1932 he recorded the songs \\"Here Comes the Bogeyman\\" and \\"Teddy Bears' Picnic\\" with his BBC Orchestra, featuring singer Val Rosing on vocals. The latter song gained enormous popularity and sold over a million copies. In 1934 his popularity was confirmed when his orchestra topped the bill at the London Palladium. He featured in the documentary BBC The Voice of Britain (1935), the source of the \\"This is Henry Hall speaking\\" clip much used in documentaries on this period. In 1936 Henry Hall made his first feature film and in the same year he was guest conductor of the ship's orchestra on the Queen Mary‚Äôs maiden voyage. In 1937 the BBC Dance Orchestra played at the opening of the Gaumont State Cinema in Kilburn. The same year Hall left the BBC to tour with his own band, which comprised many members of his BBC band. He toured the halls of Britain and Europe, and generated controversy by dropping songs by Jewish composers while playing in Berlin in February 1938. Hall's band was the first to appear on television.  Later years  During the Second World War, Hall played for the troops, and gave concerts and shows in factories all over Britain. Many of these concerts came in the form of \\"Guest Night\\" broadcasts. From June to November, 1943, \\"Guest Night\\" was replaced by \\"Henry Hall's Rhythm Entertainment\\" intended to provide radio entertainment for troops overseas. After the war he developed his show business interests, becoming something of an agent and producer. His BBC work again blossomed as he hosted Henry Hall's Guest Night on the radio and later on television. Hall was also involved in the launch of the television programme Face the Music. Hall had a son, Michael, who served in the Royal Navy, and later became one of the resident chairmen at the famous Players Theatre in London, founded by actor Leonard Sachs, famous chairman of BBC TV's The Good Old Days, and there was a daughter, Betty. In 1955, Hall published his autobiography Here's to the Next Time. He dedicated it to his wife, Margery. He ceased regular broadcasting in 1964 and was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire, CBE, in 1970. He died in Eastbourne, Sussex, in October 1989. A green memorial plaque on the site of his former home at 8 Randolph Mews, Little Venice, was unveiled on 2 May 1996.City of Westminster green plaques A blue plaque commemorates Hall at 38 Harman Drive in Cricklewood, London, where he lived between 1932 and 1959.  Popular culture  Hall unknowingly lent his name to a work shift at Frickley Colliery in South Yorkshire. Miners at the colliery who worked the unpopular night shift referred to the shift as Henry Hall's shift or simply Henry's. This was due to the fact that the shift began at 6pm, the same time as Hall started his show on the radio. When he died, the local football club Frickley Athletic, who had close ties with the colliery, marked the occasion in their matchday programme with a page, dedicated to Hall, entitled \\"No More Henry's\\".

It is the largest retail shopping center in the Volusia-Flagler market. Opened on October 15, 1974, the mall comprises more than 120 stores on one level, as well as a food court. Anchor stores are JCPenney, Macy's, and three Dillard's locations. The mall is owned and managed by CBL & Associates Properties. History Volusia Mall opened in 1974 at a site on U.S. Highway 92, adjacent to I-95 and U.S. 1. It was originally built with Ivey's, May- Cohens, Sears just like at Orange Park Mall a year later, but also started out with a JCPenney. Ivey's opened with the mall, in October 1974. May-Cohens came inline in December. Sears was the next to open, in February 1975, followed by JCPenney, in August 1975. Like Coastland Center, all of the anchors except for JCPenney were built as two-level stores. The first expansion of Volusia Mall was completed in March 1982, when two-level Burdines and Belk-Lindsey stores were added to the existing structure. Shortly after May Cohen's changed to May Florida in 1987, the chain was acquired by Maison Blanche a year later. This store in turn was taken over by Fairfield, Ohio-based Mercantile Stores in early 1992, thus converting to Gayfers. Dillard's purchased Ivey's in June 1990, followed by Belk-Lindsey in November 1996, and Gayfers in late 1998 as their parent Mercantile was bought out. These made the mall the first (and only) mall in the entire country to have three separate Dillard's stores. Burdines was dual-branded as Burdines-Macy's in 2003, and simply Macy's in 2005. Original tenants in Volusia Mall included a Walgreens pharmacy and a tri-screen movie theater. After Walgreens relocated outside the mall, its space was converted to another mall entrance, while the theater became a storefront church. Center court housed a large fountain and wishing well a couple hundred feet in size. The structure featured multiple geysers as well as a jogging path and was also used to stage special events. This feature was downsized in 1997. The Volusia Mall is the largest mall in the Daytona Beach area. On December 28, 2018, it was announced that Sears would be closing as part of a plan to close 80 stores nationwide. The store closed on March 10, 2019 . On April 22, 2019, Transform Saleco LLC purchased the Sears building for $5.9 Million. It is unknown what is planned for the future of the former Sears. Transport Votran routes 10, 11, 18, and 19 serve the mall from Monday to Saturday during daylight hours (except those days that fall on holidays). Votran Night Service Route 10 serves the mall at night from Monday to Saturday with a limited schedule on Sundays and holidays.

Both were loosely based on trademarks of Atari, Inc.  Publication history  The first Atari Force comics, which only counted five issues, were published in 1982 and were created mainly to illustrate story lines for home console games being released by fellow Warner Communications subsidiary Atari, Inc. The minicomics were packed in with the games Defender, Berzerk, Star Raiders, Phoenix, and Galaxian. The comics were written by Gerry Conway and Roy Thomas and the artists included Ross Andru, Gil Kane, Dick Giordano, and Mike DeCarlo. An Atari Force special insert appeared in two comic books cover dated January 1983DC Comics Presents #53 and The New Teen Titans #27 at the Grand Comics Database and served as a prequel to the ongoing series launched a year later. The insert was the story previously published in the Phoenix minicomic, but the story title was changed to \\"Code Name: Liberator\\" and the featured ship's name became Liberator. In addition, the art for the aliens showed them as more frog-like. Atari released a Liberator arcade game featuring Commander Martin Champion and the Atari Force name. In 1983 DC Comics published a graphic novel version of the Star Raiders mini- comic; it was the first title of the DC Graphic Novel series. It was written by Elliot S! Maggin and illustrated by Jos√© Luis Garc√≠a-L√≥pez. The graphic novel was a larger format than normal comic books, and reached a much larger market (via comic book specialty stores) than the small subset of persons who bought the 2600 cartridge. The graphic novel story may have also had more material than the original mini-comic, in addition to the larger format. The second series (Jan. 1984 - Aug. 1985) was released monthly, in conventional comic-book format, and lasted for 20 issues.Atari Force comic books - Comic Vine Gerry Conway returned as writer while Jos√© Luis Garc√≠a-L√≥pez became the main pencil artist. However, original series concept artist Ross Andru did draw issues 4‚Äì5. In issue #13, Eduardo Barreto took over as penciler and, in #14, Mike Baron became the regular writer through the final issue, #20. Issues 12-20 also featured backup stories by different writers and artists. In 1986, a \\"Special\\" issue was released with work by different creators, some of whom had done backup stories for volume 2. The backup story of issue #20, ‚ÄúHukka vs. the Bob!‚Äù by Keith Giffen, Robert Loren Fleming, and Karl Kesel, was reprinted in the Best of DC #71 digest, containing the Year's Best Comics Stories, in April 1986, and was voted as one of the best comic book stories of the year in Comics Buyers Guide magazine, among others. In July 2015, Dynamite Entertainment announced that they would reprint the comic book and new series based on Atari properties: Asteroids, Centipede, Crystal Castles, Missile Command, Tempest, and Yars' Revenge.  Plot  The original Atari Force was a team of humans from different nations using the multi-dimensional starship Scanner One to search for a new planet for humanity to inhabit as the Earth was facing ecological devastation. The team was handpicked by A.T.A.R.I. (Advanced Technology and Research Institute), and consisted of Martin Champion as mission commander, Lydia Perez as pilot and executive officer, Li-San O'Rourke as security officer, Mohandas Singh as flight engineer, and Dr. Lucas Orion as medical officer. A semi-sentient alien creature, named Hukka because of the noise he made, later joined as team mascot. The second team, formed approximately 25 years after the first, was also led by Martin Champion. He was convinced that the original team's nemesis, the Dark Destroyer, still existed. Although he was correct, most of the rest of humanity did not believe it, but humored him due to his heroic status in successfully leading the original Atari Force to find New Earth. Other team members included Christopher \\"Tempest\\" Champion, son of Martin Champion and Lydia Perez; Erin \\"Dart\\" Bia O'Rourke-Singh, daughter of Mohandas Singh and Li-San O'Rourke; Hukka; Morphea, an insectoid empath; Babe, an alien toddler of immense size and strength; and Pakrat, a humanoid rodent thief. Later additions to the team were Blackjak, Dart's human lover; Taz, a short alien warrior; and Kargg, the Dark Destroyer's former chief underling.

History  Wong's previous two albums, Michael's First Album and Ray of Light, stirred up a fan base but did not make much ground in terms of record sales. His fans had to wait another two years before Wong finally launched his third album, Fairy Tale. After rejecting the first few songs he listed himself for the album with his sense of perfection, Wong eventually re-selected some songs himself and finally rooted for his ten favourite songs to be cut into the album, of which six were composed by himself. His two years of work paid off when this album immediately attained success, and became critically acclaimed as Wong's best-selling album.  Title song  The first single from this album, also called Fairy Tale, was composed by himself. Wong, who is more of a composer and hardly wrote lyrics, asked about 30 lyricists for suggestions for this particular song. After finally adding a finishing touch to the song with lyrics he wrote himself, he then left it to be arranged and produced by the experienced Japanese producer, Taichi Nakamura. Fairy Tale is considered by many fans as Wong's strongest single. It became number one at the Baidu 500 immediately after it was released in January 2005, making it to the top of the download counter for 15 weeks. The single is arguably the most successful Chinese language song in the 21st Century. As of 2007 it is still among the top in the karaoke charts. Wong became the first Malaysian to win four main awards in the Chinese music scene's biggest award show, the Hong Kong TVB8 Golden Music Awards on 3 December 2005. He won Best Composition, Best Composer/Artist, Top Ten Songs of the Year, and Best of the Year's Top 10 Songs. The music video accompanying Fairy Tale has been the subject of heated debate. It depicts Wong playing the song at a concert, transmitted to a girl in a hospital bed by phone. Intermittent flashbacks during the song reveal that she had a nosebleed before collapsing. She was most likely suffering from some form of cancer. At the conclusion of the video, she dies, and a voice-over says, \\"When the whole world ignores me, only you can never ignore me okay?\\"  Track listing  # \\"Intro\\" # \\"Á´•Ë©±\\" (T√≥ng Hu√†; Fairy Tale) # \\"Â§©Â†Ç\\" (TiƒÅnt√°ng; Heaven) # \\"Â∞ëÂπ¥\\" (Sh√†oni√°n; Teenager) # \\"ÊâãÊ©üÁïôË®Ä\\" (Sh«íu Jƒ´ Li√∫ Yan; Cellphone Voice Message) # \\"ÂêëÂ∑¶Ëµ∞ÂêëÂè≥Ëµ∞\\" (Xi√†ng Zu«í Z«íu Xi√†ng Yo√π Z«íu; Turn Left Turn Right) # \\"‰∏ÄÈªûÂÖâ‰∏ÄÈªû‰∫Æ\\" (Yƒ´ Di«én GuƒÅng Yƒ´ Di«én Li√†ng; Little Light, Little Bright) # \\"ÊúüÈôê\\" (Qƒ´ Xi√†n; Deadline) # \\"Êµ∑ÈÇä\\" (H«éi BiƒÅn; Beside the Sea) # \\"Â¶πÂ¶π\\" (M√®im√®i; Little Sister) # \\"Ë®òÂæóÊàëÊÑõ‰Ω†\\" (J√¨ de W«í √Äi N«ê; Remember I Love You) # \\"The End\\"  Bonus MV VCD  # Fairy Tale Á´•Ë©± # The First Time Á¨¨‰∏ÄÊ¨° # Sadness Subway ÂÇ∑ÂøÉÂú∞Èêµ # Christmas in 2999 2999Âπ¥ÁöÑËÅñË™ïÁØÄ # As if nothing had happened Ëã•ÁÑ°ÂÖ∂‰∫ã  Cover versions  * Hong Kong singer Charlene Choi, part of the Cantopop duo Twins, sang a cover version of this song in Cantonese * Singaporean pop singer Aliff Aziz sang a cover version in Malay titled Cinta Arjuna. * Cambodian singer Sokun Nisa sang a cover of the song in Khmer called Srok Trik Pneak Pel kom Pong Nhor Nhim. * Japanese singer Kousuke Atari sang a cover version in Japanese. * Korean singer Kim Hyung Joong (ko) sang a cover version in Korean called Dong Hwa (ÎèôÌôî) * Indonesian singer Yuni Shara sang the cover version in Indonesian titled Selamanya Aku Milikmu, the song was later used as soundtrack of Indonesian TV series Saur Sepuh Category:2005 albums Category:Michael Wong (singer) albums ","title":"Fairy Tale (Michael Wong album)"},{"id":"4427242","text":"Finger Prints is a book published by Francis Galton through Macmillan in 1892.

With The Life and Death of Vittoria Corombona the famous Venetian Curtizan) is a tragedy by English playwright John Webster (c. 1580 ‚Äì c. 1634). According to Webster's own preface to the 1612 Quarto Edition, \\"To the Reader\\", the play's first performance in that year was a notorious failure; he complained that the play was acted in the dead of winter before an unreceptive audience. The play's complexity, sophistication, and satire made it a poor fit with the repertory of Queen Anne's Men at the Red Bull Theatre, where it was first performed. It was successfully revived in 1630 by Queen Henrietta's Men at the Cockpit Theatre and published again in 1631. Background The story is loosely based on an event in Italy thirty years prior to the play's composition: the murder of Vittoria Accoramboni in Padua on 22 December 1585. Webster's dramatisation of this event turned Italian corruption into a vehicle for depicting \\"the political and moral state of England in his own day\\", particularly the corruption in the royal court. The play explores the differences between the reality of people and the way they depict themselves as good, \\"white\\", or pure.

Basis Webster based The White Devil on newsletter versions of the story of the killing of Vittoria Accoramboni. Such recollections detailed how Vittoria, of a proud but poor family, married the nephew of Cardinal Montalto, who later became pope Pope Sixtus V. In 1580, she met Paolo Giordano Orsini, Duke of Bracciano, previously married to Isabella Medici of the famous Medici family. Upon meeting Vittoria, the Duke fell desperately in love with her and arranged for the Cardinal's nephew to be killed in order that he might secretly marry Vittoria. Pope Gregory soon found out and ordered Vittoria and the Duke to part and even resorted to having Vittoria imprisoned in the Castel Sant'Angelo under the suspicion of having killed her husband. In 1585 a new pope was elected and amid the confusion of change Vittoria and Bracciano married and left Rome. In the play the Pope is misnamed Paul IV (he was in fact the former-Cardinal Montalto Sixtus V, Paul IV having died in 1559). Eight months later the Duke died and the Medici family, wishing to protect their family interests, challenged his will, which placed Vittoria to be in charge of his fortune. When Vittoria refused to co-operate, according to the play, the Medicis arranged for her to be killed. She was stabbed to death in Padua by Ludovico Orsini, a relative of her first husband. Plot summary Count Lodovico is banished from Rome for debauchery and murder; his friends, Gasparo and Antonelli promise to work for the repeal of his sentence. The Duke of Brachiano has conceived a violent passion for Vittoria Corombona, daughter of a noble but impoverished Venetian family, despite the fact they are both married to other people. Vittoria's brother Flamineo, employed as a secretary to Brachiano, has been scheming to bring his sister and the Duke together in the hope of advancing his career, much to the dismay of their mother, Cornelia. The plan is foiled by the arrival of Brachiano's wife Isabella, escorted by her brother and Cardinal Monticelso. They are both outraged by the rumours of Brachiano's infidelity and set out to make the affair public; before that happens Brachiano and Flamineo arrange to have Camillo (Vittoria's husband) and Isabella murdered. Vittoria is put on trial for the murder of her husband and although there is no real evidence against her, she is condemned by the Cardinal to imprisonment in a convent for penitent whores. Flamineo pretends madness to protect himself from awkward suggestions. The banished Count Lodovico is pardoned and returns to Rome; confessing he had been secretly in love with Isabella, he vows to avenge her death. Isabella's brother Francisco also plots revenge. He pens a love letter to Vittoria, intentionally allowing it to fall into the hands of Brachiano, in order to fuel his jealousy. Though at first his plan seems to work, Vittoria manages to convince Brachiano that she is faithful and the two elope. Cardinal Monticelso is elected Pope and as his first act he excommunicates Vittoria and Brachiano, who have fled Rome. Vittoria and Brachiano, now married, hold court in Padua. Three mysterious strangers have arrived to enter Brachiano's service. These are Francisco, disguised as Mulinassar, a Moor, and Lodovico and Gasparo, disguised as Capuchin monks, all conspiring to avenge Isabella's death. They begin their revenge by poisoning Brachiano. As he is dying, Lodovico and Gasparo reveal themselves to him. Next, Zanche, Vittoria's Moorish maid, who has fallen in love with her supposed countryman Mulinassar, reveals to him the murders of Isabella and Camillo and Flamineo's part in them. Flamineo is banished from court for the murder of his brother Marcello by Brachiano's son Giovanni, the new Duke, and sensing that his crimes are catching up with him he goes to see Vittoria. He tries to persuade her and Zanche to a triple suicide by shooting him, then themselves. Vittoria and Zanche shoot Flamineo and, thinking him dead, exult in his death and their escape. Much to their surprise, Flamineo rises from the 'dead' and reveals to them the pistols were not loaded. While trying to exact his own revenge on Vittoria, Lodovico and Gasparo then enter the scene and complete their revenge by killing her. Giovanni and officers come to the scene and the play ends with Giovanni learning of his uncle's participation in the bloody acts and sending Lodovico off to torture. Productions The play was written for and first performed by Queen Anne's Men at the Red Bull Theatre in Clerkenwell in the early months of 1612. The troupe usually offered simpler and more optimistic plays of the type written by their dramatist, Thomas Heywood. The play staged before Webster's seems to have been If This Be Not a Good Play, a tragicomedy by Thomas Dekker. Webster's play failed at its debut. In the prefatory epistle to the quarto, Webster praised the actors, mentioning Richard Perkins; but complained of the winter weather and above all of the audience, whose intellect he compared to that of donkeys. The first successful modern production was that of the Marlowe Society (ADC Theatre, Cambridge, March 1920), with music by C. Armstrong Gibbs and with Eric Maschwitz as Vittoria. The Society specialised in Elizabethan and Jacobean revivals in uncut texts performed with their original economy and rapidity, and with the female roles played by men. \\"Anybody who enjoys hearing beautiful poetry beautifully spoken\\" wrote the editor of the Cambridge Review, \\"and tragic passion 'with dignity put on' should not miss this wonderful opportunity. What a magnificent play!\\"Cambridge Review, 12 March 1920 \\"After three hundred years it must console the poet in his Elysium to know that at last his play has been played with success before a 'full and understanding auditory'. We must confess that to us it was the ritual of an initiation to the mysteries of a play which we always believed to be great, but which we never realised was quite so wonderful\\".Cambridge Review, 30 April 1920 The production inspired the Cambridge scholar F. L. Lucas to edit the complete plays of Webster. \\"But in what exactly does the fascination of Webster consist?\\" he asked in the New Statesman.New Statesman, 1 March 1924 \\"What could make the Cambridge production of The White Devil in 1920 seem still, to at least two who saw it then without any preconceptions, the most staggering performance they had ever known?\\" In 1925 the Renaissance Theatre mounted a heavily cut version featuring Viola Tree and Cedric Hardwicke. The production was not well reviewed, perhaps mainly because of a failure to understand the special requirements of Renaissance dramaturgy. Webster scholar F. L. Lucas asked in the New Statesman, \\"Who can hope to speak passionate verse lying on one elbow on the floor?\\"New Statesman, 17 October 1925 A London production in 1947 at the Duchess Theatre directed by Michael Benthall featured Hugh Griffith as Monticelso, Patrick Macnee as Hortensio/Spanish Ambassador, Claire Bloom as one of the Ladies of Brachiano's court, Margaret Rawlings as Vittoria and Andrew Cruickshank as the Duke of Florence. In 1965, an Off-Broadway production was staged at the Circle in the Square starring Frank Langella as Flamineo, Carrie Nye as Vittoria, Paul Stevens as Brachiano, Robert Burr as Francisco, Eric Berry as Monticelso and Christina Pickles as Cornelia. The production ran from 6 December 1965 to 17 April 1966 and won the Obie Award for Distinguished Performance (Frank Langella). In November 1969, the National Theatre at the Old Vic in London, performed the play in a production by Frank Dunlop (who went on to found the Young Vic). The cast was largely drawn from the company. Geraldine McEwan played Vittoria, Edward Woodward Flamineo, Edward Petherbridge Lodovico, Benjamin Whitrow Camillo, Derek Godfrey Bracciano, Jane Lapotaire Zanche, Hazel Hughes Cornelia, John Moffatt Monticelso, Jane Wenham Isabella, Anthony Nicholls Francisco and Edward Hardwicke Marcello. In later performances Derek Jacobi played Lodovico. It was designed by Piero Gherardi as a crumbling wall out of which characters emerged like crawling insects in fantastic costumes of great extravagance. William Hobbs staged the fights and played the Spanish Ambassador. Mime work was by Claude Chagrin. The assistant director was Roland Joffe (since then the director of \\"The Killing Fields\\" and \\"The Mission\\"). The Royal Shakespeare Company performed The White Devil in 1996 at the Swan Theatre in Stratford- upon-Avon (later transferred to London to The Pit at The Barbican), directed by Gale Edwards with Richard McCabe as Flamineo, Philip Quast as Ludovico, Ray Fearon as Brachiano, Jane Gurnett as Vittoria, Stephen Boxer as Francisco and Philip Voss. The company returned to the play in 2014 with a production in the Swan Theatre in Stratford-upon-Avon, directed by Maria Aberg with David Sturzaker as Bracciano, Kirsty Bushell as Vittoria, David Rintoul as Cardinal Monticelso, Simon Scardifield as Francisco and Joseph Arkley as Ludovico; in this production, Flamineo, Vittoria's brother, was played by a woman (Laura Elphinstone). On 01 March 1997, the BBC World Service broadcast an adaptation starring Anton Lesser and Helen Baxendale. On 15 August 2010 BBC Radio 3 broadcast a production adapted and directed by Marc Beeby which, according to the BBC Radio 3 web site, \\"sets the action in a murky underworld of the 1950s ‚Äì a world that seeks to hide its shifting alliances, betrayals and sudden violence beneath a flaky veneer of honour and respectability.\\" The production featured Patrick Kennedy as Flamineo, Anna Maxwell Martin as Vittoria, Frances de la Tour as Cornelia, Shaun Dingwall as Brachiano, Peter Wright as Francisco, Sean Baker as Monticelso and Harry Myers as Ludovico. On 26 January 2017 a run started at the Sam Wanamaker Playhouse, London (a venue embodying the features of a typical theatre from the period of the original seventeenth century production). The Red Bull Theatre in New York performed The White Devil in 2019. To date, this play has never been filmed or televised. ReferencesFurther reading  The short story 'A Christmas in Padua' in F. L. Lucas's The Woman Clothed with the Sun (1937) retells the final hours in December 1585 of Vittoria Accoramboni (the original of Webster's White Devil), slanting the narrative from her perspective.

The game is a sequel to the original Blaster Master originally published for the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES). It was published specifically for the North American market following the success of the first NES game in the same region. The staff of the original Japanese version of Blaster Master, titled Ch√¥ Wakusei Senki Metafight, had nothing to do with Blaster Master 2, and Sunsoft Japan did not release BM2 in Japan.  Plot  The game takes place four years after Jason's Encounter with the Plutonium Boss and the radioactive mutants under the Earth.Blaster Master 2 at MobyGames His only reminder of the incident is S.O.P.H.I.A., the vehicle he used to stop them, which he has hidden in an abandoned barn. One day, one bolt of lightning struck the house and caused the ceiling to crumble, knocking Jason unconscious. When Jason woke up, S.O.P.H.I.A. was in pieces and the parts he had collected from his first dealings with the Mutant Bosses were missing. Little does Jason know that there are more lightning beings where the first one came from and they are planning to destroy the Earth. The beings started digging towards the Earth's core in order to shift the planet's weight off its axis, leading to total annihilation. The parts from SOPHIA are being used to create a robotic army to assist the being in accomplishing their mission. Now, Jason must stop them, but he won't make it without the help of SOPHIA. Since he can't recover the parts, he decided to redesign it to better prepare himself for the ordeal facing him. After 29 days, SOPHIA was completely rebuilt and ready for battle. Remembering where he saw the being's footsteps, Jason jumped in his vehicle and headed towards the mountains where the challenge begins.  Characters  Jason Frudnick - He is the protagonist throughout the Blaster Master series. He is the character that accidentally discovered SOPHIA while trying to retrieve his pet frog Fred. In Blaster Master 2, Jason is young (age 19) and couldn't have been more prepared for battle. His job is to eliminate the Plutonium Boss once and for all. Jason's equipment is fairly simple in Blaster Master 2. He is wearing body armor that has moderate protection from heat and impact. Jason also comes with his usual blast cannon that is equipped onto his left arm brace. It does not overheat, and has unlimited energy. In Blaster Master 2, Jason is mostly seen inside SOPHIA's canopy, but can easily hop out at any time in the game when in the sidescroll view. Jason does not take impact from falling too well in BM2, but when in the \\"Jason view\\" he does not take damage from falling impact. Jason is more easily seen in detail when challenging a boss or even an underboss. He is approximately ten times larger in this view. S.O.P.H.I.A. (sometimes referred to as SOPHIA) - The robotic, combat tank-like vehicle used throughout the Blaster Master series. SOPHIA comes in many different models, and the one that is seen in Blaster Master 2 is SOPHIA 4th (2000). The model has been rebuilt by Jason and has many new and helpful features from the previous models of SOPHIA (SOPHIA Nora MA-01, SOPHIA Nora MA-02).  Gameplay  Under the development team of Software Creations and the marketing team at Sunsoft of America, several things were altered in the new Blaster Master 2 game, such as the name of the vehicle (now \\"S.O.P.H.I.A.\\"), as well as significantly expanded gameplay. There are now 8 levels to play through, and each level containing a power-up or new obtainable weapon in which Jason or SOPHIA can use throughout the game. The platform-jumping characteristics that made the original NES game so popular among fans were preserved, while other viewpoints provided an additional level of gameplay unique to BM2 alone. There were now three ways to play: sidescroll view (S.O.P.H.I.A. and Jason), overhead view (S.O.P.H.I.A.), and Jason running through rooms (with a large view, and a small view with Jason running through certain parts of the stages).  Sidescroll view  Normal view of SOPHIAIn the sidescroll view, players battled through levels just like in Blaster Master, except in 16-bit graphics. Jason could get powerups such as homing missile, three-way missiles, bubble shield, and lightning spread.  Overhead view  Overhead view of SOPHIAIn the overhead view, S.O.P.H.I.A. can not use upgrades, but instead could rotate the turret 360 degrees while the player runs through obstacles and gunfire. S.O.P.H.I.A. rotates her turret differently than when in the sidescroll view. A tap of the B and C buttons on the Genesis controller will rotate left and right.  Jason view  Large view of JasonDuring the course of the game, Jason could enter several rooms, one of which may contain a mini-boss (such as a giant bee or worm) that he must fight in order to gain a powerup or key that will let him enter the next stage. Sometimes these mini-bosses will give Jason or S.O.P.H.I.A. a powerup that enhances their abilities. For example, Jason can get a jetpack, or missile launcher. S.O.P.H.I.A. can get a hover module, or a drill that can break through stone.  Reviews  Electronic Gaming Monthly scored the game 7 out of 10. Their four reviewers were divided about the game; one hailed it as having \\"better graphics, better sounds, and better play\\" than the original Blaster Master, one expressed disappointment over the removal of some of the original's power- ups but judged it an overall solid sequel, and the remaining two felt the game to be merely average.

The district was stipulated by the Reconstruction Acts during the Reconstruction period following the American Civil War. It only included Virginia, and was the smallest of the five military districts in terms of size. The district was successively commanded by Brigadier General John Schofield (1867‚Äì1868), Colonel George Stoneman (1868‚Äì1869) and Brigadier General Edward Canby (1869‚Äì1870).Virginia Military Governors during Reconstruction  Creation of The First Military District  In March 1867, Radical Republicans in Congress became frustrated with President Andrew Johnson's Reconstruction policies, which, they believed, allowed too many former Confederate officials to hold public office in the South. Politically empowered former Confederates would obstruct the civil rights of newly freed African Americans. For Republicans these rights, which would allow the antebellum ideology of abolition to translate to real freedom, were critical. In response, Congressional Republicans passed a multitude of bills furthering strict Reconstruction policies known as the Reconstruction Acts, the most important of which being the Act to Provide for the More Efficient Government of the Rebel States. This act, passed on March 2, 1867, divided the former Confederate States (except for Tennessee, after it ratified the 14th Amendment) into five separate military districts. The Reconstruction Acts required that each former Confederate state hold a Constitutional Convention, adopt a new State Constitution, and ratify the 14th Amendment before rejoining the Union. The act designated Virginia as The First Military District (also referred to as Military District No. 1). Each of these districts fell under the command of former Union Army general officers to supervise the replacement undesirable former Confederate officials and use military force to guarantee the safety of liberated African Americans and maintain peace. However, it soon became apparent that the appointed army commanders could only act as peacekeepers until the president unveiled a proper Reconstruction policy. The military governors supervising Military District No. 1 were Major General Schofield, Major General Stoneman, and finally Brigadier General Canby until Virginia rejoined the Union in January 1870, which officially ended Reconstruction in Virginia.  Under military rule  Major General Schofield  Under General Schofield  President Johnson first appointed General John Schofield as the first military governor of the district. Schofield commanded the Federal Army of the Ohio and had served with General Sherman during the last year of the war. Schofield sympathized with Virginia's social and economic leaders and was skeptical of radical proposals to allow African Americans, most of whom had little or no education, to vote or participate in politics. However, he duly issued orders to register eligible white and black men and make certain that the election was properly conducted. Under his command, African American men participated willingly in Virginia's General Assembly election in 1867. Cavalry General Stoneman  Under General Stoneman  Major General Canby After Schofield became secretary of war under Johnson early in June 1868, his deputy commander in Virginia, George Stoneman, succeeded him. Unlike his predecessor, Stoneman pushed back against the Reconstruction efforts enacted by Congressional Republicans. Aligning himself with the Democratic Party, Stoneman pursued more moderate policies than the other Military Governors, which garnered him support among white Virginians.  Under General Canby  Major General Edward Canby was assigned to the First Military District in April 1869, serving until September 1870. This assignment put Canby at the center of conflicts between Republicans and Democrats, whites and blacks, and state and federal governments. His role as Military Governor was concluded after Virginia ratified the 13th, 14th, and 15th Amendments to the U.S. Constitution. It was under Canby's term that a committee of nine leading Conservative politicians, under the chairmanship of Alexander H. H. Stuart, negotiated a compromise allowing voters to ratify the new state constitution. Once moderate Republicans and Conservatives dominated the Virginian General Assembly after its election in 1869, the 14th and 15th Amendments were ratified shortly after. Virginia was readmitted into the union in January 1869, thus ending Reconstruction in the state and Canby's tenure.  Legacy of Military Rule = Immediate aftermath  Ku Klux Klan, who worked to resist African American civil rights and restore Confederate ideologies. The period of military government in Virginia preserved for African Americans some of their hard-won guarantees of citizenship. However, the degradation of these rights occurred shortly after the end of military rule. With its readmission to the Union, the district commanders relinquished their powers under the Reconstruction Acts to the civil authorities within their commands. Therefore, Conservative Party candidates regained dominance over state legislature, and returned Virginia to control of prewar leaders.  Impact on African Americans  Luther Jackson's Negro Office Holders in Virginia, 1865‚Äì1895 During the time after military rule, African Americans merely gained minority status in the constitutional convention, in either house of the General Assembly, or in city or county government offices. However, the Constitutional right for African Americans to vote was firmly established under military rule, which lead to the election of more than twenty African Americans to Virginia's General Assembly between 1870 and 1875. While many of these African American political leaders following the end of military rule were somewhat wealthier and had more education than other African Americans, they faced many of the same difficulties and obstacles as the men who were born into slavery. They worked in jobs similar to other freedmen, such as mechanics, farmers, and ministers. However, these first African American political leaders in Virginia used the guarantee of suffrage in the 15th Amendment to their full advantage and paved the path for future leaders and further struggles for equal rights to follow in their footsteps.

The game was released in North America on October 31, 1998 and was re-released for the Sony Greatest Hits line-up in 1999. It is the first installment not to be released in the PAL regions. Twisted Metal III is third in the Twisted Metal series and the first to be fully developed by 989 Studios. The game's plot is centered on the titular competition in which various drivers in modified vehicles must destroy the other vehicles in an attempt to be the last one alive. The winner meets the organizer of the competition, a mysterious man named Calypso, who will grant the winner a single wish, regardless of price, size or even reality. Twisted Metal III received generally mixed reviews from critics, who criticized the game's level design and physics engine but commented positively on the multiplayer gameplay and soundtrack by Rob Zombie and Pitchshifter. However, the game was commercially successful, selling 1.14 million copies in the United States alone. Gameplay An example of gameplay in Twisted Metal III featuring Spectre in the North Pole stage Twisted Metal III is a vehicular combat game in which the player takes control of one of twelve unique vehicles. While in control of a vehicle, the player can accelerate, steer, brake, reverse, activate the turbo, turn tightly, toggle between and activate weapons using the game controller's d-pad, analog sticks and buttons. The game can be played in either the one-player \\"Tournament\\" mode or the multi-player \\"Deathmatch\\" mode. The Tournament mode consists of an eight-level game. The goal of each level is to destroy all of the opponent vehicles. The enemy vehicles are automatically chosen and their skill increases with each level that is successfully passed. The Tournament continues until all of the player's lives have expired or all levels have been completed. The player has the option to play with a computer-assisted ally to aid in destroying their opponents. However, the ending cinematics will not be viewable if a computer- controlled ally is used. If a computer-controlled ally is used, the player has the option to share their total number of lives with the ally. When either player loses a life, the collective number of lives decreases. The Deathmatch mode is a one-to-four-player game in which the player fights head-to-head with other players, though computer-controlled enemy cars can also be incorporated. The Deathmatch ends when one player successfully destroys all other player vehicles, after which the match resets for another battle. Depending on the level selected, the player may select up to seven enemy cars to compete in the match. The player begins the Tournament mode of the game with three lives. The total number of lives remaining is indicated in the lower left-hand display with the player's health bar, speedometer and turbo. The health bar indicates how much health the player's vehicle has remaining. The length of each of the player's lives is tied to their health bar, which decreases whenever the player's vehicle is damaged by enemy attacks. When the health meter fully depletes, the player loses a life. The player can gain additional health by picking up health icons scattered throughout the environment. If the last life is lost, the game ends prematurely. Weapons play a key role in winning the game. All vehicles come with a pair of mounted machine guns. They are weak in power, but have unlimited ammunition. Additional weapons scattered throughout the environments can be picked up and utilized if the player drives through them. These weapons include a variety of missiles, bombs, napalm and mortars. Each vehicle can execute three categories of attacks: \\"Special Weapon Attacks\\", \\"Advanced Attacks\\" and \\"Combo Attacks\\". Special Weapon Attacks are unique to each vehicle and are unlimited in stock, but need time to recharge if used repeatedly. Advanced Attacks allow the player to attack enemies when the player is out of weapons, but they can only be used if the Advanced Attack Energy Bar on the lower-right corner of the screen is fully charged. Most Advanced Attacks require three or four buttons sequences to initiate. Combo Attacks combine Advanced Attacks and maneuvers with weapon pick-ups. Combo Attacks can also be performed with a vehicle's special weapon. Due to the open-environment nature of Twisted Metal III, there are numerous possible combos and strategies to invent and discover. Plot=Setting Twisted Metal 3 takes place in the year 2008, two years after Twisted Metal 2. The interactive environments of Twisted Metal III allow the player to roam the battlefields with few restrictions. The first level takes place in Hollywood, which was devastated by the \\"Great Earthquake of 2007\\". The second level, along with the Darkside boss fight, takes place in Washington, D.C. in front of the United States Capitol. The third level takes place in Area 51's Hangar 18, which houses a large spacecraft that can be accessed. The fourth level takes place in the North Pole near Santa Claus' workshop. The fifth level, along with the Minion boss fight, takes place in London, in which the clock tower that houses Big Ben can be destroyed. The sixth level takes place on the rooftops of T≈çky≈ç Metropolis, while the seventh level takes place in Egypt near the Great Sphinx of Giza. The eighth and final level, along with the Primeval boss fight, takes place in Calypso's personal blimp, in which defeated opponents continuously regenerate until the player destroys a regenerating device hidden in the level. Reception Twisted Metal III received generally mixed reviews from critics, with an aggregate score of 48.97% on GameRankings. Kevin Dick of Game Revolution criticized the \\"uninspired\\" level design, \\"confusing\\" physics engine and \\"grainy\\" graphics, but commented positively on the various multiplayer options and soundtrack by Rob Zombie. Joe Fielder of GameSpot, while admitting the soundtrack by Rob Zombie and Pitchshifter was \\"fitting\\", also criticized the \\"lackluster\\" level design and \\"strange\\" physics engine, advising readers to investigate Activision's Vigilante 8 or GT Interactive's Rogue Trip: Vacation 2012 instead. Doug Perry of IGN stated that \\"with the exception of the four-player combat and Rob Zombie's hard-rock soundtrack -- the two great things about the game -- Twisted Metal 3 is a middle-of-the-road game that unfortunately doesn't do anything more than the first two games. In fact, it's just plain old hat.\\" The only positive reviews came from GameFan, which gave it 87%; from GamePro, which gave it four-and-a-half stars out of five; and from Game Informer, which gave the game 8.25 out of 10 and stated that \\"Certainly Twisted Metal 3 is a worthy addition to the series, but it isn't the same car combat game you've grown to know and love. For some this is a good thing, for others the changes are unacceptable.\\" Despite the mixed critical reception, Twisted Metal III was commercially successful, selling 1.14 million copies in the United States alone. As a result, the game was rereleased for the Sony Greatest Hits line-up in 1999. Next Generation reviewed the game, assigning a rating of one star out of five, and stated that \\"There's nothing to Twisted Metal III but the same drive-and-shoot action from level to level with no payoff to keep your interest.\\" See also * List of Sony Greatest Hits games * List of best-selling PlayStation video games References External links  * Category:1998 video games Category:English-language-only video games Category:PlayStation (console)-only games Category:North America- exclusive video games Category:Twisted Metal Category:Vehicular combat games Category:Video games developed in the United States Category:Video games set in 2008 Category:Video games set in the Arctic Category:Video games set in Egypt Category:Video games set in London Category:Video games set in Los Angeles Category:Video games set in Tokyo Category:Video games set in Washington, D.C.

At various times, the district was commanded by generals Edward Ord, Alvan Cullem Gillem, and Adelbert Ames. Following the completion of the Civil War, the Federal government under President of the United States Andrew Johnson sought to restore order within the states that had composed the defeated Confederate States of America. Johnson, a loyal Tennesseean, advocated a lenient strategy to remove all commercial and social restrictions between the states, with the intention for the South to return to its former position in the Union. He believed that former Confederates should receive amnesty for their actions during the war and regain full rights of citizenship. However, the Radical Republicans in Congress vehemently disagreed, and passed the 1866 Reconstruction Acts, which divided the former Confederacy into military districts, in which a military commander controlled all social, economic, and political activity in the region. The Fourth Military District comprised the states of Mississippi and Arkansas, with its headquarters in Vicksburg. Edward Ord served as the district's first commander, with Alvan C. Gillem, like Johnson a loyal Tennessean, in charge of the sub-district of Mississippi. Gillem was later appointed as the district's commander. He favored the policy of leniency towards the former Confederates, invoking the displeasure of the Radicals in Congress. When Ulysses S. Grant became president, he removed Gillem from command and reassigned him to Texas, replacing him again with Ord, a personal friend who had served under Grant during the Civil War. When Ord was later assigned command of the District of California, another former Civil War general, Adelbert Ames, assumed command in 1868, and was also named as Governor of Mississippi, replacing former Confederate general Benjamin G. Humphreys. When Mississippi was readmitted to the Union in 1870, the Fourth Military District was abolished and control of the state reverted to the newly elected state government.

Background Born in 1661, Henry Hall is the oldest-known member of the Hall Family of lighthouse keepers that kept lights around the English and Welsh coasts from at least the mid-eighteenth century until 1913. The Hall family intermarried with two lighthouse keeping families: the Knotts and the Darling family. One of the better known members of Darling family was Grace Darling, who participated in the rescue of survivors of the Forfarshire. Eddystone Lighthouse fire Hall is remembered for his actions following a fire at the Eddystone Lighthouse on 2 December 1755, when the wooden Rudyerd's Tower of 1706 burned down. At around 2 a.m., Hall was on duty alone when he discovered that a spark from the lamp had set the roof alight. He attempted to put the fire out by throwing buckets of water \\"four yards higher than his head\\". Hall was soon joined by the other two lighthouse keepers who also tried to extinguish the fire. Hall looked up to check his progress and was showered with falling molten lead from the lighthouse roof. The lead fell upon his body burning his head, face, neck and shoulders. As his mouth was open, molten lead fell down his throat. Hall later recalled that he felt the hot lead go down his throat and screamed, \\"My God, I'm on fire inside!\\" Hall continued to help his fellow lighthouse keepers but the three were unable to put the fire out. The men were forced to retreat down the tower and eventually made their way to a cave to avoid the falling red hot debris. The lighthouse continued to burn into the morning and would continue to burn for the next five days. At around 10 a.m., the three men were spotted by a passing boat. Due to rough surf, the sailors were unable to dock near the cave. The sailors threw a rope to Hall and his companions who tied them around their waists and were pulled through the water to the boat. They were taken to East Stonehouse, Plymouth where Hall was treated by Dr. Henry Spry (a surgeon at Plymouth) who tended to the man's burns and other injuries. Hall spoke to Dr. Spry \\"with a hoarse voice, scarce to be heard, that melted lead had run down his throat into his body\\" and was experiencing severe internal pain. Dr. Spry found Hall's claim unbelievable as he felt no person could survive having swallowed molten lead let alone live for hours afterward and be towed through water. Dr. Spry also noted that Hall was not exhibiting any other symptoms and reasoned that the trauma of the accident and Hall's advanced age were causing him to make wild claims. Dr. Spry later noted in a report sent on 19 December 1755 to the Royal Society in London that Henry Hall was \\"aged 94 years, of good constitution, and extremely active for one of that age\\". Death In the days following the fire, Hall was able to eat, drink and swallow medicine. He continued to tell Dr. Spry of the lead in his stomach and also told a friend who visited him. Hall seemed to be on the mend but by the sixth day, Dr. Spry observed that Hall's condition was declining. By the tenth and eleventh days, Hall could no longer eat or drink and began to rapidly worsen. He died on Monday, 8 December 1755, aged 94, at his home in East Stonehouse, Plymouth after \\"being seized with cold sweats and spasms of the tendons, he soon expired\\".Zoist 1854 p.249 Dr. Spry conducted an autopsy on Hall noting that, \\"left side of his body, below the short ribs, in the breast, mouth and throat ... left side of the head and face, with the eye extremely burnt\\". The autopsy revealed that \\"the diaphragmatic upper mouth of the stomach greatly inflamed and ulcerated, and the tuncia in the lower part of the stomach burnt; and from the great cavity of it took out a great piece of lead ... which weighed exactly seven ounces, five drachams and eighteen grains\\". Dr. Spry gave the following written account of how Hall and his two colleagues had explained to him how the lead came to be in Hall's stomach: \\"It will perhaps be thought difficult to explain the manner, by which the lead entered the stomach: But the account, which the deceased gave me and others, was, that as he was endeavouring to extinguish the flames, which were at a considerable height over his head, the lead of the lanthorn being melted dropped down, before he was aware of it, with great force into his mouth then lifted up and open, and in such a quantity, as to cover not only his face, but all his clothes.\\" Dr. Spry's account was received with such scepticism by The Royal Society that he felt constrained to conduct experiments on dogs and chickens, pouring melted lead down the animals' throats, to prove that it was possible to survive, for at least a limited period, such an extreme accident. These are the first fully documented and reported British scientific experiments on live animals. Legacy There is a small plaque dedicated to Henry Hall with a few details as to the nature of this death located in Plymouth city centre, set into the pavement between Plymouth Pavilions, the Sippers pub and The Duke of Cornwall Hotel, Millbay Road. The piece of lead found in Henry Hall's stomach is now kept in the National Museum of Scotland.

He also co-founded Chesapeake Energy, serving as its CEO and chairman. He was an outspoken advocate for natural gas as an alternative to oil and coal fuels, and a pioneer in employing fracking. McClendon was a part- owner of the National Basketball Association (NBA)'s Oklahoma City Thunder franchise, and was part of the ownership group that moved the Seattle SuperSonics to Oklahoma City in 2008. On March 1, 2016, McClendon was indicted by a federal grand jury on charges of conspiring \\"to rig bids for the purchase of oil and natural gas leases in northwest Oklahoma\\".David McLaughlin, \\"Chesapeake Co-Founder McClendon Indicted Over Lease Bid Rigging\\", Bloomberg News (March 1, 2016). He died the following day, March 2, 2016, in a single- vehicle collision. Early life and education McClendon was born July 14, 1959, in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, the son of Carole Kerr and Joe Connor McClendon. He was the great-nephew of Robert S. Kerr, a governor of Oklahoma and U.S. senator from the state. He spent his childhood in Belle Isle, a neighborhood in Oklahoma City, and attended Belle Isle Elementary School, a public school. He graduated from Heritage Hall School in 1977 as senior class president and co-valedictorian. As a teenager, he started a lawn mowing business, through which he had an early encounter with Shannon Self, who later became a founding board member of Chesapeake Energy Corporation. McClendon graduated from Duke University in 1981 with a B.A. in history. His favorite area of study was the post-Civil War Reconstruction Era. He minored in accounting and was a member of Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity. He also met his wife, the former Kathleen Upton Byrns, while at Duke. His first job after Duke was as an accountant. He was inspired to move from accounting to the energy business after reading an article in The Wall Street Journal about two men selling their Anadarko Basin well stake for $100 million. He worked as a landman at Jaytex Oil and Gas, a public company in Oklahoma City founded by his uncle, Aubrey M. Kerr, Jr. McClendon left Jaytex in November 1982 to pursue his own business in the oil and natural gas industry. Business career=Chesapeake Energy Corporation The Chesapeake Energy Building in Fort Worth, Texas, from 2008 to 2014, now the Pier 1 Imports Building. In 1983, McClendon and Tom L. Ward \\"threw in together\\" in their initial venture into oil and natural gas. Together, they co-founded Chesapeake Energy Corporation in 1989. McClendon and Ward were both 29 at the time. McClendon began as chairman and chief executive officer of Chesapeake, while Ward served as president and chief financial officer. The company began drilling its first two wells in Garvin County, Oklahoma, in May 1989. With Chesapeake, McClendon focused on drilling wells into unconventional reservoirs such as fractured carbonates and shales and was an early adopter of horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing techniques, which helped accelerate the company's fast early growth. His focus on these new and unconventional techniques later led to him being called a \\"visionary leader\\" in the oil and natural gas industry. He took the firm public in 1993, and in the following three years its stock was the most successful in the country, rising 274% in value from 1994 to 1997, according to The Wall Street Journal. In 2005, Forbes Magazine named McClendon one of the country's top-performing executives for his role at Chesapeake. A few years later, he was the highest paid CEO of all the S&P; 500 companies in 2008, receiving a compensation package totaling $112 million. In 2008, McClendon was notified that his shares were no longer valuable enough to back a margin loan with Goldman Sachs and other banks. In response, McClendon was forced to sell a majority of his 31.5 million shares, comprising 94% of his stake in Chesapeake and 6% of the company. The following year, Chesapeake offered McClendon a five-year retention contract, including a $75 million bonus. In 2011, Forbes called McClendon \\"America's most reckless billionaire\\" in a cover story on his career. The profile noted his high risk tolerance and cited the sale of his shares in 2008 as a reckless move. The same year, the magazine named McClendon to its 20-20 Club, comprising the eight CEOs of public companies who had delivered annualized returns of more than 20% over a 20-year period. McClendon dismissed those who described him as a risk-loving wildcatter. \\"If I wanted to always do the most popular thing, then I'd be a follower,\\" he said in 2012. \\"The funny thing is that I don't consider myself a gambler at all. A gambler is somebody who just closes their eyes and rolls the dice. We don't do that\\". Chesapeake continued to grow its gas production under McClendon from 5 million to 2.5 billion cubic feet per day from 2009 to 2013. Chesapeake's discovery of large reserves of natural gas was reported to have helped reduce natural gas prices to consumers in the U.S. In a 2012 opinion piece discussing the development of the domestic oil and natural gas industry of the U.S. in the first decade of the 21st century, the former United States Secretary of Energy and Houston mayor Bill White described McClendon as \\"at the forefront of those heroes\\" of the American natural gas industry.Bill White, \\"Thanks due to McClendon, Chesapeake employees\\", The Oklahoman, May 26, 2012. According to allegations reported in Reuters in April 2012, McClendon took out more than $1 billion in personal loans, to finance drilling costs, from firms that were lenders to Chesapeake. This raised the potential for conflicts of interest and prompted questions on the corporate governance and business ethics of Chesapeake's senior management. On February 20, 2013, Dow Jones reported that a Chesapeake board review found no improper conduct, no improper benefit to McClendon and no increased cost to the company. On June 7, 2012, Reuters alleged that McClendon had used Chesapeake employees to perform $3 million of personal work, including engineering and accounting support and the repair of his house, in 2010. He had also used corporate planes for non- business-related travel for the McClendons' family and friends. According to Chesapeake's proxy statement filed with the SEC on May 11, 2012, McClendon reimbursed the company for all but $250,000 of the employee costs. His employment agreement authorized the personal use of company aircraft by McClendon, his immediate family members and guests, \\"for safety, security and efficiency\\" reasons. In June 2012, Chesapeake shareholders voted to reject two board members and approve increased proxy access. McClendon relinquished his chairman title in June 2012, remaining in his role as CEO. McClendon stepped down from his position as CEO at Chesapeake on April 1, 2013. At the time, the company was estimated to be the second largest producer of natural gas in the United States, following only ExxonMobil. Since 1992, through an initiative called the Founder Well Participation Program (FWPP), McClendon was allowed to invest in wells drilled by Chesapeake. The FWPP was first formalized and incorporated into the founders' employment agreements in connection with Chesapeake's IPO in February 1993. Following his departure from the company, McClendon retained the option to continue investing in Chesapeake wells through July 2014. In February 2015, Chesapeake filed a lawsuit against McClendon, accusing him of misappropriating company data on available land during his departure. McClendon and American Energy Partners responded that he had the right to all information in his possession under his various separation agreements with Chesapeake. In April 2015, American Energy ‚Äì Utica, LLC reached a settlement with Chesapeake, giving them of land and $25 million. As of April 2015, McClendon had been in arbitration with Chesapeake regarding the lawsuit against him. American Energy Partners, LP On April 2, 2013, McClendon founded American Energy Partners, LP (AELP), a private oil and natural gas company based in Oklahoma City. During 2013 and 2014, McClendon hired more than 600 employees and raised equity and debt commitments of approximately $15 billion. AELP is an oil and natural gas company comprising several affiliated companies, including American Energy Utica LLC and American Energy Marcellus LLC, American Energy ‚Äì Permian Basin, LLC, American Energy ‚Äì Woodford, LLC, American Energy ‚Äì NonOp, LLC, American Energy ‚Äì Minerals, LLC, and American Energy ‚Äì Midstream, LLC. Natural gas advocacy McClendon was a founding member of America's Natural Gas Alliance (ANGA), a trade association and lobbying group for independent natural gas producers, based in Washington, D.C. He was an advocate for the greater use of natural gas in the United States and he funded a campaign in 2007 to draw clean-energy activists' attention to a Texas utility's plan to build 11 new coal plants. He also made a donation to the Sierra Club to fund its \\"Beyond Coal\\" campaign, which had blocked more than 150 new coal plants in the United States, as of October 2013. McClendon was a public proponent of natural gas, fracking and shale drilling throughout his career. In an appearance on 60 Minutes in 2010, McClendon argued a case for natural gas as a clean fuel and a significant job- creating industry. He defended the natural gas and oil industry's use of hydraulic fracturing techniques for well completion. Later that year, he was quoted saying, \\"We have found something that can liberate us from the influence of OPEC, that can put several million Americans back to work, liberate us from four-dollar gasoline.\\" Federal indictment for violating antitrust laws On March 1, 2016, a federal grand jury indicted McClendon for violating antitrust laws, with conspiring to suppress prices paid for oil and natural gas leases by allegedly rigging the bidding process.\\"Aubrey McClendon, Ex-Head of Chesapeake Energy, Is Charged With Conspiracy\\", March 1, 2016. Krauss, Clifford. The New York Times. Retrieved March 3, 2016. The indictment says he orchestrated a conspiracy in which two oil and gas companies colluded not to bid against each other for the purchase of leases in northwestern Oklahoma. The conspiracy he is suspected of was orchestrating a scheme between two large energy companies, which are not named in the indictment, that was conducted from December 2007 through March 2012. According to the indictment, the companies would decide ahead of time who would win bids, with the winner then allocating an interest in the leases to the other company, eliminating open competitive bidding with landowners. One of the unnamed companies in the indictment turned out to be SandRidge Energy, Inc. according to Bloomberg News. The United States Justice Department said this was the first case resulting from a continuing federal antitrust investigation into price fixing, bid rigging and other anticompetitive conduct in the oil and natural gas industry. In 2015, Chesapeake Energy settled charges of antitrust, fraud, and racketeering violations out of court, by agreeing to pay $25 million as compensation to landowners with leases. After his indictment McClendon released a statement denying all charges, arguing that for 35 years he has worked to create jobs and help Oklahoma's economy while providing plentiful energy for the entire country. \\"The charge that has been filed against me today is wrong and unprecedented, I have been singled out as the only person in the oil and gas industry in over 110 years since the Sherman Act became law to have been accused of this crime in relation to joint bidding on leasehold.\\" William Baer, then Assistant Attorney General of the United States Justice Department Antitrust Division in the Obama administration, said \\"His actions put company profits ahead of the interests of leaseholders entitled to competitive bids for oil and gas rights on their land. Executives who abuse their positions as leaders of major corporations to organize criminal activity must be held accountable for their actions.\\" McClendon maintained his innocence, but died the next day, March 2, 2016, in a single-occupant single-vehicle crash when he drove his SUV at 88 mph into a concrete bridge embankment. McClendon's body was badly burned, making identification difficult. A forensic odontologist was brought in, and positively identified McClendon by his teeth on March 4, 2016. The medical examiner's office reported McClendon died from multiple blunt force trauma. On March 3, 2016, less than 48 hours after McClendon was charged, the Justice Department filed motions and dismissed McClendon's indictment. On June 8, 2016, the Oklahoma medical examiner officially ruled the crash which killed shale pioneer McClendon was an accident. According to the autopsy report, no alcohol was involved in the accident, but an unspecified amount of the over the counter first-generation antihistamine and short-term sedative drug Doxylamine (which is used as an antihistamine or to treat insomnia) was found in Mr. McClendon's system. Business ventures and investments McClendon held a stake in various food service companies and restaurants, including Jamba Juice. He also held stakes in several Oklahoma City restaurants, including Irma's Burger Shack, Deep Fork Grill, The Coach House, Republic Gastro Pub, Metro Wine Bistro & Bar, Provision Kitchen and Pops. McClendon opened Pops, a burgers and soda restaurant on the historic Route 66 highway in Arcadia, Oklahoma, in 2007. From 2004 to 2008, McClendon ran a $200 million hedge fund, Heritage Management Company LLC, with Tom Ward. He invested $35 million in ProCure Treatment Centers Inc., a company with three proton-therapy based cancer treatment centers, in 2008. From 2004 to 2006, McClendon bought almost of mostly undeveloped dunes on the east coast of Lake Michigan and the Kalamazoo River for $39.5 million. He had previously secured a half-interest on the land in 2004. In 2006, the five-member Township Board representing Saugatuck, Michigan voted unanimously to rezone the land, making development more difficult. The Township Board supported the views of local citizens and the Saugatuck Dunes Coastal Alliance, who argued that McClendon's plans for development would irrevocably damage the property. He continued with the land purchase, and in 2007, his legal team began discussions of scaling back the legal restrictions on the land with township officials. In 2009, McClendon sold of the land to the Western Michigan Land Conservancy. In December 2010, McClendon filed a federal lawsuit attempting to overturn the zoning laws and a settlement was reached in 2012 which voided Saugatuck's 2006 rezoning. From 2008 to 2013, McClendon was one of the U.S.'s largest landowners, owning more than . Oklahoma City Thunder The Chesapeake Energy Arena, home of the Oklahoma City Thunder. McClendon was an original member of the Professional Basketball Club LLC, which owns the National Basketball Association (NBA)'s Oklahoma City Thunder franchise. He was a part of the team that moved the Seattle SuperSonics to Oklahoma City in 2008, where they were renamed the Oklahoma City Thunder. At the time the team moved, McClendon owned 20 percent of the franchise. Prior to the move, in 2007, McClendon was quoted in The Journal Record (an Oklahoma City newspaper) as saying \\"we (the ownership group) didn't buy the Seattle SuperSonics to keep them in Seattle\\". The NBA fined McClendon $250,000 in response, as his statement contradicted the organization's publicized intentions at the time. In April 2014, he purchased more shares in the Oklahoma City Thunder franchise from G. Jeffrey Records Jr. Philanthropy and community involvement McClendon made sizable donations to and served on the board of directors for many municipal and private organizations in Oklahoma City, including the Boathouse District and Boathouse Foundation, The McClendon Family Boys and Girls Club of OKC, the Oklahoma City Chamber of Commerce, Oklahoma State Fair and Oklahoma City Public Schools. He donated to Oklahoma City arts organizations, including the Lyric Theatre, Oklahoma City Ballet, Oklahoma Museum of Art, Arts Council of Oklahoma City, the Oklahoma Heritage Foundation and the Oklahoma City Philharmonic. From 2011 on, McClendon hosted an annual event for local Boy Scouts at his Arcadia Farm property. He donated approximately $15 million to Duke University and $12.5 million to the University of Oklahoma. Honors and awards McClendon was inducted into the Oklahoma Heritage Foundation's Oklahoma Hall of Fame in 2007, and in 2009, he was a top finalist for CEO of the Year at the Platts Global Energy Awards. In 2010, U.S. Steel Tubular Products, Inc., a subsidiary of United States Steel Corporation, gave McClendon the Chief Roughneck Award, which honors the lifetime achievements of petroleum industry leaders. In 2011, he was awarded the Ernst & Young National Entrepreneur of the Year in Energy, Cleantech and Natural Resources. In 2013, the Heritage Hall Alumni Association named McClendon, who graduated in 1977, the recipient of its Distinguished Alumni Award. Personal life and interests McClendon lived in Oklahoma City with his wife, the former Kathleen Upton Byrns. They have three adult children named Jack, Callie, and Will. By his wife, he was related to Sports Illustrated supermodel Kate Upton. McClendon's personal wine collection was estimated at one time to include more than 100,000 bottles. He also held an extensive collection of antique maps of Oklahoma and had collected a number of vintage motor boats. McClendon, an Episcopalian, would sometimes quote scripture in workplace emails. He also employed chaplains while heading Chesapeake. Death McClendon died in a solo-occupant, single-vehicle crash at 9:12 a.m. on March 2, 2016. According to police reports, he died instantly when his 2013 Chevrolet Tahoe SUV traveled over the speed limit and crashed into a concrete viaduct under a bridge on Midwest Boulevard in Oklahoma City. Background The event occurred one day after McClendon's indictment by a federal grand jury accusing him of violating antitrust laws from 2007 to 2012 while the CEO of Chesapeake Energy. A spokesman for the U.S. Attorney in Oklahoma City disputed initial reports that McClendon was en route to the courthouse when the crash occurred. The spokesman said no arraignments or meetings were scheduled with McClendon on the day of his car accident. Discussion and Investigation Oklahoma City Police spokesman Paco Balderrama said of McClendon's actions, \\"He pretty much drove straight into the wall. The information out there at the scene is that he went left of center, went through a grassy area right before colliding into the embankment. There was plenty of opportunity for him to correct and get back on the roadway, and that didn't occur.\\" On June 9 the medical examiner classified the death as an accident. On the day of the incident, local police indicated that it was too early to determine if the collision was intentional or if McClendon may have suffered a medical emergency. He was not wearing a seat belt at the time of the crash but this was not unusual.https://www.reuters.com/article/us-aubrey-mcclendon-specialreport- idUSKCN0WD27N Two weeks later, Oklahoma City investigators announced that the collision occurred at , later ruled 88 mph with no evidence of a health emergency, although several additional weeks would be required for toxicology tests and an official cause of death. Two months later, with the medical examiner's final report still pending, Balderrama announced that the police investigation found no evidence of suicide, including no emails or messages implying this, but neither could it be ruled out: \\"Had he slept at all? It's very possible he suffered a medical event... We may never know one-hundred percent what happened.\\" The medical examiner classified the death as an accident. McClendon was regarded as a very optimistic person by several people who knew him well.https://www.wsj.com/articles/police-probe-finds-nothing-to- suggest-aubrey-mcclendon-committed-suicide-1465333448 ReferencesExternal links *American Energy Partners *Federal indictment for violating antitrust laws (2016) Category:American energy industry executives Category:Businesspeople from Oklahoma City Category:1959 births Category:2016 deaths Category:American chief executives Category:American billionaires Category:Duke University Trinity College of Arts and Sciences alumni Category:Oklahoma City Thunder owners Category:Road incident deaths in Oklahoma Category:20th-century American businesspeople Category:21st-century American businesspeople Category:American Episcopalians ","title":"Aubrey McClendon"},{"id":"4427464","text":"A bayamo is a violent wind blowing from the land on the south coast of Cuba, especially near the Bight of Bayamo.

He also played in the Football League for Queens Park Rangers, Gillingham, Bournemouth and Charlton Athletic. He then worked in the media as a pundit, and in September 2008 relocated to Canada to study theology with a view to becoming a Christian minister. Early life Peacock comes from a footballing family, his father Keith played for Charlton. Though Peacock followed Charlton Athletic as a child, he maintained a soft spot for Newcastle United. His father's side of the family are from North East England, they followed Newcastle United and Peacock in his youth owned Newcastle replica shirts; he also regularly visited South Shields on the Peacock family holidays. Peacock lived in Crayford in the London Borough of Bexley, and attended Bexley Grammar School in nearby Welling as a child. He played schoolboy international football for England. Playing career Peacock started his career at Queens Park Rangers, making 17 appearances in the First Division and scoring once before he moved to Third Division Gillingham in 1987 in a move which was started by his father, Keith, Gillingham's manager. Shortly after joining, his father was sacked by the club but Gavin remained on as a player until after their relegation to the Fourth Division in 1989. He was signed by Harry Redknapp for Bournemouth in a ¬£250,000 deal on 16 August 1989, but was unable to prevent their relegation to the Third Division that season. He began the 1990-91 season still at Bournemouth, but on 30 November 1990 he made the move back to the Second Division when Jim Smith paid Bournemouth ¬£275,000 to take Peacock to Newcastle United. Peacock himself was not the first in the family to be on the books of Newcastle, his father's cousin was at Newcastle United in the 1950s, though he did not make a first team debut. Peacock stated that his family lineage and connection to the North East was a big draw in him signing for Newcastle United when the opportunity came up with an offer from Jim Smith, the then manager of Newcastle. The Magpies were in the Second Division at the time and were founder members of the new Division One on the creation of the new FA Premier League in 1992, and in the 1992‚Äì93 season he helped them win the Division One title. His goalscoring record for the Magpies was impressive, as their top scorer in 1991-92 with 16 goals and one of their best scorers in the promotion season with 12 goals. He was sold to Chelsea for ¬£1.5million soon afterwards, being one of new player-manager Glenn Hoddle's first signings for the Stamford Bridge side. Peacock famously scored both home and away for Chelsea in 1‚Äì0 victories over Manchester United in the 1993‚Äì94 season. Both sides met again in the FA Cup Final, and with the score at 0‚Äì0 just before half time, Peacock hit the crossbar from 25 yards and missed a golden opportunity to gain silverware. Manchester United went on to win the final 4-0 and achieve the double. Peacock finished joint top scorer that season with an impressive 14 goals from midfield. He helped them reach the semi-finals of the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup in 1995 and the FA Cup semi finals in 1996. Peacock returned to Queens Park Rangers in 1996, having lost his place in the Chelsea team to new signing Roberto Di Matteo. He made a brief return to the Premier League in 2001 after going on loan to Charlton Athletic in 2001, where his father was now assistant manager. Peacock returned to QPR for the 2001/2 season, at the end of which he retired, having made 196 appearances in total for the club. By this stage, however, they were in Division Two. In total he scored more than 100 goals in over 540 league appearances. Media career After retiring, Peacock worked with the BBC, regularly appearing as a pundit on Football Focus, Score, Match of the Day, Match of the Day 2, BBC Radio 5 Live's comedy game show Fighting Talk and the BBC Radio 4 comedy show \\"One\\". He also hosted a weekly podcast on the official Chelsea website.NEW GAVIN PEACOCK SHOW PODCAST LIVE  Chelsea  News  Latest Newshttp://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewPodcast?id=208045854 Personal life Married to Amanda since 1989, the couple have two children: son, Jake (b. 1993), and daughter, Ava (b. 1996). They had a house in Bexley, south east London, before Peacock started his theological studies, and a small holiday home in Canada in the Rocky Mountains. He started attending the local Methodist church at the age of 18 and soon afterwards became a Christian. Near the end of his career and after he retired he began preaching in his local church St Michaels and All Angels in Wilmington. He presented a feature on Football Focus about faith in the game in December 2006. He also presented Songs of Praise on 10 February 2008, at the same time as his coverage of the Africa Cup of Nations final. Having studied theology from September 2006 at Ridley Hall, Cambridge, after completing his punditry duties at Euro 2008, he moved to Canada for a three-year masters course in divinity at Ambrose Seminary. with the intention of becoming a minister. He is currently an elder and pastor at Calvary Grace Church in Calgary. In April 2016 he co-authored The Grand Design, a book presenting a complementarian view of gender roles.

Hideyoshi, however, still maintained a very active interest in administrative matters, and it has been theorized by some scholars that the Go-Bugy≈ç, unlike the Go-Tair≈ç that replaced it, served more as a committee of specialists and advisors than a group that actually enacted policy decisions. The original five appointed were Asano Nagamasa, Maeda Gen'i, Mashita Nagamori, Natsuka Masaie, and Ishida Mitsunari. All five were samurai from ≈åmi and Owari provinces, and strong supporters of Hideyoshi's former lord, Oda Nobunaga. Maeda Gen'i, a Buddhist abbot also known as Abbot Tokuzen-in, was given the post of Shoshi-dai, or Commissioner for the Metropolitan Area (of Kyoto). As a result, he addressed a variety of religious matters, as well as acting as a judge in civil disputes. Natsuka Masaie became Commissioner of Finance, and Mashida Nagamori was assigned to Public Works. Ishida Mitsunari was made Commissioner of Police, and also governed the area of Sakai near Osaka.

It has lobed leaves, elliptic (cup-shaped) drooping flowers with dark maroon-colored petals, and many yellow anthers. It flowers mostly from January to March (or sometimes as early as December or as late as May), and later develops two to five fruits per flower. Its common name is California peony and it is sometimes also referred to as wild peony. This peony is an endemic of southwestern California (USA), where it is not rare, and northernmost Baja California (Mexico). It grows on dry hillsides in the coastal sage scrub and chaparral communities of the coastal mountains of Southern and Central California, often as an understory plant. It is sometimes considered a subspecies of the other Paeonia species native to North America, Paeonia brownii.  Description  leftThe California peony is a summer-deciduous perennial herbaceous plant of 35‚Äì75 cm high. Each shoot usually carries seven to twelve compound leaves, each primary segment is 3‚Äì9 cm long and 1‚Äì6 cm wide, and the finest divisions are linear to spade-shaped. The base of the leaflet blade narrows gradually into the leaflet stalk, which is short or may be absent. The tips of the leaflets are usually pointy, and the surface of the leaf is green and not particularly glaucous. The bisexual flowers occur at the tip of the stem and are nodding. The petals are dark red or purplish, sometimes almost black, while the margins are lighter, elliptic in shape and 1¬Ω‚Äì2¬Ω cm long, usually longer than the sepals. The numerous stamens consist of filaments of ¬Ω‚Äì¬æ cm topped by anthers of ‚Öì‚Äì‚Öî cm long, containing yellow pollen. Two to five carpels eventually develop into follicles of 3‚Äì4 cm long. The seeds are about 1¬Ω cm long, slightly curved, and have a dull, coarsely wrinkled surface. P. californica has ten chromosomes (2n=10), as all other diploid peonies. cited on  Differences with related species  The California peony is most related to, and close in appearance to Brown's peony, with which it constitutes the section Onaepia. Common characters include having rather small drooping flowers, with small petals and a very prominent disk which usually consists of separate segments, while the seeds are cylindrical rather than ovoid. It can still be easily distinguished from P. browniii however by 35‚Äì75 cm high stems bearing seven to twelve leaves which are green, while the leaflet blade gradually eases into the leaflet stalk or lacks such a stalk all together, and the finest lobes are lanceolate or narrowly elliptic. P. brownii is only 20‚Äì40 cm high, has six to eight glaucous leaves per stem that suddenly narrow at their base and the finest segments are egg-shaped. In P. californica the petals are egg-shaped, and about 1¬Ω-2¬Ω cm long, reaching beyond the sepals, while in P. brownii the petals are circular or wider than long, and about ¬æ-1¬Ω cm long, definitely shorter than the sepals.  Taxonomy  Paeonia californica was first described in 1838 by Thomas Nuttall in the Flora of North America which was edited by John Torrey and Asa Gray. Several later authors considered it a subtaxon of P. brownii: a subspecies (Abrams in 1944, and Halda in 1997) or a variety (Lynch, 1890). There are however several morphological differences, the environmental circumstances in which each grows are different and the distributions of both species do not overlap, so currently there seems to be consensus that both need to be regarded as separate species. P. brownii and P. californica together make up the section Onaepia of the genus Paeonia. Precise relationships between the three sections remain ambiguous, and can be represented by the following phylogenetic tree. cited on  Distribution  California peonies have a native distribution in southwestern California (Los Angeles, Monterey, Orange, Riverside, Santa Barbara, San Bernardino, San Diego, San Luis Obispo and Ventura Counties) and in neighboring Mexico (northern Baja California), although distribution in Mexico is poorly known. It grows on dry hillsides in the coastal sage scrub and chaparral communities of the coastal mountains of Southern and Central California, often as an understory plant between sea level and 1500 m elevation.  Cultivation  The California peony has entered limited cultivation in native plant landscaping and xeriscaping. It is drought-tolerant and is moisture sensitive in the summer, when its swollen root will rot if watered. It prefers partial sun and tolerates a variety of soil types. Deer seem to avoid eating this plant.

It was published in the United States and Canada in 2006 by Knopf, and has been translated into more than 30 languages. It is a New York Times bestseller. Theme Gilbert's central thesis is that, through perception and cognitive biases, people imagine the future poorly, in particular what will make them happy. He argues that imagination fails in three ways: # Imagination tends to add and remove details, but people do not realize that key details may be fabricated or missing from the imagined scenario. # Imagined futures (and pasts) are more like the present than they actually will be (or were). # Imagination fails to realize that things will feel different once they actually happen‚Äîmost notably, the psychological immune system will make bad things feel not so bad as they are imagined to feel. Also, Gilbert covers the topic of 'filling in' or the frequent use of patterns, by the mind, to connect events which we do actually recall with other events we expect or anticipate fit into the expected experience. This 'filling in' is also used by our eyes and optic nerves to remove our blind spot or scotoma, and instead substitute what our mind expects to be present in the blind spot. The book is written for the layperson, generally avoiding abstruse terminology and explaining common quirks of reasoning through simple experiments that exploited them. Summary Stumbling on Happiness has 6 Sections labeled Prospection, Subjectivity, Realism, Presentism, Rationalization, and Corrigibility. A summary of each follows. In the Prospection Section Gilbert contends that humans are most special because of their ability to imagine. Our large frontal lobes biologically distinguish us from other animals and the function of the frontal lobe is to help us imagine. However, our imagination often leads us astray, and the purpose of the book is to help the reader appreciate the shortcomings of imagination. The Subjectivity Section addresses the meaning of happiness and emphasizes that happiness is a subjective feeling. Gilbert says, ‚ÄúEvaluating people‚Äôs claims about their own happiness is an exceptionally thorny business.‚Äù No perfectly reliable tool exists to measure a person‚Äôs happiness. Instead researchers must rely primarily on the ‚Äúhonest, real-time report of the attentive individual‚Äù. Finally, given the imperfections in self- reported feelings of happiness, scientists must rely on the law of large numbers, namely, to ask many people the same question and compare their answers. The Realism Section explains that imagination suffers from shortcomings. The first shortcoming is a lack of accuracy or realism. Imagination relies on memory and perception, and both memory and perception are prone to omit important details and to add false details. In the Presentism Section, Gilbert addresses the second major shortcoming of imagination which is that it is biased toward the present. People project their current circumstance and values onto the future, but the future is often different enough from the present as to make such projections misleading. One phenomenon related to this problem is that wonderful experiences are most treasured on their first occurrence but typically less so on subsequent occurrences. The third and final shortcoming is presented in the Section Rationalization. People have a psychological immune system. They are prone to believe what benefits them and to disbelieve what does not benefit them. Gilbert says, ‚ÄúA healthy psychological immune system strikes a balance that allows us to feel good enough to cope with our situation but bad enough to do something about it‚Äù. Cultural values tend to be perpetuated as memes and sometimes falsify claims about what would make an individual happy. The Corrigibility Section shows that illusions of foresight are best addressed when a person trying to anticipate a future experience turns to arbitrary, other people for insight about their related experience. Recognition Reviews of the book include the following three: * The Guardian Newspaper said, ‚ÄúGilbert's book is a witty, racy and readable study of expectation, anticipation, memory and perception: all bits of scaffolding within the structure of happiness.‚Äù * The Publishers Weekly said, ‚Äúa scientific explanation of the limitations of the human imagination and how it steers us wrong in our search for happiness, ‚Ä¶ commonplace examples render a potentially academic topic accessible and educational, even if his approach is at times overly prescriptive.‚Äù * Greater Good Magazine said, ‚ÄúAlthough we imagine ourselves to be so unique as to be unable to use random people‚Äôs experience as a guide to personal fulfillment, Gilbert shows how this is actually a much better predictor of happiness than our own wishful thinking.‚Äù In 2007, the book was awarded the Royal Society Prizes for Science Books general prize for the best science writing for a non-specialist audience. As of Dec 26, 2018 on Amazon‚Äôs web site the paperback book was ranked as #34 among all books sold in the category of Consumer Behavior and had 608 reviews with an average score of 4 of a possible 5.

The bread is associated with Halloween in Ireland, where an item (often a ring) is placed inside the bread, with the person who receives it considered to be fortunate. Usually sold in flattened rounds, it is often served toasted with butter along with a cup of tea in the afternoon. The dough is sweeter than sandwich bread, but not as rich as cake, and the sultanas and raisins add flavour and texture to the final product. In Ireland it is sometimes called Bair√≠n Breac, and the term is also used as two words in its more common version. This may be from the Irish word bair√≠n - a loaf - and breac - speckled (due to the raisins in it), hence it literally means a speckled loaf (a similar etymology to the Welsh bara brith). Halloween tradition Barmbrack is the centre of an Irish Halloween custom. The Halloween Brack traditionally contained various objects baked into the bread and was used as a sort of fortune-telling game. In the barmbrack were: a pea, a stick, a piece of cloth, a small coin (originally a silver sixpence) and a ring. Each item, when received in the slice, was supposed to carry a meaning to the person concerned: the pea, the person would not marry that year; the stick, would have an unhappy marriage or continually be in disputes; the cloth or rag, would have bad luck or be poor; the coin, would enjoy good fortune or be rich; and the ring, would be wed within the year. Other articles added to the brack include a medallion, usually of the Virgin Mary to symbolize going into the priesthood or to the Nuns, although this tradition is not widely continued in the present day. Commercially produced barmbracks for the Halloween market still include a toy ring.

Beckman High School Arnold O. Beckman High School is a public school in Irvine, California, United States, serving 3,013 students from grades 9 through 12. The original $69 million facility (equivalent to $ million in ) was opened on August 30, 2004. The Humanities Building - a new, $17 million, two-story, 30,000-square-foot facility - was unveiled on September 1, 2015. The school is commonly known as Beckman and is named after Arnold Orville Beckman: a scientist, chemist, and philanthropist famed for inventing the pH scale during his tenure at Caltech. Since its founding in 2004, Beckman has been awarded the status of a California Distinguished School by the California State Board of Education in 2007, 2011, 2015, and again in 2019. Beckman primarily serves the communities of Irvine, Tustin, Santa Ana, Tustin Ranch, Northpark, Northwood, Sheridan, Orchard Hills, and West Irvine. Although its facilities are physically located in Irvine, the school is administered by Tustin Unified School District. Beckman's mascot is the Patriot. Beckman is known for strong arts, music, athletic, and academic programs. It offers more than 20 Advanced Placement courses, eight instrumental music ensembles (and as many vocal and dance programs), studio arts and video production courses, and - in partnership with Irvine Valley College - the Early College Program, which gives Beckman students the opportunity to take undergraduate courses for credit in conjunction with their normal high school curriculum. Beckman is accredited by the Western Association of Schools and Colleges (WASC) and is also a member of the National Association for College Admission Counseling (NACAC) and complies with the NACAC Statement of Principles of Good Practice. The arts=Band The 150-member Beckman High School Patriot Marching Band was formed in 2004. Since its inception, the band has grown in numbers and stature and has earned a reputation of excellence in musicianship. The group earned a first-place finish in its first parade, and since then has earned first-place finishes in 10 of the first 11 parades it has competed in. The band has participated in the Tustin Tiller Days Parade, MLK Parade in San Diego, Kingdom Day Parade in Los Angeles, the La Palma Days band review, Arcadia Band Review, the Whittier Christmas Parade, and Los Angeles County Fair. Also of note, the band has performed with the UCLA Marching Band in the Rose Bowl (2004, 2005, 2007, 2009) and the USC Marching Band in the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum (2004) and marched in parade at Disneyland (2006, 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2017). In April 2008, the Patriot Marching Band earned an invitation to perform at the 2008 National Cherry Blossom Festival Parade in Washington D.C. The band appeared in the 2010 Hollywood Santa Parade. Six sousaphone players of the marching band took part in the Rose Parade in 2011. The band performed in Sacramento and San Francisco in March 2012, and then Washington D.C. for the Cherry Blossom Parade again in 2015. It has placed first and won sweepstakes four years in a row at the annual Tustin Tiller Days Parade. 1 clarinetist became the first student from Beckman to be in the Rose Parade Honor Marching Band in 2014. Several students also have gone on to perform in international performance groups, in places like Carnegie Hall in New York, and Paris. During the school year, the marching band rehearses daily for an hour, with the only after-school rehearsals on the days of football games. The group performs for home football games and various student body events, and honors community Veterans with an annual Veterans' Day Concert. The Varsity Band, made up of select members of the Marching Band, performs at various Beckman High School boys' and girls' varsity sporting events (which have included water polo, basketball, and baseball games), therefore giving students an opportunity to earn their varsity letter in band. There is also one active chamber group that has spawned from the Wind Ensemble. The \\"Paradox 5\\" Woodwind Quintet has achieved superior ratings at the SCSBOA Los Coyotes Solo and Ensemble District Festival during April 2008 and at the SCSBOA Regional Solo and Ensemble Festival during June 2008, the latter with the \\"Command Performance\\" honor. Theatre Beckman Theatre Arts competes at various theatre festivals throughout the year. Orchestra Beckman Orchestra has three levels: Chamber, Symphonic, and Concert. Beckman's Chamber Orchestra has been invited five times, in 2005, 2007, 2009, 2011, 2013, and 2015, to attend a national music event in New York, where it has performed at Carnegie Hall. It now performs consecutively every 2 years. The orchestra has also attended many SCSBOA festivals, earning Superior ratings in all of them. The orchestra had been invited to perform at Disney Hall in 2011, but due to their recent trip to Carnegie Hall, the orchestra declined. The orchestra has been invited to Disneyland every year. In June 2012, the Orchestra attended and competed at the World's Festival at the Disney Concert Hall in Los Angeles. The Beckman Symphonic Orchestra is the middle level. This is where the sophomores, juniors, and seniors go if they do not make Chamber Orchestra. The group has earned Excellent and Superior ratings at the SCSBOA festivals. The Beckman Concert Orchestra is composed of freshman and sophomore players only. They have received Superior ratings and has provided the skills important to Chamber Orchestra. Vocal arts The Beckman High School Chorale sings an extensive repertoire of music both classical and contemporary. It was formed in 2004 and has since grown to consist of over 100 participants. Throughout the years, a number of changes have taken place with the choirs. Currently there are three choir classes offered at Beckman. The Mixed Choir is a non-auditioned choir made up of underclassmen and upperclassmen. The Bel Canto Choir is an advanced auditioned group of underclassmen and upperclassmen women with a wide range of musical experiences, while the Madrigals Choir is an advanced, auditioned upperclassmen-only choir. The choirs have performed at Disneyland and many other festivals. Singers in these choirs have participated in honor choirs and competitions across the country and have received music scholarships to college. Visual arts In 2008 a visual arts student at Beckman High, won first place in Orange County in the Imagination Celebration Poster Contest. The works of other students were selected to be exhibited at the Orange County Fine Arts Gallery as well. In 2007, a student won second place in the photography division of the Music Center Spotlight Awards. In 2009, a student won the grand prize in the Olympus Student Photo Contest as well as the Adobe Youth Voices contest. In 2012, Beckman High School was represented by two students at the California State Science Fair. Beckman hosted \\"A Miley-Sized Surprise\\" on December 31, 2008, featuring Miley Cyrus visiting Beckman. This was an award for a student who raised awareness about breast cancer through her hard work and contributions to the BHS Pink Ribbon Club. The show aired on New Year's Eve, and had 12.5 million viewers.  Athletics  Beckman's athletics program include teams in football, water polo, swimming, basketball, volleyball, baseball, softball, soccer, lacrosse, tennis, wrestling, cross country, track and field, golf, dance, and cheer. However, because the school was brand new, and only had freshman and sophomores, many sports were forced to wait until the second year of the school's activity to play at the varsity level.  Softball  In 2007, softball won CIF.  Volleyball  The 2007‚Äì2008 Beckman varsity volleyball team made it into the CIF championships for the second year in a row.

History  The roots of Chinquapin, North Carolina lie largely with the Thigpen family, who migrated to the area from Perquimans Precinct in the 1730s. James Thigpen, the first of the Duplin County Thigpens, obtained a patent for land bordering the Northeast Cape Fear River, establishing a plantation he called ‚ÄúChinquapen Orchard.‚Äù James and his kin named many of the creeks around their new home after those in Perquimans ‚Äì Cypress Creek, Muddy Creek, even Chinquapin itself. An Algonquian word, chinquapin, or \\"chinkapin,\\" is a diminutive cousin of the American chestnut that is abundant along creeks and rivers of the Southeastern United States. According to Bible records, James Thigpen died at Chinquapen Orchard in 1737. His son, Dr. James Thigpen IV, purchased the land from his mother (she had remarried) for his son Job, holding it in trust until he reached maturity. When Job and his wife Annie began running the plantation in 1754, they dropped the latter part of the name, simply calling their home Chinquapin. During this period significant numbers of Scotch-Irish immigrants began arriving to the Cape Fear region, settling on land purchased from a London merchant named Henry McCulloch, who had obtained 71,160 acres along the river from the British Crown. There was extensive mingling between these newer inhabitants and those inhabitants who had been in the area for some time, such as the Thigpens, as marriage records substantiate. In 1780 Chinquapin was burned by Tories, likely in retaliation for Job‚Äôs service in the N.C. militia. As Job did not survive the war, it was left to his eldest son, Joab, to rebuild the plantation. Chinquapin has always been a predominantly agrarian community focused around the cultivation of corn and (to a lesser extent now) tobacco. Raising livestock and harvesting timber/naval stores has also been an essential component of the local economy for centuries. Before the railroad, the only feasible method for these commodities to reach the market (namely that of Wilmington) was via river. Ideally located near the N.E. Cape Fear, Chinquapin was oftentimes the port of departure for produce in eastern Duplin County, especially at times of low water levels when sites further upriver were not accessible. Throughout the early 19th century, the plantation at Chinquapin grew from a homestead with a handful of slaves to a community of several dozen people. In 1865, towards the end of the Civil War, Union troops captured a small steamer named the A. P. Hurt at Fayetteville. They appointed a former slave named Dan Buxton its pilot and sent it to operate at Chinquapin. After the war, Buxton tracked down the businessmen who had originally owned the vessel and informed them that he considered the A.P. Hurt to still be their property. Buxton promised to return her if they kept him as pilot for life. When she sank in 1923, he was still on the job after sixty years. Together with P.D. Robbins, who operated a steamer in the nearby community of Hallsville (just above Chinquapin), the duo represent a rich, often overlooked, history of African American river boating in Duplin County. In 1884, a post office was built in Chinquapin; the first postmaster was local farmer and storekeeper William Herring Sloan. Beginning in 1890, a project was funded by the state for the clearing of the river for small steamers to Hallsville, 88 miles above the mouth of the Northeast Cape Fear River, and for pole boats to Kornegay's Bridge, 103 miles above the mouth. The project lasted until roughly 1913, by which time $33,738.86 had been spent on improvements to and maintenance of the channel. River commerce remained steady until lumber companies began laying rail throughout the county. A railroad depot was constructed in Chinquapin around 1916. The Atlantic & Carolina Railroad ran from the Atlantic Coast Line Railroad (just north of the station at Warsaw) through Kenansville to Chinquapin. North of Chinquapin, across Muddy Creek, the A & C, the Kinston Carolina RR (Rowland Lumber Company), and Ropper Lumber Company laid secondary tracks near Chinquapin to facilitate the harvesting of longleaf pine forests around that section of the county. Local photographs from this period are notable in that there are no significant groupings of trees visible in them. Despite the initial economic boom resulting from the presence of the railroad, which was dismantled during the Great Depression, and the widespread clear-cut logging that it allowed for, Chinquapin has grown very little since the early 20th century. The majority of the area‚Äôs population growth has actually taken place in the countryside surrounding the community and in the nearby towns of Wallace and Beulaville. Several small businesses still call Chinquapin home, however, and the community is still served by a post office and an elementary school.  Education  In the early 1900s, Booker T. Washington and a philanthropist named Julius Rosenwald helped set up schools for children in rural black communities. One such ‚ÄúRosenwald School‚Äù operated in Chinquapin as late as the 1930s. Chinquapin High School was built in 1925 and first accredited in 1926 ‚Äì its first principal was Arthur Ranes. The building was two stories and of wood framed/brick veneer construction. A two story attached classroom wing and detached cafeteria, both of masonry construction, were added in the 1950s. In 2010, the county demolished the structure through a controlled burn.  Notable residents  Chinquapin is the birthplace of Caleb Bradham (May 27, 1867 ‚Äì February 19, 1934), inventor of Pepsi-Cola. Randall Kenan (born March 12, 1963) is an American author of fiction and non-fiction who was raised in Chinquapin, North Carolina. Among his books is the collection of short stories Let the Dead Bury Their Dead, which was named a New York Times Notable Book in 1992. Kenan is the recipient of a Guggenheim Fellowship, a Whiting Award and the John Dos Passos Prize.  Demographics  As of 2014, the population of Chinquapin, North Carolina - that is, of ZIP code 28521 - was 2,312. There are currently no metrics available annotating the population of the actual community of Chinquapin. The population density within the ZIP code was 55 people per square mile. The median age in Chinquapin was 45.4, significantly higher than the US median of 37.2. 43.82% of people in Chinquapin were married while 11.53% were divorced. The average household size was 2.3 people. 25.57% of people were married with children. 20.20% had children, but were single. According to the same census, the majority of residents in the Chinquapin area were Caucasian; 80.32% of people were white, 16.05% were black, 0.00% were Asian, 0.00% were Native American, and 0.56% claimed other. 0.95% of the people in Chinquapin claimed Hispanic ethnicity, though the actual figures are undoubtedly much higher.

The test is proctored to all students in their sophomore year; if the state goal is not met, students must retake the sections they do not pass until they meet goal. Students take the test in March. The test covers four subjects‚Äîmathematics, reading, writing, and science‚Äîin nine individual sessions, which are taken over a period of 9 days. Prior to testing, the state of Connecticut requires that students take scaled practice tests to allow them to be at ease when they take the real CAPT. The mock tests are actually prior CAPT tests that the state has released. CAPT disciplines As of 2009, CAPT tests students on four curricular disciplines, which is broken down into nine individual tests. Science The Science portion of the CAPT is broken into two 55-minute test sessions entitled Science I and Science II. Types of questions included in the science tests include open-ended and multiple-choice questions. The science tests cover a wide range of topics: basic chemistry and physics; biology, including cell reproduction and structures; and earth science, among others. Reading The Reading section split into two tests: Reading for Information and Response to Literature. Both tests require the student to read various articles and respond to open-ended and multiple choice questions accordingly. =Response to Literature= Response to Literature requires the student to read a short story and answer four predetermined questions in a time of 70 minutes. Recently, the questions have been as follows: # Initial Understanding. What are your thoughts and questions about the story? You might reflect upon characters, their problems, the title, or other ideas in the story. #Interpretation. One of the following is given: ##Choose one of the following quotations from the story (three are given). Explain what you think the quotation means as it relates to elements of the story such as characters or theme, or ##How does the main character change from the beginning of the story to the end? What do you think causes the change? #Connection. What does this story say about people in general? In what ways does it remind you of people you have known or experiences you have had? You may also write about stories you have read or movies, works of art, or television shows you have seen. Use examples from the stories to explain your thinking.'' #Critical Stance. How successful was the author in creating a good piece of literature? Use examples from the story to explain your thinking.'' The students have a total of 21 lines on which to complete each question. The questions are graded as a whole, meaning that the grade is affixed to the entire set of answers, not each individually. This section is graded on a scale from one to six; two scorers will read the answers and the final grade will be out of twelve. A score of nine is now required to meet state goal.Previously, a score of only eight was required, but since then, the goal has been bumped up. Writing Writing comprises three test sessions on two subjects. =Interdisciplinary Writing= Interdisciplinary Writing is composed of two test sessions‚ÄîInterdisciplinary Writing I and Interdisciplinary Writing II‚Äîtaken on two separate days. Each session requires that you read two articles on a divisive issue and take a clear stance on the issue. Students are given three pages on which to write a persuasive letter on the stance that they have taken. It is required to use evidence from each of the two sources. The same procedure is repeated for the second day; a new topic is given. =Editing & Revising= Editing & Revising is a 25 minute session in which the student read short excerpts from stories and answer multiple choice questions accordingly. Questions usually relate to grammar, spelling, structure, etc. Mathematics The mathematics portion of CAPT is also broken into two sessions: Mathematics I and Mathematics II. In both tests, there is a section of open-ended questions in which the student must answer a question, explain their procedure, show their work, and sometimes draw a visual. The second portion of the tests are grid-ins; the student will answer a question and then bubble in his/her answer in the grid provided.

Background In 2004 a committee for the Appalachian Family Caravan tour created a promotional video shown throughout the region by Chancellor Kenneth E. Peacock. The tour began September 27, 2004 and included areas where Appalachian State has a strong alumni base. The tour planned to make stops in Atlanta, Miami and Tampa. Peacock described the video's role in promotion: :It was used primarily for the [Appalachian] Caravan, taking it out with us on the road show and show that Appalachian is a great institution and it's hot in many ways, and that was part of the whole show. So in order to understand fully that video, you almost had to be at one of those Caravan events. I would ask the audience to say, 'You know why this is the case? It's because Appalachian, my friends, is ‚Ä¶' and they would respond, 'Hot.' I think they took it off the Web site because, without it being a Caravan event, it's confusing. People don't really understand what the message is with the song. It was all done in fun, to go and energize our alumni and say here are some things that are happening on campus, holding up the highlights of faculty, programs, accomplishments of students, and say 'You know why this is possible? It's because Appalachian is hot.' It builds all around that whole theme. The video This screenshot illustrates the format of the video, whose quality was widely panned. The format of the video is a slide show of pictures that one BoingBoing commentator described as \\"incredibly lame imagery.\\" accompanied by lyrics at the bottom of the screen. The two-minute-and-17-second slide show of images around campus included an original song with lyrics such as these from the chorus: > Hot hot hot, Hot hot hot. Appalachian is hot hot hot! Come and let us show > you what we've got. Come and let us show you why we're hot hot hot! The response The extensive use of puffery and the retro juxtaposition of music and PowerPoint style still imagery claiming that the school is \\"hot hot hot\\" inadvertently play into the stereotype that people from Appalachia are unsophisticated and out of touch. A December 2004 Faculty meeting noted: \\"Concern has been expressed about the style/public image implied by the 'Faculty Caravan' video on ASU's webpage that goes with the song 'Hot Hot Hot.'\\" The video began circulating widely in 2005. For many viewers, the video provided a first impression of Appalachian State University. The video was featured on VH1's Web Junk 20 program in early 2006, where it was named to the No. 5 spot on the top 20 countdown of stupidest or funny Internet videos. A January 26 editorial in the Appalachian State student newspaper criticized the video, calling it \\"so ridiculously tacky one cannot help but laugh when watching it,\\" adding, \\"The jingle is horrible, the lyrics are absurd and the pictures make Appalachian seem like an institution stuck in the 1970s.\\" The video was not an official project and in the wake of the response is no longer used by the University. Lorin Baumhover, Chief of Staff for the Office of the Chancellor at Appalachian State, told NPR, \\"It's horrible,\\" claiming the video was an inside joke for alumni. \\"I wish someone could put a stake through it,\\" he said. The video had somewhat of a resurrection on the Internet after it was revealed that Miss Teen South Carolina Caitlin Upton planned to attend Appalachian State. She achieved dubious Internet fame herself for providing a rambling answer on August 24, 2007, to a Miss Teen USA pageant question about why Americans cannot locate the U.S. on a world map. Two weeks later, the video achieved wide circulation among sports fans following the widely covered 2007 Appalachian State vs. Michigan football game.

In sports, a loan involves a particular player being able to temporarily play for a club other than the one to which they are currently contracted. Loan deals may last from a few weeks to a full season, sometimes persisting for multiple seasons at a time. Association football Players may be loaned out to other clubs for several reasons. Most commonly, young prospects will be loaned to a club in a lower league in order to gain invaluable first team experience. In this instance, the parent club may continue to pay the player's wages in full or in part. Some clubs put a formal arrangement in place with a feeder club for this purpose, such as Manchester United and Royal Antwerp, Arsenal and Beveren, or Chelsea and Vitesse. In other leagues such as Italy's Serie A, some smaller clubs have a reputation as a \\"farm club\\" and regularly take players, especially younger players, on loan from larger clubs. A club may take a player on loan if they are short on transfer funds but can still pay wages, or as temporary cover for injuries or suspensions. The parent club might demand a fee or that the loaning club pays some or all of the player's wages during the loan period. A club might seek to loan out a squad player to make a saving on his wages, or a first team player to regain match fitness following an injury. A loan may be made to get around a transfer window. Such a loan might include an agreed fee for a permanent transfer when the next transfer window opens. Some players are loaned because they are unhappy or in dispute with their current club and no other club wishes to buy them permanently. Examples of this situation include Henri Camara with Wolverhampton Wanderers, Craig Bellamy with Newcastle United, and Darren Bent with Aston Villa. In the Premier League, players on loan are not permitted to play against the team which holds their registration (section 7.2 of rule M.6). Loanees are, however, allowed to play against their 'owning' clubs in cup competitions, unless they are cup-tied (i.e. have played for their owning club in that cup during that season). Unpaid trialists In the Scottish Professional Football League (and previously the Scottish Football League), clubs are permitted to take players on as unpaid trialists even for competitive fixtures. Sometimes for the first two weeks of a trial period players' names are obfuscated; match reports use the convention \\"A Trialist\\" to refer to such players in lieu of using their real names. Rugby league Player loans occur in rugby league for similar reasons to soccer. In the United Kingdom the Rugby Football League (RFL) stipulate that loans must last for at least 28 days. There is no bar against a player playing for the loan club against the parent club unless this has been specified in the loan agreement. In Australia the National Rugby League (NRL) does not normally allow loans due to the feeder club arrangement but the Covid-19 pandemic forced a review of the situation and in 2020 loans were allowed. Guest appearances In the First World War the RFL relaxed player registration rules to allow players to play for clubs close to their military base or workplace. Confusion could arise; in 1917 Billy Batten was working near to Dewsbury so Dewsbury selected him to play against his registered club, Hull FC. Hull had also selected Batten to play in the same game. On this occasion Batten chose to play for Dewsbury. During the Second World War the RFL allowed players to play as guests for another club on a match by match basis as long as the owning club agreed to the appearance. The system also allowed players whose club had suspended operations to play while still being registered to the original club Clubs made full use of the guest system; in the 1940‚Äì41 Championship final between Wigan and Bradford, Wigan featured guest players from Liverpool Stanley, Salford and Hull Kingston Rovers while Bradford included guests from Salford and Leeds.

On August 8, 1511, Pope Julius II created three dioceses in the New World, two in Hispaniola (Santo Domingo and Concepci√≥n de la Vega) and one in Puerto Rico (San Juan), and Manso was appointed bishop of the diocese of Porto Rico. On March 3, 1512, he was consecrated bishop by Diego de Deza, Archbishop of Sevilla. Before even arriving to Puerto Rico on September 26, 1512, he founded the first school of advanced studies. In 1513, he became the first bishop to arrive in the New World. In 1519, at the request of Bishop Manso the diocese of Puerto Rico was expanded to cover all the Leeward Islands. That same year he was appointed as the first Inquisitor General of the Indies and two years later he directed the construction of the Cathedral of San Juan. However, the cathedral would be completely destroyed by a hurricane in 1539, shortly after his death. Bishop Manso, as was customary at the time, became involved in politics. He became the eighth governor of Puerto RicoBishop Manso was officially the 10th governor of Puerto Rico but Vicente Y√°√±ez Pinz√≥n, the first appointed governor, never arrived on the island and Juan Ponce de Le√≥n held office as the 2nd and 6th governor of Puerto Rico. in 1523.Sources vary on whether he became governor in 1522 or 1523. However, his stay in power was short lived as he was replaced a year later by Pedro Moreno, the man who, incidentally, he had replaced. Bishop Manso was the precursor of many acts in the New World. Aside from establishing the first advanced studies school he performed the first episcopal consecration in the New World when in 1529, at the Cathedral of San Juan, he consecrated Sebasti√°n Ram√≠rez de Fuenleal, elected bishop of Santo Domingo. He also founded two hospitals, Concepci√≥n (which was the first hospital built in Puerto Rico) and San Ildefonso hospital. Bishop Manso died in San Juan, Puerto Rico, in 1539 at the age of 79. He was succeeded as bishop of Puerto Rico by Rodrigo de Bastidas y Rodriguez de Romera in 1541.

J. Abrams. The film stars Harrison Ford as a New York City lawyer from a dysfunctional family who struggles to regain his memory and recover his speech and mobility after he survives a shooting, inadvertently restoring his family's integrity in the process. The supporting cast includes Annette Bening, Mikki Allen, Bill Nunn, Rebecca Miller, Bruce Altman, and Elizabeth Wilson. The film received mixed reviews with the positive regard expressed for the strong cast and nuance of performance and negative regard expressed for the film's sentimentality and manipulativeness. The film garnered U.S. revenues of $43,001,500 at the box office on a production budget of $25 million. Plot Ambitious, callous, narcissistic, and at times unethical, Henry Turner is a wealthy successful Manhattan lawyer whose obsession with his work leaves him little time for his socialite wife, Sarah, and troubled preteen daughter, Rachel. He has just won a malpractice suit, defending a hospital against a plaintiff who claims, but is unable to prove, that he warned doctors about a pre-existing condition. Running out to a convenience store to buy cigarettes one night, Henry is shot when he interrupts a robbery. One bullet hits his right frontal lobe, while the other hits his left subclavian vein, causing excessive internal bleeding and cardiac arrest. He experiences anoxia, resulting in brain damage. Henry survives but can neither move nor talk and he suffers retrograde amnesia. While in a nursing facility, he slowly regains movement and speech with the help of a physical therapist named Bradley. Henry's recovery creates a financial burden for the family. Upon returning home, Henry is almost childlike. As he forges new relationships with his family, he realizes he does not like who he once was. Sarah enrolls Rachel into an out-of-town elite school, though she is now reluctant to go. At orientation, Henry tells Rachel a lie to help her adjust to the new school. He and Sarah grow closer, as they were when they first met. Henry also misses Rachel. Henry's firm allows him to return out of deference to his previous contributions. Sarah suggests they relocate to a smaller, less expensive residence. As his firm essentially assigns him only menial work, he realizes he no longer wants to be a lawyer. While at a dinner party, they overhear several \\"friends\\" making derogatory comments about him. Henry, finding a former colleague's letters to Sarah disclosing they had an affair, becomes angry and leaves home. He is confronted by Linda, a fellow attorney, who reveals they were having an affair and that he was going to leave Sarah. Henry has second thoughts about himself and his relationships. Henry gives the hospital documents that his firm had suppressed to the plaintiff that proves his case, and he apologizes. He then resigns from the firm. He realizes that (as Sarah had said) everything had been wrong before but it is now so much better. They reconcile, then go to Rachel's school and withdraw her. She is overjoyed to be with her parents. As they leave the building, she tosses her school-uniform hat away.

Vincent Canby of The New York Times described the film as \\"a sentimental urban fairy tale\\" that \\"succeeds neither as an all-out inspirational drama nor as a send-up of American manners.\\"\\"Regarding Henry (1991)\\" The New York Times Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times rated the film two out of four stars and commented, \\"There is possibly a good movie to be found somewhere within this story, but Mike Nichols has not found it in Regarding Henry. This is a film of obvious and shallow contrivance, which aims without apology for easy emotional payoffs, and tries to manipulate the audience with plot twists that belong in a sitcom.\\" Ebert also described the way it makes a connection between Ritz Crackers and the Ritz-Carlton hotel (which reveals that Henry's affair had in fact been deeply embedded in his apparently lost memories) as \\"especially annoying\\", apparently regarding it as comic.\\"Regarding Henry\\" Chicago Sun- Times Rita Kempley of The Washington Post called the film \\"a tidy parable of '90s sanctimony\\"\\"'Regarding Henry' (PG-13)\\" The Washington Post while Peter Travers of Rolling Stone described it as a \\"slick tearjerker\\" that \\"has a knack for trivializing the big issues it strenuously raises.\\" However, he praised Ford's performance.\\"Regarding Henry\\"Rolling Stone Variety, however, called the film \\"a subtle emotional journey impeccably orchestrated by director Mike Nichols and acutely well acted.\\"\\"Regarding Henry\\" Variety The review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reported that 41% of critics have given the film a positive review based on 29 reviews, with an average rating of 4.93/10. The site's critics consensus reads, \\"Although Harrison Ford makes the most of an opportunity to dig into a serious role, Regarding Henry is undermined by cheap sentiment and clich√©s.\\" On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 47 out of 100 based on 23 critics, indicating \\"mixed or average reviews\\".

Although Kinopanorama was initially known as Panorama (, panoramnyy film) in the Soviet Union the name was later revised to include its current name prior to the premier screenings in Moscow in 1958. In some countries, including Cuba, Greece, Norway and Sweden, it was usually marketed as Soviet Cinerama. In 1958, during which time Great Is My Country and The Enchanted Mirror, were exhibited at the Mayfair Theatre in New York City, it was briefly advertised as Cinepanorama. Kinopanorama is for the most part identical in operation to that of Fred Waller's American-designed Cinerama format.  Overview  Kinopanorama was developed between 1956 and 1957 by research technicians at the USSR Cinema and Photo Research Institute (also known as NIKFI). The chief designer of the prototype camera was Evsei Mikhailovich Goldovskii (1903‚Äì1971), the eminent Soviet inventor and scientist. The mechanical design of the first camera, which was designated as model SKP-1, evolved from the comprehensive research into other patents, each of which cited the invention of devices for the filming‚Äîand projection‚Äîof 'mosaic images' (moving and still), lodged with the United States Patent Office (dating from 1948 onwards) by, among others, Fred Waller and Richard C Babish of the Vitarama Corporation; Winton Hoch ASC; and, lastly, Paul Stanley Smith and George Wilber Moffitt, of the Smith-Dietrich Corporation), the co-inventors of Cinemiracle, a rival three-lens, three-film widescreen format. The Soviets accessed these patents without difficulty, as each was a matter of public record, available for sighting by prospective inventors and patent attorneys. The Soviets, on the other hand, did not publish or register their Kinopanorama camera with foreign patent offices. There are various, albeit minor, technical differences in the film perforations between Kinopanorama, which at the time of its invention was milled to accept the Kodak Standard (KS 1866) 'positive perforation' 4740 short-pitch camera negative stock, and those of the Cinerama and Cinemiracle cameras. Cinerama and Cinemiracle employ Bell and Howell (BH 1866) 'negative perforation' 4740 short-pitch and Dubray-Howell long-pitch 'negative perforation', respectively, for their modified Mitchell cameras. It is believed that the prototype Cinerama camera number one, on display in the foyer of the National Media Museum in Bradford, West Yorkshire, UK, was originally milled for Dubray-Howell negative perforations, although this has never been confirmed. The first Kinopanorama film, Vast is my Native Land, which in North America was titled Great Is My Country, was premiered on 28 February 1958, at the Mir Kino Theatre in Moscow. The event was profiled in the New York Times. The Enchanted Mirror, the second Kinopanorama film, received a special prize at the Brussels World's Fair known as Expo '58. Eight Kinopanorama travelogues were produced in the original three-lens format (plus an additional seven in single-negative Kinopanorama 70) until 1966. Opasniye Povoroty, the first dramatic film (released internationally in 1962) was produced with an improved Kinopanorama camera, known as the PSO-1960. This redesigned camera, of which six were manufactured, allowed for the use of interchangeable lens kits of focal lengths from 27 mm to 100 mm, inclusive.  Relaunch  The Kinopanorama three-lens process was re-launched in 1993 by Fifth Continent Movie Classics in Australia. John Steven Lasher, the former record label executive, secured the purchase of PSO-1960 camera number six, which was restored by NIKFI technicians to working order. A specifically designed logo was implemented and published in 1993 to distinguish the Kinopanorama films produced by Fifth Continent Movie Classics in Australia from those produced and exhibited in the former Soviet Union. The logo was registered by the United States Patent and Trade Mark Office on 20 October 2015. A test film, known as Chastity, Truth and Kinopanorama ‚Äì the title of which Lasher noted at his pre-screening introduction at the March 1997 Bradford Widescreen Festival at the National Media Museum is a deliberate pun on the title of Steven Soderbergh's Sex, Lies, and Videotape ‚Äì was shot in Moscow before the camera and crew were flown to Sydney in November 1993. A short documentary film titled The Bounty (1995), which was filmed in December 1993, was also screened on 19 March 1995 at the Bradford Widescreen Festival. The copyrights to these films were transferred to The Kinopanorama Widescreen Preservation Association, Inc. in January, 2014. In 1999, Fifth Continent and Vision 146 SARL produced a two-reel restoration of Opasniye Povoroty from the original Sovcolor camera negatives. The restoration was premiered in Dayton, Ohio, USA, at the New Neon Movies. It was screened at the Pacific Theatres Cinerama Dome in Hollywood in October 2004, and most recently at the Bradford Widescreen Festival on March 19, 2008. Further restoration of the remaining reels was cancelled by both companies due to high costs. In 2006, Fifth Continent converted the PSO-1960 camera to accept camera negative stock milled for the BH 4740 'negative perforation'. This is because film stock is no longer milled for KS 'positive perforation'. In 2007, a crystal-sync motor replaced the original 24-volt DC variable speed motor as well as the 240-volt 3-phase 50-hertz synch motor.  Kinopanorama cinemas  Seven cinemas designed (or renovated) for the exhibition of 3-film (and later 70mm) Kinopanorama were built in the former USSR from 1958 onwards. The Mir Kino Theatre, which opened in Moscow on 28 February 1958, was followed by others in Leningrad and Kiev. A Kinopanorama cinema later opened in Paris, France. These cinemas employed equipment designed and manufactured in the Soviet Union. Presently, the National Media Museum, ArcLight's Cinerama Dome and the Seattle Cinerama in Seattle, Washington, are equipped to exhibit 3-film Kinopanorama. The Kinopanorama Widescreen Preservation Association, Incorporated, was established in New South Wales, Australia in January 2010. Presently, the society has applied for state and government funding, which is expected to cover operating costs, including the purchase of custom re-built equipment, so that a future volunteer-operated Kinopanorama cinema in the vicinity of Broken Hill may exhibit 3-panel films (including Kinopanorama, Cinemiracle and Cinerama) in the future.

The mona monkey can also be found on the island of Grenada as it was transported to the island aboard slave ships headed to the New World during the 18th century. This guenon lives in groups of up to thirty-five in forests. It mainly feeds on fruit, but sometimes eats insects and leaves. The mona monkey has brown agouti fur with a white rump. Its tail and legs are black and the face is blue-grey with a dark stripe across the face. The mona monkey carries food in cheek pouches. Description The male mona monkey has a head-and-body length of and a tail of . The female's head-and-body length is . The head has a brown crown, broad whitish brow band, grey mask of bare skin and bushy pale cheek fur. The upper parts of the body and the outer sides of the limbs are deep brown while the underparts and the insides of the limbs are creamy-white. On either side of the base of the tail are a pair of patches of white hair which closely resemble the ischial callosities found in baboons and other Old World monkeys in this position. Distribution and habitat The mona monkey is native to the lowland forests of eastern Ghana, Togo, Benin, Nigeria and western Cameroon. It has also been introduced into Grenada and S√£o Tom√© and Pr√≠ncipe. Although mainly a forest species, it is able to adapt to heavily degraded forest, gallery forest in savannah regions, and mangrove forest in the delta region of the Niger River, and is generally the commonest monkey near rivers. Ecology The mona monkey is usually found in groups of about twelve individuals, with a single mature male, but larger aggregations also occur. The troop moves through the canopy foraging mainly for fruit, but also eating flowers, seeds and insects and other invertebrates. It is a vocal species with a harsh grating call, and the male issues a \\"ooer\\" alarm call. It often associates with other species of monkeys including Lowe's mona monkey (Cercopithecus lowei) and the crested mona monkey (Cercopithecus pogonias). Status The mona monkey is a common and adaptable species. Its natural forest habitat has been impacted by much habitat destruction and it suffers from being hunted for food. However the population does not seem to be declining significantly, and the International Union for Conservation of Nature has assessed its conservation status as being near-threatened.

The dam creates Lago di Vogorno upstream of Lake Maggiore and supports the 105 MW Verzasca hydroelectric power station. It was constructed between 1961 and 1965 and starting shortly after its reservoir was filled, a series of earthquakes related to its water load occurred until 1971. The dam is owned and operated by Verzasca SA and is the fourth tallest in Switzerland. The dam became a popular bungee jumping venue after a James Bond stuntman jumped off it in the opening scene of the 1995 film GoldenEye; a stunt voted as the best movie stunt of all time in a 2002 Sky Movies poll. Background On May 6, 1960, Verzasca SA was formed to construct the dam as the center-piece of the Verzasca Hydroelectric Complex. Construction of the dam began in 1961. The dam was designed and its construction supervised by Lombardi & Gellaro Ltd. Because the Contra Dam is at a lower elevation compared to other Swiss dams, warmer weather allowed construction to be carried out year-round. To divert the river and prepare a dry work-site for the dam, cofferdams were constructed, one of which redirected the river through a diversion tunnel with a capacity. As the river can have flows much higher than the tunnel's capacity, this was accepted as a risk by engineers. Excavation of the right side of the dam had to be expanded due to unforeseen weathered rock and designs were altered within 15 days. During the construction July 1964 Concrete pouring and placement occurred for 18 months, of which the maximum poured in a day was and in a month, . The aggregate for the concrete was obtained from a quarry near the construction site. The high-quality and strength gneiss-rock was ground in a rotary crusher and prepared in the concrete mixture. To facilitate the contraction and settling of the concrete in the dam, it was cooled with a series of steel pipes that ran throughout the mass of concrete, with the exception of the top of the dam. A grout curtain was placed around and below the dam as well to prevent leakage, which consumed a large amount of cement. In August 1964, the reservoir began to fill and in September 1965, the reservoir was full and the dam completed. Seismic activity During what Dr. Giovanni Lombardi, the dam's designer, described as an \\"exceptionally rapid rise of water during the first filling\\" of the reservoir, beginning in August 1964, there were seismic shocks. The earthquakes began in May 1965 and the biggest shocks had occurred later in October and November after the reservoir was full. The epicenters were located at two faults near the dam. As many as 25 shocks occurred a day. The shocks stopped once the reservoir was emptied and no damage was found. After refilling, the shocks decreased and an \\"equilibrium\\" was believed to have been reached, one that did not respond to variations in water load. Another large shock occurred several years after filling. By 1971, there were no more seismic shocks around the dam or reservoir. No known detailed geological studies were conducted prior to construction of the dam and several faults are known to exist in the area. Specifications left Dam The Contra Dam is a concrete slender arch dam with a height of and crest length of . The dam is wide at its base and wide at its crest. The dam structure contains of concrete and the structure itself has a surface area of . The dam is slender in design and its horizontal arches are in an elliptical shape. The horizontal curvature of the dam decreases from the center of the dam towards its abutments and the curvature from the center of the arches increases from the crest down to the foundation. The thickness is constant with the exception of where the dam is received by its abutments; here it is thicker to reduce pressure on the rock. The strong rock can accept stresses of 70 kg/cm2. Vertically, the thickness of the dam increases from the crest down to the foundation and has a slight curve from the center towards the crest. This helps alleviate tensile stress for when the reservoir is not only full but empty. The dam's outlet works consist of two discharge pipes, capable of releasing up to each. One discharges into the original diversion tunnel and another is located at the base of the dam and discharges into the river valley below. The dam creates Lago di Vogorno which has a capacity and surface area of , collected from a catchment area of . The Verzasca River has very irregular seasonal flows which can reach as high as . Lombardi considers it one of his most aesthetically pleasing dams, primarily because of the slenderness of the concrete arch and the \\"outstanding cleanness of the design.\\" The design also reduced the amount of concrete needed, therefore reducing the cost as well. Spillways right The dam has two spillways, each located on the structure, near its abutments on either side which have a maximum discharge capacity of . Each spillway contains six fixed-crest weirs that are wide. From each opening, the water flows down a single chute to a flip bucket at the bottom of the spillway. The flip buckets dissipate and deflect the water towards the center axis of the valley below. The spillways were later modified to improve releases and function by increasing the size of the piers and adding additional lateral deflectors near the crest. Power plant The dam supports a 105 MW power station that contains 3 x 35 MW Francis turbines and generates an average of 234 GWh annually. Water from the reservoir at above sea level is transferred to an underground power station downstream at above sea level, affording a maximum hydraulic head of . The power plant can discharge up to of water which exits via a tailrace tunnel into Lago di Verbano. The builder and owner is Verzasca SA; which has an 80-year concession on the power station which will expire in 2046. Popular culture The opening scene of the 1995 James Bond film GoldenEye featured Bond jumping off the dam. The stunt was performed by British stuntman Wayne Michaels. The jump was voted as best movie stunt of all time in a 2002 Sky Movies poll. The dam doubled as the fictional Arkhangelsk Chemical Weapons Facility located in the northern Soviet Union during the Cold War. The dam owners started to lease access to the dam, soon after GoldenEye was released, to a commercial bungee jump operator. According to the operator, over 10,000 people have jumped the 220 m (720 ft) from the dam. Eleven contestants bungee jumped off the dam as a Roadblock task in the first episode of the 14th season of The Amazing Race. The climax scene of the Indian Bollywood movie Dhoom 3 was shot at this dam. The introduction scene of the Indian Kollywood movie Vivegam was shot at this dam.

He is especially known for his characteristically epic photographs, often nudes and portraits.  Life and work  From 1907 to 1910 he had his own studio, until 1935 he operated an important portrait photostudio in Prague on the fourth floor of one of Prague's remarkable buildings, a Baroque corner house at 9 Vodiƒçkova, now demolished. Jaroslav R√∂ssler, an important avant-garde photographer, was one of his pupils. Drtikol made many portraits of very important people and nudes which show development from pictorialism and symbolism to modern composite pictures of the nude body with geometric decorations and thrown shadows, where it is possible to find a number of parallels with the avant-garde works of the period. These are reminiscent of Cubism, and at the same time his nudes suggest the kind of movement that was characteristic of the futurism aesthetic. He began using paper cut-outs in a period he called \\"photopurism\\". These photographs resembled silhouettes of the human form. Later he gave up photography and concentrated on painting. After the studio was sold Drtikol focused mainly on painting, Buddhist religious and philosophical systems. In the final stage of his photographic work Drtikol created compositions of little carved figures, with elongated shapes, symbolically expressing various themes from Buddhism. In the 1920s and 1930s, he received significant awards at international photo salons.

The game's premise is centered on the titular character, an anthropomorphic pencil who must gather the scattered segments of the totem pole that brought him to life. Woody is capable of erasing enemies and obstacles as well as creating sketches to destroy enemies or improve his navigation. The game includes 3D-rendered cutscenes featuring motion capture animation for Woody. The game's critical reception was mixed, with reviewers generally seeing Woody's abilities as interesting, but criticizing the controls. Gameplay An example of gameplay in Wild Woody. Wild Woody is a side-scrolling platform game in which the player controls the titular character. Woody is an anthropomorphic pencil who was brought to life by the bottom segment of a miniature totem pole, and is tasked with retrieving the five scattered segments of the totem pole from the worlds they have created for themselves.Wild Woody (Sega CD) instruction manual, p. 2 Woody can erase enemy characters by jumping onto them, and can erase certain walls and floors that impede his progress. Woody can also create sketches to destroy enemies or improve navigation through the levels. To use this ability, Woody must collect copies of a sketch, which will be added to Woody's personal sketchbook. The sketchbook is available in the game's pause screen, and allows the player to select a particular sketch for use. Woody is capable of drawing three consecutive sketches before he becomes too short to draw again. Woody's length can be restored by collecting pencils.Wild Woody (Sega CD) instruction manual, p. 5 The game consists of five levels, each divided into two acts and a boss encounter.Wild Woody (Sega CD) instruction manual, pp. 7‚Äì11 The first act of each level includes eight scattered puzzle pieces. If all eight pieces are collected and the first act is completed, a bonus level will initiate before the beginning of the second act. In these levels, Woody must navigate through a maze, collect sketches and extra lives, and reach the end within a limited time.Wild Woody (Sega CD) instruction manual, p. 6 The game is complete when all levels have been cleared and all totem pole pieces have been recovered. Development Wild Woody was developed and published by Sega of America. The character animation during gameplay was created by scanning hand-drawn frames that were then colored and cleaned digitally, while the animation for Woody during the cutscenes was created via motion capture performed by Donald Hom.Wild Woody (Sega CD) instruction manual, pp. 12‚Äì13 The characters Woody and the totem pole segment Low Man are respectively voiced by Joe Kerska and Jeff Farber. Other voices were provided by Bruce Robertson and Debbie Rogers. The soundtrack was composed and produced by Ron \\"Bumblefoot\\" Thal, who was given a one-month deadline to create a score consisting of a title theme, 16 game level themes and tracks for six story cutscenes and five game over sequences. Thal's central strategy for composing the score was to begin silly and light-hearted and evolve in intensity toward the game's climax; Thal applied the same strategy within each of the game's five levels from the first to third acts. Thal performed the bass, guitar, vocals and keyboard himself, while the drums were performed by Brad Kaiser. The soundtrack was recorded and mixed on February 1995. Reception Wild Woody received mixed reviews upon release. A reviewer for VideoGames noted the high amount of erasable elements and described the music as \\"lots of wacky toe-tappers\\", but found the visuals to be \\"a little grainy\\". The four reviewers of Electronic Gaming Monthly had varying reactions to the game, but generally agreed that the ability to draw up necessary items is interesting, but that the controls make erasing enemies difficult and there are frequent cheap hits. The Pencil Grinder of GamePro criticized the poor controls when jumping and summarized that \\"Woody comes up short in every department.\\" The game's title has been widely criticized for its sexually suggestive nature.\\"The Top 10 Worst Character Names,\\" Game Informer 188 (December 2008): 22.

Biography Convento, 1928 ca. (Fondazione Cariplo) Born in Rome, he studied painting at the Instituto di Belle Arti from 1908 to 1916.Gale, Oxford Art Online. After military service in World War I he studied art in Florence and Venice, soon establishing himself as one of Italy's leading figures in the neoclassical movement that arose in the 1920s. Possessed of an extremely refined technique, Donghi favored strong composition, spatial clarity, and populist subject matter.Cowling and Mundy 1990, p. 102. His figures possess a gravity and an archaic stiffness reminiscent of Piero della Francesca. Critics likened his work to that of Henri Rousseau and Georges Seurat, whose scenes of contemporary life are similarly touched with a subtle humor. His still lifes often consist of a small vase of flowers, depicted with the disarming symmetry of naive art. Donghi achieved both popular and critical success. In 1925, Franz Roh named him among the major Italian artists in the new magic realism tendency. In 1927 Donghi won First Prize in an International Exhibit at the Carnegie Institute in Pittsburgh. By the 1940s, Donghi's work was far outside the mainstream of modernism, and his reputation declined, although he continued to exhibit regularly. In his last years he concentrated mainly on landscapes, painted in a style that emphasizes linear patterns. He died in Rome in 1963. Most of Donghi's works are in Italian collections, notably the Museo di Roma. NotesReferences *Cowling, Elizabeth; Mundy, Jennifer (1990).

The gorge is known for its tall, sheer, brick-red cliffs, directly across from the monastery. The monastery is best known for its two-storey Surb Astvatsatsin (Holy Mother of God) church, which grants access to the second floor by way of a narrow stone-made staircase jutting out from the face of building, one of the earliest examples of cantilever architecture. The monastery is sometimes called Noravank at Amaghu, with Amaghu being the name of a small and nowadays abandoned village above the canyon, in order to distinguish it from Bgheno-Noravank, near Goris. In the 13th‚Äì14th centuries the monastery became a residence of Syunik's bishops and, consequently, a major religious and, later, cultural center of Armenia closely connected with many of the local seats of learning, especially with Gladzor's famed university and library. History The monastery in the early 20th century Noravank was founded in 1105 by Bishop Hovhannes, a former abbot of Vahanavank near the present-day city of Kapan in Syunik. The monastic complex includes the church of S. Karapet, S. Grigor chapel with a vaulted hall, and the church of S. Astvatsatsin (Holy Mother of God). Ruins of various civil buildings and khachkars are found both inside and outside of the compound walls. Noravank was the residence of the Orbelian princes. The architect Siranes and the miniature painter and sculptor Momik worked here in the latter part of the thirteenth and early fourteenth century. Noravank Complex The fortress walls surrounding the complex were built in the 17th‚Äì18th centuries. Surb Astvatsatsin Church Surb Astvatsatsin, the fa√ßade The backside wall of the Astvatsatsin church S. Astvatsatsin Church of Noravank The grandest structure is Surb Astvatsatsin (Holy Mother of God), also called Burtelashen (Burtel's construction) in the honour of Prince Burtel Orbelian, its financier. It is situated to the south-east of the Surb Karapet church. Surb Astvatsatsin was completed in 1339, a masterpiece of the talented sculptor and miniaturist Momik, who designed it, and was also his last work. Near the church there is his tomb khachkar, small and modestly decorated, dated the same year. In recent times the fallen roof had been covered with a plain hipped roof. In 1997 the drum and its conical roof was rebuilt, with the form based on existing fragments. However, it has been criticized as being a \\"fantasy reconstruction\\".Andreh Marouti, \\"Preservation of the Architectural Heritage of Armenia\\", 2018, page 372 The ground floor contained elaborate tombs of Burtel and his family. Narrow steps projecting from the west fa√ßade lead to the entrance into the church/oratory. There is fine relief sculpture over the entrance, depicting Christ flanked by Peter and Paul. Burtelashen is a highly artistic monument reminiscent of the tower-like burial structures of the first years of Christianity in Armenia. It is a memorial church. Its ground floor, rectangular in plan, was a family burial vault; the floor above, cross-shaped in plan, was a memorial temple crowned with a multi-columned rotunda. Burtelashen is the dominant structure in Noravank. The original three-tier composition of the building is based on the increasing height of the tiers and the combination of the heavy bottom with the divided middle and the semi-open top. Accordingly, decoration is more modest at the bottom and richer at the top. Employed as decorative elements are columns, small arches, profiled braces forming crosses of various shapes, medallions, interlaced banding around windows and doors. The western portal is decorated with special splendour. An important role in its decoration is played by the cantilevered stairs that lead to the upper level, with profiled butts to the steps. The doorways are framed with broad rectangular plaitbands, with ledges in the upper part, with columns, fillets and strips of various, mostly geometrical, fine and intricate patterns. Between the outer plathand and the arched framing of the openings there are representations of doves and sirens with women's crowned heads. Such reliefs were widely used in fourteenth-century Armenian art and in earlier times in architecture, miniatures and works of applied art, on various vessels and bowls. The entrance tympanums are decorated with bas- reliefs showing, on the lower tympanium, the Holy Virgin with the Child and Archangels Gabriel and Michael at her sides, and, on the upper tympanium, a half-length representation of Christ and figures of the Apostles Peter and Paul. As distinct from the reliefs of Noravank's vestry, these ones are carved on a plain surface, which gives them greater independence. The figures are distinguished by their plasticity of form, softness of modeling, and accentuation of certain details of clothing. A group of the founders of Burtelashen is depicted on three columns of the western part of its rotunda. The picture consisted of relief figures of the Holy Virgin with the Child, sitting on a throne, and two standing men in rich attire, one of them holding a model of the temple. Surb Karapet Church Surb Karapet (St. John the Baptist) Church The fa√ßade of Surb Karapet Church with a striking depiction of God the Father (upper relief) The second church is the Surb Karapet, a cross within square design with restored drum and dome built in 1216‚Äì1227, just north of the ruins of the original Surb Karapet, destroyed in an earthquake. The church was built by the decree of Prince Liparit Orbelian. In 1340 an earthquake destroyed the dome of the church which in 1361 was reconstructed by the architect Siranes. In 1931 the dome was damaged during another earthquake. In 1949, the roof and the walls of the church were repaired. In 1998 the roof and drum was rebuilt with the aid of an Armenian-Canadian family. Forming the western antechamber is an impressive gavit of 1261, decorated with splendid khachkars and with a series of inscribed gravestones in the floor. Note the famous carvings over the outside lintel. The church houses Prince Smbat Orbelian's mausoleum. The gavit was probably a four-pillar one. In 1321 the building, probably destroyed by an earthquake, was covered with a new roof in the shape of an enormous stone tent with horizontal divisions, imitating the wooden roof of the hazarashen‚Äîtype peasant home. This made the structure quite different from other Armenian monuments of the same kind. The ceiling has four rows of brackets forming stalactite vaulting with a square lighting aperture at the top. A broad protruding girth over the half-columns, the deep niches with khachkars and the low tent-like ceiling almost devoid of decoration give the dimly lit interior a gloomy look. The exterior decoration focus' mainly on the western facade where the entrance to the building is. Framed in two rows of trefoils and an inscription, the semi-circular tympanum of the door is filled with an ornament and with a representation of the Holy Virgin seated on a rug with the Child and flanked by two saints. The ornament also has large letters interlaced by shoots with leaves and flowers. The Holy Virgin is sitting in the Oriental way with Child. The pattern of the rug is visible with drooping tassels. In Syunik temples of the thirteenth-fourteenth centuries the cult of the Holy Virgin was widely spread. She was depicted in relief, and many churches were dedicated to her. The pointed tympanum of the twin window over the door is decorated with a unique relief representation of the large- headed and bearded God the Father with large almond shaped eyes blessing the Crucifix with his right hand and holding in his left hand the head of John the Baptist, with a dove ‚Äî the Holy Spirit ‚Äî above it. In the right corner of the tympanum there is a seraph dove; the space between it and the figure of the Father is filled with an inscription. Surb Grigor Chapel Grave of Elikum III Orbelian, son of Prince Tarsaich Orbelian The side chapel of Surb (Saint) Grigor was added by the architect Siranes to the northern wall of Surb Karapet church in 1275. The chapel contains more Orbelian family tombs, including a splendid carved lion/human tombstone dated 1300, covering the grave of Elikum son of Prince Tarsayich Orbelian. The modest structure has a rectangular plan, with a semi-circular altar and a vaulted ceiling on a wall arch. The entrance with an arched tympanum is decorated with columns, and the altar apse is flanked with khachkars and representations of doves in relief. Khachkars The complex has several surviving khachkars. The most intricate of them all is a 1308 khachkar by Momik. Standing out against the carved background are a large cross over a shield-shaped rosette and salient eight-pointed stars vertically arranged on its sides. The top of the khachkar shows a Deesis scene framed in cinquefoil arches symbolizing a pergola as suggested by the background ornament of flowers, fruit and vine leaves. Nature The area is a part of Gnisheek Prime Butterfly Area and Noravank Important Bird Area. A wide variety of animals and plants can be found here, such as the Bezoar Goat, Bearded Vulture, Alexanor butterfly, and others. Brief Chronological History Before the 9th century - According to historian Stepanos Orbelian a church dedicated to St. Pokas stands on the monastery site. 800-900 - A church was built: sources call it St. Karapet's or Church of Svag Khoradzor.

It is in the western part of the chancel, between the nave and the sanctuary, which houses the altar and Church tabernacle. In larger medieval churches it contained choir-stalls, seating aligned with the side of the church, so at right-angles to the seating for the congregation in the nave. Smaller medieval churches may not have a choir in the architectural sense at all, and they are often lacking in churches built by all denominations after the Protestant Reformation, though the Gothic Revival revived them as a distinct feature. As an architectural term \\"choir\\" remains distinct from the actual location of any singing choir ‚Äì these may be located in various places, and often sing from a choir-loft, often over the door at the liturgical western end. In modern churches, the choir may be located centrally behind the altar, or the pulpit. The back-choir or retroquire is a space behind the high altar in the choir of a church, in which there may be a small altar standing back to back with the other. History The Quire in Palencia Cathedral in northern Spain, an example of a monastic quire In the Early Church, the sanctuary was connected directly to the nave. The choir was simply the east part of the nave, and was fenced off by a screen or low railing, called cancelli, which is where the English word chancel comes from. The development of the architectural feature known as the choir is the result of the liturgical development brought about by the end of persecutions under Constantine the Great and the rise of monasticism. The word \\"choir\\" is first used by members of the Latin Church. Isidore of Seville and Honorius of Autun write that the term is derived from the \\"corona\\", the circle of clergy or singers who surrounded the altar. When first introduced, the choir was attached to the bema, the elevated platform in the center of the nave on which were placed seats for the higher clergy and a lectern for scripture readings. This arrangement can still be observed at the Basilica of St. Mary Major in Rome. Over time, the bema (or presbytery) and choir moved eastward to their current position. In some churches, such as Westminster Cathedral, the choir is arranged in the apse behind the altar. The architectural details of the choir developed in response to its function as the place where the Divine Office was chanted by the monastic brotherhood or the chapter of canons. The chancel was regarded as the clergy's part of the church, and any choirboys from a choir school counted as part of the clergy for this purpose. After the Reformation, when the number of clergy present even in large churches and cathedrals tended to reduce, and lay singing choirs became more frequent, there were often objections to placing them in the traditional choir stalls in the chancel. The pulpit and lectern are also usually found at the front of the choir, though both Catholic and Protestant churches have sometimes moved the pulpit to the nave for better audibility. The organ may be located here, or in a loft elsewhere in the church. Some cathedrals have a retro-choir behind the High Altar, opening eastward towards the chapels (chantries) in the eastern extremity. After the Reformation Protestant churches generally moved the altar (now often called the communion table) forward, typically to the front of the chancel, and often used lay choirs who were placed in a gallery at the west end. The choir and rear of deep chancels became little used in churches surviving from the Middle Ages, and new churches very often omitted one. With the emphasis on sermons, and their audibility, some churches simply converted their chancels to seat part of the congregation. In 19th-century England one of the battles of the Cambridge Camden Society, the architectural wing of the Anglo-Catholics in the Church of England, was to restore the chancel, including the choir, as a necessary part of a church. By pushing the altar back to its medieval position and having the choir used by a lay choir, they were largely successful in this, although the harder end of the High Church objected to allowing a large group of laity into the chancel.White, James F., The Cambridge Movement: The Ecclesiologists and the Gothic Revival, 93‚Äì97, 1962 (2004 reprint), Wipf and Stock Publishers, , 9781592449378, google books Different approaches to worship in the 20th century again tended to push altars in larger churches forward, to be closer to the congregation, and the chancel again risks being a less used area of the church. Seating Illustration showing monk's stalls at Anellau, France, 14th century The choir area is occupied by sometimes finely carved and decorated wooden seats known as choir stalls, where the clergy sit, stand or kneel during services. The choir may be furnished either with long benches (pews) or individual choir stalls. There may be several rows of seating running parallel to the walls of the church. The use of choir stalls (as opposed to benches) is more traditional in monasteries and collegiate churches. Monastic choir stalls are often fitted with seats that fold up when the monastics stand and fold down when they sit. Often the hinged seat will have a misericord (small wooden seat) on the underside on which he can lean while standing during the long services. The upper part of the monk's stall is so shaped as to provide a headrest while sitting, and arm rests when standing. Monasteries will often have strict rules as to when the monastics may sit and when they must stand during the services. Choir benches are more common in parish churches. Each bench may have padded kneelers attached to the back of it so that the person behind may kneel at the appropriate times during services. The front row will often have a long prie-dieu running in front of it for the choir members to place their books on, and which may also be fitted with kneelers. In a cathedral, the bishop's throne or cathedra is usually located in this space.

William was the second son of Frederick William, Duke of Brunswick-L√ºneburg, and after the death of his father in 1815, was under the guardianship of King George IV of the United Kingdom. He became a Prussian major in 1823. When his brother, Charles, was deposed as ruling duke by a rebellion in 1830, William took over the government provisionally. In 1831, a family law of the House of Guelph made William the ruling duke permanently. William left most government business to his ministers, and he spent most of his time outside of his state at his possessions in Oels. While William joined the Prussian-led North German Confederation in 1866, his relationship to Prussia was strained, since Prussia refused to recognize Ernest Augustus, Crown Prince of Hanover, his nearest male-line relative, as his heir, because of the Duke of Cumberland's claim to the throne of Hanover. William died in 1884; he passed on his private possessions to the Duke of Cumberland. His death caused a constitutional crisis for Brunswick that lasted until the accession of Ernest Augustus, Duke of Brunswick, the son of the Crown Prince of Hanover, in 1913. William died unmarried, but had a number of illegitimate children.

There are a few different methods used by the various artists to shape their trees, which share a common heritage with other artistic horticultural and agricultural practices, such as pleaching, bonsai, espalier, and topiary, and employing some similar techniques. Most artists use grafting to deliberately induce the inosculation of living trunks, branches, and roots, into artistic designs or functional structures. Tree shaping has been practiced for at least several hundred years, as demonstrated by the living root bridges built and maintained by the Khasi people of India. Early 20th century practitioners and artisans included banker John Krubsack, Axel Erlandson with his famous circus trees, and landscape engineer Arthur Wiechula. Contemporary designers include \\"Pooktre\\" artists Peter Cook and Becky Northey, \\"arborsculpture\\" artist Richard Reames, and furniture designer Dr Chris Cattle, who grows \\"grownup furniture\\". History Living root bridges in Nongriat village, Meghalaya Some species of trees exhibit a botanical phenomenon known as inosculation (or self-grafting); whether among parts of a single tree or between two or more individual specimens of the same (or very similar) species. Trees exhibiting this behavior are called inosculate trees. The living root bridges of Cherrapunji, Laitkynsew, and Nongriat, in the present-day Meghalaya state of northeast India are examples of tree shaping. These suspension bridges are handmade from the aerial roots of living banyan fig trees, such as the rubber tree. The pliable tree roots are gradually shaped to grow across a gap, weaving in sticks, stones, and other inclusions, until they take root on the other side. This process can take up to fifteen years to complete.Baker, Russ.\\"\\", Business Insider, 6 Oct. 2011 There are specimens spanning over 100 feet, some can hold up to the weight of 50 people. The useful lifespan of the bridges, once complete, is thought to be 500‚Äì600 years. They are naturally self-renewing and self-strengthening as the component roots grow thicker. Living trees were used to create garden houses in the Middle East, a practice which later spread to Europe. In Cobham, Kent there are accounts of a three- story house that could hold 50 people. Pleaching is a technique used in the very old horticultural practice of hedge laying. Pleaching consists of first plashing living branches and twigs and then weaving them together to promote their inosculation. It is most commonly used to train trees into raised hedges, though other shapes are easily developed. Useful implementations include fences, lattices, roofs, and walls. Some of the outcomes of pleaching can be considered an early form of what is known today as tree shaping. In an early, labor-intensive, practical use of pleaching in medieval Europe, trees were installed in the ground in parallel hedgerow lines or quincunx patterns, then shaped by trimming to form a flat-plane grid above ground level. When the trees' branches in this grid met those of neighboring trees, they were grafted together. Once the network of joints were of substantial size, builders laid planks across the grid, upon which they built huts to live in, thus keeping the human settlement safe in times of annual flooding. Wooden dancing platforms were also built and the living tree branch grid bore the weight of the platform and dancers. In late medieval European gardens through the 18th century, pleached all√©es, interwoven canopies of tree-lined garden avenues, were common. Methods There are various methods of shaping a tree. Some of these processes are still experimental, whereas others are still in the research stage. These methods use a variety of horticultural and arboricultural techniques to achieve an intended design. Chairs, tables, living spaces and art may be shaped from growing trees. Some techniques used are unique to a particular practice, whereas other techniques are common to all, though the implementation may be for different reasons. These methods usually start with an idea of the intended outcome. Some practitioners start with detailed drawings or designs. Other artists start with what the tree already has. Each process has its own time frame and a different level of involvement from the tree shaper. The trees might then either remain growing, as with the living Pooktre garden chair, or perhaps be harvested as a finished work, like John Krubsack's chair. Aeroponic culture Chair created using aeroponic root shaping The oldest known living examples of woody plant shaping are the aeroponically cultured living root bridges built by the ancient War- Khasi people of the Cherrapunjee region in India. These are being maintained and further developed today by the people of that region. Aeroponic growing was first formally studied by W. Carter in 1942. Carter researched air culture growing and described \\"a method of growing plants in water vapor to facilitate examination of roots\\".Carter, W.A. (1942). A method of growing plants in water vapor to facilitate examination of roots. Phytopathology 732: 623-625. Later researchers, including L. J Klotz and G. G. Trowel, expanded on his work.Stoner, R.J. (1983). Rooting in Air. Greenhouse Grower Vol I No. 11 In 1957, F. W. Went described \\"the process of growing plants with air-suspended roots and applying a nutrient mist to the root section\\", and in it he coined the word 'aeroponics' to describe that process. In 2008, root researcher and craftsman Ezekiel Golan described and secured a patent for a process which allows the roots of some aeroponically grown woody plants to lengthen and thicken while still remaining flexible. At lengths of perhaps or more, the soft roots can be formed into pre-determined shapes which will continue thickening after the shapes are formed and as they continue to grow. Newer techniques and applications, such as eco-architecture, may allow architects to design, grow, and form large permanent structures, such as homes, by shaping aeroponically grown plants and their roots. Instant tree shaping Arborsculpture bench by Richard Reames created using the techniques as described in his books How to grow a chair and Arborsculpture Instant tree shaping starts with mature trees, perhaps 6‚Äì12 ft. (2‚Äì3.6 m) long and 3-4in (7.6‚Äì10 cm) in trunk diameter, which are bent and woven into the desired design and held until cast. Understanding a tree's fluid dynamics is important to achieving the desired result. Bending is sometimes used to achieve a design. If a plant's tissue is bent at too sharp an angle it may break, which can be mostly avoided by un-localizing the bend. This is achieved by making small bends along the curve of the tree. Bends are then held in place for several years until their form is permanently cast. The tree's rate of growth determines the time necessary to overcome its resistance to the initial bending. The work of bending and securing in this way might be accomplished in an hour or perhaps in an afternoon depending on the design. Ring barking is sometimes employed to help balance a design by slowing the growth of too-vigorous branches or stopping the growth of inopportunely placed branches, using different degrees of ring barking, from simple scoring to complete removal of a 3/8\\"-wide (1 cm) band of bark. Creasing is folding trees such as willow and poplar over upon themselves, creating a right angle. This method is more radical than bending. With this method it is possible to perform initial bending and grafting on a project in an hour, as with Peace in Cherry by Richard Reames, removing supports in as little as a year and following up with minimal pruning thereafter. Gradual tree shaping \\"Grownup furniture\\" by Chris Cattle created using a gradual tree shaping method Gradual tree shaping starts with designing and framing. These are fundamental to the success of the piece. Once these are set up, young seedlings or saplings 3‚Äì12 in. (7.6‚Äì30.5 cm) long are planted. The training starts with young seedlings, saplings or the stems of trees when they are very young, which are gradually shaped while the tree is growing to form the desired shape. There is a small area just behind the growing tip that forms the final shape. The shaping zone, it is the shaping of this area requires day to day or weekly guiding of the new growth. The growth is guided along predetermined design pathways; this may be a wooden jig or complex wire design. With this method the time frame is longer than the other methods. A chair design might take 8 to 10 years to reach maturity Some of Axel Erlandson trees's took as long as 40 years to assume their finished shapes. Common techniques=Framing Framing may be used for various purposes and might consist of any one or a combination of several materials, such as timber, steel, hollowed out trees, complex wire designs, wooden jigs, or the tree itself, living or dead. It can be used in many project designs to support grafted joints until the grafts are well-established. Some processes might employ framing to hold a shape created by bending or fletching mature trees until the tissues have overcome their resistance to the initial bending and grown enough annual rings to cast the design permanently. Others might use framing to support and shape the growth of young saplings until they are strong enough to maintain an intended shape without support. Still other approaches might employ frames to guide the roots of aeroponically grown trees into desired shapes. Grafting Grafting is a commonly employed technique that exploits the natural biological process of inosculation. A branch or plant is cut and a piece of another plant is added and held in place. Various types of grafting all share the goal of encouraging the tissues of one plant to fuse with those of another. Grafting is applied to create permanent connections and joints. In some cases, trees are grafted while they are growing, while in other cases, mature trees may be intertwined and the stems of two or more trees are then grafted together to create chairs, ladders, and other fanciful sculptures. Pruning Pruning can be used to balance a design by controlling and directing growth into a desired shape. Pruning above a leaf node can steer plant growth in the direction of the natural placement of that leaf bud. Pruning may also be used to keep a design free of unwanted branches and to reduce canopy size. Pruning is sometimes the only technique used to craft a project. Deciduous trees are mainly pruned in winter, while they are dormant above-ground, although sometimes it is necessary to prune them during the growing season. Trees repeatedly subjected to hard pruning may experience stunted growth, and some trees may not survive this treatment. Timing Using time as part of the construction is intrinsical to achieving this art form. Structure Living grown structures have a number of structural mechanical advantages over those constructed of lumber and are more resistant to decay. While there are some decay organisms that can rot live wood from the outside, and though living trees can carry decayed and decaying heartwood inside them; in general, living trees decay from the inside out and dead wood decays from the outside in. Living wood tissue, particularly sapwood, wields a very potent defense against decay from either direction, known as compartmentalization. This protection applies to living trees only and varies among species. Growing structures is not as easy as it would seem. Quick growing willows have been used to grow building structures, they provide support or protection. A young group of German architects are in the process of such a structure and they are continually monitored and checked. Once the trees are of age to be able to take on load-bearing weight they are tested for stability and strength by a structural engineer. Once this is approved the supporting framework is removed. Projects are limited to the trees' weight loading ability and growth. This is being studied and the load capacity will be proved by testing on prototypes. Design options Becky's Mirror by Pooktre Designs may include abstract, symbolic, or functional elements. Some shapes crafted and grown are purely artistic; perhaps cubes, circles, or letters of an alphabet, while other designs might yield any of a wide variety of useful shapes, such as clothes hangers, laundry and wastepaper bins, ladders, furniture, Note large file: 8.04MB tools, and tool handles. Eye- catching structures such as living fences and jungle gyms can also be grown, and even large architectural designs such as live archways, domes, gazebos, tunnels, and theoretically entire homes are possible with careful planning, planting, and culturing over time. The Human Ecology Design team (H.E.D.) at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology is designing homes that can be grown from native trees in a variety of climates. Suitable trees are installed according to design specifications and then cultured over time into intended structures. Some designs may use only living, growing wood to form the structures, while others might also incorporate inclusions such as glass, mirror, steel and stone, any of which might be used either as either structural or aesthetic elements. Inclusions can be positioned in a project as it is grown and, depending on the design, may either be removed when no longer needed for support or left in place to become fixed inclusions in the growing tissue. Chronology of notable practitioners=War-Khasi people The ancient War-Khasi people of India worked with the aerial roots of native banyan fig trees, adapting them to create footbridges over watercourses. Modern people of the Cherrapunjee region carry on this traditional building craft. Roots selected for bridge spans are supported and guided in darkness as they are being formed, by threading long, thin, supple banyan roots through tubes made from hollowed-out trunks of woody grasses. Preferred species for the tubes are either bamboo or areca palm, or 'kwai' in Khasi, which they cultivate for areca nuts. The Khasi incorporate aerial roots from overhanging trees to form support spans and safety handrails. Some bridges can carry fifty or more people at once. At least one example, over the Umshiang stream, is a double-decker bridge. They can take ten to fifteen years to become fully functional and are expected to last up to 600 years. John Krubsack John Krubsack was an American banker and farmer from Embarrass, Wisconsin. He shaped and grafted the first known grown chair, harvesting it in 1914. He lived from 1858 to 1941. He had studied tree grafting and become a skilled found-wood furniture crafter. The idea first came to him to grow his own chair during a weekend wood-hunting excursion with his son. He started box elder seeds in 1903, selecting and planting either 28 or 32 of the saplings in a carefully designed pattern in the spring of 1907. In the spring of 1908, the trees had grown to six feet tall and he began training them along a trellis, grafting the branches at critical points to form the parts of his chair. In 1913, he cut all the trees except those forming the legs, which he left to grow and increase in diameter for another year, before harvesting and drying the chair in 1914; eleven years after he started the box elder seeds. Dubbed The Chair that Lived; it is the only known tree shaping that John Krubsack did. The chair is on permanent display in a Plexiglas case at the entrance of Noritage Furniture; the furniture manufacturing business now owned by Krubsack's descendants, Steve and Dennis Krubsack. Axel Erlandson Axel Erlandson was a Swedish American farmer who started training trees as a hobby on his farm in Hilmar, California, in 1925. He was inspired by observing a natural sycamore inosculation in his hedgerow. In 1945, he moved his family and the best of his trees from Hilmar to Scotts Valley, California, and in 1947, opened an horticultural attraction called the Tree Circus. Erlandson lived from 1884 to 1964; training more than 70 trees during his lifetime. He considered his methods trade secrets and when asked how he made his trees do this, he would only reply, \\"I talk to them.\\" His work appeared in the column of Ripley's Believe It or Not! twelve times. 24 trees from his original garden have survived transplanting to their permanent home at Gilroy Gardens in Gilroy, California. His Telephone Booth Tree is on permanent display at the American Visionary Art Museum in Baltimore, Maryland and his Birch Loop tree is on permanent display at the Museum of Art and History in Santa Cruz, California. Both of these are preserved dead specimens. Arthur Wiechula 19th-century sketch by Arthur Wiechula of inosculated branches Arthur Wiechula was a German landscape engineer who lived from 1868 to 1941. In 1926, he published Wachsende H√§user aus lebenden B√§umen entstehend (Developing Houses from Living Trees) in German. In it, he gave detailed illustrated descriptions of houses grown from trees and described simple building techniques involving guided grafting together of live branches; including a system of v-shaped lateral cuts used to bend and curve individual trunks and branches in the direction of a design, with reaction wood soon closing the wounds to hold the curves. He proposed growing wood so that it constituted walls during growth, thereby enabling the use of young wood for building. Weichula never built a living home, but he grew a 394' wall of Canadian poplars to help keep the snow off of a section of train tracks. Dan Ladd Dan Ladd is a Northampton, Massachusetts based American artist who works with trees and gourds. He began experimenting with glass, china, and metal inclusions in trees in 1977 in Vermont and started planting trees for Extreme Nature in 1978. He became inspired by inosculation he noticed in nature and by the growth of tree trunks around man-made objects such as fences and idle farm equipment. He shapes and grafts trees, including their fruits and their roots, into architectural and geometric forms. Ladd calls human-initiated inosculation 'pleaching' and calls his own work 'tree sculpture'. Ladd binds a variety of objects to trees, for live wood to grow around and be incorporated, including teacups, bicycle wheels, headstones, steel spheres, water piping, and electrical conduit. He guides roots into shapes, such as stairs, using above-ground wooden and concrete forms and even shapes woody, hard-shelled Lagenaria gourds by allowing them to grow into detailed molds.Extreme Nature: The Sculptures of Dan Ladd at Putney Library 10 October 2006. A current project at the DeCordova and Dana Museum and Sculpture Park in Lincoln, Massachusetts incorporates eleven American Liberty Elm trees grafted next to each other to form a long hillside stair banister. Another of his installations, Three Arches, consists of three pairs of 14-foot sycamore trees, which he grafted into arches to frame different city views, at Frank Curto Park in Pittsburgh. Nirandr Boonnetr Nirandr Boonnetr is a Thai furniture designer and crafter. He became inspired as a child, both by a photograph of some unusually twisted coconut palms in southern Thailand and by a living fallen tree he noticed, which had grown new branches along its trunk, forming a kind of canopied bridge. His hobby began in 1980 because of his concern the Thailand forests are being ravaged by woodcarvers to the point that one day the industry would eventually carve itself out of existence. He began his first piece, a guava chair, around 1983. Originally intended as something for his children to climb and play on, the piece evolved into a living tree chair. In fifteen years he created six pieces of \\"living furniture\\", including five chairs and a table. The Bangkok Post dubbed him the father of Living Furniture. Shortly thereafter, he presented a chair as a gift to her Royal Highness, Princess Sirindhorn. Nirandr Boonnetr has written a detailed, step-by-step booklet of instructions hoping his hobby of living furniture will spread to other countries. One of his chairs was exhibited in the Growing Village pavilion at the World's Fair Expo 2005 in Nagakute, Aichi, Japan. Peter Cook and Becky Northey People trees, by Pooktre Peter Cook and Becky Northey are Australian artists who live in South East Queensland. Peter Cook became inspired to grow a chair in 1987, after visiting three fig trees in a remote corner of his property. (Archived by WebCite at ) He started the next day, with 7 willow cuttings. In 1988, he planted a wattle intended for harvest as a potted plant stand. Becky Northey moved to Peter's property in 1995 and the two formed Pooktre. Their methods involve guiding a tree's growth along predetermined wired design pathways over a period of time. They shape growing trees both for living outdoor art and for intentional harvest. They most often use Myrobalan Plum for shaping. Examples of their functional artwork include a growing garden table, a harvested coffee table, hat stands, mirrors, and a gemstone neck piece. Peter and Becky exhibited eight of their creations, including two people trees. in the Growing Village pavilion at the World's Fair Expo 2005 in Nagakute, Aichi Prefecture, Japan. Their work was published in the annual book series, Ripley's Believe It or Not. Richard Reames Richard Reames's Peace in Cherry Richard Reames is an American nurseryman and author based in Williams, Oregon, where he owns and manages a nursery, and design studio collectively named Arborsmith Studios. He was inspired by the works of Axel Erlandson, and began sculpting trees in 1991 or 1992. He began his first experimental grown chairs in the spring of 1993. In 1995, Reames wrote and published his first book, How to Grow a Chair: The Art of Tree Trunk Topiary. In it, he coined the word arborsculpture. In 2005, he published his second book, Arborsculpture: Solutions for a Small Planet. He has lectured in Australia and gives live demonstrations of bending and weaving a chair at garden shows, fairs and folk art festivals around America. Christopher Cattle Christopher Cattle's grown stool in sycamore Christopher Cattle is a retired furniture design professor from England. He started his first planting of furniture in 1996. According to Cattle, he developed an idea to train and graft trees to grow into shapes, which came to him in the late 1970s, in response to questions from students asking how to build furniture using less energy. Using various species of trees and wooden jigs to shape them, he has grown 15 three-legged stools to completion. Cattle has multiple plantings in at least four different locations in England. He participates in woodland and craft shows in England and at the Big Tent at Falkland Palace in Scotland. He exhibited his grown stools at the World's Fair Expo 2005 in the Growing Village pavilion at Nagakute, Japan. He aims to encourage as many people as possible to grow their own furniture, and envisions that, \\"One day, furniture factories could be replaced by furniture orchards.\\" Cattle calls his works grown up furniture and grown stools, but also refers to them as grown furniture, calling them \\"the result of mature thinking.\\" Mr. Wu Mr. Wu is a Chinese pensioner who designs and crafts furniture in Shenyang, Liaoning, China. He has patented his technique of growing wooden chairs and as of 2005, had designed, grown, and harvested one chair, in 2004, and had six more growing in his garden. Wu uses young elm trees, which he says are pliant and do not break easily. He also says that it takes him about five years to grow a tree chair. Related practices Other artistic horticultural practices such as bonsai, espalier, and topiary share some elements and a common heritage, though a number of distinctions may be identified. Bonsai Bonsai is the art of growing trees in small containers. Bonsai uses techniques such as pruning, root reduction, and shaping branches and roots to produce small trees that mimic full-sized mature trees. Bonsai is not intended for production of food, but instead mainly for contemplation by viewers, like most fine art. Espalier Espalier is the art and horticultural practice of training tree branches onto ornamental shapes along a frame for aesthetic and fruit production by grafting, shaping and pruning the branches so that they grow flat, frequently in formal patterns, against a structure such as a wall, fence, or trellis. The practice is commonly used to accelerate and increase production in fruit-bearing trees and also to decorate flat exterior walls while conserving space. Pleaching Pleaching is a technique of weaving the branches of trees into a hedge commonly, deciduous trees are planted in lines, then pleached to form a flat plane on clear stems above the ground level. Branches are woven together and lightly tied.The Complete Guide to Pruning and Training Plants, Joyce and Brickell, 1992, page 106, Simon and Schuster Branches in close contact may grow together, due to a natural phenomenon called inosculation, a natural graft. Pleach also means weaving of thin, whippy stems of trees to form a basketry affect. Topiary Topiary is the horticultural practice of shaping live trees, by clipping the foliage and twigs of trees and shrubs to develop and maintain clearly defined shapes, often geometric or fanciful. The hedge is a simple form of topiary used to create boundaries, walls or screens. Topiary always involves regular shearing and shaping of foliage to maintain the shape. Plantings for the future=The Fab Tree Hab Fab Tree Hab 3D render Three MIT designers ‚Äì Mitchell Joachim, Lara Greden and Javier Arbona ‚Äì created a concept of a living tree house which nourishes its inhabitants and merges with its environment. The project of Fab Tree Hab is expected to take a minimum of five years to grow the home. The plans are for the interior to be lined with clay and plastered to keep the weather outside and to look normal. The exterior is to be all natural. The Patient Gardener A Swedish architectural firm VisionDivision took part in a week-long workshop at the Italian university Politecnico di Milano with the students. The result was an 80-year plan of a living cherry tree dome in an hourglass shape and grown furniture. Framing for the dome, table and a lawn chair were built. Ten Japanese cherry trees were planted in a diameter of eight-meter circle. Four of these trees are to be living staircases to a future top level. The stair trees will have their branches grafted into each other to form the rungs. VisionDivision's architects helped the students and instructors to create an easy maintenance plan for future gardeners of the university. Baubotanik Tower Ferdinand Ludwig designed this tower as part of his doctoral thesis with the help of Prof. Dr. Speck. \\"Speck become the botanical co-supervisor\\" said Ferdinand. Growing at the University of Stuttgart is a three-storey tower of living white willows (Salix alba). This nine-meter-tall construction is almost fully grown, with a base area of around eight square meters. The framing is made up of mainly steel scaffolding which is supporting the growing trees, while keeping them to the correct form. They started with 400 white willow (Salix alba) grown in baskets on multiple levels with one row of willows planted into the ground. Once the trees were two meters tall, they were planted at the different levels of the tower. These plants are then trained to the design. The root system of the bottom level of willows needs to develop large enough to support the willows on the above levels, so that the scaffold becomes obsolete and then it and the watering and fertilising baskets can be removed altogether. The trees are grafted together with the objective of all the different plants eventually becoming a single organism. The overall aim is to have a living structure with the strength to support itself and to carry a working load. Ferdinand predicts the tower will be stable enough to support itself in five to ten years. Ferdinand does state \\"However, these are only estimates.\\" Alternative names The practice of shaping living trees has several names. Practitioners may have their own name for their techniques, so a standard name for the various practices has not emerged. Richard Reames calls the practice \\"arborsculpture\\"; Dan Ladd calls his work \\"tree sculpture\\"; Nirandr Boonnetr's work is called \\"living furniture\\"; Christopher Cattle calls his works \\"grown up furniture\\" and \\"grown stools\\"; while Peter Cook and Becky Northey call their work \\"Pooktre\\".

Live resprouting shoots emerge from either side of the tree stump seat to form a fancifully twined and inosculated two-story-tall chair back. In 1758, Swedish scientist, philosopher, Christian mystic, and theologian Emanuel Swedenborg published Earths in the Universe, in which he wrote of visiting another planet where the residents dwelled in living groves of trees, whose growth they had planned and directed from a very young stage into living quarters and sanctuaries. In the late 19th century, Styrian Christian mystic and visionary Jakob Lorber published The Household of God. In it, he wrote about the wisdom of planting trees in a circle, because once grown together, the ring of trees would be a much better house than could be built.

Association football In association football, a dummy (feint) is often used when dribbling, in offensive situations. Examples used in order to deceive an opponent into what direction you will move, include: the step over as used by Ronaldo and Cristiano Ronaldo, the flip flap (also known as \\"elastico\\") used by Ronaldo, Ronaldinho, Cristiano Ronaldo, the Marseille turn (also known as the \\"360\\" or \\"roulette\\") used by Zinedine Zidane, and Diego Maradona, the rainbow flick as used by Neymar, the Cruyff Turn named after Johan Cruyff, and dragging the ball around a defender without it leaving your foot as used by Rom√°rio.\\"Ronaldo was simply a phenomenon\\".

Random House The next most common instance is also an offensive situation, in which a player, in a reasonable shooting area, fakes a shot to trick a defender coming in for a tackle and have him flinch away. This allows the player to go around the defender and shoot from a closer distance. This dummy can also be used on a goalkeeper in a one-on-one situation: a notable example being The Goal of the Century scored by Diego Maradona where, having run half the length of the field past several outfield players, he faced goalkeeper Peter Shilton and left him on his backside with a feint, before slotting the ball into the net.\\"Top 10 World Cup goals\\". The Telegraph. Retrieved 19 August 2014 There is another situation that is used often enough that \\"dummy\\" becomes a verb. In this scenario, a player goes toward the path of passing ball, pretends to trap it and lets it goes through the legs. This is to allow his team mate‚Äîwho is also moving toward the ball but further away‚Äîcan retrieve it. Another common scenario is the \\"dummying\\" player running after the ball after letting it go through their legs, a move which is known as the Nutmeg. This is very effective if the trap fake is convincing because the stop/start on the defending player is always slower than the attacking player who has the momentum. Luis Su√°rez is known to execute these types of moves quite often.\\"Luis Suarez dummying twice, prior to each of Lionel Messi's goals during Barcelona's win against Tottenham Hotspurs at Wembley.\\" The Guardian. 6 October 2018. Rugby league and rugby union In rugby league football and rugby union football, a dummy has a similar meaning, but is generally confined to a player leading their opposing players into believing that they are about to pass or sometimes kick the ball, but instead retaining and running with the ball. This has the effect of drawing defending players to the apparent recipient of the dummy pass. One of the first rugby players to be credited with using the dummy, or at least taking the technique to New Zealand, was Tommy Haslam. Haslam played for Batley before the rugby schism and was a member of the 1888 British Isles tour of New Zealand and Australia. Australian rules football In Australian rules football the term 'dummy' again has a similar meaning to other football codes. A dummy is used to evade a tackler by feigning a hand pass or foot pass to a teammate and then changing direction suddenly to escape the opponent who has been fooled by the move.

Burgoyne, surprised by the American withdrawal from Fort Ticonderoga, hurried as many of his troops as possible forward in pursuit of the retreating Americans. The main body of the American forces had departed Fort Independence down the road to Hubbardton, and a smaller body of troops, accompanying the sick, wounded, and camp followers that had also evacuated the fort, had sailed up Lake Champlain to Skenesboro, moving from there overland to Fort Edward. This group, which included about 600 men under arms, paused at Fort Anne, where a smaller advance company from Burgoyne's army caught up to them. The British, clearly outnumbered, sent for reinforcements. The Americans decided to attack while they had the numerical advantage, and succeeded in nearly surrounding the British position about three quarters of a mile (1 km) north of the fort. The Americans retreated back to the fort when war whoops indicated the arrival of British reinforcements. While this was a ruse (the reinforcements were a single officer), it saved the British force from probable capture. More of Burgoyne's army soon came down the road, forcing the Americans to retreat from Fort Anne to Fort Edward. It has been claimed that a flag was flown at Fort Anne that may have been the first instance of a flag consisting of stars and stripes; this claim is supposedly false. Background On the night of July 5‚Äì6, the Continental Army forces occupying Fort Ticonderoga were ordered to evacuate the fort by General Arthur St. Clair, following the approach of General John Burgoyne's 8,000-man army. Burgoyne's men had placed a gun battery on top of Mount Defiance, overlooking the fort, and the American avenues of retreat were at risk of being cut off.Nickerson (1967), pp. 142‚Äì146 Most of the American forces left Ticonderoga and the surrounding defense works via Fort Independence and the road to Hubbardton. About 600 men under Colonel Pierse Long, most of them from New Hampshire, sailed up the lake in a flotilla consisting of 5 armed galleys and over 200 smaller transport vessels. These vessels were loaded with as many of the sick from the fort as they could take, stores and supplies, and armaments. Believing the log boom and pontoon bridge placed between Ticonderoga and Mount Independence to be sufficient to delay the British pursuit, Long began to sail up the lake toward Skenesboro, the southernmost navigable point on the lake, at a leisurely pace.Nickerson (1967), p. 154 Pursuit The British, however, were hardly slowed down by the water defenses. Burgoyne, once he learned of the American withdrawal on the morning of July 6, ordered the defenses to be taken down. With well-placed gunfire, the bridge and boom were eliminated as obstacles in the space of 30 minutes.Ketchum (1997), pp. 223‚Äì224 At this point Burgoyne, breaking with rigid military discipline, ordered troops to follow southward as rapidly as possible, instead of remaining in formation, while he sailed southward in pursuit.Nickerson (1967), pp. 154‚Äì155 Assisted by favorable winds, he was within three miles (4.8 km) of Skenesboro by the end of July 6, where the Americans, who arrived only two hours earlier, had a small stockade fort. In an attempt to surround the position, Burgoyne landed about 200 men from the 9th, 20th, and 21st regiments, commanded by Lieutenant Colonel John Hill, at a point south of Skenesboro with the objective of cutting off the road to Fort Anne. The Americans were in the process of portaging around the falls at Skenesboro to Wood Creek when Burgoyne's boats arrived and opened fire. Enterprise, Liberty, and Gates were destroyed by the Americans, and two ships, Trumbull and Revenge, were forced to surrender. In the process many of the American supplies were either destroyed or abandoned to the British. The Americans retreated toward Fort Anne in disarray,Ketchum (1997), p. 225 but not before starting a fire that eventually engulfed most of the structures at Skenesboro.Ketchum (1997), p. 226 When they reached Fort Anne they were met by 400 New York militia under Henry van Rensselaer, that had been sent by General Philip Schuyler from Fort Edward after he received news of the retreat from Ticonderoga. The British pursuers under Hill, when they finally reached the road, captured more American supplies, sick and wounded, and camp followers that trailed behind the main body, and moved south until they were about one mile (1.6 km) from Fort Anne. Here they encountered an American reconnaissance party numbering about 170 under Captain James Gray; in the ensuing skirmish one American was killed and three more wounded before the Americans retreated to the fort. Battle On the morning of July 8, a supposed American deserter, who was really a spy, informed Hill that the fort was occupied by nearly 1,000 demoralized troops. Opting not to attack the numerically superior force, Hill sent a message back to Burgoyne outlining the situation.Nickerson (1967), p. 155 Burgoyne ordered the 20th and 21st regiments to quick-march toward Fort Anne in support, but poor weather hampered their movement, and they did not arrive until after the battle. The \\"deserter\\" returned to Fort Anne and reported on the British position and troop strength.Ketchum (1997), p. 227 Long, seeing how few British soldiers were following him, decided to attack their position. Moving as stealthily as possible, his force tried to surround the British while they were still on the road. However, Hill's men heard the rebel movements on their flanks and retreated to a higher position, abandoning some wounded men, who were eventually captured by the Americans. When the Americans opened fire, it was \\"a heavy and well-directed fire\\", according to one British officer. The battle lasted for more than 2 hours, until both sides were nearly out of ammunition, and the British were virtually surrounded by Americans. The sound of Indian war whoops from the north prompted the Americans to retreat, and they retired to the fort with their wounded, including Van Rensselaer, who had taken a shot in the hip.Nickerson (1967), p. 156 As it turned out, there were no Indians, but only a single British officer, John Money of the 9th regiment, Burgoyne's deputy quartermaster. He had been leading a group of Indians, but when they seemed reluctant to fight the Americans, Money became impatient and ran ahead of them; it was his war cries that brought an end to the battle.Nickerson (1967), p. 157 Aftermath Back at the fort the Americans held a brief council. From a woman that the British had freed, they heard that 2,000 or more British troops under the command of General Phillips were rapidly advancing. Long's men, as they were nearly out of ammunition, withdrew toward Fort Edward, burning the stockaded fort.Ketchum (1997), p. 228 Both sides claimed victory in the battle, since the British had successfully stood their ground, and the Americans had very nearly forced them to surrender. Any American claim for victory was tempered by the fact that the force they had defeated was clearly the vanguard of a much larger British force. A British officer recovered some regimental banners either during this engagement, or following the American retreat from Fort Anne. It is widely claimed that one of the flags captured was a new design of American flag with thirteen red and white stripes and a constellation of stars, representing the earliest known use of the stars and stripes motif. However, this story is likely untrue, as the time needed for news of the flag design approved by Congress to travel, followed by construction of such a flag and then its delivery to such a remote location render the story implausible,Nickerson (1967), pp. 466‚Äì467 and the flags known to have been recovered bear no resemblance whatsoever to the United States flag.McCandless (1917), pp. 339 (flag images 408 and 409), 342 (description) Battlefield preservation The American Battlefield Trust and its partners have acquired and preserved of the battlefield.

The most significant difference between the two is that 6N2P has its two filament elements connected in parallel, unlike the series filament connection of the 12AX7, and it is thus only possible to operate it from a 6.3 volt, 340 mA filament supply (whereas a 12AX7 may be operated from either 6.3 or 12.6 volts, at 300 mA or 150 mA, respectively.) The 6N2P also has slightly lower gain than a 12AX7. The 6N2P's slightly lower gain and higher filament draw is similar to the 5751 tube (introduced in the mid-'50s) and was sold in quantity to the US military. The 5751 tube may be operated from 6.3 volts at 350 mA (the higher current draw is for increased reliability) for use in avionics. Different 6N2P versions In the 1970s an improved and more rugged version of the 6N2' was introduced, designated 6N2P-EV (Russian: 6–ù2–ü-–ï–í). The 5751WA tube is a rugged military version of the 5751, and is the closest equivalent to the 6N2P-EV. Currently, a 12AX7 variant derived from the 6N2P-EV is being produced by Sovtek, under the designation 12AX7WA. A Chinese version of 6N2P exists, labeled in Latin lettering (instead of Cyrillic) 6N2. In the 1990s a (now extinct) line of \\"Red Bear\\" guitar amplifiers was being produced in Russia by Novik Ltd. and distributed in the United States by Gibson Guitar Corporation. These amplifiers used 6N2P tubes instead of the much more common 12AX7, prompting user modifications of the amplifier to 12AX7, because the original Russian 6N2P was scarcely available outside of Russia.

More information about the incident emerged in the weeks that followed the initial reports. An investigation into the deaths ensued and it was discovered that the 11 detainees did not die of drinking foul water, but as a result of violence. The medical examiner said, \\"They had died from either lung congestion or shock and hemorrhage following multiple bruises and other injuries.\\" The coroner reported, \\"The injuries of a number of Mau Maus apparently were consistent with their allegations that uncooperative prisoners had been beaten by guards, apparently with the consent of the commandant.\\"New York Times. 23 March 1959. p.2. A report in the June 1959 edition of Time magazine entitled \\"The Hola Scandal\\" described the events. The report stated that, on 3 March 1959, 85 prisoners were marched outside and ordered to work but \\"dozens of the prisoners fell to the ground, refusing to work\\" and were beaten by the guards. When the assault had concluded, according to the magazine, 11 prisoners lay dying and another 23 needed hospital treatment.KENYA: The Hola Scandal. Time (8 June 1959). Retrieved on 2010-07-24. Caroline Elkins' tells the story of the 'Hola Massacre' in her Pulitzer Prize-winning book, Imperial Reckoning: The Untold Story of Britain's Gulag in Kenya, (2005), pages 344-353. According to Elkins, much of the story of the British and Colonial administration was covered-up during the transition to independence in Kenya, and many official documents had been intentionally destroyed during the transition. Elkins, by carefully tracing available original documents and interviews with surviving Kenyans and colonial staff, indicates that part of Hola Prison was used as a remote punishment camp for 'hard core' Mau Mau insurgents who refused to recant their oaths or affiliation to the movement. Physical and psychological abuse were used to 'break' detainees, so they could be 'rehabilitated' and moved out of the concentration camp pipeline and back to Kikuyu reservations.Caroline Elkins, 'Imperial Reckoning: The Untold Story of Britain's Gulag in Kenya',(2005), pages 344-353 Once the inquiry findings were made public, the opposition members in the House of Commons called for a debate. Increasing adverse publicity and calls for further investigations of human rights abuses in the camps lead to a reduction in UK governmental support for the Kenya Colony's administration, and resulted in accelerated moves towards Kenyan independence. As recently as 2016Kimathi & Ors -v- The Foreign & Commonwealth Office Kenyans were still seeking compensation for British Mau Mau torture. After the Hola massacre the name of Hola was changed to Galole by the Colonial Government so that this cruel episode would be forgotten. In 1971, in a bid to revive African history, President Kenyatta ordered that Galole revert to its original name. Kenyatta gave this order after he met with a large delegation from Tana River. Since then it is again known as Hola. Daily Nation, 24 August, 1971 and Ojwando Abuor, C. (1972), White Highlands No More. Pan Africa Researchers: 226. Some of the early accounts do not even mention this incident, partly because many of the early accounts are either British government- or colonial-supported publications or secondary texts. Most of the secondary texts published during first decade or so after the Emergency were sympathetic to the British/Colonist/Loyalist point of view. Reactions and aftermath This statue honours the 11 Mau Mau who were clubbed to death at Hola The negative publicity put pressure on the British parliament to take action to salvage Britain's deteriorating image.

Although quadrotor helicopters and convertiplanes have long been flown experimentally, the configuration remained a curiosity until the arrival of the modern UAV or drone. The small size and low inertia of drones allows use of a particularly simple flight control system, which has greatly increased the practicality of the small quadrotor in this application. Design principles Each rotor produces both lift and torque about its center of rotation, as well as drag opposite to the vehicle's direction of flight. Quadcopters generally have two rotors spinning clockwise (CW) and two counterclockwise (CCW). Flight control is provided by independent variation of the speed and hence lift and torque of each rotor. Pitch and roll are controlled by varying the net centre of thrust, with yaw controlled by varying the net torque. Unlike conventional helicopters, quadcopters do not usually have cyclic pitch control, in which the angle of the blades varies dynamically as they turn around the rotor hub. In the early days of flight, quadcopters (then referred to either as 'quadrotors' or simply as 'helicopters') were seen as a possible solution to some of the persistent problems in vertical flight. Torque-induced control issues (as well as efficiency issues originating from the tail rotor, which generates no useful lift) can be eliminated by counter-rotation, and the relatively short blades are much easier to construct. A number of manned designs appeared in the 1920s and 1930s. These vehicles were among the first successful heavier-than-air vertical take off and landing (VTOL) vehicles. However, early prototypes suffered from poor performance, and latter prototypes required too much pilot work load, due to poor stability augmentation and limited control authority. Torque If all four rotors are spinning at the same angular velocity, with two rotating clockwise and two counterclockwise, the net torque about the yaw axis is zero, which means there is no need for a tail rotor as on conventional helicopters. Yaw is induced by mismatching the balance in aerodynamic torques (i.e., by offsetting the cumulative thrust commands between the counter-rotating blade pairs). File:Quadrotor yaw torque.pngSchematic of reaction torques on each motor of a quadcopter aircraft, due to spinning rotors. Rotors 1 and 3 spin in one direction, while rotors 2 and 4 spin in the opposite direction, yielding opposing torques for control. File:Quadrotorhover.svgA quadrotor hovers or adjusts its altitude by applying equal thrust to all four rotors. File:Quadrotoryaw.svgA quadrotor adjusts its yaw by applying more thrust to rotors rotating in one direction. File:Quadrotorpitch.svgA quadrotor adjusts its pitch or roll by applying more thrust to one rotor (or two adjacent rotors) and less thrust to the diametrically opposite rotor. Vortex ring state All quadcopters are subject to normal rotorcraft aerodynamics, including the vortex ring state. Mechanical structure The main mechanical components are a fuselage or frame, the four rotors (either fixed-pitch or variable-pitch), and motors. For best performance and simplest control algorithms, the motors and propellers are equidistant. Coaxial rotors coaxial OnyxStar FOX-C8 XT Observer from AltiGator In order to allow more power and stability at reduced weight, a quadcopter, like any other multirotor can employ a coaxial rotor configuration. In this case, each arm has two motors running in opposite directions (one facing up and one facing down). Operations=Autonomous flight The quadcopter configuration is relatively simple to program for autonomous flight. This has allowed experiments with complex swarming behaviour based on basic sensing of the adjacent drones. Endurance The longest flight time achieved by a battery-powered quadcopter was 2 hours, 31 minutes and 30 seconds. The record was set by Ferdinand Kickinger of Germany in 2016. In setting the record, Kickinger used low-discharge rate, high capacity Lithium Ion batteries and stripped the airframe of non-essential weight to reduce power draw and extend endurance.SPK Drones. How Quadcopters Fly. Alternative power sources like hydrogen fuel cells and hybrid gas- electric generators have been used to dramatically extend endurance because of the increased energy density of both hydrogen and gasoline, respectively.McNabb, Miriam (February 2018). US Manufacturer Harris Aerial Launches New Hybrid Gas Electric Drone. Dronelife History=Pioneers The first heavier-than-air aerodyne to take off vertically was a four-rotor helicopter designed by Louis Breguet. If was tested only in tethered flight and to an altitude of a few feet. In 1908 it was reported as having flown 'several times', although details are sparse. Etienne Oehmichen experimented with rotorcraft designs in the 1920s. Among the designs he tried, his helicopter No.2 had four rotors and eight propellers, all driven by a single engine. The Oehmichen No.2 used a steel-tube frame, with two-bladed rotors at the ends of the four arms. The angle of these blades could be varied by warping. Five of the propellers, spinning in the horizontal plane, stabilized the machine laterally. Another propeller was mounted at the nose for steering. The remaining pair of propellers functioned as its forward propulsion. The aircraft exhibited a considerable degree of stability and increase in control- accuracy for its time, and made over a thousand test flights during the middle 1920s. By 1923 it was able to remain airborne for several minutes at a time, and on April 14, 1924 it established the first-ever FAI distance record for helicopters of . It demonstrated the ability to complete a circular course\\"A Successful French Helicopter\\" Flight 24 January 1924 p47 and later, it completed the first closed-circuit flight by a rotorcraft. de Bothezat helicopter, 1923 photo :Dr. George de Bothezat and Ivan Jerome developed the de Bothezat helicopter, with six-bladed rotors at the end of an X-shaped structure. Two small propellers with variable pitch were used for thrust and yaw control. The vehicle used collective pitch control. Built by the US Air Service, it made its first flight in October 1922. About 100 flights were made by the end of 1923. The highest it ever reached was about . Although demonstrating feasibility, it was underpowered, unresponsive, mechanically complex and susceptible to reliability problems. Pilot workload was too high during hover to attempt lateral motion. Postwar era The Convertawings Model A Quadrotor was intended to be the prototype for a line of much larger civil and military helicopters. The design featured two engines driving four rotors through a system of v belts. No tail rotor was needed and control was obtained by varying the thrust between rotors. Flown many times from 1956, this helicopter proved the quadrotor design and it was also the first four- rotor helicopter to demonstrate successful forward flight. Due to a lack of orders for commercial or military versions however, the project was terminated. Convertawings proposed a Model E that would have a maximum weight of with a payload of over 300 miles and at up to . The Hanson Elastic Articulated (EA) bearingless rotor grew out of work done in the early 1960s at Lockheed California by Thomas F. Hanson, who had previously worked at Convertawings on the quadrotor's rotor design and control system. Curtiss- Wright VZ-7 The Curtiss-Wright VZ-7 of 1958 was a VTOL aircraft designed by Curtiss-Wright in competition for the US Army Transport and Research Command \\"flying jeep\\". The VZ-7 was controlled by changing the thrust of each of the four ducted fan rotors. The Piasecki PA-97 was a proposal for a large hybrid aircraft in which four helicopter fuselages were combined with a lighter-than- air airship in the 1980s. Current developments The Bell Boeing Quad TiltRotor concept takes the fixed quadcopter concept further by combining it with the tilt rotor concept for a proposed C-130 sized military transport. Flying prototype of the Parrot AR.Drone Parrot AR.Drone 2.0 take-off, Nevada, 2012 Airbus is developing a battery-powered quadcopter to act as an urban air taxi, at first with a pilot but potentially autonomous in the future. Drones In the last few decades, the quadcopter layout has become popular for small-scale unmanned aerial vehicles or drones. The need for aircraft with greater maneuverability and hovering ability has led to a rise in quadcopter research. The four-rotor design allows quadcopters to be relatively simple in design yet highly reliable and maneuverable. Research is continuing to increase the abilities of quadcopters by making advances in multi-craft communication, environment exploration, and maneuverability. If these developing qualities can be combined, quadcopters would be capable of advanced autonomous missions that are currently not possible with other vehicles. Around 2005 to 2010, advances in electronics allowed the production of cheap lightweight flight controllers, accelerometers (IMU), global positioning system and cameras. This resulted in the quadcopter configuration becoming popular for small unmanned aerial vehicles. With their small size and maneuverability, these quadcopters can be flown indoors as well as outdoors. For small drones, quadcopters are cheaper and more durable than conventional helicopters due to their mechanical simplicity. Their smaller blades are also advantageous because they possess less kinetic energy, reducing their ability to cause damage. For small-scale quadcopters, this makes the vehicles safer for close interaction. It is also possible to fit quadcopters with guards that enclose the rotors, further reducing the potential for damage. However, as size increases, fixed propeller quadcopters develop disadvantages relative to conventional helicopters. Increasing blade size increases their momentum. This means that changes in blade speed take longer, which negatively impacts control. Helicopters do not experience this problem as increasing the size of the rotor disk does not significantly impact the ability to control blade pitch. Due to their ease of construction and control, quadcopters are popular as amateur model aircraft projects.

The Court held that the Canadian Environmental Protection Act, a law for the purpose of protecting the environment, constituted criminal law and was upheld as valid federal legislation.  Background  Hydro-Qu√©bec allegedly dumped polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) into the St. Maurice River in Quebec in early 1990.  Reasons of the court  The majority reasons were written by Justice La Forest, and were joined by Justices L‚ÄôHeureux-Dube, Gonthier, Cory, and McLachlin. La Forest began by considering which head of power had authority over the \\"environment\\". He concluded that \\"environment\\" was not a distinct subject matter that could be allocated to either the province or the federal government, rather, it is a diffuse subject that can be divided among the two governments. La Forest considered the pith and substance of the Act. He found that the dominant feature of the Act was the \\"[protection] of the environment and human life and health from any and all harmful substances by regulating these substances.\\" La Forest then considered whether the Act constituted \\"criminal law\\", which is a federal matter under section 91(27) of the Constitution Act, 1867. He observed that criminal law must contain high level of mens rea for true crimes. Laws can be disguised (known as \\"colourable law\\") as criminal in order to intrude on provincial authority. La Forest stated that the test for \\"colourability\\" is whether the law has a \\"legitimate public purpose\\" that underlies the prohibition. He found that protection of the environment constituted such a legitimate purpose. It is a subject that has international implications yet it does not preclude the provinces from regulating in the matter along with the federal government. La Forest rejects Hydro-Qu√©bec's argument that the Act was merely a regulatory scheme and did not constitute criminal law. He noted that the Act \\"is an effective means of avoiding unnecessarily broad prohibitions and carefully targeting specific toxic substances.\\" The provisions of the Act are not directed at the general protection of the environment but rather targets to control dangerous and toxic substances. Regulations are needed because of the complexity of the subject and do not suggest a mere regulatory scheme.  Dissent  A dissenting opinion was written by Chief Justice Lamer and was joined by Justices Sopinka, Iacobucci, and Major. Lamer considered the conclusions of La Forest. He agreed that the protection of the environment, in the guise of health protection, was a valid criminal law purpose, however, he disagreed that the Act was for the purpose of protecting the environment. Lamer stated that the purpose of the Act was to regulate environmental pollution. He points to several provisions that suggest the Act is regulatory in nature. Sections 34 and 35, he notes, attempts to regulate environment and do not establish any prohibition that characterizes criminal law. The Act allows the Minister of the Environment discretion to prohibit certain substances from time to time, which Lamer finds to be a very odd way of enacting criminal law. As well, the provinces can be exempt from the Act if they have regulated their own similar law, even though provinces cannot enact criminal law. Lamer then considered whether the law would fall under \\"national dimension\\" of the federal peace, order and good government power. To apply the law must concern a \\"new\\" subject \\"must have a singleness, distinctiveness and indivisibility that clearly distinguishes it from matters of provincial concern and a scale of impact on provincial jurisdiction that is reconcilable with the fundamental distribution of legislative power under the Constitution\\" Lamer held that the definition of \\"toxic substances\\" was too broad to meet this test. It included not just substances that would cross boundaries, but also those that would not. Consequently, the matter could be regulated by the province and would fail the \\"provincial inability test\\" from R. v. Crown Zellerbach.

It is a bill reforming French copyright law, mostly in order to implement the 2001 Information Society Directive, which in turn implements a 1996 WIPO treaty. The law, despite being initially dismissed as highly technical and of no concern to the average person, generated considerable controversy when it was examined by the French Parliament between December 2005 and June 30, 2006, when it was finally voted through by both houses. Most of the bill focussed on the exchange of copyrighted works over peer-to-peer networks and the criminalizing of the circumvention of digital rights management (DRM) protection measures. Other sections dealt with other matters related to copyright, including rights on resale of works of art, copyright for works produced by government employees and exceptions to copyright for education and the handicapped, among other issues. The law was controversial within France because of fears that it could significantly hamper free software and might also significantly restrict the right to make copies of copyrighted works for private use. Some amendments to the bill, not present in the original version, would potentially require manufacturers to share their proprietary digital music formats with other software developers (by way of the need to provide the documentation necessary for interoperability). Because of this, a controversy arose with Apple Computer and associated US industry groups, who loudly protested in the US press; therefore, the DADVSI bill was sometimes referred to as the iTunes law or iPod law in the English-language press (see Interoperability and Apple controversy), although the law is not referred to in this way in France. Legal background The title of the DADVSI law refers to droit d'auteur et droits voisins (authors' rights and related rights). Authors' rights, in French law, have two components: * economic rights (droits patrimoniaux): the exclusive right of the author of a work of the mind to reveal this work according to his or her conditions (that is, for instance, by ceding this right to a publisher); * moral rights (droits moraux), such as: the right for the author to obtain redress against others claiming to be the author of the work; these rights cannot be ceded. This concept is reflected in the Berne Convention on Copyright. Copyright is a related concept, but pertains to Anglo-American common law; one notable difference is that copyright does not generally involve moral rights. The legal clauses governing authors' rights and related rights form the first book of the French Code of Intellectual Property (CPI). This article will thus refer to articles from this code as CPI Lnnn. The notion of 'author' extends to that of composer (of music), playwright, painter, photographer, etc., though the law makes it a requirement that the work should be original (or show some supplemental originality, in the case of a derived work) in order to be protected. In practice authors often cede their rights to publishers, who then enforce the \\"exclusive right\\" and some are members of societies that enforce their rights on their behalf. The latter is de facto nearly compulsory in case of songwriters and composers, almost all of whom are members of Sacem. Performers and publishers of audio recordings enjoy \\"related rights\\". These follow different rules and have a shorter duration than the rights of authors. In practice performers often cede their rights to publishers, or have them enforced by societies. The exclusive right of the author is not absolute. According to WIPO treaties, local legislation may make exceptions to exclusive copyrights only if these exceptions fulfill a \\"three-step test\\": limitations and exceptions * should only concern special cases; * should not conflict with a normal exploitation of the work; * should not unreasonably prejudice the legitimate interests of the right holder. This is how the US doctrine of fair use is justified with respect to copyright treaties for instance. The 2001 European Directive on Copyright proposes a list of 10 exceptions to copyright that member states can choose to implement or not, in addition to one whose implementation is compulsory (this makes an exception for temporary technical copies, meant to address Web caches and similar systems). Exceptions to copyright in French law are defined in CPI L122-5. Among them is the notable exception for private copies: French residents may freely make copies of works (except software) for their private use, and freely display those works within their family circle (which is interpreted to include friends), without the agreement of the copyright holder. However, French law includes a \\"tax on private copies\\" meant to address the losses incurred by copyright holders; this tax is levied on blank media (audio and video cassettes, CD's, DVD's, as well as memory and hard drives in portable media players). Normally taxation is reserved for legislation, a prerogative of the French Parliament, but a statute endowed an ad hoc commission to set the rates and conditions for this tax. European directives are generally not directly enforceable in EU member states. They first have to be transposed into local law, generally by an act of the legislature of the member state. While they give a general framework and impose some options they may leave significant leeway: in the case of EUCD, for instance, the directive gives a list of optional copyright exceptions, and mandates appropriate legal protection for DRMs, without defining what constitutes an appropriate protection. Member states have to transpose directives within reasonable delays, or they face action by the European Commission. There may be subsequent litigation before the European Court of Justice if subsequent the implementation is deemed to be inadequate. In March 2006, the Cour de cassation, France's highest court in civil and criminal matters, ruled in a decision nicknamed Mulholland Drive (from the name of a DVD involved). It quashed a decision by the appeals court of Versailles that ruled that Digital rights management techniques that contradicted the \\"right to private copy\\" were illegal. Legal scholars noted the following: * the manner in which the decision was presented indicated that it was a decision meant to establish doctrine (following the civil law tradition, French courts are theoretically prohibited from judging in the general case so as to establish case law, but in practice the Cour de cassation does so in certain decisions). * the decision cited the \\"test in three steps\\" and the yet untransposed European directive on copyright as source of doctrine, whereas, some legal scholars argue, it is up to the legislature to decide how to apply such principles when making law, not to the courts. In response an amendment was added to the DADVSI law by the National Assembly, which established a \\"right to the exception for private copy.\\" However, the scope of this right is unclear, since it was to be decided by a \\"college of mediators\\", but it was suppressed from the final text of the law. The crux of the discussion on private copy is the nature of this so-called \\"right\\". One can interpret it weakly, as an exception to the general possibility for copyright holders to prevent any unauthorized distribution of their work, or strongly, as a prohibition for copyright holders to use technical means to prevent private legal copies. The \\"three-step test\\" was also copied into article \\"1 bis\\"The article numbers refer to the numbering of the draft text. Because new articles were inserted, some article numbers are somewhat complex: \\"12 bis\\" refers to a new article after article 12 but before 13; \\"12 ter\\" appears after \\"12 bis\\" but before 13; \\"14 quater\\" appears after \\"14 ter\\" but before 15, etc. Following the vote, the articles were renumbered using strictly positive integers. of the draft law, which updates CPI L122-5. See Copyright exceptions. Politics The DADVSI law unexpectedly rose as a somewhat well-publicized topic in national French politics in December 2005 with the vote of the so-called \\"global license\\". Two major presidential candidates personally intervened in the controversy while others made declarations. Legislative process The initial draft of the law was proposed in 2003 by then Minister of Culture Jean-Jacques Aillagon (Union for a Popular Movement, UMP). Because of various circumstances, including the replacement of Aillagon by Renaud Donnedieu de Vabres (UMP), the bill was presented very late to the French Parliament and was initially to be examined in the National Assembly on December 20, 21 and 22, 2005 just before the Christmas holidays. The government (the cabinet of ministers, as represented by the Minister of Culture) had declared the law to be urgent, which means, under the Constitution of France, that the law would be examined only once by each house of Parliament; the reason given by the minister was that France was threatened by the European Commission with sanctions if it failed to implement the directive. Despite being initially presented as a technical text the law became hotly controversial. It became perceived as criminalising Internet users for sending files of copyrighted works to each other, as well as being a threat to free software. It was also feared that it would mean, in practice, the end to the right of creating a \\"private copy\\": for instance, making a copy of a record onto digital magnetic tape for the private use of the owner of the record, which is currently authorized by CPI L122-5. .On March 14, 2006, on behalf of the National Assembly law commission deputy Christian Vanneste (UMP) took out the only amendment which would have permitted at least one copy, for private usage, of works that had been legally acquired (CD's, DVD's etc.) This withdrawal of the amendment was presented as in accordance with a recent court decision from the Cour de cassation stating that copying DVDs for private use was not an automatic right. This decision cited the not-yet-transposed directive and the \\"test in three steps\\" from the WIPO treaties rather a \\"college of mediators\\", composed in part of judges, would examine each issue on a case-to-case basis. See The examination of the draft law by the National Assembly, initially seen as a quick matter preceding the Christmas break, was marred by several incidents, the best known being the vote on the first amendment of the \\"global license\\" (see below). Supplemental sittings of the Assembly had to be allotted in March in order for the law to be fully examined. An important factor was that the schedule of full sittings of the Assembly or the Senate is almost entirely decided by the executive. Prior to the examination of the law by the assembly in session, the draft bill had been sent to the Commission of Law, without any review by the Commission of Cultural Affairs, as would have been expected of a text presented by the Minister of Culture pertaining to artistic works; this procedure was deplored by some deputies. Deputy Christian Vanneste was commissioned to report on the law. Deputies from the opposition (French Socialist Party, PS, French Communist Party, PCF, Greens) as well as the junior majority coalition partner Union for French Democracy (UDF) expressed their opposition to such a highly complex law being rushed through Parliament. On December 21 they supported a motion sending the draft law back for examination in parliamentary commission. However, the Minister of Culture opposed the move stating that he hoped that the \\"solid parliamentarians from UMP\\" would not vote for the motion ‚Äî a move interpreted as a quasi-order to the deputies from his party not to vote for the motion. An amended draft law was approved by the National Assembly on March 21, 2006, by 296 votes for, 193 against. The UMP (right-wing), which has the absolute majority at the National Assembly, voted in favour, while the left voted against it. MPs of the center-right UDF voted either against the text or abstained. The Senate sent the bill before the Commission of Cultural Affairs who commissioned Senator Michel Tholli√®re to report on it. The Commission heard Minister de Vabres on April 4 and recommended a number of amendments. The Senate then examined the law in session on May 4, 9 and 10, 2006, and adopted a number of amendments. There was still considerable uncertainty on the future of the bill. Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin had the choice between letting the text go back before the National Assembly, then before the Senate for another round of examination or maintaining that the text was urgent and sending it before a mixed commission from both houses of the French Parliament to draft a compromise version to be sent to both houses to be voted upon, with the Assembly being able to have a final say. Minister of Culture Donnedieu de Vabres had promised that he would have the law sent for another reading by both houses if the differences between the texts adopted by the Assembly and the Senate were too great. He contended that those differences between the texts were small enough that the text could be sent before a mixed commission; however, some members of Parliament disagreed. The bill was rumored to be scheduled to be examined by the mixed commission on May 30, but in the end it was not. On June 15, 2006, despite the request by 20 UMP deputies that the text should be sent to the National Assembly again, the government announced that it would send the bill before the mixed commission on June 22. The text will then be sent before both houses for final approval. On June 22, in the morning, the mixed commission met. However, the Socialist members soon quit, claiming that the commission was a parody of democracy after discovering during the meeting 55 amendments hardening the Senate text. Both houses of Parliament finally approved the bill on June 30, the last day of the Parliamentary session. UMP voted in favour, the Communists and Socialists against, and UDF split over it between those voting against and those abstaining from voting. Socialist deputy Patrick Bloche defended a motion of inadmissibility, claiming that the law was unconstitutional and thus that the Assembly had to refuse it; Communist deputies and president of the UDF Fran√ßois Bayrou announced that they supported the motion. The motion was voted down, predictably, because the UMP ruling party had an absolute majority in the Assembly. On July 7, 2006, the Socialist deputies, 3 Green deputies, 4 Communist deputies, 2 UDF deputies (Fran√ßois Bayrou, president of UDF, and Herv√© Morin, head of the UDF group in the Assembly) filed a recourse before the Constitutional Council. This recourse blocked the signing of the law: the Council has one month to decide on the constitutionality of the law except if the Government claims urgency, in which case it has eight days. The recourse included the following claims of lack of constitutionality, based on the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen: * the clarity and sincerity of the legislative process were jeopardized by ** the government withdrawing article 1 after amendments that it disapproved were voted down; ** the mixed parliamentary commission significantly introducing amendments that were neither in the Assembly nor in the Senate text; * a number of clauses of the law that infringed on the rights of citizens: ** the definition of some crimes being unclear, whereas citizens should be able to understand what is a crime and what is not: *** exceptions to copyright were restricted by the Berne three-step test in a vague manner. These were now part of French law but ordinary citizens could only guess how to interpret this test, though copyright infringement was a crime; *** computer programs \\"manifestly designed for spreading copyrighted works\\" were criminalized, but no definition was given as to what this means, and the exceptions to this prohibition were also vaguely defined, thus citizens could not know whether such and such program was illegal or not; *** the voted text of the law admits \\"interoperability\\" as a valid goal for exemption from the prohibition of circumvention of DRM protection measures, but, unlike earlier drafts, did not define the word; ** no guarantee was given as to the modes of proof and investigation of the crimes defined in the law. After the decision of the Constitutional Council the law was submitted to President Jacques Chirac for signature on August 1, 2006. Political importance \\"Sorry, we have to take you away. No more than two ears for each CD bought...\\" \\"Your DRM key is invalid for lullaby #31\\" At first sight, the DADVSI law was not meant to be a disputed legal text: it dealt with fairly technical legal points. It was, however, turned into a political hot topic featured in major newspapers and on national television. The first draft of the DADVSI law criminalized peer-to-peer exchanges of copyrighted works (or, more precisely, copyrighted works whose licenses did not allow such exchanges). The case was made in Parliament that millions of French Internet users, especially among the young, currently traded files on computer networks and that it was thus unrealistic to turn them into felons. Since subsequent reading coincided with the examination of a controversial youth workforce clause known as the CPE, the opposition argued that the government was at war with the youth. The DADVSI law was used as a platform for various groups or parties for demonstrating opposition to the government policies: * Deputies for the opposition French Socialist Party supported an alternative scheme known as the \\"global license\\", despite the party's divisions on the issue. They denounced the government as repressive, especially against the younger population. * Fran√ßois Bayrou, president of the center-right party Union for French Democracy (UDF), formerly inside the ruling coalition, used the opportunity to distance itself from the policies of the Union for a Popular Movement (UMP) ruling party. He denounced the parliamentary process that produced the law, which, he claimed, was forced through Parliament under the influence of the executive and lobbies. * Nicolas Dupont-Aignan, a eurosceptic member of the UMP majority party, distanced himself from the policies of the government and opposed an \\"unenforceable law\\". * Christine Boutin, a member of the UMP majority party and former presidential candidate (2002 French presidential election), with a political platform oriented towards \\"family values\\", claimed that it was absurd to turn millions of young people (and possibly, 'some parliamentarians') into criminals. Lobbying Some members of the French parliament, as well as other observers, publicly decried the intense lobbying by various groups and industries. Bernard Carayon, UMP deputy for the Tarn d√©partement, denounced lobbying, pressures and even blackmail on the part of certain groups on national TV. A number of parliamentarians said they had never seen such intense lobbying from all sides, including a grassroot effort from Internet users and free software advocates which inundated them with letters and emails. At one point, Senator Michel Charasse demanded that parliamentary staff clean out corridors of loitering lobbyists.Frenzied Lobbying Over 'iPod Law' Rattles French Legislators, Thomas Crampton, International Herald Tribune Alain Suguenot, a supporter of the global license, UMP deputy for the C√¥te-d'Or d√©partement, hinted that some groups or societies supporting events had threatened to withdraw their support for events in the constituencies of deputies voting in favour of the global license. Suguenot, who is also mayor of the town of Beaune, indicated that his town would no longer support a cinema festival and would replace it by something related to computing and Internet technologies. Minister of Culture Renaud Donnedieu de Vabres was criticized for being too close to some industry groups. * At the beginning of the DADVSI discussion in December, Donnedieu de Vabres organised a demonstration of commercial music download platforms inside a room of the National Assembly, where deputies were given a free account with a ‚Ç¨10 credit. Opposition deputy Christian Paul denounced this action and the demonstration was shut by president of the Assembly Jean-Louis Debr√©, who indicated that though he had authorized the demonstration he had not authorized it to go in this manner. * According to the Odebi league, a pressure group defending French Internet users, some aides of Donnedieu de Vabres had strong links to industry groups. In response, some, such as Pascal Rogard from SACD, denounced the League as a specialist in ad hominem attacks. Some amendments to the law (150/151, 267) were labeled by some parliamentarians and others as the \\"Vivendi Universal amendments\\", because they were allegedly inspired by the entertainment giant. The free software advocate group EUCD.info denounced the fact that the lobbyist for an industry group was allowed into the \\"four column hall\\", a room in the Assembly building whose access is normally restricted to deputies and journalists. Confusion Minister Donnedieu de Vabres was criticized by parliamentarians for lack of preparation. For instance, Fran√ßois Bayrou, head of the center-right UDF party, criticised how the minister submitted a last minute pair of amendments of seven pages completely changing the criminal penalty system applicable to illegal copies of copyrighted material, and for creating a de facto \\"police of the Internet\\". He pointed out that modifications of such an importance should be examined in commission. On January 3, 2006, in his yearly speech of wishes addressed to the President of the Republic, president of the National Assembly Jean-Louis Debr√© (UMP) denounced the usage by the government of the procedure of urgency, which he claimed was used excessively often. He also denounced how the government frequently sent hastily redacted draft laws to Parliament then had to send amendments in order to correct its own texts. Specifically mentioning DADVSI he deplored how the government had sent two four-page amendments in the middle of the examination of the text, alluding to the same amendments that Bayrou had denounced. In its March 15, 2006, edition, the Canard Encha√Æn√© investigative weekly reported that Debr√© had complained that Donnedieu de Vabres was \\"a zero, who put us in the shit and, from the start, dragged us into an adventure\\". Protests and Internet actions May 7, 2006, march The EUCD.info group ran an Internet petition, which, by June 2006, garnered more than 170,000 signatures. Groups opposed to clauses in the law organised a variety of protests. The StopDRM group organised flash mobs. Various groups organized a march against new French copyright law on May 7, 2006, as the bill was at the Senate; the March ended with flowers being laid in memory of authors' rights. Unrolling of the signature list near the offices of the French Prime Minister On June 9, 2006, a delegation including Richard M. Stallman, president of the Free Software Foundation, went to the Hotel Matignon to meet prime minister Dominique de Villepin, however, the prime minister and his advisors refused to meet them. The delegation protested the fact that they were turned away while business leaders such as Bill Gates from Microsoft got official reception. They laid down the list of 165,000 signatories of the EUCD.info petition in the gutter, as a sign of what they saw as contempt for the concerns of ordinary citizens. Richard Stallman speaking against DADVSI at Paris, capitale du libre On June 26, Stallman spoke against DADVSI at a free software business meeting organized by the City of Paris (Paris, capitale du Libre); on June 28, he met presidential candidate S√©gol√®ne Royal. The Odebi league campaigned against politicians who they claim supported the positions of the \\"major\\" record corporations. A campaign of Google bombing was made against Minister Donnedieu de Vabres: searching Google for ministre (minister) or blanchisseur (launderer) resulted in a news article about the conviction of Donnedieu de Vabres for money laundering. Repression of Internet copying of copyrighted works The DADVSI law contains a number of articles meant to suppress the copying of copyrighted music or videos through peer-to-peer networks over the Internet. The initial version of the bill punished most acts related to illegal copying of copyrighted material, including working around anti-copy systems, as a felonyfelony is used a translation of the French d√©lit: roughly, a broad category of crimes, such as theft, punishable by prison sentences not exceeding 10 years, but not including petty crimes counterfeiting, with a maximum sentence of 3 years in prison and/or a ‚Ç¨300,000 fine. However, a number of parliamentarians contended that this was equivalent to criminalizing millions of Internet users, especially the young, and Minister Donnedieu de Vabres immediately introduced amendments known as \\"escalation\\": peer-to-peer users who copy files illegally would first be warned, then fined, with stronger penalties for repeat offenders. Finally, the choice was made to criminalize authors and publishers of software capable of unlocking copy protection system or copying copyrighted works over the Internet, while users would receive much softer penalties. Sharing of copyrighted works over peer-to-peer networks In the current state of the law, CPI L335-2 and L335-5 punish as counterfeiting the act of publishing copyrighted works without the authorization of the rights holders, with a maximum sentence of 3 years in prison and/or a ‚Ç¨300,000 fine. Whether or not sharing files over a peer-to-peer network falls within the scope of this prohibition has been controversial. Some groups, such as the Audionautes, have contended that the act of receiving copyrighted works from Internet sites or peer-to-peer networks is an act of private copying, which is a valid exemption from copyright rules, following from CPI L122-5. Courts have ruled in both directions, some convicting peer-to-peer users, others acquitting them. Article 14 bis of the DADVSI law explicitly exempts from this regime the act of downloading a copyrighted work on a peer-to-peer network. This exemption is further extended to the act of making some copyrighted work available to the public without any commercial purpose, when this is an automatic result of the use of a peer-to-peer network for obtaining it; this clause was added because many peer-to-peer networks automatically make downloaded content available to other users, thus merely exempting downloads from the counterfeiting felony would not have been sufficient. These acts, exempted from the counterfeiting felony charge, would still fall under a lesser charge, with a fine to be defined by a decree (executive decision). Minister Donnedieu de Vabres has announced a ‚Ç¨38 fine for downloading acts, but it is yet unknown whether this would apply to any single file (thus a person with 1000 songs downloaded illegally could in theory owe a fine of ‚Ç¨38,000) or whether several downloads could be punished with a single fine. Supporters of the global licence such as Patrick Bloche have pointed out that fines would go into the state budget and would thus not benefit artists financially. The \\"global license\\" In 2005, an alternative proposal to the original draft law was proposed. Instead of criminalising peer-to-peer file sharing, the proposal would have made peer-to-peer exchanges legal, in exchange for a fee on broadband Internet subscriptions. The fee would go have gone to fund the artists and authors. This is known as the \\"global license\\" or \\"legal license\\". The \\"legal license\\" was promoted by the alliance public- artistes (\\"public / artists alliance\\"), composed of: * consumers' associations (UFC Que Choisir and others) * Internet users associations (Association des audionautes‚Ä¶) * family associations * musical performer rights societies (ADAMI, SPEDIDAM) * musical performer associations * other artists' associations. It was backed by a number of politicians, both on the left (members of the French Socialist Party such as Patrick Bloche and Christian Paul) and on the right (members of the UMP such as Christine Boutin and Alain Suguenot), who defended it in the National Assembly. It was defended in the National Assembly, but not the Senate, by parliamentarians from the French Socialist Party, the Greens, and the French Communist Party. No specific amount of fee was discussed in the law, but it was meant to be approximately ‚Ç¨7 per month for a broadband connection. French broadband connections typically cost ‚Ç¨30 a month for rates up to 16 megabits per second, digital TV and unlimited VoIP phone calls. Proponents of the law contended that: * The global license is a realistic measure in the long run. Internet users will use peer-to-peer networks anyway and there are already millions of peer-to-peer users so it's unreasonable to claim that they will be prosecuted. Instead of trying to revert this trend it would be better to tax it. * The alternative to this is heavy-handed enforcement and intrusive Digital rights management (DRMs). * The global license would provide a steady stream of revenue to authors and artists. Opponents contended that: * The global license is a communist measure, while DRMs allow fine-grained, individual, remuneration of artists. * There is no reliable method for apportioning the money raised through this method to artists. If polling methods are used, they may miss smaller artists. * The global license is contrary to the \\"test in three steps\\" that must be verified by every exception to copyright. * The global license would fail to provide enough revenue to authors and artists. In the evening sitting of the Assembly on December 21, the first of the series of amendments establishing the global license (identical amendments 153 as proposed by UMP deputy Alain Suguenot and 154 as proposed by deputies from the French Socialist Party) was voted by a 30-to-28 margin, much to the dismay of Culture Minister Donnedieu de Vabres. This was the first time that a legislature anywhere had supported an alternative compensation system to broadly legalize P2P file sharing. The global license proved difficult to handle for the government. It was initially thought that the minister would request another examination of the controversial amendment by the Assembly; however, the head of the UMP group in the assembly, Bernard Accoyer, stated that the French Parliament had demonstrated that it was not a chambre d'enregistrement (a chamber for registering the wishes of the executive) and pointed out that the text was only at the beginning of its examination by Parliament, which has two houses, which seemed to suggest that he expected the amendment to be struck down in the Senate. The examination of the text by the National Assembly resumed in March. The Minister of Culture announced that the government would use its prerogative to withdrawn its own draft law in order to withdraw article 1 of the law, which was the article to which amendments 153/154 applied, and propose in its stead a \\"1 bis\\" article. This move was supported by President of the National Assembly Jean-Louis Debr√©, who exceptionally presided the sitting; Debr√© cited precedent for such actions to deputies questioning the constitutionality of the action. However, the next day, the government announced that it would not withdraw the article, following from a communication by president of the Constitutional Council Pierre Mazeaud that the move's constitutionality was unclear. The Assembly then proceeded with the remaining amendments to article 1, then, expectedly, voted down article 1, then examined article \\"1 bis\\". The \\"global license\\" was thus removed from the text, and did not make it into the final version of the law that was put into place. However, an Internet access provider named 9 Telecom did implement a similar idea, by providing unlimited downloadable music, protected by DRM, from the Universal catalog to its subscribers; without legal problems as 9 Telecom belongs to Universal. Criminalisation of DRM circumvention Articles 13 and 14 of the law introduced a variety of criminal penalties for those working around DRM technical measures: * A fine up to ‚Ç¨3,750 is applicable for those who knowingly work around a DRM technical measure for reasons other than research, if this is not done using means procured from others. * Prison sentences up to 6 months and/or fines up to ‚Ç¨30,000 are applicable for those who supply others with means to work around technical measures, or who knowingly propose such means. * Lesser fines will be subsequently introduced by an executive decree. However, none of these penalties apply when the purpose of circumvention was computer security or research. This last clause, exempting circumvention from penalties when it is done for certain purposes, was kept by a narrow 11-10 margin in the Senate. Interoperability and Apple controversy The DADVSI law grants legal protection to digital rights management \\"technical protection methods\\" (defined in article 7); that is, it contains clauses criminalizing circumvention of DRMs (articles 13 and 14). The initial draft law was heavily criticized for the vagueness and wide scope of the anti-circumvention clauses. It was feared that: * These clauses could potentially outlaw any free software capable of reading DRM-using formats (music, video, or even text content); the fear was that free software implementing DRM would be construed as facilitating circumvention. Designers of software knowingly facilitating circumvention would, with the initial draft, face felony charges of counterfeiting with a maximum penalty of a ‚Ç¨300,000 fine and/or three years in prison. Free software advocates thus concluded that the law would have a chilling effect on the development of free software in France, since any modern desktop system is supposed to be able to read music and video content, and their designers could not be sure whether they would face felony charges. * These clauses would allow designers of DRM systems to have competitors prosecuted by claiming that these competitors' systems facilitated circumvention of DRMs. This would, in effect, create a new kind of intellectual property in addition to copyright and patents. However the purpose of the law was to protect the copyright of composers, artists, film- makers etc. and not grant new legal protections to DRM companies. * These clauses would tie people to the provider of the music, since the DRM system of a music provider would only work with the players from this provider. This would in turn be an annoyance to customers, since content from one device would not be playable on another. * The clauses would prevent investigation of possible security lapses in DRM systems, such as when Sony's Extended Copy Protection system was found to create computer security problems. Since the personal computing software industry in France is heavily dominated by a few companies (such as Microsoft and Apple Computer), which also provide DRM systems, it was feared that the law would reinforce these dominant positions and prevent competition from free software. Politicians across all French political parties have declared free software to be important for France, since it provides competition in a field dominated by extra-European corporations. It is officially considered instrumental in controlling the IT expenses of public administrations. Accordingly, a number of free software organizations (Free Software Foundation France, EUCD.info, Framasoft, APRIL, AFUL‚Ä¶) lobbied that the DADVSI law should not act as a de facto prohibition on making free software capable of reading formats protected by DRMs, including video and music, and thus making free operating systems unsuitable for personal use. They also noted that copyrighted works also include text, that formats such as PDF also have DRMs, and thus that the law could well exclude free software from desktop processing, since it could perhaps not read the same file formats as the main desktop suites. Those associations argued that criminal law should not reinforce network effects and the practice of tying sales (vente li√©e), that is, making it compulsory to buy one good or service to be able to buy another good of service, without a legitimate motive, which is prohibited by French law (Consumption code, L122-1). They argued that music and electronic equipment capable of playing it are separate products and that the sale of one should not be tied to that of the other. Politicians from several parties (among whom Alain Carayon and Richard Cazenave from the ruling right-wing UMP, Fran√ßois Bayrou, president of the center-right UDF) pushed amendments aimed at ensuring interoperability of DRM systems. These amendments were adopted by the Assembly at the very end of its reading of the law, on the night of March 16 to March 17. These amendments stated that: * Providers of DRM systems should provide the necessary technical documentation to any party needing it to ensure that interoperability. In practice, this would mean that makers of software or hardware players could request information from providers of DRM-protected music or video in order for that music or video to be playable on their systems. * The publication of the source code or technical documentation of systems implementing DRMs is not prohibited by the protection granted to DRMs. It is unclear, though, whether these clauses would apply to DRM providers who not choose to avail themselves of the specific legal protection that the law grants to DRMs. That is, it is unknown at this point whether a licence agreement clause claiming that no part of a system, format or protocol is deemed to implement a DRM could exempt DRM providers from having to provide interoperability information. These clauses proved controversial, mostly in the US press, where analyses provided by various interest groups claimed that they were directed at Apple's iTunes platform and their iPod players; some news sources even went as far as to nickname the DADVSI law the \\"French iTunes law\\". Some analysts claimed that they could force Apple to shut down iTunes for French customers, because Apple's business model ties iTunes content to the iPod player using the DRM system and the French market comprises a relatively small portion of Apple's overall sales. Apple claimed that the French copyright law amounted to \\"state-sponsored piracy\\". According to Apple, the proposed legislation would increase copyright piracy by making it easier for copyright pirates to download songs from iTunes in a generic format and then endlessly copy them for other users (the iTunes format, being proprietary, is more difficult to transfer to other media). US Secretary of Commerce declared that he would look into the French law This declaration supported the claims by free-software advocates and politicians who said that the protection of DRM initially envisioned would benefit makers of DRM systems by enabling them to prosecute competitors as facilitating piracy. Finally, US Secretary of Commerce Carlos Gutierrez declared that it would look at the law closely and support intellectual property rights, a comment widely interpreted to be supportive of Apple. The reaction from Apple and the US government was highly controversial in France. The Odebi league, a citizen's action group defending the rights of Internet users, told Apple to \\"mind its business and not meddle into the French legislative process\\" and pointed out that \\"if Apple wishes to do business in France, it has to respect the rights that the French enjoy\\"; the league also issued a communiqu√© titled Guterriez go home. Deputy Christian Paul published a communiqu√© meant to explain the intents of French lawmakers to Americans, without the media filtering. Christian Paul criticized the French government for making so much effort to please Apple: :When Apple coughs, we now know that Paris sneezes [...] Apple has assured itself control over channels of distribution and sales by imposing a proprietary format. Representatives from Apple were heard by the Senate Commission for Cultural affairs. The Commission subsequently recommended that the interoperability provisions should be substantially reworked, and proposed amendments, most of which were adopted by the Senate. A notable exception is that the Senate rejected (by 11 votes against 10) an amendment from the Commission which suppressed the right to work around DRMs for reasons of interoperability. The text from the Senate introduces an administrative authority capable of adjudicating the possibility of reading DRM contents in order to achieve interoperability. Article 7 bis A introduced a loophole for designers of technical measures of protection who do not desire to share them for interoperability. It states that the mission of this administrative authority is to prevent lack of interoperability and other limitations when these are not desired by the copyright holder. It thus seems possible that designers of technical measures can work around the interoperability requirement by showing that lack of interoperability was desired by the copyright holders. The \\"Vivendi Universal\\" amendments Some amendments, adopted by both houses of Parliament, introduce civil and criminal responsibility for authors of software used for illicit copying of protected works. These amendments are widely known as the \\"Vivendi Universal\\" or \\"VU\\" amendments; that terminology was used by some members of Parliament, the reason for it being that, allegedly, these amendments were strongly pushed by Vivendi Universal, a major entertainment corporation. According to the Odebi League and EUCD.info, these amendments were unofficially supported by president of the ruling UMP party and presidential candidate Nicolas Sarkozy. They ended up making up articles 12 bis and 14 quarter of the text adopted by the Senate. Article 12 bis introduced criminal penalties (up to 3 years in prison and/or a fine of up to ‚Ç¨300,000) for people who knowingly make available software \\"manifestly\\" meant to transmit copyrighted works illegally, or who knowingly incite to the use of such software. A number of commentators doubt the constitutionality of this article, because of the uncertainty introduced by the word \\"manifestly\\" for defining an incrimination; they also contend that this article amounts to making authors of software criminally responsible for the actions of others (users) that they do not control. Article 14 quarter made it possible for right holders to obtain court injunctions ordering makers of software mainly used for illegal transmissions of copyrighted works to implement whatever technical measures that can prevent this usage, as long as they do not change the nature of the software. A register of copyrighted works is made available in order to help in the effective implementation of those measures. This article could make it mandatory to implement technologies such as SNOCAP into peer-to-peer transmission programs, as proposed by Sylvie Forbin from Vivendi Universal. A related amendment, making up article 14 ter A, mandated that Internet users should \\"secure\\" their Internet connection so that it is not used for transmitting copyrighted works illegally; Internet service providers are supposed to provide users with the suitable technology. This measure may be targeted at peer-to-peer users claiming that their WiFi connection was hijacked, but it may also result in forcing all users to install anti-virus and filtering software on their machines. Copyright exceptions Droit d'auteur (the Author's rights) is an exclusive right of the author. However, there exist in French law a number of legal exceptions to this exclusive right, somewhat similar to the US notion of fair use. These are listed in CPI L122-5, and article 1/1 bis of the DADVSI law alters these exceptions. The law first expands the exceptions: * It introduces an exception for education, starting from January 1, 2009: it allows the representation or the reproduction of short works or extracts of works not meant for commercial use if the following conditions are meant: ** these are used solely for purposes of illustration of analysis within education and research, excluding all recreational activity ** the public is strictly restricted to a majority of pupils, students, teaching and research staff directly concerned ** no commercial use is made ** a negotiated remuneration compensates these uses for copyright holders. * It explicitly allows for transitory and technical reproductions, e.g. web caches. * It allows specialized facilities for the handicapped to freely reproduce and represent works, e.g. by making audio recordings, Braille versions. The electronic files used for such works may be deposited at an administration for safekeeping. * It allows public libraries, museums and archives to freely reproduce works for purposes of conservation or preservation of onsite consultation. * It allows the information press to freely show a reproduction of a work of art (sculpture, painting, architecture‚Ä¶) ** for purposes of immediate information, ** if the work of art is directly in relation with the information ** provided that the author is clearly identified ** excluding works that themselves aim at reporting information (so a newspaper cannot claim to be able to copy freely press photographs) ** within reasonable bounds (number of illustration, format). However, article 1/1 bis also introduces the Berne three-step test directly into French law: :The exceptions enumerated within this article cannot hamper the normal exploitation of the work, neither can they cause an undue loss to the legitimate interests of the author. This clause is highly controversial. Members of the opposition such as Patrick Bloche have argued that the Berne three-step test may be imposed onto states, so that their legislation conforms to the test, but not onto individual citizens. They argue that the vagueness of this test makes it impossible for citizens to know what is allowed and what is disallowed, whereas counterfeiting of copyright works may be a felony offense, and thus that the law is unconstitutional because it is unintelligible. (In December 2005, the Constitutional Council of France declared clauses in a tax bill to be unconstitutional because they were unintelligible. ) A notable exception has been raised by the General Prosecutor of Paris, who allowed bank FINAMA (part of the French insurer GROUPAMA) to scupper a $200 million software piracy trial for the sake of bank secrecy. In France, the Cour de Cassation and an Appeal Court have dismissed an EUR 520 million software piracy case, ruling that U.S. Copyright certificates were not providing any protection and that software sold by its author during a decade in more than 140 countries does not deserve the \\"originality\\" criteria because it was \\"banal\\", prior art in the market segment being already available . In the light of this judicial decision, the jurisprudence is unclear as there is little software able to claim being the first of its kind. Other contents of the law The main focus of the law is DRMs and repression of peer-to-peer usage, but some other issues related to copyright were also included: * Title II of the law clarifies the copyright regime over works of employees of the State or local governments; * Title III toughens regulations over societies collecting money on behalf of copyright holders, and creates some tax credit for record companies; * Title IV changes procedures for the \\"legal deposit\\" of works; * Title V changes certain rules pertaining to the resale of works of art and remuneration of the artist, known as droit de suite.

He presented the initial draft of the text, as well as numerous amendments, on behalf of the gouvernement.

President of the UDF party, he famously stood against the creation of a \\"police of the Internet\\", against measures decried as harmful to free software, and in favour of the right to make private copies. The press commented that this was a way for Bayrou and the UDF to distance itself from the ruling UMP party, despite not formally being in the opposition. *** Jean Dionis du S√©jour and Christophe Baguet were the reporters for the UDF party on the proposed law; they had a somewhat different perspective than Bayrou's. ** PS (centre-left / left - opposed on the March 21, 2006 and June 30, 2006 votes) *** Christian Paul *** Patrick Bloche *** Didier Mathus **Greens (left - opposed on the March 21, 2006 and June 30, 2006 votes) *** Martine Billard ** PCF (left - opposed on the March 21, 2006 and June 30, 2006 votes) *** Fr√©d√©ric Dutoit * Other personalities ** Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin (UMP): declared the law to be urgent, convene the mixed commission, and proposed the bill for a final vote. ** President of the UMP party Nicolas Sarkozy ‚Äî following from the disagreements inside his own party, organized a \\"round table\\" so as to decide on a common position for his party.

It serves Roseville and the surrounding communities of Arden Hills, Falcon Heights, Lauderdale, Little Canada, Maplewood, and Shoreview. RAHS is the only comprehensive public high school in Roseville Area School District 623. History RAHS occupies the site of a high school known as Alexander Ramsey High School. In 1986 Ramsey High School and Frank B. Kellogg High School merged because of declining enrollment at both schools. The new high school used the facilities from the Ramsey complex while the former Kellogg High School became Roseville Area Middle School. Plans originally called for the construction of a new high school (replacing both Ramsey and Kellogg) on district-owned land near Lake Owasso, but after the voter referendum on financing the proposed school failed, it became necessary to expand and remodel the existing Roseville Area High School instead. The land held by the school district was sold and the proceeds used to finance the construction at RAHS. The community built on the sold land is now known as Owasso Hills. During the 1986-87 school year RAHS operated on two campuses, with both East Campus (the former Kellogg site) and West Campus (formerly Ramsey) serving grades 9-12. From 1987 to 1997, RAHS had only 10th12th grades, with 9th grade at Roseville Area Middle School. On completion of the construction in fall 1997, the 9th grade was moved to RAHS.  Academics  RAHS operates on a trimester system and allows students to take a maximum of five credits each trimester. RAHS offers a variety of Advanced Placement (AP), College in the Schools (CIS), Honors, Connections and standard track curriculum. Advanced Placement AP offerings at RAHS include AP American government, AP Biology, AP Environmental Science, AP Calculus AB, AP Calculus BC, AP Chemistry, AP comparative government, AP Computer Science Principles, AP language & composition, AP literature & composition, AP European History, AP Human Geography, AP Microeconomics, AP Psychology, AP Physics 1, AP Statistics, AP Art History and AP Studio Art. The English, mathematics and social studies curricula include ninth and tenth grade level pre-AP courses. In 2007, Roseville Area School District 623 received a $720,000 grant from the Minnesota Department of Education to expand AP and pre-AP programming in the district. College in the Schools College in the Schools (CIS) is a program run by the University of Minnesota that allows high school students to attain college credit while staying in their high school. The University of Minnesota CIS courses offered at RAHS are modern literature (ENGL 1001W) and Spanish (SPAN 1003, SPAN 1004). Post-Secondary Enrollment Options (PSEO) In addition to curriculum offered at RAHS, in accordance with state law, upperclassmen in good academic standing may choose to enroll in post-secondary courses at no cost. Students can apply part-time or full-time to a number of affiliated institutions, including Century College, Macalester College and the University of Minnesota. Credits earned at post-secondary institutions fulfill both high school and college credit requirements, and all high school graduation requirements must still be met. Sports and activities RAHS is a member of the Suburban East Conference. It provides students with many varsity athletic opportunities. Fall sports include boys and girls cross country, football, football cheerleading, boys and girls soccer, girls swimming and diving, girls tennis, and volleyball.

There are many genera with around 400 species worldwide, especially in the tropics and subtropics. Only 5 species of Mantispa occur in Europe.Asp√∂ck, Ulrike & Asp√∂ck, Horst (2010): Fauna Europaea ‚Äì Mantispidae. Version of 2010-DEC-23. Retrieved 2011-JAN-03. Description and ecology Head of a mantisfly in genus Plega About long and with a wingspan of , some mantidflies such as Climaciella brunnea, Euclimacia nodosa are wasp mimics, but most are brownish with green, yellow and sometimes red hues. The vernacular and scientific names are derived from their mantis-like appearance, as their spiny \\"raptorial\\" front legs are modified to catch small insect prey and are very similar to the front legs of mantids (the only difference is that the pincers lack footpads and are not used for walking at all). The adults are predatory insects that are often nocturnal, and are sometimes attracted by porch lights or blacklights. They are usually green, brown, yellow, and sometimes pink, and have four membranous wings which may sometimes be patterned (especially in wasp mimicking species) but are usually clear. Adult mantidflies are predators of suitably sized insects, which they catch as mantids do. However, the underlying mechanisms for the prey capture behavior are different in mantidflies and mantids.Kral, K (2013). Vision in the mantispid: a sit-and-wait and stalking predatory insect. Physiological Entomology 38: 1-12. Mantidflies are active hunters, but as with other Neuroptera, they are cumbersome fliers. Symphrasinae larvae are sedentary parasitoids on bee, wasp or scarab beetle larvae. Larvae of the Calomantispinae are predators of small arthropods, and in at least one species they are mobile. Mantispinae have the most specialized larval development among all mantidflies studied to date (the life history of the Drepanicinae remains unknown): their campodeiform larvae seek out female spiders or their egg sacs which they then enter; the scarabaeiform larvae then feed on the spider eggs, draining egg contents through a piercing/sucking tube formed by modified mandibles and maxillae, pupating in the egg sac. First-instar mantispids use two strategies to locate spider eggs: larvae may burrow directly through the silk of egg sacs they find, or they may board and be carried by female spiders prior to sac production (phoresy), entering the sac as it is being constructed. Mantispids that board spiders usually adopt positions on or near the pedicel; some species may enter the spider's book lungs. Larvae maintain themselves aboard spiders by feeding on spider hemolymph. Transfers of larvae from spider to spider are possible during spider mating or cannibalism. All of the major groups of hunting spiders are attacked by spider-boarding mantispids; the egg sacs of web-building species are also entered by egg-sac penetrators. Species unknown, Sydney Australia Systematics A Sagittalata species female from Kerala, India Among the Neuroptera (which includes lacewings and owlflies), mantidflies are apparently most closely related to the Dilaridae (pleasing lacewings) and the thorny (Rhachiberothidae) and beaded lacewings (Berothidae). These and the prehistoric Mesithonidae - probably a paraphyletic assemblage rather than a natural group - form the superfamily Mantispoidea. Many mantidflies are placed in one of the four subfamilies, of which the Symphrasinae are probably the most distinct and the Mantispinae are the most advanced. But a considerable number of taxa cannot be easily accommodated in this layout, and are therefore better treated as incertae sedis at present. Some fossil taxa may be of an altogether quite basal position, for example the Jurassic Liassochrysa (about 180 million years old) and Promantispa (about 155 million years old). The Early Jurassic Prohemerobius dilaroides (the type species of the \\"Prohemerobiidae\\" assemblage) as well as the Late Permian Permantispa emelyanovi (of the just as likely paraphyletic \\"Permithonidae\\") might also be very basal mantidflies. Most living genera from which fossil species are also known to go back to the Miocene; the Oligocene \\"Climaciella\\" henrotayi probably does not belong in the living genus. Two fossil species have been described as part of the extant genus Dicromantispa, Dicromantispa moronei from Dominican amber and Dicromantispa electromexicana from Mexican amber. The distinct Mesomantispa is often placed in a monotypic subfamily Mesomantispinae, but given its uncertain position due to no clearly related mantidflies having been found yet in the fossil record, this may well be premature. Basal and incertae sedis mantidfly genera are: The North American species include: Paraberotha, Retinoberotha and Whalfera were formerly placed here, but have since been recognized as Rhachiberothidae. Mantispidiptera are diminutive insects, apparently neuropterans of some sort, perhaps Hemerobiiformia; their exact affiliation cannot at present be determined because of their odd apomorphies, though they are unlikely to have been mantidflies.

The case concerned a constitutional challenge of the common law rule permitting the Crown to adduce evidence of an accused's insanity and section 542(2) of the Criminal Code, which allowed for the indeterminate detention of an accused who is found not guilty by reason of \\"insanity\\". The Court held that both the common law rule and the Code provision were unconstitutional. As a result, the Court created a new common law rule that was constitutional, and Parliament created new laws of what to do with individuals who were found not criminally responsible by reason of a mental disorder. The parties to the case were the appellant, Swain, the respondent, the Crown, and the following interveners: the Attorney General of Canada, the Lieutenant Governor's Board of Review of Ontario, the Canadian Disability Rights Council, the Canadian Mental Health Association, and the Canadian Association for Community Living. Background In October 1983, Owen Swain was arrested for attacking his wife and children in a bizarre manner, and was charged with assault and aggravated assault. Later at the trial for the charges, Swain's wife testified that Swain was \\"fighting the air\\" and talking about spirits. Swain testified that at the time of the incident, he believed that his wife and children were being attacked by devils, and that he had to protect them. On November 1, 1983, Swain was transferred from jail to a mental health centre, where he was observed to be acting in a bizarre manner. He was prescribed with antipsychotic medications, and his condition improved rapidly. Swain was granted bail, released into the community, and continued to take his medication and see a psychiatrist. Swain remained out of custody until the conclusion of his trial. Trial Swain's trial took place on May 3, 1985 in the District Court of Ontario (which later became part of what is now known as the Ontario Superior Court of Justice). Applying the appropriate common law rule at the time, the court allowed the Crown to adduce evidence of Swain's insanity at the time of the alleged offence, over defence counsel's objections. At the end of the trial, Swain was found not guilty by reason of insanity. As a result of the court's finding, the Criminal Code at the time required that the person be held in custody until the Lieutenant Governor of the Province (i.e. the executive branch of the provincial government) decides to release him. Defence counsel challenged the constitutionality of that provision, on the basis that it violated the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. On June 10, 1985, the trial judge found that the provisions were constitutional, and ordered that Swain be detained until the Lieutenant Governor's wishes were known. Subsequent detention Swain immediately filed for an appeal to the Court of Appeal for Ontario, and applied for bail pending appeal. The appeal judge hearing the bail application adjourned the application to permit an early hearing by the committee that advises the Lieutenant Governor concerning the detention of individuals found not guilty by reasons of insanity (the Advisory Review Board). On June 12, 1985, the Lieutenant Governor issued a warrant further detaining Swain to be held in safe custody in a mental health hospital for assessment, and to report to the Advisory Review Board in 30 days. Neither Swain nor his counsel were notified about the decision, or given an opportunity to make submissions. The review hearing was held on July 26, 1985, which Swain and his counsel were present at. On August 6, 1985, the Board advised that Swain be held in safe custody in a mental health centre, and that the director of the centre have discretion to allow Swain to re-enter the community with conditions regarding supervision and follow-up treatment. The recommendation was not initially released to Swain or his counsel. Swain's counsel requested to make submissions before the Lieutenant Governor at the time when the Board's recommendation was made, but before the Lieutenant Governor made a decision, the request was denied. The Lieutenant Governor issued a warrant for Swain to be held in custody with the conditions recommended by the Board. That was the first time Swain or his counsel were advised what the Board's recommendation was. Court of Appeal The appeal to the Court of Appeal was heard in early September, 1985. A majority of the Court dismissed Swain's appeal. Discharge On September 4, 1986, the Lieutenant Governor ordered that the warrant for Swain to be held in custody be vacated, and that Swain be discharged absolutely. Reasons of the Supreme Court of Canada Chief Justice Lamer wrote the majority opinion, allowing Swain's appeal. Two separate decisions concurring with the majority's final decision were released by Gonthier and Wilson JJ. The sole dissenting judge was L'Heureux-Dub√© J. Crown adducing evidence of insanity At the time of the case, Canadian common law allowed the Crown to adduce evidence of an accused person's insanity at the time of the alleged offence during the Crown's case over the objections of the accused. The majority found that a principle of fundamental justice required an accusatorial and adversarial criminal justice system, founded on respect for the autonomy and dignity of human beings. Therefore, the same principle required that an accused person has the right to control his or her own defence (assuming the person is found fit to stand for trial). The majority found that since the defence of insanity is an exemption to criminal liability, based on not being capable to form the criminal intent, it is a defence to the criminal charge, and therefore should not be interfered with by the Crown. The majority went on to find that if the Crown independently raised the defence of insanity, it could be inconsistent with the defence an accused person intends to rely on, putting the accused in a position of having to argue inconsistent defences. For example, the defence of insanity could be inconsistent with the defence of alibi. It could also undermine the accused's credibility with the jury, due to the stigma associated with the mentally ill. The majority also concluded that the accused's right to control their own defence is not an absolute right. For example, if an accused person puts their mental health at issue without going so far as to claim the defence of insanity, the Crown is entitled to \\"complete the picture\\". The majority agreed with the Crown that the principles of fundamental justice also required that a person who was insane at the time of an offence not be convicted of that offence. However, the majority found that still did not excuse breaching another principle of fundamental justice. Since the common law rule caused an accused person to lose their liberty, and since it violated a principle of fundamental justice, the majority found that the common law rule infringed section seven of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. The majority did not need to decide whether it also violated other sections of the Charter. The majority went on to find that the common law rule failed the Oakes test for a justified limitation of the Charter under section one of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. Specifically, although the objective justified the limitation (avoiding convicting a person who was insane at the time of the offence but refuses to raise the issue, and protecting the public from mentally ill people who require treatment), and there was a rational connection between the objective and the means to carry out that objective, the means was not minimally intrusive of the Charter right being violated. As a result, the majority created a new common law rule that was minimally intrusive. The new rule only allows two instances of when the Crown can lead evidence of insanity. The first instance is when the trier of fact has concluded beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused is otherwise guilty of the charges before the court (as it will no longer interfere with the accused's other defences). The second instance is if the accused's own defence has put his or her mental capacity for criminal intent at issue. The majority also concluded that the new common law rule would not infringe section 15 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms (the equality section). This was because the new rule would not treat the mentally ill unequal in the courts, and would not create new burdens on the mentally ill. In her concurring judgment, Wilson J. reached a similar reasoning with the majority, and agreed with the new common law rule. In his concurring judgment, Gonthier J. agreed with the majority's conclusions and the new rule, but disagreed with some of the alternatives considered by the majority. In her dissenting judgement, L'Heureux-Dub√© J. found that the old common law rule did not infringe sections 7 or 15 of the Charter, and in fact was reflective of the principles of fundamental justice. Federalism In Canadian law, the federal and provincial governments have exclusive authority to legislate in certain areas (see Canadian federalism). Since the Criminal Code is a federal statute, an issue was whether the provision requiring the automatic detention by a person found not guilty by reason of insanity - until released by the Lieutenant Governor - was outside the federal government's authority to legislate, or whether it fell within provincial jurisdiction over health matters. The majority found that the pith and substance of the provision was \\"to protect society against dangerous individuals\\". A preventative law such as this was considered to be a valid part of criminal law, which the exclusive authority of the federal government. The majority felt it was important to note that the legislative provisions dealt with supervision of the person, not treatment of the person, and the focus was on what was in the interests of the public. In their concurring judgments, Wilson and Gonthier JJ. agreed with the majority's decision. Although dissenting in other areas, L'Heureux-Dub√© J. agreed with the majority on this point. Constitutionality of automatic detention The majority found that the legislative provisions gave no discretion to the trial judge. Instead, the provisions required the judge to order the person's detention without any hearing on the issue of the person's mental state. Subsequent hearings cannot change that fact. Since the detention is automatic with no standards or criteria that can be applied, the majority found that the law was arbitrarily detaining individuals, and violated section nine of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. The majority went on to find that the legislation failed the Oakes test for a justified limitation of the Charter under section one of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. Specifically, although all the parties agreed that the objective was substantial (detaining individuals who may be dangerous due to their mental health), and that there is a rational connection between the objective and the means, it was not minimally intrusive. The majority noted that there was no minimum time before the Lieutenant Governor was required to make their decision known. In fact, the legislation does not require the Lieutenant Governor to ever make an order. The majority felt that minimally intrusiveness required that a person be held no longer than necessary to determine their mental state. In her concurring judgment, Wilson J. agreed with the majority's conclusion, but disagreed with a comment made by the majority that there is a presumption that discretion conferred by statute would be exercised in a manner that is in compliance with the Charter. In his concurring judgment, Gonthier J. agreed with the majority. In her dissenting decision, L'Heureux- Dub√© J. found that the legislative scheme was constitutional. Disposition As a result of the majority's findings, Swain's finding of not guilty by reason of insanity was overturned. While normally a new trial should be ordered, the specific circumstances in this case did not warrant it: Swain had been acquitted (by reason of insanity) and had been absolutely discharged. A new trial would be unfair to Swain, but entering a full acquittal would also be inappropriate. Therefore, the court entered a judicial stay of proceedings. Although the court's reasons found that the legislative scheme was unconstitutional, and therefore of no force and effect, the majority crafted a six-month transitional period to allow Parliament to create a new legislative scheme. The period was extended by the court to February 5, 1992. Aftermath As a result of the legislative scheme being struck down, Parliament created a new legislative scheme in 1992. The insanity defence was replaced with being found not criminally responsible by reason of a mental disorder\\". If a person was \\"not criminally responsible\\", the court is no longer required to automatically detain the person. Instead, the court can enter their own disposition or refer the person to the independent Review Board for disposition. The possible dispositions are: detention in hospital, conditional discharge, or absolute discharge. The new legislation requires that the least restrictive or onerous disposition be imposed, bearing in mind public safety, the mental condition of the accused, and the goal of reintegration into society. The role of the Lieutenant Governor in these decisions was abolished, and their decision-making duties were transferred to the Review Boards.

Discovery and species A fossil of the species was discovered in the fifties by rancher Warren H. Condray of Wells, KS. He notified senator Frank Carlson who directed him to the chancellor of the University of Kansas, Franklin David Murphy. Murphy sent the preparator of the paleontology of vertebrates department of the natural history museum of the university, Russell R. Camp, to investigate the matter. In July 1955 Camp, with help from Condray, recovered the skeleton of a dinosaur. It was further prepared by Camp and Glenn H. Marihugh. In 1961 the find was described and named by Theodore H. Eaton jr., also from the University of Kansas, as the type species Silvisaurus condrayi. The generic name is derived from Latin silva, \\"wood\\", in reference to the probably densely forested habitat of the animal. The specific name honours Condray.Eaton, T.H., Jr. 1960. \\"A new armored dinosaur from the Cretaceous of Kansas\\". The University of Kansas Paleontological Contributions: Vertebrata 8: 1-24. To date, Silvisaurus includes only the type species. The holotype, KU 10296, was found in exposures of the Terracota Clay Member of the Dakota Formation (late Albian-early Cenomanian) in Kansas, and consists of an incomplete skeleton with skull. It includes the mandible, eight neck vertebrae, ten dorsal vertebrae, a sacrum of six sacral vertebrae, three tail vertebrae, a left pubis fragment, the lower end of the right femur, and a toe phalanx. Additionally disarticulated plates and spikes from the body armour were discovered. The condition of the fossil was poor as the bones had been exposed at the bottom of a dry riverbed and had been weathered and trampled by cattle. Some elements were only present as impressions or natural casts. Paleobiology Restoration Based on the remains, the animal is estimated to have been approximately in length. Its skull measures in length and is wide. The bony secondary palate is poorly developed in Silvisaurus, the dentary includes at least twenty-five teeth, the basal tubera of the basioccipital are bulbous, and each premaxilla holds eight to nine teeth. The presence of teeth at the front of the jaw suggests that this may have been a relatively primitive nodosaur, since most later forms had a toothless beak instead. In addition to the usual rounded and polygonal osteoderms, Silvisaurus may have also sported bony spines on its shoulders and tail. The head contained large air passages, which may have been used for loud vocalisations, presumably for communication. Classification This taxon represents a relatively primitive nodosaurid, and Vickaryous et al.

He returned to Prague in 1887 when Josef Hl√°vka offered him a professorial post for landscape painting at the Academy. Among his students there were Otakar Lebeda, Anton√≠n Slav√≠ƒçek, Franti≈°ek Kav√°n and Alois Kalvoda, who formed what became known as the Ma≈ô√°kovu krajin√°≈ôskou ≈°kolu (Ma≈ô√°k Landscape School). In 1893, he became seriously ill and had to rely on the help of his students to complete his commissions. Among his major commissions were decorations for the new National Theater in Prague and paintings for the staircase of the National Museum. He also created a group of sketches, for Goupil and Kaeser publishing, depicting the four seasons and the four times of day. They were made into a series of popular engravings by Eduard Willmann (1820-1877) of Karlsruhe. His daughter, Josefina, also became a painter, but died young.

He called himself a Grand Dragon. Rise to infamy Cole attended Grainger High School in Kinston, North Carolina, and served in the military during World War II. For a time, he drove a taxicab there and acquired his nickname. In 1953 he and his wife, Carolyn, began Southern Bible College in Marion, South Carolina. Cole was ordained into the ministry by the Wayside Baptist Church in Summerfield, North Carolina in 1958. While in Marion, he toured North Carolina and South Carolina as a tent evangelist and broadcast a Sunday morning radio program, \\"The Free Will Hour\\". During this period he became an active member of the Knights of the Ku Klux Klan, eventually becoming Grand Dragon in both North Carolina and South Carolina. Cole's rallies drew as many as 15,000. Cole incited violence against blacks, and after his rallies Klan motorcades often drove through black neighborhoods in order to terrorize the inhabitants (accompanied by the police, who maintained that they accompanied the Klan to keep order). Klan defeated by the Black Armed Guard Dr. Albert E. Perry, a black doctor in Monroe, North Carolina, was presumed to be financing the local chapter of the NAACP, and consequently he received numerous death threats from the Klan. In 1957, Robert F. Williams, the president of the local chapter of the NAACP, organized a Black Armed Guard, made up mostly of World War II veterans, which began organizing for self-defense, and guarded Dr. Perry's house in shifts. Not making a mention of their race, the group sent a letter to the National Rifle Association asking for a charter, stating that they were a group of veterans who wanted to continue training in case they be called on to serve once again. The charter was granted. Their preparations paid off on 5 October 1957, when Cole held a rally near Monroe. After the rally, a Klan motorcade headed to Dr. Perry's house, accompanied by shouting and the firing of weapons at houses along the way. When they reached Dr. Perry's house, the defenders returned fire from their fortified positions, and the Klan turned and ran. The city government in Monroe banned Klan motorcades the next day. After this unexpected resistance in Monroe, Cole directed his attention to the Lumbee in Robeson County. The Lumbee rout the Klan Lumbee Indians fighting Ku Klux Klansmen during the Battle of Hayes Pond Cole is best known for his harassment of the Lumbee Natives of Robeson County, North Carolina and received brief national attention in 1958 for his role in the Battle of Hayes Pond when armed Lumbees attacked a Klan rally and routed the Klansmen. Cole considered the Lumbee to be a \\"mongrel\\" race, and in 1957 began a campaign of harassment against them, announcing \\"There's about 30,000 half-breeds in Robeson County and we are going to have a cross burning and scare them up.\\" Cole gave several speeches inciting whites against the Lumbee and staged a cross burning in St. Pauls, North Carolina at the home of a Lumbee woman he claimed was having an affair with a white man. In the midst of Cole's campaign of terror against the Lumbee, Cole was warned by local law enforcement officials that his public speeches and demonstrations would provoke a reaction from the Lumbee. Undeterred, he called a Klan rally to be held on January 18, 1958, near the small town of Maxton where Cole predicted 5,000 Klansmen would remind the Lumbee of \\"their place\\". Realizing that the Lumbee would use this rally to muster together their own show of force, only 50 Klan members arrived to attend the rally. Cole and his fellow Klansmen were attacked by a heavily armed force of over 500 Lumbees. The battle turned to a rout as Cole and the Klansmen fled into the nearby swamps. Aftermath Whereas Cole's defeat in Monroe was met with indifference by the press, the Klan's failed confrontation with the Lumbees was highly publicized and led to Cole's arrest and conviction. Cole served a prison sentence (1959-1960) for inciting a riot (the Hayes Pond incident) after which he moved to Portsmouth, Virginia. There, Cole briefly worked illegally as an unlicensed private detective before returning to Kinston, North Carolina, in 1962, to operate a print shop. Cole began the Helping Hands C.B. Club in Greensboro and was also involved in the Committee for Better Government, a political action group with Ku Klux Klan overtones. In 1966, Cole attempted a takeover of the Klan organization. The move failed and Cole was banished. He later attempted to intimidate a black preacher with a cross-burning rally, but was arrested. He died on July 27, 1967, from injuries sustained in a car accident. ReferencesFurther reading * \\"James William Cole Papers,\\" Joyner Library, East Carolina University. * Tyson, Timothy B.

The Diocese of Argyll was an ecclesiastical territory or diocese of Scotland in the Middle Ages. The Diocese was led by the Bishop of Argyll, and was based at Lismore. During the Scottish Reformation, the majority of the Scottish established church broke communion with the Pope. The establishment oscillated for a number of years over the question of whether to retain the order of bishops as leaders in the church, as the Church of England had done. Eventually the presbyterians, those who do not have bishops, became the majority of the establishment and the post-Reformation Church of Scotland. However, the Scottish Episcopal Church continued to appoint bishops for the ancient dioceses of Scotland. In 1688, the diocese was held with the Diocese of Ross because of a shortage of bishops in the Episcopal Church. This union often included the dioceses of Moray or Caithness through the 17th and 18th centuries. In 1819, the ancient Diocese of the Isles was added, and, in 1847, Alexander Ewing became the first Bishop of Argyll and the Isles. In 1878, the Roman Catholic Church founded a new diocese of the same name. Both the Episcopal and Catholic dioceses are now based in Oban.

Trans Florida specialized in modifying surplus North American P-51 Mustangs into plush business aircraft called Executive Mustangs. Later, the aircraft were renamed Cavalier Mustangs and were produced in several different versions: Cavalier 750, 1500, and 2000 (the numbers indicating the approximate range of the aircraft in statute miles). Trans Florida marketed and sold these aircraft, trained the new owners to fly them, and maintained them for customers after purchase. Lindsay also accumulated an immense stockpile of P-51 spare parts and sold these to Mustang owners worldwide. Many of the spares and entire aircraft were purchased from scrap dealers intending to melt them down. Lindsay also developed and received FAA approval for several improvements to the P-51D including: avionics, autopilot, baggage door, fresh air system, rear passenger seat, additional wing bladder tanks, high pressure oxygen system, and wingtip tanks of . The original builder of the Mustang, North American Aviation, purchased two Cavaliers for famed test pilot R.A. \\"Bob\\" Hoover, one in 1962 and the other in 1971 to use to promote the NAA name at airshows. In 1967 the company was renamed Cavalier Aircraft Corporation due to the strong product identity of the Cavalier Mustang. Military contracts In 1965 the company was contracted in by the government of the Dominican Republic, with US State Dept. approval, to inspect and perform necessary repairs to 36 aircraft in Sarasota. In 1967 the Air Force contracted with Cavalier to create military-capable Cavalier Mustangs that would be provided to friendly countries as part of the U.S. Military Assistance Program. These aircraft were called the Cavalier F-51D Mustang, and the Cavalier TF-51D Mustang. Cavaliers of these types were supplied between 1967 and 1969, via the Air Force, to Bolivia, and directly to El Salvador, with spare parts and maintenance assistance also provided to Guatemala. Modifications varied, but included: vertical fin extension of , addition wing hard points, avionics upgrades, increased engine power, and wing tip tanks. Cavaliers were also constructed for Indonesia as part of a similar U.S. Military Assistance Program, called Peace Pony, in 1971 by Field Services, Inc. The Enforcer In 1968, Cavalier owner/founder David Lindsay began developing a highly modified version of the Cavalier Mustang for use as a counterinsurgency aircraft called the Enforcer. Powered by a Rolls-Royce Dart and later a Lycoming YT-55-9 turboprop of , the aircraft had impressive performance and was equipped with Bristol ceramic armour to protect the engine, airframe, and pilot. Despite Cavalier's best efforts, they were unable to secure a government purchase of the aircraft. Due to the limited manufacturing capabilities of Cavalier Aircraft Corporation, Lindsay sold the Enforcer concept to Piper in late 1970. Cavalier was closed in 1971 so the founder/owner, David Lindsay, could help continue develop the Enforcer concept with Piper Aircraft. Today Many of the civilian Cavalier conversions are still flying today. Several of the military Cavaliers have been re-imported to the US. Most have been restored to appear as WW II or Korean era P-51s, but retain many of their Cavalier improvements.

He is well known for his HIV/AIDS and gay-rights activism and was hailed by Nelson Mandela as \\"one of South Africa's new heroes\\". Early life Cameron was born in Pretoria. His father was imprisoned for car theft and his mother did not have the means to support him. He therefore spent much of his childhood in an orphanage in Queenstown. His elder sister was killed when Cameron was nine. Cameron won a scholarship to attend Pretoria Boys High School, one of South Africa's best state schools, and reinvented himself, he says, \\"in the guise of a clever schoolboy\\". Thereafter he went to Stellenbosch University, studying Latin and classics. Here he stayed at Wilgenhof Mens Residence. After this he attended Oxford University as a Rhodes Scholar. There he switched to law and earned a BA in Jurisprudence and the Bachelor of Civil Law, winning the Vinerian Scholarship. When he returned to South Africa he completed an LLB at the University of South Africa and was its best law graduate. Cameron's early career combined academia and legal practice.\\"JSC interview: Edwin Cameron\\", Constitutional Court website. In 1982, while working as a senior lecturer at the University of the Witwatersrand, he famously wrote a scathing critique of the late Chief Justice L. C. Steyn, then a darling of the apartheid establishment. And, in 1987, Cameron argued that three senior South African judges, including its former Chief Justice, Pierre Rabie, ought to resign to preserve the legitimacy of the judiciary. Cameron practised at the Johannesburg Bar from 1983 to 1994. From 1986 he was a human rights lawyer at Wits's Centre for Applied Legal Studies, where in 1989 he was awarded a personal professorship in law. Cameron's practice included labour and employment law; defence of African National Congress fighters charged with treason; conscientious and religious objection; land tenure and forced removals; and gay and lesbian equality. In 1992 he became a co-author (with Tony Honor√©, one of his mentors at Oxford) of Honor√©'s South African Law of Trusts. Cameron took silk in 1994. Judicial career The Witwatersrand Local Division (now the South Gauteng High Court) in Johannesburg High Court In October 1994, President Nelson Mandela appointed Cameron as an acting judge of the High Court to chair a commission of inquiry into illegal arms sales by Armscor, operating as the sales arm of the SANDF, to Yemen.\\"Commission of Inquiry into Alleged Arms Transactions Between Armscor and One Eli Wazan and Other Related Matters\\" (1995), Polity . Cameron's report was described as a \\"hard-hitting\\" critique of Armscor's conduct, but was quickly eclipsed by myriad other allegations about the South African government's illegal arms trades. Cameron was appointed permanently to the Witwatersrand Local Division in 1995. His best-known judgment in this capacity is Holomisa v Argus Newspapers Ltd,Holomisa v Argus Newspapers Ltd 1996 (2) SA 588 (W). where Bantu Holomisa had brought a defamation suit against The Star for alleging that he had been \\"directly involved\\" in the infiltration into South Africa of an Azanian People's Liberation Army \\"hit squad\\" aimed at \\"killing whites\\". Cameron's judgment was described as a \\"most rigorous exposition\\" of the Constitution's application to private disputes and a \\"landmark\\" defence of free speech. Others, while acknowledging the judgment had departed importantly from apartheid-era law, said it should have gone further in protecting journalists. Cameron's position was substantially confirmed, in subsequent cases, by the Supreme Court of Appeal.National Media Ltd and Others v Bogoshi (1998) ZASCA 94; 1998 (4) SA 1196 (SCA). Supreme Court of Appeal In 1999, Cameron was given an acting stint on the Constitutional Court, during which he partook in its seminal judgments in Pharmaceutical Manufacturers and Grootboom and wrote the Liquor Bill judgment on provincial legislative powersEx Parte President of the Republic of South Africa: In re Constitutionality of the Liquor Bill (1999) ZACC 15. ‚Äî the first, and still the only, case to be referred to the Court by the President of South Africa under section 79 of the Constitution. The Judicial Service Commission had recommended that Cameron be permanently appointed, but Sandile Ngcobo was ultimately preferred due to the late intercession of Thabo Mbeki, then Deputy President, who felt the appointee should be black. Cameron has said there is \\"no doubt\\" this was the correct decision. Cameron was instead appointed to the Supreme Court of Appeal (at the same time as Mahomed Navsa and Robert Nugent), which he served for eight years. There he wrote leading judgments on legal causation,S v Tembani (2006) ZASCA 123. hearsay evidence,S v Ndhlovu and Others (2002) ZASCA 70. public contractsLogbro Properties v Bedderson NO and Others (2002) ZASCA 135. and contempt of court.Fakie NO v CCII Systems (Pty) Ltd (2006) ZASCA 52. In Minister of Finance v Gore, Cameron co-authored a judgment with Fritz Brand that held the state could be delictually liable for causing pure economic loss by fraud.Minister of Finance and Others v Gore NO (2006) ZASCA 98. Constitutional Court On 31 December 2008 President Kgalema Motlanthe appointed Cameron to the Constitutional Court, taking effect from 1 January 2009. He is considered a crucial member of the Court's progressive wing. He has been described as a \\"jurist of the highest order\\", \\"the greatest legal mind of his generation\\" and \\"in a league of his own\\". The courtroom of the Constitutional Court of South Africa Cameron's judgment in Glenister v President, co-authored with Deputy Chief Justice Dikgang Moseneke, struck down amendments to the National Prosecuting Act and South African Police Service Act on the basis that they failed to create an \\"adequately independent\\" anti-corruption unit.Glenister v President of the Republic of South Africa and Others (2011) ZACC 6 This was praised as an \\"imaginative\\" and \\"brilliant\\" judgment by commentators and means South Africa must have an independent corruption-fighting agency notwithstanding the ruling ANC's controversial disbanding of the Scorpions. Also well-known are Cameron's judgments on defamation law and free speech: *In The Citizen v McBride, Cameron's majority judgment enlarged the scope of the fair comment defence and substantially excused The Citizen from liability to Robert McBride for calling him a \\"murderer\\" unsuited for public office.The Citizen 1978 (Pty) Ltd and Others v McBride (2011) ZACC 11. *Le Roux v Dey, handed down in 2012, concerned three schoolboys who had superimposed an image of their deputy principal's face on the naked body of one man masturbating alongside another. The Constitutional Court's majority judgment held the image was defamatory of the deputy principal.Le Roux and Others v Dey (2011) ZACC 4. Cameron, however, in a judgment co-authored with Justice Froneman, dissented on this point, saying it could not be actionable to imply someone is gay. Leading commentators praised this conclusion. Others, however, criticised Cameron's \\"schizophrenic\\" judgment for holding that the picture had nevertheless actionably harmed the plaintiff's dignity by suggesting he engaged in \\"sexually promiscuous or exhibitionist\\" conduct. *In Democratic Alliance v African National Congress, handed down in 2015, Cameron's majority judgment, co-authored with Justices Froneman and Khampepe, dismissed the ruling ANC's claim against the opposition Democratic Alliance for stating in a bulk SMS that Public Protector Thuli Madonsela's report shows how President Zuma \\"stole\\" taxpayers' money to build his Nkandla home.Democratic Alliance v African National Congress (2015) ZACC 1. The judgment was \\"hailed as a victory for freedom of expression during election campaigns\\", though some thought it risked conceptual muddiness. Cameron retired on 20 August 2019, the 25th anniversary of his appointment to the bench. Activism=Gay rights Cameron at the first pride parade in South Africa Cameron has been openly gay since the early 1980s. He addressed the crowd in the first pride parade in South Africa held in Johannesburg on 13 October 1990. Thereafter he oversaw the gay and lesbian movement's submissions to the drafters of the South African Constitution and was instrumental in securing the inclusion of an express prohibition on discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation. He is one of 29 signatories to the Yogyakarta Principles.Signatories to the Yogyakrta Principles, p. 35 He also was a founding member of the Society for Homosexuals on Campus, a student organization at the University of the Witwatersrand, which later became known as Activate Wits. 1995 saw the publication of Defiant Desire: Gay and Lesbian Lives in South Africa, \\"a celebration of the lives of gay men and lesbians in South Africa\\" which Cameron co-edited with Mark Gevisser. HIV/AIDS From 1988 Cameron advised the National Union of Mineworkers on HIV/AIDS, and helped draft and negotiate the industry's first comprehensive AIDS agreement with the Chamber of Mines. While at the Centre for Applied Legal Studies, he drafted the Charter of Rights on AIDS and HIV, co-founded the AIDS Consortium (a national affiliation of non-governmental organizations working in AIDS), which he chaired for its first three years, and founded and was the first director of the AIDS Law Project. Cameron had himself contracted HIV in the 1980s and became extremely ill with AIDS when working as a High Court judge. His salary allowed him to afford anti-retroviral treatment, which saved his life. Cameron's realisation that he owed his life to his relative wealth caused him to become a prominent HIV/AIDS activist in post-apartheid South Africa, urging its government to provide treatment to all. He has strongly criticised President Thabo Mbeki's AIDS-denialist policies. Cameron was the first, and remains the only, senior South African official to state publicly that he is living with HIV/AIDS.\\"Bearing Witness, A&U; Mag\\" http://www.aumag.org/features/CameronDec05.html \\"Key People: Edwin Cameron\\",JournAIDS. His prize-winning first book, Witness to AIDS, is about his struggle with the illness. It has been published in South Africa, the UK, the US and in translation in Germany and in China.  Decriminalization of sex work  Cameron has been a staunch supporter of the full decriminalization of sex work. His advocacy and activism has sought to link criminalization, discrimination and stigma, and more recently how these link to Sustainable Development Goal 16. In 2008, at the 17th International AIDS Conference held in Mexico, Cameron called for a sustained and vocal campaign against HIV criminalization. At the 21st International Aids Conference, held in 2016 in Durban, South Africa, Cameron expanded on the call for decriminalization of HIV, stating \\"[t]he biggest problem is stigma. Stigma, stigma, stigma, stigma. Stigma remains a barrier to prevention, it remains a barrier to behavior change, it remains a barrier to people accessing treatment.\\" During the same speech, Cameron invited any sex workers present to join him on stage and indicated that sex work is \\"one of the most dangerous and despised occupations, and one that deserves our support and our respect and our love.\\" He further stated \\"Sex workers are perhaps the most reviled group in human history - indispensable to a portion of mostly heterosexual males in society, but despised, marginalized, persecuted, beaten up and imprisoned. Sex workers work. Their work is work with dignity.\\" In July 2019, at a UNAIDS Press Conference, Cameron linked activism against criminalization, discrimination and stigma, to achieving Sustainable Development Goal 16 where he stated \\"Almost all countries have some form of criminal prohibition on sex work. [...] criminalization has severe consequences taking people outside of areas of protection. It declares [the criminalized group's] actions or identity illegitimate, and increases stigma. It excludes them from protections that our judicial, social and economic systems may provide. UNAIDS data indicates that criminalized groups often experience high rates of violence. If you suffer criminal violence and you yourself are criminalized, in most cases you simply cannot go to the police.\\" Awards Cameron's awards include the Nelson Mandela Award for Health and Human Rights (2000); Stellenbosch University's Alumnus Award; Transnet's HIV/AIDS Champions Award; and the San Francisco AIDS Foundation Excellence in Leadership Award. In 2008 he served as a member of the Jury of the Red Ribbon Award, a partnership of the UNAIDS Family. He is the 2009‚Äì2010 winner of the Brudner Prize from Yale University, awarded annually to an accomplished scholar or activist whose work has made significant contributions to the understanding of LGBT issues or furthered the tolerance of LGBT people. In 2019, Cameron was awarded the Asijiki Award for Service and Humanity from the Asijiki Coalition, which advocates for the decriminalization of sex work in South Africa. In 2002 the Bar of England and Wales honoured him with a Special Award for his contribution to international jurisprudence and human rights. He is an honorary fellow of the Institute of Advanced Legal Studies, London, and Keble College, Oxford; and was a visiting fellow of All Souls College, Oxford in 2003‚Äì04, researching \\"Aspects of the AIDS Epidemic, examining in particular the denialist stance supported by SA President Mbeki\\". In 2009 Cameron was appointed as an Honorary Master of the Bench of the Honourable Society of the Middle Temple. He has five honorary doctorates. Cameron was, until 2015, the general secretary of the Rhodes Scholarships in Southern Africa and is a patron of the Oxford University Commonwealth Law Journal. Between 1998 and 2008, Cameron chaired the Council of the University of the Witwatersrand. He is the patron of the Guild Cottage Children's Home, the Soweto HIV/AIDS Counselors' Association and Community AIDS Response. In January 2020 he became the Chancellor of Stellenbosch University. Media Cameron's critical role in the battle for access to antiretroviral treatment in Africa and other parts of the global south is portrayed in the award-winning documentary Fire in the Blood.

She was formerly the principal samurai wife of Toyotomi Hideyoshi under the name of .Nussbaum, Louis-Fr√©d√©ric. (2005). \\"Matsudaira Ietada\\" in Japan Encyclopedia, p. 702. When she rose in higher political status, she took the title of \\"Kita no mandokoro\\". Early life K≈çdai-in was born Sugihara Yasuko in Owari Province between 1541 and 1549. She was the second daughter of , a descendant of Taira no Sadamori, and his wife . She was adopted by her uncle Asano Nagakatsu, a descendant of the Toki clan and of Minamoto no Yorimitsu (944-1021). According to the \\"Hankanpu\\" (Genealogy of the Protectors of the Shogunate), she was first supposed to marry Maeda Toshiie, but she became the wife of Hideyoshi. Hideyoshi's wife Around 1561, she married Hashiba Hideyoshi, a man who would later become one of the three great unifiers of Japan, although at the time of their marriage he had yet to gain much fame, and despite her mother Asahidono opposition to this marriage, because of the difference in social status with her husband. Nene was his principal wife and also one of his favorite wives. In 1585, after Hideyoshi was appointed to the post of Imperial Regent (Kampaku), Nene took on the title of \\"Kita no mandokoro.\\" As the wife of Hideyoshi, Nene is most famous for being one of his closest aides and confidantes. The daughter of a samurai, she had many familial connections that netted Hideyoshi several retainers. Among these retainers were Sugihara Ietsugu (Nene's uncle), Kinoshita Iesada (Nene's brother), Kobayakawa Hideaki (Nene's nephew) and Asano Nagamasa (Nene's brother-in-law). The last of these characters would serve as an important official in Hideyoshi's later administration. Nene was known to have been an intelligent woman who, at times, advised Hideyoshi on matters of governance by sending him letters. When Hideyoshi repealed the tax exemptions he had granted to the residents living in his headquarters at Nagahama, Nene appealed to him to reinstate the exemptions, and he did. It is also recorded that Hideyoshi frequently wrote letters to Nene to tell her about how his campaigns were going. Hideyoshi did this after his invasion of Sassa Narimasa's territory in Japan's Hokuriku region and after his campaign against the Shimazu clan. When Hideyoshi unified Japan, Nene often went with him to attend parties. She was courteous and respectful to her guests on every occasion. When Emperor Go-Yozei visited Hideyoshi's mansion with his entourage in 1588, Nene freely distributed a plethora of gifts to Hideyoshi's visitors. She also received the rank of Juichii from the Emperor himself. During Japanese invasions of Korea, Nene assisted the Toyotomi army by giving advise on how to transfer supplies from Japan to Korea. Though adored, Nene often found herself competing with other women for Hideyoshi's attention. In a letter to Nene, Oda Nobunaga also noted that Hideyoshi was somewhat dissatisfied with Nene. Hideyoshi took up several concubines. Nene did not bear any children. Letter from Oda Nobunaga ...It has been quite sometime since I last saw you, but your beauty grows day by day. Tokichiro [Hideyoshi] complains about you constantly and it is outrageous. While that \\"bald rat\\" [Hideyoshi] flusters to find another good woman, you remain lofty and elegant. Do not be envious. Show Hideyoshi this letter... Hideyoshi's widow Nene worried about Hideyoshi often when he was on his deathbed. Eventually, as Hideyoshi was on his last throes, she petitioned the Imperial Court to sponsor a sacred dance ritual to pray for and expedite Hideyoshi's recovery. After Hideyoshi died in 1598, Nene became a nun and assumed the dharma name of K≈çdai-in Kogetsuni. She was respected as a maternal figure for many retainers of the Toyotomi clan who proved to be loyal to her even after Hideyoshi's death. She gave the eastern ward of Osaka Castle to Tokugawa Ieyasu and relocated herself to the imperial palace. Nene had a captivating and gentle personality, so she gained the respect of many, she helped and housed many women related to the Western Army (commanded by Ishida Mitsunari) after the Battle of Sekigahara. In 1603, Nene attended Toyotomi Hideyori and Senhime's wedding. In 1606 with the help of Tokugawa Ieyasu, she established a Buddhist temple K≈çdai-ji in Kyoto, to which she moved. It became the burial area for her husband, his mother, and later Toyotomi Hideyori. During the contest between Toyotomi Hideyori and Tokugawa Ieyasu for supremacy (Siege of Osaka), K≈çdai-in took the side of Ieyasu. Death After her death in 1624 and was buried within the temple compound, she was posthumously given the name of Hikari no Tenshi or \\"Angel of Light\\".Nenzi, Laura. (2008).

He is portrayed by Dean Stockwell. In the fourth-season episode \\"Six of One\\", Cavil's model number was revealed as Number One.  Background  John Cavil, aka Number One, is a humanoid Cylon model that appears as a highly rational, eccentric man in his late-sixties. The Cavils have a heavy sarcastic demeanor and a sense of humor. They take neither religion nor death seriously and are the only atheist Cylon model. A Cavil is first seen aboard the Galactica assuming the role of a priest, offering spiritual guidance, and going by the name \\"Brother Cavil\\". A unique characteristic of the Cavils is the sadistic, cruel and Machiavellian streak in their personalities. The Cavils openly mock their fellow Cylons every time they attempt contact with humans, even when it is necessary. Even though they view death as a nuisance, the Cavils are extremely displeased with pain (placing the blame on the Final Five). This view fuels the idea that the Cavils wanted death to the humans to be as quick as possible but were unprepared for the aftermath. Their attitude towards human mortality, rather than irrational hatred, derives from their ignorance about death and its consequences. As revealed on Battlestar Galactica: The Plan, the Cavil that was stationed in Caprica learned from Samuel Anders the motives for the resistance; that humans do not leave anyone behind, even their dead. Respecting their resilience, the Caprica Cavil agrees with Caprica Six and Sharon Valerii (Boomer) to abandon the Colonies. Disappointed with the other Cylon models after failing to accomplish anything through boycott and sabotage, the Galactica Cavil fails to learn any lesson. As they are discovered and airlocked from Galactica, Galactica Cavil swears to \\"box\\" Caprica Cavil for his insubordination and is indicated to be the same Cavil that is the main enemy of season four, given his plans to destroy humanity once and for all when he resurrects. It is later implied in the series that the Cavils, akin to their creators, lack superhuman strength and are the least able to defend themselves. It is also implied that the Cavil who led the Civil War and who killed himself in the CIC when he realized he was losing and had no chance of winning, is the resurrected Galactica Cavil. Like the Simons and Number Threes and in contrast to Leobens, Dorals, Number Sixes and Number Eights, Cavils appear to be rare and seldom appear in large groups, though in the third-season episode \\"Rapture\\" a large number were seen presumably taking care of the boxing of the three line of Cylons. The Cavils' superior awareness of all situations (attributable to their being the only human model Cylon with full knowledge of their origin) and uncanny manipulative traits make their series the de facto leaders of the Cylons. Their vast superiority and manipulations over their fellow Cylons goes beyond comprehension, as they manage to annihilate the Twelve Colonies, repeatedly attack the survivors without hurting the Final Five and ensure their survival only to make them 'the ones who suffer the most', carrying on with the annihilation of billions only to teach their creators a lesson. A comment made by Sharon \\"Boomer\\" Valerii indicates the Cavils are against the idea of the Cylons reproducing biologically, which makes sense given their distaste for human traits as well as lack of faith in the Cylon god, whose commandments include, \\"Be fruitful\\". Ellen Tigh mentions that the idea that the only hope for the future of the Cylon race might be 'messy biological reproduction' is too much for Cavil. Cavil is insistent the Cylons not seek out or discuss the Final Five models and tries to prevent D'Anna from learning their identities, even threatening her at gunpoint in \\"Rapture\\". After she sees their faces, he boxes her before she can tell anyone, while claiming support from the other Cylons. The reason is he knows the identities of the Final Five and doesn't want them exposed (he's waiting until they've learned their \\"lesson\\").  Character biography  Two versions of Cavil appear at the end of the second season - in the two-part episode \\"Lay Down Your Burdens.\\" His first appearance is as a religious counselor provided by the fleet, with whom Chief Tyrol meets after he physically attacks deck hand Cally Henderson when she awakens him from a recurring nightmare. Tyrol states he dreams of killing himself, and Cavil suggests Tyrol subconsciously believes he is a Cylon sleeper agent like his former girlfriend Sharon \\"Boomer\\" Valerii. Cavil assures Tyrol he is no Cylon, joking \\"I've never seen you at any of the [Cylon] meetings.\\" Despite posing as a priest, Cavil is critical of the Lords of Kobol, telling Tyrol praying to them will not help. Cavil states humans have been given the choice to decide their own destinies, and the Lords play no part in their affairs. Cavil later meets with President Laura Roslin, and offers prayers to the Lords of Kobol for Roslin's success in her presidential campaign against Gaius Baltar. A second version of Cavil appears among the survivors from Caprica after Kara \\"Starbuck\\" Thrace leads a rescue mission to the planet. During a Cylon attack, the Cylons suddenly cease fire and withdraw. The Cavil among the group announces the Cylons have left Caprica, and that the group has been spared. Upon their return to the fleet, Chief Tyrol spots the second Cavil disembarking from a Raptor, and alerts the guards he is a Cylon. Caprica Cavil admits to being a Cylon with a message for their leader. Admiral Adama has the man taken to the brig. Meanwhile, Galactica Cavil is arrested, and emphatically protests his innocence until he sees another copy of himself in the brig. He simply says \\"Oh, well...okay then,\\" and calmly enters the cell. Caprica Cavil gives a message to Roslin, stating the Cylon attack on the Colonies, as well as pursuit of the fleet, was an error. Cavil further explains two Cylon heroes, the Number Six model known as Caprica Six and Number Eight (that version of Sharon \\"Boomer\\" Valerii that was stationed on Galactica and shot Admiral Adama), have convinced them the war is futile. He states though the Cylons are machines, they strive to be the best machines possible, and believe they will one day rise above their creators. Their first step had been to replace the humans, and they believed they could do this by hijacking their lives and taking their places. They have determined, however, they have become no better than the creators they despise, and offer a reprieve from the genocide, suggesting that human and Cylon go their separate ways. Adama and Roslin furiously reject the idea, stating they simply cannot walk away after the Cylons have destroyed their home worlds. Adama asks the two Cavils whether the new plan comes from their God, and Cavil says \\"there is no God. Supernatural divinities are the primitive's answer to why the sun goes down at night...or at least that's what we've been telling the others for years,\\" although he acknowledges neither position can be proven. Despite the apparent sincerity of the message, and the offer of truce, Roslin orders both Cavils to be airlocked, suggesting they will rapidly discover whether or not God exists. The actual disposal through the airlock is not shown on screen, but is shown in the film The Plan. Galactica Cavil reveals that there is a Resurrection Ship nearby and, given his comments, his resurrected self is likely the one that leads the Civil War. At least two Cavil versions are present on New Caprica during the Cylon occupation. The New Caprica Cavils display particularly venomous anti-human sentiments, taking great pleasure in taunting human prisoners and shrugging off the human casualties of insurgent suicide bombings. One Cavil in particular takes pleasure in blackmailing Ellen Tigh for sexual favors in exchange for releasing her husband Saul from captivity and not killing him. Saul Tigh is eventually released, having lost his right eye. Later in the season, Cavil is one of three Cylons to board Galactica to meet with William Adama and Laura Roslin about the Eye of Jupiter artifact. He is willing to hand Gaius Baltar over to the humans as part of a deal for the relic, \\"to sweeten the pot.\\" Upon returning to his Basestar, Cavil feels that the annihilation of Galactica is the best option, given the standoff, because Cylons are machines, and can wait out the human fleet. In \\"Rapture, Cavil finds D'Anna in the temple on the Algae Planet, and, realizing she has come to discover the identities of the Final Five, he orders her at gunpoint not to proceed any further. However, Baltar shoots him from behind, and D'Anna finally sees their faces, but she loses consciousness and dies shortly thereafter. Cavil is present as D'Anna resurrects. He states all members of her line, the Number Threes are fundamentally flawed, and suffer from messianic delusions. He claims he and the other Cylon models agree the Number Threes must all be \\"boxed\\" - deactivated, with their memories placed into cold storage. The boxing is carried out by Cavil. Cavil takes a major role in Season Four, as the leader and head negotiator of one of the two warring Cylon factions. In \\"Six of One,\\" Natalie, the leader of the opposing faction, demands he stop lobotomizing the Raiders, and reveals that she has restored free will to the Centurions. The Centurions then slaughter Cavil and the other Cylons in the room. Cavil resurrects in \\"The Ties That Bind,\\" and claims that, although he does not agree with Natalie and her followers, he will respect their wishes. The Number Twos, Number Sixes and Number Eights (except Boomer) demand the Threes be unboxed to end the deadlock. Cavil seemingly acquiesces but, in reality, sets a trap to destroy Natalie and her followers. Boomer starts to have second thoughts about going against her fellow Eights. However, Cavil, who has developed a relationship with her, encourages her to embrace her true nature as a machine, and abandon her emotions. Natalie survives the attack, and a civil war ensues. D'Anna is unboxed by Cavil in \\"The Hub\\". Cavil hopes she will be able to mediate peace between the warring Cylon factions, but she kills him and escapes with Helo and a Number Eight. In \\"No Exit\\", it is revealed Ellen Tigh was involved in the creation of Cavil, modelling him after the image of her own father, John. Cavil was the first of a new generation of Cylons, and he assisted in the creation of models Two to Eight. Because Ellen Tigh favored the Number Seven (Daniel) model, Cavil's jealousy grew and he had the entire line destroyed by tampering with the amniotic fluid housing the Daniel copies. Cavil was also responsible for the Final Five being banished to live as humans. His rage fueled in part by the Final Five condemning him to an existence complete with all of humanity's weaknesses, and realizing the Five would try to avert another war against the humans, he killed them and when they resurrected, he erased their memories and left them among the humans so they could witness the eventual genocide of the human race. Cavil manipulated his \\"parents\\", the Final Five, to be among those who suffered the most. It was also speculated (although never explicitly stated) Cavil was the one who programmed models Two to Eight to not seek out or discuss the Final Five. This theory has been confirmed in an interview with writer Ryan Mottesheard: After Ellen Tigh is poisoned by her husband, she resurrects aboard one of Cavil's ships and is held prisoner there for 18 months (No Exit). In the process of downloading to a new body, Ellen regains the memories Cavil had erased. Later, when the Cylons' resurrection capability is destroyed, Cavil attempts to acquire Ellen's knowledge of the technology (she and the other Final Five being the ones who developed the ability to resurrect). Cavil plans to kill Ellen and recover the information from her brain. Boomer seemingly rebels against him and helps Ellen escape. It is later revealed, however, Ellen's escape was orchestrated by Cavil to sneak Boomer onto Galactica in order to kidnap Hera Agathon. It is stated by Ellen in No Exit that Cavil is a sadist who enjoys playing mind games with the Final Five as evidenced by him taking Galen Tyrol's confession, a copy following Sam Anders in the resistance, torturing Tigh on New Caprica as well as extorting Ellen for sexual favors. He is also responsible for her being placed on a ship as it was leaving a destroyed Colony as part of his manipulations of the Final Five. Cavil fully embraces his identity as a machine and believes humans are inherently lesser than Cylons, dismissing Ellen's arguments that humans, for all their imperfections, have something real and precious: Love, compassion, creativity, emotion. The character of Cavil has echoes of the story of Oedipus. Alan Sepinwall of The Star-Ledger sees Cavil as \\"a cruel hybrid of the Biblical Cain (he murdered his brother, and his mother is fond of apples), Oedipus (has sex with his mother, though the eye he puts out belongs to his father) and a kind of Pinocchio in reverse.\\" Cavil wants Hera, as he sees her as the only chance for the Cylon race to continue, following the destruction of Resurrection. After Boomer helps Hera escape, Cavil personally leads a boarding party onto Galactica to retrieve her. In Galactica's CIC, Cavil is captured, while a Simon and Doral with him are killed by the bridge crew. Cavil takes advantage of an explosion to take a gun from a Colonial Marine guard, after knocking him down, and takes Hera hostage. Baltar lowers his side arm, and tries to convince Cavil to end the cycle of violence, and end the standoff on the bridge. Cavil begins to waver from Baltar's speech, but he refuses - without Hera, he believes his race will end. Tigh offers Cavil Resurrection technology if he releases Hera and stops pursuing humanity. Cavil agrees, and calls off his troops, saying he's a man of his word. Cavil becomes impatient, and sarcastically tells the Final Five Cylons to \\"hurry up\\" their discussions, as they are \\"keeping two civilizations waiting.\\" As the Final Five come together to generate the data necessary for Resurrection technology, Tyrol, discovering Tory was responsible for the death of his wife Cally, breaks the link and kills her. Cavil realizes that, since each of the Final Five possessed part of the secret to Resurrection, that in killing one, then the secret of Resurrection has effectively been lost with the death of Tory. At that very moment, the Cylon Colony is hit by a barrage of Galactica's remaining nuclear warheads fired by Racetrack's Raptor, which knocks the Colony out of orbit, and dooms it to be swallowed by the black hole. The surviving Simon and Doral, deciding the whole process has been a trick, recommence the battle with the humans, and are gunned down. Cavil shouts \\"Frak!\\", puts his gun into his mouth, and commits suicide. In \\"Battlestar Galactica: The Plan,\\" the history of the Cavils found in the fleet and on Caprica during \\"Lay Down Your Burdens\\" is expanded upon. The fleet version of Cavil is revealed to have been with Ellen Tigh when the attack on the Colonies commenced, having wanted to see just how much suffering she had undergone and what she had learned about the evils of humanity. Instead, Cavil discovers that, to his mind at least, Ellen had learned nothing. Cavil saved Ellen after the attacks as he wanted her to continue to suffer and accompanies Ellen to the fleet where Cavil takes command of the Cylon agents, ordering various acts of sabotage. However, each attempt is thwarted, causing Cavil to grow increasingly frustrated. During this time, he reluctantly befriends a young orphan named John, but murders the boy after he explicitly calls them friends. On Caprica, Anders and the Caprica resistance discover the other Cavil copy who is overseeing a body disposal crew that is attacked by the resistance. Cavil is able to hide amongst the bodies, pretending to have been a survivor amongst the corpses. Cavil is surprised to be reunited with Anders as well as a Number Four model amongst the resistance, but delays acting in order to study Anders whose care for the humans comes to intrigue the Cylon. Cavil's interactions with Anders and the resistance greatly humanize Cavil who realizes that the Final Five will love the humans even if they are gone. After Anders angrily rebukes him, Cavil changes, deciding not to kill Starbuck and Anders when he has a shot. After the Cylons suddenly stop their attack, Cavil learns of the truce from a Number Six model and decides to convey the message himself despite his model voting against it. When the Caprica copy of Cavil reaches Galactica, both Cavils are exposed as Cylons with \\"The Plan\\" making it clear that the Caprica Cavil purposefully did this to stop his other self. Arguing their differing points of view, the two Cavils are led to an airlock where the Caprica Cavil continues to try to convince his brother that they were wrong to try to destroy humanity. The Galactica Cavil reveals that there is a Resurrection Ship in range and that he intends to lead the destruction of humanity personally once he resurrects, suggesting that he is the same John Cavil encountered multiple times throughout the series. However, he intends to box the other Cavil, effectively putting him into cold storage to prevent him from spreading his heretical ideas to the rest of the Cylons. Despite their differences, the two Cavils hold hands as Admiral Adama personally blows them into outer space, the Caprica Cavil meeting his fate with eyes wide open while the Galactica Cavil shuts his eyes.

Sources vary in the name and rank used for this group, some treating it as the class Rhyniopsida, others as the subdivision Rhyniophytina or the division Rhyniophyta. The first definition of the group, under the name Rhyniophytina, was by Banks,In: since when there have been many redefinitions, including by Banks himself. \\"As a result, the Rhyniophytina have slowly dissolved into a heterogeneous collection of plants ... the group contains only one species on which all authors agree: the type species Rhynia gwynne-vaughanii\\". When defined very broadly, the group consists of plants with dichotomously branched, naked aerial axes (\\"stems\\") with terminal spore- bearing structures (sporangia). The rhyniophytes are considered to be stem group tracheophytes (vascular plants). Definitions The group was described as a subdivision of the division Tracheophyta by Harlan Parker Banks in 1968 under the name Rhyniophytina. The original definition was: \\"plants with naked (lacking emergences), dichotomizing axes bearing sporangia that are terminal, usually fusiform and may dehisce longitudinally; they are diminutive plants and, in so far as is known, have a small terete xylem strand with a central protoxylem.\\" With this definition, they are polysporangiophytes, since their sporophytes consisted of branched stems bearing sporangia (spore-forming organs). They lacked leaves or true roots but did have simple vascular tissue. Informally, they are often called rhyniophytes or, as mentioned below, rhyniophytoids. However, as originally circumscribed, the group was found not to be monophyletic since some of its members are now known to lack vascular tissue. The definition that seems to be used most often now is that of D. Edwards and D.S. Edwards: \\"plants with smooth axes, lacking well-defined spines or leaves, showing a variety of branching patterns that may be isotomous, anisotomous, pseudomonopodial or adventitious. Elongate to globose sporangia were terminal on main axes or on lateral systems showing limited branching. It seems probable that the xylem, comprising a solid strand of tracheids, was centrarch.\\" However, Edwards and Edwards also decided to include rhyniophytoids, plants which \\"look like rhyniophytes, but cannot be assigned unequivocally to that group because of inadequate anatomical preservation\\", but exclude plants like Aglaophyton and Horneophyton which definitely do not possess tracheids. In 1966, slightly before Banks created the subdivision, the group was treated as a division under the name Rhyniophyta. Taylor et al. in their book Paleobotany use Rhyniophyta as a formal taxon, but with a loose definition: plants \\"characterized by dichotomously branched, naked aerial axes with terminal sporangia\\". They thus include under \\"other rhyniophytes\\" plants apparently without vascular tissue. In 2010, the name paratracheophytes was suggested, to distinguish such plants from 'true' tracheophytes or eutracheophytes. In 2013, Hao and Xue returned to the earlier definition. Their class Rhyniopsida (rhyniopsids) is defined by the presence of sporangia that terminate isotomous branching systems (i.e. the plants have branching patterns in which the branches are equally sized, rather than one branch dominating, like the trunk of a tree). The shape and symmetry of the sporangia was then used to divide up the group. Rhynialeans (order Rhyniales), such as Rhynia gwynne-vaughanii, Stockmansella and Huvenia, had radially symmetrical sporangia that were longer than wide and possessed vascular tissue with S-type tracheids. Cooksonioids, such as Cooksonia pertoni, C. paranensis and C. hemisphaerica, had radially symmetrical or trumpet-shaped sporangia, without clear evidence of vascular tissue. Renalioids, such as Aberlemnia, Cooksonia crassiparietilis and Renalia had bilaterally symmetrical sporangia and protosteles. Taxonomy There is no agreement on the formal classification to be used for the rhyniophytes. The following are some of the names which may be used: * Division Rhyniophyta ** Subdivision Rhyniophytina Banks (1968) *** Class Rhyniopsida Kryshtofovich (1925)As Rhyniales in: **** Order Rhyniales Nƒõmejc (1950) ***** Family Rhyniaceae Kidston & Lang (1920) Phylogeny In 2004, Crane et al. published a cladogram for the polysporangiophytes in which the Rhyniaceae are shown as the sister group of all other tracheophytes (vascular plants). Some other former \\"rhyniophytes\\", such as Horneophyton and Aglaophyton, are placed outside the tracheophyte clade, as they did not possess true vascular tissue (in particular did not have tracheids). However, both Horneophyton and Aglaophyton have been tentatively classified as tracheophytes in at least one recent cladistic analysis of Early Devonian land plants. Partial cladogram by Crane et al. including the more certain rhyniophytes: (See the Polysporangiophyte article for the expanded cladogram.) Genera The taxon and informal terms corresponding to it have been used in different ways. Hao and Xue in 2013 circumscribed their Rhyniopsida quite broadly, dividing it into rhynialeans, cooksonioids and renalioids. Genera included by Hao and Xue are listed below, with assignments to their three subgroups where these are given. * Aberlemnia (renalioids) * Aglaophyton (rhynialeans) * Caia * Cooksonia (cooksonioids + renalioids) * Culullitheca * Eogaspesiea (= Eogaspesia) (rhynialeans) * Eorhynia * Filiformorama * Fusitheca (= Fusiformitheca) * Grisellatheca * Hsua (=Hs√ºa) (renalioids) * Huia * Huvenia (rhynialeans) * Junggaria (= Cooksonella, Eocooksonia) * Pertonella * Renalia (renalioids) * Resilitheca * Rhynia (rhynialeans) * Salopella (rhynialeans?) * Sartilmania * Sennicaulis * Sporathylacium * Steganotheca * Stockmansella (rhynialeans) * Tarrantia (rhynialeans?) * Tortilicaulis * Uskiella (rhynialeans) It has been suggested that the poorly preserved Eohostimella, found in deposits of Early Silurian age (Llandovery, around ), may also be a rhyniophyte. Others have placed some of these genera in different groups. For example, Tortilicaulis has been considered to be a horneophyte. Rhynie flora The general term \\"rhyniophytes\\" or \\"rhyniophytoids\\" is sometimes used for the assemblage of plants found in the Rhynie chert Lagerst√§tte - rich fossil beds in Aberdeenshire, Scotland, and roughly coeval sites with similar flora. Used in this way, these terms refer to a floristic assemblage of more or less related early land plants, not a taxon. Though the rhyniophytes are well represented, plants with simpler anatomy, like Aglaophyton, are also common; there are also more complex plants, like Asteroxylon, which has a very early form of leaves.

Brantwood. The photo is taken from Lectures on Landscape, by John Ruskin, and dates to circa 1871 Brantwood is a historic house museum in Cumbria, England, overlooking Coniston Water. It has been the home of a number of prominent people. The house and grounds are administered by a charitable trust, the house being a museum dedicated to John Ruskin, one of its final owners. Brantwood is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade II* listed building, and buildings in the grounds are also listed. History Brant is an old Norse word meaning \\"steep\\" and the house and grounds are situated on a steep wooded area overlooking the lake. Before the house was built the site was regarded as an \\"essential viewing point\\" for early visitors to the Lake District in the 18th century. The original house was built at the end of the 18th century by Thomas Woodville and consisted of between 6 and 8 rooms. After a number of owners, the estate and house were enlarged around 1833. In the middle of the 19th century the resident was Josiah Hudson, father of Charles Hudson who was an Anglican priest and an early mountaineer. In 1852 the resident was the Victorian wood engraver, poet, artist, book illustrator and social reformer William James Linton who bought the house the following year. Between 1858 and 1864, while Linton was living in London, the house was let to Gerald Massey, poet and Egyptologist. Linton emigrated with his children to America in 1867.Wiki article - William James Linton In 1869, George William Kitchin, later Dean of Durham Cathedral, took up residence at Brantwood. In 1871 the house was sold to John Ruskin who it is claimed had never previously seen it. However, Kitchin and Ruskin were friends, having met at Oxford,Wiki article - George William Kitchin so it is likely he may have had some prior knowledge of the property. Before Ruskin came to Brantwood in the following year, he arranged for repairs to the house, the addition of a turret, the building of a lodge for his valet and his family and for improvements to the garden. For a short time during his stay at Brantwood, Ruskin held tutorial sessions, what would be called today as teaching seminars. These were held three times each week and each day a different subject was covered, namely Art, Literature and Sociology. His evening assistant when he was absent was a Richard Hosken who had been a former student. When he was in residence, Ruskin filled the house with art, including paintings by Gainsborough, Turner and the Pre-Raphaelites and a collection of minerals, pottery and sea-shells. Ruskin was joined in the house by Arthur Severn, an artist married to Joan Agnew, his cousin and their growing family. A frequent visitor to the house was William Gershom Collingwood, painter, archaeologist and translator of Nordic sagas who lived nearby. In 1878, a new dining room was built at the south end of the house. A second storey was added around 1890 to provide additional rooms for the Severn family and a studio was built at the rear of the house for the use of Arthur Severn. During this time the estate was also extended. Following the death of Ruskin in 1900, the house and estate were inherited by the Severn family. In Ruskin's will the wish was expressed that the house should be open for 30 days a year for visitors to see his house and collection. However the Severns did not honour this intention and they sold many of the better pictures. After the death of Arthur Severn in 1931 the remaining contents of the house were sold by auction. Emily Warren, John Ruskin's last pupil, instigated a successful movement to have Brantwood made into a museum. The house was saved for the nation by John Howard Whitehouse, founder of Bembridge School and of the Birmingham Ruskin Society, who bought the house. He established the Brantwood Trust in 1951 to care for the property for posterity. House and grounds The house is listed at Grade II*. The following rooms are open to the public. The drawing room still includes Ruskin's secretaire, bookcase and shell- cabinet. The wallpaper is a copy of Ruskin's design and his drawing of the north porch of St. Mark's, Venice hangs above the shell-cabinet. Next door is the study where Ruskin worked which contains a painting by Samuel Prout. The dining room, built in 1878, has views over to the Coniston mountains through its seven lancet windows. It contains a portrait of Ruskin aged 3 painted by James Northcote. The old dining room contains some early drawings by Ruskin. Upstairs in the turret is Ruskin's bedroom. In the grounds are four more listed buildings. The lodge and former stable are listed at Grade II*. Listed at Grade II are the former coach house and stable, another outbuilding, and an ice house. In the Linton Room in the Linton Building there is a lithophone, called \\"The Musical Stones\\", which visitors may play. The garden was used by Ruskin to experiment in various forms of cultivation and drainage and it contains a series of steep and winding paths. After his death more ornamental shrubs and trees were planted. The area then became overgrown until it was rediscovered in the 1980s and it has been much restored since. The estate covers around and includes lake shore, pasture, oak woods and moorland.

He is the Theodore M. Newcomb Distinguished Professor of social psychology and co-director of the Culture and Cognition program at the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor. Nisbett's research interests are in social cognition, culture, social class, and aging. He received his Ph.D. from Columbia University, where his advisor was Stanley Schachter, whose other students at that time included Lee Ross and Judith Rodin. Perhaps his most influential publication is \\"Telling more than we can know: Verbal reports on mental processes\\" (with T. D. Wilson, 1977, Psychological Review, 84, 231‚Äì259), one of the most often cited psychology articles published, with over 13,000 citations. This article was the first comprehensive, empirically based argument that a variety of mental processes responsible for preferences, choices, and emotions are inaccessible to conscious awareness. Nisbett and Wilson contended that introspective reports can provide only an account of \\"what people think about how they think,\\" but not \\"how they really think.\\" Some cognitive psychologists disputed this claim, with Ericsson and Simon (1980) offering an alternative perspective. Nisbett's book The Geography of Thought: How Asians and Westerners Think Differently... And Why (Free Press; 2003) contends that \\"human cognition is not everywhere the same,\\" that Asians and Westerners \\"have maintained very different systems of thought for thousands of years,\\"Nisbett 2003, p. xvi and that these differences are scientifically measurable. Nisbett's book Intelligence and How to Get It: Why Schools and Cultures Count (2009) argues that environmental factors dominate genetic factors in determining intelligence. The book reviewed extensive favorable attention in the press and from some fellow academics; for example, University of Pennsylvania psychologist Daniel Osherson wrote that the book was a \\"hugely important analysis of the determinants of IQ\\". On the other hand, more critical reviewers argued that the book failed to grapple with the strongest evidence for genetic factors in individual and group intelligence differences. With Edward E. Jones, he named the actor‚Äìobserver bias, the phenomenon where people acting and people observing use different explanations for why a behavior occurs. This is an important concept in attribution theory, and refers to the tendency to attribute one's own behaviour to situational factors, other people's behaviour to their disposition. Jones and Nisbett's own explanation for this was that our attention is focussed on the situation when we are actors, but on the person when we are observers, although other explanations have been advanced for the actor-observer bias.

The Chesapeake Western Railway is an intrastate railroad in west-central Virginia and it is an operating subsidiary of the Norfolk Southern Railway. It extended from Elkton, Virginia on the South Fork of the Shenandoah River in Rockingham County to Stokesville, Virginia in Augusta County at the foot of the Allegheny Mountains. At Elkton, it interchanged with the Norfolk and Western Railway. At Harrisonburg, Virginia it interchanged with the Southern Railway. Construction began in 1895 in Harrisonburg by the Chesapeake and Western Railroad, and proceed both east and west. To the west, Bridgewater, Virginia was the original terminus, but the line was extended to Stokesville by 1901 by the newly reorganized Chesapeake Western Railway. In 1933 the line was cut back to Bridgewater, and later to Dayton, Virginia. To the east the line reached Elkton by 1896, where the line's main yard and shops were constructed. In 1938 the line was bought by the line's general manager, Don Thomas, with the help of Norfolk and Western, which assumed direct control in 1954. In 1942, the Baltimore and Ohio's Valley Road of Virginia line, which ran between Harrisonburg and Lexington, Virginia was purchased, though the portion from Staunton, Virginia to Lexington was promptly dismantled. Later, a portion of the same line to the north of Harrisonburg as far as Mount Jackson, Virginia was added. The Chesapeake Western Railway operates three rail lines under Norfolk Southern ownership: *Chesapeake Western (Elkton to Dayton) *Chesapeake Western (Harrisonburg to Pleasant Valley) *Chesapeake Western (Harrisonburg to Bowman) At one time, the Chesapeake Western Railway operated its trackage as one rail line called the Chesapeake Western Branch under Norfolk Southern ownership, before it was split into three separate rail lines.

But I've been getting different kinds of reactions. After the game I had my church friends sending me messages saying, 'You handled it really well, it was very Kingdom the way you dealt with it'. Then I had other mates saying, 'You should have smashed him'.\\" Nevertheless, the NRL decided to step in and issued a $10,000 fine to Gallen.

He was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1964 and was selected in 1969 as a quarterback on the National Football League 1920s All-Decade Team. A native of St. Louis, Conzelman played college football for the 1918 Great Lakes Navy Bluejackets team that won the 1919 Rose Bowl. In 1919, he was an All-Missouri Valley Conference quarterback for the Washington University Pikers football team. He then played ten seasons as a quarterback, halfback, placekicker, and coach in the National Football League (NFL) for the Decatur Staleys (1920), Rock Island Independents (1921‚Äì1922), Milwaukee Badgers (1922‚Äì1924), Detroit Panthers (1925‚Äì1926), and Providence Steam Roller (1927‚Äì1929). He was also a team owner in Detroit and, as player-coach, led the 1928 Providence Steam Roller team to an NFL championship. From 1932 to 1939, Conzelman was the head football coach for the Washington University Bears football team, leading the program to Missouri Valley Conference championships in 1934, 1935, and 1939. He served as head coach of the NFL's Chicago Cardinals from 1940 to 1942 and again from 1946 to 1948. He led the Cardinals to an NFL championship in 1947 and Western Division championships in 1947 and 1948. He was also an executive with the St. Louis Browns in Major League Baseball from 1943 to 1945. Early years Conzelman was born James Gleason Ryan Dunn in St. Louis, Missouri, in 1898. He was the son of James Dunn and Marguerite Ryan, though his father died when he was still a baby. In 1902, his mother married a dentist, Oscar Conzelman, who adopted him. Conzelman attended Loyola Academy and later Central High School in St. Louis. He began playing football as a halfback at Central High in 1914. After a realignment of high school districts in 1915, Conzelman attended McKinley High School. At McKinley, Conzelman was the quarterback of the football team, competed on the basketball and track teams, was president of the boys' athletic association, and served as sergeant-at-arms of the Class of 1916. He led the 1915 McKinley football team to a league championship. College and military service Conzelman enrolled at Washington University in St. Louis in 1916. He played freshman football that year but enlisted in the United States Navy when the United States entered World War I in 1917. He was stationed at the Great Lakes Naval Station north of Chicago. During two years of service, he played for the Naval Station's football, baseball, and basketball teams. He also took up boxing while in the Navy and won a championship in the middleweight division. He was the quarterback of the 1918 Great Lakes Navy Bluejackets football team that defeated previously undefeated Navy and then defeated the Mare Island Marines by a 17‚Äì0 score in the 1919 Rose Bowl. Conzelman's teammates on the 1918 Great Lakes team included George Halas and Paddy Driscoll, all three of whom were later inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame. After the war, Conzelman turned down offers to become a professional boxer and returned to Washington University in February 1919. He played for the 1919 Washington Pikers football team that compiled a 5‚Äì2 record and outscored opponents 127 to 30. Conzelman was selected as the All-Missouri Valley Conference quarterback for 1919. He also was the catcher for the 1920 Washington University baseball team and organized an orchestra, played banjo, and wrote songs while attending Washington University. During the spring semester of 1920, Conzelman lost his eligibility to play football due to academic deficiencies. His father had also died in May 1919, and he withdrew from school to help support his mother and younger siblings. In June 1920, Conzelman announced that he would not return to Washington University in the fall. He spent the summer leading an orchestra in Arkansas. Professional football player=Decatur Staleys In mid- October 1920, Conzelman joined the Decatur Staleys (later renamed the Chicago Bears) of the newly formed American Professional Football Association (later renamed the NFL). He planned to relocate permanently to Decatur and also play for the Staleys baseball and basketball teams. Conzelman was reunited at Decatur with player-coach George Halas, with whom Conzelman had played on the 1918 Great Lakes team. In Conzelman's first game with the Staleys, he scored the game's only touchdown on a 43-yard run. Playing at the halfback position, Conzelman handled punting, placekicking and passing for the Staleys in the important games and was selected as a second-team player on the 1920 All-Pro team. The 1920 Staleys compiled a 10‚Äì1‚Äì2 record and finished in second place in the league. Rock Island Independents In October 1921, Conzelman joined the Rock Island Independents as the team's captain and coach. At age 23, he was one of the youngest coaches in NFL history. He led Rock Island to a 4‚Äì1 record during the 1921 season. Milwaukee Badgers After starting the season with Rock Island, Conzelman signed with the Milwaukee Badgers in the middle of their 1922 season. He was the Badgers' coach and a player for the final three games of the 1922 season during which the team went 0‚Äì3. During the 1923 season, Conzelman, as player and coach, led the Badgers to a 7‚Äì2‚Äì3 record and a third-place finish out of 20 teams in the NFL. Conzelman was also the team's second highest scorer with four touchdowns and two extra points. During the 1924 season, Conzelman remained with the Badgers as a player only. The team's record fell to 5‚Äì8 and 12th place in the NFL. Detroit Panthers In 1925, Conzelman organized and became the owner of a new NFL franchise in Detroit, which he named the Detroit Panthers. He reportedly paid a franchise fee of only $50 to the NFL to acquire the Detroit franchise. In addition to being the owner, Conzelman was also the team's coach and a player during the 1925 and 1926 NFL seasons. During the 1925 season, Conzelman's Detroit club compiled an 8‚Äì2‚Äì2 record, played at Navin Field, and outscored opponents by a combined total of 129 to 39. During the 1926 season, the Panthers dropped to 4‚Äì6‚Äì2 and compiled a record of 0‚Äì3‚Äì2 in the month of November. The team's attendance in Detroit was approximately 3,000 persons per game, not enough for Conzelman to make a profit. Accordingly, in August 1927, Conzelman sold the Detroit franchise back to the NFL for $1,200.Richard Bak, A Place for Summer, pp. 252‚Äì253. Conzelman later recalled: \\"We simply were ahead of our time in Detroit. The town wasn't quite ready for pro football.\\"Richard Bak, A Place for Summer, p. 248. Providence Steam Roller In August 1927, following his decision to sell the Detroit franchise back to the league, Conzelman signed as a player, manager and coach for the Providence Steam Roller. Conzelman brought players Gus Sonnenberg and Eddie Lynch with him from Detroit. Conzelman and Wildcat Wilson were the leading scorers on the 1927 Providence team, each with four touchdowns. The Steam Roller finished the 1927 season an 8‚Äì5‚Äì1 record and a fifth-place finish in the NFL. Conzelman led the 1928 Providence team to an 8‚Äì1‚Äì2 record and the club's first NFL championship. The team's passing combination of Wildcat Wilson to Conzelman was the most effective in the league and accounted for most of the club's yardage until Conzelman twisted knee ligaments on a reception against the Yankees. Despite being unable to play in the second half of the season due to the injury, Conzelman was unanimously voted by his teammates as the team's most valuable player. In his final season as an NFL player-coach, Conzelman led the 1929 Providence team to a 4‚Äì6‚Äì2 record. Coaching career=St. Louis Gunners In the fall of 1931, Conzelman served as the head coach of the St. Louis Gunners, an independent professional football team sponsored by a local field artillery unit of the National Guard. The Gunners posted a 5‚Äì2‚Äì1 record in 1931. After a game against the NFL's Chicago Cardinals, Chicago captain Ernie Nevers called the Gunners the \\"best independent club we have ever faced.\\" Washington University In January 1932, Conzelman returned to Washington University in St. Louis as the school's head football coach. He became the school's first alumnus to lead the football team. Over the next eight years, Conzelman led Washington University Bears football team to Missouri Valley Conference championships in 1934, 1935, and 1939, and compiled an overall record of 40‚Äì35‚Äì2. In January 1940, Conzelman tendered his resignation as head coach of the Washington University football team, but the resignation was not accepted by the athletic board. The university chancellor directed Conzelman to attend an alumni rally in his support. Conzelman appeared and announced that he would not withdraw his resignation, though he would continue to support the program from the outside. Newspaper accounts indicate that he may have been fired under pressure from a powerful \\"anti-Conzelman\\" group of alumni in downtown St. Louis. Chicago Cardinals (first stint) In April 1940, Conzelman was hired as the head coach of the NFL's Chicago Cardinals. He replaced Ernie Nevers in the position. In his first stint as head coach of the Cardinals, Conzelmean served three years with the Cardinals from 1940 to 1942, leading the club to a combined three-year record of 8‚Äì22. St. Louis Browns Conzelman's tenure as head coach of the Cardinals was interrupted by a two-years stint as an administrator in Major League Baseball for the St. Louis Browns. In June 1943, he resigned his job as head coach of the Cardinals and was hired as director of public relations and assistant to Donald Lee Barnes, president and owner of the Browns. He remained with the Browns for two years and was said to be the \\"secret weapon\\" of the 1944 St. Louis Browns team that won the American League pennant. Conzelman resigned his post with the club in August 1945. Chicago Cardinals (second stint) In late November 1945, Conzelman was hired for a second time to serve as head coach of the Chicago Cardinals starting with the 1946 NFL season. During the 1947 Chicago Cardinals season, the Cardinals with their \\"Million Dollar Backfield\\" compiled a 9‚Äì3 record and defeated the Philadelphia Eagles in the 1947 NFL Championship Game. Conzelman's 1948 Cardinals team compiled an 11‚Äì1 record during the regular season, led the NFL in offense with an average of 32.9 points per game, and lost to the Eagles in the 1948 NFL Championship Game. In their second stint under Conzelman, the Cardinals compiled a 26‚Äì9 record from 1946 to 1948. On January 7, 1949, three weeks after the loss in the 1948 Championship Game, Conzelman resigned as the Cardinals' head coach. He had been working for D'Arcy Advertising Co. for the prior two years during the off-season and stated that he was resigning his coaching position to devote his full efforts to the advertising firm. The Cardinals' management said at the time that Conzelman's resignation was unexpected and \\"came like a bolt from the blue.\\" Later years and honors After resigning as coach of the Cardinals in 1949, Conzelman continued working as an advertising executive. He also made occasional appearances in stage and opera productions. Conzelman was the model for the fallen French soldier in the 1926 monument by Frederick MacMonnies of the Battle of the Marne at Meaux, France.https://www.nytimes.com/1970/08/01/archives/jimmy-conzelman-72-is-dead- coached-cardinals-to-grid-title- member.htmlhttps://ww1revisited.com/2014/03/03/american-memorial-meaux/ During his retirement and posthumously, Conzelman received numerous honors for his contributions to the sport of football. These honors include the following: * In February 1964, Conzelman was chosen by a committee on which he served to be part of the Pro Football Hall of Fame's second induction class.

As of June 2007, a total of 31 volumes have been published by Daiwon C.I.. Summary In the 'Era of the Warring States', Emperor Moosunje has gotten his hands on a powerful sword, known as the PaChun. The PaChun absorbs the blood of humans and gives its wielder amazing power rival only... to the power of its counterpart- the PaSa. The owner of the PaSa, Rey Yan, is, unknowingly, part of a plot devised by the demonic Prime Minister Shiyan and his brother to overthrow the Demon Emperor, lest he becomes the Grand Emperor of Heavenly Destruction and gains control over all three realms. After Emperor Moosunje proves incapable of controlling the PaChun, Prime Minister Shiyan kidnaps Jaryoon, King of Hahyun to receive the sword. Jaryoon, normally a kind and just leader, is transformed into a monster whose mission it is to conquer and 'unite' all the neighboring kingdoms and make Rey Yan suffer. CharactersRealms *Human realm: The realm where all the humans live. It separates the Divine Realm and the Demon Realm and thus has beings from both interacting with humans. *Divine realm: The realm where all the gods and demi-gods live. In the last 500 years, it was changed from a paradise to a land of blood by the Second Son. *Demon realm: The realm where all the demons live. A brutal land where only the strongest survive.  History  As orphans, Rey and his sister had been living in the streets as young children, and one day decided to go to the palace to meet the emperor, hoping that he would be able to help them. When they arrived, they were each given a sword, and sent into a deep dungeon-like pit where many other orphans were also trapped. The steep walls were unclimbable, and all of the children starved there for several weeks, with only each other and a sword for company. After a long time, the top of the pit slid open, and two large barrels of food were dumped down into the pit. This, of course, was not nearly enough to feed all of the starving children, and they soon realized the truth: They would have to kill each other for the food. Rey's sister was \\"lost to the darkness\\", and Rey fell into a deep, exhausted coma, waking to find a demon stone implanted on his forehead because he was one of the strongest who survived. How he got out and met Shyao is unclear, but they were taken in by a master who taught them of the arts of fighting, magically and physically. However, the powerful demon White Tiger destroyed their master, and Rey vowed revenge. Before dying, their master entrusted the PaSa sword to Rey, telling him to use it wisely. However, as the sword became part of Rey, so did its longings. Thus, in order for the PaSa sword to maintain its tremendous power, it must be constantly fueled by demon blood, thus Rey must continue killing if he hopes to escape the wrath of the heavenly soldiers and sages, and also to protect himself from the PaSa sword's rival and companion, the PaChun sword. Although Rey's raw power is rather remarkable by human standards, his swordsmanship (and most importantly, learning to merge with the PaSa sword's spirit) leave much to be desired. Master Chen Kaihu takes him in as his disciple (having failed to lure Kuochien away from the ladies long enough). The sword spirit, however, does not find the idea of Rey learning to control his power too exciting as this means he will have a harder time possessing him.

Background Allan Singer was a Montreal printer who mostly served anglophone clientele. For over 30 years, his store front had a sign advertising his store that was written in English only. He was charged under the Charter of the French Language for having an English sign. Singer and several others brought an action to strike down provisions of the French Language Charter and the Regulation respecting the language of commerce and business, which required commercial signs to be in French only, as being laws that were ultra vires the province, and in violation of his freedom of expression under section 2(b) of the Canadian Charter and section 3 of the Quebec Charter, right to equality under 15(1) of the Canadian Charter, and his right against discrimination under section 10 of the Quebec Charter. Issues The issues before the Supreme Court were: # whether the Language Charter was valid provincial law # whether the provisions prohibiting English signs violated the right to freedom of expression under section 2(b) of the Canadian Charter # and if so, could it be saved under section 1 of the Canadian Charter. Judgment of the Court In a unanimous decision, the Supreme Court held that the Language Charter concerned a valid provincial matter but it violated Singer's freedom of expression under section 2(b) of the Canadian Charter as it prohibited the use of English. The Court rejected Singer's argument that the law restricted mobility as protected under the Charter. The law only established conditions for doing business but did not restrict anyone's comings or goings. On the federalism issue, the Court rejected Singer's argument that the law constituted Criminal law under the Constitution Act, 1867. Though there was a prohibition and a penalty, the Act as a whole it constituted a regulatory scheme directed as the linguistic mode of certain commercial activities, and did not resemble any traditional criminal matters based on morality or public order.

The number of rock piles created in this manner in natural areas has recently begun to worry conservationists because they can misdirect hikers, expose the soil to erosion, aesthetically intrude upon the natural landscape, and serve no purpose.  Description  Rock balancing can be a performance art, a spectacle, or a devotion, depending upon the interpretation by its audience. Essentially, it involves placing some combination of rock or stone in arrangements which require patience and sensitivity to generate, and which appear to be physically impossible while actually being only highly improbable. The rock balancer may work for free or for pay, as an individual or in a group, and their intents and the audiences' interpretations may vary given the situation or the venue. Rock balancing has also been described as a type of problem solving, and some artists consider it as a skill in awareness. Some work has been described as a magic trick for the mind. As with other forms of independent public art, some installations may be created in remote areas where there may be little or no audience.The World Atlas of Street Art and Graffiti, Rafael Schacter, 2013, . A cairn, used to mark trails, is also a collection of stacked rocks, but these are typically more durable.  Styles  * Rock Stackingrocks laid flat upon each other to great height. * Classic balanceeach rock balanced inline. * Counterbalancelower rocks depend on the weight of upper rocks to maintain balance. * Archrocks form a structure that spans a space. Similar to the architecture of ancient stone bridges. * Free stylea combination of two or more of the above. File:Stil stapeln.pngRock stacking File:Rockbalance.jpgClassic balance File:Rock Balancing.jpgFree style (counterbalance and classic balance) File:Arch Balance (cropped).jpgAn arch (with classic balance detail)  Events  2014 Rock Stacking World Championship in Llano, Texas The annual Llano Earth Art Festival in Texas includes a rock stacking competition called the \\"Rock Stacking World Championship,\\" held on the banks of the Llano River. Competitions during the 2020 edition include \\"tallest rock stack\\", \\"best rock balancer\\", \\"best rock arch builder\\", \\"most rocks in a single tower\\", and \\"most artistic rock stack design\\".  In context of math and physics  The stability of a rock structure depends on the location of each rock's center of mass in relation to its support points. If other rocks are also on top or contacting it at any point, then the forces (due to weight) of other rocks also play a role. For an individual rock to be stable, it usually requires at least three contact points to rest on, forming a \\"tripod.\\" Generally, the closer together the points in the tripod, the less stable the rock will be (thus making it more precarious, and becoming a rock balance sculpture - and many would argue more beautiful). Based on position and shape, the three points of contact may be so close that it appears to be stably resting on only a single point. A rock at the top of a sculpture, for example, can have a rounded shape, but be approximately flat and oriented horizontally, and be in a state of equilibrium. The stability of a structure is also affected by the friction between rocks, especially when rocks are set upon one another at an angle. A structure may topple over (collapse) based on the magnitude of other phenomena, such as wind, rain, snow, and localized ground vibration, or general seismic activity.  Opposition  Some visitors to natural areas who wish to experience nature in its undisturbed state object to this practice, especially when it intrudes on public spaces such as national parks, national forests and state parks. The practice of rock balancing is claimed to be able to be made without changes to nature; environmental artist Lila Higgings has defended it as compatible with leave-no-trace ideals if rocks are used without impacting wildlife and are later returned to their original places, and some styles of rock balancing are short-lived. However, \\"disturbing or collecting natural features (plants, rocks, etc.) is prohibited\\" in U.S. national parks because these acts may harm the flora and fauna dependent on them. Some outdoor enthusiasts are also in opposition as rock stacks or \\"cairns\\" are traditionally used for the purpose of navigation in some back woods trails. Having ornamental rock stacks may confuse those who rely on them as trail markers.

MacNaughton was director and producer for all but four of the forty five episodes of Monty Python's Flying Circus from 1969 to 1974, director of the group's first feature film And Now for Something Completely Different in 1971 and director of their two German episodes, Monty Python's Fliegender Zirkus in 1971 and 1972. In 1973 the production team shared the BAFTA Award for Best Light Entertainment Programme for Monty Python's Flying Circus. Early life Ian MacNaughton was born in Glasgow and educated at Strathallan School in Perthshire. His older brother was killed in World War II. He spent a year in medical school before abandoning his plans to become a doctor and joining the Royal Marines for a year in 1945. While serving with the Royal Marines in an officers' training squad at Deal, Kent, he was offered the chance to act with the Globe Players which was the Royal Marines amateur dramatics group. After he was demobilised in 1946, he returned to Glasgow, where his father hoped he would join the family firm. However, he decided to apply for a one-year pre-RADA course in London, which he completed, though he did not enter the Academy itself. Actor On his return to Scotland, MacNaughton spent several years acting on stage, regularly appearing in productions at the Citizens Theatre in Glasgow and the Gateway Theatre in Edinburgh. Most notably in 1948 he appeared in Tyrone Guthrie's production of David Lyndsay's A Satire of the Three Estates at the Edinburgh Festival. MacNaughton started his film career with a small role as the police constable in the 1953 film Laxdale Hall, a British romantic comedy set in a village in the Scottish Highlands. In the same year he also had a small role in Rob Roy, the Highland Rogue as Callum MacGregor. In 1955 MacNaughton moved back to London, and was cast as Able Seaman McIntosh in Seagulls over Sorrento and as Haggis in the 1956 science fiction film X the Unknown. He then appeared in three episodes of the British television comedy show Hancock's Half Hour and had small roles in the films The Silent Enemy and The Safecracker. MacNaughton continued to appear in small roles in both television and film throughout 1958 and 1959 before playing the role of Kilmartin Dalrymple in all 30 episodes of the British sitcom Tell It to the Marines. The comedy revolved around the antics of a tough, boisterous Royal Marine squadron who find themselves billeted with some Royal Navy personnel. Thereafter he had a succession of small roles including the television series Silent Evidence in 1962, in which he played the character of Angus MacCrae. In the same year he also played the character of Michael George Hartley in Lawrence of Arabia. Director and producer While appearing in the BBC drama series Silent Evidence, MacNaughton answered an ad for a BBC training course in television directing, for which he was accepted. In 1963 and 1964 he directed two episodes of Teletale and in 1965 an episode of Z-Cars. MacNaughton continued to act in numerous small roles for television and film, including Dr. Finlay's Casebook in 1964 and The Avengers in 1965. In 1966 and 1967 he directed all 52 episodes of a BBC series called This Man Craig, which was set in a large comprehensive school in the fictional Scottish village of Strathaird. The series revolved around the daily life of schoolmaster Ian Craig, who as one of six housemasters had to keep an eye on the problems of over 300 pupils. Between 1967 and 1968, he also directed eight episodes of Dr. Finlay's Casebook. In 1969 MacNaughton directed and produced the first series of Spike Milligan's Q, a surreal British comedy television sketch show consisting of seven episodes. The show had a big influence on the Monty Python team. In The Python Autobiography by the Pythons, Michael Palin mentions meeting their directors. \\"One was Ian MacNaughton, director of the Spike Milligan Q5 series which we all thought was one of the best comedy shows on TV and certainly the most far ahead...\\" (p. 218). He describes himself and Terry Jones as being so impressed with the Q... show that they specifically sought out MacNaughton to direct their own series.\\" Between 1969 and 1974 MacNaughton would produce and direct all but four of the 45 episodes of Monty Python's Flying Circus. Having accepted the job of director and producer, MacNaughton announced to the Pythons' dismay that he had to take a holiday and would be unavailable for the first four shows, which were consequently directed by John Howard Davies. Initially, there was some friction between MacNaughton and the Pythons because of their close involvement with the way the show was directed, but by the end of the first series he had become one of the team and his contribution was significant. In 1970 the team filmed the second series of Monty Python's Flying Circus. In 1971 MacNaughton directed the team's first film, And Now For Something Completely Different, which was a remake of the most popular sketches from the show's first two series. In the same year, MacNaughton directed the group in the first of two German specials filmed in Bavaria called, Monty Python's Fliegender Zirkus. The following year he directed the second episode of the Python's German specials, another comedy sketch show starring Spike Milligan, and the third series of Monty Python's Flying Circus. MacNaughton directed episodes of several television series in 1973 and in 1974, including the pilot episode of Rising Damp with Leonard Rossiter, which received good reviews. Later that year he filmed the fourth and final series of Monty Python. In 1975, the second series of Spike Milligan's Q was commissioned by the BBC called Q6. MacNaughton directed Q6 in 1975, Q7 in 1977, Q8 in 1978 and Q9 in 1980. In 1976, MacNaughton directed another pilot comedy sketch show called Out of the Trees, starring Monty Python alumnus Graham Chapman. They only filmed one episode, as the show was not commissioned by the BBC. In 1977 he directed five episodes of Middlemen, starring Frank Windsor. In 1979, he made the short film Le P√©tomane about Joseph Pujol, starring Leonard Rossiter. From the late 1970s onwards MacNaughton was based in Munich and he continued to work as a director in television and on stage. In 1980 he directed six episodes of the German comedy show, Harry Hocker l√§√üt nicht locker, starring Harald Wolff. He also directed numerous operas and musicals, working in venues around the world, including Israel, Yugoslavia, Norway and Austria. In 1996 he directed Australian composer George Dreyfus' comedy, The Marx Sisters in Bielefeld and in 1997 Gerhard Baumann's Nyx in Munich. At the theatre in Hall, near Innsbruck in Austria he directed plays by Otto Grunmandl. Personal life In 1958, MacNaughton married actress Rita Davies, with whom he had two children and who frequently guest-starred in episodes of Monty Python. They were married for 20 years before divorcing in 1978. In 1995, he married his second wife, Ike Ott, whom he had met while filming Monty Pythons German episodes in Bavaria in 1972. Death In 2001 MacNaughton suffered extensive injuries in a car accident while returning to his home in Munich, Germany from the first night of a translation of Alan Ayckbourn's play Seasons Greetings in Hall, Austria. He eventually died from these injuries on 10 December 2002.

At the port in New York he observes the shady Miss Kelly as she makes off with ship passenger Leonard Wilson's (Victor Jory) wallet. Sabourin makes a romantic play for Kelly, only to steal the wallet when her back is turned. Kelly's estranged husband Chuck (Bob Morgan) pursues and shoots Sabourin in the street, but Sabourin escapes by pushing Chuck into the path of an oncoming car. On a tip from the doctor who removes the bullet, Sabourin invests in a company that manufactures the drug penicillin. He fraudulently uses a $20,000 cashier's check from inside the stolen wallet to purchase the stock. Encountering the wealthy Mrs. Ryan (Zsa Zsa Gabor), widow of a prominent businessman, Sabourin earns a considerable sum of money for her as well by tipping her to the stock. Mrs. Ryan writes Sabourin a $20,000 loan, which he uses to cover his forged check from Wilson. His stockbroker, O'Hara (John Hoyt), spots the fraud but helps Sabourin in exchange for a share in his profit. Sabourin uses a financial statement he found in Wilson's wallet to blackmail Wilson into selling him his oil company. Sabourin orchestrates a fake oil strike to gain profit, but his investors get the last laugh when oil is really found on the property and the stock soars to $30 a share. Sabourin, O'Hara, Miss Kelly and Sabourin's lawyer Bauman (Werner Klemperer) become successful by buying struggling companies, manipulating the price of stock and throwing the companies into receivership. As he becomes increasingly \\"successful\\", Sabourin begins courting a number of women romantically, including Mrs. Ryan's young secretary, Stephanie North (Nancy Gates). He invites North to a party and finances her ambition to become an actress. When she rejects his advances, he attempts to thwart her career, but is unsuccessful, as her producer recognizes that North does indeed have talent. Sabourin then courts the affluent Edith van Renssalaer (Coleen Gray), married to a wealthy businessman. Sabourin attempts to interfere in her marriage to gain control of her stock and form a new uranium company, but Zina resurfaces one night and reveals that she learned he was responsible for his brother's death. He pledges his love to her and remorse for Gerry's death, lying through his teeth. Zina believes him, but when she sees him conspire with Edith, she kills herself and writes a note implicating Sabourin. The police arrest him, while Edith abandons him. As Sabourin's embezzling is also uncovered, the court begins an attempt to deport him to Czechoslovakia. Knowing that the communists will confiscate his money there, Sabourin instructs Miss Kelly to contact his mother. The mother is initially happy to see her son, but refuses his plan to tell the court that Sabourin was born illegitimately in Switzerland and disowns him. Miss Kelly, who has long concealed her love and concern for Sabourin, implores him to return the stolen money and tells him that his way does not work out in the end. Initially reluctant, Sabourin finally decides to return the money. No sooner does he endorse the stock certificates, O'Hara (who hitherto had qualms concerning their crooked dealings) arrives and confronts him at gunpoint. O'Hara announces that he and Bauman intend to let Sabourin be the fall guy and take all the money for themselves. A struggle ensues over O'Hara's gun in which Sabourin manages to kill O'Hara but is himself fatally wounded. As he returns home dejectedly, he sees all of his would-be victims emerging successful as wells as a billboard with the verse Mark 8:36 written on it. He also meets Kelly, and tells her that he returned the money. When Sabourin returns home, he pleads with his mother, but she refuses to see him. He then calls Kelly, leaving a message telling her that he really did love her in his own way and begging for forgiveness. Finally, he collapses on the bed and dies. The story ends as Kelly finishes reporting the story to the police and Sabourin's mother, who laments that she did not forgive her son for his crimes before he died. Kelly then surmises that it is possible Sabourin found forgiveness and peace in death, taking one last look around his magnificent house as she leaves.

Edwards was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1969. College career After graduation from high school in 1928 in Clarkston, Washington, Edwards played college football at Washington State College in nearby Pullman from 1929 to 1931.

He chose the highest bid: $1,500 for 10 games from the Braves, a team that would later become the Boston Redskins and then move to Washington, D.C. in 1937. Edwards played for the Braves/Redskins for nine seasons, winning All-NFL honors from major media outlets every year of his career except his last one. Edwards sustained a career-ending injury during a coin-tossing ceremony prior to a game against the New York Giants in 1940. After calling the coin toss and shaking hands with college teammate Mel Hein (the Giants' captain), Edwards attempted to pivot around to head back to his sideline. However, his cleats caught in the grass and his oft-injured knee gave way, ending his season and ultimately his career.

Between 1844 and 1950, over 14,000 tower clocks were made at the works. The company's most successful and prominent period of activity as a bellfounder was in the 1920s and 1930s, when it was responsible for supplying many important bells and carillons for sites across Britain and around the world. A successor company continues operation in Bletchingley, Surrey, under the Gillett & Johnston name, engaged in clock- making and clock and carillon repair. History Clock on Manchester Town Hall made by Gillett & Bland, predecessor to Gillett & Johnston The company traced its roots to a clockmaking business established by William Gillett in Hadlow, Kent, in the early 19th century. In 1837, Gillett moved his business to Clerkenwell, London; and in 1844 to the site in what later became known as Union Road, Thornton Heath, Croydon, which would remain its home for the next 113 years. Charles Bland became a partner in 1854, and the company subsequently traded as Gillett & Bland. In 1877, Arthur A. Johnston (c.1851‚Äì1916) bought a partnership, and shortly afterwards extended the company's output by establishing a bell foundry. The business became known as Gillett, Bland & Co until Bland's death in c.1884, when the name was changed to Gillett & Co. The name Gillett & Johnston seems to have been used from around 1887.Elphick 1970, pp. 169‚Äì70. Arthur Johnston's son, Cyril Frederick Johnston (1884‚Äì1950), joined the company in 1902, became a partner in 1907, and took over the firm following his father's death in 1916.Elphick 1970, p. 170. He developed an interest in the theory of bell-tuning, and greatly expanded the bellfounding side of the business. In 1905 he redeveloped the works, and installed a large vertical tuning lathe. He was particularly interested in the manufacture of carillons, which presented special problems of tuning distinct from those of church bells.Elphick 1970, pp. 173‚Äì4. During the First World War, the factory suspended its regular business and became involved in the manufacture of munitions, employing over 1,250 men and women. The firm became a limited liability company in 1925, initially trading as the Croydon Bell Foundry Ltd (although the name \\"Gillett and Johnston\\" still appeared on bells).Bliss and Sharpe 1986, p. 31. It reverted to the name Gillett & Johnston Ltd in 1930. Cyril Johnston resigned as managing director in 1948, following disagreements over company policy, and died suddenly two years later in 1950.Elphick 1970, p. 175. Following his departure, Henry Michael Howard took over, and some bells were cast in his name.Dalton 2005, p. 972. The business also now diversified into other engineering activities, and new subsidiaries (Microcastings Ltd and Bourdon Tools Ltd) were established. However, it experienced financial difficulties, caused in part by changing architectural tastes, and a falling-off in demand for traditional tower clocks and cast bells. In 1957 the business was taken into receivership and the works were closed down. Successor company The business was sold in 1958 to the Bath Portland Group, which already owned Synchronome, a rival office clockmaking company. For a few years, the tower clock side was established in Wembley as Gillett-Johnston Clocks Ltd. In 1962 it was bought by Cecil Hector Coombes (d. 1972), who had previously worked for Gillett & Johnston in Croydon. He returned the firm to Croydon in 1963 as Gillett and Johnston (Croydon) Ltd, basing it first in Clarendon Road (1963‚Äì1970), and then in Sanderstead Road (1970‚Äì2012). In 2012 the company moved to new premises in Bletchingley, Surrey. It remains in the Coombes family, and undertakes clockmaking, and the restoration and maintenance of tower clocks, carillons and bells. The Gillett & Johnston clocktower in Union Road, decorated for peace celebrations in 1919 at the end of the First World War Union Road site The company occupied the same site in Union Road, off Whitehorse Road, Thornton Heath, Croydon, from 1844 until the closure of the works in 1957. In 1868 a tall clock tower was built as a \\"working advertisement\\", and to provide a facility in which newly cast bells could be tested: this became a prominent local landmark. Each of the clockfaces was different and unique. A carillon manufactured by the company was installed in the tower in 1920. After the company's closure in 1957, the premises were given over to other industrial uses. The main buildings, including the clock tower, were eventually demolished in 1997, the clockfaces having been removed and placed in storage. After some years standing vacant, part of the foundry building found a new purchaser in 2003 to become a church of the Emmanuel Inspirational Church of God. The greater part of the site is now occupied by a self-storage facility. The \\"Mail Coach\\" pub on the corner of Union Road and Whitehorse Road was renamed \\"Ye Olde Clocktower\\" in memory of the firm and its works. Archives Surviving records of the foundry include a register of bells cast, 1877‚Äì1919; notes relating to work on bells, 1879‚Äì1907; and 17 volumes of bell tuning books, 1907‚Äì1951. They are now held at the Museum of Croydon (ref. AR 1).

She claimed to have been born in 1766, if so making her 112 years old at the time of her death in 1878, but her case has not been verified or fully proven. Life=Early years Spanish colonies in 1795, not long after Eulalia's birth Eulalia P√©rez was born in Loreto, the capital on the Baja California Peninsula of the Las Californias Province in the Viceroyalty of New Spain (in what is today the modern Mexican state of Baja California Sur), to Diego P√©rez of Salamanca, Spain and Antonia Rosalia Cotes (or Cota). Macedonio Gonzalez, one of Eulalia's nephews, knew Antonia Cota as Lucia Valenzuela according to Eulalia's English born son-in-law and author Michael C. White, aka: Miguel Blanco. Diego P√©rez was a ship captain, thought to come from Salamanca‚Äîfamily members have been unable to trace records of his commission through the Archivo General de Indias or in Loreto, which has been ravaged by hurricanes over the centuries. Her siblings were Teresa, Petra, Juana, Josefa, Bernardo, and Le√≥n. According to family lore, Capitan P√©rez taught his daughter how to read and write, a fact later important to her survival and eventual prominence. She married Spanish army Sergeant Miguel Antonio Guill√©n at age fifteen. He was in the company at the Presidio of San Diego. They moved from Baja about 1800‚Äîon foot in those days‚Äîto the garrison at the new Mission San Gabriel, with their children Petra, Rosaria, and Isidoro. Miguel died while later serving at the garrison at San Diego, leaving P√©rez with several children. Misi√≥n San Gabriel Misi√≥n San Gabriel Arc√°ngel (April 2005), where Eulalia lived many years P√©rez managed to obtain employment at Misi√≥n San Gabriel, initially as cook and midwife for those such as Governor P√≠o Pico. She was eventually made \\"keeper of the keys\\" (mayor doma) of the mission itself. Rancho del Rincon del San Pascual Map of Mexico by S. Augustus Mitchell (Philadelphia, 1847) that shows \\"New California\\" with north-eastern border at meridian leading north of Rio Grande headwaters: Mexico's rule over California greatly affected Eulalia's life When she retired, Mexican Governor Jos√© Figueroa rewarded P√©rez as the grantee of Rancho del Rinc√≥n de San Pascual with her husband Juan Marin√©..http://www.laokay.com/halac/FloresAdobe.htm laokay: Rancho San Pascual history . accessed 8/20/2010 Rancho San Pascual encompasses the present day cities of Pasadena, South Pasadena, and San Marino. This had been part of the homeland of the Tongva-Gabriele√±o Native Americans for thousands of years. Within the independent Mexican territory of Alta California, as a woman P√©rez was unable to have ownership of property in her own name, so she married retired Mexican artillery lieutenant Juan Marin√© (d. 1836). (According to descendants, the fathers at San Gabriel Mission made her the grant under Spanish rule; when Mexico acquired Alta California, P√©rez then married Juan Marine because Mexican law did not allow women to own land.) According to some descendants, Marin√© and his sons lost all the land in a short time by gambling. In another narrative, one of Marine's sons, Fruto, was an active soldier and could not take charge of the Rancho. He sold it to Jos√© P√©rez and Enrique Sep√∫lveda in 1839. Perez and Sep√∫lveda submitted a new land claim and in 1839 were re-granted their own title to Rancho San Pascual by Mexican Governor Juan Bautista Alvarado. Both built small adobe houses near the Arroyo Seco. Jose Perez died in 1841 and Enrique Sepulveda died in 1843, which left Rancho San Pascual abandoned until a new grantee later that year. Flores Adobe ‚Äì South Pasadena South Pasadena City Hall, near Eulalia's final home P√©rez lived in the Adobe Flores, the 1839 adobe headquarters of Juan Perez on Rancho San Pascual on the southern slope of Raymond Hill. It was restored by architect Carleton Winslow, Sr. in the early 20th century and is still standing on Foothill Street in South Pasadena, and is on the National Register of Historic Places. It was named after a Californio hero, General Jose Maria Flores, the commander of the Mexican forces in Alta California during the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War, who had camped near the adobe. She spent many years of her remaining life in the homes of various daughters, including that of Maria Rita de Guill√©n de la Ossa, wife of Jose Vicente de la Ossa, owner of Rancho de los Encinos, foundation of Encino, California. (What remains of that rancho is now Los Encinos State Historic Park.) Death Adobe house of 1850, built by Vicente de la Osa at Rancho Los Encinos, where Eulalia spent much time with one of her children P√©rez died in the Los Angeles area on June 11, 1878. Her death certificate, located in the Santa Ana courthouse records that she lived to be 140, but descendants for the most part agree on more conservative figures like 110 or 112 years old, making her a famous centenarian of early California and of U.S. history. Eulalia P√©rez de Guill√©n Marin√© is one of only two non-clergy buried with the priests in the San Gabriel Mission courtyard cemetery. Although there are an unknown number of Native Americans from the Kizh tribe or Gabrielino (as they were later identified due to their proximity to the Mission) in the courtyard cemetery, the priests were buried in a designated section immediately adjacent to the wall of the Mission in a place of honor. In Catholic tradition, burials closest to the most sacred areas of the church are reserved for individuals of stature, usually clergy. Eulalia being honored in this way (Thomas Workman- Temple II, Mission Historian being the other), was a highly unusual honor at that time for a woman: a marble bench inscribed with her name marks the spot. Her numerous descendants married other Californios from other founding Spanish and Mexican families of pre-statehood California.

A subtitled VHS release was published in North America by US Manga Corps on April 7, 1993.  Plot  The main character of the series is Yuzuru Shiga, one of the descendants of the expiring Shiga clan along with his cousin Azusa Shiga, the daughter of his father's older sister. In order to preserve the family legacy, Azusa's mother and Yuzuru's father agree to have cousins Azusa and Yuzuru marry each other when they are of age. Ten years later, Azusa's mother dies and Azusa goes to live with Yuzuru's family. Azusa fully intends on claiming that promise of marriage from Yuzuru in spite of it being wrought during their childhood. She has been waiting, faithful, not so as much speaking to another boy since that time. Yuzuru, however, has his own life as a high school student: He's the captain of the archery club, and he has a girlfriend named Satomi. Even though Yuzuru has paid no heed to the betrothal, Azusa has taken it very seriously and expects Yuzuru to fulfill their family expectations. When he was a child, Yuzuru also promised her directly that he‚Äôd stay with her, and she took it to heart. When Azusa sees Yuzuru with Satomi, she tries to scare Satomi off in the hope that Yuzuru will return to her; but instead, he goes back to Satomi. Azusa then decides she has to take care of Satomi permanently. And that‚Äôs no idle threat because, unknown to Yuzuru, Azusa is a demon because of a family curse, which first manifested itself after Azusa killed a group of boys who tried to rape her. Satomi tries to tell Yuzuru that Azusa is after her, but she can‚Äôt do it directly because Azusa is stalking her. Worse yet, Yuzuru, while aware that something strange is going on, is somewhat oblivious to Azusa‚Äôs actions.

It is tangential to the children's book series A Series of Unfortunate Events, and was published shortly before the thirteenth and final installment. According to its cover, the book is \\"suspiciously linked to Book the Thirteenth\\", although the British edition merely states that it \\"contains a clue to Book the Thirteenth\\". The book consists of thirteen letters, six from Beatrice Baudelaire II to Lemony Snicket, six from Lemony Snicket to Beatrice Baudelaire, and one from Lemony Snicket to his editor (one of these appears in every book in the main series, but this is the first time such a letter has been incorporated into the plot). However, the two Beatrices, despite sharing a name, are clearly separate individuals, and while Lemony Snicket's letters are plainly written beginning from his childhood and ending shortly before Violet Baudelaire is born, the Beatrice writing to Snicket is apparently writing after the events of The End. The older Beatrice is the one referred to throughout A Series of Unfortunate Events by Lemony Snicket as his deceased love, and her identity as the mother of the Baudelaire children from the series is revealed in The Beatrice Letters, but the younger Beatrice's identity is not directly explained, apart from the statement that she also has some connection to Violet, Klaus, and Sunny (although in The End it is revealed that she is the daughter of Kit Snicket). Kit's daughter later ends up being raised by the Baudelaire orphans. The book contains twelve punch-out letters (of the alphabet, as opposed to correspondence, although the ambiguity is intentional), and each is mentioned in different, interesting ways. An example is that the first letter is an E, juxtaposed against a card from Snicket to Beatrice, in which a map Snicket had drawn forms an E. The cardstock letters can appear to be anagrams of 'Beatrice Sank', Beatrice being the boat in the book The End and 'A Snicket Brae', as it has been said that Lemony Snicket lived in the hills for some time. The book also includes a poster of what appears to be the wreckage of 'The Beatrice', along with a cave, Klaus's glasses, Violet's hair ribbon, and Sunny's cookbooks. Kidsreads.com praised The Beatrice Letters, claiming \\"Snicket incorporates what could, surprisingly, be one of the most touching and heartfelt (if absurd) love letters ever written...[it] heightens the stakes, and the anticipation, for Snicket's eagerly awaited Book the Thirteenth.\\" Over 350,000 copies of the book were sold in the United States in 2006.

He was the eldest of the three sons of Bal≈°a I, and belonged to the Bal≈°iƒá family.  Life  ƒêuraƒë was the eldest son of Bal≈°a, a petty nobleman that held one village during the rule of Emperor Stefan Du≈°an (r. 1331‚Äì1355) and was said to be \\"kin to Nemanja\\". The family started taking Lower Zeta sometime following the death of Du≈°an in 1355. In 1362 the brothers murdered ƒêura≈° Ilijiƒá who had held Upper Zeta, and were then recognized as (provincial lords) of Zeta in charters of Stefan Uro≈° V (r. 1355‚Äì1371). In 1363, ƒêuraƒë declared war against the Thopias, an Albanian noble family which controlled northern Albania. The Matarangos, an Albanian noble family which controlled southern Albania, were allied with the Bal≈°iƒás as a result of a quarrel with the Thopias in the south. In the spring of 1364, Karlo Thopia took ƒêuraƒë captive due to a skirmish, ending Zetan involvement in the war. ƒêuraƒë was held captive until 1366 when Republic of Ragusa mediated peace and procured his release. In 1367, ƒêuraƒë is mentioned as the \\"baron of maritime Serbia\\". In January 1368, a Ragusan document reported that the three Bal≈°iƒá brothers: Stracimir, ƒêuraƒë and Bal≈°a II, were preparing for a campaign against Karlo Thopia. They were camped on the Mati River, of which Karlo's lands lay south of. The fighting was apparently small-scale as two months later, Karlo had no difficulty capturing Dyrrhachium from the Angevins. In order to secure their rule, the Bal≈°iƒá brothers (especially ƒêuraƒë and Bal≈°a II) were already in 1369 ready to convert from Orthodoxy to Catholicism. According to Fine (1994), the brothers converted in order to further their coastal ambitions in 1368 or early 1369. They formally converted in 1369. Hoping to acquire suzerainty over the town, ƒêuraƒë had waged war against Kotor in 1368. Kotor, as a result of warfare, was suffering economic decline. Accepting Zetan rule wasn't going to aid Kotor economically either. Kotor resisted ƒêuraƒë's assault after seeing the town of Bar paying an annual tribute of 2,000 ducats to ƒêuraƒë, previously paying 100 perpers under Serbian Imperial rule, expecting the same fate for Kotor. Kotor sought aid from Nikola Altomanoviƒá, but after his major defeat in Kosovo, he could provide little assistance. Kotor sought aid from the weak Stefan Uro≈° V and Venice. Neither provided much help as Venice was concerned that only their warships were on the Adriatic. In fact, Venice wrote to Uro≈° V in 1368, complaining that Serbia's armed ships were on the Adriatic, citing Bar, Budva nand Ulcinj to have them. They had also stated that this was also a violation of the Venetian-Serbian treaty and threatened to treat the ships as pirate vessels. However, Uro≈° V replied to that letter, stating that those ships that Venice were complaining about belonged to ƒêuraƒë I Bal≈°iƒá, the lord of Zeta. Uro≈° was unhappy with ƒêuraƒë's actions as they were directed against Kotor, which was under Uro≈° V's suzerainty. Concluding that ƒêuraƒë was a rebel, the Serbian court claimed no responsibility for ƒêuraƒë's actions that might violate the Venetian-Serbian treaty. In 1369, ƒêuraƒë laid siege to Kotor, which, having no choice, turned to the Kingdom of Hungary for support and sought for Hungarian suzerainty. Hungary sent a nobleman from Zadar to hold Kotor. This action only increased Kotor's troubles, as it lost its trade privileges with Serbia for a time, causing a larger economic turmoil for Kotor. By spring 1370, probably through Venetian mediation, ƒêuraƒë had made peace with Kotor. However, in the same year, Nikola Altomanoviƒá attacked Kotor. Zeta in time of Stracimir and Djuradj I Balsic (1372-1378). A) The territory of Bal≈°iƒá ; B) Temporary estates In 1371, ƒêuraƒë announced to the Republic of Ragusa that he, Vuka≈°in Mrnjavƒçeviƒá and his son, Marko, along with their armies, were in Scutari, preparing an attack on Nikola Altomanoviƒá. Ragusa assisted their campaign by providing ships to transport men and supplies, since their campaign was in Ragusa's interest. However, the campaign never took place as Vuka≈°in and Marko went to aid Vuka≈°in's brother, Jovan Uglje≈°a, in a campaign against the Turks, which ended up in total disaster, Vuka≈°in and Uglje≈°a and their army being wiped out in the Battle of Maritsa. Serbian Prince Lazar Hrebeljanoviƒá and Bosnian Ban Tvrtko I allied themselves to defeat Nikola Altomanoviƒá. Desperate for a strong ally, Altomanoviƒá began negotiations with ƒêuraƒë. Most historians agree that in concluding negotiations, ƒêuraƒë gained the towns of Trebinje, Konavle and Draƒçevica (Herceg Novi) from Altomanoviƒá, possibly a bribe to remain neutral within the war. Other historians, however, follow Mavro Orbini's account and argue that ƒêuraƒë never concluded such an agreement, rather conquered the towns he gained from the agreement himself after Altomanoviƒá was defeated in 1373. On 30 November 1373 or 1375 the Bal≈°iƒá brothers issued an edict in the Republic of Ragusa that confirmed the laws of Emperor Stefan Uro≈° V and gave privileges to Ragusan traders, including imposed taxes. It also included a unique clause, recognizing the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Serbian Empire despite being without an Emperor for years and any form of strong centralized authority, a note that if anyone would become the new sovereign Emperor of the Serbs and the Serbian nobility and lands (), all the points shall be transferred from the Bal≈°iƒás to him. ƒêuraƒë I's logotet Vitko was the witness, as well as Draga≈° Kosaƒçiƒá.Nemirno doba srpskog srednjeg veka, Vlastela srpskih oblasnih gospodara. Marko ≈†uica, Belgrade, 2000. In 1375, Lazar Hrebeljanoviƒá and ƒêuraƒë convened the state assembly (sabor) during which Jefrem was chosen as Serbian Patriarch. After the Battle of Maritsa, Marko, the son of Vuka≈°in Mrnjavƒçeviƒá, was crowned king and gained his father's lands. However, his friendship with the Bal≈°iƒás soon crumbled. This was a result of ƒêuraƒë, in 1371, expelling his first wife Olivera, Marko's sister, and took Prizren from Marko. Lazar Hrebeljanoviƒá, prince of Moravian Serbia, conquered Pri≈°tina in the same year. ƒêuraƒë took Peƒá a year later, stripping most of Marko's lands north of ≈†ar mountain. ƒêuraƒë I died on 13 January 1378 in Skadar. However, recent studies now conclude that ƒêuraƒë died in 1379 rather than in 1378. The rule of Zeta was passed down to his younger brother, Bal≈°a II. ƒêuraƒë's death caused quite a stir between Zeta's neighbours. Bosnian Ban Tvrtko I annexed ƒêuraƒë's territories bordering Dubrovnik in 1377, along with the remainder of ƒêuraƒë's coastal lands between the Bay of Kotor and the land previously annexed in 1377 at the time of his death. Tvrtko secured these possessions through ƒêuraƒë's death, free of worry of any counter-attack. Vuk Brankoviƒá also took this opportunity to gain ƒêuraƒë's land. Brankoviƒá sent his forces into Metohija and seized Prizren, along with the rest of ƒêuraƒë's holdings in the region.

B√∂rse Berlin AG (or Berlin Stock Exchange) is a stock exchange based in Berlin, Germany, founded in 1685 through an edict of Great Elector Friedrich Wilhelm and is one of the oldest exchanges in Germany.  History  The former building of the Berlin Stock Exchange, designed by Friedrich Hitzig, as it appeared in 1886. Remains of the Berlin Stock Exchange, 1998. The Berlin Stock Exchange was founded on June 29, 1685 in Berlin by Elector Friedrich Wilhelm. The first trading session took place on the 25th of February 1739. First, the upper floor of the former Lusthaus in the Lustgarten next to the Berlin Cathedral in direct proximity to Berliner Stadtschloss was used before this 1798 in favor of new building for the stock exchange at the same place was demolished. The bearer of the stock exchange was from 1803 the United Stock Exchange Corporation, from 1820 the newly founded corporation of merchants. The building in the Burgstra√üe 25-26 on the other side of the Spree was built from 1859 to 1863 by Friedrich Hitzig and opened on 1 October 1863. Because of its location in Burgstrasse, the Berlin Stock Exchange was also called \\"The Burgstrasse\\". The total cost of the construction was 700,000 Taler. Economically, until the beginning of the First World War, the Berlin Stock Exchange was one of the three most important in the world - after London and next to New York. With the general mobilization of Russia on July 30, 1914, the beginning of the First World War, it was initially completely closed. The unrestricted free market was resumed only on 2 November 1917. In 1920, when the corporation of the Kaufmannschaft merged after one hundred years of existence in the Berlin Chamber of Commerce founded in 1902, the sponsorship of the stock exchange passed on to the latter. In 1922, the Stock Index of the Statistical Office was calculated for the first time, based on the average price level of around 300 representative shares of the Berlin Stock Exchange. Wirtschaftsrundfunk, an agency for business news, had an office in the stock market. The Black Friday on 13 May 1927 caused the stock index on the stock exchange to collapse by 31.9 percent. Friday The Black Friday . In: The Time, No. 14/1967. At the end of 1926, 917 public companies were traded on the Stock Exchange, end of 1932 It was 659.

The Second World War in 1943 led to suspension of the price determination by the Statistical Reichsamt. On May 24, 1944, the stock exchange building burned down after a bomb attack, the ruins were demolished in 1957 and 1958. G√∂tz Eckardt (ed.)

Henschelverlag Kunst und Gesellschaft, Berlin 1978, vol. 1, p. 45 For a long time, a few visible parts of the building (pillar parts, fa√ßade decoration) lay behind a construction fence that was still under construction from 2001 onwards.  B√∂rse Berlin after the Second World War  B√∂rse Berlin headquarters in Ludwig-Erhard-Haus designed by Nicholas Grimshaw. After the war, the Berlin Stock Exchange in West Berlin was reopened. However, with all major corporations and banks leaving the city, the stock market never regained the importance it had before the war. In order to address internationalisation and growing consolidation pressure, B√∂rse Berlin has pursued a successful niche strategy since the mid- nineties, with a particular focus on trading the widest possible range of foreign stocks. With the advent of MiFID (Markets in Financial Instruments Directive), the exchange has decided to realign itself completely with its new market segment Equiduct Trading, the exchange will be truly pan-European. Equiduct Trading will allow B√∂rse Berlin to expand its service offering, which until recently was primarily addressing retail investors, by offering custom made solutions for professional market participants. Through the acquisition of a majority stake in EASDAQ NV, the sole owner of Equiduct Systems Ltd and the ETS trading platform, B√∂rse Berlin has gained control of and access to a state-of-the-art electronic trading system. B√∂rse Berlin will remain headquartered in Berlin (operating under the brand \\"Equiduct Trading\\"), but has opened additional offices in London and Paris in order to underline its pan-European ambitions. Professional market participants, that make use of the Equiduct Trading market model, can guarantee to their customers that their orders will receive best execution in accordance with MiFID regulations. London based Equiduct Systems, part of the B√∂rse Berlin Equiduct Trading Group, will provide transaction services for B√∂rse Berlin which will define the legal and regulatory framework of the Equiduct Trading segment. The Equiduct Trading segment is an integral part of the state-monitored and regulated B√∂rse Berlin. In March 2003, Bremer B√∂rse merged with the Berlin Stock Exchange to form the public-sector stock exchange \\"B√∂rse Berlin-Bremen\\". In June 2007, this union was dissolved again. Since then the institution B√∂rse Berlin exists. B√∂rse Berlin today has its headquarters in Ludwig-Erhard-Haus designed by Nicholas Grimshaw at the Fasanenstra√üe 85 in the district Charlottenburg.

A mixed-use development may be new construction, reuse of an existing building or brownfield site, or a combination. Use in North America vs. Europe Traditionally, human settlements have developed in mixed-use patterns. However, with industrialisation as well as the invention of the skyscraper, governmental zoning regulations were introduced to separate different functions, such as manufacturing, from residential areas. In the United States, the heyday of separate-use zoning was after World War II, but since the 1990s, mixed-use zoning has once again become desirable as the benefits are recognized. In most of Europe, government policy has encouraged the continuation of the city center's role as a main location for business, retail, restaurant, and entertainment activity, unlike in the United States where zoning actively discouraged such mixed use for many decades. As a result, much of Europe's central cities are mixed use \\"by default\\" and the term \\"mixed-use\\" is much more relevant regarding new areas of the city, when an effort is made to mix residential and commercial activities ‚Äì such as in Amsterdam's Eastern Docklands ‚Äì rather than separate them. Features=Outdoor Space  Mixed-use development allows the creation of plazas and outdoor corridors between buildings and sidewalks. Street facing facades have a maximum setback to how much space is allocated for pedestrians to gather in. Landscaping another feature in outdoor spaces allow trees and plants to grow on buildings vertically rather than being faced out in a front row. Public Infrastructure Mixed-use in centers that have increased in population density has allowed people to access places through public transit and has helped encourage walking, biking, and cycling to places of work and errands. Transportation has played a role in mitigating climate change by reducing congestion on roads and building up freight movement for goods and services. With street-level design in place in cities like Boston, Seattle, and Denver Mixed-uses allowed the designs of pedestrian walkways, plazas, and eye distances to shops and workplaces. This in turn has reduced parking lots in alleyways and garages. Contexts Expanded use of mixed-use zoning and mixed-use developments may be found in a variety of contexts, such as the following (multiple such contexts might apply to one particular project or situation): * as part of smart growth planning strategies * in traditional urban neighborhoods, as part of urban renewal and/or infill, i.e. upgrading the buildings and public spaces and amenities of the neighborhood to provide more and/or better housing and a better quality of life - examples include Barracks Row in Washington, D.C. and East Liberty, Pittsburgh * in traditional suburbs, adding one or more mixed-use developments to provide a new or more prominent \\"downtown\\" for the community - examples include new projects in downtown Bethesda, Maryland, an inner suburb of Washington, D.C., and the Excelsior & Grand complex in St. Louis Park, Minnesota, an inner suburb of Minneapolis * greenfield developments, i.e. new construction on previously undeveloped land, particularly at the edge of metropolitan areas and in their exurbs, often as part of creating a relatively denser center for the community ‚Äì an edge city, or part of one, zoned for mixed use, in the 2010s often labeled \\"urban villages\\". Examples include Avalon in Alpharetta, Georgia and Halcyon in Forsyth County, Georgia, at the edge of the Atlanta metropolitan area * Repurposing of shopping malls and intensification of development around them, particularly as many shopping malls' retail sales, and ability to rent space to retailers, decrease as part of the 2010s retail apocalypse Any of the above contexts may also include parallel contexts such as: * Transit-oriented development - for example in Los Angeles and San Diego where the cities made across-the-board zoning law changes permitting denser development within a certain distance of certain types of transit stations, with the primary aim of increasing the amount and affordability of housing * Older cities such as Chicago and San Francisco have historic preservation policies that sometimes offer more flexibility for older buildings to be used for purposes other than what they were originally zoned for, with the aim of preserving historic architecture Benefits Plans promoting mixed-use development or zoning claim that it will achieve numerous benefits; for example the Director of Smart Growth for the State of New York claims that mixed-use development aims to achieve:\\"Mixed Use Zoning\\", Livable New York Resource Manual * greater housing variety and density, more affordable housing (smaller units), life- cycle housing (starter homes to larger homes to senior housing) * more walkable neighborhoods * reduced distances between housing, workplaces, retail businesses, and other amenities and destinations * better access to fresh, healthy foods (as food retail and farmers markets can be accessed on foot/bike or by transit) * more compact development, land-use synergy (e.g. residents provide customers for retail which provide amenities for residents) * stronger neighborhood character, \\"sense of place\\", community identity Types of contemporary mixed-use zoning Some of the more frequent mixed-use scenarios in the United States are: * Neighborhood commercial zoning ‚Äì convenience goods and services, such as convenience stores, permitted in otherwise strictly residential areas * Main Street residential/commercial ‚Äì two to three-story buildings with residential units above and commercial units on the ground floor facing the street * Urban residential/commercial ‚Äì multi-story residential buildings with commercial and civic uses on ground floor * Office convenience ‚Äì office buildings with small retail and service uses oriented to the office workers * Office/residential ‚Äì multi-family residential units within office building(s) * Shopping mall conversion ‚Äì residential and/or office units added (adjacent) to an existing standalone shopping mall * Retail district retrofit ‚Äì retrofitting of a suburban retail area to a more village- like appearance and mix of uses * Live/work ‚Äì residents can operate small businesses on the ground floor of the building where they live * Studio/light industrial ‚Äì residents may operate studios or small workshops in the building where they live * Hotel/residence ‚Äì mix hotel space and high-end multi-family residential * Parking structure with ground-floor retail * Single-family detached home district with standalone shopping center Examples of cities' mixed-use planning policies= Canada  Skyline of Toronto, Ontario featuring Condominiums = Toronto = One of the earliest cities to adopt a policy on mixed-use development is Toronto. The local government first played a role in 1986 with a zoning bylaw that allowed for commercial and residential units to be mixed. At the time, Toronto was in the beginning stages planning a focus on developing mixed-use development due to a growing popularity of more social housing . The law has since been updated as recently as 2013, refining much of its focus outside the downtown area which has been amalgamated into the main city since 1998. With the regulations in place, the city has oversaw the development of high-rise condominiums throughout the city with amenities and transit stops nearby. Toronto case of developing Mixed-uses has expand to encompass other North American cities in Canada and The United States to bring in similar changes. One example of a Toronto mixed-use development is Mirvish Village by architect Gregory Henriquez. Located at Bloor and Bathurst Street, a significant intersection in Toronto, portions of the Mirvish Village project site are zoned as \\"commercial residential\\" and others as \\"mixed commercial residential.\\" Within the City of Toronto's zoning by-laws, commercial residential includes \\"a range of commercial, residential and institutional uses, as well as parks.\\" Mirvish Village's programmatic uses include rental apartments, a public market, and small-unit retail, while also preserving 23 of 27 heritage houses on site. The project is notable for its public consultation process, which was lauded by Toronto city officials. Architect Henriquez and the developer had previously collaborated on mixed-use projects in Vancouver, British Columbia, including the successful Woodward's Redevelopment.  United States  Mixed-use spaces developed in Portland, Oregon In the United States, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) collaborates with local governments by providing researchers developing new data that estimates how a city can be impacted by mixed-use development. With the EPA putting models in the spreadsheet, it makes it much easier for municipalities, and developers to estimate the traffic, with Mixed-use spaces. The linking models also used as a resource tool measures the geography, demographics, and land use characteristics in a city. The Environmental Protection Agency has conducted an analysis on six major metropolitan areas using land usage, household surveys, and GIS databases. States such as California, Washington, New Mexico, and Virginia have adopted this standard as statewide policy when assessing how urban developments can impact traffic. Preconditions for the success of mixed-use developments are employment, population, and consumer spending. The three preconditions ensure that a development can attract quality tenants and financial success. Other factors determining the success of the Mixed-use development is the proximity of production time, and the costs from the surrounding market. =Portland= Mixed-use zoning has been implemented in Portland, Oregon since the early 1990s, when the local government wanted to reduce the then-dominant car- oriented development style. Portland's light rail system MAX encourages the mixing of residential, commercial, and work spaces into one zone. With this one-zoning-type planning system, the use of land at increased densities provides a return in public investments throughout the city. Main street corridors provide flexible building heights and high density uses to enable \\"gathering places\\".

Although uncommon in the general population, ischemic colitis occurs with greater frequency in the elderly, and is the most common form of bowel ischemia. http://www.guideline.gov/summary/summary.aspx?ss=15&doc;_id=3069&nbr;=2295 Causes of the reduced blood flow can include changes in the systemic circulation (e.g. low blood pressure) or local factors such as constriction of blood vessels or a blood clot. In most cases, no specific cause can be identified. Ischemic colitis is usually suspected on the basis of the clinical setting, physical examination, and laboratory test results; the diagnosis can be confirmed by endoscopy or by using sigmoid or endoscopic placement of a visible light spectroscopic catheter (see Diagnosis). Ischemic colitis can span a wide spectrum of severity; most patients are treated supportively and recover fully, while a minority with very severe ischemia may develop sepsis and become critically, sometimes fatally, ill. Patients with mild to moderate ischemic colitis are usually treated with IV fluids, analgesia, and bowel rest (that is, no food or water by mouth) until the symptoms resolve. Those with severe ischemia who develop complications such as sepsis, intestinal gangrene, or bowel perforation may require more aggressive interventions such as surgery and intensive care. Most patients make a full recovery; occasionally, after severe ischemia, patients may develop long-term complications such as a stricture or chronic colitis. Signs and symptoms Three progressive phases of ischemic colitis have been described: *A hyperactive phase occurs first, in which the primary symptoms are severe abdominal pain and the passage of bloody stools. Many patients get better and do not progress beyond this phase. *A paralytic phase can follow if ischemia continues; in this phase, the abdominal pain becomes more widespread, the belly becomes more tender to the touch, and bowel motility decreases, resulting in abdominal bloating, no further bloody stools, and absent bowel sounds on exam. *Finally, a shock phase can develop as fluids start to leak through the damaged colon lining. This can result in shock and metabolic acidosis with dehydration, low blood pressure, rapid heart rate, and confusion. Patients who progress to this phase are often critically ill and require intensive care. Symptoms of ischemic colitis vary depending on the severity of the ischemia. The most common early signs of ischemic colitis include abdominal pain (often left-sided), with mild to moderate amounts of rectal bleeding. The sensitivity of findings among 73 patients were: * abdominal pain (78%) * lower digestive bleeding (62%) * diarrhea (38%) * Fever higher than (34%) Physical examination * abdominal pain (77%) * abdominal tenderness (21%) Causes Ischemic colitis is often classified according to the underlying cause. Non-occlusive ischemia develops because of low blood pressure or constriction of the vessels feeding the colon; occlusive ischemia indicates that a blood clot or other blockage has cut off blood flow to the colon. Non-occlusive ischemia In hemodynamically unstable patients (i.e. shock) the mesenteric perfusion may be compromised. This condition is commonly asymptomatic, and usually only apparent through a systemic inflammatory response. Occlusive ischemia Mostly the result of a thromboembolism. Commonly the embolism is caused by atrial fibrillation, valvular disease, myocardial infarction, or cardiomyopathy. In addition, ischemic colitis is a well-recognized complication of abdominal aortic aneurysm repair, when the origin of the inferior mesenteric artery is covered by the aortic graft. In a 1991 review concerning 2137 patients the accidental inferior mesenteric artery ligation was the most common cause (74%) of ischemic colitis. Thus, patients without adequate collateralization are at risk for ischemia of the descending and sigmoid colon. Bloody diarrhea and leukocytosis in the postoperative period are essentially diagnostic of ischemic colitis. The complication can be prevented through careful selection of subjects that may require replanting inferior mesenteric artery (IMA) and completing the pre surgical procedure information with an instrumental evaluation during surgical treatment. Pathophysiology Ischemic colitis, transverse colon, 82 y. o. female Colonic blood supply Colonic blood supply. Pink - supply from thumb The colon receives blood from both the superior and inferior mesenteric arteries. The blood supply from these two major arteries overlap, with abundant collateral circulation via the marginal artery of the colon. However, there are weak points, or \\"watershed\\" areas, at the borders of the territory supplied by each of these arteries, such as the splenic flexure and the rectosigmoid junction. These watershed areas are most vulnerable to ischemia when blood flow decreases, as they have the fewest vascular collaterals. The rectum receives blood from both the inferior mesenteric artery and the internal iliac artery; the rectum is rarely involved by colonic ischemia due to this dual blood supply. Development of ischemia Under ordinary conditions, the colon receives between 10% and 35% of the total cardiac output.UpToDate, Colonic ischemia, accessed 2 September 2006. If blood flow to the colon drops by more than about 50%, ischemia will develop. The arteries feeding the colon are very sensitive to vasoconstrictors; presumably this is an evolutionary adaptation to shunt blood away from the bowel and to the heart and brain in times of stress. As a result, during periods of low blood pressure, the arteries feeding the colon clamp down vigorously; a similar process can result from vasoconstricting drugs such as ergotamine, cocaine, or vasopressors. This vasoconstriction can result in non-occlusive ischemic colitis. Pathologic findings A range of pathologic findings are seen in ischemic colitis, corresponding to the spectrum of clinical severity. In its mildest form, mucosal and submucosal hemorrhage and edema are seen, possibly with mild necrosis or ulceration. With more severe ischemia, a pathologic picture resembling inflammatory bowel disease (i.e. chronic ulcerations, crypt abscesses and pseudopolyps) may be seen. In the most severe cases, transmural infarction with resulting perforation may be seen; after recovery, the muscularis propria may be replaced by fibrous tissue, resulting in a stricture. Following restoration of normal blood flow, reperfusion injury may also contribute to the damage to the colon. Diagnosis Ischemic colitis must be differentiated from the many other causes of abdominal pain and rectal bleeding (for example, infection, inflammatory bowel disease, diverticulosis, or colon cancer). It is also important to differentiate ischemic colitis, which often resolves on its own, from the more immediately life-threatening condition of acute mesenteric ischemia of the small bowel. There are devices which test the sufficiency of oxygen delivery to the colon. The first device approved by the U.S. FDA in 2004 uses visible light spectroscopy to analyze capillary oxygen levels. Use during Aortic Aneurysm repair detected when colon oxygen levels fell below sustainable levels, allowing real-time repair. In several studies, Specificity has been 90% or higher for acute colonic ischemia, and 83% for chronic mesenteric ischemia, with a sensitivity of 71%-92%. This device must be placed using endoscopy, however. Diagnostic tests There is a recent optical test, but it requires endoscopy (see Diagnosis). There are no specific blood tests for ischemic colitis. The sensitivity of tests among 73 patients were: * The white blood cell count was more than 15,000/mm3 in 20 patients (27%) * The serum bicarbonate level was less than 24 mmol/L in 26 patients (36%) Plain X-rays are often normal or show non-specific findings. In a series of 73 patients, plain abdominal radiography (56%) showing colic distension in 53% or a pneumoperitoneum in 3%. CT scans are often used in the evaluation of abdominal pain and rectal bleeding, and may suggest the diagnosis of ischemic colitis, pick up complications, or suggest an alternate diagnosis. Endoscopic evaluation, via colonoscopy or flexible sigmoidoscopy, is the procedure of choice if the diagnosis remains unclear. Ischemic colitis has a distinctive endoscopic appearance; endoscopy can also facilitate alternate diagnoses such as infection or inflammatory bowel disease. Biopsies can be taken via endoscopy to provide more information. Visible light spectroscopy, performed using catheters placed through the 5 mm channel of the endoscope, is diagnostic (see Diagnosis). Treatment Except in the most severe cases, ischemic colitis is treated with supportive care. IV fluids are given to treat dehydration, and the patient is placed on bowel rest (meaning nothing to eat or drink) until the symptoms resolve. If possible, cardiac function and oxygenation should be optimized to improve oxygen delivery to the ischemic bowel. A nasogastric tube may be inserted if an ileus is present. Antibiotics are sometimes given in moderate to severe cases; the data supporting this practice date to the 1950s, although there is more recent animal data suggesting that antibiotics may increase survival and prevent bacteria from crossing the damaged lining of the colon into the bloodstream. The use of prophylactic antibiotics in ischemic colitis has not been prospectively evaluated in humans, but many authorities recommend their use based on the animal data. Patients being treated supportively are carefully monitored. If they develop worsening symptoms and signs such as high white blood cell count, fever, worsened abdominal pain, or increased bleeding, then they may require surgical intervention; this usually consists of laparotomy and bowel resection. Prognosis Most patients with ischemic colitis recover fully, although the prognosis depends on the severity of the ischemia. Patients with pre-existing peripheral vascular disease or ischemia of the ascending (right) colon may be at increased risk for complications or death. Non-gangrenous ischemic colitis, which comprises the vast majority of cases, is associated with a mortality rate of approximately 6%. However, the minority of patients who develop gangrene as a result of colonic ischemia have a mortality rate of 50‚Äì75% with surgical treatment; the mortality rate is almost 100% without surgical intervention. Long-term complications About 20% of patients with acute ischemic colitis may develop a long-term complication known as chronic ischemic colitis. Symptoms can include recurrent infections, bloody diarrhea, weight loss, and chronic abdominal pain. Chronic ischemic colitis is often treated with surgical removal of the chronically diseased portion of the bowel. A colonic stricture is a band of scar tissue which forms as a result of the ischemic injury and narrows the lumen of the colon. Strictures are often treated observantly; they may heal spontaneously over 12‚Äì24 months. If a bowel obstruction develops as a result of the stricture, surgical resection is the usual treatment, although endoscopic dilatation and stenting have also been employed. Epidemiology The exact incidence of ischemic colitis is difficult to estimate, as many patients with mild ischemia may not seek medical attention. Ischemic colitis is responsible for about 1 in 2000 hospital admissions, and is seen on about 1 in 100 endoscopies.Feldman: Sleisenger & Fordtran's Gastrointestinal and Liver Disease, 7th ed., 2002 Saunders, p. 2332. Men and women are affected equally; ischemic colitis is a disease of the elderly, with more than 90% of cases occurring in people over the age of 60.

He was subsequently elected Mayor of the Greater Hume Shire in 2005, but died suddenly the next month. Early career Glachan attended Sydney Boys High School, graduating in 1947. He worked as a marine engineer, farmer, and businessman, as well as serving in the Royal Australian Air Force and as an officer in the Australian Merchant Navy. Political career In 1984 he stood as the Liberal candidate for Albury, but was defeated by sitting member Harold Mair of the Labor Party. Glachan stood again in the 1988 election and won handily amid Labor's collapse in the more rural portions of the state that year. He actually won enough of a swing to turn Albury into a safe Liberal seat in one stroke, largely due to the Nationals' preferences flowing overwhelmingly to him. Glachan became chairman of the Parliament's Public Accounts Committee, and served as member for Albury until 2003 when he was succeeded by Greg Aplin. In March 2005 he was elected to the newly created Greater Hume Shire Council, and became its first mayor at the inaugural meeting on 16 March 2005. Other work Ian Glachan was actively involved in the restoration of his local church building the Anglican Church at Jindera. He was the founding secretary of a committee that established the Trinity Anglican College and a wing at the Thurgoona campus was named after him. Glachan was presented with Rotary International's Paul Harris Fellowship, given to members who donate $1000 US. He served as a Justice of the Peace and as chairman of the Albury's Mercy Hospital building appeal.

The chipset supports AMD64 processors for Socket 939 and Socket AM2. History of the Xpress 3200 chipset The Radeon Xpress chipset was designed by ATI to enter the realm of the desktop arena, especially the AMD Socket 939 platform where ATI's rival, Nvidia, had a clear market advantage. The Xpress 200 was launched with the Crossfire edition of the chipset considered as the high end of the chipset. However, rolling delays with the Crossfire Master Cards forced ATI to launch the Socket 939 platform whilst the Intel platform was scrapped due to time constraints. Reviews painted the Xpress 200 Crossfire as a board that could match Nvidia's nForce 4 SLI. With the release of the nForce 4 16x SLI, ATI changed strategy and announced the RD580 chipset. The RD580 was no different with the Xpress 200 chipset with the exception of the 40 PCI Express lanes within the Northbridge. It was claimed by ATI that having 2 chipsets with 20 PCI Express lanes would slow down data transfers when the chipset is working with multi-GPU configurations. Having just all the PCI Express lanes within the Northbridge claimed to be more efficient and less bottlenecking as compared to the nForce 4 16x SLI. The RD580 was called the Radeon Xpress 3200 and was released on March 1, 2006. Supposedly, the chipset is also configured for the new Socket AM2 and of such, many motherboard manufacturers have decided to skip the Socket 939 RD580 and began R&D; on the Socket AM2 RD580. [ASUS M2R32-MVP] With the launch of the Socket AM2, ATI also announced the release of their SB600 southbridge which was to be compatible with the RD580 northbridge. Originally, the SB450/SB460 was highly flawed in the USB design and lacking in cutting edge features as compared to Nvidia's counterpart, which resulted in low sales. The ULi 1575 Southbridge was the other preferred Southbridge until Nvidia took over ULI. As a result, high expectations was placed on ATI to design a Southbridge that was on-par or greater than the ULI 1575. As reference boards for Socket AM2 trickled out, many sites commented that ATI now had an even footing against Nvidia with great improvement in the SB600. Currently, it is rumoured that the final Intel based chipset (the \\"RD600\\") is a variant of the RD580 but contains the memory controller in the Northbridge and support for 3 PCI Express x16 slots. As of the final acquisition of ATI, AMD has current moved to rename all ATI chipsets for the AMD platform. The Xpress 3200 Crossfire chipsets for AMD platform (Socket AM2) have been renamed as the AMD 580X Crossfire chipset. Common features * Support for up to 40 PCI Express lanes within Northbridge. 32 PCI Express lanes dedicated for two 16x PCI Express slots. 4 PCI Express lanes for interconnection with Northbridge and Southbridge (A-Link II). Other PCI Express lanes configured to manufacturer. * Compatible with either ATI's SB450/SB460/SB600 or ULI's M1573/M1575 Southbridge. * Support for up to 8 USB 2.0 ports. * Support for 4 SATA and 4 PATA drives. The SATA can be formed a RAID 0, 1 or 0+1 if used with the SB450/SB460 Southbridge. Support for 4 SATA and 4 PATA drives and the SATA can be formed into a RAID of 0, 1, 1+0, 5 or JBOD (Just a Bunch of Disks) if used with the ULI M1575 Southbridge. Support for 4 SATA and 2 PATA drives if used with the SB600. RAID support in the SB600 is still a standard 0, 1 or 1+0. * AC97 High Definition audio with either Realtek ALC882/ALC882D/ALC888/ALC883, SoundBlaster Live! 24-bit or Analog Devices AD1986A. * Support for up to 7 PCI slots. * Support for multi-GPU configuration known as CrossFire.

Availability The RD600 has undergone delays over the months, it was originally expected to be released in Q2'06. As ATI was officially merged with AMD on the October 25, 2006, it is being more unclear that ATI will offer more chipsets supporting Intel CPUs. Since RD600 was delayed, it was reported that some of the motherboard manufacturer have dropped plans to produce motherboards using RD600 chipset. However, the first motherboard using the chipset will be produced by DFI and the first retail product was scheduled for release December 2006,The Inquirer report about RD600 named as \\"DFI LanParty UT ICFX3200 - TR2/G\\". there are now actual products of \\"DFI LanParty UT ICFX3200 - TR2/G\\" on sale in some places such as Hong Kong and Singapore. As the NDA rapidly approached, some popular overclocking sites such as XtremeSystems and VR-Zone started posting teasers for the soon to be released \\"DFI LanParty UT ICFX3200 - TR2/G\\". However, a big surprise was the revelation that the RD600 was based on a version of the RD480 or the Xpress 1600 chipset. One popular reason for this was that the RD480 was also designed for an Intel platform but constant delays and revision issues caused the Intel RD480 to become the RD600.Tony's answer to only one 16x PCI-E lanes in chipset Recent report says Asus has finished a chipset design for RD600.The Inquirer report =Official features= * 2 or 3 physical PCI Express slots * 20 PCI-Express lanes configured with 2 PCI-E lanes dedicated for Northbridge and Southbridge connection, 16x PCI-E lane for dedicated graphics (2 8x PCI-E lanes when in Crossfire mode) and a 2x lane for Crossfire physics. The revised Northbridge - Southbridge link from the RD580 is used and a revised PCI-E controller built into the Northbridge. * Support for up to 6 SATA hard disks Trivia * The RD580 was codenamed \\"Manta\\". The reason was because of the use of aquarium fishes for codenames within ATI. * Engineering samples were completed just after the launch of Nvidia's nForce 4 16x SLI. * The RD580 was supposedly launched on the same day the Radeon X1900 but it was delayed to coincide with the launch of the socket AM2. However, with the slippage in the Socket AM2 to June 6, 2006, ATI decided to launch on March 1, 2006. * The package of the RD580 is no bigger than a US 50 cents and has a thermal dissipation rating of 7 watt. * The world record for highest 3DMark2005 score using Crossfire was achieved on this chipset during the launch. * Asus was rumoured selling the chipset before the launch of the Xpress 3200 in Seville.

He was previous a member of the New South Wales Legislative Assembly from 1917 to 1920. Early life Manning was born in Wagga Wagga, New South Wales, to pastoralists Frederick and Jane Belle Manning. He was educated in public schools in Wagga and Yass before purchasing grazing land in Narrabri and West Wyalong; he married Florence Hogarth in 1899, a union which produced no children. He became a vocal proponent for the rights of farmers, serving as president of the Australian Meat Council and on the boards of the Farmers and Settlers' Association and the Graziers' Association. Member of parliament At the 1917 state election, Manning won the seat of Albury for the Nationalist Party. Defeated at the 1920 state election, Manning remained involved in the Nationalist Party and rural affairs and was chosen as the Nationalist candidate for the Division of Macquarie at the 1922 federal election. Manning was victorious, narrowly defeating sitting Labor representative Samuel Nicholls by less than 100 votes after preferences from an independent were distributed. Manning faced controversy during his first term in federal parliament when it was revealed in 1924 that he and fellow parliamentarian farmer William Killen had signed cheques on behalf of the government to the Australian meat industry (in which they both had interests). This was considered by some to be in breach of section 44(v) of the Australian constitution, whereby members of parliament were banned from deriving a benefit from government actions. Following a lively parliamentary debate, a motion that Manning and Killen were in breach of section 44(v) was defeated. Despite the controversy, Manning retained his seat at the 1925 election, defeating Labor candidate and future prime minister Ben Chifley. In 1926, Manning was a member of the Australian delegation to the League of Nations General Assembly, discussing, amongst other issues, Australia's administration of the former German New Guinea. Manning was opposed by Chifley again in 1928, and narrowly lost following a Labor campaign that painted Manning a friend of Asian immigrants. Chifley argued that he would help keep Australia white and while Manning used his campaign speeches to deny that he was in favour of Asian immigration, the electorate was in no mood for someone they considered soft on immigration. Later life Out of parliament, Manning remained on the executive of the Nationalist Party and stood as the official Nationalist Party candidate for the suburban Sydney federal Division of Wentworth at the 1929 election, following the expulsion of the sitting member Walter Marks from the party. Manning lost and returned to his life as a gentleman grazier while remaining involved in farming and political issues, including a stint as a United Australia Party (the successor to the Nationalist Party) councillor from 1933 to 1935. He died in Sydney.

The main campus of USFQ is located in Cumbay√°, outside of Quito (capital city of Ecuador), where students use a library, education and research laboratories, classrooms, and seven restaurants. USFQ is the only university in the world that owns a campus in the Galapagos Islands, and a campus in the Yasuni Biosphere Reserve (Tiputini Biodiversity Station), one of Earth's most biodiverse areas. History Universidad San Francisco de Quito USFQ was founded in 1988 by the Corporaci√≥n de Promoci√≥n Universitaria, its umbrella non-profit foundation. It was the first totally private self-financed university in Ecuador. It was named after the city of Quito: San Francisco de Quito, in response to the need of a private higher-education institution in Ecuador. It was recognized by the Ministry of Education and Culture of Ecuador in October 1995 and accredited by CONESUP in May 2001.. conesup.net. Establishment of the Corporaci√≥n de Promoci√≥n Universitaria In 1980, a group of Ecuadorian and international intellectuals and businesspeople, under the leadership of Santiago Gangotena Gonz√°lez, established the non-profit Corporaci√≥n de Promoci√≥n Universitaria, with the mission to create a private Ecuadorian university. The corporation was legalized by the Ministry of Education and Culture of Ecuador in June 1985 (published in the Official Registry of the Ecuadorian Government in 28 de June 1985). Foundation of the University After eight years of planning and promotion, the first class of USFQ students started on September 1, 1988, in a manor located on the 12 de Octubre Ave. 1983 and Salazar St.,in the northern area of Quito, with 130 students. The university was recognized by the Ecuadorian government on October 18, 1995, under Executive Decree 3166, published in the Official Registry 809 on October 25, 1995. The statutes of the university were approved by the National Council of High Education CONESUP on May 18, 2001. Creation of the colleges USFQ is divided among academic colleges (faculties). In 1988, students were distributed among three academic colleges: Colegio de Administraci√≥n para el Desarrollo for business studies, Colegio de Ciencias Aplicadas for applied sciences, and Colegio de Comunicaci√≥n y Cultura for communication, arts and cultural studies. In 1990, USFQ started the Colegio de Ciencias Ambientales for environmental sciences. In 1992, six colleges were established: Colegio de Administraci√≥n para el Desarrollo, Colegio de Comunicaci√≥n y Artes, Colegio de Ciencias Ambientales, Colegio de Ciencias Aplicadas, Colegio de Ciencias Sociales y Humanidades, y Colegio de Lenguas. Subsequently, in 1993, the Colegio de Arquitectura started, followed in 1994 by the Colegio de Agricultura and the Colegio de Ciencias de la Salud. In 1997, the Colegio de Ciencias Sociales y Humanidades changed its name to Colegio de Artes Liberales. Colleges of the university By 2017, USFQ is divided in 15 academic colleges and institutes spread across three campuses across Ecuador (Cumbay√°-Quito, Tiputini Biodiversity Station, and the Gal√°pagos Islands): * Colegio de Administraci√≥n y Econom√≠a (CADE) - College of Business Administration and Economics * Colegio de Arquitectura y Dise√±o Interior (CADI) - College of Architecture and Interior Design * Colegio de Ciencias Sociales y Humanidades (COCISOH) - College of Social Sciences and Humanities * Colegio de Ciencias Biol√≥gicas y Ambientales (COCIBA) - College of Biological and Environmental Sciences * Colegio de Ciencias de la Salud (COCSA) - College of Health Science * Colegio de Ciencias e Ingenier√≠a (Polit√©cnico) - College of Sciences and Engineering - The Polytechnic * Colegio de Comunicaci√≥n y Artes Contempor√°neas (COCOA) - College of Communication and Contemporary Arts * Colegio de Hospitalidad, Arte Culinario y Turismo (CHAT) - College of Hospitality, Culinary Arts, and Tourism * Colegio de Jurisprudencia (JUR)- College of Jurisprudence * Colegio de Musica (CoM) - College of Music * Academia Regional de Redes CISCO-USFQ - Regional CISCO-USFQ Academy * GAIAS - Galapagos Academic Institute for the Arts and Sciences * Instituto Confucio - Confucius Institute * Instituto de Ense√±anza y Aprendizaje (IDEA) - Institute of Teaching and Learning * Instituto de Lenguas Extranjeras (ILE) - Institute of Foreign Languages Contributions to the advancement of science and society * D√ò experiment, by Bruce Hoeneisen, founder and professor of the Physics department at the Colegio de Ciencias e Ingenier√≠a El Polit√©cnico, USFQ. * Hosting the First and Second World Summit on Evolution (called \\"The Woodstock of Evolution\\"Shermer, Michael. 27 June 2005.

Born in Lyndoch, South Australia to George Septimus Robinson, publican and grazier, and his wife Lucy,Drinkwater, D. (2000) \\"Robinson, Albert William (1877‚Äì1943)\\" The Biographical Dictionary of the Australian Senate, Vol. 1 1901‚Äì1929, Melbourne University Press, Melbourne. Robinson was educated in Clare and Roseworthy Agricultural College, where he studied viticulture, before commencing work as a pastoralist on his father's property \\"Werocata\\" near Balaklava. Robinson married Edith Laine in 1904; the marriage produced three daughters and three sons. His stature in the area led to his election as President of the Balaklava-Dalkey Agricultural Society, Chairman of the Balaklava Racing Club and vice-president of the Farmers and Producers Political Union. Robinson used this local prominence to good effect by gaining Liberal Union pre-selection for the South Australian House of Assembly Electoral district of Wooroora at the 1915 election. During his time in parliament, Robinson chaired the influential Government Railways Standing Committee and through this influence in combination with the wealth he had gained from farming, Robinson was considered a possible future Premier of South Australia. He surprisingly lost his seat as a Liberal Federation candidate at the 1924 election, when the Labor Party swept to power. Robinson remained involved in Liberal politics and was appointed by the South Australian parliament in April 1928 to the senate position vacated by Sir Henry Barwell upon the latter's resignation to become South Australian Agent- General in London. Robinson sat with the Nationalist Party of Australia (the federal equivalent of the South Australian-based Liberal Federation) in the Senate for eight months before his defeat at the 1928 federal election. He was a strong supporter of regional development (he had been heavily involved in the development of Kangaroo Island in the late 1930s), an increase in the birth rate and thrift. Angry with his perceived poor treatment by the Liberal Federation, Robinson resigned from the party and again ran for Wooroora but as an independent candidate at a by-election in 1934. Although he could not find a scrutineer in some towns and had no one attend a campaign meeting in another town, Robinson surprisingly won the by-election and, following an electoral redistribution, was comfortably elected as the member for the state seat of Gouger at the 1938 election. He was one of 14 of 39 lower house MPs at the 1938 election to be elected as an independent, which as a grouping won 40 percent of the primary vote, more than either of the major parties. Tom Stott was the de facto leader of the independent caucus within parliament.Jennings, R. (1992) Barnacles and Parasites, Nesfield Press, Adelaide. . Following re- election at the 1941 election, Robinson died in office in 1943, survived by his widow, three daughters and one son. A son, George Albert, committed suicide in 1937 after shooting two of his infant children.

The screenplay is based on the July 5, 1952 Collier's short story \\"The Gift of Cochise\\" by Louis L'Amour. The book Hondo was a novelization of the film also written by L'Amour, and published by Gold Medal Books in 1953. The supporting cast features Ward Bond, James Arness and Leo Gordon. The shoot went over schedule, and Farrow had to leave the production as he was contractually obligated to direct another movie. The final scenes featuring the Apache attack on the circled wagons of the Army and settlers were shot by John Ford, whom Wayne had asked to finish the film; Ford was uncredited for this work.http://www.tcm.com/this- month/article/158612%7C21316/Hondo.html Plot summary In 1870, at a remote ranch in Arizona, homesteader Angie Lowe (Geraldine Page) and her six-year-old son Johnny (Lee Aaker) are performing chores at their ranch when a stranger (John Wayne) arrives on foot, carrying only his saddle bags and a rifle. The man tells them that his name is Lane, and that he was riding dispatch for the US Army Cavalry. He had lost his horse in an encounter with some Indians. Angie tells Lane her ranch hand had quit before he had a chance to break her two horses for riding, so Lane offers to break a horse himself. Lane deduces from the neglected ranch that her husband has been away for some time, a fact she confesses is true. When night falls Angie offers to let Lane sleep in her home. Hondo, meanwhile, reveals that he is part Indian and was married five years to a Mescalero woman.Many viewers have missed the fact that Wayne plays a Native American in this movie. Hondo mentions his Indian heritage about 15 minutes into the story. In Louis L'Amour's short story \\"The Gift of Cochise\\", Ches Lane (the Hondo character) was also Indian. Angie sees his rifle is inscribed \\"Hondo\\" Lane, who she knows had killed three men the year before. She attempts to shoot him, but due to the chamber being empty, Hondo is not hurt. He loads the chamber and tells her to keep it that way. Hondo tells Angie she reminds him of a woman from his past, and kisses her before he leaves. At the ranch, Angie and Johnny are beset by Apaches, led by Chief Vittoro (Michael Pate) and his main under-chief, Silva (Rodolfo Acosta). Angie is not nervous in their presence as they have never attacked her family before. This time, they begin manhandling Angie. Johnny emerges from the house with the pistol and shoots at Silva. As Silva recovers and approaches him, he throws the pistol at Silva. Vittoro is impressed by Johnny's bravery and makes him an Apache blood brother. Vittoro wonders where Angie's husband is and tells her that unless he returns soon, she must take an Apache husband as the boy needs a father. Hondo returns to his Cavalry post, where he meets up with his friend Buffalo Baker (Ward Bond). He reports to his commanding officer that C troop, which was sent to gather and bring in settlers to the north, was killed by Apaches. It is clear to the Major (Paul Fix) that the Apaches are raiding and killing settlers. In a saloon, Hondo gets into a fight with a stranger, and beats him severely. Baker tells Hondo the man called himself \\"Ed Lowe\\" (Leo Gordon), and Hondo suspects he is Angie's husband. Meanwhile, Vittoro shows Angie some prospective husbands from among his men. She insists she is still married, and he gives her a deadline: if her husband does not return by the time of the planting rain, she must take an Apache husband. Feeling guilty, Hondo leaves to return Angie's horse. Lowe and a guide (Frank McGrath) follow Hondo, who camps near a river but leaves when he detects two Indians stalking him. Lowe enters the camp and he and his guide are attacked by the two Indians. The guide is killed, but Hondo shoots the Apache about to kill Lowe. Lowe is briefly grateful but as he lies on the ground and is preparing to shoot Hondo in the back in retaliation for the beating, the more experienced Hondo spins around and quickly shoots him to save his own life. Hondo finds a tin type of Johnny on Lowe's body, confirming his identity. Hondo runs into an Apache party, and is captured. They are torturing him to get information about the Cavalry when Vittoro appears. An Indian shows Vittoro the picture of Johnny, and Vittoro assumes Hondo is Angie's husband. Silva declares the blood rite as Hondo had killed his brother. In a one on one knife fight setup to settle the feud, Silva stabs Hondo in the shoulder, but Hondo pins Silva to the ground, and gives him the option to take back the blood rite or die. Silva gives in. Vittoro takes Hondo to Angie's ranch, and when Vittoro asks if Hondo is her husband, she lies, saving Hondo. The Chief warns Hondo to raise Johnny in the Apache way and leaves. Before the Apache party leaves, Silva ultimately gets his revenge against Hondo by killing his dog, Sam, and leaving the body in front of the porch as a message to Hondo that their feud is not over. Hondo and Angie grow close as he recuperates. Hondo attempts to reveal the truth of her husband's death, but is interrupted by Vittoro's return. The chief tells them that the pony soldiers will soon return. He asks Hondo not to join them and to keep the Indians' location a secret by telling a lie. Hondo promises to do the former but not the latter, and Vittoro shows respect for Hondo's truthfulness. Angie tells Hondo she loves him. The Army arrives at the ranch, commanded by ambitious but inexperienced Lt. McKay (Tom Irish) and accompanied by scouts Baker and Lennie (James Arness). McKay is determined to protect the settlers in the area by relocating them to the Army post and defend the area against Apache attacks. Lennie reveals he discovered Lowe's body and matched the horse tracks to Hondo's horse. He wants Hondo's Winchester rifle in exchange for keeping quiet about how Hondo apparently bushwhacked Lowe. Angie overhears Lennie's demands. Hondo prepares to leave, but before he goes, he tells Angie the truth about her husband's death. Hondo also wants to tell Johnny, but she persuades him not to, telling Hondo she didn't love her husband any longer. She says it would be unkind to tell the boy the truth of his father's death and that the secret won't follow them to Hondo's ranch in California. Hondo responds to her emotional plea with an Indian word that seals a squaw-seeking ceremony, \\"Varlabania\\", which he tells her means \\"forever\\". The Army leaves to move further on into Apache territory. As promised, Hondo refuses to go with them, but tells Buffalo that McKay is leading them into a massacre. Buffalo knows, but he also knows that scouts such as he have been helping to train young West Point officers for many years. The Army returns causing the Apaches to retreat. Realizing the danger they are in Hondo, Angie and Johnny join the Cavalry and head to the fort. The column is attacked by the Apaches, and form a wagon circle that barely holds together. Amidst a chaotic counterattack to save some stragglers, Hondo loses his mount and is attacked by Silva, but amidst the dust Hondo kills him. The Indians then retreat. Lt. McKay says that General Crook will be arriving in the territory with a large force. \\"Buffalo\\" Baker says it will be the end of the Apache. Hondo proclaims \\"Yeah. End of a way of life. Too bad, it's a good way.\\" The movie ends with the idea that once back to the fort, Hondo, Angie and Johnny will continue on to Hondo's ranch in California as a family. CastFilming locations * San Francisco de Conchos. The exterior of the Church of San Francisco de As√≠s in the village was used for the army camp scenes. Development and production Wayne's newly formed production company Batjac purchased the rights to Louis L'Amour's short story \\"The Gift of Cochise\\" in 1952, and set Wayne's friend and frequent collaborator James Edward Grant to write the adaptation, which expanded the original story, introduced new characters, and added the cavalry subplot. L'Amour was given the rights to write the novelization of the film, which became a bestseller after the film's release. The film shoot was scheduled for the summer of 1953 in the Mexican desert state of Chihuahua in the San Francisco de Conchos region. Today, this region is known for its tourist attractions like Lago Colina and spring pools like Los Filtros. It is a green area region with plenty of fishing and agriculture growth. Wayne and his producing partner Robert Fellows wanted to shoot the film in the trend-setting 3D format. Warner Brothers supplied the production with the newly developed \\"All Media Camera,\\" which could shoot in any format, including 3-D, using twin lenses placed slightly apart to produce the stereoscopic effect necessary for it. Despite the fact that they were smaller than the twin camera process used previously for 3D, the All-Media Cameras were still bulky and made the film shoot difficult, causing delays when transporting the cameras to remote desert locations. Further, the director John Farrow and director of photography Robert Burks were unfamiliar with the new technology and had trouble adjusting to using it, while the cameras were frequently broken due to wind blowing sand into the mechanism or from other inclement weather conditions. Farrow used the technology to produce fewer gimmicks than other 3D films did at the time, with only a few scenes showing people or objects coming at the camera, such as gunfire or knives. Instead he preferred to use it to increase the depth of the expansive wide shots of the Mexican desert, or when showing figures against a landscape. The casting of Geraldine Page as the female lead was considered quite puzzling to many in Hollywood at the time. Though Hondo was not her first film, she had been known primarily as a Broadway stage actress and employed the Method acting style deemed too introspective for film, and especially for Westerns. However, she delivered what many consider a nuanced performance completely appropriate to her character which later garnered her an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actress, the first of only two acting nominations ever for a film shot or presented in 3D. (The award went to Donna Reed for From Here to Eternity.) John Ford shot the final scenes of the wagon train attack as a favor for Wayne when Farrow had to leave the film before its completion due to a conflicting contractual obligation to begin another film. Ford accepted no credit for directing the last sequence of the film. John Wayne later said John Farrow \\"didn't really have a great deal to do with\\" the film. \\"Everything was set up before he came on it... It was written and I went out and looked for locations and picked the locations where each scene would be shot. I went back and brought the cameraman, and they said there's no color here. I said wait until I show you, and within seventeen miles of town I had white molten rock, blue pools of water, black buttes, big chalk-white buttes. We were using 3-D. We made it in 3-D but then it was never released in that, because Warner Brothers decided to give up and use the Fox system.\\" Theatrical release Even with the production troubles that came with the location shooting in 3D, the studio felt it was a worthwhile venture since 3D pictures were at the height of popularity at the time of the film's development. However, by the time the film was completed, public interest in 3D had started to wane. The distributing studio Warner Brothers did everything it could to promote its new 3D camera process and how it went beyond the typical gimmicks used by other popular 3D films at the time such as House of Wax, producing a richer sense of perspective. Hondo was released on November 27, 1953, and was presented in the 3D format in most first-run theaters. However, by 1954, there were a greater number of smaller theaters that were unable to show the film in the stereoscopic format because the Polaroid 3D projection system required a brighter and more light-reflective screen, referred to as a \\"silver screen,\\" which was an added cost these theater owners were reluctant to pay. The film has an intermission, which comes right after Hondo is captured by the Apaches. This is included on the DVD version. The film ended up becoming quite popular with audiences, eventually grossing $4.1 million at the box office and placing it in the top 20 money-makers for that year. Restoration and DVD release An initial restoration of Hondo was overseen by Wayne's son Michael, head of Batjac Productions, in the late 1980s culminating in a syndicated broadcast of the film in June 1991 on American over-the-air stations in anaglyph 3D. 3D glasses were sold to viewers, with proceeds going to charity. A frame-by-frame digital restoration by Prasad Corporation of the film was later completed, and the DVD of it was released on October 11, 2005. The 3D version of Hondo has yet to be released on either DVD or Blu-Ray. A restored 3D theatrical version was exhibited for a week in 2015 at the Museum of Modern Art in New York City, and also projected the following year at New York's Film Forum, introduced at both venues by Michael Wayne's wife Gretchen Wayne. Notes The script focuses on psychological descriptions and the drama of the Native Americans from New Mexico. The original book depicted the events taking place in Southeast of what is now Arizona. The action scenes and the 3D photography are also highpoints of the film. John Farrow, the director, and Michael Pate, who played Vittoro, were both Australian. The Second Unit Director is Andrew McLaglen, who later directed the Wayne vehicles McLintock! and The Undefeated. Film footage from Hondo was later incorporated into the opening sequence of Wayne's last film, The Shootist, to illustrate the backstory of Wayne's character. This film marked one of the first appearances of Geraldine Page, who had been a popular stage actress. Part of a 1988 episode of Married... with Children, entitled \\"All in the Family\\", has Al Bundy readying himself to watch Hondo in peace during a three-day weekend, but Peggy's family comes to visit, and their ensuing problems prevent him from seeing the film, just as their antics prevented him from seeing Shane the year before. Moreover, a 1994 episode of Married... with Children, entitled \\"Assault and Batteries\\", has a subplot in which Al is desperate not to miss a television airing of Hondo because, as he explains, it is the best John Wayne movie and it only airs \\"once every 17 years\\". Al does miss this airing at the end of the episode and will have to wait until February 18, 2011 to see it again.\\"Assault and Batteries\\", Married... with Children. Fox Broadcasting Company, New York City. 8 May 1994. Television. Al holds the film in very high esteem, once telling Peggy's family members, \\"Your lives are meaningless compared to Hondo!\\" One of the most prevalent images of John Wayne remains a full-length publicity photo from the film in which Wayne wears the buckskin suit and military hat. Two later John Wayne Westerns contain subtle references to \\"Hondo.\\" In Rio Lobo (1970), a wanted poster for Hondo Lane can be seen on a wall in the sheriff's office. In the 1973 film The Train Robbers, the chief male and female characters (played by Wayne and Ann-Margret) are \\"Lane\\" and \\"Mrs. Lowe\\", as they are in \\"Hondo\\". NBA player John Havlicek of the Boston Celtics got his nickname \\"Hondo\\" from the film.

For individuals, physical presence in a jurisdiction is the main test. Some jurisdictions also determine residency of an individual by reference to a variety of other factors, such as the ownership of a home or availability of accommodation, family, and financial interests. For companies, some jurisdictions determine the residence of a corporation based on its place of incorporation. Other jurisdictions determine the residence of a corporation by reference to its place of management. Some jurisdictions use both a place- of-incorporation test and a place-of-management test. Domicile is, in common law jurisdictions, a different legal concept to residence, though the two may lead to the same result. The criteria for residence in double taxation treaties may be different from those of domestic law. Residency in domestic law allows a country to create a tax claim based on the residence over a person, whereas in a double taxation treaty it has the effect of restricting such tax claim in order to avoid double taxation. Residency or citizenship taxation systems are typically linked with worldwide taxation, as opposed to territorial taxation. Therefore, it is particularly relevant when two countries simultaneously claim a person to be resident within their jurisdiction. In international tax law Double taxation treaties generally follow the OECD Model Convention. Other relevant models are the UN Model Convention, in the case of treaties with developing countries and the US Model Convention, in the case of treaties negotiated by the United States.  OECD and UN Model Convention  The OECD Model Convention and the UN Model Convention are identical. They first provide for a definition of \\"resident of a Contracting State\\": > 1\\\\. For the purposes of this Convention, the term \\"resident of a Contracting > State\\" means any person who, under the laws of that State, is liable to tax > therein by reason of his domicile, residence, place of management or any > other criterion of a similar nature, and also includes that State and any > political subdivision or local authority thereof. This term, however, does > not include any person who is liable to tax in that State in respect only of > income from sources in that State or capital situated therein. The definition is followed by \\"tie-breaker\\" rules for individuals and non- individuals, which result in the person being considered resident in only one of the countries: > 2\\\\. Where by reason of the provisions of paragraph 1 an individual is a > resident of both Contracting States, then his status shall be determined as > follows: :a) he shall be deemed to be a resident only of the State in which > he has a permanent home available to him; if he has a permanent home > available to him in both States, he shall be deemed to be a resident only of > the State with which his personal and economic relations are closer (centre > of vital interests); :b) if the State in which he has his centre of vital > interests cannot be determined, or if he has not a permanent home available > to him in either State, he shall be deemed to be a resident only of the > State in which he has an habitual abode; :c) if he has a habitual abode in > both States or in neither of them, he shall be deemed to be a resident only > of the State of which he is a national; :d) if he is a national of both > States or of neither of them, the competent authorities of the Contracting > States shall settle the question by mutual agreement. 3\\\\. Where by reason of > the provisions of paragraph 1 a person other than an individual is a > resident of both Contracting States, then it shall be deemed to be a > resident only of the State in which its place of effective management is > situated.  US Model Convention  The US Model Convention is similar to the OECD and UN Model Convention with respect to residency of individuals. However, if non- individuals are considered to be residents of two countries, the default result is that they shall be considered resident of none for the purposes of claiming the benefits of the tax treaty. The countries will engage in mutual agreement procedures to reach a decision. Therefore, domestic taxation will continue as normal until an agreement is reached. BEPSAction 6= The Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) project developed by the OECD and endorsed by the G-20 reached a critical milestone in October 2015, where final deliverables for 15 Actions were presented. Paragraph 48 of Action 6's final deliverable indicated a new wording for the \\"tie-breaker\\" relating to non- individuals, whereas it will no longer be automatically determined in the forthcoming revision of the model.Preventing the Granting of Treaty Benefits in Inappropriate Circumstances, Action 6 - 2015 Final Report According to the new wording, the \\"tie-breaker\\" will depend entirely on mutual agreement between both countries: > 3\\\\. Where by reason of the provisions of paragraph 1 a person other than an > individual is a resident of both Contracting State, the competent > authorities of the Contracting States shall endeavour to determine by mutual > agreement the Contracting State of which such person shall be deemed to be a > resident for the purposes of the Convention, having regard to its place of > effective management, the place where it is incorporated or otherwise > constituted and any other relevant factors. In the absence of such > agreement, such person shall not be entitled to any relief or exemption form > tax provided by this Convention except to the extent and in such manner as > may be agreed upon by the competent authorities of the Contracting States. =Action 15= Pending work on BEPS Action 15, concerning the development of a 'Multilateral Instrument to Modify Bilateral Tax Treaties' may result on the amendment of a large number of existing treaties to reflect, particularly, the new wording in Action 6. There are currently a considerable number of counties involved in this instrument's negotiation but it is still unclear what changes and what countries will agree to the changes. The work on the multilateral instrument will be concluded and open of signature on December 31, 2016. In the United Kingdom=In the United Kingdom for companies A company is generally treated as resident in the United Kingdom for tax purposes if it is incorporated in the United Kingdom or, if the company is not incorporated in the United Kingdom, if its central management and control are exercised in the United Kingdom. \\"Central management and control\\" refers to the highest level of oversight, usually as exercised by the board, rather than day-to-day management.For HMRC views see SP 1/90 and the International Tax Handbook chapters 3 and 4. For a statement of judicial views, see ‚ÄúControl of Special Purpose Vehicles‚Äù (John Chadwick) [2007] Jersey & Guernsey Law Review 153. For general studies, see Corporate Residence and International Taxation (Robert Couzin, IBFD 2002); Stephen Brandon QC‚Äôs Taxation of Non-UK Companies and their Shareholders (Key Haven Publications, 2002). In the United Kingdom for individuals An individual who spends more than 183 days in the UK in a tax year is UK resident.Section 831(1) Income Tax Act 2007 Apart from that, there are no clear statutory guidelines. The question of whether someone is UK resident is a question of fact and degree, to be determined \\"on all the circumstances of the case.\\"Gaines-Cooper v HMRC [2007] STC (SCD) 23 at [165]. The vagueness of this test has often been criticised. Viscount Sumner said in Levene v IRC: :The words \\"resident in the United Kingdom\\", \\"... guide the subject remarkably little as to the limits within which he must pay and beyond which he is free. .. The Legislature has, however, left the language of the Acts substantially as it was in [1801], nor can I confidently say that the decided cases have always illuminated matters. In substance persons are chargeable or exempt, as the case may be, according as they are deemed by this body of Commissioners or that to be resident or the reverse, whatever resident may mean in the particular circumstances of each case. The tribunal thus provided is neither bound by the findings of other similar tribunals in other cases nor is it open to review, so long as it commits no palpable error of law, and the Legislature practically transfers to it the function of imposing taxes on individuals, since it empowers them in terms so general that no one can be certainly advised in advance whether he must pay or can escape payment.Levene v IRC 13 TC 486 at p.502. Similarly, the Codification Committee concluded: :an enquirer can only be told that the question whether he is resident or not is a question of fact for the Commissioners but that by the study of the effect of a large body of case law he may [emphasis added] be able to make an intelligent forecast of their decision.Income Tax Codification Committee Report 1936 Cmd.5131 pp.34‚Äì39. The number of days present in the UK is not a decisive factor (unless the number of days exceeds 183 in a tax year). In one case a foreigner who spent 5 months in the UK was held not UK resident.IRC v Zorab 11 TC 289. In the view of HMRC someone who exceeds 90 days on a four-year average is UK resident, but considerable emphasis is given to the fact that someone who averages less than 90 days may also be UK resident.HMRC 6 para 1.2, 1.5.13, 1.5.22, 2.2 Before 2009/10, the vagueness of the law did not seem to matter because HMRC published relatively clear guidelines in document IR20. That document has been withdrawn from 2009/10 and replaced with the much vaguer guidance in HMRC 6. HMRC currently argue that they are not bound by the terms of IR20 for years prior to 2009/10. Whether that is correct is currently the subject of litigation.Gaines-Cooper v HMRC It is clear that HMRC are not in any way bound by the terms of HMRC 6, which contains a very full disclaimer.HMRC6 section 1 In Germany All tax resident individuals are taxed on their worldwide income, regardless of the source. This would include salary, dividends, etc. earned from one's limited company. Generally, individuals are deemed to be tax resident if they are physically present in Germany for more than six months in any one calendar year or for a consecutive period of six months over a calendar year-end. This ruling is applied retrospectively so presence in Germany from 1 March to 30 November, for example, would make one a German tax resident and therefore subject to German tax on the worldwide income for the entire period rather than just from the beginning of the seventh month. An individual can also be deemed tax resident if they acquire an abode in Germany. This can include renting, as opposed to purchasing, a property but only if the duration of the lease is deemed to be more than temporary. For this reason, to avoid German tax residency, short-term (such as three months) should be taken out wherever possible. Non-resident individuals are taxed on German-source income only. In the case of salary and benefits from your limited company, the source is German since the duties of the employment are being performed in Germany. However, dividends from your limited company (assuming this is not deemed to have a permanent establishment in Germany: see below) would be from a non- German source regardless of where the dividends are received. There is, therefore, scope for tax mitigation here if one does not become a German tax resident (although non-German taxes may also need to be considered). In France In France, taxpayers are either \\"domiciled\\" in France or are \\"non- resident\\". Domiciled individuals are subject to French tax on worldwide income, but non-residents are not taxed on foreign-source income. Many treaty exemptions may apply, however (e.g. foreign-source trading or rental income). Under Article 4B of the French Tax Code (Code G√©n√©ral des Imp√¥ts), an individual is resident in France for tax purposes if: * they have a home (foyer) or their principal place of physical presence in France, * they have their professional activity in France, unless such activity is only ancillary, or * they have the centre of their economic interests in France. French courts have ruled that the principal place of physical presence test is only applicable where the \\"home\\" test cannot be applied. A \\"home\\" is to be construed as the place where the taxpayer normally lives, without any regard being given to the taxpayer's temporary stays in another country. As the \\"home\\" test is concerned with where the taxpayer's family ties are (i.e. where the spouse and children live), this test is highly unlikely to apply to single individuals. Consequently, the principal place of physical presence test should be viewed as primarily applicable to single individuals only. \\"Principal place of physical presence\\" covers a wider range of situations that a basic 183-day rule would have. This is because the taxpayer's physical presence in France in a given calendar year will be tested against his presence in another country. Perpetual travelers must therefore be able to demonstrate that they have resided in a foreign country for a longer period in the relevant calendar year. In Liechtenstein In Liechtenstein, generally speaking all registered residents are also deemed to be tax resident in Liechtenstein and are thus taxed there on their entire worldwide income and wealth. In Switzerland In Switzerland, generally speaking all registered residents are also deemed to be tax resident tax resident in Switzerland and are thus taxed there on their entire worldwide income and wealth, except on the income and wealth from foreign business or real estate or where tax treaties limit double taxation. For tax purposes, residence may also arise if a person stays in Switzerland for 30 days, or for 90 days if he or she does not work. Either a progressive or proportional income tax is levied by the Confederation and by the cantons on the income of natural persons. The income tax is imposed as a payroll tax on foreign workers without a residence permit, and in the form of a withholding tax on certain transient persons, such as foreign musicians performing in Switzerland. Taxable income includes all funds accruing to a person from all sources, in principle without deduction of losses or expenses, and usually including the rental value of a house lived in by its owner. Non-working foreigners resident in Switzerland may choose to pay a lump-sum tax instead of the normal income tax. The tax, which is generally much lower than the normal income tax, is nominally levied on the taxpayer's living expenses, but in practice (which varies from canton to canton), it is common to use the quintuple of the rent paid by the taxpayer as a basis for the lump-sum taxation. This option contributes to Switzerland's status as a tax haven, and has induced many wealthy foreigners to live in Switzerland. In Russia In Russian Federation all tax resident individuals are taxed on their worldwide income, regardless of the source. Individuals are deemed to be tax residents if they are physically present in Russia for more than 183 days during consecutive period of 12 months. The period of presence in Russia is not interrupted in case individual is out of the country for less than six months for educational purposes or for medical treatment. Foreign servants and civil servants that were sent abroad for work purposes are deemed tax residents no matter how long they really are present in Russia.IRC of Russian Federation, part 2, section 8, chapter 23, clause 207 See also *International taxation *Permanent establishment *Permanent tourist *Physical presence test *Tax exile *Tax haven *Tax treaty ReferencesSources * Category:International taxation Category:Residency Category:Home ","title":"Tax residence"},{"id":"4429381","text":"The Queensland Show Choir was founded by Robert Clark in 1984, originally as a training program for young singers. It was then called the Queensland Youth Choir The choir has since evolved into three performance choirs: Poco Voci, Stella Voce, and Vivace . The Queensland Show Choir also run a community choir Vox Populus, and an early childhood music program Bambino Music. The choir's home is the Old Museum Building, and over the years, the choir has produced many well-known music professionals such as Jason Barry-Smith and Tarita Botsman.  Name Change  Official Queensland Youth Choir logo In 2012, the choir officially changed its name to the Queensland Show Choir. Since the introduction of Vox Populus and More Than Words it was thought that the name no longer suited the organisation, which now catered for all ages. The name change also helped reaffirm the artistic style Robert Clark founded QYC on in 1984. The organisation was inspired by the Show Choir movement in the United States and in particular, a group called the Singing Hoosiers  Ensembles  There are several vocal ensembles which are part of the umbrella group of the Queensland Show Choir. VoiceWorks VoiceWorks was the Queensland Youth Choir's flagship ensemble, with members from 17 to 25 years of age. This ensemble performs all year round, and has had the experience of performing with many famous people, including Michael Crawford, Tina Arena, and Frank Sinatra. In 2008 VoiceWorks competed in Channel 7's Battle of the Choirs where they advanced to the semi-finals and finished in the top four behind University of Newcastle, Vox Synergy and Harambee. After being inactive for a number of years, VoiceWorks recommended in 2018 as an ensemble for young adults. This group of school leavers and university students come together during term time to make music together. They perform year round, at community and private events, Christmas Caroles, in QSC's annual concert series and at the annual Brisbane Sings. No audition is required for entry into the VoiceWorks choir. Vivace  Students from Year 8 to Year 12 perform in Vivace. This ensemble also performs all year round at community and private events, Christmas Carol concerts, and in QSC's annual concert series. An audition is required for entry into the Vivace Choir. Stella Voce Formerly known as The Queensland Children's Choir, the group was renamed to StellaVoce in 2005, and remains under that name today. This choir is for children in Year 4 through to Year 9, and performs in both public and private concerts. The group was founded by Rhonda Coady, and choristers in this group are auditioned. Poco Voci Poco Voci is a non-auditioned group for students from pre-school through to Year 4. The main aim of this group is to develop music skills in young children, and as such, this choir performs less frequently.  Vox Populus  Vox Populus is a non-auditioned, SATB, community choir for anyone over the age of 18. The aim of the group is to encourage community singing in a fun environment.  More Than Words  More Than Words is a corporate vocal group, started for the express purpose of catering to functions which require a smaller ensemble. Membership does not usually exceed 12 members. More Than Words perform at many events around Brisbane, such as the Best of the Pops concert at QPAC in 2016 with the Queensland Pops Orchestra.  Brisbane Sings  Brisbane Sings has been held since 2012. The Queensland Show Choir produces this annual massed choir event, held in the Queensland Performing Arts Centre (QPAC). President's Trophy Night President's Trophy Night is a special annual event designed to showcase individual performers within QSC. Entrance into the finals of this event is possible after performers complete a heat in either solo, duet, or small ensemble format. Prizes are also given to those who place 1st, 2nd and 3rd in their respective age group. In addition to this, encouragement awards are also presented to performers in the junior and senior categories.

Plot The film begins with a written disclaimer: > During the film you are about to see, you will be subject to subliminal > messages and mild hypnosis. This will cause you no physical harm or lasting > effect, but if for any reason you lose control or feel that your mind is > leaving your body -- leave the auditorium immediately. The disclaimer is accompanied by a narrator, who advises viewers to take caution regarding their surroundings once the film has begun, and not to engage in conversation with any unknown individuals for the duration of the running time. In the Los Angeles theater The Rex, moviegoers watch the film within a film, The Mommy. The Mommy tells the story of John Pressman (Michael Lerner), an extremely myopic, uncontrolled diabetic who works as an ophthalmologist's assistant and is progressively growing blind. For unstated reasons, his overbearing mother Alice (Zelda Rubinstein) hypnotizes him and induces him to murder people so that he can remove their eyes and bring them back to her. One evening, John‚Äîagainst his mother's wishes‚Äîbarricades himself inside of a movie theater playing The Lost World, where he sets about killing the patrons one by one with a scalpel. Once John's rampage becomes apparent, the surviving moviegoers attempt to flee the now sealed-off theater. The police bring Alice to the theater in an attempt to end the siege; in the course of trying to talk John down, Alice is accidentally shot to death by the police. The last scenes of The Mommy show John being placed into police custody and a detective looking upon Alice's corpse one more time. As The Mommy wears on, patrons of The Rex begin to experience anxiety attacks and disorientation in response to the events onscreen. In particular, one man grows progressively agitated, constantly checking his watch; and a teenage girl, Patty, begins to break down in tears, though she cannot entirely articulate her fear. At a key point in the film, the man exits the theater and approaches the concession stand, where he's recognized by an employee as a frequent patron of The Mommy. Patty's friend, Linda, goes to use the bathroom moments later, and witnesses The Man removing a gun from his jacket and killing the concession worker and another theater employee. The Man drags their bodies to the bathroom‚Äîan act synchronized with John killing a woman in the bathroom of a movie theater in The Mommy. Linda escapes the theater and stops a man passing on the street, whom she asks to call the police. In The Rex, the man barricades the projectionist in the projector booth and then slips back into the theater, where he holds Patty at gunpoint and begins reciting dialogue from The Mommy. When John Pressman begins his theater rampage onscreen, the man begins indiscriminately shooting patrons of The Rex, using Patty as a human shield. Outside The Rex, a SWAT team arrives, in synchronicity with the police's arrival at the theater in The Mommy. The police obtain access to the projector booth via the roof and send in a sniper. The man holds Patty hostage in front of the theater, addressing Alice onscreen and asking her to come save him. Attempts by the police to engage the man fail; when the police in The Mommy kill Alice, the man becomes enraged, throws Patty to the ground, and resumes firing into the audience; the police sniper then shoots and kills him. Patty, looking up at the screen, has a vision of John gouging out her eye with a scalpel. Outside, Patty and Linda are reunited and Patty is taken to the hospital for an evaluation. Doctors assure her that she is physically all right, though the experience was mentally scarring. As Linda leaves, she is attacked on an elevator by an unseen orderly who aims a scalpel for her throat. The orderly then proceeds to Patty's room and is revealed to be John, who assures Patty that he's only a figment of her imagination. Patty screams as John examines her eyes. As the screen cuts to black, the camera pulls back to show a movie theater of patrons watching the events onscreen, revealing that Patty's story was in fact a film within a film within a film. The credits for Anguish roll as the theater patrons leave one by one.

Author and film critic Leonard Maltin awarded the film 2.5 out of 4 stars, calling it \\"Imaginative but overly violent\\". TV Guide rated the film three out of five stars, writing, \\"Anguish is a well-crafted and entertaining exercise in cinematic style, and a good example of an adventurous director turning to the horror genre in order to have more room to flex his pyrotechnical muscles.\\" Time Out London called it \\"A strikingly original, intricately constructed, and extremely gruesome horror film\\", while noting that the execution occasionally didn't match its ambition.

The station is owned by Indiana University Student Broadcasting. Operation WIUX is completely operated by student volunteers currently enrolled at Indiana University. There are no paid employees or faculty supervisors. History * 1963 - WQAD, a carrier current AM radio station was founded in Wright Quadrangle at Indiana University, with a frequency of 730 kHz. The studios were originally in Todd House (through the odd entryway on the south side of Todd) and later in Elliott House (in the basement storage area, off the lounge area). WQAD beamed its programming to Wright Quadrangle, Teter Quadrangle, Read Center, Forest Quadrangle and what was then known as the Graduate Residence Center or GRC for the first time on 730 AM via carrier current throughout Wright Quad on January 5, 1963. The station was started by physics major Bill Weaverling, chemistry major Steve Peterson, and education major Jerry Pugh. As a note, at the time of WQAD, Wright Quadrangle housed only men. * 1964 - WFQR Radio, also a carrier current AM radio station, was founded in Foster Quadrangle; the call letters stood for \\"Foster Quadrangle Radio.\\" Its programming was beamed to the dormitories along Fee Lane, including Foster, McNutt and Briscoe Quadrangles. * 1965 - WFQR Radio changed its call letters to WIN, and continued to operate from Foster Quadrangle. * 1966 - Phil Murphy formed the Indiana University Radio Network (IURN) to combine sales for both student stations. At times during the 1966-67 school year, each station originated a \\"network feed\\" which was sent to the carrier current transmitters of all wired student housing. At other times for this final school year, WIN and WQAD maintained separate programming. * September 1967 - The two stations merge to form WIUS Radio, still strictly a carrier current operation. It was supposed to be at 620 kHz in all student housing, but until the end of carrier current operations, some transmitters continued to operate at 730 kHz. The original WIUS studios were located at 617 E. 8th St., today the site of the Mathers Museum of World Cultures. The building, a two-story brick house, once belonged to a Bloomington mayor and to legendary Indiana University swimming coach James \\"Doc\\" Counsilman. All IU undergraduate dormitories are wired, and an ambitious plan to wire graduate housing and IU fraternities and sororities is unveiled; little of this plan is ever accomplished. * October 10, 1972 - On the first day of National Fire Prevention Week, a pre-dawn fire destroyed the original WIUS studios. The fire was arson, set in at least two locations, the sales office at the front of the building and the administrative offices in the rear; the person or persons responsible have never been arrested. For one week, WIUS programming aired from a spare studio of the Indiana University Radio and Television Service. WIUS then relocated until Spring Break of 1973 to the old Elliott House WQAD studios, using salvaged and borrowed equipment, records that survived the fire and records from student DJ collections. * March 1973 - WIUS moves over spring break from Elliott House into a house at 815 E. 8th St., two blocks from the previous WIUS house. WQAX Logo from 1970s * September 1973 - The IU Student Broadcast Corporation, a not-for-profit student corporation, creates a new radio station, WQAX, partly out of frustrated efforts to get WIUS onto the off-campus cable TV system; the attitude of one IU administrator towards the idea was quoted at the time as \\"Students shouldn't be talking to townspeople.\\" Many of the first WQAX programmers were former WIUS members, and the two stations maintained a friendly rivalry as WIUS finally gained access to its own cable FM frequency. * Spring 1974 - In addition to carrier current, WIUS begins to air its programming on the local Bloomington, Ind., cable TV system, then owned by Monroe Cablevision, at 95.1 mHz. Broadcasts to IU dormitories and a select number of fraternities and sororities (notably Alpha Epsilon Pi, Evans Scholars and the houses surrounding them) remained carrier current, although after 1977 the carrier current system was allowed to deteriorate and reception was often spotty or absent in certain dormitories. It wasn't until the late 1980s that the IU dormitories would be wired for cable; as soon as they were, WIUS became exclusively cable-accessible. * 1973 to 1993 - WQAX, identified on-air as \\"Quacks,\\" was a college/community access radio station at 100.3 MHz (non-broadcast) on the local cable TV system in Bloomington, Ind. The station was free-form and volunteer-driven. It offered Indiana University students, wanna-be DJs, music maniacs, and local eccentrics a way to learn about radio. And it added, for a defined period of time, a yet-to-be duplicated brand of insanity to the local landscape. Originally operating from an office in the Indiana Memorial Union, supplied by the IU Student Association, which assisted in its founding as an alternative to the then- tightly formatted contemporary hit rock WIUS programming, WQAX studios moved several times during its 20-year life. * 1985 - After several years of sometimes sporadic broadcasts and funding so bad that portions of the WIUS House were rented out as student apartments, a group of students dedicated to IU radio formed a committee to search out money for WIUS‚Äîand with the university's help they provided funding to help improve the station. This funding lasted until the end of the decade. * 1993 - WQAX was forced to close for want of money (or, some have maintained, taken an extended hiatus). Most of its music library and equipment were dispersed. Its members, who over the years numbered in the hundreds, likewise scattered. WIUX Contour Map [FCC file: FL1104780 * 1994 - WIUS was allowed a portion of the student activity fee for each of the following two school years. This funding allowed WIUS to further its evolution, and it added open-air AM broadcasts beginning October 3, from a low-power transmitter, identical to those used for roadside traffic reports in any cities, atop the Indiana University Library, broadcasting to an approximately three-mile radius at 1570 kHz, while maintaining its cable FM presence. This transmitter will remain in place until January 2006. * 1998 - WIUS stayed with the information technology boom by adding a RealAudio server to their existing website. This served as a new way for alumni and parents, as well as other people outside of the Bloomington area to listen to WIUS. The amount of increased interest allowed WIUS to make a partnership with Nibblebox.com to help broaden the server and increase the number of users to the RealAudio link. * 2004 ‚Äì An application for a student-operated FM radio license is submitted to the FCC. The FCC delays granting a low-power FM license to WIUS because of another application in the Bloomington area. * March 2005 - After settling the debate in court, the FCC grants the permit to WIUS and assigns the operating frequency of 100.3 MHz, identical to the former WQAX cable access station. The move to an FCC licensed broadcast FM station, however means that the station will need to change its call letters. Since 1981, WIUS-FM has operated as the FCC-licensed, student-operated FM station at Western Illinois University. The selection of WIUX as the new call sign (usage of the \\"X\\") is a small tribute to the former WQAX, its Indiana student staff (now alumni), and the Bloomington area that it served. * January 2006 - WIUX is born and signs on (over the air) at 100.3 FM, operated and programmed by IU students, Early WIUX logo * June 2007 - WIUX moves to 99.1 FM after the FCC awarded the 100.3 FM frequency to WYGB in Columbus, Ind. * July 2014 - WIUX relocates to a temporary location at 715-717 E. 8th Street, just a block away from its previous house. The move comes as Indiana University makes plans to build a new fraternity house on 8th Street between Woodlawn Avenue and Park Avenue. * July 2017 - WIUX moves from its house into Franklin Hall, home of the new IU media school. FCC/Right to broadcast controversy On October 31, 2006, WIUX announced on its website that the Federal Communications Commission was granting the 100.3 mHz frequency to a Class A FM radio station in Edinburgh, Indiana, taking over the frequency WIUX had been granted only the previous year. Because the Indiana University student-based station operates as a Low Power station, the FCC maintains that it has the right to move the station or remove it from the air. Indiana University filed a petition against the move. The Dean of Students and Vice President of Student Affairs at Indiana University, Richard McKaig, states in the official petition (available through the WIUX website): \\"The Indiana frequency did not appear on the Commission‚Äôs internet site or on a public notice until after the comment reply date of June 13, 2006 deadline. As a result, we did not have a fair chance to file public comments.\\" On November 6, both Indiana senators, Evan Bayh (Dem) and Richard Lugar (Rep), wrote petitions of support for WIUX to the FCC. On June 4, 2007 WIUX moved from 100.3 FM to 99.1 FM. Radio format WIUX is a variety radio format college radio station. It features music of different genres, news, sports, and talk programming. Students broadcast live play-by- play of Indiana Hoosiers football, men's and women's basketball, and men's and women's soccer. Awards In 2016 and 2020, WIUX won \\"Best college radio station in America\\" in the Intercollegiate Broadcasting System Awards. In 2009, WIUX was nominated for the mtvU Woodie Award for best college radio station in America.

Upon the death of the grantee, a designated inheritance such as a parcel of land, a peerage, or a monarchy, passes automatically to that living, legitimate, natural descendant of the grantee who is most senior in descent according to primogeniture, males being preferred, however, over their sisters regardless of relative age; and thereafter the property continues to pass to subsequent descendants of the grantee, according to the same formula, upon the death of each subsequent heir. Baronies created by writ of summons to Parliament usually descend to heirs of the body of the grantee, and may thus be inherited by females. By the terms of the Act of Settlement 1701 and the Acts of Union 1707, the Crown of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland descends to heirs of the body of the Electress Sophia of Hanover who are not Catholics or married to Catholics, subject to subsequent modification by Parliament (e.g. His Majesty's Declaration of Abdication Act 1936 and the Succession to the Crown Act 2013). In property law, a conveyance by the owner O \\"To A and heirs of the body\\", without more, creates a fee tail for the grantee (A) with a reversion in the grantor (O) should the natural, lawful descendants of the grantee all die out. Each person who inherits according to this formula is considered an heir at law of the grantee. Since the inheritance may not pass to someone who is not a natural, lawful descendant of the grantee, the heir is necessarily also \\"of the body\\" of the grantee. Collateral kin, who share some or all of the grantee's ancestry, but do not directly descend from the grantee, may not inherit. When there are no more heirs of the body, the terms of the original grant are expired, and the property becomes extinct (e.g. peerage), or some other criterion for allocating the property to a new possessor must be applied. If the original grant stipulated an alternative formula for succession upon exhaustion of heirs, that formula is immediately applicable. Thus, if a peerage is granted to \\"heirs of the body of John Smith, failing which, to heirs general\\", the title would pass to a descendant of John Smith's sibling when all of John Smith's descendants die out. Thus property settled upon someone and the heirs of their body‚Äîwhether male, female, or generally‚Äîwill pass to children, grandchildren and so on, but not to nephews of the grantee, his or her sisters, uncles and their descendants.

He first appeared in Strange Adventures #1 (cover-dated August 1950), and was created by science fiction author Edmond Hamilton and artist Howard Sherman. Publication history 'The Adventures of Chris KL99' first appeared in Strange Adventures #1 (August 1950). With a slight name change to KL-99 from issue #2, he made eight appearances in the title in total - issues #1-#3, #5, #7, #9 and #11, ending with Strange Adventures #15 (December 1951), all written by Edmond Hamilton and drawn by Howard Sherman. Since then, a brief appearance in DC Comics Presents #78 (February 1985), a cameo appearance in Crisis on Infinite Earths #10 (January 1986), and a brief but completely revised origin story in Secret Origins #43 (August 1989) have been his only other appearances to date. Fictional character biography According to his early adventures, Chris KL, the son of Jon ST-94, was born on a spaceship somewhere between Earth and Mars, the first Earth child to be born in outer space, in the 21st century, and was named after Christopher Columbus. 'The Menace of the Green Nebula' , Strange Adventures #1 (Aug. 1950) He became an instant celebrity, but was kidnapped by aliens on his eighth birthday and not returned for nine years. It turned out that the aliens were a dying race, and chose him to train for some still unknown purpose. They had not meant to kidnap him, but were unable to communicate their wishes to anyone else. 'The Saga of Chris KL-99' , Secret Origins #43 (August 1989)This 1980s story changes Chris's motivations completely. His attitude to his parents and Earth is one of hatred for their interrupting his learning with the aliens, treating them as hostile and killing most of what is left of the race. In the original stories, he went to Space Academy because he wanted to go to space to find his missing parents; in the revised version, he goes into space before Academy and tries to find the surviving aliens. After his return, his parents left Earth to find new worlds to colonize on the exploratory spaceship 'The Starfarer', and were not seen again. According to one version of his story, Chris then vowed to go to Space Academy so he could journey to find them when he was older,but see note above and after graduating from Space Academy '99' was appended to his name because of his 99% rating at the Academy, and he later became the greatest space explorer of his day. Another version of Chris's story has him not returning to Earth, but traveling in space to find the last surviving aliens to continue his training with them, appending the KL to his name in honor of the alien race, the K'l, and the 99 in acknowledgement that there were only 98 of the aliens left alive when he was with them.Secret Origins #43 (Aug. 1989) Whatever the correct version, accompanied by Halk, a Martian scientist (once Chief Scientist of Mars), Jero, a Venusian, and a pet chameleon dog, Loopy, whose color changes according to his mood, he discovered many alien worlds (and a sub-atomic universe 'The World Inside The Atom' , Strange Adventures #5 (February 1951)) in his spaceship 'The Pioneer'. In recognition of his work, he was given the authority to protect the people of the new worlds he discovered from danger as 'Commissioner for Protection of Planetary Peoples'. Chris eventually found 'The Starfarer' and his parents' graves on the planet where they had died saving the rest of the crew in a crash. 'The Lost Earthmen' , Strange Adventures #7 (April 1951) Other adventures involved saving the ancient Earth monuments from aliens in need of metal to save their universe, 'The Metal World' , Strange Adventures #3 (December 1950) and rediscovering a second moon that used to orbit Earth millions of years ago. 'The Missing Moon' , Strange Adventures #11 (August 1951) He was present during the DC Universe Crisis on Infinite Earths, first in his own time to help Superman and the Forgotten Heroes defeat the Forgotten Villains at the start of the Crisis, 'The Triad' , DC Comics Presents #78, (February 1985) and then towards the end of Crisis to help with powering the time machines critical to saving the universe.

These meals were first proposed in Filippo Tommaso Marinetti and Fillia's Manifesto of Futurist Cooking, published in the Turin Gazzetta del Popolo on December 28, 1930. History The Futurist movement recognized that people \\"think, dream and act according to what they eat and drink\\" so cooking and eating needed to become subservient to the proper aesthetic experience that Futurism favored. Revolutionary in its expectations of overturning set patterns, some of its more interesting ideas for the realm of cuisine were: * No more pasta, as it causes lassitude, pessimism and lack of passion * Perfect meals requiring originality and harmony in table setting, including all implements, food aesthetics and tastes, and absolute originality in the food * Sculpted foods, including meats whose main appeal is to the eye and imagination * Abolition of the knife and fork * Use of perfumes to enhance the tasting experience The Manifesto of Futurist Cooking also proposed that the way in which meals were served be fundamentally changed. For example: * Some food on the table would not be eaten, but only experienced by the eyes and nose * Food would arrive rapidly and contain many flavors, but only a few mouthfuls in size * All political discussion and speeches would be forbidden * Music and poetry would be forbidden except during certain intervals One of the proposed settings for these \\"perfect meals\\" incorporated the Futurist love of machinery. The diners would eat in a mock aircraft, whose engines' vibrations would stimulate the appetite. The tilted seats and tables would \\"shake out\\" the diners' pre- conceived notions, while their taste buds would be overwhelmed by highly original dishes listed on aluminium cards. Traditional kitchen equipment would be replaced by scientific equipment, bringing modernity and science to the kitchen. Suggested equipment included: * Ozonizers‚Äîto give food the smell of ozone * Ultraviolet ray lamps‚Äîto activate vitamins and other \\"active properties\\" * Electrolyzers‚Äîto decompose items into new forms and properties * Colloidal mills‚Äîto pulverize any food item * Autoclaves, dialyzers, atmospheric and vacuum stills‚Äîto cook food without destroying vitamins * Chemical indicators or analyzers‚Äîto help the cook determine if sauces need more salt, sugar, or vinegar The Italian public was not won over by Marinetti's manifesto regarding cuisine. In fact, immediately following its publication the Italian press broke into uproar. Doctors were measured in their response, agreeing that habitual consumption of pasta was fattening and recommending a varied diet; but the Duke of Bovino, Mayor of Naples, was firmer in his views: \\"The angels in Paradise,\\" he told a reporter, \\"eat nothing but vermicelli al pomodoro [fine spaghetti with tomato sauce].\\" Marinetti replied that this confirmed his suspicions about the monotony of Paradise. The Futurists amused themselves and outraged the public by inventing preposterous new dishes, most of which were shocking due to their unusual combinations and exotic ingredients. For example, mortadella with nougat or pineapples with sardines.David, Elizabeth, Italian Food, Penguin Books, 1974, pp.93-94 Marinetti wanted Italians to stop eating foreign food and to stop using foreign food words: a bar should be called quisibeve (literally, \\"here one drinks\\" in Italian), a sandwich should be called traidue (between-two), a ma√Ætre d'h√¥tel a guidopalato (palate-guide), and so on. Elizabeth David, the cookery writer, comments that Marinetti's ideas about food contained a germ of common sense, but behind his jesting lay the Fascist obsession with nationalism. Marinetti wanted to prepare the Italians for war. \\"Spaghetti is no food for fighters,\\" he declared. Example meals and dishes *Italian Breasts in the Sunshine: A Futurist dessert that features almond paste topped with a strawberry, then sprinkled with fresh black pepper. *Diabolical Roses: Deep-fried red rose heads in full bloom. *Divorced Eggs: Hard boiled eggs are cut in half; their yolks are removed and put on a \\"poltiglia\\" (puree) of potatoes, and their whites on one of carrots. *Milk in a Green Light: A large bowl of cold milk, a few teaspoons of honey, many black grapes, and several red radishes illuminated by a green light. The author suggest it be served with a \\"polibibita\\" or cocktail of mineral water, beer, and blackberry juice. *Tactile Dinner: A multi-course meal featured in Marinetti's The Futurist Cookbook. Pajamas have been prepared for the dinner, each one covered with a different material such as sponge, cork, sandpaper, or felt. As the guests arrive, each puts on a pair of the pajamas. Once all have arrived and are dressed in pajamas, they are taken to an unlit, empty room. Without being able to see, each guest chooses a dinner partner according to their tactile impression. The guests then enter the dining room, which consists of tables for two, and discover the partner they have selected. :The meal begins. The first course is a 'polyrhythmic salad,' which consists of a box containing a bowl of undressed lettuce leaves, dates and grapes. The box has a crank on the left side. Without using cutlery, the guests eat with their right hand while turning the crank with their left. This produces music to which the waiters dance until the course is finished. :The second course is 'magic food', which is served in small bowls covered with tactile materials. The bowl is held in the left hand while the right picks out balls made of caramel and filled with different ingredients such as dried fruits, raw meat, garlic, mashed banana, chocolate, or pepper. The guests cannot guess what flavor they will encounter next. :The third course is 'tactile vegetable garden,' which is a plate of cooked and raw green vegetables without dressing. The guest eats the vegetables without the use of their hands, instead burying their face in the plate of vegetables, feeling the sensation of the greens on their face and lips. Each time a guest raises their head to chew, the waiters spray their face with perfume. ReferencesSources *Marinetti, Filippo Tommaso, and Fillia, La Cucina Futurista, (ed.

It was originally made by the migration of animals, such as buffalo and deer. Because the Native Americans knew the animals had searched out the best place to cross the creeks and rivers, they too traveled this narrow path. Later used by the pioneers, this was the road to change Iowa's civilization. In 1843, Fort Des Moines, the second post by that name, was built at the confluence of the Raccoon and Des Moines River for the protection of the Sac and Fox Nation from the enemy Sioux and white encroachment until cession of the Three-Year Tract. For the next two years, the natives lived harmoniously in three separate groups not far from the fort. After receiving their annuity payment in the fall of 1845, the Native Americans mournfully made ready to vacate their beloved Iowa. Keokuk led the Sac people single file out of Iowa on September 10, 1845, down the Dragoon Trace to Fort Leavenworth. The braves, women, and children were reported to be half wrapped in blankets, some riding ponies, some ponies only carrying bundles of belongings, others walking silently, single file with sadly bowed heads. Wishecomaque (Hardfish) led a small band of Sac that kept to themselves because they were the remnants of Black Hawk's tribe and bitter from having lost so many loved ones during the Black Hawk War. Eventually, they too followed Keokuk's footsteps down the Trace a few days later. In one last effort to delay the move, Poweshiek asked that his Mesquakies too weak and poor to travel be allowed to remain in Iowa from the winter, but only about 100 of the sick were granted this request. Then Poweshiek, likewise, on October 8, 1845, reluctantly led the Mesquakie down the Dragoon Trace. When he reached the Missouri border around October 11, he met a white settler, perhaps Charles Schooler, whom he knew would not have been allowed to inhabit the Iowa Territory under the treaty agreement. Thinking he had reached the state of Missouri and had gone far enough, Poweshiek turned west to camp where the Grand River met the Missouri border. This was the territory of the Pottawattomies, friends of the Mesquakie, and the invited them to stay. Poweshiek established his village of about forty lodges on the Grand River, not far from the white settlement. Culturally different and fearful, the settlers reported the Native Americans to Fort Des Moines. Rather than sending soldiers which could have inflamed bloodshed, three civilians acquainted with Poweshiek went to talk to the old chief: Dr Campbell, J.B. Scott (hauler of supplies), and Hamilton Thrift (a tailor). Within the year, the Mesquakies removed to the reservation in Kansas. On March 10, 1846, Lieutenant Grier, with the balance of Company I and about 300 Native American stragglers , marched over Van's Hill below 'Coon River and down the Dragoon Trace, ending Fort Des Moines' use as a military post and ownership of these native tribes. Although Iowa became a state on December 28, 1846, it was another ten years before settlers of any great number came to Ringgold County. The trail has been marked with Indian picture writing so that the removal of these tribes out of Iowa is not forgotten.

It was his only release for the label, following Berry's departure in 1975 from Chess Records. It was Berry's last studio album for 38 years, until Chuck in 2017.  Title and packaging  The album cover depicted Berry's guitar in the image of the Millennium Falcon starship, from the 1977 film Star Wars. According to Stephen Thomas Erlewine, the artwork bizarrely (and somewhat appealingly)\\" capitalized on \\"the post-Star Wars wave as it features Chuck's signature Gibson orbiting the Earth (which also nicely plays into the pun of the title, a pun so slight that it's possible to not realize it's a pun without the artwork)\\".  Critical reception  Reviewing Rockit in 1979 for The Village Voice, Robert Christgau gave the album a B-plus grade and was surprised by its quality: Along with 1964's St. Louis to Liverpool, Christgau considered Rockit one of two full-length albums recorded by Berry in his lifetime that were \\"worthy of the name\\", a \\"groove\\" record \\"sharpened by two back-end songs skewering the racist society he'd striven so audaciously to integrate and enlighten\\". Observer journalist Ron Hart named it among Berry's five best albums. In a retrospective review for AllMusic, Erlewine gave Rockit three-and-a-half out of five stars and said, despite conceding to contemporary music trends with a somewhat \\"bright and tight\\" production, Berry offered \\"three or four terrific songs and a bunch of enjoyable straight-ahead rockers that aren't quite as memorable but sure sound good as they play\\".

Life Nazario Sauro Born in Capodistria, in what was then the Austrian Littoral (today Koper, Slovenia), he took to sailing from a very young age, and became the captain of a cargo ship when he was only 20. Later, in 1910, Sauro became an employee of the shipping company Zuttiati, connecting ports in Istria and Dalmatia to San Giorgio di Nogaro and Cervignano del Friuli. After 1866 -when Venice and the republic of Venice region were annexed to Italy- there was some support for irredentism also in Istria, formerly a Venetian possession: Tino Gavardo, Pio Riego Gambini and Nazario Sauro were the most renowned of those who promoted Istrian unification to the Kingdom of Italy. Many of them enrolled voluntarily in the Italian Army during World War I against the Austrian Empire. Some were captured and hanged as traitors by the Austrians.Pignatti Morano, Carlo. La vita di Nazario Sauro ed il martirio dell‚Äôeroe. p.39 When World War I erupted, Sauro went to Venice, joining other refugees who had gathered in the city and were pressuring Italy to join the conflict on the Entente side. When Italy did join the effort in 1915, he was a volunteer in the Italian Navy, and assigned to a torpedo unit, accomplishing over 60 missions over a period of 14 months. In June 1916, he was promoted Sub-Lieutenant on the Giacinto Pullino submarine, and awarded a Silver Medal. On July 30 of that year, Sauro's boat was sent over to carry out a sabotage in the Hungarian port of Fiume (now Rijeka in Croatia), but it crashed into a rock in the Kvarner Gulf. The crew was intercepted by the Austro-Hungarian destroyer Satellit, and imprisoned. Sauro was recognized and placed on trial for his previous act of treason, and, after facing a military tribunal in Pola (now Pula in Croatia) was sentenced to death and hanged. Nazario Sauro wrote two letters to his familiars from the cell; after his death Gabriele D'Annunzio asked for them to be exposed as permanent memory of the heroism of Sauro. They are currently exposed to the Central Museum of Risorgimento in Rome. One of this, addressed to his wife, reads: He is remembered as a hero of Italy. Two ships of the Italian Navy were named in his honour: * The destroyer Nazario Sauro, built in 1926 and sunk in 1941 * The submarine Nazario Sauro, built in 1980 and taken out of service in 2009 See also *Italia irredenta *Istrian Italians *Risorgimento *Cesare Battisti *Guglielmo Oberdan *Istrian-Dalmatian exodus  References  Bibliography  * Carlo Pignatti Morano.

All Apple II models except the Apple IIc had at least seven 50-pin expansion slots, labeled Slots 1 though 7. These slots could hold printed circuit board cards with double- sided edge connectors, 25 \\"fingers\\" on each side, with 100 mil (0.1 inch) spacing between centers. Slot 3 in an Apple IIe that has an 80-column card fitted (which is usually the case) and Slots 1 through 6 in a normally configured Apple IIgs are \\"virtually\\" filled with on-board devices which means that the physical slots cannot be used at all, or only with certain specific cards, unless the conflicting \\"virtual\\" device is disabled. In addition to the seven standard expansion slots, the following computers contained additional, largely special-purpose expansion slots: * Apple II and Apple II Plus: Slot 0 (50-pin, for the firmware card or the 16 kB Apple II Language Card) * Apple IIe: Auxiliary Slot (60-pin; primarily for 80-column display and memory expansion) * Apple IIgs: Memory Expansion Slot (40-pin) Perhaps the most common cards found on early Apple II systems were the Disk II Controller Card, which allowed users of earlier Apple IIs to use the Apple Disk II, a 5¬º inch, 140 kB floppy disk drive; and the Apple 16K Language Card, which increased the base memory of late-model Apple II and standard Apple II Plus units from 48 kB to 64 kB. Both Apple, and dozens of third-party vendors created hundreds of cards for the Apple II series of computers. These expansion slots afforded great opportunities for expansion. In the 2000s, long after the last Apple IIe came off Apple's assembly line in 1993, a handful of manufacturers continue to market peripherals and expansion cards for Apple II computers, not counting students, hobbyists, and other Apple II users who continue to push the original machine to its limits.

It is traded as sandalwood, and its valuable sandalwood oil has been used as an aromatic, a medicine, and a food source. S. spicatum is one of four high-value Santalum species occurring in Australia.  Taxonomy  The Noongar peoples know the plant as uilarac, waang, wolgol, or wollgat, while the Martu people of the Gibson Desert call it dutjahn. Description It is one of four species of the family Santalaceae to occur in Western Australia, and is native to semi- aridSandalwood (Santalum Spicatum) Guide for Farmers - Tree Facts pamphlet- Forest Products Commission - April 2007 specifically states Wheatbelt and areas with minimum 400 mm annual rainfall areas in the Southwest. It has a similar distribution to quandong (Santalum acuminatum) and is a hemi-parasite requiring macronutrients from the roots of hosts. It has a shrubby to small tree habit, but can grow to and is tolerant of drought and salt. The foliage is grey-green in colour. The fruit of S. spicatum is spherical, about in diameter, and orange in colour. An edible kernel with a hard shell forms the bulk of the fruit; the shell is smoother than S. acuminatum's deeply pitted surface. Germination occurs during warm and moist conditions. Distribution  Once found across the southwest of Australia, at the Swan Coastal Plain and inland regions of low rainfall, the impact of over-harvesting and land- clearing for wheat and sheep since the 1880s has greatly reduced the range and population of the species. The marsupial species Bettongia penicillata, known as the woylie, is known to consume and cache the seeds of this species, and is thought to have played a significant role in its dispersal before their decline in the twentieth century. Commercial use A sandalwood cutters' camp in the Wheatbelt of Western Australia Exported from Fremantle Harbour, 1905 The harvest and export of S. spicatum has been an important part of the Western Australian economy, at one time forming more than half of the state's revenue. Settlement of the Wheatbelt area was accelerated by the funds generated by sandalwood found there. Distribution and population of the endemic stands were significantly affected during periods of rural development and economic downturn. The state conservator of forests, Charles Lane-Poole, reported in the 1920s that the export value of the 331205 tons shipped from 1845 to date was ¬£3,061,661; the primary use when imported to China was the manufacture of incense. However, Poole also notes the development of an oil extraction industry and use as an effective medical product. A much smaller, but economically significant, source was in the Quorn region of South Australia, reported in 1928. Research by the Forestry Products Commission (WA), state universities and private industry was undertaken into the cultivation of the tree and the properties of its wood and nuts.University of Queensland site's detailAustralian Arid Lands Botanic Garden - Plants: Sandalwood, Santalum spicatum Replanting has occurred at some properties as a land restoration strategy, a food crop and in the long term for harvest. Oil valued at per is produced at Mount Romance in Albany, Western Australia. The area of commercial plantations has risen from to between 2000 and 2006. The export of 2 000 tonnes of sandalwood a year is primarily sourced from wild stands of the remote rangelands and Goldfields region of Western Australia. The harvest of naturally occurring trees is reduced when compared to the industry of the 19th century. Exports of over 50 000 tonnes in the last decade were related to agricultural expansion by increased access and harvesters.WA Gov site's detail According to the research and development corporation AgriFutures Australia in 2020, the WA sandalwood industry provides about 40 per cent of the international sandalwood oil market. Since 2017, for the first time Aboriginal Australians have been involved in the production of the oil. The Dutjahn Custodians, representing the wider Martu community, who are connected to the land in the Gibson Desert where sandalwood is harvested, co- manage the company along with Kutkabbuba Aboriginal Corporation and the founders of WA Sandalwood Plantations. The harvesters stay at the tiny Mungilli outstation, built in the early 1980s by Muntiljarra people. The company has a distillery in Kalgoorlie and markets the oil to some of the biggest names in the industry, such as Estee Lauder.  Cultivation  Germination is difficult, and may depend on the El Ni√±o cycle. Success has been reported by placing the kernels in moist vermiculite in sealed plastic bags at room temperature. Once germinated, seeds should be planted next to a (preferably Australian native) seedling, and watered adequately. The main host species is Acacia acuminata, which is used in plantations, which sustains a 15- to 30-year, long-term host species in loamy sands over clay duplex soils. Rock sheaok Allocasuarina huegeliana, wodjil Acacia resinimarginea, and mulga Acacia aneura are also used.Sandalwood Guide for Farmers states \\"being a root hemi-parasitic tree. it is planted with a nitrogen-fixing host species such as Acacia acuminata\\" Composition of oils The oils produced by the tree contain a great complexity of chemicals, many of which have antimicrobial qualities, and contains ximenynic acid.Separation and identification of ximenynic acid isomers in the seed oil of Santalum spicatum R.Br. as their 4,4-dimethyloxazoline derivatives.

The earliest recorded use of the term \\"Chan school\\" is from his Extensive Records. Master Ma's teaching style of \\"strange words and extraordinary actions\\" became paradigmatic Zen lore. Biography His family name was Ma ‚Äì Mazu meaning Ancestor Ma or Master Ma. He was born in 709 northwest of Chengdu in Sichuan. During his years as master, Mazu lived in Jiangxi, from which he took the name \\"Jiangxi Daoyi\\". In the Transmission of the Lamp, compiled in 1004, Mazu is described as follows: According to the Transmission of the Lamp, Mazu was a student of Nanyue Huairang (677-744) at Mount Heng in Hunan A story in the entry on Nanyue Huairang in the Transmission of the Lamp is regarded as Mazu's enlightenment- account, though the text does not claim it as such. An earlier and more primitive version of this story appears in the Anthology of the Patriarchal Hall which was transcribed in 952: This story echoes the Vimalakirti Sutra and the Platform Sutra in downgrading purificative and gradualist practices instead of direct insight into the Buddha-nature. Mazu's Hongzhou school Mazu became Nanyue Huairang's dharma-successor. Eventually Mazu settled at Kung-kung Mountain by Nankang, southern Kiangsi province, where he founded a monastery and gathered scores of disciples. Traditionally, Mazu Daoyi is depicted as a successor in the lineage of Huineng, since his teacher Nanyue Huairang is regarded as a student and successor of Huineng. This connection between Huineng and Nanyue Huairang is doubtful, being the product of later rewritings of Chan history to place Mazu Daoyi in the traditional lineages. Mazu Daoyi is perhaps the most influential teaching master in the formation of Chan Buddhism. While Chan became the dominant school of Buddhism during the Song dynasty, the earlier Tang dynasty and Mazu Daoyi's Hongzhou school became regarded as the \\"golden age\\" of Chan. The An Lushan Rebellion (755-763) led to a loss of control by the Tang dynasty, and metropolitan Chan began to lose its status while \\"other schools were arising in outlying areas controlled by warlords. These are the forerunners of the Chan we know today. Their origins are obscure; the power of Shen-hui's preaching is shown by the fact that they all trace themselves to Hui-neng.\\" This school developed \\"shock techniques such as shouting, beating, and using irrational retorts to startle their students into realization\\". These shock techniques became part of the traditional and still popular image of Chan masters displaying irrational and strange behaviour to aid their students. Part of this image was due to later misinterpretations and translation errors, such as the loud belly shout known as katsu. In Chinese \\"katsu\\" means \\"to shout\\", which has traditionally been translated as \\"yelled 'katsu'\\" ‚Äì which should mean \\"yelled a yell\\"See James D. Sellmann & Hans Julius Schneider (2003), Liberating Language in Linji and Wittgenstein. Asian Philosophy, Vol. 13, Nos. 2/3, 2003. Notes 26 and 41 During 845-846 staunchly Taoist Emperor Wuzong of Tang persecuted Buddhist schools in China alongside with other dissidents, such as Christians: This persecution was devastating for metropolitan Chan, but the school of Mazu and his likes survived, and took a leading role in the Chan of the later Tang. Teachings Mazu Daoyi's teachings and dialogues were collected and published in his Jiangxi Daoyi Chanshi Yulu \\"Oral Records of Chan Master Daoyi from Jiangxi\\". Buddha Nature Though regarded as an unconventional teacher, Mazu's teachings emphasise Buddha-nature: Shock techniques Mazu Daoyi, in order to shake his students out of routine consciousness, employed novel and unconventional teaching methods. Mazu is credited with the innovations of using katsu (sudden shouts), keisaku (unexpected strikes with a stick) and unexpectedly calling to a person by name as that person is leaving. This last is said to summon original consciousness, from which enlightenment arises. Mazu also employed silent gestures, non-responsive answers to questions, and was known to grab and twist the nose of a disciple. Utilizing this variety of unexpected shocks, his teaching methods challenged both habit and vanity, a push that might inspire sudden kensho. Subitism and dhyana (zazen) A well-known story depicts Mazu practicing zazen but being rebuked by his teacher, Nanyue Huairang, comparing seated meditation with polishing a tile. According to Faure (Scholar), the criticism is not about dhyana as such, but \\"the idea of \\"becoming a Buddha\\" by means of any practice, lowered to the standing of a \\"means\\" to achieve an \\"end\\"\\". The criticism of seated dhyana reflects a change in the role and position of monks in Tang society, who \\"undertook only pious works, reciting sacred texts and remaining seated in dhyana\\". Nevertheless, seated dhyana remained an important part of the Chan tradition, also due to the influence of Guifeng Zongmi, who tried to balance dhyana and insight. \\"How can you rest if the one that comes as the vanguard and leaves as the rearguard isn‚Äôt dead?\\", Dahui Zonggao. Use of koansAppearances= Mazu appears in early Chan anthologies of lineage, encounter dialogue and koans: * Transmission of the Lamp, compiled in 1004 by Shi Daoyuan () * Blue Cliff Record. compiled with commentary by Yuanwu Keqin (1063‚Äì1135) circa 1125; * The Gateless Gate compiled circa 1228 by Wumen Huikai (1183‚Äì1260). Other anthologies where Mazu appears include: * Records of Pointing at the Moon (compiled 1602), * Recorded Saying of the Ancient Worthies (compiled 1271), * Records of the Regular Transmission of the Dharma (1062). =Examples= Mazu was particularly fond of using the k≈çan \\"What the mind is, what the Buddha is.\\" In the particular case of Damei Fachang, hearing this brought about an awakening. Later this same statement was contradicted by Mazu when he taught the kung'an \\"No mind, No Buddha\\".: Other examples of k≈çans in which Mazu figures are as follows: Successors Among Mazu's immediate students were Baizhang Huaihai (720-814) Nanquan Puyuan (748-835), and Damei Fachang (752-839). A generation later his lineage through Baizhang came to include Huangbo Xiyun (d.850), and his celebrated successor Linji Yixuan (d.866). From Linji Yixuan derived the Linji school and the Japanese sect, the Rinzai school. A second line was Guishan Lingyou (771-853), to whom the Guiyang school was named, and therein Yangshan Huiji (807-883). Criticism The Hung-chou school has been criticised for its radical subitism. Guifeng Zongmi (Âú≠Â≥∞ ÂÆóÂØÜ) (780‚Äì841), an influential teacher-scholar and patriarch of both the Ch√°n and the Huayan school claimed that the Hung-chou tradition believed \\"everything as altogether true\\". According to Zongmi, the Hung-chou school teaching led to a radical nondualism that believed that all actions, good or bad, are expressing the essential Buddha-nature, but therefore denies the need for spiritual cultivation and moral discipline. This was a dangerously antinomian view as it eliminated all moral distinctions and validated any actions as expressions of the essence of Buddha-nature. While Zongmi acknowledged that the essence of Buddha-nature and its functioning in the day-to-day reality are but different aspects of the same reality, he insisted that there is a difference. To avoid the dualism he saw in the Northern Line and the radical nondualism and antinomianism of the Hung-chou school, Zongmi‚Äôs paradigm preserved \\"an ethically critical duality within a larger ontological unity\\", an ontology which he claimed was lacking in Hung- chou Chan.

He was the father of artist Ronald Ossory Dunlop.  Life and work = Childhood, education, marriage and children  Dunlop was born on 28 December 1868 in Kilmarnock as the only child of Alexander Dunlop and Catherine Nicol (1847‚Äì1873). His father was an architect and a Quaker preacher. He lost his mother at the age of five and was brought up by his grandfather on the Isle of Arran, where he learnt the trade of fishing. After his grandfather died in turn, he returned to his father in Kilmarnock once again, attending the local school. On completing his schooling, he did an apprenticeship with an engineering company in Ardrossan, Ayrshire in western Scotland. After some differences of opinion with his father, he left home in 1886, taking a job in a bicycle shop in Glasgow. He moved to Dublin 1889, working for a tea and wine merchant, where he befriended the poets √Ü (George William Russell) and William Butler Yeats, and became active in the Irish Theosophical Society. He was also known to James Joyce, who mentioned him in Ulysses. In 1891 he married Eleanor Fitzpatrick (ca. 1867‚Äì1932); becoming the father of three children, Ronald Ossory Dunlop, a well-known painter, and daughters Edith, the mother of the sociologist Michael Young, Baron Young of Dartington, and Aileen.  In business  Dunlop moved to America, and in 1896 was employed by the American Westinghouse Electric Company, becoming later assistant manager, and then manager of its European Publicity Department. In 1899 he returned to Britain with his family in this capacity. In 1911, with Sebastian Ziani de Ferranti and others, Dunlop helped to found the British Electrical and Allied Manufacturers' Association (BEAMA) in London, which still exists today. While Ferranti became its first chairman (to 1913) Dunlop was at first its secretary and later its director.J. F. Wilson, Ferranti and the British Electrical Industry, 1864‚Äì1930. Manchester University Press, 1988.History of BEAMA 1911: A year or two after World War I, Dunlop began to organise the World Power Conference, the precursor to the World Energy Council, which met for the first time on 11 July 1924 and of which he was elected chairman.WEC's History: Towards the close of his life he was elected independent chairman of the Electrical Fair Trading Council and chairman of the executive council of the World Power Conference.  His work for Theosophy  Shortly after leaving home for Glasgow in 1886, Dunlop began to study works on occultism and philosophy. This was greatly stimulated by his friendship with √Ü and led to their lifelong connection. After moving to Dublin, he became a member of the local lodge of the Theosophical Society. Together with √Ü and Yeats he attended meetings of the Hermetic Society and in 1892 founded the magazine \\"The Irish Theosophist\\", which he edited until his departure from Dublin in 1897 for the United States.Index to The Irish Theosophist 1892‚Äì1897: http://www.austheos.org.au/indices/IRISHT.HTM When the Theosophical Society split in 1895, Dunlop became a member of the Theosophical Society in America, where he at intervals functioned as secretary to its president, Katherine Tingley, At the end of 1899 he resigned from the Theosophical Society in America, or was perhaps, expelled, the documentation being unclear on this point,Index to The Lamp 1894‚Äì1900: http://www.austheos.org.au/indices/LAMP__.HTM and joined the Theosophical Society Adyar in London. He published many articles in the \\"Theosophical Review\\" and \\"The Vahan\\". In 1909 he initiated the Summer Schools, regular international meetings with theosophical lecture cycles and events where participants got to know one another more intimately. In 1910 he founded the Blavatsky Institute in Manchester in the same year, together with Charles Lazenby, the magazine \\"the Path\\".Index to The Path 1910‚Äì1914: http://www.austheos.org.au/indices/PATHUK.HTM He also founded his own theosophical lodge under the auspices of the Theosophical Society with the name \\"Light on the Path\\" and became its president.  Meeting with Anthroposophy  Dunlop saw Rudolf Steiner for the first time while the latter was still General Secretary of the German Section of the Theosophical Society. He did not, however, join the Anthroposophical Society until 1920, at which time he called into being the anthroposophical \\"Human Freedom Group\\", which he led. Here once again, he introduced the idea of, this time, anthroposophical Summer Schools that were realised in 1923 and again in 1924. After personally meeting with Rudolf Steiner, both of them expressed their intimate spiritual connection and respect for one another. In 1928 he organised the first and only World Conference on Anthroposophy and in 1929 he was elected General Secretary of the Anthroposophical Society in Great Britain. He was on terms of intimate friendship with Eleanor Merry (1873‚Äì1956), who supported his work, especially after the death of his own wife, Eleanor in 1932. As a result of conflicts and power struggles within the General Anthroposophical Society, leading to its splintering in April 1935, Dunlop was expelled together with a number of other leading members.Rudolf Steiner in Britain by Crispian Villeneuve.

His sister Fanny Mendelssohn and other composers also wrote pieces in the same genre. Music The eight volumes of Songs Without Words, each consisting of six songs (), were written at various points throughout Mendelssohn's life, and were published separately. The piano became increasingly popular in Europe during the early nineteenth century, when it became a standard item in many middle-class households. The pieces are within the grasp of pianists of various abilities and this undoubtedly contributed to their popularity. This great popularity has caused many critics to under-rate their musical value. The first volume was published by Novello in London (1832) as Original Melodies for the Pianoforte, but the later volumes used the title Songs Without Words. The works were part of the Romantic tradition of writing short lyrical pieces for the piano, although the specific concept of \\"Songs Without Words\\" was new. Mendelssohn's sister Fanny wrote a number of similar pieces (though not so entitled) and, according to some music historians, she may have helped inspire the concept. The title Song Without Words seems to have been Felix Mendelssohn's own invention. In 1828, Fanny wrote in a letter \\"My birthday was celebrated very nicely ... Felix has given me a 'song without words' for my album (he has lately written several beautiful ones).\\"Andrew Porter, Liner notes from Walter Gieseking recording, Angel 35428 Mendelssohn himself resisted attempts to interpret the songs too literally, and objected when his friend Marc-Andr√© Souchay sought to put words to them to make them literal songs: > What the music I love expresses to me, is not thought too indefinite to put > into words, but on the contrary, too definite. (Mendelssohn's own > italics)Mendelssohn, (1864): letter to Marc-Andr√© Souchay of 15 October 1842 > (pp. 271‚Äì272) Mendelssohn also wrote other Songs Without Words not collected in volumes, and published only in recent years. Furthermore, original drafts exist for many of the 'Songs' many of which differ quite substantially from the eventually published versions.Some of these have now been published in the Urtext edition of K√∂nemann Music () In 2008, the Italian pianist Roberto Prosseda recorded a collection of Mendelssohn's Songs Without Words for Decca Records totalling 56 , some of them never recorded before.

Vial, started to play it in Paris on 9 April 1835Grove's Dictionary of Music and Musicians, 5th ed, 1954, Vol. V, p. 286, Franz Liszt: Catalogue of Works but Liszt became ill during the performance. Ferruccio Busoni planned to play it in London with Egon Petri, but died before the plan could be realised. It was finally first performed in full by Richard and John Contiguglia at the 1984 Holland Liszt Festival in Utrecht.Richard and John Contiguglia, Duo-Pianists There are also examples of recordings of transcriptions, for solo instrument and piano accompaniment, of Mendelssohn written for the voice, which have been entitled \\"Songs Without Words\\", for instance by Mischa Maisky. No such arrangements were however made, or so titled, by Mendelssohn himself. By other composers Fanny Mendelssohn's early collections of piano works opp. 2,6, and 8 are titled Lieder f√ºr das Pianoforte (Songs for the piano). Other composers who were inspired to produce similar sets of pieces of their own included Charles-Valentin Alkan (the five sets of Chants, each ending with a barcarolle), Anton Rubinstein, Ignaz Moscheles and Edvard Grieg (his 66 Lyric Pieces). Two Songs Without Words (Op. 10) for piano were also written by Mykola Lysenko. Both Alkan and Rubinstein frequently included items from Mendelssohn's Songs in their recitals. Ferruccio Busoni, who considered Mendelssohn \\"a master of undisputed greatness\\", turned to the Songs Without Words in the last year of his life for a projected series of recitals in London.

The museum displays the Thermopolis Specimen of Archaeopteryx, which is the only real specimen of this genus on display outside of Europe. Fifteen minutes from the museum are their many dig sites. Located on the Warm Springs Ranch, more than 10,000 bones have been discovered and excavated, most of which are either on display or stored just down the hill at the museum. One of the most notable fossil assemblies on the property is from the \\"Something Interesting\\" or SI excavation site. This site presents the rare occurrence of both dinosaur trace fossils and body fossils including footprints of many Sauropods and Allosaurus as well as skeletal remains from Camarasaurus, Diplodocus, and Apatosaurus - three of the sauropods most common in the area during the Late Jurassic. Most of the bones belong to a juvenile (30 foot long) Camarasaurus that was scavenged by many Allosaurs. This is known based on the presence of both teeth and claw marks on many of the bones present as well as an abundance of shed Allosaur teeth (more than 100) found among the bone debris. Research conducted by Debra Jennings back in 2006, determined that the bones were accumulated in the past when the site was part of a shallow alkaline lake. There are in fact at least two separate layers of bone bearing material created as the lake expanded and shrank with changes in the environment over time.(). VOA report about the museum  Dig Sites  Other dig sites include \\"Foot Site\\" or FS, which contains parts of at least three juvenile diplodocid with articulated hands and feet, \\"There You Are\\" or TYA, which contains the remains of multiple Allosaurs and has not been worked on over the past few years due to the discovery of a site called \\"Above There You Are\\" or ATYA, which contains the remains of what currently appears to be a single very young Diplodocid. One of the oldest sites on the property is called \\"Beside Sauropod\\" or BS, which has been active for over 20 years and produced over 1800 bones to date. Included at the site are at least 6 Camarasaurs and a partial Apatosaur as well as dozens of shed Allosaur teeth. There are many more inactive sites found around the property including \\"Don't Fall,\\" \\"Bone Bed,\\" \\"Above Bone Bed,\\" \\"West to Beside Sauropod,\\" \\"Laura's Apatosaur,\\" and \\"Cheryl's Blind\\" just to name a few. Out of all the dig sites discovered, the main concentration of bones belongs to one of the four following genera: Apatosaurus, Camarasaurus, Diplodocus or Allosaurus. During the winter, the excavation sites are closed to visitors, but over the summer months (late-May to mid-September) active digging occurs every day (weather permitting).  Collections and Exhibits  The museum is open all year round and hosts a gallery with more than 50 mounted skeletons, including a full mount of Supersaurus vivianae excavated from a quarry near Douglas, Wyoming. The replica skeleton on display is 106 feet long and is the first mount based on data from the second and most complete Supersaurus ever found affectionately named \\"Jimbo\\" (WDC DMJ-001) which was donated to the museum in 2003. Other dinosaurs present include a T rex, Triceratops, Medusaceratops as well as various Hadrosaurs, Stegosaurs and Allosaurs. One of the newest members to the museum is the almost 90% complete, composite skeleton of a Camarasaurus found on the property by staff and visitors, excavated over the past 20 years. There is also a collection of real and replica marine reptiles, and flying reptiles. From these times before and after the dinosaurs, the museum hosts an impressive display of pre-Mesozoic fossils, including numerous Devonian fish and invertebrates. The more modern displays include fossil camels, horses, rodents and nimravids (sabretooth cat like animals). The museum also houses a fully functional preparation lab, where staff and visitors can be seen cleaning, repairing and preserving fossils found on the property as well as from other locations around the country, all year long.  Programs  The Wyoming Dinosaur Center offers many programs that allow visitors to dig up dinosaurs. Starting end of May (depending on the weather) the Dig for the Day program starts. This program is for families and individuals that are interested in learning more about paleontology. The Dig for the Day begins at 8am and finishes at 5pm. All fossils found remain at the museum for science and research. Throughout the summer, many dates are available for the Kids' Dig. Children ages 8 to 12 learn all aspect of what The Wyoming Dinosaur Center does. They dig, work in the prep lab removing matrix from dinosaur bones and they learn molding and casting. Other programs include Dinosaur Academy, Senior Activities and Paleo Prep program.

The university offers 61 bachelor- degree specialties and teaches 18 foreign languages. In 2014, it boasted 20189 undergraduate students and 2818 postgraduate and doctoral students, and over 12000 students of continuing education and overseas students. The school has a state-level key discipline and seven province-level key disciplines. The state-level key discipline of Foreign Language and Literature is given priority in the third-phase development of Guangdong province's Project 211 (the provincial government's plan to build up 11 key universities, which is an extended version of the Chinese government's Project 211‚Äì in the 21st century, the government is to build up 100 top universities and 100 key disciplines). The school has established ties with international organizations and academic agencies. As South China's first university that signed a cooperation memorandum with the United Nations, it is one of the world's 21 universities qualified to supply interpreters and translators to the international organization. It is also the only university of foreign languages in China that is included in Campus Asia. History of the University In March 1964, the Central South Bureau of the Central Government, and the Party Committee and the People's Government of Guangdong Province decided to set up a foreign languages institute to train competent graduates to meet the demands of the increasing international exchanges. In November 1964, with the sanction of the Central Government, Guangzhou Foreign Languages Institute was established. In July 1965, it began to enroll 4-year bachelor's degree students and offered 4 specialties ‚Äì English, German, French, and Spanish. It was located at the old site of Guangdong Petroleum School in the Northeast suburbs of Guangzhou. Since January 1966, Guangzhou Foreign Languages Institute had been operating under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Higher Education of the Central People's Government. In October 1969, in accordance with the CPC Central Committee's Notice to Transfer the Institutions of Higher Education to the Revolutionary Committees, the institute was delegated to Guangdong Province's Cultural Revolutionary Committee. In October 1970, Guangdong Provincial Revolutionary Committee restructured the institutions of higher education in Guangdong Province. As a result, Sun Yat-sen University Foreign Languages Department, Jinan University Foreign Languages and Foreign Trade Department, and Guanghzou Foreign Languages School were merged into Guangzhou Foreign Languages Institute. In the meantime, the institute was renamed as Guangdong Foreign Languages Institute and was then moved to the old site of Central South Forestry Institute in the Northern Suburbs of Guangzhou. In November 1977, the school resumed the name of Guangzhou Foreign Languages Institute and again operated directly under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Education. In December 1980, with the approval of the State Council, Guangzhou Foreign Trade Institute was established in the northern suburbs of Guangzhou. The institute evolved from Guangdong Provincial Foreign Trade Cadres School, which was founded in 1957 and operated directly under the jurisdiction of Guangdong Provincial Foreign Trade Bureau. In 1960, on the basis of Guangdong Provincial Foreign Trade Cadres School, Guangdong Foreign Trade School was founded and began to matriculate excellent students from middle schools, who were required to fulfill five years studies. In 1961, Guangdong Provincial Foreign Trade School became attached to Guangdong Provincial Finance and Trade Cadres School. During the Cultural Revolution (1966-1976), Guangdong Provincial Foreign Trade School was suspended for a time and re-opened in 1973. In accordance with the decision by Guangdong provincial government, Guangzhou Foreign Languages Institute Foreign Trade Department was incorporated into Guangdong Provincial Foreign Trade School, which began to enroll three-year college students in 1978. Later, the newly founded Guangzhou Foreign Trade Institute offered foreign trade economy, foreign trade accounting, and other specialties, and the students enrolled were required to fulfill four years schooling. The institute operated under the joint jurisdiction of the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Guangdong provincial government, with the former playing the dominant role. In September 1994, Guangzhou Foreign Trade Institute was delegated to the jurisdiction of the People's Government of Guangdong Province by the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation. In January 1995, Guangzhou Foreign Languages Institute was transferred to Guangdong province by the State Education Commission. In May 1995, the two institutes merged. As a result, Guagndong University of Foreign Studies came into being. In 2003, with the approval of the People's Government of Guangdong Province, Guangdong University of Foreign Studies joined the University Town program and officially started the construction of South Campus. In September 2004, the campus came into use and received its first batch of university students. In October 2008, according to the decision by the People's Government of Guangdong Province, Guangdong Vocational College of Finance and Economics, which was established in April 1996, had been named Guangdong College of Finance and Tax Administration from April 1996 to July 2001 and was incorporated into Guangdong University of Foreign Studies.

Controversies and Incidents = Punishment for the Gay Teacher Who Publicly Came Out In Support of Qiu Bai  In August 2015, Qiu Bai, a student at Sun Yat-sen University in Guangdong Province, People's Republic of China, took the Ministry of Education to court for pathologizing and stigmatizing homosexuality in a large number of teaching materials. After the case was filed, she was severely hindered by the school administration - the staff informed her family of her sexual orientation and she was taken to the hospital by her family for examination. Qiu Bai's ordeal sparked outrage from the LGBT community, but few teachers within the system have publicly expressed support for her. Cui Le, who was a teacher at the Guangdong University of Foreign Studies, came out as a gay teacher and wrote an article in the media in solidarity with Qiu Bai. Soon, various school departments began to investigate him, and staff from the Office of Academic Affairs began to come to Cui's classroom to listen and ask his students about the content he taught in his lessons. Cui then asked the staff of the school about the specific rules he had broken, and the response was, \\"By way of analogy, people say you have committed a crime, what more do you want with the law?\\" He was approached by the two vice presidents responsible for supervising the teaching content: \\"Homosexuality, a highly sensitive topic that most people do not accept, is never allowed in the classroom, and the university is very adamant about this attitude\\"; \\"undergraduates have limited acceptance and cannot 'indoctrinate' students with controversial things\\". The vice-principal criticized, \\"You are a teacher of Guangdong University of Foreign Studies, you can't say these things in public\\"; \\"It's not easy for our school to have today's reputation, all the teachers at our school have the obligation to maintain its honour. If you talk about homosexuality in class, others will think that our school is in a mess\\"; \\"A good bottle of wine, as long as contaminated by a little bit of rat's shit, would not be good anymore\\". Cui was asked to write a pledge that he would no longer talk about gay issues in the classroom, that he would no longer have dealings and collaborations with NGOs, and that he would no longer make gender-related comments on the internet and in the media as a teacher at Guangdong University of Foreign Studies. Afterwards, the school publicly released the disciplinary document \\"Decision on the Sanction for Giving Cui Le Serious Teaching Accident (Grade II)\\" on the grounds that Cui Le had invited scholars and publicists from outside the school to give four lectures on sex and gender issues in two classes of \\"Sociolinguistics\\" and \\"Chinese Vocabulary\\" in October and November 2015, and the charges included \\"not approved by the school\\", \\"the content of the lecture is not related to the main syllabus\\", \\"causing adverse effects\\", and disqualified him from being evaluated for merit that year, plus a fine of one-month allowance. In addition, the red-headed document will enter the teacher's personnel file, creating an uncertain risk for his future movement among colleges and universities within the Chinese system. In April 2016, six months after Cui Le was disciplined, the school issued a document titled \\"Notice on Regulating the Invitation of External Experts to Hold Lectures,\\" but the school had no relevant approval regulations at the time Cui Le held the lectures. In terms of teaching, the Vice-Principal re-emphasized that \\"the content of teaching must lead to a positive outlook on life and be in line with the mainstream of China\\" and that \\"some Western ideas are not appropriate in China, which has its own characteristics\\". The Vice-Chancellors also cited the incident Occupy Central in Hong Kong and the \\"Lessons from the Disintegration of the Soviet Union\\" as examples to illustrate the complexity of the political environment and to alert them to the \\"infiltration\\" of NGOs and to enhance their \\"political sensitivity\\". \\"The infiltration of NGOs is silent\\"; \\"Once the traditional ideas are liberalized, they can't be held back\\"; \\"You supported Qiu Bai at Sun Yat-sen University, but what do you know about her background? You're young and there are a lot of things you can't see clearly.\\" Cui was asked to continue to strengthen his self-reflection: \\"What do you think of this disciplinary action by the school? Do you really accept it by heart? From the material you have written, your understanding is not yet in place and is tinged with resistance. The school is not trying to restrict you by doing this, it is for your own good. That's something I hope you have the height of awareness to think about.\\" On May 17, 2020, the same day as The International Day Against Homophobia, Transphobia and Biphobia, Cui Le released the article \\"After coming out: a homosexual teacher disciplined\\", detailing his experience of being investigated, reprimanded, disciplined by the school authorities as a homosexual teacher who came out publicly and taught gender issues in class when teaching at the Guangdong University of Foreign Studies four years ago. The article was subsequently deleted across China's internet inside the Great Fire Wall.  Lesbian students denied diploma  In 2016, lesbian student Yang Huang proposed to her girlfriend Xiaoyu Wang at the university's graduation ceremony. The university repeatedly told Xiaoyu Wang that she would not receive her diploma because of this incident. Later, LGBT organization ALL OUT initiated a petition letter to demand apology, which collected about 75,000 signatures supporting the lesbian students.  International Cooperation = A Survey of the Cooperation and Exchange  The school has carried out extensive international cooperation and exchanges with universities across the world. By December 2014, it has formed close ties with 268 universities and academic research institutes from more than 40 countries and regions, such as the United States, Britain, France, Germany, Spain, Italy, Canada, Australia, Japan, Russia, Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand, Vietnam, Korea, Chile, Cuba, Mexico and Hong Kong, Macao, Taiwan, and the like. In 2014, it received 2562 overseas students from 116 countries and regions. Of all the university graduates each year, 18% of them once studied abroad. The school has carried out collaborative research with Lancaster University, the World Bank, the European Union, and other universities and international research institutes. Cooperation with France During several years, the university was the unique provider of foreign students for French university. It was clearly the ambition of French General Consulate in Guangzhou to strengthen cooperation and ties between that university and French ones. The Alliance Fran√ßaise depended in fact a lot from Guanwai. In 2009, the university was not anymore a support for the Alliance Francaise. Thanks to the effort from Mauve S√©bastien and Philippe Bourdon, a lot of conferences were clearly emphasized the importance of French expect in different topics: the forum of European study with Prof Bossuat, from Cergy Pontoise University, and Mr Poisson from the University of Montpellier.

While the document states that it was written so \\"that all doubt may be removed regarding a matter of great importance\\", it has been contested by some Catholics, as to both the substance and in the authoritative nature of its teaching. Content Citing an earlier Vatican document, Inter insigniores, \\"on the question of the Admission of women to the Ministerial Priesthood\\", issued by the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith in October 1976, Pope John Paul explains the official Roman Catholic understanding that the priesthood is a special role specially set out by Jesus when he chose twelve men out of his group of male and female followers. Pope John Paul notes that Jesus chose the Twelvecf. Mk 3:13-14; Jn 6:70 after a night in prayer (cf. Lk 6:12) and that the Apostles themselves were careful in the choice of their successors. The priesthood is \\"specifically and intimately associated in the mission of the Incarnate Word himself.\\"cf. Mt 10:1, 7-8; 28:16-20; Mk 3:13-16; 16:14-15 The letter concludes with the words: Magisterial weight The phrase \\"definitively held by all the Church's faithful\\" pertains to the full assent of faith that is given to the dogmas of the Catholic Church. Nevertheless, multiple theologians argue\\"The weight to be given to recent Vatican documents regarding the ordination of women\\", in: Proceedings of the Annual Conference of the Canon Law Society of Great Britain and Ireland, 1997 that Ordinatio sacerdotalis was not issued under the extraordinary papal magisterium as an ex cathedra statement, and so is not considered infallible in itself. The Catholic Theological Society of America issued a report in 1997, approved by 216 out of 248 of its voting members, stating that \\"There are serious doubts regarding the nature of the authority of this teaching and grounds in Tradition.\\"https://web.archive.org/web/20090602184620/http://www.womenpriests.org/teaching/ctsa.asp Some consider its contents infallible under the ordinary magisterium, saying this doctrine has been held consistently by the Church. In a responsum ad dubium (reply to a doubt) explicitly approved by Pope John Paul II and dated October 1995, the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith replied that the teaching of Ordinatio sacerdotalis had been \\"set forth infallibly by the ordinary and universal Magisterium\\" and accordingly was \\"to be held definitively, as belonging to the deposit of faith\\".http://www.ourladyswarriors.org/teach/ordisace2.htm CDF's Reply to a Doubt, approved by Pope John Paul II, in which the Congregation affirms that the doctrine of Ordinatio sacerdotalis has been set forth infalliblyhttp://www.ourladyswarriors.org/teach/ordisace3.htm Letter of the Prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger, on the CDF's Reply affirming the infallible character of the teaching contained in the Apostolic Letter Ordinatio sacerdotalis In 1998, the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith issued another opinion, a Doctrinal Commentary on Ad tuendam fidem,\\"DOCTRINAL COMMENTARY ON THE CONCLUDING FORMULA OF THE PROFESSIO FIDEI\\", Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith. Originally published in L'Osservatore Romano: Weekly Edition in English, 15 July 1998, 3-4. Accessed 28 January, 2014 which said that the teaching of Ordinatio sacerdotalis was not taught as being divinely revealed _explicitly_ , although it might someday be so taught in the future, that is to say, it has not been determined whether the doctrine is \\"to be considered an intrinsic part of revelation or only a logical consequence\\", yet in either case it is certainly definitive and to be believed infallibly.

Plunkett entered Trinity College, Dublin, in November 1819 (graduating B.A. in 1824) and was called to the Irish bar in 1826 and later to the English bar. He practised as a barrister on the Connaught circuit in 1826‚Äì32 with distinction, fought for Catholic Emancipation, and was given credit by Daniel O'Connell for the success of the Whig candidates in Connaught at the general election in 1830. Legal career in Australia In 1831 Plunkett was appointed Solicitor-General of New South Wales on a salary of ¬£800. Plunkett, his wife, sister and four female servants arrived in Sydney on the Southworth in June 1832. The attorney-general at the time, John Kinchela, was deaf and Plunkett had to undertake most of his duties. In February 1836 Kinchela retired from his position, Plunkett took his place. Later in 1836 Plunkett was associated with Governor Richard Bourke in bringing about a new church and schools act. He was determined to establish equality before the law, first by extending jury rights to emancipists and he then extended legal protections to convicts and assigned servants. Finally Plunkett attempted to legally protect aboriginals, and twice charged the perpetrators of the Myall Creek massacre with murder. The first trial resulted in acquittal on a technical point; however the second resulted in a conviction. Plunkett's Church Building Act 1836,. disestablished the Church of England and established legal equality between Anglicans, Catholics, Presbyterians and later Methodists. Plunkett obtained leave of absence to attend to family matters in Ireland from late 1841, and did not return to Sydney until August 1843. Following the death of Chief Justice Sir James Dowling in September 1844, Plunkett asserted that he should be offered the vacant position as a right of his position as Attorney-General. The Executive Council rejected his claimed right to the position, and Supreme Court judge Alfred Stephen was appointed. Plunkett was offered appointment as a judge, filling the position vacated by Stephen but declined it. He was made a member of the Executive Council in March 1847, and in 1848, when the national school system was founded, was appointed Chairman of the Board of Education. He retired as Attorney-General in 1856, receiving a pension of ¬£1,200 a year. He was appointed a Queen's Counsel on 6 June 1856, the first NSW Barrister to be so appointed. Parliamentary career In the same year he was elected as the member for both Bathurst (County) and Argyle in the Legislative Assembly at the first election under the new constitution. Plunkett was sworn in as member for Argyle and Bathurst on 22 May 1856, before submitting his resignation from Bathurst on 29 May, stating that the rules of the House would not allow him to send in his resignation earlier. Plunkett resigned from the Assembly in January 1857, was nominated to the Legislative Council, and elected its President. In February 1858, on account of the Board of Education having issued regulations which Charles Cowper, then Premier, disapproved of, Plunkett was dismissed from his position as chairman and he thereupon resigned from the council. There was much public sympathy with Plunkett, and the government offered to reinstate him if he would withdraw statements he had made in letters which were considered offensive. Plunkett declined to do so. Plunkett was again a member of the Legislative Assembly for Cumberland (North Riding) from September 1858 to April 1859 and for West Sydney from June 1859 to November 1860. In June 1861 he was nominated to the council, and from October 1863 to February 1865 was Vice-President of the Executive Council in the first James Martin ministry. Plunkett was then reconciled with Cowper, and from August 1865 to January 1866 was Attorney- General in the fourth Cowper ministry. Plunkett was also vice-chancellor of the University of Sydney in 1865‚Äì67. For the last two years of his life he lived much at Melbourne on account of his wife's health, and he made his last public appearance there in 1869 as secretary to the provincial council of the Roman Catholic Church. He died on 9 May 1869 at East Melbourne leaving a widow but no children. Plunkett's remains were taken to Sydney and buried in the old Devonshire Street Cemetery, beside those of Archpriest John Joseph Therry and Archdeacon McEncroe. Plunkett was the author of The Australian Magistrate; a Guide to the Duties of a Justice of the Peace, first published in 1835 and reissued in at least three subsequent editions; The Magistrate's Pocket Book (1859), and On the Evidence of Accomplices (1863). Plunkett was dignified and somewhat austere in manner, though he could relax on occasions such as the annual St Patrick's Day dinner which he chaired. Plunkett had much ability and exercised great influence in the early days of education in New South Wales and in the anti-transportation movement. John Fairfax said he was \\"the greatest friend of civil and religious liberty in the colony\\", and he was in advance of his time in his attitude to the land question, and in his advocacy of manhood suffrage.

London secondary school is a former public high school in Richmond, British Columbia. Due to declining enrollment in both schools, London Secondary school and the neighbouring Steveston Secondary School were merged to form Steveston-London Secondary School (SLSS) in 2008, on the site of the former London Secondary. History The school was named after Charles Edwin London (1860‚Äì1941), a pioneer farmer. It was originally built in 1965 as a primary school, and functioned as such until Maple Lane Elementary School opened in 1974.City of Richmond BC ‚Äì Charles E.

The school was largely rebuilt, with the gymnasium the only part of the structure that was not damaged (thus earning the nickname \\"the old gym\\" after the schools merged in 2007, when the gym was officially named the Legends Gym). In 1995, coinciding with the reopening of the new school, the Richmond School Board amalgamated junior and senior high schools into a single entity. The first graduating class from London was therefore the class of 1997. In the summer of 1995, the school was used as a filming location, specifically the police station, in Dad's Week Off. The renovated London Secondary building was chosen to house the new merged school because it was much more modern than Steveston Secondary School's building. A new wing was added to the building to help accommodate the new, larger student population. The former Steveston Secondary building was demolished over the course of mid-2015 to the summer of 2016, replaced by a new residential development. Historically, the school mascot was a lion, and sports teams were called the \\"Lords\\". However, it was changed to \\"Legends\\" and the mascot changed to a Pegasus in 1995 because \\"Lords\\" was thought to be sexist.

It is on the shore of Bramble Bay, part of Moreton Bay. In the , Shorncliffe had a population of 1,870 people. The suburb attracts visitors to its historic Shorncliffe pier, and Lovers Walk, a walking path along the coastline between Shorncliffe and neighbouring Sandgate.  Geography  Robert Dixon's 1842 Survey of Moreton Bay Shorncliffe is situated in Brisbane's northeastern suburbs on Bramble Bay, part of Moreton Bay. Shorncliffe is bounded to the north, north-east and east by Bramble Bay and to the south-east, south, and south-west by Cabbage Tree Creek (), which enters the bay at Cabbage Tree Point (). The only land boundary is to the neighbouring suburb of Sandgate and all land transport to Shorncliffe must go via Sandgate. Shorncliffe railway station in Railway Avenue () is the terminus of the Shorncliffe railway line (originally known as the Sandgate railway line). History Historical 19th century Shorncliffe pier in 2014 Aboriginal people called the area Warra, meaning an expanse of water. Cabbage Tree Creek appears on Robert Dixon's 1842 survey of Moreton Bay. The town was named Sandgate by James Burnett, an early surveyor in the region after the seaside town of Sandgate in Kent, England. Sandgate in Kent had a military camp, Shorncliffe Army Camp, on top of the cliffs adjacent to it. Burnett named the cliffs Shorncliffe after the camp in Kent, due to the similarity of the cliffs. Historically Shorncliffe was regarded as a neighbourhood within Sandgate (which was initially as the independent Town of Sandgate and, from 1925, as a suburb within the City of Brisbane). On 11 August 1975, Shorncliffe became a separate suburb within the City of Brisbane. The first Shorncliffe pier was built in 1879. It was built by local hotel proprietor William Deagon to attract ferries coming from Brisbane to Sandgate to disembark passengers at Shorncliffe too. It was replaced with a longer pier built from 1883 to 1884, which was further extended to facilitate docking at low tide. Although the last ferry to Shorncliffe was in 1928, it remained a popular with holidaymakers.left In December 1879, allotments in the Town of Sandgate were auctioned by John Cameron. A map advertising the auction shows allotments bordered by Friday, Yundah and Kate Streets, now in Shorncliffe. A map advertising the auction states the land available was subdivisions 1 to 14, of allotments 8, 9, 10 and part of 7, Sec. 3, Town of Sandgate. A Church of England was built in Signal Row on the corner of Yundah Street (), then the centre of the developing town. It was opened and dedicated on Sunday 12 December 1880 by Bishop Matthew Hale. It was a timber church and able to accommodate 150 people. It was designed by architect FDG Stanley and built by contractors Woodward and Betts of Brisbane. In September 1886 it was announced that it would be dedicated to St Nicolas, the patron saint of sailors and sea- farers, a common practice in seaside towns. In 1887 it was enlarged which involved re-orienting the building on the block so the chancel was to the south rather than to the original east. In 1930 the undercroft was enclosed with bricks to form a church wall. The church closed in 1988. The Queensland Government purchased the church and incorporated it into Shorncliffe State School but subsequently demolished it due to extensive termite damage. Its stained glass windows were preserved and are now in St Margaret's Anglican Church at Sandgate. Shorncliffe Infants State School opened on 28 January 1919 in the old court house beside the police station. It catered for children up to 8 years old. In 1928 it became Shorncliffe State School providing a full primary school service. The Sandgate Golf Club commenced in 1921 with the official opening of its 9-hole course on 25 November 1922, having obtained a 21-year lease of the site from the Sandgate Town Council for a nominal rental as the Council believed that the golf course would be of lasting benefit. St Patrick's College opened on 21 January 1952. In March 2012, the Shorncliffe pier was closed for public safety after the discovery of damage done by marine borers and an engineering report revealed the pier could not be saved. The Brisbane City Council demolished it and replaced it with a new pier, designed to be almost identical to the old pier. The new pier opened on 25 March 2016. In the , Shorncliffe had a population of 1,870 people.
