He is best known for the Paddy Pallin chain of outdoors equipment stores he founded. Biography Born in County Durham, England, in 1900, Pallin developed a love for the outdoors while on family picnics and Scout trips to the Yorkshire countryside. After he emigrated to Sydney, Australia, in 1926 he worked initially as a sharefarmer and then as an insurance clerk. He became an original member of the Sydney Bush Walkers Club which was founded in 1927 and then, becoming a victim of the great depression in 1930, he began making lightweight, waterproof outdoor equipment and clothing. His business soon began to pay for itself when people realised bushwalking was a cheap activity and no one else was making high quality bush equipment. Pallin opened a store in George Street during the depression and as his business grew moved to other premises throughout the city. In 1933 Pallin wrote and published the book Bushwalking and Camping which he sold in his stores (the book is still being published today and is in its 14th edition). In 1939 he co-founded, with Marie Byles, The Bush Club, a walking club with a different philosophy to the Sydney Bush Walkers Club. (Both clubs are still active today). Pallin started cross-country skiing in 1954 but he quickly capitalised on the boom for the sport by retailing skiing equipment. This led him to become one of the country's biggest skiing, camping and bushwalking manufacturer and retailer. In 1975 he established the Paddy Pallin Foundation to assist conservation projects and in the same year was awarded an Order of Australia. Pallin was involved in numerous community organisations including: the Youth Hostels Association, the Scout Association and the National Parks Association of NSW. Paddy's autobiography Never Truly Lost is still looked to for inspiration by those interested in getting out into the wilderness. Notable achievements * Was a founding member of the Search and Rescue arm of the Confederation of Bushwalking Clubs NSW in 1936. This was a predecessor of the Police Search and Rescue unit, and is known today as the Bush Search and Rescue New South Wales. * Started the Paddy Pallin outdoor store which still operates to this day. * Helped to establish Pennant Hills Scout Camp. * Started the annual Paddy Pallin Orienteering Competition In 1963. * Established the Paddy Pallin ski classic in 1964. * Was pivotal in the foundation of the River Canoe Club in 1935.

Controversy over congestion fee Tuttle is perhaps most widely known for his (and the U.S. Embassy's) refusal to pay the London congestion charge.Livingstone hits out at US ambassador , Politics.co.uk, March 28, 2006. The embassy has claimed that the charge is a form of taxation, and the diplomats and their staff are therefore exempt under the 1961 Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations. Transport for London, which is headed by the Mayor of London, considers the charge to be a fee for service rather than a tax, and points out that other embassies in London pay it, and US embassies in other cities pay similar road charges. The embassy says that the decision to stop paying was made before Tuttle became Ambassador, although the embassy only ceased payment after he took up the post. In March 2006, the Mayor of London, Ken Livingstone, said that Tuttle was trying to \\"skive out of [paying] like some chiselling little crook\\".British Press Review, BritainUSA.com, March 28, 2006. A survey published in 2007 showed that the United States owed ¬£1.5 million in outstanding congestion charge payments.

Actor Tom Conti, founder of campaign group London Motorists Action Group (LMAG), however, said: \\"I think the American ambassador's stance on this is very reasoned, I think he makes his case very well.

Broderick also pencilled the four-part \\"Batman: Year Three\\" storyline, written by Marv Wolfman, which detailed the first meeting of Batman and Dick Grayson as well as Tim Drake's first appearance. Career=Comics Soon after graduating from high school in Tampa, Florida, Broderick flew to New York in the early 1970s to compete in DC Comics' junior bullpen program, a nationwide art and writing contest held at the July 4 convention at the Commodore Hotel. Presenting his work to DC editors Sol Harrison and Joe Orlando, Broderick was almost immediately placed in the junior bullpen program and drew filler pages and short stories for various 100 Page Super Spectaculars. During this period, Broderick also worked for Neal Adams and Dick Giordano's Continuity Associates as a member of the Crusty Bunkers. In 1975, after sporadic work with DC and Marvel, Broderick joined the team at Atlas Comics. His time at Atlas was short-lived, and Broderick soon found himself back at Marvel, working on various titles for their black-and-white line, Curtis Magazines. This led to working on Captain Marvel and then The Micronauts. He drew the Micronauts series from #19 (July 1980) to #34 (Oct. 1981). Writer J. M. DeMatteis and Broderick created the Creature Commandos in Weird War Tales #93 (November 1980). In 1981, he abruptly left Marvel for DC. As he said in a 2003 interview, \\"Jim Shooter had all but informed me that, in his opinion, my art sucked and that I would never get another raise there, regardless of how well my books were selling. So one quick phone call to DC and I was in.\\" Broderick was one of the artists on the double-sized Justice League of America #200 (March 1982). He and writer Gerry Conway launched The Fury of Firestorm in June 1982.Manning \\"1980s\\" in Dolan, p. 197: \\"Written by Gerry Conway, with art by Pat Broderick, Firestorm continued his carefree adventures in a series that spanned one hundred issues.\\" Broderick briefly drew the Batman feature in Detective Comics in 1985. Captain Atom, a Charlton Comics character purchased by DC, was given an ongoing series in March 1987 which was written by Cary Bates and drawn by Broderick.Manning \\"1980s\\" in Dolan, p. 229: \\"March [1987] debuted the new Captain Atom in his first DC series, by writer Cary Bates and penciler Pat Broderick.\\" Writer Marv Wolfman and Broderick created Tim Drake in the \\"Batman: Year Three\\" story.Manning \\"1980s\\" in Dolan, p. 240: \\"Written by Marv Wolfman and pencilled by Pat Broderick, the four-issue 'Year Three' saga introduced a young boy named Timothy Drake into a flashback sequence starring a young Dick Grayson and his parents.\\" Broderick drew the Swamp Thing series from 1989 to 1990 and then launched the Green Lantern volume 3 series with Gerard Jones.Manning \\"1990s\\" in Dolan, p. 245: \\"Writer Gerard Jones and penciller Pat Broderick jump-started the further adventures of Hal [Jordan] and company by beginning Green Lantern's third ongoing series, which would last an impressive 181 issues.\\" After ten years at DC, Broderick's relationship with that company soured. According to him, he \\"was being abused by [his] editors, Andy Helfer and Kevin Dooley, and was really just fed up with their attitude.\\" Shooter was no longer at Marvel which offered him work again and Broderick returned, where he worked as the regular penciller first on Alpha Flight and Doom 2099.  Advertising  In 1995, Broderick turned to advertising full-time, moving to Dallas to lead the in-house creative department at Tracy Locke and Partnership. The company handled packaging, print, and television ads for PepsiCo, Frito-Lay, Pizza Hut, Federal Express, Harrah's Casinos, and Hasbro. This led to design work for DNA Productions on the 2001 movie, Jimmy Neutron: Boy Genius.  Later career In 2003, Broderick returned to comics with the short-lived Future Comics. He was scheduled to work on the title Peacekeepers, but it was never published, and Future went out of business shortly thereafter. In 2004, Devil's Due Publishing revived Micronauts, with Broderick returning to the title. He drew three issues before it was cancelled. That same year, Broderick was a member of the animation department faculty at Tampa's International Academy of Design and Technology. Broderick was elected an Inkwell Awards Ambassador in January 2018. In August 2018, Broderick was elevated to Special Ambassador status.  Art style  Broderick is known for his detailed, expressive art, and his characters' large eyes. There is some resemblance between Broderick's art and Michael Golden's late 1970s style. Broderick has acknowledged his admiration of Golden's work. Through his career, Broderick has often teamed with inker Bruce Patterson on such titles as Alpha Flight, Green Lantern, Detective Comics, Legion of Super-Heroes, and Captain Planet and the Planeteers.

The website appeared to switch between various offshore hosting locations, and used software designed by Interesting Software Ltd, an Anguilla company. As of April 27, 2007, a US court order has forced e-gold to liquidate a large number of e-gold accounts totalling some 10 to 20 million US dollars' worth of gold. A small part of this seizure was 1mdc's accounts and assets . If the court order in the USA is reversed, a user's e-gold grams remaining in 1mdc will \\"unbail\\" normally to the user's e-gold account. Ultimately e-gold is owned and operated by US citizens, so, 1mdc users must respect the decisions of US courts and the US authorities regarding the disposition of e-gold and the safety and security of US citizens. Even though 1mdc has no connection whatsoever to the USA, and most 1mdc users are non-USA, ultimately e-gold is operated from the USA.  Features  As with any digital gold currency, one used 1mdc to keep assets away from fiat currencies and avoid inflationary risks associated with them. To open an account, 1mdc required the user to have a functioning e-mail address, an e-gold account, a password, initials and a PIN. 1mdc charged 0.05 gold grams per spend for accounts that receive 100 or more spends (total over 500 grams) to their account in any given calendar month. There were no spend fees for accounts that receive 99 or less spends in a calendar month, and no storage fees on all accounts. This was in sharp contrast to e-gold, which charges a storage fee of 1% per annum. Coupled with the quick and easy transfer of funds between e-gold and 1mdc accounts, 1mdc was attractive to persons with large amounts of e-gold, whose balances gradually shrink due to e-gold's storage fees. 1mdc also offered virtually fee free exchange from Pecunix gold to 1mdc, and a 5% fee to exchange from 1mdc to Pecunix gold. It was often said that most or all heavy users of e-gold are 1mdc users, although of course there was no way of confirming this.  Criticisms  1mdc's e-gold was held in unallocated (pooled) storage (in several e-gold user accounts) which allowed for extra privacy from e-gold's administrators. However, this increased storage risk, as the client had no precedence on the e-gold they entrusted 1mdc to hold, and there was virtually no way for a user to ensure that 1mdc is maintaining full reserves of their e-gold. The amount of e-gold held in the 1mdc system was undisclosed. Also, since 1mdc was backed by e-gold, events that affect e-gold also affected 1mdc. Once e-gold Ltd. was instructed by the US government to freeze and liquidate all 1mdc accounts, 1mdc became insolvent by default along with all other e-gold accounts seized in the April 27 action.

The Parana√≠ba River marks the border between the states of Goi√°s and Minas Gerais. The Meia Ponte's basin furnishes water for 2 million people, fifty percent of the population of the state, and a large part of the economy depends on it. The Meia Ponte receives great amounts of garbage, industrial waste, and untreated sewage greatly reducing the quality of its waters. The city of Goi√¢nia dumps over 90% of its untreated sewage into the river. A preliminary evaluation of water quality downstream from Goi√¢nia indicates that the river has a stretch of 60 kilometers below Goi√¢nia with low levels of dissolved oxygen and therefore a limited capacity to sustain aquatic life or provide conditions for agricultural activity. In addition, the dry summers last up to six months, which means that the Meia Ponte cannot supply all the population that depends on its water. Rationing in the summer is common. Recently a project was initiated to try to recover this important river and a sewage treatment plant is under construction in Goi√¢nia.

The H√¥tel de Rambouillet, as it was called, was frequented by renowned pr√©cieuses, writers, nobles and \\"robins\\". One of its habitu√©s, Charles de Sainte-Maure, marquis de Montausier (1610‚Äì1690), had been in love with the daughter of the marquis and marquise de Rambouillet, Julie d'Angennes (1606‚Äì1671), since he first met her in 1631. In the hope of finally wooing her, he decided to give her an extraordinary present. Montausier asked the most talented poets of the time, all frequent visitors of the H√¥tel de Rambouillet, to write one or several madrigals in which a flower would sing the praises of Julie. The final product was the work of nineteen poets. These madrigaux were composed by writers as famous as Georges de Scud√©ry, Desmarets de Saint-Sorlin, Valentin Conrart, Jean Chapelain, Racan, Tallemant des R√©aux, Robert Arnauld d'Andilly, Simon Arnauld de Pomponne, Isaac Arnauld de Corbeville, Montmor, Germain Habert, Colletet, Claude Malleville, Philippe Habert, Antoine Gombaud, Antoine Godeau, , Pierre Corneille for a couple of the madrigals authored by \\"M.

Montausier himself wrote sixteen of the madrigals.Jules Tellier, \\"La Guirlande de Julie\\" Le Parti national, November 27, 1887 Then the text was ornamentally written by the calligraphist Nicolas Jarry and the flower quoted in each poem painted by Nicolas Robert, while the binding was done by Le Gascon. The final object turned out to be one of the most extraordinary manuscripts of the century and one of the highlights of the 17th century litt√©rature galante.

After the death of Montausier in 1690, the manuscript became the possession of the Crussol-d'Uz√®s family, in which his daughter, Marie-Julie de Sainte-Maure (1647-1692), duchesse de Crussol-d'Uz√®s, had married.

Although he lived his life in rural Virginia, he was patriarch of the McCormick family that became influential throughout the world, especially in large cities such as Chicago, Washington, D.C. and New York City. Early life McCormick was born June 8, 1780, on the family estate of Walnut Grove in Rockbridge County, Virginia, in the Shenandoah Valley on the western side of the Blue Ridge Mountains. His parents were Revolutionary War veteran Robert McCormick Sr. and Martha (n√©e Sanderson) McCormick. Robert Jr. had five elder siblings: George, Martha, Elizabeth, William, and James. McCormick's maternal grandparents were Scottish immigrants, George Sanderson and Catharine (n√©e Ross) Sanderson. His paternal grandparents were Thomas (1702‚Äì1762) and Elizabeth (n√©e Carruth) McCormick, Presbyterian immigrants born in County Londonderry and County Antrim, Ireland respectively who married in 1728 and settled in Cumberland County, Pennsylvania in 1735. Career McCormick and his wife Polly raised their eight children on the farm who grew up helping in the shop and the mill. He frequently busied himself with small gadgets and inventions around the farm. By 1809, McCormick had constructed a partially completed reaper. He eventually decided to formalize some of his work when he applied for a patent in 1830 for a \\"hemp-break\\", a device for breaking hemp and flax. He also produced a threshing machine, a clover sheller of stone, a blacksmith's bellows and a hill-side plow. By 1831, he had completed a reaper. He was encouraged by Polly to give it to their assertive and business-minded son Cyrus, who was able to improve and patent it in 1834 and establish the McCormick Harvesting Machine Company which led to the great wealth the family accumulated. Personal life On February 11, 1808, McCormick was married to Mary Ann McChesney \\"Polly\\" Hall (1780‚Äì1853), a daughter of Patrick Hall and Susan (n√©e McChesney) Hall, and was granted ownership of Walnut Grove, the family estate, in 1810. Together, Robert and Polly were the parents of eight children: * Cyrus Hall McCormick (1809‚Äì1884), who moved to Chicago and married Nettie Fowler in 1858. * Robert Hall McCormick (1810‚Äì1826). * Susan Jane McCormick (1813‚Äì1826). * William Sanderson McCormick (1815‚Äì1865), who joined Cyrus in Chicago and married Mary Ann Grigsby in 1848. * Mary Caroline McCormick (1817‚Äì1888), who married Rev.

He died on July 4, 1846. He and his wife were buried in the cemetery of the Old Providence Stone Church just north of the estate.

Its objective was to establish an independent Welsh republic. History=Overview The FWA first appeared in public at a 1965 protest against the construction of the Llyn Celyn reservoir. In 1966 they took part in Irish celebrations of the 50th anniversary of the Easter Rising, marching in Dublin. A 1967 late-night television interview with David Frost brought the group to the attention of a wider audience. The group courted publicity, and its leaders attracted a great deal of media attention with extravagant claims of financial support from millionaires, \\"links with the IRA and Basque separatists,\\" dogs trained to carry explosives, etc. Members wore home-made uniforms and marched in historic sites like Machynlleth, as well as carrying out manoeuvres with small arms and explosives in the Welsh countryside and claiming responsibility for many of Mudiad Amddiffyn Cymru's bombings. They also advocated for families of victims of the Aberfan disaster whose compensation claims were being blocked, \\"marching on their behalf and working behind the scenes for them.\\" Army The group was generally not taken seriously by the media, and one government memo warned against \\"taking the organisation's activities too seriously\\" saying this \\"would give to it an unmerited importance and publicity which its leaders are plainly seeking\\". However, against a backdrop of Welsh nationalist bombings and protests against the investiture of Prince Charles as Prince of Wales the FWA presented an appealing target to the government, and in 1969 nine members were arrested and charged with public order offences. The trial, in Swansea, lasted 53 days, ending on the day of the investiture. On the first day of the trial the defendants were \\"greeted with an impromptu recital of Hen Wlad Fy Nhadau from the public gallery.\\" Almost all of the prosecution's evidence came from journalists who had reported the group's claims. Julian Cayo-Evans, his second-in-command, Dennis Coslett (who refused to speak English throughout the trial), and four other members were convicted; Cayo- Evans and Coslett spent 15 months in jail. The Army's motto was \\"Fe godwn ni eto\\", Welsh for \\"We will rise again\\". Its crest was Eryr Wen, a stylised white eagle mounted on dark green shield, with the flag of Wales at the top left hand corner. The eagle represents the eagle of Snowdonia, which in Welsh mythology is said to protect Wales, mentioned in the poem Mab Darogan. This 13th century poem states; \\"Myrddin's prophecy is that a king shall come with heroism from among the Welsh people. Prophets have said that generous men shall be reborn of the lineage of the eagles of Snowdonia.\\" The modern symbol itself was designed by Harri Webb, a Welsh republican poet who edited The Welsh Republican in the 1950s. The FWA was rumoured to have received arms from the Official IRA (OIRA), although Cayo-Evans later denied this. In Ireland, one rumour‚Äîused against the OIRA by its rivals within Irish Republicanism‚Äîwas that the OIRA had given or sold most of its weapons to the FWA as part of its turn away from political violence, leaving it defenceless when intercommunal violence erupted in Northern Ireland in August 1969. Scott Millar, coauthor of a history of the OIRA, wrote that there was contact between the two groups (including FWA members training in Ireland) but no large-scale transfer of arms took place. In 2005 the Western Mail newspaper published information from The National Archives, asserting that Cayo-Evans had a \\"mental age of 12\\", and that Coslett was \\"unbalanced\\". In 2009 photos of the group's exercises taken by undercover police officers (and introduced as evidence at the 1969 trial) were brought out of storage and put on display in a museum exhibit.

Gold Age was a registered legal corporate entity of Panama. The Gold Age was launched in 1999 and closed down by regulators in 2006. Background Gold Age was used to buy and sell and trade the following digital gold currencies: e-gold, e-Bullion, and 1mdc. Gold Age's fees for exchanging fiat currency into digital gold currency ranged from 4 percent to 1.75 percent, depending on the amount exchanged and if the client was an Inner Circle Member.

U.S. Secret Service raid, March 2001 On March 12, 2001, then Gold Age owner Parker Bradley was detained at his place of business in Syracuse, New York by US Secret Service agents investigating credit card fraud. Bradley claimed he has stopped accepting credit cards in 2000 due to too many people used stolen credit cards when conducting business with him. \\"The interrogation became less about me and more about politics and e-gold,\\" Bradley said. \\"They were trying to get me to blame e-gold for fraud.

The forces of Pontus were commanded by Archelaus and Neoptolemus, while the Bithynians were led by King Nicomedes himself. Pontus was victorious. This battle and subsequent events would lead to the loss of Roman rule in the province of Asia for some years.  Forces  The Pontic army was under the overall command of Mithridates, who had a force of 250,000, compared to Nicomedes, who only had 50,000 infantry and 6,000 cavalry. The Pontic advance force at the Amnias River, where this battle took place, was commanded by the brothers Neoptolemus and Archelaus, who had a force that according to Appian was outnumbered by Nicomedes, despite the size of the whole Pontic army. The battle The Battle of the Amnias River started around a rocky hill on the plains. Neoptolemus and Archelaus, commanding the advance forces of Mithridates, sent troops forward to occupy the hill, but they were repelled by Nicomedes. Neoptolemus then led another attack on the hill, but was repelled again. Nicomedes managed to force Neoptolemus' men to retreat, but before Nicomedes could finish off Neoptolemus, he was attacked on the flank by Archelaus. Turning Point The turning point of the battle occurred when the Scythed chariots led by Archelaus dived into Nicomedes army. According to Appian, the chariots caused wounds of such a hideous nature that they caused fear and confusion among Nicomedes' troops, \\"...cutting some of them in two, and tearing others to pieces.\\" So horrified was the army at the spectacle of men being cut in half while still breathing, or their mangled bodies hanging in parts on the scythes that, \\"overcome rather by the hideousness of the spectacle than by the loss of the fight, fear took possession of their ranks.\\" This gave Neoptolemus time to regroup and attack what was now the rear of Nicomedes' army. Even though Archelaus and Neoptolemus now had the clear advantage, the battle did not end until Nicomedes had lost most of his army.  Aftermath  The remaining survivors from Nicomedes' army fled into Paphlagonia, where they were able to join up with the Roman army under Manius Aquillius. Later in the year this combined army would be defeated by Pontic forces at the fortress of Protophachium forcing the Romans out of Asia Minor.

Established in July 1976, as a campus of the University of Sindh, and a year later was chartered as an independent university. The academician S.M. Qureshi was appointed as the founding Vice Chancellor of the University. It was ranked 6th in engineering category of Higher Education Institutions in the \\"5th Ranking of Pakistani Higher Education Institutions\\" in 2016. History MUET Auditorium Established in 1963 in direct response to industrialization as Sind University Engineering College, it was affiliated with the University of Sindh (est. 1951) at Jamshoro until 1973, Dr. Abdul Qadeer Khan Afghan was one of the founding principal of the college, later with his efforts college was granted the charter of \\"Engineering University\\" under the title of \\"Mehran University of Engineering & Technology\\". The first batch of MUET was inducted in January 1974 with the enrollment of 450 students in civil, mechanical, electrical, electronics, metallurgy, chemical, and industrial engineering. Initially, the classes were started at Government College of Technology, Sakrand Road, Nawabshah, with students residing in college hostels (some classrooms were converted into residential dormitory). Some students acquired private houses in the Society area in Nawabshah, where they lived for two years until newly constructed hostel blocks were made available adjacent to the college campus. With the induction of the third batch in 1976, the students of the first batch were shifted to Jamshoro to complete their third year and final year of engineering education. This was predominately due to the availability of well- equipped laboratories and highly qualified faculty at MUET Jamshoro campus, and also due to the shortage of space for classrooms and labs at Nawabshah since the number of students had risen to 1500 when the third batch was admitted. The same practice continued for other junior batches who passed their second year of engineering at MUET, Nawabshah, were transferred to MUET Campus at Jamshoro to resume the fifth semester (third year).

About Charity Navigator was launched in spring 2001 by John P. (Pat) Dugan, a wealthy pharmaceutical executive and philanthropist. The group's mission was to help \\"donors make informed giving decisions and enabling well-run charities to demonstrate their commitment to proper stewardship\\" of donor dollars.Overholt, Alison. Charitable Deductions: Charity Navigator dares to hold the nation's nonprofits accountable for their fund- raising , August 2003. Initially, Charity Navigator provided financial ratings for 1,100 charities, and it has data on 8,500 as of mid-2017.Ann Carrns. Charity Navigator Tweaks Its Rating System. New York Times. 27 May 2016. In 2011, Kiplinger's Personal Finance selected Charity Navigator as a Money Management Innovation for \\"helping millions of people become philanthropists,\\" and it was on Time magazine's top 50 websites of 2006 list. However, in a 2014 Chronicle of Philanthropy interview on the nonprofit sector, Nicholas Kristof identified it with a trend he deplored: \\"There is too much emphasis on inputs and not enough on impact,\\" Kristof said. \\"This has been worsened by an effort to create more accountability through sites like Charity Navigator. There is so much emphasis now on expense ratios that there is an underinvestment in administration and efficiency.\\" A 2014 survey of attitudes toward charity evaluation lauded Charity Navigator in six of seven categories. Evaluation method Using publicly available tax returns (IRS Form 990) filed with the Internal Revenue Service and information posted by charities on their web sites, the Charity Navigator rating system bases its evaluations in two broad areas--financial health and accountability/transparency. Limitations of initial methodology This method was criticized in an article in the Stanford Social Innovation Review for taking into account only a single year's IRS Form 990. This can lead to significant fluctuation in the ranking of a charity from year to year. Also, the focus on the IRS Form 990 has itself been criticized, as the accuracy and reliability of IRS Form 990 data is questionable. Form 990 categorizes a charity's expenditures into three broad categories that are open to accounting manipulation. The nonprofit sector does not have the strict financial regulation and transparency required from public corporations (under the Securities Act of 1933, the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, among others), creating limitations on how accurately a charity's efficiency can be graded based on a tax return. Particularly relevant to Charity Navigator's methodology is that 59% of the 58,000 charities receiving public donations in 1999 failed to report any fundraising expenditures, illustrating a potential problem with relying on Form 990 figures alone when analyzing an organization. It only rates the 6% of charity organizations in the United States that have over $1 million in annual revenue (these 6% get 94% of the revenues that come into the nonprofit sector each year) Revisions In December 2008, President and CEO Ken Berger announced on his blog that the organization intends to expand its rating system to include measures of the outcomes of the work of charities it evaluates. This was described in further detail in a podcast for The Chronicle of Philanthropy in September 2009. The article explained that plans for a revised rating system will also include measures of accountability (including transparency, governance and management practices) as well as outcomes (the results of the work of the charity). In July 2010, Charity Navigator announced its first major revamp. This revamping begins what the organization states is the process to move toward CN 3.0, which is a three-dimensional rating system that will include what they consider the critical elements to consider in making a wise charitable investment # financial health (Charity Navigator evaluated this from its inception), # accountability and transparency (begun in July 2010) and # results reporting (slated to begin rating this dimension in July 2012). After collecting data for more than a year, in September 2011 Charity Navigator launched CN 2.0, which is a two-dimensional rating system that rates a charity's (1) financial health and (2) accountability and transparency.  2013 expansion  In January 2013, Charity Navigator announced another expansion to its rating methodology, \\"Results Reporting: The Third Dimension of Intelligent Giving.\\" Because mission-related results are the very reason that charities exist, Charity Navigator developed this new rating dimension to specifically examine how well charities report on their results. The new rankings now include \\"various criteria, including ... privacy policies\\"  2020 expansion  In July 2020, Charity Navigator announced an additional nonprofit rating system, Encompass. The new Encompass Rating System analyzes nonprofit performance based on four key indicators: # Finance & Accountability # Impact & Results # Leadership & Adaptability # Culture & Community This alternative methodology allows the organization to increase the total number of rated nonprofits from 9,000 to 160,000 at launch.

It is located at 4700 Lincoln Avenue. History The original community, formed in 1917, worshiped in a rented hall until it built the first Greek Orthodox church in the East Bay. The Assumption Greek Orthodox Church (in Greek, ŒöŒøŒØŒºŒ∑œÉŒπœÇ œÑ·øÜœÇ ŒòŒµŒøœÑœåŒ∫ŒøœÖ), opened on May 21, 1921, on Brush Street in Downtown Oakland. By 1960, the community, having outgrown its facilities, relocated to the present site in the Oakland hills and was re-dedicated to the Analypsis (the Ascension of Our Savior), on December 11, 1960. The church was elevated to the status of a cathedral in February 1992. The Greek Orthodox Cathedral of the Ascension has evolved from a predominantly immigrant society into one that now spans six generations, with over 1,200 parishioners, making it the largest Greek Orthodox community in the Greek Orthodox Metropolis of San Francisco. Icons and events The cathedral has a distinctive collection of Orthodox iconography. The icon of Jesus the Pantocrator (or Almighty) is the largest Orthodox icon of Jesus in the Americas. Reverend Father Thomas J. Paris served as Ascension's pastor from 1971 until his retirement nearly four decades later. Reverend Father Tom Zaferes is now the pastor and dean of the cathedral. A new chapel, dedicated to the Assumption of the Virgin Mary, is currently being constructed on the church grounds. The Cathedral hosts an annual Greek food and culture festival, traditionally held the weekend after Mother's Day, on the church grounds. One of the largest festivals of its kind in the United States, the Oakland Greek Festival offers a wide variety of Greek foods, cultural exhibitions, Greek dancing, and live music.

The screenplay by Sprecher and her sister Karen focuses on five seemingly disparate individuals in search of happiness whose paths intersect in ways that unexpectedly impact their lives. Plot The film is divided into 13 vignettes, each prefaced by an aphorism. Set in New York City, the story revolves around ambitious district attorney Troy (Matthew McConaughey), who is stricken with guilt following a hit and run accident in which he injures Beatrice (Clea DuVall), an idealistic cleaning woman who, forced to reassess her life during her recuperation, finds herself thinking more like her cynical co-worker Dorrie (Tia Texada). Mid-level insurance claims manager Gene (Alan Arkin), unable to cope with his son's downward spiral into drug addiction, is rankled by an unrelentingly cheerful staff member and suffers pangs of regret after firing him without just cause. College physics professor Walker (John Turturro), trying to cope with a midlife crisis, becomes romantically involved with a colleague, an infidelity his wife Patricia (Amy Irving) is forced to face when his wallet, stolen in a mugging, is mailed to their home and she discovers incriminating evidence inside it. Cast *Matthew McConaughey as Troy *John Turturro as Walker *Clea DuVall as Beatrice *Alan Arkin as Gene *Amy Irving as Patricia *Tia Texada as Dorrie *Richard E. Council as Del Production The Sprecher sisters scripted Thirteen Conversations About One Thing over the course of eight weeks. The script was completed before Jill's directorial debut Clockwatchers was released in 1997, but due to a lack of funding the film took over three years to make. The plot was inspired in part by events in Jill Sprecher's life, including two muggings and a subway assault. The character of Beatrice is based on Sprecher's experiences when she moved to Manhattan following college graduation: \\"Clea Duvall's character is very autobiographical ... I was that person who only saw good things around me and then, of course, after getting mugged, I sort of changed my opinion of human beings.\\" The film premiered at the 2001 Venice Film Festival and was shown at the Toronto International Film Festival, the MIFED Film Market in Italy, the 2002 Sundance Film Festival, the Hong Kong International Film Festival, the San Francisco International Film Festival and the Wisconsin Film Festival before going into limited release in the United States. There, it opened on nine screens, earning $89,499 and ranking #34 on its opening weekend. It eventually grossed $3,288,164 in the US and $418,488 in foreign markets for a total worldwide box office of $3,706,652.BoxOfficeMojo.com Reception Thirteen Conversations About One Thing was generally well received by critics, who praised the quality of the cast and the treatment of the film's themes. Roger Ebert described the movie as \\"brilliant ... It is philosophy, illustrated through everyday events.\\" A. O. Scott of the New York Times called the film \\"both straightforward and enigmatic\\" and said that \\"the quiet naturalism of the acting balances the artifice of the script and the almost finicky precision of Ms. Sprecher's frames\\". For Scott, the film is \\"thrillingly smart, but not, like so many other pictures in this vein, merely an elaborate excuse for its own cleverness. As you puzzle over the intricacies of its shape, which reveal themselves only in retrospect, you may also find yourself surprised by the depth of its insights.\\" New York Times review Houston Chronicle reviewer Eric Harrison called the film an \\"intricately devised and thoughtful comedy\\", while San Francisco Chronicle reviewer Mick LaSalle said it \\"makes a case for cinema as a vehicle for conveying moods and ideas and, hardest of all, the internal movements of a soul.\\" Negative reviewers wrote that the film had problems of tone and a lack of depth to its philosophical underpinnings. Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian awarded the film two out of five stars and commented that the film \\"suffers from curate's-egg unevenness, though its good points certainly stick in the mind.\\" According to Entertainment Weekly critic Ty Burr, the film has \\"luminous performances, but a genteel tone of despair drags the whole thing down\\". The Village Voice's Jessica Winter said \\"the film succeeds only when it peers up from the intro- philosophy book for the occasional glimpse of everyday beauty\\".

McConnell, Jr. and the CEO, Steve Girsky. It allowed anyone with an e-mail address to buy or sell StormPay Auction items after opening an online account. Steve Girsky is also the registered owner of Clixsense.com, a Paid To Click site also based in Clarksville. by General=Funding/Depositing The currency used in accounts was United States dollars. However, StormPay was not like a bank, where the money in ones account is actually backed by real money. A StormPay user can fund their account with an online check, money order, or by clicking on sponsored links, purchased by StormPay members themselves, in the StormClix section of the StormPay website. StormPay (and NetIBA) have also paid commissions for referring new members to the payment process or verification system. Fees Opening a StormPay account was free. It was also free to send money to another e-mail address. However, a fee was incurred when receiving funds: if the recipient was NetIBA certified, this was 39 cents plus 2.9% of the amount being received; if not, it was 49 cents and 4.9%. This marks a return to the usual fee structure used by most online payment processors that was also used by StormPay before becoming an auction-only site, but the non- certified fee has been reduced from the level in March 2006, which was 69c + 6.9%. Additionally, for a brief period in April and early May 2006, there was no fee for NetIBA certified accounts and it was 2% otherwise. Certification Being NetIBA certified costs $19.95 a year. It was claimed to be a third-party identity verification service. It is also located in Clarksville, Tennessee and registered with the Tennessee Secretary of State by McConnell, indicating that it is not a third-party service. The NetIBA certification process purportedly includes the sending of a PIN by telephone and a PIN by mail, however, users have also reported that the phone step is occasionally skipped. After being certified, webmasters may place an image on their website to display this fact to potential customers. In the NetIBA FAQ, under the question: \\"What form of payment do you accept?\\" the following answer is given: \\"NetIBA accepts StormPay. NetIBA recommends when shopping online that you use services such as StormPay to ensure that your financial information does not end up in the hands of wrong doers.\\" Withdrawing StormPay allows users to withdraw money via a debit card, or the mailing of a personal check. There was a $2 fee for withdrawing with a check and using the debit card incurs various monthly account maintenance and individual withdrawal fees. These individual withdrawal fees are in addition to any charges that may be levied by the bank that owns the ATM used to withdraw money. The debit card is usable Internationally. However, the check is in U.S. Dollars, and costs $20 to be sent by courier, $35 internationally. These fees, and the additional cost of exchanging fees from a US check in other countries, make it not profitable to withdraw by international check unless one's account balance is very high. On 15 May 2006, StormPay added the options to withdraw money directly into U.S. checking accounts with a $1 fee and into e-gold accounts with a StormPay fee of 5% in addition to e-gold fees. Chargebacks StormPay allows the account of a seller to be charged back if the buyer claims non-receipt of the auction item. However, this does not apply to services, as in the Terms of Service. The fee for a chargeback is $35, and, as documented on Money Maker Group Forum, this may cause a negative balance to appear in one's StormPay account. The balance may be restored automatically by StormPay by deducting the necessary funds from one's attached bank account. If one then attempts to charge back StormPay from the bank, StormPay will immediately freeze the account and alter the balance to -$10,000. Excessive complaints by users will also cause an account to be frozen, which prevents the owner from sending or receiving money, but does permit the refunding of money, if available, to previous payers. According to terms, the funds in frozen accounts may be released 180 days after the freezing, however the majority of frozen accounts were suspended in February 2006, and remain suspended. History=TymGlobal McConnell, one of the founders of StormPay, had previously used the service as the payment processor for a pyramid/ponzi scheme, TymGlobal, in 2002-2003. An order to cease and desist was given by the Tennessee Securities Division. All references to TymGlobal were then removed from StormPay in an attempt to clean up its image, after which it became a general online payment processor usable for any purpose within its Terms of Service. In 2004-2006, StormPay was used almost exclusively by autosurf websites, Paid To Read sites, high-yield investment programs, money randomizers, gifting clubs, and online auction sales.  Controversy with autosurfs  On 31 January 2006, StormPay formally announced on its website that it would not allow itself to be used on any site which also offered another payment processor, such as PayPal or e-gold. The justification of this move was to prevent the transfer of funds between payment processors, which would increase the likelihood and untraceability of fraudulent money. However, this move was also seen by some as the first step in establishing a monopoly over its niche market. As a result, many autosurf websites elected to remove other payment options, while others elected to remove StormPay. This occurred despite the fact that StormPay, at one time, provided members with the option to fund their StormPay accounts via e-gold. By 2 February 2006, StormPay had suspended or frozen numerous StormPay accounts, especially those used by the administrators of autosurf sites, seemingly regardless of whether they complied with the original request. Emails sent to StormPay questioning the issue were responded to with the following: :Unfortunately, we are unable to process any further transactions on behalf of the merchant. StormPay Inc. certainly understands your concerns regarding this situation. However, the funds of this merchant were frozen by an outside organization pending further investigation. To protect the integrity of the investigation we are unable to release any details at this time. Once the funds are released, StormPay will release the funds to claimant(s) for disbursement. On 5 February 2006, StormPay posted a second announcement on their website stating that they had \\"closed the accounts of what appear to be some major ponzi schemes\\", because of \\"results of investigations into those businesses by outside investigational organizations as well as our own internal investigations. As a result, possible victims of these businesses\\" had conducted distributed denial-of-service attacks against them leading to the recent downtime of their service. This is in contrast to their first announcement, only stated that other payment processors had to be removed. The now defunct autosurf 12DailyPro announced plans to send a lawsuit against StormPay. However, the autosurf was soon discovered to be a ponzi scheme and was ordered to cease and desist. For a prolonged period spanning February 8 to 10, 2006, the StormPay website was again unavailable due to a DDOS attack. One result of this controversy is StormPay's conversion to an auction-only site. On 23 March 2006, StormPay announced on its website that it would \\"no longer accept payments for sales made outside of StormPay Auctions\\", in order to ensure \\"a safer online experience for both buyers and sellers\\" as it would \\"more closely monitor the products/services sold\\". This means that all money transferred through StormPay must be accompanied by a product, which StormPay can monitor. As a result, StormPay is no longer usable for \\"investments\\" in autosurfs or HYIPs. The second result of this controversy was Steve Girsky's launch of a second business called Clix Sense. In an attempt to hide his ownership, there is no mention of who owns Clix Sense or runs it and a proxy is used for the name registration. Being a registered company, records are filed with the Tennessee Department of State and open to public viewing http://www.tennesseeanytime.org/soscorp/details.jsp Criticisms According to a legal firm under contract with the SEC, the digital money balance visible in one's StormPay account is not backed up by money in StormPay's bank accounts. This led to a situation in early 2006 where Stormpay was not able to pay out withdrawals requested by users and many of the users never received their requested funds. To date, StormPay has not released the funds it froze back in February 2006, despite StormPay's Terms of Service providing for such funds to be distributed 180 days after being frozen. As a result, many former users hold a hostile attitude towards StormPay. StormPay claims to offer buyer protection. However, the User Agreement includes the clause \\"At any time you purchase a product or service StormPay is reselling, all liability is on the vendor who contracted StormPay to resell their product or service, and you understand that these purchases are done at your own risk\\". Because of this, buyers are not refunded if they do not receive the item purchased. StormPay is not a member of the Better Business Bureau, although it has generated more complaints to BBB than any other Middle Tennessee or Southern Kentucky business.

He also recorded and performed with a number of other musicians, including Graham Bond, Long John Baldry, Murray Head, Sandy Denny and Danny Kirwan. Early life and career Weston was born in Plymouth in the county of Devon on 1 November 1947, to a Royal Navy service family. In his childhood he learned to play the violin, switching to the guitar at the age of 12, being influenced by the music of American blues artists such as John Lee Hooker and Muddy Waters.Obituary for Weston, 'The Independent', 10 January 2012. https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/bob-weston-early-70s-guitarist- with-fleetwood-mac-6287377.html Moving to London from Devon in the mid-1960s (he retained a soft West Country burr to his voice for the rest of his life), in 1967 he became the lead-guitarist with a mod-beat band called The Kinetic, which was based at the time in Paris, playing as a support act to Jimi Hendrix and Chuck Berry gigs in France. The band signed to the French label Disques Vogue and released into the French market a long-player entitled Live Your Life (1967), with Weston being the band's principal songwriter,History of 'The Kinetic', 'Rockasteria' website (2018). http://rockasteria.blogspot.com/2013/07/the-kinetic-suddenly-tomorrow-ep- live.html and two EP's, Live Your Life (1967),Entry for 'Live Your Life' E.P. on '45 Cat' website, a French historic records catalogue (2018). http://www.45cat.com/record/epl8544 and Suddenly Tomorrow (1967).

In 1971 he was performing with the Southern Rock act Ashman Reynolds as its lead guitarist,Weston performing 'Taking Off' with 'Ashman Reynolds' on Beat-Club in 1971.

The band was aware of Weston's talent having seen him performing when Long John Baldry had regularly shared the same billing at venues with Fleetwood Mac, and when the guitar vacancy had arrived in Fleetwood Mac's line-up Weston was approached by the band with the offer of joining, which he agreed to in September.Online Q.& A. session with Weston, 6‚Äì19 December 1999. http://www.fleetwoodmac.net/penguin/qa/bobweston_qa1.htm In January 1973 Fleetwood Mac recorded the long-player Penguin, Weston playing the record's distinctive slide guitar on the song \\"Remember Me\\", and its harmonica and banjo tracks on \\"The Derelict\\". He also sang a duet with Christine McVie on the song \\"Did You Ever Love Me\\", and wrote the instrumental that closed the album, titled \\"Caught in the Rain\\".'Fleetwood Mac: Behind the Mask', by Bob Brunning (Pub. Hodder & Stoughton, 1990). Later in 1973 the band recorded its next album titled Mystery to Me. Weston contributed more distinctive guitar work, such as the slide intro on the song \\"Why\\", and co-wrote the song \\"Forever\\" with Welch and John McVie. In retrospect, Weston felt that his contribution to the band's work in this period did not receive the formal recognition that it deserved.The Penguin Q&A; with Bob Weston, December 6‚Äì19, 1999 During a tour of the United States of America in 1973, when the band were beginning to gel particularly well in its live performances,Fleetwood Mac in concert playing 'Believe Me', 1973. Published on YouTube 7 January 2012. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMQZnfRcQiE it emerged that Weston had started a clandestine romantic relationship with Mick Fleetwood's wife, Jenny Boyd. Fleetwood had got on well with Weston before this, and tried to carry on with the arranged live performance schedule due to the legal and financial penalties that would be incurred by the band for a cancelled tour, but after a gig at Lincoln, Nebraska in October he informed the band in Weston's absence that he was no longer willing to work with him. In consequence the band collectively agreed to drop Weston from the line-up, Weston being told about the decision by the act's tour manager, with the rest of the tour being abandoned by the remaining members. (It was this situation which gave rise to the \\"Bogus Fleetwood Mac\\" saga in which its manager Clifford Davis hired a new group of musicians, passed them off as Fleetwood Mac, and sent them out to complete the tour). Weston's involvement in the band had an effect beyond purely the musical, as the spin into which his relationship with Boyd had put it contributed to Bob Welch's departure from its line-up in 1974. This led to a vacancy filled by Lindsey Buckingham and Stevie Nicks, who brought to the band a more mainstream rock sound, which would in the late 1970s-1980s lead to its greater popularity and commercial success. Later career On his return to London in late 1973 from the aborted Fleetwood Mac tour, Weston was approached by George Harrison about a possible collaboration, but this did not develop into anything of a practical nature. Weston went on to record and tour in Europe and North America with Murray Head, playing on his second album Say It Ain't So (1975), for which he co-wrote the song \\"Silence Is a Strong Reply\\". In July 1975 he joined a newly formed band called the Steve Marriott All Stars, but when Marriott opted to play lead guitar himself, Weston departed in December of the same year, and for the remainder of his career worked primarily as a solo artist or as a session musician. In 1979 he played on Head's third album Between Us. In 1979 he wrote and recorded a blues rock album titled Nightlight, which was produced by Alan Callan at Basing Street Studios and at Roundhouse Studio in London, and commercially released the following year through the French record label AZ International.Entry for 'Nightlight' (1980) on 'Fleetwood Mac.net' website. http://discog.fleetwoodmac.net/discog.php?pid=116 However, with popular taste in music having moved on from the early 1970s, and British blues rock having become a small uncommercial niche market the record failed to enter the charts.S.

In 1980 he recorded another blues rock album, Studio Picks, at Eel Pie Studios, produced again by Callan, featuring his own material and a cover of the Everly Brothers' \\"When Will I Be Loved\\". Mick Fleetwood played drums on one track, \\"Ford 44\\", the first time that he and Weston had worked together since the acrimony of 1973. The record was again released by AZ International in 1981, but like Nightlight it failed to enter the United Kingdom albums chart, and Weston's contract with the label was subsequently terminated.Entry for 'Studio Picks' (1981) on 'Fleetwood Mac.net' website. http://discog.fleetwoodmac.net/discog.php?pid=117 In 1985 Weston made a foray into mainstream pop music with a standalone single, \\"Desire\\", released by the French record company Underdog Records, but it also failed to chart and was his last solo commercial record. With his career as a solo artist having failed to take off, in the 1980s Weston returned to working as a professional session musician, playing live on tour with a variety of acts, working in London studios, and intermittently in Europe and America. He played on Dick Morrissey's 1986 jazz album Souliloquy, writing one of its songs, and also worked in television music production.Obituary for Weston. 'The Independent', 10 January 2012.

It is considered one of the most important battles of the period. Although the crusading movement continued for several more centuries, the capture of the city marked the end of further crusades to the Levant. When Acre fell, the Crusaders lost their last major stronghold of the Crusader Kingdom of Jerusalem. They still maintained a fortress at the northern city of Tartus (today in north-western Syria), engaged in some coastal raids, and attempted an incursion from the tiny island of Ruad, but when they lost that as well in 1302 in the Siege of Ruad, the Crusaders no longer controlled any part of the Holy Land. Background In 1187, Saladin conquered much of the Kingdom of Jerusalem (also called the Latin Kingdom), including Acre and Jerusalem, after winning the Battle of Hattin and inflicting heavy losses on the Crusaders. The Third Crusade was launched in response; the Crusaders besieged and eventually recaptured Acre in 1191. Acre became the capital of the Kingdom of Jerusalem. The religious orders made their headquarters in and around the city, and from there made crucial military and diplomatic decisions. For example, when the Mongols arrived from the East in the mid-13th century, the Christians saw them as potential allies while also maintaining a cautious neutrality with the Muslim Mamluks. In 1260, the Barons of Acre granted the Mamluks safe passage through the Latin Kingdom en route to fighting the Mongols; the Mamluks subsequently won the pivotal Battle of Ain Jalut in Galilee against the Mongols. This was an example of atypically cordial relations between the Christians and the Mamluks. In 1250, the Mamluk Sultanate arose in Egypt; it was a more dangerous enemy than the Ayyubids. The Mamluks fielded heavy cavalry - a match for the Crusader knights - and was much more hostile. As early as 1261, after the Battle of Ain Jalut, Sultan Baibars led the Mamluks against the Crusaders. Baibars captured Caesarea, Haifa, and Arsuf in 1265, all the important Crusader holdings in Galilee the following year, and then Antioch in 1268. Europe launched a number of minor Crusading expeditions to reinforce the Crusader states, including the abortive Crusade of Louis IX of France to Tunis in 1270, and the minor Ninth Crusade of Prince Edward (later King Edward I) of England in 1271‚Äì1272. The expeditions failed to provide the required relief; they were too small, too short-lived, and the interests of the participants were too diverse. Fall of Tripoli in 1289 triggered frantic preparations to save Acre. More seriously, no major reinforcing Crusade was forthcoming. Pope Gregory X was unable to rally support for another great Crusade. Papal advisors blamed the lack of enthusiasm to the laziness and vice of the European nobility and to clerical corruption. A more fundamental reason seems to have been the debasement of Crusading ideal; Gregory X's predecessors had used Crusades to raise armies against the Papacy's European enemies. The Crusader states continued to deteriorate from continuing attacks and political instability. In 1276, the unpopular \\"King of Jerusalem\\" Hugh III moved his court to Cyprus. Under Sultan Al-Mansur Qalawun, the Mamluks captured Lattakia in 1278, and conquered the County of Tripoli in 1289. Qalawun concluded a ten- year truce with the Kingdom of Jerusalem in 1284. Following the fall of Tripoli, King Henry II, son of Hugh III, sent seneschal Jean de Grailly to warn European monarchs of the critical situation in the Levant.Runciman (1951), pp. 408 Pope Nicholas IV supported Jean by writing letters urging European potentates to act. However, the Sicilian question overshadowed calls for a new Crusade, and Edward I of England was too entangled by troubles at home. Decades of communications between the Europeans and the Mongols failed to secure a meaningful Franco-Mongol alliance. Pretext for attack One Arabian account claims that an affair between a rich young wife of the city and a Mussulman was discovered by the husband who: The Crusaders feared that Qalawun would use this as a pretext to resume the war, and petitioned the pontiff for reinforcements. According to Michaud, 25 Venetian galleys carrying 1600 men \\"levied in haste in Italy\\" were sent. Other sources claim 20 galleys of peasants and unemployed townfolks from Tuscany and Lombardy, led by Nicholas Tiepolo, the son of Doge Lorenzo Tiepolo, who was assisted by the returning Jean de Grailly and Roux of Sully. These were joined by five galleys from King James II of Aragon who wished to help despite his conflict with the Pope and Venice.Runciman (1951), pp. 409 The Italian reinforcements were ill- disciplined and without regular pay; they pillaged indiscriminately from both Muslims and Christians before setting out from Acre. According to Runciman they attacked and killed some Muslim merchants around Acre in August 1290, although in Michaud's account they instead pillaged and massacred towns and villages. Qalawun demanded the extradition of the Christian perpetrators. On the suggestion of Guillaume de Beaujeu, the Grand Master of the Knights Templar, the Council of Acre debated the issue; the Sultan's demand was rejected, with the Crusaders claiming that the murdered Muslims had been responsible for their own deaths.Runciman (1951), pp. 410-411 Siege=Prelude to battle Sultan Qalawun dissolved the truce with Acre and the Mamluks began mobilizing by October 1290. Qalawun died in December and was succeeded by his son, Al-Ashraf KhalilClaster (2009), pp. 286 (sometimes spelled Chalil.) Guillaume de Beaujeu received a message from Khalil, which stated the latter's intention to attack Acre and to refuse peace overtures.\\"Because you have been a true man, so we send you advance notice of our intentions, and give you to understand that we are coming into your parts to right the wrongs that have been done. Therefore we do not want the community of Acre to send us any letters or presents (regarding this matter), for we will by no means receive them.\\" ‚ÄîFrom the letter of Al-Ashraf Khalil to Guillaume de Beaujeu, The Templar of Tyre, Gestes des Chiprois, p.104/ part 3 Nonetheless, the Crusaders dispatched a peace delegation, led by Sir Philip MainebeufThe Templar of Tyre, Gestes des Chiprois, p.104 / part 3Philip Mainebeuf, who spoke Arabic, was accompanied by a knight named Bartholomew Pisan and a scribe named George. The Templar of Tyre, Gestes des Chiprois, p.104/ part 3, to Cairo; the delegation was imprisoned.Asili, p.110The Templar of Tyre, Gestes des Chiprois, p.104/ part 3 Khalil set out from Cairo in March 1291. The assembled Mamluk army greatly outnumbered the Crusaders. Khalil called upon Syria to reinforce his Egyptian army; he was answered by contingents from Damascus (led by Lajin), Hama (led by al-Muzaffar Taqai ad- Din), Tripoli (led by Bilban) and Al-Karak (led by Baibars al-Dewadar.)There are no reliable figures for the Muslim army, according to some sources it consisted of 60 000 cavalry and 160 000 infantry. Though the numbers seem exaggerated, the army of the Muslim was probably larger than that of the Crusaders. Asili, p.111Michaud, ibid, pp. 75‚Äì76, gives account of 7 emirs leaving in Kalouan's (ie Sultan Qalawun) stead as he was ill; he reports that each emir had 4,000 horse and 20,000 foot at his command ‚Äì giving about 160,000 men. A significant portion of the troops were volunteers.Abu al- Fida,p.278/ vol.13. According to Ibn Taghri most of Khalil's troops were volunteers. Ibn Taghri, p.5/ vol. 8 The army included a substantial artillery train drawn from fortresses across the Mamluk empire. Hama sent the enormous catapult \\"The Victorious\\" (, '.) Another large catapult was \\"The Furious\\" (, '.) There were also lighter mangonels called \\"Black Bulls\\" (, '.).Asili, p. 110. Templar of Tyre, p.105 Notable historians in the Mamluks ranks included Baibars al-Dewadar,Rukn ad-Din Baibars al-Dewadar was also a historian. He gave his account about the battle for Acre in his book \\"Zobdat al-Fikrah Fi Tarikh al-Hijrah ( 11 volumes )\\". and Abu al-Fida in the Haman contingent.Asli, p.114 The Crusaders appeals for aid met with little success. England sent a few knights, including Otto de Grandson of Savoy. The only noteworthy reinforcements came from Henry II of Cyprus, who fortified the walls and sent troops led by his brother Amalric. Burchard von Schwanden suddenly resigned as Grand Master of the Teutonic Order and left Acre for Europe; he was succeeded by Konrad von Feuchtwangen. The only major contingent to leave were the Genoese, who concluded a separate treaty with Khalil. Many women and children were evacuated from Acre to Cyprus in March. Acre was defended by an inner and outer wall, with a total of twelve towers built by European kings and rich pilgrims.Among these towers were the Tower of the Countess of Blois, the Accursed Tower, the Tower of the Legate, the Tower of the Patriarch, the Tower of St. Nicholas, the English Tower, the Germans Tower, the Tower of Henri II, the Tower of King Hugh and the Tower of St. Lazarus. Asili, p.113. Templar of Tyre, p.106/note2The English tower was built by Henry I. Asili, p.113The Tower of the Countess of Blois was built by the Countess of Blois. Asili, p.114 The siege begins Map of Acre in 1291 Sultan Khalil and the Egyptian army arrived at Acre on 6 April 1291, with the Syrian contingents arriving two days later with siege engines. The Mamluk encampment spanned from one coast to the other about two kilometres from the city walls. The red dihliz - the Sultan's personal tent and headquarters - was on a small hill west of the Legate's Tower. There was little fighting during the first eight days as the besiegers established their camp. From days nine to eleven the Mamluks pushed forward barricades and wicker screens until they reached the fosse before the outer wall; Carabohas, rapid-fire siege engines, were brought up. The besiegers began mining and bombarding the walls. Acre's gates remained open - but heavily defended - as sally ports. The Crusaders launched multiple attacks on the Mamluk camp. An amphibious assault on the Hamans - stationed on the northernmost section of the line by the sea - was successful although the Crusaders suffered heavy casualties. In another raid, three hundred Templar, led by Jean de Grailly and Otto de Grandson, rode out under moonlight to attack Haman artillery with Greek fire; while the artillery was not destroyed, the Templar engaged over 1000 Mamluks and returned with trophies and captured supplies. Khalil punished some subordinates for the humiliation caused by the Templar. In general, Crusader attacks failed to disrupt Mamluk preparations for a direct assault on the walls.Folda (2005), pp. 486 Henry II of Cyprus arrived on 4 May with reinforcements of 700 troops aboard 40 ships. The king's arrival temporarily buoyed morale, but an inspection of the city convinced Henry II to attempt a negotiated settlement; the Crusaders believed that tribute could buy a truce. On 17 May, William of Villiers, a knight, and William of Caffran, of Guillaume de Beaujeu's household, were sent to negotiate with the Sultan. The negotiations were unsuccessful. The Crusaders refused to surrender, and appealed to Khalil to lift the siege and accept peace for the sake of the civilian inhabitants. Khalil remained intent on conquering the city, perhaps encouraged by the popularity of the cause among his troops; his counteroffer to allow the defenders to surrender and leave with their lives and property was rejected. Toward the end of the meeting, a Crusader artillery stone landed near the dihliz; the Sultan was greatly angered and ordered a full assault the following day. The messengers returned to the city unharmed. The Mamluk assault was preceded by weeks of preparation. By 18 May, multiple towers and parts of the wall were collapsed by undermining, and sections of the fosse filled in. The collapse of the Tower of the King was particularly demoralizing among the defenders, and the evacuation of women and children accelerated. Storming the city The Mamluk army assembled before dawn on 18 May and attacked the entire length of the wall to the sound of trumpets and drums carried on 300 camels.Al-Maqrizi, p.223/ vol.2. Asili, p.118Michaud, ibid, p.78 The Mamluks poured through the breaches; by 9a.m. the outcome seems to have been beyond doubt. The Mamluks captured the Accursed Tower on the inner wallThe Accursed Tower was placed between the Tower of King Henri II and the Tower of the Teutonic Knights. Templar of Tyre, p.106. Asili, p.113 and forced the Crusaders to retreat to the Gate of St. Anthony; attempts by the defenders to recapture the tower failed.Templar of Tyre, p.113 Guillaume de Beaujeu was mortally wounded defending the Gate of St. Anthony. The Mamluks pushed into the city proper killing everyone they encountered.According to Ludolph of Suchem (which seems exaggeration): \\"In Acre and the other places nearly a hundred and six thousand men were slain or taken, and more than two hundred thousand escaped from thence. Of the Saracens more than three hundred thousand were slain, as is well known even to this day.\\" ‚ÄîFrom Ludolph of Suchem, p. 268-272 Organized Crusader resistance began to collapse as soldiers and civilians fled through the chaos and street fighting to whatever ships were available in the chaos; wealthy refugees offered exorbitant sums for safe passage. Henry II and Jean de Villiers, Grand Master of the Knights Hospitaller, were among those evacuated. The evacuation was made more difficult by the poor weather. Acre falls alt=Image of siege of Acre By the night of 18 May,Templar of Tyre, pp. 104 Acre was in Mamluk hands, except for the seaside Templar fortress at the western tip of city. The fortress held out for ten more days, during which Matthew of Clermont, a Hospitaller marshal, was killed. After a week, Sultan Khalil and Peter de Severy, the leader of the remaining Templars, negotiated a settlement to grant those in the fortress safe passage to Cyprus. The agreement collapsed when the Mamluks supervising the evacuation inside the fortress were killed by the Templars after trying to enslave women and boys. Templar Thibaud Gaudin and a few others left the fortress under the cover of darkness, taking the Templar treasury with them to Sidon. The following morning de Severy led a delegation to negotiate with Khalil; the delegation was executed in reprisal and there were no further negotiations. On 28 May, 200 Mamluks stormed the fortress through a wide breach. The fortress collapsed, killing the Templars and half of the Mamluks. News of Mamluk victory caused celebrations in Damascus and Cairo. In Damascus, Khalil entered the city with chained Crusader prisoners and captured Crusader standards - carried upside-down in defeat. The Sultan returned to Cairo with the gate of the Church of Saint Andrew from Acre, which was used to construct a mosqueAsili, p.123 and released Philip Mainebeuf's delegation.Ibn Taghri, p.9/ vol.8 Aftermath The fall of Acre signaled the end of the Jerusalem crusades. No effective crusade was raised to recapture the Holy Land afterwards, though talk of further crusades was common enough. By 1291, other ideals had captured the interest and enthusiasm of the monarchs and nobility of Europe and even strenuous papal efforts to raise expeditions to retake the Holy Land met with little response. The Latin Kingdom continued to exist, theoretically, on the island of Cyprus. There the Latin kings planned to recapture the mainland, but in vain. Money, men, and the will to do the task were all lacking. One last effort was made by King Peter I in 1365, when he successfully landed in Egypt and sacked Alexandria. Once the city was taken, however, the Crusaders returned to Cyprus. As a crusade, the episode was futile, and this and further coastal raids over the following decades led in 1410‚Äì11 to a destructive counter-raid by the Mamelukes; in 1426 Cyprus was forced into Mameluke vassalship with a hefty yearly tribute. The 14th century saw some other crusades organized, but these enterprises differed in many ways from the 11th- and 12th-century expeditions which are properly called Crusades. The crusades of the 14th century aimed not at the recapture of Jerusalem and the Christian shrines of the Holy Land, but rather at checking the advance of the Ottoman Turks into Europe. While many of the crusaders in these 14th-century undertakings looked upon the defeat of the Ottomans as a preliminary to the ultimate recapture of the Holy Land, none of the later crusades attempted any direct attack upon Palestine or Syria. In fiction The siege of Acre is covered in the Robyn Young historical novel Crusade, published in 2007, and Michael Jecks' Templar's Acre (2013). The siege appears at the beginning of the first episode of the History Channel's series Knightfall.

The regiment was first formed in mid-1942 during World War II as part of the 82nd Airborne Division and saw service in Sicily, Italy, Anzio, the Netherlands, Belgium and Germany. A parent regiment under the United States Army Regimental System, two battalions from the regiment, 1st Battalion (1-504 PIR) and 2nd Battalion (2-504 PIR), are currently active, both assigned to the 1st Brigade Combat Team, 82nd Airborne Division. World War II=Activation The regiment was initially constituted on 24 February 1942, over two months after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor and the subsequent American entry into World War II, in the Army of the United States as the 504th Parachute Infantry Regiment (504th PIR). The 1st, 2nd and 3rd Battalions were constituted the same date as Companies A, B, and C, respectively, of the 504th PIR, and were activated on 1 May 1942 at Fort Benning, Georgia, and was assigned to the U.S. Army Airborne Command. When complete with its regimental training, the 504th, then under the command of Colonel Theodore L. Dunn, was assigned to the 82nd Airborne Division, commanded by Major General Matthew Ridgway, on 15 August 1942. Serving alongside the regiment in the 82nd were the 325th and 326th Glider Infantry Regiments, together with supporting units. The 504th PIR, now under the command of 31-year-old Lieutenant Colonel Reuben Henry \\"Rube\\" Tucker, who had formerly been the 504th's executive officer (XO), soon moved from Fort Benning to Fort Bragg, North Carolina, on 30 September 1942 to finish its training, fill its Table of Organization and Equipment (TOE), and prepare for its staging call. When the call came, the regiment staged at Camp Edwards on 18 April 1943, and it made its port call on 10 May 1943, when it departed the New York Port of Embarkation (NYPOE). North Africa On 29 April 1943, the 504th boarded the troop ship USS George Washington which steamed to North Africa and the regiment's first overseas port of call, Casablanca. They arrived shortly before the end of the campaign in North Africa, which ended with the surrender of almost 250,000 Axis soldiers. Upon arrival the paratroops marched eight miles south of the city where they established a cantonment area consisting of a few stone huts and a tent city. Soon, the regiment was moved by \\"40 and 8‚Äôs\\" northward to Oujda, Morocco. The \\"40 and 8‚Äôs\\" were railroad cars dating from World War I, so called because they were designed to carry 40 men or 8 horses. Men of the 504th prepare a weapon for stowage aboard a glider in April 1943. Training intensified and senior officers such as General Eisenhower, the Supreme Allied Commander in the Mediterranean Theater of Operations (MTO), Lieutenant General Clark, the U.S. Fifth Army commander, and Lieutenant General Patton, the U.S. Seventh Army commander, along with the Sultan of Morocco and officials of every Allied nation watched the 504th go through its paces. Training included many practice jumps, and one conducted in winds of up to 30 miles-per-hour put nearly 30% of the unit in the hospital with broken bones, sprains and bruises. Finally, the order came and the 504th moved by truck to Kairouan, Tunisia, which was to be the 82nd Airborne Division's point of departure for the Allied invasion of Sicily. Sicily, July 1943 Colonel James M. Gavin, commander of the 505th Parachute Regimental Combat Team (with the 3rd Battalion of the 504th attached), led the 82nd Airborne Division during Operation Husky, and, on the night of 9 July 1943, the 504th helped spearhead the Allied invasion of Sicily in the first airborne military offensive in the history of the United States Army. The paratroopers of the 504th crossed over the Sicilian coast on schedule. Despite extensive precautions to avoid an incident, near the Sicilian coast a nervous Allied naval vessel suddenly fired upon the formation. Immediately, all other naval vessels and shore troops joined in, downing friendly aircraft and forcing planeloads of paratroopers to exit far from their intended drop zones in one of the greatest friendly fire tragedies of World War II. However, U.S. Navy ships had been under intense Axis aerial attacks, and many were unaware of the impending jump. Twenty-three planes were destroyed, thirty-seven were damaged, and almost 400 casualties were confirmed. Men of the 504th Parachute Infantry Regiment patrolling in Sicily, July 1943. Colonel Tucker's plane, after twice flying the length of the Sicilian coast and with well over 2,000 holes in its fuselage, finally reached the drop zone near Gela. By morning, only 400 of the rest of the regiment's 1,600 paratroopers had reached the objective area. The others had been dropped in isolated groups on all parts of the island and carried out demolitions, cut lines of communication, established island roadblocks, ambushed German and Italian motorized columns, and caused so much confusion over such an extensive area that initial German radio reports estimated the number of American parachutists dropped to be over ten times the actual number. On 13 July 1943, the 504th Parachute Infantry moved out, spearheading the 82nd Airborne Division's drive northwest along the southern coast of Sicily. With captured Italian light tanks, trucks, motorcycles, horses, mules, bicycles, and even wheelbarrows pressed into service, the 82nd encountered only light resistance and took 22,000 POWs in their first contact with enemy forces. Overall, the Sicilian operation proved costly, both in lives and equipment, but the regiment gained valuable fighting experience and managed to hurt the enemy in the process. It was with this experience and pride that the 504th returned to its base in Kairouan to prepare for the invasion of mainland Italy. Devils in Italy Back in North Africa, replacements arrived, training resumed, and the 3rd Battalion was again detached, this time to Bizerte, for special beach assault training with the 325th Glider Infantry Regiment (325th GIR) and the Army Rangers. The 1st and 2nd Battalions moved back to Sicily and trained for a drop at Capua ‚Äîin vain, however, because the enemy had been tipped off and was waiting on the drop zone. Another disappointment followed with the cancellation of the drop on Rome. Last minute intelligence disclosed that \\"negotiations\\" between Brigadier General Maxwell Taylor, commanding the 82nd Airborne Artillery, and Italian Marshal Pietro Badoglio were a trap. Finally, in early September, the 3rd Battalion rejoined the 325th GIR and the Rangers, boarded landing craft, and set out to sea. The men knew they were going to Italy, but little else. Troopers from H Company, with a group of Army Rangers, made the initial landing on 9 September 1943 on the Italian coast at Maiori. They quickly advanced inland to seize the Chiunzi Pass and a vital railroad tunnel. On 11 September 1943, the 3rd Battalion Headquarters and G and I Companies, along with the remainder of the 325th GIR, swerved south and landed at Salerno. The military situation deteriorated with each passing hour as German tanks and infantry tried to push the Allies back into the sea. The 3rd Battalion troopers dug in and held on. On standby at airfields in Sicily, the 1st and 2nd Battalions of the 504th were alerted, issued parachutes, and loaded on aircraft without knowledge of their destination. Receiving their briefing aboard the plane, the men were told that the U.S. Fifth Army's beachhead was in danger and they were needed to jump in behind friendly lines. Flying in columns of battalions, they exited over the barrels of gasoline- soaked sand that formed a flaming \\"T\\" in the center of the drop zone. The regiment assembled quickly and moved to the sounds of cannon and small arms fire within the hour. By dawn, the unit was firmly set in defensive positions. 81mm mortar during the battle for Italy, September 1943. The days that followed were, in the words of Lieutenant General Mark W. Clark, commander of the Fifth Army, \\"responsible for saving the Salerno beachhead.\\" As the 504th (minus the 3rd Battalion) took the high ground at Altavilla, the enemy counterattacked, inflicting heavy casualties on the regiment, and the divisional commander, Major General Ridgway, along with Major General Fred L. Walker, commander of the 36th Infantry Division, suggested the unit withdraw. Epitomizing the determined spirit of the regiment, Colonel Tucker vehemently replied, \\"Hell no! We've got this hill and we are going to keep it. Just send me my other battalion.\\" The 3rd Battalion, then being held in reserve, rejoined the rest of the 504th and, supported by a huge 350-round barrage from the Navy, repulsed the enemy, forcing the Germans to retreat from Salerno. Colonel Tucker and two of his men were awarded the Distinguished Service Cross for their actions at Altavilla. Men of the 504th Regimental Demolition Platoon keep a close eye while a demolitions expert searches for hidden S-mines on the slope of Hill 1017, November 1943. The operation secured the flanks of the Fifth Army, allowing it to break out of the coastal plain and drive on to Naples. On 1 October 1943, the 504th became the first infantry unit to enter the city of Naples, which it subsequently garrisons, along with most of the rest of the 82nd Airborne Division. The airborne operation at Salerno was not only a success, but it also stands as one of history's greatest examples of the mobility of the airborne unit: within only eight hours of notification, the 504th developed and disseminated its tactical plan, prepared for combat, loaded aircraft and jumped onto its assigned drop zone to engage the enemy and turn the tide of battle. The 82nd Airborne Division was slated as a unit to be used in the invasion of Normandy the following year. However, Lieutenant General Clark, the Fifth Army commander, was unwilling to give up the division. During the next few weeks in fighting Italy, the 504th, reinforced with the 376th and 456th Parachute Field Artillery Battalions to create the 504th Parachute Regimental Combat Team, fought in difficult terrain against a determined enemy. On steep, barren slopes, the regiment assaulted one hill after another. Mule trains aided in the evacuation of wounded to some extent, but casualties were often carried for hours down the steep hillsides just to reach the road. Finally, the 504th, severely understrength, was pulled back to Naples on 4 January 1944 as rumors of another airborne mission spread. The operation was to be called Operation \\"Shingle\\", and it involved an airborne assault into a sector behind the coastal town of Anzio, 35 miles south of Rome. It seemed, however, that even the locals in Naples knew of the operation, so the 504th was glad that the beach would be assaulted from troop- carrying landing craft. The landing on Red Beach went smoothly‚Äîat least until enemy planes started their strafing runs on the landing craft. The unit disembarked under fire and was sent shortly thereafter to patrol in force along the Mussolini Canal. After several days of intense German artillery fire, the enemy launched his main drive to push the Allies back into the sea. The 3rd Battalion was committed with elements of the British 1st Infantry Division in the heaviest fighting, with the paratrooper companies, due to the severe fighting, being reduced in strength to between 20 and 30 men. H Company drove forward to rescue a captured British General and was cut off. I Company broke through to them with their remaining 16 men. For its outstanding performance from 8 to 12 February 1944, the 3rd Battalion, 504th was presented one of the first Presidential Unit Citations awarded in the European Theater of Operations (ETO). Force dispositions at Anzio and Cassino January/February 1944. For the remainder of their eight-week stay in the Anzio beachhead, the men of the 504th found themselves fighting defensive battles instead of the offensive operations for which they were better suited and had been trained. For the first time the men were engaged in static trench warfare like that of World War I a generation before, with barbed wire entanglements and minefields in front and between alternate positions. It was during this battle that the 504th acquired the nickname \\"The Devils in Baggy Pants,\\" taken from the following entry found in the diary of a Wehrmacht officer killed at Anzio: :\\"American parachutists...devils in baggy pants...are less than 100 meters from my outpost line. I can't sleep at night; they pop up from nowhere and we never know when or how they will strike next. Seems like the black-hearted devils are everywhere...\\" On 23 March 1944, the 504th was pulled out of the beachhead by landing craft and returned to Naples. The campaign in Italy for the 504th had been costly, but enemy losses exceeded those of the regiment by over tenfold, and the Allies maintained control of the beachhead. Shortly thereafter, the 504th boarded the Cape Town Castle and steamed to England, arriving there on 22 April. The near-continuous fighting in Italy had cost the 504th dearly; just over 1,100 casualties were sustained. Just under 600 of these, or 25 percent, were suffered during the fighting at Anzio alone and two of three battalion commanders had become casualties. From England to the Netherlands Although Nazi broadcasters warned the 504th by radio that German submarines would never let the Cape Town Castle past the Straits of Gibraltar, the only danger the ship encountered came when all the troops rushed to the same side of the vessel as it pulled into Liverpool on 22 April 1944. The 82nd Airborne Division band greeted them with \\"We‚Äôre All American and proud to be...,\\" and it was assumed that the 504th would rejoin the 82nd for the upcoming invasion of Normandy, scheduled for early June. Yet, as D-Day approached, it became apparent that the 504th would be held back due to a lack of replacements. Brigadier General Gavin, the ADC, urged that the 504th be substituted for the two regiments that had joined the 82nd, the 507th and 508th, taking replacements from either of those units. However, Major General Ridgway, the division commander, vetoed the idea. Later, when Gavin sought volunteers to serve as pathfinders, around 50 men of the 504th came forward. The 504th thus remained in England as \\"Dry Runs\\" came one after another. Missions were scheduled for France, Belgium, and the Netherlands and then canceled at the last moment. For three days the troopers waited for the fog to lift to allow them to drop into Belgium, but the wait proved long enough for Lieutenant General George Patton's U.S. Third Army to overrun the drop zones, thereby returning the 504th to its English garrison. Therefore, when the word came on 15 September for the 82nd Airborne Division, now commanded by Brigadier General Gavin (thus making Gavin, aged just 37, the youngest divisional commander in the U.S. Army), to jump in ahead of the British Second Army, commanded by Lieutenant General Sir Miles C. Dempsey, 57 miles behind enemy lines in the vicinity of Grave, in the Netherlands, few believed the mission would actually be conducted. The operation would require seizing the longest bridge in Europe over the Maas River and several other bridges over the Maas-Waal Canal. The men of the 504th became even more doubtful the mission would go when told that the planned flight was through the Scheldt Estuary (nicknamed \\"Flak Alley\\" by Allied bomber pilots) and that they were reportedly outnumbered by 4,000 of Hitler's Schutzstaffel (SS) troops and an unknown number of German tanks. No cancellation was received, however, and on 17 September 1944 at 12:31 hours, the pathfinders of the 504th landed on the drop zone, followed thirty minutes later by the rest of the regiment and C Company of the 307th Airborne Engineer Battalion, to become the first Allied troops to land in the Netherlands as part of Operation Market Garden‚Äîthe largest airborne operation in history. By 18:00 hours, the 504th had accomplished its assigned mission (although the enemy had managed to destroy one of the bridges). In just four hours, the regiment had jumped, assembled, engaged the enemy, and seized its objectives. The 504th Parachute Infantry Regiment were some of the first Allied troops to land in the Netherlands as part of Operation Market Garden, the largest airborne operation in history. For the next two days, the regiment held its ground and conducted aggressive combat and reconnaissance patrols until the 2nd Battalion of the Irish Guards, part of the 5th Guards Armoured Brigade of the Guards Armoured Division, made the ground link-up, spearheading the advance of the British 30th Corps, commanded by Lieutenant General Sir Brian G. Horrocks, of the British Second Army. However, the Nijmegen road and rail bridges, which were the last remaining link to the British 1st Airborne Division fighting in Arnhem, remained in enemy hands, and the far bank was heavily defended by the Germans. An assault crossing of the river was necessary, but it was a seemingly impossible task. Gavin intended to make a pre-dawn crossing after consulting with British Lieutenant General Horrocks and Lieutenant General Sir Frederick A. M. Browning, commander of the British 1st Airborne Corps (of which the 82nd formed a part), in the presence of senior officers of the Guards Armoured and 82nd Airborne Divisions, and Colonel Reuben Tucker of the 504th, and during the night he drew up a plan, and alerted the troops at 06:00 in the expectation of the boats to be provided by the British XXX Corps. However, the crossing did not commence until 15:00 after the guns of the 376th Parachute Field Artillery Battalion and 153rd (Leicestershire Yeomanry) Field Regiment, Royal Artillery, and two troops of the Grenadier Guards Sherman tanks opened fire on the northern (Lent) bank. The British provided 26 canvas boats, each long, that the 504th used to cross the -wide river. The 3rd Battalion's H and I companies, and some engineers from the 307th Airborne Engineers crossed in the first wave, 15 men to a boat, and they were immediately on leaving the far shore the target of German 88mm cannons, 20mm cannons, flak wagons, machine guns and riflemen. Nonetheless, the crossing was launched. With only 2-4 oars in each boat, the remaining men rowed with the rifle butts. Only 13 boats made it across, and only 11 of those were in condition to return across the river to deliver succeeding waves. The 1st Battalion formed the second wave, and they established a firm bridgehead from which the units carried the battle to the enemy defending the old Fort BelvedereTime Magazine, World Battlefronts: The Battle of Desperation, 2 October 1944 (US Edition) and captured the bridge from the north side. Lieutenant General Dempsey, commander of the British Second Army, after witnessing the crossing, characterized the attack with a single word as he shook his head and said, simply, \\"Unbelievable.\\" Six crossings were made by 1900. It was there that Dempsey, upon meeting Brigadier General Gavin, shook him by the hand and said \\"I am proud to meet the commander of the greatest division in the world today.\\"p.199, Stewart, Vance, Three against one: Churchill, Roosevelt, Stalin vs Adolph Hitler, Sunstone Press, 2002 Because only 11 boats returned from the first crossing, eight from the second and five from the third, A Company that followed used locally sourced wooden fishing boats.Jim Broadhead interview of his father, PFC Daren Broadhead, in early 2004. Daren served in the 2nd Platoon, A Company France and Belgium, November 1944 After remaining in the front-line for the next few weeks, on 16 November 1944, the 504th arrived at Camp Sissone near Rheims in Northern France on British lorries, greeted again by the traditional \\"We‚Äôre All American...\\" of the 82nd band. Soon after, the 82nd moved to Camp Laon and began training with the new C-46 Commando aircraft, the first aircraft with two troop doors for parachute exits. At 2100 hours on the night of 17 December 1944, Colonel Tucker was summoned to the 82nd Airborne Division headquarters. There he learned that the Germans had broken through into Belgium and Luxembourg with a powerful armored thrust launched south of Aachen in what became known as the Battle of the Bulge. Men of the 504th PIR move through Aachen, Germany, the first large German city to be taken by the Allies. The next morning the 504th paratroopers started for Bastogne, not in airplanes, but in large trucks. Along the way, their destination was changed to Werbomont‚Äîa point more seriously threatened. The Devils conducted a night movement on foot for eight miles to take up defensive positions. On 19 December Colonel Tucker was ordered to Rahier and Cheneux to link up with the 505th PIR at Trois Ponts. The 1st Battalion was ordered to take the towns Brume, Rhier, and Cheneux. At 1400 on 20 December 1944, 1st Battalion (less A Company) moved out toward Cheneux, where it was immediately engaged by a battalion of the SS-Obersturmbannf√ºhrer Joachim Peiper's Kampfgruppe Peiper of the I SS Panzer Corps. Crossing an open 400-yard field laced every fifteen yards with barbed wire, the 1st Battalion faced the heaviest enemy fire the 504th had ever encountered, including heavy machine-guns, a 20mm gun, and a half-dozen German armored vehicles. Captain Jack M. Bartley was killed on 21 December 1944. SS troopers on reconnaissance. Several Germans were killed and one captured. 25 December 1944. The 504th deployed a captured German halftrack armed with a 70mm gun manned by two paratroopers with no training in its use. They were successful in knocking out several enemy positions. Still, the 504th took very heavy losses crossing the open field, and at 1700 were ordered to withdraw to the edge of a wood. Colonel Tucker ordered the 1st Battalion to engage in an assault on the German forces in Cheneux that night. The Devils pressed forward, and by nightfall had given the Germans their first defeat of the Battle of the Bulge. Through heavy fire, Companies B and C wiped out an estimated five companies of German forces, as well as fourteen flak- wagons, six half-tracks, four trucks, and four 105mm howitzers. However, the two companies were decimated, with 23 killed and 202 wounded; eighteen enlisted men remained in Company B, and thirty-eight men and three officers in Company C. Company A of the 1st Battalion, 504th, as well as the first platoon of Company C of the 307th Airborne Engineer Battalion, were awarded the Presidential Unit Citation for their outstanding performance during this action. Throughout the initial days of battle with experienced German troops, the regiment wore down the enemy and discovered the Germans had only poorly organized and inadequately equipped follow-on forces. Soon thereafter, the paratroopers received the orders they had been expecting‚Äîto attack the Siegfried Line. The regiment was positioned on the right flank of the U.S. First Army, and on 28 January 1945 the 504th advanced through the Belgian forest of Bullingen in columns of two along a deep snowy trail, meeting only spotty resistance along the way. While approaching Herresbach, the regiment encountered an enemy battalion in a head-on engagement that surprised both elements. The battle-wise paratroopers, without hesitation, accelerated their pace and moved on the enemy. The machine guns of the lead tank opened up on the Germans, while the men of the 504th fired their weapons from the hip at shooting-gallery speed. Within ten minutes, the enemy was overrun with more than 100 killed and 180 captured. Not a single 504th paratrooper was killed or wounded. Troops of 340th Tank Battalion and Headquarters Company of the 3rd Battalion, 504th advance in a snowstorm behind a tank to attack Herresbach, Belgium. 28 January 1945. Finally, on 1 February 1945, the order came to conduct the assault on the Siegfried Line through the Belgian Fort Gerolstein. The following day the 1st and 2nd Battalions jumped off on the attack. Moving cautiously from bunker to bunker, the troopers encountered heavy machine gun and small arms fire at all points. Ironically, the German Army's own Panzerfaust (a light anti-tank weapon with which the 504th was well equipped) was the regiment's most effective weapon against the German pillboxes. Despite the presence of thousands of mines and booby traps, only a small number of those disturbed actually detonated. Freezing temperatures, snow, ice and years of exposure had corroded the detonators. Vicious enemy counterattacks on 3 and 4 February were repulsed, and the unit was relieved. The regiment moved back to Grand Halleux where it spent several days before being trucked across the Belgian-German border. From Aachen, it moved by train back to Laon, France to await orders. On to Berlin Colonel Tucker and the advance detail left Laon on 1 April 1945 and traveled by jeep 270 miles to Cologne (K√∂ln), Germany. Three days later the regiment arrived, mostly in \\"40 and 8s,\\" and immediately took up positions along the west bank of the Rhine River. 504th patrols crossed nightly in small boats, engaging in brisk fire-fights almost every patrol. The enemy made a few attempts to cross to the regiment's side of the river, but all efforts were turned back. On 6 April 1945, A Company crossed the Rhine at 02:30 hours and immediately made contact with the enemy. Under heavy fire and in a minefield, the first wave of 504th troopers was split into two elements, each of which fought its way independently to the predesignated objective. There they rejoined forces, knocked out several machine gun nests, and established a roadblock. Using similar tactics, succeeding waves infiltrated the enemy and set up a defense in the village of Hitdorf. For a short time, all was calm. Company A was awarded a Presidential Unit Citation for its action during this engagement. Then the enemy counterattacked. The first counterattack was broken less than fifty yards from the perimeter, while the second was preceded by heavy artillery preparation. As enemy tanks and infantry closed in, the outnumbered and outgunned A Company fought its way back to the river's edge. The regiment sent I Company across to support the withdrawal. The 504th had lost only nine men to the enemy's 150, and 32 troopers were captured for 10 days and forced marched 100 km to Plettendorf, Germany then were liberated by elements of the 83rd Infantry Division. Whether the two companies achieved the higher aim of diverting enemy forces from a more important sector upstream is unknown. For the men involved, it was a small-scale \\"Dunkirk\\" with a hollow satisfaction achieved. The 504th was then relieved of its active defense of the Rhine and was directed to patrol the area north of Cologne until 1 May 1945. With little resistance to slow it down, the regiment established its command post in the town of Breetze, Germany on the west bank of the Elbe River. Although tanks had been attached to the unit, the 504th was outnumbered 100 to 1 by German troops clogging every road. Nevertheless, throughout the next several days, the Americans stood at 100-yard intervals collecting souvenirs by the jeep-load as almost never-ending columns of enemy forces poured through the regiment's lines to surrender. At 10:00 hours on 3 May 1945, a jeep full of I Company men grew tired of waiting for a Russian element to link up with them, so they drove down the south side of the Elde and then twelve more miles to the town of Eldenburg. There they were entertained by a company of Cossacks, whose specific unit designation none of the men could recall after partaking of the various toasts offered in honor of Roosevelt, Churchill and Stalin. The war officially ended in Europe on 8 May 1945. The 504th returned briefly to Nancy, France until the 82nd Airborne Division, the British 11th Armoured Division and the 5th Cossack Division were called upon to serve as the occupation forces in Berlin. Here the 82nd Airborne Division earned the name, \\"America‚Äôs Guard of Honor,\\" as a fitting end to hostilities in which the 504th had chased the German Army some across the European Theater. Following their occupation duty with the 82nd Airborne Division in Berlin, the Devils reported to Fort Bragg, North Carolina. Post World War II service=Occupation and garrison Following their occupation duty with the 82nd Airborne Division in Berlin, the Devils reported to Fort Bragg, North Carolina. The regiment remained at Fort Bragg until 1957, when the era of infantry regiments as tactical units ended and the Pentomic era began, in which designations were used to perpetuate lineages and honors. On 1 September of that year the lineage of Company A, 504 PIR was reorganized and redesignated as HHC, 1st Airborne Battle Group, 504th Infantry and remained assigned to the 82nd as one of five battle groups that replaced the three regiments previously assigned to the division. The lineage of Company B, 504 PIR was used to reflag existing elements of the 11th Airborne Division in Germany as HHC, 2nd Airborne Battle Group, 504th Infantry. The 1st ABG, 504th Infantry remained assigned to the 82nd Airborne Division until 11 December 1958 when it rotated to Germany (along with 1-505th) to become part of the Airborne component of the newly reactivated 8th Infantry Division (Mechanized). Both 1-504th and 1-505th were replaced in the 82nd by 1-187th and 1-503rd, which rotated from the 24th Infantry Division in Germany to the 82nd. The colors of both remained with the 8th until the end of the Pentomic era, at which time (1 April 1963) they were reorganized and reflagged as 1st and 2nd battalions (Airborne), 509th Infantry, elements of the division's 1st Brigade (Airborne). The colors of 1-504th returned to the 82nd, and on 25 May 1963 they were reorganized and redesignated as 1st Battalion (Airborne), 504th Infantry, an element of the 1st Brigade, 82nd Airborne Division. The 2nd ABG, 504th Infantry remained with the 11th Airborne Division in Germany only until 1 July 1958, when its colors were inactivated and the unit was reflagged as a non-Airborne battle group and the division was reflagged as the 24th Infantry Division. The colors were relieved on 9 May 1960 from assignment to the inactive 11th Airborne Division and assigned to the 82nd Airborne Division and reactivated on 1 July 1960, and then reorganized and redesignated on 25 May 1964 as the 2nd Battalion (Airborne), 504th Infantry, joined 1-504th as an element of the 1st Brigade, 82nd Airborne Division. The Dominican Republic, April 1965 On 26 April 1965, the 82nd Airborne Division received orders to prepare to deploy forces to the Dominican Republic. Two days earlier, a revolution had erupted in the Caribbean nation which put the safety of almost 3,000 American citizens in jeopardy. The initial deployment of 82nd Airborne soldiers came on 30 April 1965, and the two battalions of the 504th followed on 3 May 1965, landing at San Isidro Air Base to perform both military and humanitarian missions in support of Operation Power Pack. The 504th conducted military operations to help establish and maintain control of Santo Domingo and to provide security along the All American Expressway that ran through the city. During these operations, the 504th was often subject to sniper fire and in repeated contact with enemy factions, as it contributed greatly to the establishment of security and to the distribution of food and medical supplies to those in need. Only five days after the arrival of the first U.S. forces, approximately 2,700 American citizens and 1,400 civilians from other nations were evacuated without injury. However, it became apparent that to restore stability to the Dominican Republic would require a continued U.S. presence, so the 504th remained as part of the Inter-American Peace Force for over a year, not returning to Fort Bragg until the summer of 1966. U.S. troops were opposed by forces loyal to Juan Bosch, the Cuban/Soviet puppet president who was committed to spreading the totalitarian communist revolution to other island nations. Operation Golden Pheasant, Honduras 1988 In March 1988, 1st and 2nd battalions, the 504th joined soldiers from the 7th Infantry Division (Light) at Fort Ord, California in a deployment to Honduras as part of Operation Golden Pheasant - The 7th ID was the first unit on the ground and went directly to protect the local population from attack by Cuban armed communist guerrillas - a deployment ordered by President Reagan in response to actions by the Cuban and Soviet-supported Nicaraguan Sandinistas that threatened the stability of Honduras' democratic government. On 17 March 1988, 1st Battalion, 504th landed at Palmerola, a Honduran Air Force Base (now known as Soto Cano Air Base) that is the headquarters for the U.S. military presence in Honduras. 2nd Battalion jumped onto La Paz Drop Zone a day later, and the troopers of the 504th began rigorous training exercises with orders to avoid the fighting on the border. Had those orders changed, the Devils were prepared to fight, but the invading Sandinista troops had already begun to withdraw. In only a few days, the Sandinistan government negotiated a truce with Contra leaders, and by the end of March the paratroopers of the 504th had returned to Fort Bragg. Parachutes in Panama, 1989 On 20 December 1989, the 504th was again sent into battle as part of Operation Just Cause. The intent of this operation was to protect U.S. civilians in Panama, secure key facilities, neutralize both the Panamanian Defense Forces (PDF) and the \\"Dignity Battalions,\\" and restore the elected government of Panama by ousting General Manuel Noriega. The 3-504 PIR had been prepositioned at Fort Sherman two weeks prior to the operation and was under the control of the 7th Infantry Division. The battalion conducted air and sea assaults in northern and central Panama to seize the dam that controlled the water in the Panama canal, a prison, several police stations, several key bridges, a PDF supply point, the PDF demolitions school and an intelligence training facility. The operations were designed to neutralize the PDF while protecting U.S. nationals and the canal itself during the first few hours of the battle. The 1-504 PIR and 2-504 PIR, along with the 4th Battalion, 325th Airborne Infantry Regiment (4-325 PIR) and the 1st Battalion, 75th Ranger Regiment (1/75 RGR), conducted a parachute assault on the Omar Torrijos International Airport. Following the airborne assault, the paratroopers soon found themselves engaged in fierce combat in urban and rural areas. As a testament to the discipline of the soldiers, however, the unit achieved all key objectives while causing only minimal collateral damage. Devils in the desert, 1990 On 2 August 1990, the Iraqi Army (the world's fifth largest) attacked Kuwait. Paratroopers of the 82nd Airborne Division were quickly committed to Saudi Arabia and were positioned against an enemy that greatly outnumbered them. As diplomatic efforts failed, it became clear that the Iraqi Army would not withdraw. Plans were thus developed for Operation Desert Storm. President Bush's warning to Iraqi President Saddam Hussein to withdraw from Kuwait by 15 January 1991 went unheeded and on 27 January 1991 the air war began. Allied sorties pounded the enemy for more than a month as the XVIII Airborne Corps made a rapid movement westward to position its units to roll up the flank of the multi-echeloned Iraqi defense. In a powerful offensive lasting only 100 hours, the Allied forces‚Äîwith the 82nd on the far western flank‚Äîcrossed into Iraqi territory, devastated the Iraqi Army and captured thousands of enemy soldiers. The dangerous task of clearing countless enemy bunkers was quickly completed by the 82nd troopers, and the 504th returned to Fort Bragg in April 1991. Hurricane Andrew, 1992 In August 1992, 2nd Battalion, 504th PIR was alerted to deploy with a task force to the hurricane-ravaged area of South Florida to provide humanitarian assistance following Hurricane Andrew. For more than thirty days, the troopers provided the citizens with food, shelter and medical attention. Operation Uphold Democracy, Haiti 1994 Demonstrating its readiness again in September 1994, the regiment was called upon to take part in Operation Uphold Democracy in Haiti. As the main effort of the 82nd Airborne Division, the 504th, along with 2nd Battalion, 325th Airborne Infantry Regiment, was tasked to conduct an airborne assault to seize Port-au-Prince International Airport and to secure key objectives in Port-au-Prince and the surrounding area to oust Jean Bertrand Aristide. Several months of rigorous training had been conducted prior to the invasion. Less than three hours from drop time, however, the mission was terminated, and the aircraft returned with the 82nd units to Pope Air Force Base. Global War on Terror (Operations Enduring Freedom, Iraqi Freedom, and Freedom's Sentinel) In July 2002, 1-504 PIR deployed to Afghanistan with the Task Force (TF) Panther (3rd Brigade, 82nd Airborne Division) in support of Operation Enduring Freedom. Areas of operation included Kandahar, Bagram Air Base, FOB Shkin, FOB Salerno, FOB Asadabad, and others. In December 2002 to January 2003, TF Devil (1st Brigade, 82nd Airborne Division), including both 2-504 PIR and 3-504 PIR replaced TF Panther. In January 2003, 2-504 PIR was operating from FOB Panther, Dora, Baghdad, while the 3-504 PIR was operating from Kandahar Air Base, Afghanistan in support of Operation Enduring Freedom. The 1-504 PIR deployed again with TF Panther in September 2003 to Iraq in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom. Areas of Operation included FOB Murcury, Fallujah, Abu Ghraib (surrounding environs) and al Karma. In January 2004, TF Devil deployed to Iraq with 2-504 PIR and 3-504 PIR. The 2-504 PIR conducted operations in southern Baghdad, while most of 3-504 PIR conducted security of Balad Air Base, and Company C, 3-504 PIR conducted security of Cedar II near Talil Air Base. In July 2005, 2-504 PIR was operating in Afghanistan close to the Pakistan border. In October 2005, 1st Battalion, 504 Parachute Infantry Regiment \\"Red Devils\\" deployed to Kurdistan in Northern Iraq in order to establish and run a maximum security detention facility for high risk detainees. In September 2005, 3-504 deployed to Iraq to assist in providing security for the upcoming elections. The Blue Devils operated throughout the Al Anbar Province along the Euphrates River, in or near the cities of Haqlaniyah, Ramadi and Al Qaim. After the elections were complete the battalion was attached to USASOC in what was the first ever pairing of a battalion sized infantry unit to a USASOC task force and the beginning of the \\"Torch Mission.\\" The battalion conducted combat operations in and around Ramadi in support of task force objectives. The Blue Devils redeployed to Ft Bragg in late January 2006. Five paratroopers were killed in action during this deployment. In June 2006 the battalion was reflagged as the 1st of the 508th Parachute Infantry Regiment in the newly formed Fourth Brigade of the division. The 1-504 PIR with only one weeks' notice, deployed again in January 2007 to Baghdad as part of the surge and continued operations in Baghdad for 15 months. A U.S. Army paratrooper with the 82nd Airborne Division's 1st Brigade Combat Team fires at insurgents during a firefight 30 June 2012, Ghazni Province, Afghanistan. The 1st Brigade Combat Team, 82nd Airborne Division, minus the 1st Battalion, 504th PIR, deployed to Iraq in June 2007 and the Brigade (-) conducted operations in Southern Iraq for 14 months based at Talil Air Base and several smaller locations. The 2nd Battalion, 504th PIR, initially deployed to Al Asad Airbase and conducted area security operations until January 2008 when they joined the BCT at Talil Air Base to replace the Australian Battle Group. They conducted major operations in Basra and Al Amarah, Iraq until July 2008. The 1st Brigade Combat Team, including both 1st and 2nd battalions of the 504th PIR, deployed again to Al Anbar Province, Iraq, in August 2009 as the first Advise and Assist Brigade (AAB) in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom and redeployed in late July 2010. During the deployment, they trained and supported Iraqi Security Forces, helping to make the second national elections a success in Anbar, with few injuries and no loss of life. They also conducted parachute training jumps out of Al Asad Airbase. Roughly 2,500 of the 3,500-strong 1st Brigade Combat Team deployed to Afghanistan from March to September 2012 to spearhead the last major clearing operation of the war, fighting insurgent forces in southern Ghazni Province. The brigade conducted nearly 3,500 patrols, killed or captured 400 enemy combatants, found nearly 200 roadside bombs and weapons caches, and engaged the enemy over 170 times. Seven paratroopers were killed in action, including two with 1-504 PIR and two with 2-504 PIR. In February 2014 1-504 and 2-504 again deployed to Afghanistan. Most of 1-504 were stationed in Bagram Air Base as the Theatre Reserve Force for all of RC East. While A-1-504 was in FOB Ghazni conducting clearing operations and FOB defense patrols to disrupt Taliban forces while the retrograde was in full swing. 2-504 was in Kandahar Air Base providing Theatre Reserve Force for RC South and conducting security operations in RC West. 2 paratroopers from 1-504 were killed, with several others wounded. They re-deployed to Fort Bragg in November 2014. During the summer of 2017, 2-504 deployed to Afghanistan in support of Operation Freedom's Sentinel.

Biography  Capt. Blas Mar√≠a de la Garza Falc√≥n Villarreal, colonizer of South Texas and Tamaulipas and the first settler of Nueces County, Texas, was born in Real de las Salinas, Nuevo Le√≥n, Mexico, in 1712 to Gen. Blas Maria de la Garza Falc√≥n, twice governor of Coahuila, and Beatriz de Villarreal. His five brothers and six sisters spent their childhood at the hacienda Pesquer√≠a Chica near Monterrey. He probably received his education in Monterrey. By 1734 he was a captain at Presidio de San Gregorio de Cerralvo in Nuevo Le√≥n. On January 4, 1731, de la Garza Falc√≥n married Catarina G√≥mez de Castro, daughter of Capt. Antonio G√≥mez de Castro and Nicolasa Baes de Trevi√±o, at the mining town of Boca de Leones, present-day Villaldama, Nuevo Le√≥n. One daughter, Mar√≠a Gertrudis de la Garza Falc√≥n, and two sons, Juan Jos√© and Jos√© Antonio de la Garza Falc√≥n, were born to this marriage. After the death of Catarina, de la Garza Falc√≥n married Josefa de los Santos Coy, daughter of Nicol√°s de los Santos Coy, mayor of Cerralvo, and Ana Mar√≠a Guerra. No children were born to this marriage. In 1747 Jos√© de Escand√≥n, colonizer of the area which was then known as Nuevo Santander, chose de la Garza Falc√≥n to explore the south bank of the Rio Grande. de la Garza Falc√≥n led a contingent of fifty men from the presidio of Cerralvo to the mouth of the river. Escand√≥n's plan, as implemented by de la Garza Falc√≥n, was to establish seven settlements along the river‚Äî Revilla, Camargo, Mier, Dolores, Reynosa, Laredo, and Vedoya. On March 5, 1749, de la Garza Falc√≥n arranged for forty families from Nuevo Le√≥n to settle at Camargo on the banks of the Rio Grande. He founded the villa of Camargo, a presidio for the military squadron, and a mission, San August√≠n de Laredo, for the Indians. Escand√≥n named him captain and chief justice of Camargo, the first settlement founded on the Rio Grande. In 1752 de la Garza Falc√≥n established a ranch, Carnestolendas, now the site of Rio Grande City, Texas, on the north side of the river. After two unsuccessful attempts to settle and colonize land near the Nueces River, Escand√≥n gave the assignment to de la Garza Falc√≥n. By 1766 de la Garza Falc√≥n had established a ranching outpost named Santa Petronila five leagues from the Nueces River in what is now Nueces County, Texas. He took his family and employees there and started a ranching enterprise that served as a camp for the Spanish soldiers from Presidio Nuestra Se√±ora de Loreto who explored the vicinity while patrolling in 1767. The ranch, eight miles east of the Nueces River, served as an outpost and way station. In 1767 de la Garza Falc√≥n returned to Camargo, where he died and was buried in his private chapel, Nuestra Se√±ora de Guadalupe. After his death the land grants were distributed to the settlers; his family received land extending from the Rio Grande to the Nueces River in South Texas.TSHA Online - Texas State Historical Association References Category:Spanish soldiers Category:People from Nuevo Le√≥n Category:People of Spanish Texas Category:1712 births Category:1767 deaths Category:History of Texas Category:Spanish Texas ","title":"Blas Mar√≠a de la Garza Falc√≥n"},{"id":"3550083","text":"The Battle of Lemnos) was fought on the island of LemnosIt could also have been fought on an unnamed island near Lemnos. in 73 BC between a Roman fleet and a Mithridatic fleet; it was a decisive event during the Third Mithridatic War. The primary chroniclers of the battle are Appian, Cicero and Memnon, but there remain debates about the specifics in these different accounts.  Background  After his defeat at the hands of Lucius Cornelius Sulla during the First Mithridatic War (89-85 BC) Mithridates had rebuilt his power and armies.Philip Matyszak, Mithridates the Great, Rome's Indomitable Enemy, p. 99. In 74 BC, Nicomedes IV the king of Bithynia died, the Romans claimed he had left them his kingdom and took control of Bithynia.Philip Matyszak, Mithridates the Great, Rome's Indomitable Enemy, p. 100. Bithynia served as a buffer state between Rome and Pontus; feeling threatened Mithridates marched his armies westwards and invade Roman territory.Philip Matyszak, Mithridates the Great, Rome's Indomitable Enemy, p. 101. The Senate responded by sending the consuls Lucius Licinius Lucullus and Marcus Aurelius Cotta to deal with the Pontic threat.Anthon, Charles & Smith, William, A New Classical Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography, Mythology and Geography, 1860, p. 226. The plan was for Cotta to tie down Mithridates's fleet, while Lucullus attacked by land. Cotta stationed his fleet at Chalcedon, while Lucullus planned to march through Phrygia with the intention of invading Pontus. Lucullus had not advanced far when news came through that Mithridates had made a rapid march westward, attacked and defeated Cotta at the Battle of Chalcedon, and was now besieging him.Holmes, T. Rice, The Roman Republic and the Founder of the Empire, Vol. I, 1923, pg. 180; Appian Mithridates, 71; Plutarch. Lucullus, 8. Leaving Cotta under siege in Chalcedon, Mithidates moved on and started taking cities in Bithynia. Lucullus marched north and caught the Mithridatic army off guard besieging Cyzicus, he conducted a very effective counter-siege, blockading the Mithridatic army on the Cyzicus peninsula and let famine and disease do his work for him.Philip Matyszak, Mithridates the Great, Rome's Indomitable Enemy, pp. 111‚Äì112; Lee Fratantuono, Lucullus the Life and Campaigns of a Roman Conqueror, pp. 57‚Äì61; Appian, Mithridatica, 74; Plutarch, Life of Lucullus, 9‚Äì12. The Mithridatic army eventually broke through the blockade and tried to withdraw back to Pontus, Lucullus pursued them inflicting major losses on the Mithridatic forces at the battles of the Rhyndacus and the Granicus rivers.Lee Fratantuono, Lucullus: The Life and Campaigns of a Roman Conqueror, p. 60‚Äì61; Philip Matyszak, Mithridates the Great: Rome's indomitable enemy, p. 112. Prelude After defeating the Mithridatic land forces at the Siege of Cyzicus and the battles of the Rhyndacus and the Granicus, Lucullus moved to the Troad and the Hellespont to raise a fleet.Lee Fratantuono, Lucullus: The Life and Campaigns of a Roman Conqueror, p. 62; Philip Matyszak, Mithridates the Great: Rome's Indomitable Enemy, p. 113. He knew he had to defeat the Pontic navy before he could move on Pontus itself.Lee Fratantuono, Lucullus: The Life and Campaigns of a Roman Conqueror, p. 62; Philip Matyszak, Mithridates the Great: Rome's Indomitable Enemy, p. 114; Mithridates's admirals threatened Lucullus's supply lines across the Aegean. Here was informed that thirteen Mithridatic ships were headed to Lemnos. Lucullus was able to quickly mobilize and capture all 13 ships and execute Isidorus, the Pontic Admiral. Lucullus was then informed that the mass of the naval force was continuing towards Lemnos. The battle Once again, quickly mobilizing his fleet, he overtook the combined fleet of the Mithridatic admirals Marcus Marius/Varius,It is not clear whether he was called Marius or Varius. For more information consult the Marcus Marius article on Wikipedia. Alexander the Paphlagonian and Dionysius the Eunuch, near Lemnos.Lee Fratantuono, Lucullus: The Life and Campaigns of a Roman Conqueror, p. 62; Philip Matyszak, Mithridates the Great: Rome's Indomitable Enemy, p. 114. The Mithridatic commanders choose not to fight a sea battle, but instead defend against the Roman fleet off the coast of Lemnos; they drew up their ships on the beach and fought from their decks. Lucullus occupied his opponents attention with part of his fleet while secretly landing a contingent of troops on the other side of the island, when these made it across they attacked the Mitrhidatic forces from behind. The Romans captured or sunk 32 ships. Aftermath The next day the Romans found the three admirals hiding in a cave on the island. Dionysius had poisoned himself, Alexander was taken captive and preserved to walk in Lucullus's triumphal procession, while Marius/Varius was executed. Like Sertorius, Marius/Varius at some point had lost an eye; when Lucullus gave the order to track down enemy survivors, he specified that no one-eyed men should be killed, so that he could personally oversee the renegade's death: \\"Lucullus wished Marius/Varius to die under the most shameful insults.\\"Plutarch, Lucullus 12.5; Orosius, Against the Pagans 6.2.2. Lucullus sent letters with garland to the Roman Senate declaring his victory and was recognized with significant accolades before joining the forces against Mithridates in the Bosporus.

This view shows the 1859 addition to the building in the foreground. The pale yellow raised section in the background was a partial third story added to the original building in 1859. The Gaylord Building, constructed in 1838 in the downtown historic district of Lockport, Illinois, and on the canalside there, played a pivotal role in the construction of the Illinois and Michigan Canal. It is on the United States National Register of Historic Places, and is one of 29 Historic Sites of the National Trust for Historic Preservation. It is constructed of yellow limestone, a common construction material in north central Illinois. It has an Italianate three story addition added in 1859. After falling into disrepair, it was the focus of a concerted restoration and preservation effort that began in 1983, which was later noted as setting a model for such efforts. Background and construction The location and course of the Illinois and Michigan Canal. The Illinois and Michigan Canal, begun in 1836 and finished in 1848, and spanning 96 miles (154 km), was the last link in a waterway connecting the Great Lakes, the Gulf of Mexico via the Port of New Orleans and the Atlantic Ocean via the Port of New York. Lockport, situated about 1/3 of the way from the starting point (the Bridgeport neighborhood in Chicago on the Chicago River) and the end point (LaSalle, Illinois on the Illinois River), was a natural location for canal planning, staging and warehousing operations. The I&M; canal headquarters were thus in Lockport.This photo (and the next two in sequence) from the Lewis University site shows the old headquarters building, just uphill and across the tracks from the Gaylord Building Little progress on canal construction was made during the first two years, due to difficulties in securing supplies and manpower, most of which had to be brought from the East Coast. In the 1830s, this far west, most areas, even a few miles out from major settlements such as Chicago, were essentially wilderness, and Lockport had no warehouse large enough to house all the materials shipped in to foster canal construction, so the canal authorities decided to build one. There was some controversy at the time over the use of state funds to pay for it.Gaylord Building History : \\"Items stored in the warehouse included provisions, shovels, picks, wheelbarrows, lumber, ropes, iron and steel for making tools and machinery, chains, cordage, cranes, black powder and staple provisions for winter sustenance of the workmen.\\" The choice of material used, given the frontier nature of the town, was surprising to some. However this area of Illinois has large deposits of yellow limestone, in some cases just below the surface. Some sources say the building uses some stone taken directly from the canal excavation. The building was constructed between May and September 1838 under the supervision of acting Canal Commissioner Jacob Fry at a cost of USD $4,014.29, a substantial sum at the time. Use of yellow limestone may have started a trend.This image (from the Canal Corridor site) of downtown Lockport shows a lot of yellow limestone buildings, as does this one , taken looking across the Metra tracks from the building to downtown. Warehouse A side- by-side view of the original building (on the left) and the 1859 addition showing the dramatic difference in architectural styles. On completion of the canal in 1848 the building was surplus to requirements, so the Canal Board of Trustees briefly rented, and then sold, the building. It passed through a number of owners,Gaylord Building History : \\"After briefly renting it to the firm of Norton and Blackstone, which made thorough repairs on the building, it was sold in September 1848 for $4,000. Shortly afterwards the firm of Martin and Townsend rented out the space for grain storage, and by 1850 they were doing a booming business. George B. Martin purchased the building in November 1853.\\"this engraving shows the building shortly after the 1859 addition but was owned for a long period in the mid-19th century by George Gaylord (1820‚Äì1883), a prominent Lockport merchant,Canal Corridor site, Gaylord history page : \\" Gaylord had been in business long before he came to the building that now bears his name. Like many who rose to prominence in Illinois in the 19th century, George Gaylord had roots in the east. Born in White Hall, New York, Gaylord came to Illinois in 1839, finally settling in Lockport in 1847. Gaylord engaged in a variety of work, including farm laborer, school teacher and blacksmith before he and a partner (Dennis Smith), opened up a dry goods store in 1847. (Smith retired in the fall of 1849.) During the Civil War Gaylord went into the grain business in a big way, handling up to 400,000 bushels a year. According to one account, he was the first in Lockport to buy grain at legal weights, eventually convincing others to do the same. For a time Gaylord also owned Oak Hill Quarry just south of Lockport. In 1878 Gaylord bought the building from George B. Martin, the man behind the 1859 storefront addition.\\" Shortly after Gaylord's death Norton & Company, who owned other properties in Lockport, bought the building for $7,500. The many warehouses in Lockport were quite busy.This artist impression , from the Canal Corridor site, gives an idea of activity levels The 1859 addition was in a significantly different style. The property continued to change hands, going through many uses, as a warehouse,Canal Corridor site photo credited The Gaylord Building and busy Lockport Landing circa 1880 (courtesy of Gerald W. Adelmann) machine shop, foundry, printing facility, and finally (with an addition of a third story on the original section) a plumbing supply warehouse.Gaylord Building History : \\"The 1859 was used to store barbed wire in the 1880s. During the Barrows Lock Company era the building housed machine shops, a brass foundry, a carpentry shop, and storerooms. In 1945 the Will County printing Company had a specialty print shop here. From 1948 until the early 1980s the building was occupied by the Hyland Plumbing Supply Building.\\" Restoration In 1983 Gaylord Donnelley, George Gaylord's multimillionaire grandson and the retired chairman of Chicago's R. R. Donnelley & Sons publishing house, became interested in the building (reportedly on the urging of his niece). He formed a private development company, The Gaylord Lockport Company, named for Donnelley's grandfather, and spent four years and $2.8 million restoring the derelict building to its former beauty, including removing the third story and restoring the roofline as it was in 1859. At the same time, impetus was growingThe Encyclopedia of Chicago History site's Lockport page documents how \\"History became a focus of commercial development\\" starting in the 1960s, as Lockport saw the creation of museums, historic districts and even a 1970's rebranding as \\"the Old Canal Town\\". for the creation of a Heritage Corridor to document, preserve and interpret the I&M; Canal, and in 1984 President Ronald Reagan signed the legislation to create it. In 1987 the building opened to the public, featuring the Public Landing restaurant and a museum featuring canal exhibits. Reagan recognized the Gaylord Building and the project by personally presenting Mr. Donnelley with a President's Award for Historic Preservation, and the project and became a model for preserving historic sites for new uses. Management and location The National Trust for Historic Preservation now owns the Gaylord Building Historic Site and the Canal Corridor Association manages it as part of the Lockport National Historic District .This image from Maj.com shows the plaque designating the building as part of the Lockport National Historic District The building is a hub of canal exhibits, tours and programs.

His feast day is October 23.Bunson, Matthew et al., \\"Thwing, Blessed Thomas\\", Our Sunday Visitor's Encyclopedia of Saints, OSV Publishing, 2003 Early life His father was George Thwing, Esq. of Kilton Castle, Brotton, and Heworth Hall. His mother was Anne, daughter of Sir John Gascoigne and his wife Anne Ingleby, and sister of Sir Thomas Gascoigne, 2nd Baronet, of Barnbow Hall, Barwick in Elmet. Both parents were Yorkshire recusants. The martyr Edward Thwing was his great- uncle. Thomas was born at Heworth Hall, Heworth, York, and educated at St Omer and at the English College (Douai), ordained a priest and sent to minister at the English Mission in 1665, which he did for roughly 14 years.Challoner, Richard. \\"Thomas Thwing, Priest\\", Memoirs of Missionary Priests, Thomas Jones, 1842 Until April 1668, he was chaplain at Carlton Hall, the seat of his cousins, the Stapleton family. He opened a school at Quosque, the Stapletons' dower-house. He lived on Hepworth Lane, in Carlton, Selby. In 1677 Mary Ward's Institute of the Blessed Virgin Mary (IBVM) began its foundation in the house given to the order by Thomas' maternal uncle, Thomas Gascoigne, at Dolebank, where three of Father Thwing's sisters were members. Thwing became chaplain and it was there that he was arrested in early 1679.Whitfield, Joseph Louis. \\"Ven. Thomas Thwing.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia Vol. 14. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1912. 16 Aug. 2015 \\"Barnbow plot\\" At the time of the Titus Oates scare, or \\"Popish Plot\\", two servants, Bolron and Mowbray, who had been discharged from Sir Thomas Gascoigne's service for dishonesty, sought vengeance and reward by revealing a supposed plot by Gascoigne and others to murder King Charles II. At first the informers made no mention of Thwing. Nevertheless, Gascoigne, his daughter Lady Tempest, Thwing, and others were arrested on the night of 7 July 1679, and removed to London for trial at Newgate. Gascoigne sensibly demanded to be tried by a Yorkshire jury, whom the judges admitted were better equipped to decide on the credibility of witnesses, most of whom they knew personally, than were the judges themselves. The trial was postponed to the summer assizes. Thwing was brought to the bar on 29 July, and Gascoigne's former servant, Robert Bolron, testified against him. All of the accused were acquitted except Thwing, who was brought back to York, where he was arraigned at York on 17 March 1680, along with, among others, a kinsman, Sir Miles Stapleton. The prosecution played upon a list of Catholics which had been found on the night of the arrest. In reality they were not conspirators but supporters of the new convent at Dolebank which Gascoigne's daughter Lady Tempest had recently founded. At her father's trial the Court had heard much evidence about the convent, but the judges apparently did not regard her actions as treasonable, since at her own trial she was acquitted. Sir Miles Stapleton was also acquitted, as was another alleged conspirator, Mary Pressicks: the judges, showing far more impartiality than in earlier Popish Plot trials, ruled that her statement that \\"we shall never be at peace till we are all of the Roman Catholic faith\\" was not treasonable, but a simple expression of opinion. Despite the acquittal of Stapleton and Mrs. Pressicks, Thwing was promptly found guilty on the very same evidence upon which his relatives had been acquitted. Upon hearing the sentence, he humbly bowed his head, saying in Latin, \\"Innocens ego sum\\" (I am innocent). The King at first reprieved him, but owing to a remonstrance of the Commons the death- warrant was issued on the day after the meeting of Parliament. Thwing was hung, drawn, and quartered at the Tyburn in York on October 23, 1680. His friends interred his quartered body. John Philipps Kenyon observed that Thwing was executed for conspiracy, despite the logical difficulty of a conspiracy without any other conspirators.Kenyon, J.P., The Popish Plot, 1972 Posthumous Thomas Thwing was declared Venerable by Pope Leo XIII on 9 December 1886Pollen, John Hungerford. \\"Decree of the Sacred Congregation of Rites\\", Acts of English Martyrs Hitherto Unpublished, Burns and Oates, 1891 and beatified by Pope Pius XI on 15 December 1929 and henceforth known as the \\"Blessed Thomas Thwing\\".

Biography Born in the village of Yegorovo in the Ryazan Oblast Arkhipov (birth name Abram Efimov[ich] Pyrikov) left for the Moscow School of Painting, Sculpture and Architecture in 1877, where he would fall under the tutelage of various Russian artists including Vasily Perov, Vasily Polenov and Vladimir Makovsky. In 1883, Archipov went to study at the Imperial Academy of Arts at Saint Petersburg, he would stay there two years, before returning to complete his studies in Moscow. Some evidence suggests that Arkhipov's ancestors were poor Russified Jewish farmers who had moved to the Ryazan province Ryazan Oblast. Antisemitic contemporaries regarded Arkhipov, Ilya Repin and Isaac Levitan as Jewish aliens in Russian culture. Arkhipov was accepted into the art collective, The Wanderers in 1889, and joined the Union of Russian Artists in 1903. Themes that occur within his artwork include the lives of Russian women, with some of his realist paintings depicting their grim daily realities. Arkhipov also painted several paintings of peasant women in rural Russia, depicting them in vibrant traditional dresses and national costumes. Like others in the Union of Russian Artists, Arkhipov also painted regularly en plein air, travelling and painting scenes from the North of Russia and the White Sea coast. Arkhipov also taught at the Moscow School of Painting, Sculpture and Architecture where he was originally a student, and from 1922 through 1924 taught at Vkhutemas. Arkhipov joined the Association of Artists of Revolutionary Russia in 1924, and in 1927 was awarded the title of People's Artist of the USSR. Arkhipov died in Moscow in 1930.

He is the founder of the Kirloskar Group. He was born on 20 June 1869, in Gurlahosur, a village in Belgaum district of the erstwhile Bombay Presidency. Biography Laxmanrao, was a Maharashtrian Brahmin and his father Kashinathpant was a Vedant-Pandit. Therefore, the society also expected Laxmanrao to follow in the foot steps of his father. However, he broke away from the traditions and entered the field of engineering and technology. Laxmanrao was fond of two things: mechanical objects and painting. Against his father‚Äôs wish and with financial support from his eldest brother Ramuanna, Laxmanrao joined J J School of Art in Bombay in 1885. Unfortunately, he had to quit after 2 years as he was found to be partially color-blind. He gave up painting but continued to study mechanical drawing at the institute. This skill came handy and lead him to a position of Assistant Teacher of Mechanical Drawing at Victoria Jubilee Technical Institute (VJTI) on a salary of Rs. 45 per month. Sometime in early 1890s Laxmanrao started bicycle dealership ‚Äì he would buy bicycles in Bombay and send them to his brother Ramuanna in Belgaum where he would sell them. For a cycle of Rs. 700 to 1000 Ramuanna would also charge Rs. 15 for teaching how to ride. His first venture ‚Äì a small bicycle repair shop at Belgaum. The road on which he started the shop, is today named as Kirloskar Road. Strongly believing that agricultural implements must fit the milieu they are used in, he manufactured iron ploughs, the first Kirloskar products. He established a small unit in the former Aurangabad State for production of Chaff-cutters and manufacture of iron ploughs. In the early days, Kirloskar had to meet with opposition from farmers who believed that iron ploughs were poison to the land and make it useless. Superstitious farmers were extremely hard to convince and Laxmanrao Kirloskar took two years to sell his first iron ploughs. Laxmanrao Kirloskar could not find a suitable place for his workshop; help came from the Ruler of Aundh who offered him a place and arranging loan of seventeen thousand Indian rupees. In 1910, Laxmanrao started his factory in an arid waste land by the side of a renowned railway station, named Kundal Road. The factory now known as famous Kirloskar Industries and the station called as Kirloskarwadi. Laxmanrao Kirloskar was not only an industrialist but also a great social reformer. When blind orthodoxy was rampant in rural area, he advocated the removal of untouchability. He banned untouchability in the township that he had established at Kirloskarwadi which is in Sangli district. He believed in social reform and tristed in the goodness of man. He employed ex-convicts as night watchman. He had read about industrial townships in Europe and America where the owners of industries had built communities for the employees. His dream was to build his own industry and community for his employees; he realized this dream with Kirloskarwadi, a place where he started the Kirloskar Brothers Limited factory in 1910. Personal life Laxmanrao was married to Radhabai and had five children with her, sons Shantanurao, Rajaram, Prabhakar, Ravindra and a daughter. His wife died in.

C. Berkeley Life Vaught was a musical prodigy in his youth, in his case playing the piano. He began his university studies at Pomona College, at age 16. When World War II broke out, he enlisted into the US Navy, which assigned him to the University of California's V-12 program. He graduated in 1945 with an AB in physics. In 1946, he began a Ph.D. in mathematics at Berkeley. He initially worked under the supervision of the topologist John L. Kelley, writing on C* algebras. In 1950, in response to McCarthyite pressures, Berkeley required all staff to sign a loyalty oath. Kelley declined and moved his career to Tulane University for three years. Vaught then began afresh under the supervision of Alfred Tarski, completing in 1954 a thesis on mathematical logic, titled Topics in the Theory of Arithmetical Classes and Boolean Algebras. After spending four years at the University of Washington, Vaught returned to Berkeley in 1958, where he remained until his 1991 retirement. In 1957, Vaught married Marilyn Maca; they had two children. Work Vaught's work is primarily focused on model theory. In 1957, he and Tarski introduced elementary submodels and the Tarski‚ÄìVaught test characterizing them. In 1962, he and Michael D. Morley pioneered the concept of a saturated structure. His investigations on countable models of first- order theories led him to the Vaught conjecture stating that the number of countable models of a complete first-order theory (in a countable language) is always either finite, or countably infinite, or equinumerous with the real numbers. Vaught's \\"Never 2\\" theorem states that a complete first-order theory cannot have exactly two nonisomorphic countable models. He considered his best work was his paper \\"Invariant sets in topology and logic\\", introducing the Vaught transform. He is known for the Tarski‚ÄìVaught test for elementary substructures, the Feferman‚ÄìVaught theorem, the ≈Åo≈õ‚ÄìVaught test for completeness and decidability, the Vaught two-cardinal theorem, and his conjecture on the nonfinite axiomatizability of totally categorical theories (this work eventually led to geometric stability theory).

His work is noted for its anti-capitalism, anti-clericalism, anti-colonialism and anarchism. Drawings in a photo by Paolo Monti (1960) Biography As a young man Sin√© studied drawing and graphic arts, while earning a living as a cabaret singer. His first published drawing appeared in France Dimanche in 1952. Sin√© received the ' in 1955 for his collection Complainte sans Paroles. His series of drawings on cats was his breakthrough. He then started working for L'Express as a political cartoonist. Sin√©'s anti-colonialism caused controversy during the Algerian war. He was sued a number of times, being defended by Jacques Verg√®s, then a lawyer for the Algerian Liberation Front. In 1962 Sin√© left L'Express and published a book of his work called Sin√© Massacre, noted for its anti-colonialism, anti- capitalism, anti-clericalism and anarchism. In reviewing the book, the British satirical magazine Private Eye described Sin√©'s cartoons as \\"grotesque\\", and criticised publisher Penguin Books for its managerial incompetence.Private Eye #130 (9 December 1966), p. 3: In 1965 Sin√© became involved in a power struggle at Penguin Books. During an attempt by chief editor Tony Godwin and the board of directors to remove the company founder Allen Lane, Lane stole and burned the entire print run of the English edition of Sin√©'s book Massacre, which was reportedly deeply offensive.Narrated by Lane biographer Jeremy Lewis on BBC Radio in 2010, http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio/player/b00tjrgz In May 1968, together with Jean-Jacques Pauvert, Sin√© launched L'Enrag√©, a short-lived satirical journal associated with the May 1968 events in France. Death Sin√© died after undergoing surgery at a hospital in Paris on 5 May 2016, aged 87. He had been battling cancer for several years. Controversy and sacking In 1982, shortly after a terrorist attack had taken place on Jews in Paris, Sin√© gave an interview on the radio during which he stated: \\"Yes, I am anti-Semitic and I am not scared to admit it [...] I want all Jews to live in fear, unless they are pro-Palestinian. Let them die.\\" He later apologised for his comments. In July 2008, Sin√©'s column in the magazine Charlie Hebdo contained this comment on Jean Sarkozy's rumoured impending conversion to Judaism so he could marry a Jewish heiress of the wealthy Darty family, Jessica Sebaoun-Darty: \\"He'll go a long way in life, this lad!\\" Sarkozy and Sebaoun-Darty married but Sarkozy has affirmed that he did not convert to Judaism. The incident led to complaints of anti-Semitism and journalist Claude Askolovitch described the comments as anti-Semitic. The magazine's editor, Philippe Val, ordered Sin√© to write a letter of apology or face termination. The cartoonist said he would rather \\"cut his own balls off\\", and was promptly fired. Both sides subsequently filed lawsuits, and in December 2010, Sin√© won a 40,000-euro court judgment against his former publisher for wrongful termination.\\"Le Tribunal de Grande Instance donne raison √† Sin√© contre Charlie Hebdo\\", ActuaBD.com, 11 December 2010.

The inscription reads: > (front) To the more than one hundred million victims of communism and to > those who love liberty > (rear) To the freedom and independence of all captive nations and peoples Background A bill, H.R. 3000, sponsored by Representatives Dana Rohrabacher and Tom Lantos and Senators Claiborne Pell and Jesse Helms, to authorize the memorial passed unanimously on December 17, 1993 and was signed into law by President Bill Clinton, becoming Public Law 103-199 Section 905. It was backed by prominent conservatives including Lev E. Dobriansky, Grover Norquist, Zbigniew Brzezinski, and Lee Edwards. Because of delays in establishing the memorial, the authorization was subsequently extended through Section 326 of Public Law 105-277, approved October 21, 1998, until December 17, 2007. The Victims of Communism Memorial Foundation has the duty of funding and directing the first stages of planning the memorial. In November 2005, the National Capital Planning Commission gave approval to the monument's design. After raising over US$825,000 for construction and maintenance costs, the groundbreaking ceremony was held September 27, 2006. Dedication ceremony George W. Bush speaking at the memorial's dedication ceremony On June 12, 2007, the memorial was officially dedicated. Among the hundreds of invited guests were people from many countries who suffered hardships under Communist regimes, such as Vietnamese poet Nguyen Chi Thien, Chinese political prisoner Harry Wu, Lithuanian anti-communist journalist Nijolƒó Sad≈´naitƒó and others.(In Lithuanian) During the opening ceremony, President George W. Bush named some of those who suffered from Communism in anonymity: > They include innocent Ukrainians starved to death in Stalin's Great Famine; > or Russians killed in Stalin's purges; Lithuanians and Latvians and > Estonians loaded onto cattle cars and deported to Arctic death camps of > Soviet Communism. They include Chinese killed in the Great Leap Forward and > the Cultural Revolution; Cambodians slain in Pol Pot's Killing Fields; East > Germans shot attempting to scale the Berlin Wall in order to make it to > freedom; Poles massacred in the Katyn Forest; and Ethiopians slaughtered in > the \\"Red Terror\\"; Miskito Indians murdered by Nicaragua's Sandinista > dictatorship; and Cuban balseros who drowned escaping tyranny. President Bush also said, \\"We'll never know the names of all who perished, but at this sacred place, communism's unknown victims will be consecrated to history and remembered forever. We dedicate this memorial because we have an obligation to those who died, to acknowledge their lives and honor their memory.\\" Bush equated communism to the threat of terrorism then facing the U.S.: \\"Like the Communists, the terrorists and radicals who have attacked our nation are followers of a murderous ideology that despises freedom, crushes all dissent, has expansionist ambitions and pursues totalitarian aims.\\" On the first anniversary, there was another ceremony by the International Committee for Crimea. On June 9, 2011, a second commemoration ceremony was held with representatives of ethnic and religious groups who suffered under communist regimes.  Criticism by China and Russia  Statue by Thomas Marsh The Chicago Tribune reported the statue drew criticism from the Chinese embassy because the memorial evokes the Tiananmen Square protests. The embassy called its construction an \\"attempt to defame China.\\" The chairman of the Victims of Communism Memorial Foundation, conservative scholar Lee Edwards, said he was not aware of any official complaint. In response to criticism of China at the dedication ceremony, a Chinese foreign ministry speaker accused the US of pushing a \\"Cold War\\" thought and meddling in China's internal affairs, and issued a formal protest. Professor Andrei P. Tsygankov of San Francisco State University identifies the building of the statue as an expression of the anti- Russia lobby in Washington. He identifies it as a revival of Cold War symbolism.Andrei P. Tsygankov. Russophobia: anti-Russian lobby and American foreign policy. Macmillan, 2009. p.55 According to Professor Shi Yinhong of the Center of American Studies at the People's University of China, the monument was inappropriate: \\"In the history of socialist countries such as China and the Soviet Union, there were many dramatic events. In the capitalist countries, many bad things have also happened, but we do not erect monuments to the victims of capitalism.\\" A week after the unveiling of the monument and the speeches during the event, Russian President Vladimir Putin responded \\"We have not used nuclear weapons against a civilian population. We have not sprayed thousands of kilometers with chemicals, or dropped on a small country seven times more bombs than in all the Great Patriotic War.\\" In China, the PRC Foreign Ministry lodged stern representations at the United States in response to the inauguration of the statue. A Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman said that \\"there are political forces in the United States that still think in 'cold war' terms and seek to provoke conflicts between different ideologies and social systems.\\" He added that there should be an end by the U.S. of \\"interfering in the internal affairs of other countries, do more to promote dialogue and cooperation. Russian politician and legislator Gennady Zyuganov, leader of the Communist Party of the Russian Federation said that U.S. President Bush's appearance before the unveiling of the monument was a \\"clumsy propaganda attempt to divert the world public opinion's attention from the true, bloody crimes of U.S. imperialism in general and the current administration in the White House in particular.\\" Zyuganov also added that the monument was inappropriate: \\"How can an American president open it given the blood of civilians in Iraq, Afghanistan, Somalia, Serbs in Kosovo, Guantanamo Bay, as well as CIA prisons in Eastern Europe are part of the black list of crimes of the globalists.\\" In Ukraine, there was a response to open a museum for U.S. imperialism in Simferopol. Communist Party leader Leonid Grach stated, \\"[It] Is our response to George Bush, who opened the Victims of Communism Memorial in Washington, and to [pro-Western Ukrainian President] Viktor Yushchenko, who initiated the construction of the Museum of Soviet occupation in Kiev.\\" The museum focused on the repression of Native Americans, slavery, and racism. The museum also highlights interventions in foreign countries.

According to information collected from Gallia County Historical Society Director Mary Lee Marchi, when the original French 500 found Gallipolis Island in 1770, they discovered wild grapes. Those grapes were then used to produce a local wine that may have been one of the town's first exported products, along with bootleg rum and whiskey. In the 1840s, the island was turned into a kind of resort with beach access, a picnic area and a playground. In the 1860s, steamboats were made on the island.

Crenshaw campaigned for over 60 years to preserve parkland in Austin, Texas and supported Austin- area cultural institutions. Early life and education Roberta Purvis was born in Little Rock, Arkansas on April 17, 1914. She came to Austin, Texas in 1932 to attend the University of Texas. She graduated with a liberal arts degree and served the Zeta Tau Alpha sorority as president. She married cotton exporter and oilman Malcolm Hiram Reed, with whom she had two daughters. After his unexpected death in 1945, she married attorney Fagan Dickson, who she divorced in 1974. In 1975, she married lawyer Charles Edward Crenshaw, becoming stepmother to golfer Ben Crenshaw.  Career  Crenshaw was appointed by Austin City Council to the Parks Board in 1952, which was at that time under the Public Works Department. Crenshaw helped push for the parks department to be joined with the recreation department, and in 1963, the Austin Parks and Recreation Department was officially formed. Crenshaw served 12 years on the Parks Board, serving as chair from 1964-1969. In 1954, Crenshaw donated six acres of land to create Reed Park in Tarrytown. In the 1960s, as chair of the Parks Board, she spearheaded the effort to create parkland and a trail surrounding Town Lake. Crenshaw, who purchased nearly 400 shrubs and trees to spur development of parks along the lakefront, helped recruit Lady Bird Johnson to boost funding and support for the lake's beautification projects. Crenshaw also formed a coalition to prevent private developers to bring amusement parks to the lake. Crenshaw, while married to Fagan Dickson, owned a cattle farm in the East Riverside area called \\"Faro Farm\\". In 1973, the couple partnered with developers to redevelop the property into a large planned unit development called \\"The Crossing\\". Much of the development was not fully realized, and in 1984, Crenshaw donated more than of the land to the City of Austin to create the Colorado River Park, later renamed Roy G. Guerrero Park. In 1976, Crenshaw joined the board of a nonprofit group formed to save the Paramount Theatre, a building that she owned 50% of through a trust in her late husband's estate. Crenshaw donated her share to the nonprofit, who was able to secure funding to renovate the deteriorated theater. Crenshaw raised funds to create the Umlauf Sculpture Garden and Museum, which opened in 1991. In the 1990s, Crenshaw fought to convince the Texas Department of Transportation to fund and construct a pedestrian walkway under the MoPac Expressway bridge across the Colorado River, which opened in 2004. Up until her death, Crenshaw fought a 20-year battle to prevent private development on the site of the Seaholm Power Plant, which was ultimately redeveloped. Crenshaw was a founder and the first President of the Austin Ballet Society. She served as a trustee of the National Recreation and Park Association and was a member of the Heritage Society of Austin (now Preservation Austin), Austin History Center, Symphony Orchestra Society, Women‚Äôs Symphony League, Laguna Gloria Art Museum, and the Texas Nature Conservancy. Crenshaw also served on the advisory board for the UT School of Architecture and was an honorary member of the Austin AIA chapter. Legacy On July 18, 2004, the Austin City Council voted to designate the MoPac pedestrian bridge the \\"Roberta Crenshaw Pedestrian Walkway\\", which was dedicated on April 18, 2005. A plaque at the north entrance to the bridge notes her contributions to Austin's parks and culture. In 2016, the Paramount Theatre installed a life-size portrait of Crenshaw painted by Wayman Elbridge Adams, which formerly hung in her home.

Design and development The Lockheed XFV originated as a result of a proposal issued by the U.S. Navy in 1948 for an aircraft capable of vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL) aboard platforms mounted on the afterdecks of conventional ships. Both Convair and Lockheed competed for the contract but in 1950, the requirement was revised, with a call for a research aircraft capable of eventually evolving into a VTOL ship-based convoy escort fighter. On 19 April 1951, two prototypes were ordered from Lockheed under the designation XFO-1 (company designation was Model 081-40-01). Soon after the contract was awarded, the project designation changed to XFV-1 when the Navy's code for Lockheed was changed from O to V.Allen 2007. p. 14. The XFV was powered by a Allison YT40-A-6 turboprop engine driving three-bladed contra-rotating propellers. The tail surfaces were a reflected cruciform v-tail (forming an x) that extended above and below the fuselage. The aircraft had an ungainly appearance on the ground with a makeshift, fixed landing gear attached.Winchester 2005, p. 135. Lockheed employees derisively nicknamed the aircraft the \\"pogo stick\\" (a direct reference to the rival Convair XFY's name).Winchester 2005, p. 134. Testing and evaluation The first XFV-1 during a test flight at Edwards AFB To begin flight testing, a temporary non-retractable undercarriage with long braced V-legs was attached to the fuselage, and fixed tail wheels attached to the lower pair of fins. In this form, the aircraft was trucked to Edwards AFB in November 1953 for ground testing and taxiing trials. During one of these tests, at a time when the aft section of the large spinner had not yet been fitted, Lockheed chief test pilot Herman \\"Fish\\" Salmon managed to taxi the aircraft past the liftoff speed, and the aircraft made a brief hop on 22 December 1953. The official first flight took place on 16 June 1954. Full VTOL testing at Edwards AFB was delayed pending the availability of the 7,100 shp Allison T54, which never materialized. After the brief unintentional hop, the aircraft made a total of 32 flights. All further XFV-1 flights did not involve any vertical takeoffs or landings. The XFV-1 was able to make a few transitions in flight from the conventional to the vertical flight mode and back, and had briefly held in hover at altitude. Performance remained limited by the confines of the flight test regime. With the realization that the XFV's top speeds would be eclipsed by contemporary fighters and that only highly experienced pilots could fly the aircraft, the project was cancelled in June 1955.Allen 2007, p. 20. Salmon taxied the XFV-1 on its temporary gear \\"from a standing start to 175 mph, and then brought it back down to a dead stop without any use of the brakes, all within a distance of one mile.\\"American Aviation 27 Sept 1954 p34 Variants *XFO-1/XFV-1: (Model 081-40-01) Two prototypes built, one flown. *FV-2: Proposed production version (Model 181-43-02) was to have been powered by the T54-A-16 turboprop, incorporating a bullet-proof windshield, armor and radar in the fixed forward part of the nose spinner.

Helena is sited on lowlands between the Mississippi River and the eastern side of Crowley's Ridge. West Helena is located on the western side of Crowley's Ridge, a geographic anomaly in the typically flat Arkansas Delta.

The combined population of the two cities was 15,012 at the 2000 census and at the 2010 census, the official population was 12,282. The municipality traces its historical roots to the founding of the port town of Helena on the Mississippi River by European Americans in 1833. As the county seat, Helena was the center of a prosperous cotton plantation region in the antebellum years. Helena was occupied by the Union Army early in the American Civil War. The city was the site of the Battle of Helena fought in 1863. Confederate forces unsuccessfully tried to expel Union forces from Helena in order to help relieve pressure on the strategic river town of Vicksburg, Mississippi. Later in the year, Helena served as the launching point for the Union Army in the capture of Little Rock, the state capital. A thriving blues community developed here in the 1940s and 1950s as rural musicians relocated for city jobs. Mechanization had reduced the need for farm workers. The city continued to grow until the closing of the Mohawk Rubber Company, a subsidiary of Yokohama Rubber Company, in the 1970s. Unemployment surged shortly after.\\"Delta Dreams.\\" www.aetn.org.

Retrieved May 10, 2017. The city holds an annual King Biscuit Blues Festival each October. It has been held under this name since 2010, when it was renamed at a 25th-anniversary performance by musician B.B. King. History The city of Helena was founded by European Americans in 1833, as a port along the Mississippi River. Crowleys Ridge provided elevation and some protection against flooding, a rare feature along the right/west bank of the lower Mississippi River. During the Civil War, the Union Army occupied Helena prior to the Battle of Helena in 1863. In the early morning hours of July 4, 1863, Confederate forces attempted to retake Helena in order to help relieve pressure on the strategic river town of Vicksburg, Mississippi. Confederate forces in Vicksburg had already arranged to surrender to General U.S. Grant on the morning of July 4. Many of the former battle sites are still intact. Helena may benefit from developing and protecting these historic areas for destination tourism. Prior to consolidation, Helena contained 6,323 people within 23.1 km. Neighboring West Helena had 8,689 people in 11.5 km. Merger proposals began as early as 2002, and a March 2005 vote among citizens of both cities approved the merger. The surrounding rural county is one of the poorest of Arkansas' 75 counties. Proponents of the consolidation said that combining the cities would strengthen their bargaining power for the surrounding region in competing for projects to improve the overall economy and standard of living. Among the combined city's council's first tasks was the hiring of a new police chief. They chose Vincent Bell. Musical history In the 1940s and 1950s, Helena attracted blacks from rural Arkansas and the Mississippi Delta, who came for the jobs. Some also worked full-time as musicians. By then Helena was 70% black, and juke joints employed such blues pianist as Sunnyland Slim, Memphis Slim and Roosevelt Sykes. In November 1941, a white businessman put together the staff for the town's first radio station KFFA. A group of blues musicians were given a one-hour radio spot on the condition that they gain a sponsor. King Biscuit Flour agreed to do. The King Biscuit Entertainers were sponsored, as well as the show King Biscuit Time, featuring blues musicians. The King Biscuit Blues Festival was organized in the late 20th century as an annual October event. It was renamed as the Arkansas Blues and Heritage Festival in 2005, and is one of the largest blues festivals in the world. The celebration is held in downtown Helena on Cherry Street in early October. It was renamed in 2010 as the King Biscuit Blues Festival at a 25th anniversary performance of renowned musician B.B. King. The lyrics of \\"Stand Up Guy\\" by Mark Knopfler make reference to West Helena.

Economy With a median income of $19,896 for a household, the city is one of the poorest in the nation. One potential advance for the combined city, as reported by the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette on July 12, 2006, is an ethanol fuel refinery to be built by Las Vegas-based E-Fuels. Whether the consolidation had any bearing on the decision is not certain. If the project is developed, it is expected to bring several new jobs and a significant increase in traffic to the region's port on the Mississippi River. In 2006, the city announced plans to reopen the regional landfill, from which Helena‚ÄìWest Helena could earn fees. Helena‚ÄìWest Helena's chief economic base continues to be agriculture, specifically cotton cultivation. Mechanization and large industrial farms have reduced the need for farm labor since the first half of the 20th century. Barge traffic at the city's port on the Mississippi River is another source of jobs and revenues, in addition to retail and tourism. Media The Helena- West Helena World is the local newspaper.

Geography Grindon is situated near the southern end of the Peak District National Park. It is at the top of the western edge of the limestone bank of the Manifold Valley, south of Butterton and opposite Wetton on the eastern side of the valley. A comparison of two views north from the village gives some indication of the bleakness of this area in winter. The nearer village, left of centre, is Butterton, while the far skyline is of Derbyshire. The river crossing between Grindon and Wetton is known as The Weags. The slope down to the Manifold is very steep on both sides, with several hairpin-bends on the road. A little downstream from The Weags is the confluence with the River Hamps, which flows from Waterhouses, and is the main tributary of the Manifold. Opposite this is Beeston Torr, a rock face popular with climbers. This section of the Manifold, and also the Hamps, runs dry for much of the year. The Manifold goes underground near Wetton Mill, and rises at Ilam. The Village Much of the village is built of gritstone. There is a Parish Church and until recently a public house (The Cavalier) now a private house, but few other facilities. The main industry is farming, now supplemented by tourism. However, the village is, by modern standards, remote and \\"off the beaten track\\". Also, much of the land in the locality is either moorland (to the west) or the steep slope down to the River Manifold. Farming is relatively unproductive, mainly suited to sheep and cattle. All Saints Church All Saints Parish Church The Parish Church is a typical village church with a tower topped with an elegant spire which makes a conspicuous landmark from across the Manifold Valley. From this it received the nickname \\"the Cathedral of the Moorlands\\". The present building was built in 1848. The first church in Grindon was built in the 11th century as a chapel of ease for the Parish of St Bartram, Ilam.Church of England A Church Near You web site One of the rectors of Grindon parish was Anthony Draycot who served from 1540 to his imprisonment in 1560. Draycott was the judge at the heresy trial of Joan Waste.Gordon Goodwin, ‚ÄòDraycot, Anthony (d. 1571)‚Äô, rev. Andrew A. Chibi, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004 accessed 28 Feb 2009 The Church is decorated with an interesting selection of stone carvings both inside and outside. While most of these are human heads, there are other animals, such as those climbing down the window frame on the south-west corner of the tower. The War Memorial tablet inside the Church shows those of the village who fought in World War I. 23 men served, of whom 5 were killed and 18 returned to the village. The Parish, in the Diocese of Lichfield, is in the Alstonefield Deanery, and now part of a Parish group. The Vicar lives at Waterhouses (December 2008). The associated Parishes are Calton St. Mary; Grindon All Saints; Okeover All Saints; Waterfall St. James and St. Bartholomew; Blore Ray St. Bartholomew; and Cauldon St. Mary and St. Laurence.Waterfall Benefice web page History and tourism Grindon was served by a railway station which was opened by the Leek and Manifold Valley Light Railway on 27 June 1904, whilst being entirely operated by the North Staffordshire Railway. The village was a little distance from the station, and the fact that the line followed the valley bottom whereas the settlements served by the railway were mostly on the hill-tops above was a contributory factor in its demise. The line closed in 1934, but in 1937 the route was reopened as the Manifold Way, a fully tarmacked 8-mile walk- and cycle-path which runs from Hulme End in the north to Waterhouses in the south. The severe winter of February to April 1947 brought particular hardship for moorlands villages like Grindon. Relief was brought by air, but one RAF Halifax aircraft crashed into the moors near Grindon during a severe blizzard. A memorial to the crew and passengers is in the Church.A Church Near You Grindon history page Additional photos These pictures show some examples of the carvings around the porch of All Saints Church building. There is a wide variety of carved heads around the building, both inside and outside. Most of the windows, at least along the Nave, have the scroll carvings but a window with carved heads may be seen above the clock. The sundial is above the porch, which is the south door entrance. Two interesting carved animals are climbing down one corner of the tower. The sense of movement shows the skill of the artisans. These carved heads are on each side of the porch.

The film features an ensemble cast that includes Andy Garc√≠a, Christopher Lloyd, Treat Williams, Steve Buscemi, Christopher Walken, Fairuza Balk and Gabrielle Anwar. The film's title comes from a Warren Zevon song of the same name, recorded on his 1991 album Mr. Bad Example, which he allowed under the condition that the song be played during the end credits. The lead character's name, \\"Jimmy the Saint,\\" comes from the Bruce Springsteen song \\"Lost in the Flood\\" from the album Greetings from Asbury Park, N.J. The film was screened in the Un Certain Regard section at the 1995 Cannes Film Festival. The film was a box office bomb and received negative reviews from critics, with many dismissing as a \\"Pulp Fiction clone\\". Plot Trying to go straight, ex-gangster Jimmy \\"The Saint\\" Tosnia runs Afterlife Advice in Denver, where dying people videotape messages for their loved ones. His business isn't doing well and his former boss, a local crime lord known as \\"The Man With The Plan,\\" has bought up his debt in order to command a favor involving the crime lord's son, Bernard, who has been arrested for child molestation. The Man With The Plan, who was left a quadriplegic after an attempt on his life, wants Jimmy to persuade Bernard's ex-girlfriend Meg to come back to him; The Man With the Plan believes this will cure Bernard of his pedophilia. A reluctant Jimmy recruits his friends Easy Wind, Pieces, Big Bear Franchise and the rage-prone Critical Bill. The plan is to have Pieces and Critical Bill pose as police officers, intercept Meg's current boyfriend, Bruce, and intimidate him until he agrees to break up with Meg. Things go wrong when Bruce grows suspicious of the two men's identities and mocks them, whereupon Critical Bill stabs Bruce in the throat. The commotion wakes up Meg, sleeping in the back of Bruce's van. Meg's appearance startles Pieces, who accidentally shoots her dead. The Man With The Plan is furious at the outcome of their botched mission. He informs Jimmy that he will allow him to live, as long as he leaves Denver, but his crew have been sentenced to \\"buckwheats\\" to be assassinated in a gruesome and painful manner. Jimmy's friends come to terms with their impending deaths as they are stalked by a hit man, Mr. Shhh, who never fails. Pieces accepts his fate, with Mr. Shhh providing a quick death. Easy Wind goes into hiding with a gang lord called Baby Sinister, but is given up after Mr. Shhh infiltrates and kills most of Sinister's entourage. Because Franchise has a family to raise, Jimmy pleads with The Man With The Plan to spare his life. The Man With The Plan agrees to Jimmy's terms but betrays him anyway by having Franchise killed. The betrayal makes Jimmy vengeful; in turn, Jimmy is also sentenced to die. Mr. Shhh finally locates Critical Bill holed up in his apartment, but is ambushed by Bill and the two end up killing each other. In the wake of Mr. Shhh's death, the contract on Jimmy falls to a trio of Mexican brothers. In his final hours, Jimmy says goodbye to a young woman he had fallen in love with, Dagney. Knowing that he will most likely be killed, Jimmy murders Bernard for all the misery he indirectly brought upon the group. He also impregnates Lucinda, a prostitute, in order to fulfill her wish of becoming a mother. In a pre- recorded Afterlife Advice video, Jimmy gives life advice to his unborn child. The trio of killers catches up to Jimmy and he takes his death gracefully. The Man With The Plan is seen mourning his son's death. Jimmy and his friends are then seen together having \\"boat drinks\\" in the afterlife.

He is best known for his plan for an expedition to the Manchu Qing dynasty, and his campaigns against the Russian Empire at the request of the Qing dynasty. His plan for the northern expedition was never put into action since he died before the campaign started. Biography=Birth and background King Hyojong was born in 1619 as the second son of King Injo, while his father was still a prince. In 1623, when the Westerners faction (Ë•ø‰∫∫) launched a coup that removed then- ruling Gwanghaegun and crowned Injo, Hyojong was called to the palace along with his father and given the title Bongrimdaegun (Grand Prince Bongrim) in 1626. Captive of the Qing dynasty In 1627, King Injo's hard-line diplomatic policy brought war between Korea and Manchus. Later, in 1636, the Manchus (Qing dynasty) defeated Joseon, and King Injo pledged his loyalty to the Qing emperor at Samjeondo, bowing down at Hong Taiji's feet nine times. There, Injo and Hong Taiji signed a treaty, which included that Manchus would take Crown Prince Sohyeon, Injo's oldest son, and Hyojong to China as captive. During his exile in China, Hyojong mostly tried to defend his older brother from the threats of the Qing dynasty. Hong Taiji and his Manchu forces were still at war against the Chinese Ming dynasty and also engaged in battle with the Mongols and Chinese Muslims; and many times, the Qing emperor requested Prince Sohyeon to go to the battlefield and help command troops against the Manchus' enemies. However, Hyojong was worried about his brother because he was the official heir to the throne of Joseon and had no military experience. He went on to fight the Chinese in his brother's place, and he also followed Sohyeon to battles against the Uyghurs and Muslims on the western front. Along with his brother, he made contact with Europeans while he was in China; and also he learned that Joseon needed to develop new technology and a stronger political and military system in order to protect itself from foreign powers. He also developed a grudge against Qing dynasty, which separated him from his home country and his family. It was during this period that he decided to make a massive plan for northern campaigns against the Manchus, an act of vengeance on the Qing dynasty for the war of 1636. Enthronement In 1645, Crown Prince Sohyeon returned to Joseon alone, in order to succeed Injo to the throne and to help Injo to govern the nation. However, he often came into conflict with Injo, who disliked Sohyeon's open view of European culture and diplomatic views of the Qing dynasty. Soon he was found dead at the King's room, and buried quickly after a short funeral. Later, Injo also executed Sohyeon's wife who tried to find out the real reason for her husband's death. Legends say that Injo killed his own son with an ink slab that the Crown Prince brought from China. Rather than selecting Crown Prince Sohyeon's oldest son, Prince Suk Chul, as the next royal successor, Injo selected Grand Prince Bong Rim and gave him the title of Crown Prince. When King Injo died in 1649, Hyojong inherited the throne, becoming the 17th monarch of Joseon. Northern campaigns After rising to the throne, he began to reform and expand the military of Korea; first he removed Kim Ja-jeom, who had corrupted politics and had greater power than the king himself. Then, he called Song Si-yeol (Hangul: ÏÜ°ÏãúÏó¥ Hanja :ÂÆãÊôÇÁÉà) and Kim Sang-heon to his court, who supported war against the Qing Dynasty. His military expansion was massive, and he also built several border fortresses along Yalu River where Joseon and Qing shared a border. When a band of Dutch sailors including Hendrick Hamel drifted on Jeju Island, Hyojong ordered them to build muskets for the army, providing muskets to the Koreans for the first time after the Seven Year War. However, the Qing dynasty continued to thrive, expanding quickly into the west after successfully conquering the Ming in 1644. The campaign was unable to be put in action, since the Manchus assimilated the massive Chinese army into their own. The Joseon military, although reformed and expanded, was no match against the combined Manchu and Chinese forces. Also, the Qing dynasty began to treat Joseon as its friend and closest ally. The expanded military was first put into action in 1654, when the Qing Dynasty called for help to fight against invading Russians. 150 Joseon musketeers, along with 3,000 Manchus, met the Russian army at the Battle of Hutong (Hangul : Ìò∏ÌÜµ Hanja : Â•ΩÈÄö), present-day Yilan, which was won by the Qing‚ÄìJoseon allied forces. Four years later, in 1658, Hyojong sent troops once again to help Qing dynasty against Russia; 260 Joseon musketeers and cannoners led by Shin Ryu joined the forces of Ninguta Military Governor Sarhuda, the joint force sailed down the Hurka and Sungari Rivers and met the Russian forces under command of an Amur Cossack, Onufrij Stepanov near the fall of the Sungari River into the Amur, killing 270 Russians and driving them out of Manchu territory. The battles against Russia proved that Hyojong's reform had stabilized the Joseon army, although they were never put into action again. Despite the campaigns, Russia and Joseon remained on good terms. The Northern campaign is known as Naseon Jeongbeol (Hangul: ÎÇòÏÑ†Ï†ïÎ≤å Hanja : ÁæÖÁ¶™ÂæÅ‰ºê), or \\"Suppression of the Russians\\"). Other accomplishments During his reign, many books about farming were published to promote agriculture, which had been devastated during the Seven Year War. Hyojong also continued Gwanghaegun's reconstructions; he had a hard time restoring the economy at the same time as expanding the military. He also had to make more coins with metals which could have been used to make ammunitions, but had to give them up in order to rebuild his kingdom. He had too much stress dealing with numerous problems inside and outside of the country, and died at the early age of 40 in 1659. Although his plan for northern conquest was never put in action, many people regard him as a brilliant and brave ruler who dedicated his life to serving his nation.

He is a former member of the superhero team Alpha Flight. He first appeared in Alpha Flight: In The Beginning #-1, and first appeared as Radius in Alpha Flight vol. 2 #1 (both published in 1997). Fictional character biography Jared and his younger half-brother Adrian (later codenamed Flex) were raised in the Hull House orphanage, which was actually a facility operated by the Canadian government's secretive Department H. While Adrian became shy, reserved and bookish, Jared became athletically inclined, aggressive, and arrogant. Both brothers manifested mutant powers after puberty: Adrian gained the ability to transform parts of his body into blades, while Jared manifested a personal force field that could not be shut down. Jared rejects the initial flirtations of his teammate Murmur for personal reasons. Later, he is sent with to corral the mutant Wolverine, whom the entire team believes has killed the ex-Alpha Flight member Box. This was part of the lies and mind-control that Department H was using on the entire team. Jared's bravado, when the team corrals Wolverine, is met with shock by Adrian, who has a high level of respect for the man. Jared stands up to Wolverine's intimidation tactics but soon fight breaks out anyway. Backup X-Men soon join in. It is Adrian, though, who calms things down by wanting to talk instead of fight. Various discrepancies in the mission lessen the Alphans desire to do battle. The brothers were recruited into a new incarnation of the Canadian superhero team Alpha Flight. They assist the new Alpha Flight in battling several foes, including the Zodiac organization and the Brass Bishop. The Bishop is found by Alpha Flight after many innocent civilians go missing. He has brainwashed them and is building a Tower of Babel, an enormous structure that is intended to reach heaven. The team also confronts Department H's own power-mad leader, Jeremy Clarke, who dies of radiation poisoning during a Zodiac raid on the Department H headquarters. Their Alpha Flight team fight several members of the original Flight and later team up with them to defeat a new Weapon X, who had been created by a rogue Department H scientist. Both groups of Alphans merged into a unified Alpha Flight following this adventure. The Corbo brothers and several other members of the new team were later reassigned to Alpha Flight's trainee team, Beta Flight. Radius is later hired by X-Corps, a militaristic strike force founded by former Generation X headmaster and former X-Man Sean Cassidy, a.k.a. Banshee. The X-Corps was ultimately betrayed by its criminal members. Radius is defeated when the villain Avalanche opens a chasm beneath him. Jared survived the fall, though, and has been shown as one of the many depowered mutants in the aftermath of M-Day.New Avengers #18 It was later revealed that Unus the Untouchable was Radius' father after Flex starts searching for their fathers through their adoption agency.Alpha Flight vol. 2 #10 It has long been rumored that Carmella Unuscione of the Acolytes is the daughter of Unus. It is currently unknown if the two are siblings, some other relation or altogether unrelated. Powers and abilities Radius, before being depowered, could generate a permanent force field around him. He does not feel the impact of blows upon it. While the shield is generally porous enough for him to breathe, he can make it almost impervious, even to air. He could also create extensions of the field to use as a ranged attack, and brace objects against it to \\"fake\\" super- strength.

It is the 28th and final Abbott and Costello film produced by Universal-International. Plot Two Americans, Bud Abbott and Lou Costello, who are stranded in Cairo, Egypt, happen to overhear Dr. Gustav Zoomer (Kurt Katch) discussing the mummy Klaris, the guardian of the Tomb of Princess Ara. Apparently the mummy has a sacred medallion that shows where the treasure of Princess Ara can be found. The followers of Klaris, led by Semu (Richard Deacon), overhear the conversation along with Madame Rontru (Marie Windsor), a businesswoman interested in stealing the treasure of Princess Ara. Abbott and Costello go to the doctor's house to apply for the position to accompany the mummy back to America. However, two of Semu's men, Iben (Mel Welles) and Hetsut (Richard Karlan), murder the doctor and steal the mummy just before Abbott and Costello arrive. The medallion has been left behind, though, and is found by Abbott and Costello, who attempt to sell it. Rontru offers them $100, but Abbott suspects it is worth much more and asks for $5,000, which Rontru agrees to pay. She tells them to meet her at the Cairo Caf√©, where Abbott and Costello learn from a waiter that the medallion is cursed. They frantically try to give it to one another (the Slipping the Mickey routine from The Naughty Nineties), until it winds up in Costello's hamburger and he swallows it. Rontru arrives and drags them to a doctor's office to get a look at the medallion under a fluoroscope. However, she cannot read the medallion's inscribed instructions, which are in hieroglyphics. Semu arrives, claiming to be an archaeologist, and offers to guide them all to the tomb. Meanwhile, Semu's followers have returned life to Klaris. They arrive at the tomb, where Costello learns of Semu's plans to murder them all. Rontru captures Semu, and one of her men, Charlie (Michael Ansara), disguises himself as a mummy and enters the temple. Abbott follows suit by disguising himself as a mummy, and he and Costello rescue Semu. Eventually all three mummies are in the same place at the same time, and the dynamite that Rontru intends to use to dig up the treasure detonates, killing Klaris and revealing the treasure. Abbott and Costello convince Semu to turn the temple into a nightclub to preserve the legend of Klaris and the three criminals who wanted to steal the treasure are presumably arrested.

The business became the International Harvester corporation after his death. Although he died relatively young with most of the fame going to his brothers, his extended McCormick family continued to be influential in the politics and business of Chicago. Life William Sanderson McCormick was born November 2, 1815 on the family estate known as Walnut Grove, in Virginia. His father was Robert McCormick (1780‚Äì1846) and mother Mary Ann (Hall) McCormick. He was educated in public schools and took an interest in business. When the family farm had financial problems in the panic of 1837, he took over its management and made it profitable again. When his father died in 1846, his older brother Cyrus McCormick and younger brother Leander J. McCormick left to start a factory to produce the mechanical reapers that had been developed on the farm, while he was left to take care of the estate. Career In 1850, William, his wife, and infant son moved to Chicago to join his brothers in the family business, first on a salary basis. The California Gold Rush had created a labor shortage, which was good for demand, but also caused turnover in the factory employees. William managed the day-to-day operations of the business while Cyrus was often traveling or pursuing patent infringement lawsuits. William tried to mediate between Cyrus (who claimed all the credit as \\"inventor\\") and his brother Leander, who was now in charge of technical aspects of product development. In 1859, he negotiated a formal agreement giving him and Leander one fourth interest in the company, and renamed it \\"C. H. McCormick & Brothers.\\" The onset of the American Civil War brought new demand, but stress from another labor shortage. McCormick bought real estate in downtown Chicago which proved to be a wise investment. The family was attacked in the press as being southern sympathizers. In fact, the family never adjusted to the brutal cold of winters in Chicago. Brother Cyrus worsened the conflict by funding conservative newspapers to battle the liberal major publishers that were tied to local politicians. Cyrus traveled to Europe in 1864 where he successfully promoted international sales. Personal life He married Mary Ann Grigsby (1828‚Äì1878) on July 11, 1848, daughter of Virginia planter Reuben Grigsby of Hickory Hill plantation. Together, William and Mary were the parents of five children: * Robert Sanderson McCormick (1849‚Äì1919), who married the daughter of Chicago Tribune publisher Joseph Medill. He served as U.S. Ambassador to Austria-Hungary, Russia and France. * William Grigsby McCormick (1851‚Äì1941), who married Eleanor Brooks on October 23, 1873 and had seven children. He was one of the five founders of the Kappa Sigma Fraternity at the University of Virginia in 1869. * Emma Louise McCormick (1854‚Äì1893), who married Wisconsin politician Perry H. Smith on June 18, 1878. * Anna Reubenia \\"Ruby\\" McCormick (1860‚Äì1917), who married Edward Tyler Blair (1857‚Äì1939) on May 29, 1882. * Lucy Virginia McCormick (1865‚Äì1928), who married lawyer Samuel Rountree Jewett (1862‚Äì1922), on October 9, 1888. Outwardly, McCormick was described as \\"of a cheerful disposition, quick spoken, ... a most interesting and agreeable man\\". However, he suffered from \\"nervous dyspepsia\\" and his mental state deteriorated. Various treatments for his mental illness such as bland diets or water cures proved ineffective. In April 1865 he stated simply to Cyrus \\"I am extremely nervous\\". He continued to manage the business until checking into the Illinois State Asylum in Jacksonville, Illinois in August 1865. He died there on September 27, 1865. His widow cashed in her share of the business, moved back to Virginia, and left the children with their uncles in Chicago. He was buried in Graceland Cemetery, and replaced as general manager by Charles A. Spring, Jr. Descendants Through his son Robert, he was the grandfather of Joseph Medill McCormick (1877‚Äì1925), a U.S. Senator from Illinois, and Robert R. McCormick (1880‚Äì1955), the publisher of the Tribune, which had been a major attacker of the family during the war. Through his son William, he was the grandfather of Chauncey Brooks McCormick (1884‚Äì1954), and the great-grandfather of Brooks McCormick (1917‚Äì2006), who was the last McCormick to lead the family firm. Through his daughter Ruby, he was the grandfather of financier William McCormick Blair (1884‚Äì1982) and great- grandfather of William McCormick Blair Jr. (1916‚Äì2015), who served as U.S. Ambassador to Denmark from 1961 to 1964 and as the Philippines from 1964 until 1967.

The parish has a population of 94,410. During the nineteenth century, the parish was an area of sugar cane plantations, with a majority of black enslave descendant after the abolition of slavery. The Morant Bay Rebellion started on October 11, 1865, with a march by hundreds of peasants from the parish to the court house to protest poor conditions in the parish. After seven men were shot and killed by volunteer militia, the peasants burned the court house and other nearby buildings; a total of 25 people died on both sides in this confrontation.Clinton Hutton, \\"Review: 'The Killing Time': The Morant Bay Rebellion in Jamaica by GAD Heuman, Social and Economic Studies Vol. 44, No. 1 (MARCH 1995), pp. 191-205, via JSTOR; accessed 13 July 2016 Over the next two days, hundreds of black peasants took control throughout the parish. The governor ordered troops to arrest and suppress the rebels; they killed more than 400 persons outright and arrested more than 300, in both cases including many innocent people. Many of those arrested were executed, flogged or sentenced to long terms. This was the only major peasant revolt (as distinguished from slave rebellions and worker uprisings), in Jamaican history. The court house was rebuilt. It stood until 2007, when it was burned down. Court functions were held in other facilities before a new court house was completed and opened in 2014. Morant Bay's sister cities are Uxbridge, Ontario, Canada and Hartford, Connecticut, United States. Morant Bay is the birthplace of Miss World 2019 Toni-Ann Singh. Attractions *Memorial Garden Opposite the court house is a memorial garden for Jamaican soldiers who lost their lives during World War I. A monument has been erected at the centre of the gardens in their honour. *Morant Bay Fort Behind the court house is a small park containing the ruins of the Morant Bay Fort. The fort dates from 1758 and was designed to hold nine guns. Three cannons remain there today. During an excavation behind the court house in 1973 in the park, the bodies of 79 people were discovered. They are believed to have been killed during the 1865 rebellion. Their remains were reinterred in a mass grave in the park. A plaque was installed to commemorate their lives. *Morant Bay Court House The Morant Bay rebellion began as a protest outside the court house. The court house was set on fire during the rebellion but was rebuilt afterwards. This historic court house was later destroyed by fire in 2007. A statue of Paul Bogle sculpted by Edna Manley (wife of former Premier of Jamaica Norman Manley and mother of former Prime Minister of Jamaica Michael Manley), had been installed outside the court house, but was put into storage after the 2007 fire. A new court house was completed and opened in August 2014.\\"Justice Minister hands over new Morant Bay courthouse\\", Jamaica Observer, 3 August 2014; accessed 13 July 2016 \\"The 9,013 square-foot building includes two courtrooms with jury boxes, two judges‚Äô chambers, a registry, clerk‚Äôs office, jury room, witness room, lunch room, sick bay, holding area with police post, public sanitary facilities, and a 40 feet container for storage of files and accommodation for the bailiff.\\" *St. Thomas Parish Church Located to the West of the Court House.

It overlooks the Manifold Valley and Ecton Hill, which rises 1,212 feet above sea level. Butterton lies 5 miles east of Leek and roughly 8 miles from Alton Towers theme park. The village is just west of the limestone area, and so is mainly built of local sandstone. It contains a Grade II listed church. In the centre of Butterton there is an unusual ford where the Hoo Brook runs along the village street. Butterton was served by a railway station which was opened by the Leek and Manifold Valley Light Railway on 27 June 1904. The line closed in 1934, and the route of the railway past the station is now designated the Manifold Way, a footpath and cycle route. Butterton is one of the Thankful Villages that suffered no fatalities in the Great War of 1914‚Äì1918.  Demography  According to the 2001 census, the population of Butterton was 213, with a near equal number of males and females. This was lower than in 1841, where the population was 388. In modern times, most of the houses in Butterton are detached or semi-detached and owner-occupied, with the largest age category being 45 to 64.  History  The name ‚ÄòButerdon‚Äô or ‚ÄòButterton‚Äô comes from ‚Äòbutere‚Äô, meaning butter, and ‚Äòdun‚Äô meaning hill, and was given this name as the area had good pasture. Butterton is also known as Butterton- in-the-Peak to differentiate it from Butterton in Trentham parish, near Newcastle-under-Lyme. In the 1850s, a small brook at the foot of the village was a sulphurous spring which was said to be beneficial in scorbutic cases. Although Butterton was in Mayfield parish it was physically separated from the remainder of the parish by nine miles. The parish was enlarged on 1 April 1934 by 205 acres to include part of Bradnop and Cawdry.University of Portsmouth et al. (2009). Staffordshire Place Guide: Butterton. Retrieved on 13.02.12 from http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/place/place_page.jsp?p_id=7976&st;=BUTTERTON In 1966, however, the parish broke up into smaller segments, and so now Butterton is a parish of its own.  Economy  Ecton Hill, near Butterton, is embedded with the remains of copper and lead mining. It was first used extensively in the mid 17th century; however, there is evidence that mining of the area took place centuries earlier. As a result of the history of mining, there are numerous packhorse routes around Butterton and Ecton Hill which were used to transport copper and lead ore from Ecton to smelting works. In 1881, the main employment was agriculture, with 51 out of 124 inhabitants in this sector (all males). The main employment for women was domestic service. Although Butterton is a commuter village, in 1986 there were a few shops, such as a butcher's, a general store and a small shop and tea room. There is also an old traditional pub in the centre of the village, The Black Lion Inn, which offers food and accommodation. The first mention of a post office in the village is in 1892, when a rubber datestamp was issued.  Landmarks = The Hillocks  On Ecton hillside is the unusual copper-topped house known as The Hillocks which was built in 1933 by Arthur Ratcliffe, the MP for Leek. When first constructed the property had two storeys with a flat roof, but this leaked water badly and so another storey was added.  St Bartholomew's Church = Education  The small village primary school closed in 1979, as there were too few pupils to attend. The nearest primary school today is in Warslow (3 miles away); public transport is funded by the county education committee. There is a secondary school in nearby Leek, to which transport is also provided. The former primary school building has now become the village hall.  Culture and community  The Butterton Wakes takes place every August bank holiday Monday to celebrate the birth of St Bartholomew. It has been running for 100 years and is organised by the Butterton Wakes Committee. It takes place in St Bartholomew's Church and the Village Hall, and all the money raised goes towards upkeep of the village hall and church. The village also has regular events such as the Christmas Silver Band concerts, the Harvest Supper and afternoon teas in the church.

He is best known for founding the retail clothing store Hallensteins, which still bears his name. He also founded the D.I.C. (department store) in Dunedin in 1884. Biography Hallenstein was born in Bisperode, Duchy of Brunswick, Germany, on about 24 January 1835 to Reuben Hallenstein and Helena Michaelis; he was their third and youngest son. His parents owned a wool mill in L√ºgde. In 1852, at the age of 17, he moved to Manchester, England, where his maternal uncle operated a shipping office. In 1857 he followed his brothers, Isaac and Michaelis, to Daylesford in the Victorian goldfields, Australia. Each of the three brothers wished to marry their housekeeper, Mary Mountain (1826-1907), but it was ultimately Bendix she chose to marry. They were wed in the Anglican parish church in Alford, Lincolnshire, on 14 February 1861. They had four daughters; Sara (married Willi Fels), Emily (married Isidore de Beer), Henrietta (married James Francis (Frank) Hyams; died 1895 soon after childbirth), and Agnes (married Siegfried Barden). In 1873 he founded the New Zealand Clothing Factory in Dunedin to provide men's clothing for his stores. He opened a store in the Octagon, selling clothing at wholesale price; the retail clothing chain Hallensteins still bears his name. He also founded the Drapery and General Importing Company of New Zealand Ltd, later known as the D.I.C., in 1884. Hallenstein was the mayor of Queenstown Borough from 1869 to 1872. He represented the electorate of Wakatipu in Parliament from to 1873, when he resigned. He was appointed German consul for Dunedin in 1892. Hallenstein's son-in-law (and nephew) Willi Fels was a prominent philanthropist and arts collector in early Dunedin. Hallenstein's great- grandson Charles Brasch was a noted poet, literary editor and arts patron. ReferencesExternal links *Gordon Parry: Hallenstein, Bendix. In: Dictionary of New Zealand Biography.

It was directed by Spencer Gordon Bennet with a screenplay by George H. Plympton and Arthur Hoerl (who also wrote for Rocky Jones, Space Ranger). It appears to have been planned as a sequel to the earlier chapterplay Captain Video: Master of the Stratosphere and shares many plot-points, props and sets, as well as some of the same cast. However, the Video Rangers do not appear, and their uniforms are instead worn by \\"slaves\\" created electronically by Reckov, the dictator of the Lost Planet (Gene Roth) with the help of mad scientist Dr. Grood (Michael Fox) and enslaved \\"good\\" scientist Professor Dorn (Forrest Taylor). Plotline Dr. Ernst Grood has succeeded in winning control over the planet Ergro as the first step in his desired conquest of the Universe. Reporter Rex Barrow, his photographer Tim Johnson, Professor Edmund Dorn and his daughter Ella are all captured by Grood, who plans to make use of the professor's knowledge. With the help of the professor's inventions, Rex is able to free Ergro of Grood's domination, while Grood is sent on an endless voyage into space.

This serial was, despite the characters' names, essentially a sequel to Captain Video, from which stock footage was taken for this serial. It was originally known as The Planet Men.

From 1998 until 2002, Young was principal conductor of the Bergen Philharmonic Orchestra in Norway. From 2001 to 2003, Young was chief conductor of Opera Australia in Sydney. Her contract was not renewed after 2003, with one given reason being the excessive expense of her programming ideas. Young made her first conducting appearance at the Hamburg State Opera in 1996. In May 2003, she was named both chief executive of the Hamburg State Opera and chief conductor of the Philharmoniker Hamburg, posts which she assumed in 2005.

Young was the first female conductor at the Vienna State Opera in 1993. She conducted the Sydney Symphony Orchestra when they performed Elena Kats-Chernin's \\"Deep Sea Dreaming\\" at the 2000 Summer Olympics opening ceremony in Sydney. In November 2005, she was the first female conductor to conduct the Vienna Philharmonic.

The band was formed by Ben Crum, James Huggins, & Dan Donahue. Great Lakes were among the second wave of bands included in The Elephant Six Collective.  History  The debut self titled album Great Lakes was recorded 1996-1999 on Crum's 1/2\\" 8-track tape machine in their home studio in Athens, Georgia. It was released in 2000 on Kindercore/Elephant 6. The group consisted of founders Ben Crum, Dan Donahue, & James Higgins III, with a bevvy of supporting players from the Athens/E6 music scene. After relocating to Athens, Ga from Birmingham, Alabama, the trio met like minded musicians in fellow Athens bands like Elf Power, Olivia Tremor Control, Neutral Milk Hotel, and Of Montreal. Great Lakes grew from a three piece recording project to a full-blown rotating ‚Äòmini- orchestra‚Äô featuring over 12 musicians for the recording sessions & live tours for the first two albums. By the third release Donahue and Crum had moved to New York, and the band entered a new phase. By 2008, Crum was solely at the helm, and had assembled a Brooklyn-based lineup of the band that would continue playing together for over a decade. Crum discusses this shift in an interview with Dagger Zine: \\"I‚Äôve been the only original member of the band for over 10 years now. But it was really only for the first 2 records that the original members were a big part of the band, anyway, to be honest. And even then it was really just the first one that was the product of genuine collaboration. Back then it was me and Dan writing songs together, but by the time the first record came out we‚Äôd put together a big band that also featured Kevin Barnes from Of Montreal, Scott Spillane from Neutral Milk Hotel/Olivia Tremor Control, Bryan Poole from Elf Power, and Derek Almstead, Dottie Alexander, Heather McIntosh, and Jamey Huggins as a multi-instrumentalist and our main drummer. Jamey and I really collaborated very closely on the first record, in terms of working out the instrumentation on the songs. That was a really good, positive collaboration. And, truthfully, it hurt me when he chose to pretty much leave the band and focus on Of Montreal. But I understood his decision. They were getting really popular, and I couldn‚Äôt blame him. Then, in 2002, I moved to Brooklyn and Dan followed not long after, and once we‚Äôd both left Athens that was basically the end of the original lineup. Dan and I kept writing songs together, though, with him writing the lyrics and me writing the music. We went back to Athens to record Diamond Times, and a bunch of the old crew pitched in and played on the record... The thing about bands continuing on without original members is tricky. A lot of times those bands aren‚Äôt very good without the original lineup. But I always think about The Byrds when this subject comes up. My favorite Byrds records are the ones Roger McGuinn made without Gene Clark and David Crosby. I mean, I love the Gene Clark solo stuff, and that first David Crosby solo record, too. And of course the early Byrds stuff is great. But those late Byrds records are the ones I like the most. I like to think of Great Lakes like that. Maybe some people prefer the early stuff, and that‚Äôs fine. But I‚Äôm just going to keep on doing my own thing, regardless of what anybody else thinks.\\" The other two founding members have released music through their other songwriting outlets, Dream Boat & James Husband respectively. James released the album A Parallax I and continues to work on J.Husband and Donahue has contributed lyrics to several other bands' albums, including Of Montreal's City Bird, Elf Power's The Taking Under, and Bear In Heaven's Space Remains. Donahue has designed art, album covers, and videos for the bands MGMT, Pavement, Belle and Sebastian, and R.E.M.  Formation  The group started as a songwriting partnership between Dan Donahue and Ben Crum with James Huggins III joining band when it officially formed in 1996. The original lineup also included bassist/vocalist Craig Ceravolo and performed and recorded demos in Birmingham, Alabama, under the name ‚ÄòCherry Valence‚Äô. For a time the band was also called ‚ÄòWheelie Ride‚Äô, before it changed officially to ‚ÄòGreat Lakes‚Äô.  2000 ‚Äì 2008  Great Lakes released a self-titled debut album in 2000 on the label Kindercore Records. The album was produced and mostly mixed by Crum and Huggins, with final mixing by Robert Schneider of The Apples in Stereo. The LP package included a psychedelic 3-D cut-out mobile meant to sit atop the vinyl record and spin as it is played, designed by Donahue with technical help from long time R.E.M. designer Chris Bilheimer. The final track on the self-titled debut, \\"Virgl,\\" (penned by Huggins, though owing a heavy debt to The Kinks' \\"Picture Book\\") was included on a CMJ music magazine sampler CD in 2000. After releasing a number of 7‚Äù singles the band released their second album, The Distance Between, on the Athens, GA label Orange Twin in 2002. Their sophomore release was written by Crum and Donahue. It was again recorded and mixed in the band's home studio in Athens. It was selected as one of the top ten overlooked albums of that year by Magnet Magazine, which noted the band's ability to \\"spew out a fuzz-laced garage assault\\" and complimented their \\"knack for fusing melancholy with feats of ballroom levitation\\". The band did a tour in Europe, including stops in Scandinavia and the UK. A highlight stateside found them supporting Belle & Sebastian at the Tabernacle in Atlanta. During that year, both Crum and Donahue relocated to Brooklyn and continued writing, while Huggins toured with the band Of Montreal. He remained a recording and arranging contributor to Great Lakes for the third album, but no longer performed live with the band. The third Great Lakes album, Diamond Times, was begun in Athens and completed in New York. These sessions amounted to a turning point for the band, as Crum assumed greater control. Donahue and Crum fell out creatively soon after. ‚ÄòDiamond Times‚Äô was released by Empyrean Records. 'Diamond Timess‚Äô is the last recording to feature many of the original performers, including Huggins, Poole, Alexander, and Barnes (though Andrew Rieger and Heather McIntosh contributed to the band's later albums). After the release of Diamond Times, Crum assembled a three-piece lineup to tour behind it. This lineup included Kyle Forester on bass and backing vocals and Kevin Shea on drums. This lineup toured the US with The Clientele in 2005, and toured Europe multiple times in 2005 and 2006 with Ladybug Transistor and others.  2008 ‚Äì present  Since 2008, the band has released three more albums. Ways of Escape came out in 2010 was the first release to feature Crum as sole songwriter. Crum discusses the story of the album in a lengthy piece written for Aquarium Drunkard Ways of Escape is notable for the introduction of vocalist Suzanne Nienaber, and features, among others, Kevin Shea of Storm & Stress on drums, Joe McGinty on keyboards, David Lerner of Ted Leo and the Pharmacists on bass, and long-time Great Lakes contributor Heather McIntosh on cello. In 2011, Crum reconvened the group of musicians who played on Ways of Escape to begin a new album, Wild Vision, which was released January 22, 2016 on Crum's own Loose Trucks label. The Vinyl District wrote that Wild Vision \\"delivers a creative peak for Crum and Great Lakes,\\" and noted \\"The Great Lakes of the 21st century registers as a near completely different proposition from the one that existed during 2000 to 2002. Diamond Times links the promising yet ultimately minor early work to the considerable achievements of the last two LPs. The confident and appealing Wild Vision serves as the pinnacle of this unforeseeable but welcome circumstance.\\" In 2018, Ben and his Great Lakes bandmates returned with Dreaming Too Close to the Edge. Again, the album features Crum with Nienaber, Shea, McGinty, and Wachtel, and includes guest spots from Andrew Rieger and Luis Leal. Magnet called the album \\"one of the band's best\\" and praised Crum's \\"lyrical prowess and subtle way with melody.\\" Brightest Young Things called the song \\"Time Served\\" from the album \\"gorgeous and deceiving\\" and Backseat Mafia described the song \\"End of An Error\\" as \\"classic noisy indie rock\\". Long-running music site Babysue said of Dreaming Too Close: \\"These ten originals show why fans continue to follow and support Great Lakes. Crum writes songs delivered with unique sincerity.\\" Discography=Albums * Great Lakes (CD/LP) - Kindercore/Track & Field Organisation - 2000 * The Distance Between (CD/LP) - Orange Twin/Track & Field Organisation - 2002 * Diamond Times (CD) - Empyrean/Track & Field Organisation - 2006 * Ways of Escape (CD) - Orange Twin - 2010 * Wild Vision (CD/LP) - Loose Trucks Records - 2016 * Dreaming Too Close to the Edge (CD) - Loose Trucks Records - 2018 Singles and EPs * \\"Happy Happy Birthday to Me singles club: March\\" (7\\") - HHBTM - 1999 * \\"Kindercore singles club: May\\" (split single with Elf Power) (7\\") - Kindercore - 2000 * \\"Come Storming\\" (CD) - La Suprette - 2001 * \\"Sister City\\" (7\\") - Hype City - 2001 * \\"A Little Touched\\" (7\\") - Track & Field Organisation - 2002  References  External links  * 2005 lineup sound.

DiMarzio, Inc. (original name: DiMarzio Musical Instrument Pickups, Inc.) is a United States manufacturer best known for its direct-replacement guitar pickups. The company also produces miscellaneous guitar accessories, such as cables, straps and hardware. DiMarzio became known for its Super Distortion model, which was the first after-market replacement guitar pickup. It was introduced in 1972 DiMarzio Super Distortion Specifications and is still one of the most popular models. The Super Distortion pickup produced a higher electrical output than the pickups normally fitted as standard to guitars at the time. It has around twice the output of a PAF-type pickup, and stronger ceramic magnets. This drove the input stage of guitar amplifiers with roughly twice as much voltage as a PAF pickup, so that an overdriven distorted sound was easier to obtain. Two of the technologies that they are known for are: * their Dual-Resonance design which uses different size wire gauges to produce a different resonant peak for each coil, providing unique sounds. * their Airbucker‚Ñ¢ design which reduces string pull and increases sensitivity and sustain.

There was strong governmental control over radio and television during the 1950s-70s. Today, the CSA is only responsible for overseeing the observance of French law by the media. The 1990 Gayssot Act which prohibits racist or/and religious hate speech (which historical revisionism, in particular but not only Holocaust denial falls under), and time period allocated to each political party during pre-electoral periods. Furthermore, other laws prohibit homophobic hate speech, and a 1970 law prohibits the advocacy of illegal drugs.Loi n¬∞70-1320 du 31 d√©cembre 1970 relative aux mesures sanitaires de lutte contre la toxicomanie, et √† la r√©pression du trafic et de l'usage illicite des substances v√©n√©neusesPublic health code, L3421-4 In 2016, a television ad which advocated that babies with Down Syndrome should not be aborted solely because of their syndrome ran. It was ruled anti-abortion speech and removed. Each of these laws has been criticized by some groups, either from the left (especially concerning the 1970 law on drugs) or from the far right (in particular concerning the 1990 Gayssot Act or the laws prohibiting homophobic attacks). Others express the need for minorities to be protected from hate speech which may lead, according to them, to heinous acts and hate crimes, while still others claim that one cannot tolerate free speech concerning drugs as it is a matter of public health and moral order. However, the 2005 vote of the law on colonialism voted by the UMP conservative parliamentary majority has lifted a debate, especially among historians, concerning the legitimacy and relevancy of such \\"memory laws.\\" Although a fair amount of historians are opposed to such laws, few advocate their repeal because they think that repealing democratically agreed upon laws would be a greater evil. Finally, critics, in particular, but not only, from the left wing, have criticized economic censorship, in particular through concentration of media ownership (Bouygues' influence, for instance, on TF1), or the fact that Dassault or Lagard√®re, both military firms, control several newspapers in France, such as Le Figaro (owned by Dassault). Overall, freedom of press is guaranteed by the French Constitution but several effective cases of censorship against newspapers (Le Canard encha√Æn√©, Charlie Hebdo and Hara-Kiri newspapers, etc.), films, or radio-shows, have been registered in the history of the Fifth Republic, founded in 1958. According to Human Rights Watch, 6 percent of French people investigated for \\"apology for terrorism\\" are under the age of 14.  History of freedom of press and censorship in France =To the 18th century Censorship in France may be traced to the middle ages. In 1275 Philip III of France put Parisian scriptoria under the control of the University of Paris which inspected manuscript books to verify that they were correctly copied.David T. Pottinger, The French Book Trade in the Ancien Regime, 1500 - 1791, Harvard Univ. Press (1958), p. 55. Correctness of text, not content, was the concern until the early 16th century, when tracts by Martin Luther were printed. On June 13, 1521, Francis I of France decreed that all (religious) books had to be read and approved by the Faculty of Theology of the University, and on August 3, 1521, Parlement ordered that all Lutheran books must be deposited within one week. In 1526, the Parlement of Paris and the Sorbonne issued a ban on the publishing of the Bible in French. p. 118 On January 13, 1535, an extreme statute was enacted forbidding all printing under threat of hanging and closing all bookshops. This law was quickly abandoned, and Parlement formed a commission to review book printing. In 1536 it was ordered that all medical books must be approved by the Medical Faculty of the University, and actions were taken against certain publishers of books on medicine and astrology. In 1544, the University banned the printing of any book not approved by the appropriate University officials. In 1543, the Faculty of Theology issued its first Index of prohibited books, all religious, preceding by 16 years the Vatican's issuance of the Index Librorum Prohibitorum in 1559. The Edict of Ch√¢teaubriant issued on June 27, 1551, prohibited possessing any books listed on the University's Index; translating the Bible or works of the Church Fathers; importing books from Geneva and other places not under the Church's control; or printing or selling of any religious books written in the last 40 years. Nemours' cahiers de dol√©ances asking for the end of censorship, 1789. French National Archives The state itself began to take a greater role in censorship over the University and in 1566, the Ordonnance of Moulins was issued, banning the writing, printing or selling of defamatory books attacking individuals' good reputations and requiring that all books published must be approved and include the privilege and the great seal. The state control was strengthened in 1571 by the edict of Gaillon which placed enforcement of the censorship laws in the Chancellor's office instead of the University. De Boissy's Le Medecin par Occasion The concern of the censors was \\"heresy, sedition and personal libel\\" until 1629, when censorship began to focus also on immorality and indecency. \\"Nevertheless ... the government was never so much concerned about looseness of morals as it was about freedom of thought.\\" Manuscripts had to be approved by the Chancellor before publication and a register of permits was maintained. During the 17th century, the University and the state fought over control of censorship, which was haphazard. In 1653, the University was stripped of authority and replaced by royal censors. The royal censors office expanded in the 18th century and banned hundreds of titles. Books that were approved were required to include the censor's name and certificate of approval. Censorship was eventually under the authority of the office of the Director of the Book Trade, the most famous of which was Lamoignon de Malesherbes. Penalties for violations ranged from confiscation of books which often were burned, fines, imprisonment and even death. In the later 18th century these rules were increasingly evaded by printers and booksellers. The nineteenth century The loi sur la libert√© de la presse of 29 July 1881 was passed under the French Third Republic in 1881 by the then-dominant Opportunist Republicans who sought to liberalise the press and promote free public discussion. The new law swept away a swathe of earlier statutes, stating at the outset the principle that \\"Printing and publication are free\\". Following Auguste Vaillant's assassination attempt, the first anti-terrorist laws was voted in 1893, which were quickly denounced as lois sc√©l√©rates. These laws severely restricted freedom of expression. The first one condemned apology of any felony or crime as a felony itself, permitting widespread censorship of the press. The second one allowed to condemn any person directly or indirectly involved in a propaganda of the deed act, even if no killing was effectively carried on. The last one condemned any person or newspaper using anarchist propaganda (and, by extension, socialist libertarians present or former members of the International Workingmen's Association (IWA): > 1\\\\. Either by provocation or apology [...] incited one or more persons to > commit either robbery, or the crimes of murder, pillage, or arson [...]; 2. > Or directed a provocation towards soldiers in the Army or Navy, with the aim > of diverting them from their military duties and the obedience they owe > their superiors ... would be referred to the police correctional courts and > punished by imprisonment for three months to two years. \\"1.

Censorship was current during the war, leading to the 1915 creation of Le Canard encha√Æn√© weekly, which used satires and other games of words to pass through \\"Anastasia's scissors\\", as was popularly called the censors (such word games still exist in Le Canard, for leisure purposes, such as the section named \\"Sur l'album de la Comtesse\\"). = World War II = France fell to German forces in May, 1940. The occupying German military administration set up a propaganda effort headquartered in Paris, with branches () in major cities. The propaganda effort included monitoring and censorship of the French press and of publishing, film, advertising and speeches. = Fifth Republic = Censorship laws were revoked with the founding of the Fifth Republic in 1958, although cases of censorship still occurred (in particular concerning films or satirical newspapers). The proclamation of the state of emergency, used during the Algerian War (1954‚Äì62) and also in 2005, during the civil unrest, allows the state to legally censor news articles and other media productions (used during the Algerian War, this censorship disposition was not used in 2005). Henri Alleg's book La Question denouncing torture by the French Army during the Algerian war was censored, as well as other similar books and films, such as The Battle of Algiers. In 2003 , UMP deputy Nadine Morano called on Interior Minister (UMP) Nicolas Sarkozy to prosecute the hip-hop group Sniper for inciting violence against the police. after the 2005 riots 200 UMP deputies, led by Fran√ßois Grosdidier, brought a petition against several groups including Fabe, Sniper, 113, Lunatic, and others. In March of 2006 Grosdidier, frustrated by failure of court actions, proposed a law (no.2957) to amend the law of 29 July 1881 to explicitly remove speech protections for music and sanction racism against the majority by a minority. http://www2.assemblee- nationale.fr/documents/notice/12/propositions/pion2957/(index)/propositions- loi/(archives)/index-proposition In 1987 a law repressing inciting suicide was passed,Loi n¬∞87-1133 du 31 d√©cembre 1987 tendant √† r√©primer la provocation au suicide after a best-selling book called \\"Suicide, mode d'emploi\\" was published in 1982. The bill was first adopted by the Senate in 1983; in 1987, during the debates before the National Assembly, the book was cited by name as a prime example of what was to be banned.Proceedings of the French National Assembly, 14 December 1987, first sitting This book, written by two anarchists (Claude Guillon and Yves Le Bonniec), contained a historic and theoretical account of suicide, as well as a critical overview of ways to commit suicide. The book could not be rereleased in 1989 because of that law. The book is thus censored de facto, unavailable in all libraries and bookshops in France. It has never been translated into English. The twenty-first century In 2006, Interiot Minister and former President of the Republic Nicolas Sarkozy was accused of interfering in the management of Paris Match after it published photos of C√©cilia Sarkozy with another man in New York. The firing of the Paris Match director by Hachette Filipacchi M√©dias coincided with several other instances of self-censorship in French media. In April 2013 a volunteer with administrator's access to the French language Wikipedia was summoned by the direction centrale du Renseignement int√©rieur (Central Directorate of Homeland Intelligence, DCRI), a division of France's interior ministry. The volunteer was ordered to take down an article that had been online since 2009 concerning a military radio relay station at Pierre-sur Haute. DCRI claimed the article contained classified military information, for reasons that to date remain unclear, and broke French law. The volunteer, who had no connection with the article, explained \\"that's not how Wikipedia works\\" and told them he had no right to interfere with editorial content, but was told he would be held in custody and charged if he failed to comply. The article was promptly restored by a Swiss Wikipedia contributor. Christophe Henner, vice- president of Wikimedia France, said \\"if the DCRI comes up with the necessary legal papers we will take down the page. We have absolutely no problem with that and have made it a point of honour to respect legal injunctions; it's the method the DCRI used that is shocking.\\"\\"French secret service accused of censorship over Wikipedia page\\", Kim Willsher, The Guardian, 7 April 2013. On 15 December 2017, France's Constitutional Court rejected a bill to make visiting terrorist websites a criminal offence, citing \\"inviolability of freedom of communication and expression\\" as a reason. (Sputnik News)(Le Parisien) Political speech Individuals in these cases have been prosecuted for expressing political agreement or disagreement in a particular manner. * In 2008, left wing activist Herve Eon was convicted for a sign he had made and given a ‚Ç¨30 fine. The sign, which was held near the car of former President Nicolas Sarkozy, read \\"get lost jerk\\", echoing a statement Sarkozy himself had made to a critic at a public event. In 2013, the European Court of Human Rights overturned the ruling and criticized the French decision, stating the remark was protected for being satirical. * In 2013 Laure Pora, the head of a Paris chapter of LGBT rights group ACT UP, counter-protested at a rally against abortion. She called the President of an opposing group a \\"homophobe\\" and had activists distribute fliers with this message. In 2016, judges convicted Pora of a hate crime and fined her ‚Ç¨2,300, ruling that \\"homophobe\\" was a slur in violation of French law. * In 2015, France upheld twelve convictions which prosecuted BDS activists for selling T-shirts which read \\"Long live Palestine, boycott Israel\\". Linguistic censorship The Toubon law enacted in 1994Text of law in English has the cultural goal of \\"reaffirming the position of the French language\\". It requires \\"the compulsory use of the French language in all [public] written, ...radio and television advertising...\\"Zahd Yaqub, The European handbook on advertising law (1999), p. 425. As a direct consequence, advertising industry workers in France have expressed \\"frustration with regards to what many of them perceive as linguistic censorship.\\"As reported in the journal World Englishes, Volume 26 Issue 2 (year 2007), pages 170 - 190: \\"Multilingual discourses for addressing today's global consumer\\". Computer software developed outside France has to have its user interface and instruction manuals translated into French to be legally used by companies in France, due to the provision of the Toubon law applying to all workplaces that \\"any document that contains obligations for the employee or provisions whose knowledge is necessary for the performance of one's work must be written in French.\\" Also under this law, French language is required in all audiovisual programs, with exceptions for musical works and 'original version' films.See Television Regulation in France a 2005 report sponsored by the Open Society Institute. Under a related law for television, a minimum of 60 per cent of the movies and TV series must be produced in European countries and 40 per cent in Francophone countries, and these minimums must be met during evening prime-time as well as daily overall time. The latter law is not linguistic censorship because it applies to television programs that are dubbed into French; rather it is a restriction of foreign- produced cultural content. In another law that involves censorship of both linguistic and foreign-produced content, songs in the French language on radio are protected by a minimum quota system.  Press  The press is largely unrestricted by law in France, although indirect pressures are sometimes applied to prevent publication of materials against the interests of the government or influential industries. Involvement of the government and major industrial groups, sometimes with political ties, with certain press organizations sometimes raises questions as to the ability of the press to remain truly independent and unrestricted. Examples include: * the Agence France-Presse (AFP), an internationally active news agency used by the media worldwide, is a public corporation nominally independent from the government, but derives a lot of its revenue from sales to government; * Radio France International (RFI) is funded by the Minister of Foreign Affairs, and is sometimes criticized for its cover of former French colonies * Serge Dassault, businessman involved in warplanes, and thus in government procurement contracts, (see Dassault Aviation) and senator from the UMP party, owns newspapers including Le Figaro; he famously indicated that he intended his papers to reflect only \\"healthy ideas\\" (id√©es saines) and that left-wing ideas were unhealthy;France Inter, December 10, 2004, 8h20 * the Bouygues group, a major operator of public works and thus of government procurement contracts, owns the TF1 TV channel, which has the largest audience. In addition, most of the press depends on advertisement to generate revenue; the question of independence from advertisers is a constant and contentious one, with repeat assertions that undesirable investigations were taken away from TV broadcasts. However, there are examples of independence of the press, including the Canard encha√Æn√©, a newspaper that is known for its scoops and publication thereof, even against the will of the government. In order to remain independent, the Canard does not accept advertising. Theatre Victor Hugo's 1832 play Le roi s'amuse was banned after one performance. Though it depicts the escapades of Francis I of France, censors of the time believed that it also contained insulting references to King Louis-Philippe. Hugo brought a suit to permit the performance of the play, which he lost but it propelled him into celebrity as a defender of freedom of speech.  Cinema  All films intended for theatrical release have to be granted a visa by the Ministry of Culture, upon the recommendation of Commission for film classification (Commission de classification cin√©matographique), which can give a film one of five ratings: * Tous publics (universal/U): suitable for all audiences * Avertissement (!): some scenes may disturb young viewers. Can be used in conjunction with any rating as a warning. * Interdit aux moins de 12 ans (-12): Forbidden for under 12s * Interdit aux moins de 16 ans (-16): Forbidden for under 16s * Interdit aux moins de 18 ans (-18): Forbidden for under 18s but not pornographic. Usually used for movies containing unsimulated sex (e.g. Ken Park in 2003) or extreme violence/cruelty (e.g. 1971's A Clockwork Orange) * Interdit aux moins de 18 ans class√© X (-18 or X): Forbidden for under 18s and pornographic. This is not a rating per se and it is equivalent to the American \\"unrated\\" rank as such films are not played in movie theaters. Cinemas are bound by law to prevent underaged audiences from viewing films and may be fined if they fail to do so. The Commission cannot make cuts to a film, but it can ban it, although this latter power is rarely used. In practice, this means that most films in France are categorized rather than censored. Although there are no written guidelines as to what sort of content should receive which rating and ratings are given on a case by case basis, the commissioners typically cite violent, sexual and drug related content (especially if it is deemed to be graphic or gratuitous) as reasons for higher ratings. By contrast little attention is paid to strong language. However sexual content is much less likely to produce a high rating than in many other countries, including the United States. Films which have received comparatively mild ratings in France compared to the U.S. include: * American Beauty, U (rated R in the US) * Fat Girl, -12 (unrated in the US) * Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan, U (rated R in US) * Eyes Wide Shut, U! reclassified to U (rated R in US) * Kids, -12 (originally rated NC-17 in the US) * Taxi Driver, -16, reclassified to -12 * Braveheart, U! reclassified to U (rated R in US) * The Exorcist, -16, reclassified to -12 * Van Helsing, U, (rated PG-13 in the US) * Showgirls, -12 (rated NC-17 in US) * Shame (2011 film), -12 (rated NC-17 in US) * Killer Joe (film), -12 (rated NC-17 in US) * Blue Valentine (film), U (originally rated NC-17 in US, appealed to an R rating) * The Royal Tenenbaums, U (rated R in US) * Kick-Ass, U! (rated R in US) * Team America: World Police (cut version), U! (rated R in US) * Man Bites Dog, -12 (rated NC-17 in US) * Mulholland Drive, U (rated R in US) * Inland Empire, U (rated R in US) * Baise-Moi, -16, reclassified to -18 (unrated in US) * Fifty Shades of Grey, -12 (rated R in US) * The Lobster, U! (rated R in US) * Sausage Party, -12 (rated R in US) * Parasite (2019 film), U! (rated R in US)  Television  The Conseil sup√©rieur de l'audiovisuel (CSA) leaves the TV channels the choice of classification of a programme, but can impose penalties if the classification is too low. There are five classifications for television programs: * Tous publics (universal/U): suitable for all audiences * D√©conseill√© aux moins de 10 ans (-10): Not recommended for anyone under 10s (excluded from shows for children) * D√©conseill√© aux moins de 12 ans (-12): Not recommended for anyone under 12s (broadcast mostly after 10:00pm but occasionally after 8:30pm) * D√©conseill√© aux moins de 16 ans (-16): Not recommended for anyone under 16s (broadcast after 10:30pm) * Interdit aux moins de 18 ans (-18): Forbidden to anyone under 18s (broadcast between 0:00am and 5:00am) Classification of films can vary between the theatrical release and television broadcast. For example, Zombieland has been classified \\"Tous publics\\" in cinema, but when it was broadcast on TV, it was classified -16. The CSA is quite permissive about offensive language and sex in relation to the United States and in the United Kingdom. For example, South Park can be broadcast at any time of the day, except adjacent to youth programming, because it is classified -10. Note that cinema-only and VOD channels have different rules.  Classification details  Classification is made by the channels through a \\"viewing committee\\" which uses some guidelines proposed by the Conseil sup√©rieur de l'audiovisuel (CSA) to decide of a classification. The CSA exerts control at the time of broadcasting, not before, and can investigate further either after a viewer's complaint or on its own behalf. Sanctions from the CSA can range from a simple warning to a broadcasting ban. Some of the questions that the CSA want to be asked by viewing committees when evaluating a show are the following. For a series, each episode is evaluated. * The number and nature of the violent scenes * Are the violent scenes gratuitous or important for the scenario? * Are women depicted in a respectful or disrespectful way? * Is sex being depicted? And how young viewers could react to such scenes?  List of censored books  *Lamennais, Le Pays et le gouvernement (1840, led to Lammennais' imprisonment for a year) *Henri Alleg, La Question (Minuit, 1958 ‚Äî on the use of torture during the Algerian War) *Frantz Fanon's The Wretched of the Earth (1961), with a preface from Jean- Paul Sartre (published by Fran√ßois Maspero) *Mongo Beti's Cruel hand on Cameroon, autopsy of a decolonization (Maspero, 1972) censored by the Ministry of the Interior Raymond Marcellin on the request, brought forward by Jacques Foccart, of the Cameroon government, represented in Paris by the ambassador Ferdinand Oyono. *Bagatelles pour un massacre, by Louis-Ferdinand C√©line, for antisemitism, just like by the same author : **L'Ecole des cadavres **Les Beaux draps *L√©on Degrelle's Tintin mon copain  List of censored songs  *Boris Vian, Le D√©serteur (1954) Antiwar Songs (AWS) - The Deserter *JoeyStarr, \\"Sarkozy\\" (2006)  List of censored films  * La Gar√ßonne (1923) * Z√©ro de conduite(1933) * Jean-Luc Godard, Le Petit Soldat (1960) * Du - Zwischenzeichen der Sexualit√§t (1968) * Gillo Pontecorvo, The Battle of Algiers (1965) * L'Essayeuse (1976) * Romance (1999) *Le Mur (2011)  CSA  The Conseil Sup√©rieur de l'Audiovisuel (CSA) is charged to regulate televisions, both public and private. It surveys the respect of national legislation, as well as the respect of time allocated to each political party in the media during electoral periods. Freedom of information Freedom of information and the accountability of public servants is a constitutional right, according to the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen. The implementing freedom of information legislation is the Loi n¬∞78-753 du 17 juillet 1978 portant diverses mesures d'am√©lioration des relations entre l'administration et le public et diverses dispositions d'ordre administratif, social et fiscal (Act No. 78-753 of 17 July 1978. On various measures for improved relations between the Civil Service and the public and on various arrangements of administrative, social and fiscal nature). It sets as a general rule that citizens can demand a copy of any administrative document (in paper, digitized or other form). The commission on access to administrative documents (Commission d'Acc√®s aux Documents Administratifs, CADA), an independent administrative authority, may help in the process. Regulations specify maximal fees of reproduction. Only final versions, not work documents, may be requested. There exist a number of exemptions: * Documents established in the process of justice. * Documents of cases before the national ombudsman. * Documents carrying an appreciation or judgment over a named or easily identifiable person, or containing private information of that person (such as medical records), when the person requesting the document is not the person described in the document or, in some cases, from his or her family; such documents may often still be obtained after the names of the persons involved are erased; * Documents for which that are already available to the public (for instance, publishing in the Journal Officiel). * Documents with secrets regarding national defense or national foreign policy (though they may often be communicated after erasure of certain passages). * Internal deliberations of the national executive. * Documents from fiscal, customs, criminal enquiries. Certain exempted documents may still be available according to other statutes. For instance, some tax-related information about any taxpayer are available to any other taxpayer from the same tax district. CADA does not have the power to order administrations to surrender documents, though it may strongly incite them to do so. However, citizens can challenge the refusal of the administration before the administrative courts (i.e. courts hearing recourses against the executive). Unfortunately, these courts are overbooked, and citizens must often wait several years to have their rights examined in a fair trial. France has been declared guilty of excessive delays (more than 10 years) many times by the European Court of Human Rights.

It was a concept album released in October 1969, the album featured the theme of an evacuation from a dying Earth. The lead single from the album was \\"From Now On\\". The album and its space theme were influenced by the media's attention to the moon landing. The songs were composed by Ken Howard and Alan Blaikley, writers of such commercial hits as Dave Dee, Dozy, Beaky, Mick & Tich's \\"Zabadak!\\", and \\"The Legend of Xanadu\\". The original Fontana pressing gave no composer label credit to Howard and Blaikley (possibly to distance the album's music from their pop music credentials), but the US pressing bore their names. Shortly after the release of Ark 2, the band went into the Dutch TV Station TROS studio and recorded a short 5-song set to promote the album, which was filmed and later broadcast on 14 May 1970 on the TROS TV station. The five songs were \\"Earthglow\\", \\"Weightless\\", \\"Changes\\", \\"Space Child\\", and \\"From Now On (Immortal Invisible)\\". It is the only known footage of Flaming Youth that exists. Both the music and vocals were mimed. Although the album today remains difficult to obtain, it has been reprinted in various markets mainly for the novelty of Phil Collins' first major label recording. Collins was the group's drummer, and Ark 2 was Collins' last recording before auditioning for Genesis the following year. Critical reception The album received some critical praise in the music press. Melody Maker listed the album as \\"Pop Album of the Month\\", calling it \\"adult music beautifully played with nice tight harmonies\\". Disc and Music Echo said \\"there is some splendid music on this very good first album\\".Coleman, Ray. \\"Phil Collins: The Definitive Biography\\". Simon & Schuster, 1997. London, pp. 55-56. The rock press of the time was even more favorable and it was awarded Sunday Times Rock Album of the Year in 1969. Despite this, the album and single were not commercially successful. The BBC did not know what to make of it: there were no radio or TV slots for an extended rock work at the time. So it remained largely unheard except by those who sought it out.

Mitigation strategies are supported by state government and federal programs, in line with the Disaster Mitigation Act. The need for hazard mitigation has become more widely recognized over the past few years, due to the large number of natural hazards that have occurred in the U.S. and the increase in the costs to achieve post-disaster recovery. Money spent prior to a hazardous event to reduce the impacts of a disaster can result in substantial savings in life and property following the event. The benefits of implementing a hazard mitigation program usually far outweigh the costs. As a result, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and the states have developed national and state Mitigation Strategies and funding is becoming increasingly more available to support hazard mitigation efforts. The advantages of developing a LMS include access to government funds for hazard mitigation projects, the provision of protective information to local officials, residents, and businesses, and the protection of an area's population, property, infrastructure, economy, environment, and quality of life. The hazard mitigation initiatives that a community develops must have their basis in the community's guiding principles on hazard mitigation, and should also be grounded in an empirical, geographic, and historical analysis of the jurisdiction's hazards. The initiatives must actively reduce a community's vulnerability to hazards in order to be considered mitigation activities, rather than emergency preparedness activities. Actions and their implementation expenses can be justified through the vulnerability assessment section of the strategy, which documents the types of damages and other impacts that hazards have had, or could cause in the future, within the planning area. Finally, mitigation initiatives must accurately reflect the community's needs‚Äîwhat is politically, legally, economically, and technically feasible and sufficiently equitable in socioeconomic terms. The working group assigned to develop the strategy can help assure that local needs are incorporated in the mitigation initiatives. These steps should lead to projects that are grounded in a community's overall vision of hazard mitigation, planning, regulations, resources, and goals, and that can lead to a tangible reduction in its vulnerability to hazards, based upon the findings of its hazard analysis section.

Soshangane ruled over the Gaza state from 1825 until his death in 1858. Soshangane was also known by the name of Manukosi. Early life Soshangane was born in ca 1780 in modern-day KwaNongoma, KwaZulu to Zikode kaGasa, a chief of the junior branch (iKohlo) of the Ndwandwe. His younger brother was Mhlabawadabuka. The Gasa occupied the Mkuze region around the eTshaneni mountain (Ghost Mountain) whilst the senior house under Zwide lived in Magudu near the Pongola Valley. Around the same time that the Ndwandwe were growing in military power, Zwide ascended to the Ndwandwe-Nxumalo throne following the death of his father Langa KaXaba. The emergence of northern Nguni kingdoms Three powerful kingdoms emerged in the series of wars that engulfed the Nguni states. The first was the Ndwandwe confederacy under Zwide, the second was the Swazi state ruled by Sobhuza I, while the third was the Mthethwa confederacy ruled by Dingiswayo. The three large states were ruled by paramount kings who exacted tributes from a host of other smaller states, communities and clans. The subordinate states recognised the control of the overall central ruler in issues pertaining to state rituals and initiation rites, payment of tributes and waging of war. They however enjoyed considerable autonomy in their day-to- day affairs. The Ndwandwe state  The Ndwandwe state came into prominence in the middle of the eighteenth century. The people that made up the state originally migrated from the Thembe Kingdom in the interior of Delagoa Bay towards the end of 17th century. In the earlier years, the Ndwandwe occupied the whole northern part of Zululand, and more specifically, from the Pongola River in the north to the southern point of the Black Umfolozi and from Ngome in the north-west, eastward to St. Lucia Bay on the sea. The Ndwandwe rulers then embarked on an expansionist policy by subjugating and incorporating other smaller communities to their neighbourhood. The political authority of the Ndwandwe increased tremendously as they annexed several other communities to their own state, and their borders grew quite extensive. This made the Ndwandwe rulers the first Nguni rulers to control a large state from the various small communities in the region. In achieving this, they did not only make use of military force, they also exploited old institutions and adopted them to serve new purposes. For example, the Ndwandwe rulers, made use of military regiments recruited through traditional initiation of males and females of the same age group. It is likely that Zwide and his predecessors were among the first Nguni rulers to see some political significance in the practice of coordinating circumcision and initiation rites on a state‚Äìwide basis. These ceremonies were henceforth organised from the centre and youths from all the territories under the Ndwandwe were made members of national age groups. In periods of war, these age groups were converted into military regiments. Apart from the military utility of the national age-group, they also served to weld different parts of the Ndwandwe confederacy together. In order to enhance their own authority and create an aura of invincibility round themselves, the Ndwandwe rulers relied on a widespread use of magical and religious influence. For example, Zwide made use of a large number of magicians and medicine men to build up and spread news of his power throughout the neighbouring communities. He also made use of diplomatic marriages to cement relationships with some of the other states in the region. His sister married Dingiswayo, the Mthethwa ruler, while his daughters married Sobhuza, the Swazi king, and Mashobana, the Khumalo ruler and father to Mzilikazi, the king of the Ndebele. The Nguni and Ndwandwe kings The source and stream of the Ndwandwe/ Nxumalo royalty is steeped right at the beginning of the Nguni people, and the very first Nguni King, King Ndlovu. King Ndlovu ‚Äòs Kingdom is believed to have started around the year 800-920 A.D., when he broke off from his own group, the Bantu, ‚Äò‚ÄôBatho‚Äô or the ‚Äò‚ÄôNtu‚Äô‚Äô. The Bantu people divided up into Sotho and Nguni streams. The Nguni left behind the Sotho stream while proceeding south. Ndlovu was the greatest King in this part of the continent, in that he founded many nations. He became the father of many nations, the Xhosa, the Zulus, the Ndebele, Ngwane/Swazi, Ndwandwe (Shangana) Thonga, Ndawu, etc.Prof J M Maseko: 32:1998 All Nguni speaking tribes and nations, owe their identity and cultural heritage to this great king. In turn the Ndwandwe nation also owes their identity to their king Nxumalo. When the Nguni subjects address their king, in praise singing, they would say: Wena we Ndlovu! Wena we Ndlovu! Wena we Ndlovu! Bayethe! Bayethe! Bayethe! In the case of Ndwandwe subjects addressing their king, they will say Ndwandwe! and the respond would be Nxumalo! King Zwide II Nxumalo Zwide was born around 1750s. He was the son of chief Langa of the Ndwandwe clan. His mother was Ntombazi. Zwide‚Äòs generals of war were Soshangana, Mzilikazi Khumalo, Nxaba Msene, and Zwangendaba of the Jele tribe. The greatest task of building the Ndwandwe confederacy fell on Zwide who came to the throne in 1790. He proceeded to build on foundations laid by his grandfather and father by making use of old customs and practices. He reached the peak of his rule at the same time as Dingiswayo of the neighbouring and rival Mthethwa Confederacy.Ajayi & Ade: 1929: 42 Zwide made use of magical and religious influence, for example he made use of a number of magicians and medicine men to build up and spread news of his power thought the neighbouring communities. He also made use of his diplomatic marriages to cement relationships with other states in the region. His sister married Dingiswayo the Mthethwa ruler, while his daughter Thadiwe married Sobhuza, the Swazi king and Mashobana the Khumalo ruler. However, Zwide was astute enough not to allow such dynastic alliances to stand in the way of his expansionist policy. Despite the fact that Sobhuza was his in-law, Zwide attacked his capital because Sobhuza laid claim to the fertile arable land of the Ndwandwe in the Pongola valley. The Ndwandwe army emerged victorious and expelled Sobhuza from Pongola, driving him and his followers in a northerly direction where Sobhuza later laid the foundation of the Swazi nation. By 1818, Zwide made the Ndwandwe tribe along the Mfolozi River very strong. In the same year, 1818, war broke out between the Ndwandwe tribe and the Mthethwa tribe. In that war Zwide ambushed Dingiswayo and killed him, after which he defeated the Mthethwa tribe.Ajayi & Ade: 1929:43 After capturing and killing Dingiswayo, Zwide sent his messengers to Shaka, asking Shaka to pledge his allegiance to him. ‚ÄúNow that I have removed your head‚Äù Zwide had boasted, ‚Äúwhy don‚Äôt you just bring the whole body before me, or I will toss the body into the river Thukela‚Äù. Shaka had been expecting this, but had summoned enough courage to reply to Zwide: ‚ÄúThe body had two heads like the great river-snake Nkanyamba. You were just too foolish to see the other head‚Äù.Madi P M: 2000:51 Shaka immediately incorporated the Mthethwa with his own tribe and built a powerful army, but it was yet smaller than that of Ndwandwe. In 1818 Zwide sent his army to attack the Amazulu, but Shaka, a clever general, tricked them. The Zulu army was small and weak, but Shaka knew that the Ndwandwe army did not carry food on its raids. When the Ndwandwe‚Äôs forces entered the Zulu kingdom, they found no food because the Zulu army had burnt or buried it. The Zulu army had also gone hiding- with all the kingdom‚Äôs cattle. One night, the Zulus attacked the Ndwandwe where they had set up camp in the Zulu kingdom, killing many of the Amabutho as they slept.New Nation: 1991: 20 This forced the Ndwandwe to give up the attack and return home. Although the Amazulu had managed to repel the Ndwandwe, they had not defeated them. The Ndwandwe were still a threat to the neighbouring chiefdoms. The Zulus joined forces with their neighbours, and in 1819, the Amabutho under the command of Shaka were strong enough to meet the Ndwandwe in battle. They fought on the banks of the Mhlathuzi River, and although the two armies were evenly matched, the Zulu triumphed. Zwide fled with the remnant of his followers, eventually settling in the upper Nkomati valley in the eastern Transvaal present day Mpumalanga Province. In 1826 Zwide‚Äôs successor, Sikhunyana, led an Ndwandwe force back to attack the Zulu, only for it to be utterly decimated in a short engagement.Maylam, 1986:27 Five of Zwide‚Äòs son \`Nomahlanjana, Mbejwa, Sixobana, Nombengula and Dayingubo perished in the battle field. Nomahlanjana was Zwide‚Äòs heir. Zwide with his two remaining sons Sikhunyana and Somaphungu and two daughters Thandile and Fikile managed to escape northwards to the present Mpumalanga Province and settled along the Nkomati River. His two daughters were later married to Sobuza I. Thandile gave birth to Mzamose and Mavuso II, while Fikile‚Äòs son was Ndwandwe. Zwide died in 1825 in the present Mpumalanga province. Soshangana‚Äôs real name was Manukuza II. He named himself Soshangana because (Owa shingela imizana ya Bantu). Bryant states that Soshangana Nxumalo was the son of Zikode Nxumalo the son of Gasa Nxumalo the originator of the branchBryant, 1929:447 and his mother was Ngubuviya Ntyayintyayi.Jacques: 1938:12 It is claimed that Soshangana and his followers were an independent people since immemorial. According to Bryant, it could be stated without doubt that Soshangana was a member of the Ndwandwe clan, at that point in time staying in the present northern KwaZulu-Natal and one of the formidable Nguni tribes, along with the Mthethwa Empire of Dingiswayo, the Ngwane of Sobhuza I, the Hlubi of Mpangazitha and the Ngwane of Matiwane. It could be accepted that Soshangana was a cousin/brother of the sovereign king of the Ndwandwe people, Zwide. Soshangana was the leader of the Nguni group who fled away from Shaka Zulu the king of the Zulu nation in the 1820s. Soshangana / Manukuza and his group decided not to become incorporated into the Zulu Kingdom after the Ndwandwe king Zwide, whose subject suffered a defeat.Bryant, 1929:447 In 1819 Zwide was the ruler of the royal house of Ndwandwe, while Soshangana was Ndwandwe military commander and the leader of the Gaza branch. The Gaza branch was constituted of members of the Likhohlwa part of the original royal house living in the Ndwandwe area at a place called eTshaneni, the Ghost Mountains on the Mkuze plain. It is also here where Gaza and other important leaders of Gaza branch were buried.Bryant, 1929:447-448 The establishment of Gaza Kingdom Soshangana, along with his four brothers Madjole, Ngheneya, Mpisi and Zikhata as well as his people (Gaza branch) followed the example of other Ndwandwe parties by leaving his family land at Tshaneni.Bryant, 1929:448 Fleeing before the on coming rage of the Zulu king, they took a route along the eastern foot hills of Lubombo through Mngomezulu country to the upper Ntembe River vicinity where Captain W. Owen found them in 1822.Van Der Merwe: 5 From their meeting between Soshangana and Captain Owen, said Bryant: ‚ÄúThis interview possesses for us here an especial historical interest ‚Äì it was not only the first occasion on which these particular‚Äù‚Äò Ngunisi‚Äô had ever beheld a White man, but, what is more, marked, so far as we know, the first meeting between the English and ‚ÄòNguni‚Äô races on detailed record‚Äù.Bryant, 1929:449 He was not heard of again until years later when he emerged as the conqueror of the tribes of Portuguese East Africa and the potentate of the Shangana empire‚Äù.Berker, 1962: 20 & Hartman, 1972, 33 Their migration could have taken place hardly later than the year 1821 and may have been a season earlier (1820).Bryant, 1929:449 Here Soshangana was temporarily beyond the reach of Shaka and lived in the Tembe area for about five years, enriching and strengthening himself by constant raids. Thereafter in about 1825, he crossed the Tembe River and marched in a north‚Äìwesterly direction. Between 1825 and 1827 Soshangana lived on a tributary of the Nkomati River north of Lourenco Marques (now Maputo). During his sojourn in the territory of the Tembe and thereafter, Soshangana defeated almost all the Ronga clans of the vicinity of Delagoa Bay without encountering any resistance and raided their cattle. Their young women were taken captive and the defeated young men were taken up in his army.Grandjean, 1899:72Liesegang, 1975 His following was reinforced by many Ndwandwe refugees after the defeat of Sikhunyani by Shaka in 1826. Soshangana and his people stayed in the region of Delagoa Bay until 1828, when Soshangana defeated Shaka‚Äôs armyCameron According to most traditions, the historic battle with Shaka‚Äôs forces, which confirmed Soshangana‚Äôs independence, took place at Bileni. It appears it was a few years after the retreat of the Zulu that Zwangendaba returned from the north and joined Soshangana. After two years together, mutual jealousies arose, and Zwangendaba was forced to begin the march and was to take the Ngoni through Zimbabwe, and ultimately into Zambia, Malawi and Tanzania.Smith, 1971:306-307 From 1827 to 1835-6 his residence was in the lower Limpopo valley. There he was attacked unsuccessfully by the troops of Shaka in 1828 and by those of the governor of Inhambane, M.J. da Costa.Liesegang, 1975:2 His capital was located at Ekupumuleni (resting place) near present day Chaimiti. From there, Soshangana sent his regiments in different directions to subdue local people. Using the military tactics which they had learned in Nguniland they conquered all people they attacked.Moyana H. & Sibanda M, 1999:20 The battle spelt disaster for Shaka who was murdered by his half brother that same year.Slater, 1997:11 After this triumphal march, Soshangana and his followers established themselves in about 1834 on the fertile lowlands of the Lower Limpopo River in the area of Bileni.Wilson:1975:114 Soshangana and his group subjugated and incorporated the indigenous Tsonga, Shongonono, Ngomane, Portuguese, Ndzawu(Ndau), Hlengwe, Nyai, Rhonga, Shona, Senga and Chopi tribes. Many young men were incorporated into the regiments of Soshangana‚Äôs army, the women taken as wives and beasts as provisions.Liesegang, 1975: 1-2 & Myburgh, 1949:75 This incorporation brought into existence the Gaza Empire, which Soshangana named after his grand father Gaza. This group (Shangani) derive their name from his name Soshangana.Gazankulu: 1988: 29 On the Save River (Sabie) Soshangana chastised the Shona (Karanga) peoples following his settling there in 1836. It is here where Bryant through his research, established that the two Nguni leaders, Soshangana and Zwangendaba met, and fought each other for three or four days until eventually Zwangendaba fled via Venda to what later became known as Bulawayo, Zimbabwe, and even further north to Malawi and Tanganyika.Bryant, 1929:454 Following this encounter, Soshangane settled somewhat further to the eastern side on the high lands of central Save. Before long it was once again discovered by Soshangana, that he was not the only Nguni leader in the area. Nxaba, another Nguni leader, established himself at the Buzi River not too far from where Soshangana's headquarters were. Likewise Nxaba was forced to follow in the steps of Zwangendaba. This victory enabled them to expand their frontiers. Here Soshangana conveniently subjugated the peoples between the Zambezi and Inhambane and subsequently conquered the whole area south to Delagoa Bay.Bryant, 1929: 454 In 1838 as result of the smallpox epidemic in which he lost many of his warriors, Soshangane and his followers returned to their earlier home, Bileni in the Limpopo valley, leaving his son Mzila to place the area north of the Zambezi under his tribute. He stayed at Musapa for about three years.Hartman & Kriel: 1991: 16 By the time that Soshangana returned to settle in the Limpopo valley, he had brought not only all the Tsonga chiefdoms of the interior under his control, but he had also subjected many of the Tonga in the immediate neighbourhood of Inhambane. Having said that, the Gaza empire was known to be extensive and this couldn't have happened without the conquest of large populations of these groups. Founding of the Gasa/Gaza Kingdom Angoni (or Abanguni), descendants of Zwangendaba's clan, photographed towards the end of the 19th century Soshangane left with his followers and his younger brother Mhlabawadabuka for the eastern Lebombo foothills, till they reached the vicinity of upper Tembe river. Around 1825 Soshangane entered the country between Matsolo and Nkomati river where he found Zwangendaba Hlatswayo of the Jele clan, a former Ndwandwe subsidiary chief. They briefly formed an alliance, but due to Soshangane's ambition to establish his own kingdom this was short-lived. After trouble arose between Soshangane and his younger brother Mhlabawadabuka, Zwangendaba and his followers left for Vendaland, between Limpopo (Vembe) and Levubu (Ribvubye) rivers being joined by Mhlaba. They lived there for a while, before migrating to the North (Rozviland), near present-day Bulawayo. He defeated the Vashona. He later left for Manyikaland in the North east where he met Soshangane again in the early 1830s. They fled from Soshangane and Zwangendaba crossed the Zambezi river in 1835, after they split with Soshangane's young brother Mhlabawadabuka in 1834. Mhlabawadabuka remained in the Zambezi area. Mhlabawadabuka means the one who split the land, which led to the totem (Kwamulanyika). By 1825 Nxaba Msane, another former Ndwandwe general and subsidiary chief had entered central Mozambique, in the Sofala province. He ruled Sofala undisturbed for about 10 years, between 1825 and 1835. It was only in 1835 when he was removed by Soshangane. Nxaba left Sofala for Zambia. After defeating Nxaba, Soshangane lived for a while in Musapa in Zimbabwe, where he conquered the Ndau (Vandau) and Manyika (Vamanyika). Some Gazan Nguni lived in various Manyika regions in Zimbabwe, like the Zindi, Samanga, Nyamhuka, Karombe and Murahwa. Soshangane then began to carve out a Nguni empire of conquest known as the Gaza Empire (or Gasa), named after his grandfather Gasa KaLanga, which would later significantly expand to cover areas over present day southern Mozambique, and parts of the Limpopo River around Mandlakazi. The rise of the Gaza Kingdom was based primarily on military conquests, particularly of the Vahlengwe, Vadjonga, Vahlave and Ndau peoples, who would be absorbed into the Nguni Gaza Kingdom. Soshangane then began a campaign to create a new language and culture named after himself. This began primarily with the formation of a regimented system in which different classes of the Gasa/Gaza kingdom were separated. The conquered Ndau, Vakhosa, and Vahlave peoples were regimented under the Mavulandlela regiment and taught Nguni/Ndwandwe battle tactics. Many of the subjugated peoples (including the Ndau, Shona, Nguni, and Tsonga) were incorporated into the Gaza empire. This created a conflict between the Shangaan tribe and the long- existing Tsonga people, where the Gaza Shangaan empire was seen as an invading force and a threat to the cultural institutions of the Tsonga people and other nearby tribes. In 1828 Shaka sent a punitive expedition to liquidate his rival to the North, however suffering from malaria and food shortages they were easily defeated and Soshangane consolidated his empire.[1] Soshangane's army overran the Portuguese settlements at Delagoa Bay, Inhambane and Sena,[1] and he extracted tribute from the Europeans, primarily the Portuguese. After the death of Soshangane around 1856, Soshangane's empire was embroiled in succession disputes between his sons Mzila and Mawewe. The final ruler of Gaza kingdom was Soshangane's grandson Mdungazwe kaMzila who in 1895 was embroiled in war against the Chopi people and later defeated by the once tributary Portuguese leading the Nguni Gaza empire into decline. Soshangane is one of a number of prominent figures that rose to prominence during the Mfecane.Encyclop√¶dia Britannica1820 in South Africa:Port Elizabeth, 1820 Settlers, Battle of MhlatuzeThe Washing of the Spears The empire under Soshangane is credited for destroying Portuguese trading posts thus putting an end to slave trading that has been taking place before the arrival of the Nxumalo Ngunis. The following events of the time were recorded: a) 22nd -27 October 1833 warriors of Gaza forced captain D A Riberiro and his men at Fort Espirito, Lourenco Marques, to evacuate and flee to the island Shefina (Bryant, 1929: 455); b) In 1828 warriors of Gaza defeated a Zulu army shortly before the assassination of Shaka, when it was still extremely difficult to resist Zulu military power(Dencoon, 1972: 37); c) 28 October 1833 warriors of Gaza destroyed the fort completely and put an end to slave trading that was taking place before his arrival. ( Bryant, 1929: 455); d) 3 November 1834 the Portuguese captain and all inhabitants, except 10 of the Inhambane settlement were destroyed (Bryant, 1929: 455); e) October 1836 : military command at Sofala, J N Da Costa and a whole garrison , rallied against Gaza and subsequently the garrison was wiped out ( Bryant ,1929: 455); f) Soshangana even commanded the Portuguese to recognize him as their king to whom they had to pay taxes. g)Soshangane formed the Gaza or Shangana Empire , which extended from just north of Delagoa Bay (Maputo), up the East Coast , as far as the Zambesi and Limpopo valleys; g)In his victorious progress he annihilated or drove into the sea all the Portuguese in his path, and it was he who destroyed Van Rensburg‚Äôs party of Voortrekkers on the south bank of the Limpopo (Shaka Zulu, 1955:152). h)In 1840s - 50s the Portuguese of Delegoa Bay, Inhambane, Sena districts and the chiefs of Barue and Manica were paying tribute(Newitt: 287); i)The Manika Kingdom was defeated and the Portuguese were forced to abandon their trading settlements there(Moyana H &Sibanda; M, 1999:20); j)h) The Manika chiefs paid 100 head of cattle as acknowledgement of Gaza overlordship (Newitt: 287) ; i) Sena and Tete were brought under Shangane control and forced to pay tax; j) During Soshangana‚Äòs reign, they paid no homage to the Portuguese at Delagoa Bay, Inhambane and Sofala, and demanded levy from all travellers passing through their territory e.g. before and after Arabs, Traders, British, Portuguese, Voortekkers and missionaries. All had to pay toll before being allowed to pass through the Gaza kingdom (Albasin, unpublished book, 1988) ; k) Even the young Joao Albasin paid the required tariff to Soshangana on his first journey through the Hlengwe bush to Zoutpansberg (Albasin, unpublished book, 1988) ; l) As the recognition of the Gaza kingdom Z.A.R granted Joao Albasin the area along the south of Levuvu River , stretching from Elim to the Mozambique border today , as the reserve for his many thousands Shangaans. It was officially known as the Knobneusen Location. Only Shangaans were allowed to settle in this area, with the exception of Davhane, the brother of Makhando, who had deserted his brother to seek sanctuary with Joao Albasin Albasin, unpublished book, 1988) ; Due to cordial relations between Soshangana and another significant force at the time, that of the Ngwane King Mswati II , Soshangana stabilized the tension by presenting in marriage two of his daughters, Mahambandle and Nomagaca( Van Der Merwe), The last years of Soshangana s‚Äô reign were spent in stabilising and enforcing his power by sending his regiments out as far as the Zambezi River on a yearly basis to collect taxes. Soshangana died in his residence near Chaimite(Shayimithi) on the lower Limpopo west of the present ‚Äìday Chibuto where he was buried. (He died in 1858. He ruled the Gaza kingdom for 37 years: 1821-1858 (Liesegang, 1975:3). According to Bryant Soshangana‚Äòs body /bones was taken to eTshaneni Mountain in Zululand where it was buried (Bryant, 1929: 45). The Gaza Kingdom was stretching from close to the Nkomati River in the South to the Zambezi and Pungwe Rivers in the North and from the Indian Ocean in the East towards the Eastern parts of what today known as Zimbabwe- a total of approximately 240 000 km2 . According to Liesegang it seems as if he also incorporated the eastern Venda under his control (Liesegang, 1975:2; Myburgh 1949:75-76; Omer-Cooper 1988: 59-60 and Witt‚Äôs unpublished undated report). The Gaza Kingdom, which at height of its power may have controlled between 49 500-000 -1000-000 people, was one of the two Nguni states between the Limpopo and Zambezi Rivers (Carlos: 2005:1). Like other Nguni states, the Gaza Monarchy was unique, not in the way it provided an umbrella of sovereignty over tribute paying subjects, but in the sheer extent of its operations. At the height of its power in the 1850s and 1860s the direct authority of its rulers extended over the whole of what is today southern Mozambique and large parts of western Zimbabwe, eastern and northern Transvaal (Liesegang, 1975:1). The region of the Lebombo Mountains and the Zoutpansberg was situated on the edge of the area from which of Gaza Kingdom took tributr(Newitt, 1995:293). In 1840s both Barue and Manica had been brought to acknowledge the overrule of Gaza king, Soahangana. Like other Nguni states, the Gaza Kingdom had centrally controlled and administered nucleus and a much larger ‚Äúpenumbra‚Äô of territory where tribute was collected and Gaza overlordship was loosely acknowledges under the threat of being raided by Gaza impis. On its fringes, therefore, the ‚Äústates‚Äù were loosely organized. Subject chieftaincies retained their identities and their traditional ruling dynasties, but had to accept the presence of their representatives of the Gaza state at their capital. These chieftains were affiliated to one or other of the great aristocratic ‚Äúhouses‚Äù among which the patrimony of the Gaza Monarchy was distributed. Mention must be made that armed tax collecting parties representing these ‚Äúhouses‚Äù, periodically visited the outlying areas (Newitt:, 1973: 287). chieftains were affiliated to one or other of the great aristocratic ‚Äúhouses‚Äù among which the patrimony of the Gaza Monarchy was distributed. Mention must be made that armed tax collecting parties representing these ‚Äúhouses‚Äù, periodically visited the outlying areas (Newitt:, 1973: 287). Soshangana‚Äòs Policy of Administration Soshangana handed over determined areas or chiefdoms to his sons and other close relatives. The subjects and the envoys of the chiefs would first go to these men when they had a problem which the king had to decide upon. This gave his sons, especially the older ones who could take part in discussions, political experience, a certain standing and a number of loyal followers. In this respect the Gaza Kingdom was markedly different from the Ndebele kingdom after 1850. Mzilikazi‚Äôs sons were known by some of the European visitors but they do not record any political activity. Portuguese records on the Gaza Nguni, especially those from Sofala, are very explicit on this point. So called court officials (i.e. those belonging to the house of the king and those of his ancestors) one of whom was often designated as prime minister in later English accounts, are also mentioned in reports on the Gaza Kingdom (Liesegang, 1975: 3). For military hegemony, the Gaza Nguni chiefs relied on regiments (called mangas or impis) which were commanded by indunas, or lieutenants. Modelled on Shaka‚Äôs regiments these organisations of professional soldiers, grouped by a toughened by rigorous training, dominated the local peasantry. Intermarriage with conquered Rhonga, Tonga and Chopi to expand their numbers diluted the Nguni ethnic distinctiveness. The Nguni overlords tried to offset the loss of homogeneity by requiring their subjects to adopt their customs, such as pierced earlobes. Not since the times of Mwene Mutapa dominance had a foreign invader overrun and subdued so much of the country below the Zambezi (Henriksen, 1978:77). The core of the state consisted of a number of aristocratic Nguni ‚Äòhouses‚Äô associated with the past Gaza monarchs and their next of kin. These houses were endowed with the tribute from sections of the population. It was they who had the responsibility of collecting tribute and administering relations with subjects. The administrators of the houses were the most powerful of the Nguni aristocracy and had the right of attending the King‚Äòs council (Newitt, 1973: 297). The regimental structure was superficially similar to that of the Zulu. Some twenty ‚Äìfour age sets of regiments were formed during the existence of the state. They maintained an age ‚Äìregiment system less tightly controlled than that of the Zulu, and dominated their subjects‚Äô peoples under an elaborate hierarchical structure of status groups graded by lineages, in which the Ndwandwe royal lineage had precedence over their Tsonga, Ndau and Tonga subjects (Devenport, 1987: 68). Soshangane using military tactics defeated most rivals and consolidated his control over the lands lying between the Zambezi and the Limpopo. In building his kingdom, Soshangane used the age ‚Äìregiments system. The chiefs of conquered peoples were treated as vassal sub- chiefs. Young men were trained by military Indunas in the fighting methods of their conquerors. Members of the Nguni people constituted a distinct class called the ba Ngoni. The newly incorporated group of people were distinctly known as the Ba Tshangane. The new recruits were segregated against in regiments of their own under ‚Äòba Ngoni‚Äô officers. As time went on, the ba Tshangane came to identify with their conquers and took pride in their loyalty to their king (Moyana H &Sibanda; M, 1999:21). In order to govern more effectively, the ruling lineage devised a system of territorial apanages under royal siblings, which increased steadily and were re-divided after a civil conflict on the death of Soshangane in 1858, when Mzila beat his brother Mawewe for the succession (Devenport, 1987: 68 &, 1966:-59). The regiments of the Gaza kingdom were not stationed in barracks and did not have their own headquarters or stocks of cattle. Their defeated young men were conscripted into Soshangane army. Many of them were recruited from among the Mavulandlela (Those who sweep the road clean) and sent them ahead of his armies to remove all obstacles from the road. These young men were organised into regiments and used as advance guards during his marches (.Junod, 1938 . Soshangane incorporated later waves of refugees from the Zulu kingdom and maintains a tight regimental system, succeeded in dominating Mozambique, Transvaal as far as north as the Zambezi River and extracting tribute from the Portuguese settlements at Lourenco Marques and Sofala and from the Portuguese forts and the prazos on the Zambezi. But Soshangane was less successful than the Swazi rulers in assimilating conquered peoples and developing durable political institutions. Beyond the core of his kingdom on the Sabie River, his power depended on the presence of his regiments, which could not be everywhere at once (Curtin & others, 1978:306-308). The Gaza settled in Ndau country, east of the Sabi, and the Ndau language, a Shona dialect, contains a wealth of Zulu words inherited from the Gaza Ngunis. The conquered peoples who were not Shona included the Chopi, Thonga/Tsonga the Hlengwe and the Ronga however many separate tribes among these remained unconquered and many fled to other parts where they re-established their independence. The term ‚ÄòShangaan‚Äô which properly relates to the conquerors themselves, include all of those who were conquered. They contributed manpower to the Gaza army and the Ndau lost a high proportion of their men in this way. The Gaza intermarried with the local people, but were less successful in imposing their language on them as the Ndebele were doing in Matabeleland. Influence was not one way traffic. Whilst the local people learned much about from the Gaza, Zulu military technique, for instance, they in turn influenced the dominant group. Ndau beliefs took on a strong on the Shangaans (Gaza Nguni), just as the Ndebele took over the Mlimo concept from their Shona vassals (Warhurst, 1966:48). For the Shona, the growth of the Gaza state represented the latest in a series of far-flung empires that had engulfed their communities over the centuries. Soshangane largely usurped the role of his Rozwi predecessors rather than establishing a new political system. (Elkiss,1981:66). The Gaza rule was not at all harsh provided people did not rebel against it; any such rebellion was severely crushed. Soshangane ruled unchallenged from the Zambezi to the Limpopo, from the Sabi to the sea. He ruled the Gaza Empire for 37 years. He died at his capital Chaimiti in 1859(Warhurst, 1966:48). The Gaza empire was however embroiled in the slave trade and the kingdom has been described by Harries as an exploitative governance Another book by Gerhard Liesegang (1986) delves deeper into the activities of the Gaza Empire during Nghunghunyane's time and it points out the cruel nature of the Ngunis against the Shona, Kalanga, and Tsonga people. The book, titled \\"Nghunghunyani Nqumayo: Rei de Gaza 1884-1895 e o desaparecimento do seu estado\\" details how the Gaza Kingdom raided for slaves to sell to the Portuguese and various plantations,and how the local people came to hate the presence of the Gaza Empire in their land. The book also features descriptive interviews from people about those times, and it gives a clear overview of how the Gaza Kingdom was used as a vassal (or proxy) by foreign European governments in order to destabilize the region and to control it for its resources and slaves. With the oppression that the enslaved and exploited people suffered, it was this cause that led to the rebellion and war that finally led to a collaboration to destroy the hegemony of the Gaza Empire.Liesegang, G.

Published by 2K Sports and the Sega Corporation, it is the sixth installment of the NFL 2K series and the last to use official NFL licensing until an unnamed sequel is released in 2021. Gameplay is presented as a live ESPN television broadcast and features the voices and digital likenesses of multiple ESPN on-air personalities. The game was originally released on July 20, 2004. It was the last NFL 2K game to be released before Electronic Arts (EA) signed an exclusive rights agreement with the National Football League (NFL) to make 2K's rival Madden NFL series the only officially licensed NFL game and was also the last game still being developed by Sega.  Gameplay  The game features a franchise mode with a SportsCenter feature hosted by Chris Berman. He outlines the games of the current week with his co-host Trey Wingo who talks about the latest injuries and free agent deals and trades during the season. Mel Kiper Jr. hosts the draft portion of the segment while Suzy Kolber reports from the sidelines. There is also weekly preparation for the coming week which allows the player to make decisions on training and preparation. The player can also create his or her own team deciding the team logos (over 10 are available), team name, the team's city, the team's stadium look and build, jerseys and how good the team is. It also has a feature called first-person football, which gives the player the experience on the field looking from the eyes of the players. There is also the traditional create-a-player mode. One of the features in the game is a celebrity game involving Jamie Kennedy, Steve-O, David Arquette, Funkmaster Flex, or Carmen Electra which is initiated by a phone call from one of the aforementioned \\"celebrities\\" in the player's custom crib. The player plays against a celebrity with his or her own custom team of Pro Bowl players. The teams the celebrities use are The Buartville Funkmasters, Cincinnati Electra Shock, LA Dreamteam, Los Angeles Locos, and the Upper Darby Cheesesteaks. During the game, the celebrities appear in a small box and use trash-talk. If the player wins the game, they receive the team's stadium as a playable venue. ESPN NFL 2K5 features the voices of Terry McGovern as play-by- play announcer Dan Stevens, Jay Styne as color commentator Peter O'Keefe, sideline reporter Suzy Kolber, studio host Chris Berman, Trey Wingo, and Mel Kiper Jr., with Berman appearing at the start of a player's own SportsCenter broadcast and during the loading screen for the player's own ESPN NFL Countdown pregame show, and Kolber appearing in the Player of the Game segment of the postgame show.  Release  ESPN NFL 2K5 was the first in the 2K series priced at $19.99 the day it shipped, much lower than market leader Madden NFL at $49.99. This greatly reduced Madden sales that year; one EA Sports developer recalled that \\"[i]t scared the hell out of us\\". EA reduced Madden NFL 2005s price to $29.95.  Reception  Upon release, ESPN NFL 2K5 received \\"universal acclaim\\" on both platforms according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. Matthew Kato of Game Informer rated the game 9.5 out of 10 and summarized his positive review by calling it \\"the best football title there is and the only one that's a must have,\\" a quote which was paraphrased on the front cover of the game's keep case. Andrew Reiner echoed this sentiment in the review's \\"Second Opinion\\" section, calling ESPN NFL 2K5 \\"the greatest football game to date.\\" Chris Carle of IGN gave the PlayStation 2 and Xbox versions a 9.3 and 9.4 out of 10, respectively, and each version was awarded the publication's \\"Editor's Choice.\\" Carle praised the game's various features, particularly the VIP system, which he called, \\"Probably the coolest innovation ESPN NFL 2K5 has to offer.\\" Bro Buzz of GamePro gave the game a perfect 5 out of 5, praising the incorporation of ESPN broadcast styles within the game and noting that \\"the tight controls do a great job of commanding a slick array of player moves and on-the-fly scheme adjustments.\\" Many reviews compared ESPN NFL 2K5 to Madden NFL 2005, which was released in the same year. In a direct comparison of the two games, Electronic Gaming Monthly declared Madden to be the better game, with scores of 9.5, 9.0, and 9.0, while NFL 2K5 was given scores of 8.5, 8.5, and 8.0. Alex Navarro of GameSpot recommended NFL 2K5, noting superior offensive gameplay, special teams, online play, features, presentation, graphics, and sound. Jon Robinson of IGN agreed that the graphics and presentation of NFL 2K5 were superior to Madden, yet he felt Madden was the better game due to the superior gameplay. Kato opened his review by claiming, \\"ESPN NFL 2K5 is better than Madden NFL 2005. I say this without reservation,\\" while Buzz stated, \\"Each season, Sega's ESPN NFL series has been making steady progress in its quest for video-game football stardom. This year, the design guys at Visual Concepts have turned ESPN NFL 2K5 into the most entertaining show in video-game football.\\"  Sales  In the United States, the PlayStation 2 release of ESPN NFL 2K5 had sold 1.7 million copies and generated $33 million in revenue by July 2006, two years after its release. During the same time period, sales of NFL 2K5 reached 3 million combined units across all consoles, and it was the 23rd highest- selling game launched for either the PlayStation 2, Xbox, or GameCube.  Awards  ESPN NFL 2K5 won multiple awards for the best sports game of 2004. During the Academy of Interactive Arts & Sciences' ninth annual Interactive Achievement Awards (now known as the D.I.C.E. Awards), ESPN NFL 2K5 won in the category Sports Simulation Game of the Year. At E3 2004, it won the Best Sports Game award from GameSpot, and in IGN's year-end awards, it won Best Sports Game released for the Xbox. ESPN NFL 2K5 was also nominated for Best Sports Game across all video game systems by IGN and the Spike Video Game Awards, losing in both to Madden NFL 2005. In the Satellite Awards, given annually by the International Press Academy, it was the only NFL simulation game nominated for Outstanding Sports Game, although NFL Street, a football game that does not simulate NFL gameplay, was also nominated. Since its release, numerous websites and publications have ranked ESPN NFL 2K5 as one of the greatest sports video games of all-time, listed as 44th by Bleacher Report in 2011 and fifth in a user-generated list on Ranker. In his \\"Sports Video Game Rankings\\" compiled for ESPN, Robinson ranked the game 8th, two spots higher than Madden NFL 2005 despite Robinson's preference for Madden in his contemporary review. Yardbarker included NFL 2K5 in an unordered list of the 25 best sports games of all-time, noting that, \\"For a brief moment, there was a true challenger to the Madden hegemony. ESPN NFL 2K5 had a different look and a slightly different game play, and people loved it.\\" Time ranked NFL 2K5 as the 41st greatest video game of all-time regardless of genre, stating, \\"Sorry, Madden NFL fans, true football gaming fanatics know this is the best gridiron game ever made.\\"  Legacy  In retrospective analyses, ESPN NFL 2K5 has continued to receive favorable comparisons to the Madden NFL series and is noted for its depth that has yet to be matched in subsequent years. In 2014, Owen S. Good of Polygon wrote that NFL 2K5 was \\"sports video gaming's King Arthur, eternally populist, noble and heroic, champion of an age long ago enough to make its triumphs soar and its shortcomings recede to nothingness\\". Good went on to state that EA's Madden developers \\"for 10 years have been haunted by NFL 2K5 ‚Äî in forums, in comments, in social media ‚Äî that nothing they do could be as good as something that by now really isn't a video game, but a mythological ideal that grows more romantic with every year\\". A 2016 Game Informer retrospective by Matthew Kato praised the variety of features in the game, which was noted as \\"a far cry from the stark decline that followed in EA's NFL titles.\\" Kato concluded by stating, \\"The title is more than just a novelty or a case of its reputation exceeding its value, a rare feat for the genre in my eyes.\\"  EA exclusive licensing controversy  In December 2004 EA Sports acquired an exclusive rights agreement with the NFL and NFLPA to be the sole creator of NFL video games. In December 2010, a U.S. district court judge certified a class action anti-trust lawsuit against Electronic Arts for anti-competitive practices to proceed. Electronic Arts settled the class action suit in July 2012 for (equivalent to about $M in ), and retained its exclusive NFL license.

It was designed to accommodate homeless people with emergency hostels. Rough sleepers‚Äîinitiatives to reduce the numbers of rough sleepers=Background London, as the UK's capital city, has always attracted large numbers of migrants unable to find affordable housing. Other large towns and cities had similar populations of homeless people and some sleeping rough but on a much smaller scale. Many had severe and enduring mental health problems like Schizophrenia, which made them 'homeless and rootless' or meant they had no settled way of life.Helping Destitute Men, Leach and Wing Publisher: Law Book Co of Australasia; 1st ed. edition (Jun 1980) Language English Others had impoverished or no social support from family or friends. Some had left institutions like the army, prison, care homes or psychiatric hospitals. These migrants slept in places that were mainly hidden from public view. Lincoln's Inn Fields was one site, the arches under Waterloo Bridge and the area behind the Royal Festival Hall were others. The most famous was the area covered by Hungerford Bridge by Embankment Station, where charity 'soup runs' handed out food and blankets, medical assistance and other forms of social support including offers of a bed for the night - a 'kip'. Gradually during the 1980s a number of factors combined to turn what had been a background issue into a social and political crisis. Rising property values turned run-down Victorian terraced family housing, whose owners had been making ends meet by renting rooms to low-skilled migrant labourers, into marketable assets. These lodgings or 'digs' were often run by women 'landladies', who provided some social support as well as basic lodgings and meals for an affordable rent. These were sold off through this period leaving their one-time residents homeless. A slowdown in the merchant shipping and docks in the Port of London led to a layoff of men who were mobile and had been well paid but in idleness had nowhere to go and found work hard to come by Changes in government policy designed to improve the accommodation standards for hostel dwellers closed an estimated 5,000 places in London hostels. This loss of basic shelter put the numbers of people sleeping rough into the thousands on the streets of the UK capital. There was a view that 'Care in the Community' had led to psychiatric hospital patients being turned out into the streets. Though this was never substantiated many ex-patients did suffer neglect and abuse once released. News coverage of the rising street population became a part of the mood music to the Tory government's unravelling social and economic policy agenda. St Mungo's and National Sleep Out Week In 1989 St Mungo's, a homelessness charity, organised National Sleep Out Week to highlight the problem and give a focus to the mood of concern. The second such event in 1990 was discussed in Parliament and recorded in Hansard (view here). Coverage was repeated in 1991 and the diminishing popularity of Mrs Thatcher's premiership was highlighted by the 30,000 people said to have slept out to raise awareness and funds to help homeless people. Mrs Thatcher's fall from grace with her parliamentary party is dated to a speech by her Deputy Prime Minister Geoffrey Howe, whose wife Elspeth took a leading role in publicising the homelessness campaign and is widely credited with writing the speech that her husband delivered in Parliament leading to his boss's political demise. In 1993, Michael Leapman wrote in the Independent,https://www.independent.co.uk/news/media/media-a- tory-feminist-for-tvs-watchdog-michael-leapman-profiles-lady-elspeth-howe-the- incoming-chair-of-the-broadcasting-standards-council-1490510.html \\"She has also been an active campaigner against homelessness. In June 1990 she was one of several prominent people who spent the night in a cardboard box to highlight the problem. \\"Sir Geoffrey was then still a member of the Cabinet and Margaret Thatcher, the prime minister, was furious at Lady Howe's gesture. It helped to widen the rift that led first to Sir Geoffrey's resignation (it was said that Lady Howe wrote his speech) and thence to Mrs Thatcher's removal from office.\\" Once Mrs Thatcher had gone, Sir George Young bt, a Tory 'wet' with a long-standing interest in homelessness and a solid reputation amongst campaigners, was appointed housing minister with 200 million GBP to spend on getting people off the streets. The level of street homelessness (rough sleeping) has declined steadily in England since the late 1980s following a number of successful government-funded programmes introduced from 1990 onwards by both Conservative and Labour governments. These initiatives are often referred to as the Rough Sleepers Initiative (RSI). In fact, the three phases of the RSI lasted from 1990 until 1999. Until 1997 the RSI was concentrated on London where the number of rough sleepers was far higher than in any other part of the country. In 1997 the RSI was extended to 36 other areas of England. In 1999, following the publication of a government report ‚ÄòComing in from the Cold‚Äô, the RSI was replaced by a new programme, overseen by the RSU, which had been created in the previous year following the election of a Labour government. The RSI commenced in 1990 as a result of a continuous rise in rough sleeping during much of the 1980s, notably in central London where the number of rough sleepers was particularly high and visible, and therefore political sensitivity around the numbers, especially pronounced. During the 1980s a number of large encampments of rough sleepers grew up in various places, usually referred to by the media as 'Cardboard City'. In fact Cardboard City was in a sense a mobile city. In the early 1980s it existed close to the River Thames at the London Embankment tube station and was closed as a rough sleepers site by Westminster City Council working with the voluntary sector so that the space used by rough sleepers could be upgraded into a retail shopping area. Many rough sleepers were assisted to find permanent accommodation (self-contained council and housing association flats) through the resettlement work that was undertaken prior to the site being closed. Cardboard City then relocated to Lincoln's Inn Fields, a central London park, where a similar closure operation took place in the late 1980s, and then onto a site in South London, ‚Äòthe Bullring‚Äô, where a third closure operation took place in the early 1990s. On each occasion some parts of the voluntary sector engaged with the relevant local authority to support the clearance of rough sleepers from the area. The justification for doing this was not only the inevitability of the closure but also the offer of additional help for the rough sleepers affected, including access to permanent accommodation and extra help to address other support needs associated with poor mental and physical health and substance misuse. Some organisations opted to not be part of this partnership on the grounds that for rough sleepers it was an infringement of their liberty and would lead to rough sleepers being displaced elsewhere. Indeed, the evidence showed that some people did not take up the offer of help and moved to sleep at a different site. However, others were successfully housed and were able to maintain their accommodation, with support. By the late 1980s in London approximately 1,000 men and women could be found sleeping on the streets of central London on any one night, mostly in the central London boroughs of Westminster, Camden and Lambeth. The increase in rough sleeping arose for a variety of reasons including: *A reduction in the number of hostel (shelter) bed-spaces in London as a result of hostels being up-graded from dormitory accommodation into single room accommodation, leading to higher quality hostels but with fewer bed-spaces. *Reductions in benefit levels and related restrictions affecting people under 25, leading to an increase in rough sleeping among this age group. *An increase in levels of unemployment in the UK, inevitably decreasing the ability of people on low incomes to maintain accommodation. *A reduction in the number of social housing units being built and a loss of social housing units as people took up the ‚Äòright to buy‚Äô their local authority council accommodation through an initiative introduced by the Conservative government. The three phases of the RSI ran from 1990 until 1999 costing the government in total over ¬£200 million. Running concurrently in the early phase was a connected initiative called the Homeless Mentally Ill Initiative (HMII) which arose from public concern about the danger posed by rough sleepers with mental health problems both to the public and to themselves. The HMII was modest in size compared to the RSI but led to the creation of a range of high quality temporary and permanent self-contained accommodation for rough sleepers with mental health problems and included the funding of linked mental health teams to support and complement the work of the generic housing teams providing residential support. The RSI concentrated on funding: *The building of almost 4,000 units of accommodation (mostly self-contained, some shared) for rough sleepers across London with the majority of units constructed in south London where land is cheaper. *Resettlement teams tasked with referring appropriate rough sleepers into the RSI accommodation and supporting them so that they could maintain the accommodation. *Street outreach teams such as those run by Thames Reach St Mungo's and Broadway making the initial contact with rough sleepers. *Basic emergency winter shelters in temporary buildings. *Spaces for rough sleepers in hostels. The initiative was essentially a partnership between central and local government and the voluntary sector. Additionally, housing associations, health care providers, the police and local businesses were also engaged within what became labelled a multi-agency approach. This was reflected at government level in the creation of an inter-departmental ministerial group to draw together different government departments with responsibilities for people sleeping rough. The voluntary sector organisations were funded directly by government to provide services. Central government took the unusual step of funding directly as it had little confidence in local authorities to address the problem of rough sleeping. Furthermore, in London the Margaret Thatcher administration of the 1980s had dissolved the Greater London Council and there was therefore no regional body in the capital in a position to take on funding responsibility. The delivery structure model was based around a number of local consortia that did not take account of local authority boundaries but were instead constructed around the main rough sleeping areas in central London. The consortia were extremely inclusive and as such, often unwieldy due to the size of the membership which included representatives from the voluntary, local government, central government and business sectors. The RSI, through its various phases succeeded in the following areas: *It successfully brought together key players around a focused task of reducing rough sleeping. *Although there were delays in the building of new accommodation for rough sleepers, eventually almost 4,000 units of mostly self-contained accommodation was built with the intention of being for rough sleepers ‚Äòin perpetuity‚Äô. *Resettlement teams ensured that rough sleepers were not only found accommodation, but helped to maintain their tenancy, with some success. *Outreach teams working in central London provided a greater presence than ever before and developed a process for ‚Äògate-keeping‚Äô access to the rough sleepers units to avoid them being filled by people who had not slept rough who invariably have lower needs. *Most importantly, the number of rough sleepers to be found on London‚Äôs streets on any one night fell from around 1,000 to 270 by 1995. The limitations of the RSI were that: *Although numbers fell, by the mid-1990s a plateau seemed to have been reached and although rough sleepers continued to be helped off the street, new rough sleepers took their place. *Resettlement support offered from the teams was short-term, often for only six months, and as a result statistics showed that almost 20% of people helped into self-contained accommodation left within one- year, often to returning to the street. *The ‚Äògate-keeping‚Äô of accommodation by the voluntary sector organisations was very mixed with some agencies undertaking it with greater diligence than others. Spot checks on the self- contained accommodation meant exclusively for rough sleepers exposed that a significant minority of people referred to rough sleeper accommodation had, in fact, never slept rough.  Rough Sleepers Unit (RSU)  By 1997 the incoming Labour government wanted a different and more effective approach to dealing with rough sleeping. It created the Social Exclusion Unit (SEU), situated within the Prime Minister‚Äôs Cabinet Office, to prioritise the key social issues to be tackled by the new administration. Rough sleeping was selected as a high priority and the RSU was created, headed up by a high profile and plain-speaking ‚Äòhomelessness tsar‚Äô called Louise Casey. The RSU was tasked with reducing rough sleeping across England by two-thirds within a three-year time frame. As the programme was late to start, this was in the end compressed into a period of slightly over two years. The practical and ideological approach of the RSU differed markedly from the RSI. Notably: *The head of the RSU, Louise Casey led the programme on a very ‚Äòhands on‚Äô basis, routinely going onto the street herself with her team, directly making referrals into hostels and tracking rough sleepers with the explicit objective of ‚Äòshaking up‚Äô the system where she perceived it to be failing. Her team comprised career civil servants and also an array of individuals hand-picked from the voluntary sector to work with her. *The approach required from outreach teams was different, with teams expected to be more assertive in their approach to rough sleepers. The approach from staff to rough sleepers changed from one characterised by ‚Äòworking with you at your own pace‚Äô to the more direct ‚Äòwhy are you here and what do you need to help you get off the street?‚Äô The RSU funding approach was also different in the following ways: *Outreach teams continued to be funded, now known as Contact and Assessment Teams (CATS), as an important element of the programme but the number of teams was reduced to avoid duplication and to give greater ownership of geographical areas in central London. *Resettlement teams were reshaped into six Tenancy Sustainment Teams (TSTs) operating on a geographical basis, with the task of sustaining former rough sleepers in self-contained accommodation and with no time limit imposed concerning the length of time over which support could be offered. *The RSU concentrated on providing additional resources to frontline hostels, rather than on funding a large flat-building programme. Through its financial investment in hostels the RSU was able to ring-fence bed-spaces in the hostels for rough sleepers, so increasing the throughput of people coming in off the streets. It also funded specialist bed-spaces for people with drug and alcohol problems. *Night centres were funded in London, Bristol and Manchester to provide easy access off the streets and an inviting environment for rough sleepers who were unwilling to take up a hostel bed or were banned from hostels. *A series of temporary (‚Äòrolling‚Äô) shelters were funded to provide basic emergency, short-stay accommodation for rough sleepers as a replacement for the seasonal winter shelter programme. *The consortium model was re-shaped to be more streamlined and focused with fewer partners, less bureaucracy and stronger leadership required from local authorities. *More attention was given to tracking rough sleepers through the hostel system and to sharing information between partner organisations via a central database called ‚ÄòChain‚Äô. *A stronger role was given to the police with additional funding coming from central government to fund the Safer Streets Police Team to work with street users (not just entrenched rough sleepers but street drinkers, people begging on the street, new arrivals to the street etc.). *Attention was given to tackling what were seen as the magnets drawing people back into street homelessness, including street begging and soup runs provided by faith groups. For example, the RSU ran a high-profile campaign aimed at discouraging the public from giving money to people begging on the street. The RSU phase came to an end in 2002 following the successful reduction by 70% of rough sleeping across England, so achieving the Prime Minister‚Äôs target of a two- thirds reduction. In London the reduction was more modest and the two-thirds reduction target was not met. The following factors led to the RSU being successful: *The high‚Äìprofile leadership given by the Head of the RSU linked with the importance given to the reduction in rough sleeping by the Prime Minister Tony Blair had a galvanising effect and created considerable momentum. *The direct approach taken by the RSU coupled with a more assertive outreach approach successfully reduced the numbers of rough sleepers at key central London ‚Äòhotspots‚Äô. Where before rough sleepers congregated in groups of up to 100, by 2001 it was rare to see a hotspot containing more than a dozen rough sleepers. *The exclusive allocation of bed-spaces to rough sleepers in key frontline hostels created the ‚Äòflow-through‚Äô from the streets required to achieve the target. *Investment in outreach teams and hostels in cities outside London such as Birmingham and York where there had been little investment previously led to a dramatic drop in numbers sleeping rough. *The TSTs proved more successful that their predecessors in sustaining former rough sleepers in tenancies with the eviction and abandonment rates plummeting from almost 20% of tenants leaving accommodation within one year of a tenancy starting to under 5%. *The relationships between the voluntary sector organisations and the police became formalised and more effective and were characterised by a more integrated approach, rather than the different bodies working in parallel. This was illustrated in practical terms through the creation of a regular meeting involving police, local authority representatives and voluntary sector agencies at which information on rough sleepers was shared. Where appropriate and beneficial, joint street-work was undertaken. There were criticisms of the RSU‚Äôs approach from a number of quarters and its successes were not unqualified. In particular: *Some charities expressed severe misgivings at the assertive approach encouraged by the RSU and believed it to be too aggressive, disrespectful to rough sleepers and counter-productive. They also challenged the veracity of street counts which were increasingly perceived as intended to produce a low figure on an allotted night, rather than being a genuine reflection of the number of rough sleepers. *The RSU concentrated on making the street count figure the headline outcome figure, giving less prominence to the fact that the numbers of rough sleepers sleeping out over a year in central London was approximately ten times the number of people sleeping rough on any single night. *Although numbers on the streets went down, central London hostels were soon full to over-flowing with rough sleepers, many of whom had multiple needs. Critics claimed that people were being ‚Äòwarehoused‚Äô in hostels rather than being helped to find long-term, settled accommodation. *In London the reduction in rough sleeping was less than elsewhere in the country and in the central London borough of Westminster where over 100 people continued to sleep rough on any one night, the problem appeared particularly intractable. The UK Social Exclusion Unit and the Rough Sleeping Unit inspired a similar initiative in Australia following meetings with Tony Blair and Louise Casey. In South Australia, the State Government of Premier Mike Rann (2002 to 2011) committed substantial funding to a series of initiatives designed to combat homelessness. Advised by Social Inclusion Commissioner David Cappo and the founder of New York's Common Ground program, Rosanne Haggerty, the Rann Government established Common Ground Adelaide http://www.commongroundadelaide.org.au building high quality inner city apartments (combined with intensive support) for \\"rough sleeping\\" homeless people. The government also funded the Street to Home program and a hospital liaison service designed to assist homeless people who are admitted to the Emergency Departments of Adelaide's major public hospitals. Rather than being released back into homelessness, patients identified as rough sleepers are found accommodation backed by professional support. Common Ground and Street to Home now operate across Australia in other States.  Post RSU‚ÄîThe Homelessness Directorate  The RSU was reshaped in 2002 to become the Homelessness Directorate which, in turn, was later subsumed within the Department for Communities and Local Government. The new direction from 2002 on centred on the following priorities: *Continuing to work towards a reduction in rough sleeping but to give the lead role in achieving this to local authorities across the country, including devolving to them the funding of rough sleepers‚Äô services. *Each local authority was expected to develop a Homelessness Strategy, including plans for the further reduction in rough sleeping and areas with high numbers of rough sleepers were required to undertake, and report on, annual street counts. *Central government gave greater priority and resources to reducing anti-social behaviour and the former homelessness tsar, Louise Casey was given a new role in this area as head of the Government‚Äôs Respect Task Force. *Emphasis was placed on preventative services, particularly with the development of a new housing- related funding stream called ‚ÄòSupporting People‚Äô which offered more opportunities to support vulnerable people in their flats in the community and so prevent the loss of accommodation and homelessness. *Street outreach teams working with rough sleepers were also urged to prioritise preventative approaches and to consider a range of possibilities, including helping people return home, rather than referring to a hostel bed as a first option. Conclusion Considerable progress has been made in reducing rough sleeping in England with the voluntary sector playing a lead role. Some parts of the voluntary sector have chosen to remain outside the collaborative framework that has been created to achieve the reduction. London continues to have the biggest rough sleeping problem with between 250 and 300 individuals sleeping out on any night and almost 3,000 over a year. Nonetheless, this figure compares favourably with rough sleeping figures for other European capitals and is considerably lower than, for example, New York which has a comparable population to London. In the last year England has experienced a 9% rise in rough sleeping and there is renewed interest in reducing numbers of rough sleepers on the streets of London following the selection of London as host city for the 2012 Olympics. Data published by London‚Äôs Poverty Profile ‚Äì a joint project of New Policy Institute and Trust for London ‚Äì shows the number of rough sleepers found by outreach teams has more than doubled between 2007 and 2012/13 to around 6,400.http://www.londonspovertyprofile.org.uk/indicators/topics/housing-and- homelessness/rough-sleeping-in-london/ ReferencesExternal links *Hansard reference *St Mungo's website * Thames Reach website Category:Homelessness organizations Category:Programmes of the Government of the United Kingdom Category:Poverty in England Category:Housing in England Category:Homelessness in England ","title":"Rough Sleepers Initiative"},{"id":"3550502","text":"Lieutenant General Hubert Reilly Harmon (April 3, 1892 - February 22, 1957), after a distinguished combat career in World War II, was instrumental in developing plans for the establishment of the United States Air Force Academy. He was the first superintendent of the academy and was one of the persons most influential in establishing it as a successful educational institution. Early life and education Hubert R. Harmon was born in 1892 at Chester, Pennsylvania. He was from a military family; his father Millard F. Harmon, Sr. was a colonel who later served as Commandant of Cadets at the Pennsylvania Military Academy in Chester. One brother, Millard F. Harmon, Jr. was a lieutenant general and another, Kenneth B. Harmon, a colonel. Harmon attended the Polytechnic Preparatory School in Brooklyn, New York for two years before entering the United States Military Academy. He graduated from the United States Military Academy in 1915, as a member of \\"The class the stars fell on\\", named so due to the number of graduates who became generals. Harmon's first assignment was at Fort Monroe, Virginia, until December 1915, when he was transferred to Fort Andrews, Massachusetts. In 1917, he was assigned to Kelly Field, Texas, where he organized and served as commandant of the Ground Officer's Training School, and later as aeronautical officer for the Southern Department and engineer officer for Kelly Field. In March 1918, he was appointed executive officer at Taliaferra Field, Texas, and a month later was placed in charge of Barron Field, Texas. In 1918, Harmon completed advanced training in pursuit aviation at Issoudun, France, and became chief of staff of the Air Service Command of the Third Army at Coblenz, Germany. On July 1, 1920, he transferred to the Air Service. Military assignment history In October 1920, Harmon was assigned as assistant executive in the Office of the Chief of the Air Service at Washington, D.C. and served as an aide at the White House. In July 1924, he was transferred to Bolling Field, and then to McCook Field, Ohio, where he entered the Air Service Engineering School, from which he graduated in August 1925. He returned to the Office of the Chief of the Air Service in 1926 as chief of the Information Division and again served as an aide at the White House. From 1927 to 1929, Harmon served as military attache for aviation in London. He then was assigned as an instructor at the United States Military Academy. In 1933, he graduated from the Air Corps Tactical School at Maxwell Field, Alabama, and in 1935, he graduated from the Command and General Staff School at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas. In 1936, he was made commander of the 19th Bombardment Group. Harmon graduated from the Army War College in 1938, and was then assigned to the War Department General Staff as chief of the Operations Branch, Personnel Division. In 1940, Harmon assumed command of the Advanced Flying School at Kelly Field, Texas, and one year later he was named commanding general of the Gulf Coast Air Corps Training Center at Randolph Field, Texas. In 1942, General Harmon was appointed commanding general of the Sixth Air Force and a month later was promoted to Major General. He was promoted to Lieutenant General on February 19, 1943. In 1943, he was appointed deputy commander for the air forces of the South Pacific Area and in January 1944 he assumed command of the 13th Air Force. In March‚ÄìJune, Harmon was commander of AirSols, all Allied air units in the Solomon Islands campaign. In June 1944, he was appointed commander of the Sixth Air Force, in the Caribbean. In 1947, General Harmon was appointed senior Air Force member of the Military and Naval Staff Committee of the United Nations in New York City. The next year, he was given the additional duty of United States delegate to the Inter-American Defense Board, and in 1949 was made special assistant for air academy matters at Air Force headquarters in Washington, D.C.. General Harmon retired from active duty February 27, 1953, but was recalled to active duty the following day with the same duties. He reverted to retired status June 30, 1953, but was again called back to active duty as a lieutenant general November 8, 1953, at the request of the President of the United States, to become special assistant to the chief of staff for air academy matters. On August 14, 1954, General Harmon became the first superintendent of the United States Air Force Academy at its temporary home in Lowry Air Force Base, Colorado. General Harmon reverted to retired status July 31, 1956, and died February 22, 1957 at Lackland Air Force Base, Texas. Awards and decorations General Harmon's decorations and awards include the Distinguished Service Medal with two oak leaf clusters, the Legion of Merit, the Distinguished Flying Cross, the Air Medal, the Commendation Ribbon, the World War I Victory Medal, the Army of Occupation of Germany Medal (World War I), the American Defense Service Medal, the American Campaign Medal; the Asiatic-Pacific Campaign Medal with three service stars, the World War II Victory Medal, the National Defense Service Medal; the Panamanian Order of Balboa; Peruvian Military Order of Ayacacho, Grand Officer; Peruvian Aviation Cross, First Class; Ecuadorian Star of Adbon Calderon, First Class, and Commander Order of Leopold (Belgium) with Palm. The main administration building at the United States Air Force Academy, Harmon Hall, is named in his honor. In 2004, Dr. James G. Roche, the Secretary of the Air Force formally proclaimed Harmon \\"Father of the Air Force Academy\\". Harmon is interred at the United States Air Force Academy Cemetery in Colorado Springs, Colorado.

Money is wagered on the best score on each of the front nine (holes 1‚Äì9), back nine (holes 10‚Äì18), and total 18 holes. The Nassau is one of golf's most classic and best known wagers. It is also known by the size of the bets, e.g. \\"2-2-2\\" or \\"5-5-5\\", and \\"Best Nines.\\" The Nassau bet gets its name from the Nassau Country Club on Long Island, where the format is said to have been invented in the early 1900s by club captain John B. Coles Tappan. In the 1900s because the players at Nassau CC were much better than the surrounding county club and always won matches against the other clubs. In fact, the other clubs would not play Nassau CC because they were tired of losing everything. To encourage future competitions, Nassau CC adopted the Nassau bet. The Nassau bet is most usually wagered in match play but can also be applied to many other playing or scoring formats. As with any golf game, players of greatly differing abilities can compete with handicaps being used to determine how many strokes one player must give another.  Nassau press  The Nassau press is a side bet, in addition to the original bet, offered during a Nassau match by the side that is losing in an effort to even their money for either the front nine, back nine or overall. If the player who \\"presses\\" (offers the press) then beats his opponent over the remaining holes on a given nine or the overall, he wins the press bet. In effect it is a double-or-nothing proposition. When a side/overall is two or more points down in the match, they may request a press. The opposition has the option to accept or reject the press, although it is usually accepted. The press bet runs for only the remaining holes to be played on either the front nine, back nine holes or overall. In addition, a press on overall (the entire 18 holes) by the losing opponent will continue throughout the match as a new bet even up at the time of the press. Press bets can themselves be pressed if the player falls two points behind on the press bet. The amount of the press bet is the same as the original match bet. For example, in a $2 Nassau, presses are for $2. This is basically a double-or-nothing proposition for the player in the lead.

Boundary line map 1768 agreed to by Indians at the Treaty of Fort Stanwix; the new red line replaced the green line of 1763  Treaty description of the line  As written with original spellings and place names; (modern names in parentheses): * \\"Beginning at the Mouth of the Cherokee or Hogohee River\\" (Tennessee River) \\"where it empties into the River Ohio\\" (at Paducah, Kentucky) * \\"& running from thence upwards along the South side of said River to Kittanning, which is above Fort Pitt\\" (Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania) * \\"from thence a direct Line to the nearest Fork of the west branch of Susquehanna * \\"thence through the Allegany Mountains along the south side of the said West Branch until it comes opposite to the mouth of a creek called Tiadaghton\\" (Pine Creek just west of Jersey Shore, Pennsylvania) * \\"thence across the West Branch along the South Side of that Creek\\" * \\"and along the North Side of Burnetts Hills to a Creek called Awandae\\" (Towanda Creek) * \\"thence down the same to the East Branch of Sasquehanna\\" (at Towanda, Pennsylvania) * \\"& across the same and up the East side of that River to Oswegy\\" (Owego, New York) * \\"from thence East to Delawar River\\" (Delaware River) * \\"and up that River to opposite where Tianaderha\\" (Unadilla River) \\"falls into Sasquehanna\\" (Susquehanna River) * \\"thence to Tianaderha\\" (New Berlin, New York?) \\"and up the West side of the West branch\\" (Beaver Creek) \\"to the head thereof\\" * \\"& thence by a direct Line to Canada Creek, where it empties into the Wood Creek at the West of the Carrying Place beyond Fort Stanwix\\" (Rome, New York). Map showing Pennsylvania and the territory involved in the purchase of 1768.  Actual line  The starting point is the confluence of the Tennessee River with the Ohio River at Paducah, Kentucky. The line follows the south bank of the Ohio almost the entire length of Kentucky and all of West Virginia to Pittsburgh where the Allegheny River joins the Monongahela River to form the Ohio. It then follows the Allegheny River north. For the line from Kittanning, Pennsylvania to the \\"nearest fork\\" of the west branch of the Susquehanna River at Cherry Tree, Pennsylvania, see the article on the Purchase line. From Cherry Tree the line followed the West Branch on its sinuous course due north and then northeast to Clearfield, Pennsylvania and then meandered through the deep gorges of the Alleghenies past Renovo, Pennsylvania, exiting the mountains into Bald Eagle Valley at Lock Haven, Pennsylvania, and then east-northeast to the confluence with Pine Creek at Jersey Shore, Pennsylvania. The next section of the line is difficult to fix, since the \\"Burnetts Hills\\" of the treaty never been positively identified. Also, the distance to follow Pine Creek, let alone which of the forks of that Creek to follow, is not specified. The only part of this section that can be definitely established is the lowest (easternmost) portion of Towanda Creek from Monroeton, Pennsylvania to Towanda, Pennsylvania. From Jersey Shore to this point there are two competing interpretations. The first interpretation is that the line was intended to follow the principal (west) branch of Towanda Creek which runs eastward along the base of the very prominent north face of Barclay Mountain (which forms the northernmost range of the Endless Mountains) from Canton, Pennsylvania to Towanda. Then the question is how the line was intended to run from Jersey Shore to Towanda Creek. This creek rises a few miles south of Canton at the watershed divide that marks the tri-point between Tioga County, Pennsylvania, Bradford County, Pennsylvania, and Lycoming County, Pennsylvania. Most likely, the line was intended to reach the Towanda Creek headwaters along the headwaters of Lycoming Creek, which flows southwest along the base of Barclay Mountain to Roaring Branch, Pennsylvania, where it is joined by Roaring Branch which itself follows the base of Laurel Hill upstream in the same direction from a watershed divide at Jackson Corners on US 15\\\\. This is then the headwaters of Blockhouse Creek which flows in the same direction into Little Pine Creek, which flows into Pine Creek at Waterville; from there Pine Creek flows down to the West Branch at Jersey Shore, Pennsylvania. A second interpretation is based primarily on the existence of a Burnett's Ridge in Lycoming County on the east of PA14 beginning at Bodines south of Ralston, Pennsylvania and running east into Sullivan County, Pennsylvania; on its plateau are the headwaters of Schrader Creek, a major tributary of Towanda Creek which flows to the south of Barclay Mountain. The line would presumably follow Pleasant Stream upstream from Lycoming Creek at Marsh Hill, Pennsylvania to the watershed divide near Wheelerville in Sullivan County and then down Schrader Creek; this is the route later taken by the Susquehanna and New York Railroad and is the easiest and most direct footpath between the two branches of the Susquehanna River. The difficulty with the second interpretation is that it would require the line to follow Lycoming Creek which flows into the West Branch just west of Williamsport, Pennsylvania, not Pine Creek. This would require the identification of \\"Tiadaghton\\" with the Lycoming, which is contrary to many other documented uses of the \\"Tiadaghton\\" name. The line would then have continued some miles down the Susquehanna from Pine Creek before turning into the hills. The sketch map of 1768 is ambiguous and its geometry is very poor, but it seems to favor the second interpretation. It seems to show a section of the West Branch between what is labeled the Tiadaghton (Pine Creek) and the stream actually followed by the line somewhat to the east; this would appear to be Lycoming Creek. The second interpretation would have been in favor of the Indians, adding the valley lands from Jersey Shore to Williamsport and a large hunting area at the headwaters of Pine Creek to their portion. Map from The Old New York Frontier by Francis W. Halsey (1901) showing the author's interpretation of the 1768 Fort Stanwix Treaty line From Towanda, the Pennsylvania line followed the East Branch of the Susquehanna River upstream past Tioga Point (present day Athens, Pennsylvania) and then east to Owego, New York. The section of the line east from Owego is also troublesome, because of the faulty geographic references of the negotiators. The line was to follow a straight line from Owego east to the Delaware River and upriver to a point due south of the confluence of the Unadilla River and east branch of the Susquehanna River just west of Sidney, New York. Apparently the surveys of the day were too poor to realize that a line due east from Owego at the Owego Creek/Susquehanna confluence (at 42¬∞ 05' 41\\"N) would not have intersected the Delaware River before reaching the line directly south from the mouth of the Unadilla. The sketch map of 1768 places the Delaware much too far north, and shows the projected east-west line intersecting it below the confluence of the East Branch at Hancock, which is actually considerably to the south of the latitude of Owego. Thus at some point the line was adjusted to the Oquaga Creek/Delaware River confluence (at 42¬∞ 03' 27\\"N) at Deposit, New York, which forms a natural corner point at the big bend in the West Branch of the Delaware. It is probable that this portion of the line was never surveyed before the Revolution, but instead a north- south line (present-day boundary between the towns of Tioga and Owego in Tioga County, New York) was dropped from Owego to the New York‚ÄìPennsylvania border near the 42nd parallel north sometime after this border was surveyed in 1786, and the Delaware River was followed a few miles upstream (north) from the initial monument of this border near the 42nd parallel north to reach Deposit. The line to the mouth of the Unadilla was then drawn straight from Deposit, a bit east of north. This is the modern-day boundary between Broome County, New York and Chenango County, New York (west or Indian side) and Delaware County, New York (east or Colonial side). The Unadilla River then forms the modern-day boundary between Chenango County, New York (west) and Otsego County, New York (east); the \\"west branch of the Tianaderha\\" referred to is not the modern West Branch of the Unadilla that rises near Bridgewater, New York, but rather Beaver Creek a few miles to the west that flows through Brookfield, New York to join the Unadilla near New Berlin, New York; Beaver Creek rises at approximately 42¬∞ 55' 11\\" N, 75¬∞ 19' 01\\" W) near Hobin Corners on US 20\\\\. The line then strikes out in a NW direction towards the named confluence (43¬∞ 13' 33\\" N, 75¬∞ 32' 39\\" W) west of present-day Rome, New York, near East Verona, New York. This is a few miles west of Rome, so that Fort Stanwix fell in lands assigned to the Colonials. The line as finally surveyed went through the Hamilton College campus on College Hill just west of Clinton, New York where there are two stone markers.  Consequences  The first clause effectively cedes most of modern-day Kentucky and West Virginia to the Virginia colony. This line substantially enlarged the Colonial area designated in the Royal Proclamation of 1763, especially in Pennsylvania. It also included a slice of New York State east of the Unadilla and west of the previous line of settlement near Cherry Valley. Thus the Iroquois ceded only a small area in New York state, a larger area in Pennsylvania, and a huge tract that was in fact south of their area of control.

Overview The main areas of noise mitigation or abatement are: transportation noise control, architectural design, urban planning through zoning codes,Benz Kotzen, \\"Noise is an urban issue\\" and occupational noise control. Roadway noise and aircraft noise are the most pervasive sources of environmental noise. Social activities may generate noise levels that consistently affect the health of populations residing in or occupying areas, both indoor and outdoor, near entertainment venues that feature amplified sounds and music that present significant challenges for effective noise mitigation strategies. Multiple techniques have been developed to address interior sound levels, many of which are encouraged by local building codes. In the best case of project designs, planners are encouraged to work with design engineers to examine trade-offs of roadway design and architectural design. These techniques include design of exterior walls, party walls, and floor and ceiling assemblies; moreover, there are a host of specialized means for damping reverberation from special-purpose rooms such as auditoria, concert halls, entertainment and social venues, dining areas, audio recording rooms, and meeting rooms. Many of these techniques rely upon material science applications of constructing sound baffles or using sound- absorbing liners for interior spaces. Industrial noise control is a subset of interior architectural control of noise, with emphasis on specific methods of sound isolation from industrial machinery and for protection of workers at their task stations. Sound masking is the active addition of noise to reduce the annoyance of certain sounds; the opposite of soundproofing.  Standards, recommendations, and guidelines  Organizations each have their own standards, recommendations/guidelines, and directives for what levels of noise workers are permitted to be around before noise controls must be put into place.  Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA)  OSHA's requirements state that when workers are exposed to noise levels above 90 A-weighted decibels (dBA) in 8-hour time-weighted averages (TWA), administrative controls and/or new engineering controls must be implemented in the workplace. OSHA also requires that impulse noises and impact noises must be controlled to prevent these noises reaching past 140 dB peak sound pressure levels (SPL).Occupational Health and Safety Administration. (1983). Occupational noise exposure; hearing conservation amendment, Occupational Safety and Health Administration, 29 CFR 1910.95. Federal Register. 48(46): 9738-9785.  Mine Safety and Health Organization (MSHA)  MSHA requires that administrative and/or engineering controls must be implemented in the workplace when miners are exposed to levels above 90 dBA TWA. If noise levels exceed 115 dBA, miners are required to wear hearing protection. MSHA, therefore, requires that noise levels be reduced below 115 dB TWA. Measuring noise levels for noise control decision making must integrate all noises from 90dBA to 140 dBA. Mine Safety and Health Administration. (1999).

Federal Railroad Association (FRA)  The FRA recommends that worker exposure to noise should be reduced when their noise exposure exceeds 90 dBA for an 8-hour TWA.

Approaches to noise control  An effective model for noise control is the source, path, and receiver model by Bolt and Ingard. Hazardous noise can be controlled by reducing the noise output at its source, minimizing the noise as it travels along a path to the listener, and providing equipment to the listener or receiver to attenuate the noise.  Source  A variety of measures aim to reduce hazardous noise at its source. Programs such as Buy Quiet and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) Prevention through design promote research and design of quiet equipment and renovation and replacement of older hazardous equipment with modern technologies.  Path  The principle of noise reduction through pathway modifications applies to the alteration of direct and indirect pathways for noise. Noise that travels across reflective surfaces, such as smooth floors, can be hazardous. Pathway alterations include physical materials, such as foam, absorb sound and walls to provide a sound barrier that modifies existing systems that decrease hazardous noise. Sound dampening enclosures for loud equipment and isolation chambers from which workers can remotely control equipment can also be designed. These methods prevent sound from traveling along a path to the worker or other listeners.  Receiver  In the industrial or commercial setting, workers must comply with the appropriate Hearing conservation program. Administrative controls, such as the restriction of personnel in noisy areas, prevents unnecessary noise exposure. Personal protective equipment such as foam ear plugs or ear muffs to attenuate sound provide a last line of defense for the listener.  Basic technologies  * Sound insulation: prevent the transmission of noise by the introduction of a mass barrier. Common materials have high-density properties such as brick, thick glass, concrete, metal etc. * Sound absorption: a porous material which acts as a ‚Äònoise sponge‚Äô by converting the sound energy into heat within the material. Common sound absorption materials include decoupled lead-based tiles, open cell foams and fiberglass * Vibration damping: applicable for large vibrating surfaces. The damping mechanism works by extracting the vibration energy from the thin sheet and dissipating it as heat. A common material is sound deadened steel. * Vibration isolation: prevents transmission of vibration energy from a source to a receiver by introducing a flexible element or a physical break. Common vibration isolators are springs, rubber mounts, cork etc. Roadways This noise abatement wall in The Netherlands has a transparent section at the driver's eye-level to reduce the visual impact for road users. Source control in roadway noise has provided little reduction in vehicle noise, except for the development of the hybrid vehicle; nevertheless, hybrid use will need to attain a market share of roughly fifty percent to have a major impact on noise source reduction of city streets. Highway noise is today less affected by motor type, since the effects in higher speed are aerodynamic and tire noise related. Other contributions to the reduction of noise at the source are: improved tire tread designs for trucks in the 1970s, better shielding of diesel stacks in the 1980s, and local vehicle regulation of unmuffled vehicles. The most fertile areas for roadway noise mitigation are in urban planning decisions, roadway design, noise barrier design,Benz Kotzen and Colin English, Environmental Noise Barriers: A Guide to Their Visual and Acoustic Design, Spon Press, United Kingdom (1999) speed control, surface pavement selection, and truck restrictions. Speed control is effective since the lowest sound emissions arise from vehicles moving smoothly at 30 to 60 kilometers per hour. Above that range, sound emissions double with every five miles per hour of speed. At the lowest speeds, braking and (engine) acceleration noise dominates. Selection of road surface pavement can make a difference of a factor of two in sound levels, for the speed regime above 30 kilometers per hour. Quieter pavements are porous with a negative surface texture and use small to medium-sized aggregates; the loudest pavements have transversely-grooved surfaces, positive surface textures, and larger aggregates. Surface friction and roadway safety are important considerations as well for pavement decisions. When designing new urban freeways or arterials, there are numerous design decisions regarding alignment and roadway geometrics.Myer Kutz, Handbook of Transportation Engineering, McGraw-Hill (2004) Use of a computer model to calculate sound levels has become standard practice since the early 1970s. In this way exposure of sensitive receptors to elevated sound levels can be minimized. An analogous process exists for urban mass transit systems and other rail transportation decisions. Early examples of urban rail systems designed using this technology were: Boston MBTA line expansions (1970s), San Francisco BART system expansion (1981), Houston METRORail system (1982), and the MAX Light Rail system in Portland, Oregon (1983). Noise barriers can be applied to existing or planned surface transportation projects. They are one of the most effective actions taken in retrofitting existing roadways and commonly can reduce adjacent land-use sound levels by up to ten decibels. A computer model is required to design the barrier since terrain, micrometeorology and other locale-specific factors make the endeavor a very complex undertaking. For example, a roadway in cut or strong prevailing winds can produce a setting where atmospheric sound propagation is unfavorable to any noise barrier. Aircraft An Airbus A321 of British Airways on its landing approach to London Heathrow Airport, showing its proximity to homes. As in the case of roadway noise, little progress has been made in quelling aircraft noise at the source, other than elimination of loud engine designs from the 1960s and earlier. Because of its velocity and volume, jet turbine engine exhaust noise defies reduction by any simple means. The most promising forms of aircraft noise abatement are through land planning, flight operations restrictions and residential soundproofing. Flight restrictions can take the form of preferred runway use, departure flight path and slope, and time-of-day restrictions. These tactics are sometimes controversial since they can impact aircraft safety, flying convenience and airline economics. In 1979, the US Congress authorizedAviation Safety and Noise Abatement Act of 1979 (ASNAA), 49 U.S.C. 47501-47510 the FAA to devise technology and programs to attempt to insulate homes near airports. While this obviously does not aid the exterior environment, the program has been effective for residential and school interiors. Some of the airports at which the technology was applied early on were San Francisco International Airport,Final Report for the Aircraft Noise Insulation Project for San Francisco International Airport: Phase one Pilot Project, FAA funded and prepared for the city of South San Francisco, Earth Metrics Inc., Burlingame, California, July, 1986 Seattle-Tacoma International Airport, John Wayne International Airport and San Jose International AirportC.M. Hogan and Ballard George, Pilot Noise Residential Insulation Program, San Jose International Airport (1983) in California. The underlying technology is a computer model which simulates the propagation of aircraft noise and its penetration into buildings. Variations in aircraft types, flight patterns and local meteorology can be analyzed along with benefits of alternative building retrofit strategies such as roof upgrading, window glazing improvement, fireplace baffling, caulking construction seams and other measures. The computer model allows cost-effectiveness evaluations of a host of alternative strategies. In Canada, Transport Canada prepares noise exposure forecasts (NEF) for each airport, using a computer model similar to that used in the US. Residential land development is discouraged within high impact areas identified by the forecast.Transport Canada In 1998, the flight paths across all of Scandinavia were changed as the new Oslo-Gardermoen Airport was opened. These new paths were straighter, reducing fuel use and disturbing fewer people; however, vociferous protests came from people near the new paths who had not been disturbed before, and they took legal action (NIMBY effect). Architectural solutions Sound treatment panels contrast with red curtains in a church meeting hall Soundproof doors in a broadcast center Acoustic ceiling tiles Architectural acoustics noise control practices include interior sound reverberation reduction, inter-room noise transfer mitigation, and exterior building skin augmentation. In the case of construction of new (or remodeled) apartments, condominiums, hospitals, and hotels, many states and cities have stringent building codes with requirements of acoustical analysis, in order to protect building occupants. With regard to exterior noise, the codes usually require measurement of the exterior acoustic environment in order to determine the performance standard required for exterior building skin design. The architect can work with the acoustical scientist to arrive at the best cost-effective means of creating a quiet interior (normally 45 dBA). The most important elements of design of the building skin are usually: glazing (glass thickness, double pane design etc.), perforated metal (used internally or externally), roof material, caulking standards, chimney baffles, exterior door design, mail slots, attic ventilation ports, and mounting of through-the-wall air conditioners. Regarding sound generated inside the building, there are two principal types of transmission. Firstly, airborne sound travels through walls or floor and ceiling assemblies and can emanate from either human activities in adjacent living spaces or from mechanical noise within the building systems. Human activities might include voice, noise from amplified sound systems, or animal noise. Mechanical systems are elevator systems, boilers, refrigeration or air conditioning systems, generators and trash compactors. Aerodynamic sources include fans, pneumatics, and combustion. Noise control for aerodynamic sources include quiet air nozzles, pneumatic silencers and quiet fan technology. Since many mechanical sounds are inherently loud, the principal design element is to require the wall or ceiling assembly to meet certain performance standards,Cyril M. Harris, Noise Control in Buildings: A Practical Guide for Architects and Engineers (1994) (typically Sound transmission class of 50), which allows considerable attenuation of the sound level reaching occupants. The second type of interior sound is called Impact Insulation Class (IIC) transmission. This effect arises not from airborne transmission, but rather from the transmission of sound through the building itself. The most common perception of IIC noise is from the footfall of occupants in living spaces above. Low-frequency noise is transferred easily through the ground and buildings. This type of noise is more difficult to abate, but consideration must be given to isolating the floor assembly above or hanging the lower ceiling on resilient channel. Both of the transmission effects noted above may emanate either from building occupants or from building mechanical systems such as elevators, plumbing systems or heating, ventilating and air conditioning units. In some cases, it is merely necessary to specify the best available quieting technology in selecting such building hardware. In other cases, shock mounting of systems to control vibration may be in order. In the case of plumbing systems, there are specific protocols developed, especially for water supply lines, to create isolation clamping of pipes within building walls. In the case of central air systems, it is important to baffle any ducts that could transmit sound between different building areas. Designing special- purpose rooms has more exotic challenges, since these rooms may have requirements for unusual features such as concert performance, sound studio recording, lecture halls. In these cases reverberation and reflection must be analyzed in order to not only quiet the rooms, but to prevent echo effects from occurring. In these situations special sound baffles and sound absorptive lining materials may be specified to dampen unwanted effects. Post- Architectural solutions Acoustical wall and ceiling panels are a common commercial and residential solution for noise control in already-constructed buildings. Acoustic panels may be constructed of a variety of materials, though commercial acoustic applications will frequently be composed of fiberglass or mineral wool-based acoustic substrates. For example, Mineral fiberboard is a commonly used acoustical substrate, and commercial thermal insulations, such as those used in the insulation of boiler tanks, are frequently repurposed for noise-controlling acoustic use based on their effectiveness at minimizing reverberations. The ideal acoustical panels are those without a face or finish material that could interfere with the performance of the acoustical infill, but aesthetic and safety concerns typically lead to fabric coverings or other finishing materials to minimize impedance. Panel finishings are occasionally made of a porous configuration of wood or metal. The effectiveness of post-construction acoustic treatment is limited by the amount of space able to be allocated to acoustic treatment, and so on-site acoustical wall panels are frequently made to conform to the shape of the preexisting space. This is done by \\"framing\\" the perimeter track into shape, infilling the acoustical substrate and then stretching and tucking the fabric into the perimeter frame system. On-site wall panels can be constructed to work around door frames, baseboard, or any other intrusion. Large panels (generally greater than 50 feet) can be created on walls and ceilings with this method. Double-glazed and thicker windows can also prevent sound transmission from the outdoors. Industrial Industrial noise is traditionally associated with manufacturing settings where industrial machinery produces intense sound levels,Randall F Barron and Barron F Barron, Industrial Noise Control and Acoustics, Marcel Dekker, New York (2002) often upwards of 85 decibels. While this circumstance is the most dramatic, there are many other work environments where sound levels may lie in the range of 70 to 75 decibels, entirely composed of office equipment, music, public address systems, and even exterior noise intrusion. Either type of environment may result in noise health effects if the sound intensity and exposure time is too great. In the case of industrial equipment, the most common techniques for noise protection of workers consist of shock mounting source equipment, creation of acrylic glass or other solid barriers, and provision of ear protection equipment. In certain cases the machinery itself can be re-designed to operate in a manner less prone to produce grating, grinding, frictional, or other motions that induce sound emissions. In recent years, Buy Quiet programs and initiatives have arisen in an effort to combat occupational noise exposures. These programs promote the purchase of quieter tools and equipment and encourage manufacturers to design quieter equipment.CDC - Buy Quiet - NIOSH Workplace Safety and Health Topics In the case of more conventional office environments, the techniques in architectural acoustics discussed above may apply. Other solutions may involve researching the quietest models of office equipment, particularly printers and photocopy machines. Impact printers and other equipment were often fitted with \\"acoustic hoods\\", enclosures to reduce emitted noise. One source of annoying, if not loud, sound level emissions are lighting fixtures (notably older fluorescent globes). These fixtures can be retrofitted or analyzed to see whether over-illumination is present, a common office environment issue. If over-illumination is occurring, de-lamping or reduced light bank usage may apply. Photographers can quieten noisy still cameras on a film set using sound blimps. Commercial Reductions in cost of technology have allowed noise control technology to be used not only in performance facilities and recording studios, but also in noise-sensitive small businesses such as restaurants. Acoustically absorbent materials such as fiberglass duct liner, wood fiber panels and recycled denim jeans serve as artwork-bearing canvasses in environments in which aesthetics are important. Using a combination of sound absorption materials, arrays of microphones and speakers, and a digital processor, a restaurant operator can use a tablet computer to selectively control noise levels at different places in the restaurant: the microphone arrays pick up sound and send it to the digital processor, which controls the speakers to output sound signals on command. Residential Post-construction residential acoustic treatment throughout the 20th century was only commonly the practice of music-listening enthusiasts. However, developments in home recording technology and fidelity have led to a drastic increase in the spread and popularity of residential acoustic treatment in the pursuit of home recording fidelity and accuracy. A large secondary market of homemade and home use acoustic panels, bass trap, and similar constructed products has developed resulting from this demand, with many small companies and individuals wrapping industrial and commercial- grade insulations in fabric for use in home recording studios, theatre rooms, and music practice spaces. Urban planning Communities may use zoning codes to isolate noisy urban activities from areas that should be protected from such unhealthy exposures and to establish noise standards in areas that may not be conducive to such isolation strategies. Because low-income neighborhoods are often at greater risk of noise pollution, the establishment of such zoning codes is often an environmental justice issue.

Created by Dan Jurgens, he made his debut in Superman vol. 2, #60 (October 1991), and was later given his own solo adventure in Agent Liberty Special # 1 (1992). Sam Witwer portrayed a version of the character in the fourth season of Supergirl. Witwer returned in the 100th episode of the fifth season. Fictional character biography Benjamin Lockwood once worked for the CIA but ultimately left in disgust at their methods and the types of missions he was being asked to undertake. He became so disenchanted with the Federal Government as a whole that he joined the paramilitary group called the Sons of Liberty, who outfitted him with the outfit and equipment to become Agent Liberty. As Agent Liberty, Lockwood helped to forward the Sons' cause of overturning the governmental regime which brought him into conflict with Superman, though he later briefly assisted the Justice League in battling Brainiac in the crossover Panic in the Sky. However, when the Sons asked him to assassinate politician Pete Ross, Lockwood refused and helped to bring down the group by sending vital information to reporter Clark Kent (Superman's secret civilian identity). Lockwood later learns that one of the founders of the Sons of Liberty was his former CIA mentor, and he became so disgusted with this revelation that he burned his Agent Liberty costume, vowing to never adopt the persona again. However, Lockwood subsequently becomes one of the many unwillingly brainwashed victims of a cult started by Brainiac and takes up the Agent Liberty identity once more.Birds of Prey #72 (October 2004).

Sam Witwer portrays a loose adaptation of Agent Liberty on Supergirl, set within The CW's live-action Arrowverse. Introduced as the \\"ruthless and terrifying\\" villain of the fourth season, this version of the character is depicted as \\"a brilliant orator in the guise of a family man\\" who has \\"eerie abilities of persuasion and manipulation\\". Benjamin \\"Ben\\" Lockwood was once a mild-mannered college history professor who only became an anti-alien activist after losing his home and father Peter (portrayed by Xander Berkeley) during the Daxamite invasion and Reign's terraforming of Earth, respectively. Upon being fired by the university for his anti-alien opinions, Ben was approached by Lex Luthor's subordinates, Mercy and Otis Graves, who gave him the gear to become a self-proclaimed \\"Agent of Liberty\\". As Agent Liberty, Ben founds the Children of Liberty, a human-supremacist group that supports a human-first world order, to rid National City of all alien life whilst keeping these activities a secret from his wife Lydia (portrayed by Sarah Smyth) and son George (portrayed by Graham Verchere). He later defeats reporter Kara Danvers, Supergirl's secret civilian identity, during an alien debate on national television, prompting the network to offer him his very own weekly show named \\"The Lockdown\\". Ben is arrested after Supergirl learns of Agent Liberty's true identity with the help of the DEO, and a large crowd of human rights activists led by Lydia then rallies outside National City Men's Central Jail to protest his imprisonment. Ben is given a full pardon by President Phil Baker, who answers to Lex, on the technicality that all of his victims were aliens rather than humans. He is promoted by Baker as the Director of Alien Affairs for the US government and repeals the Alien Amnesty Act. After Red Daughter poses as Supergirl and attacks the White House at Lex's request, Baker enforces martial law and deputizes Ben's Children of Liberty, giving them access to weapons from the DEO to begin rounding up aliens on the streets. Ben later injects himself with Lena Luthor's experimental \\"Harun-El\\" serum and gains superhuman abilities to avenge Lydia's death at the hands of one such alien. Upon learning that Lex was the one who orchestrated his rise within the government, Ben kills Otis and attacks Luthor's base of operations on Shelley Island with his Children of Liberty only to encounter Supergirl's team instead. In the ensuing battle, Ben is cured of the Harun-El by James Olsen, thus stripping him of his powers before he and his men are arrested by Alex Danvers. While incarcerated, Ben is enraged to see George blaming him for Lydia's murder and denouncing his anti-alien campaign on national television. In the fifth season episode \\"It's a Super Life\\", Mister Mxyzptlk presents an alternate reality where Supergirl revealed her identity to Lena from the start in which Ben's family died jumping off a building thinking that Supergirl would save them only for her not to show up. This led to Ben becoming Agent Liberty to abduct Lena and Thomas Coville with Otis' help in order to coerce Supergirl into revealing her identity. This led to the Children of Liberty killing Kara's loved ones.

It was one of the Highway Acts 1835 to 1885.The Short Titles Act 1896, section 2(1) and Schedule 2 Parish boards The Highway Act 1835 placed highways under the direction of parish surveyors, and allowed them to pay for the costs involved by rates levied on the occupiers of land. The surveyor's duty is to keep the highways in repair, and if a highway is out of repair, the surveyor may be summoned before the courts and ordered to complete the repairs within a limited time. The surveyor is also charged with the removal of nuisances on the highway. A highway nuisance may be abated by any person, and may be made the subject of indictment at common law. The board consists of representatives of the various parishes, called way wardens together with the justices for the county residing within the district. Salaries and similar expenses incurred by the board are charged on a district fund to which the several parishes contribute; but each parish remains separately responsible for the expenses of maintaining its own highways. The amending acts, while not interfering with the operation of the principal act, authorize the creation of highway districts on a larger scale. The justices of a county may convert it or any portion of it into a highway district to be governed by a highway board, the powers and responsibilities of which will be the same as those of the parish surveyor under the former act. New road offences The Highway Act 1835 specified as offences for which the driver of a carriage on the public highway might be punished by a fine, in addition to any civil action that might be brought against him: *Riding upon the cart, or upon any horse drawing it, and not having some other person to guide it, unless there be some person driving it.The Highway Act 1835, section 78: \\"That if the Driver of any Drivers of Waggon, Cart, or other Carriage of any Kind shall ride upon any such Carriage, or upon any Horse or Horses drawing the same, on any Highway, not having some other Person on Foot or on Horseback unless some to guide the same (such Carriages and Carts as are driven with Reins, other Person and are conducted by some Person holding the Reins of all the Horses guide them. drawing the same, excepted)\\" *Negligence causing damage to person or goods being conveyed on the highwayThe Highway Act 1835, section 78 *Quitting his cart, or leaving control of the horses, or leaving the cart so as to be an obstruction on the highway. *Not having the owner's name painted up.The Highway Act 1835, section 76 *Refusing to give the same. *Driving animals or a 'carriage of any description' on the footway.The Highway Act 1835, section 72: \\"If any person shall wilfully ride upon any footpath or causeway by the side of any road made or set apart for the use or accommodation of foot passengers; or shall wilfully lead or drive any horse, ass, sheep, mule, swine, or cattle or carriage of any description, or any truck or sledge, upon any such footpath or causeway; or shall tether any horse, ass, mule, swine, or cattle, on any highway, so as to suffer or permit the tethered animal to be thereon.\\" (Section 72 - see below for details) *Not keeping on the left or near side of the road, when meeting any other carriage or horse. This rule does not apply in the case of a carriage meeting a foot- passenger, but a driver is bound to use due care to avoid driving against any person crossing the highway on foot. At the same time a passenger crossing the highway is also bound to use due care in avoiding vehicles, and the mere fact of a driver being on the wrong side of the road would not be evidence of negligence in such a case. *The playing of football on public highways, with a maximum penalty of forty shillings.The Highway Act 1835, section 72 (since repealed) if any person [...] shall play at Foot-ball or any other Game on any Part of the said Highways, to the Annoyance of any Passenger or Passengers [... shall] pay any Sum not exceeding Forty Shillings Section 72 Section 72 provides: \\"If any person shall wilfully ride upon any footpath or causeway by the side of any road made or set apart for the use or accommodation of foot passengers; or shall wilfully lead or drive any horse, ass, sheep, mule, swine, or cattle or carriage of any description, or any truck or sledge, upon any such footpath or causeway; or shall tether any horse, ass, mule, swine, or cattle, on any highway, so as to suffer or permit the tethered animal to be thereon.\\" This clause is referred to by the current Highway Code: (The offence of driving on a bridleway is covered by a later act)(The Department for Transport cited this section in 2006 when it ruled that Segways could not be legally used on pavements in the United Kingdom.) 1973 Related and subsequent acts The Public Health Act 1875 vested the powers and duties of surveyors of highways and vestries in urban authorities, The Local Government Act 1888 threw the entire maintenance of main roads upon county councils.

Fred later appeared in commercials for other products promoted by the chain, such as Dunkin Donuts Cereal, as well as new introductions such as muffins or products such as coffee, which followed the same idea: Fred getting up early to have the product freshly made every business day, then cheerfully greeting customers with fresh products. Sometimes commercials would not be about Fred's work, but rather showing the inferiority of supermarket bakeries or showing Fred waiting on modish 1980s customers while going into a black and white kitchen full of 1940s employees working to swing music, denoting quality has not changed throughout the years. Fred the Baker was so popular with consumers that when Dunkin' Donuts decided to retire the character, the chain surveyed customers to determine the reaction to the move.

Coat of arms and motto The coat of arms shows Queen Margaret, richly habited and crowned bearing in her right hand a sceptre and in her left a book all proper between two trees of knowledge, to remind us of the remote 12th century, when a bishop of St. Andrews, in whose diocese Stirling was, gave to Queen Margaret's Church of the Holy Trinity of Dunfermline the churches of Perth and Stirling and their schools. The wolf, couchant gardant, at the Queen's feet is taken from the \\"Small\\" Burgh seal, and reflects the early interest in education taken by the magistrates of the Royal Burgh, for later charters speak of scholam de Striuelin, and Scholam ejusdam ville, which suggest that the 'Church' school fairly soon became the town's school. The Latin motto Tempori Parendum translates to 'Be prepared for your time'. The Old School The 1850s building The previous, 1960s era, High School of Stirling building The High School of Stirling has been housed in several buildings over the course of its long history. In 1856 the high school was housed in a specially created building on Spittal Street. This building housed the classrooms for Mathematics, English, Modern Languages, Art, Classics; as well as a Gymnasium, and an Observatory on the roof. This school stayed open until 1962, long after the Education (Scotland) Act 1872 which made education compulsory for children aged 5 to 13 and dramatically increased the intake of pupils for the school, when the school moved from its place at the top of the town, to Torbrex - the previous position of the High School. The building the old school was housed in is now the Stirling Highland Hotel. The school's home from 1962 to 2008 was near the village of Torbrex. Through the various relocations great care has been taken to ensure the history of the School has been retained. This has resulted in a dedicated 'Heritage Room' being included in both the 1960s and 2008 buildings. This room is managed by the Former Pupil Association and houses the school Remembrance Book, various whole school photographs and oak panelling from the Rector's office of the Spittal Street Building. Also moved was the War Memorial Window, stained glass windows from the 1850s building and the House Captain Board listing the recipients of the School Dux Award and the names of the Head Boys and Girls.

The region is close to the north shore of Lake Erie, with a moderate climate and sandy, silt-loam soils that are well-suited to a wide variety of crops. High-value horticultural crops thrive in this region, including 90% of all tobacco grown in Canada. Members of Parliament elected to ridings in the Ontario tobacco belt have strong pro-tobacco policies in addition to other policies in the interest of their rural constituents. Historically, the Ontario tobacco belt is composed of the rural area immediately surrounding the towns of Delhi, Aylmer and Tillsonburg. Additional tobacco farms can be found in Prince Edward Island, Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, and near Joliette, Quebec. History United Empire Loyalists introduced the tobacco crop after fleeing northwards from their established farms following the American Revolution. However, the first official tobacco plot wasn't planted in Norfolk County until 1920. From the beginning of the 20th century to the 1960s, the coastal portion of the Ontario tobacco belt was threatened with desertification. Only by planting coniferous seedlings was the desertification finally stopped. More than 25% of Norfolk County is considered to be forested.Report on Tree Conservation By- Laws in Southern Ontario at Tree Canada The Ontario tobacco belt would experience its economic zenith during the 1950s and 1960s. During those decades, most communities in the Ontario belt (as well as their residents) were reasonably affluent from the economic gains that the tobacco farms made. The song Tillsonburg by classic country music performer Stompin' Tom Connors would capture the hard working spirit of the Ontario tobacco belt during the middle of the 20th century. A devastating tornado that started in nearby Woodstock would devastate several tobacco farms in the tobacco belt back during the late 1970s.Newark, M. (Autumn 1979). The Woodstock Tornado. Chinook, 1, 9. Recent tornadoes have not been as severe as the one that occurred in the summer of 1979, even when taking global warming into account. While Canadian tobacco farmers (especially those in the Ontario tobacco belt) see themselves as \\"innocent victims\\" of government tobacco regulations, most of them started farming after provincial governments throughout Canada began introducing policies aimed at limiting tobacco consumption. As the older farmers retire, their children will most likely seek different career paths. Tobacco farms would eventually be sold to their neighbours; this has a domino effect. This domino effect ultimately results in fewer farmers having more acreage creating a further sense of economic inequality in the area. Recent history Tobacco farm in Norfolk County, summer 2012. The longstanding dominance of tobacco in the region has been on the wane in recent years. In 2002, politicians from the Ontario tobacco belt opposed several anti-smoking measures, causing a non-smoking group to give the Ontario government a failing grade at that time. The tobacco belt members of Provincial Parliament were responsible for scaling back a proposed tobacco tax from $10/carton to $5/carton. They failed to implement a public smoking ban (until the Smoke Free Ontario law was passed in 2006). On August 8, 2008, tobacco farmers in this region were given $300 million to buy out their entire tobacco quota. All of the money was raised from a $1,000,000,000 fine against Imperial Tobacco and Rothman's Benson & Hedges. After receiving the money, farmers that signed the buy-out are permitted to grow any crop except for tobacco; switching to raising livestock like cattle, poultry, or pigs is completely legal under this plan. Only about one thousand farm families still produce tobacco in the entire belt. Motivation to cease tobacco farming has been accelerated by health issues and high tobacco taxes. Farmers who never agreed to the tobacco buy-out may grow as much tobacco as their farmland allows through a special tobacco growing licence that was created on the week of May 15, 2009. Relatives of the farmers (either blood relatives or relatives through marriage) who agreed to the buy-out can still grow tobacco on the original farmer's land with a tobacco growing licence. However, this right does not extend to the farmer himself who can still manage the farm but not own it in his name. Farmers must also find a company that will buy his product; otherwise he cannot grow tobacco until next year. Attempts by local youth sports leagues to prohibit the usage of tobacco amongst players, coaches, referees, and even spectators has been successful in a region that was once dominated by the massive profits of Big Tobacco. Currently, Tillsonburg is under a strict bylaw aimed at reducing levels of outdoor second-hand smoke. This by-law was passed on May 14, 2012 by Tillsonburg Town council; prohibiting the usage of tobacco and tobacco-related products within of certain buildings intended for families and/or children. Jobs Most of the Ontario tobacco belt also belongs to the Green Energy Hub; an environmental region in Southern Ontario that is dedicated to creating \\"green\\" jobs through solar panels, wind turbines, and recycled rain water. Delhi, once considered to be the \\"heart of the Ontario tobacco belt,\\" historically had transient adolescent workers that could find employment quickly. The local police force started to take a less tolerant stand towards these job seekers in the later years when they started to threaten the employment of local workers. As urbanization continues to claim the Niagara Peninsula, displaced farmers will come to the Ontario tobacco belt seeking acres of land to farm. European farmers have bought farmland in massive amounts throughout the course of the Great Recession; fleeing the bleak prospect of farming land between airstrips in their native Europe. Their expertise in growing non-tobacco crops will forever change the economy of communities like Tillsonburg and Delhi. Tobacco labourers will easily transition over into their new jobs in horticulture labour. Most of the jobs will involve heavy labour and no additional skills would be needed for the Jamaican and Mexican transient labourers who \\"reside\\" in the tobacco belt region from March to November. Farm operators within the Ontario tobacco belt are 55 years old on average as of December 14, 2012 because operating a farm consists of long hours, intensive physical labour and little pay. Despite the recent economic woes, young people find greater job security working at urban office jobs than operating a rural farm in either Norfolk or Oxford County. Factories once operated in the Ontario tobacco belt; especially in the town of Simcoe. During the 42 years that it was operating, the metal-can manufacturing plant owned by The American Can Company employed many local residents. The Canadian Canning Company, which had been in operation in Simcoe since the 1870s, was a primary customer for some of the products of the American Can Plant, and was a producer of canned fruit, vegetable, and processed prepared foodstuffs, such as soup. This processing plant relied heavily on fruit and vegetables produced locally. In 1991, the Robinson Street manufacturing plants closed. The shutdown of the plants can be partially attributed to the recession of the early 1990s.American Canning Company historical information at UER.ca Delhi Industries and Delhi Foundry once offered non-tobacco jobs to Delhi. They both eventually closed due to the changing Canadian economy that emphasized more on service jobs than jobs in traditional manufacturing fields. Delhi Industries lasted until the midst of the Canadian economic recession when it closed down in March 2010; terminating 61 Canadian jobs on a permanent basis. They once made fans and blowers for industrial operations in the region. 2600 people have officially joined the Norfolk County workforce between June 2012 and June 2013. Businesses have been expanding throughout Norfolk County again; often hiring people two at a time. Innovative business running measures are also improving the quality of life for Norfolk County residents who are members of the workforce. The economy of the Greater Toronto Area along with the rest of the world may become further interconnected with the changing economy of the Ontario tobacco belt. The well-established banks are removing their presence away from the rural communities of the Ontario tobacco belt at a fast pace. Places like Service Ontario and the Backus Heritage Conservation Area may have to shutter their doors after the departure of CIBC; leading to an almost- immediate loss of jobs within the tobacco belt.CIBC will transfer accounts to Hagersville at Simcoe Reformer Climate=Traditional The traditional climate for most of the Ontario tobacco belt has witnessed temperatures as low of in January and as high as in July. The winter of 1975 was the only unusually mild winter in the Ontario tobacco belt from 1877 to 1977. Even the traditional climate was considered to be inhospitable for some as the threat of desertification raged on from the early 20th century through the 1960s. Only by planting coniferous seedlings did the Ontario tobacco belt started to become a more friendly climate for tobacco production. Historically, the hottest temperatures in the Ontario tobacco belt were recorded on July 9, 1936 with Delhi registering temperatures up to .Environment Canada Canadian Climate Normals 1971-2000, accessed 18 March 2012 Modern An overnight frost in the early fall of 1999 damaged the unharvested crops of one hundred local tobacco farms; Norfolk County, Brant County, and Oxford County were affected in the disaster. An official reading of from the Delhi weather station recorded on July 7, 2012 has seen rising temperatures become a nearly unstoppable trend in the Ontario tobacco belt. When temperatures in the Ontario tobacco belt manage to reach a high of beyond , overall crop yields can be reduced as much as 1% per day; leading to potential crop failures months ahead of the proper harvest schedule. The number of days that the Ontario tobacco belt spends in temperatures in excess of are rising due to shifting weather patterns. Within the next 20 years, the industrial character of Norfolk, Brant and Oxford counties might have to change in order to adapt to the difficulties that future farmers will face concerning the well-being of their crops. However, with the summer temperatures of 2009 having been the coldest since 1816, the number of successful tobacco and food crops were fewer and more expensive because of fears of an early frost that never quite surfaced in 2009. The same effect was felt months after the severe December 22‚Äì28 blizzard with the subsequent blizzards on February 5‚Äì6, 2010 and on February 25‚Äì27 of that same year. There were two outbreaks of blizzards that occurred in this area between January 25 and February 2, 2011. After the start of 2012, the effects of the March 2012 North American heat wave has rendered virtually all snowfall in this area non-existent for the first time since the winter of 1994‚Äì95. The heat wave has also shattered all of the temperature records throughout the Ontario tobacco belt along with the rest of Southern Canada and parts of North America. This heat wave has extended itself into the summer months. During August 2012, only parts of South America and Northern Australia experienced temperatures that were cooler than usual.Mapping the Hot Summer at Earth Observatory (NASA) The heat wave officially ended in early November 2012 when local temperatures plunged below . Between December 2012 and April 2013, temperatures managed to return to normal seasonal levels for the Ontario tobacco belt along with most of Ontario. While May and June 2013 has seen temperatures that were slightly above normal, July 2013 has seen the return of extremely warm temperatures. Temperatures did not return to normal seasonal patterns until the middle of October 2013. However, the 2013‚Äì14 North American cold wave victimized Norfolk County from January to mid-April 2014 with unusually frequent cases of blizzards and snowstorms. An expected heat wave for the summer months of 2014 never emerged, meaning that temperatures in the Ontario tobacco belt have remained close to normal. The months of April and May 2015 saw temperatures that went directly from being unseasonably cold to unseasonably warm and back to unseasonably cold without any moderate weather in between. Cloudy days with high winds dominate the colder days while the unseasonably warm weather brought about threats of thunderstorms during the evening hours.Weather information for Simcoe, Ontario - April 2015Weather information for Simcoe, Ontario - May 2015 The temperatures from June to early September 2015 were seen as unusually warm and/or muggy. Thunderstorms and essential rainfall was deemed to be few and far in-between; with normal seasonal temperatures returning around late September of that year. The winter of 2016 experienced a lack of snowfall not seen since the winter of 2012. While the summer months of 2016 were as equally dry and hot as the summer of 2015, it was considerably more windy in 2016 than it was in 2015. The dry summer affected everything from trees to wildlife to the water levels for Lake Erie. Rain finally returned around October and November 2016 when the cold front needed to produce precipitation was finally created in order to fight the dominant warm front. Replacements for tobacco=Horticulture and animal farming Compared to 1998, tobacco farming is down by 60% and falling. It is possible that this tobacco industry will never recover and disappear forever. Calls to action by local residents to diversify the tobacco belt into other industries have been slow in being answered by Norfolk County council. Diversification into several different types of products could help the region absorb the ups and downs of a changing economy. The winter hardiness and soil requirements of lavender are equivalent to that of tobacco; meaning that an \\"Ontario horticultural belt\\" could see the economy revolve around lavender plants rather than tobacco plants. Tobacco farmers in this region have to deal with the same issues that haunt European tobacco farmers; farmers are told to grow different crops or go out of business. However, it is difficult to adjust to the changing supply and demand when most farmers are in heavy debt. The economic fallout from the Canadian economic recession also played in role in declining tobacco sales and farmers going deeper into debt. There are also good opportunities for wineries, peanut farms, poultry farms, and apiaries to fill the void that tobacco leaves behind economically. Most of these alternative crops are either grown or raised in Norfolk County; that is where the cash crush of a declining tobacco market is affecting the most people. Wind generators Wind generators have been used extensively in the Port Rowan area and in the southwestern part of Norfolk County (particularly near Lake Erie). Port Rowan has seen some wind generators installed in the northern end of their community near their active adult community; but were dismantled after the local people starting protesting. Most of them are seen near the communities of Clear Creek, Jacksonburg, Houghton Centre, and Hemlock. Port Dover (on the easternmost part of the Ontario tobacco belt) has been declared to be the site of future wind generators.The Simcoe Reformer - January 19, 2011 Norfolk County has banned the placement of new wind turbines after becoming a \\"willing host\\" for them back in 2003. One of the council members were worried about Norfolk County becoming \\"industrialized\\" and \\"unnatural.\\" Many leaders in Norfolk County envision the surrounding area as being an agricultural hub for Southern Ontario even by the middle of the 22nd century. By harvesting the local wind energy, it is assumed that electricity could be created closer to home without using fossil fuels and without polluting the atmosphere or the water that people need to live. However, one of the side effects has been the unexplained killing of the bald eagle species that is being rehabilitated in the area. Wind energy supporters have stated in the past that fossil fuel-based power plants affect the birds in a less humane manner. The cost of the wind generator devices (approximately $4 million CAD per unit) has caused the short-term price of hydroelectric energy to increase as it became more expensive to deliver the needed energy due to complications with the electricity grid. While rent has remained very cheap (approximately 870 Canadian dollars a month) by global standards in Brantford, the rising cost of electricity has made the typical restaurant meal in that city to be very expensive (with the cost of a meal between 10.50 Canadian dollars a person for lunch to 67.50 Canadian dollars a person for an elegant dinner); particularly when compared to other communities within Southern Ontario.Cost of living in Brantford, Canada at Numbeo The conventional Ontario electricity grid had become dependent on fossil fuels, transformers, and nuclear energy for decades before the wind turbines started appearing. However, these concerns are negated by wind energy proponents who say that the turbines could lead to electricity price reductions through lower natural gas prices (due to the reductions in natural gas demand).Wiser, R., Bolinger, M. (2007). ‚ÄúCan deployment of renewable energy put downward pressure on natural gas prices?‚Äù Energy Policy, Volume 35, pp.295-306. The use of fossil fuels is becoming less frequent amongst both rural and urban people as it becomes more expensive. Alternative fuels (like wind energy from the nearby Erie Shores Wind Farm and all solar energy projects done in this area in the future) will eventually relegate the use of fossil fuels to the Middle East and to developing countries. These alternatives will be cheaper and cleaner than the energy forms that rely on fossil fuels. The increasingly frequent use of alternative clean fuels (such as wind, and solar) will help reduce pollution from fossil fuel use, and mitigate global warming.

The area enclosed by the Diocese of Niagara includes much of the Golden Horseshoe, and moves north to include Erin and Orangeville as far as Shelburne. Moving sharply south the line includes Mount Forest and widens, south-westerly to include Elora and Guelph. Skirting Brantford and the Territory of the Six Nations Confederacy, the line then travels, again, south-westerly to Nanticoke and Lake Erie to include the entire Niagara Peninsula. Major urban centres within its borders are St. Catharines, Hamilton, Guelph, Oakville, Burlington, and Orangeville. The current Bishop of Niagara is The Right Reverend Susan Bell who succeeded The Right Reverend Michael Bird as Diocesan Bishop on June 1, 2018. She was elected Bishop by the Synod of the Diocese of Niagara in March 2018, and consecrated as a bishop in May of that year. There are just over 90 parishes within the diocese served by approximately 120 licensed parish priests, with a number of honorary clergy, vocational deacons and licensed lay people. The diocese is divided into five regional deaneries: Brock, Lincoln, Hamilton- Haldimand, Greater Wellington and Trafalgar. Each deanery is overseen by a Regional Archdeacon and Regional Dean. In June 2016, the diocese decided to allow legal same-gender marriages. Early history The first Anglican presence in what would become the Diocese of Niagara begin with St Mark‚Äôs Church in Newark (now Niagara-on-the-Lake), the former capital of Upper Canada. The parish was founded in 1790 as Loyalist immigrants arrived from the former American colonies, in what would become the province of Ontario. At this time the area was part of the Diocese of Nova Scotia, and subsequently became part of the Diocese of Quebec, then of the Diocese of Toronto. The diocese was formed by an act of the Legislative Assembly of Upper Canada; 39 Vic Chapter 107 in 1875. Royal assent was given in 1876. The first bishop was Thomas Brock Fuller, Archdeacon of Niagara and godson of Sir Isaac Brock, the hero of the Battle of Queenston Heights.

'Breed III was planned and started in 1995 but Starlin couldn't get a publisher interested in it after Malibu Comics went under.Newsarama's Jim Starlin Interview 1, Newsarama, July 15, 2006 In May 2011, the first issue of Breed III was released through Image Comics. Plot='Breed In 1949, a small town in Texas was wiped out by a mysterious force, leaving behind only skeletons and blood. One girl was found comatose and pregnant. The captain leading the force adopted the boy and raised him as his own. During the Vietnam War, the now grown boy, Raymond Stone, was ambushed by enemy forces and survived by transforming, which he later forgot. After being discharged and an attempt at living in New York City, Raymond discovers another world called \\"Elsewhere\\". There he meets a mysterious woman named Rachel, who reveals that both of them are \\"'Breeds\\": half-breeds of demon and human. Most are raised by the demons to be their minions, although they were not. She then teaches him about how demons invade Earth to hunt and find women to breed with. They are attacked by a large force of 'breeds. Rachel is killed, but Ray triumphs over them. 'Breed II Having been left alone since the death of his 'breed friend and ally Rachel at the conclusion of the first series, Raymond Stoner leaves Elsewhere and tries to find inner peace in a Nepalese Sanctuary in an attempt to banish his (literal) personal demons. Having no success, he leaves the Temple and hones his martial skills fighting in various South American wars, with and against varied rebels and gangsters, but cannot shake off the CIA and the Demons, both of whom are hunting him. He learns more about the nature of these demons and their aims, and realises he must choose whether to side with humanity in the confrontation which is about to come. Rejecting an offer to join the demons, he battles with the highest level demon he has yet encountered - with the aid of Rachel's spirit - yet his victory comes at a heavy price when the fountain which provides him with his rejuvenating water is destroyed in the battle. 'Breed III Dreadstar and Oedi appear on the last page of 'Breed III #5 and in issue #6 along with other of Starlin's creations, such as Wyrd and Kid Kosmos as part of the \\"Elsewhere Alliance\\". #7 concludes the storyline.

The school's founder and first commander was Colonel Lee Charles Black. It is located on the campus of the United States Air Force Academy near the Community Center. The Prep School's mission is to prepare, motivate, and evaluate for admission to and success at the Air Force Academy. Students at the prep school are referred to as \\"cadet candidates\\" or more informally as \\"preppies.\\" The prep school has a staff of 57 people and offers a 10-month program of intense academic preparation, military training, and athletic conditioning, designed to develop in cadet candidates the skills and character necessary to be successful at the Academy. The academic curriculum is focused on mathematics, English, and sciences. Eligibility requirements Prospective cadet candidates must: * Be at least 17 and not have passed their 22nd birthday by July 1 of the year they enter the Prep School. * Be eligible to be a U.S. citizen. * Be unmarried and have no dependents. * Meet the medical standards for a commission in the United States Air Force. Admission and transition to USAFA Like admission to the Academy, admission to the Prep School is competitive, with selections made by the Academy director of admissions. If a civilian or Airman, either Active Duty or Reserve, applies for but does not receive a direct appointment to the Air Force Academy, they will automatically be considered for the Prep School. Air Force enlisted personnel may apply directly to the Prep School via Air Force Form 1786, submitted through the unit commander and MPF. AFI 36-2021 should be consulted for details. Enlisted members from the Army, Navy and Marine Corps are not eligible for nomination but can be considered as civilians.USAFA Admissions and Facts Approximately 240 cadet candidates enter the Prep School each summer. Civilian selectees are placed on active duty in the Air Force Reserves while attending the Prep School. Successful completion of the Prep School program improves one's chance for an appointment to the Academy but does not guarantee it. If not selected, prior enlisted are assigned to other duties, usually their previous AFSC, while previous civilian cadet candidates are discharged from the Reserves with no further obligation to the Air Force. Between 75 and 80 percent of all entering students earn an appointment to the Academy. To qualify for an appointment, students must successfully complete the Prep School programs in academics and military training, pass the Cadet Physical Fitness Test, exhibit strong ethical character, receive a recommendation from a Congressman or the Prep School commander, and be approved by the Academy board. Organization Like the main Academy, the Prep School is set up as a military unit. Services, engineering, communications, and security are provided by the 10th Air Base Wing. All cadet candidates are in the Group with their own cadet candidate group commander. They are then divided into three squadrons, Alpha, Bravo and Charlie, each having their own Air Officer Commanding (AOC) and an Academy Military Training (AMT) enlisted member. AOCs are generally Majors and/or Captains and are in charge of cadet candidates' training and discipline. The AMT is a noncommissioned officer who supports the AOC and cadet candidates as well as mentoring over the 10-month program.\\"Military Training ,\\"August 2010 Each squadron also has a cadet candidate squadron commander. Squadrons are further subdivided into three flights consisting of approximately 25 cadet candidates, each with their own cadet candidate commander. Academics The academic program is 10 months long and is divided into four quarters. It is highly structured, with all cadet candidates taking the same classes for the first quarter. Each quarter, cadet candidates take classes in math (ranging from advanced algebra to calculus, and including applications in science and engineering), chemistry, physics, and English, as well as a one-time course in basic study skills and advanced reading skills.\\"School Academic page ,\\"August 2010 As at the Academy, professors are a mix of civilians and Air Force officers. During the last quarter, qualified students can take Calculus 141 at the Academy instead of taking the Prep School trigonometry and calculus courses. Students will receive Academy credit for the class if they pass the placement exam.\\"Preparatory School Website, ,\\"August 2010 Military training Upon arriving at the Prep School, cadet candidates go through an 18-day course in Basic Military Training (BMT). Training focuses on teaching basic military history, drill and ceremonies, military customs and courtesies, proper uniform wear, and physical fitness. Throughout the year, military training time is reserved every weekday afternoon following academics, usually lasting about an hour. It is used at the discretion of the Prep School commander, the squadron commanders, or the cadet candidate flight commanders. Activities range from guest speakers, drill or parade practice, to room inspections. At the end of the school year, cadet candidates go through a three-day high intensity field training exercise (FTX). FTX focuses on teamwork and on utilizing knowledge and leadership experience gained over the previous 10 months. Athletics Just like cadets at the Academy, all Prep School cadet candidates are required to participate in athletics. The Prep School has a number of varsity sports, including football, men's and women's soccer, and men's and women's basketball. Teams compete against a number of different colleges throughout the state and region.\\"School Athletics Page ,\\"August 2010 There are also a variety of intramural sports available. Not all athletic time must be spent on organized sports; it may also include weight lifting, running, or another physical activity of the cadet candidates' choosing. The football team usually plays community colleges from the Kansas Jayhawk Community College Conference (KJCCC). Graduates Many Prep School graduates have gone on to distinguish themselves in military and academic areas at the Academy. Nine Prep School graduates have held the Cadet Wing's top leadership position as cadet wing commander, and Prep School graduates have earned prestigious awards, including the Rhodes Scholarship, Fulbright Scholarship, Order of the Daedalians Scholarship, and the Guggenheim Fellowship. A number of Prep School graduates have gone on to become general officers, Air Force Cross and Silver Star recipients, and astronauts. Other honors earned by Prep School graduates include a White House fellowship, becoming a Thunderbirds pilot and a winner of the coveted Jabara Award.\\"School Alumni page ,\\"August 2010 ReferencesExternal links * USAF Air Force Academy Preparatory School website Preparatory School Category:Military academies of the United States Category:Military education and training in the United States Category:Educational institutions established in 1961 Category:1961 establishments in Colorado ","title":"United States Air Force Academy Preparatory School"},{"id":"3550739","text":"Icy Demons is an experimental music project started by Bablicon's Griffin Rodriguez (credited as Blue Hawaii) and Man Man / Need New Body's Christopher Powell (Pow Pow).

History The first airport on the Sea of Japan coast of Japan was opened on an island in the Shinano River in 1929. This airport was moved to what was then the village of Matsugazakahama in 1930, and was renamed Niigata Airport. It was requisitioned for use by the Imperial Japanese Army Air Force in 1941, and came under the control of the USAAF after the end of World War II. It was returned to Japanese civilian control on March 31, 1958, on which date commercial flight operations were resumed. International services were started in 1973, with scheduled service to Khabarovsk and Niigata Airport became historically an important gateway for traffic to and from Russia, which among other purposes were used to export Niigata-area agricultural products to Russia; however, flights were reduced from winter 2010 as more slots became available for Russia service at Narita International Airport near Tokyo. The airport saw several major service expansions in the spring of 2012, when China Eastern Airlines, Fuji Dream Airlines and All Nippon Airways announced service to Shanghai, Nagoya and Narita respectively. Airlines and destinations The following destinations are served from Niigata: Ground transportation Scheduled \\"limousine bus\\" service is provided to and from Niigata Station every 20 minutes and heavily subsidized by Niigata Prefecture. Niigata Airport currently has no direct rail access, although regional authorities have conducted studies aimed at potentially extending the Joetsu Shinkansen high- speed rail line or other nearby ordinary rail lines to the airport.

The game itself stars various Konami created characters as well as Mikey (from The Goonies) and King Kong, who appeared in two Konami-produced, movie-based games. Gameplay The player starts the game as Konami Man and can switch between Konami Man and Konami Lady. If two players are gaming, then one will play as Konami Man and the other as Konami Lady. Both players are not able to switch characters until they rescue at least one character from one of the six levels. The player must play through six different selectable levels that take place in different Konami games. Subsequently the player uses a key to save that game's star character, who then becomes playable. Each character has different abilities to begin with as well as ones they can eventually gain. The player ventures through these first six levels in a sort of nonlinear fashion with gameplay very similar to the original Castlevania games. After these stages are completed, the player plays through a scrolling space shooter stage and then a linear final stage. The player can also regularly visit the lab of Dr. Cinnamon (from the TwinBee series), who gives the player the game's character profiles and refills energy when needed. Through his lab, the player can also talk to Saimon, Dr. Cinnamon's brother, who can resurrect any defeated characters at the cost of 100 bullets per character during the game. Playable characters *Konami Man: The game's main protagonist who only made cameos in Konami games before this game. *Konami Lady: A female android created by Dr. Cinnamon to fight with Konami Man. *Goemon: This ninja from the Ganbare Goemon series is found in the Medieval Japan level. *Simon Belmont III: The descendant of the Vampire Killer from the Castlevania series is found in the Castle level. *Getsu F≈´ma: He is from the Famicom game released only in Japan, Getsu F≈´ma Den. He is found in the Underworld (or Hell) level. *Michael \\"Mikey\\" Walsh: The lead character in The Goonies film and the Famicom games, The Goonies (sold in retail only in Japan) and The Goonies II; he is found in the Cave level. *Moai Alexandria: Numerous Moai are usually enemies in the Gradius series and a playable character in Moai-kun; he is found in the Easter Island Temple. *Kong: From the Japan-only Famicom game King Kong 2: Ikari no Megaton Punch which was based on the film King Kong Lives (King Kong 2 in Japan). He is found in the City level. *Upa: The baby protagonist from Bio Miracle Bokutte Upa who only appears in the mobile phone version as a replacement for Mikey. He is found in the Candy level. *Penta: The main protagonist from Antarctic Adventure and a father of Pentarou who only appears in the mobile phone version as a replacement for King Kong. He is found in the Antarctic level. *Vic Viper: The spaceship from the Gradius series. The player can only play this ship in the shooter stage. *TwinBee: From the TwinBee series. Like the Vic Viper, the player can only play this ship in the shooter stage. Other characters *Dr. Cinnamon: Scientist from the TwinBee series, helps the characters throughout the game. *Saimon: Dr. Cinnamon's brother who brings defeated characters back to life. *Pentarou: Penguin from the Parodius series, (the son of Penta, who originally appeared in Antarctic Adventure), transports the player to one of the six main levels. *Hanako: Penguin from the Parodius series, replacing Pentarou (in the mobile phone version). Music The music during gameplay depends on which character the player is currently playing as. Each character has their own music, which serves as their theme song. Besides Konami Man, Konami Girl and Moai, all the other characters use music from the Konami games they starred in. The different boss music in the game is also taken from Konami games in which the level is based. Mobile phone version The mobile phone version of Wai Wai World replaces Mikey and King Kong with Upa (from Bio Miracle Bokutte Upa) and a giant Penta (the protagonist from Antarctic Adventure, and father of Pentarou), with their respective stages being a Candy stage and an Antarctic stage. These two characters from the original Famicom version had been omitted due to licensing issues.

It is the format by which digital cable channels are encoded and transmitted via cable television providers. QAM is used in a variety of communications systems such as Dial-up modems and WiFi. In cable systems, a QAM tuner is linked to the cable in a manner that is equivalent to an ATSC tuner which is required to receive over-the-air (OTA) digital channels broadcast by local television stations when attached to an antenna. Most new HDTV digital televisions support both of these standards. QAM uses the same 6 MHz bandwidth as ATSC, using a standard known as ITU-T Recommendation J.83 Annex B (\\"J.83b\\").  Technical details  QAM is a modulation format and does not specify the format of the digital data being carried. However, when used in the context of US digital cable television, the format of the data transmitted using this modulation is based on ITU-T J.83 Annex B (\\"J.83b\\"). This is in contrast to DVB-C which is also based on QAM modulation, but uses a DVB-based data format which is incompatible with North American receivers. QAM is a parallel form of modulation that transmits two independent signals at a symbol rate that is near, but less than, the bandwidth of 6 MHz. VSB modulation, on the other hand, is a serial form of modulation that transmits one independent signal at a symbol rate that is near, but less than, twice the bandwidth of 6 MHz. The two can be related by the fact that a VSB signal can be shown to be a form of offset QAM modulation where one of the two independent signals is delayed by 1/2 a symbol duration. The 8-VSB modulation in the ATSC system corresponds with the 64-QAM modulation of J.83b. In a 6 MHz channel, the data rate is at most 36 Mbit/s (for 64-QAM or 8-VSB); the 8-VSB ATSC achieves a data rate of 19.3926 Mbit/s while the 64-QAM J.83b achieves a data rate of 26.970 Mbit/s. While both systems use concatenated trellis/RS coding, the differences in symbol rate and FEC redundancy account for the differences in rate. In addition, J.83b defines a popular 256-QAM mode that achieves a data rate of 38.8 Mbit/s. Many cable providers offer few or no details about unencrypted QAM channels. It is also common for cable providers to falsely insist that a set-top box from the cable company is required to watch all digital cable channels, including unencrypted channels, even though QAM channels may be distributed via their system. QAM channels may move without notification and some channels may have strange numbering schemes when received on a non- proprietary set-top box.  QAM tuners  In North American digital video, a QAM tuner is a device present in some digital televisions and similar devices which enables direct reception of digital cable channels without the use of a set-top box.Terms & Definitions, Sceptre.com An integrated QAM tuner allows the free reception of unscrambled digital programming sent \\"in the clear\\" by cable providers, usually local broadcast stations, cable radio channels, or in the case of providers which have transitioned to do so, Public-access television cable TV channels. Which channels are scrambled varies greatly from location to location and can change over time; the majority of digital channels are scrambled because the providers consider them to be extra-cost options and not part of the \\"basic cable\\" package.Video Noise Does Your Next Video Display Need to Have a QAM Tuner?, February 2004 The FCC mandates that all new TVs sold in the US must include an ATSC tuner, but there are no requirements for QAM tuning functionality. and However, as of 2017, there is a trend towards large screen flat panel displays that don't include any kind of tuner, often referred to as \\"Tuner-Free TVs\\" or ‚ÄúTunerless Displays.‚ÄùTuner Free, Vizio.comCostco Tuner Free, costco.com ClearQAM ClearQAM (unencrypted) lets cable subscribers avoid industry-provided set-top boxes (necessary for decoding encrypted basic cable signals).https://ecfsapi.fcc.gov/file/7021860105.pdf Cable operators with all- digital systems may encrypt their services.

Personal life  Bolton was born in Frankford, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, the oldest of two brothers. His father ran the furniture store on Main Street, and both he and his brother attended public school in Frankford and went on to college. Bolton went to Bucknell University in Lewisburg, Pennsylvania, and took the Classical Course, receiving a B.A. degree in 1908. From there he went to Harvard University, receiving his A.M. degree in 1910 and his Ph.D. in organic chemistry in 1913. His thesis advisor was Charles Loring Jackson, and his dissertation concerned the chemistry of periodoquinones. Several other prominent contemporaries of Bolton's at Harvard Graduate School were Roger Adams, Farrington Daniels, Frank C. Whitmore, James B. Sumner and James Bryant Conant. Adams was particularly influential through Bolton's career. They shared diverse interests, yet a drive for accomplishment in organic chemistry. In later years Adams had significant influence on Bolton's ideas about industrial support of chemical research and university students. In 1913 Bolton won the Sheldon Fellowship, which he used to work at the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute outside of Berlin, Germany, for two years with Professor Richard Willst√§tter. Here he worked on anthocyanins, a major program for Willst√§tter, and published three papers on isolation and structures of anthocyanin pigments. Willst√§tter, apparently impressed by Bolton's ability but frustrated by his tendency to make arithmetic mistakes, commented \\"You must have been a bank teller.\\" To his surprise Bolton replied that he had been a bank teller, this was how he paid his way through college. Bolton was very impressed by Willst√§tter's careful, logical approach to tackling a research problem. He felt that this was the result of good training in the German university system. He also observed the relationship between German universities and industry, for which there was no counterpart in the United States. Another aspect of German research that impressed Bolton was the effort to create artificial rubber. This work was significant to German industry, and later to the German war effort in World War II because Germany did not have ready access to sources of natural rubber. Also, the approach being used by the Germans undoubtedly lead to the development of neoprene rubber years later at DuPont Labs. Bolton married Margarite L. Duncan in 1916 and they had three children, a daughter and two sons. He retired from DuPont after a distinguished career in 1951, but continued to follow the scientific literature. He died July 30, 1968, at the age of eighty-two.  World War I and DuPont  From the 1870s up to the onset of World War I (1914), the organic chemical industry of Germany was a world-leading force in research, development, production, and export; most organic compounds used in America, such as textile dyes and some medicines, were imported from Germany. The disruption of this trade by the war presented an industrial problem at first but simultaneously offered an opportunity for American chemical companies to meet a wartime need and to become better established in this field. When Bolton returned from Germany in 1915 he discovered American organic chemists struggling to develop methods for manufacturing these compounds. The Dupont Company needed chemists, and hired Bolton in 1915. Bolton joined the Chemical Department at the Experimental Station outside Wilmington, Delaware, where most of DuPont's research was conducted. Being groomed for advancement, he started working on the synthesis of glycerol. By 1916 Bolton was selected to lead the Dye Group that was newly formed to research the synthesis of dyes. The United States had little knowledge of dye manufacture at this time, so later in 1916 Bolton traveled to England to learn about British technology in this area, and upon return he was assigned to the Wilmington Office to be advisor on dyes and intermediates. In 1918 he transferred to the Dyestuffs Department and was assistant general manager of the Lodi Works where silk colorants were made. In 1919 he returned to the Chemical Department as manager of the Organic Division. During this time he learned much about developing manufacturing processes and developed two principles; that high priority must be given to cost and time effectiveness of research, and that a manufacturing process should be perfected using pure materials, then later adapted to use materials available to the plant. Bolton's friend from Harvard, Roger Adams shared much of Bolton's philosophy in his work at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. In 1922 DuPont reorganized its research by dividing the entire research enterprise into four parts, each assigned to one of its four production areas. Bolton was made director of research for the Dyestuffs Department where his ability in this capacity was quickly realized. Dye manufacture requires the synthesis of a large number of intermediate compounds, and Bolton realized these could be used in many activities outside the Dyestuffs Department. By 1923 his lab was working on accelerators for manufacture of synthetic rubber and soon after extended the research to include antioxidants for gasoline and rubber, floatation agents, insecticides, seed disinfectants, and large scale manufacture of tetraethyllead. The Stevenson Act and synthetic rubber In the early 1920s the supply and demand of natural rubber became a concern in international trade.. After a scramble for rubber during World War I, there was a glut when the war ended, depressing prices. In November 1922 England enacted the Stevenson Act that was intended to protect rubber producers by restricting production and keeping prices from being ruinously low. But this caused a great deal of concern in the United States because an expanding supply of rubber was needed to support the growing number of automobiles in use. Synthetic rubber as a practical, durable, affordable commodity was a problem that had resisted chemists' efforts for many decades. Bolton saw this as an opportune time to start DuPont research on synthetic rubber. However, this research did not begin in earnest until 1925, when the high price of rubber was attracting considerable attention and other scientists such as Thomas Edison were also taking an interest in the problem. Bolton's group's work on synthetic rubber began with the polymerization of butadiene obtained from the hydrogenation of diacetylene, and at first not much progress was made. At the end of 1925 Bolton met chemist Julius Arthur Nieuwland from the University of Notre Dame who had discovered a way to polymerize acetylene using a cuprous oxide catalyst. Unfortunately the resulting polymer would explode when struck, but Bolton believed the process could be modified to produce a stable compound that would replace butadiene in the reaction. Bolton brought Nieuwland into the project as a consultant to DuPont, and Nieuwland taught the DuPont chemists how to use his catalyst. A continuous-flow reactor was developed that would produce a good yield of the stable polymer Bolton was seeking. While the polymer was highly chemical resistant, it degraded with exposure to light. In 1927 DuPont's Chemical Director C.M.A. Stine persuaded the company to take on a fundamental research project for synthetic rubber and received $250,000 in funding for this purpose. In 1928 Wallace Carothers, an instructor at Harvard University, was hired to lead the newly formed group. Bolton operated within this group and by 1929 had discovered that his polymer could be readily converted into 2-chlorobutadiene (chloroprene) with a copper catalyzed addition of hydrogen chloride. This material was both chemical and light resistant, with the properties of a synthetic rubber. The new material was announced at the Rubber Division of the American Chemical Society on November 2, 1931, and was named with the trademark Duprene (today the generic name is neoprene). By this time the Stevenson Act had been repealed and the Great Depression had begun. Rubber prices were low and the new material cost twenty times what natural rubber cost. Therefore, DuPont's first neoprene never became a substitute for natural rubber, but it did find commercial use in applications where a rubber compound was needed that was more resistant to oils and outdoor degradation. It thus made an important economic contribution albeit in a different way from its original conception: instead of replacing natural rubber supplies as envisioned, it augmented them and extended the applications of rubber (in both natural and artificial forms). Today, applications of neoprene include: the Rigid-hulled inflatable boat; diving suits, and diveskins; gloves, balaclavas, sleepsacks, Knee high boots, wetsocks and other protective clothing; radar absorbent material; plumbing fixtures; gaskets, hoses, seals and belts; foam (mousepad, wetsuit); orthopedic braces; and solid fuel rocket propellant (see AGM-114 Hellfire). Synthetic fibers When Wallace Carothers arrived at DuPont in 1928 one of the tasks his group took on was the development of new synthetic fibers for textiles. At that time a number of natural polymers such as latex and cellulose were in common use, rayon as a semisynthetic from nitrated cellulose had recently been improved and begun upending the textile industries, and some fully synthetic polymers such as bakelite were also known and being used for certain applications, but the existing fully synthetic polymers could not be drawn into fibers and spun into thread, so great opportunity existed to manufacture thread and yarn from synthetic polymers to join or replace the existing fibers in the market (natural fibers such as cotton, wool, linen, and silk and artificial fiber in the various recently emerged types of rayon). The approach taken by Carothers' group was to adapt known syntheses that produced short-chain polymers to produce long-chain molecules. The first break was finding that bifunctional esterification could produce long molecule chains which today are known as aliphatic polyesters, but at that time were called superpolymers. Then there was the key observation by Julian W. Hill in April, 1930 in which it was seen that the superpolymers could be drawn in the molten state to form thin, transparent fibers that were much stronger than the polymers were in the undrawn state. However, the superpolymers the group was able to synthesize either had too low a boiling point and insufficient chemical resistivity or had too high a melting point to be spun. By late 1932 the entire project was discontinued. Bolton, now the Chemistry department director, refused to give up. Most likely he was aware of the re-discovery of polyethylene by Eric Fawcett and Reginald Gibson at Imperial Chemical Industries in 1933. In early 1934 Bolton urged Carothers to continue the research, and Carothers decided to take another look at polyamides. Carothers surmised that the problem with the polyamides that had been made from Œµ-aminocaproic acid was due to cyclization reactions, so he replaced Œµ-aminocaproic acid with 9-aminononoic acid which would not cyclize. This produced results that were encouraging, so Carother's group prepared polyamides from a variety of compounds including amino acids, dibase acids and diamines. The leading candidate for development became 5/10 polyamide made from pentamethylenediamine and sebic acid. It had the right melting point, the desired properties in fiber form and could be spun without gel formation. Bolton at this point made a bold and characteristically visionary decision. He decided that practical synthetic fibers could not be made from castor oil, the only practical source of sebacic acid. To use an agricultural product as a primary feedstock would mean the new synthetic material would have very similar mass production problems as existing natural fibers had. Instead he wanted to use benzene as the feedstock for making both adipic acid and hexamethylenediamine to make a 6/6 polyamide. This polymer was first made early in 1935, and thanks to concurrent development of polyamine spinning technologies, could be spun into fibers. The fibers had high strength and elasticity, were insensitive to common solvents and melted at 263 ¬∞C, well above ironing temperatures. Bolton insisted that every aspect of the synthesis of this polymer be thoroughly worked out in a pilot plant at the Experimental Station. He insisted that the development begin with pure materials then be adapted to use materials available to a plant in bulk. On October 27, 1938 DuPont announced it would build a plant at Seaford, Delaware to make nylon, the world's first fully synthetic fiber. The Seaford plant was essentially a scaled-up version of the pilot plant, and had remarkably trouble-free startup.  Publications  *E.K.

It aired on SBS from July 28 to September 23, 2004 on Wednesdays and Thursdays at 21:55 for 16 episodes. Plot The story begins with a car accident involving a man named Jung Joon-seok and it flashes back some scenes of him chasing a young adorable girl, his daughter Jung Hae-won, around the hanging blankets. He was living with his wife, Park Young-ran, Hae-won's mother. Joon-seok's father, Jung Geun-woo paid off Young-ran to stop looking for Joon-seok and lied that Joon-seok doesn't want to see them. Young-ran tried to catch up to Geun-woo to return the money but failed resulting to her sudden faint because of her illness. The two kitchen helpers, Im Cheong-ok and Song Kyung-hwa, run to rescue Young-ran and while Cheong-ok was pulling Young-ran inside, Kyung-hwa happen to see the envelope which was given by Geun-woo and was shocked to see the amount of money inside. One night, Cheong-ok was being pursued by some loan sharks and threatened her that they will kill her in front of her sons. She didn't have a choice but to steal the money from Young-ran but was caught red-handed. Young-ran beg her to return because she will return it but due to this, her illness become worst resulting to death. The scene was witnessed by Kyung-Hwa. Kyung-Hwa made Cheong-ok her accomplice to divide the money and get rid of Hae-won. Cheong-ok refused but Kyung-Hwa threatened her about her killing Hae-won's mother. Kyung-Hwa begs Cheong-ok to do it since it will be for their sons and daughters who are in need to be raise well. Choi Soo-ji, Kyung-Hwa's daughter, overheard about their plan. Soon, Cheong-ok left Hae- won, while carrying a bear given by her father, to a train travelling to Seoul and watches her crying and calling her name. Back to Young-ran's home, Kyung- hwa was busy collecting Young-ran's jewelries. She didn't bother to notice that Soo-ji hid Hae-won's family picture to herself. 15 years later, the now 19-year-old Hae-won, Han Yoo-min lives alone with her adoptive brother, Han Kang-pyo. She has no memory of her childhood and only remembers herself running around the hanging blankets. One day, she meets Kang Min-jae, a doctor who treats her brother, and instantly falls in love. It suddenly turns out that Min-jae is Cheong-ok's eldest son. At the same hospital, Geun-woo was rushed inside and gave words to Joon-seok, who lost his memories after the car accident, to find her daughter 'Hae-won'. Min-jae wanted to dedicate the wife position to Seo-yeon, the girl who left him without a word a year ago. But because of her mother who keeps pushing him to marry a tycoon's daughter, Min- jae needs Yoo-min help to pretend his fianc√©e until Seo-yeon return. Yoo-min, who lied to being a 22-year-old woman, decided to tell Min-jae her true age. Min-jae somehows accept her and they renew the contract of if Min-jae will fall in love to Yoo-min before Seo-yeon returns, their engagement will turn to real. Soon, Yoo-min and Kang-pyo move into Min-jae's house as well as Soo-ji and Kyung-hwa. Soo-ji started to become suspicious of Yoo-min's identity after seeing her teddy bear, which is that she also has the same that is also given by Yoo-min's biological father. Yoo-min accidentally enters Min-jae's younger brother, Kang Seung-jae's school which is also a school where Soo-ji and Hye- rim is studying. Due to this, Yoo-min and Kang-pyo decided to build up another lie to Soo-ji and Hye-rim.

Laid down at the AG Vulcan shipyard in Stettin in 1883, the ship was launched in December 1884 and commissioned into the Navy in April 1886. Oldenburg was intended to have been a fifth member of the of sortie corvettes, but budgetary limitations and dissatisfaction with the Sachsen class prompted a redesign that bore little resemblance to the earlier vessels. Oldenburg mounted her main battery of eight guns amidships, six in a central casemate on the main deck and two directly above them on the broadside. She was the first German capital ship constructed entirely from German-made steel. Oldenburg did not see significant service with the German Navy. She participated in fleet training maneuvers in the late-1880s and early 1890s, but she spent the majority of the 1890s in reserve. Her only major deployment came in 1897‚Äì1898 when she joined an international naval demonstration to protest the Greek annexation of Crete. In 1900, she was withdrawn from active duty and used as a harbor defense ship. From 1912 to 1919, she was used by the High Seas Fleet as a target ship; she was sold for scrapping in 1919 and broken up that year.  Design  Illustration of the Sachsen-class, of which Oldenburg was originally to have been a member Following the Franco-Prussian War of 1870‚Äì1871, General Albrecht von Stosch became the Chief of the Imperial Admiralty; he immediately set about drafting a new fleet plan, based on the previous program that had been approved in 1867. Stosch saw the role of the navy as primarily defensive; a fleet of ironclad warships would be kept in German waters to defend the coast against the type of blockade the Danish Navy had imposed during the Second Schleswig War and the French Navy had put into place during the Franco- Prussian conflict. Stosch's fleet plan, finalized in 1873, called for a total of eight ocean-going ironclads and six smaller, armored corvettes. The ocean- going component had been completed with the , and of the six corvettes, five had been built: and the four s. The last corvette was originally intended to be a fifth Sachsen-type vessel, but dissatisfaction with the design led many senior officers to push for a revised version. The new design was prepared between 1879 and 1881, but budgetary constraints imposed in the aftermath of the accidental sinking of the ironclad limited the ability of the design staff to produce an effective improvement on the Sachsens. On the available budget, the new ship's displacement would have to be reduced by some compared to the Sachsens. The limited displacement forced a reversion to the casemate ship arrangement, as well as a reduction in the caliber of guns from to . To somewhat offset the reduction in offensive power, these guns were of a new, longer 30-caliber type that had a higher muzzle velocity than the shorter 22-caliber guns carried by the Sachsen class. Assessment of the design is mixed; the ship was an anachronism, being the last casemate ship to be laid down by any navy (though the Ottoman ironclad was completed later). The naval historian Erich Gr√∂ner states that Oldenburg was an \\"experimental design, of no real value in combat.\\" Conway's All the World's Fighting Ships concurs, stating that Oldenburg was \\"considered to be of little fighting value by the time she was completed.\\" The historian Aidan Dodson criticized the ship as being \\"a poor investment [that] failed to make her designed speed by and had a form that lead to a rapid drop-off of speed in head seas.\\" The 1889 edition of the Brassey's Naval Annual reported a contradictory opinion, however, stating that \\"The majority of German naval critics are dissatisfied to a greater or less extent with all of these vessels, the , , , and Oldenburg excepted.\\"  General characteristics  Line-drawing of Oldenburg Oldenburg was long at the waterline and long overall. She had a beam of and a draft of forward and aft. As designed, the vessel displaced . When the ship was fully loaded, she displaced . Her hull was constructed with transverse and longitudinal steel frames; iron was used for the stem and stern. The hull was divided into twelve watertight compartments and incorporated a double bottom that ran for 60 percent of the length of its length. Oldenburg was the first German capital ship built entirely from German-made steel. The German navy regarded Oldenburg as an adequate sea boat, though she suffered from significant pitching. As a result of her tendency to pitch severely, a ballast was permanently installed in the bow. She also lost a great deal of speed in heavy seas; at conditions above Beaufort sea state 6, this could be up to a 25 percent loss of speed. The ship could not operate under severe weather conditions. Her transverse metacentric height was . Her standard complement consisted of 34 officers and 355 enlisted men, though her crew was later reorganized to 32 officers and 40 enlisted sailors. She carried a number of smaller boats, including one picket boat, one launch, two pinnaces, two cutters, two yawls, and one dinghy.  Machinery  Painting of Oldenburg in 1902 Oldenburg was powered by two horizontal 4-cylinder double-expansion steam engines in separate engine roomes; the two engines each drove a three-bladed screw propeller that was in diameter. Steam was provided to the engines by eight transverse, cylindrical fire-tube boilers, divided into two boiler rooms. Each boiler was equipped with three fireboxes, for a total of 24, which operated at up to using forced draft. The engines were designed to operate at for a top speed of . On speed trials, her engines slightly exceeded the designed horsepower, at , though Oldenburg made only . The ship was designed to store of coal normally, though she could accommodate up to under wartime conditions. An additional of coal could be stored on her deck for longer voyages. At a cruising speed of , Oldenburg could steam for . Increasing her speed by one knot reduced her range to , and at , she could cruise for only . Steering was controlled by a single rudder. She was equipped with three electric generators with a total output of 29 kilowatts at 65 volts.  Armament and armor  Oldenburg carried eight L/30 hooped guns in an unusual configuration: six guns on the main deck, one on each broadside, four in embrasures at each corner of the central battery to give a measure of end-on fire, and two on the upper deck firing broadside. These guns were supplied with 494 rounds of ammunition, and could depress to ‚àí5¬∞ and elevate to 8¬∞. This enabled a maximum range of . Her secondary battery consisted of four L/22 guns in single mounts. For close-range defense against torpedo boats, she carried a pair of L/24 guns in single mounts. Later in her career, she received another six of these guns to strengthen her defensive capabilities. Four torpedo tubes rounded out her armament. One was mounted in the bow, submerged, two were placed on the broadside above water, and the fourth was located in the stern, also above water. She carried ten torpedoes. Oldenburgs armor consisted of compound steel backed with teak; the steel was fabricated by the Dillinger Works. The main armored belt was composed of two strakes; the steel upper strake was thick amidships, where it protected the ship's vitals. The belt was reduced on either end of the central portion to . The lower strake was thick in the central section and on either end. The entire belt was backed with 250 mm of teak amidships and 300 mm of teak on either end. The sides of the armored casemates for the main battery were thick. The ship's deck was thick. Her forward conning tower had thick sides and a thick roof. The rear conning tower was given only splinter protection, with thick sides and a thick roof.  Service history  Carl Hochhaus: Construction of the Oldenburg at the Vulcan Shipyard, 1886, Deutsches Historisches Museum SMS Oldenburg in port Oldenburg was laid down in 1883 at the AG Vulcan shipyard in Stettin, under yard number 132. She was launched on 20 December 1884, after which fitting-out work commenced. She was completed by April 1886 and commissioned into the German Navy on 8 April. She immediately joined I Division of the fleet, alongside , , and , for the annual fleet maneuvers. Bayern and W√ºrttemberg suffered from engine troubles throughout the exercises, but Oldenburg performed satisfactorily. In June 1887, Germany dedicated the Kaiser Wilhelm Canal; Oldenburg was among the ships present during the celebrations. Oldenburg was assigned to the training squadron for the maneuvers in August‚ÄìSeptember 1887, along with K√∂nig Wilhelm and Kaiser. The majority of the exercises were focused in the Baltic, but the fleet did conduct maneuvers in the North Sea for eight days in September. Oldenburg also participated in the visit to Great Britain in August 1889, where Wilhelm II took part in the Cowes Regatta. The ship was assigned to I Division with Sachsen, , and the new cruiser . Oldenburg and the rest of the fleet joined the Royal Navy in a fleet review for Queen Victoria. Oldenburg participated in the ceremonial transfer of the island of Helgoland from British to German control in the summer of 1890. She was present during the fleet maneuvers in September, where the entire eight-ship armored squadron simulated a Russian fleet blockading Kiel. She remained with I Division in 1891; the year's maneuvers simulated a two-front war against Russia and either France or Denmark. In 1892, however, W√ºrttemberg replaced Oldenburg in I Division, and the latter went into reserve. The ship remained out of service for the next five years. She returned to active duty in 1897 to join an international naval demonstration off the island of Crete, which had been annexed by Greece. The ship remained in the demonstration until March 1898, when Germany and Austria- Hungary withdrew their naval contingents in a show of dissatisfaction over the compromise solution, which left Crete under Ottoman control, but with a Greek prince. In 1900, Oldenburg was reduced to serve as a harbor guard ship. She was later used as a depot ship before being stricken from the naval register on 13 January 1912. The vessel was then used as a target ship by the High Seas Fleet until after the German defeat in World War I. Oldenburg was sold to Hattinger Company, a ship-breaking firm, on 5 May 1919. The ship was dismantled for scrap in Wilhelmshaven that year.

It started doing experimental broadcasts funded by the television tax. The channel started commercial broadcasting in 4 November 1993 regulated and managed by The Second Authority for Television and Radio. In its first years, the channel was operated by three broadcasters (\\"Keshet\\", \\"Reshet\\", and \\"Telad\\"), and in 2005 only two broadcasters were left while \\"Telad\\" stopped broadcasting due to its loss in the Second Authority's auction. In 31 October 2017, 24 years after the Channel started broadcasting, it got closed and split into two new channels: Keshet 12 and Reshet 13. The News Company that was founded alongside the Channel continues to broadcast news to both of the channels in parallel despite the split. History Israeli News Company studios in Neve Ilan The idea of a second television channel in Israel was first mooted in 1978 when the Israeli government set up a special committee headed by Haim Kovarsky (he) to explore the establishment of a second channel that would not be under supervision of the Israel Broadcasting Authority (IBA) and would be financed by advertising, however the idea of commercial television was rejected by the National Religious Party (NRP), which was part of the ruling coalition at that time. On 23 October 1986, Amnon Rubinstein, the then Minister of Communications, ordered the start of \\"experimental transmissions\\" on a second channel, claiming that unless these transmissions had started, the frequencies would have been used by TV networks in neighbouring countries.Israeli Television and the National Agenda The first transmissions were aired on UHF channel 21 from Mount Eitanim transmission tower situated on the hills west of Jerusalem. These transmissions, which initially included 2‚Äì3 hours of video clips every evening originating from a private TV studio in Jerusalem, expanded gradually to include a full program lineup. At that time the IBA was legally responsible for the channel, but it actually saw it as unexpected competition, tried to prevent its inauguration, and was reluctant to take responsibility for its broadcasts. In 1986 the Knesset started discussing the law forming the Second Israeli Broadcasting Authority, and in 1990, the Knesset passed a law that paved the way for the establishment of commercial television in Israel. The goal was to enhance pluralism and create competition. Channel 2 began broadcasting on 4 November 1993. Three concessionaires were chosen: Keshet, Telad and Reshet. The concessionaires received a broadcasting contract for one decade and worked out a rotation agreement amongst themselves. In 2005, the Ministry of Communications announced that two concessionaires would receive broadcasting contracts for the following decade. Of the four competitors (the fourth being Kan), Keshet and Reshet were chosen. Telad, which lost the bid, stopped broadcasting on Channel 2 in October 2005. Keshet and Reshet broadcast 4 days a week, rotating every two years. In 2011, Channel 2 installed a new digital system to preserve news content that was stored on aging videotapes and manage its archive library.  Experimental broadcasts  Channel 2 started its experimental broadcasts in September 1986. Until that time, Channel 1 was the only channel broadcasting in Israel. When the broadcasting started, a test card was shown and in October of the same year the channel started showing photographs of Israel's landscapes and instructions on how to receive the transmissions. On 23 October 1986, Channel 2 started broadcasting music videos. This is considered the beginning of the Experimental Channel 2's broadcasts. In its first months, the broadcasts were two-three hours long. In February 1987, the Demjanjuk trial was broadcast in Channel 2. In the same year's independence day, the experimental channel did a live news broadcast during the entire holiday. In 1987, there was a labor strike in the IBA and Channel 1 did not broadcast for a period of 52 days. During the strike, Channel 2 got a permission to expand its broadcasting hours and to broadcast movies and various imported TV shows. Later, the government let Channel 2 broadcast in Channel 1's frequencies. This was deemed as an attempt from the government to stop the strike. During the strike, Ida Nudel arrived in Israel and the experimental channel was directed to live broadcast her welcoming ceremony. With the end of the strike, the IBA stopped working with Channel 2 and Channel 2 stopped airing its special productions. In 1990, the Knesset passed the Second Israeli Broadcasting Authority law and Channel 2 officially became an independent channel.  Commercial broadcasting  After seven years of experimental broadcasts, the bid to determine Channel 2's franchisees ended. The chosen companies were \\"Keshet\\", \\"Reshet\\", and \\"Telad\\". The bid ended on 3 November 1993. Parallelly, Channel 2's news company was founded. On 4 November 1993, Channel 2 started broadcasting as a commercial channel that is not funded by a TV tax and aired commercials. The news company opened the broadcast with a short news briefing with Ya'akov Eilon. The three franchisees got a contract for six years and later, it was extended to another six years. The channel became quickly the most watched channel in Israel.  Second bid  In 2005, 12 years after Channel 2 started broadcasting, the Second Authority did another bid for only two franchisees. All three existing franchisees of Channel 2 applied for the bid and also \\"Kan Group\\" which was founded for this bid and did not broadcast before. \\"Noga Tikshoret\\" applied for the bid first as an independent franchisee but then applied along with \\"Reshet\\" under the name \\"Reshet-Noga\\". On 13 April, \\"Keshet\\" and \\"Reshet\\" won the bid. In November 2005, \\"Telad\\" stopped its broadcasting on Channel 2 and the broadcasting week was filled by \\"Keshet\\" and \\"Reshet\\" broadcasting.  Switching to widescreen and HD broadcasting  Since the end of 2012, Channel 2's franchisees started gradually changing their content to widescreen format and during 2013, \\"Keshet\\" started broadcasting in 16:9 aspect ratio and \\"Reshet\\" followed on later. Since 2014, most of both franchisees' contents were broadcast in 16:9 although the News Company kept broadcasting in 4:3, as well as old programs' reruns. In 2010, \\"Reshet\\" asked the Second Authority for HD broadcasting. The request was turned down because all commercial channels had to go through the Second Authorities' systems and they did not work with HD broadcasts. Both of the franchisees did not broadcast in HD before Channel 2's closure, although by that time, most of their productions were shot in HD and were available to watch in HD on the VOD and the internet. As a part of Channel 2's splitting in November 2017, \\"Keshet\\" and \\"Reshet\\" moved to broadcast in separate channels and one of the requirements to broadcast was that the broadcaster had to broadcast in HD quality.  Channel 2's splitting  In 2014, a bill to split Channel 2 and to end the franchise period in April 2015 was suggested and the broadcasters will broadcast in separate channels. \\"Keshet\\" and \\"Reshet\\" declared that they prefer to keep broadcasting in Channel 2 until 2017. Eventually, the bill did not pass. On 26 April 2017, \\"Keshet\\" and \\"Reshet\\" declared that from November 2017 \\"Keshet\\" will broadcast in Channel 12, \\"Reshet\\" will broadcast in channel 13 and Channel 22 will not be used for four months after the split. On 31 October 2017, from 21:30 to midnight, \\"Keshet\\" did a broadcast to conclude Channel 2's broadcasts. The broadcast was conducted by Erez Tal and many of Keshet's talents participated in it. A broadcasting hour was given to \\"Reshet\\" to say goodbye to Channel 2. Before the split, the franchisees started promoting the new channels with their programs. Since the law that splits the channel, the franchisees started showing their logos in the bottom left corner of their broadcasts. The news company will keep existing under the ownership of both franchisees until October 2018, when \\"Reshet\\" and Channel 10 will merge. Most of the news company's contents are broadcast in parallel on both channels except for the commercial breaks and the weather forecast's sponsorship ads. During the news company's broadcasts, the news company's logo is shown under the channel's logo. In order for \\"Reshet\\" and Channel 10 to merge, Reshet will sell its share in the news company to \\"Keshet\\".  Effect of Channel 2's splitting on Channel 10 and 33  Channel 10 = In addition to Channel 2's splitting, Channel 10 will also move to a different channel. Channel 10 won channel 14 in the bid for a price of one Shekel and 54 Agorot. The channel crowdfunded the purchase in a Headstart project. On 19 September 2017, due to Channel 2's splitting and the move to channel 14, the channel rebranded to a verbal branding - \\"◊¢◊©◊® (ten)\\" - instead of the old channel's number. Less than one year after the split, \\"Reshet\\" and Channel 10's shareholders decided to merge. = Makan 33 = Although there is no connection between the commercial channels to IPBC's channels, Channel 2's split might affect the viewing habits of Israel's Arab citizens. In October 2017, the second authority decided to transfer Makan 33 to the second array of Idan+ (DVB-T2) and leave \\"Keshet 12\\" and \\"Reshet 13\\" in the current array (DVB-T). The meaning is that viewers without an Idan+ receiver that supports DVB-T2, could not watch \\"Makan 33\\" after 1 November 2017. The reason for this decision is because of \\"Makan 33\\"'s low rating and since it broadcasts only for several hours each day. IPBC's chairman, Gil Omer resisted the decision.

Ignacio Aldecoa (24 July 1925 ‚Äì 15 November 1969) was a Spanish author. Biography Jos√© Ignacio de Aldecoa was born in Vitoria-Gasteiz on 24 July 1925, the first child of Sim√≥n de Aldecoa and Carmen Isasi. He had a sister called Mar√≠a Teresa, born in 1927. Ignacio's father was a middle-class artisan who ran a family business in industrial decoration and restoration inherited from his father, Laureano de Aldecoa. The young Aldecoa was affectionately known as I√±aki in the home and enjoyed a happy and lively childhood marred only by his experience of school. Aldecoa studied in the Arts Faculty at the University of Madrid. He lived later in the United States of America. His first published works were collections of poetry, published in 1947 and 1949. El fulgor y la sangre was his first novel, published in 1954. It failed to win the important Premio Planeta by just one vote. El fulgor forms part of a projected trilogy: the first part, El fulgor deals with the Civil Guard; the second (Con el viento solano, 1956), deals with to some extent with gypsies, traditional enemies, not to say victims, of the Guards; the third part, Los pozos, never appeared but apparently dealt with bullfighters. The link between the three is that in the first part a guard is murdered by a gypsy; the flight to Madrid and eventual surrender of the killer (Sebasti√°n V√°zquez) are related in part two; V√°zquez is a friend of the bullfighters and something of an aficionado of the sport - this may have been what leads to the final part. Aldecoa was a fairly prolific writer, he produced about half a dozen novels and as many books of short stories as well as some travel books. He belongs to that second generation of post war novelists who (unlike Camilo Jos√© Cela, Carmen Laforet, Miguel Delibes, e.g.) were still very young when the war ended and had no direct personal involvement in it. Within the obvious limits dictated by prudence, Aldecoa seeks to approach the issue of the Civil War impartially in El fulgor, which contains many flashbacks and reminiscences of the 1930s, though set in 1948. His narrative work reflected the neorealism current in Spain in the 1950s, and his stories have the flavour of an experience felt and lived. He was also a journalist and broadcaster, and wrote four movie scripts. In 1952 Ignacio Aldecoa married Spanish writer and teacher Josefina Rodr√≠guez √Ålvarez (who changed her name to Josefina Aldecoa after her husband died). They had a daughter, Susana Aldecoa, who is today the Principal of Colegio Estilo. Ignacio Aldecoa died in Madrid in 1969, at age 44.

The Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA) was the first act of the United States Congress to call specifically for an ecosystem approach to wildlife management. Authority MMPA was signed into law on October 21, 1972, by President Richard Nixon and took effect 60 days later on December 21, 1972. It prohibits the \\"taking\\" of marine mammals, and enacts a moratorium on the import, export, and sale of any marine mammal, along with any marine mammal part or product within the United States. The Act defines \\"take\\" as \\"the act of hunting, killing, capture, and/or harassment of any marine mammal; or, the attempt at such.\\" The MMPA defines harassment as \\"any act of pursuit, torment or annoyance which has the potential to either: a. injure a marine mammal in the wild, or b. disturb a marine mammal by causing disruption of behavioral patterns, which includes, but is not limited to, migration, breathing, nursing, breeding, feeding, or sheltering.\\" The MMPA provides for enforcement of its prohibitions, and for the issuance of regulations to implement its legislative goals. Authority to manage the MMPA was divided between the Secretary of the Interior through the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), and the Secretary of Commerce, which is delegated to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). Subsequently, a third federal agency, the Marine Mammal Commission (MMC), was established to review existing policies and make recommendations to the Service and the NOAA better implement the MMPA. Coordination between these three federal agencies is necessary in order to provide the best management practices for marine mammals. Under the MMPA, the Service is responsible for ensuring the protection of sea otters and marine otters, walruses, polar bears, three species of manatees, and dugongs. NOAA was given responsibility to conserve and manage pinnipeds including seals and sea lions and cetaceans such as whales and dolphins.  Marine mammal permits and international coordination  The MMPA prohibits the take and exploitation of any marine mammal without appropriate authorization, which may only be given by the Service. Permits may be issued for scientific research, public display, and the importation/exportation of marine mammal parts and products upon determination by the Service that the issuance is consistent with the MMPA‚Äôs regulations. The two types of permits issued by the National Marine Fisheries Service's Office of Protected Resources are incidental and directed. Incidental permits, which allow for some unintentional taking of small numbers of marine mammal, are granted to U.S. citizens who engage in a specified activity other than commercial fishing in a specified geographic area. Directed permits are required for any proposed marine mammal scientific research activity that involves taking marine mammals. Applications for such permits are reviewed and issued the Service's Division of Management Authority, through the International Affairs office. This office also houses the Division of International Conservation, which is directly responsible for coordinating international activities for marine mammal species found in both U.S. and International waters, or are absent from U.S. waters. Marine mammal species inhabiting both U.S. and International waters include the West Indian manatee, sea otter, polar bear, and Pacific walrus. Species not present in U.S. waters include the West African and Amazonian manatee, dugong, Atlantic walrus, and marine otter.  Marine mammal conservation in the field  In efforts to conserve and manage marine mammal species, the Service has appointed field staff dedicated to working with partners to conduct population censuses, assess population health, develop and implement conservation plans, promulgate regulations, and create cooperative relationships internationally. Various Marine Mammal Management offices are located on either coast. The Service's Marine Mammal Management office in Anchorage, Alaska is responsible for the management and conservation of polar bears, Pacific walruses, and northern sea otters in Alaska. Northern sea otters present in Washington state are managed by the Western Washington Field Office, while southern sea otters residing in California are managed by the Ventura Field Office. West Indian manatee populations extend from Texas to Rhode Island, and are also present in the Caribbean Sea; however, this species is most prevalent near Florida (the Florida subspecies) and Puerto Rico (the Antillean subspecies). The Service‚Äôs Jacksonville Field Office manages the Florida manatee, while the Boqueron Field Office manages the Antillean manatee. The polar bear, southern sea otter, marine otter, all three species of manatees, and the dugong are also concurrently listed under the Endangered Species Act (ESA).  Amendments  Amendments enacted in 1981 established conditions for permits to be granted to take marine mammals \\"incidentally\\" in the course of commercial fishing. In addition, the amendments provided additional conditions and procedures for transferring management authority to the States, and authorized appropriations through FY 1984. Policies created in 1982 * Some marine mammal species or stocks may be in danger of extinction or depletion as a result of human activities. * These species or stocks must not be permitted to fall below their optimum sustainable population level (depleted) * Measures should be taken to replenish these species or stocks * There is inadequate knowledge of the ecology and population dynamics * Marine mammals have proven to be resources of great international significance. The 1984 amendments established conditions to be satisfied as a basis for importing fish and fish products from nations engaged in harvesting yellowfin tuna with purse seines and other commercial fishing technology, as well as authorized appropriations for agency activities through FY 1988. Amended in 1988 * the establishment of conditions and procedures for the Secretaries of Commerce and Interior to review the status of populations to determine if they should be listed as \\"depleted\\" (below optimal, sustainable population numbers or listed as threatened or endangered); * the preparation of conservation plans for any species listed as depleted, including a requirement that such plans be modeled after recovery plans developed pursuant to the Endangered Species Act; * the listing of conditions under which permits may be issued to take marine mammals for the protection and welfare of the animals, including importation, public display, scientific research, and enhancing the survival or recovery of a species; and * a reward system under which the Secretary of the Treasury can pay up to $2500 to individuals providing information leading to convictions for violations of the Act. Amended in 1995 * Certain exceptions to the take prohibitions, such as for Alaska Native subsistence and permits and authorizations for scientific research; * A program to authorize and control the taking of marine mammals incidental to commercial fishing operations; * Preparation of stock assessments for all marine mammal stocks in waters under U.S. jurisdiction; and * Studies of pinniped-fishery interactions. Findings Congress found that: all species and population stocks of marine mammals are, or may be, in danger of extinction or depletion due to human activities; these mammals should not be permitted to diminish below their optimum sustainable population; measures should be taken immediately to replenish any of these mammals that have diminished below that level, and efforts should be made to protect essential habitats; there is inadequate knowledge of the ecology and population dynamics of these mammals; negotiations should be undertaken immediately to encourage international arrangements for research and conservation of these mammals. Congress declared that marine mammals are resources of great international significance (aesthetic, recreational and economic), and should be protected and encouraged to develop to the greatest extent feasible commensurate with sound policies of resource management. The primary management objective should be to maintain the health and stability of the marine ecosystem. The goal is to obtain an optimum sustainable population within the carrying capacity of the habitat.

The act has been reauthorized several times over the years.National Coalition for the Homeless, \\"NCH Public Policy Recommendations: HUD McKinney-Vento Reauthorization\\", September 14, 2009 The McKinney Act originally had fifteen programs providing a spectrum of services to homeless people, including the Continuum of Care Programs: the Supportive Housing Program, the Shelter Plus Care Program, and the Single Room Occupancy Program, as well as the Emergency Shelter Grant Program.Cf. National Coatition for the Homeless, \\"Fact sheet on The Stewart B. McKinney Homeless Assistance Act\\", June 2006. \\"The McKinney-Vento Act originally consisted of fifteen programs providing a range of services to homeless people, including emergency shelter, transitional housing, job training, primary health care, education, and some permanent housing.\\" It established the Interagency Council on the Homeless (later called the Interagency Council on Homelessness). The legislation has been amended several times since it was first written and enacted. Sponsored by Representative Tom Foley (D-WA), the bill was named after Representatives Stewart McKinney (R-CT) and Bruce Vento (D-MN).

L. 100-77, > title I, Sec. 102, July 22, 1987, 101 Stat. 484.)  Homeless children and education  The original federal Act, known simply as the McKinney Act, provided little protection for homeless children in the area of public education. As a result, the State of Illinois passed the Illinois Education for Homeless Children Act, which was drafted by Joseph Clary, an attorney and advocate for the Illinois Coalition to End Homelessness. Clary then worked with national advocates to ensure that the protections afforded to homeless children by the Illinois statute were incorporated into the McKinney Act. At that point, the McKinney Act was amended to become the McKinney-Vento Act. That Act uses the Illinois statute in defining homeless children as \\"individuals who lack a fixed, regular, and adequate nighttime residence.\\" The Act then goes on to give examples of children who would fall under this definition: *(a) Children sharing housing due to economic hardship or loss of housing; *(b) Children living in \\"motels, hotels, trailer parks, or camp grounds due to lack of alternative accommodations\\" *(c) Children living in \\"emergency or transitional shelters\\" *(d) Children whose primary nighttime residence is not ordinarily used as a regular sleeping accommodation (e.g. park benches, etc.) *(e) Children living in \\"cars, parks, public spaces, abandoned buildings, substandard housing, bus or train stations...\\" Following the Illinois statute, the McKinney-Vento Act also ensures homeless children transportation to and from school free of charge, allowing children to attend their school of origin (last school enrolled or the school they attended when they first became homeless) regardless of what district the family resides in. It further requires schools to register homeless children even if they lack normally required documents, such as immunization records or proof of residence. To implement the Act, States must designate a statewide homeless coordinator to review policies and create procedures, including dispute resolution procedures, to ensure that homeless children are able to attend school. Local school districts must appoint Local Education Liaisons to ensure that school staff are aware of these rights, to provide public notice to homeless families (at shelters and at school) and to facilitate access to school and transportation services.Department of Education, Office of Elementary and Secondary Education, \\"McKinney-Vento Education for Homeless Children and Youths Program: Notice of school enrollment guidelines\\" Designation of Act Title The 1987 Act was renamed with the United States 106th Congressional session enactment of the McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act of 2000. The 2000 Act was confirmed as a federal law by the 42nd President of the United States Bill Clinton on October 30, 2000.

It is a subjective term applied by sportswriters to describe the most notable games of the period.

November 18, 2006Middies All Hepped Up to Knock Over Cadets. Los Angeles Times, November 27, 1945. Navy, far from conceding next Saturday's football \\"game of the century\\" to Army, will field a spirited, offense-minded team determined to win and \\"not merely hold down the score\\", Public Relations Chief Lt. William Sullivan said today. What makes the phrase subjective is that sportswriters and fans list the games that they remember or attended. Games that were played before radio and television broadcasts are only preserved in print. Working sportswriters have a history that goes back at most to the middle of the 20th century. Television and the Internet have made broadcasts of more recent games available to all. Unlike the \\"Game of the Century\\" in college basketball, or the 1958 NFL Championship Game, which is commonly called \\"The Greatest Game Ever Played\\", there has been no specific college football game that changed the sport as dramatically. College football was also played during the last three decades of the 19th Century, but no games during those years rose to the level of \\"The Game of the Century.\\" Hence each of the various \\"Games of the 20th Century\\" could also be validly characterized as \\"The Game of the Millennium.\\" What makes a game \\"The Game of the Century\\"=No. 1 vs No. 2 Some of the games were a No. 1 vs No. 2 in the AP Poll, which happened only 31 times in the 20th century.Games Where #1 Faced #2 (kiko13.com) Quite often a winning streak is on the line and the winner goes on to win the national championship. The prospect of two juggernaut teams on a roll, or \\"the irresistible force meets the immovable object\\", creates a high-interest spectacle. While the Bowl Championship Series was created to produce a matchup of the top two teams in the nation at the end of the year, a BCS championship game does not automatically constitute a \\"Game of the Century.\\" Otherwise, every year's championship game would be a \\"Game of the Century.\\" Great players Although college football is a team game, individual performances can be the difference maker in a great game. The Heisman Trophy is awarded to the greatest players in the game. A top player, having the best game or best play of his career, is another common theme in the \\"Game of the Century\\". Unexpected outcome The \\"Game of the Century\\" is not always a decisive win. The lure of sport is that the outcome is in doubt until the game is played.

All rankings are from the AP Poll. 1935 Notre Dame vs. Ohio State November 2, 1935: A then Ohio Stadium record crowd of 81,018 witnessed what was billed as The Game of the Century, the first ever meeting between Ohio State and Notre Dame. Ohio State led 13-0 heading into the fourth, but Notre Dame rallied with three fourth-quarter touchdowns and fed off several OSU miscues to pull out an 18-13 win. Notre Dame's Bill Shakespeare, a Cincinnati native, threw the game-winning 19-yard pass to Wayne Millner with 32 seconds left. Tickets for this game sold for $50 each and there were widespread reports of counterfeit tickets. OSU officials said they could have sold 200,000 tickets for the game if they had room. In the end however, neither team was considered close to national champions, a title that went to TCU and LSU. TCU defeated LSU 3-2 three years later to become outright national champions. The Ohio State-Notre Dame game was the most covered and most popular game of 1935. 1945 Army vs. Navy December 1, 1945: Heading into the final game of the season both Army (8‚Äì0) and Navy (7‚Äì0‚Äì1) were undefeated and ranked #1 and #2 respectively, and with both teams buoyed by the recent victory in World War II, this game had all the earmarkings of a potential classic. President Harry S. Truman even decided to attend. However, the match-up did not live up to its pre-game \\"Game of the Century\\" billing as West Point would go on to win in a rout. A three touchdown, 20 point first quarter gave Army a lead they would not yield, going on to win 32-13. 1946 Army vs. Notre Dame November 9, 1946: The Army Cadets, then ranked Number 1 in the Associated Press college football poll, played the Notre Dame Fighting Irish, of South Bend, Indiana, ranked Number 2, at Yankee Stadium in New York City. This matchup, with the national attention it got in the era before the service academies ceased to be major football powers, was usually played at a neutral site, often in New York City. The 1924 game between the schools, a Notre Dame victory at the Polo Grounds, was the game at which sportswriter Grantland Rice christened the Fighting Irish backfield‚Äîquarterback Harry Stuhldreher, halfbacks Jim Crowley and Don Miller, and fullback Elmer Layden ‚Äì the \\"Four Horsemen.\\" The 1928 edition, with Notre Dame trailing Army at halftime at Yankee Stadium, was the game where Notre Dame coach Knute Rockne delivered his \\"Win one for the Gipper\\" speech, resulting in a comeback win for the Fighting Irish. Both teams were undefeated going into the 1946 game at Yankee Stadium. Both teams averaged over 30 points per game. Army had a 25-game winning streak over four years, last losing to Notre Dame in 1943 (26‚Äì0), but had won the last two contests between the schools by scores of 59-0 and 48-0. Army had the defending Heisman Trophy winner, Doc Blanchard, also known as \\"Mr. Inside\\", the man who would win it that year, Glenn Davis, also known as \\"Mr. Outside\\", and one of the nation's top quarterbacks in Arnold Tucker. Notre Dame had the quarterback who would win the Heisman the next year, Johnny Lujack. Both Tucker and Lujack were also outstanding defensive backs at a time when football players, college as well as professional, usually played both offense and defense. Just the previous year, in a game also labeled the \\"game of the century\\" before it was played, Army defeated a 7‚Äì0‚Äì1 Navy team 32‚Äì13. Navy's lone tie was against Notre Dame. Despite the high-scoring and much-hyped offenses, the game ended in a scoreless tie, with each school's best chance at a scoring drive coming back- to-back: Tucker intercepting Lujack, and Lujack then making a touchdown-saving tackle on Blanchard a few plays later. Notre Dame's defense did something no other team had ever done ‚Äî it held the famous \\"Touchdown Twins\\", Blanchard and Davis, to a total of 79 yards. As an indication of how the defense of both teams dominated, seven linemen in that game were nominated for Lineman of the Week honors in the weekly Associated Press poll. Joe Steffy, an Army guard who helped shut down the Notre Dame running game, won the honor, followed closely by Notre Dame right tackle George Sullivan and freshman lineman Jim Martin who helped stifle Army's running attack and dropped Davis on consecutive plays for losses totalling 17 yards. Both Notre Dame coach Frank Leahy and Army coach Earl Blaik called the game \\"a terrific battle of defenses.\\" Both teams would finish the season undefeated with this one tie, but it was Notre Dame that was awarded the national championship by the Associated Press, with Army coming in second. Neither school accepted bowl bids during that era, although a bowl loss would not have affected the national championship outcome since these were named before the postseason bowls in this era. Army declined an invitation to play in the 1947 Rose Bowl. The Army Black Knights / Cadets / the Corps Football media guide lists the 1946 team as national champions.2008 Army West Point Football Media Guide. PDF copy available at http://www.goarmysports.com With Blanchard, Davis and Tucker having graduated, Army's winning streak would be broken the next year, by Columbia University. Notre Dame would not lose until early in the 1950 season. Sporting News named the 1944‚Äì45 Army Black Knights / Cadets / the Corps and 1946 Fighting Irish the second and fifth greatest teams of the 20th Century respectively. 1966 Notre Dame vs. Michigan State November 19, 1966: Notre Dame Fighting Irish vs. Michigan State Spartans, at Spartan Stadium in East Lansing, Michigan. Notre Dame, which hadn't won a national championship since 1949, was ranked #1 in one poll and #2 in the other. Defending National Champion Michigan State entered the game ranked #2 in one poll and #1 in the other. This was the first time in 20 years that a college football game was given the \\"Game of the Century\\" tag by the national media. The game was not shown live on national TV. The agreement between the NCAA and ABC in effect at the time limited each team to one national television appearance and two regional television appearances each season. Notre Dame had used their national TV slot in the season opening game against Purdue. ABC executives did not even want to show the game anywhere but the regional area, but pressure from the West Coast and the South (to the tune of 50,000 letters) made ABC air the game on tape delay. Irish quarterback Terry Hanratty was knocked out after getting sacked in the first quarter by Spartan defensive lineman Bubba Smith. Starting Notre Dame running back Nick Eddy was out entirely after hurting his shoulder getting off the train in East Lansing. Michigan State held a 10‚Äì0 lead by early in the second quarter. But the Irish came back, scoring a touchdown right after Michigan State's field goal and tied the game on the first play of the fourth quarter. Notre Dame had the ball on its own 30-yard line with 1:10 to go, needing about 40 yards for a game-winning field goal. But Notre Dame coach Ara Parseghian chose to run the clock out, not wanting to risk a turnover, preserving the tie and Notre Dame's #1 ranking. The game ended in a 10‚Äì10 tie. For the subsequent 50 years, Parseghian defended his end-of-the-game strategy, which left many fans feeling disappointed at the game not having some sort of resolution. College football expert Dan Jenkins led off his article for Sports Illustrated by saying Parseghian chose to \\"Tie one for the Gipper.\\" Others chided Notre Dame by calling them the \\"Tying Irish\\" instead of the \\"Fighting Irish.\\" Notre Dame beat Rose Bowl bound USC 51‚Äì0 in Los Angeles the next week, completing an undefeated regular season and moving them to #1 in both polls. The Irish did not accept bowl bids until 1969, and Michigan State was the victim of a pair of Big Ten rules that would be rescinded a few years later: the same school could not represent the league in the Rose Bowl in back-to- back seasons, and only the league Champions could accept a bowl bid, unless they refused the Rose Bowl bid or, because it was on probation, were prohibited from accepting the bid, which, in either case, would then go to the second-place team. So despite being Big Ten Champions and undefeated in the regular season, in each case for two seasons in a row, the Spartans could not play in the Rose Bowl. The Sporting News named the 1966 Fighting Irish and 1965‚Äì66 Spartans the eleventh and thirteenth greatest teams of the 20th Century respectively. 1967 UCLA vs. USC November 18, 1967: The UCLA Bruins, ranked Number 1 in both polls, played the USC Trojans, ranked Number 2 in the coaches poll and 4 in the AP poll. The Bruins had senior quarterback Gary Beban as the leading Heisman Trophy candidate and the Trojans had junior running back O. J. Simpson also as a strong Heisman candidate in a showcase game for player of the year. This is widely regarded as the signature game in the UCLA‚ÄìUSC rivalry. The game would be broadcast live and in color in ABC's second season of covering college football. At the time, both teams played their home games at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum (and did so until 1982 when UCLA moved to the Rose Bowl stadium). Both teams wore their home uniforms, as was their custom for this rivalry when they shared a common home field. This game was for the \\"championship of Los Angeles\\", for the championship of the AAWU conference (later the Pac-8 Conference, subsequently the Pac-10 Conference, now the Pac-12), and for Rose Bowl berth. This game was also for the national championship, since (for the final time) the final AP poll would be published before the bowl games. The loser would not only miss out on the national championship, but would not even go to a bowl game, since the AAWU's agreement with the Rose Bowl allowed only one school to represent the league in the postseason (this provision was not repealed until 1975). With the game tied 14‚Äì14 early in the fourth quarter, an injured Beban gamely threw a touchdown pass, but the extra point attempt was blocked, resulting in a 20‚Äì14 UCLA lead. Trojan quarterback Toby Page called a pass play, then saw the Bruin linebackers drop back into pass coverage. He changed the signals before the snap, and handed off to Simpson, who ran 64 yards for a touchdown. USC kicked the extra point and held on to win 21‚Äì20. As a result of this game, USC finished the season ranked #1 in both polls and would go on to defeat the Indiana Hoosiers in the 1968 Rose Bowl. UCLA would finish the season unranked in the AP poll (at the time, this poll only ranked the top ten teams) and #11 in the UPI poll. Despite the loss, Beban would win the Heisman; Simpson would win it the next season. Keith Jackson, who covered the game for ABC, declared it many years later to be the greatest game he has ever seen.Coach of the Year (2007) - hosted by Keith Jackson \\"Keith Jackson has been broadcasting college football since 1952 and has reported games like the \\"Game of the Century\\" between UCLA and USC in 1967.\\" So did Giles Pellerin, a USC graduate who attended every game USC played from 1926 until his death at the 1998 USC-UCLA game at the Rose Bowl, 797 straight games over 72 years. Both USC broadcasters Tom Kelly and Pete Arbogast also stated that it was the greatest win in Trojan Football history ‚Äì the latter attended the game at the age of 12 and lost his voice that day. The Sporting News named the 1967 Trojans one of the greatest teams of the 20th Century. 1969 Texas vs. Arkansas December 6, 1969: University of Texas at Austin vs. University of Arkansas. In a game between unbeatens played at Arkansas' Razorback Stadium in Fayetteville, the Texas Longhorns were ranked #1 in the country, having won 18 straight games. The Arkansas Razorbacks were ranked #2, having won 15 straight. This game would decide the Southwest Conference Championship, as well as its berth in the Cotton Bowl Classic, setting it up to win the national championship. Sensing that the matchup might be a possible 1-vs.-2 showdown, ABC offered to move the game from October 18 to December 6 to give it more of a national audience to showcase the 100th year of college football, and the schools, enjoying the publicity, accepted. Thanks to a fortuitous upset of top-ranked Ohio State by Michigan, which elevated Texas and Arkansas to the top two spots, the move worked, making their game the focus of the entire American sporting scene. The game pulled a television rating of a 50 share, meaning half the TV sets in the country were tuned to this game. President Richard Nixon attended the game along with several members of his staff and U.S. Representatives George H. W. Bush of Texas and John Paul Hammerschmidt of Arkansas, having announced that he would give a plaque to the winner, proclaiming it to be the National Champion ‚Äî to the chagrin of observers who thought it premature to do so before the New Year's Day bowl games, and of fans of Pennsylvania State University, which would also end the season undefeated. Arkansas took a 14‚Äì0 lead, and held it into the fourth quarter, but Texas came from behind to win, 15‚Äì14, and accepted Nixon's plaque. The signature play of the game came in the 4th quarter with Texas trailing 14‚Äì8. The Longhorns, normally a conservative power running team, faced 4th and 3 and chose to gamble with a deep play action pass. Quarterback James Street was so surprised by the call that he asked head coach Darrell Royal \\"Are you sure?\\" before heading to the huddle. Despite double coverage, Street hit Randy Peschel with a 44-yard pass to keep the drive alive. Texas scored to take the lead 2 plays later. Texas beat Notre Dame in the Cotton Bowl Classic, and removed any doubt as to whether it deserved consideration as National Champion, although Penn State fans still insist that their team, also undefeated and winner of the Orange Bowl, was better. However, it is worth noting that the Cotton Bowl Classic first invited Penn State to play the Southwest Conference champions. The Nittany Lions declined the invitation due to segregation issues, which would have resulted in them playing Texas and only one team ending the year undefeated, preferring to spend New Year's Day in warm Miami, where they defeated Big 8 champion Missouri. The 1969 Texas-Penn State conflict, never settled on the field, remains one of the lasting arguments in College Football history. Arkansas lost the Sugar Bowl to Ole Miss. The entire Texas-Penn State debate and Nixon's involvement led to a quote from Penn State coach Joe Paterno, a conservative Republican, during a commencement speech at Penn State in 1973 about Nixon, \\"How could Nixon know so much about college football in 1969 and so little about Watergate in 1973?\\" Alt URL This game has been nicknamed \\"Dixie's Last Stand\\", since it was the last major American sporting event played between two all-white teams, although almost the entire Southeastern Conference teams did not integrate their varsity football squads until the mid-1970s. With the Vietnam War still raging and Nixon in attendance, protesters came to the game, and one of them got into a tree overlooking the stadium and held up an antiwar sign. The racial and political implications and the build-up to the game were the subject of a 2005 book, Horns, Hogs and Nixon Coming, which paid special attention to the demonstrations by anti-war and anti-racist groups. An urban legend grew up around this game, claiming that this protester was Arkansas native and future President Bill Clinton. Clinton, however, was not at the game, as he was then a Rhodes Scholar at the University of Oxford in England, and was listening to the game on a shortwave radio with some American friends. The two coaches in this game, Darrell Royal of Texas and Frank Broyles of Arkansas, both retired after the 1976 season and became athletic directors at their respective schools. Broyles, who retired as the Razorbacks' men's athletic director on December 31, 2007,Arkansas had a totally separate women's athletic department from 1971 until Broyles' retirement, after which the two departments merged. See Arkansas Lady'Backs. spearheaded Arkansas' move from the Southwest Conference to the SEC in 1990. Broyles was instrumental in the Razorbacks and Longhorns playing a two-year series in 2003 (at Austin) and 2004 (at Fayetteville). After the 1976 season, Broyles also became a top color analyst for College Football on ABC, often pairing up with Keith Jackson. The Sporting News named the 1969 Longhorns the seventh greatest team of the 20th Century.  1971 Nebraska vs. Oklahoma  November 25, 1971: Of this game, Dave Kindred of the Louisville Courier- Journal famously wrote: \\"They can quit playing now, they have played the perfect game.\\" The defending national champion Nebraska Cornhuskers, top- ranked with a 20-game winning streak, played the Oklahoma Sooners, ranked #2 with a national prominence dating back to the 1950s, when they won 3 national championships and an NCAA record 47 straight games.Oklahoma Sooners Official Athletic Site - Football at www.soonersports.com The teams combined for 17 of 22 first-team All-Big Eight players. Nebraska had the nation's top-ranked defense. Oklahoma had the nation's most productive offense, with their Wishbone averaging over 472 rushing yards per game, an NCAA record.1971 Oklahoma vs. Nebraska Game Recap - SoonerStats.com - Oklahoma Sooners Football, Basketball, and Baseball Scores, Records, and Stats at www.soonerstats.com The cover of Sports Illustrated (Nov. 22, 1971) published the week of the game included photographs of Nebraska linebacker Bob Terrio and Oklahoma running back Greg Pruitt, nose-to-nose, beneath the headline: \\"Irresistible Oklahoma Meets Immovable Nebraska.\\"1971 National Champions - Huskers.com¬óNebraska Athletics Official Web Site at www.huskers.com The cover story in that issue labeled it the \\"Game Of The Decade\\" and listed 25 of the greatest college football games played to that point. The Husker \\"Blackshirts\\" defense included seven first-team All-Big Eight selections, four players (all on the defensive line) who would earn consensus All-America recognition during their careers and two Outland Trophy winners: tackle Larry Jacobson and middle guard Rich Glover. Glover would win both the Outland and Lombardi awards in 1972 and eventually be inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame. They were joined in the starting lineup by end Willie Harper, like Glover, a two- time All-American. John Dutton, an All-American in 1973, was a sophomore backup. This defense is still considered by many to be the greatest in college football history. The Sooners' record setting wishbone was led by all-American QB Jack Mildren, who rushed for over 1,000 yards, but was also a very good passer. His weapons were Heisman Trophy candidate HB Greg Pruitt who averaged a stunning 9.5 yards per carry and speedy split end Jon Harrison. Future College Football Hall of Famer Tom Brahaney was the anchor at center. The Husker offense was led by flanker Johnny Rodgers, who would go on to win the Heisman the next season and bullish tailback Jeff Kinney, a future NFL first- round draft pick. The Sooner defense was anchored by all-Big 8 defensive tackle Derland Moore, a future all-American and NFL Pro Bowler. ABC-TV would broadcast the game nationally to an estimated 55 million viewers (at the time the largest television audience ever for a college football game) with Chris Schenkel doing the play-by-play. Joining him in the booth for color analysis was Oklahoma's legendary former coach, Bud Wilkinson, with Bill Flemming reporting from the sidelines. Before the game, Schenkel and Wilkinson emerged from the tunnel leading to the field, and when the Oklahoma crowd spotted Wilkinson, they erupted into applause. They came to their feet with admiration for the coach who had guided the Sooners to prominence with three national championships and an NCAA record 47-game winning streak in the 1950s. The game was played at Owen Field in Norman, Oklahoma, on Thanksgiving Day. Not only at stake was the Big Eight title, but also the #1 ranking in the polls. However, the bowl trips had already been determined before the game, with Nebraska going to the Orange Bowl in Miami and Oklahoma headed for the Sugar Bowl in New Orleans. Two days after Thanksgiving, #5 Auburn (9‚Äì0) would host #3 Alabama (10‚Äì0) for the Southeastern Conference title, the two opponents that Oklahoma and Nebraska would play. Given the game's magnitude, Devaney had his players' food flown in from Lincoln, in case gamblers attempted to induce a hotel chef to give the Huskers food poisoning. The game went back and forth. The Cornhuskers struck first, with Rodgers shocking the Sooners with a 72-yard punt return for a touchdown after the Sooners' first possession was stopped. The punt return remains one of college football's signature moments, though it remains controversial. Some observers and many Sooner fans claim Nebraska cornerback Joe Blahak appeared to clip Sooner receiver Jon Harrison as Rodgers stormed for the touchdown. No penalty was called, primarily because Blahak blocked Harrison at an angle, which was not a penalty. Referees for the game have continued to deny that there was a clip on the play, even after having studied film footage of it, which is inconclusive due to Blahak's trajectory. The first half was atypical for both teams, as the Cornhuskers' potent offense was stymied by the underrated Sooner defense; meanwhile, Oklahoma's devastating Wishbone offense was blunted by the brutal Cornhusker defense, as the Sooners had several turnovers and were continually frustrated by Husker middle guard Rich Glover, who would end up with twenty-two tackles on the day, despite lining up across from Sooner all-American center Tom Brahaney. Nebraska held a 14‚Äì3 lead, but Oklahoma came back, relying almost entirely on Jack Mildren's arm and legs, and the Sooners grabbed the lead at halftime, 17‚Äì14, on two long passes from Mildren to Harrison with just seconds left in the first half. For the first time all season, the Cornhuskers were trailing in a game. Relying on a power running game, the Huskers retook the lead and led 28‚Äì17 going into the fourth quarter. Quarterback Jack Mildren led the Sooners back, and Oklahoma led 31‚Äì28 with 7:05 to play. The Huskers got the ball back on their own 26-yard line. Getting to the Oklahoma 48, Husker quarterback Jerry Tagge threw to Rodgers, who broke tackles and ran all the way to the 15. Jeff Kinney then carried four times, the last resulting in his fourth touchdown of the game, and Nebraska led 35‚Äì31 with 1:38 left to play. Sacks of Mildren on third and fourth down in Sooner territory finished the game off as a Nebraska win. This game, much more than the previous year's national championship, made Nebraska a program with a national following. Already having sold every seat available at their Memorial Stadium since coach Bob Devaney arrived from Wyoming in 1962, they would be a perennial national championship contender and a frequent presence on national TV. The Cornhuskers went on to soundly defeat Alabama, by then ranked #2, 38‚Äì6 in the Orange Bowl, completing their back-to-back national championships. Devaney coached for one more year, going 9‚Äì2‚Äì1 and winning a third straight Orange Bowl, before becoming Nebraska's athletic director and handing the reins over to 36-year- old assistant Tom Osborne in 1973. Pruitt did not win the Heisman, which went to Auburn quarterback Pat Sullivan in 1971. By a coincidence, Auburn met Oklahoma in the Sugar Bowl, and the Sooners won 40‚Äì22. (By another coincidence, these two arch-rivals, Nebraska and Oklahoma, would end up playing each half of another nasty rivalry, Alabama and Auburn, and beat them both.) Despite the defeat, Oklahoma's program was also relaunched by this game, and they would be a perennial national championship contender throughout the 1970s and much of the 1980s. Oklahoma coach Chuck Fairbanks left the Sooners following the 1972 season to become the head coach of the New England Patriots of the NFL. Offensive coordinator Barry Switzer succeeded Fairbanks and compiled a 157‚Äì29‚Äì4 record from 1973‚Äì1988, and guided the Sooners to national championships in 1974, 1975, and 1985. The top three teams in the final AP poll for 1971 were from the Big Eight: Nebraska, Oklahoma, and Colorado. The fourth-ranked team was Alabama, Nebraska's bowl opponent, making the 1971 Nebraska team the only team ever to finish the season ranked #1 after beating the other three teams ranked in the top four. The Sporting News named the 1971 Cornhusker team the greatest team of the 20th century in 1988. ESPN.com has named the 1971 Nebraska Cornhusker team the greatest team of all time. 1986 Miami (FL) vs. Penn State January 2, 1987: In the next \\"Game of the Century\\", the largest television audience in college football history watched as the undefeated and #1 Miami Hurricanes battled the undefeated and #2 Penn State Nittany Lions in the Fiesta Bowl for the national championship.Bowl Championship Series - 1987 - Penn State 14, Miami 10 at espn.go.com The game garnered a 25.1 television rating, with an average of 21,940,000 viewers watching the NBC telecast per minute. Of the two teams, Miami had the star-power, as it was led by Heisman Trophy-winning quarterback Vinny Testaverde, running back Alonzo Highsmith, and defensive tackle Jerome Brown, all of whom would be selected within the first nine picks of that April's NFL Draft. Miami was seldom challenged during the regular season and was considered a prohibitive favorite over the gritty Nittany Lions. Tensions between the teams were heightened when Miami players attended a Fiesta Bowl barbecue held days before the game dressed in fatigues. The game played out in surprising fashion. Miami's offense had little trouble moving the ball, yet the vaunted Penn State defense was able to pressure Testaverde enough (four sacks) that the Hurricanes committed a whopping seven turnovers (five interceptions, two fumbles). Miami scored first to take a 7‚Äì0 lead, but Penn State would answer with a touchdown of its own to tie it up at 7 at halftime. Miami added a field goal early in the fourth quarter to take a 10‚Äì7 lead, but momentum swung when Penn State linebacker Shane Conlan intercepted a pass from Testaverde and returned it 38 yards to the Miami 5. D.J. Dozier would then score on a six-yard run to give Penn State its first lead of the night at 14‚Äì10. The score was still 14‚Äì10 when Miami took over at its own 23 with just over 3 minutes left. Testaverde was masterful on the drive, converting a key 4th-and-six pass from Miami's own 27 to Brian Blades for a 31-yard gain and at one point completing six straight passes to take the Canes all the way down to the Penn State 6 with just 18 seconds left. But on the next play, Penn State fooled Testaverde when the Lions decided to drop eight men back in pass coverage and rushed just three. Testaverde failed to read the coverage and his pass was intercepted at the goal line by linebacker Pete Giftopoulos, sealing the upset win for Penn State. Miami dominated the game statistically, racking up 445 total yards and 22 first downs to just 162 yards and 8 first downs for Penn State. But in the end, it was Penn State that walked away with the victory‚Äîand the national championship‚Äîin this \\"Game of the Century\\". 1991 Miami (FL) vs. Florida State November 16, 1991: In a game that featured in- state rivals Florida State University and the University of Miami, ranked #1 and #2 in the nation respectively, Miami won by one point after Florida State's kicker Gerry Thomas missed a field goal wide right with 29 seconds left in the game. Because of this dramatic ending, the game became known as the \\"Wide Right\\" game. Miami would go on that season to split the national championship with Washington. 1993 Florida State vs. Notre Dame November 13, 1993: In a match-up of unbeatens, Florida State University was ranked #1, and Notre Dame was ranked #2. The winner of this game, at Notre Dame Stadium in South Bend, Indiana, was certain to play Number 3 Nebraska (which would then move up to Number 2) in the Orange Bowl for the national championship. Florida State had quarterback Charlie Ward, who would win the Heisman Trophy. Notre Dame was the underdog, but had home-field advantage. It was a game between the most-hyped program of the era and the most-hyped program in college football history, and NBC, which had exclusive rights to Fighting Irish home games (and was thus mocked by some as the \\"Notre Dame Broadcasting Company\\", much as CBS was ripped as the \\"Cowboys Broadcasting System\\" in the 1970s and 1980s), tried to market this matchup as the \\"Game of the Century.\\" There was considerable media discussion as to whether the game would live up to the hype, and, if not, how bad NBC would look. ESPN would also hype the game, showing FSU players touring the Notre Dame campus that week wearing green hats with shamrocks and gold-embroidered FSU initials on the front, and having the first on-campus edition of College GameDay from South Bend. The Peacock Network did not have to worry, because they got the classic they hoped for. The Irish appeared to be riding those mystiques the entire game, leading 31‚Äì17 as the Seminoles got the ball with 1:39 to play. But Ward drove the 'Noles down the field, and hit Kez McCorvey on 4th-and-20 for a touchdown that bounced off Irish safety Brian McGee. Notre Dame got the ball back, but went three-and-out, giving FSU one last shot. In just three plays, they got to the Irish 14 with three seconds to play. Ward rolled out and had a wide open receiver in the end zone, but did not see him, and his pass was batted down by cornerback Shawn Wooden. Notre Dame won 31‚Äì24, and a sellout crowd stormed the field. Unfortunately for the Irish, they subsequently lost to Boston College 41‚Äì39 on a last second field goal to scuttle their hoped-for Orange Bowl match-up. The Games of the 21st Century=2005 season Texas vs. USC Played on January 4, 2006 at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, California, this college football bowl game served as the BCS National Championship Game for the 2005 College Football season and was seen as the Game of the Century. It featured the only two unbeaten teams of the 2005 NCAA Division I-A football season: the defending Rose Bowl champion and reigning Big 12 Conference champion Texas Longhorns played Pacific-10 Conference titleholders and two- time defending AP national champions, the USC Trojans. The game was a back- and-forth contest; Texas's victory was not secured until the game's final 19 seconds. Vince Young, the Texas quarterback, and Michael Huff, a Texas safety, were named the offensive and defensive Rose Bowl Players Of The Game.2008 Rose Bowl Program , 2008 Rose Bowl. Retrieved January 26, 2008. ESPN named Young's fourth-down, game-winning touchdown run the fifth-highest rated play in college-football history. The game is the highest-rated BCS game in TV history with 21.7% of households watching it, and is often considered the greatest college football national championship game of all time. Texas's Rose Bowl win was the 800th victory in school history and the Longhorns ended the season ranked third in Division I history in both wins and winning percentage (.7143). It was only the third time that the two top-ranked teams had faced each other in Rose Bowl history, with the 1963 Rose Bowl and 1969 Rose Bowl games being the others. This was the final game ever called by longtime broadcaster Keith Jackson (as well as the final Rose Bowl to telecast under ABC Sports branding); the 2007 Rose Bowl would be an ESPN on ABC presentation. 2006 Michigan vs. Ohio State On November 18, 2006, Ohio State and Michigan met for their annual showdown, each carrying an 11‚Äì0 record, and billed as the Game of the Century. For the first time in the history of the rivalry, the two rivals faced off while holding the top two spots in the Bowl Championship Series rankings. Ohio State won 42‚Äì39 and became the outright Big Ten champion, earning the right to play for a national championship at the BCS National Championship Game in Glendale, Arizona. Michigan struck first blood with a touchdown run by junior running back Mike Hart, but the Buckeyes then scored 21 unanswered points, and at halftime, they were up 28‚Äì14. However, the Wolverines weren't ready to back down. Thanks to an interception and a fumble recovery by junior defensive tackle Alan Branch, Michigan cut the Buckeyes' lead to 4 with 14 minutes to go in the fourth quarter. After appearing to have forced Ohio State into a fourth down situation with six minutes to go, Michigan junior outside linebacker Shawn Crable was called for roughing the QB, giving the Buckeyes a fresh set of downs. Ohio State quarterback Troy Smith then passed to Brian Robiskie for a touchdown, increasing the Buckeyes' lead to 42‚Äì31 with five minutes left in the game. The Wolverines still had fight in them, and after Ohio State was called for pass interference on a failed 4th down attempt, giving Michigan an automatic 1st down, junior quarterback Chad Henne found senior tight end Tyler Ecker for a 16-yard touchdown with two minutes to go to cut the OSU lead to 42‚Äì37. Senior wide receiver Steve Breaston caught the two-point conversion to bring the Wolverines within a field goal. Michigan needed to recover the ensuing onside kick, and they failed to do so. The Buckeyes ran out the clock for the victory, and a trip to the BCS national championship game. Troy Smith completed 71% of his passes for 316 yards and four touchdowns, essentially clinching the Heisman trophy. Ohio State wide receiver Ted Ginn caught eight passes for 104 yards and a touchdown. Ohio State running back Antonio Pittman ran for 139 yards on 18 carries for a 7.7 yards-per-carry average. Michigan running back Mike Hart carried the ball 23 times for 142 yards and three touchdowns against a stout Buckeye defense. Chad Henne also turned in an excellent performance with 267 yards, two touchdowns, and no turnovers on a 60% completion percentage. Neither performance was, however, sufficient to turn the tide in favor of the Wolverines. The game was highly touted by ESPN/ABC (there was even a game countdown clock for a week before kickoff) and was viewed by the largest television audience for a regular season college football game since 1993, averaging 21.8 million viewers. The victory marked the first time in 43 years that the Buckeyes had won three consecutive games in the series. The game gained even more significance when, on the eve of the meeting, legendary Michigan head coach and former Ohio State assistant coach Bo Schembechler died. Schembechler was honored with a video tribute at Ohio Stadium as well as a moment of silence before kickoff. Half an hour after the game ended, the Ohio Lottery PICK 4 evening drawing was 4-2-3-9, matching the final score of the game and paying out up to $5,000 per winner, for a total payout of $2.2 million.\\"Winning Ohio lottery number: 4239\\" , Associated Press, November 19, 2006. Following the game, there was a chance of a rematch in the BCS title game, but Florida was chosen over Michigan to be Ohio State's opponent. The game's long-term significance may have been diminished after disappointing post-season results for both teams‚ÄîOhio State would lose the 2007 BCS Championship Game to Florida 41‚Äì14, while Michigan suffered their sixth Rose Bowl loss to USC, 32‚Äì18. 2011 LSU vs. Alabama On November 5, 2011, BCS-ranked #1 LSU traveled to Tuscaloosa to take on #2 Alabama. In the only \\"Game of the Century\\" to go into overtime, LSU won a close game where only field goals were scored. The final result, 9‚Äì6, was determined in the first overtime period, with a kick from Drew Alleman. Another highlight was from special teams: A Brad Wing punt that went 72 yards and sailed over hobbled Crimson Tide player Marquis Maze's head. A decisive interception at LSU's one-yard line by Eric Reid in the fourth quarter likely saved the Tigers in regulation. Alabama's kickers missed a total of four field goals in the game, including a 52-yard attempt in overtime after being sacked by Sam Montgomery previous on 3rd down. Alleman's winning field goal followed on what appeared to be a touchdown on a Michael Ford sweep, but he stepped out of bounds at the 7-yard line. This set up Alleman's game-winning field goal. As a \\"Game of the Century\\" it has been \\"roundly criticized as a dud because neither team scored a touchdown\\".Newberry, Paul No doubt about it: Bama is the best after BCS rout Associated Press, January 10, 2012 It is the lowest scoring #1 vs #2 match-up since the 1946 Army-Notre Dame game, which ended 0‚Äì0. The two teams met again in the 2012 BCS National Championship Game. This time, the Crimson Tide shut out LSU 21‚Äì0, with the Tigers not even advancing the ball out of their own half until the 3rd quarter. The 2011 Alabama/LSU contests are also remembered for the abundance of future NFL players who participated, with 45 players going on to be drafted, including 16 of the 22 defensive starters. 2019 LSU vs. Alabama U.S. President Donald Trump and First Lady Melania observe the 2019 Game of the Century at Bryant-Denny Stadium, November 9, 2019 On November 9, 2019, AP-ranked #1 (CFP-ranked #2) LSU travelled to take on AP- ranked #2 (CFP-ranked #3) Alabama in a game that was touted by some in the media as a \\"rematch\\" of the 2011 \\"Game of the Century\\". Before a crowd of 101,821 at Bryant‚ÄìDenny Stadium, including President Donald Trump and First Lady Melania Trump, LSU defeated Alabama by the score of 46‚Äì41. LSU quarterback (and future Heisman Trophy winner) Joe Burrow completed 31 of 39 passes for 393 yards and three touchdowns in the first regular-season meeting between the top two teams in the Associated Press poll since the 2011 Game of the Century matchup between the same two teams. LSU lead 33‚Äì13 at halftime, the largest deficit a Nick Saban-coached Crimson Tide team had faced after 30 minutes. Alabama quarterback Tua Tagovailoa, still recovering from ankle surgery just 20 days prior, mounted an impressive comeback in the second half. With the score 46‚Äì34 and 1:37 to play, Tagovailoa (who finished 21-for-40 for 418 yards, four touchdowns, an interception and a fumble) hit DeVonta Smith for an 85-yard touchdown pass that provided the final margin. Justin Jefferson recovered the ensuing onside kick, and LSU was able to run out the clock to win the game. Following the game, LSU moved from #2 to #1 in the College Football Playoff rankings and Coaches Poll (remaining #1 in the AP), while Alabama moved from #3 in the CFP to #5, and #2 to #4 in the AP and Coaches Polls. Alabama's subsequent loss in the Iron Bowl later that year would drop the Crimson Tide out of contention for the College Football Playoff for the first time in the history of the playoffs. LSU would go on to defeat the defending National Champion Clemson Tigers in the CFP National Championship game to cap off a perfect 15‚Äì0 season and be crowned National Champions for the first time in the CFP era. It was LSU's first time playing for the National Championship since the loss to Alabama in the 2012 BCS National Championship Game, and their first title since the 2007 season.

Her sister ships were , , , , and . Siegfried was built by the Germaniawerft shipyard between 1888 and 1890, and was armed with a main battery of three guns. She served in the German fleet throughout the 1890s and was rebuilt in 1903 - 1904. She served in the VI Battle Squadron after the outbreak of World War I in August 1914, but saw no action. Siegfried was demobilized in 1915 and used as a barracks ship thereafter. She was ultimately broken up for scrap in 1920. Design Line-drawing of Siegfried as originally configured In the late 1880s, the German Kaiserliche Marine grappled with the problem of what type of capital ship to build in the face of limited naval budgets (owing to parliamentary objections to naval spending and the cost of dredging the Kaiser Wilhelm Canal). General Leo von Caprivi, the new Chef der Admiralit√§t (Chief of the Admiralty), requested a series of design proposals, which ranged in size from small coastal defense ships to heavily-armed ocean-going battleships. Caprivi ordered ten coastal defense ships to guard the entrances to the canal, since even opponents of the navy in the Reichstag (Imperial Diet) agreed that such vessels were necessary. The first six of these, the , were based on the smallest proposal. Siegfried was long overall and had a beam of and a maximum draft of . She displaced at full combat load. Her propulsion system consisted of two vertical 3-cylinder triple-expansion engines, making her the first major German warship to be powered by triple-expansion machinery. Steam for the engines was provided by four coal-fired boilers. The ship's propulsion system provided a top speed of and a range of approximately at . Siegfried had a crew of 20 officers and 256 enlisted men. The ship was armed with three 24 cm K L/35 guns mounted in three single gun turrets. Two were placed side by side forward, and the third was located aft of the main superstructure. They were supplied with a total of 204 rounds of ammunition. The ship was also equipped with six 8.8 cm SK L/30 guns in single mounts. Siegfried also carried four torpedo tubes, all in swivel mounts on the deck. One was at the bow, another at the stern, and two amidships. The ship was protected by an armored belt that was amidships, and an armored deck that was thick. The conning tower had thick sides. Service history Siegfried in drydock in Danzig Siegfried was laid down in 1888 at the Germaniawerft shipyard in Kiel. She was launched on 10 August 1889, and completed on 19 April 1890. She was commissioned into the fleet on 29 April, and joined the I Division of the German fleet, along with the older ironclads , , and , under Vizeadmiral Karl Deinhard. The I Division participated in several fleet maneuvers in 1891, where they typically served as the German side in the war games. Siegfried did not participate in the 1892 maneuvers, having been replaced in the I Division by her recently-commissioned sister ship . Over the winter of 1892 - 1893, Siegfried and Beowulf joined the elderly ironclads and for a winter training cruise in the Mediterranean Sea. Siegfried again sat out the 1893 fleet maneuvers, instead of her sister , which had just joined the fleet. In the 1897 maneuvers, Siegfried and all five of her sister ships formed the III Division. In 1898, Siegfried again participated in the annual summer maneuvers in the III Division, along with Beowulf and . Her other three sisters were assigned to the IV Division.Notes on Naval Progress (1898), p. 107 During the 1900 summer maneuvers, Siegfried served in the simulated hostile squadron, alongside , Hildebrand, and .Notes of Naval Progress (1900), p. 416 Siegfried served on active duty until 1903, when she was withdrawn from service. Starting in 1903, she was taken into drydock at the Kaiserliche Werft shipyard in Danzig for an extensive reconstruction. The ship was lengthened to , which increased displacement to . Her old boilers were replaced with eight new Marine type boilers, and a second funnel was added. Her secondary battery was increased to ten 8.8 cm guns, and the 35 cm torpedo tubes were replaced with three tubes. Work was completed by 1904. She was brought back on active duty at the outbreak of World War I in August 1914, and mobilized into VI Battle Squadron for coastal defense, along with her sister ships and the two s. On 31 August 1915, VI Battle Squadron was demobilized, and Siegfrieds crew was transferred to other warships. She was then used as a barracks ship in Wilhelmshaven, a role she filled until the end of the war. On 17 June 1919, she was stricken from the naval register. The navy planned to convert her into a salvage ship, but the plan was abandoned and she was instead sold for 425,000 marks to H. Peters in Wewelsfleth. Siegfried was broken up for scrap the following year in Kiel-Nordmole.

Biography  Kininmonth was born in Forfar, Angus. He was educated at Dunfermline High School and later, George Watson's College in Edinburgh. His first architectural training was with William Thomson of Leith, where he was articled. From 1925-1929 he also attended classes at Edinburgh College of Art under John Begg, where he first met Basil Spence, then a fellow student. With Spence, Kininmonth spent a year as an assistant in the office of Sir Edwin Lutyens in London, working on designs for the Viceroy's House in New Delhi, and attending evening classes at The Bartlett under Albert Richardson. Returning to Edinburgh, Kininmonth took a teaching post at Edinburgh College of Art, becoming a senior lecturer in 1939. In 1931, Kininmonth set up in practice with Basil Spence, working from a single room in the office of Rowand Anderson & Paul in Edinburgh. Kininmonth & Spence executed several commissions for private houses in Edinburgh, including the former's own modernist house at 46a Dick Place, The Grange (1933). In 1934 Kininmonth and Spence was merged with the Rowand Anderson practice, forming Rowand Anderson & Paul & Partners. When Arthur Balfour Paul died in 1938, Kininmonth and Spence became sole partners. In 1942 he was called up for military service, and served with the Royal Engineers in North Africa and Italy. After the war, Basil Spence set up his own practice, while Kininmonth continued the renamed Rowand Anderson Kininmonth & Paul. Kininmonth was knighted in 1972, and awarded an honorary degree by the University of Dundee in 1975. During his apprenticeship Kininmonth lived in a house of his own design: 46a Dick Place, The Grange, Edinburgh. He was married to the artist Caroline Kininmonth.

The events occur on the date that new apprentices are introduced to the Company of Marblers and Stonecutters of Purbeck. The freemen gather in the Fox Inn West Street where they wait till Corfe Church chimes at twelve noon, where they make their way into the Town Hall, which is reputedly the smallest town hall in the country. Any apprentices wishing to be admitted into the order wait in the Fox Inn. In the town hall names of attendance are taken, apologies are made on behalf of the absent, the minutes of the last annual general meeting are read and any new apprentices wishing to become freemen of the order, that fit the necessary criteria, are nominated and seconded, after which a vote is taken to decide if each of the applicants are accepted. From the Fox Inn, the successful apprentices are called to the Town Hall with a quart of beer and a penny loaf to pay their \\"dues\\", then successful applicants are welcomed as freemen of the order, after which a closed ceremony is held for the company.

Widukind, proud of his people and history, begins his chronicon, not with Rome, but with a brief synopsis derived from the orally-transmitted history of the Saxons, with a terseness that makes his work difficult to interpret. Widukind omits Italian events in tracing the career of Henry the Fowler and he never mentioned a pope. Manuscripts Widukind's Gesta is known from five manuscripts, one of which came to light at the beginning of the twentieth century. The contexts and dates of the various versions which these represent have occasioned much discussion. The work was first completed in 967 or 968, when it was dedicated to Mathilda, the young daughter of Otto I and newly appointed abbess of Quedlinburg. However, in four of five manuscripts, the history was continued down to 973 (adding chapters 70-6 of Book III), whether by Widukind himself or another author. Since its composition must have been a long process, it is likely that the dedication was not originally part of Widukind's design and that he consequently had to make a number of adjustments to suit other needs. Three main recensions called A, B and C have been distinguished: * Recension A. Ends at Book III, chapter 69, year 967/9. ** MS A. MS J 38 (S√§chsischen Landesbibliothek, Dresden). Date: 1200 x 1220. * Recension B (continues until 973) ** MS B 1.

Donated to the library in 1909 and before that time unknown to scholarship. Volumes Res gestae saxonicae sive annalium libri tres consists of three volumes: First Widukind of Corvey starts book one with the fall of the Germanic Thuringian dynasty. In his version, Amalaberga is the daughter of the Frankish king Huga. After Huga's death Thiadrich, his son by a concubine is crowned as king, but Amalaberga convinces her husband, Irminfrid, with the help of the warrior Iring, that it is really she who should inherit the kingdom. A war starts, and after the Franks under Thiadrich have won a battle at Runibergun, the Thuringii retreat into the fortress of Scithingi (modern Burgscheidungen). The Franks get the help of the newly immigrated Saxons who are looking for land, and a bloody battle is fought at Scithingi. After many warriors have been slain, Irminfrid sends Iring as a messenger to Thiadrich to ask for peace. The kings reach an agreement and plan to slay the Saxons on the morrow, but the Saxons get word of this, storm Scithingi during the night and kill all adults. Only Irminfrid and his family escape. The Saxons celebrate their victory for three days, afterwards they return to Thiadrich, who gives the country over to them. By the order of Thiadrich, Iring convinces Irminfrid to return to the Frankish court. When Irminfrid kneels in submission before Thiadrich, Iring slays him. Thiadrich banishes him, as he has become despicable to all men by this deed, and he wants to have no part of this crime. Iring announces that he will atone for his crime and get revenge for his former master and slays Thiadrich as well. He places the body of Irminfrid over that of Thiadrich, so he will be victor in death at least, and leaves. Widukind ends by doubting the truth of this story, but recounts that the Milky Way is called \\"Iring's Street\\" to his day. An allusion to the conversion of the Saxons to Christianity under Charlemagne brings him to the early Saxon dukes and details of the reign of Henry the Fowler. Second The second book opens with the election of Otto the Great as German king, treats of the risings against his authority, omitting events in Italy, and concludes with the death of his wife Edith in 946. He dedicates his writings to Matilda, daughter of Otto and abbess of Quedlinburg, a descendant of the Saxon leader Widukind, his own namesake. Third Book three tells the story of Liudolf, Duke of Swabia and Otto's Franconian campaign. Style Widukind's style reflects his familiarity with the De vita Caesarum of Suetonius, the Vita Karoli Magni of Einhard, and probably with Livy and Bede. Many quotations from the Vulgate are found in his writings, and there are traces of a knowledge of Virgil, Ovid and other Roman poets. The earlier part of his work is taken from tradition, but he wrote the contemporary part as one familiar with court life and the events of the day.

The law limited naturalization to \\"free white person[s] ... of good character\\", thus excluding Native Americans, indentured servants, slaves, free blacks and later Asians, although free blacks were allowed citizenship at the state level in a number of states. The Act was modelled on the Plantation Act 1740 with respect to time, oath of allegiance, process of swearing before a judge, etc.Michael Lemay, Elliott Robert Barkan, U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Laws and Issues: A Documentary History, pp 6-9. (1999) Retrieved 2014-03-29 Historical Timeline, History of Legal and Illegal Immigration to the United States, 1607-1799 Provisions There was a two year residency requirement in the United States and one year in the state of residence before an alien would apply for citizenship, by filing a Petition for Naturalization with \\"any common law court of record\\" having jurisdiction over his residence. Once convinced of the applicant's ‚Äúgood character‚Äù, the court would administer an oath of allegiance to support the Constitution of the United States. The applicant‚Äôs children to age of 21 would also be naturalized. The clerk of the court was to make a record of these proceedings, and \\"thereupon such person shall be considered as a citizen of the United States.\\" The Act also provided that children born abroad when both parents are U.S. citizens \\"shall be considered as natural born citizens,\\" but specified that the right of citizenship did \\"not descend to persons whose fathers have never been resident in the United States.\\"Bad news for Ted Cruz: his eligibility for president is going to court. Dara Lind and Jeff Stein. Vox Media. 18 February 2016. Retrieved 20 February 2016. This act was the only US statute to ever to use the term \\"natural born citizen\\", found in the US Constitution in relation to the prerequisites for a person to serve as President or Vice-President, and the term was removed by the Naturalization Act of 1795. Though the Act did not specifically preclude women from citizenship, the common law practice of coverture had been absorbed into the legal system of the United States. Under this practice the physical body of married woman, thus any rights to her person or property, was controlled by her husband. A woman's loyalty to her husband was considered above her obligation to the state. Jurisprudence on domestic relations held, that infants, slaves, and women should be excluded from participation in public life and conducting business, because they lacked discernment, the right to free will and property, and there was a need to prevent moral depravity and conflicts of loyalty. Afterwards The Naturalization Act of 1795 repealed and superseded the 1790 Act. The 1795 Act extended the residence requirement to five years, and added a requirement that a prospective applicant needed to give notice of application of three years. The Naturalization Act of 1798 extended the residency requirement to 14 years and notice period to five years. The 1798 Act was repealed by the Naturalization Law of 1802, restoring the residency and notice requirements of the 1795 Act. From the adoption of the Naturalization Law of 1804, women's access to citizenship was increasingly tied to their state of marriage. By the end of the nineteenth century, the overriding consideration to determine women's citizenship or ability to naturalize was her marital status. From 1907, a women's nationality was entirely dependent on whether or not she was married. The Treaty of Dancing Rabbit Creek, which was ratified by the US Congress in 1831, allowed those Choctaw Indians who chose to remain in Mississippi to gain recognition as US citizens, the first major non-European ethnic group to become entitled to US citizenship. Major changes in citizenship rules were made in the 19th century following the American Civil War. The Fourteenth Amendment in 1868 granted citizenship to people born within the United States and subject to its jurisdiction, irrespective of race, but it excluded untaxed ‚ÄúIndians‚Äù (Native Americans living on reservations). The Naturalization Act of 1870 extended \\"the naturalization laws\\" to \\"aliens of African nativity and to persons of African descent\\" while also revoking the citizenship of naturalized Chinese Americans. By virtue of the Fourteenth Amendment and despite the 1870 Act, the Supreme Court in United States v. Wong Kim Ark (1898) recognised U.S. birthright citizenship of an American-born child of Chinese parents who had a permanent domicile and residence in the United States, and who were there carrying on business, and were not employed in any diplomatic or official capacity under the Emperor of China. United States v. Wong Kim Ark, 169 U.S. 649 (1898). U.S. citizenship of persons born in the United States since Wong Kim Ark have been recognised, although the Supreme Court has never directly made a ruling in relation to children born to parents who are not legal residents in the United States. Native Americans were granted citizenship in a piece-meal manner until the Indian Citizenship Act of 1924, which granted them blanket citizenship whether they belonged to a federally recognized tribe or not, though by that date two-thirds of Native Americans had already become US citizens by other means. The Act was not retroactive, so that it did not cover citizens born before the effective date of the 1924 act, or outside of the United States as an indigenous person. Further changes to racial eligibility for citizenship by naturalization were made after 1940, when eligibility was extended to \\"descendants of races indigenous to the Western Hemisphere,\\" \\"Filipino persons or persons of Filipino descent,\\" \\"Chinese persons or persons of Chinese descent,\\" and \\"persons of races indigenous to India.\\" The Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 prohibits racial and gender discrimination in naturalization.

He was the author of a number of books regarding the flora of Norway. Today he is most associated with his role in developing the Blytt-Sernander theory of climatic change. Biography Blytt was born in Kristiania (now Oslo), Norway. He was the son of Matthias Numsen Blytt (1789‚Äì1862) and Ambrosia Henriksen (1822‚Äì1900). His father was a noted professor of botany at The Royal Frederick University (now University of Oslo). He graduated Examen artium from Royal Frederick University in 1860. After the death of his father in 1862, he continued his father's work with Norwegian flora. Axel Blytt served with the Christiania Herbarium at the University of Oslo from 1865, first as a conservator, then from 1880 as a professor. In 1869, he was awarded the Crown Prince's gold medal (Kronprinsens gullmedalje). Based partly on his father's work, he published Norges Flora in two volumes during 1874 and 1876. His work, Essay on the Immigration of Norwegian Flora (1876) was read by and influenced Charles Darwin. He died in Oslo during 1898. His work Haandbog i Norges flora was completed and published posthumously by botanist Ove Dahl during 1906. Legacy Blyttberget, a high crag southeast of Nordlaguna on the Norwegian island of Jan Mayen, is named for him.Orvin, A.K. (1960) The Place-Names of Jan Mayen. Skrifter. Norsk Polarinstitutt. Number 120. pp. 14. The German botanist Wilhelm Schimper named several mosses after him as well. The remaining existent specimens Blytt collected on his studies are held at the Botanical Museum of the University of Oslo. The Buffalo Museum of Science in Buffalo, New York also holds a collection of specimens attributed to a collector identified as \\"Blytt\\", who is likely Axel Blytt. This is evidenced by Charles Peck, the New York State Botanist from 1883 to 1913, in his 1872 Report of the Botanist to the New York Senate.Peck, Charles William. (1872) Report of the Botanist. 25th Annual Report on the State Museum of Natural History. New York Senate document No. 83. Peck wrote that he had received 22 specimens of lichens from the University of Norway, Christiana (Oslo), Norway, for the New York State Cabinet. There is also a mention of Blytt in correspondence between the Swiss botanist Leo Lesquereux and George William Clinton, then President of the Buffalo Museum of Natural Sciences, regarding specimens and a visit to the Buffalo Museum by Lesquereux. Though the existing correspondence only provides Lesquereux's letters, he refers to Blytt as \\"a good Norwegian Botanist I do not know his address in any other way than as you write it.

It posits an international feminist conspiracy to depose the ruling American patriarchy with a feminist matriarchy. To achieve and establish this plan, they kidnap and replace the U.S. President, discredit the head of the Z.O.W.I.E. intelligence agency, and commandeer a nuclear-armed space platform, all directed from Fabulous Face, a women's beauty farm in the Virgin Islands. Circumstances compel ex-secret agent Derek Flint to help his ex-boss, and so uncover the conspiracy. James Coburn and Lee J. Cobb reprise their roles as Derek Flint and spy chief Lloyd C. Cramden, Flint's ex-boss, respectively. Jerry Goldsmith, who wrote the score for Our Man Flint, also returns. The ad campaign features poster artwork by Bob Peak. The title is a play on the phrase \\"in like Flynn.\\" This film and Caprice with Doris Day were the last films made in CinemaScope, with Fox and other studios moving to Panavision and other widescreen processes. Plot After observing the launch of a new space platform, Z.O.W.I.E. Chief Lloyd C. Cramden joins President Trent for a game of golf. Their game is interrupted by a small group, two women disguised as boys and an actor disguised as an old man, all from the Fabulous Face organization. Substituting the presidential golf ball with a small gas bomb, they succeed in temporarily immobilizing the presidential party and replacing the president with the now-undisguised actor, who has been surgically altered to look exactly like him. The Fabulous Face organization plans to gain control of the world and run it entirely by a group of women led by Elisabeth; Cramden has inadvertently stumbled upon this world- domination plot. The women want to establish a matriarchy, and the first step in their plan is to gain control of a US space facility in the Virgin Islands. Elisabeth has established the spa there as a cover. The women establish their headquarters near the rocket base to brainwash their male-oriented sisters by planting tape recorders in their hair dryers. Puzzled by an apparent three- minute time discrepancy - revealed by a perusal of a stopwatch that was active during the switch - Cramden visits the former super agent Derek Flint at his New York City home. Greeted by Flints' three female live-in companions in the living room of Flint's spacious Manhattan apartment, Cramden is informed that Flint is experimenting with the creation of a dolphin language dictionary. Flint tells Cramden these undersea mammals are intelligent creatures and that they use sounds or sonics to communicate, a notion that had been only relatively recently reinforced by scientific experimentation at the time the film was produced. Flint then shows Cramden a sonic device of his own invention that is integrated into a cigarette lighter (and that, amongst many other uses mentioned - 82 are claimed for the gadget - is later revealed to service as a belt buckle), first moving and then shattering a white cue ball on the pool table. Cramden requests that Flint investigate the \\"lost\\" three minutes recorded by the stopwatch. Flint agrees to take up the matter after his return from a survival exercise in the Mojave Desert. During their meeting, Lisa Norton, an operative of Fabulous Face, is meeting with Flint's three live-in girl friends, where she tricks the girls into accepting a free visit to the Fabulous Face Spa in the Virgin Islands. That evening Cramden encounters Norton, whom Fabulous Face has re-tasked to deal with his unexpected interference with their plans, at an Italian restaurant. Disguised as a southern schoolteacher visiting the city, she drugs him using cigarettes treated with a soporific substance and stages a compromising scene with a prostitute at a hotel; the scene is then photographed and published under the auspices of General Carter, who is working with Fabulous Face. With Cramden framed as a libertine, the \\"imposter\\" President publicly suspends the disgraced spy chief from active duty. Recalled from his exercise, Derek Flint hypnotizes Cramden with his watch, which incorporates lights specifically designed for such a purpose, and learns the details of the encounter with Lisa. Tests of trimmings from Cramden's mustache (secured through the use of the ubiquitous, multi-talented cigarette lighter) reveal traces of \\"euphoric acid\\", a drug that when mixed with alcohol leaves the subject mildly sedated and aroused. Investigating further, Flint breaks into Z.O.W.I.E. headquarters and discovers that the two astronauts on the recently launched space platform are, in fact, Russian female cosmonauts. Flint is interrupted by General Carter and a force of turncoat guards who, after a struggle, believe they have killed Flint when he apparently falls into a document incinerator. Having actually escaped his supposed demise, Flint travels to the Soviet Union to investigate the cosmonaut connection. Dancing in the Bolshoi ballet, he makes contact with ballerina Natasha, unaware that she is a Fabulous Face operative until she attempts to drug him with soporific cigarettes, as Lisa Norton had done to Lloyd Cramden in New York. Flint manages to foil Natasha's designs, but his subsequent interrogation of her is interrupted by the KGB, who arrive at her apartment intending to bring Flint to the Soviet Premier. Flint escapes their clutches and leads the KGB agents in a chase across the roof, tricking one agent to looking over the ledge by imitating a pigeon (making cooing noises), then reaching up from his precarious perch beneath the building's eaves and pulling the man to his death. Flint, hopping atop roof again, evades the other agent and manages to propel a grappling hook, shot from his multi- purposed cigarette lighter, onto another nearby roof and, walking along the line he's secured at his end, crosses over and escapes into a lower vent hatch. Flint next sneaks into the Kremlin, where he overhears the Premier bluffing the (fake) U.S. President; conversational clues point Flint to the Fabulous Face spa in the Virgin Islands. Cramden has also traveled to the Fabulous Face Spa to investigate further but he is captured and imprisoned with the real President. The Fabulous Face staff, in anticipation of Flint coming to the spa, have imprisoned his girl friends in cryogenic freezing chambers. Flint boards an Aeroflot flight for Cuba disguised as a bearded Cuban Revolutionary. An amusing scene ensues on the Russian airliner which pokes tongue-in-cheek fun at the idea of how an airline would be run in the Caribbean \\"socialist paradise\\". Distracting the other passengers, he ties up the pilots, parachutes out over the Virgin Islands, and swims to the Fabulous Face complex (with minor help from a wild dolphin). There, he is intercepted by Lisa Norton, who brings him before the Fabulous Face leadership, a group of female business executives who explain their plan to brainwash women (through the use of subliminal messages transmitted by salon hairdryers, as revealed in the film's opening scenes) into overthrowing the male-dominated political order. As Flint attempts to talk the women out of their plan, he is interrupted by General Carter, who is dissatisfied with his subordinate role in the women's plot and plans to take power himself with the aid of the fake president. After a fight, Flint is captured by Carter's men and placed, along with Cramden, the captive U. S. President, and the Fabulous Face leadership with their lead staff, into cryogenic suspension. Derek Flint escapes his freezing chamber, where he has been imprisoned with the lovely Miss Norton, with the sonic wave amplifier device he demonstrated to Cramden in his New York apartment. Subsequently, Flint decides to join sides with the women in stopping Carter's plan to atomically arm the space station. Flint, Cramden, the real President Trent, and the women of Fabulous Face travel to the nearby base where the launch is scheduled to take place. Once they arrive, the women execute \\"Operation Smooch\\", using their beauty and sexual allure to distract, seduce, and subdue the male guards. After the women thereby succeed in taking over the control room, Carter (who is on board the rocket) threatens to activate the atomic warheads under his control unless he is allowed to proceed with the launch. Flint manages to board the capsule just before it takes off; once in orbit he and Carter fight in zero gravity, causing the spacecraft to tumble. After overpowering Carter, Flint escapes the capsule, which is then destroyed with a nuclear missile launched from the surface. Using his wave amplifier, Flint floats to the nearby space platform, where he enjoys the hospitality of the resident female cosmonauts while awaiting return to Earth. Cast Bill Lear credited as W. P. Lear Sr.makes a cameo appearance as himself. Critical reaction In Like Flint received mixed reviews when released in 1967; a New York Times critic said: \\"Although the film crawls with dime-store beauties, there is a noticeable lack of sexiness in it. Women bent on being tyrants evidently haven't much time for anything else\\". Roger Ebert had similar criticisms: \\"The sexiest thing in the new Derek Flint misadventure, In Like Flint, is Flint's cigarette lighter, which is supposed to know eighty-two tricks, but actually delivers only five, of which, one is the not extraordinary ability to clip Lee J. Cobb's moustache\\". Production Coburn later said Gordon Douglas \\"really didn‚Äôt direct the film\\" saying \\"Buzz Henry (Coburn‚Äôs stunt double), the director of photography (William H. Daniels) and myself were really responsible for the Film. But that was the fun of it. Gordon Douglas was ill or had a heart problem or some damn thing. Anyway, he would come on the set and say what we were doing was wonderful and so on. Then he would often leave the set Still it was fun. We had a great group of team players... the studio (Fox) really didn‚Äôt support us with that concept. The script was also never finished. We actually started shooting without an ending to the film. The ending was tagged on the picture. Saul was working on a different ending, but the studio just wanted us to finish the film so they could release it We had to shoot fast. We also had a pretty good budget. Most of the young women in the sequel were girlfriends of the execs working at the studio. It was playtime for those guys (laughs)‚Äù...The studio was very surprised by the success of the sequel. We said we might do more Hint films if the scripts were really good and if they hired top directors. Although Fox wanted us to do more Flint films, it just never worked out. They just didn‚Äôt seem to care about quality anymore.‚Äù Reception The film earned $5 million in rentals in North America in 1967.\\"Big Rental Films of 1967\\", Variety, 3 January 1968 p 25. Please note these figures refer to rentals accruing to the distributors. According to Fox records, the film needed to earn $6,975,000 in rentals to break even and made $9,125,000, meaning it made a profit. In popular culture In the movie Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me, the main character Austin Powers (while being on honeymoon with his new wife Vanessa Kensington) switches on the TV to a scene from In Like Flint. He mentions to Vanessa that it is his favorite movie. The phone in Austin's car has the same ringtone (but reversed) as the Z.O.W.I.E. telephone in the beginning of this film.

She worked for World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) as the manager of former Tag Team Champions, Deuce 'n Domino, and as a performer for its SmackDown brand. After becoming interested in wrestling, Drew worked on the independent circuit under the ring names Miss Kara and Kara Slice. She was assigned to WWE's developmental territory Ohio Valley Wrestling (OVW) in Louisville, Kentucky in 2005, to continue her wrestling training. While situated at OVW, she used the name Cherry Pie, and she was the manager of the group known as \\"The Throw- Backs\\" and later as \\"The Untouchables\\", consisting of Deuce Shade and Dice Domino. Cherry managed them to three reigns as OVW Southern Tag Team Champions. After signing with WWE, the group were called up to the SmackDown! roster in January 2007, where the team underwent a name change to Deuce 'n Domino. Cherry managed the team to one reign as WWE Tag Team Champions. In April 2008 she made her WWE singles debut and parted ways with Deuce and Domino the following month. She continued working in singles and tag team competition, before being released from her WWE contract in August 2008. Professional wrestling career=Early career (1999‚Äì2005) Drew grew up in Morristown, New Jersey. She became a fan of professional wrestling after watching the first WrestleMania event in 1985. Her favorite wrestlers included Miss Elizabeth and Macho Man Randy Savage. Drew never thought she would get the opportunity to become a professional wrestler, but one of her co-workers was related to the founder and promoter of Stars and Stripes Championship Wrestling based in Nutley, New Jersey, where she debuted under the ring name Miss Kara. She was invited to attend Independent Wrestling Federation (IWF) shows by Kevin Knight and received an \\"up close and personal\\" look from a \\"behind the scenes\\" perspective. In January 1999, Drew began working as a manager in IWF. She worked as a manager and an occasional wrestler in various federations on the East Coast, including East Coast Pro Wrestling (ECPW), the National Wrestling Alliance in New Jersey, ISPW, State-Side Championship Wrestling and Northeast Wrestling. In 2002, she worked for National Wrestling Superstars, and later with Phoenix Championship Wrestling, where she feuded with Alexis Laree. By 2003, she was working primarily as a singles competitor. She wrestled in various independent promotions until September 2005. The same year, Drew started wrestling for Ohio Valley Wrestling (OVW), the developmental territory for World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE), and relocated to Louisville, Kentucky. World Wrestling EntertainmentOhio Valley Wrestling (2005‚Äì2007)= In late 2005, Drew began working for OVW. She eventually signed a developmental contract with WWE in January 2006. Drew used the ring name \\"Cherry Pie\\" and was the manager of the tag team The Throw- Backs, comprising Deuce Shade and Dice Domino, the latter of whom was her storyline brother, in OVW. She became part of their 1950s in-ring persona, wearing poodle skirts and roller skates and chewing gum at all times. In mid-2006, during their time together, the team underwent an image change, including changing their name to \\"The Untouchables\\" and dropping Pie, Dice, and Shade from their respective names. In late 2006, the team of Shawn Spears and Cody Runnels defeated The Untouchables in a tag team match and won the services of Cherry. Cherry accompanied Spears and Runnels to ringside, and soon Spears began to have a crush on her, which began interfering in their matches. Cherry betrayed Spears and Runnels, however, and helped Deuce and Domino win the OVW Southern Tag Team Championship. In January 2007, Cherry twice challenged Katie Lea for the OVW Women's Championship unsuccessfully. =SmackDown! (2007‚Äì2008)= Cherry during a house show in February 2007 For their first match with WWE, where they debuted on the SmackDown! brand, the team underwent a name change to \\"Deuce 'n Domino\\". They debuted on the January 19, 2007, episode, where she managed Deuce 'n Domino in a tag team match, which Deuce 'n Domino won. During this time that Cherry was rarely physically involved in their matches. On the April 20 episode of SmackDown!, Cherry was in the corner of Deuce 'n Domino when they won the WWE Tag Team Championship by defeating Paul London and Brian Kendrick. On the October 12 episode of SmackDown!, in a backstage segment, Jamie Noble revealed to Deuce and Domino that he had heard Jimmy Wang Yang making suggestive comments about Cherry. Later that episode, Yang defeated Deuce in a singles match. After the match, however, Deuce 'n Domino double-teamed him, and Cherry slapped Yang. This later developed into a feud between Deuce and Domino, and Yang and his partner, Shannon Moore. At the beginning of 2008, the team suffered a series of losses. On the March 7, 2008, episode of SmackDown, Cherry competed in a Swimsuit Contest, along Maryse, Victoria, Eve Torres, and Michelle McCool. On the March 28 episode of SmackDown, Cherry transformed into a fan favorite by teaming with McCool to defeat Victoria and Maryse. She made her WWE singles match debut defeating Victoria with a roll-up, following a distraction from McCool, on the April 18 episode of SmackDown. On April 27, at the Backlash pay-per-view, Cherry made her pay-per-view debut in a 12-Diva tag team match, which her team lost. In a video posted to WWE's official website, she was dumped by Deuce and Domino for Maryse when they announced that they wanted nothing more to do with her after her unannounced departure from them. Maryse proceeded to provoke Cherry after their announcement, only to get slapped for her troubles. She went on to pick up a singles victory over Maryse. Cherry then went on into a minor feud with Natalya, who debuted with a win over Cherry via the Sharpshooter, a submission move. Over the following weeks, Natalya continued to defeat Cherry, including at Vickie Guerrero's wedding. As a condition of catching Guererro's bouquet, Cherry won a match against Guerrero, but first had to face Natalya, who defeated her with the Sharpshooter. Following this loss, Guererro immediately had a match with Cherry, quickly pinning her for the victory. Cherry was released from her WWE contract on August 15, 2008.

Atherton received a classical education. He was tutored in the classics by the inventor Samuel Abbot, and went on to study law under the tutelage of his father, a former Federalist politician and one of the most distinguished attorneys in the state. He graduated from Harvard University in 1822 where he studied law. After graduation, He was admitted to the bar in 1825 and commenced practice in Dunstable, New Hampshire (now Nashua). Career= Early career  Atherton was a States-rights Democrat from a northern state of New England. He engaged early on in politics and identified himself with the Democratic Party, which he remained loyal to all his life. He and his father were opposed in politics: his father taking the same position as Abraham Lincoln that as a free country, no extension of slavery should be tolerated. Atherton was elected at the age of 26, as a member of the State House of Representatives in 1830. He was Speaker of the House from 1833 to 1835.  U.S House  Atherton is best known for his staunch stance on states-rights issues. He was elected as a Democrat to the Twenty-fifth United States Congress and the two succeeding Congresses (March 4th, 1837 ‚Äì March 3rd, 1843) and did not seek reelection in 1842, having become a candidate for Senator. His circle of friends included Congressman Jonathan Cilley, who died in a duel in Bladensburg, Maryland in February 1838. Atherton wore a crape (a black band worn on his sleeve) for thirty days in his memory. Atherton was appointed to a committee by President Martin Van Buren to investigate the causes which led to his death. One of the committee's recommendations resulted in a law signed by President Van Buren on February 20, 1839 prohibiting the giving or accepting of challenges to duel within the District of Columbia. =Atherton Gag= He was responsible for composing the gag rule in 1838, known as the \\"Atherton Gag\\", which stifled any petitions relating to bringing an end to slavery. A curious position for the grandson of Joshua Atherton who, so many years earlier had been ready to oppose the Ratification of the Federal Constitution because of its acknowledgment of slavery. From that moment he became known as Gag Law Atherton. During his first term in Congress in 1838 he presented five resolutions which were adopted, and which created a new resolution that barred Congress from discussing petitions which mentioned bringing slavery to an end. He presented his five resolutions on December 11th, 1838. Congress approved them on December 12th, 1838. Several similar resolutions and eventually a standing House rule were approved by Congress from 1835 to 1840, but the \\"Atherton Gag\\" was the only one of them to be named after its creator. Of the five resolutions, the last one is most indicative of his desires since it contains the vital stipulations. Atherton wrote: > 5\\\\. Resolved, therefore, That all attempts, on the part of Congress, to > abolish slavery in the District of Columbia or the Territories, or to > prohibit the removal of slaves from State to State, or to discriminate > between the institutions of one portion of the country and another, with the > views aforesaid, are in violation of the constitution, destructive of the > fundamental principles on which the Union of these States rests, and beyond > the jurisdiction of Congress; and that every petition, memorial, resolution, > proposition, or paper, touching or relating in any way or to any extent > whatever to slavery, as aforesaid, or the abolition thereof, shall, on the > presentation thereof, without any further action thereon, be laid on the > table without being debated, printed, or referred. Atherton was responsible for composing the gag rule of December 1838, which stifled any petitions relating to slavery. The previous year abolitionists mainly from northern states sent thousands of petitions to Congress for the abolition of slavery. John Greenleaf Whittier, poet and advocate of the abolition of slavery in the United States referred to him as vile and shifty and wrote poems making reference to both Atherton and the gag, which frustrated Whittier and all the other abolitionists, as it curtailed any open debate in Congress on the subject. Atherton delivered a speech on the twelve million loan bill in the House of Representatives, on Monday, July 12, 1841. During the third session of the twenty-fifth United States Congress, Atherton lodged with a Mrs S.A. Hill in Alexandria, Virginia which was almost opposite to the Gadsby's Tavern, which housed ten representatives, all from pro-slavery states, who would have looked for any opportunity to lobby their cause. The gag rule was deeply controversial as it curtailed progressive debate and was extremely unpopular in northern states and frustrated the abolitionists cause; however it still won enough votes in Congress; and this rule remained in place for over 8 years, due to heavy pressure and lobbying from Southern pro-slavery states. It was not until 1844 the House rescinded this gag rule on a motion made by John Quincy Adams. A brave act rescind and recommence debate, however this polarisation proved to be one of the building blocks taking the country towards breaking point and civil war. In 1844, the House rescinded this gag rule on a motion made by John Quincy Adams. Whatever his reasons, Joshua Atherton, as an early ardent anti-slavery campaigner would have objected to this rule  United States Senate  After winning his election bid, Atherton was elected to the United States Senate as a Democrat in 1843, and served from March 4th, 1843, to March 3rd, 1849. While in the Senate, Atherton served as Chairman of the Committee on Printing (Twenty-ninth Congress), the Committee on Roads and Canals (Twenty-ninth United States Congress), and the Committee on Finance (Thirtieth United States Congress). Atherton and Samuel S. Phelps were the only New England Democratic and Whig Senators, respectively, to vote in favor of the Clayton Compromise bill. He remained active politically for the Democratic Party, even when not serving in office. As an example of his political influence, a regional newspaper, ‚ÄúThe Boston Pilot‚Äù of August 28th 1852 reported: ‚ÄúAt the Democratic Barbecue in Hillsborough, the Hon. Charles G Atherton presided. Spirited speeches were made by Col. Savage of Tennessee, John Van Buren of New York, Senator J B Weller of California, Maj. Stevens of the U.S Army, Senator Clemens, of Alabama, Gen. Dix, of New York, Mr Gorman, of Indiana, Capt. Rynders, and others. The same gentlemen addressed the Democratic Meeting in Faneuil Hall on Friday night, which was kept up until after midnight. It was a spirited affair; and the speakers were all in good tune.‚Äù After serving out his term Atherton was not then re-elected, resuming the practice of law in Nashua. However in November 1852, he was chosen to take the seat left vacant by John P. Hale and returned to the Senate after he took the oath of office for the term beginning March 4th, 1853. Atherton was in the inner circle of Franklin Pierce, at the time he was elected as the 14th President in 1853. Atherton was known to be a heavy whiskey drinker, and he did not attend the Presidential Inauguration of Franklin Pierce, most likely for health reasons, since he had traveled nationwide, campaigning heavily for Franklin Pierce to report first hand on his virtues, his sobriety, his affinity for immigrants, and his valor on the field of battle.  Personal life  He married Ann (Nancy) Barnard Clark, a granddaughter of the Reverend Jeremiah Barnard, Minister for Amherst in 1828. Atherton was a close friend to the Nathaniel Hawthorne. He had also been a close friend and ally of President Franklin Pierce, who had anticipated making him his spokesman in the Senate at the start of his presidency, however Atherton died unexpectedly.\\\\- refers to a power vacuum with the loss of Atherton \\\\- reference made to the loss of his ally in the Senate Death Atherton died suddenly from pulmonary tuberculosis in Manchester, New Hampshire, on November 15, 1853. He was buried in Nashua Cemetery, New Hampshire. To mark the occasion of his death, as a Senator from the State of New Hampshire, an obituary was delivered in the United States Senate and in the House of Representatives, December 19th, 1853.

He was raised in a family that values art and culture, where he developed an early love of drawing and music. This exposure and encouragement sustained him during his years in grade school during the time when Crow students were denied association with their language and cultural heritage. Later, when he was one of 150 students chosen to attend the newly established Institute of American Indian Arts in Santa Fe, New Mexico, he was encouraged to explore his history and culture through modern art techniques. Upon graduation, Red Star and several other Native students received scholarships to the San Francisco Art Institute. Here he was exposed to the avant garde and political and social concerns of post-modern art. Since embarking on his professional artistic journey, the acknowledged master artist is considered a visual historian and ambassador for his Native Crow culture. In 1997, Kevin Red Star received an Honorary Doctorate Degree in Fine Art from the Rocky Mountain College in Billings, Montana. Kevin Red Star has been accepted into the Russell Skull Society for the Charlie Russell Auction March 2014, an exhibition and sale to benefit the C.M. Russell Museum.

The term \\"house officer\\" is still used to refer to foundation doctors (in Foundation Years 1 and 2 known as FY1s and FY2s). Newly qualified doctors are only allowed provisional registration with the General Medical Council, hence their first jobs are prior to full registration with the GMC and these jobs were named pre-registration house officer jobs, usually consisting of two six-month jobs; one predominantly involved with general surgery (often being called a house surgeon), and one predominantly involved with general medicine (often being called a house physician). After 1948, PRHO was the lowest grade in the medical hierarchy of qualified doctors in the National Health Service, and was the doctor most often called by nursing staff to see patients on hospital wards, especially at the most unsocial hours of work shifts. After satisfactory work reports in both house jobs, the PRHO gained full registration with the General Medical Council, which is a legal requirement to be able to work in all other medical jobs in the United Kingdom (which until 1922 included the whole of Ireland). Although the PRHO year was taken after graduating from a medical school, the supervision of the PRHO was the responsibility of the medical school from which the PRHO had graduated, and a representative of that medical school was responsible for signing the registration forms which go to the General Medical Council to certify that the PRHO year had been completed satisfactorily. After completing the PRHO year, the junior doctors usually became Senior house officers to further their career in the medical profession. Following changes in postgraduate medical education, from 2005, what was the PRHO year now forms the first year of Foundation Training (Foundation Year 1), and trainees during this year now have the job title of Foundation House Officer 1 instead of PRHO. Despite this, they are still often referred to as House Officers by themselves and other hospital staff. In other parts of the world, this stage is generally referred to as medical internship.

The formation stretches over portions of Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota, and Wyoming. In Montana, the Hell Creek Formation overlies the Fox Hills Formation. The site of Pompeys Pillar National Monument is a small isolated section of the Hell Creek Formation. In 1966, the Hell Creek Fossil Area was designated as a National Natural Landmark by the National Park Service. It is a series of fresh and brackish-water clays, mudstones, and sandstones deposited during the Maastrichtian and Danian (respectively, the end of the Cretaceous period and the beginning of the Paleogene) by fluvial activity in fluctuating river channels and deltas and very occasional peaty swamp deposits along the low-lying eastern continental margin fronting the late Cretaceous Western Interior Seaway. The climate was mild, and the presence of crocodilians suggests a sub-tropical climate, with no prolonged annual cold. The famous iridium-enriched Cretaceous‚ÄìPaleogene boundary, which separates the Cretaceous from the Cenozoic, occurs as a discontinuous but distinct thin marker bedding above and occasionally within the formation, near its boundary with the overlying Fort Union Formation. The world's largest collection of Hell Creek fossils is housed and exhibited at the Museum of the Rockies, in Bozeman, Montana. The specimens displayed are the result of the museum's Hell Creek Project, a joint effort between the museum, Montana State University, the University of Washington,Wilson Lab the University of California, Berkeley, the University of North Dakota, and the University of North Carolina which began in 1998.  Description  The Hell Creek Formation is an intensively-studied geological formation of mostly Upper Cretaceous and some Early Paleocene rocks in North America, named for exposures studied along Hell Creek, near Jordan, Montana. The formation stretches over portions of Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota, and Wyoming. In Montana, the Hell Creek Formation overlies the Fox Hills Formation. In 1966, the Hell Creek Fossil Area was designated as a National Natural Landmark by the National Park Service.U.S. National Park Service, 1966  Geology  Map of the Hell Creek and Lance Formations in western North America The Hell Creek Formation in Montana overlies the Fox Hills Formation and underlies the Fort Union Formation, and the boundary with the latter occurs near the Cretaceous- Paleogene boundary (K-Pg), which defines the end of the Cretaceous period and has been dated to 66 ¬± 0.07 Ma old.Husson et al., 2011 The thickness of the formation is estimated to have been deposited in about 2 million years.LeCain, 2010 Fauna characteristic of the Hell Creek (Lancian land vertebrate age) are found as high as a few meters below the boundary.Pearson et al., 2002 The K-Pg boundary is generally situated near the contact between the upper Hell Creek and the lower Ludlow member of the Fort Union Formation, though in some areas (e.g. in North Dakota) the boundary is well within the Ludlow Member, above the boundary with the Hell Creek in some areas. On the other hand, in some small regions of Montana, the Hell Creek Formation contains the K-Pg boundary, and extends slightly into the Paleogene.Johnson et al., 2002 The Tanis site in North Dakota contains evidence of what is proposed to be a record of the effects of the Chicxulub meteorite impact ‚Äì such as the chaotic mixing of fossil carcasses and a layer of glass tektites with associated impact impressions ‚Äì deposited minutes to hours after the impact.DePalma et al., 2019Broad, 2019Preston, 2019  Paleobiology  Hell Creek fauna The remains of many animals including dinosaurs were found in the Hell Creek Formation. Its location at the changing conjunction of the eastern coast of Laramidia and the adjacent western shallows of the Western Interior Seaway led to the preservation of fossils of both marine and terrestrial creatures. Vertebrates include dinosaurs, pterosaurs, crocodiles, champsosaurs, lizards, snakes, turtles, frogs and salamanders. Remains of fishes and mammals have also been found in the Hell Creek Formation. The formation has produced impressive assemblages of invertebrates (including ammonites), plants, mammals, fish, reptiles (including the lizard Obamadon), marine reptiles (including the marine reptiles like mosasaurs, plesiosaurs and sea turtles), and amphibians. Notable dinosaur finds include Tyrannosaurus and Triceratops, ornithomimids as well, caenagnathids like Anzu, a variety of small theropods, pachycephalosaurs, ankylosaurs, crocodylomorphs and squamates, including various animal fossils unearthed in the Hell Creek Formation. The most complete hadrosaurid dinosaur ever found, an Edmontosaurus, was retrieved in 2000 from the Hell Creek Formation and widely publicized in a National Geographic documentary aired in December 2007. A few bird, mammal, and pterosaur fossils have also been found. The teeth of sharks and rays are sometimes found in the riverine Hell Creek Formation, suggesting that some of these taxa were then, as now, tolerant of fresh water. The \\"Lancian\\" fauna is more similar overall phylogenetically to East Asian and Canadian/Alaskan faunas than most Campanian North American faunas. Fossil insects from inclusions found within amber are known.DePalma, 2010 View of Hell Creek State Park, the \\"heart\\" of Hell Creek Formation  Depositional environment  The dominant plants of the Hell Creek Formation are mainly flowering plants It is a series of fresh and brackish-water clays, mudstones, and sandstones deposited during the Maastrichtian and Danian (respectively, the end of the Cretaceous period and the beginning of the Paleogene) by fluvial activity in fluctuating channels and deltas and very occasional peaty swamp deposits along the low-lying eastern continental margin fronting the late Cretaceous Western Interior Seaway. The Hell Creek Formation, as typified by exposures in the Fort Peck area of Montana, has been interpreted as a flat, forested floodplain with a relatively subtropical climate that supported a variety of plants ranging from angiosperm trees to conifers such as the bald cypress, ferns and ginkgos. The Hell Creek Formation was laid down by streams, on a coastal plain along the edge of the Western Interior Seaway. The presence of crocodylians suggests climate was subtropical; there was no cold season and probably ample precipitation. The Hell Creek Formation, Lance Formation and Scollard Formation represent different sections of the western shore of the shallow sea that divided western and eastern North America during the Cretaceous. Swampy lowlands were the habitat of various animals, including dinosaurs. A broad coastal plain extended westward from the seaway to the newly formed Rocky Mountains. These formations are composed largely of sandstone and mudstone which have been attributed to floodplain, fluvial, lacustrine, swamp, estuarine and coastal plain environments.Lofgren, 1997Breithaupt, 1997Eberth, 1997 Hell Creek is the best studied of these ancient environments. At the time, this region had a subtropical, warm and moist climate. The climate was humid, with flowering plants, conifers, palmettos, and ferns in the swamps, and conifers, canopy, understory plants, ash trees, live oak and shrubs in the forests. In northwestern South Dakota, strips of black layers deposited in the wetland environment are rich in coal, and a bright band-like layer of sand and mud from the river floodplain accumulated. Many plant species were supported, primarily angiosperms, and less commonly conifers, bald cypress, ferns and cycads. An abundance of fossil leaves are found at dozens of different sites indicating that the area was largely forested by small trees.  Fossil content = Dinosaurs  Pie chart of the time averaged census for large- bodied dinosaurs from the entire Hell Creek Formation in the study area A paleo-population study is one of the most difficult of analyses to conduct in field paleontology. Here is the most recent estimate of the proportions of the eight most common dinosaurian families in the Hell Creek Formation, based on detailed field studies by White, Fastovsky and Sheehan (1998). * Ceratopsidae 61% * Hadrosauridae 23% * Ornithomimidae 5% * Tyrannosauridae 4% * Hypsilophodontidae 3% * Dromaeosauridae 2% * Pachycephalosauridae 1% * Troodontidae 1% (represented only by teeth) Outcrops sampled by the Hell Creek Project were divided into three sections: lower, middle and upper slices. The top and bottom sections were the focus of the PLoS One report, and within each portion many remains of Triceratops, Edmontosaurus, and Tyrannosaurus were found. Triceratops was the most common in each section, but, surprisingly, Tyrannosaurus was just as common, if not slightly more common, than the hadrosaur Edmontosaurus. In the upper Hell Creek section, for example, the census included twenty two Triceratops, five Tyrannosaurus, and five Edmontosaurus. The dinosaurs Thescelosaurus, Ornithomimus, Pachycephalosaurus and Ankylosaurus were also included in the breakdown, but were relatively rare. Other dinosaurs, such as Sphaerotholus, Denversaurus, Torosaurus, Struthiomimus, Acheroraptor, Dakotaraptor, Pectinodon, Richardoestesia, Paronychodon, Anzu, Leptorhynchos and Troodon (more likely Pectinodon), were reported as being rare and are not included in the breakdown. The dinosaur collections made over the past decade during the Hell Creek Project yielded new information from an improved genus-level collecting schema and robust data set that revealed relative dinosaur abundances that were unexpected, and ontogenetic age classes previously considered rare. We recognize a much higher percentage of Tyrannosaurus than previous surveys. Tyrannosaurus equals Edmontosaurus in U3 and in L3 comprises a greater percentage of the large dinosaur fauna as the second-most abundant taxon after Triceratops, followed by Edmontosaurus. This is surprisingly consistent in (1) the two major lag deposits (MOR loc. HC-530 and HC-312) in the Apex sandstone and Jen-rex sand where individual bones were counted and (2) in two thirds of the formation reflected in L3 and U3 records of dinosaur skeletons only. Triceratops is by far the most common dinosaur at 40% (n = 72), Tyrannosaurus is second at 24% (n = 44), Edmontosaurus is third at 20% (n = 36), followed by Thescelosaurus at 8% (n = 15), Ornithomimus at 5% (n = 9), and Pachycephalosaurus and Ankylosaurus both at 1% (n = 2) are relatively rare. Fossil footprints of dinosaurs from the Hell Creek Formation are very rare. As of 2017, there is only one find of a possible Tyrannosaurus rex footprint, dating from 2007 and described a year later.Manning et al., 2008 = Eumaniraptorans = Historically, numerous teeth have been attributed to various dromaeosaurid and troodontid taxa with known body fossils from only older formations, including Dromaeosaurus, Saurornitholestes, and Troodon. However, in a 2013 study, Evans et al. concluded that there is little evidence for more than a single dromaeosaurid taxon, Acheroraptor, in the Hell Creek-Lance assemblages, which would render these taxa invalid for this formation. This was disproved in a 2015 study, DePalma et al., when they described the new genus Dakotaraptor, a large species of dromaeosaur.Evans, 2013 Fossilized teeth of various troodontids and coelurosaurs are common throughout the Hell Creek Formation; the best known examples include Paronychodon, Pectinodon and Richardoestesia, respectively.  Flora  Although the first representatives of leafy trees and true grasses emerged in the Cretaceous, the flora was still dominated by conifers like Araucaria The Hell Creek Formation was a low floodplain at the time before the sea retreated, and in the wet ground of the dense woodland, laurels, sycamores, beech, magnolias, and palm trees grew. Ferns and moss grew in the forest understory. Plant fossils from the upper early Paleocene of the Hell Creek Formation include the ferns Botrychium, Woodwardia, Osmunda, Onoclea and Azolla; conifers Metasequoia, Glyptostrobus and cupressaceous conifers; the monocot Limnobiophyllum (a relative of duckweeds); and the dicots Cercidiphyllum and Platanus.Chandrasekharam, 1974Christophel, 1976 There are numerous types of leaves, seeds, flowers and other structures from Angiosperms, or flowering plants. The Hell Creek Formation of this layer contains 300 tablets or more of plants. Angiosperms are by far the most diverse and dominant flora of the entire population, about 90 percent. However, the evergreens included conifers, ginkgo, bald cypress, and cycads. Flowering plants included a variety of trees that no longer exist. Today Hell Creek's flora is hardwood forest mixed with deciduous and evergreen forest and apparently similar to then, but with a closer look, the current plant community is distinct. In sharp contrast to Montana today, the presence of palm trees meant the climate was warmer then. Spinifructus antiquus of the palm family (Arecaceae), closely related to the genus Astrocaryum. Dr. Kirk Johnson (Scientist) claims that there are no grasses, oaks, maples, or willows in the Hell Creek Formation. Ferns are uncommon in the majority of the formation, however there is a great increase in the abundance of fossil fern spores in the two centimeters of rock that directly overlies the impact fallout layer (the famous K-T boundary layer). This increase in fern spore abundance is commonly referred to as \\"the fern spike\\" (meaning that if the abundance of spores as a function of stratigraphic position were plotted out, the graph would show a spike just above the impact fallout layer). Johnson also found that the majority of the angiosperm genera in the Hell Creek Formation are now extinct. He also believes that, very roughly, 80% of the terrestrial plant taxa died out in what is now Montana and the Dakotas at the K/T boundary. Many of the modern plant affinities in the Hell Creek Formation (e.g., those with the prefix \\"aff.\\" or with quotes around the genus name) may not in reality belong to these genera; instead they could be entirely different plants that resemble modern genera. Therefore, there is some question regarding whether the modern Populus or Juglans, as two examples, actually lived in the late Cretaceous. Compared to the rich Hell Creek Formation fossil plant localities of the Dakotas, relatively few plant specimens have been collected from Montana. A few taxa were collected at Brownie Butte Montana by Shoemaker, but most plants were collected from North Dakota (Slope County) and from South Dakota. \\"TYPE\\" after the binomial means that it is represented by a type specimen found in the Yale-Peabody Museum collections. \\"YPM\\" is the prefix for the Yale-Peabody Museum specimen number.

APS is especially well-suited to environments where simpler planning methods cannot adequately address complex trade-offs between competing priorities. Production scheduling is intrinsically very difficult due to the (approximately) factorial dependence of the size of the solution space on the number of items/products to be manufactured. Difficulty of production planning Traditional production planning and scheduling systems (such as manufacturing resource planning) use a stepwise procedure to allocate material and production capacity. This approach is simple but cumbersome, and does not readily adapt to changes in demand, resource capacity or material availability. Materials and capacity are planned separately, and many systems do not consider material or capacity constraints, leading to infeasible plans. However, attempts to change to the new system have not always been successful, which has called for the combination of management philosophy with manufacturing. Unlike previous systems, APS simultaneously plans and schedules production based on available materials, labor and plant capacity. APS has commonly been applied where one or more of the following conditions are present: #make to order (as distinct from make to stock) manufacturing #capital-intensive production processes, where plant capacity is constrained #products 'competing' for plant capacity: where many different products are produced in each facility #products that require a large number of components or manufacturing tasks #production necessitates frequent schedule changes which cannot be predicted before the event Advanced planning & scheduling software enables manufacturing scheduling and advanced scheduling optimization within these environments.

The college focuses on Native American art. It operates the Museum of Contemporary Native Arts (MoCNA), which is housed in the historic Santa Fe Federal Building (the old Post Office), a landmark Pueblo Revival building listed on the National Register of Historic Places as Federal Building. The museum houses the National Collection of Contemporary Indian Art, with more than 7,000 items. History The Institute of American Indian Arts was co-founded by Lloyd Kiva New (Cherokee, 1916‚Äì2002) and Dr. George Boyce in 1962 with funding from the Bureau of Indian Affairs. The school was founded upon the recommendation of the BIA Department of Education and the Indian Arts and Crafts Board. Three factors led to the school's founding: growing dissatisfaction with the academic program at the Santa Fe Indian School, the BIA's emerging interest in higher education, and the influence of the Southwest Indian Art Project and the Rockefeller Foundation. IAIA began on the SFIS campus in October 1962. From 1962 to 1979, IAIA ran a high school program, and began offering college- and graduate-level art courses in 1975. In 1986, the Institute of American Indian and Alaska Native Culture and Arts Development was congressionally chartered as a nonprofit organization, similar to the structure of the Smithsonian Institution, which separated the school from the BIA. In 2001, the school was accredited, including the accreditation of four year degrees. A two-year low-residency MFA in creative writing was accredited in 2013. Today, IAIA sits on a campus south of downtown Santa Fe and also operates the Museum of Contemporary Native Art, which is located in Santa Fe Plaza, as well as the Center for Lifelong Education. IAIA Museum of Contemporary Native Arts IAIA Museum of Contemporary Native Arts, Santa Fe, 2004 In 1991 the college founded the Institute of American Indian Arts Museum, now the IAIA Museum of Contemporary Native Arts (MoCNA), in downtown Santa Fe, with a focus on contemporary intertribal Native American art (the C. N. Gorman Museum at the University of California, Davis, which also has a contemporary intertribal Native art focus, was founded in 1973.) MoCNA is housed in the historic Santa Fe Federal Building (the old Post Office), a landmark Pueblo Revival building listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The museum also features the Allan Houser Sculpture Garden.

Population: 8,100 (1998 est.). History Zubtsov was first mentioned in a chronicle in 1216. Due to its location on the Volga, it controlled one of the versions of the Trade route from the Varangians to the Greeks. In the Middle Ages, it was a border fortress of Principality of Tver. Between 1318 and 1460, separate Zubtsov Principality existed with the seat in Zubtsov. It was subordinate to the Tver principality. In 1460, it was abolished and merged back to Principality of Tver. The Grand Duchy of Moscow annexed it with the rest of Principality of Tver in 1485. Subsequently, the town was important chiefly as a flax trade market. Its Neoclassical cathedral was constructed in 1801. In the course of the administrative reform carried out in 1708 by Peter the Great, Zubtsov was included into Ingermanlandia Governorate (since 1710 known as Saint Petersburg Governorate), and in 1727 Novgorod Governorate split off. In 1775, Tver Viceroyalty was formed from the lands which previously belonged to Moscow and Novgorod Governorates, and the area was transferred to Tver Viceroyalty, which in 1796 was transformed to Tver Governorate. In 1775, Zubtsovsky Uyezd was established, with the center in Zubtsov. On 30 May 1922, Zubtsovsky Uyezd was abolished and merged into Rzhevsky Uyezd. On 12 July 1929, governorates and uyezds were abolished, and Zubtsovsky District with the administrative center in Zubtsov was established. It belonged to Rzhev Okrug of Western Oblast. On August 1, 1930 the okrugs were abolished, and the districts were subordinated directly to the oblast. On 29 January 1935 Kalinin Oblast was established, and Zubtsovsky District was transferred to Kalinin Oblast. During World War II, the town was occupied by German troops from October 11, 1941 to August 23, 1942 and almost razed to the ground. It was a place of fierce fighting of the Battle of Rzhev. About 15,000 of Red Army soldiers are buried at the Zubtsov's memorial. The town was revitalized after the Vazuza Reservoir project was started in the 1970s. The reservoir currently provides Moscow with one quarter of its drinking water. In February 1963, during the abortive administrative reform by Nikita Khrushchev, Zubtsovsky District was merged into Rzhevsky District, but on 12 January 1965 it was re- established. In 1990, Kalinin Oblast was renamed Tver Oblast. Administrative and municipal status Within the framework of administrative divisions, Zubtsov serves as the administrative center of Zubtsovsky District. As an administrative division, it is incorporated within Zubtsovsky District as Zubtsov Urban Settlement.Law #34-ZO stipulates that the borders of the settlements (administrative-territorial divisions) are identical to the borders of the urban and rural settlements (municipal divisions), and that the borders of the administrative districts are identical to the borders of the municipal districts. Law #25-ZO, which describes the borders and the composition of the municipal formations in Zubtsovsky Municipal District, lists the town of Zubtsov as a part and the administrative center of Zubtsov Urban Settlement of that district. As a municipal division, this administrative unit also has urban settlement status and is a part of Zubtsovsky Municipal District.Law #25-ZO Economy=Industry There are enterprises of timber industry and of metallurgy in Zubtsov. Transportation The railroad which connects Moscow and Riga via Rzhev, runs through Zubtsov. The M9 highway connecting Moscow with Riga also passes Zobtsov. Another road to Gagarin branches off south. There are also local roads with bus traffic originating from Zubtsov. The Volga is navigable, however, there is no passenger navigation. Culture and recreation Zubtsov contains four cultural heritage monuments of federal significance and additionally twenty-two objects classified as cultural and historical heritage of local significance. The federal monuments include the Dormition Cathedral, as well as an archeological site and two monuments related to World War II. The Zubtsov District Museum, open in 1988 and located in Zubtsov, exhibits collections of local interest, including historical and archeological collections.

It has since been re-created in a variety of formats, including software for the X Window System, play-by-email, Java applet, Android application, and web-based. Gameplay Two or more players take the role of wizards, and the object of the game is to be the last wizard standing. Wizards can cast spells at other wizards, themselves, or summoned monsters. These spells are cast through gestures: each turn, the player chooses two gestures, one for each hand, from clap (C), wave (W), snap (S), wriggle fingers (F), proffered palm (P) and digit point (D). There are also the non-magical gestures stab (>) and nothing (-). Turns are resolved simultaneously once all wizards have submitted their gestures for a given turn. These gestures are built up via many turns to form spells. For instance, one can cast the spell \\"Magic Missile\\" by performing the S (snap) gesture followed by the D (digit point) with the same hand on a consecutive turn. This is usually denoted as 'SD'. The spell is cast on the turn that the D is made, assuming no intervention (such as a Counter Spell). Play centers around the strategy of tracking what spells are being cast on all four (or more) hands, thus ensuring your spells achieve their desired effect while attempting to mitigate those of your opponent. The game is one of pure strategy; outside of the \\"Confusion\\" spell which causes a random gesture to be made all spell effects can be anticipated deterministically, making it akin to Chess or Go. Through a few minor variants to the rules, all random chance and other imbalances can be removed.

BBC Mundo (Spanish for BBC World) is part of the BBC World Service's foreign language output, one of 40 languages it provides.  History  BBC Mundo is the BBC‚Äôs service for the Spanish-speaking world. It is part of BBC World Service. The website offers news, information and analysis in text, audio and video. BBC Mundo has its headquarters on the fifth floor of the BBC‚Äôs New Broadcasting House in London. The BBC‚Äôs Spanish service also has a newsroom in Miami, offices in Buenos Aires and M√©xico City, and reporters in Washington DC, Los Angeles, Havana, Caracas, Bogot√°, Santiago, Quito, Lima and Madrid. BBC Mundo benefits from the international newsgathering strength of the BBC which has journalists in more places than any other international news broadcaster. The website bbcmundo.com was born in 1999 as a debate site - a single page dedicated to encouraging a weekly discussion of specific subjects on the global news agenda. ‚ÄúThere were only two of us working on the site at the time, the site was neither supposed to nor able to reflect the changing news. The Clinton/Lewinski scandal hit in the middle of a week where the page was encouraging debate on a totally different topic, highlighting beautifully how extremely difficult it is to not update a BBC-branded site continuously and retain credibility,‚Äù remembers Julia Zapata, first editor of the site and later Head of BBC Mundo until 2009. The BBC then decided to allocate funding for 24x7 news websites in Spanish, Russian, Chinese and Arabic. The first major wave of change involved recruitment, training and staffing and resulted in the creation of the site indexes needed to deliver full 24x7 region-specific, interactive and multimedia coverage. ‚ÄúThe next stage were years of consolidation, editorial growth and creative experimentation. This culminated with the combined World Service language websites winning a 2007 Webby Award, and BBC Mundo winning the prestigious Ortega y Gasset Online Journalism award in 2007,‚Äù says Zapata. However, less than a month after winning the award, a major budget cut across the World Service was announced. As a result, BBC Mundo radio broadcasts were reduced.  The Latin American service of the BBC  The first BBC broadcast in Spanish took place on 14 March 1938 when the BBC‚Äôs Latin American Service (el Servicio Latinoamericano de la BBC) was launched, initially airing 15-minute radio transmissions in Spanish and Portuguese. The service was launched in response to broadcasts by the governments of Nazi Germany and fascist Italy which had begun a strong propaganda campaign aimed at Latin America. Lord John Reith, Director-General of the BBC, made a speech on the day to welcome the Spanish-speaking listeners. Following the installation of new transmitters, the service was extended to three, and later to four, hours a day. The BBC also arranged rebroadcasts by a number of local stations across Latin America. The Mexican writer Elena Poniatowska remembers how her mother told her about her trust in the BBC: ‚ÄúWe lived in M√©xico and she looked frenetically for news about the war because my father was at the frontline.‚Äù The first Spanish service journalists remembered those times as really tough. They witnessed the destruction of their studio, then in Broadcasting House. (Later the service was moved to Bush House along with BBC‚Äôs other language services, where it stayed until 2012.) When World War II began, the BBC Latin American Service was important in countering propaganda from Axis Power radio networks. The BBC broadcast news and information in favour of the Allies, along with information about the situation of the occupied countries under Nazi Germany, and the persecution of Europe's Jewish population. After the war, the Latin American service‚Äôs broadcasts expanded, and features and arts programming returned. One such notable addition was Carrusel Londinense, with live orchestras, singers and comedians entertaining the audience. Radio dramas were also a success ‚Äì e.g., the adaptation of Cervantes‚Äô Don Quixote de La Mancha. The next decades were shaped by news about the Cold War, the Cuban Revolution and the Cuban Missile Crisis, and the race for space supremacy. However, the BBC‚Äôs Spanish-language radio also gave a lot of prominence to culture thanks to journalists such as Juan Peirano, Eduardo de Benito, Julio Garc√≠a and Jackie Richards. Shortwave radio transmissions became vital to Latin America during the 1970s, when most of the countries in the region were under military rule. Many people tuned in to the BBC during times of political crisis and military coups, as in Chile in the aftermath of September 1973. The BBC Latin American Service's credibility was put in the spotlight when Great Britain went to war with Argentina over the Falkland/Malvinas Islands. Despite the fact that BBC World Service was funded by the British Foreign Office, BBC journalists did their best to deliver unbiased coverage of the conflict, reporting Argentine statements and claims without comment. The even-handed approach of the BBC had its critics at home ‚Äì including the government. The BBC defended its position by declaring, for example, that \\"it is not the BBC's role to boost British troops' morale\\", and that \\"the widow in Portsmouth is no different from the widow of Buenos Aires\\". When the British government took control of one BBC transmitter on the Ascension Island to broadcast the propagandist Radio Atl√°ntico Sur, ‚Äúthe BBC reacted and warned people, especially its audience in Argentina, that English propaganda was about to broadcast instead of impartial information,‚Äù remembers the Argentine writer Osvaldo Soriano. The Argentine government tried to interfere with the BBC‚Äôs shortwave transmissions, jamming them and issuing a decree forbidding radio stations in Argentina to contact the BBC‚Äôs Latin American Service for interviews. The BBC‚Äôs service in Spanish expanded during the 1990s when satellite technologies allowed more access to the service across the continent. Interactive programmes flourished, among them El Circuito which broadcast opinions and messages of thousands of listeners and was a source of great anecdotes. The spread of satellite transmissions as well as the emergence of the web and the competition with television channels resulted in the decline of shortwave broadcasting in the region. The BBC‚Äôs Spanish- language radio programmes such as El Circuito, Enfoque, Estudio Abierto, V√≠a Libre, F√∫tbol Europa and Notas de Jazz became available for listening across Latin America via local radio stations. The BBC‚Äôs Spanish-language news website was created. On 10 October 2005, the BBC Latin American Service officially changed its name to BBC Mundo.  A new age  According to Julia Zapata, one of the immediate benefits of the 2007 budget cuts ‚Äúwas to allow [BBC Mundo] to focus completely on the website and produce high-impact output such as the NarcoM√©xico special which won two BBC Global News awards for multimedia production in 2008.‚Äù Radio broadcasts ceased in 2011. From 2012, BBC Mundo was headed by Hernando Alvarez who took over from Hilary Bishop. He also later became Head of the Americas Hub of BBC World Service. Today, bbcmundo.com has a news philosophy based on creative angles and thorough analysis which complement the information its audience receive in their own countries. Alvarez says that one of the key distinguishing features of BBC Mundo is ‚Äúthe range of its editorial remit, where technology, science, health, art and culture are treated with the same relevance as current-affairs stories. Whatever is the subject of the BBC Mundo coverage, it challenges pre- conceptions and gets to the core of the issue.‚Äù The website has syndication partnerships with major news websites across Latin America: MSN portals (Latam, Argentina, Chile, Peru, Colombia, Costa Rica, Latino USA and Prodigy Mexico), TERRA portals (Mexico, USA Latino, Argentina, Chile, Peru, Colombia, Spain), and BING portals (Mexico, Latam, Argentina, Chile, Peru, Colombia, Spain, Latino USA); and prominent newspapers, magazines and websites such as El Comercio (Peru), La Tercera (Chile), La Nacion (Argentina), El Nacional (Venezuela), Semana (Colombia), Animal P (Mexico), El Mostrador (Chile), Ecuavisa (Ecuador), Caracol (Colombia), Analitica (Venezuela), 24horas.cl (Chile), Noticias24 (Venezuela); and YouTube. In the beginning of 2014, 15 years after its creation, bbcmundo.com had over 8.5 million monthly unique visitors who read its stories, follow its live texts, watch its videos and share their comments via its Facebook and Twitter accounts.

Schools rate their education systems on academic performance of their students and compare them to schools nationwide as well as globally. There is a constant competitive drive for schools to be among the top in performance and achievement. Introducing a universal preschool program would allow for young children of different socioeconomic backgrounds to build and improve their academic and social skills to better prepare them for kindergarten and the rest of their academic career. Additionally, The introduction of universal preschool would allow for many financially struggling families to send their children to preschool which would allow for many women to enter or re-enter the workforce. Publicly funded preschool in the US After analyzing and citing nationwide and international research that show the short-term and long-term benefits preschool has for low to middle income families, the movement to advance publicly funded preschool has resulted in the successful passage of preschool legislation in 44 states in the US. While some legislation for funding preschool has been passed on the federal level (including the Race to the Top Early Learning Challenge Grant) much of the advocacy still focuses on building broad support from diverse leaders in business, educators, child activists, philanthropists, law enforcement, and healthcare to lobby state legislatures. According to an article by N.P.R., even though preschool programs and numbers have improved, the quality and enrollment percentages are still uneven between states. For example, as stated in the NPR article, \\"Washington, D.C. spends $15,748 per child. Mississippi spends less than $2,000 per child, roughly half of what states spend on average.\\"; this portrays an example of the disparities ranging in the current preschool programs as well as why quality universal preschool should be a top priority. While variations in implementation are numerous, state-funded pre-k consistently offer programs on a voluntary basis for children and families, unlike compulsory elementary, which is mandated by law with exceptions to allow for homeschooling and alternative education. Variations include how states deal with the following pre-k implementation elements: *age of children eligible for the service of preschool (usually three-, four-, or five-year- olds, but sometimes only four-year-olds), *wrap-around services, including whether special supports such as home visiting, and playgroups are provided to support children from at-risk families, * full-day versus part-day pre-k, and whether programs should be offered year-round or only during the school year, * role of parents in paying for part of their child's pre-k tuition, * quality requirements for state-funded programs, including requirements for teacher education and preparation, class size, teacher to child ratios, and the use of evidence-based curriculum, * whether universal state-funded programs should be provided in the existing diverse delivery system for early childhood programs (including Headstart, public schools, non-profit and for-profit centers, programs hosted by churches that are non-religious, or in home settings such as regulated family day care). Supporters of publicly funded preschool for all children cite research that shows: *Because the brain is developing rapidly during the early years, stimulation from high quality preschool can support the development of neurologic pathways that serve a child in lifelong learning, *Longitudinal studies (Abecedarian, Chicago Parent Child Centers, and the Perry Preschool Project) show significant longterm benefits for children who attend preschool, including improved health, social and behavioral outcomes, and well as higher income than the control group. *Advocates for those in poverty cite research related to the achievement gap, where many at-risk children start out behind in school for a variety of reasons and never catch up. Pre-k programs help to eliminate this gap. *Business organizations cite the need for pre-k to improve school-readiness and literacy by age nine, in order to impact universal achievement of all children. *The Information below was provided by: DLC  Model Initiatives  July 20, 2006 *Studies of high-quality preschool programs in North Carolina and Michigan have found that public investments in such programs could, in fact, deliver a 7-to-1 return in the long run, in the form of increased productivity and decreased social spending. *A University of Georgia study found that the pre-k students improved their school readiness scores relative to national norms. It also found that the pre-k system eliminated the skills gap between universal pre-K students and the more affluent students whose parents sent them to private programs. *A Georgetown University study found gains in the children's cognitive and language assessment scores from the Oklahoma pre-k program‚Äîparticularly among African-American and Hispanic children, whose scores improved by an average of 17 percent and 54 percent, respectively. As of 2006, 98 percent of Oklahoma school districts offer pre-k programs, up 30 percent since 1998.  Economic Advantages  Recent studies show that the benefits of universal preschool outweigh the costs. A 2005 longitudinal study of 123 3 and 4-year-old black children conducted a cost- benefit analysis, reports that for every $1 invested in preschool education, there is a return on the investment of $12.90. Advantages of universal preschool for the child also include higher reading scores for low-income students. According to research from Dartmouth College, universal preschool programs boost low-income children's reading scores more than targeted preschool programs (e.g., Head Start). The study finds that the difference in reading scores is large enough to conclude that universal preschool is more productive than targeted preschool.Cascio, E. (2017). Does universal preschool hit the target? Program access and preschool impacts. Unpublished manuscript, Department of Economics, Dartmouth College, Hanover, NH. Retrieved from http://www.dartmouth.edu/~eucascio/cascio_prek_latest.pdf Other research supports the Dartmouth College study's findings. Barnett and Frede's (2010) extensive research in early childhood education found that because students learn from each other, disadvantaged students learn more if their classmates are socioeconomically diverse. Additionally, a study out of Tulsa that compared Head Start and a state-funded (i.e., universal) preschool program found that the universal program is more effective in improving literacy outcomes and attentiveness.  Policymaking Considerations  As the topic of universal preschool gains momentum in the United States, policymakers will be involved in designing preschool programs. Many researchers are concerned that once state governments get involved, preschool programs will focus on academic skills rather than the comprehensive developmental needs of children. Because of the rich diversity in schools, researchers caution against using a 'one- size fits all' policy for developing universal preschool programs. Researchers recommend that policymakers consider the diverse perspectives of the primary stakeholders (i.e., children and educators) when developing policy for high- quality preschools. Research performed by Celia Genishi can aid policymakers in developing culturally responsive and developmentally appropriate high- quality preschool programs. Genishi's research considers the diverse classroom and students as the 'norm' and stresses the importance of the context of learning. Researchers suggest that policymakers examine a variety of research studies and create systems that are responsive to student diversity so that we can better serve all children.  History  *The universal preschool movement started in France with Ecoles Maternelles in 1834. *Various other European countries adopted some form of universal preschool, including Sweden. *The movement gained ground in the United States as research showed that the high cost of high quality pre-k was beyond the ability of parents to pay, while the benefits from longitudinal studies showed societal benefits such as decreased crime, improved health, and greater earning capacity of children in later years. *To date, various states have begun implementation of a Universal Preschool system including Georgia, Florida, New Jersey, Oklahoma, Illinois and others. *New Jersey's program came out of a court decision based on the poor quality of education in large parts of the state (New Jersey Abbott versus BurkeNew Jersey Abbott versus Burke). *Florida's Universal Preschool was established by constitutional amendment initiative approved by the voters that left much of the program to be implemented by the Governor and Legislature. *Georgia dedicated their lottery profits for preschool. * On June 6, 2006, California voters defeated an initiative for part day preschool for all four-year-olds as a constitutional right. The initiative proposed to include a tax on those in very wealthy income brackets. Those taxes were to be placed in a separate fund, and remain independent from the state budget. Text of the initiative can be found at California Preschool for All Act.California Preschool for All Act Film director and actor, Rob Reiner, was a public advocate for the proposed program. * Advocates formed the Los Angeles Universal Preschool (LAUP), an independent public benefit corporation created in 2004 and funded by First 5 LA. LAUP‚Äôs goal is to make voluntary, high- quality preschool available to every 4-year-old child in Los Angeles County, regardless of their family‚Äôs income, by 2014. LAUP is guided by a 10-year Master Plan developed by hundreds of educators, parents, government officials, and business and community leaders. Building on this plan, LAUP is bringing resources together from across the county in support of early childhood education. When LAUP has reached full scale, funded classrooms will serve more than 100,000 4-year-olds. * The National Association for the Education of Young Children participated in a Governor's Forum on Quality Preschool held in December 2003. This organization stands on the principal that building on existing preschool providers and programs, including child care, Head Start and schools, will ensure a standard for high quality preschools. *Illinois was the first state to offer voluntary preschool to all three- and four-year-olds whose parents want them to participate. Preschool for All was signed into law in July 2006, after a bill passed in the general assembly. When fully implemented, Preschool for All will ensure that 190,000 children in Illinois have access to high quality preschool. The legislature also approved $45 million in additional funding for the Early Childhood Block Grant to expand and enhance already established programs, and an 11% allotment of funds for birth- three children. *Preschool for All programs are funded in a wide variety of child care and school settings. According to a 2005 study by the National Center for Education Statistics,National Center for Education Statistics children are more likely to attend a center-based care program located in its own building (38 percent) than a center-based care arrangement in any other location, including churches, synagogues and other places of worship (25 percent), public schools (17 percent), private schools (9 percent), community centers (3 percent), and any other facility (10 percent). Directors of faith-based preschools and child care centers have voiced concern that Preschool for All will close down their programs. The concern is that, while other not-for-profit centers and for-profit centers can apply for the Early Childhood Block Grant, faith-based programs might not qualify, because they include Bible stories, prayer and worship songs in their curriculum. This matter has been addressed in a number of states, such as Illinois,Illinois Preschool for All where faith-based programs are eligible for Preschool for All funding for the part of the day that does not include religious instruction. Since Preschool for All is funded for a half day program in most locations, religious schooling can occur at other times during the day, and additional funding streams can be used to subsidize child care at those other times. Opposition in the US *Assessment of program outcomes has been difficult, largely due to the lack of data and newness of universal pre-k around the nation. Studies in the US have not fully demonstrated the long term benefit of pre-k to middle income children, although studies in Australia and New Zealand with comparable demographics have. *Critics have charged that the costs of universal pre-k could rise. Since the term \\"universal\\" means access for all children, the cost varies in proportional to the expected contribution by parents in addition to state funding, the number of hours for which a state provide funding, and whether qualifying programs have enough slots for all children. *Since quality requirements stipulate certain standards, not all pre-k programs, especially those in private settings, are eligible. There remains a controversy about whether private providers will be driven out of business if local public schools offer full-day, tuition-free programs. *Critics charge that where high quality publicly funded pre-k slots are limited, waiting lists can result in disadvantaged children competing with higher income children for preschool access. Some states provide an additional amount of tuition to help offset the special needs of at-risk children. *Although no state mandates participation in programs, and even though some states provide funding for home-based pre-k programs, some conservatives argue that the responsibility for care and learning before kindergarten belongs solely to parents. *In some states teachers unions are working with pre-k teachers to create early education unions, to allow for bargaining with state on pre-k reimbursements. At the same time, some teachers unions have opposed siting pre-k programs in private centers and homes, as a drain of public education resources and a potential open-door to school vouchers.

She was the third pre-dreadnought of the , which also included her sister ships , , and . Weissenburg was laid down in 1890 in the AG Vulcan dockyard in Stettin, launched in 1891, and completed in 1894. The Brandenburg-class battleships were unique for their era in that they carried six large-caliber guns in three twin turrets, as opposed to four guns in two turrets, as was the standard in other navies. Weissenburg served with I Division during the first decade of her service with the fleet. This period was generally limited to training exercises and goodwill visits to foreign ports. These training maneuvers were nevertheless very important to developing German naval tactical doctrine in the two decades before World War I, especially under the direction of Alfred von Tirpitz. Weissenburg, along with her three sisters, saw only one major overseas deployment during this period, to China in 1900‚Äì1901, during the Boxer Rebellion. The ship underwent a major modernization in 1904‚Äì1905. In 1910, Weissenburg was sold to the Ottoman Empire and renamed Turgut Reis, after the famous 16th century Turkish admiral. The ship saw heavy service during the Balkan Wars, primarily providing artillery support to Ottoman ground forces. She also took part in two naval engagements with the Greek Navy‚Äîthe Battle of Elli in December 1912, and the Battle of Lemnos the following month. Both battles were defeats for the Ottoman Navy. After the Ottoman Empire entered World War I, she supported the fortresses protecting the Dardanelles through mid-1915, and was decommissioned from August 1915 to the end of the war. She served as a training ship from 1924 to 1933, and a barracks ship until 1950, when she was broken up. Design alt=Line drawing for this type of ship; the vessel had three large gun turrets on the centerline and two thin smoke stacks. Weissenburg was the third of four s, the first pre-dreadnought battleships of the (Imperial Navy). Prior to the ascension of Kaiser Wilhelm II to the German throne in June 1888, the German fleet had been largely oriented toward defense of the German coastline and Leo von Caprivi, chief of the (Imperial Naval Office), had ordered a number of coastal defense ships in the 1880s. In August 1888, the Kaiser, who had a strong interest in naval matters, replaced Caprivi with (VAdm‚ÄîVice Admiral) Alexander von Monts and instructed him to include four battleships in the 1889‚Äì1890 naval budget. Monts, who favored a fleet of battleships over the coastal defense strategy emphasized by his predecessor, cancelled the last four coastal defense ships authorized under Caprivi and instead ordered four battleships. Though they were the first modern battleships built in Germany, presaging the Tirpitz-era High Seas Fleet, the authorization for the ships came as part of a construction program that reflected the strategic and tactical confusion of the 1880s caused by the (Young School). Weissenburg, named for the Battle of Weissenburg of 1870, was long overall, had a beam of which was increased to with the addition of torpedo nets, and had a draft of forward and aft. She displaced as designed and up to at full combat load. She was equipped with two sets of 3-cylinder vertical triple expansion steam engines that each drove a screw propeller. Steam was provided by twelve transverse cylindrical Scotch marine boilers. The ship's propulsion system was rated at and a top speed of . She had a maximum range of at a cruising speed of . Her crew numbered 38 officers and 530 enlisted men. The ship was unusual for its time in that it possessed a broadside of six heavy guns in three twin gun turrets, rather than the four- gun main battery typical of contemporary battleships. The forward and after turrets carried 28 cm (11 in) K L/40 guns, while the amidships turret mounted a pair of 28 cm guns with shorter L/35 barrels. Her secondary armament consisted of eight SK L/35 quick-firing guns mounted in casemates and eight 8.8 cm (3.45 in) SK L/30 quick-firing guns, also casemate mounted. Weissenburgs armament system was rounded out with six torpedo tubes, all in above-water swivel mounts. Although the main battery was heavier than other capital ships of the period, the secondary armament was considered weak in comparison to other battleships. Weissenburg was protected with nickel-steel Krupp armor, a new type of stronger steel. Her main belt armor was thick in the central section that protected the ammunition magazines and machinery spaces. The deck was thick. The main battery barbettes were protected with thick armor.

Ordered as battleship \\"C\\", she was laid down at the AG Vulcan shipyard in Stettin in May 1890 under construction number 199. The third ship of the class to be launched, Weissenburg slid down the slipway on 30 June 1891. She was informally commissioned for sea trials on 28 August 1894, which lasted until 24 September. The ship formally entered service on 10 October, under the command of then- (Captain at Sea) with (Corvette Captain Eduard von Capelle as the executive officer. Weissenburg then underwent further trials, which ended on 12 January 1895, after which she was assigned to I Division of the Maneuver Squadron, where she was initially occupied with individual training. Toward the end of May, more fleet maneuvers were carried out in the North Sea, concluding with a visit by the fleet to Kirkwall in Orkney. The squadron returned to Kiel in early June, where preparations were underway for the opening of the Kaiser Wilhelm Canal. Tactical exercises were carried out in Kiel Bay in the presence of foreign delegations to the opening ceremony. On 1 July, the German fleet began a major cruise into the Atlantic; on the return voyage in early August, the fleet stopped at the Isle of Wight for the Cowes Regatta. The fleet returned to Wilhelmshaven on 10 August and began preparations for the autumn maneuvers that would begin later that month. The first exercises began in the Helgoland Bight on 25 August. The fleet then steamed through the Skagerrak to the Baltic; heavy storms caused significant damage to many of the ships and the torpedo boat capsized and sank in the storms‚Äîonly three men were saved. The fleet stayed briefly in Kiel before resuming maneuvers, including live-fire exercises, in the Kattegat and the Great Belt. The main maneuvers began on 7 September with a mock attack from Kiel toward the eastern Baltic. Subsequent maneuvers took place off the coast of Pomerania and in Danzig Bay. A fleet review for Kaiser Wilhelm II off Jersh√∂ft concluded the maneuvers on 14 September. The year 1896 followed much the same pattern as the previous year. Individual ship training was conducted through April, followed by squadron training in the North Sea in late April and early May. This included a visit to the Dutch ports of Vlissingen and Nieuwediep. Additional maneuvers, which lasted from the end of May to the end of July, took the squadron further north in the North Sea, frequently into Norwegian waters. The ships visited Bergen from 11 to 18 May. During the maneuvers, Wilhelm II and the Chinese viceroy Li Hongzhang observed a fleet review off Kiel. On 9 August, the training fleet assembled in Wilhelmshaven for the annual autumn fleet training. Weissenburg and the rest of the fleet operated under the normal routine of individual and unit training in the first half of 1897. The typical routine was interrupted in early August when Wilhelm II and Augusta went to visit the Russian imperial court at Kronstadt; both divisions of I Squadron were sent to accompany the Kaiser. They returned to Neufahrwasser in Danzig on 15 August, where the rest of the fleet joined them for the annual autumn maneuvers. These exercises reflected the tactical thinking of the new State Secretary of the (RMA‚ÄîImperial Navy Office), (KAdm‚ÄîRear Admiral) Alfred von Tirpitz, and the new commander of I Squadron, VAdm August von Thomsen. These new tactics stressed accurate gunnery, especially at longer ranges, though the necessities of the line-ahead formation led to tactical rigidity. Thomsen's emphasis on shooting created the basis for the excellent German gunnery during World War I. During the firing exercises, Weissenburg won the Kaiser's Schie√üpreis (Shooting Prize) for excellent accuracy in I Squadron. On the night of 21‚Äì22 August, the torpedo boat accidentally rammed and sank one of Weissenburgs barges, killing two men. The maneuvers were completed by 22 September in Wilhelmshaven. In early December, I Division conducted maneuvers in the Kattegat and the Skagerrak, though they were cut short due to crew shortages. =1898‚Äì1900= alt=A large ship at anchor, with a large flag billowing at the stern From 20 to 28 February, Weissenburg briefly served as the divisional flagship. The fleet followed the normal routine of individual and fleet training in 1898 without incident, and a voyage to the British Isles was also included. The fleet stopped in Queenstown, Greenock, and Kirkwall. The fleet assembled in Kiel on 14 August for the annual autumn exercises. The maneuvers included a mock blockade of the coast of Mecklenburg and a pitched battle with an \\"Eastern Fleet\\" in the Danzig Bay. A severe storm, striking the fleet as it steamed back to Kiel, caused significant damage to many ships and sank the torpedo boat . The fleet then transited the Kaiser Wilhelm Canal and continued maneuvers in the North Sea. Training finished on 17 September in Wilhelmshaven. Weissenburg again won the Kaiser's (Shooting Prize) during the maneuvers. In December, I Division conducted artillery and torpedo training in Eckernf√∂rde Bay, followed by divisional training in the Kattegat and Skagerrak. During these maneuvers, the division visited Kungsbacka, Sweden, from 9 to 13 December. After returning to Kiel, the ships of I Division went into dock for their winter repairs. On 5 April 1899, the ship participated in the celebrations commemorating the 50th anniversary of the Battle of Eckernf√∂rde during the First Schleswig War. In May, I and II Divisions, along with the Reserve Division from the Baltic, went on a major cruise into the Atlantic. On the voyage out, I Division stopped in Dover and II Division went into Falmouth to restock their coal supplies. I Division then joined II Division at Falmouth on 8 May, and the two units then departed for the Bay of Biscay, arriving at Lisbon on 12 May. There, they met the British Channel Fleet of eight battleships and four armored cruisers. The German fleet then departed for Germany, stopping again in Dover on 24 May. There they participated in the naval review celebrating Queen Victoria's 80th birthday. The fleet returned to Kiel on 31 May. In July, the fleet conducted squadron maneuvers in the North Sea, which included coast defense exercises with soldiers from the X Corps. On 16 August, the fleet assembled in Danzig once again for the annual autumn maneuvers. The exercises started in the Baltic and on 30 August the fleet passed through the Kattegat and Skagerrak and steamed into the North Sea for further maneuvers in the German Bight, which lasted until 7 September. The third phase of the maneuvers took place in the Kattegat and the Great Belt from 8 to 26 September, when the maneuvers concluded and the fleet went into port for annual maintenance. The year 1900 began with the usual routine of individual and divisional exercises. In the second half of March, the squadrons met in Kiel, followed by torpedo and gunnery practice in April and a voyage to the eastern Baltic. From 7 to 26 May, the fleet went on a major training cruise to the northern North Sea, which included stops in Shetland from 12 to 15 May and in Bergen from 18 to 22 May. On 8 July, Weissenburg and the other ships of I Division were reassigned to II Division. =Boxer Rebellion= alt=A large ship at anchor with several small boats alongside During the Boxer Rebellion in 1900, Chinese nationalists laid siege to the foreign embassies in Peking and murdered Baron Clemens von Ketteler, the German minister. The widespread violence against Westerners in China led to an alliance between Germany and seven other Great Powers: the United Kingdom, Italy, Russia, Austria-Hungary, the United States, France, and Japan. Those Western soldiers in China at the time were too few in number to defeat the Boxers; in Peking there was a force of slightly more than 400 officers and infantry from the armies of the eight European powers. At the time, the primary German military force in China was the East Asia Squadron, which consisted of the protected cruisers , , and , the small cruisers and , and the gunboats and . There was also a German 500-man detachment in Taku; combined with the other nations' units, the force numbered some 2,100 men. Led by the British Admiral Edward Seymour, these men attempted to reach Peking but were forced to stop in Tientsin due to heavy resistance. As a result, the Kaiser determined an expeditionary force would be sent to China to reinforce the East Asia Squadron. The expedition included Weissenburg and her three sisters, six cruisers, ten freighters, three torpedo boats, and six regiments of marines, under the command of (General Field Marshal) Alfred von Waldersee. On 7 July, KAdm Richard von Gei√üler, the expeditionary force commander, reported that his ships were ready for the operation, and they left two days later. The four battleships and the aviso transited the Kaiser Wilhelm Canal and stopped in Wilhelmshaven to rendezvous with the rest of the expeditionary force. On 11 July, the force steamed out of the Jade Bight, bound for China. They stopped for coal at Gibraltar on 17‚Äì18 July and passed through the Suez Canal on 26‚Äì27 July. More coal was taken on at Perim in the Red Sea, and on 2 August the fleet entered the Indian Ocean. On 10 August, the ships reached Colombo, Ceylon, and on 14 August they passed through the Strait of Malacca. They arrived in Singapore on 18 August and departed five days later, reaching Hong Kong on 28 August. Two days later, the expeditionary force stopped in the outer roadstead at Wusong, downriver from Shanghai. By the time the German fleet had arrived, the siege of Peking had already been lifted by forces from other members of the Eight-Nation Alliance that had formed to deal with the Boxers. Since the situation had calmed, the four battleships were sent to either Hong Kong or Nagasaki, Japan, in late 1900 and early 1901 for overhauls; Weissenburg went to Hong Kong, with the work lasting from 6 December 1900 to 3 January 1901. From 8 February to 23 March, she stopped in German Tsingtau, where she also conducted gunnery training. On 26 May, the German high command recalled the expeditionary force to Germany. The fleet took on supplies in Shanghai and departed Chinese waters on 1 June. The ships stopped in Singapore from 10 to 15 June and took on coal before proceeding to Colombo, where they stayed from 22 to 26 June. Steaming against the monsoons forced the fleet to stop in Mah√©, Seychelles, to take on more coal. The ships then stopped for a day each to take on coal in Aden and Port Said. On 1 August they reached Cadiz, and then met with I Division and steamed back to Germany together. They separated after reaching Helgoland, and on 11 August, after reaching the Jade roadstead, the ships of the expeditionary force were visited by Admiral von Koester, who was now the Inspector General of the Navy. The following day the expeditionary fleet was dissolved. In the end, the operation cost the German government more than 100 million marks. =1901‚Äì1910= alt=A large ship steaming, black smoke belching from her funnels, with many crewmen on the decks Following her return from China, Weissenburg was taken into the drydocks at the (Imperial Dockyard) in Wilhelmshaven for an overhaul. In late 1901, the fleet went on a cruise to Norway. The pattern of training for 1902 remained unchanged from previous years; I Squadron went on a major training cruise that started on 25 April. The squadron initially steamed to Norwegian waters, then rounded the northern tip of Scotland, and stopped in Irish waters. The ships returned to Kiel on 28 May. Before the start of the annual fleet maneuvers in August, Weissenburg was involved in an accident that damaged her ram bow; to ready the ship for the exercises, wooden reinforcement beams were installed in the bow. After the maneuvers, she was decommissioned on 29 September, with the new battleship taking her place in the division. The four Brandenburg-class battleships were taken out of service for a major reconstruction. During the modernization, a second conning tower was added in the aft superstructure, along with a gangway. Weissenburg and the other ships had their boilers replaced with newer models, and also had their superstructure amidships reduced. The work included increasing the ship's coal storage capacity and adding a pair of 10.5 cm guns. The plans had initially called for the center 28 cm turret to be replaced with an armored battery of medium-caliber guns, but this proved to be prohibitively expensive. On 27 September 1904, Weissenburg was recommissioned, and replaced the old coastal defense ship in II Squadron. The two squadrons of the fleet ended the year with the usual training cruise into the Baltic, which took place uneventfully. The first half of 1905 similarly passed without incident for Weissenburg. On 12 July, the fleet began its annual summer cruise to northern waters; the ships stopped in Gothenburg from 20 to 24 July and Stockholm from 2 to 7 August. The trip ended two days later, and was followed by the autumn fleet maneuvers later that month. In December, the fleet took its usual training cruise in the Baltic. The fleet conducted its normal routine of individual and unit training in 1906, interrupted only by a cruise to Norway from mid-July to early August. The annual autumn maneuvers occurred as usual. After the conclusion of the maneuvers, Weissenburg had her crew reduced on 28 September and she was transferred to the Reserve Formation of the North Sea. She participated in the 1907 fleet maneuvers, but was decommissioned on 27 September, though she was still formally assigned to the Reserve Formation. She was reactivated on 2 August 1910 to participate in the annual maneuvers with III Squadron, though the sale of Weissenburg and Kurf√ºrst Friedrich Wilhelm to the Ottoman Empire was announced just a few days later. On 6 August, she left the squadron and departed Wilhelmshaven on the 14th in company with Kurf√ºrst Friedrich Wilhelm. They arrived in the Ottoman Empire on 1 September. In Ottoman service In late 1909, the German military attache to the Ottoman Empire had begun a conversation with the Ottoman Navy about the possibility of selling German warships to the Ottomans to counter Greek naval expansion. After lengthy negotiations, including Ottoman attempts to buy one or more of the new battlecruisers , , and , the Germans offered to sell the four ships of the Brandenburg class at a cost of 10 million marks. The Ottomans chose to buy Weissenburg and Kurf√ºrst Friedrich Wilhelm, since they were the more advanced ships of the class. The two battleships were renamed after the famous 16th-century Ottoman admirals, Turgut Reis and Hayreddin Barbarossa, respectively. They were transferred on 1 September 1910, and on 12 September the German formally struck them from the naval register, backdated to 31 July. The Ottoman Navy, however, had great difficulty equipping Turgut Reis and Barbaros Hayreddin; the navy had to pull trained enlisted men from the rest of the fleet just to put together crews for them. Both vessels suffered from condenser troubles after they entered Ottoman service, which reduced their speed to . =Italo‚ÄìTurkish War= A year later, on 29 September 1911, Italy declared war on the Ottoman Empire to seize Libya. Turgut Reis, along with Barbaros Hayreddin and the obsolete central battery ironclad had been on a summer training cruise since July, and so were prepared for the conflict. The day before Italy declared war, the ships had left Beirut, bound for the Dardanelles. Unaware that a war had begun, they steamed slowly and conducted training maneuvers while en route, passing southwest of Cyprus. While off the island of Kos on 1 October, the ships received word of the Italian attack, prompting them to steam at full speed for the safety of the Dardanelles, arriving later that night. The following day, the ships proceeded to Constantinople for a refit after the training cruise. Turgut Reis and Barbaros Hayreddin sortied briefly on 4 October, but quickly returned to port without encountering any Italian vessels. During this period, the Italian fleet laid naval mines at the entrance to the Dardanelles in an attempt to prevent the Ottoman fleet from entering the Mediterranean. Maintenance work was completed by 12 October, at which point the fleet returned to Nagara inside the Dardanelles. Since the fleet could not be used to challenge the significantly more powerful Italian (Royal Navy), Turgut Reis and Barbaros Hayreddin were primarily kept at Nagara to support the coastal fortifications defending the Dardanelles in the event that the Italian fleet attempted to force the straits. On 19 April 1912, elements of the Italian fleet bombarded the Dardanelles fortresses, but the Ottoman fleet did not mount a counterattack. The negative course of the war led many naval officers to join a coup against the Young Turk government; the officers commanding the fleet at Nagara threatened to bring the ships to Constantinople if their demands were not met. With tensions rising in the Balkans, the Ottoman government signed a peace treaty on 18 October, ending the war. =Balkan Wars= Map showing operations during the alt=A map showing the routes Serbian, Bulgarian, and Greek armies used to attack the Ottoman Empire in the Balkans After watching Italy successfully seize Ottoman territory, the Balkan League declared war on the Ottoman Empire in October 1912 to seize the remaining European portion of the Empire, starting the First Balkan War. By this time, Turgut Reis, as with most ships of the Ottoman fleet, was in a state of disrepair. Her rangefinders and ammunition hoists had been removed, the pipes for her pumps were corroded, and the telephone lines no longer worked. On 7 October, the day before the Balkan League attacked, Turgut Reis and Barbaros Hayreddin were anchored off Haydarpa≈üa, along with the cruisers and and several torpedo boats. Ten days later, the ships departed for ƒ∞ƒüneada and the two battleships bombarded Bulgarian artillery positions near Varna two days thereafter. The ships were still suffering from boiler trouble. Both battleships took part in gunnery training in the Sea of Marmara on 3 November, but stopped after firing only a few salvos each, as their main battery mountings were not fully functional. On 7 November, Turgut Reis shelled Bulgarian troops around Tekirdaƒü. On 17 November, she supported the Ottoman III Corps by bombarding the attacking Bulgarian forces. The ship was aided by artillery observers ashore. The battleship's gunnery was largely ineffective, though it provided a morale boost for the besieged Ottoman army dug in at √áatalca. By 17:00, the Bulgarian infantry had largely been forced back to their starting positions, in part due to the psychological effect of the battleships' bombardment. On 22 November, Turgut Reis sortied from the Bosporus to cover the withdrawal of Hamidiye, which had been torpedoed by a Bulgarian torpedo boat earlier that morning. Battle of Elli In December 1912, the Ottoman fleet was reorganized into an armored division, which included Barbaros Hayreddin as flagship, two destroyer divisions, and a fourth division composed of warships intended for independent operations. Over the next two months, the armored division attempted to break the Greek naval blockade of the Dardanelles, which resulted in two major naval engagements. The first, the Battle of Elli took place on 16 December 1912. The Ottomans attempted to launch an attack on Imbros. The Ottoman fleet sortied from the Dardanelles at 09:30; the smaller craft remained at the mouth of the straits while the battleships sailed north, hugging the coast. The Greek flotilla, which included the armored cruiser and three s, sailing from the island of Lemnos, altered course to the northeast to block the advance of the Ottoman battleships. The Ottoman ships opened fire on the Greeks at 09:50, from a range of about . Five minutes later, Georgios Averof crossed over to the other side of the Ottoman fleet, placing the Ottomans in the unfavorable position of being under fire from both sides. At 09:50 and under heavy pressure from the Greek fleet, the Ottoman ships completed a 16-point turn, which reversed their course, and headed for the safety of the straits. The turn was poorly conducted, and the ships fell out of formation, blocking each other's fields of fire. Around this time, Turgut Reis received several hits, though they inflicted only minor damage to the ship's superstructure and guns. By 10:17, both sides had ceased firing and the Ottoman fleet withdrew into the Dardanelles. The ships reached port by 13:00 and transferred their casualties to the hospital ship Resit Pa≈üa. Battle of Lemnos Illustration of the alt=An illustration depicting the ships of the Ottoman and Greek fleets, including several large ships and numerous smaller vessels The Battle of Lemnos resulted from an Ottoman plan to lure the faster Georgios Averof away from the Dardanelles. The protected cruiser Hamidiye evaded the Greek blockade and broke out into the Aegean Sea; the assumption was that the Greeks would dispatch Georgios Averof to hunt down Hamidiye. Despite the threat to Greek lines of communication posed by the cruiser, the Greek commander refused to detach Georgios Averof from its position. By mid-January, the Ottomans had learned that Georgios Averof remained with the Greek fleet, and so Kalyon Kaptanƒ± (Captain) Ramiz Numan Bey, the Ottoman fleet commander, decided to attack the Greeks regardless. Turgut Reis, Barbaros Hayreddin, and other units of the Ottoman fleet departed the Dardanelles at 08:20 on the morning of 18 January, and sailed toward the island of Lemnos at a speed of . Barbaros Hayreddin led the line of battleships, with a flotilla of torpedo boats on either side of the formation. Georgios Averof, with the three Hydra-class ironclads and five destroyers trailing behind, intercepted the Ottoman fleet approximately from Lemnos. At 10:55, Mecidiye spotted the Greeks, and the fleet turned south to engage them. A long-range artillery duel that lasted for two hours began at around 11:55, when the Ottoman fleet opened fire at a range of . They concentrated their fire on Georgios Averof, which returned fire at 12:00. At 12:50, the Greeks attempted to cross the T of the Ottoman fleet, but the Ottoman line led by Barbaros Hayreddin turned north to block the Greek maneuver. The Ottoman commander detached the old ironclad Mesudiye after she received a serious hit at 12:55. After Barbaros Hayreddin suffered several hits that reduced her speed to , Turgut Reis took the lead of the formation and Bey decided to break off the engagement. By 14:00, the Ottoman fleet reached the cover of the Dardanelles fortresses, forcing the Greeks to withdraw. Between Turgut Reis and Barbaros Hayreddin, the ships fired some 800 rounds, mostly of their main battery 28 cm guns but without success. During the battle, barbettes on both Turgut Reis and her sister were disabled by gunfire, and both ships caught fire. Subsequent operations On 8 February 1913, the Ottoman navy supported an amphibious assault at ≈ûark√∂y. Turgut Reis and Barbaros Hayreddin, along with two small cruisers provided artillery support to the right flank of the invading force once it went ashore. The ships were positioned about a kilometer off shore; Turgut Reis was the second ship in the line, behind her sister Barbaros Hayreddin. The Bulgarian army resisted fiercely, which ultimately forced the Ottoman army to retreat, though the withdrawal was successful in large part due to the gunfire support from Turgut Reis and the rest of the fleet. During the battle, Turgut Reis fired 225 rounds from her 10.5 cm guns and 202 shells from her 8.8 cm guns. In March 1913, the ship returned to the Black Sea to resume support of the √áatalca garrison, which was under renewed attacks by the Bulgarian army. On 26 March, the barrage of 28 and 10.5 cm shells fired by Turgut Reis and Barbaros Hayreddin assisted in the repelling of advance of the 2nd Brigade of the Bulgarian 1st Infantry Division. On 30 March, the left wing of the Ottoman line turned to pursue the retreating Bulgarians. Their advance was supported by both field artillery and the heavy guns of Turgut Reis and the other warships positioned off the coast; the assault gained the Ottomans about by nightfall. In response, the Bulgarians brought the 1st Brigade to the front, which beat the Ottoman advance back to its starting position. On 11 April, Turgut Reis and Barbaros Hayreddin, supported by several smaller vessels, steamed to √áanakkale to provide distant cover for a light flotilla conducting a sweep for Greek warships. The two sides clashed in an inconclusive engagement, and the main Ottoman fleet did not sortie before the two sides disengaged. =World War I= alt=A map of the narrow Dardanelles Strait, with coastal fortifications located on both sides of the straits, clustered at the mouth of the straits and at the narrowest point In the summer of 1914, when World War I broke out in Europe, the Ottomans initially remained neutral. In early November, the Black Sea Raid of the German battlecruiser Goeben, which had been transferred to the Ottoman navy and renamed Yavuz Sultan Selim, resulted in declarations of war by Russia, France, and Great Britain. By this time, Turgut Reis was laid up off the Golden Horn, worn out from heavy service during the Balkan Wars. Admiral , the head of the German naval mission to the Ottoman Empire, sent her and Barbaros Hayreddin to Nagara to support the Dardanelles forts. They remained on station from 14 to 19 December, before returning to Constantinople for repairs and gunnery training. On 18 February 1915, they departed for the Dardanelles and anchored in their firing positions. During this period, their engines were stopped to preserve fuel, but after the threat of British submarines increased, they kept steam up in their engines to preserve their ability to take evasive action; the steamer was moored in front of the battleships as a floating barrage. By 11 March, the high command decided that only one ship should be kept on station at a time, alternating every five days, to allow the ships to replenish stores and ammunition. On 18 March, Turgut Reis was on station when the Allies attempted to force the straits. She did not engage the Allied ships, as her orders were to open fire only in the event that the defenses were breached. This was in part due to a severe shortage of shells. On 25 April, both Turgut Reis and Barbaros Hayreddin were present to bombard the Allied troops that had landed at Gallipoli that day. At 07:30 that morning, the Australian submarine fired several torpedoes at Turgut Reis but failed to score any hits. Turgut Reis returned to Constantinople later that day as planned. While she was bombarding Allied positions on 5 June, one of Turgut Reiss forward guns exploded; four men were killed and thirty-two were wounded. She returned to Constantinople for repairs, and the navy suspended bombardment operations‚ÄîBarbaros Hayreddin having suffered a similar accident on 25 April. On 12 August, Turgut Reis was laid up at the Golden Horn after Barbaros Hayreddin was torpedoed and sunk by a British submarine. At some point in 1915, some of Turgut Reiss guns were removed and employed as coastal guns to shore up the defenses protecting the Dardanelles. On 19 January 1918, Yavuz and the light cruiser , which had also been transferred to Ottoman service under the name Midilli, sailed from the Dardanelles to attack several British monitors stationed outside. The ships quickly sank and before turning back to the safety of the Dardanelles. While en route, Midilli struck five mines and sank, while Yavuz hit three mines and began to list to port. The ship's captain gave an incorrect order to the helmsman, which caused the ship to run aground. Yavuz remained there for almost a week, until Turgut Reis and several other vessels arrived on the scene on 22 January; the ships spent four days trying to free Yavuz from the sand bank, including using the turbulence from their propellers to clear sand away from under the ship. By the morning of 26 January, Yavuz came free from the sandbank and Turgut Reis escorted her back into the Dardanelles. Turgut Reis was laid up again on 30 October 1918, and was refitted at the G√∂lc√ºk Naval Shipyard from 1924 to 1925. After returning to service, she served as a stationary training ship based at G√∂lc√ºk. At the time, she retained only two of her originally six 28 cm guns. Two main turrets were removed and installed as a part of the heavy coastal battery Turgut Reis, situated at the Asian coast of the Dardanelles Strait. Both turrets are preserved with their guns (two L/40 and two L/35). She was decommissioned in 1933 and was thereafter used as a barracks ship for dockyard workers, a role she filled until 1950, when she began to be broken up at G√∂lc√ºk. By 1953, the ship had been broken down into two sections, and these were sold to be dismantled abroad. Demolition work was finally completed between 1956 and 1957.

Each molecule shown in line- angle representation, where each angle (vertex) represents a carbon atom, and each line a bond between atoms (and where necessary hydrogen atoms to fulfill carbon's valence of four are implied). The heterocyclic spiro product, at right of arrow, is a common ketal (acetal) structure prepared from a monocyclic type of ketone and a generally acyclic type of diol (both at left of arrow). The schematic is for the synthesis of the protected 1,4-dioxaspiro[4.5]decane from cyclohexanone and the alcohol, ethanediol.

Spiro[5.5]undecane, again shown in line-angle representation and in apparent planarity, masking the actual most populated chair conformation of each ring, and their actual orthogonal orientation to one another. Spiro compounds have at least two molecular rings with only one common atom. The simplest spiro compounds are bicyclic (having just two rings), or have a bicyclic portion as part of the larger ring system, in either case with the two rings connected through the defining single common atom. The one common atom connecting the participating rings distinguishes spiro compounds from other bicyclics: from isolated ring compounds like biphenyl that have no connecting atoms, from fused ring compounds like decalin having two rings linked by two adjacent atoms, and from bridged ring compounds like norbornane with two rings linked by two non- adjacent atoms.For all four categories, see The specific chapters can be found at and , respectively, same access date. For the description featuring adjacent atoms for all but the isolated category, see Clayden, op. cit. A fully carbocyclic spiro compound. Spiropentadiene, an esoteric hydrocarbon, in a representation where all carbons and hydrogens are shown explicitly. The two cyclopropene rings are each planar, but are perpendicular to each other. Spiro compounds may be fully carbocyclic (all carbon) or heterocyclic (having one or more non-carbon atom). One common type of spiro compound encountered in educational settings is a heterocyclic one‚Äî the acetal formed by reaction of a diol with a cyclic ketone. The common atom that connects the two (or sometimes three) rings is called the spiro atom; in carbocyclic spiro compounds like spiro[5.5]undecane (see image at right), the spiro-atom is a quaternary carbon, and as the -ane ending implies, these are the types of molecules to which the name spirane was first applied (though it is now used general of all spiro compounds). Likewise, a tetravalent neutral silicon or positively charged quaternary nitrogen atom (ammonium cation) can be the spiro center in these compounds, and many of these have been prepared and described. The 2-3 rings being joined are most often different in nature, though they, on occasion, be identical [e.g., spiro[5.5]undecane, just shown, and spiropentadiene, at right]. Although sketches of organic structures makes spiro compounds appear planar, they are not; for instance, a spiro compound with a pair of three-membered cyclopropene rings connected in spiro fashion (image below) has been given the popular misnomer of being a bow tie structure, when it is not flat or planar like a bow tie. This can be stated another way, saying that the best-fit planes to each ring are often perpendicular or are otherwise non-coplanar to one another. Spiro compounds are present throughout the natural world, some cases of which have been exploited to provide tool compounds for biomedical study and to serve as scaffolds for the design of therapeutic agents with novel shapes. As well, the spiro motif is present in various practical compound types (such as dyes), as well as in a wide variety of oligo- and polymeric materials designs, for the unique shapes and properties the spiro center imparts, e.g., in the design of electronically active materials in particular. In both cases, the presence of the spiro center, often with four distinct groups attached, and with its unique aspects of chirality, adds unique challenges to the chemical synthesis of each compound type. Carbocyclic spiro compounds The Brazilian Laurencia dendroidea (red algae) sesquiterpene and halogenated carbocyclic spiro compound elatol Bicyclic ring structures in organic chemistry that have two fully carbocyclic (all carbon) rings connected through just one atom are present both in natural products, as well as in esoteric targets of chemical synthesis. The two carbocycles can be different in nature, or identical. In common targets derived from natural products, they are essentially always different. In esoteric targets, such as highly strained hydrocarbons like spiropentadiene, shown here, the rings can be identical. The atom connecting the two rings is called the spiro-atom; in carbocyclic spiro compounds, the spiro-atom is a quaternary carbon. The 11-carbon bicyclic structure shown above, spiro[5.5]undecane, is also a fully carbocyclic spiro compound. While the presentation of this structure makes it appear fully planar, it is not. The best-fit planes to each six-atom ring above is near to perpendicular, and the best-fit planes to rings of spiro compounds are likewise generally non- coplanar. For instance, the structure of faux bow tie spiropentadiene, shown above, makes clear that the planes that are defined by the atoms of each ring‚Äîi.e., the best-fit plane of each cyclopropene‚Äîare orthogonal (perpendicular) to one another. Heterocyclic spiro compounds A further example of a hetero-cyclic spiro compound, the on-market drug spironolactone, where the two 5-membered rings ring in the upper right hand corner compose a spiro ring system. One of the rings is a lactone (i.e., contains as ester functional group). Spiro compounds are considered heterocyclic if the spiro atom or any atom in either ring are not carbon atoms. Cases include the presence of a spiro heteroatom such silicon and nitrogen (but also other Group IVA [14] and other atom types) connecting the rings that have been observed or are under theoretical study; moreover, there are also many cases where one or more heteroatoms appear in one or more of the rings that are joined at a carbon spiro atom (e.g., where 1 oxygen spironolactones and 2 oxygen/2 sulfur ketals/thioketals are very common). A common case is the presence of two atoms that are not carbon in one of the rings, with those two rings both attached to the spiro atom; indeed, often the earliest exposure of a chemist in training to a spiro compound is to a heterocyclic form, the ketal (acetal) formed in the protection of ketones by diols and dithiols. An example of this is shown above, in the synthesis of the acetal 1,4-dioxaspiro[4.5]decane from cyclohexanone and ethanediol. In this case, because the four atoms attached to the spiro atom are not all carbons, the spiro atom is not a quaternary carbon. A further example of an acetal formed from a cyclic ketone, except with a dithiol, is the spiro compound spirapril, which has a five-membered ring formed from 1,2-ethanedithiol. Again, while the rings could be identical, in the heterocyclic case they are, again, almost always non-identical. Once again, the best-fit planes to each ring are generally non-coplanar to one another (i.e., the rings are not coplanar, despite appearing so in images). Polyspiro compounds A polyspiro compound is connected by two or more spiroatoms making up three or more rings. Nomenclature Two examples of spiro compound nomenclature, A. 1-bromo-3-chlorospiro[4.5]decan-7-ol, and B. 1-bromo-3-chlorospiro[3.6]decan-7-ol. Nomenclature for spiro compounds was first discussed by Adolf von Baeyer in 1900. Spiro compounds are named with the infix spiro followed by square brackets containing the number of atoms in the smaller ring, then the number of atoms in the larger ring, separated by a period, in each case excluding the spiroatom (the atom by which the two rings are bonded) itself. For example, compound A is called 1-bromo-3-chlorospiro[4.5]decan-7-ol, and compound B is called 1-bromo-3-chlorospiro[3.6]decan-7-ol.The numbering will start withban atom of the smaller ring adjacent to the spiro junction i.e. the common carbon and to reach the junction and then entering to the bigger ring from the same direction. Chirality Axially chiral enantiomers of an isomeric pair of spiro compounds. Spiranes can be chiral, in three distinct ways. First, while nevertheless appearing to be twisted, they yet may have a chiral center making them analogous to any simple chiral compound, and second, while again appearing twisted, the specific location of substiuents, as with alkylidenecycloalkanes, may make a spiro compound display central chirality (rather than axial chirality resulting from the twist); third, the substiuents of the rings of the spiro compound may be such that the only reason they are chiral arises solely from the twist of their rings, e.g., in the simplest bicyclic case, where two structurally identical rings are attached via their spiro atom, resulting in a twisted presentation of the two rings. Hence, in the third case, the lack of planarity described above gives rise to what is termed axial chirality in otherwise identical isomeric pair of spiro compounds, because they differ only in the right- versus left-handed \\"twist\\" of structurally identical rings (as seen in allenes, sterically hindered biaryls, and alkylidenecycloalkanes as well). Assignment of absolute configuration of spiro compounds has been challenging, but a number of each type have been unequivocally assigned. Some spiro compounds exhibit axial chirality. Spiroatoms can be the origin of chirality even when they lack the required four different substituents normally observed in chirality. When two rings are identical the priority is determined by a slight modification of the CIP system assigning a higher priority to one ring extension and a lower priority to an extension in the other ring. When rings are dissimilar the regular rules apply. Preparation Spiro compounds present unique preparative challenges, whether each ring contributing to its structure is unique or identical, or whether they are carbocyclic or heterocyclic‚Äîowing to the practical implications of tetra-functionalizing the central spiro atom (often with four different groups), and of the unique aspects of chirality that apply to these compounds. Specific methods Some spiro compounds can be synthesized using the Pinacol-pinacolone rearrangement; for example, spiro[5.4]decane (final compound in following two line scheme) can be synthesized from symmetric 1,2-diols of the sort shown below [e.g., this route's starting material, (1,1‚Ä≤-bicyclopentyl)-1,1‚Ä≤-diol]. Initially, one of the carbinol moieties is protonated, allowing water to leave, and yielding the corresponding carbocation (second structure, first row); this intermediate then undergoes a bond migration, resulting in ring expansion of the adjacent ring, with deprotionation unmasking the ketone functional group to complete the first line of the mechanism. This first product, a spirobicyclic ketone, is a spiro compound in its own right, and yields the further spiro carbinol and the alicyclic spiro hydrocarbon after two further reduction reactions. First, reduction of the carbonyl that ends the mechanism's first line provides the spiro carbinol starting material of the second line, which is needed for reduction to the alkane (shown). This latter reduction is accomplished using lithium aluminum hydride (LiAlH4), via the alcohol tosylate (formed using tosyl chloride). Hence this three reaction sequence provides three spiro compounds (ketone, alcohol, and alkane), of possible research or practical use. The synthesis of a spiro-keto compound form a symmetrical diol The synthesis of spiranes from the reduction of the spiro-alcohol compound Uses Spiro forms of lactones and oxazines are frequently used as leuco dyes, frequently displaying chromism‚Äîreversible structural change between forms giving rise to colorless and colored appearances, especially in solution. Spiroaromaticity Spiroaromaticity in organic chemistry refers to a special case of aromaticity in which conjugation is interrupted by a single spiroatom. Although this spiro center disrupts the continuous overlap of p-orbitals, traditionally thought to be a requirement for aromaticity, considerable thermodynamic stability and many of the spectroscopic, magnetic, and chemical properties associated with aromatic compounds are still observed for such compounds.

Education and career Peter Pershan earned his B.S. at Polytechnic Institute of Brooklyn in 1956 and his Ph.D. in Physics at Harvard University in 1960 for nuclear magnetic resonance under the supervision of Nicolaas Bloembergen. After a short postdoctoral appointment with Bloembergen he was appointed an assistant professor at Harvard University, where he is now a Frank B. Baird, Jr. Professor of Science, at both Physics Department and Division of Engineering and Applied Sciences. Research Pershan began his career in nuclear magnetic resonance; however, before moving on to other things, he and Bloembergen produced some of the first papers on non-linear optics, a field for which Bloembergen later received Nobel Prize in Physics in 1981. He remained active in this field until the early 1980s when he wrote a book on liquid crystals and moved into the then-new field of synchrotron radiation. Along with Jens Als-Nielsen, Pershan developed the first synchrotron X-ray reflectometer for the study of the horizontal free surface of a liquid, and carried out the first synchrotron measurements on liquid surfaces at HASYLAB, DESY in 1982. The liquid surface spectrometers now at Advanced Photon Source and the National Synchrotron Light Source are all variations of the HASYLAB instrument. Since 1982 Pershan has led the field in exploration of such diverse liquid surfaces as superfluid helium, water, and liquid metals.

Early years Born and raised in Fremont, Ohio, where his family had operated a clothing store for several generations, Lytle graduated from its Ross High School in 1973. University of Michigan Lytle enrolled at the University of Michigan in 1973 and played college football as a tailback and fullback for Bo Schembechler's Michigan Wolverines football teams from 1973 to 1976. As a sophomore in 1974, Lytle was the Wolverines' second leading rusher with 802 yards on 140 carries for an average of 5.7 yards per carry.(to retrieve information for a particular season, go to \\"Games & Totals by Season\\" and select the year for which statistics are to be retrieved) In 1975, he started at fullback in all 12 games, and was the again the team's second leading rusher with 1,030 yards on 193 carries (average: 5.3 yards). In his senior season in 1976, Lytle started nine games at fullback and three at tailback for the Big Ten championship team which finished the season at 10‚Äì2 and ranked third in the final AP Poll. He led the team with 1,469 rushing yards on 221 carries and 14 rushing touchdowns. A consensus first-team All-American, Lytle was third in the Heisman Trophy balloting, behind winner and During three years as a regular player at Michigan, Lytle set the school's career record with 3,307 rushing yards.

Population: 12,000 (1968). History The Dubna Volost, currently a part of Andreapol, was mentioned in the chronicles in 1489. After several wars between Moscow and Lithuania, during which the area was transferred to Lithuania and back, it was in 1508 again included to the Grand Duchy of Moscow. In the course of the administrative reform carried out in 1708 by Peter the Great, the area was included into Ingermanlandia Governorate (since 1710 known as Saint Petersburg Governorate), and in 1727 Novgorod Governorate split off. In 1772, as a result of the First Partition of Poland, Pskov Governorate was created, and the area on the right bank of the Western Dvina was included into Toropetsky Uyezd of Pskov Governorate. In 1777, Pskov Governorate was transformed into Pskov Viceroyalty, and in 1796, the viceroyalty was abolished, and Pskov Governorate was restored. Between 1810 and 1843, a spa resort was operating in Andreapol, at the time Adreyano Pole. Between 1904 and 1907, the construction of the railroad to Bologoye was completed. In 1906, the station of Andreapol was opened, and the selo of Andreapol, which included villages of Dubna, Andreyano Pole, and Gorka, was established. The name of Andreapol is an adaptation of Andreyano Pole. On August 1, 1927 Pskov Governorate was abolished, and Leningrad Oblast was established. Toropetsky Uyezd was abolished as well, and Leninsky District, with the administrative center in the selo of Khotilitsy was established. It belonged to Velikiye Luki Okrug of Leningrad Oblast. In 1928, the district center was moved to Andreapol. On June 17, 1929, the district was transferred to Western Oblast. On August 1, 1930 the okrugs were abolished, and the districts were subordinated directly to the oblast. On January 29, 1935 Kalinin Oblast was established, and Leninsky District was transferred to Kalinin Oblast. In 1938, Andreapol was granted urban-type settlement status. Between September 1941 and January 1942, during World War II, Andreapol was occupied by German troops. On August 22, 1944, the district was transferred to newly established Velikiye Luki Oblast. On October 2, 1957, Velikiye Luki Oblast was abolished, and Leninsky District was transferred back to Kalinin Oblast. In February 1963, during the abortive administrative reform by Nikita Khrushchev, Leninsky District was merged into Toropetsky District. On January 12, 1965 Andreapolsky District was established in the areas which previously belonged to Toropetsky and Ostashkovsky Districts. In 1967, Andreapol was granted town status. In 1990, Kalinin Oblast was renamed Tver Oblast. Administrative and municipal status Within the framework of administrative divisions, Andreapol serves as the administrative center of Andreapolsky District. As an administrative division, it is incorporated within Andreapolsky District as Andreapol Urban Settlement.Law #34-ZO stipulates that the borders of the settlements (administrative-territorial divisions) are identical to the borders of the urban and rural settlements (municipal divisions), and that the borders of the administrative districts are identical to the borders of the municipal districts. Law #17-ZO, which describes the borders and the composition of the municipal formations in Andreapolsky Municipal District, lists the town of Andreapol as a part and the administrative center of Andreapol Urban Settlement of that district. As a municipal division, this administrative unit also has urban settlement status and is a part of Andreapolsky Municipal District.Law #17-ZO Economy Forests cover around 70% of the district's territory. As a result of that, logging industry provides substantial revenue for the town. There is a large saw-mill plant in Andreapol as well as porcelain production. Agriculture is also of fundamental importance to the town's economy. Transportation The railway connecting Bologoye with Velikiye Luki passes Andreapol. There is infrequent passenger traffic. A paved road connecting Ostashkov with Zapadnaya Dvina via Peno runs via Andreapol. There are local roads as well. There is bus traffic in the district. Military The town is home to Andreapol air base, an important interceptor aircraft base guarding Moscow. Culture and recreation Andreapol contains three cultural heritage monuments of local significance. Two of them are monuments to soldiers fallen in World War II, and the third one is an archaeological site. There is a local museum in Andreapol.

It is assigned to the 4th Operations Group and stationed at Seymour Johnson Air Force Base, North Carolina. The 335th was constituted on 22 August 1942 as an incorporation of the No. 121 (Eagle) Squadron of the Royal Air Force, formed on 14 May 1941 as the second of three Eagle Squadrons of the Royal Air Force. These squadrons were composed of American volunteers, recruited by the RAF as a result of the heavy loss of pilots during the Battle of Britain in 1940; the volunteers were ineligible to join the USAAF. In this capacity, the squadron operated Supermarine Spitfires and Hawker Hurricanes. Its current emblem contains the head of an American Indian chief, which dates back to the original emblem of 121 Squadron RAF. Overview The \\"Chiefs\\" fly the McDonnell-Douglas (now Boeing) F-15E Strike Eagle. The squadron has an authorized strength of 24 aircraft and around 65 personnel. Its aircraft are identified by the \\"SJ\\" tail code and green fin flash. Currently the squadron provides worldwide deployable aircraft and personnel capable of executing combat missions in support of worldwide Aerospace Expeditionary Force deployments to combat areas as part of the Global War on Terrorism. The 335th is known as the \\"World's Leading MiG Killers\\" for destroying 218.5 MiGs in aerial combat. History=World War II 335th Fighter Squadron P-51DAircraft is North American P-51D-20-NA Mustang serial 44-72308. In 1942, the Royal Air Force Eagle Squadrons were turned over to the United States Army Air Forces, with No. 121 Squadron being constituted as the 335th Fighter Squadron on 22 August, activated on 12 September and the same day assigned to the 4th Fighter Group of the VIII Fighter Command. Coming into USAAF service, the squadron was re-equipped with Republic P-47 Thunderbolts and later North American P-51 Mustangs. They destroyed 262 enemy aircraft ‚Äì 165 in the air and 97 on the ground. They remained with the group until they were returned to the United States and inactivated at Camp Kilmer, New Jersey on 10 November 1945. Korea 335th FIS F-86Fs over North KoreaAircraft are North American F-86F-25-NH Sabres. Aircraft with serial 52-5346 is identifiable. After less than a year, the 335th was reactivated on 9 September 1946 at Selfridge Field, Michigan, and has remained on active duty since. In 1947, the squadron was redesignated as the 335th Fighter Squadron, Jet Propelled, as it received the new Lockheed P-80 Shooting Stars. They flew out of Andrews Air Force Base, Maryland, until 1949, when they moved to Langley Air Force Base, Virginia, and received the North American F-86 Sabre, which they took to Korea on 10 November 1950 as the 335th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron of the Fifth Air Force. By the end of the Korean War, the 335th led all squadrons with 218.5 kills (for around forty losses) and had become a part of the \\"MiG Killer\\" legend with 12 aces. Cold War The 335th remained in the Far East until 8 December 1957, when they moved to their current base at Seymour Johnson Air Force Base, North Carolina, and converted to the North American F-100 Super Sabre. Two 335th Tactical Fighter Squadron F-105B ThunderchiefsAircraft are Republic F-105B-15-RE Thunderchiefs serials 57-5797 and 57-5787. In May 1958, the squadron deployed to Eglin Air Force Base, Florida, tasked with operational testing of the new Republic F-105 Thunderchief for the next three years. In May 1959, the 335th became the first squadron in the Air Force to receive the F-105 Thunderchief, and the transition from F-100s to F-105s began. The squadron returned to Seymour Johnson AFB in November 1961. Vietnam The squadron saw action in Southeast Asia in November 1965, flying the F-105 out of Takhli Royal Thai Air Force Base, Thailand. In 1969, the 335th transitioned to the airframe its aircrew would fly for the next twenty-three years‚Äîthe McDonnell F-4 Phantom II; later this year, they briefly deployed to South Korea. In 1972, the squadron again saw action in Vietnam, from July to December, flying out of Ubon Royal Thai Air Force Base, Thailand. Later in the 1970s, they became the first operational squadron to qualify with the GBU-15 guided bomb, and in doing so, exceeded 100,000 consecutive accident-free hours. They deployed briefly to Ramstein Air Base, Germany in 1978 and 1979, for a month each time. Gulf War On 1 March 1990, in conjunction with the fifty-first change of command, the squadron's final F-4 sortie and first McDonnell Douglas F-15E Strike Eagle sortie were flown. The 335th was the second fighter squadron in the Air Force to receive the Strike Eagle. On 27 December 1990, the 335th deployed twenty-four F-15Es along with support personnel and equipment to Al Kharj Air Base in central Saudi Arabia. On the night of 16 January 1991, the 335th participated in the initial assault on Iraq, hitting communications, power networks, and airfields around Baghdad. The 335th made aerial warfare history by downing an Iraqi helicopter in the air using a laser-guided bomb. During the war, the squadron flew 1,097 combat missions over Iraq and occupied Kuwait, dropping over 4.8 million pounds of ordnance. After the war, the 335th continued to fly combat air patrol missions over Iraq and Kuwait until relieved by the 334th Fighter Squadron, departing on 24 June 1991. Since then, the 335th has returned to Southwest Asia several times; three times to Dhahran, Saudi Arabia, and twice to Doha, Qatar, as an Air Expeditionary Force. The AEF-III deployment in 1996 was the first for an Air Force unit to Doha after the Desert Storm deployment of the 614th Tactical Fighter Squadron's F-16's during 1990‚Äì1991. Modern era In January 2002, the 335th deployed to Al Jaber Air Base, Kuwait in support of Operation Southern Watch and Operation Enduring Freedom. 12 F-15Es deployed, accomplishing 500 sorties comprising 3,000 flying hours. During this time the 335th dropped almost 300 laser guided and dumb bombs, and expended 1200 rounds of 20mm ammunition. The 335th received numerous awards and accolades from Operation Enduring Freedom; four Silver Stars were awarded as well as eight Distinguished Flying Crosses. In February 2003 the 335th again deployed to Southwest Asia for Operation Iraqi Freedom. During Iraqi Freedom and Operation Southern Watch the squadron deployed 24 F-15Es, and flew 1,500 sorties, totaling 7,000 flying hours.

Dubbed Super Sid by his fans, he played 86 matches, including 29 Tests, for the All Blacks between 1967 and 1977. He represented North Auckland domestically. Early life and family Born in Kawakawa, Going was educated at Maromaku Primary School, Northland College and Church College of New Zealand. In 1962, at the age of 19, he was a missionary in Canada for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church). Going and his wife Colleen have five children, among them sons Jared Going who represented New Zealand in Sevens rugby and Milton Going who played super rugby for the Crusaders. Going is also the uncle of All Black Todd Miller and prominent adventurer Pearl Going. Of MƒÅori descent, Going affiliates to the NgƒÅpuhi and NgƒÅti Hine iwi. Career Many rate him as New Zealand's greatest running halfback, his flair and unpredictability bagging him 10 tries in test matches, and 23 in all All Black games. He was a key member of the 1972‚Äì1973 All Blacks touring side to Great Britain and Ireland, his combination with flanker and captain Ian Kirkpatrick was pivotal. The side won tests against Wales, England, and Scotland before being narrowly denied an unprecedented Grand Slam by their 10‚Äì10 draw with Ireland. He was a favourite with Northland (then North Auckland) fans during his long tenure there as halfback from 1965 to 1978, often playing alongside his brothers Ken and Brian, and in New Zealand MƒÅori sides. The brothers' speciality was a blindside triple-scissors movement, which almost gave Northland a late victory in the 1971 match against the touring British Lions. That side featured the Welsh great Gareth Edwards, whose duels with Going were a feature of the tour, which produced for the Lions their first test series victory over the All Blacks. Going was awarded the Tom French Cup for MƒÅori player of the year a record six times; earning the accolade consecutively from 1967 to 1972. Going was a member of the 1976 All Blacks touring side to South Africa, his team experiencing a heart- breaking 3‚Äì1 series loss to the Springboks. Although only a part-time goal- kicker, Going performed this task at test level because of injuries to other players. His All Black career finished during the 1977 British Lions tour, when he was replaced after the second of four scheduled test matches. In the 1977 New Year Honours, Going was appointed a Member of the Order of the British Empire, for services to rugby. He retired from first-class rugby in 1978, but continued his involvement with the game, coaching Northland secondary school teams from 1988 to 1992, and being selector‚Äìcoach of the first-class side from 1993 to 1996. In 1978, Bob Howitt wrote a biography of Going entitled Super Sid ‚Äî The Story of a Great All Black. In the 2020 Halberg Awards, Going was inducted into the New Zealand Sports Hall of Fame. LDS Church service From 2013 to 2016, Going served as president of the LDS Church's Hamilton New Zealand Temple.\\"Hamilton New Zealand Temple Presidents\\", churchofjesuschristtemples.org He had previously been a bishop in the church.

He also still holds the all-time NFL record for most rushing attempts in a game with 45. Early life Morris is from Ayer, Massachusetts where he excelled in track and field in high school, winning the Massachusetts state title in the 200m as a sophomore. Morris is the younger brother of Joe Morris who set the all-time rushing record at Syracuse University and went on to play for the New York Giants. Jamie and Joe and two brothers and two sisters grew up in Ayer. Their father, Earl Morris, a former Green Beret master sergeant in Vietnam, was a postmaster in Groton, Massachusetts. College football at Michigan=Michigan's all-time leader in all-purpose yards Morris played college football at the University of Michigan from 1984 to 1987 and broke the school's all-time rushing records in yards gained in a season (1,703 yards) and a career (4,392 yards). Though those records were broken 13 years later by Anthony Thomas, Morris still holds the U-M school record for all-purpose yards with 6,201. Morris was also the only player in Michigan history to lead the Wolverines in rushing for four years until Mike Hart did so from 2004-2007. In addition to his rushing yards, he had 99 receptions for 756 yards and 51 kickoff returns for 1,027 yards. He ranks fourth in U-M history in kickoff return yards. He also still ranks third in U-M history in rushing yards in a season and career. Morris was setting Michigan records during the same years Lorenzo White, the Big Ten's first 2,000-yard rusher, was totaling 4,887 yards for the Michigan State Spartans. Neither reached Archie Griffin's 5,589 yard total. Morris was a very versatile running back who was the first Michigan back to total over 30 receptions in a season and remains the only back to have done so twice. He continues to hold the career receptions record for running backs with 99. In 1986, Morris suffered a knee injury in a game against Florida State. He sat out a game and then came back to play against Ohio State. While he recuperated Thomas Wilcher rushed for 74 yards and two touchdowns against Wisconsin. When Morris returned, he had the best game of his college career against the Buckeyes, gaining 210 yards rushing (302 all-purpose yards) to help the Wolverines win the game and advance to the Rose Bowl. The Wolverines lost the 1987 Rose Bowl to Arizona State 22-15. Morris also holds the record for the longest run in Outback Bowl history‚Äîa 77-yard touchdown run on January 2, 1988 in a 28-24 victory over Alabama. Morris was named MVP of the game, then known as the Hall of Fame Bowl.

When Morris first arrived at Michigan, Schembechler told Morris (who stood five feet, seven inches) he was too short to play at running back. Schembechler recalled: \\"I told Jamie when we recruited him he was too small to be a running back and we wanted him for running back kicks. I did, however, promise him the chance to try to be a running back for us. Good thing I did, isn't it?\\" In his third game as a freshman, Schembechler put him in as the starting tailback, and he remained Michigan's starter at the position for four years. When asked years later about Morris' career at Michigan, Schembechler said: \\"Here's a kid who I thought would be a very fine kick-return specialist, and he ended up becoming the all-time leading ground-gainer in Michigan history. What do you know about that?\\" In a November 2007 interview with The Ann Arbor News, Morris recalled: \\"Once Coach Bo was chastising me, and (assistant coach Lloyd Carr) pointed out, 'Look at those younger players over there. He's not yelling at them, so he must think something about you.' And that held with me for a long time.\\" Morris also spoke at the memorial service held at Michigan Stadium after Schembechler's death in November 2006. While the majority of the speeches focused on how Schembechler will be remembered, Morris spoke about the things he will miss in his coach's absence. \\"I will miss having the conversations with him about the good old days,\\" he said. \\"Most importantly, I will miss hearing how much love and pride he had for Michigan - the school, the players and the fans.\\" U-M's career rushing record Michigan career rushing yards leaders: { class=\\"wikitable sortable\\" - ! width=\\"3%\\"  Rank ! width=\\"10%\\"  Name ! width=\\"5%\\"  Attempts ! width=\\"5%\\"  Net yds ! width=\\"5%\\"  Yds/Att ! width=\\"5%\\"  Touchdowns ! width=\\"3%\\"  Long ! width=\\"4%\\"  Start ! width=\\"4%\\"  End - align=\\"center\\"  1Mike Hart98349115.0396420042007 - align=\\"center\\"  2Anthony Thomas92444724.8558019972000 - align=\\"center\\"  3Jamie Morris80643925.5256819841987 - align=\\"center\\"  4Tyrone Wheatley68841786.1478819911994 - align=\\"center\\"  5Butch Woolfolk71738505.4299219781981 } U-M's single- season rushing record Michigan single-season rushing leaders: { class=\\"wikitable sortable\\" - ! width=\\"3%\\"  Rank ! width=\\"10%\\"  Name ! width=\\"5%\\"  Attempts ! width=\\"5%\\"  Net yds ! width=\\"5%\\"  Yds/Att ! width=\\"5%\\"  Year - align=\\"center\\"  1Tim Biakabutuka30318186.01995 - align=\\"center\\"  2Anthony Thomas31917335.42000 - align=\\"center\\"  3Jamie Morris28217036.01987 - align=\\"center\\"  4Chris Perry33816745.02003 - align=\\"center\\"  5Mike Hart31815624.92006 } U-M's career kickoff return yards record Michigan career kickoff return yardage leaders: { class=\\"wikitable sortable\\" - ! width=\\"3%\\"  Rank ! width=\\"10%\\"  Name ! width=\\"5%\\"  Returns ! width=\\"5%\\"  Yards ! width=\\"5%\\"  Long ! width=\\"5%\\"  Begin ! width=\\"5%\\"  End - align=\\"center\\"  1Steve Breaston8119939520032006 - align=\\"center\\"  2Anthony Carter6316066719791982 - align=\\"center\\"  3Desmond Howard4512119519891991 - align=\\"center\\"  4Jamie Morris5110278019841987 - align=\\"center\\"  5Mercury Hayes539994719921995 } Professional career Morris set Michigan's all-time rushing records, yet his smaller stature (5 feet, 7 inches) led to a fourth round draft pick during the 1988 NFL Draft by the Washington Redskins. He played three seasons from 1988-1990. His best year was 1988 when he played in all 16 games for the Redskins, and rushed for 437 yards in 126 attempts. During his career, Morris twice rushed for at least 100 yards in a game. Morris also set the NFL record for the most rushing attempts in a game with 45, in a December 17, 1988 game against the Cincinnati Bengals. The Redskins' web site describes Morris' record-setting performance as follows: \\"On the morning of Dec. 17, the Redskins had a 7-8 record coming into the season finale at Cincinnati. ... With no hope of returning to the playoffs, the Redskins gave Morris what amounted to an audition for the starting job in 1989. With only 81 carries and 285 yards for the season, the 5-7, 195-pound running back was ready for the challenge. Not only did he carry the ball a record number of times, he gained 152 yards, didn't fumble, and had the Redskins on the brink of victory in a game in which not many experts gave them a chance.\\" Despite the good showing, Morris did not win a starting job in 1989, gaining 336 yards in 124 carries for a 2.7 yard average. Morris' NFL career came to an end in 1990, when he gained only four yards in two carries for the Redskins. During Morris' NFL career, none of his teams made the playoffs, but the 1989 Redskins under Joe Gibbs were 10-6. In 1988, Gibbs used a triumvirate of running backs with Kelvin Bryant gaining 498 yards, Timmy Smith gaining 470 yards and Morris gaining 437 yards. That season Morris was the leading Redskin kickoff returner with 21 returns for 413 yards. With the New England Patriots in 1990 Morris was one of five return men (Sammy Martin, Marvin Allen, Junior Robinson, and Don Overton) with at least 10 returns for the team. Morris played one final season of professional football with the Hamilton Tiger-Cats of the Canadian Football League in 1991. Morris ran for 591 yards and caught 28 passes for 263 yards in 12 regular season games. He also returned kicks for 435 yards and scored three touchdowns on a team that struggled to a 1-13 start and finished in last place at 3-15. Life after football Morris worked for the University of Michigan Athletic Department as a Development Manager from 1998-2010. He was responsible for donor relations and facilitating the campaign to raise $100 million by 2008. In 2005, Morris hosted the U-M Football Bust put on by the U-M Club of Greater Detroit. He also hosts a popular Sunday morning sports talk show, A View From the Backfield on Sports Talk 1050 WTKA in Ann Arbor.

She lives in Santa Fe, New Mexico and grew up on the open land northeast of Gallup, New Mexico in a family where only the Navajo Language was spoken. Life and career \\"Whitehorse was born into a family whose livelihood depended largely on rearing sheep. Through herding sheep and exploring nearby ruins, she developed an interest in light affects our perception of the environment--how clouds darken canyons, sunlight illuminates small flora and fauna, and the horizon line dissolves with dusk. She was also struck by the colors that emerge from weaving and its associated activities.\\" In 1980, Whitehorse earned her Bachelor of Arts degree in painting from the University of New Mexico in Albuquerque (UNM). She earned her master's degree in art in 1982, also from UNM, majoring in printmaking and minoring in art history. Whitehorse's paintings draw upon a personal iconography, based on her reflections of her natural surroundings.

Brooklyn: Alliance Publishing, 1995:183 Whitehorse's work is deliberately apolitical.Biography. www.ewhitehorse.com (retrieved 25 Jan 09) Whitehorse credits her grandmother, a weaver, as the most influential artistic figure in her life. More generally, she also draws on Navajo methods of making dry paintings and weavings in her work. Her paintings are usually oil on paper, mounted on canvas, such as Movement, in the collection of the Honolulu Museum of Art.

Werkman; 29 April 1882 - 10 April 1945) was an experimental Dutch artist, typographer and printer. He set up a clandestine printing house during the Nazi occupation (1940‚Äì45) and was shot by the Gestapo in the closing days of the war. Life and work Werkman's magazine The Next Call, a cover designed by him in 1926 Werkman was born on 29 April 1882 in Leens, in the province of Groningen. He was the son of a veterinary surgeon who died while he was young, after which his mother moved the family to the city of Groningen. In 1908, he established a printing and publishing house there that at its peak employed some twenty workers. Financial setbacks forced its closure in 1923, after which Werkman started anew with a small workshop in the attic of a warehouse. Werkman was a member of the artists' group De Ploeg (\\"The Plough\\"), for whom he printed posters, invitations and catalogues. From 1923 to 1926, he produced his own English- named avant-garde magazine The Next Call, which, like other works of the period, included collage-like experimentation with typefaces, printing blocks and other printers' materials. He would distribute the magazine by exchanging it for works by other avant-garde artists and designers abroad and so kept in touch with progressive trends in European art. Among the most fruitful contacts were with Theo van Doesburg, Kurt Schwitters, El Lissitzky and Michel Seuphor, the last of whom exhibited a print of his in Paris.Jan Martinet This exchange would prove very fruitful, as foreign magazines served as a source of inspiration for Werkman - as he himself admitted, even though he did not always understand the contents, Werkman searched for new ideas on the pages of the magazines he received. A 'typestract' by H.N. Werkman, 1923‚Äì9 Such contact was vital while Werkman was building up his business and could not leave Groningen. In 1929 he was able to visit Cologne and Paris, after which he developed a new printing method, applying the ink roller directly to the paper and then stamping to achieve unique effects on a simple handpress.Martinet, p. 47 The more complex of these required some fifty handlings in and out of the press and could take a whole day to complete.Anna E. C. Simoni, \\"Hendrik Nicolaas Werkman and the Werkmaniana in the British Library\\", British Library Journal 1975, p. 72 Another of his experimental techniques was the painstaking production of abstract designs using the typewriter, which he called tiksels.Examples are available in Groningen Museum's Werkman archive After 1929 he also began writing rhythmic sound poems.H. N. Werkman, Typographies and Poems, pp. 10‚Äì11 In May 1940, soon after the German invasion of the Netherlands, Werkman started a clandestine publishing house, De Blauwe Schuit (\\"The Blue Barge\\"), which ran to forty publications, all designed and illustrated by Werkman. Included there were a series of Hassidic stories from the legend of the Baal Shem Tov. On 13 March 1945, the Gestapo arrested Werkman, executing him by firing squad along with nine other prisoners in the forest near Bakkeveen on 10 April, three days before Groningen was liberated. Many of his paintings and prints, which the Gestapo had confiscated, were lost in the fire that broke out during the battle over the city.Purvis, pp. 23‚Äì6 Heritage Werkman is buried in the Bakkeveen cemetery. There is now a monument commemorating the ten who were shot then, and another to him at the village where he was born. In 1992 the Dutch director Gerrard Verhage filmed an hour-long dramatized documentary about Werkman's last days, Ik ga naar Tahiti, (I‚Äôm going to Tahiti, 1992).IMDb The Bakkeveen monument Just before World War II the museum director Willem Sandberg, who was originally trained as a typographer, had paid Werkman a visit and even arranged for him a small solo exhibition in Amsterdam in 1939. Immediately after the war he put on a retrospective at the Stedelijk Museum and laid the foundation for its large collection of Werkman's work. He also wrote a tribute to his friend, ‚Äúa man with a craving for freedom manifest in his way of life, expressed in his work, who became an artist at the moment he was economically broken, deserted by everybody, considered a freak ‚Äì at that moment he created a world of his own, warm, vivid and vital.‚ÄùHarvard Library Bulletin, 18.4, 1970; reprinted in H. N. Werkman, Typographies and Poems, pp. 2‚Äì3 A later tribute to his example was paid in an American monograph devoted to his work: ‚ÄúSince Werkman‚Äôs death an awareness of his relevance to contemporary graphic design has steadily emerged, and his work has lost nothing of its richness, spirit and optimism.‚ÄùPurvis, p. 26 In 1983 Werkman‚Äôs former warehouse premises were converted into workshops and the building was then named after him. In the city museum's graphic department there is a workshop displaying his printing equipment. In 1999 the H.N. Werkman Foundation was set up to promote awareness of his work and its large collection of prints, drawings, paintings and letters was transferred on permanent loan to the Groninger Museum.Much of the information for this section is taken from the article on Dutch Wikipedia One of the main municipal secondary schools in the city was later named the H.N.

The plays, Tenants and Disengaged, had failed to be produced, so James put them out in book form with a rueful preface about his inability to get the plays onto the stage. Plot summaries Based on a short story Flavien: Sc√®nes de la vie contemporaine by Henri Rivi√®re, Tenants tells of a widowed Englishman, Sir Frederick Byng, his son Norman, and his ward Mildred Stanmore. Norman and Mildred are in love, but Sir Frederick disapproves and forces his son to take a post in India. Meanwhile, Sir Frederick's former mistress, the long-widowed Eleanor Vibert, rents his lodge at Clere, near the family house. Eleanor brings along her son Claude, who (unknown to himself) is the illegitimate child of Sir Frederick. After many complications including some minor fisticuffs, Mildred and the returned Norman will marry, Claude learns the truth about his parentage and forgives his mother, and Eleanor refuses Sir Frederick's offer of marriage. Mildred embraces Eleanor to close the play on a bittersweet note. The other play published in this book, Disengaged, was based on James' own story, The Solution. At Brisket Place, forty miles outside London, a naive army captain, Llewellyn Prime, is made to believe that he has compromised Blandina Wigmore and must propose to her. He does so and is accepted. Many entrances and exits and much other stage business follow. Eventually, the youthful widow Mrs. Jasper gets Prime out of his engagement to Blandina and then accepts his marriage proposal. She was one of the plotters who had got him to propose to Blandina in the first place, but she quickly repented of her folly. Meanwhile, Blandina accepts Percy Trafford, who was also one of those who got Prime into the original mess, but regretted it soon afterwards. Key themes The best part of the book may be James' brief but witty introduction, where he tells of his failure to get these two plays onto the stage. He barely consoles himself with the publication of the plays in book form: \\"The covers of the book may, in a seat that costs nothing, figure the friendly curtain, and the legible lines the various voices of the stage; so that if these things manage at all to disclose a picture or to drop a tone into the reader's ear the ghostly ordeal will in a manner have been passed and the dim footlights faced.\\" Compared to this discussion the plays themselves seem artificial and way too busy. Tenants is probably the better of the two thanks to Eleanor Vibert, who faces the secrets of her past and overcomes them. The incessant comings and goings of Disengaged mostly dissipate any interest the play might have generated. Based on the hopelessly outmoded idea of a \\"compromised\\" woman and far too encumbered with frenetic stage business, Disengaged collapses under James' misguided efforts to keep things lively. Ironically, the play did get a couple performances in New York in 1902 and 1909. It received scathing reviews as \\"nerveless, heartless, soulless\\" and \\"fantastic nonsense.\\" Critical evaluation It would be an Everest-sized understatement to say that James' plays have gotten bad notices from critics. Some have gone so far as to recommend would-be readers of James to skip the plays altogether, or at most to approach them gingerly after reading just about everything else he wrote. Deprived of the interior monologue and intense analysis of consciousness that James made such a large part of his fiction, the plays in this book do seem superficial and unconvincing compared to his narratives. Although James fell under the spell of the theater from an early age, he never mastered the art of presenting vibrant characters and significant drama in dialogue-only form.

Although Nigro was not a member of the state legislature, and so had not voted on the pay increase, executive and legislative elections would not be held until the following year, and so the public voiced its displeasure by denying retention to Justice Nigro. Nigro received strong support from southeastern Pennsylvania and his native Philadelphia, but met strong opposition in southwestern and southcentral Pennsylvania where anger over the pay raise was greatest. Nigro has since been presiding over Real Estate Tax Appeals in The City at a salary of $70,000 for what the Philadelphia Inquirer calls a \\"Part Time job\\".

It is written in three movements, lasts about 30 minutes, and constitutes the last stage and a crowning achievement of the folkloristic style in Lutos≈Çawski's work. That style, inspired by the music of the Kurpie region, went back in him to the pre-1939 years. Having written a series of small folkoristic pieces for various instruments and their combinations (piano, clarinet with piano, chamber ensemble, orchestra, human voice with orchestra), Lutos≈Çawski decided to use his experience of stylisation of Polish folklore in a bigger work. However, the Concerto for Orchestra differs from Lutos≈Çawski's earlier folkloristic pieces not only in that it is more extended, but also that what is retained from folklore is only melodic themes. The composer moulds them into a different reality, lending them new harmony, adding atonal counterpoints, turning them into neo-baroque forms. The score calls for a large orchestra consisting of three flutes (two doubling piccolo), three oboes (one doubling cor anglais), three clarinets (one doubling bass clarinet), three bassoons (one doubling contrabassoon), four horns, four trumpets, four trombones, tuba, timpani, snare, tenor and bass drum, cymbals, tambourine, tam-tam, xylophone, bells, celesta, two harps, piano and strings. The three movements are: #Intrada: Allegro maestoso ‚Äî a sort of extended two-subject overture beginning in 9/8 on an ostinato drum beat more threatening, if anything, than that which begins the Brahms First Symphony. #Capriccio notturno ed Arioso: Vivace ‚Äî the Capriccio is an airy, virtuoso scherzo, the main subject of which is intoned by the violin, followed by the remainder of the strings and woodwinds. It is followed by an expressive Arioso initiated by the brass section. The reprisal of the capriccio is intoned by the cellos and harp, the theme bowed, then with pizzicato. It is concluded with the ominous rumblings of the drums, double-basses and bass clarinet. #Passacaglia, Toccata e Corale: Andante con moto ‚Äî Allegro giusto ‚Äî in three sections: the Passacaglia being a set of variations on a brooding theme played by the double-basses; followed by a vivacious and dynamic Toccata; and the (instrumental) Corale. The Corale's second appearance produces a solemn finale for the monumental construction, the material for which is borrowed from a nineteenth-century collection compiled by the Polish ethnologist Oskar Kolberg. The concerto finishes with a dramatic flourish and climax from the whole orchestra. The work was first performed in Warsaw on 26 November 1954, and was responsible for making Lutos≈Çawski's name recognised in the West. However, once Lutos≈Çawski embarked on a style marked by heavy aleatoricism in the early 1960s, he attempted to distance himself from the Concerto for Orchestra, though he conducted it in Copenhagen in August 1967 upon receiving a $10,000 prize from a Danish foundation.

It is listed as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List in view of its presumed large population, occurrence in many protected areas, apparent tolerance to some degree of habitat modification and hunting pressure.  Characteristics  The back- striped weasel is distinguished from all other Mustela species by the presence of a narrow, silvery dorsal streak extending from the occiput almost to the root of the tail, with a corresponding yellowish ventral streak from the chest along the abdomen. The general colour of the dorsal surface varies from deep to paler chocolate brown, sometimes a little paler on the head and usually slightly darkened along the side of the dorsal streak. The tail and limbs are of the same hue as the back. The upper lip from the rhinarium, the chin and the throat up to the level of the ears are pale varying from whitish to ochreous. On the hind throat and fore chest, the pale hue gradually narrows in extent, and is quite narrow between the forelegs, where it passes into the ventral streak, which expands on the inguinal region between thighs. The pads of the feet are well developed, the plantar ads being four-lobed, with the area around them entirely naked. The bushy tail is rather long, being more than half the length of the head and body. The length of head and body of males is , while the tail length is . A live-captured juvenile male was estimated to weigh only .  Distribution and habitat  The occurrence of the stripe-backed weasel has been confirmed from scattered localities in and around northeastern India, northern and central Myanmar, southern China, northern Thailand, northern and central Laos and Vietnam at an altitude range from sea level to . In India, it has been recorded from Dampa in 1994, and in Namdapha National Park.Datta, A. (1999). Small Carnivores in two Protected Areas of Arunachal Pradesh. Journal of the Bombay Natural History Society 96: 399‚Äì404.  Ecology and behavior  Little has been recorded of this weasel's habitats and habits. It has been found in a wide variety of habitats, and it is not yet possible to define its habitat needs. Specimens collected came from dense hill jungle, hill evergreen forest, disturbed evergreen forest, lower montane evergreen forest and lowland evergreen forest. Most field sightings were in daylight. In the Naga Hills, one was seen fighting with a large bandicoot rat.  Threats The back-striped weasel is potentially threatened by snares placed in its habitat, which target small edible wildlife.  Conservation  The back-striped weasel is protected in Thailand and nationally listed as Endangered in China.

Ancient Greek gravestone of a woman bearing arm rings in the shape of snake, 100 BCE. An arm ring, also known as an armlet or an armband, is a band of metal, usually a precious metal, worn as jewelry or an ornament around the biceps of the upper arm. The arm ring is similar to a bracelet or bangle, though it must be shaped and sized to fit snugly to the upper arm. Historically, the arm ring was commonly worn by men, and often a \\"ring\\" in Bronze-Age heroic literature would refer to an arm ring, rather than a finger ring. Modern-day arm rings are generally fashion accessories worn by women. In Indonesia, an arm ring is called kelat bahu; it is commonly used by both men and women as traditional jewelry in Javanese, Sundanese, and Balinese traditional costumes, worn usually in wedding ceremony or in traditional dance. The decorative arm rings are usually made of metals such as gold, silver, or brass, and can trace their history from the Indonesian Hindu-Buddhist past of ancient Java. Sri Lankan history notes that brides wore armlets to ward off ill luck. However, the armlet can be more eye-catching when it is made of gold or silver and is studded with gems. Men in ancient Sri Lanka also wore the jewellery, and Kandyan drummers can be seen wearing the jewellery as a tradition even today. Women wear arm rings ('Vangi' in Tamil ‡Æµ‡Æô‡Øç‡Æï‡Æø) for special occasions like weddings and the Bharatanatyam dance.

The primary engineering input came from Porsche, who was developing a similar V6 before selling the engineering to Ford, and Cosworth, who helped with cylinder head manufacturing. The Jaguar AJ-V6 engine is similar but adds variable valve timing.  2.5 L  The Duratec 25 is a 2.5 L (2544 cc) 60¬∞ V6 and was introduced in 1994. It was developed for the Ford Contour and also used in the Ford Mondeo and others. Bore and stroke is . The Duratec 25 was on the Ward's 10 Best Engines list for 1995 and 1996, and the SVT version made the list for 1998 and 1999.  SVT  An SVT version produced and in 1998. It included a larger throttle body from the Duratec 30, a new cone-shaped air filter, and abrasive flow machining processing on the intake manifold. SVT specific cams, a lighter flywheel and low-restriction exhaust complete the picture. Further improvements were made in 1999 that raised power output to and and were carried over in the 2000 model. The SVT engine was used in the 1998 to 2000 European Ford Mondeo and called the ST200, it also appeared in the American Ford Contour SVT. Duratec 2.5l The Duratec 2.5L V6 DOHC 24 valve engine had at 6,250 rpm and of torque at 4250 rpm. Used in the third generation Ford Mondeo and last generation Mercury Cougar (1999-2002).

However, they reduced the size from to keep under a 2.5 L tax cap in Japan. This was accomplished with a reduction of the bore from to . The engine produced at 6250 rpm and of torque. It was replaced in 2002 with the larger 3.0 L Duratec 30-based Mazda AJ.  3.0 L  Ford's standard DOHC V6 is known as the Duratec 30. It was introduced in 1996 as a replacement for the 3.8 L Essex engine in the Ford Taurus and Mercury Sable. It has of displacement and produces between and . The same engine is used by the Jaguar S-Type, Lincoln LS, Mazda MPV, Mazda6, Mondeo ST220 and many other Ford vehicles. It is essentially a bored-out to Duratec 25 and is built in Ford's Cleveland Engine #2 plant. A slightly modified version for the Ford Five Hundred entered production at the Cleveland Engine #1 plant in 2004. It has an aluminum engine block and aluminum DOHC cylinder heads. The cylinders are lined with cast iron. It uses sequential fuel injection, has 4 valves per cylinder and features fracture-split forged powder metal connecting rods and an assembled cast aluminum intake manifold. The , V6 used in the Mondeo ST220 is called the Duratec ST. The , V6 in the Mondeo Titanium is called the Duratec SE. There are two key versions of the Duratec 30: * DAMB - The Jaguar AJ30 versions have direct-acting mechanical bucket (DAMB) tappets. Output is at 6750 rpm with of torque at 4500 rpm. * RFF - The Taurus/Sable/Escape version used roller finger followers (RFF) instead and produced at 5900 rpm with of torque at 4400 rpm.

The VVT is a RFF engine derived from the Mazda MZI and does not have the mechanical buckets as on the Lincoln LS version. The engine has an output of at 6250 rpm, and of torque at 4800 rpm. In second generation of the engine, it is updated to run on E85. Engine has an output of at 6550 rpm and at 4300 rpm while running on 87 octane gasoline, and at 6250 rpm and at 4150 rpm. To achieve this, the engine now includes Cam Torque Actuated Variable Cam Timing developed with BorgWarner. Fuel saving features include adaptive knock control and aggressive deceleration fuel cutoff.

The older Duratec 30 remained as a step up from the base I4 in the Fusion, but the Milan kept the as its sole V6 until it was discontinued for the 2011 model year. Eventually, the Duratec 30 was discontinued in favor of the newer Duratec 35 and its variants. Other applications A Twin-turbocharged version of this engine is used in the Noble M400, a British sports car. The engine is rebuilt and tuned to a max power of at 6500 rpm, with a torque figure of at 5000 rpm. Noble has used forged pistons, an oil cooler, a larger baffled oil sump and extra cooling ducts to maintain its durability. . The 2015 Rossion Q1 is also powered by the Duratec V6, developing a maximum power of at 4700 rpm, with a torque figure of at 4700 rpm.(Q1 Specs) It has a weight-to-power ratio of /hp. As with the Noble M400, the Q1 uses a transversely-mounted, rear mid-engine, rear-wheel drive layout, twin-turbocharged engine. Mazda's MZI version adds variable valve timing, as does Jaguar's AJ30. Note that the MZI name is also used in Europe on Mazda's version of the Ford Sigma I4. The , V6 used in the Mondeo ST220 is called Duratec ST. V6 in the Mondeo Titanium is called Duratec SE. A racing version of this engine exists and is used on mini prototypes like the Juno SS3 V6. It is a naturally aspirated non variable timing engines producing between with a redline of around 8700 rpm. The engine has a 40-hour racing life span before it needs to be rebuilt with rings and bearings, and has proven very reliable and competitive. The engine has a Jaguar badge, and is branded as a Jaguar V6 since it is built and mostly sold in the U.K. 3.4 L SHO V8 Ford's 3.4 L SHO V8 is related to the 2.5 L Duratec V6. Each cylinder uses the same bore and stroke as the 2.5 L, but this engine was never officially referred to with the Duratec name.  5.9 L V12  Ford's 5.9 L V12 version of its Duratec engine is used in the present Aston Martin lineup. It is best thought of as two Duratec V6s mated end to end, albeit with slightly larger main journals.

On the one hand, various cultures are incorporating impulses from each other and becoming more alike.

He was originally signed by the San Jose SaberCats of the Arena Football League as an undrafted free agent in 2002. He played college football at San Jos√© State. He has also played for the Chicago Bears and Detroit Lions. Early years Davis was born in Los Angeles, California and attended John F. Kennedy High School in Granada Hills, Los Angeles. Unlike most other football players on the team, Davis had not played organized football prior to his sophomore year in high school. He did not start a single game in high school, and spent most of the time on the bench. He later attended West Los Angeles College, where he played football as wide receiver and defensive back for the college's team. He was the team's most productive player as a junior. He later finished his collegiate career at San Jose State. In 2004, Davis was a running backs coach at West Valley College in Saratoga, California. Davis earned his B.A. in sociology from San Jose State in 2006. Professional career=San Jose SaberCats Davis signed with the San Jose SaberCats of the Arena Football League (AFL) in 2002 and played as a wide receiver and cornerback. Davis missed much of the SaberCats' 2002 ArenaBowl championship season due to injury and joined the team practice squad after recovery. Davis debuted professionally in 2003 with the SaberCats. His best years came in 2004 and 2005, in which Davis emerged as one of the team's most productive players, posting a team leading 1,785 all-purpose yards. In 2005, Davis scored 44 touchdowns and 264 points as a return specialist and wide receiver. He caught 100 passes for 1,420 yards and 30 touchdowns, which was a franchise record, and also scored eight rushing touchdowns. Davis's feats earned him recognition as the team's most valuable player and offensive player of the year. First stint with Bears Despite his success in the AFL, Davis ventured into the National Football League in hopes of finding a new career. He tried out for the San Francisco 49ers, but failed to make the team. The Oakland Raiders planned to offer Davis a contract, but later retracted their offer. The Chicago Bears finally signed Davis to a contract in 2005. He initially started his career as a cornerback, but was converted into a wide receiver with two interceptions before the 2006 season. Davis had to work very hard to adapt to the rigors of being an NFL wide receiver. Rex Grossman, then the team's starting quarterback, claimed Davis was one of the team's hardest workers in the 2006 offseason.http://www.chicagobears.com/articles/articlesNewsDetail.jsp?id=16004 Despite being overshadowed by more experienced wide receivers like Muhsin Muhammad, Bernard Berrian, and Mark Bradley, he proceeded to stun critics and skeptics by emerging as one of the Bears' most productive assets in the 2006 preseason, including a 100-yard touchdown return on August 18, 2006. His preseason success earned him a spot on the Bears' starting roster, making him one of the three receivers in a regular three wide receiver set. During the 2006 season, Davis amassed 303 yards for two touchdowns on 22 receptions. He made many clutch receptions during the season; catching a game-winning touchdown against the Minnesota Vikings during week three, and later an overtime reception that set up a game-winning field goal in week fourteen against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. Arguably, his most important catch came in the Divisional Round of the 2006 playoffs, when he caught another overtime pass that set up the game's winning field goal, allowing the Bears to advance to the NFC Championship. After the Bears won the NFC Championship over the New Orleans Saints, Davis caught one pass for 2 yards and returned one kick for 15 yards in Super Bowl XLI. Davis only caught 17 passes during the 2007 season, and primarily played on the Bears special teams unit. A restricted free agent in the 2008 offseason, Davis signed his one-year, $1,927,000 tender offer on April 18. Davis caught a career-high 35 passes, for 445 yards and 2 touchdowns. At one point during the 2008 season, the Bears were prepared to use Davis as a reserve cornerback due to several injuries in their secondary. During the 2009 preseason, Davis was locked in fierce competition with Devin Aromashodu and Brandon Rideau for a spot on the team's final 53-man roster. Despite only catching three passes during the entire preseason, Davis, a key special teams contributor, beat out Rideau for the final wide receiver spot. Davis only recorded five receptions during the entire 2009 season, and spent most of his time on special teams. Davis continued to be a regular member of the Bears special teams in 2010. He finished the 2010 season with nine receptions, for 84 yards and one touchdown. Detroit Lions On July 29, 2011, Davis signed with the Detroit Lions, where he was expected to see most of his playing time on special teams while also adding depth at the wide receiver position.Detroit Lions sum up first official practice: 'Crisp' MLive.com July 29, 2011 During a 2011 game against the Green Bay Packers on Thanksgiving, Davis filled in at cornerback, as the Lions had suffered a rash of injuries in the secondary. It was the first time he had played the position since 2005, as a player for the Bears. He finished the game with two tackles. Davis finished the 2011 season with four receptions, seven tackles, and two kick returns. Chicago Bears (second stint) On August 6, 2012, Davis signed a one-year contract with the Bears after Devin Thomas retired. On August 29, Davis was waived by the team. Second stint with SaberCats On July 25, 2013, Davis was assigned to the SaberCats. In the SaberCats' final regular season game on July 27, a 65‚Äì40 win over the Chicago Rush, Davis returned one kick for 17 yards.http://www.thestatguys.com/AFL/2013/SJS0727.HTM On July 29, the SaberCats placed Davis on injured reserve.http://www.arenafootball.com/teams/aflsbc/ Personal life He has a wife named Dianna, a daughter named Alanna Lilly, and a son named Eli Rashied.

South of Blackett Street, Northumberland Street ends at the junction with Pilgrim Street which runs to the Tyne Bridge. From the opening of the bridge in 1928 until the opening of the Tyne Tunnel in 1967, Northumberland Street was part of the A1 between London and Edinburgh. It is now pedestrianised. Until 1999, the most northerly section of Northumberland Street from Northumberland Road onwards was still open to traffic and a busy bus route, which led to the shops in this part of the street being much less popular than those farther south. This section is now pedestrianised in keeping with the remainder of the street. However, some electronic maps still show this part as an accessible road.

It is a small village with about 50 houses. It also has a shop, a caf√© and heritage centre, known as the Fish Mart; the Stronsay Hotel, with attached pub; a post office, a fisherman's pier and a ferry pier. History Whitehall is a former boom town, whose historical growth and decline has been linked to that of the herring industry, which was initially developed by the Dutch. It takes its name from a house built in the 1670s by Patrick Fea, a retired privateer, whose descendant John Fea pioneered the kelp burning industry on the island in 1722. The fall of the herring industry came with overfishing, and the outbreak of World War II. There was also a similar decline during World War I, but a brief rebirth in the interbellum. Until then it had been the biggest herring port in the northern Orkney Islands, trading mainly with the Baltic ports. At its height, 300 boats were moored in Whitehall harbour, along with fifteen curing stations, and 1500 fish wives. Many of the population were itinerant. As a side effect, there were forty pubs here in the high season, and many houses took lodgers. The wealth can be seen in the large houses which still dominate the town. Aside from herring fishing and kelp burning, there was also a smaller industry in occasional whaling. Fifty whales were once driven into nearby Mill Bay for oil, in a move similar to the Faroese grindadr√°p.

The unicity system replaced the two-tier metropolitan system established in 1960.

Known primarily for catching and playing all three outfield positions, Bieser batted from the left side and threw with his right hand. He was tall and weighed 170 pounds. Bieser is currently Head Coach at the University of Missouri in Columbia, Missouri. Amateur career Bieser was not highly regarded as a prospect when he graduated from high school, where he played for the Ste. Genevieve Dragons, and after graduation he enrolled at Jefferson College, a junior college in Missouri. Jefferson's coach David Oster enjoyed a good reputation as an instructor, having coached seven players who made the Major Leagues (including Bieser) and having been selected to the National Junior College Baseball Hall of Fame in 2005 . One season at Jefferson College and one season at Mineral Area College under Hal Loughary helped Bieser improve enough to make the team at Southeast Missouri State University. Professional career After the end of Bieser's college career, the Philadelphia Phillies chose him in the 32nd round of the 1989 June draft, with the 818th overall pick. Very few players chosen that low in the draft advance to the major leagues, but Bieser defied the odds. He advanced to AAA within the Phillies' organization, and after signing with the New York Mets as a six-year minor league free agent, made his major league debut on April 1, 1997. Bieser appeared in 47 games with the Mets that year, chiefly as a bench player. His left-handed bat, above-average foot speed, and ability to play multiple positions helped him stay on the roster for a large portion of the season, as these traits afforded manager Bobby Valentine an unusual variety of tactical options. As a further testament to his versatility as a player, Bieser also filled in as a pitcher in minor league games during at least six different seasons . At the end of the year, he signed with the Pittsburgh Pirates as a free agent, and in 1998 he appeared in 13 games with that franchise. He finished his major league career with a .250 batting average, a .351 on-base percentage, and a .300 slugging percentage in 80 at bats. Continuing to play professionally after the end of his time in the majors, Bieser last appeared in uniform as a player with the Memphis Redbirds in 2001. Coaching career After his last game as a player, Bieser has become a high school baseball coach at St. John Vianney High School, a private Catholic school in Kirkwood, Missouri. His squad won the state championship in 2004. His team has again claimed the state championship in 2006. As of 2009 Steve Bieser was 117‚Äì42 in 6 seasons with the Vianney Griffins. Bieser also worked at the school as a math teacher. He left the position in 2010 for an assistant coaching position at Southeast Missouri State, where he was named the head coach prior to the 2013 season. In 2009, Bieser was the manager of the Danville Dans, a team in the collegiate Prospect League.http://www.prospectleague.com/story3.pdf Bieser coached the Southeast Missouri State Redhawks from 2013‚Äì16, leading them to 3 consecutive first- place finishes in the Ohio Valley Conference.

Bach composed the cantata in his second year as in Leipzig and first performed it on 22 April 1725. It is the first of nine cantatas on texts by Christiana Mariana von Ziegler, which Bach composed at the end of his second annual cycle of cantatas in Leipzig. Based on the Gospel reading from the Farewell Discourse, where Jesus, announcing that he will leave, says \\"your sorrow shall be turned into joy\\", Bach contrasts music of sorrow and joy, notably in the unusual first movement, where he inserts an almost operatic recitative of Jesus in the fugal choral setting. The architecture of the movement combines elements of the usual concerto form with the more text-related older form of a motet. Bach scores an unusual flauto piccolo (descant recorder in D) as an obbligato instrument in an aria contemplating the sorrow of missing Jesus, who is addressed as a doctor who shall heal the wounds of sins. Bach scores a trumpet in only one movement, an aria expressing the joy about the predicted return of Jesus. The cantata in six movements closes with a chorale, the ninth stanza of Paul Gerhardt's hymn \\"\\".  History and words  Bach composed the cantata in Leipzig for the Third Sunday after Easter, called Jubilate. The prescribed readings for the Sunday were from the First Epistle of Peter, \\"Submit yourselves to every ordinance of man\\" (), and from the Gospel of John, Jesus announcing his second coming in the so-called Farewell Discourse, saying \\"your sorrow shall be turned into joy\\" (). For this occasion Bach had already composed in 1714 , which he used later as the basis for the movement in his Mass in B minor. In his second year in Leipzig, Bach composed chorale cantatas between the first Sunday after Trinity and Palm Sunday, but for Easter he returned to cantatas on more varied texts, possibly because he lost his librettist. Nine of his cantatas for consecutive occasions in the period between Easter and Pentecost are based on texts by Christiana Mariana von Ziegler, this one being the first of the series especially written for Bach. He had possibly commissioned them in 1724 for his first cantata cycle but not composed them at that time, because of his exceptional workload in creating the St John Passion. The librettist begins with a quotation from the Gospel, verse 20, and concludes with the ninth stanza of Paul Gerhardt's hymn \\"\\" (1653). Her own poetry reflects, in a sequence of recitatives and arias, in two movements sadness at the loss of Jesus, and in two others joy at his predicted return. Bach edited her writing considerably, for example in movement 4, excising two lines of four and rephrasing the others. Bach first performed the cantata on 22 April 1725 with the Thomanerchor. For later performances, he revised the instrumentation, replacing the flauto piccolo by a flauto traverso.  Scoring and structure  The size of a D-descant recorder (sixth flute) is between the two smallest ones illustrated here. The cantata in six movements is scored for three vocal soloists (alto, tenor and bass), a four-part choir, trumpet, flauto piccolo (descant recorder in D), two oboes d'amore, two violins, viola and continuo. # Chorus and arioso (bass): # Recitative (tenor): # Aria (alto): # Recitative (alto): # Aria (tenor): # Chorale:  Music  The cantata begins in B minor, illustrating sorrow, but in movement 4 shifts to the relative major key of D major, illustrating the theme of consolation in Ziegler's text. The opening chorus has an unusual structure, which includes an arioso passage for the bass voice. All instruments except the trumpet play a ritornello, after which a choral fugue pictures the weeping and wailing of the text in unrelated musical material, rich in chromaticism. In great contrast the following line, \\"\\" (But the world will rejoice), is conveyed by the chorus embedded in a repeat of the first part of the ritornello. The sequence is repeated on a larger scale: this time the fugue renders both lines of the text as a double fugue with the second theme taken from the ritornello, then the ritornello is repeated in its entirety. The bass as the vox Christi (voice of Christ) sings three times, with a sudden tempo change to adagio, \\"\\" (But you will be sad) as an accompagnato recitative. Musicologist Julian Mincham notes: \\"This recitative is a mere eight bars long but its context and piteousness give it enormous dramatic impact. Bach's lack of respect for the conservative Leipzig authorities' dislike of operatic styles in religious music was never more apparent!\\" Klaus Hofmann compares the recitative's \\"highly expressive melody and harmony\\" to Bach's Passions. Finally, the extended sequence of fugue and ritornello with chorus returns transposed, on the text \\"\\" (Yet your sorrow shall be changed into joy). According to Alfred D√ºrr, the architecture of the movement is a large scale experiment combining elements of the older style of a text-related motet with the form of a concerto of instrumental groups and voices, as typically used by Bach. John Eliot Gardiner, 2007 John Eliot Gardiner, who conducted the Bach Cantata Pilgrimage with the Monteverdi Choir in 2000, notes that Bach's \\"strategy is to superimpose these opposite moods, binding them in a mutually enlightening whole and emphasising that it is the same God who both dispenses and then ameliorates these conditions. Movement 2 is a secco recitative for tenor, concluding in an arioso section with a \\"deeply moving\\" melisma on the word \\"\\" (sorrows). Movement 3, \\"\\" (Besides You is no doctor to be found) is an aria for alto with the obbligato flauto piccolo, which according to Mincham, employs a \\"figuration ever striving upwards, moderates the underlying sense of potential tragedy\\". The alto recitative \\"marks a change of scene\\", it begins in B minor, like the opening chorus, but modulates to D-major and ends with a wide-ranging coloratura marking the word \\"\\" (joy). Movement 5, \\"\\" (Recover now, O troubled feelings), picks up the joyful coloraturas, supported by the trumpet and fanfares in triads in the orchestra, Mincham notes that the trumpet \\"bursts upon us with an energy, acclamation and jubilation unheard, so far, in this work\\". The cantata is closed with a four-part setting of the chorale, sung to the melody of \\"\\" which Bach used frequently, including in his St Matthew Passion.

Early life Peter Silvester was born in 1734 at Shelter Island in the Province of New York (just off the eastern coast of Long Island). Silvester was probably descended from Nathaniel Sylvester (1610-1680),Jennifer Schuessler, Confronting Slavery at Long Island‚Äôs Oldest Estates, The New York Times, August 12, 2015 an Anglo- Dutch sugar merchant and the first European settler of Shelter Island. Silvester completed preparatory studies, studied law, was admitted to the bar in 1763, and practiced in Albany, New York. Career=Legal practice In 1763, he began employment as the attorney for Sir William Johnson (1715‚Äì1774) in Albany. Johnson had commanded the Iroquois and New York colonial militia forces during the French and Indian War, the North American theatre of the Seven Years' War (1754‚Äì1763) in Europe. His role in the British victory at the Battle of Lake George in 1755 earned him a baronetcy and his capture of Fort Niagara from the French in 1759 brought him additional renown. Johnson served as the British Superintendent of Indian Affairs for the northern district from 1756 until his death in 1774, working to keep American Indians allied with the British.Hamilton, 120‚Äì21; O'Toole, 129. In letters to Johnson, Silvester wrote that he met with Witham Marsh concerning wrongs committed by Indians. Silvester was subsequently appointed \\"clerk of the peace.\\" In 1767, he moved to the Van Schaack estate in Kinderhook, and began his practice of law as the first attorney in Kinderhook. Among the students who began the study of law in his office were: Peter van Schaack (1747-1832); Francis Silvester (1767-1845), his son; and Martin Van Buren (1782‚Äì1862), who later became the 8th President of the United States.John L. Brooke, Columbia Rising: Civil Life on the Upper Hudson from the Revolution to the Age of Jackson, 2010, page 288 Van Buren began his legal training with Silvester and his son Francis in 1796, before Van Buren had reached the age of 14. When Van Buren first began his legal studies, he often presented an unkempt appearance in rough, homespun clothing. It was the Silvesters who suggested that Van Buren could improve his professional prospects by dressing fashionably and taking care in how he appeared in public; he heeded the advice and patterned his clothing, appearance, bearing and conduct after theirs. After six years under the Silvesters, the elder Silvester and Democratic-Republican political figure John Peter Van Ness suggested that Van Buren's political leanings made it a good idea for him to complete his education with a Democratic-Republican attorney. Van Buren accepted their advice and spent a final year of apprenticeship in the New York City office of John Van Ness's brother William P. Van Ness, a political lieutenant of Aaron Burr. Revolutionary War During the American Revolutionary War (1775‚Äì1783), Silvester backed the patriot cause and held a variety of positions in New York including: member of the Albany Common Council in 1772, member of the Committee of Safety in 1774, and a member of the First and Second Provincial Congresses in 1775 and 1776. His wife's family, the Van Schaacks, were Loyalists, and some historians have suggested that Silvester's in-laws may have influenced him to take a reduced role as the Revolution progressed. Government service Silvester as a New York State Senator in 1798.He was appointed judge of the court of common pleas of Columbia County, New York in 1786, and served until 1789. He was a regent of the University of the State of New York from 1787 to 1808. From July 1, 1787 to June 30, 1788, Silvester served in the 11th New York State Legislature as a member of the New York State Assembly from Columbia County, the first year that Columbia County was represented. After serving in the New York State Assembly, Silvester was elected to the First and Second United States Congresses as a Pro-Administration (Federalist) candidate. He served in the United States Congress from March 4, 1789 to March 3, 1793. After his time in Congress, Silvester was elected to a four-year term as a member of the New York State Senate, serving from 1796 to 1800 in the 20th, 21st, 22nd, and 23rd New York State Legislature. After his service in the Senate, he returned to serve again in the Assembly from 1803 (26th Legislature), and again in 1804 (28th Legislature), 1805 (29th Legislature) until June 30, 1806. He retired from public life after his last term in the Legislature. Personal life On August 16, 1764, he married Jannetje \\"Jane\\" Van Schaack, daughter of Cornelius Van Schaack (1705-1776) and Lydia Van Dyck. Cornelius Van Schaack owned a large estate in Kinderhook, New York. Jane was the elder sister of Peter van Schaack, who married the daughter of Henry Cruger, a wealthy New York merchant. Together they had: *Francis Silvester (July 22, 1767 - January 31, 1845), who married Lydia Van Vleck Van Schaack, a niece of Peter van Schaack and foster daughter of David Van Schaack **Peter Henry Silvester (1807‚Äì1882), who married Catherine Susan Bronk (?-1858) ***Francis Silvester II (November 15, 1833 - December 6, 1903 in New York City), district attorney and member of the State Constitutional Convention of 1867 ***John L.

Silvester resided in Kinderhook, where he died on October 15, 1808, aged about 74 years.

In the show, Azula is the princess of the Fire Nation and an extremely powerful firebending prodigy. Upon Fire Lord Ozai's orders, she begins a quest with her childhood friends Mai and Ty Lee to retrieve her exiled brother Prince Zuko and his mentor, their uncle Iroh, while also attempting to capture Avatar Aang, considered the Fire Nation's greatest threat to victory in the war. Azula is known for being a skilled strategist and manipulator. As her brother Zuko states, she \\"always lies.\\" Throughout the original series and the sequel comics, she is shown to be capable of highly advanced firebending, producing hotter blue flames as well as lightning. Appearances=Avatar: The Last Airbender Azula's unique blue flames =Book One: Water= Since she is the shadowed firebender in the series' opening sequence, Azula appears at the beginning of every episode of Avatar: The Last Airbender. In the show itself, she makes her first appearance in a flashback during 13-year-old Zuko's Agni Kai (firebending duel) against their father, Fire Lord Ozai. Azula smirks as Zuko's face is burned after he refuses to fight Ozai, who takes this as a sign of weakness and disrespect. The Fire Lord then banishes the permanently scarred Zuko and tasks him with finding the long-lost avatar. Azula makes a second brief appearance at the end of the first season, when Ozai tasks her with repatriating Zuko and Iroh, who accompanied his nephew into exile and briefly cooperated with the series' protagonists. =Book Two: Earth= Azula eventually encounters the Avatar in Omashu, and later attempts to capture him by enlisting her childhood friends Mai and Ty Lee. Azula continues to pursue Aang, Zuko and Iroh for the rest of the season. After her initial failure to enter the Earth Kingdom capital Ba Sing Se using a giant drill to breach the city's strong outer wall, Azula comes in contact with the Kyoshi Warriors, fighters who, despite their lack of ability to bend any element, dress as and utilize the fighting style of Kyoshi, a past Avatar.Ehasz, Elizabeth Welch (writer) & Volpe, Giancarlo (director).

Posing as Kyoshi Warriors, Azula and her friends infiltrate Ba Sing Se and befriend Earth King Kuei, who tells them about the planned invasion of the Fire Nation during an upcoming solar eclipse. Azula also comes to understand that the secret police and intelligence agency known as the Dai Li is the key to power in the capital. She is discovered as an infiltrator by Dai Li agents and brought before their imprisoned leader Long Feng. Having in fact intentionally exposed herself, Azula lulls him into a false sense of control, and accepts his offer to help stage a coup d'√©tat against the Earth King and the loyalist Council of Five.DiMartino, Michael Dante, Konietzko, Bryan (writers) & Volpe, Giancarlo (director).

However, Azula lies to Ozai by claiming that Zuko killed Aang, as she has a hunch that Aang survived and knows that all the blame would now fall on Zuko if this were true. During the two-part episode \\"The Day of Black Sun,\\" Aang assembles an elite invasion force and attacks the capital, taking advantage of a solar eclipse that renders the firebenders powerless. Having been warned by Azula, Ozai is evacuated to an underground bunker prior to the invasion. Azula and her Dai Li agents stall Aang and his friends Sokka and Toph from finding Ozai before the eclipse, which lasts only eight minutes, allowing the firebenders to retaliate with full force once they regain their bending, causing the invasion to fail. However, Zuko defects to Team Avatar after confronting Ozai during the eclipse. Later, Azula, accompanied by Mai and Ty Lee, head to The Boiling Rock, the top security Fire Nation prison where Zuko has been captured in an attempt to infiltrate the prison and rescue the captured forces of the failed invasion. However, Zuko, Sokka, Suki (leader of the Kyoshi Warriors, who had been captured in the aftermath of their battle with Azula) and Sokka's father Hakoda manage to escape. Mai betrays Azula by aiding the group's escape, proclaiming that she did so out of her love for Zuko. Enraged, Azula attempts to attack Mai but is stopped by Ty Lee, who renders her incapable of bending by blocking her chi (the energy within one which one would use for bending).

Azula then escapes and is last seen observing Zuko apologizing to his people for his recent actions. As Azula directly tells Zuko about her supposed intentions and seems to take his speech seriously, she is possibly acting as a stealth mentor by using reverse psychology on Zuko. Azula's ultimate fate is unknown, as she does not appear in any later storylines. Video games Azula appears as an antagonist in the video games Avatar: The Last Airbender ‚Äì The Burning EarthAvatar: The Last Airbender - The Burning Earth and Avatar: The Last Airbender ‚Äì Into the InfernoAvatar: The Last Airbender - Into the Inferno again voiced by Grey DeLisle. Film Azula appears in the critically panned live action feature film The Last Airbender in a flashback where Zuko gets his scar and before the end credits roll. In the film, she is played by Summer Bishil. Conception and creation Konietzko notes that Azula's design when compared to other main characters \\"came together relatively quickly.\\" Azula was originally going to wear a heavily phoenix-themed armor, though the idea was eventually abandoned. Azula's blue firebending was meant to symbolize that she was more powerful than Zuko as well as a firebending prodigy, and also to easily distinguish her attacks from his in their fights. She was initially intended to have an arranged marriage during the third season. Both creators hold the character in high regard; Konietzko believes she is \\"by far the most complex, interesting, and dangerous villain in the series\\" while DiMartino wrote that she was his favorite villain in the series.Avatar: The Last Airbender: The Art of the Animated Series, pg. 87. Voice Azula is voiced by Grey DeLisle. DeLisle recounts that she had studied her \\"whole life\\" for well-written characters like Azula who were hard to come by. Overall, DeLisle felt her life had changed positively from the role, and association with the series, relaying this to Janet Varney who would voice Korra in the sequel series. Characterization Although Azula's age is never stated in the series itself, the Avatar website gives her age as fourteen. However, the graphic novels state that she is in fact a year younger than Zuko, making her around fifteen during the events of the show. She is Fire Lord Sozin's great- granddaughter through Ozai, and Avatar Roku's through her mother, Ursa. In another flashback, it is revealed that she is named after her paternal grandfather Azulon, Ozai's father. Even as a child, Azula demonstrated her natural talents early in life, along with her tendency for malice and perfectionism. Her sharp wit and the skill she displayed towards Firebending gained her much attention and acclaim, often at Zuko's expense. Even when young, Azula suggests that her father would make a better Fire Lord than the heir apparent, her uncle Iroh, whom she dubbed \\"a quitter and a loser\\" for abandoning his siege of the Earth Kingdom's capital Ba Sing Se, which would have secured the Fire Nation's victory in the war, after the death of his son Lu Ten. Personality Azula is a firebending prodigy and a dedicated perfectionist. As one who wants nothing less than absolute control, she likewise has remarkable control of herself, seemingly able to react to any situation at a moment's notice without losing her composure. This is shown when she learns of a secret plot to invade the Fire Nation while in disguise, but does not react to not blow her cover. Psychological analyses estimate Azula as being highly intelligent, and as suffering from narcissistic and antisocial personality disorders with notable Machiavellian and, at times, sadistic traits. Following the betrayal by her closest friends Mai and Ty Lee, she possibly develops schizoaffective disorder, as indicated by her delusions of persecution, hallucinations of her mother speaking to her, as well as her frequent and radical intermittent mood fluctuations. The drastic combination of antisocial, narcissistic and Machiavellian traits suggest that Azula appears to suffer from a dark triad personality. From a young age, Azula had a cruel, sociopathic personality, showing almost no empathy or remorse for actions that harmed others both physically and emotionally. Azula was heavily influenced by her father, who favored her over Zuko due to her superior firebending abilities. However, Azula's father was a ruthless man incapable of true love. Azula was also constantly scolded by her mother due to her cruel nature. This shaped Azula's fears that she could not count on love from anyone, no matter how close they seemed. Unable to trust others, she instead began to control them using fear. Although a skilled strategist and capable of predicting her enemies' moves, she is awkward in social situations, and later admits to jealousy of Ty Lee's ability to attract potential sweethearts during \\"The Beach\\" episode. She ends up seducing Chan with Ty Lee's advice to act dumb; however, she scares him away when she shows her true personality. From childhood, Azula believed her mother favored Zuko and thought her monstrous, which she admitted to be true but hurt her deeply. After she was betrayed by Mai and Ty Lee, her mental state gradually collapsed, as her attacks became far more vicious and she was seemingly obsessed with killing Zuko. After her defeat, it is revealed in the graphic novel The Promise that she was admitted into a mental institution in the Fire Nation due to her deranged mental state, possibly suffering from schizophrenia. Both in the series and the comics, she is shown to be disturbed by frequent hallucinations of her mother. Azula often acts cold-hearted towards her uncle and her brother, but she appears to show some genuine care and love for Zuko in the season 2 finale and early episodes of season 3. Although she seems to care about her friends, she frequently manipulates them, as seen when she threatens Ty Lee into leaving the circus in Book 2. There has been only one known occurrence of Azula showing remorse by apologizing after unintentionally insulting Ty Lee. Firebending Azula is highly skilled in firebending, which utilizes Chinese martial arts techniques of Changquan, Shaolinquan, L√≥ng X√≠ng M√≥ Qi√°o and Xing Yi Quan.The Lost Scrolls: Fire, page 159 of The Lost Scrolls Collection.http://www.kungfumagazine.com/ezine/article.php?article=1038 The series' creators consulted a professional martial artist in the design of the show's fighting style. Azula is one of the most skilled firebenders in the show and is a very difficult person to defeat in single combat. Her excellent firebending abilities, hand-to-hand combat skills, intelligence, agility and charisma make her a formidable opponent. Blue flames Azula is the only firebender who can produce blue flames, which are hotter and contain more energy (according to Planck's law) than those of other firebenders who bend normal orange flames. Her flames are blue due to her fire being fueled by pure hatred. In fact, her name is derived from azul, the Spanish, Galician and Portuguese word for blue. However, Azula could not produce blue fire as a young child, as shown in flashbacks. Similarly, her grandfather Azulon was never shown to wield blue flames despite his namesake implying otherwise. Azula can also use her firebending in previously unseen ways, such as jets of flames and whirling disks. She often firebends using only two fingers, rather than a closed fist or open hand common to other firebenders. Azula can fight for long periods of time without tiring. She is also able to generate powerful shields of swirling flames, which she once used to withstand the simultaneous combined attacks of Aang, Katara, Zuko and Toph. She is even able to charge up her fire before releasing it, as was seen during one fight with Aang. Azula is able to propel herself, using her flames, in a manner similar to a rocket. This ability has also been extended as a means to fly for short periods of time as seen in the Boiling Rock. She can also breathe fire, as shown when she was defeated by Katara and Zuko. =Lightning generation= Azula is capable of lightning generation, one of the rarest types of firebending; Iroh notes that it isn't really possible to teach lightning generation, it's just something particularly powerful firebenders are capable of. Other skills Azula is a skilled unarmed fighter. In \\"The Avatar State,\\" she bested Zuko in combat without resorting to firebending, and in \\"The Day of Black Sun,\\" she avoided the combined forces of Aang, Toph, and Sokka for several minutes without her bending to aid her. In \\"Appa's Lost Days,\\" when Suki made a stab attack at Azula with her fan, Azula jumped horizontally and knocked Suki's sword out of her hand and onto a tree. Azula is an expert in persuasion. She is capable of using psychological warfare, intimidation, and mistruths to con other people into obeying her. She also has the ability to lie easily without causing any change in her breathing and heartrate (an indication of her psychopathy), making it nearly impossible to detect if she's lying, which she demonstrated in \\"The Day of Black Sun.\\" She is also an accomplished strategist, as she was able to conquer Ba Sing Se, a city thought to be impenetrable, while usurping the Earth King and hierarchy of the Earth Kingdom capital all in one swift move.

The brawl, which has been nicknamed Bloody Wednesday, Fight Night at the Joe and Brawl in Hockeytown, stemmed from a previous on-ice incident between the two teams during the 1996 Western Conference Finals. Previous incident In Game 6 of the 1996 Western Conference Finals, Avalanche right winger Claude Lemieux checked Red Wings center Kris Draper from behind, driving Draper's face into the boards. The hit sent Draper out of the game and into the hospital with a broken jaw, shattered cheek and orbital bone which required reconstructive surgery involving his jaw being wired shut and numerous stitches. The Avalanche would upset the Red Wings in six games, eventually winning the Stanley Cup. After the traditional handshakes that take place after a playoff series, former Red Wings winger Dino Ciccarelli said of Lemieux, \\"I can't believe I shook this guy's friggin' hand after the game; that pisses me right off.\\" Brawls In the next regular season, although the two teams had played each other three times without serious incident, this fourth meeting on the night of March 26 was different, with nine fights in the game. As tensions mounted early in the first period, defencemen Brent Severyn (Avalanche) and Jamie Pushor (Red Wings) fought at 4:45 of the first period, followed by a fight between forwards Kirk Maltby (Red Wings) and Rene Corbet (Avalanche) at 10:14. The major melee ensued at the 18:22 mark, leading to the third fight. Shortly after a collision between Red Wing center Igor Larionov and Avalanche forward Peter Forsberg, Wings enforcer Darren McCarty seized the chance to avenge his Grind Line teammate by escaping from the grasps of Adam Foote and a linesman and turning to cold-cock Lemieux.Darren McCarty with Kevin Allen, \\"Darren McCarty Recalls Taking On Claude Lemieux And Wings-Avalanche Rivalry\\", The PostGame, December 24, 2013 McCarty laid many blows on Lemieux, who fell to the ice and covered his head; McCarty managed to land a few more punches, drag Lemieux to the boards and knee him in the head before the two were separated by officials. Patrick Roy was well known for his fight with Mike Vernon, which has been called one of the best \\"goalie fights\\" ever seen. Seeing what McCarty was doing to Lemieux, Avalanche goaltender Patrick Roy skated out of his net to defend his teammate, but was intercepted by Red Wing forward Brendan Shanahan, who hit Roy with a vicious clothesline that sent him sprawling to the ice. While Shanahan and defenceman Adam Foote tangled, Wings goaltender Mike Vernon went out to center ice to try and grab Foote off of Shanahan. Roy saw this going on and got Vernon's attention by pulling him off his teammate, which ended up escalating to a fight when Vernon and Roy dropped their masks, gloves, and blockers. As a result of the third brawl of the first period, Forsberg and Larionov each received matching minor penalties for roughing; Roy and Vernon were each assessed minor penalties for roughing Shanahan and Foote, respectively, and major penalties for fighting each other, and McCarty received a double-minor for roughing Lemieux, giving Colorado a power play. Forsberg aggravated an injury in the scrum with Larionov and would not return, and the McCarty/Lemieux incident left patches of blood on the ice that were visible before the ice was resurfaced by the Zamboni; blood also ended up on the boards near the Red Wings bench. There was even more blood during this brawl, when blood started to gush out from a cut on Roy's forehead. Fifteen seconds after the Roy/Vernon fight, Avalanche winger Adam Deadmarsh and Red Wing defenceman Vladimir Konstantinov would drop the gloves in another fight for the final fight in the first period. There would be five more fights (and four stoppages) in the second period: a fight between Shanahan and Foote four seconds into the second period, simultaneous fights between Avalanche winger Mike Keane and Red Wing winger Tomas Holmstrom, which occurred for the most part on the ice, and between Severyn and Red Wing defenceman Aaron Ward at 3:34 in (Severyn and Ward were ejected for a secondary fight), McCarty and Deadmarsh at 7:24 (McCarty also received a roughing), and between Pushor and Avalanche defenceman Uwe Krupp at 11:26. When the third period ended, the score was tied 5‚Äì5. Incidentally, it was McCarty who scored the winner against Roy in overtime, assisted by Shanahan and Larionov. Aftermath Mike Vernon, who won his 300th career game, believed the brawl-filled game \\"brought the Red Wings together\\" in time for the playoffs. Red Wings broadcaster Ken Kal surmised that the game was a turning point as far as the team's success went. Colorado head coach Marc Crawford, meanwhile, wondered why McCarty did not receive a game misconduct for his largely one-sided instigation and subsequent fight with Lemieux (McCarty received a double-minor for roughing for that incident, and also received a fighting major later in the game). Subsequently, Avalanche right winger Mike Keane criticized Draper for having McCarty fight on his behalf. A similar free-for-all between the teams took place on May 22, during Game 4 of the Western Conference Finals at Joe Louis Arena, when during a penalty-filled game, Crawford was seen screaming obscenities at Red Wings head coach Scotty Bowman across the glass separating the two benches. Bowman then told Crawford, \\"I knew your father before you did, and I don't think he'd be very proud of how you're acting.\\" The Wings won that game 6‚Äì0. Crawford was fined $10,000 for the tirade. The next season during a game on November 11, 1997 between the two teams, McCarty and Lemieux began to throw punches seconds after the opening faceoff, much to the delight of the Joe Louis Arena crowd. On April 1, 1998, Joe Louis Arena was the site of another Avs-Wings brawl. This time Patrick Roy challenged and then squared off with Chris Osgood at center ice. The referees called more severe penalties this time, as Roy and Osgood both received minor, major, misconduct, and game misconduct penalties. The two teams combined for 46 penalties totaling 228 minutes. The Wings won the game 2‚Äì0, and would go on to win the second of their consecutive Stanley Cups. The game and brawl is considered a defining moment in modern hockey history. However, as players began to leave each team through free agency, trades or retirements, the rivalry began to die down. A game between the Red Wings and Avalanche at the Pepsi Center on March 23, 2002, broke into a brawl (much smaller than the previous two) when Kirk Maltby came into Patrick Roy's net and Roy took exception. The brawl continued when Red Wings goaltender Dominik Hasek skated down the length of the ice to confront Roy but tripped on a discarded stick, causing him to crash into and knock over Roy. Infuriated, Roy threw off his gloves and mask to fight as Hasek did the same, but the two were restrained by the officials, thus preventing Roy from fighting a third Red Wing goaltender since 1997. The Red Wings would also go on to win this game 2-0, and win the 2002 Stanley Cup a couple of months later.

Theories Vennemann's book Europa Vasconica ‚Äì Europa Semitica (2003) was reviewed in Lingua by linguists Philip Baldi and B. Richard Page, who made reasoned dismissals of a number of his proposals. The reviewers still applauded Vennemann's \\"efforts to reassess the role and extent of language contact in the development of Indo-European languages in Europe\\".Baldi and Page, Lingua 116 (2006) 2183‚Äì2220. archive.org: https://web.archive.org/web/20131027232420/http://www.cls.psu.edu/pubs/pubs/LINGUA1158.pdf Vennemann's controversial claims about the prehistory of European languages include the following: * Vasconic substratum theory: A \\"Vasconic\\" language family ancestral to Basque is a substratum of European languages, especially Germanic, Celtic, and Italic. Vennemann claims this could be evidenced by various loan words, toponyms, and structural features such as word-initial accent. The linguistic origin of Old European hydronymy, traditionally considered as Indo-European, is classified as Vasconic by Vennemann. Numerous toponyms that are traditionally considered as Indo-European by virtue of their Indo-European head words are instead names that have been adapted to Indo- European languages through the addition of a suffix. * Semitic is a substratum of the Celtic languages, as shown by certain structural features of Celtic, especially their lack of external possessors.English ‚Äì a German dialect? Prof. em. Theo Vennemann, Ph.D. Rotary Club Munich International. 7 November 2005. * Punic, the Semitic language spoken in classical Carthage, is a superstratum of the Germanic languages. According to Vennemann, Carthaginians colonized the North Sea region between the 6th and 3rd centuries BC; this is evidenced by numerous Semitic loanwords in the Germanic languages as well as structural features such as strong verbs and similarities between Norse religion and Semitic religion. The theory replaces his older theory of an unknown Semitic substrate language that he called \\"Atlantidic\\" or \\"Semitidic\\". The Runic alphabet is derived directly from the Phoenician alphabet used by the Carthaginians but without intervention by the Greek alphabet. The Germanic sound shift is dated to the 6th to 3rd centuries BC, as evidenced by the fact that only some presumed Punic loanwords participated in it.

Biography Olga Desmond on a contemporary Russian postcard Olga Antonie Sellin, born November 2, 1890, lived a full and exciting life. She shared a home with thirteen brothers and sisters. She was drawn to the stage at an early age. Her mother was extremely strict and often called the sergeant. At the age of fifteen, she escaped from her family and joined a theatre act in London. In 1907 she joined a group of artists and appeared as Venus during the group's nine-month tour at the London Pavilion where they put on \\"plastic representations.\\" In Berlin she co-founded the Association for Ideal Culture and gave shows called \\"living pictures\\" in which she posed after the manner of ancient classical works of art. Upon returning to Berlin, she changed her name to Olga Desmond. She began to create her own show, and would she dance with a veil. Eventually she switched to a metal belt. The more she posed the more she realized that she wanted to move on stage. She wanted to bring nudity to life. These so-called \\"Evenings of Beauty\\" (Sch√∂nheitsabende) were prohibited on more than one occasion starting from 1908, because the actors usually posed nude or wearing only bodypaint. The \\"heroine of living pictures,\\" Olga Desmond became one of the first to promote nudity on the stage in St. Petersburg, Russia, when in the summer of 1908 the German dancer arrived there with her repertoire of performance. Olga Desmond's Evenings of Beauty quickly became the subject of a great debate in the Russian media. At least one of the representatives of official \\"justice\\" wanted to haul Desmond into court for \\"seduction.\\" Olga Desmond herself persistently defended her right to appear naked. \\"Call it daring or bold, or however you want to describe my appearance on the stage, but this requires art, and it (art) is my only deity, before whom I bow and for which I am prepared to make all possible sacrifices,\\" she told the Russian press. \\"I decided to break the centuries-old heavy chains, created by people themselves. When I go out on stage completely naked, I am not ashamed, I am not embarrassed, because I come out before the public just as I am, loving all that is beautiful and graceful. There was never a case when my appearance before the public evoked any cynical observations or dirty ideas.\\" Olga Desmond raised the prices of some of her shows so that only people who respected her kind of art would be seeing her shows. In addition to raising prices, many of her performances were only open to members of other dance societies so that people on the street could not see her performances. Asked whether a stage costume would interfere with her, Olga Desmond answered: \\"To be completely graceful in a costume or even in a tricot is unthinkable. And I decided to throw off this needless yoke.\\" Objecting to the claims that she excites \\"base instincts\\" of the public, the dancer said: \\"I purposely set a high admission charge for my shows so that the street would not get in, for it has little understanding of pure art, but so that people with broader demands for it would come, people who will look on me as a servitor of art.\\" The authorities in St. Petersburg paid little attention to the explanations offered by the dancer from Berlin, and her first appearance in the imperial Russian capital was also her last: further shows were forbidden by the mayor. Many artists in the capital took the side of the authorities. For example, Konstantin Makovsky sharply denounced what he called the \\"cult of the naked body,\\" saying that \\"beauty, like much else in life, must have its hidden secrets, that we don't even have the right to expose.\\" Olga Desmond was no less the subject of controversy in her own country. In 1909 her appearance in the Berlin Wintergarten was the cause of such a scandal that it became a subject of discussion even in the Prussian State Assembly. But \\"scandalous\\" also meant well-known, and as a result of her renown, there were cosmetic products that carried her name. She traveled through Germany on numerous tours until 1914, when she married a Hungarian large landowner, and went off with him to his estate. From 1916 through 1919 she appeared in various films including Seifenblasen (Soap Bubbles), Marias Sonntagsgewand (Maria's Sunday clothes) and Mut zur S√ºnde (Courage for sin). In the latter film she played opposite the later well-known German actor Hans Albers. In 1917 she separated from her husband and returned to the stage. Her first appearance took place on 15 April 1917 at the Theatre of the Royal University (Theater der K√∂niglichen Hochschule) in Berlin. In the same year she appeared in a performance of Carmen in Cologne. She presented dance evenings and other things in Warsaw, Breslau (now Wroc≈Çaw), and Kattowitz (now Katowice). Thereafter, she made fewer public appearances and from 1922 devoted herself entirely to teaching. Among her best-known students was Hertha Feist, who later became a member of the dance group of Rudolf von LabanD√∂rr, Evelyn, (2008). \\"Rudolf Laban: The Dancer of the Crystal\\", Lanham, Maryland: Scarecrow Press, page 99-101.. After the First World War she married her second husband, Georg Piek, a Jewish businessman with a studio for stage equipment, decorations, and special fabrics. After 1933 Piek left Germany. After World War II, Desmond lived in the eastern part of Berlin. In her late years, forgotten by the public, she worked as a cleaning woman. To make a living, she also sold vintage postcards and other memorabilia from her time as a renowned dancer.Tagesspiegel.de Olga was an advocate for teaching as well. In 1919, Desmond published a pamphlet, Rhythmograpik, which included a new method of writing down dances and transcribing the movements into special symbols. The pamphlet included images of her in see through gowns and nude women dancing within floral patterning Olga understood the precision that went into dancing. Her pamphlet helped other female dancers in a new and interesting way. Olga Desmond died on 2 August 1964 in East Berlin.

The function of this premolar is similar to that of canines in regard to tearing being the principal action during mastication, commonly known as chewing. Mandibular first premolars have two cusps. The one large and sharp is located on the buccal side (closest to the cheek) of the tooth. Since the lingual cusp (located nearer the tongue) is small and nonfunctional (which refers to a cusp not active in chewing), the mandibular first premolar resembles a small canine. There are no deciduous (baby) mandibular premolars. Instead, the teeth that precede the permanent mandibular premolars are the deciduous mandibular molars. Sometimes, premolars are referred to as bicuspids. Even though the terms are synonymous, \\"bicuspid\\" refers to having two functional cusps, and the mandibular first premolar is an example of a premolar with only one functional cusp. Thus, \\"bicuspid\\" is technically not as accurate as \\"premolar\\". In the universal system of notation, the permanent mandibular premolars are designated by a number. The right permanent mandibular first premolar is known as \\"28\\", and the left one is known as \\"21\\".

For over 15 months, the working group travelled the country, holding public meetings, and then devised a roadmap for change based on this commentary. Their recommendations were submit to Congress and the President in Fall 2006. By creating the working group through Section 1014 of the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003, Congress bound itself to take action on the final results, meaning the President must comment and Congress must hold hearings on these recommendations. The Working Group invited individuals across the country to provide feedback on the following four questions: # What health care services do you want? # How do you want those services provided? # How do you want those services financed? # What trade-offs are you willing to make? People participated by attending community meeting, answering an online Health Care Poll, holding their own community meetings and sending in the results and participating in online blogs and discussion boards.  Community Meetings  The Citizens Health Care Working Group had over 35 Community Meetings from January‚ÄìJune 2006. These highly interactive meetings typically ran 4 hours, and were hosted by either the Public Forum Institute or AmericaSpeaks. Seated around tables of ten, individuals participated in small table discussions and voted on electronic keypads. They also participated in discussions involving the entire group, ranging in size from 100-300 people. The Working Group also encouraged groups to hold their own Community Meeting by downloading the Community Meeting kit located on their website.  The Health Care Poll  The Citizens' Health Care Working Group also invites people to participate in this process by answering a short health care poll. This allows individuals to share their input with the Working Group for consideration for the final recommendations. The Health Care Poll results can be found on the web at www.citizenshealthcare.gov.  Required governmental action  A report from this group is due to both the Congress and the President by September, 2006. This group is distinguished from other health care efforts because the law that created it requires the President to respond to the recommendations, and requires the following five Congressional committees to hold hearings on them: * Finance * Energy and Commerce * HELP * Ways and Means * Education and the Workforce  Selection of the Working Members  As set forth in Public Law 108-173, Sec. 1014, the Working Group is made up of 14 members selected by Comptroller General of the United States, David Walker. By law, the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) serves as the 15th member. Comptroller General Walker chose the 14 members of the Working Group from among more than 530 applicants; the selections were announced Feb. 28, 2005. None of the appointees are current elected officials or registered lobbyists. In addition, only one of the 14 appointees, former Governor of Utah and now HHS Secretary Mike Leavitt, is from the Washington, D.C. area. The members represent many regions of the country and a broad range of health care perspectives, including consumers, providers, employers and workers.

While in crystalline solids such atomic layers can extend periodically throughout the entire dimension of a crystal, surface layering decays rapidly away from the surface and is limited to just a few near-surface region layers. Another difference between surface layering and crystalline structure is that atoms or molecules of surface-layered liquids are not ordered in-plane, while in crystalline solids they are. Surface layering was predicted theoretically by Stuart Rice at the University of Chicago in 1983 and has been experimentally discovered by Peter Pershan (Harvard) and his group, working in collaboration with Ben Ocko (Brookhaven) and Moshe Deutsch (Bar-Ilan) in 1995 in elemental liquid mercury and liquid gallium using x-ray reflectivity techniques. More recently layering has been shown to arise from electronic properties of metallic liquids, rather than thermodynamic variables such as surface tension, since surfaces of low-surface tension metallic liquids such as liquid potassium are layered, while those of dielectric liquids such as water, are not.

Founded in 1886 as the Grand Rapids School Furniture Company, the company is headquartered in Grand Rapids, Michigan, USA. The company gives its name to the American Seating rule, based on a lawsuit it participated in. Various notable venues in the United States have featured seats produced by American Seating, including Radio City Music Hall and the Metropolitan Opera in New York City, Fenway Park in Boston, the now-demolished Candlestick Park in San Francisco, and the United States Senate chamber. The company discontinued manufacturing seats for stadiums, arenas and theatres in 2017. History The bottom of an American Seating-built bus seat, flipped up to accommodate a handicapped passenger. The company was founded in 1886 by three businessmen and members of the Grand Rapids school board. They opened a factory in Grand Rapids on January 5 of that year, manufacturing school and office furniture, particularly wooden school desks. The Grand Rapids School Furniture Company was officially incorporated on May 8, 1887. The company was able to utilize the favorable conditions that led Grand Rapid's furniture industry to blossom at this time. This included an abundance of forests for lumber, the presence of the Grand River, and an increasing immigrant population in the area providing labor. The company inaugurated its now-historic factory on August 1, 1888. In 1899, the company acquired and merged with 18 other furniture manufacturers, and was renamed American School Furniture Company. Following the mergers, the company was accused on several occasions of operating as a trust within the furniture industry. In March 1900, the company was sued in New York for violating the Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890. In 1901, American School Furniture was sued by the stockholders of a Chicago company they recently acquired, also accusing the company of operating as a monopoly. In 1906, the company reorganized as the American Seating Company, incorporating in New Jersey. Shortly afterward in 1907, the company and 13 other associated furniture and appliance producers were fined for operating as a trust by Judge Kenesaw Mountain Landis in the anti-trust case, United States v. American Seating Co. The companies were referred to as the \\"Prudential Club\\". The proceedings also alleged that the purpose of the company's 1906 reorganization was to push out smaller stockholders. The company would be involved in other anti-trust suits, in 1940, and 1971. Beginning in 1909 and continuing through the 1930s, American Seating installed the original seats in several iconic sporting venues in the United States. This included the first seats in Forbes Field, Comiskey Park, Fenway Park, Wrigley Field, and the original Yankee Stadium. By 1926, American Seating produced over half of the theatre, school, church, and lodge furniture in the United States. After having offices in New York and Chicago, the company consolidated its offices in Grand Rapids in 1931. During World War II, the company's production focused on the war effort. This included the production of seats for airplanes and tanks, as well as non-furniture military supplies. In 1947, the company began producing seats for city buses. In 1958, the company introduced the first molded plastic seats for stadiums, first installed in the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum. Starting in 1960, the company expanded to the health care industry, including hospital beds. In 1970, the company began producing seats for railroad rolling stock. In 1982, American Seating sold off its classroom furniture business due to lower demand. American Seating also operates its Canadian subsidiary, Otaco Seating in Newmarket, Ontario. The former Otaco plant in Orillia was closed in 2007. American Seating announced on January 3, 2017 that it was selling its division that manufactured chairs for stadiums, arenas and theatres to the Irwin Seating Company. The transaction, which was finalized two months later in March, resulted in the layoff of 80 workers and an increased focus on transportation seating.Martinez, Shandra. \\"American Seating sells off iconic baseball seating business, lays off 80 workers,\\" MLive (Grand Rapids, MI), Wednesday, January 4, 2017.

Sometime prior to 1800, an early white settler named George Gregg had a raceway (mill race) carved across the narrow point of the peninsula and harnessed the resulting hydropower of the stream's 13-foot (4 m) fall for a gristmill and sawmill at the site. These mills were destroyed by a flood in 1852; four more mills were subsequently built and respectively washed away by flooding in the later 19th century. Flooding had the effect of widening the raceway across the peninsula such that it became the main channel of the stream, inhibiting the flow of water through the longer loop and transforming the peninsula to an island. In 1947 the West Virginia Conservation Commission constructed a low water bridge which substantially dammed the cut-through and restored a steady flow to the bend of the creek.Ratliff, Gerald S., \\"Jug of Middle Island Creek\\" (2006); In: The West Virginia Encyclopedia; Ken Sullivan, editor, Charleston, WV: West Virginia Humanities Council; .

The environment of Sri Lanka is unique in being one of the world's bio-diversity hot-spots. Geography Diagrammatic section across Sri Lanka as per D. N. Wadia Sri Lanka was once part of the southern supercontinent Gondwana, which also included South America, Africa, India and Antarctica. Gondwana began to break up 140 million years ago. The tectonic plate on which Sri Lanka was located, the Indian plate, collided with the Eurasian plate creating the Himalayas. Sri Lanka was originally part of the Deccan land mass, contiguous with Madagascar. The island was connected, off and on at least 17 times in the past 700,000 years, to India. Biogeographic zones of Sri Lanka The Loris, found only in Sri Lanka and South India, is related to the Lemurs of Madagascar. The connection to India led to a commonality of species, e.g. freshwater fish, the now extinct Sri Lankan Gaur (Bibos sinhaleyus) and Lion (Panthera leo sinhaleyus).The Hindu - Search for a common past Sri Lanka's forests are amongst the most beautiful rich in Asia and for some faunal groups, it has the highest density of species diversity in the world. The southwest portion of the island, where the influence of the moisture-bearing southwest monsoon is strongest, is home to the Sri Lanka lowland rain forests. At higher elevations they make the transition to the Sri Lanka montane rain forests. Both these tropical moist forest ecoregions bear strong affinities to those of India's Western Ghats. The northern and eastern portions of the island are considerably drier, lying in the rain shadow of the central highlands. The Sri Lanka dry-zone dry evergreen forests are a tropical dry broadleaf forest ecoregion, which, like the neighbouring East Deccan dry evergreen forests of India's Coromandel Coast, is characterised by evergreen trees, rather than the dry-season deciduous trees that predominate in most other tropical dry broadleaf forests. These forests have been largely cleared for agriculture, timber or grazing, and many of the dry evergreen forests have been degraded to thorn scrub, savanna, or thickets. Several preserves have been established to protect some of Sri Lanka's remaining natural areas. The island has three biosphere reserves, Hurulu (established 1977), Sinharaja (established 1978), and Kanneliya-Dediyagala-Nakiyadeniya (KDN) (established 2004). The coastal estuaries are home to mangrove habitats, e.g. the Maduganga river. Offshore are found habitats associated with coral reefs, e.g. the Bar Reef. Also of note are the pearl banks of Mannar, which are also home to Chank, sea cucumbers and sea grasses. Biota Sri Lanka is a centre of bird endemism.

It leads from Paxson on the Richardson Highway to Cantwell on the Parks Highway. Opened in 1957, it was the first road access to Denali National Park. Since 1971, primary park access has been via the Parks Highway, which incorporated a section of the Denali Highway from Cantwell to the present-day park entrance. The Denali Highway is in length. Conditions The highway is now little used and poorly maintained, and closed to all traffic from October to mid-May each year.Whitfield, p. 399 Only the easternmost and westernmost are paved; whether the remainder should be paved as well is a continual source of debate. Washboarding and extreme dust are common, and the recommended speed limit is . Route description The Denali Highway as seen in summer. Traveling west, the Denali Highway leaves the Richardson Highway (Alaska Route 4) at Paxson, and climbs steeply up into the foothills of the central Alaska Range. The first , to Tangle Lakes, are paved. Along its length, the highway passes through three of the principal river drainages in Interior Alaska: the Copper River drainage, the Tanana/Yukon drainage and the Susitna drainage. Along the way, in good weather, there are stunning views of the peaks and glaciers of the central Alaska Range, including Mount Hayes (13,700 ft), Mount Hess (11,940 ft) and Mount Deborah (12,688 ft). At MP 15, from the pullout on the south side of the road, in clear weather you can see the Wrangell Mountains, the Chugach Mountains and the Alaska Range. The first winds through the Amphitheater Mountains, cresting at Maclaren Summit, at the second highest road in Alaska. The road then drops down to the Maclaren River Valley with fine views north to Maclaren Glacier. After crossing the Maclaren River, the road winds through the geologically mysterious Crazy Notch and then along the toe of the Denali Clearwater Mountains to the Susitna River. After crossing the Susitna River the road extends across the glaciers outwash plains to the Nenana River, and then down the Nenana River to Cantwell on the George Parks Highway (Alaska #3). Services There are developed campgrounds at Tangle Lakes (MP 22) and Brushkana Creek (MP 104), but there are dozens of pullouts where one can camp on public lands. Services are scant along this road. Year-round operations include Denali Highway Cabins & Tours (MP 0.2), Maclaren River Lodge (MP 42), Alpine Creek Lodge (MP68), Backwoods Lodge (MP134) and Cantwell Lodge (MP138); summer-only operations include Tangle Lakes Lodge (MP 22), Tangle River Inn (MP 20), Clearwater Mountain Lodge (MP 82). Winter travel on the Denali Highway is exclusively by snowmobile and dogsled. Automobile travelers are severely discouraged from attempting to traverse the road in winter; as recently as 1996 three persons died from exposure when snows blocked their progress. The road is cleared by DOT late in April and generally is passable by non-4WD from then until the first snows close it, usually late September on the eastern, tundra end and late October-early November on the lower, boreal forest western end. Recreation White Spruce taiga along the Denali Highway, with the Alaska Mountain Range in the BackgroundThe Tangle Lakes constitute the headwaters of the Delta River, a popular destination for canoeists as it is the launch point of the Delta River Canoe Trail. The Denali Highway is an important birding destination. It offers road access to alpine terrain ‚Äì not that common in Alaska ‚Äì and, in the brief birding season there, good viewing of a number of alpine breeders, including Arctic Warbler, Smith's Longspur, Long-tailed Jaeger, Whimbrel, Surfbird, Lapland Longspur, Horned Lark, Short-eared Owl, Wandering Tattler, Gyrfalcon and much more. A walk north along The Bureau of Land Management's (BLM) Maclaren Summit Trail (MP 39) can be very productive. There are also trumpeter swans and various other waterfowl in the lakes and ponds along the route. Fishing for grayling and lake trout is decent, if not spectacular, in any of the clear water (i.e., unglaciated) streams. Because the area is hunted heavily, larger mammals are much less common than in Denali National Park, but moose, grizzly bear, and caribou are fairly common. The Nelchina caribou herd, approximately 36,000 animals as of winter 2009‚Äì2010, normally passes through this area after calving season ends, and some autumns and winters as many as 16,000 animals can be seen at once. The herd forms an important foodsource for many residents of southcentral Alaska, and visitors eager to view the animals may be competing with hunters. The many lakes along the road are also a destination for duck hunting in the fall. Most of the land along the highway is publicly owned. There are several BLM-maintained trails, and dozens of informal trails. This is a stretch of wild Alaska that is pretty much unspoiled, relatively accessible and scenic.

He is most famous for his work with William E. Fairbairn in the development of the eponymous Fairbairn-Sykes Fighting Knife and modern British Close Quarters Battle (CQB) martial arts during World War II. Originally working for an import/export company selling weapons in East Asia, he claimed he volunteered for and served in the British Army as a sharpshooter on the Western Front during World War I. Returning to China in 1917, he joined the volunteer branch of the Shanghai Municipal Police (SMP) Specials with the rank of Inspector in 1926. Background Sykes was born Eric Anthony Schwabe in Barton on Irwell,England & Wales, Index of Births, March Quarter 1883, Barton, Lancashire the son of Lawrence Schwabe a Manchester born letter press printer and Octavie his German wife from Cologne, Germany. By 1891 the family had moved south to Bromley in Kent near to Sevenoaks where his father worked as a cotton trader.1891 Census of England & Wales, Bromley, Kent, p.4 He grew up at No. 40 Marlowes, Hemel Hempstead and by 1901 was working as a clerk for the county council.1901 Census of England & Wales, Hemel Hempstead, p.28 The reasons for his name change in 1917 were said to be because he found it \\"too Germanic\\". A shikari hunter, he was an avid rifleman and an expert with the pistol. He first arrived in Shanghai in 1907 while working for Reiss & Co. He met Fairbairn in 1919, then with the Shanghai Municipal Police, beginning their famous professional association. In 1923 Sykes was working for the China & Japan Trading Co, China representative for Remington and Colt. It was not until 1926 that Sykes officially joined the SMP as an unpaid, part-time volunteer officer in the reserve, and in 1929 he joined S.J. David & Co., where he worked until his departure from China in 1940. While working for S.J. David & Co., his experience in sharpshooting and his personal friendship with Fairbairn led him to form and oversee a team of civilian and police snipers for the SMP. He became the head of this unit in 1937, working part-time in this capacity until he resigned this position in 1939. Also in 1939 he joined the British Secret Intelligence Service (SIS - MI6), where he worked with SIS at the Special Training Centre in Lochailort, Scotland. In 1940, Fairbairn resigned from the Shanghai Municipal Police and returned to Britain, with Sykes following. The pair had apparently planned this, since they shipped crates full of illegal weapons from lax Shanghai into Britain on their boat. Wartime service Fairbairn and Sykes were both commissioned as second lieutenants on the British Army, General List on 15 July 1940. After training special forces units throughout 1940, the two were finally commissioned into the British Army on the General List of 1941. Their 1942 book Shooting to Live, published in 1942, is considered by many to be the classic text of pistol combat, and one of the best codifications of the high-stress point shooting method. Nevertheless, this was the last time the pair worked together in any capacity; by mid-1942 the pair's friendship had split, with Sykes claiming that Fairbairn treated him as an inferior. Soon thereafter, Fairbairn travelled to Canada to teach armed and unarmed combat to commandos and covert agents of the Americas at Camp X. Sykes stayed in Great Britain, training Special Operations Executive (SOE) agents at the various Special Training Centres before being assigned to train the joint UK/US Jedburgh teams at Milton Hall. Relinquishing his commission in the rank of Captain due to disability on 6 April 1945 he was allowed to retain the honorary rank of Major. He died at Bexhill-on-Sea, England on 12 May 1945. While teaching at Camp X, Sykes reputedly ended every self-defence lecture with his trademark phrase \\"and then, kick him in the testicles\\" as this method ensures that regardless of the effectiveness of the given tactic used, the assailant would be at least moderately incapacitated.

He was promptly commissioned a major in the 5th Virginia Regiment on February 13, 1776, promoted to lieutenant colonel on July 28, 1777, and became its colonel on April 1, 1778. His regiment served in Virginia under General Charles Lee until the autumn of 1776, when the 5th Virginia Regiment was transferred to George Washington‚Äôs army. The regiment thereafter saw action at the Battle of Trenton, Battle of Princeton, Battle of Brandywine, Battle of Germantown, Battle of Monmouth and the Siege of Charleston. At the Battle of Trenton, Parker had the honor to receive Hessian Colonel Johann Rall's sword of surrender and he alone holds a sword in the painting, The Capture of the Hessians at Trenton, December 26, 1776 by John Trumbull. Parker resigned from the army on July 12, 1778 and became a member of the Virginia House of Delegates for 1778, 1779, 1782 and 1783. During Cornwallis's Virginia campaign in 1781, the notorious Colonel Tarleton ransacked his home. In August 1781, Lafayette sent him to Portsmouth, Virginia on a reconnaissance. He found the British had embarked for Yorktown. Parker recovered 25 cannons the British had thrown into the sea to prevent their capture. Post-war In 1786, Parker was commissioned a naval officer at Portsmouth, Virginia. He ran to become a delegate to the 1788 Virginia Convention, since he opposed surrendering Virginia's hard won independence by ratifying the United States Constitution. However, he was elected to the First United States Congress, was reelected to the Second and Third Congresses. He was elected as a Federalist to the Fourth through Sixth United States Congress. Declaring it was time to \\"wipe off the stigma\\" of slavery that stained America, Parker became the first national legislator in American history to formally introduce an antislavery motion in congress. Parker then returned home and engaged in agriculture. He died in 1810, and was buried in the family cemetery on his plantation, \\"Macclesfield\\", in Isle of Wight County, Virginia. Legacy The Capture of the Hessians by John Trumbull, Parker is on the far left, dressed in white His grandson, Leopold Copeland Parker Cowper, served in the Virginia House of Delegates as lieutenant governor in the Restored Government of Virginia during the American Civil War. The Col. Josiah Parker Family Cemetery was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2004. A World War II Liberty Ship, SS Josiah Parker, was named in his honor.

He played 16 seasons in Major League Baseball (MLB) from to for the Chicago Cubs, Brooklyn Dodgers, Cincinnati Reds, New York Giants and Philadelphia Athletics. Galan threw right-handed and began his career as a switch hitter, however, starting in the latter part of , he became strictly a left-handed hitter until the end of his career. He was listed as tall and . Early life One of eight children, Galan was born in Berkeley, California. Galan‚Äôs parents had emigrated from France in the late 19th century, and his father operated a French hand laundry on Berkeley‚Äôs University Avenue. At age 11, Augie Galan broke his right elbow playing sandlot ball. He concealed the injury from his parents, fearful of being barred from further play. The arm was never set, healed improperly, and it was never fully healthy throughout Galan's professional career. He graduated from Berkeley High School. Minor leagues Galan started in the Texas League and graduated to the San Francisco Seals of the Pacific Coast League in 1932. In 1933 he was PCL Most Valuable Player, and in 1934 was purchased by the Cubs. Major Leagues In a 16-season big-league career, Galan posted a .287 batting average with 1,706 hits, 100 home runs and 830 runs batted in in 1,742 games played. He twice led the National League in stolen bases, with 22 thefts in and 23 in . He also led the Senior Circuit in runs scored (133 in ) and bases on balls (103 in and 101 in ), and four times exceeded .800 in OPS, each time finishing in the NL's Top Ten in that category. In 1937, Galan was the first National Leaguer to hit home runs from both sides of the plate in a game.Solomon, Abbot Neil, \\"Baseball Records Illustrated\\", Quintet Publishing, London, 1988. Galan was selected to three National League All-Star teams and homered off Schoolboy Rowe in the 1936 contest to help power the senior circuit to a 4‚Äì3 victory. He also played in three World Series (1935 and 1938 with the Cubs, and 1941 with the Dodgers), but his teams never won. Galan collected four fall classic hits in 29 total at bats (.138). He reached the .300 plateau six times. In 1935, he became the first full-time player to make 649 plate appearances and not hit into a double play, though he hit into a triple play. That year, he led the National League with 133 runs scored. Often injured (he broke his knee in 1940), Galan had a deformed arm from a childhood injury. The knee injury eventually forced him to give up batting from the right side of the plate. Later life After leaving the major leagues in 1949, Galan returned to the San Francisco Bay Area and played two more seasons with the Oakland Oaks of the Pacific Coast League, then managed the club to a 77‚Äì103 record (seventh place) in 1953. He joined the Philadelphia Athletics' coaching staff in , their last year in that city, and went on to spend 17 years as a minor league coach and manager in the Athletics' organization. Galan died in 1993 in Fairfield, California, at 81 years of age. He was survived by his wife of 40 years, Shirley, and four children, Karen Dumont of Redding, Calif., Adrianne Hain of Napa, Calif, Augie Jr. of Portland, Ore. and Darcy Rafferty of Newark, N.J.

As a middle distance runner he was best known for the 800 metres world record that he set in Milan in 1939. He also held the European record in the 400 metres from 1939 until 1955. Life Harbig was born in Dresden, the son of a stoker. From an early age, he joined local sports clubs as an amateur runner and handball player. Having finished school, he began an apprenticeship as a wheelwright but did not obtain an employment due to the Great Depression. Instead he set out for his journeyman years traveling throughout Germany. Back in Dresden, to make a living, he joined the Reichswehr armed forces in 1932. Harbig, as a professional soldier, continued to participate in track events. On 24 June 1934, he competed in an 800 metres event at the Dresdner SC stadium, won, and was asked to join the preparations for the 1936 Summer Olympics in Berlin. He began a comprehensive interval training supervised by the Dresdner SC officials and athletics coach Josef Waitzer. In summer 1935 he left the military to concentrate on his sporting career, while he still had to take on part-time jobs to earn money. Olympian athlete In July 1936, Harbig won the 800 metres final at the German Athletics Championships at the Mommsenstadion in Berlin, ahead of his toughest rival Wolfgang Dessecker, and obtained the permission to start at the Summer Olympics in August. After three weeks of intensive training, he fell ill with a gastrointestinal infections. So weakened, he arrived in the Berlin Olympiastadion and took a disappointing sixth place in the first heat of the 800 metres, defeated by Canadian Olympian Phil Edwards. Contrary to some official's concerns, he nevertheless stood as a member of the German 4 √ó 400 metres relay team, together with Friedrich von St√ºlpnagel, Helmut Hamann, and Harry Voigt. They established themselves in the preliminaries and won the bronze medal in the finals on August 9. Harbig was the final runner, closely followed by Canadian athlete John Loaring. On 1 May 1937 Harbig joined the Nazi Party, he also held the rank of a Sturmmann of the SA paramilitary forces. He regularly participated in the Party's Struggle Games during the Nuremberg Rallies and voluntarily served the propaganda purposes of Nazi sports official Karl Ritter von Halt. This was coupled with his ultimate rise to the top of German athletics, moving from victory to victory. In July he won the 800 metres at the German Athletics Championships for the second time, equalling the eleven-year-old German record of Otto Peltzer, and one week later made another German best time in the 400 metres at the Berlin Olympiastadion. One year later Harbig won the 400 metres at the ISTAF Berlin and again the 800 metres at the German Championships at the Hermann‚ÄìG√∂ring‚ÄìStadion in Breslau. On September 4 he defeated his long-time rival Mario Lanzi from Italy at the 1938 European Championships in Athletics in Paris over 800 m in a time of 1:50.6 min. At the same championships he won the gold medal with the German 4x400 m relay team. In the same summer the British runner Sydney Wooderson had set a remarkable new world record over 800 m at 1:48.4 min. When, in 1939, Harbig set a new national record of 1:49.4 he knew that the world record was not an unrealistic prospect. However, in the same season, Mario Lanzi ran a time of 1:49.5 in Pisa. The two rivals met in Milan in July for a much-celebrated race over 800 m on a 500 m-track. In his usual manner Lanzi took the lead and was still in front on the final bend. However, at the start of the 125 m-home-straight Harbig overtook him with an astonishing sprint. He finished with a new world record of 1:46.6 min. Lanzi, behind him, set a new Italian record of 1:49.0. In the following years Harbig's time turned out to be a very hard record to break. Even track legends Arthur Wint and Mal Whitfield could not threaten it. Not until August 1955 the Belgian runner Roger Moens could set a new world record of 1:45.7. Also, in 1939 Harbig set a world record over 400 m on a 500 m-track in Frankfurt in 46.0 sec. In Dresden in 1941 he set a world record over 1000 m in 2:21.5. World War II and death Harbig's career declined upon the outbreak of World War II in September 1939, whereafter he lost many of his training possibilities. Urged by Nazi official Hans von Tschammer und Osten and Guido von Mengden, Harbig joined the Wehrmacht forces in occupied Poland, while he still prepared for the 1940 Summer Olympics. In the winter of 1940-41 he was drafted to the Fallschirmj√§ger (paratrooper) forces at the Broitzem airbase in Braunschweig. On 24 May 1941 he set another world record over 800 metres at the Ilgen-Kampfbahn in Dresden. Later in 1941, Harbig was sent to the Eastern Front and fought in the Battle of Moscow. During the Soviet Dnieper‚ÄìCarpathian Offensive against the Wehrmacht Army Group South, he was killed fighting with the 2nd Parachute Division at the Voronezh Front near Kirovohrad, Ukraine in 1944. Holding the rank of Feldwebel (Sergeant) at the time, he served in Fallschirmj√§ger-Regiment 6 under the command of Hauptmann (Captain) Friedrich August von der Heydte as a platoon leader. The exact circumstances of his death are not known. ReferencesSources * Wallechinsky, David (2004). The Complete Book of the Summer Olympics, Toronto: Sport Classic Books.

Consisting of late Eocene to Oligocene epoch rock, it lies within the Gifford Pinchot National Forest. Long inactive, the volcano sits over three lithologic units (distinct units of rock, each with different physical characteristics), including the large Silver Star Granodiorite unit. Silver Star Mountain and the surrounding area, in contrast to the rest of the local backcountry, has a ridge-like appearance, creating a striking skyline similar to mountains further north in the Cascade Range. The area lacks trees, and comprises steep cliffs, talus slopes, and meadows filled with wildflowers. The volcano can be hiked and has been noted for its trails by local mountaineers.  Geography  Silver Star Mountain lies in Skamania County, in the U.S. state of Washington. According to the North American Vertical Datum of 1988, it reaches an elevation of , though the Geographic Names Information System database lists its elevation at , and The Columbian gives its height as . The volcano lies in the western segment of the Middle Cascades. It is about north of the western edge of the Columbia River Gorge and is accessible from United States Forest Service roads connected to Washington state highways. The volcano sits in the southwestern corner of the Gifford Pinchot National Forest, which encompasses an area of in southwestern Washington state.  Physical geography  The Silver Star Mountain area consists of an eroded plateau, largely made up of lava, with an average relief of about and reaching a local maximum elevation of . Unlike the rest of the western Cascade backcountry, it has a ridge-like appearance, creating a striking skyline similar to mountains further north in the Cascade Range. The area lacks trees and comprises steep cliffs, talus slopes, and meadows filled with wildflowers. The locale drains into the Washougal River and the Lewis River's South Fork, which flow to the south and west respectively. Erosion by these rivers has dissected the land, producing a relief of . Precipitation reaches a peak during the winter season, usually deposited as snow that produces drifts, especially in deep canyons in the area. These drifts often remain until the summer, feeding small streams in the vicinity. Surface runoff has increased due to the removal of forest cover by historical fires, including large fires in 1902 and 1929. As a result, runoff has eroded gullies on local slopes and increased removal of soil. However, there are talus slopes with heights up to , which cover a large amount of the granodiorite deposit. Small cirque-like basins, likely carved out by small glaciers, occur in a few of the larger canyons, with depressions up to in depth. These often host tarn lakes, and some support snowdrifts. Soil on and around the mountain has been eroded by repeated fires, including the Yacolt Burn in 1902 and 16 additional fires through 1929. Slow regrowth motivated the Civilian Conservation Corps to plant more trees during the 1930s, and terracing was also used during the 1960s to facilitate better vegetation regrowth.  Ecology  Wildflowers grow at unusually low elevations at Silver Star Mountain, as a result of fires, wind, and rocky subsoil. There are more than 100 types of wildflowers and flowering shrubs on the volcano, such as heather, star tulip, tiger lily, Grey's loveage, hairbell, bear grass, western bistort, columbine, Avalanche lily, broadleaf lupine, wooly sunflower, Cardwell's penstemon, Indian paintbrush, phlox, balsamroot, and glacier lilies. Trails around the volcano, in addition to offering views of wildflower-cover slopes, pass through thickets of huckleberry, as well as forests with noble fir.  Geology  In the area surrounding Silver Star Mountain, rocks forms three discrete lithologic units (characterized by visible physical characteristics or the gross physical character of the rock). The Eagle Creek rock formation is the oldest, likely dating to the Oligocene epoch (or the lower Miocene). The rock consists mostly of cream-colored, vitric tuffs, which have undergone weathering that has converted them to a yellow or white colored soil, though there are also multicolored tuffs, which vary from red to green and purple breccias. Often their color depends on the extent of inner iron compounds. They display little assortment or bedding, indicating that they likely accumulated subaerially. Rocks from the formation form outcrops on the eastern part of the Silver Star Mountain locale, and are exposed in central parts of the Columbia River Gorge. Other exposures from the Eagle Creek formation can be observed in Silver, Bluebird, and Bear creeks, where they occur in canyons along the eastern part of the locale. The second, younger unit is the Skamania Andesites, which sit atop the Eagle Creek deposits and consist of thick layers of andesite interbedded with minor inclusions of breccia and pyroclastic material. Less exposed than the Eagle Creek deposits, they are often detectable within of the surface, sitting disconformably over the Eagle Creek rock layers as a result of thorough erosion. At other points, including the eastern border of the Silver Star area, they occur between layers of the Eagle Creek tuffs, possibly due to partially overlapping deposition times or the combination of the tuff deposition and andesite extrusion. The Skamania Andesites encompass the largest distribution of the three lithologic formations in the area, forming thin lava flows that suggest extrusion as highly fluid lava. Andesites located higher on the Silver Star Mountain edifice have undergone less erosion than deposits at lower elevations. The age of the Skamania Andesites is not known, though Felts (1939) hypothesized that they were formed during the pre-middle Miocene epoch. They have a gray to green-gray color and are porphyritic, containing smaller amounts of breccia and tuff, as well as phenocrysts with plagioclase, augite, and magnetite. The phenocrysts range from in size, with an average diameter of . Sometimes, they contain chlorite or similar minerals. Rocks from the upper third of the Skamania Andesites have a similar composition, but they are more vesicular in texture. The third unit is called the Silver Star Granodiorite, which is made up of augite diorite and quartz diorite. Dikes with quartz, tourmaline, and sericite occur within the mass, which has a light color aggregated from white to pink plagioclase with orthoclase, clear quartz, and black to green biotite and hornblende crystals. About in length and ranging from in width, it lies along a long axis angled at twenty degrees to the east. It has steep walls which have not been excavated by local canyons that cut into nearby rock. Felts (1939) suggested that the stock intruded at an angle of 20 degrees east of north. The stock cuts through the Eagle Creek formation and the lower two-thirds of the Skamania Andesites, forming metamorphic rock and small dikes of granodiorite and aplite into their tuff and andesite deposits. The absence of dikes or intrusions in the upper third of the Skamania Andesites formation suggests a time gap between the extrusion of the lower and upper segments, during which the granodiorite intrusion occurred. The granodiorite has been altered to create talus, and there are few outcrops, which only occur at stream bottoms and rarely at cliffs that have not been covered with talus. Lava flows, likely produced during the Pleistocene epoch, were deposited in the Lewis River canyon to the west of the Silver Star Mountain and in the Wind River canyon to the east. Silver Star Mountain consists of late Eocene epoch to Oligocene epoch rock, particularly calc-alkaline volcaniclastic sediment. These rock formations were intruded on the mountain's eastern side by the Silver Star intrusion, a deep stock of granodiorite and quartz diorite that also formed small deposits of copper in the area. Calc-alkaline volcaniclastic sediments, referred to as the Skamania Volcanics, lie nearby and are overlapped by the Troutdale Formation. During the Miocene epoch, these deposits formed hills to the north of the major Columbia River valley, with sufficient height to prevent flooding. Silver Star Mountain is the center of a pluton of magma that was injected into the area 20 million years ago and cooled to solid rock under the surface, producing small deposits of gold, zinc, copper, zeolites, quartz and calcite. Small abandoned gold mines can be found in creek bottoms throughout the area. E.A. Dole, an early settler, struck silver on the mountain in 1874. He named the mine Silver Star Quartz Ledge. The ore gathered was assayed at 41.17 silver and 63.72 lead per ton. Granite has been documented near the foot of the mountain on the Columbia River, about northeast of the city of Washougal. The volcano produced a dike made of granodiorite, which sits nearby. Much of the local soil formed from granodiorite deposits and volcanic ash.  Human history  A number of ditches near Silver Star Mountain known as the Indian Pits can be seen on one of the trails, which is known as the Indian Pits Trail #180E. These ditches also occur in other parts of the Columbia River Gorge area. Archaeologists debate the purpose of these pits, though three prominent hypotheses have emerged. One states that the pits were built by Native Americans to seek spiritual visions, while another claims that the pits served as blinds for hunting mountain sheep and goats fleeing cougars or wolves down local talus slopes or other hunters in brush below. The third hypothesis theorizes that the pits were used to store food. The September 1902 Yacolt Burn started as a slash fire near the city of Stevenson. Spread by a strong, eastward blowing wind, it burned forest for , reaching the town of Yacolt and killing 38 people. The fire encompassed close to of land across southwest Washington state, including parts of Clark, Cowlitz, and Skamania counties. 16 smaller fires followed in the next few decades, prompting government agencies to build a fire lookout on Silver Star, on the higher north peak known as \\"Star Lo\\", which was installed in 1952, but was removed by 1969. The Yacolt Burn State Forest was named after the 1902 fire.  Recreation  The Silver Star Mountain area is lightly used for hiking. The Silver Star trail runs to an old roadbed located west of Silver Star Mountain, while the Silver Star Summit Trail #180D, long, reaches the summit of Silver Star Mountain. Indian Pits Trail #180E and Pyramid Rock Trail #180F branch off the Silver Star Trail to the south of Silver Star Mountain. From Ed's Trail #180A, named after Edward Robinson, one of the pioneers of the Chinook Trail Association, hikers can see views of nearby volcanoes, including Mount Saint Helens, Mount Rainier, Mount Adams, Mount Hood, and Mount Jefferson on particularly clear days. This has been described by local hikers as one of the best hikes in Washington state, only gaining about in elevation between the Silver Star and Ed's Trails. Trail #172 Bluff Mountain offers views of the Vancouver and Portland metropolitan area. The trail area is administered by the United States Forest Service, and the Mount Adams Ranger District serves as its information center. A number of the trails were built by and are still maintained by the Chinook Trails Association.

Thus, Anquetin's works following the mid-1890s, such as Rinaldo and Armida, were especially Rubensian and allegorical in nature. In 1907 he met Jacques Maroger, a young artist who shared his interest, with whom he collaborated. Later in life, Anquetin wrote a book on Rubens, which was published in 1924. He died in Paris.

He was the commander of the Eastern Army of the Ottoman Empire at the end of World War I and served as Speaker of the Grand National Assembly of Turkey before his death. Early life Karabekir was born in 1882 as the son of an Ottoman general, Mehmet Emin Pasha, in the Kocamustafapa≈üa quarter of the Kuleli neighborhood of Constantinople, in the Ottoman Empire. The Karabekir family traced its heritage back to the medieval Karamanid Principality, in central Anatolia. Karabekir toured several places in the Ottoman Empire while his father served in the army. He returned to Istanbul in 1893 with his mother after his father died in Mecca. They settled in the Zeyrek Quarter. Karabekir was put into Fatih Military Secondary School the next year. After finishing his education there, he attended the Kuleli Military High School from which he graduated in 1899. He continued his education at the Ottoman Military College, which he finished on 6 December 1902 at the top of his class. Military career XV Corps and landed at Trabzon on 19 April 1919 As a junior officer, he was commissioned in January 1906 after two months to the Third Army in the region around Bitola in North Macedonia. There, he was involved in fights with Greek and Bulgarian komitadjis. For his successful service, he was promoted to the rank of senior captain in 1907. In the following years, he served in Constantinople and again in the Second Army in Edirne. On 15 April 1911, K√¢zƒ±m applied to change his family name from Zeyrek to Karabekir. Until then, he had been called K√¢zƒ±m Zeyrek, after the place in which he lived with his mother, a custom in the Ottoman Empire as family names were not used. From then on, he adopted the name Karabekir, the name of his ancestors. Balkan Wars During his service in Edirne, Karabekir was promoted to the rank of major on 27 April 1912. He took part in the First Balkan War against Bulgarian forces but was captured during the Battle of Edirne-Kale on 22 April 1913. He remained a prisoner-of-war until the armistice of 21 October 1913. World War I Before the outbreak of World War I, Karabekir served in Constantinople and was then sent to some European countries like Austria- Hungary, Germany, France and Switzerland. In July 1914, he returned home, as a world war was likely. Back in Constantinople, Karabekir was assigned the chief of intelligence at the General Staff. Soon, he was promoted to lieutenant colonel. After a short time on the southeastern front, he was sent to the Dardanelles. As commander of the 14th Division, Karabekir fought in the Battle of Gallipoli in the summer of 1915. In October 1915, he was appointed chief staff officer at the First Army in Istanbul. He was commissioned to the Iraqi front to join the Sixth Army. For his success at Gallipoli, he was decorated in December 1915 by both the Ottoman and the German Commands and was contemporaneously promoted to colonel. In April 1916, he took over the command of the 18th Corps, which gained a great victory over the British forces led by General Charles Townshend during the Siege of Kut-al Amara in Iraq. Karabekir was appointed commander of the 2nd Corps on the Caucasian front and fought bitterly against the Russian and Armenian forces for almost ten months. In September 1917, he was promoted to brigadier general by a decree of the Sultan. Turkish War of Independence K√¢zƒ±m Karabekir during the Turkish War of Independence In compliance with the Treaty of S√®vres, which ended World War I, Ottoman Sultan Mehmet Vahdettin gave Karabekir the order to surrender to Entente powers, which he refused to obey. He stayed in the region and, on the eve of the Erzurum Congress, when Mustafa Kemal (Atat√ºrk) had just arrived in Erzurum, he secured the city with a cavalry brigade under his command to protect him and the congressmen. He pledged with Mustafa Kemal to join the Turkish national movement and then took the command of the Eastern Front during the Turkish War of Independence by the Kuva-yi Milliye. In early September 1920, Karabekir commenced the first military operations against the Democratic Republic of Armenia. There were brief small-scale skirmishes in the region of Olti, but as the Turkish offensive elicited virtually no reaction from the Allied Powers, Karabekir opened up the offensive. On 28 September, he sent four divisions from the XV Army Corps across the Armenian border with the objective of capturing the strategic fortress of Sarikamish. Sarikamish was taken the following day, and the rest of the Turkish advance continued unchecked. Throughout October, Armenian resistance progressively collapsed, and the Turkish armies captured Kars on 30 October and occupied Alexandropol, a major centre of the new Armenian Republic, on 6 November.Hovannisian. Republic of Armenia, Vol. IV, pp. 237‚Äì282. A ceasefire was concluded on 18 November, and negotiations were carried out between Karabekir and a peace delegation, led by Alexander Khatisian, in Alexandropol. Although Karabekir‚Äôs terms were extremely harsh, the Armenian delegation had little recourse but to agree to them. Karabekir affixed his signature under the peace agreement, the Treaty of Alexandropol, which was signed on 2/3 December 1920.Hovannisian. Republic of Armenia, Vol. IV, pp. 394‚Äì396. He was designated by the new Grand National Assembly in Ankara to sign also the friendship agreement Treaty of Kars with the Soviet Union on 23 October 1921. Political career Grand National Assembly of Turkey After the defeat of Greek forces in Western Anatolia, the Republic of Turkey was proclaimed. K√¢zƒ±m Karabekir Pasha moved to Ankara in October 1922 and continued to serve in the parliament as Deputy of Edirne. He was still the acting commander of the Eastern Army when he was elected Deputy of Constantinople on 29 June 1923. Six months later, he was appointed Inspector of the First Army. The received the highest Turkish award by the parliament, the \\"Order of Independence\\" for his meritorious and distinguished service in the military and politics during the War of Independence. He retired from military service in October 1924 and then entered politics. Karabekir had differences of opinion with Mustafa Kemal about the realization of Atat√ºrk's Reforms, one of the most important being the abolition of caliphate. Even though he agreed with Mustafa Kemal on the subject, he did not agree with him on immediate action. For Karabekir, the timing was inappropriate because British forces stood at the border of southeastern Turkey and claimed Kirkuk, now in Iraq. Karabekir did not believe that the caliphate should be abolished before the was solved. Kurds, more radical in their Shafi Sunni beliefs, began to rise against the government because they thought that the government would abolish religion after it ended the caliphate. Struggling with the rebellion, Turkey agreed to leave Kirkuk to Iraq, which was under the British mandate. Such conflicts prompted tensions between Karabekir and Mustafa Kemal. On 17 November 1924, several politicians around Karabekir and Ali Fuat Cebesoy founded the political movement Progressive Republican Party (Terakkiperver Cumhuriyet Fƒ±rkasƒ±), which had several prominent current and former military commanders in his members.Heper, Metin; Landau, Jacob M. (1991), p.72‚Äì73 Afterwards, the party's recent members were blamed for the Sheikh Said rebellion and the assassination attempt made against Mustafa Kemal in ƒ∞zmir.The party was closed on 5 June 1925 by the government, and Karabekir was imprisoned by the Independence Tribunals with many of his party members but later acquitted and released. Following those developments, all relations were broken between Karabekir and Mustafa Kemal. Retiring temporarily from politics, Karabekir devoted himself to writing his memoirs of the Turkish War of Independence and Atat√ºrk's Reforms. After Kemal Atat√ºrk died in 1938, Karabekir's close friend ƒ∞smet ƒ∞n√∂n√º rehabilitated him. In 1939, K√¢zƒ±m Karabekir returned to politics and re-entered parliament as an MP from Istanbul. He was elected speaker of the parliament on 5 August 1946. He died in office at the age of 66 on 26 January 1948 in Ankara after a heart attack. His remains were later relocated to the Turkish State Cemetery in Ankara. K√¢zƒ±m Karabekir was survived by his wife ƒ∞clal and three daughters Hayat, Emel, and Timsal. The four-story mansion in the Erenk√∂y quarter of Kadƒ±k√∂y district in Istanbul, where he lived for almost 15 years, was converted into a museum in 2005.

Archigenes was the most celebrated of the sect of the Eclectici, and was a native of Apamea in Syria; he practised at Rome in the time of Trajan, 98-117, where he enjoyed a very high reputation for his professional skill. He is, however, reprobated as having been fond of introducing new and obscure terms into the science, and having attempted to give to medical writings a dialectic form, which produced rather the appearance than the reality of accuracy. Archigenes published a treatise on the pulse, on which Galen wrote a Commentary; it appears to have contained a number of minute and subtle distinctions, many of which have no real existence, and were for the most part the result rather of a preconceived hypothesis than of actual observation; and the same remark may be applied to an arrangement which he proposed of fevers. Archigenes, however, not only enjoyed a considerable degree of the public confidence during his lifetime, but left behind him a number of disciples, who for many years maintained a respectable rank in their profession. The name of the father of Archigenes was Philippus; he was a pupil of Agathinus, whose life he once saved; and he died at the age either of 63 or 83.Suda, under 'ŒëœÅœáŒπŒ≥; Eudocia Violarum The titles of several of Archigenes' works are preserved, of which, however, nothing but a few fragments remain; some of these have been preserved by other ancient authors, and some are still in manuscript in the King's Library at Paris.Cramer, (1839), Anecdota Graeca Paris. vol. i. pp. 394, 395.

Parts includes Lower Saxony, Groningen, Gelderland, Overijssel, Drenthe, Friesland, Frisia and East Frisia and England. The name comes from the ancient medieval place Duchy of Saxony, where the name spread in the early Middle Ages. The area was part of the Carolingian stem duchy tribes covering the greater part of Northern Germany, Netherlands and England. Some tribes eventually immigrated to England at the Early Middle Ages. It is also part of the Anglo surnames in English; many had an aristocratic origin inter mixed married with Germanic and English Royal houses in the Middle Ages when there were English rulers in mainland Europe. One of the famous ones is the house of Welf, a European dynasty that has included many German, Dutch and British monarchs. These names are common in the Netherlands, Germany and England. The Netherlands did not exist until the late 16th century, so the surname has a bigger origin from a different and bigger dynasties.

Keogh, Congressman from New York Keogh plans are a type of retirement plan for self-employed people and small businesses in the United States. History Named for U.S. Representative Eugene James Keogh of New York, they are sometimes called HR10 plans. IRS Publication 560 refers to them as \\"Qualified Plans\\". They are different from individual retirement accounts (IRAs). Format There are two basic types of Keogh plan: defined-benefit, and defined-contribution. In a defined-contribution plan, a fixed contribution (percentage of total paycheck or a fixed sum) is made per pay period. It may be set up as a profit-sharing plan, where the pension that one can withdraw after retirement depends on how much they invested in the plan while they worked. The defined-benefits plan is more complex. It relies on an IRS formula to calculate the rate of contributions. In either case, as in other retirement plans such as 401(k)s and IRAs, the funds in the plan can be invested in stocks, bonds, mutual funds, etc. Benefits The main benefit of a Keogh plan versus other retirement plans is that a Keogh plan has higher contribution limits for some individuals. For 2011, employees can generally contribute up to $16,500 per year, and the employer can contribute up to $32,500, for a total annual contribution of $49,000. The total contribution cap is $50,000 for 2012, $51,000 for 2013, $52,000 for 2014, and up to 25% of compensation or $53,000 in 2016, whichever is lower. A person with a Keogh plan can also contribute to an IRA (traditional or Roth). Drawbacks Keogh plans are not as common as most other retirement plans because there are several limitations to Keogh plans. Compared to other retirement plans (traditional IRA, SIMPLE IRA, etc.), Keogh plans require more administrative paperwork. While most small business owners can manage to set up other plans themselves, a Keogh plan requires complex calculations and professional help to establish. They've been largely replaced by SEP IRAs, which have the same contribution limits but much less paperwork. Keogh plans cannot be established by an employee. Keogh plans are applicable to self-employed individuals who own their own unincorporated business (sole proprietorships, partnerships and LLCs). All contributions must be made \\"pre-tax\\", meaning that the contributions can be deducted from this year's tax, but taxes must be paid on the money when it is withdrawn during retirement. There is no such thing as a \\"Roth Keogh plan\\". Penalties may apply for making withdrawals from a Keogh plan before the account holder turns 59¬Ω. The main benefit of a Keogh plan versus other plans (Keogh's high contribution limit) is lost in individuals who do not make a high level of income. These individuals may get the same benefits of a Keogh plan with less administrative cost by using another type of retirement plan (401(k), SEP-IRA, etc.). This is best illustrated by comparing the following three scenarios: Scenario #1 ‚Äì A self-employed accountant makes $50,000 per year from her accounting business. Her maximum contribution is 25% of her post-contribution income ($10,000, which would be the same as saying 20% of her gross income), regardless of whether she uses a SEP-IRA, Keogh plan, or SIMPLE 401(k). Since there are less administrative costs, she would benefit most from choosing either the SEP-IRA or SIMPLE 401(k). Scenario #2 ‚Äì A family physician who owns his own practice makes $100,000 per year. His maximum contribution is 25% of his post-contribution income ($20,000, which would be the same as saying 20% of his gross income) whether he uses a Keogh plan or a SEP-IRA. The cost of maintaining the SEP-IRA is much less, so he would benefit more from that plan. Scenario #3 ‚Äì An entrepreneur who owns a small marketing firm makes $400,000 per year. She wishes to contribute as much as possible to a retirement plan in order to minimize her current taxes. She could contribute up to $11,500 for a SIMPLE IRA, $49,000 to a SEP-IRA, or up to $50,000 (contribution cap for 2012) in a Keogh plan. By choosing the Keogh plan over the SEP-IRA, she can contribute an additional $1,000 per year into her retirement plan.

military, local militias and members of the Native American tribes of the Nisqually, Muckleshoot, Puyallup, and Klickitat. Another component of the war, however, were raiders from the Haida and Tlingit who came into conflict with the United States Navy during contemporaneous raids on the native peoples of Puget Sound. Although limited in its magnitude, territorial impact and losses in terms of lives, the conflict is often remembered in connection to the 1856 Battle of Seattle and to the wrongful execution of a central figure of the war, Nisqually Chief Leschi. The contemporaneous Yakima War may have been responsible for some events of the Puget Sound War, such as the Battle of Seattle, and it is not clear that the people of the time made a strong distinction between the two conflicts. The War The Puget Sound War began over land rights and ended in a cloud of controversy surrounding the hanging of Leschi. The catalyst of the war was the Treaty of Medicine Creek of 1854. Negotiated by Washington Territory Governor Isaac Stevens, the treaty preserved Indian fishing rights, but took away prime Nisqually farmland.Janice E. Schuetz, Episodes in Rhetoric of Government-Indian Relations, (Westport: Praeger, 2002), 1-24. Leschi, chosen to negotiate the treaty with Stevens, was outraged and chose to fight rather than give up his land.J.A. Eckrom, Remembered Drums: A History of the Puget Sound Indian War, (Walla Walla: Pioneer Press, 1989), 1-30. The fighting commenced in October 1855, when \\"Eaton's Rangers,\\" a citizen militia under Captain Charles Eaton, were involved in a clash with Nisqually tribesmen. Two militiamen, Joseph Miller and Abram Benton Moses, were killed. Upon hearing the news, Governor Stevens immediately dispatched a company to locate Leschi and \\"escort\\" him back to Olympia. The war itself consisted of a series of short skirmishes with relatively few deaths on the American side. Notable battles occurred in present-day Tacoma, Seattle, and even as far east as Walla Walla. In particular, on October 28, 1855, a party of natives killed eight settlers in what was later called the White River Massacre. Three children fled on foot to Seattle, but one five-year-old boy was kidnapped and held by the natives for six months before being released. A conflicting source describes the attack as being a Nisqually band led by Chief Leschi and reported nine Settlers killed. Two boys and a girl were taken from the battle and returned unharmed to an American steamer at Point Elliot. A memoir of the event emphasized that families were warned ahead of time so they could evacuate: \\"The Indians sent us word not to be afraid - that they would not harm us.\\" Some of the families included members of the volunteer companies who had been roaming the area attacking peaceful Indians. In response to the attack at White River, the Americans captured around 4,000 noncombatants Native Americans and moved them to Fox Island for close observation. Many of them died due to insufficient food, water, and shelter. Additionally, southwestern tribes who had no tradition of warfare were raided by fearful Americans. They were disarmed and their villages placed under surveillance. Upper and Lower Chehalis families were forcibly relocated to a farm near Steilacoom; coastal tribes such as the Cowlitz were moved to a site on the Chehalis River; the Chinook people were moved inland to Fort Vancouver. All people remained captive until at least the end of the war, nearly two years. The final battle of the war occurred on or about March 10, 1856, when a column of approximately 110 volunteers from the Washington Territorial Volunteers were ambushed near Connell's Prairie by a force estimated at 150 Native American tribesmen, supposedly led by Chief Leschi of the Nisqually tribe. After several hours of skirmishing and several charges by the Volunteers, the Natives withdrew, taking their dead and wounded with them, but leaving behind bloody clothing and drums, among other items. Following the battle, Leschi and his remaining warriors retreated over the Cascades into Eastern Washington. Leschi was captured in November 1856 and was forced to stand trial for the murder of Abram Benton Moses. His first trial resulted in a hung jury because of the question of the legitimacy of murder during wartime; the jury of twelve voted ten in favor, two opposed to conviction. Leschi was tried again in 1857. Despite vague witness accounts and issues over whether Leschi was actually at the scene of the incident, he was found guilty of murder. Leschi was hanged on February 19, 1858. Exoneration On December 10, 2004 a historical court convened in Pierce County, Washington ruled \\"as a legal combatant of the Indian War‚Ä¶ Leschi should not have been held accountable under law for the death of an enemy soldier,\\" thereby exonerating him of any wrongdoing.Seattle, Washington, Seattle Post-Intelligencer, 11 December 2004. Today, the Leschi neighborhood in Seattle and Chief Leschi School on the Puyallup Indian Reservation bear his name.Chief Leschi Schools, https://www.leschischools.org/, Aug. 11, 2016Leschi Elementary School, http://leschies.seattleschools.org/, Aug. 11, 2016 See also *Battle of Port Gamble *Cayuse War *Fraser Canyon War References * Hubert H.

Personal life Hall was born in Carrollton, Ohio in 1921 to Samuel and Beatrice Hall. He was married to actress Grayson Hall, an Academy Award nominee who appeared on both shows, as Dr. Julia Hoffman on Dark Shadows, and as Euphemia Ralston on One Life to Live.Sam Hall profile, imdb.com; accessed September 28, 2014. Hall later in his life took an active part in the production of a play he wrote, performed at the Rhinebeck Theatre's barn in the early 2000s. The play, about a group of American soldiers, not all as morally upright as we might wish, serving in France during WWII, was called \\"War Games\\", and it starred David Anderson, an excellent actor who headed up Walking the Dog, a theatre group in Hudson, New York. Wally Carbone directed. David Forman was the producer. Hall gave a wonderful cast party at his home in Rhinebeck, and his living room side table that night revealed that he was reading Alan Bennett's \\"Untold Stories.\\" Dark Shadows The first serial for which Hall wrote was The Brighter Day. After his wife was hired to appear on Dark Shadows, he was invited to become one of the writers. Hall and his writing partner, Gordon Russell, were best known for their work on Dark Shadows and One Life to Live. (Their son, Matthew Hall, was a later writer for the NBC revival of Dark Shadows.) One Life to Live After Dark Shadows wrapped, Hall and Russell then took over One Life to Live for Agnes Nixon who began to focus more on her other soap All My Children.

It consists of one species, Abeliophyllum distichum Nakai, endemic to Korea, where it is endangered in the wild, occurring at only seven sites. It is related to Forsythia, but differs in having white, not yellow, flowers. It is a deciduous shrub growing to 1‚Äì2 m tall. The leaves are opposite, simple, 6‚Äì10 cm long and 3‚Äì4.5 cm wide, pubescent both above and below. The flowers are produced in early spring before the new leaves appear; they are white and fragrant, about 1 cm long, with a four-lobed corolla. The fruit is a round, winged samara 2‚Äì3 cm diameter. It is cultivated as an ornamental plant in Europe and North America. Conservation status In 1998, a review of the plant's conservation status found that \\"it is close to extinction and qualifies for the IUCN Category of 'Critically Endangered', indicating a high risk of extinction in the near future.\\"; but as of 2009 it has not yet been formally assessed for the IUCN Red List.

He finished fifth in the 5000m final at the 1983 World Championships in Athletics in Helsinki, and seventh in the 5000m final at the 1984 Summer Olympics. In the 1983 World Championships 5,000-metre final, Padilla was among the favourites, but he succumbed to the radically accelerating pace of top runners, such as Ireland's Eamonn Coghlan, East Germany's Werner Schildhauer and Finland's Martti Vainio, during the last lap. He lost to the winner, Coghlan, by 3.55 seconds, but managed to defeat another unlucky favourite, West Germany's Thomas Wessinghage, by 0.38 seconds. By contrast, the fast 1984 Olympic 5,000-metre final was tough for Padilla already after 3,000 metres, and he painstakingly defeated New Zealand's John Walker who finished eighth.see, for example, \\"The World Athletics Championships 1983\\" / Yleisurheilun MM-kisat 1983, written by the \\"Runner\\" / Juoksija magazine's journalists and published in Finland in 1983; \\"The Big Olympic Book 4\\" / Suuri Olympiateos 4, published in Finland in 1984. He was ranked number 1 in the world in 1983 for the 3000-meter distance. Running career=Collegiate As an athlete, Padilla is one of the most decorated athletes in BYU history. While competing for the Cougars from 1978‚Äì81, he earned eight All-America citations and a National Championship in the indoor 2 Mile, regarded as one of the great moments in BYU Sports history. He rewrote the BYU record book, setting new marks in the indoor mile and two mile and outdoor 1500 and 5000 meters. In 1991, he was inducted into the BYU Athletic Hall of Fame. While still a collegian, he was called on to race two athletes that were current world-record-holders: Henry Rono of Kenya and Washington State, and Suleiman Nyambui of Tanzania and UTEP. Padilla came away with a victory over each, the latter to win the indoor national championship. Post-collegiate After college, Padilla was a 12-time US national champion while setting seven American records. His indoor two mile and indoor 5000 meters records each stood for over 20 years. A two-time Olympian, he is a veteran of five world championships. His accolades include victories in the 5000 meters at the 1985 World Cup and the 1986 Goodwill Games. From 1983 to 1987 he won five consecutive national indoor championships, four national outdoor championships, and two U.S. Olympic trials. In 1985 he was the IAAF World overall Grand Prix Champion. He is still the only runner to break the four-minute-mile barrier inside the state of Utah. Padilla was a very fast sprinter. When he was in top shape, he was known for his ability to outkick many other world-class runners, including the 10,000-metre European, World and Olympic champion Alberto Cova of Italy.see, for example, \\"The Sports Information 1985\\" / Urheilutieto 1985, a sports yearbook published in Finland in 1985 or 1986 Padilla lost his top form after 1986, and was eliminated in the 5,000-metre heats at the 1987 World Athletics Championships in Rome.see, for example, \\"The World Athletics Championships 1987\\" / Yleisurheilun MM-kisat 1987, written and published by the \\"Runner\\" magazine's journalists in Finland in 1987 He still qualified for the 1991 World Athletics Championships 5,000-metre final in Tokyo, but there he ran very badly, finishing 14th and last - and losing to the winner, Kenya's Yobes Ondieki, by over 1 minute 20 seconds.see, for example, \\"The World Athletics Championships 1991\\" / Yleisurheilun MM-kisat 1991, written by the \\"Runner\\" / Juoksija magazine's journalists and published in Finland in 1991 Administrative career Doug Padilla retired in August 2014 as BYU Track and Field Director of Operations.

In addition to being meet director of all BYU track and field and cross country meets, he was director of the BYU high school Invitational and the Utah UHSAA State Track and Field Championships. Under his leadership the presentation and execution of BYU track meets has risen to the level of some of the very best in the country.

He was drafted by the Chicago Bears in the second round of the 2004 NFL Draft. He played college football at Washington. Early years Johnson was born in Gary, Indiana. His father moved him to Arizona when he was six years old. He attended McClintock High School in Tempe, Arizona, where he had a B-plus grade average. As a senior, he had 21 receptions, 211 yards, 4 touchdowns, 47 tackles, 3 sacks and 3 forced fumbles. He was two-time All-city and All-region honoree. In basketball, he received Pepperdine Prep All- American honors as a senior. In volleyball, he received All-state, All-region and All-city honors. College career Johnson accepted a football scholarship from the University of Washington. He originally was recruited to play tight end. As a freshman he was suspended as a partial qualifier. As a sophomore, he was converted into a defensive tackle. He appeared in 10 games as a backup, making 4 tackles (one for loss). He missed the fifth game against UCLA with a sore knee. As a junior, he started 11 out of 13 games at defensive tackle. He registered 25 tackles (9.5 for loss), 5 sacks, one interception (returned for a touchdown) and one forced fumble. He contributed to a defense that ranked 11th in the nation with 97.7 rushing yards allowed per game. As a senior, he started 12 games at both defensive tackle and defensive end. He posted 35 tackles, 10 sacks (led the team), 18.5 tackles for loss (led the team), one forced fumble and one fumble recovery (scored a touchdown). He finished his college career with 23 starts out of 35 games, collecting 64 tackles (29 for loss), 15 sacks, one interception, 2 passes defensed, 2 forced fumbles and one fumble recovery. Professional career=2004 NFL CombineChicago Bears Johnson was selected by the Chicago Bears in the second round (47th overall) of the 2004 NFL Draft. As a rookie, he appeared in 16 games with one start, making 26 tackles and a half sack. In 2005, he played in 16 games with 4 starts, making 37 tackles (4 for loss), 5 sacks (fourth on the team) and 4 passes defensed. He had 8 tackles and 2 sacks against the Baltimore Ravens. Along with teammates Tommie Harris, Brian Urlacher, Lance Briggs, and Nathan Vasher, Johnson helped the Bears' establish the league's most productive defense during the season. In 2006, Johnson saw more action due to the loss of injured Tommie Harris, allowing him to start 10 games, as the team reached Super Bowl XLI. He posted 38 tackles (2 for loss), 3.5 sacks and one forced fumble. On January 23, 2007, two days after the Bears won the NFC Championship Game, Johnson was forced to appear in Circuit court to request permission to leave the State of Illinois to travel to Miami, Florida to play in Super Bowl XLI stemming from an arrest on gun charges late in 2006. The request was granted, and he played in the game, recording four tackles, assisting on another, and getting a half-sack. On May 16, 2007, Johnson met with NFL commissioner Roger Goodell to determine punishment for his off-the-field transgressions, with Goodell eventually imposing an eight- game suspension, with the possibility of a reduction to six games if Johnson followed certain requirements for violating the NFL player conduct policy. On June 25, 2007, three days after being pulled for speeding by the police in Gilbert, Arizona, the Bears waived Johnson, although there were no criminal charges. Dallas Cowboys On September 18, 2007, Jerry Jones the owner of the Dallas Cowboys, took a chance and signed Johnson as a free agent, to provide depth after losing Jason Ferguson for the year with a torn right biceps. He was forced to miss the first eight games, suspended by the league for violating probation on a gun charge. On November 11, he returned to the field against the New York Giants, making 3 solo tackles and one sack. He didn't perform as well as expected while playing nose tackle in a 3-4 defense, instead of defensive tackle in a 4-3 scheme, additionally Jay Ratliff had a break-out year, earning the starting position. He finished the season with 10 tackles, 2 sacks, one quarterback pressure, one pass defensed and one forced fumble. In 2008, he played through a sprained ankle in a reserve role behind Ratliff. He posted 45 tackles (3 for loss), one sack, 9 quarterback pressures, 3 passes defensed and one forced fumble. Even though Johnson had no off-field issues in Dallas, he wasn't re-signed at the end of the year. Cincinnati Bengals On April 7, 2009, Johnson signed with Cincinnati Bengals, who at the time had a reputation of taking chances on talented players. He played at his natural defensive tackle position in a 4-3 defense. He started 13 games, making 29 tackles and 2 sacks. On March 8, 2010, Johnson was signed by the Bengals to a 4-year deal as an unrestricted free agent. He started the first seven games until suffering a season ending right knee injury against the Miami Dolphins on October 31. He was placed on the injured reserve list on November 23. He started in 7 games, registering 10 tackles (one for loss). On August 16, 2011, his contract was terminated by the Bengals and he was replaced in the starting unit with second-year player Geno Atkins. Legal troubles In November 2005, Johnson was arrested at the Excalibur nightclub in Chicago for possession of a handgun in his sport utility vehicle. Johnson pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor gun charge and was sentenced to 18 months probation and 40 hours of community service. On February 12, 2006, Johnson, while still on probation, was charged with aggravated assault and resisting arrest after allegedly verbally threatening a police officer. Johnson was leaving the Level Nightclub on Chicago's Rush Street when the police officer was ticketing a limousine driver whom Johnson had hired. As Johnson allegedly put up a struggle, he was maced and subdued with the help of other police officers. The charges were eventually dropped. On December 14, 2006, Lake County police officers searched Johnson's home in Gurnee, Illinois, and allegedly discovered that he possessed six firearms, including two assault rifles. According to police reports, some of the guns were loaded and there were children in the house. Although Johnson was at football practice during the search, his bodyguard Willie Bernard Posey was arrested from his house for alleged possession of marijuana. Johnson was charged with violation to probation and possessing unlicensed weapons. Bears coach Lovie Smith deactivated Johnson for the following game against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers based on this incident. On December 16, 2006, Johnson's best friend and bodyguard Willie Bernard Posey was killed in a shooting at the Ice Bar in Chicago's River North neighborhood. Posey was shot after he was allegedly involved in a fight around midnight. Posey was rushed to Northwestern Memorial Hospital, where he was pronounced dead at 1:30 a.m. Posey's assailant was not immediately apprehended. However, on December 28, Chicago Police apprehended Michael Selvie, Posey's alleged assailant. Selvie, a \\"reputed gang member\\" has been implicated in over 30 other crimes. However, Selvie's defense attorney claimed that Selvie does not possess a firearm or any gang affiliations. On February 19, 2010, following a bench trial in the Circuit Court of Cook County, Michael Selvie was convicted of first degree murder. Selvie was later sentenced to 55 years in prison. His case is currently on appeal. On December 22, 2006, Cook County Circuit Judge John J. Moran, Jr. (Skokie courthouse, Second District, Cook County, Illinois) placed Johnson on home confinement, preventing him from driving by himself or leaving the state of Illinois. On December 30, 2006, Tank Johnson contacted Gurnee Police Department to file harassment charges. Local youths left a toilet seat with a harassing message on his doorstep. Local news reported that the police did not disclose what the message on the toilet seat said. On February 8, 2007, Johnson entered a guilty plea in Cook County's Courthouse in Skokie for violating his probation. On February 17, 2007, Johnson's lawyer contested a Lake County Circuit Court to drop Johnson's unlicensed weapons charges. His attorney claimed that since Johnson is a resident of Arizona, he does not have to abide to gun registration laws of Illinois. On March 15, 2007, Johnson was sentenced to a 120 days in Cook County Jail and fined $2,500 for violating his probation. Johnson entered a plea of not guilty on 10 counts of possessing a weapon without the proper state-required ID. On April 30, 2007, Johnson pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor weapons charge as part of an arrangement with prosecutors that kept him from serving additional jail time. He was sentenced to 45 days in jail, which was served concurrently with a four-month sentence he was already serving in the Cook County Jail for violating his probation; to donate $2,500 to the Gurnee Police Department and $2,500 to the Gurnee Exchange Club's child abuse prevention program. While he was in jail, many of his teammates and coaches, including Brian Urlacher, Rex Grossman, and Lovie Smith visited Johnson. His release from jail on May 13, 2007 ended his legal problems from the December 2006 weapons incident. The league ultimately suspended Johnson for half of the regular season on June 4, 2007. On June 22, 2007, Johnson was pulled over for speeding in Gilbert, Arizona. According to the police, he was stopped after driving forty miles per hour in a twenty-five mile per hour zone. He was also suspected of driving while impaired \\"to the slightest degree\\", but was released without being booked or charged. The Bears waived Johnson a few days after hearing the news, as general manager Jerry Angelo stated that he had no room for error left. The incident would prove to be the final straw in his already tense relationship with the Bears' organization. The Bears ultimately released Johnson on June 25, 2007. Almost a week after Johnson was waived, the results from a blood test conducted on Johnson when he was pulled over confirmed his blood alcohol content was under the legal limit. Personal life After retiring from professional football, Johnson attended Mesa Community College in Arizona to complete the requirements for a degree in sociology from the University of Washington. He created a counseling program called 'Moving the Chains', which helps ex- offenders learn from their mistakes and avoid negative influences in their life. Johnson commented on his legal problems, stating, \\"I got in a ton of trouble and I wasn't a bad guy. I had myself in too many uncontrolled environments.\\" See also * National Football League player conduct controversy * Washington Huskies football statistical leaders ReferencesExternal links *University of Washington bio Category:1981 births Category:Living people Category:Sportspeople from Chandler, Arizona Category:Sportspeople from Gary, Indiana Category:American football defensive tackles Category:Washington Huskies football players Category:Chicago Bears players Category:Dallas Cowboys players Category:Cincinnati Bengals players Category:Players of American football from Arizona Category:Players of American football from Indiana Category:American sportspeople convicted of crimes Category:People from Gurnee, Illinois ","title":"Tank Johnson"},{"id":"3551935","text":"Dom Ambrose Griffiths OSB KC*HS (4 December 1928 ‚Äì 14 June 2011) was a Benedictine abbot before becoming a Roman Catholic bishop in the Catholic Church in England and Wales.Griffiths profile in Catholic Hierarchy website Biography Born Michael Griffiths in Twickenham, Middlesex, and educated at Ampleforth College, near York, and at Balliol College, Oxford, he entered the monastery at Ampleforth, taking the religious name of Ambrose, and was ordained to the priesthood on 21 July 1957. In 1976, following the appointment of Abbot Basil Hume as Archbishop of Westminster, Dom Ambrose was elected Abbot of Ampleforth, a post he held until 1984 when he became Parish Priest of Leyland, Preston, Lancashire (Archdiocese of Liverpool), when he received the title of Abbot of Westminster. In 1991 Bishop Hugh Lindsay announced his intention to resign the See of Hexham and Newcastle on the grounds of ill health. His resignation was accepted by Pope John Paul II, who in turn appointed Abbot Ambrose Griffiths as eleventh Bishop of Hexham and Newcastle. He received episcopal consecration in St. Mary's Cathedral, Newcastle upon Tyne, on 20 March 1992, the feast of Saint Cuthbert, co-patron of the diocese. The principal consecrator was Archbishop Derek Worlock of Liverpool, who was assisted by retiring Bishop Bishop Hugh Lindsay and Bishop Owen Swindlehurst, Auxiliary Bishop of Hexham and Newcastle and titular Bishop of Cuncacestre. Auxiliary Bishop Swindlehurst died on 28 August 1995 and was not replaced, leaving Bishop Griffiths to administer the diocese without the assistance of any auxiliary. He implemented a number of changes to the structure of the diocese in order to ease transition to a new model of administration, and these measures included appointing new vicars general to assist the bishop. Throughout his tenure, Bishop Griffiths worked closely with young people, establishing a Youth Mission Team in the diocese and representing young Catholics in the Catholic Bishops' Conference of England and Wales. He served as leader of the Diocese of Hexham and Newcastle for twelve years. When he reached the age limit for bishops of 75 years, prescribed in the Code of Canon Law for the Latin Rite branch of the Catholic Church, he submitted his resignation to John Paul II. His resignation was accepted and he retired on 25 May 2004, the memorial of Saint Bede, the Venerable. On the same day, he presided at the consecration of Kevin Dunn, who succeeded him. After retiring, he moved to St Mary's parish in Leyland, Preston, Lancashire and continued in his work as a member of the Catholic Bishops' Conference of England and Wales. Following a serious illness, due to acute leukaemia, he died, aged, 82, at Saint Mary's, during the afternoon of 14 June 2011. He is buried at Ampleforth Abbey.

His main works are orchestral and chamber compositions, which lean heavily upon elements of Armenian national folklore. Early life It was not until his last years in high school that Manukyan showed interest in composing music. In 1997, he won state scholarship to study languages and psychology at the Yerevan State Linguistic University. During his student years, he committed himself to studying music and immediately began concentrating on composition. He became a member of local chamber orchestras, writing material for their repertoires. He also formed his own jazz quartet and gave concerts at various venues in Yerevan. Career Upon moving to California in 2002, Manukyan shifted his interests towards contemporary classical music after studying the works of his compatriot Aram Khachaturian. A cover-story article in the Glendale News-Press, published on October 23, 2007, shed some light on the composer's unusual start in classical music. In 2004 Manukyan took composition classes from Rowan Taylor and went on to further study with composers John Kennedy, James Newton and earned his master's degree in Music Composition from the California State University, Los Angeles (2007). Since then, the composer has been collaborating with musicians from all continents, engaging them in concerts, lecture-recitals and other events. Manukyan has dedicated many of his compositions to scientists, such as biologists James D. Watson, Francis Crick, physicists Steven Weinberg, Richard Feynman, linguist Noam Chomsky and astronomer Victor Ambartsumian. He created a project called \\"Musical Tribute To Scientists and Other People of Reason\\", which includes lectures on science and philosophy, along with performances of his music. Among the events presented by the project (organized by MIT and Harvard University) was an honorary concert for Noam Chomsky, at Kresge Auditorium, in Cambridge, MA. Manukyan's activism for science is often balanced with his anti-war rhetoric, which could be heard in songs he wrote on words by Chomsky, Bertrand Russell, Andrei Sakharov and others. The scientists celebrated in his concert series are usually known for their activism and struggle for human rights and civil liberties. Style and influences Edward Manukyan's compositional style was mainly influenced by the middle-generation Soviet composers, such as Aram Khachaturian, Dmitry Shostakovich and Sergey Prokofiev, as well as the Armenian successors of their traditions, Alexander Arutiunian, Edvard Mirzoyan, Tigran Mansuryan, etc. Later he drew influences from B√©la Bart√≥k and Igor Stravinsky, striving for a contemporary style that is accessible for larger audiences, in part due to its closeness to Armenian folk music.

He was born in Naples. In 1927, Crocco begun working with solid- propellant rockets and, in 1929, designed and built the first liquid- propellant rocket motors in Italy. He began work with monopropellants (fuel and oxidizer combined in one chemical liquid) in 1932, making him one of the first researchers in this field. As head of the School of Aeronautics of the University of Rome, he performed research on flight mechanics, structural design, and high-altitude flight in addition to his work in rocket propulsion. Because of his early efforts in aeronautics, Italian satellites were launched starting in the 1960s. The San Marco programme was a cooperative effort of NASA and the Italian Space Commission, with NASA providing launch vehicles, use of its facilities, and training of Italian personnel.San Marco (satellites)  Aeronautical space activities  G.A. Crocco is a pioner both in aeronautics and astronautics. In 1898 he was serving in the Italian Army Engineers Corps in the Wireless Dept. when he met Captain Maurizio Moris. Moris, heading a Specialists Brigade, was deeply interested in the new field of aeronautics: he took Crocco in his staff starting a lifelong cooperation. At the time the Specialists Brigade was testing anchored balloons on Lake Bracciano north of Rome. Since 1904 Crocco started experimenting with airships. In 1906, together with Ottavio Ricaldoni he developed Airship 1 featuring a revolutionary semi-rigid flexible structure. On October 31, 1908, piloting an improved version of the airship, the N1, with a rudder and direction indicators, Crocco flew from Vigna di Valle to Rome and back, covering 50 miles in one hour and a half. N1 was the first airship ever to fly over Rome at an attitude of 500 mt (1500 ft). In 1912 Crocco and Rinaldoni tested an hydroplane on the Bracciano lake while experimenting with airships together with other researchers (one of them, Umberto Nobile, would become eventually a famous polar explorer). In the meantime Crocco kept studying propellers‚Äô shapes and sections and in 1914 drew plans for a closed-circuit wind tunnel to be built in Rome. In 1923 Crocco started studying space flight, jet propulsion and rocket fuels. In 1927 the Aeronautic Experimental Institute where Crocco was working, obtained a 200,000 ItL financing (equivalent to today's 1million Euro) to develop black-powder-fuelled rockets to be tested later in a BPD firing range at Segni, east of Rome. He moved onto research on liquid fuels, drawing plans for the first Italian-built combustion chamber, tested in 1930 with the help of his son, Luigi Crocco. The outbreak of WWii and lack of financing confined Crocco to academic activities: he directed the Aeronautic Engineering School from 1935 to 1942 and then again from 1948 to 1952, when Luigi Broglio succeeded him in the post. In those years Crocco wrote hundreds of papers and patented so many inventions that his students used to say in mock poetry \\"Everything I use or see, Oh my Crocco is made by thee.\\" After WW II Crocco went back to his old passions, missiles and astronautics, creating in 1950 an informative course on superior ballistics within the Aeronautic Engineering School. In the inaugural speech he spoke extensively on man-made satellites and rocket trajectories. In 1951 he founded the Italian Rocket Association (AIR) to rally all the fans of the new astronautic science. In 1951, a full decade before the Gagarin space flight, he held a meeting on the problems of a manned spaceship re-entry in the atmosphere. Later on he devised a parallel-stage rocket, a method more rarely applied than tandem stages. Crocco was inducted as a member of the inaugural class to the International Space Hall of Fame. He can be considered as the first to calculate a mission trajectory considering multiple gravity-assists.  The ‚ÄòCrocco Mission‚Äô or ‚ÄòCrocco Grand Tour‚Äô  In 1956 Crocco, more than 80 years old, produced what is considered his most important contribution to world astronautics: in his ‚ÄúOne-Year Exploration-Trip Earth-Mars-Venus-Earth‚Äù paper presented at the Seventh Congress of the International Astronautical Federation IAF, Rome, in 1956, he suggested exploiting the Mars and Venus gravitational fields as propelling forces to cut dramatically the travelling time of a space capsule. This ‚Äògravitational slingshot‚Äô or ‚Äògravity assist‚Äô or ‚Äòswing-by‚Äô method was such that the NASA recommended the study of his theories and especially his swing-by maneuvers contracting firms working on interplanetary flight and its perspectives. Basing his calculations on Hohmann's orbit, the sci-fi writer Arthur C. Clarke had stated once that an Earth to Mars flight with a minimum fuel consumption would require at least 259 days. Then another 425 days should elapse on the Red Planet to re-align the planets so as to travel back again in 259 days. Crocco deemed this period too long and drew his own calculations exploiting Mars gravity pull to fly over the planet without landing. Mars gravity would deflect the spaceship's trajectory towards the Earth cutting the flight's overall length to less than a year, the only objection being the poor quality of data gathered passing over Mars at an altitude of more than a million miles. But, Crocco added, should the spaceship be re-directed towards Venus and not the Earth, it would fly over Mars at a much closer range: observation by the astronauts would be much more satisfactory, and moreover they could observe Venus as well, still keeping the trip's time under a year. He calculated 113 days from Earth to Mars, 154 to reach Venus from Mars and 98 days from Venus back to Earth and affirmed that the first occasion for this ‚ÄòCrocco Grand Tour‚Äô would be occurring in 1971. Such missions have not been attempted but many interplanetary space probes have used similar gravity assist manoeuvres.

During Henry's reign the Use of York was suppressed in favour of the Sarum rite, followed by the Book of Common Prayer. \\"Use\\" denotes the special liturgical customs which prevailed in a particular diocese or group of dioceses; it is one of the medieval English Uses, together with the Use of Sarum. Origin It was a received principle in medieval canon law that while judicial matters, the sacraments, and the more solemn fasts were to adhere to the custom of the Roman Catholic Church, in the matter of church services (divina officia) each particular Church kept to its own traditions (see the Decretum Gratiani, d. 12, c. iv). It should be borne in mind that in the West the entire liturgy, of whatever tradition, was in general celebrated in the Latin language, the doctrine it contained was entirely Catholic, and the overwhelming part of the prayers and practices coincided with those of the Roman Rite. Distinctive features While following the Roman Rite and the Sarum Use in main form, the Use of York had a number of distinctive features. In the celebration of Mass, before the proclamation of the Gospel the priest blessed the deacon with these words (in Latin): \\"May the Lord open thy mouth to read and our ears to understand God's holy Gospel of peace,\\" whereupon the deacon answered: \\"Give, O Lord, a proper and well-sounding speech to my lips that my words may please Thee and may profit all who hear them for Thy name's sake unto eternal life. Amen.\\" Moreover, at the end of the Gospel the priest said quietly (in Latin): \\"Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord.\\" Again, while reproducing in general the features of the Sarum offertory, the York Use required the priest to wash his hands twice: once before touching the altar bread and again after using the incense, while at the latter washing the priest prayed the words of the hymn \\"Veni Creator Spiritus\\". In response to the appeal \\"Orate fratres et sorores\\" (pray brothers and sisters) the choir replied by singing, in a low voice, the first three verses of Psalm 19, \\"Exaudiat te Dominus\\". In another departure from the Sarum custom, the priest in giving the kiss of peace at York said, \\"Habete vinculum\\" (\\"Retain ye the bond of charity and peace that ye may be fit for the sacred mysteries of God\\") instead of \\"Pax tibi et ecclesiae\\" (\\"Peace to thee and the Church\\"). There were also differences in the prayers which immediately preceded the receiving of Holy Communion, and the formulae used in the actual reception of the Sacrament by the priest were again peculiar to York. Further, the number of sequences retained in the York Missal considerably exceeded that of those printed in the Sarum book. A list is given by Mr. Frere in the Jour. Theol. Stud., II, 583. Some metrical compositions, bearing a resemblance to the Carmelite \\"O Flos Carmeli\\", figure among the offertories (see Frere, loc. Cit., 585.). Breviary In the breviary, York employed a larger number of proper hymns than Sarum. There were also a number of minor variations from what was practised both by Sarum and Rome. A careful comparison of the psalms, antiphons, responsories and lessons prescribed respectively by Rome, Sarum, and York for such a festival as that of St. Lawrence reveals a general and often close resemblance; yet, there were many slight divergences. Thus in the first Vespers the psalms used both at York and Sarum were the ferial psalms (as against the Roman usage), but York retained the ferial antiphons while Sarum had proper antiphons. So the capitulum was the same but the responsory following was different. Again the psalms, antiphons, and responsories at Matins were substantially the same, but they do not always occur in the same order. Both at York and Sarum the first six lessons were taken from the legend of the saint of the day, but were differently worded and arranged. The most singular feature, and one common to both Sarum and York on St. Lawrence and one or two other festivals (notably that of the Conversion of St. Paul and the Feast of the Holy Trinity) was the use of antiphons with versicles attached to each. This feature is called in the Aurea Legenda \\"regressio antiphonarum\\" and in Caxton's translation \\"the reprysyng of the anthemys\\". The contents of the manual and the remaining service-books show other distinctive peculiarities; for example the form of troth-plighting in the York marriage-service runs: :Here I take thee N. to my wedded wife, to have and to hold at bed and at board, for fairer for fouler, for better for worse, in sickness and in health, till death us do part and thereto I plight thee my troth. in which may be specially noticed the absence of the words \\"... if the holy Church it will ordain\\" which are found in the Sarum Rite. Again, in the delivery of the ring, the bridegroom at York said: \\"With this ring I wed thee, and with this gold and silver I honour thee, and with this gift I dower thee\\" where again one misses the familiar \\"with my body I thee worship\\", a retention which may still be used in both the Catholic and Protestant marriage services in the United Kingdom. Also the York rubric prescribes: \\"Here let the priest ask the woman's dowry and if land be given her for her dowry then let her fall at the feet of her husband.\\" This feature is entirely lacking in all but one or two of the Sarum books. The only other York peculiarity is the mention of the Blessed Virgin in the form for the administration of extreme unction: :Per istam sanctam unctionem et suam piissimam misericordiam et per intercessionem beatae Mariae Virginis et omnium Sanctorum, indulgeat tibi Dominus quidquid peccastic per visum. Amen. Naturally, York had its own liturgical calendar and special feasts; they are set out at length in Dr. Henderson's edition of the York Missal (pp. 259 sqq and especially p. 271). The Visitation was kept at York on 2 April, a date which seems to agree better with the Gospel narrative than the present Summertime observance. As for the colours of vestments, York is said to have used white for Christmas, Easter, Palm Sunday, and possibly for Whitsuntide, as well as on feasts of the Blessed Virgin, whilst black was used for Good Friday and blue for Advent and Septuagesima (see St. John Hope in \\"Trans. T. Paul's Eccles. Society\\", II, 268, and cf. I, 125).

Biography  Cresti was born in Passignano, currently a frazione of Tavarnelle Val di Pesa about 30 km south of Florence, and was educated by the local Vallombrosan monks. He started his works in the stylized Tuscan manner, working with Giovanni Battista Naldini and Girolamo Macchietti. After travelling from Rome to Venice (1581‚Äì1589), he came under the influence of Tintoretto's style. He had traveled to Venice as an assistant to Federico Zuccari, who had employed him previously in the completion of Vasari's unmemorable frescoes for the Florentine Duomo. He was known to paint with great speed; however, as he used less paint in order to work quickly, most of his works have been severely damaged by time. As a result of this gift, he was nicknamed Passa Ognuno (\\"[He] Passes Everyone\\") ‚Äì a possible play upon the name of his birthplace. In Florence, he painted frescoes of the Translation and Funeral of Saint Antoninus (1589) for the Cappella Salviati in San Marco and Preaching of John the Baptist (1590) for San Michele Visdomini. He painted a Nativity (1594) for Lucca's Duomo di San Martino. Other works can be found in the church of San Frediano in Pisa as fresco, in the Uffizi Gallery, and his Our Lady of the Jacobins (1630), in the Besan√ßon Cathedral. He also painted famous portraits of Galileo and Michelangelo. He also painted frescoes for the Vallumbrosan Badia di Passignano in his hometown.

Since September 2011, it is a part of Chennai Corporation. It is surrounded by Pazhavanthangal in the North, Adambakkam in the North-East, Madippakm in the East,South-East & South and Meenambakkam in the West and North West. It is a residential area close to the Chennai International Airport. In Tamil language, Nangainallur (= Nangai + Nallur) means place of good-natured women. Nanganallur is know for its wide streets and neat roads.  Demographics  India census, Nanganallur has a population of 86,230. The suburb has Hindus, Muslims, Jains and Christian population in various proportion and distributed in various regions. People from outside Tamil Nadu are also represented with a significant number. As a result of Chennai's booming IT business and setting up of IT parks in the suburbs, a lot of people have moved into suburbs like Nanganallur. Towards the end of 2009, it was announced that the Chennai Corporation would be expanded to cover the surrounding 42 local bodies. This was confirmed by the new government in 2011. Nanganallur, has thus become a part of Chennai Corporation from September 2011.

Matriculation Higher Secondary School is also known for the presence of various IIT-JEE coaching institutions. The Indian Coast Guard has its residential enclave for its personnel near Nanganallur.  Infrastructure and connectivity  1st Main Road in Nanganallur,Chennai Nanganallur is connected by suburban trains at nearby railway station Palavanthangal and Meenambakkam and also through MTC city buses. Buses which ply to or through Nanganallur are 52L, 52K, 52P, M18C, M18N, M21G, M154B, M1A, MN45B,M152N. Three or four mini buses are introduced in Nanganallur route. Access from the city is through the main road from the Grand Southern Trunk Road at the Trident Hotel Junction, just north of the airport. Nanganallur has two Subways Palavanthangal and Thillai Ganga Nagar to connect to GST road. But heavy rains could create problems for residents to reach the city. The inner ring road from Thillai Ganga Nagar Subway connects Nanganallur to Velachery and is a major lifeline to the people for commuting to the city during the monsoons. There are two railway stations serving the neighbourhood, namely, the Palavanthangal railway station and the Meenambakkam railway station. Most of them use Palavanthangal railway station to reach Nanganallur. The nearest Chennai Metro railway station is Nanganallur road. The problem of connectivity from Nanganallur to GST and other main parts of the city has been a long-standing one. Lacking frequent bus services, Nanganallur residents have been relying on sub-urban trains plying through Pazhavanthangal station as their only means of quick and reliable transport. The residents' plea to introduce feeder bus services from Pazhavanathangal railway station to Nanganallur has remained unfulfilled, making travel by public transport unreliable. With no direct buses to Velachery (which is a stone's throw away), Nanganallur has become a lone island cut off from all major parts of the city with accessibility restricted to only commuters with private modes of transport.  Temples  There are lot of temples around this area. The main temples are Dharmalingeshwarar Temple, Ardhanareeshwarar Temple, Vembuli Amman temple, Adivyathihara Bhakthanjaneya temple (32-feet Hanuman temple), Raja Rajeshwari temple, Uthira Guruvayurappan temple, Lakshmi Narasimha temple, Karumariamman temple, Ragavendra temple, Lakshmi Hayagrivar temple, Sri Kubera Ganapathi Temple in the Hindu Civil Aviation Colony and Sri Varasithi Vinayagar Temple in Hindu Colony, among others.

Its construction was hugely expensive, chiefly due to the cost of building the Britannia Tubular Bridge over the Menai Strait. The company had relied on Government support in facilitating the ferry service, and this proved to be uncertain. The company opened its main line throughout in 1850. It relied on the co-operation of other railways to reach London and in 1859 it was absorbed by the London and North Western Railway. There were extensive mineral deposits at a number of locations south of the C&HR; main line, and the C&HR; and the LNWR encouraged the building of branch lines to serve them. Llandudno was an early centre of leisure and holiday travel, and in the last decades of the nineteenth century, that traffic became increasingly important. In the twentieth century, the North Wales coast became a popular holiday destination, reached largely by rail travel. In 1970 the Britannia Tubular Bridge suffered a serious fire, and the line was closed at that point until 1972 when a new structure at the same site was brought into use. The container traffic at Holyhead has ceased, and passenger connections to the Irish ferries are much reduced, but the entire original main line is still in use for passenger traffic, together with the Llandudno branch and the Conwy Valley line to Blaenau Ffestiniog. Communication with Dublin The Chester and Holyhead Railway in 1850In 1800 Acts of the United Kingdom and Irish Parliaments determined the Union of the two countries; this took effect on 1 January 1801. Prior to that time, the countries had been in personal union, having a shared sovereign but independent governments. There had long been a necessity for convenient communication between London and Dublin, and the Union gave further emphasis to the need, specifically for Government mails. The sea crossing of the Irish Sea was difficult because of the poor harbour facilities on both sides, and the road approach to the United Kingdom harbour at Holyhead was long and difficult. In 1815 Thomas Telford was commissioned to build an improved road between London and Holyhead, and also between Lancashire and Holyhead. The A5 road as it existed in the 1950s shares much of the heritage of Telford's London to Holyhead route. Telford's road was completed from Shrewsbury to Bangor in 1819, and across Anglesey in 1828, including the Stanley Embankment from Anglesey to Holy Island.Peter E Baughan, The Chester and Holyhead Railway, volume 1, David & Charles, Newton Abbot, 1972, , pages 69 and 70Peter E Baughan, A Regional History of the Railways of Great Britain: volume 11: North and Mid Wales, David St John Thomas, 1991, Nairn, , pages 19 and 20W J Sivewright (editor), Civil Engineering Heritage: Wales and Western England, Thomas Telford Publishing, London, 1986, Pages 9 to 13 The London route avoided Conway, crossing the River Conwy at Betws-y-Coed, but the Lancashire route required to cross the river, and both routes needed to cross the Menai Strait. Telford built bridges for these crossings. The Conwy Bridge and the Menai Bridge were both completed in 1826. As part of the same project, Holyhead Harbour was substantially improved in 1821, and subsequently extended and further improved in 1831 and 1847. Although other routes to Ireland were used, (Liverpool in particular), Holyhead was now the obvious, and easiest, port of access. On the Irish side, Howth Harbour, north of Dublin had been used, but increasingly the small harbour at D√∫n Laoghaire south of the city was used; it had been renamed Kingstown in 1821 in honour of a visit by King George IV.Its name reverted to D√∫n Laoghaire in 1921. The stagecoach transit from London to Holyhead had been 45 hours, and was now cut to 36 hours, and by 1832 to 28 hours. However, in 1838 there was through railway connection from London to Liverpool (over the London and Birmingham Railway, the Grand Junction Railway, and the Liverpool and Manchester Railway) transforming the land journey time on the British side. The Post Office, and the Admiralty, responsible at that time for operating the packet boats, transferred the main part of the traffic to Liverpool.E H W Gardner, The Chester & Holyhead Railway, Railway Magazine, September and October 1938 Route to the port A number of railway schemes were proposed to reach a harbour, many of them with major practical disadvantages. Late in 1836 a Commission was appointed to determine the best route, and Charles Blacker Vignoles became the Engineer to the Commission. The preliminary findings of the Commission were ambiguous and did not result in a clear proposal for a railway. Domestic railways progressed, however, and in September and October 1840 the Chester and Birkenhead Railway and the Chester and Crewe Railway respectively opened. They connected to the Grand Junction Railway, and a railway network was taking shape. A number of schemes to reach a North Wales port were put forward; the Menai would be crossed using Telford's Menai (road) bridge, hauling coaches and wagons across by ropes. When there was talk of a second, railway, bridge, the poor state of the money market frightened off promoters. Authorisation In January 1840 the Commissioners were still considering the matter, and were given strong advice that Holyhead was the only suitable North Wales harbour, and that a line there from Chester was the best option. Nonetheless, the matter was still not settled, and railway use of Menai road bridge was still in the thinking. The prevarication, and suggestions of other routes, continued but in the 1844 session of Parliament a Chester and Holyhead Railway was proposed. On 4 July 1844 it obtained the Royal Assent. The line was to be 85 miles long; authorised capital was ¬£2.1 million.Baughan, pages 23 to 46Donald J Grant, Directory of the Railway Companies of Great Britain, Matador Publishers, Kibworth Beauchamp, 2017, , page 111Ernest F Carter, An Historical Geography of the Railways of the British Isles, Cassell, London, 1959, page 83 The approval excluded the crossing of the Menai; Robert Stephenson, as engineer, had asked for it to be excluded for further consideration to be given, while allowing the main sections to be started. The London and Birmingham Railway was permitted to subscribe ¬£1 million of the authorised capital. After some hesitation, the L&BR; took up the subscription, apparently motivated by the nascent South Wales Railway, which it feared might be a competitor. A significant financial issue was the Government mail contract, and unsavoury horse trading took place with senior Government representatives. Just before passage of the authorising Bill, the directors approved in principle a proposal to operate the railway by atmospheric traction. Robert Stephenson investigated and advised against it, and the idea was dropped.Baughan, pages 46 to 52 Construction and opening Work started on 1 May 1845. The North Wales Mineral Railway had obtained Parliamentary authority to build a line from a junction with the C&HR; line at Saltney, near Chester, to Ruabon. By late 1846 the NWMR line was ready; the company had amalgamated with the Shrewsbury, Oswestry and Chester Railway to form the Shrewsbury and Chester Railway. Relying on the C&HR; for final access to Chester, it requested that company to make the short section into Chester available, and on 4 November 1846 S&CR; operation started. The Chester station was to be joint with the Shrewsbury and Chester Railway and the other railways: the Chester and Birkenhead Railway (opened 30 September 1841), the Chester and Crewe Railway (opened 1 October 1840 and already absorbed into the Grand Junction Railway).H H Meik, The Chester and Holyhead Railway, in the Railway Magazine, July and August 1919 The station design was modified to be a joint station to accommodate all the traffic. Authorisation of construction of the station was by a Shrewsbury and Chester Railway Act, of 9 July 1847. The station was opened, although not quite finished, on 1 August 1848. The works on the line were always expected to be difficult, and progress was slow. In 1848 it was decided to open from Chester to Bangor. Captain Wynne of the Board of Trade visited for the required inspection for passenger opening, on 19 and 20 April 1848. He inspected the line as far as the Conway, his colleague Captain J L A Simmons inspected the line westward from there. The inspectors were informed that the line would be worked by the London and North Western Railway. (By Act of 16 July 1846 the London and Birmingham Railway, the Grand Junction Railway and the Manchester and Birmingham Railway merged to form the London and North Western Railway.)Baughan, pages 53 to 88Baughan, Regional History, pages 22 to 24 The Menai Bridge The Britannia Bridge (George Childs)In the 1845 session of Parliament the Company deposited plans for the crossing of the Menai. The geographical route was now clear enough, but the concept of the bridge design was not. Such a large span lent itself to the idea of a suspension bridge, and Stephenson considered whether the deck of such a structure could be stiffened so as to carry the concentrated loads of a railway train, but decided against it.John F Unsworth, Design of Modern Steel Bridges, Taylor and Francis Group, Boca Baton, Florida, 2010, , page 10 Any arched design was objected to by the supposed restriction on navigation it might impose. Stephenson was beginning to think of a bridge structure in the form of a straight tube; the unusual depth of the beam would give sufficient bending strength. John Laird, a shipbuilder and C&HR; board member told Stephenson of the case of the launch of a steamship, the Prince of Wales. The launch went astray, and the ship ended up supported on ground at bow and stern, over a length of 180 feet, acting as a beam without distress. In the Parliamentary process, Stephenson was naturally challenged as to the feasibility of his tubular bridge, but succeeded in convincing sceptical members, and the Chester & Holyhead Railway Completion Act received the Royal Assent on 30 June 1845.Baughan, pages 93 to 97 After some experimentation, rectangular tubes (as opposed to circular or elliptical) were decided on, and a one-sixth scale model was tested to destruction. This gave Stephenson confidence in the concept, and auxiliary support chains earlier thought necessary were dispensed with. The erection would be performed by hydraulic jacks.Baughan, pages 98 to 103Sivewright, pages 11 and 12 Dee bridge failure A bridge over the River Dee near Chester was already in use. As it was in the section of route used by the Shrewsbury and Chester Railway, trains had been using it since November 1846. It used cast iron beams supported by wrought iron ties in a composite structure. The weakness of cast iron in tension was well understood, and the ties were present to overcome that difficulty. The main beams were formed of three units bolted together end-to- end, and trussed by the wrought iron ties. The track was supported by oak decking timbers laid on the bottom flange of the main beams. On 24 May 1847 one of the spans failed as a passenger train was crossing at . Six persons were killed. The engine successfully crossed the bridge, but the progressive failure led to the bridge collapsing under the tender and following coaches. The probable cause is nowadays considered to be fatigue tension fracture of the beams, provoked by asymmetric loading by the deck timbers, a stress- raising feature in the profile of the beams, and relaxation of the tie bars, transferring nearly all the load to the cast beams alone. A painter had been working on a girder which cracked before the accident, and he actually measured a very large deflection of five and a half inches at the centre of the span when a train was passing.Peter R Lewis and Colin Gagg, Aesthetics versus Function: the Fall of the Dee bridge, 1847, Interdisciplinary Science Reviews, 2004, Vol 29, No. 2, 2004Baughan, pages 104 to 112 Conway bridge While the Parliamentary attention had been on the Menai crossing, the Conwy bridge (at the time spelt Conway) was to be erected first. Stephenson took up temporary residence at the site from 12 February 1848. On 6 March the tubes were floated into position ready for raising. By 18 April Stephenson was able to drive a demonstration train over the bridge. Public traffic over the bridge started on 1 May 1848.Baughan, pages 112 to 119, and 296Sivewright, page 13 Opening on Anglesey The line from Llanfair to Holyhead was opened to public traffic on 1 August 1848.Baughan, page 120 As the Menai crossing was not yet ready, passengers and goods were conveyed across by coach and carts respectively.Baughan, page 246 The Holyhead station was more than a mile from the pier, and the line was extended to reach it much later, in 1851. Financial difficulties At this period the Company found itself considerably overstretched financially, at a time when the money market was unfavourable to the raising of additional funds. The problem was severe, but was overcome when the London and North Western Railway agreed to take preference shares and contractors were paid in company debentures.Baughan, page 121Baughan, Regional History, pages 24 and 25 Britannia bridge and opening of the line The Menai bridge was to have two main spans each with twin tubes (for double track), and the tubes were to be 406 feet in length. The central pier was to be 221 feet high. Work started at the site in July 1847 and by November 1848 fabrication of the main tubes was substantially completed. From 19 June 1849 the tubes for one line of track were floated into position and raised by jacks; the process was completed for the four main tubes by 7 January 1850. On 5 March 1850 Stephenson drove a test train through the completed single-track span of the bridge, and on 18 March 1850 public passenger trains started running. The Chester and Holyhead main line was connected throughout. At a half-yearly shareholders' meeting in March 1850 it was stated that the bridge had cost ¬£674,000, three times Stephenson's estimate.Baughan, pages 128 to 139 From April 1850 work was started on the structure for the second track. The final lift of the last main tube took place on 16 August 1850. On 19 October 1850 trains started using the second track in the bridge, and the full public operation started on 21 August. Operating, the mail contract and steamers The Directors had always assumed that they would be awarded the mail contract on the opening of the line, and that this would include operating the mail packet boat service. Towards the end of 1846, the Company tried to start negotiation with the Government and were curtly rebuffed. Moreover, the City of Dublin Steam Packet Company and other private operators objected to the powers to run steamships sought by the company in the 1847 Parliamentary session. The situation was exceedingly paradoxical, because the Government was financing improvements to the Holyhead harbour, and to the Company's steamers were using it, but the Company were forbidden from operating them. This seemed to be put right in the 1848 session, when an Act of 22 July 1848 authorised the use of steamboats, and also the increased capital to the extent of ¬£250,000. The Company had originally intended to operate its trains itself, but on reflection a working arrangement with the LNWR seemed better, and agreement on this was reached in August 1847.Baughan, page 148 The Government once again dealt harshly with the Company over the mail contract, requiring them to take over the Admiralty steamers (even though they knew the Company had ordered their own). A sequence of threatened withdrawals of co-operation followed; at the same time the C&HR;'s financial position deteriorated steeply, and the Board seemed to be at loggerheads. In August 1849 the Company were promised ¬£100,000 by the LNWR, which was desperately needed, but the LNWR realised they had no powers to make such a loan.Baughan, pages 149 to 154 1850 timetable Bradshaw's Guide for March 1850 shows a brisk passenger service on the line: passengers could leave Kingstown at 19:30 Dublin time (25 minutes earlier than GMT)Historic Time Zones at Time and Date website, https://www.timeanddate.com/time/zone/ireland/Dublin and Holyhead at 01:35 by mail train; the time between Llanfair and Bangor was 35 minutes, although the traveller was not informed that this was by road vehicle; the onward journey arrived at Chester at 04:40 and arrival in London was at 13:00. Three other services traversed the whole line, one on Sundays, and two to London and two only on the line respectively on Sundays.Bradshaw's Railway Times for Great Britain and Ireland: March 1850, reprint, Middleton Press, Midhurst, 2012, Financial problems Bangor station, Gwynedd in the 1950sAt length the LNWR offered an advance of ¬£250,000 to finish the works and lease the railway. The arrangement was to last seven years, and the LNWR guaranteed 4% on the debentures. However the lease needed Parliamentary authorisation, and the GWR made it clear it would demand running powers, which frightened the LNWR off. Now Samuel Peto joined the board and personally funded debenture payments that the C&HR; Was otherwise unable to meet. He was elected Chairman on 12 February 1851. Peto's impeccable record resulted in renewed confidence in the money markets, and preference shares were suddenly oversubscribed. Nevertheless, it was only in the half-year ending 31 December 1854 that the company made a net profit, and this allowed a small dividend on the first preference shares only. The financial position of the company was one of continuing indebtedness, in fact dependency on the LNWR, and the LNWR decided that the time had come to bring the matter to a head. The C&HR; would be worked as part of the LNWR system, paying the C&HR; shareholders 1% above its own working expenses rate after an initial period. The arrangement was to start on 1 July 1856. Full acquisition of the C&HR; was now inevitable, but the C&HR; needed to negotiate renewal of the steamer service and the mail contract. The contract would have onerous obligations and heavy penalties at a time when actual operation was dependent on the goodwill of the LNWR, and the C&HR; forbore to complete the agreement. The Chester and Holyhead Railway Act of 23 July 1858 allowed the financial support of the C&HR; by the LNWR and enabled contractual arrangements, but did not require them. Activation of these clauses would allow running powers for competing companies, and the LNWR declined to enter into that, leaving the C&HR; still in suspense. The C&HR; decided to apply for powers to merge with any other company whatever, and this finally forced the LNWR's hand into full amalgamation. This took effect on 1 January 1859. (The C&HR; Company remained in existence until it was dissolved by the LNWR (Additional Powers) Act of 21 July 1879.)Baughan, pages 155 to 179 Mold branch In the first half of the nineteenth century, Mold was an important commercial centre, with considerable mineral deposits. Businesspeople there sought a railway connection, and the Mold Railway was incorporated on 9 July 1847. It was to run from a junction near Saltney to Mold, with a branch line to Ffrith. The main line of the Mold Railway opened on 14 August 1849; it was worked by the LNWR. In 1852 responsibility was transferred to the C&HR; and the LNWR.Baughan, Regional History, pages 50 and 51 Holyhead extension The line was extended to the Admiralty Pier at Holyhead on 20 May 1851, and a new general station was opened on 14 September 1851. Caernarvon branch The Bangor and Carnarvon Railway was incorporated on 20 May 1851. The line was leased to the Chester and Holyhead Railway from the time of opening, the C&HR; in turn being worked by the LNWR. Freight and passenger traffic between Bangor and Port Dinorwic commenced on 1 March and 10 March 1852 respectively.Baughan, Regional History, pages 93 and 94Bill Rear, From Chester to Holyhead: the Branch Lines, Oxford Publishing Company, Hersham, 2003, , pages 137 to 139 Llandudno branch On 20 August 1853 a branch to Llandudno was authorised by Parliament. At one time Llandudno, or rather Ormes Bay, had been considered as the departure harbour for Dublin, but as stated Holyhead had overtaken that. Tourism would, it was thought, support the branch. Originally it was intended to join the main line at Conway, facing Holyhead, but it was realised that the available space there prevented that, and the point of junction was placed east of the Conwy river, at what became Llandudno Junction. The branch opened on 1 October 1858. It was worked by the LNWR, and leased to that company in 1862, and vested in the LNWR by Act of 28 July 1873.Baughan, Regional History, pages 27 to 29Rear, the Branch Lines, pages 117 and 118 Denbigh branch The Vale of Clwyd Railway was authorised by Parliament on 23 June 1856. It was to run from a junction with the C&HR; at Foryd Junction, not far from Rhyl, to Denbigh. It opened, using a temporary station at Denbigh on 22 September 1858. For the time being the C&HR;, shortly to be taken over by the LNWR, allowed access to their Rhyl station. The LNWR took over the working of the line by an Act of 1863, and the company was amalgamated with the LNWR by Act of 15 July 1867.Baughan, Regional Railways, pages 64 to 67, 72, 74 and 75Rear, the Branch Lines, pages 53 and 54 Later branches The Chester and Holyhead Railway and connecting lines in 1922After the absorption of the Chester and Holyhead Railway by the LNWR in 1859, more branches connecting the line were built: Conway Valley In the mid-nineteenth-century Llanrwst was an important market town, and a branch to it from the main line had been contemplated for some time. The LNWR promoted the Conway and Llanrwst Railway was authorised on 23 July 1860 and opened to the public on 17 June 1863. In 1868, with the growth of tourism, the line was extended to Betws-y-Coed At this time the slate industry was expanding massively above Betws-y-Coed, at Blaenau Ffestiniog. Although other railway connections existed there, the LNWR decided to extend the branch to reach it. The result was the Bettws Extension Railway; this involved a long tunnel bored through hard rock at considerable expense; it opened in 1879.Baughan, Regional History, pages 129 and 130Rear, the Branch Lines, pages 83 and 84 Amlwch branch After some false starts, a branch railway into Anglesey was authorised: the Anglesey Central Railway was authorised on 13 July 1863. They had approached the LNWR to work their line, but had been rebuffed. A passenger service started from Gaerwen to Llangefni on 12 March 1865, worked by the LNWR, who had relented. The line was extended to Llannerch-y-medd on 1 February 1866, and throughout to Amlwch on 3 June 1867. The final section may have been opened to goods traffic earlier, on 10 September 1866. The line was acquired by the LNWR in 1876.Baughan, Regional History, pages 83 and 84Rear, the Branch Lines, pages 205 and 206 Dyserth branch There were lead and iron ore deposits at Dyserth, a few miles south of the C&HR; main line. The LNWR obtained Parliamentary powers to build from Prestatyn to Dyserth by Act of 16 July 1866. The line was known as the Prestatyn and Cwm Line, and was opened for goods traffic on 1 September 1869. Dyserth Castle and Cwm Waterfalls were considered to be tourist attractions, and a steam railmotor service operated passenger services from 28 August 1905.Baughan, Regional History, pages 79 and 80 Holywell branch A localised combination of high quality minerals near Holywell had led to an intensive local industry, and on 29 July 1864 the Holywell Railway was authorised to make a short branch, upgrading an earlier Holywell Limestone Company tramway, which crossed the C&HR; main line on the level. The new line would make a bridge crossing, and have gradients of 1 in 27. It opened for mineral traffic in June 1867, but became disused and derelict some time in the following decade. The LNWR purchased it in 1891, but for the time being did nothing with it. In an inversion of the motivation elsewhere, the growth of passenger omnibus traffic encouraged the LNWR to reopen the line to passenger traffic. LNWR Acts of 1906 and 1907 authorised this, and on 1 July 1912, the resurgent line opened, with a new curve connecting to the main line. The short line was a considerable success, but after World War II decline intervened and it closed on 6 September 1954, except for a stub to Crescent Siding textile mills, which finally closed on 11 August 1957.Baughan, Regional History, pages 80 and 81Rear, pages 41, 43 and 44 Wrexham, Mold and Connah's Quay Railway The Buckley Railway ‚Äì in fact a tramway ‚Äì had conveyed mineral products to a wharf at Connah's quay on the River Dee, since 1862.J I C Boyd, The Wrexham, Mold and Connah's Quay Railway, Oakwood Press, Headington, 1991, , page 70 It was superseded by the Wrexham, Mold and Connah's Quay Railway, which upgraded the line to a locomotive railway, opening in 1866. The WM&CQR; ran to the Buckley Railway wharf at Connah's Quay, but also made a connection with the C&HR; main line near there, and this proved more useful, for interchange traffic, than was expected.Boyd, page 115Baughan, Regional History, page 55 The WM&CQR; never transferred into LNWR ownership; it suffered terribly from lack of money, and it was the Great Central Railway that acquired it, rescuing it from bankruptcy. The acquisition took effect on 1 January 1905.Boyd, page 231 Bethesda branch There were important and extensive slate quarries in the Penrhyn Estate south of Bethesda, near Bangor. About 1800 a narrow gauge tramway was constructed to convey the mineral to a harbour near Bangor, called Port Penrhyn. The tramway was later, about 1877, upgraded and improved, and renamed the Penrhyn Railway. The slate traffic increased, and the LNWR proposed a branch line to the quarry. The line opened on 1884 to passenger trains and 1885 to mineral trains. Gradients were steep, at 1 in 40. Road competition led to closure of the passenger service in 1951, and the mineral traffic ceased in 1963.Rear, page 129 Llandudno Junction alterations Llandudno Junction in the 1950sBy the late nineteenth century the original junction layout at Llandudno Junction was becoming impossibly cramped. The station was enlarged, and the junction of the Conway Valley line with the main line was moved east to accommodate that. The new arrangement was commissioned on 1 October 1897.Vic Middleton and Keith Smith, Bala to Llandudno, Middleton Press, Midhurst, 2010, , caption to map XXXI Traffic When the line was built, the dominant business was expected to be the Irish mail. Gardner, writing in 1938, said: > Nevertheless the traffic on the... line has grown to enormous proportions, > but for reasons very different from those foreseen in 1848. The growth of > the seaside holiday resorts of Rhyl, Colwyn Bay, and of Llandudno, and later > of many smaller places, stretching from Prestatyn in Flintshire to Portmadoc > on Cardigan Bay, has made the old Chester & Holyhead one of the busiest > holiday lines in Britain. The 1938 Bradshaw shows an extraordinary number of trains on the line: on summer Saturdays 78 long distance trains passed Chester (not all making a call there) on to the line, together with 24 local or stopping trains. Most of the long diatnce trains came from the north Midlands, Lancashire and Yorkshire.Bradshaws July 1938 Railway Guide, David & Charles Reprints, Newton Abbot, 1969, Gardner made the observation that \\"Holyhead... has not developed as a [general] port, and its activities are now confined to the traffic to and from Ireland. Even this has declined during the present century...\\" Britannia bridge fire On the night of 23 May 1970, a fire took hold in the Britannia Bridge. The fire was very severe, and so intense that the main tubes buckled and were unusable. The line had to be closed at that point. A new bridge superstructure was designed, capable of carrying rail and road traffic on separate levels; it was a braced arch structure, using the original foundations. The crossing was reopened to rail traffic on 30 January 1972, and to road traffic in 1980.Network Rail, The History of the Britannia Bridge, North Wales, at https://www.networkrail.co.uk/who-we-are/our-history/iconic- infrastructure/the-history-of-the-britannia-bridge/Baughan, Regional History, pages 32and 33 Britannia Bridge after reconstructionThe branch line to Caernarfon had been closed on 4 August 1969, but during the rail closure of the Britannia bridge, part of the former branch was reopened from 15 June 1970, to enable Irish container traffic to be loaded and unloaded from rail while Holyhead was inaccessible. The reopened section was once again closed on 5 February 1972 when the rail connection to Holyhead was restored.Baughan, Regional History, page 105 Branch line decline Many of the branch lines of the Holyhead main line were dependent on Victorian and Edwardian tourism, minerals or agriculture, and as these became better served by road transport, so the branches lost custom. Against the trend, Llandudno continues as a popular tourist centre, and the branch line to Blaenau Ffestiniog has been retained as a passenger route, although the slate extraction business is nowadays insignificant. The WM&CQR; connection too has long been removed (in 1954). The Amlwch branch closed to passengers in 1964, and completely in 1993. The Caernarfon line was closed to passengers in 1970, and completely after the temporary reopening, in 1972. The Bethesda line closed to passengers in 1951, but goods traffic continued until 1963. The Rhyl to Denbigh line lost its passenger service in 1955, and closed in 1961, and the Dyserth line closed to passengers in 1930, and completely in 1973. The Holywell line lost its passenger trains in 1954. The present day The former Chester and Holyhead main line continues as an important secondary main line. The connection with Irish ferry services at Holyhead has been retained, but has lost much of its former significance, but ordinary intercity and local passenger traffic is buoyant. There are (summer 2019) forty daily passenger trains each way on some or all of the main line.National Rail Public Timetable, table 81 There is no reference to rail freight on the Holyhead Port Authority website;Holyhead Port Authority at https://holyheadport.co.uk/faq/at-the-port the Freightliner terminal ceased operation in 1991.

SG-1 (having obtained the mothership in Double Jeopardy) transports down, much to Tanith's surprise. Col. O'Neill and Teal'c meet with the council to discuss the imminent relocation of the Tok'ra. When Tanith asks why he was not informed of this, they reveal to Tanith that they knew all along about him being a traitor, and have used him to funnel misinformation to Apophis. He is then imprisoned and Teal'c visits him. He informs him about what will happen to him and they also talk about Shan'auc. On the ship the Tok'ra prepare to evacuate while Jacob talks with Jack about the ship and the Goa'uld. In his cell Tanith talks with a guard and then breaks down. When the guards enter the cell he kills them and flees. He returns to the surface and uses a Goa'uld long range communication device to contact Apophis. Teal'c then searches for him together with the Tok'ra. Meanwhile, Jack and Daniel are informed by Major Carter and Jacob that Apophis is coming and that they plan to destroy his fleet by blowing up the sun of the solar system. This will be done by launching the Stargate into the sun while it is connected to P3W-451 ‚Äì a planet where they previously found a black hole (See \\"A Matter of Time\\"). The gate will suck in enough mass from the star to cause it to supernova. Jack agrees to the plan. Later Daniel talks with Teal'c about his revenge on Tanith. After the Tok'ra are all evacuated, SG-1 and Jacob fly to the sun where they are able to dial P3W-451. They then launch the stargate into the sun and plan to flee. Suddenly an Al'kesh, a Goa'uld mid-range bomber, de-cloaks and attacks. Although Teal'c fires back he can only make one hit. Finally the Al'kesh is able to damage the ship, so that they can't enter hyperspace. Jack and Teal'c then board a Death glider to fly to the Al'kesh but before they can shoot it returns to the planet. Teal'c follows it, despite Jack's worries. On the Ha'tak, Jacob and Sam start to repair their systems. At the planet Teal'c and Jack are able to destroy the Al'kesh (much to Tanith's shock, who was waiting for it on the planet) but they are caught in the explosion. Jack can only send an emergency call to the Ha'tak, where Jacob and Sam are partly successful with their repairs. Back on the planet Jack and Teal'c are unharmed when the glider crash lands, and go to the Tok'ra base. However, Apophis' fleet appears, and Apophis sends two Jaffa to Tanith. Back on the ship the repairs are complete and they hide from Apophis. On the planet, Teal'c is shot with a staff weapon and captured by Tanith, who brings him to Apophis. Jack is stunned by Tanith's Zat, but is able to wound him in return. Teal'c mocks Apophis, telling him that the Tok'ra escaped. Jacob launches all the Hatak's gliders, which are programmed to flee the system. Apophis follows them but soon realizes that it was a trick. In the meantime Jack is rescued from the planet by his team mates. Finally, the sun explodes and SG-1 escapes, while Apophis' fleet is destroyed. SG-1's flight through hyperspace is interrupted and when they arrive, they realize that they have crossed four million light years. Apophis' mothership appears, trapped with them far from home.

Traditional beat 'em ups take place in scrolling, two-dimensional (2D) levels, though some later games feature more open three-dimensional (3D) environments with yet larger numbers of enemies. These games are noted for their simple gameplay, a source of both critical acclaim and derision. Two- player cooperative gameplay and multiple player characters are also hallmarks of the genre. Most of these games take place in urban settings and feature crime-fighting and revenge-based plots, though some games may employ historical, science fiction or fantasy themes. The first beat 'em up was 1984's Kung-Fu Master, with 1986's Renegade introducing the urban settings and underworld revenge themes employed extensively by later games. The genre then saw a period of high popularity between the release of Double Dragon in 1987, which defined the two-player cooperative mode central to classic beat 'em ups, and led to 1991's Street Fighter II, which drew gamers towards one-on-one fighting games. Games such as Streets of Rage, Final Fight, Golden Axe and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles are other classics to emerge from this period. The genre has been less popular since the emergence of 3D-based mass-market games, but still some beat 'em ups adapted the simple formula to utilize large-scale 3D environments. In recent years, the genre has seen a resurgence in Asia, with the success of South Korean online beat 'em up Dungeon Fighter Online (2004).

Such terminology is loosely applied, however, as some commentators prefer to conflate the two terms. At times, both one-on-one fighting games and scrolling beat 'em ups have influenced each other in terms of graphics and style and can appeal to fans of either genre. Occasionally, a game will feature both kinds of gameplay.Wales, Matt, Super Smash Bros. Brawl UK Review , IGN, June 8, 2008. Retrieved March 24, 2009. In the United Kingdom, gaming magazines of the early 1990s such as Mean Machines and Computer & Video Games (C+VG) referred to all games which had a combat motif as beat 'em ups, even fighting games. However, they were differentiated by a specific prefix; games like Double Dragon or Final Fight were called \\"scrolling beat 'em ups\\" and games such as Street Fighter II or Mortal Kombat were referred to as \\"one on one beat 'em ups\\".  Game design  Beat 'em up games usually employ vigilante crime fighting and revenge plots with the action taking place on city streets, though historical and fantasy themed games also exist. Players must walk from one end of the game world to the other, and thus each game level will usually scroll horizontally. Some later beat 'em ups dispense with 2D-based scrolling levels, instead allowing the player to roam around larger 3D environments, though they retain the same simple gameplay and control systems. Throughout the level, players may acquire weapons that they can use as well as power-ups that replenish the player's health. As players walk through the level, they are stopped by groups of enemies who must be defeated before they're able to continue.Nguyen, Thierry, Watchmen: The End is Nigh (PS3) , 1UP, Mar 4, 2009, Mar 26, 2009 The level ends when all the enemies are defeated.

Later that year, Karateka combined the one-on-one fight sequences of Karate Champ with the freedom of movement in Kung-Fu Master, and it successfully experimented with adding plot to its fighting action. It was also among the first beat 'em ups to be successfully ported to home systems. Nekketsu K≈çha Kunio-kun, released in 1986 in Japan, deviated from the martial arts themes of earlier games and introduced street brawling to the genre.

The lawsuit was dismissed by the United States District Court for the District of Columbia on the grounds that the textbooks disseminated science, not religion.

The Coptic language is used primarily by Egyptian Copts and it is the liturgical language of Coptic Christianity.  Official language  Arabic is the official language of Egypt.  Main spoken language  Egyptian Arabic is the commonly spoken language, based on the dialect of Cairo, and is occasionally written in Arabic script, or in Arabic chat alphabet mostly on new communication services. Of the many varieties of Arabic, Egyptian Arabic is the most widely understood first dialect in the Middle East-North Africa, probably due to the influence of Egyptian cinema and music industry throughout the Arabic-speaking world.  Minority languages  In southern Egypt, Saidi Arabic is the main spoken language for most people. In the Upper Nile Valley, around Kom Ombo and Aswan, there are about 300,000 speakers of Nubian languages, mainly Nobiin, but also Kenuzi-Dongola. A Bedouin Sinai minority speaks a variety of Bedouin Arabic mostly in the Sinai Peninsula in Egypt's Asian lands.

Siwi Berber is well mutually intelligible with Libyan Berber dialects [source?]. In ancient times, the population of western Egypt was probably made of Berber-speaking tribes[source?]. Immigrants and their descendants mainly spoke Italian until the second half of the 19th century, or also more recently African languages like Amharic and Tigrigna.  Sign languages  The only known sign language used in Egypt is Egyptian Sign Language. It is known to be used in Alexandria and Cairo, and possibly other regions. Regional variation is reported anecdotally but not documented.  Foreign languages = English  Most educated people in Egypt study English at school. There are also many English language universities in Egypt, the BUE (British University in Egypt), the FUE (Future University in Egypt), Nile University, the AUC (American University in Cairo) and more. English is the most widely used language in tourism. Nowadays, the majority of the road signs in Egypt are written both in Arabic and English.

The card arrived on the market in 1994. It is a full-length ISA digital audio and sample-based synthesis device, equipped with a 2 MiB Ensoniq-built ROM-based patch set. Some OEM versions of the card feature a smaller 1 MiB patch set. It was praised for its then-high quality music synthesis and sound output, high compatibility and good software support. Hardware overview Soundscape S-2000 Rev. 1 Ensoniq advertisements for the Soundscape stated \\"Finally, A Sound Card from a company that knows sound!\\", claiming that \\"the same wavetable technology that drives our $3,000 keyboards is available for your PC\\". The card uses an 'OTTO' synthesizer chip with a companion 'Sequoia' chip for MIDI duties, along with a Motorola 68EC000 8 MHz controller (a low-cost variant of the ubiquitous 68000 with selectable bus widthhttp://pdf.datasheetcatalog.com/datasheet/motorola/M68000AD.pdf) and a small amount of RAM. Although it has RAM, the card does not support uploading of sound samples for the synthesizer. The on-board coprocessor was a much-advertised feature of the card, marketed to reduce the overhead of music synthesis through the device. Digital-to-analog audio conversion was handled by an Analog Devices CODEC such as the AD1848, which was capable of sampling at up to 48 kHz.\\"http://pdf1.alldatasheet.com/datasheet- pdf/view/47932/AD/AD1848KP.html\\" The Soundscape S-2000's sample-based synthesizer lacked an effects processor, meaning digital effects such as reverb and chorus were not supported. Advertisements also mentioned the card's three CD-ROM interface connectors. As was common with multimedia cards produced in the mid-90s, a variety of proprietary interfaces were supported. This was necessary as ATAPI IDE CD-ROM drives were not yet common, and the majority of optical drives produced required one of the many proprietary interfaces that were prevalent at the time. In addition, the majority of PCs purchased typically had only a single IDE channel, which might already be controlling two hard drives or a hard drive and a tape/disc backup device, so offering additional CD-ROM interfaces was often convenient to the consumer. One advantage compared to competitors was that the card did not require TSRs, minimizing its conventional memory footprint. The card loaded its own operating system into the onboard RAM during system initialization via the card's 'SSINIT.EXE' utility program. The Soundscape also has a hardware MPU-401 implementation which, combined with the lack of TSRs, allowed a high degree of compatibility, which was a significant benefit as many DOS games often ran in a custom flavor of protected mode or were particularly demanding of conventional memory space. Soundscape S-2000 has several descendants, including the SoundscapeDB, Soundscape Elite, Soundscape OPUS, Soundscape VIVO90, and AudioPCI. The original Soundscape S-2000 was replaced by the Soundscape II, a board based on the ELITE but without the daughtercard (it was an upgrade option). Compatibility The Soundscape was compatible with a variety of popular sound standards such as Ad Lib, Creative Sound Blaster 2.0, Microsoft Windows Sound System, General MIDI, Roland MT-32 (though with different instrument sounds) and MPU-401, in addition to its own, well- supported native Soundscape mode. Of critical importance at the time was support of the Creative Labs Sound Blaster, a card that was the ubiquitous sound standard of the day. Soundscape can emulate the Sound Blaster 2.0, an 8-bit monaural device with FM synthesis capability. While the digital sound emulation was quite good, the FM synthesis emulation leaves much to be desired. Emulating FM synthesis through software was too demanding for the CPUs of the time (typically an 80486), and so Ensoniq wrapped most of the FM synthesis commands to the card's sample-based synthesis engine, meaning that FM music did not sound correct because it was composed with FM synthesis in mind, not real instruments. This could be especially poor if the game was an older title that used FM synthesis for sound effects. The reasoning behind using emulation instead of real hardware was cost and demand. FM synthesis hardware support for games at the time required an additional chip, the Yamaha OPL-2 or OPL-3. At the time Soundscape arrived, most games supported General MIDI output, offering high-quality music support for users who purchased the card and reducing the need for said OPL-3 synthesis chip. The board's SoundBlaster support could be toggled on and off, allowing use of a second sound card (usually an existing sound device) to take care of the actual OPL-3 FM synthesis if desired. The advantage of a single card that could do either, however, was very important for mind share amongst consumers, and was critical for OEM system sellers because adding a separate card would add cost to the system. Software support The SoundScape was well-supported by many mid-to- late 1990s programs, both directly and via General MIDI. Ensoniq released drivers for many operating systems, including IBM OS/2, MS-DOS, Microsoft Windows 3.1, Windows 95, and Windows NT. Ensoniq later released Microsoft DirectSound-capable drivers as well. In these operating systems, programs accessed the sound card through its driver, allowing full hardware support without the need for the software developer to support the card directly.

He served as chancellor of King Ottokar II of Bohemia from 1255 and was elected Bishop of Bamberg in 1257 and Bishop of Passau in 1265. W≈Çadys≈Çaw became Prince-Archbishop of Salzburg in the same year, and from 1268 also served as administrator of the Wroc≈Çaw diocese. Family W≈Çadys≈Çaw was the fifth and youngest son of the Silesian duke Henry II the Pious, by his wife Anna, daughter of the P≈ôemyslid king Ottokar I of Bohemia. The Silesian Piasts, elder line of the Polish ruling Piast dynasty, had been restored into their Silesian heritage by the aid of Emperor Frederick Barbarossa in 1163. W≈Çadys≈Çaw's grandfather, Duke Henry the Bearded, also regained the Seniorate Province and the Polish Crown as High Duke in 1232. Duke Henry II became co-ruler of his father in 1226 and was able to succeed him as Silesian duke and High Duke of Poland in 1238. When he was killed during the Mongol invasion in the Battle of Legnica on 9 April 1241, W≈Çadys≈Çaw's eldest brother Boles≈Çaw II the Bald assumed the rule over the Lower Silesian lands and the guardianship of his minor siblings. Stuck in internal conflicts with his brothers Henry III the White and Mieszko, he was not able to secure the Polish throne, which he had to cede to his Piast cousin Konrad of Masovia. Life Silesia in 1248/51: Creation of the Lower Silesian duchies of Legnica (violet) and G≈Çog√≥w (green) With the approval of their mother Anna of Bohemia and with the purpose to not further divide the paternal lands, the younger sons of late Henry II, W≈Çadys≈Çaw and Konrad I, were sent to study at the Italian university of Padua, with the idea that both prepare for an ecclesiastical career. In 1248, their rivalling elder brothers Henry III and Boles≈Çaw II finally came to terms: Henry assumed the government over the Lower Silesian lands around Wroc≈Çaw, after he made a land division with Boles≈Çaw II. He chose W≈Çadys≈Çaw as co-ruler, while Konrad I supposedly became co-ruler in the newly established Duchy of Legnica under Boles≈Çaw. However, the Duke of Legnica refused to share the power with anybody. Konrad fled to Greater Poland and, backed by his brother-in-law Duke Przemys≈Ç I, eventually obtained the Duchy of G≈Çog√≥w as his own share in 1251. In the case of Henry III and W≈Çadys≈Çaw, the cooperation between the brothers was a mutual agreement with few opportunities to frictions, as W≈Çadys≈Çaw mainly stayed in the Bohemian capital Prague at the court of his maternal cousin King Ottokar II. His role in the undivided Duchy of Wroc≈Çaw was limited to receive his rents; Henry III took under his hands all the government. Nevertheless, W≈Çadys≈Çaw too issued numerous deeds and in 1261 he and his brother jointly vested the Wroc≈Çaw citizens with Magdeburg rights. With the support of the Bohemian king, W≈Çadys≈Çaw continued his spiritual career: about 1255 he became a provost at the cathedral chapter of the St Peter and Paul collegiate church in Vy≈°ehrad (today a part of Prague) and thus was appointed Bohemian Royal Chancellor, a post exclusively reserved for the Vy≈°ehrad provosts. The close alliance between the Silesian Piasts and the P≈ôemyslid dynasty strengthened the ties between the lands of Silesia and Bohemia. W≈Çadys≈Çaw joined the cathedral chapter in Bamberg in 1256 and was elected bishop in the following year, however, he had to resign, as he received no dispensation by Pope Alexander IV due to his young age. Backed by King Ottokar II, he became a member of the Wroc≈Çaw chapter and in April 1265 he was elected Bishop of Passau. In October he was elected Archbishop of Salzburg; this time he received the consent of Pope Clement IV. W≈Çadys≈Çaw arrived in Salzburg in Spring 1266. He had to return to Silesia upon the death of his brother Duke Henry III the White on 3 December 1266. In his will, he left W≈Çadys≈Çaw the guardianship of his infant son Henry IV Probus and with this, the regency of the whole Silesian duchy of Wroc≈Çaw. Henry III's government had not been too beneficial to the church; W≈Çadys≈Çaw, now as a bishop and also regent, was not inclined to preserve the prerogatives of the nobility, but at the end he was forced to accept this. The bishop-regent was an advocate, with his late brother Henry III, for the canonization of their paternal grandmother, Duchess Hedwig of Silesia (n√©e of Andechs). The process was finally completed, when Saint Hedwig was canonized by Pope Clement on 26 March 1267. This was certainly W≈Çadys≈Çaw's great personal success and gave much prestige to the whole family. The final chord of his great church's career was his nomination in 1268 to the Bishopric of Wroc≈Çaw. W≈Çadys≈Çaw had no intention to sacrifice the Archbishopric of Salzburg, but thanks to his influence in Prague and Rome he was appointed an apostolic administrator with all the rights of a bishop. W≈Çadys≈Çaw fulfilled all his duties honestly, a quite uncommon attitude among the medieval princes. When he was Archbishop of Salzburg and shortly afterwards received the title of an administrator in the Diocese of Wroclaw, he was able to combine the two positions so that no one can say that these features overwhelm them. The last four years of life he was in constant travels between Salzburg and Wroc≈Çaw. W≈Çadys≈Çaw died on 27 April 1270 and was buried in Salzburg Cathedral. In his will, he left his rights over the half of the Duchy of Wroclaw to his nephew Henry IV Probus. There were some rumours that the cause of death of the young bishop, with not more than thirty-three years, was poisoning. Guilty of this crime have to be among the nobility, who four years earlier apparently killed Duke Henry III the White, and almost twenty years later his nephew Henry IV shared the same fate. The mere fact of mentioning the same source (the Chronicle of the Silesian Piast Dukes and his likes) stated that the subsequent death of the Dukes of Wroclaw in a short term appears to be somewhat suspect. Likely source of sensational suit has gone, but few credible rumors. The sudden death of a young prince caused by natural factors in the time, when the medical service was not the best, could easily be interpreted as a poisoning. W≈Çadys≈Çaw's death was likely, however, natural, which indicates the presumable place of his death, Salzburg. If the Polish nobles actually wanted to kill him, they presumably would have made this when he stayed in Wroclaw and may not have chosen a long journey to Germany to eliminate the bishop-regent.

He is former general counsel for the American Civil Rights Union. A libertarian scholar, he is known for supporting privatization of the Social Security program and for being an opponent of climate change alarmism. Early life and education A 2005 profile for the Harvard Law Bulletin reported that Ferrara recalled at age nine \\"being transfixed while watching television as Barry Goldwater stormed the 1964 Republican National Convention.\\" Ferrara grew up in Phoenix, Arizona and graduated in 1976 from Harvard College with an A.B. in economics magna cum laude and from Harvard Law School in 1979 cum laude. At Harvard, Ferrara wrote at the student newspaper The Harvard Crimson. While in law school, he also participated in the Harvard Libertarian Association. Future Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts attended both Harvard College and Law School with Ferrara. Career His senior law school thesis evolved into the debut hardcover publication by the libertarian Cato Institute in 1980, Social Security: The Inherent Contradiction. From 1981 to 1983, Ferrara served in the White House Office of Policy Development under President Ronald Reagan and was an Associate Deputy Attorney General from 1991 to 1993. Between those positions, Ferrara became a Heritage Foundation analyst specializing in Social Security issues. He also became an insurance consultant and provided expertise in Social Security to media. In 1987, Ferrara joined the faculty of the George Mason University School of Law and directed its legal writing programs until 1991. As late as 2003, Ferrara has taught there. In the early 2000s (decade), he founded the Virginia chapter of Club for Growth and directed the International Center for Law and Economics.International Center for Law and Economics As a writer, Ferrara's employers included erstwhile lobbyist and convicted felon, Jack Abramoff, who hired Ferrara to write op-ed pieces favorable to Abramoff clients. Ferrara doesn't disclose which pieces he is paid to write, but according to a Business Week article, the specific pieces may have been articles in The Washington Times about the Northern Marianas Islands and The Choctaw Indian tribe. Ferrara stated that those writings reflect his independently held views on the respective subjects. \\"I do that all the time.

Ferrara graduated from the law school in 1979, according to his ACRU biography National Review magazine published his essay \\"What Is An American?\\" in its September 25, 2001 issue, after the September 11 attacks.Peter Ferrara: What Is An American? National Review online, September 25, 2001. In the essay, he claims that \\"there are more Muslims in America than in Afghanistan\\", although census numbers show Afghanistan has roughly ten to fifteen times as many Muslims as the United States. The essay was reproduced in a chain e-mail claiming that an Australian dentist wrote it.

It offers the highest MIDI quality of any PC sound card Ensoniq produced. The board is an evolution of the company's previous Soundscape S-2000. The Soundscape ELITE was launched in March 1995. Ensoniq Elite Press Release - Elite: RAM/ROM samples with dual DSP, Google Groups, April 2, 1995. Overview ESP daughtercard The card's layout is quite similar to the Soundscape S-2000, and uses the same synthesizer chips and codecs. Changes include a revision of the 2 MiB patch ROM equipped with new sounds, and the addition of a powerful digital signal processor (DSP) daughtercard. This DSP, called the Ensoniq Signal Processor (ESP), allows popular enhancement effects to be applied to the Elite's patch sounds. The ESP was used on Ensoniq's musical instruments as well, such as their ASR samplers, TS synthesizers, and the DP Series effects processors. The most popular effects used are reverb and chorus, which are enabled by default on the card. The ESP is also fully configurable through a Windows utility (the \\"ENSONIQ Effects Tool Kit\\") and through standard sysex commands which can be issued in various ways (i.e. DOS utilities). Unfortunately the Effects Tool Kit never progressed beyond the beta development stage and is, as a result, not entirely stable or functional. Soundscape ELITE, like the original Soundscape, has several connections for the proprietary CD-ROM interfaces of the time. However, instead of the Soundscape S-2000's Mitsumi, Matsushita, and Sony interfaces, the Elite gained a new IDE ATAPI interface which was a new standard implemented to improve the ease of utilizing CD-ROM drives. The board's chipset consists of Ensoniq's OTTO and Sequoia synthesizer chips with the Motorola 68EC000 8 MHz controller, the ESP board, and an Analog Devices 1848KP codec for digital audio.

This episode was nominated for an Emmy in the category \\"Outstanding Special Visual Effects for a Series\\" and a Gemini Award in the category \\"Best Visual Effects\\".\\"Stargate SG-1\\" (1997) - Awards Plot After SG-1 was thrown into another galaxy by the supernova, they now face Apophis. Because there are no other options they contact Apophis but he isn't interested in what they wish to say and threatens to destroy them. The SG-1 can do nothing but wait for their destruction. Apophis finally fires. However, not on them, but instead he fires upon another alien ship, which attacks Apophis. Jacob uses this chance to escape and flies the ship into the corona of a blue giant, whose radiation will mask their presence however blocking their own sensors at the same time. They are able to repair their shields but have no crystals left to repair the Hyperspace engines. In the meantime, O'Neill recounts what happened on Vorash to Daniel. At Stargate Command, the Tok'ra visit General Hammond, explaining that they destroyed Apophis' fleet as planned but contact has been lost with SG-1. Hammond, however, refuses to believe they are dead. On their ship, the Carters complete the repairs and leave the corona. They detect Apophis' ship, yet no life signs emanate from it, so they ring aboard to get new crystals. There, it appears the self-destruct command was activated, which Jacob wants to deactivate, while O'Neill and Major Carter retrieve the crystals. However, they soon detect Replicators. Nevertheless, they procure the crystals, but not before the Replicators attack. The three ring back to the Ha'tak and escape in the wake of the explosion of Apophis' ship. Afterwards, they bring the hyperspace engines back online when they suddenly detect a Tel'tak, piloted by Teal'c with several Jaffa which, according to Teal'c, helped him escape. Teal'c lands his ship on the Ha‚Äôtak and is greeted by his team mates. However, when O'Neill's goes to embrace him, Teal‚Äôc takes his gun and, with the other Jaffa, holds SG-1 at gunpoint. Apophis enters and declares Teal'c as his First Prime again. SG-1 is arrested while Teal'c claims that he was in the service of Apophis all along, calling his time with SG-1 ‚Äúsubterfuge.‚Äù The Jaffa begin to unload the cargo from the Tel'tak, unknowingly bringing Replicators aboard. As SG-1 tries to escape, Jacob frees them, only to be stopped by Teal'c, imprisoning him as well. Suddenly, the ship unexpectedly exits hyperspace. Jaffa find the engine room infested with Replicators. By mere happenstance, the Replicators also allow SG-1 to escape their cell. Apophis tries to escape from the Replicators as they kill his Jaffa, forcing him to barricade himself in the command center. While Jacob and Daniel secure the cargo ship, Jack and Sam try to subdue Teal'c with help from a shock grenade. They successfully capture him with a precise but not lethal shot and kill the remaining Jaffa. Teal'c is safely brought aboard the Tel'tak but, without any warning, the mothership enters hyperspace, barring any way to get off the Ha‚Äôtak. SG-1 quickly learns that the Replicators have modified the engines so that the ship exceeds its fastest velocity by 800 times. This will also allow SG-1 to quickly travel back to their home galaxy. However, because of the threat which the Replicators pose, they must prevent the scourge from ever infesting the Milky Way. So, they plan to use the same tactic which they used on Thor's ship by destroying the sub-light engines' controls (causing an uncontrolled re- entry of the ship into the atmosphere (see \\"Nemesis\\"). While Jacob returns to the cargo ship, SG-1 goes to the engine room to lay in wait for the right moment to execute their plan. When the ship leaves hyperspace right in front Sokar's home planet, they destroy the control crystals and escape but are chased by Replicators. Nevertheless, they are able to get into a ring room and Jacob rings them to the Tel'tak. They leave the Ha'tak, which falls to the planet and is destroyed, thus finally eliminating the evil Apophis. As they head home, Jacob tells Jack that although they've gotten Teal'c's body back, getting his mind freed from Apophis's brainwashing techniques won't be easy. Unbothered, Jack attempts to convince Teal'c that Apophis is dead but Teal'c refuses to believe him, simply stating that Gods cannot be killed. Reception This episode was nominated for an Emmy in the category \\"Outstanding Special Visual Effects for a Series\\" and a Gemini Award in the category \\"Best Visual Effects\\". Series continuity This episode marked the final death of Apophis, though actor Peter Williams returned in several later episodes to reprise his role in flashbacks, hallucinations, and alternate realities, including Citizen Joe, Inauguration, and Stargate: Continuum. While the Replicators in earlier episodes were always spider-like, this episodes introduces them in several new insect-forms.

It was Ensoniq's last sound card product before they were acquired by Creative Technology. The card represented a shift in Ensoniq's market positioning. Whereas the Soundscape line had been made up primarily of low- volume high-end products full of features, the AudioPCI was designed to be a very simple, low-cost product to appeal to system OEMs and thus hopefully sell in mass quantities.  Low cost  Ensoniq AudioPCI Towards the end of the 1990s, Ensoniq was struggling financially. Their cards were very popular with PC OEMs, but their costs were too high and their musical instrument division was fading in revenue. Pressure from intense competition, especially with the dominant Creative Labs, was forcing audio card makers to try to keep their prices low. The AudioPCI, released in July 1997, was designed primarily to be cheap. In comparison to the wide variety of chips on and sheer size of the older Soundscape boards, the highly integrated two chip design of the AudioPCI is an obvious shift in design philosophy. The board consists only of a very small software-driven audio chip (one of the following: S5016, ES1370, ES 1371) and a companion digital-to-analog converter (DAC). In another cost- cutting move, the previously typical ROM chip used for storage of samples for sample-based synthesis was replaced with the facility to use system RAM as storage for this audio data. This was made possible by the move to the PCI bus, with its far greater bandwidth and more efficient bus mastering interface when compared to the older ISA bus standard.  Features  AudioPCI, while designed to be cheap, is still quite functional. It offers many of the audio capabilities of the Soundscape ELITE card, including several digital effects (reverb, chorus, and spatial enhancement) when used with Microsoft Windows 95 and later versions of Windows. AudioPCI was one of the first cards to have Microsoft DirectSound3D 4-speaker playback support. The 4-speaker mode is only activated by software supporting the DirectSound3D quadraphonic mode. An oddity is that the rear channel was connected to the same output jack as line input. The jack switches modes if 4-speaker output became active. The DOS and Windows drivers support sample-based synthesis through Ensoniq's \\".ecw\\" patch set format. Several patch set choices are available, varying in size and instrument quality (2, 4, or 8 MB). The \\".ecw\\" file format (Ensoniq Concert Wavetable) was never made open as had been hoped for by enthusiasts.Official response from Creative Labs Developer Relations Consequently, there are very few custom wave sets available, in contrast to the huge availability of home- made releases in E-mu's SoundFont format. It was particularly unfortunate because the AudioPCI used system RAM for patch set storage which in itself offers tremendous potential for new patch sets over the traditional ROM storage previously used. It is also disappointing considering the incredible popularity and longevity of the Ensoniq ES1370 chipset and its descendants, some of which were still in use six years after the original AudioPCI board, and the fact that DOS drivers for the far newer Sound Blaster Audigy still use \\".ecw\\" wave sets. These newer cards are unable to use SoundFonts in DOS, limiting them to the three official .ecw wavesets from the late '90s and one incomplete unofficial waveset..ECW file specification and a custom waveset  DOS compatibility  The AudioPCI supported DOS games and applications using a software driver that would install during DOS, or the real-mode, boot-time portion of Windows 9x. This driver virtualized a Sound Blaster-compatible ISA sound card through the use of the PC's NMI and a TSR program. This allowed the AudioPCI to have more compatible out-of-the-box DOS support than some of its PCI competitors for the time. For example, the competing Monster Sound from Diamond Multimedia was limited to running DOS games in Windows 9x-based DOS command windows, meaning DOS compatibility was frequently only reliable through an additional ISA sound card. Creative was struggling with the challenge of legacy support as well, and had created the SB-Link, an interconnect that allowed access to the serial-IRQ and PC/PCI grant/request sideband signals offered by some PCI chipsets of the time, in order to achieve DOS compatibility for their Sound Blaster AWE64-variant PCI sound cards. SB- Link was also used by a number of other chipset vendors, such as ESS and Yamaha. While Ensoniq's approach generally worked with most games, some older games had problems detecting the virtualized hardware on some systems. In addition, the DOS driver required a memory manager such as EMM386 to be loaded, which not only required additional conventional memory space but also put the CPU into Virtual-86 mode, conflicting with games that utilized a modified form of protected mode, called 'flat mode'. This mode allowed fast, direct access to the system's entire RAM without requiring a memory manager or memory protection mechanism. This is not a requirement exclusive to AudioPCI, however, as a number of ISA sound cards used it as well, including the Creative AWE ISA series. The AudioPCI DOS driver included Ensoniq Soundscape 16-bit digital audio and sample-based synthesis support, along with support for Sound Blaster Pro, AdLib Gold, General MIDI, and MT-32. However, without actual hardware for FM synthesis, FM music and sound effects were simulated using samples, often with unacceptable results. Therefore, it was practical to configure DOS games to utilize the General MIDI synthesizer and digital sound effects, whenever possible, for better sound quality. DOS MIDI utilizes the same .ecw patch set files as Windows MIDI. Creative acquisition Part of the deal when Ensoniq was purchased by Creative Labs was to integrate the AudioPCI DOS driver into the upcoming Sound Blaster Live!. Creative added Sound Blaster 16 emulation to the driver and removed the Ensoniq SoundScape support. AudioPCI itself was re-branded as several Creative Labs sound cards, including the Sound Blaster PCI 64, PCI 128, Vibra PCI, and others. The Ensoniq ES1370 audio chip was renamed Creative 5507 and revised into AC'97-compliant variants, the ES1371 and ES1373, and used for several more years on card and as integrated motherboard audio. Cards with ES1370 run natively at 44 kHz sampling frequency, meaning that 12, 24, 32 and 48 kHz become resampled. Resampling means lower sound quality, worse synchronization and possibly higher CPU utilization. Cards with ES1371 run at 48 kHz conforming to AC97, so 11, 22 and 44 kHz become resampled. For few soundcards feature multiple quartzes or a PLL, resampling is often used with all its potential problems. Creative Labs Malvern (which was the former Ensoniq company that had been acquired) later released the Ectiva 1938 (EV1938). This single chip PCI audio controller was based on the ES1371/ES1373 and was register compatible with these previous chips. The main difference between the EV1938 and previous chips was the inclusion of a built-in AC'97 codec (hence producing a cheaper, single chip audio solution). The EV1938 was also used for both integrated audio on laptops/motherboards and on cards, such as the \\"Sound Blaster AudioPCI 64V\\" (CT4730). PCI Bus Digital Audio and Music Controller=ES1370 Ensoniq ES1370 AudioPCI The AudioPCI ES1370 was developed by Ensoniq. One important feature of this chip was that it used the PCI bus, instead of the ISA bus commonly used by sound cards at that point. It was one of the first PCI sound card solutions to offer MS-DOS legacy compatibility without special hardware extensions to the standard PCI slot. When paired with a capable codec, such as the AK4531 (pre-AC'97), the ES1370 supported the then-latest in 3D audio positioning through 4-speaker surround sound. The chip was also a PCI bus master device that was designed to provide high-speed access to system RAM and resources, for sample synthesis data and effect processing. Depending on the drivers, it may also be called the Sound Blaster 64/128 in the device manager. ES1370 was one of the first audio chips to support the Microsoft DirectSound3D audio API. When programs took full advantage of the API's capabilities, the ES1370 was capable of both global spatial and localized 3D sound effects, in both 2 and 4-speaker mode. The chip was capable of spatializing all audio automatically, but still required DirectSound3D usage for specific localization of sounds. The ES1370 is also emulated as a piece of virtual hardware in QEMU and VMware. *ENSONIQ SoundScape 'wavetable' sample-based synthesis (frequently called 'wavetable synthesis', albeit incorrectly) *2 and 4 MB downloadable sound sets (2 MB = GM, 4 MB & 8 MB = GM+GS+10 drum kits) *32 simultaneous MIDI voices *Uses system RAM for sound storage (memory locked or dynamic OS control) *Multi- algorithm reverb and chorus *Multiple level spatial 3D sound *Microsoft DirectSound3D compatible (4 speaker 3D sound with AK4531 codec) *16-bit Record & Playback at up to 48 kHz *Support for hardware sound rendering *Support for EAX 1.0, OpenAL *Low system overhead, PCI bus master *100% DOS legacy compatible (allegedly; some games fail to detect the virtualized hardware and/or clash with Virtual-86 mode) *Unlimited digital audio streams *I¬≤S input *OPL-FM and MPU-401 emulation (using the sample synthesis engine; FM emulation was inauthentic at best) *Only a single, shared IRQ required *No ISA signals required *No distributed DMA signals required *Drivers: DOS, Windows 3.1x, Win'95, WinNT, (WinNT (Alpha), Solaris (SPARCengine Ultra AX), Linux, and BeOS available) ES1371 and ES1373 Ensoniq ES1373 AudioPCIEnsoniq/Creative ES1371 and ES1373 (AudioPCI 97) are AC'97-compatible versions. https://downloadcenter.intel.com/Detail_Desc.aspx?lang=eng&changeLang;=true&DwnldID;=2583 *Sample sets: 2, 4, and 8 MB sets **128 General MIDI sample-based instruments, 61 drum programs, 128 MT-32 instruments, Roland GS Sound set in 4 & 8 MB sets *Synthesizer: Up to 32 simultaneous voice polyphony, 16 MIDI channels **Digital effects: reverb, chorus, and spatial enhancement *Digital audio **16-bit record & playback at up to 48 kHz (mono/stereo).

The Pilot was available in capacities from 2.2 to 2.6 tonnes in a load area. Power came from a 1.9 litre Peugeot diesel engine driving the rear wheels through a five speed gearbox. Access to the load area is from either the rear or a sliding side door. History Derived from the Morris/BMC J4 and JU250 vans of the 1960s, the core vehicle went through a series of developments, the main one being the revision of the forward control layout of the J4 and moving the engine ahead of the cab and accessible via a bonnet. This allowed the wheelbase to be extended resulting in greater stability, payload, side loading and the distinctive 'Sherpa' profile (though the last of the J4s and the first Sherpa are largely identical from the rear). The Sherpa gave way to the Freight Rover 200 Series and in turn the Leyland DAF 200 Series before finally becoming the Pilot after LDV was formed in 1993. It was originally designed to be built on car production lines which led to it having a narrow track. This feature was made into a virtue in later publicity by stressing its ability in narrow city streets ‚Äì this indeed was why the Sherpa series was for many years, preferred over the Ford Transit by the Royal Mail, in particular. Sherpa (1974‚Äì1982) Originally developed by British Leyland the model was launched in 1974 under the nameplate Leyland Van. A year later the name of the model was changed to the Leyland Sherpa. The Sherpa would then be branded as a Morris and later a Freight Rover. The initial Sherpa line up consisted of vans in 185, 215 and 240 versions (where 185 denotes a GVW of 1.85 tons, and so on); pick ups in 215 and 240 versions; a 240 crewbus and minibus; and various chassis cab options in 220 and 250 versions. Payloads were quoted as 13/14cwt for the 185; 18/19cwt for the 215 and 220; and 22/23cwt for the 240 and 250. Loadspace, at , was considerably higher than that of the J4 and only just short of the Morris 250 JU. In 1978 the 1.7 and 2.0 litre O series engines replaced the original 1622 cc and 1798 cc B series petrol units, while the 1798 cc B series diesel stayed put. The range was redesignated accordingly: vans: 200, 230 and 250; pick ups: 230 and 250; minibus and crewbus: 250 only; chassis cab: 255 only. A few months later, the Sherpa was rebadged as a Morris. In 1981, BL created the Freight Rover division as part of the Land Rover group, so the Sherpa's badges were changed again. Sherpa K2 Series (1982‚Äì1984) The short lived K2 Sherpa had a neater appearance and much improved side access to the load bay. The Sherpa van could now be bought in 200, 230, 250 and 280 versions. The crewbus and minibus continued in 250 form. Loadspace remained at , but a new \\"Hi Capacity\\" walk thru body was also offered, built on either the 255 or 280 chassis cab, and offering of loadspace. An optional Luton body took loadspace up to , again with a choice of basic chassis cab GVWs. The original, integral pick up had now been dropped in favour of a dropside pick up built on the Sherpa chassis-cab. The 255 and 280 chassis cabs were also available on their own, ready to receive bespoke bodywork. Engine availability continued unaltered, with 1.7 and 2.0 litre O series petrol units, the 1.8 litre B series diesel and the option of a Landi-Hartog LPG conversion, first introduced at the launch of Freight Rover the year before. A 4WD Sherpa van was also now offered. Freight Rover 200 Series (1984‚Äì1989) With the next facelift, the Sherpa (now known as the Freight Rover 200 series) gained square headlamps, new bumpers and repositioned indicators. Alongside the original bodystyle there was new wide bodied variant (Freight Rover 300 Series). The 200 Series was initially available with a two tonne GVW. The capacity for the 200 series remained at . A Luton style body was offered, built on the 255 chassis cab, providing a capacity of , and a maximum payload of almost two tonnes. The chassis cab also formed the basis for drop side pick ups, in 255, 280 and 285 versions, again available with either short or long wheelbases. Of course, the chassis cab could also be ordered on its own, again in a choice of lengths, so that bespoke bodywork could be fitted, with the added option of either single or double cabs. The 200 series continued to be offered as minibus or crewbus. While the K2 Sherpa's engines remained available (including the ancient B series diesel), a 2.5 litre diesel unit was now offered on the 300 series. The B series diesel bowed out in November 1986 for the 200 series, being then replaced by the 2.0 NA direct injection Diesel Rover MDi / Perkins Prima, (as found in Maestros and in turbocharged form in Montegos and late Maestros (from 1992 to 1994)) which was effectively a dieselised BL O series engine. This was a somewhat raucous, noisy and unrefined engine but was however a very reliable unit capable of excellent fuel economy, although performance of the naturally aspirated engine was not a strong point. As a city van it was adequate but totally unsuitable for motorway work due to the noise levels. At the same point, the O-series 1.7 and 2.0 Petrol engines were given an upgrade becoming the O2. A low compression version of the Rover 3.5 litre V8 unit (taken from Land Rover) also became available on certain versions of the 300 Series (with a modified drivetrain) from 1986, producing . This version was designed for emergency services and express delivery operators, and was bought in large numbers by the police and ambulance services. Economy was very poor with this engine, with a claimed figure of only . However, with the sale of Freight Rover in 1989, the Rover Group left this sector of the light commercial market. Leyland DAF 200 Series (1989‚Äì1993) With Freight Rover becoming Leyland DAF, the 200 Series was given a new radiator grille, bearing the Leyland DAF badge. The 200 Series continued to be built on car lines and its narrow width meant it became a very popular city van. The last 200s switched from the Perkins Prima engine to the less economical but more refined, naturally aspirated indirect injection PSA XUD 1.9L engine. LDV 200 Series (1993‚Äì1997) LDV 200 Following the sell off of the van business from the insolvent Leyland DAF in 1993, LDV Limited was formed. LDV Pilot (1997‚Äì2006) LDV Pilot rear In 1996, the van received a facelift with less boxy front panels and a redesigned dashboard and seating and was renamed the Pilot. The facelift also saw the end of the '80s Rover stalks, but not the instruments and minor switchgear. The van became popular as a minibus, and was available in pick up and fleet based vans, as well as being used by the army for transporting troops. Power arrived in the form of a Peugeot 1905cc diesel engine throughout the entire range, however it made the Pilot sluggish and only able to achieve (One of the rare versions with the turbocharged version of this engine was an altogether more satisfying drive). It also had little torque meaning most hills required the driver to change down. Early models have basic interiors consisting of two or three seats, Mountain Blue coloured plastic dashboard and LDV branded FM/AM cassette radio. Gears are selected using the now unpopular floor mounted gear stick. The van was also used by various police forces and the Royal Mail. Turkish variant A Turkish-made BMC Levend 80 TDI Turbo Intercooler A Sherpa derived van was also produced in Turkey by BMC Sanayi ve Ticaret A.S. as the BMC Levend, and as of 2006, a pick up derivative is also sold. This was not promoted in the United Kingdom. Film appearance A first generation Sherpa van made an appearance in the 1977 James Bond film The Spy Who Loved Me which was driven by the villainous Jaws (Richard Kiel) on a journey through the Sahara Desert, with Bond (Roger Moore) and his partner Anya Amasova (Barbara Bach) hiding in the back in their quest to recover a microfilm crucial to their mission. They managed to escape in the vehicle after retrieving the microfilm but were unable to complete their journey due to the damage that Jaws had inflicted upon it in his earlier attempt to prevent them from escaping. In Billy Elliot movie there was a Leyland Sherpa (1984) which was given two stars by IMCDb. Kit car A short lived Sherpa 200 derived Kit Car produced by Sherpley Motors of Loughborough was manufactured briefly between 1997 and 2007, first being reported in Which Kit of October 1997. The kit was engineered to loosely resemble a vintage Bentley. The early Speed Six design just used Sherpa axles and suspension, fitted to a custom chassis and mated to an engine of buyer's choice before being fitted with an Aluminium and fiberglass fabricated body; the later Speed Four model used the complete Sherpa 200 chassis and running gear (and occasionally engine) to enable it to pass the stricter SVA rules imposed after 1999. The vehicle did not prove to be popular, and only 17 examples of the Sherpley were manufactured between these dates; the last one known to be sold still in kit form was advertised on eBay in 2013, prior to being sold privately for an undisclosed sum.

It is a first-person narrative that tells the story of Dinah, daughter of Jacob and Leah, sister of Joseph. She is a minor character in the Bible, but the author has broadened her story. The book's title refers to the tent in which women of Jacob's tribe must, according to the ancient law, take refuge while menstruating or giving birth, and in which they find mutual support and encouragement from their mothers, sisters and aunts. Plot summary Dinah opens the story by recounting for readers the union of her mother Leah and father Jacob, as well as the expansion of the family to include Leah's sister Rachel, and the handmaids Zilpah and Bilhah. Leah is depicted as capable but testy, Rachel as something of a belle, but kind and creative, Zilpah as eccentric and spiritual, and Bilhah as the gentle and quiet one of the quartet. Dinah remembers sitting in the red tent with her mother and aunts, gossiping about local events and taking care of domestic duties between visits to Jacob, the family's patriarch. A number of other characters not seen in the biblical account appear here, including Laban's second wife Ruti and her feckless sons. According to the Bible's account in Genesis 34, Dinah was \\"defiled\\" by a prince of Shechem, although he is described as being genuinely in love with Dinah. He also offers a bride price fit for royalty. Displeased at how the prince treated their sister, her brothers Simeon (spelled \\"Simon\\" in the book) and Levi treacherously tell the Shechemites that all will be forgiven if the prince and his men undergo the Jewish rite of circumcision (brit milah) so as to unite the people of Hamor, king of Shechem, with the tribe of Jacob. The Shechemites agree, and shortly after they go under the knife, while incapacitated by pain, they are murdered by Dinah's brothers and their male servants, who then return with Dinah. In The Red Tent, Dinah genuinely loves the prince and willingly becomes his bride. She is horrified and grief-stricken by her brothers' murderous rampage. After cursing her brothers and father she escapes to Egypt, where she gives birth to a son. In time she finds another love and reconciles with her brother Joseph, who is now vizier of Egypt. At the death of Jacob, she visits her estranged family. She learns she has been all but forgotten by her other living brothers and father but that her story lives on with the women of Jacob's tribe. Reception The book was a New York Times bestseller and book club discussion guides for it have been published. According to the Los Angeles Times review, \\"By giving a voice to Dinah, one of the silent female characters in Genesis, the novel has struck a chord with women who may have felt left out of biblical history. It celebrates mothers and daughters and the mysteries of the life cycle.\\" The Christian Science Monitor wrote that the novel \\"vividly conjures up the ancient world of caravans, shepherds, farmers, midwives, slaves, and artisans...Diamant is a compelling narrator of a tale that has timeless resonance.\\" Historical accuracy The work promotes the biblical story. However, it is neither biblically nor historically correct. Diamant acknowledges that there is no evidence that ancient Israel used a menstrual tent for retreat, although she describes it as a common feature in other pre-modern cultures, as well as some modern cultures. Adaptations Lifetime adapted the novel into a two-part miniseries, which premiered December 7 and 8, 2014. Dinah is portrayed by Rebecca Ferguson. Leah is portrayed by Minnie Driver, and Rachel by Morena Baccarin. See also * Niddah * Mikvah * Menstrual taboo * Culture and menstruation * Red Tent Meetings References * * Rabbi J.

French advertisement for the Gestetner Cyclostyle, circa 1900 The Cyclostyle duplicating process is a form of stencil copying. A stencil is cut on wax or glazed paper by using a pen- like object with a small rowel on its tip. A large number of small short lines are cut out in the glazed paper, removing the glaze with the spur-wheel, then ink is applied. It was invented in the later 19th century by David Gestetner, who named it \\"cyclostyle\\" after a drawing tool he used. Its name incorporates \\"stylus\\", classical Latin word for a pen. In year 1893 Francis Galton gave the following brief description of a cyclostyle: ::\\"The cyclostyle, which is an instrument used for multiple writing, makes about 140 dots to the inch. The style has a minute spur-wheel or roller, instead of a [pen] point ; the writing is made on stencil paper, whose surface is covered with a brittle glaze. This is perforated by the teeth of the spur-wheel wherever they press against it. The half perforated sheet is then laid on writing paper, and an inked roller is worked over the glaze. The ink passes through the perforations and soaks through them on to the paper below ; consequently the impression consists entirely of short and irregular cross bars or dots.\\"Francis Galton's description of the cyclostyle is in Proceedings of the Royal Institution of Great Britain, Volume XIV, year 1893, pages 13‚Äì26, with cyclostyle on pages 20-22. In 1875 Thomas Edison received a patent for the \\"electric pen\\", which a decade later was superseded by the mimeograph machine. The cyclostyle was a more automated type of mimeograph machine that produced reproductions faster. See stencil duplicator and Gestetner Cyclograph Company. In 1893 Francis Galton described a system for sending line drawings through the widely established telegraph system, using simple numeric codes, and printing out the line drawings at the other end from the codes. He referred to this printer as a \\"Cyclostyle\\". It contained elements of Gestetner's system, and also elements in common with modern computer graphics printing of line drawings.

It contains many public gardens designed by French landscape gardener Paul de Lavenne Comte Choulot. History The commune of Le V√©sinet was created on 31 May 1875 by detaching a part of the territory of Chatou and merging it with a part of the territory of Croissy-sur-Seine and a part of the territory of Le Pecq. Geography Le V√©sinet is located in a bend of the Seine, but has no access to the river. It is 16.4 km (10.2 mi) west of Paris and 4 km east of Saint- Germain-en-Laye.

When none of the proposed submissions prove acceptable, Leary and Clarke end up combining several of the finalist's proposals to produce a new, semi-improvised ensemble sitcom entitled \\"Jesus and the Gang.\\" The new show ostensibly stars New York City theatre and television actor Peter Gallagher (again playing a fictionalized version of himself), but when Gallagher is hit by a car during the filming of a network promotion, the lead role is shifted to comedian Patrice O'Neal. During rehearsals for the premiere episode, the actors, crew and producers all start fighting each other (and themselves), and \\"Jesus and the Gang\\" is permanently shelved. Contest Searchlight was shown in a pseudo-documentary style, and there was no laugh track or other obvious sign that this was a fictional series.

In the early 1950s he formed a production company with Joseph Csida called Csida-Grean, a management company which had handled Arnold's career and produced his syndicated television show, Eddy Arnold Time. One of Grean's compositions became a focus of litigation in 1958 in the case Dorchester Music v. National Broadcasting Company [171 F. Supp. 580 (S.D. Cal. 1959)].Summary of the court case Fred Spielman, who had composed the song \\"Rendezvous\\" in 1953, charged that Grean had plagiarized from his song in writing \\"I Dreamed,\\" using the access he had as A&R; director to the original manuscripts when \\"Rendezvous\\" was submitted to RCA for recording. (No charge was made with reference to the lyrics.) The court found in favor of the plaintiff on November 18, 1958. Grean co-wrote the song \\"He'll Have to Stay\\" (answer to 1959's \\"He'll Have to Go\\") that went to #4 on the US pop chart by Jeanne Black in 1960. In the late 60s, much of his success came from working with Leonard Nimoy, for whom he produced and wrote a great portion of Nimoy's music. He also produced Betty Johnson's hits \\"I Dreamed\\" and \\"The Little Blue Man.\\" He also produced The Mills Brothers' late '60s album Fortuosity, which yielded the hit \\"Cab Driver\\".

He was Gauleiter of Gau Franconia and rose to the rank of Gruppenf√ºhrer in the Sturmabteilung (SA). Early years He was born the fifth child of a heliographer, also named Karl Holz. He finished Volksschule and an apprenticeship as a salesman, working thereafter as a clerk. During World War I, Holz served in a number of Prussian units between 1915 and 1918: Reserve-Infanterie-Regiment 16, Infanterie-Regiment 144, Infanterie-Regiment 79, and J√§ger-Regiment 2 on the Western Front. He sustained a number of wounds. After the war ended, he returned in September 1919 and took a job as an official in Nuremberg, but eventually was discharged due to his political activities. In 1920 he joined the German-Socialist Party (Deutschsozialistische Partei). In 1921 its chairman, Julius Streicher joined the Nazi Party (NSDAP), bringing with him enough members of the German- Socialist Party to almost double the size of the NSDAP overnight. Nazi career Holz officially joined the Nazi Party on 11 November 1922 and his membership number was 77. Holz also joined the Sturmabteilung (SA). Quite early on, Holz established a close relationship with Streicher. In 1924, Holz was elected to the Nuremberg City Council, serving till 1932 and eventually serving as leader of the Nazi faction. Between 1927 and 1933, he held the post of editor of Der St√ºrmer, Streicher's anti-Semitic weekly newspaper. He advanced to editor-in-chief during the years 1933 and 1938.Michael D. Miller & Andreas Schulz: Gauleiter: The Regional Leaders of the Nazi Party and Their Deputies, 1925-1945, Volume I (Herbert Albrecht - H. Wilhelm H√ºttmann), R. James Bender Publishing, 2012, p. 530,. Holz boasted many penalties for political crimes (by his own count 17, and among those 5 prison sentences). In 1929, the Gauleiter office in Upper Franconia, went to the Bayreuth Kreisleiter Hans Schemm, despite Streicher's support for Holz. In 1932 Holz was elected to the Bavarian Landtag and in November 1933 he was elected to the Reichstag. Also from 1933 to July 1934 Holz served as NSDAP Kreisleiter of Nuremberg City. As of 1 January 1934, Holz became Deputy Gauleiter to Streicher in Gau Franconia. In November he was promoted to the rank of SA- Brigadef√ºhrer. However, on 20 April 1940, in connection with the Streicher irregularities involving the Aryanization of Jewish assets, Holz was temporarily stripped of all his offices. World War II He was called up for military service with Panzer Regiment 25 and saw combat in France, being severely wounded in June 1940. He also served in the Russian campaign the next year. On 4 April 1942, he was returned to party service, becoming the Acting Gauleiter in Franconia, in succession to Hans Zimmermann. On 9 November 1942, he was promoted to the rank of SA-Gruppenf√ºhrer. On 16 November 1942, he was appointed the Reich Defense Commissioner for his Gau. Finally, in December 1944, Hitler appointed Holz as the permanent Gauleiter for Franconia. Holz led the defense of Nuremberg with Wehrmacht and Volksturm troops. After American troops of the 3rd Infantry Division had all but taken Nuremberg on 18 April 1945, Holz barricaded himself in the Palmenhofbunker at the Nuremberg Police Presidium along with a small group, among whom was the city's mayor, Willy Liebel. It has been assumed that Holz shot Liebel in the Palmenhofbunker owing to the latter's efforts to surrender the city to put a stop to the fighting, and because of the longstanding rivalry between the two men over control of the local Nuremberg Nazi Party. Holz met his own end in the same place on 20 April ‚Äì coincidentally Hitler's birthday ‚Äì but whether it was suicide or an injury sustained in the battle is unknown.

Seret or Sereter Hasidim were a group of Hasidic Jews that existed in the town of Siret (Seret) and the surrounding area in Bukovina (currently split between Romania and Ukraine) during the late nineteenth century until World War II. They were headed by their Rebbe (\\"Grand Rabbi\\") whose family name was Rubin and was a scion of the Hasidic dynasties of the Kosov, Ropshitz and Belz. In practice the Seret Hasidic group was a branch of the Kosov dynasty. History The best known Rebbe of Kosov (forerunner of the Vizhnitz Dynasty), Rabbi Chaim Hager died in 1854 in Kosov (at that time in East Galicia in Eastern Europe) and left three sons, each of whom had a great number of followers (Hasidim). The followers of the Hager family, whose numbers in Bukovina were great and who were important, tried to persuade one of the brothers, the second oldest, Rabbi Yosef Alter Hager, to move his permanent residence to Radovitz (Radauti). They wanted thereby to increase the number of visitors to the town, because the followers of the rabbi were accustomed to come from near and far for all holidays and even at other times to make pilgrimages to him. They were successful, and in 1856 he was received in Radovitz with great ceremony by the whole population. Reb Yosef Alter was married to Leah, the granddaughter of Reb Moshe Tzvi of Savran. Reb Yosef Alter did a lot to stimulate the Jewish community and he worked hand in hand with the community's Rabbi Schapira to increase the spirituality of the well- to-do. It is true that he sometimes had conflicts regarding the observance of the Sabbath, because as market day was Friday, some of them continued to work after the beginning of the Sabbath‚Äìsomething on Friday eve, that had much upset his father, Rabbi Chaim Hager, too. Matters went so far that the rabbi temporarily moved his seat to Seret in protest at the defilement. His followers tried to get the culprits to reform in order to persuade the rabbi to return to Radovitz and their efforts were crowned with success. The rabbi came back. All in all his stay in Radovitz was of considerable significance. The whole town, young and old, held him in great esteem and treated him with great respect for the whole of his twenty-year presence here. Whenever something good happened in the rabbi's family everyone rejoiced with him. On Saturdays and holidays the local population would join in prayers with Hasidim who had traveled here, and also partake of the rabbi's meals. In the year 1873 Reb Yosef Alter decided to emigrate to the Land of Israel in order to spend the last years of his life there. The pleas of his numerous friends and followers to give up this plan were to no avail. The rabbi stuck by his decision. But he did at least offer to leave his only son, Rabbi Moshe Hager in his place in Radovitz. The departure of the old Rabbi turned into a great procession. An unbroken row of wagons extended from his home six kilometers to the train station in Hadikfalva. Many thousands of local and foreign Hasidim were very reluctant to say a final goodbye to their beloved Rabbi.jewishgen.org/Yizkor/Radauti After his departure, his only son, Rabbi Moshe Hager, took over his seat in Radovitz, while his elder son in law Rabbi Shmuel Schmelke Rubin (1840-1901), who was married to his daughter Chaya, began to lead a large group of Hasidim in nearby Seret (Siret). Rabbi Schmelke's parents were Rabbi Yitzchok Rubin of Brody (Brod), the grandson of Rabbi Naftali Tzvi of Ropczyce (Ropschitz) and Eidel, who was the daughter of Rabbi Sholom Rokeach of Belz. As Reb Schmelke began leading his following in Seret, his name became renowned throughout Bukovina as a wondrous miracle worker and brilliant leader. In time, his followers increased and opened up \\"Sereter\\" synagogues in many towns of Bukovina such as; Gura Homuruliu, Suceava and Radovitz.jewishgen.org/yizkor/Bukowinabook After Rabbi Schmelke's passing in 1901 the following shrank significantly. He was succeeded as Rebbe by his son Rabbi Pinchos Menachem Mendel Rubin (1870-1941). Rabbi Schmelke's son in law Rabbi Chaim Dachner served as the head of the rabbinic court in Siret. Rabbi Mendel's eldest son was Rabbi Moses Josef Rubin of C√¢mpulung Moldovenesc (1892-1980) who was a prominent rabbi in pre-World War II Romania and post-war New York City. The renowned Halchachic authority Rabbi Meshulam Roth of CernƒÉu≈£i (1875-1962) was a son in law of Rabbi Mendel. Rabbi Boruch Hager of the Vizhnitz Hasidic dynasty served as the official town rabbi in Seret during the years 1936-1941. After World War II he moved to Israel where he established a neighborhood called \\"Ramat Vizhnitz\\" in Haifa and became known as the Seret-Vizhnitzer Rebbe. After his death he was succeeded by his son Rabbi Eliezer Hager. Who was then succeeded by his son inlaw rabbi naftali reuven kornreich Virtually all members of the original Seret community perished in the Transnistria concentration camps (see Romania during World War II). Legacy This dynasty ceased to exist during World War II. There are however, several Hasidic dynasties that descend from the Seret dynasty, including the: Muzhai, Sulitza, Sasregen and Ropshitz groups (see Ropshitz (Hasidic dynasty)) - all currently based in New York.

In the 1990s, Golb was an advocate for the freeing of the Scrolls for general scholarly studies. Golb was also the discoverer, in 1962, of the Kievan Letter, the earliest document attesting to Jewish habitation of Kiev. He also identified Obadiah the Proselyte as the author of the oldest known manuscript of Hebrew music (12th century), the earliest extant legal record of the Jews of Sicily, a new document dealing with the First Crusade and new manuscript materials relating to the Jews of Rouen.

It has no formal definition but is generally agreed to be bounded to the south by Upper Parliament Street, to the east by Grove Street, to the north by Myrtle Street and to the west by Hope Street. Canning is an area of almost entirely residential Georgian architecture, most of which strictly speaking dates from after the Georgian era. The area takes its name from one of its principal thoroughfares, Canning Street, which is named after George Canning, (1770-1827), a British politician who served as Foreign Secretary and, briefly, Prime Minister. History In 1800 the Liverpool Corporation Surveyor, John Foster, Sr., (1758-1827) prepared a gridiron plan for a large area of peat bog known as Mosslake Fields, which was to the east of Rodney Street. The area was built for and populated by the extremely wealthy of Liverpool. With the city's decline in the 20th century, the area grew unfashionable, and much of it became derelict. Areas along Upper Parliament St and Grove St and Myrtle St were demolished. The tide began to turn noticeably in the 1990s and the area is now much sought after. Nevertheless, the Office for National Statistics finds that it is one of the most deprived districts in the UK.ONS Neighbourhood Statistics generator See also *Gambier Terrace, Liverpool *Falkner Square *German Church *Architecture of Liverpool Bibliography *Buildings of Liverpool.

It is located in the Lizard Head Wilderness of the Uncompahgre National Forest, in the northwestern San Juan Mountains. It is the highest point in San Miguel County. Its base is accessible by four wheel drive roads west of Telluride, Colorado. Geography Wilson Peak is in the western part of the San Juan Mountains. The western San Juans are also known as the San Miguel Mountains or the Wilson Massif. Two additional fourteen thousand foot peaks are within of its summit: Mount Wilson () and El Diente Peak (). Gladstone Peak () is located on the ridge between Wilson Peak and Mount Wilson. Telluride Ski Resort Recreation Wilson Peak is climbed by hundreds each year, primarily in summer months, but winter ascents are not unusual and sometimes serve as the beginning of backcountry skiing descents. Summer ascents of the peak are considered Class 3 technical climbs, meaning that scrambling over rock is required (with hand holds being used for balance) and ropes typically not employed. The easiest traditional route begins at the end of the Silver Pick Road, climbs south through Silver Pick Basin to the Rock of Ages Saddle (between Silver Pick and Navajo Basins) at , then east to on the saddle between Gladstone and Wilson Peaks, then finally northeast to the summit. Round trip distance is . Use of this route has come into question since 2004 when private landowners failed to come to an agreement with the US Forest Service regarding hiking access. Government signs now warn against trespassing along the traditional route. In popular culture The stately and classically mountainous profile of Wilson Peak as viewed from the East and North has led to its use as a symbol of rugged mountains in advertising. Wilson Peak features prominently in many television advertisements for Coors Brewing Company which is located in Golden, Colorado. The Jeep automobile corporation also often uses Wilson Peak as a backdrop in its television commercials, particularly in advertisements for its off-road models. Wilson Peak is featured prominently in Quentin Tarantino's movie The Hateful Eight. Because of its proximity to Telluride, Colorado, many local companies and festivals use images of Wilson Peak in the advertising to convey the beauty and mountainous nature of the area.

After graduation, Smith served in the United States Army during World War II.William Yardley \\"Dick Smith Dies at 92; Makeup Artist of Vast Reach\\",New York Times, 1 August 2014 Early career in television Smith entered the field full-time after the war, and was entirely self-taught. He sent photographs of his work to the film industry, but his work was rejected until his father suggested he might try the emerging new medium of television. He was appointed as the first make-up director of WNBC (NBC's station in New York City), working there for fourteen years, often under producer David Susskind. Smith pioneered the development of prosthetic makeup, now better known as special make-up effects, from the basement of his home in Larchmont, New York, a district in which he mostly lived through his life. His colleagues though, he commented in a 2008 interview, \\"tended to be secretive. There was not at all that much make-up work in New York ‚Äì and Hollywood might as well have been on another planet. They weren‚Äôt eager to share anything; and the union did its best to discourage whatever inclination there might have been.\\" Prosthetic face masks were then normally made in one piece, but Smith made them in three foam latex pieces. Smith's technique allowed the actor to use their full range of facial expressions.Mike Barnes \\"Dick Smith, The 'Godfather of Makeup,' Dies at 92\\", Hollywood Reporter, 31 July 2014 Despite initial criticism from many professional make-up artists at the time, Smith's make-up techniques proved to be superior. The now standard methods of applying prosthetics to faces are those that Smith invented, according to Smith's prot√©g√© Rick Baker in a 2007 interview. For a television adaptation of The Moon and Sixpence (1959), Smith was required to turn Laurence Olivier into a leprosy victim: \\"When I finished the make-up, he looked in the mirror and said, 'Dick, it does the acting for me.' I've never forgotten his words.\\" Other early work by Smith was seen on Way Out (1961), a short-lived supernatural syndicated clone of Twilight Zone, produced by Susskind in New York City, and hosted by Roald Dahl. Most memorable was a make-up of a man (Barry Morse) who had half of his face suddenly erased by a spilled vial of photo retouching fluid that affected real people when merely applied to their photos. In another Way Out episode, a Hunchback of Notre-Dame make-up created by Smith becomes permanently affixed to an evil actor who then became his character and could never remove his make-up. Smith contributed to all 14 Way Out episodes, and other 1960s television shows as well. In 1965, Smith published an instructional book, titled Dick Smith's Do-It-Yourself Monster Make-up Handbook, a special edition of Forrest J Ackerman's Famous Monsters of Filmland magazine series. In 1967, Smith provided special make-up for two episodes of the vampire soap opera Dark Shadows; in the storyline, vampire Barnabas Collins (then played by Jonathan Frid) was undergoing medical treatment to change him into a living human being. The experiment goes drastically wrong, and Barnabas ages rapidly, to the appearance of a man over 175 years old. Smith said that designing the make-up appliances for Dark Shadows \\"turned out to be valuable preparation for Little Big Man.\\" Film work (late 1960s‚Äì1975) In the film Little Big Man (1970), the 30-something Dustin Hoffman played a White American man - who had also lived with a Native American tribe, in extreme old age at several points in the film [ similar, and with a very similar makeup design, to his making the 40-something actor Jonathan Frid look extremely old ( 175 years ) in the film 'House of Dark Shadows' ( MGM, also 1970, ) follow-up to T.V.'s \\"Dark Shadows\\" ( see paragraph 5 in \\"Early career in television,\\" above. ) ] \\"In the original book of Little Big Man, Dustin's character is 110,\\" Smith observed \\"but the director Arthur Penn just said out of the blue one day: 'Lets make him 121 instead'. I worked six weeks on the old age make-up, using photographic references for every wrinkle.‚Äù Smith also consulted Australian make-up artist Roy Ashton, having seen his work on the British horror film The Man Who Could Cheat Death (1959), in which Anton Diffring was made to appear of extreme old age. p. 50 Smith had to use other methods, as an alternative to prosthetics, to create an aged Don Corleone in The Godfather (1972) because Marlon Brando was unwilling to have such appliances applied because of time considerations. Instead, Smith used stipple effects moving across the face from the actor's eyes.Harlan Lebo The Godfather Legacy: The Untold Story of the Making of the Classic Godfather Trilogy, New York: Fireside, 2005, p.85 A dental device called a \\"plumper\\" caused Brando's jowls to droop. To depict the bleeding of characters after they had been shot, Smith said he \\"created the first ever bleeding special effects in this movie by creating bladders that were hidden under a foam latex forehead, with a squib that detonated the bladder, allowing blood to pour through a pre-arranged hole in the middle of the forehead.\\" Smith was also one of the early pioneers of combining make-up with on-set \\"practical\\" special effects, beginning with The Exorcist (1973).Lee Gamblin: A Personal Tribute to Make-up Legend Dick Smith , Fangoria, 16 January 2015 Smith's expertise gained prominence and acclaim through the variety and ingenuity of his many effects for The Exorcist. \\"The Exorcist was really a turning point for make-up special effects,\\" Rick Baker told The Washington Post in 2007. \\"Dick showed that makeup wasn't just about making people look scary or old, but had many applications. He figured out a way to make the welts swell up on Linda [Blair]'s stomach, to make her head spin around, and he created the vomit scenes.\\" For the head spinning effect, Smith created a mechanical dummy.Valerie J. Nelson \\"Dick Smith dies at 92; 'Exorcist' makeup man won Oscar for 'Amadeus'\\", Los Angeles Times, 31 July 2014 Film work (1975‚Äì1989) Smith also created the make-up for Robert De Niro's Travis Bickle character in Taxi Driver (1976), as well as creating the effects for the blood-drenched finale. Smith and Paul LeBlanc won an Academy Award for Best Makeup for their work on Amadeus (1984). Once again, he had to age a leading actor in the film. For the film he transformed the 44-year-old F.

It was named for the Philippine national flower, sampaguita. Though no longer functioning, the company's Sampaguita Compound remains in Quezon City. History Sampaguita Pictures was established in the last quarter of 1937. Its first feature-length film was Bituing Marikit, starring Elsa Oria and Rogelio dela Rosa. It was a box-office hit. The company continued to make films in the action, musical, horror and suspense genres. Before World War II began, and the Japanese occupied the Philippines, several Sampaguita films enjoyed box office success in the region. Some of them employed the famous tandem of Carmen Rosales and Rogelio dela Rosa, like Panambitan, Pagsuyo, Jazmin and many more. But the first film made at the Sampaguita studio by Carmen and Rogelio was Takipsilim. After the war ended and the Philippines declares its independence from the United States, Sampaguita made several war pictures in 1946, including Guerilyera, with Carmen and newcomer Celso Baltazar, Maynila, the comeback picture of Corazon Noble featuring Tita Duran, and Isumpa mo Giliw, with husband-and-wife team Angel Esmeralda and Corazon Noble. After several war musicals became popular, the studio created a new star team with real husband and wife Pancho Magalona and Tita Duran. They made several hits including Bulaklak na Walang Pangalan, Huwag Ka ng Magtampo, Sa Isang Sulyap mo Tita, and Sa Isang Halik mo Pancho. In 1950, the studios were hit by fire and hundreds of film prints were destroyed. But in 1951, they top-billed the unknown Tessie Agana, the daughter of Linda Estrella, in her first lead role in Roberta, with another child actor Boy Alano and the movie was one of the biggest hits of the year. In the early fifties several actors appeared in the studio's productions, including Alicia Vergel and her husband C√©sar Ram√≠rez in Ukkala, Diwani, the Philippine folk hero Bernardo Carpio, MN and many more. In 1952 the half-Filipino half-American Gloria Romero made her first full-length movie as the partner of Cesar Ramirez in an action costume picture Palasig. Another famous husband-and-wife team were Rita Gomez and Ric Rodrigo. They were popular together in their movie Diyosa. The infamous tandem of husband- and-wife Lolita Rodriguez and Eddie Arenas made some dramas together, like Kundiman ng Puso, Busabos, Cicatriz and Mapait na Lihim. The two later divorced. Arenas is still active in Philippine cinema while Rodriguez moved to the United States. Another husband-and-wife team in the 1950s were Amalia Fuentes and Romeo Vasquez. Fuentes made her last appearance for Sampaguita in 1964, before leaving for another studio. Though not as well remembered, many supporting actors and actresses, such as Imelda Concepcion and Nelly Baylon worked in the Sampaguita system. Susan Roces took her first lead role as a boxer in Sabungera opposite Luis Gonzales, but the movie was not a box office hit. Fuentes and Roces are famous for their rivalry when they made the movie Cover Girls in the 1960s. By that time, a new manager, Dr. Jose R. Perez, took over the reins of Sampaguita. In 1960, Sampaguita made Pitong Pagsisi supported by 20 Sampaguita stars, including the return of Paraluman who reigned in the studio in the late 40s. In 1970s, the studio continued producing movies albeit on a limited production, especially with the Nora Aunor-Tirso Cruz III tandem culminating in the 1971 movie Guy and Pip. In 1982, Sampaguita Pictures stopped releasing movies (together with its rival LVN Pictures) after its last successful movie Batch '81. However, its post- production facilities remained in operation until 2005. In 1995, the company ventured into television with GMA Network; they produced the drama anthology series Pira-pirasong Pangarap which lasted until 2003, which started another co-production Nagmamahal, Manay Gina. Both series were hosted by Gina de Venecia. Unitel Pictures currently owns Sampaguita's film library. All of the films are currently archived and handled by the ABS-CBN Film Archives and the Film Development Council of the Philippines' National Film Archives of the Philippines.

He was the Korpsf√ºhrer (Corps Leader) of the National Socialist Motor Corps (NSKK) from 1931 until his death in 1942. Biography H√ºhnlein was born in Neust√§dtlein, Upper Franconia the son of a teacher. He married his wife Paula (nee D√§umling) in 1906 and the couple had three daughters, one of whom died in infancy. He served in World War I, obtaining the rank of major. He had been decorated with the Iron Cross Second Class and First Class. After the war, he was a company commander in the Freikorps Epp from 1919 to 1920. He first heard Adolf Hitler speak in the barracks of the Bavarian Life Guard Regiment in 1919. He was a member of Ernst R√∂hm's anti-Semitic nationalist Bund Reichskriegsflagge (Imperial War Flag Society) until 1923. He was involved in the Beer Hall Putsch‚Äîthe unsuccessful attempt by Hitler and the NSDAP to seize power in Munich on 9 November 1923. He was held in investigative detention from November 1923 to March 1924 at Stadelheim, Neudeck and Landsberg Prison. He was discharged from the Reichswehr in March 1924, and was sentenced to six months' incarceration at Landsberg for his role in the unsuccessful Putsch. There he joined Hitler and other conspirators. This event would set H√ºhnlein on a life of Nazi politics and he rose through the ranks after being released from prison. He joined the Nazi Party in 1930 and served in the Sturmabteilung (SA). Ernst R√∂hm appointed him an SA-Obergruppenf√ºhrer and by 1927, H√ºhnlein was head of the SA automotive engineering section. H√ºhnlein was then appointed the leader of the National Socialist Automobile Corps (NSAK), which was to serve as a motorized corps of the SA. Thereafter, H√ºhnlein suggested the name be changed to National Socialist Motor Corps (NSKK). The name change became official on 1 May 1931. It was a paramilitary organization with its own system of paramilitary ranks and the smallest of the Nazi Party organizations. Under H√ºhnlein's leadership, the NSKK membership rose rapidly, from 30,000 men in April 1933 to 350,000 in September 1933, after absorbing all of Germany's private motor clubs. By 1939, there were 500,000 NSKK members. The primary aim of the Corps was to educate its members in motoring skills and to transport NSDAP and SA officials/members. All race car drivers were required to become members of the NSKK. H√ºhnlein often presented the trophies at German Grand Prix races and made certain Nazi flags and bunting covered the victory tribunes. The most famous race car driver that had to answer to H√ºhnlein was Bernd Rosemeyer, who drove the Auto Union Silver Arrow. From 1935 onward, the NSKK also provided training for Panzer crews and drivers of the German Army. Through his relationship with H√ºhnlein, Heinz Guderian was able to ensure the training of Germany's future tank and truck drivers, approximately 187,000 of them in the years 1933 to 1939. H√ºhnlein was the NSKK Korpsf√ºhrer from 30 April 1933 until his death in Munich on 18 June 1942. In addition, on 8 September 1938 he was appointed Reichsleiter, the second highest political rank in the Nazi Party. He was posthumously awarded the Party's highest decoration, the German Order on 22 June 1942.

It was commissioned in 1985 by Greg Wyatt, sculptor-in-residence at the Cathedral. Description The sculpture depicts the struggle of good and evil, as well as a battle between the Archangel Michael and Satan. The sculpture also contains the Sun, the Moon, and several animals. Although it is called a fountain, there is currently no water on the site. A plaque at the base contains the following inscription: > Peace Fountain celebrates the triumph of Good over Evil, and sets before us > the world's opposing forces‚Äîviolence and harmony, light and darkness, life > and death‚Äîwhich God reconciles in his peace.When the fountain operates, four > courses of water cascade down the freedom pedestal into a maelstrom evoking > the primordial chaos of Earth. Foursquare around the base, flames of freedom > rise in witness to the future. Ascending from the pool, the freedom pedestal > is shaped like the double helix of DNA, the key molecule of life. Atop the > pedestal a giant crab reminds us of life's origins in sea and struggle. > Facing West, a somnolent Moon reflects tranquility from a joyous Sun smiling > to the East. The swirls encircling the heavenly bodies bespeak the larger > movements of the cosmos with which earthly life is continuous. Nine > giraffes‚Äîamong the most peaceable of animals‚Äînestle and prance about the > center.

St. Michael's sword is vanquishing his chief opponent, Satan, whose > decapitated figure plunges into the depths, his head dangling beneath the > crab's claw. Tucked away next to the Sun, a lion and lamb relax together in > the peace of God's kingdom, as foretold by the prophet Isaiah. The fountain is encircled by small bronze animals, sculpted by schoolchildren of a variety of ages, collectively called the Children‚Äôs Sculpture Garden.https://morningside-alliance.org/neighborhood/maa-tour/the-peace- fountain-at-cathedral-of-st-john-the-divine/ \\"Around the fountain‚Äôs basin are a series of small bronze animal sculptures created by K-12 students from New York City and tri-state area public, private, and parochial schools.

Early life and education He was born in Vestervig, Thy, Denmark as the son of captain Casimir Wilhelm von Scholten\\"Casimir Wilhelm von Scholten\\" (1752 - 1810) Personal Information at skeel.info and Catharina Elisabeth de Moldrup.Bricka, Biografisk, 257 Career As a young man, von Scholten joined the Danish army and in 1803 he was appointed ensign in a unit stationed in the West Indies. He was transported to Great Britain when this country occupied the Danish West Indies, probably in 1807. Peter von Scholten married Anne Elisabeth Thortsen, daughter of Danish army captain Johan Thortsen, on October 31, 1810. Later, he had a career as an officer in Copenhagen, first as a second lieutenant in the Det Sj√¶llandske J√¶gerkorps (a Danish Jaeger or rifle regiment) in 1808, promoted to premier lieutenant in 1811, he reached the rank of staff captain in 1813. This ledhis becoming adjutant for Frederick VI of Denmark's general adjudant Frants Cristopher B√ºlow. He served in this role until 1814 when British occupation of the Danish West Indies ended, and he got his first official position on St. Thomas, as customs toller. Peter von Scholten continued to advance in the Danish military, becoming major in 1816, lieutenant colonel in 1820, commander of Dannebrog in 1828, and major general in 1829. In 1827, he became acting governor general of St. Thomas. From 1835 to 1848, he served as governor general for all three islands, Saint Thomas, Saint Croix, and Saint John, giving him overall command of the islands. During this period he showed himself a patriarchal administrator trying to lighten the burden of the slaves and to restrain racial tensions. He did this by creating schools for the black population, as well as permitting them private ownership.Bricka, Biografisk, 258 (Picture of ruins of Von Scholten school, St. Croix.) In spite of his relatively liberal attitudes, von Scholten was opposed to Christian VIII of Denmark's ruling that every child born of an unfree woman should be free from birth, as he felt that such an arrangement would cause discontent with serious consequences. When the new policy was brought into effect, he felt himself proven right as a slave rebellion broke out on St. Croix in 1848. Peter von Scholten responded by, on 3 July 1848, emancipating all slaves in the Danish West Indian Islands. Late years in Denmark and Altona Shortly thereafter, von Scholten was called back to Denmark. There, a humiliating and hard trial was brought against him, and he was at first denied his pension, although he was later cleared of the charges and acquitted shortly before his death. Von Scholten was the last governor general of the West Indies because of the beginning democratisation of the Danish state and colonial administration. Peter von Scholten died on 26 January 1854 in Altona, Holstein (present day Germany), leaving little to his heirs. His fate has inspired several authors. A movie about his last years as a governor general was made in 1987.IMDB: Peter von Scholten https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0089803/ Personal life During his early years on St. Thomas, von Scholten enjoyed a wealthy lifestyle due to his position as customs officer during the surge in trade under the state of war between the nearby Spanish islands and the South American colonial insurgents. He later gained promotion to the position of Governor based on St. Croix. At this time, Peter von Scholten lived with Anna Heegaard (1790‚Äì1859), a woman of color. The consensus amongst modern scholars is that Anna Heegaard influenced von Scholten into a policy of more humane treatment of the black population.Anita Davis ::: Published ArticlesCaribbean Writer On Line BOOK REVIEW - The Governor-General's LadyIsaac Dookhan, History of the Virgin Islands, page 173. Von Scholten's brother Frederik also served on the West Indian Islands. Belvedere, von Scholten's former country house in Klampenborg, north of Copenhagen Peter von Scholten married Anna Elizabeth (Lise) Thortsen in Copenhagen in 1810. The couple had three daughters. He owned a property at Bredgade 45 in Copenhagen from 1831 to 1849. After his return to Denmark he acquired the country house Belvedere in Klampenborg on the coast north of Copenhagen. Peter von Scholten is buried in Assistens Cemetery in Copenhagen. Cultural references Peter von Scholten is portrayed in the Danish 1987 drama film Peter von Scholten.

Measuring high and long, it is the longest wooden trestle in the Pacific Northwest. The trestle carries a single track of the BNSF Railway's Woodinville Subdivision line over a valley that used to be an extension of Lake Washington. The line runs approximately from Renton in the south to Snohomish in the north. Before the abandonment of the rail line by BNSF, freight trains ran six days a week, including those carrying Boeing's aircraft fuselages to its assembly plant in Renton. It was also used daily by the popular Spirit of Washington Dinner Train, but this service ceased at the end of June 2007. The trestle was originally completed in 1904How the Bellevue years go by, Seattle Times, March 25, 2003. Accessed online 2009-10-16. as part of the Northern Pacific Railway's Lake Washington Belt Line from Black River Junction (south of Seattle) to Woodinville. It was subsequently rebuilt four separate times, in 1913, 1924, 1934, and 1943, due to deterioration of the timber. In 1974, a road, the Lake Hills Connector, was cut through the trestle, replacing a short section with a concrete and steel structure. Wilburton Trestle saw its last regularly scheduled passenger trains in July 1922. Several Casey Jones excursion trains crossed the trestle in the 1950s and 1960s, and a dinner train operation between Renton and Woodinville ran for several years in the 1990s. The trestle is a distinctive landmark noticed by travelers on Interstate 405 through Bellevue. While it is believed that this is the trestle pictured in the 1963 Elvis Presley movie It Happened at the World's Fair, further evidence indicates that that trestle was over the White River between Enumclaw and Buckley.Key to the City's profile of Buckley The history blurb on this page was written before the White River trestle was demolished. Wilburton Trestle should not be confused with Wilburton Tunnel, which was a tunnel for the southbound lanes of I-405 under the railroad.

Bordeleau continued in the same role the next season, but saw less playing time in 2000‚Äì01. In the latter stages of the 2000‚Äì01 season, Bordeleau was claimed on waivers by the St. Louis Blues, yet saw only limited action with the club's AHL affiliate in Worcester before being claimed in the 2001 Waiver Draft by the Minnesota Wild. Upon his arrival with the Wild, Bordeleau went on to split his time between the parent club and their AHL affiliate in Houston before being dealt to the Phoenix Coyotes prior to the midway point of the season. Bordeleau went on to play six games with the Coyotes, while seeing most of his action with the club's AHL affiliate in Springfield, before opting to head overseas for the 2002‚Äì03 season. After competing for seven years in North America, Bordeleau made his debut for SC Bern in the Swiss National League in 2002‚Äì03. International play Bordeleau represented France at the 2004 World Championships in Prague, Czech Republic, and at the 2008 World Championships in Quebec City, Canada.

Devised in the 1920s by Rudolf Steiner (1861‚Äì1925) in conjunction with Ita Wegman (1876‚Äì1943), anthroposophical medicine is based on occult notions and draws on Steiner's spiritual philosophy, which he called anthroposophy. Practitioners employ a variety of treatment techniques based upon anthroposophic precepts, including massage, exercise, counselling, and substances. Many drug preparations used in anthroposophic medicine are ultra- diluted substances, similar to those used in homeopathy. Homeopathic remedies are not medically effective and are generally considered harmless, except when used as a substitute for a scientifically proven and effective cure. In certain European countries, people with cancer are sometimes prescribed remedies made from specially harvested mistletoe, but research has found no convincing evidence of clinical benefit. Some anthroposophic doctors oppose childhood vaccination, and this has led to preventable outbreaks of disease. Anthroposophic medicine departs from fundamental biological principles in several respects. For example, Steiner said that the heart does not pump blood but that blood propels itself along. Anthroposophic medicine also proposes that patients' past lives may influence their illness and that the course of an illness is subject to karmic destiny. Professor of complementary medicine Edzard Ernst and other physicians and scientists including Simon Singh and David Gorski have characterized anthroposophic medicine as pseudoscientific quackery with no basis in reason or logic. Background=History Ita Wegman, co-founder of the medical approach, before 1900 in Berlin. The first steps towards an anthroposophic approach to medicine were made before 1920, when homeopathic physicians and pharmacists began working with Rudolf Steiner, who recommended new medicinal substances as well as specific methods for preparation along with an anthroposophic concept of man. In 1921, Ita Wegman opened the first anthroposophic medical clinic, now known as the Klinik Arlesheim,Ita Wegman Klinik (German). Accessed 2007-12-26. in Arlesheim, Switzerland. Wegman was soon joined by a number of other doctors. They then began to train the first anthroposophic nurses for the clinic. At Wegman's request, Steiner regularly visited the clinic and suggested treatment regimes for particular patients. Between 1920 and 1925, he also gave several series of lectures on medicine. In 1925, Wegman and Steiner wrote the first book on the anthroposophic approach to medicine, Fundamentals of Therapy. Wegman later opened a separate clinic and curative home in Ascona. Wegman lectured widely, visiting the Netherlands and England particularly frequently, and an increasing number of doctors began to include the anthroposophic approach in their practices. A cancer clinic, the Lukas Clinic, opened in Arlesheim in 1963.Lukas Clinic . Accessed 2007-12-26. In 1976 anthroposophic medicine in Germany got regulated by law as a specific therapeutic system (\\"Besondere Therapierichtung\\") by the Medicines Act-Arzneimittelgesetz (AMG) and by the Code of Social Law (Sozialgesetzbuch V) In the 1990s the Witten/Herdecke University in Germany established a chair in anthroposophical medicine. The press described the appointment as a \\"death sentence\\" and the perception that pseudoscience was being taught damaged the university's reputation, bringing it close to financial collapse. It was ultimately saved by a cash injection from Software AG, a technology corporation with a history of funding anthroposophic projects. In 2006, anthroposophical medicine was practised in 80 countries. In 2012 the University of Aberdeen considered establishing a chair in holistic health jointly funded by Software AG, and by the Anthroposophic Health, Education, and Social Care Movement, each of which would provide ¬£1.5 million of endowment. Edzard Ernst commented \\"that any decent university should even consider an anthroposophical medicine unit seems incomprehensible. The fact that it would be backed by people who have a financial interest in this bogus approach makes it even worse.\\" The University's governance and nominations committee eventually decided not to proceed with the appointment. Categorization and conceptual basis The categorization of anthroposophical medicine is complex since in part it complements conventional medicine, and in part it substitutes for it. Cited in In 2008, Ernst wrote that it was being promoted as an \\"extension to conventional medicine\\". Ernst writes that Steiner used imagination and insight as a basis for his ideas, drawing mystical knowledge from the occult Akashic Records, a work which is supposedly situated on the astral plane, and which Steiner said was accessible to him via his intuitive powers. On this basis, Steiner proposed \\"associations between four postulated dimensions of the human body (physical body, etheric body, astral body, and ego), plants, minerals, and the cosmos\\". Steiner also proposed a connection betweens planets, metals and organs so that, for example, the planet Mercury, the element mercury and the lung were all somehow associated. These propositions form the basis of anthroposophical medicine. Ernst has said that anthroposophical medicine \\"includes some of the least plausible theories one could possibly imagine\\", categorized it as \\"pure quackery\\", and said that it \\"has no basis in science\\". According to Quackwatch, anthroposophical medicine practitioners regard illness as a \\"rite of passage\\" necessary to purge spiritual impurities carried over from past lives, according to the precepts of \\"karmic destiny\\". Methods In anthroposophic pharmacy, drugs are prepared according to ancient notions of alchemy and homeopathy which are not related to the science underlying modern pharmacology. During the preparation process, patterns formed by crystallization are interpreted to see which \\"etheric force\\" they most closely resemble. Most anthroposophic preparations are highly diluted, like homeopathic remedies. This means that, while they are completely harmless in themselves, using them in place of conventional medicine to treat serious illness carries a risk of severe adverse consequences. As well as drug remedies, anthroposophical medicine also includes: * Anthroposophic nursing * Counselling * Eurythmy - claimed to have an effect on \\"inner life functions\\" leading to a \\"re-integration of body, soul, and spirit\\". * External applications * Rhythmic massages Plant-derived treatments To select an anthroposophic substance for a particular illness, practitioners consider the source of the substances used. The character of a mineral, plant or animal is hypothesised to have been formed by the substances that are most active within it, in the belief that this character may also influence what the substance will accomplish when given to treat another organism. This is related to Samuel Hahnemann's Doctrine of signatures. Willow, for example, is considered to have an unusual character: There is no scientific evidence that the shape of plants has ever caused a new medical property to be discovered. Beliefs about human biology Steiner described the heart not as a pump, but as a regulator of flow, such that the heartbeat itself can be distinguished from the circulation of blood. William T. Jarvis Anthroposophical Medicine Anthroposophic medicine claims the flow in the blood of the circulatory system is, as Marinelli put it, \\"propelled with its own biological momentum, as can be seen in the embryo, and boosts itself with induced momenta from the heart\\".Marinelli, R., Fuerst, B., et al. \\"The Heart is not a Pump: A refutation of the pressure propulsion premise of heart function\\", Frontier Perspectives 5(1), Fall-Winter 1995 This view of the heart is not based on any scientific theory and has been characterized as \\"crank science\\". Steiner believed that the sex of a baby was determined at the moment of conception by the alignment of the stars. Steiner's model of anatomy was based on a three- part notion, whereby the head is the thinking part, the abdomen and limbs the \\"metabolic\\" part, and the chest and heart a \\"rhythmic center\\". Mistletoe treatment for cancer alt=Mistletoe growing on a tree, showing white berries in medium close-up Rudolf Steiner hypothesised that mistletoe could cure cancer, on the basis of the observation that the plant was a parasite which eventually killed its host, a process which he claimed paralleled the progression of cancer. Steiner believed the plant's medical potential was influenced by the position of the sun, moon and planets and that it therefore was important to harvest the plant at the right time. Some mistletoe preparations are ultra-diluted; others are made from fermented mistletoe. The most commonly used trade names for mistletoe drugs are Iscador and Helixor. Although laboratory experiments have suggested that mistletoe extract may affect the immune system and be able to kill some kinds of cancer cells, there is little evidence of its benefit to people with cancer. Most of the clinical research claiming that mistletoe therapy is effective is published in Germany, and it is generally considered unreliable because of major lapses in quality. Edzard Ernst wrote that research by anthroposophic doctors often reached positive conclusions on mistletoe therapy because it drew on unreliable material; independent researchers tended instead to find no evidence of benefit. The American Cancer Society says that \\"available evidence from well- designed clinical trials does not support claims that mistletoe can improve length or quality of life\\". Mistletoe-based cancer drugs are widely used in Europe, especially in German-speaking countries. In 2002 nearly half a million prescriptions were paid for by German health insurance and in 2006 there were reportedly around 30 types of mistletoe extract on the market. Mistletoe extracts have been used as an unconventional treatment for cancer patients in the Netherlands, and in Germany the treatment has been approved as palliative therapy to treat the symptoms of patients with malignant tumors. In Sweden, controversially, mistletoe therapy has been approved for use in the treatment of cancer symptoms.\\"Unique green light for anthroposophical drug\\", Svensk Farmaci In other countries mistletoe therapy is virtually unknown. The United States Food and Drug Administration has not approved mistletoe-based drugs for any purpose; mistletoe extracts may not be distributed in or imported into the US except for research purposes. no mistletoe-based drugs are licensed for use in the United Kingdom. A 2013 article on mistletoe in Lancet Oncology invoked Ben Goldacre's observation that a geographical preference for certain therapies was a hallmark of quackery, and proposed that the continuing use of this \\"apparently ineffectual therapy\\" in a small cluster of countries was based on sociological rather than medical reasons, indicating a need for a more informed consent from patients. Immunization The risks arising from using anthroposophical medicine as a substitute for evidence-based medicine are exemplified by several cases of low vaccination levels in Waldorf schools, since some anthroposophical doctors oppose immunization. A 1999 study of children in Sweden showed that in Waldorf schools, only 18% had received MMR vaccination, compared to a level of 93% in other schools nationally. A 2003 report of a widespread measles outbreak around Coburg, Germany, identified a Waldorf school as the origin. At the time the town's mayor had condemned homeopathic doctors who had discouraged vaccination, saying \\"Their stronghold is the Waldorf School, which actively encourages people not to have their children vaccinated. Now we have an epidemic.\\" Paul Offit wrote that Steiner believed vaccination \\"interferes with karmic development and the cycles of reincarnation\\", and that adherence to this belief led to a 2008 pertussis outbreak in a Californian Waldorf school, causing its temporary closure.

It was developed by Holistic Designs and published by Take-Two Interactive. It has two sequels: Mall Tycoon 2 (which also had a \\"Deluxe\\" extended edition) and Mall Tycoon 3. Gameplay The game begins with an empty plot of land upon which the player develops their mall. The player can build shops, customize decorations, organize special events such as fashion shows, and manage mall employees. It is important for the player to work out what is profitable and what is not to ensure the survival of the fledgling mall. The mall may become overrun with zombies or aliens which can be eradicated when the player calls upon the Men in Black. Development The game was developed by Holistic Design, creator of the Merchant Prince series. Reception In the United States, Mall Tycoon sold 420,000 copies and earned $7.6 million by August 2006, after its release in January 2002. It was the country's 36th best-selling computer game between January 2000 and August 2006. Combined sales of all Mall Tycoon series entries released between January 2000 and August 2006 had reached 820,000 units in the United States by the latter date. The game received \\"generally unfavorable\\" reviews, according to video game review score aggregator Metacritic. Computer Gaming World criticized the game for its wonky camera and frustrating interface. The magazine opined that even the poorly received Airport Tycoon is a better game than Mall Tycoon. Sequels=Mall Tycoon 2 Mall Tycoon 2 is a business simulation game, released in 2003. It is the sequel to Mall Tycoon, which allows the gamer to construct, expand and thereafter manage a shopping mall. It describes itself as the \\"Ultimate Mall Experience\\". The Mall is visited by many types of customers, from children to seniors. There are also criminals among the clientele, who should be caught by the mall's security guards, and visits by dogs, which indicates a low level of hygiene and security. Staff can be hired to perform these duties, such as janitors for cleaning floors, but some of the hiring specifications require background checks, which cost money and affect bottom line. The number of stores and the rating also affect the number of customers the mall gets. For every store, five people can fit into your shopping mall, and the higher the rating, the more people come to your mall. The game provides a wide variety of stores. They include electronics, clothing, food, entertainment, sports and services. Many of the more advanced stores need to be researched before they can be constructed. A player can build a mall atrium and arrange monthly events to promote the mall. Such promotions include car shows, a mall oasis and a circus. An \\"owner\\" also can build restaurants, movie theaters, bowling alleys and arcades to attract customers. As with hiring research, these new additions also must be researched and evaluated. Floors may be changed easily and can be customised. Wood is the most common flooring medium, but other types include a puzzle floor for the kids' area and tiles for the food court. Adding floors to the mall is expensive, but is a necessary investment when all vacant areas have been occupied and expanded to their limits. The Deluxe version of Mall Tycoon 2 adds certain scenarios, more customer types and other new features. Mall Tycoon 3 Mall Tycoon 3 is a business simulation game, released in 2005. It was developed by Cat Daddy Games and published by Global Star Software. It is the third and final installment in the Mall Tycoon series, after the original Mall Tycoon and Mall Tycoon 2. The game was released to mixed reviews, getting lower than the previous games. After selecting to play in sandbox mode, three starting locations are given. You may choose to build your mall in a neighborhood, a big city, or beside the beach. One may also choose to play a campaign game instead, and select from several different challenges. Interior view of mall in Career Mode Unlike in the previous installments of the series, Mall Tycoon 3 allows players to create customized stores. Over 40 types of stores of various types are available for placement in a pre-made store or a player may design their own, putting in everything from sale signs to the merchandise racks. Also customizable are the employees; their job capabilities and personal appearances are adjustable. In addition to regular in-line stores, there are also a handful of kiosks, such as one that sells cellular phones. In the first two Mall Tycoon games, stores were created by placing the set store size, and then adding a store to them. In Mall Tycoon 3, the player paints the floor to create a store, allowing for them to be of any shape or size. Mall Tycoon 3 features a total of 5 buildable mall levels.

It spans two floors and is near the M621 motorway. It takes its name from the White Rose of York, the traditional symbol of Yorkshire. The Upper Level houses the centre's food court as well some retail outlets. The centre has 4,800 free car parking spaces, security and on-site Police officers. Although the centre is smaller than other out-of-town shopping centres, it has attracted large retailers such as Next and Marks and Spencer. The centre opened on 25 March 1997 and accommodates major tenants including Sainsbury's, Debenhams, Marks and Spencer, Next, W H Smith, Topshop, Primark, Zara, H&M;, and over 100 other stores and services. The south part of the centre was re-developed in 2005 downsizing the Sainsbury's Savacentre to a regular Sainsbury's which made space for other units. The centre has a bus station at the north end of Debenhams connecting it to suburban areas of Leeds and to the city centre. To coincide with its tenth year of trading the White Rose Centre was rebranded. Its logo, advertising, signage and staff uniforms were redesigned. The branding and strategic marketing campaign won a BCSC Purple Apple award. The centre is managed and mainly by Land Securities and Evans of Leeds. It has also won awards including a British Council of Shopping Centre's (BCSC) Gold Award, BCSC Purple apple, and Green apple awards. Construction The site covers and was formerly the Morley Sewage works. Before building work began in 1995, enabling works including removing the sewage works, sealing disused mine shafts, removing contaminated soil and profiling the sloping site, were carried out. It required moving 750,000 cubic metres of soil to grade a 30-metre fall across the site and create level terraces for the structure and car parks. Work commenced on the 87-week project on 10 July 1995 and by September the first steelwork was visible. 600 semi-mature, seven-metre-high () trees were purchased from Germany and planted in the car park to provide landscaping. Five thousand trees and shrubs have been planted around the car parks and perimeter roads. Dining The Balcony Food Court takes up most of the upper floor in the central atrium. It includes McDonald's, KFC, Subway, Spud-u-like, Bagel Nash, Juice, Nando's, Frankie & Benny's and Pizza Express plus a number of other food outlets In 2015 the White Rose extended the entrance to the upper level between car park 4 and 5 which created 3 new restaurants which have changed since opening. The Balcony leads to a newly constructed area of the centre known as The Village. This includes further eateries namely Pizza Hut, Five Guys, Limeyard, Wagamama, Chiquito and TGI Friday's. Community The White Rose Centre is involved in a number of social welfare activities in the local area. Older people are able to participate in mall walking within the covered environment. It houses the White Rose Learning Centre run in conjunction with Education Leeds and Leeds City College to provide dance classes and other educational activities for children at risk of exclusion from school in an informal environment. The Quiet Room in the Upper Circle is available for use by all patrons and staff during the Centre opening hours. Criticisms One criticism of the centre is the width of the malls which are narrow. Another criticism is the lack of a railway station, despite the centre's proximity to the Huddersfield and Wakefield railway lines, but plans to add a station have been developed. Extension In 2015 the White Rose extended the entrance to the upper level between car park 4 and 5 which created 3 new restaurants as well leading to the balcony and a new entrance to what will be the village later on. In 2017 a ¬£25 million extension was completed and named 'The Village'. It included an 11 screen IMAX Cineworld Cinema, and new restaurants, Pizza Hut, Chiquito, Wagamama, Five Guys, Limeyard and TGI Friday's. A children's outdoor play area opened in 'The Village' in 2018.

One of the first scientists to bring statistical methods to the analysis of oceanographic data, Munk is noted for creating fruitful areas of research that continue to be explored by other scientists. Munk's work garnered him many prestigious awards including the National Medal of Science, the Kyoto Prize, and induction to the French Legion of Honour. Munk worked on a wide range of topics, including surface waves, geophysical implications of variations in the Earth's rotation, tides, internal waves, deep-ocean drilling into the sea floor, acoustical measurements of ocean properties, sea level rise, and climate change. Beginning in 1975, Munk and Carl Wunsch developed ocean acoustic tomography, to exploit the ease with which sound travels in the ocean and use acoustical signals for measurement of broad-scale temperature and current. In a 1991 experiment, Munk and his collaborators investigated the ability of underwater sound to propagate from the Southern Indian Ocean across all ocean basins. The aim was to measure global ocean temperature. The experiment was criticized by environmental groups, who expected that the loud acoustic signals would adversely affect marine life. Munk continued to develop and advocate for acoustical measurements of the ocean throughout his career. Munk's career began before the outbreak of World War II and ended nearly 80 years later with his death in 2019. The war interrupted his doctoral studies at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography (Scripps), and led to his participation in U.S. military research efforts. Munk and his doctoral advisor Harald Sverdrup developed methods for forecasting wave conditions which were used in support of beach landings in all theaters of the war. He was involved with oceanographic programs during the atomic bomb tests in Bikini Atoll. For most of his career, he was a professor of geophysics at Scripps at the University of California in La Jolla. Additionally, Munk and his wife Judy were active in developing the Scripps campus and integrating it with the new University of California, San Diego. Munk's career included a number of prestigious positions, including being a member of the JASON think tank, and holding the Secretary of the Navy/Chief of Naval Operations Oceanography Chair.  Early life and education  In 1917, Munk was born to a Jewish family in Vienna, Austria-Hungary. His father, Dr. Hans Munk, and his mother, Rega Brunner, divorced when he was ten years old. His maternal grandfather was Lucian Brunner (1850‚Äì1914), a prominent banker and Austrian politician. His stepfather, Dr. Rudolf Engelsberg, was head of the salt mine monopoly of the Austrian government and a member of the Austrian governments of Chancellor Engelbert Dollfuss and Chancellor Kurt Schuschnigg. In 1932, Munk was performing poorly in school because he was spending too much time skiing, so his family sent him from Austria to a boys' preparatory school in upper New York state. His family envisioned a career for him in finance with a New York bank connected to the family business. He worked at the family's banking firm for three years and studied at Columbia University. Munk hated banking. In 1937, he left the firm to attend the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) in Pasadena. While at Caltech, he took a summer job in 1939 at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography (Scripps) in La Jolla, California. Munk earned a B.S. in applied physics in 1939 and an M.S. in geophysics (under Beno Gutenberg) in 1940 at Caltech. The master's degree work was based on oceanographic data collected in the Gulf of California by the Norwegian oceanographer Harald Sverdrup, then director of Scripps. In 1939, Munk asked Sverdrup to take him on as a doctoral student. Sverdrup agreed, although Munk recalled him saying \\"I can't think of a single job that's going to become available in the next ten years in oceanography\\". Munk's studies were interrupted by the outbreak of World War II. He completed his doctoral degree in oceanography at Scripps under the University of California, Los Angeles in 1947. He wrote it in three weeks and it is the \\"shortest Scripps dissertation on record.\\" He later realized that its principal conclusion is wrong.  Wartime activities  In 1940, Munk enlisted the U.S. Army. This was unusual for a student at Scripps: all the others joined the U.S. Naval Reserve. After serving 18 months in Field Artillery and the Ski Troops, he was discharged at the request of Sverdrup and Roger Revelle so he could undertake defense-related research at Scripps. In December 1941, a week before the Japanese Attack on Pearl Harbor, he joined several of his colleagues from Scripps at the U.S. Navy Radio and Sound Laboratory. For six years they developed methods related to antisubmarine and amphibious warfare. This research involved marine acoustics, and eventually led to his work on ocean acoustic tomography. Predicting surf conditions for Allied landings In 1943, Munk and Sverdrup began looking for a way to predict the heights of ocean surface waves. The Allies were preparing for a landing in North Africa, where two out of every three days the waves are above six feet. Practice beach landings in the Carolinas were suspended when waves reached this height because they were dangerous to people and landing craft. Munk and Sverdrup found an empirical law that related wave height and period to the speed and duration of the wind and the distance over which it blows. The Allies applied this method in the Pacific theater of war and the Normandy invasion on D-Day. Officials at the time estimated that many lives were saved by these predictions. Munk commented in 2009: Oceanographic measurements during atomic weapons tests in the Pacific In 1946, the United States tested two fission nuclear weapons (20 kilotons) at Bikini Atoll in the equatorial Pacific in Operation Crossroads. Munk helped to determine the currents, diffusion, and water exchanges affecting the radiation contamination from the second test, code-named Baker. Six years later he returned to the equatorial Pacific for the 1952 test of the first fusion nuclear weapon (10 megatons) at Eniwetok Atoll, code-named Ivy Mike. Roger Revelle, John Isaacs, and Munk had initiated a program for monitoring for the possibility of a large tsunami generated from the test. Later association with the military Munk continued to have a close association with the military in later decades. He was one of the first academics to be funded by the Office of Naval Research, and had his last grant from them when he was 97. In 1968, he became a member of JASON, a panel of scientists who advise the Pentagon, and he continued in that role until the end of his life. He held a Secretary of the Navy/Chief of Naval Operations Oceanography Chair from 1985 until his death in 2019. The Institute of Geophysics and Planetary Physics in La Jolla After receiving his doctorate in 1947, Munk was hired by Scripps as an assistant professor of geophysics. He became a full professor there in 1954, but his appointment was at the Institute of Geophysics (IGP) at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). In 1955, Munk took a sabbatical at Cambridge, England. His experience at Cambridge led to the idea of starting a new IGP branch at Scripps. At the time of Munk's return to Scripps, it was still under the administration of UCLA, as it had been since 1938. It became part of the University of California, San Diego (UCSD) when that campus was founded in 1958. Revelle, its director at the time, was a primary advocate for establishing the La Jolla campus. At this time Munk was considering offers for new positions at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Harvard University, but Revelle encouraged Munk to remain in La Jolla. Munk's founding of IGP at La Jolla was concurrent with the creation of the UCSD campus. The IGPP laboratory was built between 1959 and 1963 with funding from the University of California, the U.S. Air Force Office of Scientific Research, the National Science Foundation, and private foundations. (After planetary physics was added, IGP changed its name to the Institute of Geophysics and Planetary Physics (IGPP).) The redwood building was designed by architect Lloyd Ruocco, in close consultation with Judith and Walter Munk. The IGPP buildings have become the center of the Scripps campus. Among the early faculty appointments were Carl Eckart, George Backus, Freeman Gilbert and John Miles. The eminent geophysicist Sir Edward \\"Teddy\\" Bullard was a regular visitor to IGPP. In 1971 an endowment of $600,000 was established by Cecil Green to support visiting scholars, now known as Green Scholars. Munk served as director of IGPP/LJ from 1962 to 1982. In the late 1980s, plans for an expansion of IGPP were developed by Judith and Walter Munk, and Sharyn and John Orcutt, in consultation with a local architect, Fred Liebhardt. The Revelle Laboratory was completed in 1993. At this time the original IGPP building was renamed the Walter and Judith Munk Laboratory for Geophysics. In 1994 the Scripps branch of IGPP was renamed the Cecil H. and Ida M. Green Institute of Geophysics and Planetary Physics. Research Munk's career in oceanography and geophysics touched on disparate and innovative topics. A pattern of Munk's work was that he would initiate a completely new topic; ask challenging, fundamental questions about the subject and its larger meaning; and then, having created an entirely new sub-field of science, move on to another new topic. As Carl Wunsch, one of Munk's frequent collaborators, commented: Wind-driven gyres The five major ocean gyres. In 1948, Munk took a year's sabbatical to visit Sverdrup in Oslo, Norway on his first Guggenheim Fellowship. He worked on the problem of wind-driven ocean circulation, obtaining the first comprehensive solution for currents based on observed wind patterns. This included two types of friction: horizontal friction between water masses moving at different velocities or between water and the edges of the oceanic basin, and friction from a vertical velocity gradient in the top layer of the ocean (the Ekman layer). The model predicted the five main ocean gyres (pictured), with rapid, narrow currents in the west flowing towards the poles and broader, slower currents in the east flowing away from the poles. Munk coined the term \\"ocean gyres,\\" a term now widely used. The currents predicted for the western boundaries (e.g., for the Gulf Stream and the Kuroshio Current) were about half of the accepted values at the time, but those only considered the most intense flow and neglected a large return flow. Later estimates agreed well with Munk's predictions. Rotation of the Earth In the 1950s, Munk investigated irregularities in the Earth's rotation ‚Äì changes in the length of day (rate of the Earth's rotation) and changes in the axis of rotation (such as the Chandler wobble, which has a period of about 14 months). The latter gives rise to a small tide called the pole tide. Although the scientific community knew of these fluctuations, they did not have adequate explanations for them. With Gordon J. F. MacDonald, Munk published The Rotation of the Earth: A Geophysical Discussion in 1960. This book discusses the effects from a geophysical, rather than astronomical, perspective. It shows that short-term variations are caused by movement in the atmosphere, ocean, underground water, and interior of the Earth, including tides in the ocean and solid Earth. Over longer times (a century or more), the largest influence is the tidal acceleration that causes the Moon to move away from the Earth at about four centimeters per year. This gradually slows Earth's rotation, so that over 500 million years the length of day has increased from 21 hours to 24. The monograph remains a standard reference.  Project Mohole  Project Mohole contracted with a consortium of oil companies to use their oil drillship CUSS I. In 1957, Munk and Harry Hess suggested the idea behind Project Mohole: to drill into the Mohoroviƒçiƒá discontinuity and obtain a sample of the Earth's mantle. While such a project was not feasible on land, drilling in the open ocean would be more feasible, because the mantle is much closer to the sea floor. Initially led by the informal group of scientists known as the American Miscellaneous Society (AMSOC), a group that included Hess, Maurice Ewing, and Roger Revelle, the project was eventually taken over by the National Science Foundation. Initial test drillings into the sea floor led by Willard Bascom occurred off Guadalupe Island, Mexico in March and April 1961. However, the project was mismanaged and grew in expense after the construction company Brown and Root won the contract to continue the effort. Toward the end of 1966, Congress discontinued the project. While Project Mohole was not successful, the idea and its innovative initial phase directly led to the successful NSF Deep Sea Drilling Program for obtaining sediment cores.  Ocean swell  Munk used R/P FLIP to measure waves traveling across ocean basins. Starting in the late 1950s, Munk returned to the study of ocean waves. Thanks to his acquaintance with John Tukey, he pioneered the use of power spectra in describing wave behavior. This work culminated with an expedition that he led in 1963 called \\"Waves Across the Pacific\\" to observe waves generated by storms in the Southern Indian Ocean. Such waves traveled northward for thousands of miles across the Pacific Ocean. To trace the path and decay of the waves, he established measurement stations on islands and at sea (on R/P FLIP) along a great circle from New Zealand, to the Palmyra Atoll, and finally to Alaska. Munk and his family spent nearly the whole of 1963 on American Samoa for this experiment. Walter and Judith Munk collaborated in making a film to document the experiment. The results show little decay of wave energy with distance traveled. This work, together with the wartime work on wave forecasting, led to the science of surf forecasting, one of Munk's best-known accomplishments. Munk's pioneering research into surf forecasting was acknowledged in 2007 with an award from the Groundswell Society, a surfing advocacy organization.  Ocean tides  Between 1965 and 1975, Munk turned to investigations of ocean tides, partly motivated by their effects on the Earth's rotation. Modern methods of time series and spectral analysis were brought to bear on tidal analysis, leading to work with David Cartwright developing the \\"response method\\" of tidal analysis. With Frank Snodgrass, Munk developed deep-ocean pressure sensors that could be used to provide tidal data far from any land. One highlight of this work was the discovery of the semidiurnal amphidrome midway between California and Hawaii. Internal waves: The Garrett-Munk Spectrum At the time of Munk's dissertation for his master's degree in 1939, internal waves were considered an uncommon phenomenon. By the 1970s, there were extensive published observations of internal-wave variability in the oceans in temperature, salinity, and velocity as functions of time, horizontal distance, and depth. Motivated by a 1958 paper by Owen Philips that described a universal spectral form for the variance of ocean surface waves as a function of wave number, Chris Garrett and Munk attempted to make sense of the observations by postulating a universal spectrum for internal waves. According to Munk, they chose a spectrum that could be factored into a function of frequency times a function of vertical wave number. The resulting spectrum, now called the Garrett-Munk Spectrum, is roughly consistent with a large number of diverse measurements that had been obtained over the global ocean. The model evolved over the subsequent decade, denoted GM72, GM75, GM79, etc., according to the year of publication of the revised model. Although Munk expected the model to be rapidly obsolete, it proved to be a universal model that is still in use. Its universality is interpreted as a sign of profound processes governing internal wave dynamics, turbulence and fine-scale mixing. Klaus Hasselmann commented in 2010, \\"...the publication of the GM spectrum has indeed been extremely fruitful for oceanography, both in the past and still today.\\"  Ocean acoustic tomography  Ocean topography (see scale) and some paths traveled by sound waves during the 1991 Heard Island Feasibility Test. Beginning in 1975, Munk and Carl Wunsch of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology pioneered the development of acoustic tomography of the ocean. With Peter Worcester and Robert Spindel, Munk developed the use of sound propagation, particularly sound arrival patterns and travel times, to infer important information about the ocean's large-scale temperature and current. This work, together with the work of other groups, eventually motivated the 1991 \\"Heard Island Feasibility Test\\" (HIFT), to determine if man-made acoustic signals could be transmitted over antipodal distances to measure the ocean's climate. The experiment came to be called \\"the sound heard around the world.\\" During six days in January 1991, acoustic signals were transmitted by sound sources lowered from the M/V Cory Chouest near Heard Island in the southern Indian Ocean. These signals traveled half-way around the globe to be received on the east and west coasts of the United States, as well as at many other stations around the world. The follow-up to this experiment was the 1996‚Äì2006 Acoustic Thermometry of Ocean Climate (ATOC) project in the North Pacific Ocean. Both HIFT and ATOC engendered considerable public controversy concerning the possible effects of man-made sounds on marine mammals. In addition to the decade-long measurements obtained in the North Pacific, acoustic thermometry has been employed to measure temperature changes of the upper layers of the Arctic Ocean basins, which continues to be an area of active interest. Acoustic thermometry has also been used to determine changes to global-scale ocean temperatures using data from acoustic pulses traveling from Australia to Bermuda. Tomography has come to be a valuable method of ocean observation, exploiting the characteristics of long-range acoustic propagation to obtain synoptic measurements of average ocean temperature or current. Applications have included the measurement of deep water formation in the Greenland Sea in 1989, measurement of ocean tides, and the estimation of ocean mesoscale dynamics by combining tomography, satellite altimetry, and in situ data with ocean dynamical models. Munk advocated for acoustical measurements of the ocean for much of his career, such as his 1986 Bakerian Lecture Acoustic Monitoring of Ocean Gyres, the 1995 monograph Ocean Acoustic Tomography written with Worcester and Wunsch, and his 2010 Crafoord Prize lecture The Sound of Climate Change.  Tides and mixing  In the 1990s, Munk returned to the work on the role of tides in producing mixing in the ocean. In a 1966 paper \\"Abyssal Recipes\\", Munk was one of the first to assess quantitatively the rate of mixing in the abyssal ocean in maintaining oceanic stratification. At that time, the tidal energy available for mixing was thought to occur by processes near ocean boundaries. According to Sandstr√∂m's theorem (1908), without the occurrence deep mixing, driven by, e.g., internal tides or tidally-driven turbulence in shallow regions, most of the ocean would become cold and stagnant, capped by a thin, warm surface layer. The question of tidal energy available for mixing was reawakened in the 1990s with the discovery, by acoustic tomography and satellite altimetry, of large-scale internal tides radiating energy away from the Hawaiian Ridge into the interior of the North Pacific Ocean. Munk recognized that the tidal energy from the scattering and radiation of large-scale internal waves from mid-ocean ridges was significant, hence it could drive abyssal mixing. Munk's enigma In his later work, Munk focused on the relation between changes in ocean temperature, sea level, and the transfer of mass between continental ice and the ocean. This work described what came to be known as \\"Munk's enigma\\", a large discrepancy between observed rate of sea level rise and its expected effects on the earth's rotation.  Awards  Munk in Stockholm in 2010 to accept the Crafoord Prize. Carl XVI Gustaf of Sweden presents the Crafoord Prize to Munk. Munk was elected to the National Academy of Sciences in 1956 and to the Royal Society of London in 1976. He was both a Guggenheim Fellow (1948, 1953, 1962) and a Fulbright Fellow. He was named California Scientist of the Year by the California Museum of Science and Industry in 1969. Munk gave the 1986 Bakerian Lecture at the Royal Society on Ships from Space (paper) and Acoustic monitoring of ocean gyres (lecture). In July 2018 at the age of 100, Munk was appointed a Chevalier of France's Legion of Honour in recognition of his contributions to oceanography. Among the many other awards and honors Munk received are the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement, the Arthur L. Day Medal of the Geological Society of America in 1965, the Sverdrup Gold Medal of the American Meteorological Society in 1966, the Gold Medal of the Royal Astronomical Society in 1968, the first Maurice Ewing Medal of the American Geophysical Union and the U.S. Navy in 1976, the Alexander Agassiz Medal of the National Academy of Sciences in 1976, the Captain Robert Dexter Conrad Award of the U.S. Navy in 1978, the National Medal of Science in 1983, the William Bowie Medal of the American Geophysical Union in 1989, the Vetlesen Prize in 1993, the Kyoto Prize in 1999, the first Prince Albert I Medal in 2001, and the Crafoord Prize of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences in 2010 \\"for his pioneering and fundamental contributions to our understanding of ocean circulation, tides and waves, and their role in the Earth's dynamics\\". In 1993, Munk was the first recipient of the Walter Munk Award given \\"in Recognition of Distinguished Research in Oceanography Related to Sound and the Sea.\\" This award was given jointly by The Oceanography Society, the Office of Naval Research and the US Department of Defense Naval Oceanographic Office. The award was retired in 2018, and The Oceanographic Society \\"established the Walter Munk Medal to encompass a broader range of topics in physical oceanography.\\" Munk's devil ray. Two marine species have been named after Munk. One is Sirsoe munki, a deep-sea worm. The other is Mobula munkiana, also known as Munk's devil ray, a small relative of giant manta rays living in huge schools, and with a remarkable ability to leap far out of the water. A 2017 documentary, Spirit of Discovery (Documentary), follows Munk in an expedition with the discoverer, his former student Giuseppe Notarbartolo di Sciara, to Cabo Pulmo National Park in Baja Mexico, the place where the species was first found and described.  Personal life  After Nazi Germany annexed Austria in 1938, an event known as the Anschluss, Munk applied to be a citizen of the United States. In his first attempt, he failed the citizenship test by giving an overly-detailed answer to a question about the Constitution. He obtained American citizenship in 1939. Munk married Martha Chapin in the late 1940s. The marriage ended in divorce in 1953. On June 20, 1953, he married Judith Horton. She was an active participant at Scripps for decades, where she contributed to campus planning, architecture, and the renovation and reuse of historical buildings. The Munks were frequent traveling companions. Judith died in 2006. In 2011, Munk married La Jolla community leader Mary Coakley. Munk remained actively engaged in scientific endeavors throughout his life, with publications as late as 2016. He turned 100 in October 2017. He died of pneumonia on February 8, 2019 at La Jolla, California, aged 101.  Publications = Scientific papers  Munk published 181 scientific papers.

Oliver Sweeney, in the Irish music magazine Hot Press, wrote of him: ‚ÄúHe is a genius whose music is without frontiers, and whose originality makes him one of the most innovative artists in the varied musical genres of today.‚Äù As composer and pianist he is very original and eclectic, and he composed enormous varieties of music, creating a very personal style: ‚Äúone of the most exciting sounds we have heard in years\\" (The 20th Queen Festival at Queen, Belfast 1981). His compositions for cello and piano and for oboe and piano as well as his world music became soundtracks for films, television programs, theatre and ballets. His album \\"Ode to Ireland\\" won the award for the best album of the year. His roots are classical music and jazz, but he began to explore many other ethnic traditions. He was also an anticipator of minimalism and many other styles: ‚ÄúThe categories of ‚ÄúWorld‚Äù and ‚ÄúNew Age‚Äù music did not exist when Breschi began his trailblazing journey‚Äù. He is also a jazz innovator introducing piano in a creative way, mixing Irish and Flamenco music together with blues. Later he did the same with the Italian Pizzica and Taranta traditional music. He also developed a new trumpet sound mixing Irish sean-n√≥s and blues, as Harry Long describes in his music anthology: ‚ÄúBreschi‚Äôs unique approach [...] the playing is superb and his style successfully combines Irish traditional and blues styles‚Äù. He has been breaking barriers among many different kinds of music, ‚Äúyet he was the first to combine Flamenco, Basque, Arabic, Latin and Irish elements, his virtuoso jazz-styled piano uniting these traditions in remarkably original compositions.‚Äù With his work \\"Orekan: The Ethnic Symphony\\" he created a new ‚Äúsymphonic‚Äù concept bringing together piano (the top classical instrument which started the new ‚Äúwell tempered‚Äù system) with a vast variety of \\"not tempered‚Äù instruments, belonging to many different ethnic traditions. For many years and predating the times he was gathering together extraordinary musicians from all over the world, and recording more than 25 albums which form \\"The Nomadic Piano Collection\\". About his ability to anticipate the times, Oliver Sweeney in the Hot Press said about his work Orekan: ‚ÄúOrekan is not only a masterpiece gathered together by the peculiar genius of Ant√≥ni O‚ÄôBreskey; it is above all a unique social document which gives us a strong idea of our roots, and in addition points out a few possible roads we might take in the future‚Äù. He is also known to be the inspirer of the show Riverdance: ‚ÄúBill Whelan developed Breschi‚Äôs synthesis of Flamenco, jazz and Irish traditional strands as a key structure in his Irish music and dance spectacular, Riverdance.‚Äù; ‚ÄúWell pre-dating Riverdance.‚Äù; ‚ÄúAhead of his time‚Ä¶ in 1979 Ant√≥ni O‚Äô released a track called ‚ÄúSunrise‚Äù, some of which sounds almost exactly like Riverdance‚Äù (Victoria Clarke, Sunday Independent). The track ‚ÄúSunrise‚Äù was composed with the contribution of his great friend and musician Velemir Dugina. For this and many other reasons in various concerts his contribution to Irish music and culture was celebrated in the National Concert Hall in Dublin. In 2008 the Swiss National Radio Television presented his book \\"Heyoka: The Soul Shaster\\" with a big evening and concert, and through the notes and the reading, recalled and celebrated all his career as composer, performer, music educator, and his social work through music with Italian and Spanish emigrants, contributing hugely to the dialogue among all people and cultures. He has written 4 books: ‚ÄúEcologia: Salviamo Anche la Musica‚Äù, ‚ÄúSemiminime‚Äù, ‚ÄúWhen Bach Was an Irish Man and Mozart a Gipsy Boy‚Äù and ‚ÄúHeyoka: Il Giullare dell'Anima‚Äù.  Background and Collaborations  Antonio began playing jazz and classical piano at the age of 3. He graduated in piano at the conservatory Luigi Cherubini in Florence, where he also studied trumpet. He founded the Florence Jazz Society at the age of 16, and a few years later the International Folk Group, which became the group Whisky Trail. This name refers to the journey of the Irish emigrants to America and the meeting with the African people which, pursuant to Breschi's belief, gave birth to jazz. In fact among the many original titles of his albums were \\"Irish Meet The Blues\\" (his first solo album), \\"When Jazz Was An Irish Baby\\", \\"On The Irish Side Of Blues Street\\" and \\"Bound For America\\". Between 1970 and 1973 he spent long periods in the USA in Alabama and Louisiana to explore the roots of blues, discovering the strong influence of Irish music in jazz, and performing with old jazz traditional musicians. These experiences are described in his tale ‚ÄúAlabama‚Äù. Still very young he appears in 1972 in Auburn, Alabama, playing with the \\"Auburn University Orchestra\\" and jazz trombonist Urbie Green. Then in 1980 he appeared in Rome with jazz violinist Stephane Grappelli for the first RAI (Italian National Television) Concert For United Europe. In 1985 he concluded the International Jazz Festival of Poland in Kalisz, together with South African pianist Abdullah Ibrahim (also known as Dollar Brand), and in the same year he performed for the National Spanish Television in the stadium of Alcal√° de Henares accompanied at cajon by Antonio Carmona De Los Abichuelas, leader of group Ketama. Antonio Carmona also participated in his flamenco album \\"Punta Umbria\\" and \\"Al Kamar\\", a fusion between flamenco, Arabian and Irish music. The broadcasting \\"Fin De Siglos\\" announced him as \\"the new Keith Jarrett from the Mediterranean\\". In Ireland he started a long collaboration and friendship with Ronnie Drew of The Dubliners, who participated in many of Antonio's albums, the most significant called \\"From Dublin to Bilbao\\". Then later he was on stage in Cesena, Italy, with Rumanian pan flute player Gheorghe Zamfir, in Istanbul with the gipsy Turkish clarinet player Selim Sesler, in Paris with African saxophone player Manu Dibango and rock blues French singer Jacques Higelin. He made many tours in Italy, Ireland and Switzerland with Irish musicians M√°irt√≠n O'Connor (De Dannan), Andy Irvine, Planxty, Dolores Keane (De Dannan), John Faulkner, Johnny McCarthy, Joe McHugh, Maurice Lennon (Stockton's Wing), Gerry and Annie O' Donnell, many of whom participated in Antonio's albums. In the Basque Country he started a strong relationship with national Basque singer Benito Lertxundi, who participated in his albums \\"Mezulari\\" and \\"Donostia\\", and Basque poet Jos√® Angel Irigaray, who created together with Antonio the album of poems and music called \\"Zeharbidetan\\". He also participated in his work \\"Orekan\\", which in Basque language means \\"harmoy among the people\\". In 2008 he began a strong collaboration with Jos√© Seves, leader of group Inti Illimani, who sings in his album \\"Nomadic Aura\\". Among the many musicians that appear in his live performances and in his albums are Persian percussionist Al√¨ Tajbakhsh, African singer Gabin Dabir√©, Cathy Jordan (Dervish), Brid Ni Mhaoileoin, flamenco guitarists Juan Martin, Tomas De Los Reyes, Balen Lopez De Munain, Arabian violinist Jamal Ouassini (director of Tangery Orchestra), Biancastella Croce, Sergio Candotti, Elena Vicini, Mia Froelicher, Massimo Giuntini, Mario Serraglio, Vincenzo De Luci and many more. Recently Antonio appeared in Ireland in duo with singer Donovan and special guest Chris De Burgh, and with Eoin Dillon (Kila). Currently he is playing in trio with his daughter Consuelo Nerea (singer, fiddle and bodhr√°n player) and celloist Davide Viterbo (who both participated with the music and production of most of Antonio's albums since 2001) and sometimes in quartet with oboist Enio Marfoli, who participated in the album \\"Boletus Edulis: Suite For Piano And Oboe\\".  Film, Theatre, Ballet, Music Education and Music Therapy  Antonio composed the music for the 13 documentary film named \\"Il Linguaggio Dei Luoghi\\" (The Language of Places) by film director Folco Quilici, and for many other documentaries by the same film director (Le Alpi, Le Isole, etc.). He composed the music for the movie \\"Le Colline del Garda\\" by film director Franco Piavoli, for the Irish film \\"The Nock\\" by film director Dennis MacArdle. He composed the music for Richard the third by Shakespeare for actor Giorgio Albertazzi. He also created together with Zappal√° Dance and Sicilian Ballet the work \\"Mediterraneo, le antiche sponde del future\\" (The Ancient Shores of the Future) which was performed all over Italy, Spain and North Africa. He created 4 television serials named \\"Il Suono E La Terra\\" (The Sound and the Land) for the Italian television channel RAI 3 all based on his musical journey and his work with the children. Antonio created, performed and directed the fairytale \\"The Woman Of The Sea\\", also for children, produced by Teatro Comunale of Florence with the help of film directors Franco Piavoli, Ermanno Olmi and Mario Monicelli. This fairytale has been performed all over Italy and Switzerland. Later Antonio created a new version of it with Swiss theatre director Michel Poletti, produced by the International Locarno Puppets Festival. In 1976 he created the music laboratory for children \\"Pistoia Ragazzi\\" in Pistoia, Italy and repeated the same experiences later in Zurich with emigrants and children, all this experience described in his book \\"Ecologia: Salviamo Anche La Musica\\". He also performed and still is performing concerts, shows for children and workshops all over the world. His music has also been used for therapy. He personally did music laboratory for handicapped, homeless, drug addicts, immigrants and minority groups. The World Music Magazine of Barcelona wrote \\"his music is a caress that makes us feel human at least for a few moments\\".

Swadhinta Sangram Ke Krantikari Sahitya Ka Itihas. Vol 2. pp. 418‚Äì421), also known as Ram Soami, was an Indian teacher of the Hindu philosophy of Vedanta. He was among the first notable teachers of Hinduism to lecture in the United States, travelling there in 1902, preceded by Swami Vivekananda in 1893 and followed by Paramahansa Yogananda in 1920. During his American tours Swami Rama Tirtha spoke frequently on the concept of 'practical Vedanta' and education of Indian youth. He proposed bringing young Indians to American universities and helped establish scholarships for Indian students.Singh, appendix, article from Minneapolis Tribune: Would Save Countrymen: Swami Ram Plans the Redemption of the Ignorant Masses in India‚ÄîAmerican Education: He Would Have Them Come Here, as Did the Young Japanese. Biography Rama Tirtha was born in a Punjabi Brahmin family to Pandit Hiranand Goswami on 22 October 1873 (Deepawali Vikram Samvat 1930) in the village of Muraliwala in the Gujranwala District of Punjab, Pakistan. His mother died when he was a few days old and he was raised by his elder brother Gossain Gurudas. After receiving a master's degree in mathematics from The Government College of Lahore he became professor of mathematics at Forman Christian College, Lahore. A chance meeting with Swami Vivekananda in 1897 in Lahore, inspired his later decision to take up the life of a sannyasi. Having become well known for his speeches on Krishna and Advaita Vedanta he became a swami in 1899 on the day of Deepawali, leaving his wife, his children and his professorial chair. \\"As a sannyasi, he neither touched any money nor carried any luggage with him. In spite of it he went round the world.\\" Tirtha, Swami Rama (1949) In Woods of God-Realization, Volume V, Preface, p. vii. Lucknow, India: Swami Rama Tirtha Pratisthan. A trip to Japan to teach Hinduism was sponsored by Maharaja Kirtishah Bahadur of Tehri: from there he travelled to the United States of America in 1902, where he spent two years lecturing on Hinduism, other religions and his philosophy of \\"practical vedanta\\". He frequently spoke about the iniquities of the caste system in India and the importance of education of women and of the poor, stating that \\"neglecting the education of women and children and the labouring classes is like cutting down the branches that are supporting us ‚Äì nay, it is like striking a death-blow to the roots of the tree of nationality.\\" Arguing that India needed educated young people, not missionaries, he began an organization to aid Indian students in American universities and helped to establish a number of scholarships for Indian students.Singh, appendix, article from Minneapolis Tribune. He always referred to himself in the third person, which is a common spiritual practice in Hinduism in order to detach oneself from Ego. Though upon his return to India in 1904 large audiences initially attended his lectures he completely withdrew from public life in 1906 and moved to the foothills of the Himalaya where he prepared to write a book giving a systematic presentation of practical vedanta. It was never finished: He died on 17 October 1906 (Deepawali Vikram Samvat 1963). Many believe he did not die but gave up his body to the river Ganges. A significant prediction made by Swami Rama Tirtha for future India is quoted in Shiv R. Jhawar's book, Building a Noble World. Rama Tirtha predicted: ‚ÄúAfter Japan, China will rise and gain prosperity and strength. After China, the sun of prosperity and learning will again smile at India.‚ÄùTirtha, Swami Rama (1913) In Woods of God- Realization, Volume IV, Chapter ‚ÄúTalk at Faizabad‚Äù. Lucknow, India: Swami Rama Tirtha Pratisthan, p. 286. Legacy Rama Tirtha on a 1966 stamp of India Punjabi Indian nationalist Bhagat Singh uses Tirtha as an example of the great contributions Punjab had made to the Indian nationalist movement in his essay \\"The Problem of Punjab's Language and Script\\". The lack of memorials to Tirtha is given by Singh as an example of the lack of respect for Punjab's contributions to the movement. Indian Revolutionary Pandit Ram Prasad Bismil depicted the character of Swami Rama Tirtha in the poem Yuva Sannyasi. Two of his disciples, S. Puran Singh and Narayana Swami, wrote biographies. Puran Singh's The Story of Swami Rama: The Poet Monk of the Punjab appeared in 1924 and was published in English as well as in Hindi. Narayana Swami's untitled account was published in 1935 as a part of Rama Tirtha's collected works. A further account of his life was written by Hari Prasad Shastri and published with poems by Swami Rama Tirtha translated by H P Shastri as 'Scientist and Mahatma' in 1955.Hari Prasad Shastri (1955, 2nd ed. 2006) Scientist and Mahatma, Shanti Sadan. Paramahansa Yogananda translated many of Rama Tirtha's poems from Bengali into English and put some of them to music: one, entitled \\"Marching Light\\", appeared in Yogananda's book Cosmic Chants, as \\"Swami Rama Tirtha's Song\\". The Swami Rama Tirtha Mission Ashram is located at Kotal Gaon Rajpura, near Dehra Dun in Uttarakhand, India. One of three campuses of Hemwati Nandan Bahuguna Garhwal University, situated at Badshahi Thaul, New Tehri, is known as the Swami Rama Tirtha Parisar(SRTC). His sister's son H. W. L. Poonja became a noted Advaita teacher in Lucknow, while Hemant Goswami, his great-grandson, is a social activist based in Chandigarh.

The Threshold were created by the \\"partnership\\" of Abraham White, a travelling salesman, and the Pariah, a living weapon of great power created on Gallifrey many years ago, but was soon cast out by Rassilon as it had developed a mind of its own and rebelled. During a final battle with Rassilon, its containment sphere crashed to Earth, where it was discovered by Abraham. Offering him power and immortality, the Pariah persuaded Abraham to merge with her core being. After helping Henry Ford begin the mass production line of his cars, an inspired Abraham mass-produced a series of spheres, giving birth to the Threshold. The Threshold began their careers as profiteers, using their transport window capabilities to carry out important missions from their clients, during the DMW comic strip \\"Ground Zero\\" (Issues 238-242) they eventually come under contract to the Lobri, a race of spider-like parasitic entities trapped on a plane of reality that also holds together the link between human minds. They supply the Lobri with the resources required to instigate a breakout, a large gathering of humans at the Notting Hill Carnival, and supply them with three of the Doctor's previous companions, Peri, Ace, and Sarah Jane Smith, to gain enough power to escape the dimension, having taken them from previous adventures in the Doctor's life. The Doctor, along with his granddaughter Susan, were also abducted and used by Threshold agents, but successfully managed to trick the main Threshold operative for the Notting Hill mission, Isaac, and travelled to the realm. There, they saved all of the companions, except for Ace, who dies saving the Doctor. They destroyed two of the Lobri, and killed the surviving member when it arrived on Earth. Using the TARDIS, the Threshold remained untouched, and with their secrets still known only to them, merely continued on with business as usual. Their only real weakness is their inability to time travel, providing the Doctor with an inevitable upper hand when dealing with them in later adventures. During the Eighth Doctor comic strip adventure \\"Fire and Brimstone\\" (Issues 251-255), the Threshold are hired by the Time Lords to eliminate the Daleks as they attempt to open the doorway to an alternate reality as part of a war effort to destroy a group of alternate Daleks that had crossed over into their reality, and then to eventually conquer all of the multiverse. This goal was not above attempting to sacrifice the Doctor, their major interest in fulfilling this contract was the reward: A black box (which would allow them the gift of universal translation, necessary to implement a message to the galaxies on a proposal of their own). The Doctor successfully managed to end the Dalek threat without sacrificing himself, and the Threshold attained their box. Tiring of the Threshold's manipulations, the Doctor fought back in the comic strip \\"Wormwood\\" (Issues 266-271). Enabling the aid of a disguised Shayde to fake his own regeneration, he allowed the Threshold to believe him vulnerable enough to take the TARDIS crew to their main base on the moon, a western like town on the surface (to appease Abraham's roots) and a major complex underneath. The Doctor's friends learned of the Threshold's secret history and the extent of their agenda; to make universal travel impossible and profit from the continuous use of their interdimensional windows. With the plot revealed, the Doctor came out of hiding, the Pariah then revealed that it had tricked even its own creations, it (or a \\"she\\" by her own admission) wiped out the Threshold legions by shifting their Eye of Disharmony device, using it to disrupt their universe, a split second in time, killing them instantly. Abraham at this point turned against the Pariah and separated himself from her, causing her to lose most of her powers, before finally being brought down by Shayde, who is revealed to be her successor. The Doctor destroys the Eye's control centre, and the device explodes, decimating the alien moon and killing both White and The Pariah, ending the Threshold's organisation once and for all.

One source also names it Jone o Grinfilt though this title usually refers to different lyrics and score, which is about the naivet√© of country folk. Actually, it is very similar to Jone o'Grinfilt Junior which can be found in John Harland's Ballads and Songs of Lancashire (1875 pp. 169‚Äì171). According to Axon website (Axon) Jone o Grinfilt was written by Joseph Lees of Glodwick, near Oldham in the 1790s. The earlier version, the Poor Cotton Weaver, was probably written before 1800, after the Napoleonic wars it was revived or re-written, due to economic hard times, when weavers were reduced to eating nettles. This could refer to the war itself any of the periodic economic downturns in the cotton industry. It was featured in Mary Barton published in 1848, then later referred to the Lancashire Cotton Famine of 1862. It is found on broadsides in Manchester up to the 1880s, it did not survive into the 20th century. In the folk revival it reappeared. The version by Ewan MacColl probably influenced the version by Silly Sisters and by Unto Ashes. Jez Lowe wrote his song \\"Nearer to Nettles\\", after an old woman approached his band's vocalist, who'd just sung The \\"Four- Loom Weaver\\", remarking she'd never been nearer to eating nettles at that time (late 80s/early 90s) than during any other period of her life. A Four Loom Weaver A Four Loom weaver is power loom weaver using 4 Lancashire Looms in a Lancashire weaving shed. They probably would be Horrocks, or Howard & Bullough. The rewrite of four loom weaver refers to the years of the Lancashire Cotton Famine, when the weaver was totally dependent on his income from the millowner- unlike the handloom weaver who would probably have a vegetable patch and a few chickens. The Cotton Famine was caused by the cotton trade being interrupted by the American Civil War. The Lancashire man- three generations in the mill could not comprehend how the cotton stopped, and still had the quaint belief that the great man (PM perhaps) only needed to tell the shipowners to bring in some more cotton. Many Lancashire folk, can give personal testimony of relative having worked in such a role. > My maternal grandmother was a four loom cotton weaver until the mill, where > she worked, in Rawtenstall, Lancashire, was closed and relocated to India in > the 1920s approx. Mill workers worked their way up to four looms which were > rented from the mill. Four was the maximum so my nan told me, so a four loom > weaver was an indication of the level of attainment in the industry. So I > think the title is probably correct and not a corruption of a poor loom > weaver. Will Lever, Malpas, Cheshire'' Power weavers would continue to tenter four looms until the mid-1930s operating at 220 picks a minute. The industry attempted to restructure using the 'more looms system' where the weavers were switched to tentering eight looms operating at 180 picks a minute. This caused industrial unrest,; and uneasy compromise of using six loom sets was reached. It was quietly put on hold, but with the Second World War curtailed freedoms most weaving sheds switched to eight. Queen Street Mill ran sets of eight, with a training alley of six and a pensioners alley of 12 loom sets for two elderly weavers to work together. Other mills such as Bancroft Shed ran ten-sets. Poor Cotton Weaver The Norton versionNorton version gives an earlier set of words the Poor Cotton Weaver which refers to the hand loom weaving. > :::Old Billy O' Bent, he were telling us long :::We mayn't had better times > if I'd nobbut held m' tongue. :::Well, I held m' tongue til I near lost m' > breath, :::And I feel in m' hear that I'II soon clem to death Jone o'Grinfilt Junior > :::Aw'm a poor cotton-wayver as mony a one knaws :::Aw've nowt t'ate in th' > heawse, un' aw've worn eawt my cloas :::yo'u hardly gie sixpence fur o' > aw've got on :::Meh clogs ur' booath baws'n un' stockins aw've none There is also a version called the Oldham Weaver in Mary Barton, by Mrs Gaskell in 1848.

Womack, Jr.) is a music producer from the United States. He works primarily on hip hop music, and has produced or co-produced for artists Snoop Dogg and Shaquille O'Neal. Wells is also the son of Motown singer Mary Wells and musician/songwriter, Cecil Womack. Being the son of Motown legend Mary Wells may have helped jumpstart Meech Wells' career, but the West Coast rap producer quickly proved his talent and eventually aligned himself with Snoop Dogg, another relationship that definitely didn't hurt his career. Before being Snoop's producer of choice during the late 1990s and early 2000s, Wells began his career as part of a funk band called Trey Lewd that also featured Tracey Lewis, George Clinton's son; this provided him with the opportunity to work with Clinton himself. By 1993, Wells found himself working alongside producer/rapper Def Jef; the two's production on Shaquille O'Neil's \\"I Got Skillz\\" (a surprise hit single) won them instant credentials. Throughout the mid-'90s, he continued to hone his craft, working on a number of remix projects before eventually being introduced to Snoop through a friend. Before long, the two were working together as a potent duo, beginning with \\"Still a G Thang,\\" one of the songs on Snoop's Da Game Is to Be Sold, Not to Be Told. Wells produced a few No Limit songs featuring Snoop‚ÄîTru's \\"It's a Beautiful Thang,\\" Silkk the Shocker's \\"Get It Up\\"‚Äîbefore playing a major role in bringing a West Coast sound to Snoop's Top Dogg album in 1999: \\"In Love With a Thug,\\" \\"Better Days,\\" \\"Gangsta Ride,\\" among others. In 2000 he reprised his role as one of Snoop's producers of choice, producing tracks for Tha Eastsidaz' self-titled debut and Doggy's Angels' Pleezbalevit, as well as Snoop's own Tha Last Meal (\\"Go Away,\\" \\"Issues\\").

After just two first class matches, he was picked to play Test cricket for India against Australia in the next year. Through the fifties India had wicket keepers of about the same quality in Naren Tamhane, Probir Sen and Nana Joshi. Joshi and Tamhane had already been tried when Kunderan got his chance in the third Test. Kunderan got out hit wicket on his first appearance while attempting to pull Ian Meckiff but scored 71 and 33 in his next Test. Kunderan had already played three Test matches when he made his Ranji Trophy debut in 1960. In his first Ranji appearance, he hit 205 for Railways against Jammu and Kashmir. His was one of eight double-centuries scored during Ranji Trophy debuts. His second first class hundred was also scored later in the year against the same opponents in a match that Railways won without losing a wicket. Playing in the 1960s From the early 1960s, Kunderan had a new competitor for the wicket keeping position in Farokh Engineer. Both played in the series against England at home and toured West Indies in 1961-62. Engineer was selected ahead of Kunderan when England again visited India in 1963-64, but he was found medically unfit on the eve of the first Test at Madras. Opening the innings, Kunderan hit 192 with 31 fours, 170 of which came on the first day of the match. He scored another hundred at Delhi and finished with an aggregate of 525 runs in the series. Since this series, only two other wicket keepers have scored more than 500 runs in a Test series - Denis Lindsay, 606 for South Africa v Australia in 1966-67 and Andy Flower, 540 for Zimbabwe v India in 2000-01.Most runs by wicket keepers in a series. The Indian selectors dropped both Kunderan and Engineer from the next series against Australia and instead went for K. S. Indrajitsinhji. Engineer was then recalled for the New Zealand series that followed while Kunderan played as an opening batsman in the place of injured Dilip Sardesai. In 1965, Kunderan left his job in the Railways and appeared for Mysore and the South Zone. A side effect of this was that he was able to keep wickets to the bowling of Chandrasekhar, Prasanna and Venkatraghavan in domestic matches. Recalled against West Indies in 1966-67, Kunderan scored 79 in 92 minutes in the Bombay Test. Early on in the innings, he appeared to have been caught by Garry Sobers but as the batsman prepared to depart, Sobers indicated that he had taken the catch on the bounce. One Test later, Kunderan again found himself out of the team. The team that toured England in 1967 included both Kunderan and Engineer, but from here Engineer asserted himself as the primary 'keeper. Kunderan played purely as a batsman in the second and third Tests of the series. When Sardesai retired with a hand injury in the Lord's Test, he opened with Engineer and topscored with 47 out of India's 110 all out. He opened both batting and bowling at Birmingham where India played four spinners. This was to be Kunderan's last Test. Post- international career He served as a professional in the Lancashire league and then with Drumpellier in the Western Union in Scotland. In the early 1980s, he played for Scotland in the Benson and Hedges Cup in England. Kunderan lived in Scotland from the turn of the 1970s. His brother Bharat, also a wicket-keeper, played first class cricket for Indian Universities in 1970-71. Budhi Kunderan died from lung cancer at the age of 66. In June 2018, he was awarded with a Special Award by the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI).

In particular, the idea that mass‚Äìenergy generates curvature in space and that curvature affects the motion of masses can be illustrated in a Newtonian setting. We use circular orbits as our prototype. This has the advantage that we know the kinetics of circular orbits. This allows us to calculate curvature of orbits in space directly and compare the results with dynamical forces. __TOC__ The equivalence of gravitational and inertial mass A unique feature of the gravitational force is that all massive objects accelerate in the same manner in a gravitational field. This is often expressed as \\"The gravitational mass is equal to the inertial mass.\\" This allows us to think of gravity as a curvature of spacetime. Test for flatness in spacetime If initially parallel paths of two particles on nearby geodesics remain parallel within some accuracy, then spacetime is flat to within that accuracy. [Ref. 2, p. 30] Two nearby particles in a radial gravitational field=Newtonian mechanics for circular orbits Circular orbits at the same radius. =The geodesic and field equations for circular orbits= Consider the situation in which there are two particles in nearby circular polar orbits of the Earth at radius r and speed v . Since the orbits are circular, the gravitational force on the particles must equal the centripetal force, : {v^2 \\\\over r} = {GM \\\\over r^2} where G is the gravitational constant and M is the mass of the earth. The particles execute simple harmonic motion about the earth and with respect to each other. They are at their maximum distance from each other as they cross the equator. Their trajectories intersect at the poles. From Newton's Law of Gravitation the separation vector \\\\mathbf{h} can be shown to be given by the \\"geodesic equation\\" : {d^2 \\\\mathbf{h} \\\\over d\\\\tau^2} + R \\\\mathbf{h} = 0 where R = {1 \\\\over r^2 } {v^2 \\\\over c^2 } is the curvature of the trajectory and \\\\tau = ct is the speed of light c times the time. The curvature of the trajectory is generated by the mass of the earth M . This is represented by the \\"field equation\\" : R = {GM \\\\over { r^3} } In this example, the field equation is simply a statement of the Newtonian concept that centripetal force is equal to gravitational force for circular orbits. We refer to this expression as a field equation in order to highlight the similarities with the Einstein field equation. This equation is in a much different form than Gauss's law, which is the usual characterization of the field equation in Newtonian mechanics. The position of the moving particle with respect to the particle at rest in the co-moving reference frame. =Relationship between curvature and mass density= Mass can be written in terms of the average mass density \\\\rho (r) inside a sphere of radius r by the expression : M = {4\\\\pi\\\\rho (r) r^3 \\\\over 3 } . The field equation becomes : R = {4 \\\\pi G \\\\over {3 } } \\\\rho (r) . The curvature of the particle trajectories is proportional to mass density. =Local measurements= A requirement of General Relativity is that all measurements must be made locally. We can therefore imagine that the particles are inside a windowless spacecraft co-orbiting the earth with the center of mass of the spacecraft coincident with one of the particles. That particle would be at rest with respect to the spacecraft. An observer in the spacecraft would have no indication that the craft was orbiting the earth. The observer is only allowed to measure the behavior of the particles in the frame of the craft. In this example, we can define a local coordinate system such that the z -direction is toward the ceiling of the craft and this is directed along \\\\mathbf{r} . The x -direction is toward the front of the craft and is in the direction of \\\\mathbf{v} . The y -direction is toward the left side of the craft. In this frame, the vector \\\\mathbf{h} is the position vector for the second particle. An observer in the craft would think the second particle was oscillating in a potential well generated by a gravitational field. This is an example of a coordinate acceleration due to the choice of frames as opposed to a physical acceleration due to actual forces. General motion in the earth's gravitational fieldElliptic and hyberbolic trajectories= Co-planar elliptic orbits. The particle in the outer orbit travels slower than the particle in the inner orbit. They will separate with time. More generally, particles move in elliptic or hyberbolic trajectories in a plane that contains the earth center. The orbits need not be circular. One can obtain intuitive geodesic and field equations in those situations as well [Ref 2, Chapter 1]. Unlike circular orbits, however, the speed of the particles in elliptic or hyperbolic trajectories is not constant. We therefore do not have a constant speed with which to scale the curvature. Therefore, in anticipation of the transition to relativistic mechanics, the trajectories and curvatures are scaled with the speed of light c . From Newton's Law of Gravitation : {d^2 \\\\mathbf{r} \\\\over dt^2} = - {GM \\\\over r^3}\\\\mathbf{r} one can obtain the geodesic equation for the separation of two particles in nearby trajectories : {d^2 \\\\mathbf{h} \\\\over d\\\\tau^2} + R \\\\mathbf{h} = 0 and the field equation : R = R_{\\\\perp} = {GM \\\\over {c^2 r^3}} = {4 \\\\pi G \\\\over {3 c^2 } }\\\\rho (r) if the particle separation is perpendicular to \\\\mathbf{r} and : R = R_{\\\\} = -{2GM \\\\over {c^2 r^3}} = -{8 \\\\pi G \\\\over {3 c^2 } }\\\\rho (r) if the separation is parallel to \\\\mathbf{r} . In the calculation of R_{\\\\} the radius was expanded in terms of \\\\mathbf{h} . Only the linear term was retained. In the case that the separation of the particle is radial, the curvature is negative. This will cause the particles to separate rather than to be drawn toward each other as in the case in which they have the same radius. This is easy to understand. Outer orbits travel slower than inner orbits. This leads to particle separation. =Local coordinate system= Local \\"diagonal\\" coordinate system for an elliptic orbit. A local coordinate system for a space craft co-moving with one of the particles can again be defined. The z -direction, toward the ceiling, is in the direction of \\\\mathbf{r} . The x -direction, toward the front of the craft, is perpendicular to \\\\mathbf{r} but still in the plane of the trajectory. Unlike in a circular orbit, this craft no longer necessarily points in the direction of the velocity. The y -direction is toward the left side of the craft. Tensor description=Simple diagonal frame The geodesic equation in a radial gravitational field can be described succinctly in tensor notation [Ref. 2, p. 37] in the co-moving frame in which the ceiling of the space craft is in the \\\\mathbf{\\\\hat r} direction : {d^2 h^i \\\\over ds^2} + R^i_j h^j = 0 where the Latin indices are over the spatial directions in the co-moving system, and we have used the Einstein summation convention in which repeated indices are summed. The curvature tensor R^i_j is given by : \\\\begin{Vmatrix} R^1_1 & R^2_1 & R^3_1\\\\ R^1_2 & R^2_2 & R^3_2\\\\ R^1_3 & R^2_3 & R^3_3 \\\\end{Vmatrix} = \\\\begin{Vmatrix} R_\\\\perp & 0 & 0\\\\ 0 & R_\\\\perp & 0\\\\ 0 & 0 & R_\\\\ \\\\end{Vmatrix} and the separation vector is given by : \\\\begin{Vmatrix} h^1 & h^2 & h^3\\\\end{Vmatrix} = \\\\begin{Vmatrix} \\\\mathbf{h}\\\\cdot\\\\mathbf{\\\\hat x} & \\\\mathbf{h}\\\\cdot\\\\mathbf{\\\\hat y} & \\\\mathbf{h}\\\\cdot\\\\mathbf{\\\\hat z}\\\\end{Vmatrix} where \\\\mathbf{h}\\\\cdot\\\\mathbf{\\\\hat x} is the component of \\\\mathbf{h} in the \\\\mathbf{\\\\hat x} direction, \\\\mathbf{h}\\\\cdot\\\\mathbf{\\\\hat y} is the component in the \\\\mathbf{\\\\hat y} direction, and \\\\mathbf{h}\\\\cdot\\\\mathbf{\\\\hat z} is the component in the \\\\mathbf{\\\\hat z} direction. In this co-moving coordinate system the curvature tensor is diagonal. This is not true in general. Arbitrary orientation of the local frame The co-moving spacecraft has no windows. An observer is not able to tell which direction is the \\\\mathbf{\\\\hat r} direction, nor can he/she know which direction is the velocity with respect to earth. The orientation of the spacecraft may be quite different from the simple coordinate system in which the ceiling is in the \\\\mathbf{\\\\hat r} direction and the front of the craft is in a direction coplanar with the radius and the velocity. We can transform our simple coordinates to an arbitrarily oriented coordinate system through rotations. This, however, destroys the diagonal nature of the curvature matrix. Rotations are performed with a rotation matrix \\\\mathcal{C} such that the separation vector \\\\mathbf{\\\\bar h} is related to the separation vector before rotation \\\\mathbf{h} by the relation : \\\\bar h^i = \\\\mathcal{M}^i_jh^j . The inverse \\\\bar{\\\\mathcal{M}} of \\\\mathcal{M} is defined by : \\\\bar{\\\\mathcal{M}}^i_j \\\\mathcal{M}^j_k = \\\\delta^i_k , which yields : h^i = \\\\bar{\\\\mathcal{M}}^i_j \\\\bar h^j . Here \\\\delta^i_k is the Kronecker delta. A simple rotation matrix that rotates the coordinate axis through an angle \\\\theta about the x -axis is : \\\\begin{Vmatrix}\\\\mathcal{M}^1_1 & \\\\mathcal{M}^2_1 & \\\\mathcal{M}^3_1\\\\ \\\\mathcal{M}^1_2 & \\\\mathcal{M}^2_2 & \\\\mathcal{M}^3_2\\\\ \\\\mathcal{M}^1_3 & \\\\mathcal{M}^2_3 & \\\\mathcal{M}^3_3 \\\\end{Vmatrix} = \\\\begin{Vmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0\\\\ 0 & \\\\cos(\\\\theta ) & \\\\sin(\\\\theta )\\\\ 0 & -\\\\sin(\\\\theta ) & \\\\cos(\\\\theta )\\\\end{Vmatrix} . This is a rotation in the y-z plane. The inverse is obtained by switching the sign of \\\\theta . If the rotation matrix does not depend on time then the geodisic equation becomes, upon rotation : {d^2 \\\\bar h^i \\\\over ds^2} + \\\\bar R^i_j \\\\bar h^j = 0 where : \\\\bar R^i_j = \\\\mathcal{M}^i_k R^k_l \\\\bar{\\\\mathcal{M}}^l_j . The curvature in the new coordinate system is non- diagonal. The inverse problem of transforming an arbitrary coordinate system into a diagonal system can be performed mathematically with the process of diagonalization. Diagram 1. Changing views of spacetime along the world line of a rapidly accelerating observer. In this animation, the dashed line is the spacetime trajectory (\\"world line\\") of a particle. The balls are placed at regular intervals of proper time along the world line. The solid diagonal lines are the light cones for the observer's current event, and intersect at that event. The small dots are other arbitrary events in the spacetime. For the observer's current instantaneous inertial frame of reference, the vertical direction indicates the time and the horizontal direction indicates distance. The slope of the world line (deviation from being vertical) is the velocity of the particle on that section of the world line. So at a bend in the world line the particle is being accelerated. Note how the view of spacetime changes when the observer accelerates, changing the instantaneous inertial frame of reference. These changes are governed by the Lorentz transformations. Also note that: ‚Ä¢ the balls on the world line before/after future/past accelerations are more spaced out due to time dilation. ‚Ä¢ events which were simultaneous before an acceleration are at different times afterwards (due to the relativity of simultaneity), ‚Ä¢ events pass through the light cone lines due to the progression of proper time, but not due to the change of views caused by the accelerations, and ‚Ä¢ the world line always remains within the future and past light cones of the current event. Time dependent rotation of the local frame: Christoffel symbols The space craft may tumble about its center of mass. In that case the rotation matrix is time dependent. If the rotation matrix is time dependent, then it does not commute with the time derivative. In that case, the rotation of the separation velocity can be written : \\\\mathcal{M}^k_i {d h^i \\\\over ds} = \\\\mathcal{M}^k_i {d \\\\bar{\\\\mathcal{M}}^i_j \\\\bar h^j \\\\over ds} which becomes : {d \\\\bar h^k \\\\over ds} + \\\\Gamma^k_j \\\\bar h^j \\\\ \\\\stackrel{\\\\mathrm{def}}{=}\\\\ {D \\\\bar h^k \\\\over Ds} where : \\\\Gamma^k_j \\\\ \\\\stackrel{\\\\mathrm{def}}{=}\\\\ \\\\mathcal{M}^k_i {d \\\\bar{\\\\mathcal{M}}^i_j \\\\over ds} is known as a Christoffel symbol. The geodesic equation becomes : {D^2 \\\\bar h^i \\\\over Ds^2} + \\\\bar R^i_j \\\\bar h^j = 0 , which is the same as before with the exception that the derivatives have been generalized. Arbitrariness in the curvature The velocity in the frame of the spacecraft can be written : \\\\bar u^i \\\\ \\\\stackrel{\\\\mathrm{def}}{=}\\\\ {D \\\\bar h^i \\\\over Ds} . The geodesic equation becomes : {d \\\\bar u^i \\\\over ds} + \\\\Gamma^i_j \\\\bar u^j + \\\\bar R^i_j \\\\bar h^j = 0 . : {d^2 \\\\bar h^i \\\\over ds^2} + 2 \\\\Gamma^i_j {d \\\\bar h^i \\\\over ds} + {d \\\\Gamma^i_j \\\\over ds} \\\\bar h^j + \\\\Gamma^i_j \\\\Gamma^j_k \\\\bar h^k + \\\\bar R^i_j \\\\bar h^j = 0 . In an arbitrarily rotating spacecraft, the curvature of space is due to two terms, one due to the mass density and one due to the arbitrary rotation of the spacecraft. The arbitrary rotation is non-physical and must be eliminated in any real physical theory of gravitation. In General Relativity this is done with a process called Fermi‚ÄìWalker transport. In a Euclidean sense, Fermi‚ÄìWalker transport is simply a statement that the spacecraft is not allowed to tumble : \\\\Gamma^i_j = 0 for all i and j. The only time-dependent rotations allowed are those generated by the mass density. General geodesic and field equations in a Newtonian setting=Geodesic equation : {D^2 \\\\bar h^i \\\\over Ds^2} + \\\\bar R^i_j \\\\bar h^j = 0 where : {D \\\\over Ds} \\\\ \\\\stackrel{\\\\mathrm{def}}{=}\\\\ {d \\\\over ds} + \\\\Gamma and \\\\Gamma is a Christoffel symbol. Field equation : \\\\bar R^i_j = \\\\mathcal{M}^i_k R^k_l \\\\bar{\\\\mathcal{M}}^l_j where \\\\mathcal{M}^i_j is a rotation matrix and the curvature tensor is : \\\\begin{Vmatrix} R^1_1 & R^2_1 & R^3_1\\\\ R^1_2 & R^2_2 & R^3_2\\\\ R^1_3 & R^2_3 & R^3_3 \\\\end{Vmatrix} = \\\\begin{Vmatrix} R_\\\\perp & 0 & 0\\\\ 0 & R_\\\\perp & 0\\\\ 0 & 0 & R_\\\\ \\\\end{Vmatrix} . The curvature is proportional to the mass density : R_{\\\\perp} = {4 \\\\pi G \\\\over {3 c^2 } }\\\\rho (r) : R_{\\\\} = -{8 \\\\pi G \\\\over {3 c^2 } }\\\\rho (r) . Overview of the Newtonian picture The geodesic and field equations simply are a restatement of Newton's Law of Gravitation as seen from a local frame of reference co- moving with the mass within the local frame. This picture contains many of the elements of General Relativity, including the concept that particles travel along geodesics in a curved space (spacetime in the relativistic case) and that the curvature is due to the presence of mass density (mass/energy density in the relativistic case). This picture also contains some of the mathematical machinery of General Relativity such as tensors, Christoffel symbols, and Fermi‚ÄìWalker transport. Relativistic generalization World line of a circular orbit about the Earth depicted in two spatial dimensions X and Y (the plane of the orbit) and a time dimension, usually put as the vertical axis. Note that the orbit about the Earth is (almost) a circle in space, but its worldline is a helix in spacetime. General relativity generalizes the geodesic equation and the field equation to the relativistic realm in which trajectories in space are replaced with world lines in spacetime. The equations are also generalized to more complicated curvatures.

Klayton has led several bands and has performed under a variety of stage names since the early 1990s. His current projects are Celldweller and Scandroid.  Personal life  Logotype Albert grew up in an Italian-American conservative Christian household. in New York, where he attended church with his younger brother Dan and friends Buka and Klank (who would collaborate with him on a number of future music projects). Albert never had formal training on an instrument, instead picking up whatever interested him and learning it himself. He took one semester of music theory in college but dropped out, explaining that \\"all they wanted to tell me is what I could and couldn‚Äôt do according to the laws of music and I couldn‚Äôt have cared less.\\" He eventually led to characterizing himself as being a \\"jack of all trades, master of none\\" when it came to musical instruments. The first of these instruments was the drums. In his teenage years, Albert listened to a lot of metal, only later being introduced to electronic music through bands such as Depeche Mode and Skinny Puppy. All of these would influence Klayton's musical output in the early and mid 1990s, as he melded heavy guitars with layered samples and synths in the handful of industrial metal bands that he formed. In later years, Klayton has referenced European drum'n'bass and Goa/psychedelic trance as influential on the sound of his project Celldweller. Though Klayton's numerous projects in the early and mid 1990s were signed to Christian record labels and are generally considered Christian bands, Klayton took great pains to distance himself from that distinction and that subculture in the later 1990s by splitting from the CCM industry and forgoing any further performances at Christian venues. He described this move and the reasoning behind it to great length in a 1998 interview with Christian metal publication HM Magazine and has reiterated his stance in more recent Celldweller interviews. Klayton has stated repeatedly that he is a fan of Godzilla and the Kaiju genre in general. In an interview with Bloody Disgusting, Klayton said that David Fincher's audio commentary on the films Seven and Fight Club have inspired him to record his own audio commentaries for his Beta Cession releases for Wish Upon a Blackstar. On September 16, 2017, he posted his wedding picture on Facebook. He has three sons.  Music career = Immortal, late 1980s  Immortal was a thrash metal band that put out one demo cassette in the late 1980s. It was this cassette that got the attention of R.E.X. Records, who would later sign Klayton's band Circle of Dust. Dan (lvl) was also a member of Immortal.  Circle of Dust, Brainchild, and Argyle Park, 1990‚Äìpresent  Klayton's primary band throughout the 1990s was Circle of Dust, an industrial metal outfit he formed in 1990. Circle of Dust got signed to R.E.X. Records, a small label that concerned itself primarily with underground Christian metal in the late 1980s and early 1990s.Despite heavy touring and some notable success in the underground industrial metal scene, Circle of Dust released only two proper albums, those being a self- titled debut in 1992 and a posthumous collection called Disengage in 1998. In between the times of those releases, Klayton created two notable side projects under various aliases and with various collaborators. The first of these was Brainchild, formed with the president of R.E.X. Records, Doug Mann. The only Brainchild album, Mindwarp, was released shortly after the debut Circle of Dust album in 1992 and featured even heavier thrash metal influences. Later, in 1994, the Mindwarp album was re-issued as a Circle of Dust album titled Brainchild to take advantage of a new distribution deal R.E.X. had signed without having to write and record a new album. That same year, Klayton co- formed, along with the mysterious musician Buka, the supergroup Argyle Park, arguably the most controversial Christian industrial metal band in the short history of the genre. Argyle Park produced one album, Misguided, which was released to both high acclaim and heavy criticism in 1995 and featured a number of collaborators from mainstream industrial rock bands and Christian rock bands alike. 1995 would prove to be a busy and chaotic year for Klayton; he toured and released a complete re-recording of the self-titled Circle of Dust album while R.E.X., it turned out, was losing its distribution deal. This caused the label, who refused to release any of their signed bands from contract, to slide into bankruptcy. Essentially, Circle of Dust was trapped on a sinking ship, unable to record and release new music but also prevented from signing to any other label. Later that year, Klayton decided to end Circle of Dust and find new means of creating and releasing music. It wasn't until early 2016 that Klayton bought the rights to his Circle of Dust music back from the record company it was owned by, and began remastering and re-releasing all of those albums, including the ones from Brainchild and Argyle Park. In the deluxe remastered versions of those albums he added new Circle of Dust singles, which later became part of a brand new album, Machines of Our Disgrace, which Klayton says showcases what Circle of Dust would sound like in the modern day.  Angeldust, 1995‚Äì2000  While Circle of Dust was touring in 1994/1995, Klayton had been contacted on a number of occasions by illusionist Criss Angel, who wanted to collaborate on a magic show. When R.E.X.'s legal troubles prevented Klayton from recording or touring in 1995, he put the band to rest and began writing with Angel. The two combined their names and called the band Angeldust and spent upwards of two years creating a live theatrical show that would feature \\"Illusions, a live band, avant-garde characters that roam the landscape, robotic lighting, television monitors and projectors, performance art pieces and more.\\" They released their first album, Musical Conjurings from the World of Illusion, in 1998, the same year as the final Circle of Dust album. However, by 2000, all mention of Klayton had been erased from the Criss Angel website and a complete trilogy of albums, including a re-issue of the first album, were released only under the name Criss Angel as the extended soundtrack for his Amystika show. Klayton later explained that it had become apparent to the two that they were better off working on their own projects. Several years later, however, it appeared that the two had made amends, as Klayton recorded and remixed a new theme song for Angel's Mindfreak show in 2006. This collaboration represents Klayton's final contribution to the discography of Criss Angel.  Celldweller, 1999‚Äìpresent  Klayton, previously having used Celldweller only as an occasional production moniker, turned the entity into a full-fledged solo band after parting ways with Criss Angel in 1999 and released a five-song limited edition teaser EP that same year. Interest ran high, with several Celldweller demo songs and remixes earning high marks on the charts on the old Mp3.com. A number of setbacks, including attempts to find backing by a major label that fell through, caused the debut eponymous Celldweller album to be delayed by two years. It was independently released in 2003 and has made a number of achievements such as reaching the 17th spot on Billboard's Internet Sales Chart, winning a number of 2004 Just Plain Folks Music Awards, and having every track present on the album being licensed to appear in movie trailers, television shows, or computer games, a feat only previously accomplished by Moby and Crystal Method. In 2008, Celldweller released Soundtrack for the Voices in My Head Vol. 01, a collection of works that Klayton felt were more apt for theatrical use than main album material. Some of these tracks have now been licensed to media, and additional volumes are expected to appear in the future. Klayton has been working on the second Celldweller album, Wish Upon a Blackstar, for the past four or five years and recently announced the release method, which involves publishing the album digitally in chapters of two songs each over time as he finishes the songs in the studio. This approach is tailored to the \\"post-album\\" atmosphere of the modern music industry, and parallels similar movements by such high-profile artists as The Smashing Pumpkins. Klayton has also produced a number of songs and albums for similar artists since starting Celldweller, most notably appearing on AP2, the resurrection of Argyle Park, on Tooth & Nail Records in 2000. Klayton wrote two songs for the album, while LVL wrote the bulk of the album.  Scandroid, 2013‚Äìpresent  Starting on July 24, 2013, Klayton, via his Celldweller social pages, began posting quotes and links to the video titled \\"What is the Salvation Code?\\", which revealed a skull-like logo had been posted around July 17, hinting this upcoming project. Later, he posted a new link to the website SalvationCode.com, requiring a password that was hinted on the video posted previously, which turned out to be \\"2513\\", the four final digits of the date at the end of the video. After entering the password, the next page contained a video that had an extended preview of the unreleased song that had been heard on the previous video, both videos of which hinted that the date, August 6, 2013, will be the date that the full song titled \\"Salvation Code\\" will be released. Also on the latest video, several images where displayed; one of which was of Klayton on the left, and who was believed to be Varien, an electronica artist, and another image being a possible official artwork of the upcoming single. The second video was later uploaded on July 30, 2013, along with Klayton making a post on both his and the new Scandroid social pages to confirm that the project will consist of both him and Varien, who had made the same post. The post also stated that the Scandroid music will consist of elements of 1980s retro and electronic music with what they described as a \\"Neo-Tokyo\\" theme. Shortly after the releases of their first two singles, Varien left the project, resulting in Scandroid currently being managed only by Klayton. On November 11, 2016, Scandroid debuted a full-length, self-titled album, featuring all the singles released prior (including the two with Varien on the project), and continuing the futuristic Tokyo theme, though changing the specific year of the story from \\"2513\\" to \\"2516\\". On March 31, 2017, a remix album titled Dreams of Neo-Tokyo was released, which featured remixes of the ten vocal tracks from the Scandroid album. A second full-length album, Monochrome, was released on October 27, 2017. The Darkness EP was released on December 4, 2018, and a companion EP titled The Light was released on December 13, 2019.  FiXT  Klayton and his manager had formed Esion Media to release the first Celldweller album themselves, and after the success of that album, Klayton morphed Esion into an all new independent record label, FiXT. FiXT grew quickly over the following few years and now features an extensive online store that distributes artists, including Blue Stahli, signed to both FiXT itself and to a variety of other independent record labels. FiXT has branched into the world of literary publication with two award-winning science fiction novels called The Bane of Yoto. In early 2013, Klayton announced FiXT would be publishing a novel by Josh Viola called Blackstar, which is based on Klayton's Wish Upon a Blackstar album. FiXT also sells digital art packs, original clothing designs, and other merchandise related to the music and artistic concepts of FiXT-associated artists. Until late 2012, FiXT also sponsored and hosted remix contests in which fans were provided original recordings and tracks (\\"stems\\") of songs by FiXT artists to create and submit their own remixes; winners were awarded prizes including FiXT merchandise, artwork, and music production software. FiXT Remix was discontinued due to mounting expenses and the difficulty of maintenance and development  Clothing line  In a March 2014 YouTube video titled \\"Cellevision\\", Klayton hinted that he is to announce a new clothing line under the name of 'Outland Industries'. Items in this line are becoming available through the FiXT label and site, with a sister site WeAreOutland used for promotional purposes. Stage names Klayton appeared under a number of pseudonyms during the 1990s before settling on the moniker Klayton in 1999. He used his birth name, Scott Albert, for Immortal and for Circle of Dust through their touring years, up until 1995. For the Brainchild side project, Klayton used the alias Tox. Brainchild also gave rise to the handle of Celldweller; an outtake of the album, \\"Heldweller\\", appeared on a compilation in 1993 and friends of Klayton twisted the title into \\"Celldweller\\", applying it to Klayton with the explanation that he spent all his time in his basement, like a prisoner, working on music. For Argyle Park, Klayton appeared as two fictitious band members, Dred and Deathwish, and also used the Celldweller moniker for the first time as the name of the album's producer. Again, in 1996, Klayton appeared on a tribute to Stryper under the slightly altered name Cell Dweller. By 1998, when Klayton had begun working with Criss Angel, he had changed his name from Scott Albert to Klay Scott, explaining in an interview that the name had been given to him by Angel for his ability to \\"take sounds and shape them as if they were clay\\". He appeared as Klay Scott on the Angeldust/Criss Angel Amystika releases and on the posthumous Circle of Dust album Disengage. At this stage he also stated he was done with pseudonyms, preferring to establish one identity under which all of his music projects took shape. However, despite this, Klay's name would change once more by 1999, when he made Celldweller his sole musical output. The simple name of Klayton has stuck ever since, with the artist restating in newer interviews that he was done experimenting with musical personas and does not want to confuse his fans any longer: \\"I've been so guilty of doing a million side projects. I've changed my name on every one of them. It's got to the point when my own fans didn't know whether I worked on an album or not.\\" In a January 2016 question-and-answer video, Klayton explained that \\"Klayton\\" is his legal name, and that he thus no longer answers to the name Scott Albert.

She was known primarily as a sculptor although her oeuvre included significant drawings and paintings. Her work forms an important part of the National Gallery of Jamaica's permanent collection and can be viewed in other public institutions in Jamaica such as Bustamante Children's Hospital, the University of the West Indies, and the Kingston Parish Church. Her early training was in the British neoclassical tradition. In the early 1920s and 1930s she experimented with modernism eventually adapting it to her own aesthetic. Edna Manley was an early supporter of art education in Jamaica. In the 1940s, she organised and taught art classes at the Junior Centre of the Institute of Jamaica. These classes developed in a more formal setting with the establishment of the Jamaica School of Art and Craft in 1950. Jamaica's first Art School would eventually expand into a college and was renamed Edna Manley College of the Visual and Performing Arts in 1995 to honour the artist's pioneering role in Jamaican Art. Edna Manley was also the wife of Norman Manley, the founder of the Jamaican People's National Party and the 1st Premier of Jamaica. She is often considered the \\"mother of Jamaican art\\". Personal life=Early life Born Edna Swithenbank on 28 February 1900, Edna Manley lived out her early years in England with her cleric father, Harvey Swithenbank, her mixed Jamaican mother, Ellie Shearer, and her 8 siblings. Ellie was the sister of Margaret Ann Shearer, who married Thomas Manley, and their son was Norman Washington Manley.https://www.geni.com/people/Margaret- Manley/6000000024119130886 Retrieved 7 September 2020. Her father passed when she was nine, leaving his widow to raise all their nine children by herself. Edna Manley was described as incredibly independent, rebellious and spirited, exemplified in the uproar and unrest she caused among her own family as she embraced her 'coloured' ancestry from her mother's side. This ancestry had been swept under the rug due to the possible repercussions it would have had on not only her parents but he whole family during the racially tense times of the early twentieth century.MEEKS, B. (2015). The Politics of Edna Manley. Caribbean Quarterly, 61(4), 61‚Äì81. https://doi.org/10.1080/00086495.2015.11878851 Education After leaving high school Edna studied art at several different institutions including St. Martin's School of Art in London. She also studied privately with Maurice Harding, the animal sculptor, going on to continue her art studies at the Regent Street Polytechnic as well as the St. Martin's School of Art in London. During this time she had intentions of becoming a zoologist. In 1921, she married her cousin, Norman Manley. The two met when Norman came to England for university, Edna was only 14 at the time and Norman was eight (8) years her senior. They fell out of touch but later reunited after Norman finished school and while Edna was working at a pension office studying art on the side. The two had a controversial union, due to not only family ties but the obvious deepness of Norman's complexion. They went on to have two children, Michael Manley (a future prime minister) and Douglas Manley, a sociologist and minister in his brother's government, moving to Jamaica in 1922 after Douglas's birth. Edna quickly realized how differently the Jamaican Middle class was in comparison to the life she knew in England and kept journals of her thoughts, observations and experiences. Politics The political standings of her husband and children would prove influential to her art as well as impact her life and career in a way she may have never expected. Manley was involved politically, not only through the association of her sons and husband, but also through the subject matter she addressed in her work, such as sexuality, culture and feminism. Manley's feminism influences were arguably due to her a first-wave feminist sister, Lena, who fought alongside the suffragettes for the right to vote for females. Though this did not manifest itself in the same way as her sister, she paved a way of her own unique to Jamaica. She did not fight outright for new wave feminism, but her excellence, notoriety and dominance in the predominantly male world of visual arts, fought in their way. Thoughts around socialism also preoccupied Edna's mind following the years after her marriage. As her sons and husband became more a part of the Jamaican political sphere, forming the People's National Party (PNP), Edna also became more preoccupied with Fabian Socialism ideology and avidly supported the party and its socialist democratic ideals. Politics was a large and unavoidable part of her light and would go on to be further highlighted in her works dome in the 1960s and 1970s when Jamaica was dealing with great civil and political unrest. Later years Norman Manley, her husband, died in 1969 leaving her in ruin. She shared that 'after Norman died, the thing that saved me was my art.'PART TWO: Historical Biographies: EDNA MANLEY.

Retrieved from http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db;=b7h&AN;=42737359&site;=ehost- live In 1975 she decided to delve more into painting, giving up sculpting, due to her age and strain it placed on her body. She maintained her own identity and did not live in the shadow of her famous husband. Edna Manley died on 2 February 1987; a few weeks short of her 87th birthday. She was an amazing woman in the eyes of many; a woman who carved her path independent of the name of her husband or son and continues to influence and inspire many artists to this day. Artistic life The Diggers by Manley Early Artistic Life 1900‚Äì1925 During this period of Edna's life, she faced frustration at the lack of Exhibitions in Jamaica, as well as the attitudes the people had towards art. To her, it seemed as if people only considered it to be an unimportant hobby to be enjoyed by amateurs but that did not deter her. She created her first Jamaican work that would go onto be one of her most notable, The Beadseller (1922). Her early years were a transitional period, not only stylistically, but During this period she centred herself around adapting and understanding her new home in Jamaica. She began moving away from the academic ways of creating that she was so accustomed to, into a truer version of modernism seen in The Beadseller- inspired by these new and exciting observations of life in Jamaica.Boxer, D. (2000). Tribute: The Life of EDNA MANLEY (1900‚Äì1987). In Fifty Years ‚Äì Fifty Artists 1950‚Äì2000: The School of Visual Arts (pp. 13‚Äì14). Ian Randle Publishers. Retrieved from http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db;=b7h&AN;=83813507&site;=ehost- live Shortly after, the Beadseller was followed up by a male counterpart, The Listener (1922) which also reflected the geometric and cubist style she was exploring. This cubist influence can be directly credited to famous artist Pablo Picasso, who disrupted the European art world with his geometric and exploitative creations. Edna Manley was not safe from his influence as she studied all the art trends and ideas circulating in Europe before her departure to the Caribbean. She brought plaster versions of both these works back to England with her in 1923, which she had cast into bronze on her arrival. This would cause her acceptance into the Society of Women's Artists and had Beadseller displayed in their 1924 Exhibition. She would continue to go between Jamaica and England seeking out exhibition spaces and artistic inspiration. Back in Jamaica in early 1924, she quickly set to work with new carving tools and produced Wisdom and then the Ape. At that time, too, she began to model realistic portraits in clay first of Norman and the two-year- old Douglas and then of a friend, Esther Chapman. Then, testing the possibilities of her new medium, she did the head of another friend, Leslie Clerk in wood. During this period of Edna's life, she would end up facing frustration at the lack of Exhibitions in Jamaica, as well as the attitudes the people had towards art. To her, it seemed as if people only considered it to be an unimportant hobby to be enjoyed by amateurs 1925‚Äì1932 Between 1925 and 1929, Manley softened some of her geometric forms, replacing them with more massive, rounded ones. Market Women, a study of two voluptuous women sitting back to back, and Demeter, a carving of the mythical Earth Mother, are indicative of Manley's late-1920s influence. The 1930s saw another change in her sculptural style. She tamed her early-1920s cubist lines with rounder forms, and produced a new, definitive style that lasted into the 1940s. She recalled the strong influence of classical art on her voluptuous sculptures. Her interest in the classical tradition was sparked by the works of Picasso's neo-classicism phase. His Two Nudes of 1906, greatly influenced the neo- classicism of her adolescence. This voluptuousness can also be seen in her work entitled Eve (1929), which derived from the story of the first woman mentioned in the bible. The overall dimension of the work is 2006.6 x 508mm, and was carved from a single piece of mahogany wood. The nude Eve is seen standing on a circular platform with her head facing behind her. The figure has one hand who's fingers are rolled into a fist to cover her pubis; similar to the arm gestures are a combination of the \\"Venus Pudica\\". The other hand is bent at the elbow and covers a breast while the back of the hand awkwardly rests on the shoulder with fingers curled inwards. In this pose of the arm we see the influence of Picasso's Two Nudes. The sculpture is seemingly filled with tension, as suggested by the clenching of the fists, the abnormal twist of the body and the awkward attempt to obscure a breast. The body gives a sense of youthfulness and its long hair flowing downwards onto the chest matches the curvy rhythm of her body. Wayne Brown has described the sculpture as \\"woman startled to look over her shoulder\\" an \\"image of nakedness surprised\\" yet, Manley seemed had removed all traces of expression from the face of the sculpture of her re-interpretation of Eve and instead focused the expressions into the pose of the figure. Her idea of this sculpture was to draw reference to the expulsion of Eve out of the Garden of Eden. The face looking backwards is also said to represent Eve looking back at the garden after her expulsion. During the early 1920s, Edna Manley continuously sent her works back to England for exhibition which allowed the works to become greatly recognized by 1927. The first recognition she had received came from the French press, and her works were published in the Les Artistes D‚ÄôAujourd‚ÄôHui and La Revue Moderne. The author of the articles La Revue Moderne, Clement Morro, had significantly linked her with the modern abstractionists. In 1929, Edna Manley had returned to England with her most recently completed works namely; Eve, The boy and the reed, Torso, The ape (\\"Edna Manley (1900‚Äì1987). This small collection of sculptured has gained entry into the Goupil Summer exhibition which was a major event which took place annually in London. Her move to Jamaica had a profound impact on her work. She abandoned studying zoology back in London, and her work took on a more \\"inspired formal elegance\\", according to Boxer. Manley's materials consisted mostly of native woods‚Äîshe used yakka, mahogany, Guatemalan redwood, juniper cedar, and primavera. Some work dating from her first year on the island are Beadseller, and Listener. In describing Beadseller, Boxer said, \\"It was as if in one fell swoop, nearly a hundred years of sculptural development had been bridged: in this, her first work done in Jamaica, Edna seems to have given expression to her ideas about contemporary British sculpture with which she had saturated herself prior to leaving England. Both pieces exhibited Manley's more progressive and cubist style. Jamaica was facing many political changes during the late 1930s and early 1940s. Members of the African diaspora were looking to do away with the aging colonial system that remained on the island. They were ready for a new social order, and voiced their displeasure with the colonial system by incurring strikes (along with riots), instigating food shortages, and promoting protest marches. Manley's work of the time reflected this civil unrest. Works like \\"Prophet\\", \\"Diggers\\", \\"Pocomania\\", and \\"Negro Aroused\\" \\"caught the inner spirit of our people and flung their rapidly rising resentment of the stagnant colonial order into vivid, appropriate sculptural forms,\\" wrote poet M. G. Smith. Her works were exhibited very frequently in England between 1927 and 1980. Her first solo exhibition in Jamaica was in 1937. The show marked a turning point in Jamaica's undeveloped art movement, and it prompted the first island-wide group show of Jamaican artists. Manley was also one of the founders of the new Jamaica School of Art. After premiering in Jamaica, her show opened in England, where it was received with much fanfare. It was the last time Manley's work would be shown in London for nearly 40 years. Active for much of her life as an artist, she also taught at the Jamaica School of Art, now a component of the Edna Manley College of Visual and Performing Arts. 1930 ‚Äì 1939 1929 brought significant recognition to Edna Manley's early career as a sculptor and artist. This came in the form of Eve which was inspired by Picasso's Two Nudes (1906) and Boy with Reed, a response to Singing Negro statuette (Biblioth√®que Nationale in Paris). These two carvings were exhibited at the summer exhibits at the Goupil Gallery in England and received raved reviews. Eve travelled extensively throughout England's art gallery circuit as her captivating presence was magnetic. Edna and Norman Manley were putting down roots in Jamaica and each was easing into their respective careers with notability. Edna's fledgling art career was taking off and Norman Manley was earning a reputation of being an astute lawyer. Recommendations were well written and submitted for him to be bestowed the enviable appointment of Kings Counsel (KC). This would no doubt boost his law career and came to fruition in August 1932. Despite the financial rewards from his law practice, being among the social elites and awarded the coveted title of KC, Norman Manley struggled with depression seemingly caused from not being able to represent something more meaningful. This sentiment was echoed in his letters to Edna who was away in England due to interest in her art. On returning home to Jamaica, she now too had her own precipitous path to navigate with being a wife, mother and backbone of her family as well as being an artist on the rise. These emotive feelings manifested themselves in the artwork titled Sun and Earth depicting a male and a female in deep embrace, the man's head resting on the chest of the woman. The woman stands erect as a support with one arm around his waist. With the international success of Eve, Boy with Reed and other works such as Dawn, Woman With Basket (in stone), Dance, Sixteen, Seventeen and Rachel the visions of self as an artist and the actual reality of life seems possible and gave her intrinsic strength to carry her family and her art into the unknown future. The aforementioned artworks had a new aesthetic not yet seen anywhere, \\"voluptuous\\" was the word used to describe the pieces. Cubism and other avant- garde movements dominated Europe at the time, but Edna Manley's pieces had an air of freshness to them which sparked countless curiosity all over London. Even though the essence of cubism was evident in her sculptures in terms of the positioning of the forms they did not have that hard angular rendering which was evident in her earlier works such as the Beadseller. By 1934 Jamaica had been experiencing serious economic depression, marked by the decline in exports and the return of disheartened migrant workers from Cuba and Panama. Everywhere in Jamaica persons were clamoring for better pay, more jobs, better job conditions and housing as the common people buckled of under the weight of colonial marginalization. The economic crisis coupled with the agitation for change is creatively summed up in Edna Manley's most famous sculpture, Negro Aroused done in 1935. The sculpture, even though in the round has a high relief quality and depicts an African man with head upturned to the heavens atop square shoulders, a twisting torso and thick slab ‚Äì like arms set in an unusual akimbo position. He seems to be communicating anguish while looking towards the heavens for a solution or the dawning of a better tomorrow. Other notable sculptures created during this time were, Pocomania, Market Woman, The Prayer, Young Negro, The Diggers and The Prophet. The Prophet The Prophet is a carving of an African man with powerful, over-emphasized arms raised above his head, creating a diamond shape. His opened palms are affixed one in front of the other similar to when person is waking up and stretching after a deep sleep. The head is turned to the right, looking slightly down with a stern unapproachable face. There is a backward tilt in the upper torso which creates an open stance. Even though the sculpture is not full bodied and only represented from the tip the fingers down to mid thighs, it provokes a ready to fight alertness, combative stance in every sense. The simplification of the form gives it a towering presence of authority which forces the viewer to contend with the determined stare of the seer. The prophet embodies a warrior spirit that has been awoken and forced into action. It explains how the common people at that time were feeling, like that of a gunpowder keg waiting for that opportunistic spark to explode. Mrs. Manley describes The Prophet as: \\"A figure that denounce, oh powerfully denounced, cruelty, poverty, injustice and it came, the prophet, the Amos who came down from the hills and denounce the world as he saw it. Denounced those that had so much and offered to the poor and weak so little\\". Edna Manley's seemed to be that gauging mirror absorbing and reflecting the plight of the common people through her new found aesthetic. With a significant body of work Mrs. Manley was ready to tackle England's art world, but before she did, she held her first solo show at the Mutual Life Assurance Society building on Barry Street Kingston Jamaica in January 1937. This was the first solo art show for anyone in Jamaica and was extremely successful with over eight hundred person passing through the exhibition. The show lasted for five days but before it ended persons were requesting for the state to purchase Negro Aroused. The sculpture was purchased through organized fundraisers and handed over to the Institute of Jamaica. In England her exhibition opened on the second of March and lasted for twenty three days and was received with \\"lukewarm\\" reviews. Many critics and newspaper articles question her craftsmanship and approach. The lack of political understanding by the English critics who were far removed from the uprisings of political consciousness in Jamaica made it rather difficult for them to truly embrace the significance of the sculptures and only evaluated the pieces based on form. Later that same year Mrs. Manley got sick and spent a lengthy time recuperating. There were great upheavals in Jamaica in 1938, strikes and labour riots caused many arrests and even deaths. No place in Jamaica was spared from the unrest however Westmoreland and Kingston had the biggest foray as the common people pushed for better wages and jobs. A pugnacious agitator for change named Alexander Bustamante was at the front of the line defending the cause of common people, relentless remonstrating landed him in jail. The Peoples National Party (PNP) was also formed by Norman Manley who found his political stride and true purpose which was eluding him for many years. During this time Mrs. Manley completed several pieces of work, notably the piece titled Strike which was a response to the political turbulence going on in the county. The piece not only represented the mood of the people but also captures her deep involvement in political activism with her husband. She also design The Rising Sun logo for the PNP which represented the dawning of Jamaican politics. Other artworks done during 1938 ‚Äì 1939, were Mrs. Molesworth, Tomorrow, Youth, In the Beginning, Idyll and The Sawyers. These carvings were labeled as \\"ecstatic carvings\\" by David Boxer to describe their stylistic similarities in form and movement. Professional life and Horse of the Morning (1940s) Edna Manley produced a number of famed sculpture including, ‚ÄúNegro Aroused‚Äù and many more which are a part of her permanent collection at the National Gallery (NGJ) leaning up to the 1940s. Some of her works between (1935) and (1940), are, \\"Mountain Girl\\", \\"The Prophet\\", and ‚ÄúPocomania\\". \\"Before Thought\\", \\"The Forerunner\\", \\"Before Truth\\", and ‚ÄúInto the Mist‚Äù followed between (1941) and (1948). These are works that expressed her thoughts on her personal life with family relationship. Edna Manley also created works such as Digger, ink on paper (1940), Dispossessed, Sepia wash on paper and many others. According to the book Edna Manley Sculptor by David Boxer, \\"In July 1941, she records in a diary: Oh, but I want to carve my two Gods dark and light. I would like to carve them where the echoes of the mountains would take up the song, where the mists‚Ä¶ round, where there‚Äôs freedom and light and no desire‚Ä¶ I want an icy silence and an icy stillness and an icy loneliness‚Ä¶‚Äú In creating the series Dying God, Edna Manley moves away from the elongated style of 1939/40/41 and began a new style. Accord to the book, \\"It is difficult to define; there are Blakean concepts and motifs, definitely, and motifs occasionally come from other Romantics-Fuseli and Redon perhaps; the works occasionally tend to be 'pictorial' rather than sculptural, yet we sense a unique personal involvement with the materials-yacca, mahogany, Guatemalan redwood, juniper cedar, primavera-and an attempt to capture in these woods the light of Nomdmi\\". Dying God carving are one of Mrs Manley most universal works and according to the book, one of her most private. Leading up to 1943 Mrs. Manley did an extensive amount of carvings such as, New World, Old World on a large scale just to name a few. In these carvings she mainly focused on design and details. According to the book by David Boxer, \\"The most successful carving of the Sun God, however, would abandon this system of the cycle of the sun and revert to the image of the spirited horse of the Forerunner.‚Äù According to Edna Manley the Diary, \\"15 April 1943 the mountains help me to realize that I must not strain to work, not worry over what I produce. For me it must flow lawlessly. Of a choice of flawless and lawless it must be the latter. It was not always so, however\\". =Horse of the Morning (1943)= Mrs. Manley carved Horse of the Morning in 1943, this carving was done using Guatemalan redwood. According to the National Gallery of Jamaica Blog, \\"Her work entered another phase in which she combined private symbolism, inspired by the Jamaican Blue Mountain landscape, with an almost painterly approach to form and surface. Horse of the Morning (1943), which was donated to the collection by Edna Manley‚Äôs son and former Prime Minister of Jamaica, the late Michael Manley, is arguably the best known work of this cycle.‚Äù Mrs. Manley went on to explained Horse of the Morning‚Äôs genesis: according to the book by David Boxer, \\"It was early in the morning‚Ä¶ I wanted to watch the dawn come up, and I went along the little path behind the house, and I did see him leap from behind the mountains. I saw him‚Ä¶ he was there for an instant and then he was gone. But I did see him\\". The book further went on to state that the, \\"Horse of the Morning presents a specific aspect of the Sun God, namely his sexual, libidinous self. Caught in a moment of searing erotic intensity with phallic leg and carefully articulated \\"ping pong ball\\" eyes that red both on the suns and as symbols of a fully charged sexuality‚Äù.  Professional life 1950s  Edna Manley promoted the development of Jamaican art as a teacher, coordinator and patron and contributed in the founding of the Jamaica school of art and craft in 1950. Although the 1950s and 1960s were less active years for Edna Manley, she produced a few works. National Gallery of Jamaica In 1951, Edna Manley was tasked her first public commission which involved the creation of a crucifix for the all saints Anglican church in downtown Kingston, The crucifix was devoted in commemoration of Joseph Francis an elder of the church on 10 December 1951. The sculpture of these years were subsequently secluded pieces and usually they were commissioned work. The year of 1952 was spent tussling with ideas for a competition in Britain for a monument to the unknown political prisoner. In May she began a small carving, the carving in fact a preparatory carving in the true sense and was quite independent of the ideas for the monument. The Secret is a charismatic work in which is in smaller format and has a basic idea of night. Moreover, from this period is a small satin wood plaque, designed to fit into the center of a gramophone cabinet this commission came from Noel Coward. He had recognized a home on the north coast of the island. Its attitude is one significant to that of the secret but its subject, the two heads of a man and a woman, with hands raised in characteristics Manley gesture represents an intimate dialogue between the sexes. Edna Manley titled it the mountains. The exception of a small terracotta mountain woman dated 1956, no sculpture has surface from the period 1952 to 1958 although there is evidence that other terracottas from this period may exist. We also know that an exhibition of drawing was planned for the institute of Jamaica in 1954 but even this was cancelled because there was not enough new works to warrant the exhibition. Edna did take part in tercentenary exhibition held at the institution of Jamaica in November 1955.

He is the herald of the new Jamaica charging forth and claiming his \\"place in the sun\\". in 1958 the chips started flying again and an impressive coda to the dying god series, growth resulted the basic idea involves themes exposited in the independent work such as the Sun God Heads of 1941 and The Horse of the Morning of 1943. The horse of the morning surmounted by the sun god, a head of infinite wisdom and energy. The link between the two zones in the top most figure of the bank of the sleeping figures who just begins to lift his head and opens his eyes as he re-awakes to another existence. Growth was completed in time for its inclusive in the all island exhibition of sculpture which opened in October 1958 at the institution of Jamaica, at which time it was acquired by the institute. In 1959, it saw the creation of a far more intimate carving a commission from friends the artist chose as the subject a young girl endearing embracing a small goat. Inspired by her 12-year-old granddaughter Rachel, who had come to Jamaica to live with Edna and Norman in 1949, which speaks to a since innocence. Into the Sun (1954) Into the Sun is an inventive reproduction of Edna Manley's work. It depicts a colored man in the foreground hugged on to a white horse; the horse is situated in a galloping pose and the figure on him clamps on tightly to the horse with his left arm stretched out pointing forward. The background shows two different times of day and uses the sun and moon in symbolizing the difference between each side. Beneath him lies a green mountain with two different shades of green. The side of the mountain to the left with a night-like background expresses to be darker than that side which has a day background. It also gives the indication of the horse and the man riding towards the sun. however, the iconography of the horse appears in other works in the decade such as Only the Brave, where a male and a female are joined in one silhouette situated on the mountain top. There two horse comes to rear up beside them. The horse of the night and the horse of the morning. The moon and sun are also symbolized in this piece and reign in the sky. Similarly, the Growth. The 1950s and 60s were deemed crucial periods in which Edna Manley‚Äôs iconography was being developed. Finding many codas to the Dying God Cycle such as the mahogany relief Growth (1958) and the drawing Into the Sun (1954) and none but the Brave (1960) as well as the anthropomorphic mountain imagery of the mountains. \\"Negro Aroused\\" ‚Äì the art piece While she was at London, Manley had discovered that the people of Jamaica had collected the money to buy her piece \\"Negro Aroused\\". Individuals pitched in whatever they could afford, purchasing the piece to begin a national art collection. She was highly moved by this act, partly because she claimed that it was such a difficult piece for her to create: \\"Negro Aroused,...was trying to create a national vision, and it nearly killed me, it was trying to put something into being that was bigger than myself and almost other than myself,\\" Manley told Sculpture Review. The original sculpture of \\"Negro Aroused\\" was created in 1935 and was first exhibited in 1937. From its exposure, \\"Negro Aroused\\" excited the public's imagination; it was acquired by public subscription and presented to the Institute of Jamaica to form a nucleus for its modern art collection. This collection in 1974 became the basis for the National Gallery of Jamaica collection. In 1977, work began to enlarge the sculpture and to create a monument to the workers of Jamaica and the Worker's Movement that was born in 1938. Edna Manley was commissioned to recreate the work in bronze, at a scale three to four times that of the original. She was assisted by several young sculptors. Prior to being shipped to New York for bronzing, the seven-foot version was destroyed in a warehouse fire. In 1982, Manley produced a third version, closer in size to the original, but it incorporated some subtle changes she had introduced in the destroyed sculpture. In 1991, the sculpture was posthumously enlarged by utilizing the \\"scaling up\\" technique of bronze foundries for the enlargement of a sculpture. The third version was selected because it was closer in size to the destroyed version. The cost was met by public subscription. Professional life (1960s) and The Bogle Statue  Norman Manley entered politics, and founded the People's National Party in 1938. Although Edna Manley was hesitant at first, she quickly accepted her husband's place‚Äîand her own‚Äîin Jamaican politics. She also designed The Rising Sun logo for the People's National Party. The beginning of Jamaica's new government-‚Äîand the fall of colonialism-‚Äîwas reflected in Manley's work, which at the time dealt with the cyclical, birth-and-death themes of the sun and moon. Her work was also heavily influenced by the nature that surrounded her at Nomdmi, the mountain retreat she had built with her husband. Many commissions awaited Edna Manley in the 60s such as Mother and Child Tondo for the Children's Hospital and The Bush which was not Consumed for the Webster United Church. Edna Manley has always been interested in Rastafarians and in 1961, she made a series of drawings using young Rastafarians which served as the backbone for her carving Brother Man. This helped her to come to terms with her philosophy was seen as suspicious and regarded with animosity. The 1950s and 1960s were quiet times for Manley as an artist. Her husband became more involved with politics, becoming the chief minister of Jamaica in 1955. Manley's responsibilities as the wife of a politician left little time for art. In 1958, she designed the Flag of the West Indies Federation. She held her third exhibition at the Hills Galleries in 1960 (gallery opened in 1953), where she only showed drawings as she had very little time to maker sculptures due to the opposition politics of Norman Manley and the People's National Party. Her works were mostly of women and having mythological concepts. A few of these works include Youth Early and Night Flower. One of her works I Saw My Land (1960) shows the significance of Norman Manley to Jamaica as his goal was to deliver the country. In 1965, she created a statue of Paul Bogle to commemorate his martyrdom in Jamaica's 1865 Morant Bay Rebellion. The Morant Bay Rebellion was due to unrepresentative nature of the Jamaican government and the economic problems that Jamaica was suffering from during this time. This meant that the mass of black Jamaicans had no feeling of being represented by their government. Paul Bogle was the leader and was hanged as punishment as he led the last large scale rebellion for voting rights and an end to legal discrimination and economic oppression against African Jamaicans faced and due to his ability to stand tall and take charge he was recognized as a national hero in Jamaica in 1969. The statue was highly controversial because it was the first Jamaican public monument to depict a black man in Jamaica. The statue was a commission in 1964 by Edward Seaga commemoration of the centenary of the Morant Bay Rebellion She was unable to get a proper description as there were not photographs available of Bogle at the time. This caused Edna to then see information elsewhere as this was very vague, they quoted that he was \\"black and shiny heavy marks of smallpox on face, especially on nose‚Ä¶large mouth, red thick lips; about five feet eight inches tall, broad shoulders‚Ä¶ no whiskers.\\", so she visited Stony Gut and received a bit of information from an old woman who had said \\"But, Bogle was a BOLD man.\\" the form of the statue was created and it was seen as a symbol of Bogle. She made various Maquette and sketches of Bogle. The statue has been in front of the Morant Bay Courthouse. The 'Bogle' statue was made in 1965. She made numerous maquettes as her ideas constantly changed and her visions for the statue fluctuated. the finished piece stood tall and upright with a machete in hand having the blade point downwards. both elbows raised as his hands firmly held the machete showing his seriousness and passion. Prominent muscles and rib cage are seen along with sunken cheeks, broad nose and big eyes. This piece was seen as controversial once an image of how Paul Bogle actually looks surfaced as Morant Bay stakeholders wanted a new statue to be done that really looked like Bogle. The photographer is unknown. When Edna arrived to Morant Bay Court to put up the statue, she was met with rage from Bogle's followers wanting him alive and Edna was smug with her responses yet polite. Manley returned, in her personal carvings, to the animal sculptures that she did as a young woman. Norman Manley became ill in August 1968 with a respiratory illness, which got worse by 6 October. he had various illnesses such as his blood pressure was giving him problems. Edna Manley stated, \\" He woke at night with his first attack of cardiac asthma\\". In 1968, Edna Manley was commissioned to make a Mary where she captured emotion using geometry rather than facial expression and entitled it The Grief of Mary. Within a year of the completion of the work, by 1969, Edna Manley's husband (Norman Manley) had died on 2 September and buried at the National Heroes Park. After Norman Manley's death, Edna started her mourning period. He had helped Jamaica to achieve total independence from Britain and self-government by 1962. Manley's carvings during this period were very personal‚Äî-reflections on her husband's death, her pain, and sense of loss. She retreated to the mountains and created \\"Adios,\\" a piece interpreted as lovers in a last embrace, and \\"Woman,\\" an agonized woman in reclusion. Before Norman died, Edna created a small, rough clay study of an angel cradling a small figure in one of its wings upwards reaching for the heavens. it is as if she knew in her heart that he would die soon. The end of this grieving period was marked by her creation of the triumphant \\"Mountain Women\\". She had accepted the loss of her husband. \\"I felt that because my roots were here in Jamaica, I could survive,\\" she told Americas. \\"It was my return to the world after that period of intense grief. After creating several more profound carvings, including \\"Faun\\", \\"Message\\" and \\"Journey\\", Manley gave her carving tools away to a young Jamaican sculptor and declared that she would never work with wood again. Instead, she worked with modeled terracotta or plaster casts. During the 1970s, the major themes of Manley's work were expressions of her \\"grandmother,\\" or \\"old woman\\" image, of matriarchal society, and memories of her life with her husband Norman. Manley continued to sculpt until her death in 1987. Although a great deal of her work was intensely personal, she created a body of sculpture that embodies Jamaican culture and spirit. English novelist Sir Hugh Walpole, a collector of her work, spoke at the opening of her 1937 London show. \\"There is a very strange and curious spirit there and Mrs. Manley has got within that strange spirit,\\" he remarked. \\"There is in Jamaica a beauty that finds its expression through her, that comes partly from the Jamaican material she uses, partly from her own individuality, and partly also, I think, from the sort of sense of beauty that the different people of Jamaica themselves possess.\\" For Manley, expressing the beauty of Jamaica was second nature. \\"I carve as a Jamaican for Jamaica,\\" she told Americas, \\"trying to understand our problems and living near to the heart of our people.\\" Professional life 1970s‚Äì88 The late 1960s- early 1970s were a sad period in Edna Manley's life, where her husband Norman Manley was ill and passed away. Most of her works during this mourning period were intense and expresses grief, some of these works are: Angel (1970), Kingston parish church, Journey (1974), National Gallery of Jamaica Woman (1971), Adios (1971). Journey was the last wooden carving done by Edna Manley, all her works after that was modeled in clay and cast, she started exploring other Medias like drawing and painting. According to the book Edna Manley Sculptor by David Boxer \\"After a short break which saw the five completed Mourning Carvings exhibited at the Bolivar Gallery in an enormously successful one-man exhibition (her first include sculpture since 1948), Edna returned once again to carving and two more works were added to the series.‚Äù The book also states \\"it is a symbol of the inner, frightened self and while she was carving the Faun, the initial ideas for Journey began to surface.‚Äù Manley played a major role in helping her husband fight for Jamaicans independence and despite her husband's death she continued to play a major role in the cultural development of Jamaica. Between 1970‚Äì1974 Edna Manley did two solo exhibitions, in 1971 she did one at Bolivar Gallery, Kingston with eighteen sculptures and the other in 1973 at Spelman College, Atlanta, Georgia, with fifteen sculptures and three drawings. In 1972 Manley's son Michael Manly succeeded his father to become the prime minister of Jamaica after a turmoil election period. Ghetto Mother Ghetto Mother was a sculpture done by Edna Manley in 1981. It shows five characters, with the larger character seeming to be the mother looking to the sky with a sad look on her face while the other four characters around her seeming to be her children have gestures and facial expressions of sadness and fear. There are two children to the front and two in the back, one of the two in the front has two hands on its jaw and the other child is kneeling down in a praying position. The child to the left at the back has his hand in his mouth and the one on the left has his hand on his chest. The mother seems to be kneeling down by the positioning of her hands. Death According to Edna Manley: Sculptor a Retrospective: \\"During Edna Manley‚Äôs final years, she re-created several older works, some of which are on view in the introductory lobby. Perhaps the finest re-creation is tomorrow (1985) which is based on one of the major examples of ecstatic carvings of the late 1930s. The same ecstatic, spiritual atmosphere prevails in most of Edna Manley‚Äôs last works and several ponder on the subject of death and rebirth. This is movingly illustrated by such works as The Listener (1986), future (1983), the painting Birth (1986) and the studies for Raising of Lazarus on which the artist was working until the day before her death on 10 February 1987.‚Äù When Edna Manley died in 1987, she was accorded an official funeral and buried in the tomb of Norman Manley at the National Heroes Park, her work having earned her the unofficial title of \\"Mother of Jamaican Art\\" Works Her works include: \\"Whisper\\"; \\"Into The Mist\\", \\"Before Thought \\", \\"Moon\\", \\"Eve (Ceremonial Dance)\\",Sheffield's Collections: Edna Manley. \\"Into The Sun\\", \\"Growth\\", \\"The Ancestor\\", \\"The Mother\\", \\"Negro Aroused\\", \\"Pocomania\\", \\"Diggers\\", \\"Man and Woman\\", \\"Bead Sellers \\", \\"The Trees are Joyful\\", \\"Rainbow Serpent\\", \\"Rising Sun\\", \\"Prophet\\", \\"Ghetto Mother\\", \\"Mountain Women\\" and others mentioned above. Legacy The Jamaican School of Art was renamed the Edna Manley College of the Visual & Performing Arts in 1995 to commemorate her life; enduring legacy; and impact on Jamaican art, Caribbean Art and the art world as whole. The renaming of the institution was part of its reclassification as a tertiary institution. Edna Manley was selected in part because of her contributions to Jamaica's art, which included co-founding the school in 1950, a school that is still the only of its kind in the English-speaking Caribbean. A long list of awards and prizes were awarded to her in lifetime, including: * Silver Musgrave Medal of the Institute of Jamaica (1929) * Gold Musgrave Medal of the Institute of Jamaica (1943) * Honorary Degree of Doctor of Letters from the University of the West Indies (1975) * The Order of Merit (Jamaica, 1986) Diaries Her granddaughter Rachel Manley edited her diaries which were published in 1998.Edna Manley: the Diaries; edited by Rachel Manley.

It was the first film cast entirely with the people from previous reality television series. It was filmed during the E! behind-the-scenes reality show Kill Reality. The film is about a woman who awakes one night to find her fiance in bed with her best friend. The woman is murdered in the ensuing struggle. Seventeen months later her spirit still inhabits the house and unleashes her wrath on the unfaithful new tenants of the house. The movie first premiered in a PG-13 version on October 31, 2005. Plot Raina (Schneider) tells her best friend, Nichola, that she and her fiance Matt (Guiney) have been arguing. Nichola -- who happens to be living in a room of the couple's beach house -- assures her that it's merely \\"pre-wedding jitters,\\" and voices a recurring line: \\"Your happily ever after is just around the corner.\\" The two return home, and it's not long before Matt and Raina run into yet another argument, resulting in Matt storming from the house in anger. Later that night, Raina awakens and begins to search the house for Matt. She is horrified to encounter him in bed with Nichola, and she storms from the room. The lovers slash her throat in the ensuing struggle. Mortally wounded, Raina stumbles into a pool of water, floating helplessly. Seventeen months pass, and four friends decide to rent out the long-abandoned beach house together, completely unaware of its dark history. The four are couples, and are secretly cheating on each other. This, of course, enrages Raina's ghost, and she disposes of the \\"cheaters\\" through the creative means of a staircase (DQ (Fairplay)), pulling them into the earth (Angie (Morasca)), and even through an explosive lava lamp (Seth (Lehmkuhl) and Jennifer (Cooley)). While the survivors -- including the leading couple, Kirsten (Lewis) and Oliver (Hill) -- desperately try to figure out what's happening, they soon find themselves dealing with an eccentric named Murry (Zohn) who uses their property to \\"communicate with Raina's spirit.\\" Murry reveals that Raina is, indeed, responsible for the deaths. Soon, Kirsten and Oliver find themselves caught between two stories -- one from Matt, and another from the slightly volatile Nichola. Through both stories, it can be surmised that, immediately following the accident, Matt told Nichola to flee to Mexico, promising to come rescue her once the entire problem was resolved. When the police arrived, however, Matt told them that Nichola had inflicted the wound on Raina, and that she had stolen quite a good deal of property. Thus, Nichola was stranded in Mexico and had taken the entire rap for the accident. Angry, she sneaks back over the border to seek revenge. Meanwhile, Kirsten realizes that she has been acting quite strangely, and feels a strange connection to Raina. Murry explains that this is not demonic possession, as it may appear, but Raina is merely making Kirsten feel what she feels. This leads to several instances of Kirsten acting quite strangely. For example, when Nichola tries to explain to the couple her side of the story, an enraged Kirsten blows up on her, and the two scuffle. Also, she has a vision of killing her ex-boyfriend Oliver, as he long ago allegedly cheated on her. This connection is vital to the storyline, as it compels Kirsten and Oliver to solve this problem, not retreat from it. Kirsten and Oliver learn that Raina did not actually die, but is in a coma in a nearby hospital. Soon only Matt, Kirsten, and Oliver remain in the mystery -- as the other characters met certain doom (Matt kills Murray after he confronts him; and Nichola gets dragged by Raina's spirit into the pool) -- and it is at this point that Raina wakes up. Disoriented, she staggers for the beach house for the final confrontation. In a heated finale, Matt attacks Kirsten, who is saved by Oliver, and Raina is finally able to confront Matt. She utters what became the movie's slogan: \\"All those cheaters...they all deserve to die!\\" She loses her will to live, and she tears open the skin that has grown over the slash on her neck. Matt falls to the floor soon after, landed on the fire poker that he originally wounded Raina with, and the two die with their fingers interlocked. At the end of the movie, Kirsten and Oliver remain alive and well, and have made amends. Ready to escape this mystery, they depart from the hospital. The movie ends with a plot twist: Nichola is not dead, but in a coma, which she wakes from as the credits roll.

Biography Born in Greenwich, south-east London, Thompson entered Girton College, Cambridge, in 1942. During the war, her work as an industrial draughtswoman for Royal Dutch Shell interrupted her formal education. Nonetheless, she continued to pursue a career in history and was politically active. She joined the Young Communists, married the historian Edward Thompson in 1948, and moved to Halifax, where Edward worked in adult education and they were both active in the peace movement. They had three children. Kate Thompson, the award-winning children's writer, is their youngest child.\\"The music of time\\" - Julia Eccleshare talks to Kate Thompson, winner of the 2005 Guardian Children's Fiction prize, The Guardian, 1 October 2005. With husband E. P. Thompson, she was part of the dissenting group in the Communist Party of Great Britain which in 1956-7 set up the socialist humanist journal the New Reasoner, where her competence meant her principal role was \\"business manager\\". While she found the break with the Communist Party painful, she was inspired working with writers, artists, historians and trade unionists in the formation of new left clubs in many towns; she admired such figures as the Scottish miners' champion Lawrence Daly and clothing worker Gertie Roche. In 1970 Thompson was appointed a lecturer in the School of History at the University of Birmingham, where she remained until 1988. She was also a visiting scholar on a number of occasions at universities in the United States, as well as in Canada, China and Japan. The Early Chartists (1971) was a groundbreaking collection of documents. The Chartists (1984) set out all the ways in which Thompson sought to revise how Chartism was seen - from the Irish leaders to the vital contribution of women. In January 1995 Thompson was presented with a festschrift, The Duty of Discontent. Edited by Owen Ashton, Stephen Roberts (both her former students) and Robert Fyson, the volume consists of 12 essays spanning the whole range of nineteenth- and twentieth-century British social history. The title was taken from a lecture by Chartist poet Thomas Cooper. The importance of Thompson's writings on Chartism and Irish and women's history is recognised by scholars internationally. Her work, like that of her husband, was always been informed by a passionate radicalism and a deep sympathy for the underdog. Thompson's position as the most influential historian of Chartism has been reinforced by two volumes of essays: Outsiders (1993) and The Dignity of Chartism (2015).

Now dead or defunct, it was named after Petersburg, Virginia, and founded by Dionysius Oliver in 1786 to serve the rapidly growing Broad River Valley region of Georgia (Coulter 1965:32). It enjoyed connection via pole boat with Augusta, Georgia, following the Savannah River (Coulter 1965:49). Petersburg gained importance as a tobacco inspection station, vital to local planters in obtaining good prices for their casked produce. During the peak of its prosperity, from 1800 to 1810, it was the third-largest city in Georgia, after Savannah and Augusta (Jones Jr. 1878:233-239). Sibbald described the town in his 1801 Pinelands of Georgia: > PETERSBURG, in point of situation and commercial consequence is second only > to Augusta. It is situated on a point of Land, formed by Broad river, where > it empties into Savannah river; is a handsome well built Town and presents > to the view of the astonished traveller, a Town which has risen out of the > Woods in a few years, as if by enchantment: It has two Warehouses for the > Inspection of Tobacco: Is fifty miles North west from Augusta. On another > point of land on the opposite side of Broad river is the town of Lincoln > [Lisbon?], which has an Inspection for Tobacco, some Stores, &c.; On the > opposite shore in South-Carolina, is the town of Vienna, which has a number > of houses, Stores, a tobacco-inspection, &c.;' (Sibbald 1801:62-63) Longstreet described the town ca. 1806 to 1809 in connection with an annual exhibition at Moses Waddel's nearby Willington Academy. > Petersburg was quite an active, busy, commercial little town. It was > situated in the fork of the Savannah and Broad Rivers, and contained some > eight or ten stores, with the usual supplement of grog shops, and the very > unusual supplement of a billiard-table. Notwithstanding these last, the > citizens of the place were generally remarkable for their refinement, > respectability, intelligence and hospitality. The dwelling houses far > outnumbered the stores and shops. It was separated from Lisbon by Broad > River, and from Vienna by the Savannah. Lisbon we believe could never boast > of more than two stores and a groggery, and as many dwellings. Vienna > surpassed Lisbon in everything, but exactly how far, and in what we are not > able to say, except in John Glover's house and store, which had no match in > Lisbon. (Longstreet 1864:4 and 129) Notable persons from the Broad River Valley area included William Wyatt Bibb, who practiced medicine in Petersburg, and was elected as a U. S. Representative from Georgia. He went on to serve in the U.S. Senate (1813-1816), moved to Alabama when appointed by the President as the Territorial Governor, and in 1819 was elected as the first Governor of that state (Coulter 1965:41-44). Charles Tait was brought with his family to the area in 1783 and served in the U.S. Senate (1809-1818), making Petersburg the home of concurrent Senators (Coulter 1965:44-45). George Rockingham Gilmer, born in Wilkes County and a pupil of Waddel's Academy, was elected U. S. Representative in the 1820s and Governor of Georgia 1829-1831 and 1837-1839. 'Petersburg Boat' extensively used along Upper Savannah River until the late 19th century The town had a brief life; it was not developed until after the American Revolutionary War and after 1810 its population started declining, until it was abandoned. After the last person left, the buildings deteriorated, and the area finally reverted to agricultural land. The last known sale of a numbered lot occurred in 1837 (Elliott 1988:113-116). Several reasons have been advanced for the decline. The tobacco monopoly was squeezed out by cotton, which was 'thrown upon boats all along the river without being inspected' (Sherwood 1837:215). Other reasons given were the advent of steamboats (which were not practicable above Augusta). Later, the rivers proved to be obstacles to construction of railroads through the area, considered essential for the economic life of towns after 1850. But above all, the opportunity of new land to the west available for development attracted its inhabitants to keep moving west.(Coulter 1965:167-173). The Petersburg post office was moved to nearby Lisbon, Georgia in 1844, and closed in 1855 (Krak√≥w 1999:174-175). The town of Vienna, South Carolina also declined and disappeared. The town is best remembered today for its 'Petersburg boats', a pole boat of ten tons' carrying capacity well suited for the stretch of river between Petersburg and Augusta. It was in common use until well after the American Civil War (Coulter 1965:63-64).  Geography  Petersburg was located at 33¬∞57'48\\"N, 82¬∞34'13\\"W (WGS84/NAD83), at the confluence of the Broad and Savannah Rivers, 75 river miles above Augusta, and 305 river miles above Savannah (Tanner 1833). The 86 lots first laid out by Oliver occupied an area of about 40 acres (Coulter 1965:34). Population as reported by the U.S. Census of 1810 was 332, including slaves, and earlier may have numbered twice as many (Coulter 1965:73). The site is now mostly submerged by Clarks Hill Lake, but visitors to Bobby Brown State Park can see foundations during low water (Augusta Chronicle, 3 February 2013). Maritime historians and archaeologists conducted a multidisciplinary investigation on the submerged ruins of the town in 1988 (Elliott 1988 and 1995).

As with other forms of scientific misconduct, it is the intent to deceive that marks fabrication as highly unethical and different from scientists deceiving themselves. If confirmed, the scientist in question typically faces the end of their career. They are no longer eligible for scientific grants, and their publications may be revoked. In some jurisdictions, fabrication may be illegal. Examples of activities that constitute fabrication include: * Outright synthesis of experimental data; reporting experiments that were never conducted. Sometimes referred to as \\"drylabbing\\".David Chandler: WTC7: NIST Finally Admits Freefall (Part I) * \\"Fudging\\", \\"massaging\\", or outright manufacture of experimental data. Some forms of unintentional academic incompetence or malpractice can be difficult to distinguish from intentional fabrication. Examples of this include the failure to account for measurement error, or the failure to adequately control experiments for any parameters being measured. Fabrication can also occur in the context of undergraduate or graduate studies wherein a student fabricates a laboratory or homework assignment. Such cheating, when discovered, is usually handled within the institution, and does not become a scandal within the larger academic community (as cheating by students seldom has any academic significance).  Consequences  A finding that a scientist engaged in fabrication will often mean the end to his or her career as a researcher. Scientific misconduct is grounds for dismissal of tenured faculty, as well as for forfeiture of research grants. Given the tight-knit nature of many academic communities, and the high stakes involved, researchers who are found to have committed fabrication are often effectively (and permanently) blacklisted from the profession, with reputable research organizations and universities refusing to hire them; funding sources refusing to sponsor them or their work, and journals refusing to consider any of their articles for publication. In some cases, however, especially if the researcher is senior and well-established, the academic community can close ranks to prevent injury to the scientist's career. Fabricators may also have previously earned academic credentials removed. Two cases: * In 2004, Jan Hendrik Sch√∂n was stripped of his doctorate degree by the University of Konstanz after a committee formed by Bell Labs found him guilty of fabrication related to research done during his employment there. This action was undertaken even though Sch√∂n was not accused (in the matter in question) of any fabrication or other misconduct relating to his work which led to or supported the degree‚Äîthe doctorate was revoked, according to University officials, solely due to Sch√∂n behaving \\"unworthily\\" in the Bell Labs affair. * In 2001, peer reviewers at the academic journal Nutrition raised suspicions about a publication draft submitted by Dr. Ranjit Chandra, a world-renowned Canadian nutrition researcher at Memorial University of Newfoundland. It was confirmed through investigation that Dr. Chandra had published the results of a series of studies, stretching over more than a decade, which reported claims based on incorrectly represented analysis of, in some cases, non-existent data. By that time, Dr. Chandra had already been invited to the Order of Canada, which was subsequently revoked in 2015. Dr. Chandra retired in 2002, and Memorial University established the Marilyn Harvey Award to Recognize the Importance of Research Ethics in honour of the nurse researcher who first raised the alarm about Dr. Chandra's findings in the early 1990s. . Not all alleged fraud is found to be so, and debates are part of the scientific community. An interesting case is the accusation against Dr. Margaret Mead, a world-renowned anthropologist who published field work conducted early in her life, which proclaimed that Samoan culture was more relaxed and harmonious about sexual relations and mores. Her truthfulness and research process were roundly criticized by a later researcher in Samoa, Dr. Freeman. More recently, Dr. Freeman's own research quality has come under scrutiny, with a hint that perhaps his own views on sexuality and his research with Elders in Samoa led him to reject Dr. Mead's findings. Dr. Freeman's allegations harmed Dr. Mead's reputation at a time when few women were scientists  See also  *Retraction *Junk science  References  Category:Scientific misconduct ","title":"Fabrication (science)"},{"id":"3552709","text":"Henry \\"Hank\\" Melson Stommel (September 27, 1920 ‚Äì January 17, 1992) was a major contributor to the field of physical oceanography. Beginning in the 1940s, he advanced theories about global ocean circulation patterns and the behavior of the Gulf Stream that form the basis of physical oceanography today. Widely recognized as one of the most influential and productive oceanographers of his time, Stommel was both a groundbreaking theoretician and an astute, seagoing observer.  Early life and education  Stommel was born in Wilmington, Delaware. An anomaly among modern scientists, Stommel became a full professor without an earned doctorate. He received his B.S. in astronomy from Yale University (1942) and served there as instructor in mathematics and astronomy (1942‚Äì44).  Academic posts  He was research associate at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution from 1944 to 1959 where the Office of Naval Research generously supported his projects.Henry Stommel. (1958). The Gulf Stream: A Physical and Dynamical Description. Berkeley: University of California. \\"Preface\\" p. x. He became professor of oceanography at Harvard University in 1959 and moved to Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1963, where he remained until 1978, returning to Woods Hole until his retirement. Stommel established the PANULIRUS station (begun in 1954) in Bermuda. PANULIRUS was the name of a wooden, round bilged research vessel (thus R/V Panulirus) operated by the Bermuda Biological Station for Research for many years. On a monthly schedule, the vessel obtained sea water samples a vertical intervals from the surface to great depths, which yielded temperature, salinity and some additional chemical data. Because the sea bottom falls away very sharply, particularly to the East-south-east of Bermuda, it is possible to obtain a representative sampling within a few miles of land. The resulting data set constitutes the longest such data series of similar character in the North Atlantic Ocean. Stommel was elected to the National Academy of Sciences in 1962 and received the National Medal of Science in 1989.  Discoveries  Henry Stommel showed that the north-south gradient of the strength of the horizontal Coriolis force (the \\"beta effect\\") was responsible for the observed fact that the return flow of the slow interior gyre circulations is concentrated in fast moving western boundary currents, such as the Gulf Stream and the Kuroshio Current, a process known as western intensification. As a result, these western boundary currents have a larger and steadier transport than the corresponding boundary currents, such as the California Current and Canary Current, on the eastern side of the ocean basins. In subtropical latitudes, the western boundary currents are important in transporting the excess heat the earth receives in the tropics towards the poles. Together with Arnold Arons, Stommel extended this circulation to the deep ocean, proposing a global circulation in which surface water sinks in the polar regions to feed the deep boundary currents on the western sides of basins, while the interior flow actually moves towards the pole. This work, based on laboratory studies, predated the discovery of such boundary currents, and remains one of the great triumphs of theoretical physical oceanography. Stommel also developed early models of the thermohaline circulation which suggested that it might have more than one stable state. In addition to his work on large-scale ocean currents, Stommel did research on a variety of problems in oceanography and meteorology. These include work on the classification of estuaries, estimates of turbulent diffusion, and studies of the impact of volcanoes on climate.  Marriage  Stommel married Elizabeth Brown, daughter of Huntington Brown, professor of English at the University of Minnesota, and Elizabeth Waldo Wentworth Brown, originally of Boston, on December 6, 1950. They had three children: Matthew (a professional fisherman in Falmouth, Massachusetts), Elijah (a physician at the Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center), and Abigail Stommel Adams (a nurse practicing in Falmouth).

Specifically, marine engineering is the discipline of applying engineering sciences, including mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, electronic engineering, and computer science, to the development, design, operation and maintenance of watercraft propulsion and on-board systems and oceanographic technology. It includes but is not limited to power and propulsion plants, machinery, piping, automation and control systems for marine vehicles of any kind, such as surface ships and submarines. History Archimedes is traditionally regarded as the first marine engineer, having developed a number of marine engineering systems in antiquity. Modern marine engineering dates back to the beginning of the Industrial Revolution (early 1700s). In 1712, Thomas Newcomen, a blacksmith, created a steam powered engine to pump water out of mines. In 1807, Robert Fulton successfully used a steam engine to propel a vessel through the water. Fulton's ship used the engine to power a small wooden paddle wheel as its marine propulsion system. The integration of a steam engine into a watercraft to create a marine steam engine was the start of the marine engineering profession. Only twelve years after Fulton‚Äôs Clermont had her first voyage, the Savannah marked the first sea voyage from America to Europe. Around 50 years later the steam powered paddle wheels had a peak with the creation of the Great Eastern, which was as big as one of the cargo ships of today, 700 feet in length, weighing 22,000 tons. Paddle steamers would become the frontrunners of the steamship industry for the next thirty years till the next type of propulsion came around.Kane, J.R. (1971). Marine Engineering. New York: SNAME(page 2-3) In 1896, Henry L. Williams made the first oil platforms.Bruce A. Wells, (2003) Offshore Petroleum History, American Oil and Gas Historical Society. Retrieved 4/10/14 http://aoghs.org/offshore-exploration/offshore-oil-history/ Marine engineering specialties=Naval architect Naval architects are concerned with the overall design of the ship and its propulsion through the water. Mechanical engineering Mechanical engineers design the main propulsion plant, the powering and mechanization aspects of the ship functions such as steering, anchoring, cargo handling, heating, ventilation, air conditioning interior and exterior communication, and other related requirements. Electrical power generation and electrical power distribution systems are typically designed by their suppliers; only installation is the design responsibility of the marine engineer. Oceanographic engineering Oceanographic engineering is concerned with mechanical, electrical, and electronic, and computing technology deployed to support oceanography, and also falls under the umbrella of marine engineering, especially in Britain, where it is covered by the same professional organisation, the IMarEST. Offshore engineering Civil engineering for an offshore environment, the design and construction of fixed and floating marine structures, such as oil platforms and offshore wind farms is generally called offshore engineering. Challenges specific to marine engineering=Hydrodynamic loading In the same way that civil engineers design to accommodate wind loads on building and bridges, maritime engineers design to accommodate a ship being flexed or a platform being struck by waves millions of times in its life. Stability A naval architect, like an airplane designer, is concerned with stability. The naval architect's job is different, insofar as a ship operates in two fluids simultaneously: water and air. Engineers also face the challenge of balancing cargo as the mass of the ship increase and the center of gravity shifts higher as additional containers are stacked vertically. In addition, the weight of fuel presents a problem as the pitch of the ship cause the weight to shift with the liquid causing an imbalance. This offset is counteracted by water inside larger ballast tanks. Engineers are faced with the task of balancing and tracking the fuel and ballast water of a ship. Corrosion The chemical environment faced by ships and offshore structures is far harsher than nearly anywhere on land, save chemical plants. Marine engineers are concerned with surface protection and preventing galvanic corrosion in every project. Corrosion can be inhibited through cathodic protection by utilizing pieces of metal known as sacrificial anodes. A piece of metal such as zinc is used as the sacrificial anode as it becomes the anode in the chemical reaction. This causes the metal to corrode and not the ship‚Äôs hull. Another way to prevent corrosion is by sending a controlled amount of low DC current to the ship‚Äôs hull to prevent the process of electro-chemical corrosion. This changes the electrical charge of the ship‚Äôs hull to prevent electro-chemical corrosion.  Anti-fouling  Anti-fouling is the process of eliminating obstructive organisms from essential components of seawater systems. Marine organisms grow and attach to the surfaces of the outboard suction inlets used to obtain water for cooling systems. Electro-chlorination involves running high electrical current through sea water. The combination of current and sea water alters the chemical composition to create sodium hypochlorite to purge any bio-matter. An electrolytic method of anti-fouling involves running electrical current through two anodes (Scardino, 2009). These anodes typically consist of copper and aluminum (or iron). The copper anode releases its ion into the water creating an environment that is too toxic for bio-matter. The second metal, aluminum, coats the inside of the pipes to help prevent corrosion. Other forms of marine growth such as mussels and algae may attach themselves to the bottom of a ship's hull. This causes the ship to have a less hydrodynamic shape since it would not be uniform and smooth around the hull. This creates the problem of less fuel efficiency as it slows down the vessel (IMO, 2018). This issue can be remedied by using special paint that prevent the growth of such organisms.  Pollution control  Sulfur emission = The burning of marine fuels has the potential to release harmful pollutants into the atmosphere. Ships burn marine diesel in addition to heavy fuel oil. Heavy fuel oil, being the heaviest of refined oils, releases sulfur dioxide when burned. Sulfur dioxide emissions have the potential to raise atmospheric and ocean acidity causing harm to marine life. However, heavy fuel oil may only be burned in international waters due to the pollution created. It is commercially advantageous due to the cost effectiveness compared to other marine fuels. It is prospected that heavy fuel oil will be phased out of commercial use by the year 2020 (Smith, 2018). = Oil and water discharge = Water, oil, and other substances collect at the bottom of the ship in what is known as the bilge. Bilge water is pumped overboard, but must pass a pollution threshold test of 15 ppm (parts per million) of oil to be discharged. Water is tested and either discharged if clean or recirculated to a holding tank to be separated before being tested again. The tank it is sent back to, the oily water separator, utilizes gravity to separate the fluids due to their viscosity. Ships over 400 gross tons are required to carry the equipment to separate oil from bilge water. Further, as enforced by MARPOL, all ships over 400 gross tons and all oil tankers over 150 gross tons are require to log all oil transfer is an oil record book (EPA, 2011).  Cavitation  Cavitation is the process of forming an air bubble in a liquid due to the vaporization of that liquid cause by an area of low pressure. This area of low pressure lowers the boiling point of a liquid allowing it to vaporize into a gas. Cavitation can take place in pumps, which can cause damage to the impeller that moves the fluids through the system. Cavitation is also seen in propulsion. Low pressure pockets form on the surface of the propeller blades as its revolutions per minute increase (IIMS, 2015). Cavitation on the propeller causes a small but violent implosion which could warp the propeller blade. To remedy the issue, more blades allow the same amount of propulsion force but at a lower rate of revolutions. This is crucial for submarines as the propeller needs to keep the vessel relatively quiet to stay hidden. With more propeller blades, the vessel is able to achieve the same amount of propulsion force at lower shaft revolutions.

Currently there are about 8,200 naval architects and marine engineers employed, however, this number is expected to increase to 9,200 by 2026 (BLS, 2017). This trend could be attributed to the demand in fossil fuels obtained through offshore drilling and mining. In addition, 90% of the world's trade is done overseas by close to 50,000 ships, all of which require engineers aboard and shoreside (ICS, 2017).  Education  Training Ship Golden Bear docked at California Maritime Academy. Maritime universities are dedicated to teaching and training students in maritime professions.

Club career  At club level, Galderisi played for several Italian teams throughout his career, scoring almost 200 goals across the various divisions of Italian football. A Juventus youth product, he began his professional career with the Juventus senior side, making his club debut on 20 August 1980, in a 2‚Äì2 draw against Udinese in the Coppa Italia; he made his Serie A debut with the club in a 0‚Äì0 away draw against Perugia, on 9 November 1980, his only league appearance of the 1980‚Äì81 season. Although he struggled to find the back of the net consistently with Juventus, he scored decisive goals during the 1981‚Äì82 season, including a hat-trick in Juventus's 3‚Äì2 home victory over Milan on 14 February 1982, as the Turin side captured the league title. During the 1982‚Äì83 season, he also won the Coppa Italia with Juventus and reached the 1983 European Cup Final. In total he scored 6 goals in 16 appearances for Juventus. After a spell of mixed success with Juventus, he joined provincial side Hellas Verona in 1983, where his goalscoring form improved; during the 1984‚Äì85 season, he established himself as one of the top strikers in the league, and was the Verona's top scorer with 11 goals as he helped the club win their historic first ever Serie A title. In 1986, he joined Milan (1986‚Äì87), and later played for Lazio (1987‚Äì88), and also had a second spell with Verona (1988‚Äì89), although he failed to replicate his form from previous seasons due to several injuries. After moving around between several different clubs, he joined Padova in 1989, where he remained until 1995, and had several positive seasons with the club in Serie B. He finished his career in Major League Soccer, playing with the New England Revolution and the Tampa Bay Mutiny in 1996 and 1997; he was traded to Tampa midway through his first season in the United States, and then back to New England a year later.  International career  Galderisi, nicknamed Nanu (short) during his playing career, a nickname he earned during his time with Juventus, was capped ten times for Italy between 1985 and 1987, although he failed to score a goal. He made his international debut on 2 June 1985, in a 1‚Äì1 draw against Mexico, and was later part of his nation's 1986 FIFA World Cup squad under manager Enzo Bearzot.  Style of play  A quick, agile and diminutive striker, Galderisi was a prolific goalscorer, with excellent reactions who was also known for his work-rate, generosity, tenacity, and his powerful and accurate striking ability with either foot. He was also known for his accuracy from distance, and was also effective in the air, despite his small stature, due to his timing and elevation. Although he began his career as a second striker, he came into his own as an out-and-out centre-forward, due to his pace, eye for goal, and his determined and opportunistic style of play. Despite his ability he was often prone to injuries throughout his career, and also struggled to maintain his best form in bigger teams, while he performed better at smaller clubs.  Managerial career  Galderisi started a coaching career in 2000 as Serie C2 club Gubbio's boss. He then served as coach in years later for other Serie C clubs, such as Cremonese and Giulianova. His coaching career experienced a sudden break in January 2004, when Galderisi suffered a heart attack. Il Resto del Carlino He fully recovered since then, and in 2005 he accepted an offer from Viterbese of Serie C2. In 2006‚Äì2007, he coached Avellino of Serie C1; after a very impressive first half of season ended in first place, he was fired on 18 April 2007 despite his team, then in second place, was still involved in the promotion run. In January 2008, Galderisi was appointed at the helm of Serie C1 side Foggia, replacing Salvatore Campilongo. During his tenure, the satanelli's performances dramatically improved as they managed to make a comeback to the promotion playoff spots. On July 2008 he was appointed as new manager of Lega Pro Prima Divisione side Pescara, replacing Franco Lerda, with the aim to win promotion to Serie B for the biancazzurri. However, during his tenure as head coach, Galderisi had to face with serious economic issues within the club; Pescara was ultimately declared out of business on December 2008 and the club control passed legally to a bankruptcy trustee appointed by the Court of Pescara. On February 2009 a new property emerged, with Delfino Pescara 1936 being constituted and taking over the club from the Court of Pescara. Results did not improve anyway, with Pescara struggling in the bottom part of the table, and Galderisi was dismissed from his coaching post on 23 March 2009, being replaced by another former Juventus and Italy international footballer, Antonello Cuccureddu. In the season 2009‚Äì10 he coached Arezzo and in the following season he coached Benevento. On 25 October 2011 he signed a one-year deal with sleeping giants U.S. Triestina Calciohttp://ilpiccolo.gelocal.it/sport/2011/10/25/news/triestina-galderisi-e- il-nuovo-allenatore-1.1620470 until the end of the season. The season turned out to be a particularly troubled one due to massive financial issues that ultimately led to many players' departures during the winter transfer market, no salaries being paid for most of the season, relegation and even the cancellation of the club from Italian football. On July 2012 he was announced as new head coach of hometown club Salernitana, who were just promoted back into professionalism, but he left after getting only one point in three games. Later in January 2014, he was named new head coach of Portuguese top flight strugglers S.C. Olhanense, a club owned by an Italian consortium and with a squad featuring several players formerly of Serie A. He left the club by the end of the season after failing to save it from relegation. He returned into management in November 2014 to take over at struggling Lega Pro team Lucchese, not being confirmed for the following season despite succeeding in saving them from relegation. He returned at Lucchese in March 2016, signing a contract until June 2017.

It centres on a girl whose best friend drowns in a mill pool. Plot introduction Everyone says that Max has drowned, but Charlie thinks differently: she was in the mill-pool with him, and knows exactly what she saw. When she begins to see him in her dreams, her hopes are raised. It seems the reunion she craves is possible. But where exactly is Max leading her? And will she be able to return? The Leap  Defining attributes in The Leap  The story weaves a fantasy into everyday life, but for the most part it is confined to Charlie's dreams (and later, her perception of the waking world). With only a few clues, the reader is kept guessing whether it is all in Charlie's imagination, or whether there is a reality behind the dream. No simple answer is given, even at the end. > After the high adventures of Buried Fire, I was interested in a more low-key > and subtle investigation of how fantasy and reality collide. The book is > split between the perspectives of Charlie, who believes something strange > has happened, and her brother James, who doesn‚Äôt. It is up to the reader to > decide whose side to take. - Jonathan Stroud  Characters  ;Charlotte \\"Charlie\\" Fetcher: Protagonist. At the beginning of the story, Charlie witnesses the drowning at a mill pool of her best friend, Max. Her memories of the events are fanciful, involving a vision of Max in the water, being kidnapped by strange women with bright green eyes. Her doctor, Peter Andover, believes these memories are the cause of asphyxiation (from being under water), for the restriction of blood to the brain may induce visual disturbance, such as prolonged dreamlike hallucinations. Her mother and James, her brother are also skeptic of her tale. In spite of this Charlie continues to fully believe what she had seen. Charlie also has vivid dreams in a fantastic land, where she attempts to find Max. At times she will see him walking in the distance, but is always to far off to catch up with. She keeps a dream journal. After many nights of trying to find Max, Charlie meets in one of her dreams a stranger named Kit who wants to help her in her quest to find Max. He tells Charlie that Max is what is known in this country as a Walker and that all the Walkers are going to The Great Fair, which celebrates the coming of winter. At The Great Fair there is a Great Dance that welcomes newcomers like Max. Kit then tells Charlie that if Max were to join the dance he would truly be of this country and will forget not only Charlie, but all of his past life. He tells her that there are also many entrances to his country, through dreams (Such as Charlie's) and \\"true\\" entrances, like the mill pool, and the only way to catch up to Max was by searching for entrances in the day (when Charlie is awake). These entrances are the places Max once loved since he is still close to his \\"old country\\". Following more dreams, Charlie finally makes it to the fair by sleepwalking. She makes it to the Great Dance but it had already started. She can occasionally see Max amongst the other dancers. When Charlie realizes she is now lost to him, she's devastated. Then Kit emerges from the crowds watching the dance and tells Charlie it isn't too late. She can join Max in the dance since he still remembers her slightly. Kit tells her to take Max's hand and leap, but when she sees Max's emotionless eyes she does not dance, despite Kit's desperate commands to do so. Everyone around her loses their beauty, disintegrate and scream in anger, Kit the loudest amongst them, but now Max has let go of Charlie's hand freed from the dance. He peacefully disappears.The Leap ;James Fetcher: Charlie's older brother. Through James's eyes the reader is given a look at a more \\"practical\\" side of the story. He cares very much for Charlie but worries about her, hoping she isn't going mad. He often annoys Charlie since she thinks he doesn't understand her and her situation. He also once wakes Charlie before she tastes a fruit that would grant her desire, and takes her to Max. From James's view, Charlie was becoming more and more ill in her sleep, her color draining with each second (This could be interpreted as the closer Charlie gets to Max, the closer she gets to death.). Unfortunately, this only worsens things for James. Later, James discovers his sister's dream journal where Charlie writes about her hunt for Max. This only worries James more. He trails Charlie when she sleepwalks, following her to a quarry and tries to keep her from walking over the edge to her demise. He trips and was unable to reach her, but she stops just in time. Once he finally gets to her she wakes up and speaks his name. ;Kit: Kit is a tall, thin man with curly brown hair and green eyes who Charlie befriends in one of her dreams where she searches for Max. He gives her advice in her quest to find Max and at another time finds her a rare fruit that grants desires, which would have helped speed up her search if James hadn't woken her. ;Max: Max was Charlie's best friend. He was a very cheerful boy and they spent much time together, all the way up until his fall into the mill pool. Max's departure from Charlie's life was what set the rest of the story in motion, being such an important person in Charlie's psyche.

He was drafted by the Dallas Cowboys in the fifth round of the 1998 NFL Draft. He played college football at Iowa State University. Early years Ross attended Washington Preparatory High School, where he received All-Conference honors as a two-way tackle. He moved on to Southwestern Community College, earning the starting position at defensive tackle as a freshman. The next year, he registered 11 starts, 66 tackles, 9 sacks and a forced fumble, while receiving All-Southern California Western States Conference honors. As a junior, he transferred to Iowa State University, where he was a backup defensive tackle, appearing in 2 games and not recording any tackles. In 1996, he was redshirted in order to convert him into an offensive tackle. As a senior, he earned the starter position at left tackle, helping the team averaged 228.6 passing yards-per-game. Professional career=Dallas Cowboys The Dallas Cowboys traded their sixth (#162-Carl Hansen) and seventh-round (#197-Jason McEndoo) picks to the Seattle Seahawks in exchange for a fifth-round pick (138th overall) in the 1998 NFL Draft to select Ross. Because he was considered a raw prospect at offensive tackle, he needed more development time and played in just 2 games, as an extra tight end in short yardage situations. He was released on September 5, 1999. Philadelphia Eagles On September 8, 1999, he was signed by the Philadelphia Eagles to their practice squad. On September 13, he was promoted to the active roster, but was kept inactive during the last 15 games of the season. In 2000, the team assigned him to the Amsterdam Admirals of the NFL Europe.

In 2001, he played in all 16 games and had the first 8 career starts of his professional career, filling in for players who were injured at right guard, right tackle and left tackle. Ross was signed to a restricted free agent offer sheet by the Cleveland Browns in 2002, but the Steelers matched it, signing him through the 2004 season. In 2003, he was expected to be the starter at right tackle, but was passed on the depth chart by Todd Fordham in a close competition, before regaining it for the final 9 games of the season. In 2004, he started every game at right tackle. From 2001 to 2004, he played in all 64 games, totaling 35 starts, playing both the guard and tackle positions. Arizona Cardinals (first stint) On March 4, 2005, he was signed by the Arizona Cardinals as an unrestricted free agent, starting 11 games at right tackle, one at left tackle and missing 4 games with a broken bone in his hand. In 2006, he had surgery to fix a preseason right knee injury, but was still able to play in 11 games with five starts. He missed the entire 2007 season with a torn left triceps. He was released on February 21, 2008. New England Patriots On June 2, 2008, he signed as an unrestricted free agent with the New England Patriots, but never played any games for the team. He began training camp on the PUP list with a shoulder injury, before being placed on the injured reserve list and was eventually released on October 28. Arizona Cardinals (second stint) On May 4, 2009, he was signed by the Arizona Cardinals as an unrestricted free agent, reuniting him with Ken Whisenhunt and Russ Grimm, who were his coaches with the Pittsburgh Steelers.

Discovery and naming  In 1967 a group of four twelve-year-old Scotch College schoolboys found a fossil at the Bringo Railway Cutting site near Geraldton, which they showed to professor Rex Prider of the University of Western Australia. He had a cast made that he sent to experts of the British Museum of Natural History in London who thought it likely belonged to an extinct turtle. Re-evaluation of the bone in the 1990s after being prepared out of the rock by John Albert Long and Ralph Molnar classified the fossil as the shinbone of a genus of theropods.Long, J.A. (1998). Dinosaurs of Australia and New Zealand and other animals of the Mesozoic Era. Harvard University Press, UNSW Press, pp 94-96. In 1998 Long and Molnar named and described the type (and only) species Ozraptor subotaii. The generic name is derived from \\"Ozzies\\", the nickname for Australians, and a Latin raptor, \\"seizer\\". The specific name honours a fictional character, the swift-running thief and archer \\"Subotai\\" from the movie Conan the Barbarian.Long, J.A. and Molnar, R.E. (1998). \\"A new Jurassic theropod dinosaur from Western Australia\\". Records of the Western Australian Museum 19 (1): 221-229 The holotype, UWA 82469, was found in the Colalura Sandstone, dating to the middle Bajocian, about 169 million years ago. It consists of the distal or lower end of a left tibia. Together with Rhoetosaurus, Ozraptor is among the oldest known Australian dinosaurs. A skeletal reconstruction of the genus Ozraptor subotaii based on evidence suggesting it is an abelisaurid. The specimen is long and wide at the lower end. From these measurements, a total length for the shinbone was estimated of about and for the animal as a whole of about . Three diagnostic features were established enabling it to be upheld as a distinct species of dinosaur: the ascending process of the astragalus had a rectangular shape with a straight upper end; the astragalar facet had a vertical ridge; the medial condyle was weakly developed.  Classification  Only known from one partial leg bone, Ozraptor is difficult to classify. In 1998 the describers could not more precisely determine the classification than a Theropoda incertae sedis. In 2004 Thomas Holtz thought it was a member of the Avetheropoda. In 2005 another study, by Oliver Rauhut, suggested that it was indeed a theropod, and more specifically, a member of the Abelisauroidea based on the presence of the distinct vertical median ridge on the astragalar groove.Rauhut, O.W.M.

The concept is often attributed to Russian playwright Anton Chekhov, reputed to have said \\"Don't tell me the moon is shining; show me the glint of light on broken glass.\\" What Chekhov actually said, in a letter to his brother, was \\"In descriptions of Nature one must seize on small details, grouping them so that when the reader closes his eyes he gets a picture. For instance, you‚Äôll have a moonlit night if you write that on the mill dam a piece of glass from a broken bottle glittered like a bright little star, and that the black shadow of a dog or a wolf rolled past like a ball.\\" The distinction between telling and showing was popularized in Percy Lubbock's book The Craft of Fiction (1921), and has been an important element in Anglo-Saxon narratological theory ever since. Examples=Ernest Hemingway Nobel Prize‚Äìwinning novelist Ernest Hemingway was a notable proponent of the \\"show, don't tell\\" style. His Iceberg Theory, also known as the \\"theory of omission\\", developed from his background as a newspaper reporter. The term itself originates from his bullfighting treatise, Death in the Afternoon: > If a writer of prose knows enough of what he is writing about he may omit > things that he knows and the reader, if the writer is writing truly enough, > will have a feeling of those things as strongly as though the writer had > stated them. The dignity of movement of an iceberg is due to only one-eighth > of it being above water. Creative literature (as opposed to technical writing or objective journalism) in general hinges on the artful use of a wide range of devices (such as inference, metaphor, understatement, the unreliable narrator, and ambiguity) that reward the careful reader's appreciation of subtext and extrapolation of what the author chooses to leave unsaid, untold, and/or unshown. This suggests a form of respect for the reader, who should be trusted to develop a feeling for the meaning behind the action, without having the point painfully laid out for them. Chuck Palahniuk In a 2013 article, Chuck Palahniuk (author of the novel Fight Club) goes as far as recommending a ban of what he calls \\"thought verbs\\" (\\"Thinks, Knows, Understands, Realizes, Believes, Wants, Remembers, Imagines, Desires [‚Ä¶]\\") favoring instead the use of \\"specific sensory detail: action, smell, taste, sound, and feeling.\\" James Scott Bell \\"Show, don't tell\\" should not be applied to all incidents in a story. According to James Scott Bell, \\"Sometimes a writer tells as a shortcut, to move quickly to the meaty part of the story or scene. Showing is essentially about making scenes vivid. If you try to do it constantly, the parts that are supposed to stand out won't, and your readers will get exhausted.\\" Showing requires more words; telling may cover a greater span of time more concisely. A novel that contains only showing would be incredibly long; therefore, a narrative can contain some legitimate telling. Orson Scott Card Scenes that are important to the story should be dramatized with showing, but sometimes what happens between scenes can be told so the story can make progress. According to Orson Scott Card and others, \\"showing\\" is so terribly time-consuming that it is to be used only for dramatic scenes. The objective is to find the right balance of telling versus showing, summarization versus action. Factors like rhythm, pace, and tone come into play.  Yves Lavandier  In his book Constructing a Story and his webseries Hats Off to the Screenwriters!, Yves Lavandier argues that one can show with dialogue. He takes the example of a scene from Prison Break in which pure dialogue between Michael Scofield (Wentworth Miller) and Tweener (Lane Garrison) shows (and does not tell) that Tweener is an expert pickpocket.Episode 4 of Yves Lavandier's Hats Off to the Screenwriters!

It is notable for possessing more teeth than any other member of the Ornithomimosauria (or any other theropod), most of which were toothless. Discovery and naming In July 1993 Armando D√≠az Romeral discovered a theropod skeleton at the Las Hoyas Unit 3 site. In 1994 this was named and described by Bernardino P√©rez P√©rez- Moreno, Jos√© Luis Sanz, Angela Buscalioni, Jos√© Moratalla, Francisco Ortega and Diego Rasskin-Gutman as a new species: Pelecanimimus polyodon. The generic name is derived from Latin pelecanus, \\"pelican\\", and mimus, \\"mimic\\", in reference to the long snout and throat pouch. The specific name is a reference to the large number of teeth possessed by this theropod and is derived from Greek œÄŒøŒªœçœÇ ('), \\"many\\" and ·ΩÄŒ¥ŒøœçœÇ (') \\"tooth\\". The holotype specimen, LH 7777, part of the Las Hoyas Collection presently housed at the Museo de Cuenca, Cuenca, Spain, of Pelecanimimus was recovered at the La Hoyas locality in Cuenca Province, Spain, from lagerst√§tte beds within the Calizas de La Hu√©rguina Formation dating to the Lower Barremian. The only known specimen consists of the articulated front half of a skeleton and includes the skull, lower jaws, all the neck vertebrae and most of the back vertebrae, ribs, sternum, the pectoral girdle, a complete right forelimb and most of the left forelimb. Remains of the soft parts are visible at the back of the skull, around the neck and around the front limbs. Description Estimated size of Pelecanimimus, compared to a human. Pelecanimimus was a small ornithomimosaur, at about and 17-25 kg (37-55 lbs). Its skull was unusually long and narrow, with a maximum length of about 4.5 times its maximum height. It was highly unusual among ornithomimosaurs in its large number of teeth: it had about 220 very small teeth in total, with seven premaxillary teeth, about thirty maxillary, and seventy-five in the dentary. The teeth were heterodont, showing two different basic forms. The teeth in the front of the upper jaw were broad and D-shaped in cross-section, while those further back were blade-like, and on the whole the teeth in the upper jaw were larger than those in the lower. All of its teeth were unserrated, and had a constricted \\"waist\\" between the crown and the root. Interdental plates were lacking.Kobayashi, Y., and Barsbold, R. (2005). \\"Anatomy of Harpymimus okladnikovi Barsbold and Perle 1984 (Dinosauria; Theropoda) of Mongolia.\\" in The Carnivorous Dinosaurs ed. Carpenter, K. 2005. Indiana University Press:97-126. Concavenator chasing Pelecanimimus Only one other ornithomimosaur is known to possess teeth, Harpymimus, which had far fewer (eleven total, and only in the lower jaw). The presence of such a large number of teeth in Pelecanimimus, coupled with a lack of interdental space, was interpreted by P√©rez-Moreno et al. as an adaptation for cutting and ripping, a \\"functional counterpart of the cutting edge of a beak,\\" as well as an exaptation leading to the toothless cutting edge found in later ornithomimosaurs. The arms and hands of Pelecanimimus were more typical of ornithomimosaurs, with the ulna and radius bones in the lower arm tightly adhered to each other. The hand was hook-like and had fingers of equal length equipped with rather straight claws. Illustration of the skull from Pelecanimimus. The small crest in back of the head (colored in light grey) was probably made by keratin. Soft-tissue remains preserved by the exceptional preservational environment of the La Hoyas lagerst√§tte revealed the presence of a small skin or keratin crest on the back of the head, and a gular pouch similar to the much larger pouches found in modern pelicans, from which Pelecanimimus took its name. Pelecanimimus might have been much like a modern- day crane, wading out in lakes or ponds using its claws and teeth to capture fish and then storing them in its skin flap. Some parts of the impressions revealed wrinkled skin, interpreted as lacking scales or feathers. Filament- like structures were also preserved; first interpreted as an integument, some of these were later seen as representing preserved muscle fibers.D. E. G. Briggs, P. R. Wilby, B. P√©rez P√©rez-Moreno, J. L. Sanz, M. Fregenal-Martinez, (1997). \\"The mineralization of dinosaur soft tissue in the Lower Cretaceous of Las Hoyas, Spain.\\" Journal of the Geological Society of London, 154: 587-588. Pelecanimimus was also the first ornithomimosaur discovered with a preserved hyoid apparatus (specialized tongue bones in the neck). Gregory S. Paul has speculated that Pelecanimimus might have been capable of flight or be a recent descendant from a flying animal.Dinosaurs of the Air: The Evolution and Loss of Flight in Dinosaurs and Birds, pg 237 This is due to the presence of large sternal plates and uncinate processes, which imply flight musculature. These adaptations have been noted years later by the paleontologist Mickey Mortimer.Did Dromiceiomimus really have long vaned secondaries? Classification Pelecanimimus was by the describers assigned to the Ornithomimosauria, in the basalmost position. A later cladistic analysis by Makovicky et al. (2005) confirmed that Pelecanimimus is the most basal member of the Ornithomimosauria, less derived even than Harpymimus.Makovicky, P., Kobayashi, Y. and Currie, P. J. (2004). \\"Ornithomimosauria.\\" pp. 137-150 in D. B. Weishampel, P. Dodson, et H. Osm√≥lska (eds.), The Dinosauria. 2nd ed. University of California Press, Berkeley. A study by Kobayashi and L√º in 2003 indicated that these two species formed a basal arrangement of steps leading towards the more advanced ornithomimids (see cladogram below).Kobayashi, Y., and L√º, J.-C. (2003). \\"A new ornithomimid dinosaur with gregarious habits from the Late Cretaceous of China.\\" Acta Palaeontologica Polonica 48:235-259. The discovery of Pelecanimimus has played an important and surprising role in understanding the evolution of the Ornithomimosauria. To quote P√©rez-Moreno et al., \\"The phylogenetic hypothesis...supports an unexpected approach, involving exaptation, which might explain the evolutionary process towards the toothless condition in Ornithomimosauria. Until now, a progressive reduction in the number of teeth has been considered as the most likely explanation: the primitive tetanuran theropods have up to 80 teeth with tall blade-like crowns, and the primitive ornithomimosaurs have only a few small teeth. The phylogenetic hypothesis suggests an alternative evolutionary process based on a functional analysis of increasing numbers of teeth. A high number of teeth with enough interdental space and properly placed denticles (as in troodontids) would be an adaptation for cutting and ripping. On the other hand, an excessive number of teeth with no interdental space (as in Pelecanimimus) would be a functional counterpart of the cutting edge of a beak. Thus, increasing the number of teeth would be an adaptation for cutting and ripping, as long as the space between adjacent teeth was preserved...while it would have the effect of working as a beak if spaces were filled with more teeth. The adaption to a cut-and-rip function therefore becomes an exaptation with a slicing effect, eventually leading to the cutting edge seen in most ornithomimosaurs.\\" Cladogram after Kobayashi and L√º, 2003: Paleoecology Europejara and Pelecanimimus in an ecologic competition The Las Hoyas lagerst√§tte has produced numerous other exquisitely preserved species, including the enantiornithine birds Iberomesornis, Concornis, and Eoalulavis, along with non-avian theropod teeth, Concavenator remains, and a few fragmentary sauropod bones. Coarse sediments of the La Hoyas lagerst√§tte have produced bones of the ornithopod dinosaur Iguanodon. The lagerst√§tte beds have also yielded remains of lizards and salamanders, as well as of the unique early mammal Spinolestes. Several pterosaurs like Europejara and crocodylomorphs are also known.

He spent his entire career with the Cincinnati Bengals, first in the American Football League (AFL) in 1969 and then the National Football League (NFL) from 1970 through 1983. Riley recorded 65 interceptions in his career, which was the fourth most in NFL history at the time of his retirement behind three members of the Pro Football Hall of Fame, Dick Lane, Emlen Tunnell, and Paul Krause. But despite his accomplishments, Riley was never an exceptionally popular or well-known player. In his 15 seasons, Riley was never once selected to play in the AFL All-Star Game or the AFC-NFC Pro Bowl, and to this date has not been voted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame. Early career Riley grew up in Bartow, Florida. Claude Woodruff was his high school coach at Union Academy. College career Before his professional career, Riley played quarterback for Florida A&M; University. Under coach Jake Gaither, Riley led the Rattlers to a 23-7 record and three Southern Intercollegiate Athletic Conference titles.https://www.fox23.com/news/trending/ken-riley-former-nfl-star-florida- am-standout-coach-dead-72/T3VYEUFIP5CWHAOGIHKY5HLT2U/ In addition to being a skilled athlete, Riley also excelled academically. He earned his team's scholastic award and a Rhodes Scholar candidacy. In 1977, Riley was enshrined in Florida A&M;'s Athletic Hall of Fame. NFL career After graduating from college, Riley was selected by the Bengals in the 6th round of the 1969 Common Draft. When Riley reported to training camp, Cincinnati head coach Paul Brown decided to convert Riley to the cornerback position. Brown's decision turned out to be a very good one. Riley made an immediate impact for the Bengals as a defensive back, recording 4 interceptions and 66 return yards. He also recovered 2 fumbles, added another 334 yards on 14 kickoff returns, and even caught 2 passes for 15 yards on offense. For the rest of his career, Riley established himself as one of the top defensive backs in Pro Football, recording 3 or more interceptions in all but 3 of his 15 seasons. His best season was in 1976, when he recorded 9 interceptions, 141 return yards, 1 touchdown, and 2 fumble recoveries. His 9 interceptions set a franchise record for most interceptions in one season, and would remain the team record for 30 years until it was broken by Deltha O'Neal in 2005. He also set a record that year by intercepting 3 passes in the final game of the season, a 42-3 win over New York Jets. Riley intercepted Richard Todd once and future Hall of Fame quarterback Joe Namath twice. It was Namath's final game as a New York Jet. Since then several Bengals' players have tied the record, including Riley, who did it again in a 1982 game, picking off 3 passes from Oakland Raiders quarterback Jim Plunkett, but nobody has broken it. But despite his success in the 1976 season, Riley was not selected to play in the Pro Bowl. Meanwhile, his defensive back teammate Lemar Parrish, who recorded just 2 interceptions and missed half the season with injuries, was a Pro Bowl selection. Riley continued to be an impact player for Cincinnati throughout the rest of his career. In 1981, he recorded 5 interceptions and 1 fumble recovery, assisting his team to their first ever Super Bowl appearance against the San Francisco 49ers in Super Bowl XVI. In his final NFL season (1983), the 36-year-old Riley recorded 8 interceptions, 89 return yards, 2 touchdowns, and 2 fumble recoveries. In his 15 seasons in the NFL, Riley recorded a total of 65 interceptions, 596 return yards, 5 touchdowns, 18 fumble recoveries, 96 fumble return yards, 334 kickoff return yards, and 15 receiving yards. His interceptions, interception return yards, and interceptions returned for touchdowns are all Bengals' records. He played in seven postseason games with Cincinnati, recording an interception in three of them. Legacy After his Pro Football playing career ended, Riley spent two years as an assistant coach for the Green Bay Packers. In 1986, he took over as the head coach of his alma mater, Florida A&M.; Riley coached Florida A&M; from 1986‚Äì1993, compiling a 48-39-2 record, with two Mid-Eastern Athletic Conference titles and 2 MEAC Coach of the Year awards. Riley then served as Florida A&M;'s athletic director from 1994-2003. He then retired and lived the rest of his life in his hometown of Bartow, Florida. Commenting about not yet being enshrined in the Hall of Fame, Riley said \\"I think my numbers are deserving of the Hall of Fame. I've always been a modest and low-key type guy. I've always thought your work would speak for you. It's like it's working against me now because the older you get and the longer you stay out of it, people forget who you are.\\" Riley was a member of Alpha Phi Alpha fraternity. In 2007, he was named to the Florida High School Association All-Century Team which selected the Top 33 players in the 100-year history of high school football in the state of Florida's history. Death Riley died of a heart attack on June 7, 2020, at the age of 72.https://www.fox23.com/news/trending/ken-riley-former-nfl-star- florida-am-standout-coach-dead-72/T3VYEUFIP5CWHAOGIHKY5HLT2U/ Head coaching recordSee also * List of American Football League players ReferencesSources *Ludwig, Chick.

He is remembered for his work protecting Hollywood stars as a \\"fixer\\", a person paid to disguise details of the stars' often colorful private lives to maintain their public image. Among his most lasting contributions to Hollywood was a ledger he maintained that lists the costs and revenues of every MGM film produced between 1924 and 1962, an important reference for film historians. Early life Mannix was born in Fort Lee, New Jersey, the son of John and Lizzie (n√©e Striker) Mannix. Christened Joseph Edgar Allen John Mannix, he used Edgar Joseph Mannix as his official name, but was known to most associates as Eddie. Career After working as a bouncer and then treasurer of the Palisades Amusement Park, he became involved in motion picture exhibition, eventually working his way up to general manager within MGM in the 1920s. The Eddie Mannix Ledger is in the Margaret Herrick Library, at Fairbanks Center for Motion Picture Study.https://www.worldcat.org/title/ej-mannix- ledger/oclc/801258228 Personal life Mannix was married twice and had no children. He married Bernice Fitzmaurice in 1916. Mannix had numerous affairs during the marriage but the couple remained married due to their Catholicism. However, in late 1937, Bernice petitioned for divorce claiming that Mannix physically abused her and also cited the affairs. Before the divorce was officially filed, Bernice died in a car accident outside Palm Springs, California on November 18, 1937. After Bernice's death, Mannix began living with actress and Ziegfeld Follies dancer Toni Lanier with whom he had been having an affair. They married in May 1951 and remained married until Mannix's death in 1963. Mannix was tangentially associated with the death of actor George Reeves, the star of the Adventures of Superman television series. Reeves had begun having an affair with Mannix's wife Toni in 1951. Mannix reportedly approved of the affair,Ward, Larry Thomas. Truth, Justice, & The American Way: The Life and Times of Noel Neill, The Original Lois Lane, Nicholas Lawrence Books, 2003. . p. 83 which was considered an open secret in Hollywood, as he was involved in a long-time affair with a Japanese woman. As Mannix and his wife were Catholics who did not believe in divorce, the arrangement continued for the next several years. Reeves ended the affair in early 1959 and soon became engaged to socialite Leonore Lemmon, which devastated Toni. Reeves died of a gunshot wound to the head at his home on June 16, 1959. His death was ruled a suicide, but controversy surrounding that ruling and the circumstances of his death began. Rumors arose that Mannix, who was also rumored to have had mafia connections, had Reeves killed for seeing his wife. Kashner and Schoenberger's partially fictionalized biography Hollywood Kryptonite states as unsourced fact that Lanier, via Eddie Mannix's criminal connections, ordered Reeves murdered. This theory was endorsed by publicist Edward Lozzi, who stated in 1999 that he had witnessed Toni's deathbed confession. During his career at MGM Mannix apparently also left a trail of forced abortions, sham marriages and several other unsolved murders in his wake.Gibraltar Chronicle; 22 February 2019; Page 11; Acting that speaks louder than words: the enduring appeal of silent movies Later years and death Mannix suffered from a weak heart. By 1959, he had survived several heart attacks and used a wheelchair. On August 30, 1963, he died of a heart attack at his Beverly Hills home at the age of 72. He is buried at the Holy Cross Cemetery in Culver City, Los Angeles County. In popular culture Bob Hoskins portrayed Mannix in the 2006 biographical film Hollywoodland, based on the life and death of Adventures of Superman actor George Reeves, who is played in the film by Ben Affleck. In June 2014, Universal Pictures announced they had acquired the rights to distribute Hail, Caesar!, a heavily fictionalized comedic film very loosely based on Mannix's career. Hail, Caesar! was released on February 5, 2016. Joel and Ethan Coen wrote and directed the film, and Josh Brolin portrayed Mannix. The film contains several references to real-life Hollywood history, but the Mannix character depicted is patriarch of a quiet family with two children and a doting housemaker wife (portrayed by Alison Pill), and his office door reveals his first name to be Edward.

Piatnitzkysaurus was a moderately large, lightly built, bipedal, ground- dwelling carnivore that could grow up to long.  Discovery and naming  The type species, Piatnitzkysaurus floresi, was described by Jose Bonaparte in 1979. It was named to honor Alejandro Matveievich Piatnitzky (1879‚Äì1959), a Russian-born Argentine geologist. The holotype specimen of Piatnitzkysaurus, PVL 4073, was collected during expeditions in 1977, 1982, and 1983 at the Ca√±ad√≥n Asfalto Formation in sediments that were deposited during the Callovian stage of the Jurassic period, approximately 166 to 164 million years ago. Once thought to be a basal carnosaur, it was later classified as a megalosauroid.  Description  Life restoration and size comparison In total, two partial skeletons are known (a fractured skull and parts of two postcranial skeletons, among which paratype MACN CH 895) and is the most completely known theropod from the Middle-Late Jurassic Period of the Southern Hemisphere. Piatnitzkysaurus was a relatively lightly built medium-sized bipedal carnivore that was around long and around in mass, though such estimates apply to the holotype, which is a subadult.Mazzetta, G. V., Fariiia, R. A., & Vizcaino, S. F. 2000. On the palaeobiology of the South American homed theropod Carnotaurus sastrei Bonaparte. In: B. Perez-Moreno, T.R. Holtz Jr., J.L. Sanz, & J.J. Moratalla (eds.), Aspects of Theropod Paleobiology, Special Volume - Gaia 15, 185-192. Lisbon. It had robust arms and powerful hind legs with four toes on each foot. Its ischium is long. Its braincase resembles that of another megalosauroid, the megalosaurid Piveteausaurus from France. Restoration A general resemblance to the theropod Allosaurus was noted by Benton (1992); however there are key differences between the two.Benton, M. (1992). Dinosaur and other prehistoric animal factfinder. 1st American ed. New York: Kingfisher Books. Chicago / Turabian - Author Date Citation The scapular blade of Piatnitzkysaurus is shorter and wider than more derived tenaurans. The humerus represents 50 percent of the length of the femur, which is also a primitive condition present among basal theropods. The relative lengths of the ulna in respect to the humerus and femur are also similar to those of basal theropods, which means the forelimbs of Piatnitzkysaurus are proportionally longer than in Allosaurus. Also primitive is the wide contact between the pubis and ischium, a condition that is much different than that of Allosaurus and more derived tetanurans, in which contact is reduced. The pubis of Piatnitzkysaurus also has a distal foot that is more modestly developed than in Allosaurus. Due to the strong resemblance to Piatnitzkysaurus, it has been suggested that the sister taxa Condorraptor could be better interpreted as the result of individual variation within the species, and not as separate taxa. The main noted differences between the two dinosaurs include both a less well developed enemial crest and a first sacral vertebra with a shallower fossa in Condorraptor.  Braincase  Skeletal diagram The braincase of Piatnitzkysaurus has been reviewed in detail by Oliver Rauhut; the review constitutes one of the few detailed accounts of braincase morphology in basal theropods. Piatnitzkysaurusis the only member of Piatnitzkysauridae with cranial material preserved, for which two maxillae, a frontal, a braincase, and a partial dentary are known. Piatnitzkysaurus is among the most basal members of the tetanurans and is important for understanding not only Middle Jurassic theropod evolution in the Southern Hemisphere, but also for knowledge of character evolution at the base of tetanurae. The braincase of the holotype of Piatnitzkysaurus floresi (PVL 4073) is rather well preserved and shows no signs of deformation. The sutures between the individual bones of the skull are only partially visible, which indicates that the holotype represents a subadult individual. This is also consistent with the state of ossification in the post-cranial skeleton. An unusual feature of the braincase is the parasphenoid recess, which has only been described in two other non-avian theropods, Sinovenator and Sinornithosaurus. Given the distant phylogenetic position of the basal tetanuran Piatnitzkysaurus and the advanced maniraptoran and deinonychosaurian taxa Sinovenator and Sinorntihosaurus, the presence of this recess represents a convergence and can be considered an autapomorphy of the former genus. Another noteworthy aspect of the braincase is the prominent hook-like basisphenoidal wing, a feature that is also found in other theropods such as Ceratosaurus, Allosaurus, and Tyrannosaurus.  Classification  The most basal clade within Megalosauroidea contains Condorraptor, Marshosaurus, Piatnitzkysaurus and Xuanhanosaurus. The next most basal clade comprises Chuandongocoelurus and Monolophosaurus. However, the affiliation of these clades with Megalosauroidea is poorly supported by tree support metrics, and it is possible that they will be classified outside of Megalosauroidea by future analyses.

The first remains of the genus were found in 1923, and the type species Pinacosaurus grangeri was named in 1933. Pinacosaurus mephistocephalus named in 1999, is a second possibly valid species differing from the type species in details of the skull armour. Of Pinacosaurus grangeri many skeletons have been found, more than of any other ankylosaur. These predominantly consist of juveniles that perhaps lived in herds roaming the desert landscape of their habitat. Pinacosaurus was a medium-sized ankylosaurine, about five metres long and weighed up to two tonnes. Its body was flat and low-slung but not as heavily built as in some other members of the Ankylosaurinae. The head was protected by bone tiles, hence its name. Each nostril was formed as a large depression pierced by between three and five smaller holes, the purpose of which is uncertain. A smooth beak bit off low-growing plants that were sliced by rows of small teeth and then swallowed to be processed by the enormous hind gut. Neck, back and tail were protected by an armour of keeled osteoderms. The animal could also actively defend itself by means of a tail club. Discovery and naming The American Museum of Natural History sponsored several Central Asiatic Expeditions to the Gobi Desert in Mongolia in the 1920s. Among the many paleontological finds from the \\"Flaming Cliffs\\" of the Djadokhta Formation in Shabarakh Usu were the original specimens of Pinacosaurus, found by Walter Wallis Granger in 1923. In 1933, Charles Whitney Gilmore described a right ilium and a tail vertebra, without yet naming the animal. In a later publication of the same year, he named and described the type species Pinacosaurus grangeri. The generic name is derived from Greek œÄŒØŒΩŒ±Œæ, pinax, \\"plank\\", in reference to the small rectangular scutes covering the head. The specific name honours Granger, who accompanied the 1923 expedition as a paleontologist. The holotype, AMNH 6523, was found in a layer of the Djadokhta Formation, dating from the Campanian. It consists of a partially crushed skull, lower jaws, the first two neck vertebrae, and dermal bones collected in 1923. The skull is still the largest known of the genus. Skeleton of specimen MPC 100/1305 with skull cast of Saichania holotype Pinacosaurus is the best known Asian or worldwide ankylosaur with numerous specimens having been discovered. From the original Flaming Cliffs or Shabarakh Usu several other fossils have been reported including ZPAL MgD II/1: a nearly complete skeleton; ZPAL MgD II/9: a postcranial skeleton; ZPAL MgD II/31: the handle of a tail club; and PIN 3780/3: a skull; PIN 614: a nearly complete postcranial skeleton (= Syrmosaurus viminocaudus); and possibly MPC 100/1305, a postcranial skeleton erroneously described in 2011 as belonging to Saichania. At another site, Alag Teeg now considered part of the Alagteeg Formation, entire bonebeds have been uncovered of juvenile animals. Soviet-Mongolian expeditions in 1969 and 1970 reported thirty skeletons. Mongolian-Japanese expeditions added another thirty between 1993 and 1998. Forty were reported by Canadian expeditions between 2001 and 2006. The remains have not been all dug up and it is possible the reports partly pertain to the same material. In Inner Mongolia at Bayan Mandahu, the Canada‚àíChina Dinosaur Project in 1987, 1988, and 1990 found specimens IVPP V16853: a skull with cervical halfrings; IVPP V16283: a partial skull, IVPP V16854: a nearly complete skeleton; IVPP V16346: a partial skull; and IVPP V16855: a skeleton. Other, as yet undescribed material included two finds of several juveniles huddled together, evidently killed by a sandstorm. Whereas ankylosaur skeletons have often been preserved laying on their back, most Pinacosaurus juveniles are found on their belly in a resting position, with the legs tucked in. Juvenile specimens under excavation in 1990, with quarry map Because of the many finds, in principle the entire juvenile skeleton is known. Pinacosaurus especially provides information on the build of the ankylosaurian skull, as in the juveniles the head armour has not yet fused with the skull proper and the sutures of the various elements are still visible. Modern studies have not yet fully covered the abundance of data. A well-preserved juvenile skull was described by Teresa Marya≈Ñska in 1971 and 1977. In 2003, Robert Hill studied the juvenile specimen IGM 100/1014. In 2011, Currie published a study on the hand and foot, body parts often incompletely known with other ankylosaurs. The same year Michael Burns dedicated an article to four juveniles from the Bayan Mandahu. Also in 2011, the postcranial skeleton MPC 100/1305 was described in detail, though at the time referred to Saichania. Most recently, Michael Burns and colleagues described and illustrated the original Alag Teeg material from the Soviet- Mongolian expeditions in 1969 and 1970. Additional species and synonyms P. mephistocephalus skeleton Yang Zhongjian (\\"C. C. Young\\") discovered a new specimen in the Ningxia Province at Bayanmandahu, and described it as a new species Pinacosaurus ninghsiensis in 1935. The rather complete skeleton lacks a present inventory number; it is now considered to be the same species as P. grangeri. The same is true of fragmentary remains, specimen PIN 614, described as Syrmosaurus viminocaudus by Evgenii Aleksandrovich Maleev in 1952. Arbour, Burns and Sissons (2009) considered Heishansaurus pachycephalus (\\"thick-headed Black Mountain lizard\\") from the Minhe Formation, near Heishan (= \\"Black Mountain\\"), Gansu Province, which is known from poorly preserved cranial and postcranial fragments, to be a junior synonym of P. grangeri as well. It was first described in 1953 as a pachycephalosaur and had been usually considered a nomen dubium. In 2014, Arbour again concluded it was a nomen dubium. In 1996, a Belgian-Chinese expedition discovered a large skeleton in the Bayan Mandahu, specimen IMM 96BM3/1. It was named as Pinacosaurus mephistocephalus by Pascal Godefroit et alii in 1999. The specific name is a contraction of Mephistopheles and Greek Œ∫ŒµœÜŒ±ŒªŒÆ, kephal√®, \\"head\\", in reference to the \\"devilish\\" squamosal horns. In 2010, Gregory S. Paul suggested that P. mephistopheles were a junior synonym of P. grangeri. It was considered a valid species by Robert Hill in 2012, based on the \\"secondary dermal\\" (squamosal) horns and narial characteristics. Arbour and Michael Burns have confirmed that the species was valid. In 1995, Eric Buffetaut referred ankylosaurian remains found in Shandong to a Pinacosaurus sp. Description Specimen displayed in Japan Size and distinguishing traits Pinacosaurus was a lightly built, medium-sized animal, fully grown individuals reached a total length of . Genus List for Holtz 2012 Weight Information Gregory S. Paul estimated their weight about , Thomas R. Holtz however, estimated it between . The postcranial skeleton PIN 614 measures from the first neck vertebrae to the end of the tail. Juvenile skeleton displayed in the Hong Kong Science Museum In 2014, Arbour established some distinguishing traits of the genus. The upper snout armour does not consist of distinct tiles, caputegulae, but of a fused mass. Adult individuals have a skull that is longer than wide. This trait is shared with the distant relatives Gobisaurus and Shamosaurus, but Pinacosaurus differs from those in the possession of extra openings in the nostril and a pointy protruding caputegula on the prefrontal, directed to the front. Pinacosaurus differs from Crichtonpelta in the lack of an ornamented rear edge of the skull roof and in the cheek horn not being curved upwards. A P. grangeri specimen compared to an average human male Arbour also provided a list of traits in which P. grangeri and P. mephistocephalus differed from each other. P. grangeri has a notch in the snout armour just above the innermost nostril opening. P. mephistocephalus has squamosal horns extending to behind beyond the rear of the skull roof, their points representing the widest point of the skull, instead of the upper rims of the eye sockets. P. mephistocephalus also has a clear transverse narrowing of the skull roof at level of the lacrimals, just in front of the eye sockets. It had been suggested that the rear skull roof of P. mephistocephalus was more convex but Arbour concluded it essentially had the same curvature. The holotype of P. mephistocephalus has very long cheek horns but a juvenile specimen, MPC 100/1344, found as part of a P. grangeri group, shows a similar elongation. Skeleton Hind view of mounted skeleton cast of P. mephistocephalus The adult skulls known have a length of about thirty centimetres. Pinacosaurus has exceptionally smooth praemaxillae, front snout bones, forming the bone core of the upper beak, that was in life covered with a horn sheet. The maxilla bears about fourteen teeth. A typical and remarkable element of ankylosaurine skulls is that the nostril is in the shape of a large \\"narial vestibule\\" in which several smaller oval holes are present. With Pinacosaurus there are at least three per side. Gilmore already noticed this configuration in the original specimen. To allow a comparison between the holes of the several ankylosaurine species, they have been dubbed \\"A\\", \\"B\\" and \\"C\\". The top hole A seems to access the main air-passage of the nasal cavity. In P. grangeri this hole is visible in top view through a notch in the snout armour, whereas in P. mephistocephalus the armour overhangs the hole. The opening pattern is characteristic of the genus: in Pinacosaurus the C hole is below the A hole and the B opening is on the lower outer side of the vestibule. In Pinacosaurus juveniles the C hole seems to consist of secondary smaller openings of varying number: Godefroit et al. described four pairs of openings in total in 1999, and in 2003 a juvenile specimen with five pairs of openings was described. The extra C openings have been named C2 and C3. The precise function of this arrangement is unclear. There are several chambers in the praemaxilla and maxilla to which these holes are connected but it has also been suggested that some extra holes are the result of damage. The larger number with juveniles could be explained by cartilage sheets not having been ossified yet. The skull of a juvenile Pinacosaurus grangeri on the left, compared with those of Anodontosaurus lambei The visible sutures of the skull elements in juvenile specimens allowed for the first time to determine their precise arrangement. They generally consisted of indistinctly formed simple shapes. Several skull openings like the antorbital fenestra and the temporal fenestrae apparently closed at a very young age for they are no longer visible even in the juveniles found. The squamosal horn does not cover the entire squamosal, creating the illusion that an additional skull bone is present in front of the horn. Marya≈Ñska in 1977 thought that this was a tabular bone, otherwise unknown in dinosaurs, proving that the Ankylosauria had independently evolved from the Aetosauria, a hypothesis today entirely discarded. Godefroit in 1999 called it a \\"secondary dermal squamosal\\". A real distinctive trait is that the quadratojugal touches the postorbital, whereas in other Thyreophora for which the condition is known, these bones are separated by the jugal. Usually it is assumed that this configuration is not unique for Pinacosaurus but a synapomorphy of the Ankylosauridae as a whole. In 2015, a juvenile specimen was described showing a complex hyoid bone or tongue bone apparatus. It included paraglossalia at the sides, paired first and second ceratobranchials and higher epibranchials. Also the bone structure suggested that in the middle a cartilaginous basihyal was present. The strong development of the hyoid would indicate that a powerful tongue compensated for the weakly developed dentition. It was inferred that all dinosaurs had such complex tongue bones but that these were generally lost during fossilisation. Metacarpus of a juvenile specimen Life reconstruction of a Pinacosaurus by Jack Mayer Wood The postcranial skeleton of the known fossils is rather lightly built. Most of these represent juveniles, however: even specimen IMM 96BM3/1, the P. mephistocephalus holotype, is no longer than about . Juveniles had four rear back vertebrae fused into a \\"sacral rod\\", three true sacrals, and a tail base of seven vertebrae possessing transverse processes. Behind these about eight \\"free\\" vertebrae are present, followed by about twenty vertebrae stiffened by projections and forming the \\"handle\\" of the tail club. Like all ankylosaurids, Pinacosaurus had a bony club at the end of its tail which it likely used as a defensive weapon against predators. This club was relatively small. The torso is very flat. The forelimbs are moderately robust; the P. mephistocephalus holotype has a quite robust humerus and ulna, however. The hand is completely known, which is exceptional for ankylosaurids. It has five digits, and the phalangeal formula is 2-3-3-3-2, meaning that the innermost finger of the forelimb has two bones, the next has three, etc. The metatarsals are closely appressed and held vertical. The claws are hoof-shaped. Limb bones MPC 100/1305 with Saichania skull cast, showing armour on back and limbs In the pelvis, the ilia flare strongly outwards to the front. The ischium is thin and curves forwards. The hindlimbs are moderately robust. The shinbone has a wide underside with well-formed condyles. Currie therefore assumed that the lower leg articulated directly with the metatarsus, the inner part of the astragalus and the entire calcaneum being absent or non-ossified cartilage elements. As in all known ankylosaurids, the foot has three toes, not four as Marya≈Ñska assumed in 1977, misled by the damaged specimen ZPAL MgD‚àíII/9. The phalangeal formule of the toes is variable: most individuals have 0‚àí3‚àí3‚àí4‚àí0 but some exemplars possess an extra penultimate phalanx in the third toe, resulting in 0-3-4-4-0, while others lack a phalanx in the fourth toe, which causes a 0-3-3-3-0 configuration. Osteoderms The configuration of the skin ossifications, or osteoderms, of the body is partly known: no single specimen conserves a complete set. Additional information can be gleaned from the larger specimen MPC 100/1305, a possible Pinacosaurus exemplar. The neck is protected by two cervical halfrings, consisting of keeled rectangular segments fused to an underlying bone band. This band is completely ossified even in juvenile individuals. Godefroit assumed Pinacosaurus differed from other species in having three or four segments instead of the usual six, but Arbour concluded that the normal number was in fact present. The sides of the rump and the tail were occupied by moderately long, flat, recurved, triangular spikes. Parallel rows of smaller oval keeled osteoderms were present on the back. A continuous \\"sacral shield\\" on the hip, made of fused plates, is absent. Classification Originally placed in the Nodosauridae by Gilmore, Pinacosaurus is now considered to be an ankylosaurid and a likely member of the Ankylosaurinae. As indicated by Thompson et al. 2012, the difference in the relative position of the two Pinacosaurus species between the respective analyses, is influenced by the fact that the best preserved P. grangeri skulls are from juveniles, while the holotype of P. mephistocephalus is an adult with a skull that is longer than it is wide, which might cause a more basal position of the latter. P. grangeri skull P. mephistocephalus skull The following cladogram is based on the 2015 phylogenetic analysis of the Ankylosaurinae conducted by Arbour and Currie: Paleobiology Skull of juvenile P. grangeri The habitat of Pinacosaurus consisted of a semi-desert interspersed with oases. No large theropods are known to have inhabited the ecosystem, though smaller ones like Velociraptor were present. It has been suggested that the relatively light build of Pinacosaurus was an adaptation to gain agility to better fight small theropods, the moderately large club being fast enough to hit these swift targets. In the group of juveniles found together at Bayan Mandahu, the individuals were all oriented into the same direction, suggesting they represent a travelling true herd simultaneously killed and covered by a sandstorm. It is remarkable that the members of such groups are all of about the same age, having an average length of circa 1.5 metres. This could be explained by the larger individuals being able to extract themselves from the sand, leaving the small members of the herd behind but in that case it is strange that no very young animals were found, the smallest being about one metre in length. The concentration of fossils at Alag Teeg has been explained as caused by a drying pool, but later research showed the sediments were deposited during a flood. During their ontogenetic development, in juveniles at first the ribs fused with their vertebrae. The forelimbs strongly increased in robustness, while the hindlimbs did not become larger relative to the rest of the skeleton, indicating that the arms bore most of the weight. In the cervical halfrings, the underlying bone band developed outgrowths connecting it with the underlying osteoderms, which simultaneously fused to each other. On the skull, the caputegulae first ossified at the snout and the rear rim; gradually the ossification extended towards the middle regions. On the rest of the body, the ossification process progressed from the neck onwards in the direction of the tail. A juvenile specimen of Pinacosaurus preserves large paraglossalia (triangular bones or cartilages located in the tongue) which show signs of muscular stress, and it is thought this was a common feature of ankylosaurs. Pinacosaurus and other ankylosaurs likely relied heavily on muscular tongues and hyobranchia (tongue bones) when feeding, since their teeth were fairly small and were replaced at a relatively slow rate. Some modern salamanders have similar tongue bones, and use prehensile tongues to pick up food. Though Pinacosaurus may not have fed on fibrous and woody plants, they may have had a more varied diet, including tough leaves and pulpy fruits. Inversely, this might suggest ant-eater-like insectivorous behaviour.

Biography  Turner was raised in Oakland, California, the youngest child of a Pullman porter father and a homemaker and nurse mother. He attended Cole Elementary School and McClymonds High School in Oakland and Berkeley High School. Turner got his first training in cartooning via a correspondence course. During World War II, where he served as a mechanic with Tuskegee Airmen, his illustrations appeared in the newspaper Stars and Stripes. After the war, while working for the Oakland Police Department, he created the comic strip Baker's Helper.Morrie Turner at the Lambiek Comiclopedia. Retrieved on January 27, 2014. Archived from the original on January 27, 2014. When Turner began questioning why there were no minorities in cartoons, his mentor, Peanuts cartoonist Charles M. Schulz, suggested he create one. Morris' first attempt, Dinky Fellas, featured an all- black cast, but found publication in only one newspaper, the Chicago Defender. Turner integrated the strip, renaming it Wee Pals, and in 1965 it became the first American syndicated comic strip to have a cast of diverse ethnicity. Although the strip was only originally carried by five newspapers, it was picked up by more than 100 after the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. in April 1968. In 1970 Turner became a co-chairman of the White House Conference on Children and Youth. Turner appeared as a guest on the May 14, 1973, episode of Mister Rogers' Neighborhood, where he showed the host pictures he had drawn of several of his neighbors. Turner also presented a clip from his Kid Power animated series, which was airing Saturday mornings on ABC at the time. As well, during the 1972-73 television season, Wee Pals on the Go was aired by ABC's owned-and-operated station in San Francisco, KGO-TV. This Sunday morning show featured child actors who portrayed the main characters of Turner's comic strip: Nipper, Randy, Sybil, Connie and Oliver. With and through the kids, Turner explored venues, activities and objects such as a candy factory and a train locomotive. As the comic strip continued, Turner added characters of more and more ethnicities, as well as a child with a physical disability. During the Vietnam War, Turner and five other members of the National Cartoonist Society traveled to Vietnam, where they spent a month drawing more than 3,000 caricatures of service people. For concerts by the Bay Area Little Symphony of Oakland, California, Turner drew pictures to the music and of children in the audience. Turner launched the first in a series of Summer Art exhibitions at the East Oakland Youth Development Center (EOYDC) on June 10, 1995.  Personal life  Turner married Letha Mae Harvey on April 6, 1946; they collaborated on \\"Soul Corner,\\" the weekly supplement to Wee Pals. Morrie and Letha had one son, Morrie Jr;Ink-Slinger Profiles: Morrie Turner Letha died in 1994. Late in life, Turner's companion was Karol Trachtenburg of Sacramento. Turner died on January 25, 2014, at age 90.  Tributes  In 1967, cartoonist Bil Keane created the Family Circus character Morrie, a playmate of Billy and the only recurring black character in the strip, based on Turner.  Awards  In 2003, the National Cartoonists Society recognized Turner for his work on Wee Pals and others with the Milton Caniff Lifetime Achievement Award. Throughout his career, Turner was showered with awards and community distinctions. For example, he received the Brotherhood Award from the National Conference of Christians and Jews and the Inter-Group Relations Award from the Anti-Defamation League of Bnai Brith. In 1971, he received the Alameda County (California) Education Association Layman's Annual Award.Turner entry, Who's Who of American Comic Books, 1928‚Äì1999. Accessed January 27, 2013. In 2000, the Cartoon Art Museum presented Turner with the Sparky Award, named in honor of Charles Schulz. Turner was honored a number of times at the San Diego Comic-Con: in 1981, he was given an Inkpot Award; and in 2012 he was given the Bob Clampett Humanitarian Award.

While outside architectural influences are apparent in much of Norwegian architecture, they have often been adapted to meet Norwegian climatic conditions, including: harsh winters, high winds and, in coastal areas, salt spray. Norway's architectural trends are also seen to parallel political and societal changes in Norway over the centuries. Prior to the Viking Age, wooden structures developed into a sophisticated craft evident in the elegant and effective construction of the Viking longships. Following that, the ascent of Christianity introduced Romanesque architecture in cathedrals and churches, with characteristically slightly pointed arches, barrel vaults, cruciform piers supporting vaults, and groin vaults; in large part as a result of religious influence from England. During the Middle Ages, the geography dictated a dispersed economy and population. As a result, the traditional Norwegian farm culture remained strong, and Norway differed from most European countries in never adopting feudalism. This, combined with the ready availability of wood as a building material, ensured that relatively few examples of the Baroque, Renaissance, and Rococo architecture styles so often built by the ruling classes elsewhere in Europe, were constructed in Norway. Instead, these factors resulted in distinctive traditions in Norwegian vernacular architecture, which have been preserved in existing farms in the many Norwegian open-air museums that showcase buildings from the Middle Ages through to the 19th century; prominent examples include the Norsk Folkemuseum in Oslo and Maihaugen in Lillehammer, as well as extant buildings still in service on farms such as those in the Heidal valley. In the 20th century, Norwegian architecture has been characterized by its connection with Norwegian social policy on the one hand, and innovation on the other. Norwegian architects have been recognized for their work, both within Norway‚Äîwhere architecture has been considered an expression of social policy‚Äîand outside Norway, in several innovative projects. General features Construction in Norway has always been characterized by the need to shelter people, animals, and property from harsh weather, including predictably cold winters and frost, heavy precipitation in certain areas, wind and storms; and to make the most of scarce building resources. Until modern times, transportation infrastructure was also primitive, and builders largely had to rely on locally available materials. History=Pre-historic times Thanks to new digging methods like topsoil excavation, archeologists have been able to further uncover the remains or foundations of 400 prehistoric houses that were previously hidden beneath the ground. Prior to this only 200 sites were immediately visible from the surface layer. Throughout the 20th century, Scandinavian archeologists have also been attempting to reconstruct prehistoric houses. The largest reconstruction project in Norway is the Bronze age settlement at Forsand in Ryfylke and the Iron age farm at Ullandhaug close by Stavanger. There's also the rebuild of the large chieftain house from the Viking age at Borg in Lofoten. Most of our archeological material derives from surveys done in the 20th century, and excavations done in major cities the past 25 years [as of 2003], including other archeological surveys from the 80s and 90s. The oldest surviving traces of construction in Norway dates back to about 9000 BC, in mountainous regions near Store Myrvatn in contemporary Rogaland, where excavations have found portable dwellings most likely kept by nomadic reindeer hunters. Traces of similar albeit younger tents have also been found other places along the western coast: Kollsnes at √òygarden in Hordaland, on Slettnes, S√∏r√∏y, and Mortensnes close by Nesseby in Finnmark, and one dating back to around 6500 BC at Fosenstraumen near Rad√∏y in Hordaland. Stone age hunters must have used such simple tent and turf hut constructions, which in principle could have been very similar to those still in use by Sami nomads, with straight or hook-formed rods. The oldest turf hut had an approximately circle shaped floor plan and was built with two sets of hook latches (rafters that intersect at the roof ridge) which forms roof and walls as one element. For materials they probably used hides and wooden poles.Brekke, Nordhagen, and Lexau: Norsk arkitekturhistorie. Fr√• steinalder og bronsealder til det 21. √•rhundret. With time, such tents became semi-permanent through the introduction of a simple foundation, allowing people to stay in one place for longer parts of the year. These \\"houses\\" have a diameter of and covers an area of , and were found as oval pits that had been cleared for stones. In the centre of the building, there could well have been a fireplace, and a part of the floor could have been covered by a platform on which they could sleep on top of. They were also partly dug into the earth with external ramparts made of earth and stone. Traces of these constructions can be found along the whole coast, but especially in the north: Leksa i S√∏r-Tr√∏ndelag, Flatanger i Nord- Tr√∏ndelag, Mortensnes in Finnmark. The most notable of these is located at the Vega archipelago, an area that is now a UNESCO World Heritage Site. There have been many instances where several houses have been found together in a cluster. This suggests that multiple family groups that's been living together in the same place. On Vega, such houses were already in use by 7000 BC, and they were still in use 5000 years later, in the transition from the Stone age into the Bronze Age around 1800 BC. At this point, the houses became larger and they gained a rectangular form, covering an area of , as demonstrated at Gressbakken in Nesseby in Finnmark. Excavations have revealed that the inner walls were protected by thick ramparts of stone and peat, and there is evidence of several entrances through this rampart-wall. The roof construction of these buildings is uncertain, however. It is difficult to conclude whether the rafts rested on the ramparts or on top of posts. Since it is not uncommon to find several fireplaces along the mid axis of the house, it is deduced that multiple families stayed collectively at these larger houses. The first permanent dwellings were probably built between 3000 and 2000 BC, with the introduction of agriculture to Norway. Available evidence indicates that wood was the most used building material for these structures. Iron Age dwellings typically combined shelter for animals and humans in long houses in order to preserve heat. Remains of structures from the Stone Age through the Bronze Age and the Iron Age have been excavated at Forsand in Ryfylke, near Stavanger and several other locations. Most prehistoric longhouses had pairs of roof-bearing posts dividing the interior into three naves, and walls of palisades, wattle and daub or turf. Similar buildings have been excavated all over Northwestern Europe. Heddal Stave Church, Notodden, the largest stave church in Norway Viking and medieval eras Two distinctive timber building traditions found their confluence in Norwegian architecture. One was the practice of log building with horizontal logs notched at the corners, a technique thought to have been imported from the peoples to the east of Scandinavia. The other was the stave building tradition (typically found in stave churches), possibly based on improvements on the prehistoric longhouses that had roof-bearing posts dug into the ground. Although there is scant archaeological evidence of actual buildings from the earliest permanent structures, finds of Viking ships (e.g., the Oseberg ship) suggest significant mastery of woodworking and engineering. In the Lofoten archipelago in Northern Norway, a Viking chieftain's holding has been reconstructed at the Lofotr Viking Museum. Not counting the 28 remaining stave churches, at least 250 wooden houses predating the Black Death in 1350 are preserved more or less intact in Norway. Most of these are log houses, some with added stave-built galleries or porches. As the political power in Norway was consolidated and had to contend with external threats, larger structures were built in accordance with military technology at the time. Fortresses, bridges, and ultimately churches and manors were built with stone and masonry. These structures followed the European styles of their time. =Stave churches= Urnes stave church in Luster, Norway is listed as a world Heritage Site by UNESCO. Possibly more than 1000 stave churches were built in Norway during the Middle Ages, most of them during the 12th and 13th centuries. Until the beginning of the 19th century, as many as 150 stave churches still existed. Many were destroyed as part of a religious movement that favored simple, puritan lines, and today only 28 remain, though a large number were documented and recorded by measured drawings before they were demolished. The stave churches owe their longevity to architectural innovations that protected these large, complex wooden structures against water rot, precipitation, wind, and extreme temperatures. Most important was the introduction of massive sills underneath the staves (posts) to prevent them from rotting. Over the two centuries of stave church construction, this building type evolved to an advanced art and science. After the Reformation, however, no new stave churches were built. New churches were mainly of stone or horizontal log buildings with notched corners. Most old stave churches disappeared because of redundancy, neglect or deterioration, or because they were too small to accommodate larger congregations, and too impractical according to later standards. Romanesque architecture St Mary's Church in Bergen is an example of Romanesque architecture in Norway. The first stone churches in Norway were Romanesque, built under the influence of Anglo- Saxon missionaries, particularly bishop Nicholas Breakspear. Later churches were influenced by Continental architecture. Examples include the churches at Ringsaker, Kviteseid, and elsewhere. Many of these churches have either been lost or rebuilt in the Gothic style, but numerous examples still exist, notably the Trondenes Church at Trondenesin Troms. Gothic architecture Several churches that were originally built as Romanesque structures were modified or extended during the Gothic period. Among these are the cathedral of Hamar, now in ruins, the Stavanger Cathedral, and the renowned Nidaros Cathedral, one of the most important pilgrim destinations in medieval Europe. West face of the Nidaros Cathedral (originally Romanesque church, rebuilt and extended in the gothic style 1183‚Äì1248). Under Danish rule In the late Middle Ages, the Norwegian state was severely weakened. In 1389 Norway entered into a personal union with Denmark and Sweden in the Kalmar Union. As the kings resided in Denmark, Norway was gradually reduced to a provincial status, and after the Reformation most of its separate institutions were abolished. The Danish government in Copenhagen regarded Norway as a backward province to be exploited, but not worthy of investment in monumental architecture. Hence, ambitious Renaissance architecture is unusual in Norway compared to other European countries. Fortresses, such as Akershus in Oslo, Vard√∏hus in Vard√∏, T√∏nsberghus in T√∏nsberg, the Kongsg√•rden in Trondheim and Bergenhus with the Rosenkrantz Tower in Bergen were built in stone in accordance with standards for defensive fortifications of their time. Many of these were modernized and rebuilt through the years.Guthorm Kavli: Norges festninger : fra Fredriksten til Vard√∏hus, 1987. Oslo, Universitetsforlaget, The Hanseatic League also built unique commercial buildings at Bryggen in Bergen, starting in the 16th century. They were log buildings combining native and German traditions. Panoramic view of Bryggen. The eleven houses to the right were rebuilt after a fire in 1702. The six houses to the left were rebuilt after a fire in 1955. =Renaissance architecture= After the Black Death, monumental construction in Norway came to a standstill, except for vernacular building, only to be resumed in the 16th and 17th centuries under Danish administration. There are few examples of Renaissance architecture in Norway, the most prominent being the Rosenkrantz Tower in Bergen, Barony Rosendal in Hardanger, and the contemporary Austr√•t manor near Trondheim, and parts of Akershus Fortress.Kristel Christensen: Baroniet Rosendal major thesis at Norwegian University of Science and TechnologyH√•kon A. Andersen: Austr√•tt, 1996 Christian IV undertook a number of projects in Norway that were largely based on Renaissance architectureJoakim A. Skovgaard: A king's architecture: Christian IV and his buildings, London, 1973 . He established mining operations in Kongsberg and R√∏ros, now a World Heritage Site. After a devastating fire in 1624, the town of Oslo was moved to a new location and rebuilt as a fortified city with an orthogonal layout surrounded by ramparts, and renamed Christiania. King Christian also founded the trading city of Kristiansand, naming it after himself. =Baroque architecture= Fredrikshald / Fredriksten, a border town built to protect the Dano-Norwegian realm As Norway became a strategic part of the Danish-Norwegian kingdom, Danish kings built fortifications along borders and the seacoast. Over time, many of the fortifications at border areas and ports were modernized in line with Baroque military practice. Although most residences were built according to local vernacular traditions, some manors (such as Austr√•t and Rosendal) exhibit the influence of Baroque architecture. Only the city of Christiania (Oslo) had a building code that prohibited wooden houses, and a number of large town houses modeled after Continental building types were constructed. Some large churches were constructed with brick walls, notably in Bergen, Christiania, R√∏rosSverre √òdegaard: Bergstaden R√∏ros, 1997 and Kongsberg.Gunvor Thingstad B√∏en, H√∏lje B√∏en: Kongsberg kirke : bergstadens juvel, 2003, Probably the most famous Baroque structure in Norway is Stiftsg√•rden, the Royal residence in Trondheim, a residential building that is one of the largest wooden structure in Northern Europe. =Rococo architecture= Damsg√•rd Manor in Bergen is an example of Norwegian rococo architecture. Rococo provided a brief but significant interlude in Norway, appearing primarily in the decorative arts, and mainly in interiors, furniture and luxury articles such as table silver, glass and stoneware. In some country districts, folk artists produced the distinctly Norwegian craft of decorative painting, rosemaling, and related wood carving style. In polite architecture, a few wooden town houses and manors show rococo influence, notably in Trondheim and Bergen, Damsg√•rd Manor in Bergen being the most significant. In towns and central country districts during the 18th century, log walls were increasingly covered by weatherboards, a fashion made possible by sawmill technology. These buildings were better insulated and better protected against the harsh climate. But the main reason for the rapid adoption of this custom was the more fashionable appearance of boarded walls, which were more suitable than bare log walls as a background to details and ornaments borrowed from classical architecture. 19th century The Napoleonic Wars led to the separation of Norway and Denmark. Norway was restored in 1814 as an autonomous kingdom in a personal union with Sweden. The two states had separate institutions, except for the king and the foreign service. Regained statehood required new public buildings, mainly in the capital of Christiania. During the following century, the country experienced impressive growth in wealth and population, resulting in a need for new infrastructure and buildings. =Neo- classicism= The Royal Palace at Oslo, an example of neo-Classical architecture in Norway At the dawn of the 19th century, less than a handful of academically trained architects were active in Norway, most of them military officers having studied civil engineering. The market for architects was limited in a sparsely inhabited country with no capital city, no court and no important government institutions. Architecture was of interest mainly to a limited group of wealthy merchants and landowners. However, toward the close of the previous century, this group saw a remarkable increase in prosperity. Large fortunes were made by a few, who then sought to surround themselves with buildings and gardens appropriate to their social position. Well connected internationally, these people were acquainted with the latest trends in architecture. Neoclassical structures were much in demand. Architect Carl Frederik Stanley (1769‚Äì1805), educated in Copenhagen, spent some years in Norway around the turn of the 19th century. He did minor works for wealthy patrons in and around Oslo, but his major achievement was the renovation of the only seat of higher education in Christiania, the Oslo Katedralskole, completed in 1800. He added a classical portico to the front of an older structure, and a semi-circular auditorium that was sequestered by Parliament in 1814 as a temporary place to assemble, now preserved at Norsk Folkemuseum as a national monument. Christian Collett (1771‚Äì1833), a graduate of the Mining Academy at Kongsberg, designed the splendid Ulefoss manor, built between 1802 and 1807 by sawmill owner Niels Aall. This is one of the few brick houses in Norway, boasting a palladian layout, a central cupola, and a classical colonnade. Collett designed several other manors and town houses. The same period saw the erection of a large number of splendid neo-classisist houses in and around all towns along the coast, notably in Halden, Oslo, Drammen, Arendal, Bergen and Trondheim, mainly wooden buildings dressed up as stone architecture. By far the largest private house in Norway is the Jarlsberg manor, renovated 1812‚Äì14 by the Danish architect L√∏ser for count Herman Wedel-Jarlsberg. Christiania, promoted to the status of a capital city in 1814, had practically no buildings suitable for the many new government institutions. An ambitious building program was initiated, but realised very slowly because of a strained economy. The first major undertaking was the Royal Palace, designed by Hans Linstow and built between 1824 and 1848. Linstow also planned Karl Johans gate, the avenue connecting the Palace and the city, with a monumental square halfway to be surrounded by buildings for the University, the Parliament (Storting) and other institutions. But only the University buildings were realised according to this plan.Det nye Slottet by Thomas Thiis-Evensen, in Aftenposten, June 24, 2000 Christian Heinrich Grosch, one of the first fully educated architects in Norway, designed the original building for the Oslo Stock Exchange (1826‚Äì1828), the local branch of the Bank of Norway (1828), Christiania Theatre (1836‚Äì1837), and the first campus for the University of Oslo (1841‚Äì1856).Elisabeth Seip (ed.) ; Jens Christian Eldal, Anne-Lise Seip, √Öse Moe Torvanger: Chr. H. Grosch : arkitekten som ga form til det nye Norge For the University buildings, he sought the assistance of the renowned German architect Karl Friedrich Schinkel.Aslaksby, Truls and Ulf Hamran: Arkitektene Christian Heinrich Grosch og Karl Friedrich Schinkel og byggingen av Det kongelige Frederiks Universitet i Christiania 1986, The German architectural influence persisted in Norway, and many wooden buildings followed the principles of Neoclassicism. =Romanticism and historicism= Trefoldighetskirken in Oslo Norwegian romantic nationalism also had an influence on Norwegian architecture from around 1840. Following the German lead, many classicist architects designed red-brick buildings in a revival of medieval styles. Romanesque and Gothic examples were considered eminently suitable for churches, public institutions and factories. Linstow was the first Norwegian architect to be inspired by the Middle Ages in his proposal of 1837 for a square to be surrounded by public building, bisected by an avenue between Christiania and the new Royal Palace. On the north side, planned buildings for the University were to be \\"composed in some Medieval or Florentine style\\", with exposed brick-work. His classicist colleague Grosch was the first to convert to historicism and realize a number of red-brick buildings, after his 1838 visit to Berlin, where he met the famous architect Karl Friedrich Schinkel. The first major historicist work by Grosch was the neo-romanesque Bazaars and the adjacent fire station near the Oslo Cathedral, begun in 1840 and extended in several stages until 1859. Other architects followed, notably Heinrich Ernst Schirmer with the Botsfengselet (penitentiary) (1844‚Äì1851), the Gaustad Hospital (1844‚Äì1855) and the Railway Station (1854) (with von Hanno). Also in Oslo, the German architect Alexis de Chateauneuf (1799-1853) designed Trefoldighetskirken, the first neo-gothic church, completed by von Hanno in 1858. Most urban apartment buildings and villas continued to be built in the classical tradition, with plastered brick walls. The repertoire of historic styles was expanded in Homansbyen, Oslo's first residential development of detached villas, planned by Georg Andreas Bull. He designed most of the early villas built from 1858 until 1862 in a variety of styles, ranging from medieval to classicist and exotic. Dalen Hotel is a good example of the so-called \\"dragon style\\". From around 1840, architects started to design wooden buildings in a new style, the so-called Swiss chalet style.Jens Christian Eldal: Historisme i tre: \\"sveitserstil\\", byggeskikks-romantikk og nasjonal egenart i europeisk og norsk trearkitektur p√• 1800-tallet 1998. Scandinavian University Press. The style and its name originated in Germany, where Swiss popular culture was much admired by the romanticists. Elements such as projecting roofs, verandas and emphasis on gables were inspired from Alpine vernacular buildings. But the style may more correctly be termed historicism in wood, a term introduced by Jens Christian Eldal. A number of residential, institutional, and commercial buildings were built in this style, characterized by ornate, projecting details. Railway stations and churches, designed by trained architects, were distributed all in rural districts and helped to make this style popular and to keep it alive in the vernacular tradition long after it went out of fashion among architects. The Swiss chalet-style evolved into a Scandinavian variation, known in Norway as the \\"dragon style‚Äù, which combined motifs from Viking and medieval art with vernacular elements from the more recent past. The most renowned practitioner of this style was the architect Holm Hansen Munthe, who designed a number of tourist resorts, exhibition pavilions and churches in the 1880s and 1890s. These caught the eye of the German emperor Wilhelm II, who visited Norway annually. He commissioned Munthe to design his \\"Matrosenstation\\" near Potsdam and a hunting lodge with a \\"stave church\\" in Rominten in East Prussia. These last buildings were destroyed during World War II. Architects abandoned both the \\"Swiss\\" and the \\"dragon\\" styles shortly after 1900, but elements of the \\"Swiss style\\" survived in vernacular buildings for some decades. In the recent past, producers of pre-fabricated family homes have increasingly reintroduced motifs from the \\"Swiss\\" style in their repertoire. Vernacular architecture Tr√∏nderl√•ne - example of vernacular architecture typically found in Tr√∏ndelag Until the 20th century, most Norwegians lived and worked in buildings that were designed and built according to vernacular building traditions, what in Norwegian is known as byggeskikk. These practices varied somewhat by region and climatic conditions and evolved over time, but were largely based on use of wood and other locally available resources.Peter M. Anker: Norsk folkekunst: kunsth√•ndverk og byggeskikk i det gamle bondesamfunnet. 2004. Oslo. Cappelen. Since the Middle Ages, most dwellings were log houses with notched corners, carefully crafted to ensure protection against the elements. Centrally placed open-hearth fires with smoke vents in the roofs gave way to stone stoves and chimneys in early modern times. Specialized buildings became commonplace, organized around farmyards or g√•rdstun. The introduction of exterior boarding (weatherboarding) in the 18th century improved housing standards considerably and gave rise to larger houses. Building practices along the coast also included boathouses, fishing cottages, piers, etc. Here, houses for livestock and people were typically built up from the actual shoreline. A typical medium-sized farm in the inland of Norway would include a dwelling house (v√•ningshus), hay barn (l√•ve), livestock barn (fj√∏s), one or more food storage houses (stabbur), a stable, and occasionally separate houses for poultry, pigs, etc. Houses that had separate heat sources, e.g., washing houses (eldhus) and smithies were usually kept separate from the other houses to prevent fires. Outhouses were typically separate, small structures. If the farm housed craftsmen, there would also be separate houses for carpentry, wheel making, shoemaking, etc. In Eastern inland Norway and Tr√∏ndelag, the houses around a tun were typically organized in a square (firkanttun); in Gudbrandsdal, there was a distinction between inntun (inner tun) and uttun (outer tun). The configuration of houses also depended on whether the farm was situated on a hill or in flatter terrain. Depending upon the size and economic well-being of the farm, there might also be a feast hall (oppstue), a house for the retired farmers (f√∏der√•dstue), farm hands' dormitory (drengstue), carriage house (vognskjul), and even distillery (brenneskur). Smaller, poorer farms might combine barns and dwelling houses, have simpler storage areas, and use the facilities of other farms for activities they could not afford to build houses for. Building traditions varied by region and type of structure. Food storage houses ‚Äì stabbur ‚Äì were usually built on stilts in ways that made it difficult for mice and rats, but not cats, to get in. Exterior cladding varied by region, often to take into account local climate conditions. Roofs were often covered with birch bark and sod. Many places in Norway farms also maintained mountain farms (seter/st√∏l), where cows, goats, and sheep would put out to pasture during the summer months. These would typically include a small dwelling house and a dairy for making and storing cheese, sour cream, etc. Modern Norwegian farms often maintain many building traditions but no longer need the many and varied buildings of the past. However, many of the traditions have been carried on in more recently built vacation cabins in the mountains and along the coast. 20th-century architecture The German influence brought into Norway by neo-classicism abated when Norway gained full independence in 1905. A new generation of Norwegian architects educated in Sweden took the lead in developing a distinctly national architecture, endeavouring to break the German historicist tradition. However, German modernism and town planning continued to influence early 20th-century architecture. As the Norwegian Institute of Technology was founded in 1910 and began to teach architecture in Trondheim, there also emerged a distinctly Norwegian collegium of architects that has contributed to a Norwegian regional architecture, discussed by the art historian Sigfried Giedeon. =Art Nouveau architecture= Jugendstilsenteret - The Jugendstil Centre in √Ölesund The Jugendstil, a variant of Art Nouveau, had a certain influence on much of the new construction in Norway around the turn of the 20th century. The city of √Ölesund, after burning to the ground in 1904, was rebuilt almost entirely in this style and continues to be a prominent example, along with Riga and Brussels.Harald Grytten et al.: Fugl F√∏niks: √Ölesund opp av asken 2004. Trondheim also has numerous art nouveau buildings. In the capital Oslo, few art nouveau buildings were erected, due to a local economic crisis and a stagnant building trade during the first decade of the century. However, some public buildings were constructed in this style, such as the Historical Museum and the Government office building. In Bergen, the main theatre Den Nationale Scene is a monumental example. =Mass residential architecture= Changing demographics and a growing social awareness led to increased political and architectural interest in providing cost-effective, sanitary, and comfortable residential space to the growing urban population in general and the working class in particular. This was known as boligsaken (\\"the housing cause\\") in Norwegian popular culture and continues to play a role to this day.Ulf Gr√∏nvold: Hundre √•rs nasjonsbygging: arkitektur og samfunn 1905 - 2005. Pax forlag. 2005. Not unlike other countries during the evolution of their economies, Architecture became a tool for and manifestation of social policy, with architects and politicians determining just what features were adequate for the intended residents of housing projects. As late as in 1922, there were many who felt that working-class families had no need for their own bath; apartments and small houses only included a small kitchen and one or two rooms. Before World War II, a number of cooperative investment projects known as \\"egne hjem\\" (roughly \\"our own homes\\") resulted in a handful of developments, but after the war these gave way to cooperative organizations that were formed to finance and build large-scale residential complexes. The largest-- Oslo Bolig og Sparelag, known as OBOS‚Äîbuilt its first complex Etterstad in Oslo, but there were similar initiatives throughout the country. These co-ops set standards for housing, hired architects to design solutions, and contracted to have them built. Entire sections, known as drabantbyer - or \\"satellite cities\\" - were built in the outskirts of major cities. The first of these - Lambertseter - introduced an entirely new phenomenon in the eastern areas of Oslo such as in Groruddalen, but similar areas also emerged in Bergen, Trondheim, and other cities. The apex of this trend was reached in 1966 with the massive buildings in Ammerudlia. This era‚Äîwhich had spent most of its force by the mid-1970s‚Äîled to an increased awareness of the physical and emotional needs of city dwellers. Some of the issues under debate were. * Kitchen - traditional Norwegian homes combined the family room and kitchen, but in early apartment buildings, small, so-called \\"laboratory kitchens\\" were popular. Over time, eat-in-kitchens took their place. * Natural light--large apartment buildings were oriented to provide sunlight to the residents, ideally orienting the kitchen toward the east to get the morning light and the living room to the west for evening light. * Privacy--providing separate sleeping quarters for parents and children, and among children led to larger apartments over time. Similarly, most buildings had a limited number of apartments adjoining each staircase. * Alienation - monolithic, homogenous apartment complexes reinforced what some characterized as \\"social democracy's hell.\\" The perceived shortcomings of the mass housing movement led to efforts to create cost-effective housing solutions that were more varied, more integrated with natural surroundings, and above all more customized to families' needs. In 1973, the Parliament of Norway recommended a shift toward small residential houses rather than large apartment buildings. The Norwegian State Housing Bank (Husbanken) provided citizens with the ability to fund construction of their homes, and an entire construction industry formed to build these needs. As a result of the pioneering efforts by Olav Selvaag and others, archaic and otherwise unnecessary restrictions were relaxed, improving opportunities for more Norwegians to build housing to suit their individual needs and preferences. Norwegians often undertake home improvement projects on their own, and many have built most of their own homes. =Functionalism= Villa Eide in Bergen, example of \\"funkis\\" architecture In the late 1920s, Modernism (or the International style) was taken up by Scandinavian architects. In Scandinavia this architectural trend was called Functionalism (or colloquially in Sweden and Norway \\"funkis\\"). Modernism found many adherents among young architects, especially in Norway. Its definite breakthrough was the Stockholm Exhibition in 1930, after which the majority of architects all over Scandinavia converted to the modern movement. Nowhere else did Modernism become so firmly established as the mainstream trend in architecture. It maintained its dominant position until about 1940. A number of landmark structures, particularly in Oslo, were built in the functionalist style, the first one being the Skansen restaurant (1925‚Äì1927) by Lars Backer, demolished in 1970. Backer also designed the restaurant at Ekeberg, opened in 1929. The art gallery Kunstnernes Hus by Gudolf Blakstad and Herman Munthe- Kaas (1930) still shows influence from the preceding classicist trend of the 1920s. Hvalstrand bath (1934)Bernt Bucher-Johannessen, Eira Kjernlie and Peter Lawrance: Hvalstrand bad : maten, arkitekturen, historien. Schibsted, is one of several public seaside bath facilities in Norway, by Andr√© Peters. A year before, Ingierstrand Bad was designed by Ole Lind Schistad (1891‚Äì1979) and Eivind Moestue(1893‚Äì1977). Other great names of Norwegian functionalist architecture are Ove Bang, Fridtjof Reppen, Nicolai Beer (1885‚Äì1950) and Per Grieg (1897‚Äì1962). =Reconstruction architecture= Following the scorched earth tactics of retreating Wehrmacht troops, large areas in Northern Norway needed to be rebuilt. In 1945, there was an overwhelming need for housing. An architectural competition produced several designs for simple, cost-effective, and rapidly assembled housing. The resulting houses were Spartan and broke with building standards, but met an immediate need for shelter.Ingebj√∏rg Hage: Som fugl f√∏niks av asken? : gjenreisingshus i Nord-Troms og Finnmark. Gyldendal. Oslo. 1999. The Museum of Reconstruction in Hammerfest is dedicated to the reconstruction. =Government-sponsored architecture= National Theatre in Oslo As Norway gained full independence in 1905, the national government determined to establish institutions consistent with the newly formed state's ambitions as a modern society. The first prime minister made it a priority to modernize the Royal Palace in Oslo, building among other things, some of the country's first water toilets, providing hot and cold water, and granting the Royal Family's wish of providing a common apartment for the king, queen, and their son. In the early years, such public works were limited to structures needed for the national government's own administrative needs, but an increasing number of large-scale projects were conceived, designed, and completed since 1905 to meet various needs, such as: * Public health and welfare, including: ** Hospital complexes and polyclinical facilities, e.g., Rikshospitalet, Haukeland University Hospital, Gaustad Hospital,John Arne Balto, (ed.): Norsk sykehusarkitektur, special edition of annual journal of Fortidsminneforeningen, 2000. etc. ** Orphanages, later vacated in favor of other solutions that in turn required their own architecture. ** Sanatoria, also vacated as the public health problem of tuberculosis was solvedDag Skogheim: Frisk luft og diett: norske tuberkulosesanatorier, article in annual journal for Fortidsminneforeningen, 2000. ** Temporary and provisional housing for the indigent, asylum seekers, and homeless. * Sports and recreation facilities. Social policy in Norway both at the national and local level has emphasized the connection between athletics at the mass and elite levels, and athletic centers have typically been built both to accommodate spectators, participants, and training. As an example, the Holmenkollen ski jump has been rebuilt several times, the Bislett Stadion was rebuilt in 2004-2005, and virtually every municipality has built year-round facilities.Johan-Ditlef Martens: Idrettsanlegg og estetikk, 2001. Oslo. * Centers for cultural expression. Some of the most ambitious and controversial structures have been those dedicated to performing arts, art museums, and any combination of such activities. Since many of these have been built in cities with an architectural legacy, their designs have sought‚Äîmore or less successfully‚Äîto complement the urban landscape by giving it a modern element. Examples include the Henie-Onstad Art Centre (by Jon Eikvar and Sven Erik Engebretsen), Chateau Neuf by Lund & Slaatto, the \\"barn\\" at Hedmarkmuseet by Sverre Fehn, and the Grieg Hall (by Knud Munk). * Churches. The Norwegian State Church, holding the legacy of nearly one thousand years of Norwegian church architecture, commissioned new churches that covered a wide range of architectural styles, including entirely new designs (e.g. the Arctic Cathedral by Jan Inge Hovig) to new casts of traditional designs (e.g., Veldre church, by Roar Jacobsen and Ulf Zettersten.)Arne E. S√¶ther: Kirken som bygg og bilde : rom og liturgi ved et tusen√•rsskifte : en bok om kirkebygging f√∏r, n√• og i fremtiden. Asker, 2001 Reidun Mellem: Tromsdalskjerka fyller f√∏rti. 2005. * Transportation infrastructure, including bridges, tunnels, and most notably transit centers for rail, sea, and air transportation. Oslo airport (by the Aviaplan consortium at Gardermoen) was Norway's largest construction project ever.Trond Bergh, Helge Ryggvik, Jon Gulowsen: Jernbanen i Norge 1854-2004, 2004. Lars Elnan: Luftslottet: materiell og arkitektur ved Oslo Lufthavn - Gardermoen, major thesis in sociology at the University of Oslo The architectural designs of these projects have reflected not only the style currents of their time, but the societal debate over the purpose they were intended to serve. Nationalistic ambitions early on gave way to austere designs based on functionalism, and then to designs that emphasized human and ecological needs. To a great extent, Norwegian architects have found the opportunity to develop their signature styles through these projects, and thereby also a Norwegian architectural dialect. Many of the projects have been controversial, and the resulting creative tension has probably served to advance the state of architectural arts in Norway. National and local governments and governmental institutions will continue to be among the largest customers of architects in coming years. Contemporary themes Rica Seilet Hotel in Molde A number of trends influence contemporary architecture in Norway, among them: * Growing public and private affluence. Buildings have a wider range of purpose, and are expected to meet increasingly complex demands. For example, the new opera building (designed by Sn√∏hetta) in Oslo reflects an ambition not just to build a vibrant cultural center, but also to create a new architectural icon in the Oslofjord. * Aesthetics as a factor of well-being. From the early austere principle that form should strictly follow function, there is a growing sensibility that aesthetics affect the physical and emotional health of those who use a building or structure. Norwegian laws concerning occupational health have for several decades emphasized access to daylight and fresh air, and it may also be that harsh climatic conditions create an added imperative for uplifting aesthetics. * Environmental concerns. In addition to concerns about air and water pollution, Norwegian architectural design has also emphasized integration with the natural landscape. More recently, architects have also worked with engineers to make the most out of scarce resources, e.g., energy, water, etc. * Demographic diversity. Norwegian demographics have undergone significant changes the last few decades, resulting in new religious buildings * Norwegian building traditions. While it may be too much to speak of a renaissance in traditional Norwegian architecture, more and more urban planning is affected by the need to preserve or restore these traditions. Examples include plans to renew the center of Oppdal and recent work at the Oslo neighborhood of Gr√ºnerl√∏kka. A number of architectural prizes are awarded in Norway, including the Houen Foundation Award, Treprisen, Statens byggeskikkpris, Sundts premie, Betongelementprisen, Betongtavlen, Glassprisen, Murverksprisen, Stenprisen, and St√•lkonstruksjonsprisen.

Geography  McDowall is notable for the Raven Street Reserve, which is a 24.3 hectare bushland area surrounded by urban housing and busy roads. It is part of a long stretch of forest and green areas going from the mountains in the west to the mangrove areas on the coast. It has many species of wildflowers and grass trees (see image below) which when in flower have a long central flowering stem that attracts bees. Trees include weeping myrtle and native blueberry ash (Elaeocarpus reticulatus) with creek fauna such as water dragons (Physignathus lesueurii), turtles and native fish including the crimson spotted rainbow fish. There are also squirrel gliders, possums and scrub turkeys with occasionally a swamp wallaby being sighted. The bird life is abundant and in keeping with its name has a significant crow or raven population. History McDowall State School, which opened in January 1975, was named before the suburb itself. It was named in honour of Colonel John McDowall, who was a distinguished early-settler of the area. As the population grew, the Brisbane City Council considered naming the suburb Annand after Colonel Frederick Annand. This was disapproved of by local residents, who wanted the suburb to be named after the newly opened school. The name \\"McDowall\\" was therefore accepted for the area by the Place Names Board of Queensland in 1975. The bushland was protected by Greenbelt designation in 1950s when the local area was subdivided, and has been managed by council since 1972. McDowall's earliest housing establishments were built through the 1970s and very few houses in McDowall were built before then. More housing was later built in the 1980s and early 1990s, whereas defence housing was later developed during the early 21st century. In the the population of Mcdowall was 6,818. Local services All of McDowall's residential developments are in close proximity to either one of McDowall's two community- based shopping centres. The North-West Plaza is located on the southern end of McDowall and is anchored by a Woolworths supermarket. McDowall Village shopping centre is located on the northern end of McDowall and is anchored by Drakes Supermarket. Major shopping centres that are local to McDowall include Brookside Shopping Centre, Stafford City Shopping Centre and Westfield Chermside. Schools that serve the McDowall area include McDowall State School, Craigslea State School, Craigslea State High School, Northside Christian College and the Queen of Apostles Chuter St campus. A number of bus services also travel through the area going to local shopping centres such as Chermside, Aspley, and Brisbane City. Many of the roadways in McDowall are themed to commemorate noted celebrities and pioneers in the film and television industry, both locally and abroad. Dr. Valentine McDowall Park acknowledges the pioneering work in radio and television broadcasting in Queensland during the period 1920 - 1940. Demographics In the the population of Mcdowall was 6,818, 51.2% female and 48.8% male. The median age of the Mcdowall population was 38 years of age, 1 year above the Australian median. 78.5% of people living in Mcdowall were born in Australia, compared to the national average of 69.8%; the next most common countries of birth were England 3.3%, New Zealand 2.6%, South Africa 1.5%, Italy 1.3%, India 1.1%. 87.1% of people spoke only English at home; the next most common languages were 2.9% Italian, 1.3% Cantonese, 1% Mandarin, 0.5% Greek, 0.4% Hindi.

Comic characters like spaced-out surfer Jeff Spicoli fare well, while subtle characters like fast-food king and would-be ladies man Brad Hamilton are sanitized into blandness.\\"Fast Times at Ridgement High, The Info Archive Christopher Cornell, writing in The Philadelphia Inquirer, echoed the sentiment: \\"People who liked the movie (read: teenagers) will tune in expecting something like what they saw in the theater. But the network is going to have to completely eliminate the movie's cheerfully rampant drug use and tone down the lusty sexual content, so that parents won't be uncomfortable.\\" However, Borden calls Fast Times \\"the hippest look at high school life since the late, lamented Square Pegs few seasons back, yet it treats the teachers with compassion and respect. An \\"us vs. them\\" mentality is avoided.\\" Mike Duffy of the Detroit Press disagreed entirely, saying \\"With 'Fast Times,' we have 'Dull Pegs'.\\" Mark Dawidziak of the Akron Beacon Journal was far less than kind to the sitcom: \\"Just when you thought the CBS Wednesday schedule couldn't get any worse, along comes these two lethal stinkers (Fast Times and another series that preceded it, Tough Cookies).

For most of its existence it was located in the MS Jadran, a former Adriatic passenger ship that was permanently docked at the foot of Yonge Street at 1 Queens Quay West on Toronto's waterfront. The ship was moored off on a small laneway at the foot of Yonge Street called Captain John's Pier. Once a prestige destination, the restaurant was open every day of the year, including all major holidays such as Christmas and New Year's Day, for almost 40 years. When it opened, the waterfront was an industrial portland. The Harbourfront redevelopment turned the area into a recreational destination for residents and tourists and a residential neighbourhood; Captain John's helped begin a gentrification process that ultimately claimed it as a victim. History The MS Normac, first home of Captain John's Harbour Boat Restaurant, in Toronto Harbour The restaurant was owned and operated by John Letnik, who came to Canada as a refugee from FPR Yugoslavia in 1957. Letnik found work at an Etobicoke country club and ultimately becoming its chef before opening his own restaurant in 1961, the Pop Inn at Dundas and McCaul which he ran for seven years. He came up with the idea of opening an onboard restaurant while travelling to Europe via ship in the late 1960s to visit relatives. He opened Toronto's first floating restaurant aboard the in 1970. The Normac had served several years as a fire boat with the Detroit Fire Department and then as a ferry that traveled between Tobermory and Manitoulin Island. In 1975, Letnik bought the larger Jadran from the Yugoslav government for $1 million and moored it alongside the Normac, operating it as a second restaurant. The Jadran was one of three luxury cruise ships built in Split in 1957; it was one of 3 \\"J\\" Class passenger ferries built for Jadrolinija (Jadranska Linijska Plovidba company) at the Brodogradiliste shipyard, its sister ships being MS Jugoslavija and MS Jedinstvo.http://www.ssmaritime.com/MS-Jadran-and- Sisters.htm For several years the Jadran operated as a luxury cruise ship in the Adriatic and Aegean seas and later served as a private ocean-going presidential yacht for Yugoslav president Josip Broz Tito and his entourage. The floating ships were one of the first attractions in the area that became known as Harbourfront and was a pioneer in the waterfront's transformation from an industrial port to a recreational, artistic and residential area and tourist attraction. As well as being its owner, Letnik also served as one of its chefs. In 1976, Captain John's was the site of the first CHIN Radio annual bikini contest. The event was held at the restaurant again in 1977 before moving to Toronto Island the next year as part of the annual CHIN picnic. The PS Trillium, which struck the MS Normac in 1981 causing it to sink. On June 2, 1981 the Normac was struck by the Trillium, a ferry operated by Metro Toronto Parks. The crash was caused by a mechanical failure aboard the Trillium which prevented the engine from reversing to slow down. The crash occurred at relatively slow speed, as the Trillium was in the midst of attempting to dock.Letnik v Municipality of Metropolitan Toronto, [1985] FCJ No 238 (FCTD), rev'd in part [1988] 2 FC 399, 49 DLR (4th) 707 (Fed CA). None of the 132 passengers aboard the Trillium nor the 290 diners aboard the Normac were injured. Repairs were immediately made to the Normac, and for two weeks no leak was observed on board. However, on June 16, 1981, the Normac suddenly sank. This set off a long legal battle between Letnik and the city. The Federal Court initially ruled in favour of the city, as Letnik could not prove the collision caused the sinking, and because he failed to properly maintain the boat after converting it into a restaurant. This decision was overturned on appeal, and Letnik was awarded damages, though reportedly not enough to compensate for the destruction. While the legal battle was ongoing, the Toronto Harbour Commission ordered Letnik to remove the Normac from its resting site. Thus, in 1986, on the fifth anniversary of its sinking, the vessel was raised at an estimated cost of $100,000. The Normac was later refurbished and served as a floating restaurant in other communities. The Jadran was the sole home of Captain John's after then. In the 1970s and 1980s, the floating restaurant attracted prominent diners such as Bob Hope, Brian Mulroney, Mel Lastman, Robert Campeau, The Village People and Steve Stavro, and was a sought after location for weddings, bar mitzvahs and other events. However, in its latter years it lost favour as the city's gastronomical scene became more sophisticated and diverse and by 2002 Letnik was seeking bankruptcy protection Later reviews from local papers rated its culinary fare as average,Davey, Steven (July 10, 2003). \\"Abandon ship Waterside hideaway.\\" Now Toronto Magazine. Accessed December 2011. despite the restaurant's boasts of having \\"the best seafood in town!\\", and reviews by patrons were decidedly mixed. The restaurant's clientele was primarily tourists with many bus tours stopping at the venue, as well as wedding receptions, bar mitzvahs and other parties. By the twenty-first century, Captain John's was viewed by some as an out-of-date eyesore hurting the view from and the property values of a neighbouring condominium development. Bankruptcy, closure and sale In 2002 Captain John's filed for bankruptcy protection following a 10-year legal battle with his former common-law wife who the court ruled was entitled to a half-share of the restaurant. Owing over $5 million to various creditors including $3 million to unsecured creditors, Letnik's bankruptcy proposal involved the repayment of all unsecured creditors owed $5,000 or less and a repayment of no more than $30,000 to all other unsecured creditors. The restaurant staff, which once numbered in the dozens, was reduced to ten. In 2007, Letnik appealed his property tax bill arguing that the ship is not a \\"structure\\" under the law and thus cannot have property tax levied against it. The court ruled against him and a subsequent appeal was rejected as Letnik's unpaid back taxes mounted. Captain John's Harbour Boat Restaurant moored at the foot of Yonge St in 2011. Temporary 2008 closure after health department inspection In August 2008, Toronto public health officials ordered the restaurant closed after citing it for 11 separate infractions, including \\"Operator fail to maintain premises free of sewage back-up\\" and \\"Operator fail to ensure food is not contaminated/adulterated\\". The owner was fined $2,160. Attempts to sell In 2009 owner John Letnik put the restaurant up for sale at a list price of $1.5 million but was unable to sell it, even after reducing his asking price to $1.25 million. In June 2012, the Toronto Port Authority rescinded the lease agreement for the slip where the ship was moored, citing over $500,000 in payments owed for back taxes, rent and utility payments. At the same time the city shut off the boat's water supply, leading the health department to order the restaurant closed due to the staff's inability to sanitize dishes and wash their hands. Letnik was given until July 27, 2012, to remove the boat's gangplank and all restaurant signs, and the port authority invoked marine law ordering that the ship \\"must refrain from leaving\\" until its debts to the city and the authority is paid. The Jadrans engine had been removed, and the ship was mired in mud, requiring it to be towed as it could not sail under its own power. In September 2013, with Letnik owing more than $1 million in taxes, licensing fees, and berthing fees, the city initiated the process of seizing the vessel. Letnik declared he would not abandon the ship and might even chain himself to it. The Toronto Port Authority gave an August 22, 2014 deadline for the Jadran to be removed and scrapped and took bids from ship breakers for the job. The Federal Court declared the bid of entrepreneur James Sbrolla of the North American Seafood Exchange in the amount of $33,501 to be successful. Sbrolla hoped to restore the Jadran to a floating restaurant;https://www.thestar.com/videos.html?bcpid=2079935927001&bckey;=AQ~~,AAAAuO4KaJE~,gatFNwSKdGBwW50JIsnPiOaLt16ztXN4&bclid;=3609453870001&bctid;=3719592275001 however, the removal of the ship was delayed due to problems in having the hydro transformer removed, and plans to find a new berth for the ship fell through. Sbrolla then proposed to have tugboats tow the ship out of harbour and move it to a private slip at the foot of Parliament Street where the ship would be stripped of salvageable elements with the remainder of the ship to be scrapped. However, the Toronto Port Authority terminated the deal and returned Sbrolla's payment after rejecting his proposal as it would have required tearing the ship apart in harbour, a plan which the authority did not \\"feel comfortable proceeding with\\". Final voyage and scrapping The MS Jadran on its last voyage, being towed out of Toronto on May 28, 2015 by tugboats. The Port Authority returned to court the following spring for approval to seek a new buyer. On May 11, 2015, the Federal Court approved plans to have the Marine Recycling Corporation take ownership of the vessel and tow it to its facility at Port Colborne, Ontario by the end of the month to be scrapped. Due to a slump in world metal prices the value of the ship declined by an estimated $200,000 since the previous summer. As a result, the sale only consisted of the Port Authority, Waterfront Toronto and the condominium developer paying Marine Recycling Corporation to tow and scrap the ship for an undisclosed fee;https://www.thestar.com/business/2015/05/11/captain-johns- restaurant-sold-to-ship-scrapper-will-be-gone-by-end-of-may.html however, the estimated cost of the operation is $400,000. On May 28, 2015, the vessel was towed out of Toronto's harbour. Its departure was witnessed by a crowd of several hundred people and an impromptu band who had gathered for the occasion and was broadcast live on CP24. The ship was towed across Lake Ontario and through the Welland Canal to Port Colborne, where Marine Recycling Corporation has its scrapyard, in a journey that began at 10:30 am and concluded at 2:15 the following morning. Letnick was invited to travel aboard the ship for its entire final voyage, as a paid consultant, and stood on the ship's deck, waving to the crowd assembled on the dock, as the ship was towed out of its slip. Prior to the ship's departure, Letnick was thanked by Harbourmaster Angus Armstrong and Councillor Norm Kelly for his contribution to the city in creating the waterfront's first attraction at a time when it was an industrial area neglected by tourists and residents alike. Letnik was given a framed photograph of himself, in captain's uniform, in front of the ship in the 1970s and thanked for \\"a mission well-served and not soon forgotten.\\" The day before the ship sailed, Letnik received a reminder from the city that he still owed $814,656.12 in back property taxes. Legacy A port-hole and piece of steel of the MS Jadran were used in a memorial monument to British Home Children who perished in Canada. The monument is located at a mass grave in Park Lawn Cemetery in Toronto.

History  Bnei Atzmon was founded in 1979 in the Yamit region of the Sinai Peninsula as a response to Camp David Accords, which promoted trading territory for peace. In 1982, the settlement was relocated to the Gush Katif region of the Gaza Strip about three kilometres north of Rafah after the signing of the Israel- Egypt Peace Treaty and the subsequent eviction of all Jews living in Sinai and surrender of all land there. The settlement in Sinai was originally named Atzmona, but since that location was evacuated and Israeli law forbids renaming a new location with that of a previously existing legal entity, Bnei Atzmon (Sons of Atzmon - named after the Biblical border point of Israel (Numbers 34:4-5)) became the officially registered name. Nonetheless, it is more often referred to as Atzmona. The moshav's mostly Orthodox Jewish was associated with the Amana settlement organization. It was destroyed in 2005 by the Israeli government as part of the Israeli disengagement from Gaza.

It is a relative of Phoenix dactylifera, the true date palm. It is the natural symbol of the Canary Islands, together with the canary Serinus canaria. Mature P. canariensis are often used in ornamental landscaping and are collected and transplanted to their new planting location. A Canary Island date palm with of trunk is approximately 60 years of age. Description Phoenix canariensis is a large solitary palm, tall, occasionally growing to . The leaves are pinnate, long, with 80‚Äì100 leaflets on each side of the central rachis. The fruit is an oval, yellow to orange drupe long and in diameter and containing a single large seed; the fruit pulp is edible but not the best of dates. Names Common names in English include Canary Island date palm and pineapple palm. The common name in Spanish-speaking countries and in the Canary Islands is palmera canaria. Cultivation The approximate range of cultivation for Canary Island date palms in the US with little to no winter protection. The Canary Island date palm is typically cultivated in wet-winter or Mediterranean climates, but also in wet-summer or humid subtropical climates like eastern Australia and the southeastern United States. There are even several instances of cultivated Canary Island Date Palms in high-latitude oceanic climates, such as Ireland, the UK, and the Channel Islands. It can be cultivated where temperatures rarely fall below for extended periods, although it will require some protection if cold periods are longer than normal. It is a slowly growing tree, exclusively propagated by seed. The palm is easily recognized through its crown of leaves and trunk characteristics. It is not uncommon to see Canary Island date palms pruned and trimmed to enhance the appearance. When pruned, the bottom of the crown, also called the nut, appears to have a pineapple shape. The Canary Island date palm is susceptible to Fusarium wilt, a fungal disease commonly transmitted through contaminated seed, soil, and pruning tools. Spread of the disease can be reduced when pruning tools are disinfected before use on this palm. It has gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit. Other uses In the Canary Islands, the sap of this date palm is used to make palm syrup. La Gomera is where most of the sap is produced in the Canary Islands. Invasiveness In some areas, Phoenix canariensis has proven to be an invasive plant. In Bermuda and the United States (Florida and California) it is considered naturalised (lives wild in a region where it is not indigenous). It has also spread in some areas of peninsular Spain, Portugal, Italy, Australia, and New Zealand. It is listed as invasive in California. In Auckland, New Zealand, the palm has itself become a host for the naturalised Australian strangler fig, Ficus macrophylla.

He was the mayor of the city of Grand Rapids in the U.S. state of Michigan. He was sworn in on January 1, 2004, and exited his mayoral duties after ending his third term on January 16, 2016. Education Heartwell graduated from Albion College in 1971. He later earned a Master of Divinity (M.Div.) degree from Western Theological Seminary in Holland, Michigan, and was ordained as a minister in the Reformed Church in America and later the United Church of Christ. Career Prior to being mayor, Heartwell was a City Commissioner for the third ward of Grand Rapids from 1992-1999. Heartwell currently serves as President and CEO of Pilgrim Manor Retirement Community. He was Director of the Community Leadership Institute at Aquinas College, where he also was a professor in the Community Leadership undergraduate study program. Mayor Heartwell is an ordained minister for the United Church of Christ, and served for 14 years at Heartside Ministry, a program for the homeless in Grand Rapids. He was previously the president of Heartwell Mortgage Corporation. In August, 2007, Mayor Heartwell was re-elected to a second mayoral term in Grand Rapids. He won the primary election with 51% of the vote, eliminating the need for a general election run-off. He would be reelected for a third term in 2011. He was the first Grand Rapids mayor to be term-limited out of office; during his third term in office voters approved a revision of the city charter limiting all future Grand Rapids mayors to two four-year terms. These revisions prevented Heartwell from running for a fourth term.

The surface freezing effect is opposite to a far more common surface melting, or premelting. Surface Freezing was experimentally discovered in melts of alkanes and related chain molecules in the early 1990s independently by two groups. John Earnshaw and his group (Queen's University of Belfast) used light scattering, which did not allow a determination of the frozen layer's thickness, and whether or not it is laterally ordered. A group led by Ben Ocko (Brookhaven National Laboratory), Eric Sirota (Exxon) and Moshe Deutsch (Bar-Ilan University, Israel) discovered independently the same effect, using x-ray surface diffraction which allowed them to show that the frozen layer is a crystalline monolayer, with molecules oriented roughly along the surface normal, and ordered in an hexagonal lattice. A related effect, the existence of a smectic phase at the surface of a nematic liquid bulk was observed in liquid crystals by Jens Als-Nielsen (Ris√∏ National Laboratory, Denmark) and Peter Pershan (Harvard University) in the early 1980s. However, the surface layer there was neither ordered, nor confined to a single layer. Surface freezing has since been found in a wide range of chain molecules and at various interfaces: liquid-air, liquid-solid and liquid-liquid.

It is known from a single partial specimen that was found in Provence in 1992. The animal was named Pyroraptor olympius by Allain and Taquet in 2000.  Discovery and naming  Life restoration The first remains of Pyroraptor were discovered in southeastern France, at the La Boucharde locality of the Arc Basin in Provence. Finds of dromaeosaurid dinosaur remains are rare in Europe, and typically provide little taxonomic information. The first dromaeosaurid fossils found in France were those of Variraptor, although the bones were previously referred to a new Megalosaurus species.Allain, R., and Taquet, P. (2000). \\"A new genus of Dromaeosauridae (Dinosauria, Theropoda) from the Upper Cretaceous of France.\\" Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology, 20: 404-407. [June 27, 2000] Pyroraptor was described by French paleontologists Ronan Allain and Philippe Taquet in 2000, the type species is Pyroraptor olympius. The genus name is Greek for \\"Fire thief\\", due to its remains being discovered after a forest fire occurred. The species name is derived from Mont Olympe, a mountain in Provence at the foot of which the animal's remains were unearthed. The holotype specimen, MNHN BO001, consists of the second toe claw of the left foot. The assigned paratypes include the equivalent claw of the right foot; the left second metatarsal; another, more complete second toe claw; a right ulna (long forearm bone); and two teeth. Additional material from the Vit√≥ria Formation and the Tremp Group, both in Spain, was referred to Pyroraptor, including five pedal digits, one manual digit, a piece of a metacarpal, a right radius, a dorsal vertebra, and a tail vertebra. Description Estimated size compared to human Pyroraptor was a dromaeosaurid, a small, bird-like predatory theropod that possessed enlarged curved claws on the second toe of each foot. In Pyroraptor, these claws were 6.5 centimeters (2.5 in) long. As in other dromaeosaurids, these claws might have been used as weapons or as climbing aids.Manning, Phil L., Payne, David., Pennicott, John., Barrett, Paul M., Ennos, Roland A. (2005) \\"Dinosaur killer claws or climbing crampons?\\" Biology Letters (2006) 2; pg. 110-112 Its two known teeth are flattened and curved backwards, with their rear margins having finer serrations than at the front. As a dromaeosaurid, Pyroraptor likely had well-developed forelimbs with curved claws, and probably balanced the body with a long, thin tail. Pyroraptor was also likely covered in feathers, as many of its relatives, like Microraptor and Sinornithosaurus, also had plumage.Scott Sampson in Discovery Channel's 2003 documentary series Dinosaur Planet, ep. 2: \\"Pod's Travels\\".

She used her middle name for the signature on her comic strip, signed simply Edwina.  Biography  One of the earliest female syndicated cartoonists, Dumm was born in Upper Sandusky, Ohio, where her father, Frank Edwin Dumm, was an actor-playwright turned newspaperman. In 1911, she graduated from Central High School in Columbus, Ohio, and then took the Cleveland-based Landon School of Illustration and Cartooning correspondence course. Her name was later featured in Landon's advertisements. She drew editorial cartoons for the Columbus Daily Monitor from its first edition (August 7, 1915) until the paper folded (July 1917). In the Monitor, her Spot-Light Sketches was a full-page feature of editorial cartoons, and some of these promoted women's issues. Elisabeth Israels Perry, in the introduction to Alice Sheppard's Cartooning for Suffrage (1994), wrote that artists such as Blanche Ames Ames, Lou Rogers and Edwina Dumm produced: For the Monitor, Dumm also drew The Meanderings of Minnie, a semi-autobiographical strip about a tomboy and her dog. Moving to New York City, she continued her art studies at the Art Students League and created Cap Stubbs and Tippie, syndicated by the George Matthew Adams Service.\\"Edwina Dumm, Cartoonist, 96,\\" The New York Times, May 2, 1990. Dumm worked very fast; according to comics historian Martin Sheridan, she could pencil a daily strip in an hour.Sheridan, Martin. Comics and Their Creators: Life Stories of American Cartoonists. Hale, Cushman & Flint, 1942. Her love of dogs is evident in her strips as well as her illustrations for books and magazines, such as Sinbad, her weekly dog page which ran in both Life and the London Tatler. She illustrated Alexander Woollcott's Two Gentlemen and a Lady. For Sonnets from the Pekinese and Other Doggerel (Macmillan, 1936) by Burges Johnson (1877‚Äì1963), she illustrated \\"Losted\\" and other poems: :Losted :I feel so far from anywheres! :Perhaps my family :Has got so many other cares :They've all forgotten me. :I s'pose I'll starve to skin an' bone :If I stay losted here alone. :My little dog, he founded me, :An' wagged his tail an' whined, :But he can't lead me home, for he :Is taught to walk behind. :And so I'm crying yet, becuz :I'm just as losted as I was. From the 1930s into the 1960s, she drew another dog for the newspaper feature Alec the Great, in which she illustrated verses written by her brother, Robert Dennis Dumm. Their collaboration was published as a book in 1946. In the late 1940s, she drew the covers for sheet music by her roommate, Helen Slater, who did both music and lyrics. During the 1940s, she also contributed features to the Wonder Woman comic book. When the George Matthew Adams Service went out of business in 1965, Dumm's strip was picked up by The Washington Star Syndicate. Dumm continued to write and draw Tippie until her 1966 retirement (which brought the strip to an end).Jay, Alex. \\"Ink-Slinger Profiles by Alex Jay: Edwina Dumm,\\" Stripper's Guide (August 16, 2016): \\"American Newspaper Comics said Edwina‚Äôs Cap Stubbs and Tippie began in 1918 from the George Matthew Adams Service which syndicated the strip to May 29, 1965.

Over its twelve-year publication run it grew to be a 42-page, professionally printed magazine with international distribution and news-stand sales. Published out of Southboro, Massachusetts, Harvest served both the New England and international Neopagan communities. In an era before mainstream access to the Internet, and before the creation of the World Wide Web, Pagan magazines such as Harvest provided crucial opportunities for networking, sharing of information, and the development of the international Neopagan community. In an Utne Reader feature on Pagan publications, James Tedford wrote, In comparison to other Pagan publications of the time, Tedford continued, In addition to covering the more common traditions of Neopaganism, such as Wicca, Harvest also gave a forum to some of the emerging Polytheistic Reconstructionist movements.Lambert, Kym [K.L. n√≠ Dhoireann] (1992) \\"Celtic God/Goddess Names\\", Harvest, Southboro, MA, Vol. 12, No. 4, Spring Equinox 1992, pp. 11-12Lambert, Kym [K.L. n√≠ Dhoireann] (1992) \\"Religious Reconstruction Revisited\\", Harvest, Southboro, MA, Vol. 12, No. 7, Lughnasad 1992, pp. 12-13.

Remains attributed to Rebbachisaurus have been found in Morocco, Niger, Algeria and Tunisia, although only the Moroccan remains can be referred to the genus without doubt. The discovery of Rayososaurus, a South American sauropod nearly identical to Rebbachisaurus, supports the theory that there was still a land connection between Africa and South America during the Early Cretaceous, long after it was commonly thought the two continents had separated.Bonaparte, J.

He named the type species R. garasbae during the same year but only the shoulder blade and a single vertebra from the string of eleven were initially described, very briefly and without illustrations.Lavocat R (1954) \\"Sur les dinosauriens du Continental Intercalaire des Kem-Kem de la Daoura\\" (On the dinosaurs from the Continental Intercalaire of the Kem Kem of the Doura).

The fossils were left undescribed and neglected until 2015, when Jeffrey Wilson and Ronan Allain cleaned the holotype and described the remaining fossils that Lavocat never described in 1954. A second specimen, consisting of a partial vertebra measuring up to tall if complete (also found in Aoufous) has also been assigned to R. garasbae. A second species was named by de Lapparent in 1960, Rebbachisaurus tamesnensis. The type specimen, collected by Lapparent in the Gall locality, Irhazer Shale, supposedly composed of two humeri and two femora, and a second specimen composed of four isolated teeth, a dentary fragment with three teeth, over 100 vertebrae, six chevrons, 12 ribs, 5 scapulae, an ilium, two ischia, and numerous limb elements, but however, the material of this taxon was collected from multiple localities across the Sahara, such as several sites in the Elrhaz Formation of Niger, and is not referrable to Rebbachisaurus.de Lapparent A.

A 2015 cladistic study by Wilsona and the French palaeontologist Ronan Allain found Rebbachisaurus itself to group with the nigersaurines, and the authors suggested that Nigersaurinae was therefore a junior synonym of Rebbachisaurinae (since that name would have priority). Paleoecology The most common vertebrate remains which coexisted alongside R. garasbae in the Aoufous belong to the elasmobranch fish Onchopristis numidus. Another seven elasmobranchs are reported: Asteracanthus aegyptiacus, Distobatus nutiae, Tribodus sp., Lissodus sp., Haimirichia amonensis, Cretoxyrhinidae indet., and Marckgrafia lybica. Lungfish fossils are referred to Ceratodus humei and Neoceratodus africanus. Coelacanth remains are referred to Mawsonia lavocati and to the genus Axelrodichthys. Several taxa of Cladistia and two genera of seminiomorphs (an unnamed Lepidotes-like species and Oniichthys falipoui) are recovered in the Kem Kem beds. Teleosteans are represented by Cladocyclus pankowskii, Palaeonotopterus greenwoodi, Erfoudichthys rosae and Concavotectum moroccensis. Amphibians are also present: Kababisha sp., the pipid frog Oumtkoutia anae and non-pipids frogs. Turtles are represented by several species: Dirqadim schaefferi, the podocnemidids Hamadachelys escuilliei, the bothremydids Galianemys whitei and G. emringeri, and the araripemydids Araripemys sp. Crocodilians are commonly found; four species are present: Elosuchus cherifiensis, a genus belonged to the Trematochampsidae, Araripesuchus rattoides and Laganosuchus maghrebensis. Rebbachisaurus garasbae coexisted with many dinosaurs, including an ornithischian and an unnamed basal theropod, both only known from footprints. Among theropods, two carcharodontosaurids (Carcharodontosaurus saharicus and Sauroniops pachytholus), one spinosaurid (Spinosaurus aegyptiacus), one coelurosaur (Deltadromeus agilis), an unnamed abelisaur and an unnamed dromaeosaur also coexist with Rebbachisaurus. Pterosaurs are also present, although their fossils are extremely rare and enigmatic: an azhdarchid, an ornithocheirid, a tapejarid and a pteranodontid are known to have coexisted with Rebbachisaurus.Cavin et al., 2010  References  Category:Rebbachisaurids Category:Cenomanian life Category:Late Cretaceous dinosaurs of Africa Category:Cretaceous Morocco Category:Fossils of Morocco Category:Fossil taxa described in 1954 Category:Taxa named by Ren√© Lavocat ","title":"Rebbachisaurus"},{"id":"3553016","text":"Something Happens are an Irish pop-rock band whose heyday was the late 1980s and early 1990s. The band's lineup consists of Tom Dunne (Vocals), Ray Harman (Guitar), Alan Byrne (Bass) and Eamonn Ryan (Drums). An earlier incarnation of the band was called 'The Dazzmen' and was fronted by singer Martin Lynch who left the band and became the frontman for another early 1980s Dublin band 'The Cracker Factory'. After Lynch's departure the band recruited vocalist Tom Dunne and became 'Something Happens'. They shot to prominence with the single \\"Burn Clear\\" which was featured on the soundtrack of the 1988 Irish movie The Courier. __FORCETOC__ Career The Dublin-based band‚Äôs first release was the self-released \\"Two Chances\\" EP. After signing to Virgin Records they released a live EP, I Know Ray Harman, in 1988 which was recorded live at McGonagles. Their live show was energetic while the bands dress varied from Tom Dunne's trademark paisley shirts to Alan Byrne's neckties. Later that year, their debut album Been There, Seen That, Done That was released on Virgin Records. In August 1989 the band supported Simple Minds at their Dublin show and earned many new fans. Relentless touring in Ireland saw them build a strong local fanbase. One of the singles from their first album, \\"Forget Georgia,\\" was later covered by Canadian singer Emm Gryner on her 2005 album Songs of Love and Death. 'Burn Clear' another track was on the soundtrack of Irish film \\"The Courier\\" Their second album, 1990‚Äôs Stuck Together With God‚Äôs Glue was recorded in Los Angeles, and contains their best known songs, \\"Parachute\\" and \\"Hello, Hello, Hello, Hello, Hello (Petrol)\\". The album received critical acclaim, with Petrol included in the year-end top fifty singles list of rock magazine N.M.E. The band also received publicity in the music press and on television. Although they were a very popular band in Ireland, international success eluded them and they were dropped by Virgin. This led to T-shirts bearing the legend \\"Something Happens are no longer Virgins.\\" The year 1992 saw the release of Bedlam-A-Go-Go on Charisma Records. The record label folded, and their final album, 1994‚Äôs Planet Fabulous, was released on the Wild Bikini label. The following year, a greatest hits album The beatings will continue until morale improves was released. In 2004, this album was re- released with the title of The Best Of Something Happens. The Something Happens track, 'Momentary Thing' appeared on Veronica Mars: Original Television Soundtrack, released by Nettwerk Records. The band disbanded in the late 1990s. The Band Today Today, the band play occasional gigs, but they no longer record new material in the studio. The band always play at the famous Whelan's venue in Dublin twice a year, once at Christmas and a second time during the early Summer. They also make appearances at various other festivals around the country, such as their 2017 appearance at the Bulmers Live At Leopardstown Series, their 2016 appearance at the Skerries Soundwaves Festival, and their 2016 show as part of the Wexford Spiegeltent Festival. In December 2009, Something Happens supported Horslips as part of their comeback show at the 3Arena in Dublin. For these gigs, they sometimes wear t-shirts that say \\"Something Happens - Irish Tour (S.H.I.T)\\". The band have appeared on RT√â's The Late Late Show on a number of occasions in recent years, they performed their hit 'Parachute' on the show in March 2006, and again in April 2014 to celebrate their 30th anniversary. Lead singer Tom Dunne became a radio presenter. His first break was presenting \\"Totally Irish\\" on 98FM. He had a very successful radio show on Today FM (Pet Sounds). He has since moved to Newstalk, where he initially presented on a weekday morning slot. 'The Tom Dunne Show' currently airs on Newstalk from 9-11 pm on Sundays, and 10 pm to 12 am from Mondays to Thursdays. Guitarist Ray Harman works in television. Eamonn Ryan now works with concert promotions company MCD. Alan Byrne works as the director of The Late Late Show on RT√â 1 television.

It is similar in build to a very robust \\"hypsilophodont\\" (non-iguanodont ornithopod), though all modern phylogenetic analyses find this to be an unnatural grouping, and Rhabdodon to be a basal member of Iguanodontia. Discovery Wall mounted fossils of R. priscus on the silhouette of a Tenontosaurus Two species of Rhabdodon are known, Rhabdodon priscus, the type species, and R. septimanicus (Buffetaut and Le Loeuff, 1991). Rhabdodon remains are currently known from southern France, although fragmentary remains from eastern Spain have been assigned to the genus. Rhabdodon was large compared to its nearest relatives, and indeed one recent paper ( ≈êsi et al. (2012)) determined it is larger than the basal rhabdodontid status; from this they suggested that it actually experienced gigantism on the \\"mainland\\"; and not insular dwarfism as previous suggested. Paleobiology Life reconstruction of Rhabdodon priscus Rhabdodon was probably an important herbivore in Cretaceous Europe. Rhabdodon's predators include the abelisaur Arcovenator, and young may have been prey for Pyroraptor. Paleoecology Rhabdodon priscus is known from a specimen from the Marnes Rouges Inf√©rieures Formation. The material of Rhabdodon priscus includes a dentary and many other postcranial remains. More specifically, it is known from the Bellevue layer, which has produced many vertebrate fossils. Even though it produced many vertebrates, the formation only has a scarce record of plants and invertebrates. The non-dinosaurian vertebrates consist of Lepisosteus, an indeterminate turtle, and a crocodile. Dinosaurian fauna from the Marnes Rouges Inf√©rieures Formation include Ampelosaurus, an animal classified as Dromaeosauridae indet., and an indeterminate ankylosaur. The bird Gargantuavis philoinos, and dinosaur eggs have also been recovered. R. septimanicus fossil Another formation Rhabdodon priscus is known from is Gres de Saint-Chinian. Along with both Rhabdodon priscus, Rhabdodon septimanicus, dinosaur eggs, Nodosauridae indet. (previously known as Rhodanosaurus lugdunensis), Theropoda indet., Variraptor mechinorum, Avialae indet., Enantiornithes indet., and a possible Abelisauridae indet. are known from this formation. Rhabdodon priscus is one of few vertebrates known from the Gres de Labarre Formation. The only other fossils from the formation belong to Ampelosaurus atacis and a Nodosauridae indet. Villalba de la Sierra Formation Pelvis and vertebrae Rhabdodon sp. is from the latest Cretaceous aged Lo Hueco region in the Villalba de la Sierra Formation. A study shows that the area around Lo Hueco dates to the late Campanian and early Maastrichtian, although a more recent study revised the later date to the latest Maastrichtian. The study showed that Lo Hueco was near the coast of the Tethys Sea, a large seaway through southern Europe and northern Africa. The area directly on the coast was shown to be a brackish-freshwater aquatic environment, with a muddy flood-plain beside it. Lo Hueco was found to be inside the flood-plain. The flood plain was found to have distributary channels of sand and terrigenous material. Many dinosaurs have been found in the Villalba de la Sierra Formation, including Rhabdodon sp. They consist of possible Lirainosaurus remains, Ampelosaurus atacis, unknown basal euornithopods, probable ankylosaurians, one undetermined dromaeosaurine, and one unknown velociraptorine. The plants known from the formation are represented by carbonized branches and leaves. Invertebrates are solely known from bivalves and gastropods. Fishes from the formation include lepisosteids, and unidentified actinopterygians and teleosteans. Turtle fossils are very common, but only two different groups have been identified, the bothremydids Polysternon and Rosasia, along with an undetermined Pancryptodiran. Squamate lizards are known only from a few undetermined specimens, and eusuchian crocodiles are known from a specimen with similarities to Allodaposuchus and Musturzabalsuchus.
