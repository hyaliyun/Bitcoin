Originally developed by Stanley Hopper and David Leroy Miller in the 1960s and furthered significantly by Amos Wilder with his 1976 text, Theopoetic: Theology and the Religious Imagination. In recent times there has been a revitalized interest with new work being done by two schools of thought in theopoetics. One school of thought is led by individuals such as L. Callid Keefe-Perry, Rubem Alves, Catherine Keller, John Caputo, Peter Rollins, Scott Holland, Melanie May, Matt Guynn, Roland Faber, and others. The first school values process theology and postmodern philosophy. The other school of thought is led by individuals such as Anne M. Carpenter of St. Mary‚Äôs College, California, and Richard Viladesau of Fordham University, with contributions from Brian Nixon of Veritas International University. This school of theo-poetics is influenced by the thought of Hans Urs von Balthasar as informed by a range of thinkers as divergent as Gregory of Nyssa, Thomas Aquinas, Maximus the Confessor, Dietrich Richard Alfred von Hildebrand, David Bentely Hart and Pavel Florensky. This later school of theopoetics values the philosophical transcendentals as informed by classical theology.  Description  Postmodern Theopoetics The first school of theopoetics suggests that instead of trying to develop a \\"scientific\\" theory of God, as systematic theology attempts, theologians should instead try to find God through poetic articulations of their lived (\\"embodied\\") experiences. It asks theologians to accept reality as a legitimate source of divine revelation and suggests that both the divine and the real are mysterious ‚Äî that is, irreducible to literalist dogmas or scientific proofs. Theopoetics makes significant use of \\"radical\\" and \\"ontological\\" metaphor to create a more fluid and less stringent referent for the divine. One of the functions of theopoetics is to recalibrate theological perspectives, suggesting that theology can be more akin to poetry than physics. It belies the logical assertion of the principle of bivalence and stands in contrast to some rigid Biblical hermeneutics that suggest that each passage of scripture has only one, usually teleological, interpretation. The dismissal of the aesthetic as a living part of language has turned the academic enterprise of biblical studies and theology into a language more at home with lawyers than poets. Theopoetics is the art of using words and thoughts that speak to the reader in an aesthetic and existential way to inspire spirituality in the reader. Whereas those who utilize a strict, historical-grammatical approach believe scripture and theology possess inerrant factual meaning and pay attention to historicity, a theopoetic approach takes an allegorical position on faith statements that can be continuously reinterpreted. Theopoetics suggest that just as a poem can take on new meaning depending on the context in which the reader interprets it, texts and experiences of the Divine can and should take on new meaning depending on the changing situation of the individual. Classical Theopoetics In the second school of theopoetics, the aim is drawn ‚Äúfrom von Balthasar‚Äôs affirmation of poetic expression: when God speaks to us in the Incarnation, all qualities of human language‚Äîeven being itself‚Äîare employed as created ‚Äògrammar‚Äô by which God expresses himself to us‚Ä¶With God at the center of expression, poetry becomes capable of an authentic role in theological language.‚Äù This form of theo-poetics ‚Äúrequires the interplay of three massive fields of knowledge: metaphysics, language, and Christology‚Äù and is to be ‚Äúsharply distinguished from the agnostic overtures of the ‚Äòtheo-poetics‚Äô movement, whose lineage is not be found in the thought of Balthasar.‚Äù Notable publications = Books = * . * . * . * Carpenter, Anne (2015).

Discovered by Soviet astronomer Pelageya Shajn at Simeiz in 1928, it was the first asteroid discovery made by a woman. The L-type asteroid has a long rotation period of 82.5 hours, and was named for the country of Poland.  Discovery  Polonia was first observed as at the German Heidelberg Observatory in December 1908. It was officially discovered on 15 August 1928, by Soviet astronomer Pelageya Shajn at the Simeiz Observatory on the Crimean peninsula. On the following night at Simeis, it was independently discovered by her college Grigory Neujmin. The Minor Planet Center only recognized the first discoverer. Polonia was Shajn's first discovery; and the first asteroid discovery made by a woman, bringing a long-standing tradition ‚Äì which began with the discovery of 1 Ceres in 1801 ‚Äì of more than a thousand minor planet discoveries exclusively made by male astronomers, to an end.  Orbit and classification  Polonia is a core member of the Eos family (), the largest asteroid family of the outer main belt consisting of nearly 10,000 asteroids. It orbits the Sun at a distance of 2.7‚Äì3.3 AU once every 5 years and 3 months (1,916 days; semi-major axis of 3.02 AU). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.11 and an inclination of 9¬∞ with respect to the ecliptic. The body's observation arc begins with its official discovery observation at Simeiz in 1928.  Physical characteristics  In the Tholen classification, Polonia is a common, stony S-type asteroid. In the more refined SDSS-based taxonomy, it is characterized as an uncommon L-type, which is similar to a K-type, the overall spectral type of the Eoan asteroids. = Rotation period = In October 2007, a rotational lightcurve of Polonia was obtained from photometric observations by American astronomer Brian Warner at his Palmer Divide Observatory in Colorado. Lightcurve analysis gave a long rotation period of 82.5 hours with a brightness amplitude of 0.20 magnitude (). The asteroid's long period it is close to that of a slow rotator. = Diameter and albedo = According to the surveys carried out by the Infrared Astronomical Satellite IRAS, the Japanese Akari satellite and the NEOWISE mission of NASA's Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer, Polonia measures between 35.76 and 47.058 kilometers in diameter and its surface has an albedo between 0.0763 and 0.1319. The Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link adopts the results obtained by IRAS, that is, an albedo of 0.1319 and a diameter of 35.76 kilometers based on an absolute magnitude of 10.05.  Naming  This minor planet was named \\"Polonia\\", the Latin name for the European country of Poland. It is the first minor planet discovery made by a woman. The naming was proposed by L. Matkiewicz, an astronomer of Polish origin, who calculated the body's orbit. The official citation was mentioned in The Names of the Minor Planets by Paul Herget in 1955 ().

A fossil beach, also known as a paleo-beach, fossil strandline or raised beach, is an ancient oceanic or lacustrine beach preserved in fossil form due to a change in water level or sea level, or because of a shift in terrain elevation. It's often present as a sediment layer or terrace, with beach-related fossils and features, above the present shoreline.  Causes  Emerged shorelines relative to the sea level are created because of three main causes: tectonic movements that result in changes in terrain elevation, isostatic lifting and warping due to unloading of ice sheets and sea water masses during deglaciation, and eustatic drops of sea levels during glaciations. The effects produced by these three causes are often superposed, which complexifies the interpretation of ancient shorelines, and the evaluation of former sea levels during the Quaternary.  Location and research  In the United States, fossil beaches may be discovered where a limestone quarry or strip mining operation is present. For example, Miami has numerous fossil beaches which have been exposed by limestone mining. A famous example is the Pinecrest beds -- a fossil-bearing rock formation found in the south of the city which is a segment of a much larger geological formation -- the Tamiami Formation. The Isle of Portland, famous for Portland stone also has several examples around its coast. The search for fossil beaches worldwide is particularly important when scientists try to determine the position of former shorelines, which could help to understand how much sea levels could rise in a warmer world, specially in the context of global climate change.

He was imprisoned on felony charges of tax evasion in 1997. In 2001, Wired called Bell of the Internet's most famous essayists\\" and \\"the world's most notorious crypto- convict\\". In April 1995, Bell authored the first part of a 10-part essay called \\"Assassination Politics\\", which described an elaborate assassination market in which anonymous benefactors could securely order the killings of government officials or others who are violating citizens' rights. Following an investigation by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), Bell was arrested and subsequently jailed for 11 months on felony charges of harassment and using false Social Security numbers. After his April 2000 release, Bell publicly announced that he believed that there was extensive Federal Government corruption associated with his 1997‚Äì2000 criminal case, and that he was going to research the facts and file a lawsuit. Bell filed this lawsuit in 2003. Bell was put under heavy surveillance and rearrested for harassment and stalking of federal agents. He was charged with intimidation and stalking and was convicted and again imprisoned, this time for a decade-long sentence. Bell protested vociferously against the conduct of the trial, going so far as to file civil lawsuits against two judges, at least two prosecutors, his former probation officers, and his defense attorneys, but ultimately to no avail. He was released in December 2009, only to be rearrested in July 2010 for violating his parole conditions. Bell's parole violation hearing resulted in another sentence, and Bell was released on March 12, 2012.Release Date on BOP Site\\", 2012-04-30.  Background  Bell was born in Akron, Ohio and attended the Massachusetts Institute of Technology where he earned a degree in chemistry. After graduation, he worked for Intel as an electrical engineer before founding his own computer storage device company, SemiDisk SystemsKaplan, David E., \\"Terrorism's next wave\\", U.S. News Online, November 17, 1997 in 1982. When his company closed in 1992, Bell said he developed a \\"phobia\\" of financial and tax-related issues. He had been a Libertarian Party member and described his political beliefs as anarcho-libertarian. Bell attended three meetings of the Multnomah County Common Law Court (possessing no judicial authority according to Federal government laws) in Portland, Oregon, which put government officials on trial in absentia and awarded judgements against them.\\"Judge Delays Bell's Sentencing\\", The Columbian, 1997-11-21, Section ABranton, John. . The Columbian, 1997-05-20. Accessed 2008-01-14 Bell attended these meetings in order to find government 'plants' in that group. Bell subsequently became involved in a tax dispute with the Internal Revenue Service, which stated that he owed $30,000 to the federal government.  \\"Assassination Politics\\" essay  From 1995 through early 1996, Bell authored an essay entitled \\"Assassination Politics\\" in which he described the idea of using digital signatures through email to create an assassination market, \\"predicting\\" the deaths of government employees. Bell also speculated that some people could use these net-based markets quite openly without encryption (Part 10 of the essay). So there were two ways theorized to operate the scheme, one complex and secure and the other more open and potentially insecure. In effect, the arrangement would create an incentive for people to assassinate corrupt government officials, offering a reward that could be claimed by someone willing to submit an entry predicting a given person's death at a particular time. If that person died at about that time, the correct bettor would win the pool money. Bell published his idea in a 10-part essay titled \\"Assassination Politics\\" on the alt.anarchism USENET newsgroup. Described by Wired as \\"an unholy mix of encryption, anonymity, and digital cash to bring about the ultimate annihilation of all forms of government\\", the essay was nominated for a Chrysler Award for Innovation in Design in 1998 as \\"an imaginative and sophisticated perspective for improving governmental accountability\\". Although the U.S. Supreme Court has ruled that advocating violence against government officials is, in the absence of an \\"incitement to imminent lawless action\\", protected by the First Amendment,Brandenburg v. Ohio, 395 U.S. 444 (1969) (per curiam) (\\"... the constitutional guarantees of free speech and free press do not permit a State to forbid or proscribe advocacy of the use of force or of law violation except where such advocacy is directed to inciting or producing imminent lawless action and is likely to incite or produce such action. ... \\"), at . the publication of \\"Assassination Politics\\" put Bell under the scrutiny of federal investigators in 1995. The Cypherpunks list archives include many references to, what became known as ' AP' and ' APster ' from 1996 onwards. The names \\"assassination politics\\" and \\"Jim Bell\\" also cropped up in the US government's pursuit and prosecution of Carl Johnson (The CJ Files). In 2001, an Australian anarchist claimed to be acting on the 'Part 10' part of \\"Assassination Politics\\". This was covered by Declan McCullagh in Wired's story titled \\"Online Cincy Cop Threats Probed\\". Later, in 2003, The Denver Post published a similar story titled \\"Online threats target Denver investigators - Anarchist says e-mails harmless; feds disagree\\". This story was written by Jim Hughes. The essay attracted interest from theorists long before and after its author's legal entanglements; libertarian economist Bob Murphy criticised the assassination politics scheme in a pair of articles titled \\"The Politics of Destruction\\" in 2002. Murphy claimed that assassination politics was both technically infeasible and ideologically undesirable ‚Äì from an anarcho-capitalist perspective (crypto- anarchism being a form of anarcho-capitalismVernor Vinge, James Frankel. True Names: And the Opening of the Cyberspace Frontier (2001), Tor Books, p.44). Others, such as R. Sukumaran, argue that assassination markets as suggested by Bell are perhaps technically feasible, but because they are so revolutionary, they \\"threaten elites\\" and will be made illegal. However, Sukumaran argues that AP was revived within DARPA by Poindexter with FutureMAP, an attempt to \\"extrapolate the Iowa Presidential markets system to the prediction of terroristic events\\" under the \\"interest of national security.\\" Mike Huben has argued that were Assassination Politics ever to be accepted then governments would merely operate secretly (critiques of libertarianism). Almost all commentary so far has focused on the first nine parts of the essay and there is little on part 10.  Investigation, prosecution and imprisonment  According to testimony by a federal agent, the federal government began infiltrating the Multnomah County Common Law Court via Steven Walsh, a government agent who attended the meetings under a false name and who even began to lead the organization. According to court documents, Bell attended three meetings of the group nearly a year after Walsh's infiltration. In February 1997, the Internal Revenue Service acted on Bell's tax debt, docking his wages and seizing his automobile. Inside the car, investigators found bomb-making instructions, political literature and detailed information concerning cyanide and fertilizer. IRS officers raided Bell's home on April 1, 1997. He was arrested in May of that year,\\"Activist Bell Faces Sentencing Friday\\", The Columbian, 1997-11-20, Section B. and, in July, he pleaded guilty to charges of obstruction of IRS agents and the use of a false Social Security number (officials alleged that he had used four such numbers since 1984 in order to conceal his assets;Branton, John. . The Columbian, 1997-05-20. Accessed 2008-01-14 Bell said that he did not believe anyone had a right to know his real Social Security number). As part of his plea bargain, Bell pleaded guilty in July 1997 to collecting the names and home addresses of IRS employees, and the home addresses of FBI, Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms agents and police in Clark County, Washington; Bell also accepted responsibility for conducting a stinkbomb attack in the Vancouver IRS office. He was convicted of the two low-level feloniesPainter Jr., John. \\"IRS Says Man From Tacoma Part of Plot \\", The Oregonian, 1997-11-20, p. C02 and sentenced in December 1997 to eleven months in prison followed by three years of federal probation. As a condition of his sentence, Bell was compelled to pay, upon his release, $1,359 in restitution for the stinkbomb attack.Associated Press, \\"Bell gets 11 months in prison, 3 years supervised release, fine\\", The Oregonian, 1997-12-12. He was also subjected to three years of supervised release, during which he was barred from accessing computers and from possessing chemicals. In Bell's June 2003 lawsuit, Bell accused the federal government of extorting the 1997 plea agreement from him.(claims 87‚Äì103) Bell asserted that when he balked at that agreement in November 1997, in part due to the government's violation of the terms, government agents instructed fellow inmate Ryan Thomas Lund to assault Bell.(claims 105‚Äì114) The lawsuit alleged that Lund did this at about 6:00 P.M. on November 25, 1997, for the purpose of intimidating Bell, and to keep Bell away from his family and the news media. Later, in an ostensibly unrelated event, Lund filed a lawsuit stating that on December 14, 1997, two days after Bell's December 12, 1997 sentencing, Lund (who was in solitary confinement at the time due to his assault on Bell) had a \\"slip and fall\\" accident while alone in his cell, ostensibly due to a wet cell floor.(claim 108) Lund had also been promised a 27-month sentence for his illegal possession of firearms and methamphetamine, when the relevant federal law required a mandatory 10-year sentence.(claim 107) Bell alleged that the sentence reduction and lawsuit payoff were engineered to reward Lund for extorting Bell. Bell claimed that he was kept under \\"inhumane conditions for at least ten days\\". Bell further alleged in his 2003 lawsuit that a forged appeal case, number 99-30210, was entered into the court record. He stated that \\"Ninth Circuit Court personnel ... began corruptly falsifying, forging, and improperly adding to and deleting from the Ninth Circuit Court documentary record ... with regard to appeal #99-30210.\\" Bell's October 2004 amendment further alleges that, a handwritten note, \\"purportedly signed by Bell, but not in Bell's handwriting style\\", was forged to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. He alleges that this notice of appeal was filed around June 20, 1999 (claim 505), and that, \\"... Ninth Circuit personnel agreed to and did continually add false records to that docket, and at various times they deleted some of those false records and substituted new false records, for the purposes of concealing the true events and for continuing to obstruct Bell's access to justice and his constitutional rights.\\" (Claim 510) In his lawsuit, Bell seeks to establish that over a dozen government employees were guilty of numerous felonies.  Release and conviction  Bell served his prison sentence at a federal medium-security prison in Phoenix, Arizona, from which he was released in April 2000. He was rearrested in June of the same year on the charge of violating several of his 36 probation conditions, and was returned in November 2000 to a federal detention center at SeaTac, Washington following a search of his home that Bell called a \\"disguised burglary\\".Westfall, Bruce. \\"Federal Marshals Arrest James Bell\\", The Columbian.Bell, Jim. \\"Motion to Sanction and Recuse Various Officers of the Court including Atty's Leen and London and The Court, Judge Tanner. United States District Court for the State of Washington at Tacoma. Bell had conducted sousveillance against Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms agents, using public databases and legally obtained CD-ROMs, \\"to let them know that surveillance can be done in both directions.\\" Over a six-month period, Bell also compiled evidence of what he alleged was illegal surveillance of him by a government agency. In the days leading up to his arrest, he claimed that the agency had unlawfully installed a covert listening device in his home and a GPS tracking device in his car; during the subsequent trial, the ATF admitted to planting the device. Bell alleged in his 2003 lawsuit that the government employees had actually planted an illegal GPS tracking device in his car months before the one ostensibly allowed by the October 2000 warrant, at least as early as Bell's April 2000 release from prison. The information from that prior device could not be used, however, because there was no warrant allowing it to be planted. Bell also alleged(claim 123) that federal government employees had also illegally planted a GPS tracking transmitter in a vehicle he drove in June 1998, one which the government never disclosed. Bell further stated that his defense lawyers colluded to keep Bell from being able to demand disclosure of all such secretly planted devices. Bell pleaded not guilty to violating 18 U.S.C. section 2281, a law prohibiting the intimidation of family members of federal agents and some forms of stalking. The charges specified that Bell had performed Internet background checks on federal agents he asserted were harassing him, and Bell defended his actions by saying he was using public records to defend against what he saw as harassment by government officials. Journalist Declan McCullagh wrote, \\"[Bell] says, and a good number of observers agree, that the Feds are prosecuting him for doing what an investigative reporter does: Compiling information from publicly available databases, documenting what's happening, and so on. This case could set a precedent that affects the First Amendment privilege of journalists.\\" Declan McCullagh asserts that during the trial, the judge sealed the entire court file, forbade the defense from issuing subpoenas to witnesses, granted the prosecution significant latitude in making negative suggestions about Bell's character, and refused requests for a mistrial. McCullagh also asserts that he was subpoenaed by two Treasury Department agents to appear before the court, without being notified ahead of time as required by federal regulations regarding subpoenas involving the media. Following the conviction, Jim Bell renewed his attempts at firing his court-appointed lawyer, appealing his case to the Supreme Court, and filing civil lawsuits against those he alleges were involved in an orchestrated conspiracy to deny him a fair trial and an unbiased, court-appointed defense counsel; his targets included two judges, at least two prosecutors, and his former probation officers and defense attorneys.  Bell's Isotope-Modified Optical Fiber patent application  In February 2012, Bell applied for a patent on an invention which would improve fibre optic communication speeds and assist in transmitting long distances. Although yet to produce any fibre, Bell states his mathematical models show the velocity of light within the fiber can be improved from 68% to 98% of the speed of light with lower optical loss and dispersion which would allow light pulses to be transmitted for longer distances without being smeared together over time and distance.

Chebucto Head forms the most easterly point on the peninsula and is used to define the southwestern limit of Halifax Harbour; historically known to the Mi'kmaq Nation as \\"Jipugtug\\", (anglicised as \\"Chebucto\\") meaning \\"the biggest harbour\\", or simply, \\"the big harbour\\". A line drawn northeast from Chebucto Head to Pennant Point defines the southern geographic limit of the harbour. The actual legal limit of the harbour is located further inland to the north of this line. Lighthouse Chebucto Head lighthouse The first lighthouse at Chebucto Head was built in 1872 with a steam foghorn just below it. It was replaced by a second tower in 1928. This tower was demolished in 1940 and a new lighthouse and combined keeper's dwelling was built several hundred metres to the north to make way for a gun battery. In 1967 the light was moved from the house to the a new concrete tower which still stands today. The house remained the keeper's dwelling until the light was destaffed in the 1990s. The house fell prey to repeated vandalism after the Canadian Coast Guard cancelled the lease of the tenants who lived in and looked after the house. The plight of the lighthouse helped to inspire the Nova Scotia Lighthouse Preservation Society to push for the Heritage Lighthouse Protection Act, a campaign that was launched at the Chebucto Head lighthouse on March 11, 1999.Graeme Hamilton \\"Lighthouse Yard Sale Coming, Group Fears\\" National Post March 12, 1999 The house was destroyed by a suspicious fire on March 25, 2004. The Chebucto Head Lighthouse Society, a group formed to try to save the lighthouse continues to work to keep the site preserved and open to the public. Chebucto Head was used by the CCG as the control centre for the Vessel Traffic Service or VTS that controlled vessel movements in Halifax Harbour until the 1980s when a new control centre was opened at Shannon Hill, above the Bedford Institute of Oceanography in Dartmouth. It continues as a Remote Aids to Navigation Station. Chebucto Head inspired the name of the large harbour tug Point Chebucto, built in Halifax in 1992. Gun battery During World War II, Halifax Harbour was the primary fast convoy departure and arrival point in eastern North America. The Royal Canadian Artillery operated a searchlight and coastal gun battery at Chebucto Head as part of \\"Fortress Halifax\\" as a means of providing an integrated defense for the port. The Chebucto Head battery was the key outer battery of the western side of harbour defending it from possible attacks by German U-boats or surface raiders. The fortified battery was armed with three Elswick naval guns with associated searchlight, director tower, generators, a long-range optical rangefinder and by 1943 a radar artillery control unit. The battery was decommissioned in the early 1950s but many bunkers remain, now privately owned. The minesweeper was torpedoed and sunk off Chebucto Head by on 16 April 1945, becoming the last Royal Canadian Navy warship lost to enemy action in World War II.

Premise In the 1980s, the Western world constructed a large power plant named Titan under the Atlantic Ocean in order to extract geothermal energy from the Mid-Atlantic Ridge where the Earth's crust is thinnest. The power plant is operated and maintained solely by robots. Members of the Robot Liberation Front invade the power plant and seize control of the robots demanding equal rights for the machines, failing which they would use the power plant to trigger a massive earthquake which would severely threaten America, Europe and Africa. Titan is under the control of five separate computers - Zeus, Poseidon, Vulcan, Ares and Hermes and scientists have managed to regain control of Hermes and the robots it operates. It is up to these robots to regain control of the other four computers who are moving to regain control. Gameplay The action begins with the player in control with a randomly placed Hermes controlled robot. The AI is maneuvering its robots to take control of Hermes so it is up to the player to maneuver their robots and formulate a strategy to retake control of the wayward computers. The player does have one advantage - he can enter into the map mode which will pause the game allowing a brief respite from the action and a chance to view a detailed map of the Titan installation. As robots travel down roads, they may come to roads controlled by other computers where they will be attacked by fixed installations such as bunkers. Robots that have ion cannons can capture roads and junctions putting them under the control of Hermes. Once a computer is captured, all its remaining robots are passed to the control of Hermes. There are also quake suppression buildings to protect which if destroyed, bring forward the game's deadline.

It was discovered by Pelageya Shajn at the Simeiz Observatory in 1928, and named after Ekaterina Iosko, a staff member at the discovering observatory.  Discovery  Katja was discovered on 15 August 1928, by Soviet astronomer Pelageya Shajn at the Simeiz Observatory on the Crimean peninsula. Nine nights later, it was independently discovered by Max Wolf at the German Heidelberg Observatory on 24 August 1928. The Minor Planet Center only recognizes the first discoverer. The asteroid was first observed as at Heidelberg on February 1909.  Orbit and classification  Katja is a non-family asteroid of the main belt's background population. It orbits the Sun in the outer asteroid belt at a distance of 2.7‚Äì3.6 AU once every 5 years and 6 months (2,004 days; semi-major axis of 3.11 AU). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.14 and an inclination of 13¬∞ with respect to the ecliptic. The body's observation arc begins at Heidelberg, 10 days after its official discovery observation at Simeiz.  Physical characteristics  Although Katja is an assumed, carbonaceous C-type asteroid, it is rather of stony composition due to its high albedo. = Rotation period = Between 2002 and 2011, several rotational lightcurves of Katja were obtained from photometric observations by French amateur astronomers Maurice Audejean, Ren√© Roy and Laurent Brunetto (). Best rated lightcurve, however, was obtained at the Sunflower (), Blackberry () and Universidad de Monterrey () observatories in January 2002. Lightcurve analysis gave a well-defined synodic rotation period of 18.465 hours with a brightness amplitude of 0.17 magnitude (). = Diameter and albedo = According to the surveys carried out by the Infrared Astronomical Satellite IRAS, the Japanese Akari satellite and the NEOWISE mission of NASA's Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer, Katja measures between 38.20 and 51.949 kilometers in diameter and its surface has an albedo between 0.1144 and 0.211. The Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link derives an albedo of 0.2253 and a diameter of 38.65 kilometers based on an absolute magnitude of 9.3.  Naming  This minor planet was named for Ekaterina (\\"Katja\\") Iosko, a laboratory assistant and orbit calculator at the discovering Simeiz Observatory (). She was the daughter of Iosif Gavrilovich Iosko, who also worked as a mechanician at the observatory.

The Diocese of Ross was an ecclesiastical territory or diocese in the Highland region of Scotland during the Middle Ages and Early Modern period. The Diocese was led by the Bishop of Ross, and the cathedral was, latterly, at Fortrose. The bishops of the Early Church were located at Rosemarkie. The diocese had only one Archdeacon, the Archdeacon of Ross, first attested in 1223 with the appearance of Archdeacon Robert , who was consecrated bishop of Ross on 21 June 1249 x 20 June 1250. There is only one known Dean of Christianty (sic.) (rural dean), one Donald Reid called the dean of christianty of Dingwall on 12 June 1530. A dean of the cathedral chapter (Henry) is first recorded in 1212 x 1213; a Subdean (William de Balvin) in 1356. A Precentor, sometimes in Scotland called Chanter, (Adam de Darlington) is attested in 1255, a Succentor (Matthew) in 1255. A Chancellor (Maurice) is attested for the first time in 1212 x 1213, a Treasurer (William) in 1227. Following the Scottish Reformation of 1560, the Presbyterian Church of Scotland abolished the episcopacy in the diocese. The Roman Catholic Church continued to appoint bishops in communion with the Holy See. Bishop John Lesley, however, was a post-reformation bishop who remained catholic. Episcopacy was abolished in the Church of Scotland between 1638 and 1661, when it was restored under the \\"Restoration Episcopate\\". After the Glorious Revolution of 1688, Scottish bishoprics again came under threat until in 1689 Episcopacy was permanently abolished in the established church in Scotland. From the early 18th century, the Scottish Episcopal Church appointed bishops. In the twelfth century, the diocese is usually called \\"Rosemarkie\\", but thereafter it is called Ross. The diocese covered, roughly, the old county of Ross (also called Ross-shire).

Henry Melvill (14 September 1798 ‚Äì 9 February 1871) was a British priest in the Church of England, and principal of the East India Company College from 1844 to 1858. He afterwards served as Canon of St Paul's Cathedral.Men and Events of My Time in India by Sir Richard Temple, John Murray, London, 1882 p 18 accessed 9 Oct 2007 Early years Melvill was the fifth son of Philip Melvill (1762‚Äì1811), an officer in the army, who was lieutenant-governor of Pendennis Castle from 1797 till 1811, by his wife Elizabeth Carey (1770‚Äì1844), daughter of Peter Dobr√©e of Beauregard, Guernsey. He was born at the castle in 1798. His elder brother was Sir James Cosmo Melvill; Philip Melvill and Sir Peter Melvill were his younger brothers. He was born in Pendennis Castle, Cornwall, on 14 September 1798 and became a sizar of St. John's College, Cambridge, in October 1817. After migrating to Peterhouse, he passed as second wrangler and won the Smith's Prize in 1821, and was a fellow and tutor of his college from 1822 to 1832. He graduated B.A. 1821, M.A. 1824, and B.D. 1836. Life as a priest From 1829 to 1843 he served as incumbent of Camden Chapel, Camberwell, London; was appointed by the Duke of Wellington chaplain to the Tower of London in 1840. He was principal of the East India Company College, Haileybury, from 1844 until the college was closed in January 1858; Golden lecturer at St. Margaret's, Lothbury, 1850‚Äì1856; one of the chaplains to Queen Victoria, 13 June 1853; canon residentiary of St. Paul's, 21 April 1856; and rector of Barnes, Surrey, 1863‚Äì71. Melvill for many years had the reputation of being \\"the most popular preacher in London\\", and one of the greatest rhetoricians of his time. First at Camden Chapel, then at St. Margaret's, and later on at St. Paul's, large crowds of people attended his ministrations. His sermon generally occupied three-quarters of an hour, but such was the rapidity of his utterance that he spoke as much in that time as an ordinary preacher would have done in an hour. His delivery was earnest and animated without distinctive gesticulation; his voice was clear and flexible; while his emphatic pronunciation and his hurried manner of speaking impressed the hearers with a conviction of his sincerity. But his sermons lacked simplicity and directness of style, and his ornate phraseology, his happy analogies, smoothly balanced sentences, appealed more directly to the literary than to the spiritual sense. His views were evangelical. He died at the residentiary house, Amen Corner, London, 9 February 1871, and was buried in St. Paul's Cathedral on 15 February. He had married Margaret Alice, daughter of Peter Dobree of Beauregard, Guernsey. She died 18 April 1878, aged 73, leaving a daughter Edith, who married Clement Alexander Midleton.

Design and development The Mudry CAP 20 was developed at the same time as the CAP 10, as a single-seat aerobatic version. It was followed by a lightweight version designated the CAP 20L which in turn was replaced by the CAP 21 with more advanced wing. The CAP 20 was developed as a single-seat acrobatic version of the company's CAP 10; it was used by the French Air Force's flying demonstration team, Equipe de Voltige Aerienne. The CAP 20L is externally similar to the 20, but is a structurally new design. The wing planform is more angular; the dihedral is less (1.5 degrees); the fuselage cross-section is distinct, with a rounded top (the 20 used a triangular-shaped top deck). Its dimensions are slightly reduced, and the empty weight was considerably lower (the L stands for leger, or light). Production of the 20L was suspended in July 1979, when managers decided to improve its wing design. However, when the new wing was introduced, the overall design was tweaked to the point that a new designation (CAP 21) was used to designate the series. The CAP-21 was then developed as the CAP-230.

It was discovered by Alexandre Schaumasse at Nice Observatory in 1928, and named for the French region of Lorraine.  Discovery  Lorraine was discovered on 17 November 1928, by French astronomer Alexandre Schaumasse at the Nice Observatory in southeastern France. On the following night, it was independently discovered by Italian astronomer Luigi Volta at the Observatory of Turin, Italy. The Minor Planet Center recognizes only the first discoverer. The asteroid was first observed as at Heidelberg Observatory in October 1906.  Orbit and classification  Lorraine is a non-family asteroid from the main belt's background population (Nesvorny). Conversely, the asteroid is also considered a core member of the Eos family (Novakovic, Knezevic and Milani). It orbits the Sun in the outer asteroid belt at a distance of 2.9‚Äì3.3 AU once every 5 years and 5 months (1,989 days; semi-major axis of 3.10 AU). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.07 and an inclination of 11¬∞ with respect to the ecliptic. The body's observation arc begins at Nice Observatory in November 1928, one night after its official discovery observation.  Physical characteristics  In the SMASS classification, Lorraine is an Xc-subtype, transiting from the X-type to the C-type asteroids. = Rotation period = In January 2005, a rotational lightcurve of Lorraine was obtained from photometric observations by French amateur astronomer Laurent Bernasconi. Analysis of the fragmentary lightcurve gave a longer-than-average rotation period of 32 hours with a brightness amplitude of 0.16 magnitude (). As of 2018, no secure period has been obtained. = Diameter and albedo = According to the surveys carried out by the Infrared Astronomical Satellite IRAS, the Japanese Akari satellite and the NEOWISE mission of NASA's Wide- field Infrared Survey Explorer, Lorraine measures between 62.20 and 80.30 kilometers in diameter and its surface has an albedo between 0.03 and 0.0501. The Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link derives an albedo of 0.0457 and a diameter of 62.15 kilometers based on an absolute magnitude of 10.0.  Naming  This minor planet was named after the region of Lorraine, the former Duchy of Lorraine in north-eastern France, and a remnant of the medieval kingdom of Lotharingia ().

The Ballard Carnegie Library remained in use until 1963, when a newer and more modern facility replaced it. After its sale, the old library building housed a variety of private commercial enterprises, including an antique shop, a restaurant and a kilt manufacturer. In 1976 it was nominated for inclusion on the National Register of Historic Places by Seattle architect Larry E. Johnson, and formally added to the list in 1979.Larry E.

In 1901, the Women's Christian Temperance Union of Ballard began raising money with fairs and socials for a new reading room on Ballard Avenue, which was moved and expanded several times.Seattle.gov Department of Neighborhoods, \\"Summary for 2026 NW Market ST NW / Parcel ID 276700960 / Inv # BA003\\".

Having decided to build a proper library, the Ballard City Council established a library board in 1903 and applied to the philanthropist Andrew Carnegie for a grant to help underwrite the construction costs. The library was built on a lot of square, which was purchased for $2,100. The costs for the building were raised by local businesses and citizens, with support from the earlier fundraising and book collections of the women's union and a $15,000 grant from Carnegie.HistoryLink.org, \\"Ballard Branch, The Seattle Public Library.\\". Retrieved October 10, 2007. When construction was completed, the building included facilities such as a 500-seat auditorium and a men's smoking room (the latter of which was later converted into a reading room). Part of the construction work was done by a chain gang. Initially, the library had a cache of books provided by local residents and schools on standby for the completion and grand opening, as Carnegie's grant did not cover the initial costs of new books. An appeal was made to citizens to donate books and expand the collection. In 1907, the Seattle Public Library took control of the Carnegie library, when Ballard was annexed by the neighboring city. Early Scandinavian immigrants to the region made up a large proportion of the new facility's users (the Ballard area is noted for its significant historical presence of Scandinavian people). Early in the library's existence, it had a turnstile at the entrance to its book stacks, to count the number of book borrowers that passed through.The Library Journal, \\"The Library Journal\\", October, 1907, Page 466. Retrieved October 10, 2007. Following the start of World War I, the Carnegie Library became the location of various community activities, such as the distribution of information on the ongoing war. It also hosted Red Cross and English language classes. In 1942, during World War II, one of the first African American librarians in Seattle, Lucille Smith, was assigned to the library. In 1956, Seattle voters approved a municipal bond to replace what was by then considered the \\"inadequate and impractical\\" library.Kathy Mulady, Seattle P.I., \\"West Seattle Library closing -- but just until fall\\", December 31, 2002.

One of the cited reasons for the closure and sale of the library building was a number of expert claims that the building would not be able to withstand earthquakes (which have taken place in the Seattle area at numerous points in its history; the building has in fact survived several quakes in the meantime). Entrance to the library in 2007 From 2003 to 2010 the old library building was home to Carnegie's, a French restaurant.

He was decorated by Queen Mary I of Portugal for his services to Portuguese literature. Early life Adamson, son of Lieutenant Cuthbert Adamson, R. N., and his second wife Mary, was born on 13 September 1787 at his father's house in Gateshead. He was educated at Newcastle Grammar School, and in 1803 went to Lisbon, to work in the office of his elder brother Blythman, a merchant in the city. He left Portugal for England in 1807, when a French invasion threatened. While there, he had studied the language and collected a few books, including the tragedy of Dona Ignez de Castro, which he translated and printed in 1808. Return to England On his return to England Adamson was articled to Thomas Davidson, a Newcastle solicitor and clerk of the peace for Northumberland, to whom Adamson later dedicated his Memoirs of Camoens. In 1810 he printed a small collection of sonnets, mostly translations from minor works of Camoens. The next year he was appointed under-sheriff of Newcastle, a post he retained until the passing of the Municipal Corporation Act in 1835. He became a member of the Literary and Philosophical Society of Newcastle about this time, and was one of its secretaries from 1825 to his death. He was one of the founders of the Antiquarian Society of Newcastle in 1813, and was appointed secretary with the Rev. J. Hodgson. With several other enthusiasts he also founded the Typographical Society of Newcastle, which published most of his works. Portuguese literature In 1820 his two-volume Memoirs of Camoens was published by Longmans. It was well received, with Robert Southey in the Quarterly Review of April 1822 speaking warmly in its favour. The two volumes contain a biography of the poet, note on the \\"rimas\\" or smaller poems, a translation of an essay by Dom Joze Maria de Souza, an account of the translations and translators of the Lusiad, an account of the editions of Camoens, and notes on his commentators and apologists. In 1836 Adamson printed a catalogue of his Portuguese library entitled Bibliotheca Lusitana, in which the books are described with much bibliographical information. Except for volumes relating to Camoens and a few others, the library was destroyed by fire in 1849. In 1842, Adamson brought out the first part of a collection entitled Lusitania Illustrata consisting of translations from Portuguese sonnets, with notes on their writers. This was followed in 1846 by a second part devoted to ballads. For these, Adamson produced an English prose version, which was then turned into verse by Richard Charles Coxe, vicar of Newcastle upon Tyne. As a reward for his services to Portuguese literature, Mary I, Queen of Portugal, conferred the knighthoods of Christ and of the Tower and Sword on Adamson. He was a fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of London, and a member of many English and continental philosophical and antiquarian bodies. Other activities Adamson took an interest in coins and produced the catalogue of the Hexham Hoard after its discovery in 1833.Adamson, John (1844). \\"An Account of the Discovery, at Hexham, in Northumberland, of a Brass Vessel, containing a Number of Anglo-Saxon Coins, called Stycas. Reprinted from the Archaeologia, Vol. XXV\\". Archaeologia Aeliana. 3. He was also interested in shells, publishing in 1823, his Conchological Tables. His private collection, later sold, contained 3,000 different species. He also collected fossils and minerals; the former he presented to the museum at Newcastle and the latter to the University of Durham. Adamson was a close friend of Thomas Dibdin, the antiquary and bibliophile. Aside from his work as a solicitor, Adamson served as secretary of the Newcastle and Carlisle Railway Company. Death John Adamson died on 27 September 1855 and was buried at Jesmond Cemetery, near Newcastle.

Smith allegedly confessed to murdering the three- year-old daughter of a law enforcement officer who had allegedly beaten him during an arrest. Smith fled, but was recaptured after a nationwide manhunt. He was then returned to Paris, where he was turned over to a mob and burned at the stake. His lynching was covered by The New York Times and attracted national publicity. Background Henry Smith was a handyman in Paris, Texas. One day in early 1893, Smith was seen acting drunk and disorderly, and Deputy Henry Vance was sent to arrest him. Smith resisted and Vance \\"was forced to use his club\\" to subdue him. On Thursday, January 26, 1893, Henry Vance's three-year-old daughter disappeared from the front of the boarding house where her family lived. Witnesses said they saw Smith \\"picked up little Myrtle Vance ... and ... carry her through the central portion of the city. En route through the city he was asked by several persons what he was doing with the child.\\" One of the witnesses Smith spoke to was the mayor of Paris. Smith claimed he was taking her to her mother or to the doctor. Smith returned home Friday morning. His wife asked him about \\"that white child\\". He replied, \\"I ain't seen no white child, and don't have nothing to do with white folks.\\" Smith left and was not seen again until he was captured in Arkansas. =Search and discovery of Myrtle Vance's body= About 2:00 p.m. on Friday, January 27, 1893, a search party formed at the courthouse and found the child's body covered by leaves in Gibson's pasture. When the girl was found dead on the side of a road, the townspeople were furious. Rumor spread that the victim had suffered severe injuries from rape and physical mutilation. But an investigation by journalist Ida B. Wells revealed it was her opinion that the rape accusation to be false: > As a matter of fact, the child was not brutally assaulted as the world has > been told in excuse for the awful barbarism of that day. Persons who saw the > child after its death, have stated, under the most solemn pledge to truth, > that there was no evidence of such an assault as was published at that time, > only a slight abrasion and discoloration was noticeable and that mostly > about the neck. However, Doctors Chapman and Baldwin, who were the examiners of the three- year-old murdered child, stated the child died from the wounds it suffered from being \\"outraged,\\" a word used in place of rape during the time, and that the abrasions and wounds about the rest of her body weren't significant. The child's underclothes were found some feet away from the body, bloodied. \\"Report of Physicians Who Examined the Body of the Child. SWORN STATEMENT Of the Physicians Who Examined Myrtle Yance, the victim. On the 26th day of January 1893, by request of A. Cate, mayor of Paris, and J. C. Hunt, Justice of the Peace Precinct No. I, Lamar County, Texas, we examined the dead body of Myrtle Vance, aged about three years. We found the body in a state of semi- rigidity and we based our opinion on this fact that death had occurred not more than six or eight hours previous. The chest, abdomen and lower extremities were covered with blood, bruises, under the angle of each jaw, giving evidence of an effort at strangulation, abrasion in front of the left ear. Found complete laceration of perineum, extending an inch and a half up the rectum. The posterior part of the vagina ruptured, connecting abdominal cavity with vagina, parts terribly bruised and mutilated, unmistakable evidence of rape, hair from the mons-veneris of the negro being found on the pudendum of the baby, held by the clotted blood. J. B. CHAPMAN, M. D., City Health Officer. wo S. BALDWIX, M. D. \\" =Manhunt and capture= The search for the alleged murderer captured public imagination, and railroad companies offered free transportation to anyone involved in the manhunt. Smith was tracked east through Reno and Detroit, Texas. On January 31 he was captured near his hometown in Hempstead County, Arkansas, at the unincorporated flag station, Clow, Arkansas, 50 miles from the Texas border. Search party members from Paris immediately identified him. Initially denying any involvement in the murder, Smith finally confessed on the train to Paris. He said he was drunk and was motivated by revenge against the child's father. Smith said he spent the night sleeping in the pasture next to the dying child, killing her by suffocation when he awoke the next morning. =Return to Paris= The murder of Myrtle Vance was described by newspapers as the most atrocious killing in the history of Texas. Shortly after Smith's capture, local residents decided to take the law into their own hands, to make \\"the punishment fit the crime\\" and allow the victim's family to take part. When the train transporting Smith arrived at the stop at Texarkana, Arkansas, it was met by a mob estimated at 5,000. A committee from Paris urged \\"that the prisoner not be molested by the Texarkana people, but that the guard be allowed to deliver him\\" to the citizens of Paris. The mob agreed. When Smith realized what was awaiting him, he begged the policemen guarding him to shoot him instead of taking him to meet his fate at the hands of the mob. The city's mayor ordered all the bars closed on the night before Smith's arrival and disorderly crowds were broken up. Schools were closed the day of his arrival. They said that \\"it was not in the power of all the officers in Texas to save him ... they could not if they [wanted to] ... as they themselves were virtually prisoners in the hands of the committee from Paris.\\" Smith repeatedly asked his guards to shoot him and not turn him over to the mob. Smith's train arrived in Paris at 1 PM on February 1. \\"A committee demanded Smith of [City Marshall] Shanklin. He told them that he could not. They pointed to the great multitude of armed, angry men, and told him those men were there to take Smith at all hazards. Seeing resistance was useless and there would be a bloody riot, Shanklin submitted and went away.\\" Lynching A sketch of African American Henry Smith being burned by a mob at Paris, Texas from the front page of the Fort Worth Gazette the following day. A large crowd of from 5,000 to 15,000 people packed into an area of as little as , took Smith from his captors and placed him on a mule cart. They paraded him through town and to an open stretch of prairie between the cemetery and railroad tracks. There, organizers had built a 10-foot scaffold painted with the word \\"Justice\\". Smith was tied up and tortured for 50 minutes by Henry Vance, his 15-year-old son, and his brother-in-law. The men placed hot irons under Smith's feet, burned his trunk and limbs, burned both eyes out with hot irons and then shoved a hot iron down his throat. A February 2, 1893 article in the New York Sun reported, \\"Every groan from the fiend, every contortion of his body was cheered by the thickly packed crowd.\\" The February 2 edition of the Boston Daily Globe deemed Smith's grotesque execution \\"White Savagery\\" and claimed \\"Civilization Seemingly a Failure in Texas.\\" Finally, the crowd poured coal oil (kerosene) over Smith and set the scaffold on fire. According to some newspaper accounts, Smith remained alive during the burning. When the flames rose high enough, they burned the rope that bound Smith to the stake away and he fell off the scaffolding. At the base of the burning platform, Smith attempted to twist away from the flames, but onlookers kicked him back into the conflagration. After the fire reduced Smith's body to brittle cinder, members of the surrounding crowd moved in and sifted through the ashes to collect Smith's bones and shards of wood as souvenirs. On February 6, 1893, the governor of Texas, Jim Hogg, referred to the lynching of Henry Smith as a \\"terrible holocaust\\" and railed against mob violence in the state. On February 8, 1893, the bullet-riddled body of William Butler, Smith's stepson, was discovered hanging from a tree near a local creek. Aftermath =Governor James S. Hogg= Shortly before Smith's arrival in Paris, Texas Governor James S. Hogg in Austin sent separate wires to the County Attorney in Paris and to local law enforcement urging them to prevent a lynching. Sheriff D. S. Hammond of Lamar County wired the Governor back saying \\"I am helpless. Have no support.\\" Lamar County Assistant Country Attorney E. A. McCuistion responded, \\"Officers are helpless. An enraged public stands waiting for the prisoner, who is expected at 1 o'clock.\\" The Governor responded to the Sheriff Hammond, And to ACA McCuistion he wrote, Sheriff Hammond replied to the Governor, \\"Henry Smith has arrived and is in charge of from 5,000 to 10,000 enraged citizens. I am utterly helpless to protect him.\\" Shortly afterward, ACA McCuistion wired the Governor, \\"All is over: death by hot iron torture-diabolical affair.\\" Hogg issued the following orders to the offices of the County Attorney and law enforcement offices: The Paris Daily News argued that by the time Gov. Hogg started wiring officials (shortly before Smith's train was expected to arrive), it was not possible to prevent his lynching, even if they had wanted to do so. They opined that Gov. Hogg's orders were \\"looked upon as a joke. It is not believed that he means it. It is impossible to embody into a wired special to The News the various phases of public sentiment, all drifting in one direction.\\" But on February 6, Gov. Hogg sent an open letter to the Texas legislature urging them to stiffen the state laws against lynching. He wanted to allow the family of the victim to sue for damages, to make the local sheriff ineligible to run for re-election if a prisoner is taken from his custody and harmed, and to allow for changes of venue when there is a risk of mob violence. His letter concluded: = Facts in the Case tract= The Paris Daily News produced a tract entitled The Facts in the Case of the Horrible Murder of Little Myrtle Vance and the Fearful Expiation at Paris, Texas, February 1, 1893. The book was written by James Pleasant, uncle of the child, with the corroboration of his brother Henry Vance. The copyright of the tract was signed over to Henry Vance and the proceeds of its sale were intended for the Vance family. It included photographs related to the murder and the lynching, official communications between Gov. Hogg and local Lamar County officials, and editorial comments (pro and con) from various newspapers.  Bibliography  = Notes = = References =     * Further reading  Bills, E. R.

Discovered in 1928 by Italian astronomer Luigi Volta, it was assigned the provisional designation . The asteroid was probably named after the House of Savoy, the former rulers of Italy.  Discovery  Sabauda was discovered on 13 December 1928, by Italian astronomer Luigi Volta at the Observatory of Turin (Pino Torinese Observatory). Five nights later, it was independently discovered by Catalan astronomer Josep Comas i Sol√† at the Fabra Observatory in Barcelona, Spain. The asteroid was first identified as at Heidelberg Observatory in December 1906, and its observation arc begins at Heidelberg in January 1929, one month after its official discovery observation at Pino Torinese.  Orbit and classification  Sabauda is a member of the Meliboea family, a smaller asteroid family of carbonaceous outer-belt asteroids with a few hundred members, named after 137 Meliboea. It orbits the Sun in the outer main-belt at a distance of 2.6‚Äì3.6 AU once every 5 years and 6 months (1,998 days). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.17 and an inclination of 15¬∞ with respect to the ecliptic.  Physical characteristics  Sabauda is an assumed carbonaceous C-type asteroid, in line with the Meliboea family's overall spectral type. = Rotation period = Several rotational lightcurves of Sabauda were obtained from photometric observations. Lightcurve analysis gave a rotation period between 6.718 and 6.732 hours with a brightness amplitude of 0.16 to 0.27 magnitude (). = Diameter and albedo = According to the surveys carried out by the Infrared Astronomical Satellite IRAS, the Japanese Akari satellite and the NEOWISE mission of NASA's Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer, Sabauda measures between 67.24 and 75.91 kilometers in diameter and its surface has an albedo between 0.04 and 0.0711. The Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link derives an albedo of 0.0496 and a diameter of 68.53 kilometers based on an absolute magnitude of 9.7.  Naming  This minor planet bears the Latin name of the former rulers of Italy, the House of Savoy (Sabauda, or Sapauda). It is also possible that it was named after the new established town of Sabauda in the Pontine Marshes, central Italy. The official naming citation was mentioned in The Names of the Minor Planets by Paul Herget in 1955 ().

His lobbying in defense of the right to practice the Quaker religion was influential on the Act of Uniformity, the Bill of Rights of 1689 and the Royal Declaration of Indulgence. His writings are both biographical and ideological in nature, examining the Quaker way of life. Early life Whitehead was born at Sunbiggin, near Orton, Westmorland. He became convinced of Quaker principles by the time he reached the age of 14Ellwood, Thomas (1906). The History of the Life of Thomas Ellwood. London. Headly Brothers and in 1652, he left home at the age of 16 believing that Christ had commanded him to preach.Barbour, Hugh. Roberts, Arthur (ed).(1973). Early Quaker Writings. Wallingford. Pendle Hill Publications. After a year of preaching in southern England, Whitehead became known as one of the Valiant Sixty who traveled as Quaker preachers during a time of religious persecution. Whitehead, James Parnell and Edward Burrough were the only teenaged males counted among the sixty (Elizabeth Fletcher and perhaps Elizabeth Leavens were 16 years old when they left Kendal to preach).Hall V. Worthington: The Christian Progress of George Whitehead Ministry Whitehead was frequently jailed. The first of several incarcerations occurred in 1654. While he was visiting Peter's Church in Norwich, Whitehead addressed a gathering upon the conclusion the service and was subsequently jailed by the mayor for disseminating an unorthodox opinion about baptism. When Whitehead appeared in court, he was sent back to jail for failing to remove his hat in the presence of the judge. He was arrested again on 30 May 1655 after associating with a man who posted a religious text on the church door in Bures, Suffolk. He wrote: In 1656 Whitehead was released from prison because of pleas to Oliver Cromwell who interceded on his behalf. Whitehead was publicly whipped in Nayland and in Saffron Waldon he was placed in the stocks.Nigel Smith, \\"Whitehead, George (1637‚Äì1724)\\", Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004, accessed 14 Aug 2017. . Advocate of religious freedom By 1660 Whitehead had settled down, was staying out of jail, preaching less and working as a grocer in London to support his family. In 1661, he was persuaded to join a group of Friends appearing before the House of Commons to argue against the passing of the Act of Uniformity. The group was unsuccessful and the act became law the following year, resulting in the departure of nearly 2,000 clergymen from the English church. Whitehead remained in London throughout the difficult times that followed. In 1665, he was praying at the bedsides of dying Quakers as the plague claimed the lives of close to 100,000 throughout England. When the following year brought the Great Fire of London, Whitehead again remained in London to pray with victims. He was imprisoned again in 1668 after a meeting with several Friends that would serve as inspiration for his next mission where Whitehead led a group of Friends in obtaining for individuals persecuted for their religion a pardon directly from King Charles II known as the Royal Declaration of Indulgence. It called for the release of 490 persons from English jails, among them John Bunyan who would go on to be one of Whitehead's greatest public critics. This was one of several major steps towards freedom of religious worship in England. In 13 May 1670 he married Anne Downer who was much older than him. She was a notable advocate for Quakerism. In May 1685, accompanied by Alexander Parker and Gilbert Latey, he appealed to King James II to honor the agreement made with King Charles II, the King blaming Presbyterians in Parliament for voiding the declaration. Again a declaration was issued that pardoned more prisoners of religious persecution. His wife died in 1686. In 1689 led a group of men before King William III to plead for a continuation of pardons and rights for the religiously persecuted. The meeting was successful and would influence the king in the creation of the Bill of Rights of 1689. Of this meeting Whitehead said: George Whitehead died in 1723 and was laid to rest in the Quaker Burying Ground, Bunhill Fields, next to another of the Quaker movement founders, George Fox. Publications In 1716, George Whitehead edited a collected edition of James Nayler's writings entitled A Collection of Sundry Books, Epistles, and Papers Written by James Nayler, Some of Which Were Never Before Printed: with an Impartial Relation of the Most Remarkable Transactions Relating to His Life . However, Whitehead omitted Nayler's more controversial works and freely edited and changed the text. Note that this was after the death of George Fox, who opposed the re-issuing of any of Nayler's writings.Leo Damrosch.

Every student who registers at NUI Galway automatically becomes a member of the Students' Union on payment of the Student Levy. The Union is separated into two entities - the Students' Union Representative side and the Students' Union Commercial Services Ltd. As outlined in the Students' Union Constitution, the function of the Union is to \\"represent its members and promote, defend and vindicate the rights of its members at all levels of society\\".Constitution of the Students' Union The Students' Union sits on several University committees, including the University Governing Authority. The Union's objectives include providing social, recreational and commercial services for members through the College Bar, entertainment events, the SU Shop and other commercial services. The Union also part funds Sin Newspaper and Flirt FM. On a national level, the Union pursues \\"fair and equal access to education for all sectors of the Irish people\\", and liaises with the Union of Students in Ireland in this goal. Work of the Union has included the organising of a Grant Information Evening to help students apply for local authority grants.http://www.galwayindependent.com/local-news/local-news/grant- information-evening/ Executive Committee While the President, along with the staff, is mainly responsible for the day-to-day running of the Union, the Students' Union Executive is the committee that runs the Union on an ongoing basis. It consists of fifteen elected members, whose responsibilities cover different student concerns - from educational issues to accommodation and discrimination. Of the fifteen members of the Executive, three are paid sabbatical (full-time) Officers, i.e. the President and two Vice-Presidents, while the other twelve Officers work on a part-time, unpaid basis. Students elect their Students' Union Officers. The term of office is from 1 July to 30 June of the following year. To be eligible to run for election, candidates must be a full member of the Students' Union, i.e. a registered student or current Executive Officer, and receive 20 nominations. Candidates require three nominators who must be full members of the Union and Club Captains (where the position sought is Clubs' Captain) or Society Auditors (where the position is Societies' Chairperson.) History Though a Students' Representative Council was established in 1911, this council was short-lived. The re-establishment of the body was proposed by Conor O'Malley, auditor of the 1913-1914 session, in his inaugural address in November 1913. The council was firmly established by the mid-1920s, and in the 1960s was formally developed into the university's Students' Union, then known as Comhairle Teachta na Mac L√©inn. The non-existence of Society records from that period makes this contention impossible to prove.

History After the match, hundreds of fans were peacefully going back home. At the intersection on Szczeci≈Ñska Street, a group of 12 people decided to cross the street on red light. This was noticed by nearby policemen in a patrol vehicle, Dariusz Wo≈∫niak and Robert K. The group noticed the police vehicle and allegedly began to run away. Wo≈∫niak caught up to a member of the group, the 13-year-old Przemys≈Çaw Czaja and repeatedly hit his head and neck using his baton. This fact was witnessed by tens of people. Despite pleas, the policemen did not call an ambulance for the unconscious Czaja, who was lying on the sidewalk. At 8:20 p.m., the boy died, later it turned out that the death had been caused by hemorrhage. News about the incident spread quickly around the city and next day, on Sunday, January 11, a group of supporters of the two S≈Çupsk's sports clubs - Czarni and Gryf, gathered in the morning on Szczeci≈Ñska Street, to erect a cross there. At about midday the crowd moved to the vicinity of local prosecutor's office, demanding punishment of the responsible officer, who was being questioned inside the building. At about 4 p.m. the prosecutor issued a statement stating that the victim stumbled while running away, and hit his head against a trolley bus traction post, which caused the death. The same day, Wo≈∫niak was temporarily arrested, but then bailed by the local worker's union. First skirmishes started at 8 p.m. An angry crowd, chanting \\"blood for blood\\", and comparing the police's actions to those of Gestapo and Milicja Obywatelska, erected barricades in the center of the city and started to hurl rocks at police. The night of January 11‚Äì12 was very violent. Hundreds of rioters attacked police stations and destroyed 22 police vehicles. Police responded with tear gas. For the next three days S≈Çupsk was marred by violent fights, and as local police department was unable to tame the rioters, help was called from neighboring cities. Finally, on Wednesday, January 14, the situation was brought under control by some 1000 policemen patrolling the streets. According to the S≈Çupsk police, 239 adults were detained and 84 were taken into custody. The local magistrate court received 251 delinquency motions, and the juvenile court took up 32 cases. 72 police officers were injured, two of whom were hospitalized. In 2001 Dariusz W., the officer who killed the boy, was sentenced to 8 years in prison. However, he was released after 4 years due to poor health. Another officer, Robert K. who was sitting in a cruiser during the incident, was accused of failing to help the victim and sentenced to 8 months in prison. In September 2005 the Circuit Court in Gda≈Ñsk decided that the family of the victim would get compensation in the amount of 300 000 PLN (around $100 000), paid by the S≈Çupsk Police Department. The happening was the most notable case of police brutality in Poland after the fall of communism.

It is notable for enshrining the image of the Virgin of Montserrat. The monastery was founded in the 11th century and rebuilt between the 19th and 20th centuries, and still functions to this day, with over 70 monks.Official Web site There have always been roughly 80 monks in residence. Location Monestir de Montserrat and Roca de St. Jaume The monastery is northwest of Barcelona, and can be reached by road, train or cable car. The abbey's train station, operated by FGC, is the terminus of a rack railway connecting with Monistrol, and two funiculars, one connecting with Santa Cova (a shrine and chapel lower down the mountain) and the other connecting with the upper slopes of the mountain. At above the valley floor, Montserrat is the highest point of the Catalan lowlands, and stands central to the most populated part of Catalonia. Montserrat's highest point, Sant Jeroni, can be reached by footpaths leading from the monastery. From Sant Jeroni, almost all of Catalonia can be seen, and on a clear day the island of Mallorca is visible.  Description  L'Escolania inside the basilica Montserrat, whose name means 'serrated mountain', is ideally located to play an important role in the cultural and spiritual life of Catalonia. It is Catalonia's most important religious retreat and groups of young people from Barcelona and all over Catalonia make overnight hikes at least once in their lives to watch the sunrise from the heights of Montserrat. The Virgin of Montserrat is Catalonia's favourite saint, and is located in the sanctuary of the Mare de D√©u de Montserrat, next to the Benedictine monastery nestling in the towers and crags of the mountain. The Escolania, Montserrat‚Äôs Boys‚Äô Choir, is one of the oldest in Europe, and performs during religious ceremonies and communal prayers in the basilica. The basilica houses a museum with works of art by many prominent painters.

In 1881 the Pope Leo XIII granted it the status of minor basilica. The facade was realized in 1901, work of Francisco de Paula del Villar y Carmona in Plateresque Revival style, with sculptural reliefs of Venanci and Agapit Vallmitjana i Barbany. After the Spanish Civil War a new fa√ßade of the church was built (between 1942 and 1968), the work of Francesc Folguera i Grassi and decorated with sculptural reliefs of Joan Rebull (St. Benedict, Proclamation of the dogma of the Assumption of Mary by Pius XII and St. George, with a representation of the monks who died during the Spanish Civil War), as well as the inscription Urbs Jerusalem Beata Dicta Pacis Visio (\\"Blessed city of Jerusalem, called the vision of peace\\"). At the foot of the frieze with the relief of St. George is sculpted the phrase \\"Catalonia will be Christian or it will not be\\", attributed to the bishop Josep Torras i Bages, which has been assumed as a political motto of Catholic root. This facade precedes the church proper, which is accessed through an atrium. Here are the 16th century sepulchres of Juan de Arag√≥n y de Jonqueras, 2nd count of Ribagorza and Bernat II of Vilamar√≠. There are also several sculptures: St. John the Baptist and St. Joseph (1952), of Josep Clar√†, and St. Benedict (1962), by Dom√®nec Fita i Molat. There are also the paintings Visit of the Catholic Monarchs to Montserrat and Visit of Don John of Austria to Montserrat (1921) by Francesc Fornells-Pla. The square that precedes the church (called del Abat Argeric, built in 18th century) is decorated with sgraffitos (1956) of Josep Obiols i Palau and the friar Benet Mart√≠nez, which represent the history of Montserrat and the main basilicas of the world. The square also houses various sculptures: St. Anthony Mary Claret (1954), by Rafael Solanic; John I of Aragon (1956) and St. Gregory the Great (1957), by Frederic Mar√®s; and St. Pius X, by F. Bassas. On one side is the baptistery (1958), with a portal sculpted by Charles Collet, and inside a mosaic made by Santiago Padr√≥s (1918-1971) and a drawing of the Baptism of Jesus by Josep Vila-Arrufat.

At the head is the main altar, decorated with enamels (1928) of Montserrat Mainar, depicting various biblical scenes, such as The Last Supper, The Weddings of Cana and The Multiplication of Loaves and Fishes. The 15th century cross on the altar is the work of Lorenzo Ghiberti. On the altar there is a shrine of octagonal form. In the chancel there are various paintings by Alexandre de Riquer, Joan Llimona, Joaquim Vancells, Dion√≠s Baixeras and Llu√≠s Graner. Just above the main altar is located the room of the Virgin that is accessed after crossing a portal of alabaster (Porta Ang√®lica) in which are represented various biblical scenes, work of Enric Monjo (1954). The mosaics on the walls represent the Saints Mothers (left) and the Saints V√≠rgins (right), the work of the friar Benet Mart√≠nez. Next comes the Throne Room (1944-1954), the work of Francesc Folguera, decorated with paintings by Josep Obiols (Judit who Cuts Off Holofernes's Head, Esther's Wedding with the Persian King Asuero) and Carlo Maratta (Birth of Jesus). The Fountain of the Virgin is also found here, with reliefs of Charles Collet representing the miracles of Jesus. The Throne of the Virgin is embossed silver, work of the goldsmith Ramon Sunyer, with two reliefs made by Alfons Serrahima and designed by Joaquim Ros i Bofarull that represent the Nativity and the Visitation, and an image of St. Michael by Josep Granyer. Here is a 12th century statue of the Virgin on which are placed some angels that hold the crown, the scepter and the lily of the Virgin, the work of Mart√≠ Llaurad√≥, covered by a baldachin. The Sala del Cambril is a circular chapel with three apses, built between 1876 and 1884 by Villar i Carmona with the collaboration of his assistant, a young Antoni Gaud√≠. The vault is decorated by Joan Llimona (The Virgin Welcomes the Romeros) and the figures of angels and the sculpture of St. George are of Agapit Vallmitjana. The windows are of Antoni Rigalt i Blanch. The exit of the room is carried out by the Cam√≠ de l'Ave Maria, where it is customary to make offerings in the form of candles. Here stands out a statue of the Angel of the Annunciation by Apel¬∑les Fenosa, as well as a maiolica ceramic depicting the Virgin, the work of Joan Guivernau.

The basilica was restored between 1991 and 1995 by Arcadi Pla i Masmiquel. In 2015 Sean Scully restyled Santa Cecilia Chapel which is next to the abbey.  Pipe organ  The pipe organ of the church of Montserrat dates from 1896 and was moved to the presbytery in 1957. This pipe organ is very deteriorated. A new pipe organ was inaugurated in 2010 and follows the design of the Catalan pipe organs that are located next to the Church. It is an important work of Catalan musical craftsmanship that places Montserrat at an international musical level. This pipe organ is designed by Albert Blancafort, built by Blancafort, orgueners de Montserrat, and financed by popular subscription and the social work of the Caixa de Penedes. The pipe organ is located on the side of the nave, as is traditional in Catalonia, offering a very good sound throughout the temple. = Cloister = The cloister of the monastery is the work of the architect Josep Puig i Cadafalch (1929). It is two floors, supported by stone columns. The lower floor communicates with the garden and has a fountain in its central area. On the walls of the cloister, the visitor can see old pieces, some of 10th century. The extensive garden includes the Chapel of Sant Iscle and Santa Vict√≤ria, Romanesque, access to the buildings of the novitiate and the choir and several sculptures, such as the marble of the \\"Good Shepherd\\" of Manolo Hugu√© or some of the sculptures that Josep de San Benet made in the 18th century for the bell tower of the monastery and that were never installed. = Refectory = The refectory is from the 17th century and it was rebuilt in 1925 by Puig i Cadafalch. The central part has a mosaic that represents Christ, while in the opposite area the visitor can see a triptych with scenes from the life of St. Benedict. = Museum = The monastery has an important museum divided into three different sections: * Modern painting, with works by artists from Catalonia such as Santiago Rusi√±ol, Ramon Casas, Isidre Nonell, Joaquim Mir, Salvador Dal√≠, Joan Mir√≥ and Antoni T√†pies, and non-Catalans like Pablo Picasso or the painter Dar√≠o de Regoyos, Asturian, who was the only painter linked to the European impressionist and neo-impressionist movements; as well as a representation of French impressionism, with authors such as Pierre-Auguste Renoir, Claude Monet, Alfred Sisley and Edgar Degas. * Archeology of the biblical East, showing objects of Egypt, Cyprus, Mesopotamia and Holy Land. * Ancient painting, showing works by authors such as El Greco, Caravaggio (from this author, an important St. Jerome), Luca Giordano, Giambattista Tiepolo and Pedro Berruguete. Other collections include Montserrat iconography and religious goldsmithing.  History  The legend places the finding of the statue of the Virgin of Montserrat around 880. Then began the cult of the Moreneta virgin, which materialized in four earlier hermitages in the 9th century: Santa Maria, Sant Iscle, Sant Pere and Sant Mart√≠. However, the origin of the monastery is uncertain. It is known that around 1011 a monk from the monastery of Santa Maria de Ripoll came to the mountain to take charge of the monastery of Santa Cec√≠lia de Montserrat, thus leaving the monastery under the orders of Abbot Oliba of Ripoll. Santa Cec√≠lia did not accept this new situation, so Oliba decided to found the monastery of Santa Maria in the place where there was an old hermitage of the same name (1025). As of 1082, Santa Maria became an abbot of her own and ceased to depend on the abbot of Ripoll. This hermitage had become the most important of all those that existed in the mountain thanks to the statue of the Virgin that was venerated in it since 880. In 1811 and in 1812, the abbey was twice burned down and sacked by Napoleon's troops, and many of its treasures were lost. In 1835, the abbey was closed until restoration in 1844. In 1880, Montserrat celebrated 1000 years of existence. On 11 September 1881, to coincide with the Catalan national day Pope Leo XIII proclaimed the Virgin of Montserrat patron of Catalonia. ;Spanish Civil War The abbey as seen from the Funicular de Sant Joan The Spanish Civil War saw the violent suppression of the Abbey of Montserrat. Of the 278 priests and 583 religious men and women killed in Catalonia by Republican forces,Archdiocese of Barcelona website 22 were monks of the Abbey of Montserrat. The Spanish Republican authorities and the authorities of the Generalitat de Catalunya, such as Llu√≠s Companys, Ventura Gassol and Joan Casanovas, tried to stop anticlerical violence and helped many priests and religious people to hide and leave the country.Preston, Paul. The Spanish Holocaust, London, Harper Press, 2012. ;Francoist era During the rule of Francisco Franco, Santa Maria de Montserrat was seen as a sanctuary for scholars, artists, politicians and students. Franco's men were often waiting for wanted people a few miles down the road. From the 1940s onward, Santa Maria de Montserrat Abbey was often seen as a symbol of Catalan nationalism.Conversi, Daniele. The Basques, the Catalans, and Spain: Alternative Routes to Nationalist Mobilisation University of Nevada Press, 2000 , (p 126-127). On 27 April 1947, a Mass was held to celebrate the Enthronement of the Virgin of Montserrat, and attended by over 100,000 people. At the Mass, prayers were publicly said in the Catalan language, defying the government's language policies. During a visit to Spain in 1940, Heinrich Himmler, the head of the Schutzstaffel, took the opportunity to visit the monastery of Santa Maria de Montserrat. Amid other activities, the Abbey of Montserrat played a remarkable part in continuing to publish in Catalan. They created and promoted, among others, some children's publications (L'Infantil, Tretzevents) and some cultural and religious journals (Serra d'Or, Q√ºestions de vida cristiana). In 1958, tile Abbey founded the Estela Press to promote religious books in Catalan (Masot i Muntaner, 1986). In 1971 the PAM Press (Publications of the Montserrat's Abbey) became official (Faul√≠, 1999, pp. 35‚Äì9). The Abbey was also active in providing shelter to intellectuals and clandestine political activists from a wide political spectrum.Guibernau, Montserrat. NATIONALISM AND INTELLECTUALS IN NATIONS WITHOUT STATES: THE CATALAN CASE, Political Studies. Dec2000, Vol. 48 Issue 5, p989. 17p. In December 1970, 300 Spanish artists and academics held a sit-in at the Abbey to protest against the death sentences meted out to 16 Basque ETA terrorists in Burgos. In response, the police sealed off the monastery.\\"Basque Trial Protesters Sealed Off\\", Associated Press, in Press-Courier, Dec 14, 1970, (pg. 9).Mcneill, Donald, Urban change and the European left: tales from the new Barcelona, Routledge, 1999. , (p. 142).

Obesogens are foreign chemical compounds that disrupt normal development and balance of lipid metabolism, which in some cases, can lead to obesity. Obesogens may be functionally defined as chemicals that inappropriately alter lipid homeostasis and fat storage, change metabolic setpoints, disrupt energy balance or modify the regulation of appetite and satiety to promote fat accumulation and obesity. There are many different proposed mechanisms through which obesogens can interfere with the body's adipose tissue biology. These mechanisms include alterations in the action of metabolic sensors; dysregulation of sex steroid synthesis, action or breakdown; changes in the central integration of energy balance including the regulation of appetite and satiety; and reprogramming of metabolic setpoints. Some of these proposed pathways include inappropriate modulation of nuclear receptor function which therefore allows the compounds to be classified as endocrine disrupting chemicals that act to mimic hormones in the body, altering the normal homeostasis maintained by the endocrine system. Obesogens have been detected in the body both as a result of intentional administration of obesogenic chemicals in the form of pharmaceutical drugs such as diethylstilbestrol, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, and thiazolidinedione and as a result of unintentional exposure to environmental obesogens such as tributyltin, bisphenol A, diethylhexylphthalate, and perfluorooctanoate. The term obesogen was coined in 2006 by Felix Gr√ºn and Bruce Blumberg of the University of California, Irvine. The topic of this proposed class of chemical compounds and how to counteract their effects is explored at length in the book The New American Diet. Paula Baillie-Hamilton,Down To Earth: The new obesity a naturopath in the UK, hypothesized that obesogens make it difficult to lose weight in the Journal of Alternative and Complementary Medicine in 2002.http://www.ibarguchi.ca/teaching-CHEO/Baillie-Hamilton- Chems%20and%20obesity.pdf Chemical Toxins: A Hypothesis to Explain the Global Obesity Epidemic.  Mechanisms of action  There are many ways in which obesogenic drugs and chemicals can disrupt the body's adipose tissue biology. The three main mechanisms of action include * alterations in the action of metabolic sensors in which obesogens mimic metabolic ligands acting to either block or upregulate hormone receptors * dysregulation of sex steroid synthesis, in which they alter the ratio of sex hormones leading to changes in their control of lipid balance * changes in the central integration of energy balance including the regulation of appetite and satiety in the brain and the reprogramming of metabolic setpoints. = Metabolic sensors = Obesogenic drugs and chemicals have been shown to target transcription regulators found in gene networks that function to control intracellular lipid homeostasis and proliferation and differentiation on adipocytes. The major group of regulators that is targeted is a group of nuclear hormone receptors known as peroxisome proliferator activated receptors (PPARŒ±, Œ¥, and Œ≥). These hormone receptors sense a variety of metabolic ligands including lipophilic hormones, dietary fatty acids and their metabolites, and, depending on the varying levels of these ligands, control transcription of genes involved in balancing the changes in lipid balance in the body. To become active and properly function as metabolic sensors and transcription regulators, the PPAR receptors must heterodimerize with another receptor known as the 9-cis retinoic acid receptor (RXR). The RXR receptor itself is the second major target of obesogens next to the PPAR receptors. The PPARŒ± receptor, when complexed with RXR and activated by the binding of a lipid, promotes peroxisome proliferation leading to increased fatty acid Œ≤-oxidation. Substances, such a xenobiotics that target and act as agonists of PPARŒ±, typically act to reduce overall serum concentrations of lipids. In contrast, the PPARŒ≥ receptor, when complexed with RXR and activated by the binding of fatty acids or their derivatives, promotes lipid biosynthesis and storage of lipids is favored over fatty acid oxidation. In addition, activation promotes differentiation of preadipocytes and the conversion of mesenchymal progenitor cells to preadipocytes in adipose tissues. Substances that target and act as agonists of PPARŒ≥/RXR complex typically act to increase overall serum concentrations of lipids. Obesogens that target the PPARŒ≥/RXR complex mimic the metabolic ligands and activate the receptor leading to upregulation of lipid accumulation which explains their obesogenic effects. However, in the case of obesogens that target the PPARŒ±/RXR complex, which when stimulated reduces adipose mass and body weight, there are a few explanations as to how they promote obesity. The ligand binding pockets of PPARs are very large and unspecified, allowing for different isoforms of the receptor (PPARŒ±, Œ¥, and Œ≥) to be activated by the same agonist ligands or their metabolites. In addition, fatty acid oxidation stimulated by PPARŒ± requires continuous stimulation while only a single activation event of PPARŒ≥ is required to permanently increase adipocyte differentiation and number. Therefore, it may be the case that metabolites of PPARŒ± targeting obesogens are also activating PPARŒ≥, providing the single activation event needed to potentially lead to a pro-adipogenic response. A second explanation points to specific PPARŒ± targeters that have been shown to additionally cause abnormal transcriptional regulation of testicular steroidogenesis when introduced during fetal development. This abnormal regulation leads to a decreased level of androgen in the body which, itself, is obesogenic. Finally, if PPARŒ± activation occurs during critical periods of development, the resulting decrease in lipid concentration in the developing fetus is recognized by the fetal brain as undernourishment. In this case, the developing brain makes what will become permanent changes to the body's metabolic control, leading to long-term upregulation of lipid storage and maintenance. = Sex steroid dysregulation = Sex steroids normally play a significant role in lipid balance in the body. Aided by other peptide hormones such as growth hormone, they act against the lipid accumulation mediated by insulin and cortisol by mobilizing lipid stores that are present. Exposure to obesogens often leads to a deficiency or change in the ratio between androgen and estrogen sex steroid levels, which modifies this method of lipid balance resulting in lowered growth hormone secretion, hypocortisolemia (low levels of circulating cortisol), and increased resistance to insulin effects. This alteration in sex steroid levels due to obesogens can vary enormously according to both the sex of the exposed individual as well as the timing of the exposure. If the chemicals are introduced at critical windows of development, the vulnerability of an individual to their effects is much higher than if exposure occurs later in adulthood. It has been shown that obesogenic effects are apparent in female mice exposed to both phytoestrogens and DES during their neonatal periods of development, as they, though born with a lower birth weight, almost always developed obesity, high leptin levels, and altered glucose response pathways. Both phytoestrogen and DES exposed male mice did not develop obesity and, rather, showed decreased body weights with increased exposure confirming the role of gender differences in exposure response. Further studies have shown positive correlations for serum BPA levels with obese females in the human population, along with other xenoestrogen compounds suggesting the parallel roles that these effects may be having on humans. = Central balance of energy = While hormone receptors tend to be the most obvious candidates for targets of obesogens, central mechanisms that balance and regulate the body's nutritional changes on a day- to-day basis as a whole cannot be overlooked. The HPA axis (hypothalamic- pituitary-adrenal) is involved in controlling appetite and energy homeostasis circuits which are mediated by a large number of monoaminoergic, peptidergic (use of hormones as neurotransmitters), and endocannabinoid signals that come from the digestive tract, adipose tissues, and from within the brain. It is these types of signals that provide a likely target for obesogens that have shown to have weight altering effects:  Neuroendocrine effects  Neurological disorders may enhance the susceptibility to develop the metabolic syndrome that includes obesity. Many neuropharmaceuticals used to alter behavioral pathways in patients with neurological disorders have shown to have metabolic altering side-effects leading to obesogenic phenotypes as well. These findings give evidence to conclude that an increase in lipid accumulation can result from the targeting of neurotransmitter receptors by foreign chemicals. (See also: section \\"Central integration of energy balance\\".)  Peptidergic hormones  Several peptidergic hormone pathways controlling appetite and energy balance ‚Äîsuch as those involving ghrelin, neuropeptide Y, and agouti-related peptide ‚Äî are particularly sensitive to changes in nuclear receptor signaling pathways and can therefore be easily altered by the introduction of endocrine disruptors. Such an alteration can lead to induced feelings of hunger and decreased feelings of fullness causing an increase in food intake and inability to feel satisfied, both characteristic of obesity. Some xenoestrogens such as BPA, nonylphenol, and DEHP have all shown to act is this way, altering NPY expression and significantly shifting the feeding behaviors of exposed mice. In addition, organotins such as trimethyltin (TMT) triethyltin (TET), and tributyltin (TBT) compounds can exert their effects through similar pathways. TBT can locally disrupt aromatase regulation in the hypothalamus causing the responses of the HPA axis to hormones to become abnormal. TMT works in a similar but unique way, inducing NPY and NPY2 receptor expression initially which later is counteracted by neuronal degeneration in lesions causing decrease in signaling ability. While an increase in food intake is often the case after exposure, weight gain involves the body's maintenance of its metabolic setpoint as well. Given this information, it is particularly important to note that exposure during development and initial programming of these setpoints can be extremely significant throughout the remainder of life.  Endocannabinoid signaling  A wide range of environmental organotins that mimic petidergic hormones in the HPA axis as mentioned before, additionally mimic lipid activators of the cannabinoid system and inhibit AMPK activity. Endocannaboid levels are high in those suffering from obesity due to hyperactivity of cannaboid signalling pathways. It is these high levels that have been found to be closely associated with increased fat stores linking the lipid activator mimics to the actual disease.  Programming of metabolic set points  Regions in the hypothalamus control the responses that establish an individuals metabolic setpoint and metabolic efficiency. These responses are adaptive in that they vary according to the individual's needs, always working to restore the metabolic setpoint through the increase or decrease of metabolic functions depending on varying energy needs. Since it is adapted, it is expected that it would be able to achieve equilibrium if the lipid balance was altered by hormones via the mechanisms mentioned above. However, since obesogenic phenotypes persist, it can be concluded that adaptive response components of the hypothalamus may be a target of obesogens as well. A person's body composition is very much predetermined before birth and changes rarely occur in adulthood. Adipocyte numbers increase during development and come to a plateau over time. After the plateau adipocytes become restricted to mostly hypertrophic growth and don't seem to change much in terms of cell number. This is demonstrated by the difficulty in altering somatotypes or more simply by the difficulty that goes along with trying to lose weight past a certain point. A particular study on PBDEs, a commonly used chemical in flame retardants, made its role in altering the functions of the thyroid hormone axis apparent. This finding leads to increased concern as neonatal thyroid status plays a large role in the integration of maternal environmental signals during development in the womb that is used for long-term body weight programming.  Pharmaceutical obesogens  Obesogens detection in the body and resulting obesogenic effects can result as side effects from intentional administration of obesogenic chemicals in the form of pharmaceutical drugs. These pharmaceutical obesogens can show their effects through a variety of targets. = Metabolic sensors = Thiazolidinediones (TZD), rosiglitazone, and pioglitazone are all used to treat diabetes. These drugs act as agonists of the PPAR-Œ≥ receptor leading to insulin sensitizing effects that can improve glycemic control and serum triglyceride levels. Despite the positive effects these chemicals can have in treating diabetes patients, administration also lead to unwanted PPAR-Œ≥ mediated side effects such as peripheral edema which can be followed by persistent weight gain if the drug is used over a long period of time. These side effects are particularly prominent in diabetes 2 patients, a disease that tends to result from an overabundance of adipose tissue. = Sex steroid dysregulation = DES is a synthetic estrogen that was once prescribed to women to decrease the risk of miscarriage until it was found to be causing abnormalities in exposed offspring. This same chemical has been shown to cause weight gain in female mice when exposed during neonatal development. While exposure didn't lead to an abnormal birth weight, significant weight gain occurred much later in adulthood. = Central integration of energy balance = SSRI (e.g. paroxetine), tricyclic antidepressants (e.g. amitriptyline), tetracyclic antidepressants (e.g. mirtazapine) and atypical antipsychotics (e.g. clozapine) are all neuropharmaceuticals that target neurotransmitter receptors that are involved with brain circuits that regulate behavior. Often the function of these receptors overlaps with metabolism regulation, such as that of the H1 receptor which when activated decreases AMPK activity. As a result, the administration of these drugs can have side effects including increased lipid accumulation that can result in obesity. = Metabolic setpoints = The mechanisms behind SSRI, tricyclic antidepressants, and atypical antipsychotics function allow them all to have potential roles in the alteration of metabolic setpoints. TZD, in particular has been linked to regulatory function in the HPT axis, however, no conclusive evidence has been determined thus far and further research is required to confirm these hypotheses.  Environmental obesogens  While obesogens can be introduced to the body intentionally via administration of obesogenic pharmaceuticals, exposure can also occur through chemical exposure to obesogens found in the environment such as organotins and xenobiotics. = Organotins = Particular members of the organotin class of persistent organic pollutants (POPs), namely tributyltin (TBT) and triphenyltin (TPT) are highly selective and act as very potent agonists of both the retinoid X receptors (RXR Œ±,Œ≤, and Œ≥) and PPARŒ≥. This ability to target both receptors at the same time, is more effective than single receptor activation, as adopogenic signaling can be mediated through both components of the heterodimer complex. This highly effective activation mechanism can pose detrimental, long-term adipogenic effects especially if exposure occurs during development and early life. Organotins (tin-based chemicals), used in marine anti-fouling paints, wood catalysts, plasticizers, slimicides, in industrial water systems, and fungicides on food have recently been linked to obesogenic properties when introduced in the body. Human exposure to these major environmental sources most commonly occurs through ingestion of contaminated seafood, agricultural products, and drinking water as well as from exposure to leaching from plastics. Although studies that have directly measured organotin levels in human tissue and blood are limited, it has been determined that vulnerability of a portion of the general population to organotin exposure at levels high enough to activate RXRs and PPARŒ≥ receptors is very probable. The high usage of organotins in both plastics and agricultural maintenance as well as the high affinity of the chemicals further confirms this conclusion. Liver samples from the late 1990s in Europe and Asia contained on average 6 and 84 ng/g wet wt respectively for total organotin levels, while later studies found levels of total organotins in US blood samples averaged around 21 ng/mL with TBT comprising around 8 ng/mL (~ 27 nM). Even more recent analyses of European blood samples found the predominant species to be TPT rather than TBT at 0.09 and 0.67 ng/mL (~0.5-2 nM). Only occasional trace amounts of TBT were found. These results indicate that organtin exposure to humans, while found to be present among many different populations, can vary in terms of type of organatin and level of exposure from region to region. = Other xenobiotics = Other common xenobiotics found in the environment have been shown to have PPAR activity, posing even further threats to dysregulated metabolic balance. BPA from polycarbonate plastics, phthalate plasticizers used to soften PVC plastics, and various perfluoroalkyll compounds (PFCs) that are widely used surfactants and surface repellents in consumer products are all potentially obesogenic when introduced in the body. Phthalates and PFCs in particular have been found to function as agonists for one or more of the PPARs Additionally, metabolites of DHEP such as MEHP also activate PPARŒ≥ leading to a proadipogenic response. Public health implications Although research on endocrine disruptors or \\"obesogens\\" is still emerging, the public health implications so far have mainly surrounded obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. Obesity has become a global epidemic, increasing for all population groups. From 1980 to 2008, the rates of obesity have doubled for adults and tripled for children. In the U.S. alone, it has been estimated that almost 100 million individuals in are obese Traditional thinking suggested that diet and exercise alone were the main contributors to obesity; however, current experimental evidence shows that obesogens might be part of the cause. Obesity may lead to potentially debilitating chronic diseases such as diabetes, and certain environmental exposures, or obesogens, have been directly linked to Type II diabetes mellitus (T2DM). An estimated 25.8 million people, or 8.3% of the population in the US, have diabetes, and the crude prevalence of diagnosed diabetes increased by 176%, from 1980 through 2010. The disease and economic burden of diabetes, which is the seventh leading cause of death in the United States costing approximately $174 billion annually, is being addressed by organizations such as Healthy People 2020 which has diabetes listed as one of their 42 objectives. However, diabetes is a major obstacle to overcome especially when obesogens might be the uncontrolled, unsuspected cause. = Potential obesogens in everyday life = Obesogens can be found everywhere, from water bottles to microwaveable popcorn, and from nonstick pans to shower curtains. People interact with them on a daily basis, both intentionally and unintentionally, at work, school and home. They are an unnecessary and mostly preventable potential hazard to health, which can have a large impact on how individuals gain and lose weight. Bisphenol-A (BPA) is an industrial chemical and organic compound that has been used in the production of plastics and resins for over a half-century. It is used in products such as toys, medical devices, plastic food and beverage containers, shower curtains, dental sealants and compounds, and register receipts. BPA has been shown to seep into food sources from containers or into the body just by handling products made from it. Certain researchers suggest that BPA actually decreases the fat cell count in the body, but at the same time increasing the size of the ones remaining; therefore, no difference in weight is shown, and an individual is even likely to gain more. High-fructose corn syrup (HFCS) is found in many food products on grocery store shelves: by 2004, for example, it accounted for 40% of caloric sweeteners added to foods and beverages sold in the United States, and was the only caloric sweetener used in soft drinks. It is used as a food and drink sweetener and is an obesogen. Acting on insulin and leptin in the body, HFCS potentially increases appetite and fat production. Nicotine is the chemical found in tobacco products and certain insecticides. As an obesogen, nicotine mostly acts on prenatal development after maternal smoking occurs. A strong association has been made between maternal smoking and childhood overweight/obesity, with nicotine as the single causal agent. Arsenic is a metalloid (i.e., an element with some metallic properties) found in and on most naturally occurring substances on Earth. It can be found in the soil, ground water, air, and in small concentrations in food. Arsenic has many applications such as in the production of insecticides, herbicides, pesticides and electronic devices. The development of diabetes has been linked to arsenic exposure from drinking water and occupational contact. Pesticides are substances used to prevent, destroy, repel or mitigate pests, and they have been used throughout all of recorded history. Some pesticides persist for short periods of time and some for long periods of time which are considered persistent organic pollutants (POPs). Several cross-sectional studies have shown pesticides as obesogens, linking them to obesity, diabetes and other morbidities. Pharmaceutical drugs are also potentially obesogens. From 2005‚Äì2008, 11% of Americans aged 12 and over took antidepressant medications. Certain antidepressants, known as selectively serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), are potentially adding to the almost 100 million obese individuals in the U.S. A key function of SSRI antidepressants is to regulate the serotonin reuptake transporter (SERT) which can affect food intake and lipid accumulation leading to obesity. Organotins such as tributyltin (TBT) and triphenyltin (TPT) are endocrine disruptors that have been shown to increase triglyceride storage in adipocytes. Although they have been widely used in the marine industry since the 1960s, other common sources of human exposure include contaminated seafood and shellfish, fungicides on crops and as antifungal agents used in wood treatments, industrial water systems and textiles. Organotins are also being used in the manufacture of PVC plastics and have been identified in drinking water and food supplies. Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) is a surfactant used for reduction of friction, and it is also used in nonstick cookware. PFOA has been detected in the blood of more than 98% of the general US population. It is a potential endocrine disruptor. Animal studies have shown that prenatal exposure to PFOA is linked to obesity when reaching adulthood. Future research Most of the environmental obesogens currently identified are either classified into the category of chemical mimics of metabolic hormones throughout the body or of neurotransmitters within the brain. Because they fall into these two categories, extensive opportunities for complex interactions and varied sites of action as well as multiple molecular targets are open for consideration. Changing dose ranges tend to result in varying phenotypes and timing of exposure, gender, and gender predisposition introduce even more levels of complexity in how these substances effect the human body. Because the mechanisms behind the different effects of obesogens are so complex and not well understood, the extent to which they play in the current obesity epidemic may be greater than once thought. Epigenetic changes due to obesogen exposure must also be considered as a possibility, as they open up the potential for misregulated metabolic functions to be passed on from generation to generation. Epigenetic processes via hypermethylation of regulatory regions could lead to overexpression of different proteins, and therefore, amplification of acquired environmental effects. Research will be required in order to gain a better understanding of the mechanism of action these chemicals are involved in before the extent of the risk of exposure can be determined and methods of prevention and removal from the environment can be established.

Founded in 1954, as D. R. Stanley Associates in Edmonton, Alberta. Stantec provides professional consulting services in planning, engineering, architecture, interior design, landscape architecture, surveying, environmental sciences, project management, and project economics for infrastructure and facilities projects. The Company provides services on projects around the world through over 22,000 employees operating out of more than 410 locations in North America and across offices in 6 continents internationally. History Dr. Don Stanley was the first Canadian to earn a Ph.D. in environmental engineering. Attending Harvard University on a Rockefeller Foundation scholarship, he earned his doctorate in 1952 and two years later founded D.R. Stanley & Associates, working as the sole proprietor out of a office in Edmonton, Alberta. In 1955 Stanley hired a retired railway engineer, Herb Roblin, and a former chief bridge engineer for the provincial government, Louis Grimble. The firm was renamed Stanley, Grimble and Roblin Ltd. With the two new partners‚Äô transportation backgrounds, the firm diversified quickly. The 1970s were boom years for Stanley Associates, but with the advance of the sharp recession of the 1980s, Stanley was ready to turn the company over to his second-in-command, Ron Triffo, in 1983. Triffo held a bachelor's degree in civil engineering from the University of Manitoba and a MSc in Engineering from the University of Illinois. In 1983, when Alberta's economy was struggling in response to the Canadian government's National Energy Program, Triffo became president and COO, while Stanley retained his role as CEO and chair. ‚ÄúWe had cut our staff in half from 400 to about 200,‚Äù Triffo said. ‚ÄúWe really started to think about a new way of doing things for the company. We were heavily involved in Alberta in a big, big way and therefore very vulnerable to the up and down cycles of the province. We decided we had to diversify the company in a discipline sense. We had to become more than just a civil engineering company and we had to diversify geographically.‚Äù The company started its diversification by forming an urban development company under another name, IMC, which grew to 200 people. The diversification of Stanley Associates occurred by acquisition as well. The firm expanded into British Columbia and Saskatchewan and internationally, beginning a corporate move into central Canada. Stanley also made its first U.S. acquisition, in Phoenix, establishing a base for specialty services and future expansion in the US Southwest. Following the success of IMC, Stanley Associates' various practices operated under boutique names, with as many as 20 different companies. By the early 1990s, the companies were placed under the umbrella of Stanley Technology Group, and most subsidiaries featured the name Stanley in their name. Staff numbers neared 900 and the firm went public on the Toronto Stock Exchange in 1994. In 1998, Triffo stepped into the role of board chair, where he remained until retiring in 2011. Tony Franceschini, then vice president of the Commercial/Institutional sector and a Board member, became president and CEO. Franceschini began his career with a consulting engineering firm in Toronto, Ontario in 1975 after graduating from the University of Waterloo with a degree in civil engineering, where he worked with Triffo. The year Franceschini became president and CEO, Stantec had 2,000 employees in 40 offices and reported $185.5 million in gross revenue. ‚ÄúOur vision is to grow the company into a 10,000 employee, billion-dollar firm by 2008,‚Äù Franceschini said. Franceschini was instrumental in launching the new global, single-brand identity, Stantec, which enabled the company's services to be delivered through an integrated approach. ‚ÄúThe move was a major achievement ‚Äì‚Äì in a two- month period, we sought and received shareholder approval to change the name of over 30 companies,‚Äù says Franceschini. Stantec was listed on the New York Stock Exchange in 2005. Franceschini retired in May 2009. Bob Gomes was appointed president and CEO. Like the Stantec's previous three presidents, Gomes is a licensed engineer who earned his degree in civil engineering from the University of Alberta and joined Stantec in 1988. Between 2008 and 2011, gross revenue increased from $1.4 billion to $1.7 billion, Stantec team grew from 8,000 staff to over 12,000 staff, the Company acquired 16 firms, and has strengthened its presence in markets across North America and internationally. According to REUTERS, US Edition, \\"Its services are offered through more than 170 locations in North America and four locations internationally\\" In May 2016, Stantec signed a definitive merger agreement with MWH Global, Inc. worth $1.04 billion CAD making Stantec Inc. one of the world's top three global design firms. It is expected to boost revenues by 60% a year, and increased the number of employees from 15,000 to 22,000. Bob Gomes retired from Stantec in 2017 and is a current member of the board of directors. In January 2018, Gord Johnston became CEO of Stantec. Johnston has 30 years of private and public sector experience in the design and project management of infrastructure projects. Johnston has bachelor of science and master of engineering degrees in civil engineering from the University of Alberta, and is a registered professional engineer, certified project management professional, and Envision Sustainability Professional. =Growth= Stantec has 22,000 employees and 400 locations on six continents worldwide (as of 2016). =Acquisitions= Stantec has acquired over 130 firms since 1994.

He was first elected to the Oregon Legislative Assembly in 1980 as a Democrat representing Marion and Polk counties in the Oregon House of Representatives. Courtney gave up his House seat to run for the U.S. House of Representatives, 5th district, in the 1984 primary. Courtney narrowly lost to state senator Ruth McFarland, who had been the 1982 nominee. McFarland again lost to Congressman Denny Smith. Courtney ran for and narrowly lost a state Senate seat in 1986, before taking back his old state House seat in 1988. In the House he served as Democratic leader for eight years, longer than anyone else had before him. After repairs to the Oregon State Capitol were finished in 1995 after damage from the 1993 Scotts Mills earthquake, he gave a small piece of marble with an engraved image of the building to each Democrat in the House.

As the Omineca is part of the Arctic Ocean drainage, via the Peace and Mackenzie Rivers, and the Bear is in the basin of the Skeena River, which drains to the Pacific, The Thumb is located on the Continental Divide. Geology The Thumb is the largest in a cluster of roughly seven volcanic plugs. They are surrounded by the remains of eroded cinder cones, lava flows and dikes. Even though the plugs have not been dated, the existence of loose scoria and related intravalley lava flows to the current topography indicates they formed in the last 2.5 million years of the Quaternary period. The vertical structure of The Thumb develops a prominent monument rising approximately above smoothly rising landscape along the ridge of the Connelly Range. The Thumb is largely made of columnar basalt bounded by pockets of breccia comprising clasts of the basal sandstone that formed during the Paleocene period. The Thumb consists of alkali olivine basalt along with other Quaternary volcanic plugs in the Omineca Mountains. The basalt comprises phenocrysts of clinopyroxene and labradorite. Volcanic plugs in the Omineca Mountains, such as The Thumb, are located at the outermost boundary of all major volcanic belts in British Columbia, and their origins are not well- defined.

However, most of these converts reverted back to Islam and Christianity made little headway among the Tatars. A more lasting and significant presence of Kryashens emerged during a period of mosque destruction and anti-Muslim oppression from the Russian authorities during the 18th century. During the reign of Anna of Russia, many Muslims were forced or pressured to convert. New converts were exempted from paying taxes, were granted certain privileges, and were given better resources for the learning of their new faith. Most Tatars converted for economic or political reasons rather than conviction. Many continued to secretly practice Islam and were crypto-Muslims. By the end of the 19th century, several thousands once again reverted back to Islam. However, by the early 20th century, there was a significant Kryashen population that still continues to exist though in smaller numbers than in the past. In recent times the Kryashens have been facing assimilation by the Russians and other Tatar groups. This is also partly caused by the high intermarriage rates with Russians.  Literature and education  The earliest Kryashen works and literature were written using the Arabic script. However, a unaltered Cyrillic script was also used to translate religious material to Tatar. A modified Cyrillic script was adopted in 1862. By the early 20th century over 100 books were published using this script. In 1922, a modified Arabic script for writing Tatar was introduced to the Kryashens although the Cyrillic script continued in use until 1928 as this was when both scripts were replaced by the Latin script. The earliest literature was mainly religious and Christian in nature but around the 1910s a steady rise of secular works began being published. A newspaper for the Kryashen community was published from 1928 to 1929 in Kazan but soon ceased to exist afterwards. The Kryashens had little religious and educational infrastructure in the 16th and 17th centuries. However, during the 18th century they were given many privileges and facilities were built or accommodated for the Kryashens. The first Tatar school for converts was established in 1863 while the first seminary was founded in 1872.

Terry Lectureship, also known as the Terry Lectures, was established at Yale University in 1905 by a gift from Dwight H. Terry of Bridgeport, Connecticut. Its purpose is to engage both scholars and the public in a consideration of religion from a humanitarian point of view, in the light of modern science and philosophy. The subject matter has historically been similar to that of the Gifford Lectures in Scotland, and several lecturers have participated in both series. Establishment of the Lectureship The 1905 deed of gift establishing the lectureship states: Although commitment to the gift was made in 1905 it did not mature until 1923, which is when the first Terry lectures were held. Lecture format The lectures are free and open to the public. A single installment generally consists of four lectures by the same visiting scholar, given over the course of a month or less. Many of the lectures have been edited into books published by the Yale University Press, and remain in print to this day (see below) Since 1999, the lectures have been recorded and archived on the Terry Lectures website as audio and/or video streams.

He studied medicine in Paris, receiving his doctorate in 1834. For a few years he studied with Fr√©d√©ric Jules Sichel, and in 1839, he started his own practice.The American Encyclopedia and Dictionary of Ophthalmology, Volume 5 edited by Casey Albert Wood Deval is largely remembered for his written works on ophthalmic medicine, in particular, the 1844 \\"Trait√© de Chirurgie Oculaire\\", which was only the second French work devoted exclusively to eye surgery. This book was important because it helped introduce German and Austrian ophthalmic practices into French medicine. Prior to this publication, descriptions regarding methods of ophthalmological surgery practiced in these countries were not yet available in the French language. This book was a result of Deval's studies in Vienna with Friedrich J√§ger von Jaxtthal (1784‚Äì1871) and Anton von Rosas (1791‚Äì1855). Included in his treatise were explanations of medical innovations developed by German surgeons Louis Stromeyer (1804‚Äì1876) and Johann Friedrich Dieffenbach (1792‚Äì1847).

All three were disbanded by the end of 2011 due to the restructuring of the Polish Army. Its headquarters was in Wroc≈Çaw Its history dates back to the aftermath of World War II, when Military District Silesia (Okrƒôg Wojskowy ≈ölƒÖsk) was formed in 1945. District history The Silesian Military District Commander-in-Chief position was established in accordance with command of the Polish Army order No. 0208, authorized on August 22, 1945. On the basis of Headquarters First Army, the Military District Command of Silesia was created at Katowice. The district's area, which included the provinces of Silesian-DƒÖbrowski and Wroclaw province, is now dissolved. The organizational structure of the district headquarters was: * Command and Staff * Management of political and educational * Command of artillery and armor * Faculties: engineering, chemical, aerospace, personnel (human resources), health care and financial * Logistics * The prosecution and the court-martial When the district was created, several divisions were subsequently set to be deployed: Polish 2nd Warsaw Infantry Division, Polish 6th Pomeranian Infantry Division, 8th Dresden Infantry Division and the 10th Sudecka Infantry Division. Between August and September 1945 the largest changes occurred, as many of the military units were disbanded. Outside the county were the following divisions: the Polish 2nd Warsaw Infantry Division, 6 and Infantry Divisions 8, transferred to the Military Districts Krak√≥w and Lodz, with others came districts: 7, 11 and 13 Infantry Division (LWP). On October 22, 1945 the Silesia Military District had 42,291 soldiers. During this period, the district took command of subordinate units and the organization of military administration. At the same time, he took over the functions of the district headquarters, including the operational defense of its territorial area. In March 1946 the headquarters of the District were moved from Katowice to Wroc≈Çaw. On November 15, 1946 Silesia Military District Command was renamed the Command Military District No. IV (DOW IV), which remained in effect until 1953. In 1947, the district headquarters were put under control of the Land Forces Command. This was again reinstated by popular consensus on December 22, 1997. In 1948, the soldiers within the district were involved in removing land mines in the post-war clearance effort: 3.5 million mines and 7 million pieces of unexploded shells, bombs and missiles were located and removed. On 4 March 1949 the Poznan Military District was dissolved and the troops of its territory were incorporated into the Silesian Military District. In 1950, as a result of changes in administrative divisions within the district, there were five provinces recognized: Wroclaw, Poznan, Katowice, Opole, and Zielona. Troops of the district were involved in suppressing the Pozna≈Ñ 1956 protests. In the early 1960s the armed forces were divided into the Army Operational and territorial defense. On the basis of the operational units of the Silesian Military District, the Second Army was formed in the event that a war broke out, and the army was included in the Polish Front. This was in accordance with the United Armed Forces of the Warsaw Pact. In July 1968, the 2nd Army was reformed from the district's troops for the purpose of participation in Operation Danube. The army, commanded by general Florian Siwicki, was disbanded in November 1968. The army consisted of 30,000 soldiers, 7,000 transport vehicles, 750 tanks, and 592 APCs. In November 1973 the District began contributing soldiers to the composition of UN interim Force, supervising the truce in the Middle East. Since then, they have been used in a variety of tasks throughout the world, such as in Egypt, Syria, Namibia Western Sahara, Cambodia Iran, Iraq and countries of the former Yugoslavia. District officers have performed as United Nations military observers since 1953. In the years 1953-1957 and from 1973, SCO officers were involved in the International Control Commission in (Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia). As a result of further administrative division in 1975, Silesian Military District expanded to have 13 provinces within its radius of control, adding the following provinces; Czestochowa, Jelenia Gora, Walbrzych, Legnica, Leszno, Kalisz Voivodeship, Sieradz, and Gorzow. The 1990s were a period of restructuring for the Polish Army. The subordination of the District meant that there were 5 divisions, which developed a number of support units, with the total number of troops reaching approximately 100,000. In 1993, in connection with the establishment of the Cracow Military District, the Silesian Military District had the Katowice and Czestochowa provinces removed, leaving a total of 11 provinces under its jurisdiction. Since 1998 the Silesian Military District has covered 9 provinces: Lubuskie, Silesian, Opole, Silesian, Lesser, Subcarpathian, Lublin, ≈öwiƒôtokrzyskie, and Lodz. SCO is one of the two existing military districts, and its area covers close to 143,000 km2 of the country and has a population of around 21 million citizens. The reorganization of the Polish Armed Forces carried out in the second half of the 1990s and at the beginning of the 2000s meant that it solved many problems regarding military units, including the finalization of the following districts: * 5th Kresowa Mechanised Division (resolved 31 December 1998) * 10th Sudecka Mechanised Division in Opole (resolved 11 November 1999) * 4th Lubuska Mechanised Division in Krosno Odrza≈Ñskie (disbanded (\\"resolved\\") 31 March 2001). (see :pl:4 Lubuska Dywizja Zmechanizowana) The only division that has endured the period of restructuring in the Silesian Military District was the 11th Armoured Cavalry Division, which passed to the command of the 2nd Mechanised Corps in Krak√≥w. A new chapter in the history of the Silesian Military District was the Polish accession to NATO. Since joining NATO, soldiers within the District have participated in the allied exercises and operations:Dynamic Response '99, Allied Effort '01, Strong Resolve and 02 Enduring Freedom. Since 2000, soldiers of the district have begun to fulfil their first mission as the members of the military alliance as part of NATO's KFOR in Kosovo. In 2001 the District passed the operational unit focused on territorial defense. The district took over the tasks of logistic support, territorial defense, the military administration and fulfillment of all important functions of the host country, which was a novelty in the Polish Armed Forces. During this period, new military units were created. It was decided to set up five engineering rescue battalions, which hold a very important place in the logistics tasks involved. The structure has four District Material Bases: Wroclaw, Bobrza≈Ñski Novgorod, Lodz, and Ponds, which deal with peace and wartime supply of its own and allied units operating in the District. In March 2004, adopted in the subordination of the District 1 Dƒôbli≈Ñski Regiment Road and Bridge abutment and 10 Logistic Brigade with Opole.

William Empson was educated at Winchester, and Trinity College, Cambridge. He was Professor at the East India Company's College from 1824 to 1852. He contributed regularly to the Edinburgh Review (1823‚Äì49) and was for some years its editor (1847‚Äì52). Life He was educated at Winchester School, where he was a schoolfellow of Thomas Arnold, and at Trinity College, Cambridge. He graduated B.A. 1812, and M.A. 1815. On 2 July 1824 he became professor of \\"general polity and the laws of England\\" at the East India College, Haileybury, a chair which had been formerly occupied by Sir James Mackintosh. He was a close friend of his colleague, Robert Malthus. Empson died at Haileybury 10 December 1852. Edinburgh Review Empson began to contribute to the Edinburgh Review in 1823, and by 1849 had written over sixty articles for it on law, politics, and literary topics. Empson is now best known for his October 1843 article on Jeremy Bentham, a review of the Memoir of Jeremy Bentham by John Bowring. It produced a contradiction from John Stuart Mill, published in the Review for January 1844. Empson had picked up on Bowring's statement that Bentham was remarkably selfish, comparable only to his follower James Mill.W. J. Mander, Alan P. F. Sell, Gavin Budge (editors), The Dictionary of Nineteenth-century British Philosophers, Volume 1 (2002), pp. 357‚Äì8. In January 1845 he wrote on the Fragment of the Church of Thomas Arnold, with whose views on educational and church questions he was in sympathy. Other articles offended Edward Bulwer and Henry Brougham, who called him a bad imitator of Macaulay. Empson succeeded to the editorship of the Edinburgh Review in 1847, on the death of Macvey Napier.

LPI was introduced in 1970 by Polish‚ÄìSwiss mathematician Edward Kofler (1911‚Äì2007) to simplify decision processes. Compared to other methods the LPI-fuzziness is algorithmically simple and particularly in decision making, more practically oriented. Instead of an indicator function the decision maker linearizes any fuzziness by establishing of linear restrictions for fuzzy probability distributions or normalized weights. In the LPI-procedure the decision maker linearizes any fuzziness instead of applying a membership function. This can be done by establishing stochastic and non-stochastic LPI-relations. A mixed stochastic and non- stochastic fuzzification is often a basis for the LPI-procedure. By using the LPI-methods any fuzziness in any decision situation can be considered on the base of the linear fuzzy logic.  Definition  Any Stochastic Partial Information SPI(p), which can be considered as a solution of a linear inequality system, is called Linear Partial Information LPI(p) about probability p. It can be considered as an LPI-fuzzification of the probability p corresponding to the concepts of linear fuzzy logic.  Applications  ;The MaxEmin Principle : To obtain the maximally warranted expected value, the decision maker has to choose the strategy which maximizes the minimal expected value. This procedure leads to the MaxEmin ‚Äì Principle and is an extension of the Bernoulli's principle. ;The MaxWmin Principle : This principle leads to the maximal guaranteed weight function, regarding the extreme weights. ;The Prognostic Decision Principle (PDP) : This principle is based on the prognosis interpretation of strategies under fuzziness.  Fuzzy equilibrium and stability  Despite the fuzziness of information, it is often necessary to choose the optimal, most cautious strategy, for example in economic planning, in conflict situations or in daily decisions. This is impossible without the concept of fuzzy equilibrium. The concept of fuzzy stability is considered as an extension into a time interval, taking into account the corresponding stability area of the decision maker. The more complex is the model, the softer a choice has to be considered. The idea of fuzzy equilibrium is based on the optimization principles. Therefore, the MaxEmin-, MaxGmin- and PDP- stability have to be analyzed. The violation of these principles leads often to wrong predictions and decisions.  LPI equilibrium point  Considering a given LPI-decision model, as a convolution of the corresponding fuzzy states or a disturbance set, the fuzzy equilibrium strategy remains the most cautious one, despite of the presence of the fuzziness. Any deviation from this strategy can cause a loss for the decision maker.

Image of Biblioteca Askeviana, 1775, Dr. Anthony Askew Anthony Askew (1722‚Äì1774) was an English physician and is best known for having been a book collector. His collection was purchased by the British Museum and books purchased by George III of England were added to the King's Library. Life and work Askew was born in 1722 in Kendal, Westmorland, the son of Dr. Adam Askew, a well-known physician of Newcastle and Ann Crackenthorp. He was baptised in Kendal on 7 May 1722. The family moved to Newcastle in 1725. His early education was at Sedbergh School and The Royal Free Grammar School in Newcastle upon Tyne. According to a fellow physician, he was terrified of the formidable Head Master, Richard Dawes. (Dictionary of National Biography is available under the Creative Commons Attribution/Share- Alike License) He was married twice. He first married Margaret Swinburn; they had no children. The second time to Elizabeth Holford, by whom he had twelve children, six girls and six boys. Elizabeth was born in 1734 and died on 2 August 1773. Medical education and career He took the degree of Bachelor of Medicine, Bachelor of Surgery (M.B.) at Emmanuel College, Cambridge in December 1745. Initially intended for the medical profession, Askew studied for one year at Leiden University in Holland. He then travelled to Hungary, Athens, Constantinople, Italy, and other countries. He began to collect valuable books and manuscripts he laid the foundation of the extensive library, the Bibliotheca Askeviana. He started medical practice at Cambridge in 1750, in which year he took his degree of Doctor of Medicine (M.D.), and afterwards established himself in London. He was physician to St. Bartholomew's and Christ's Hospital, and Registrar of the College of Physicians from 1767 until 1774. On 8 February 1749 he became a member of the Royal Society. On 25 June 1752 he became a candidate of the Royal College of Physicians and one year later became a fellow of the organisation. In 1758 he delivered the Harveian Oration at the Royal College of Physicians. Book collector Askew is best known today as a classical scholar and bibliophile. Aeschylus was his favourite author. He assembled an extensive library, the Bibliotheca Askeviana, helping to develop the taste for curious manuscripts, scarce editions, and fine copies. Askew's house was crowded with books from the cellar up to the garrets. The collection was chiefly classical, and it was its possessor's aim to have every edition of every Greek author. In Thornton's Medical Books, Libraries and Collectors, Alain Besson wrote that Askew's library was replete with \\"rare manuscripts and choice editions in exquisite bindings\\". He further stated that Askew made \\"bibliomania fashionable.\\" Death Askew died 28 February 1774 at Hampstead, London, England. He was buried at Hampstead church. Henry Askew, Anthony's brother, became the caregiver for the orphaned children. After the death of Askew, the library of nearly 7,000 books, was sold at an auction which lasted from 13 February to 7 March 1775. William Munk stated that the library collection was sold beginning 19 February 1775 by Baker and Leigh; the sale continued for 19 days. The catalogue of the collection was sold at one shilling and sixpence, with a few copies on royal paper at four shillings... The purchasers of Askew's books at the auction included the anatomist William Hunter, the British Museum and the kings of England and France. Books purchased by George III of England in 1762, and the Second Folio of Shakespeare bought in 1800, were added to the King's Library. Askew's extensive collection of transcribed inscriptions is at the British Museum. One codex of his collection is named Askew Codex.

Early life He was son of Prince David of Kakheti (1612-1648), son of King Teimuraz I, by his wife Helene n√©e Princess Diasamidze (died 1695). Taken to Russia when the pro-Persian king Rostom of Kartli defeated Teimuraz in 1648, he was raised and educated at the Romanov court at Moscow where he was known as Tsarevich Nicholas Davidovich (). In 1662, he returned to take over the then-vacant crown of Kakheti at the invitation of local nobility, but was defeated by the rival prince Archil who enjoyed Iranian support. Nicholas had to flee back to Russia where he featured prominently and was best man of Tsar Alexis Mikhailovich in his wedding to Natalia Naryshkina in 1671 and stood in high favor with the Russian court. It is believed by some that he was a natural father of Peter the Great. The writer Aleksey Nikolayevich Tolstoy researching the biography of Peter the Great, informed Joseph Stalin that he had unearthed some documents which suggested Peter's father was a Georgian king. He thought he would ingratiate himself with Stalin by telling him this. Instead Stalin was appalled and forbade Tolstoy to mention the matter ever again.Martin McCauley, Stalin and Stalinism: Revised 3rd Edition, 2013, p. 94 Royal career =In Kakheti= In 1675, Archil conflicted with the shah's government, abandoned Kakheti and defected to the Ottoman Empire. Prince Nicholas capitalized on the ensuing turmoil, returned for a second time and was proclaimed as King of Kakheti Heraclius (Erekle) I. Earlier, in 1666, shah Suleiman I had succeeded Abbas II on the Iranian Safavid throne. In 1674, Suleiman I asked him to decisively end his stay in Russia, ordered him to Isfahan and promised to confirm him as king if Heraclius apostatized to Islam. The king refused to become Muslim and the shah's subject, citing the oath of allegiance given by his ancestor, Alexander II of Kakheti (r. 1574‚Äì1605), to Feodor I of Russia. Hence, he was deprived of the crown, being allowed, however, to settle to Isfahan. Kakheti was subsequently under direct Safavid rule. =In Kartli= In 1688, when the government of Iran declared its recalcitrant subject George XI of Kartli deposed, Heraclius acceded to the shah's pressure. He converted to IslamIslamic desk reference By E. J. van Donzel, pg.111 assuming the title of Nazar Alƒ´ KhƒÅn in 1676. In reward, Heraclius was confirmed as King of Kartli and given a Persian army to win over the crown. To buttress Heraclius's authority, the shah appointed 'AbbƒÅs-qolƒ´ Khan, formerly a beglarbeg of Ganja, as Persian viceroy in Kakheti (residing at Qara-Agach). The khan failed, however, to prevent George XI from staging a comeback in 1691 and blockading Heraclius (Nazar Alƒ´ KhƒÅn) in Tiflis, his capital. It was not until 1696 that George admitted defeat and came to Isfahan to offer his submission to the new shah, Soltan Hosayn. At the same time, the shah grew increasingly dissatisfied with Nazar Alƒ´ KhƒÅn's administration. Having spent most of his life in Russia and Iran, his lack of knowledge of Georgian national traditions he had already estranged his subjects. A vacillating ruler, addicted to strong drink, though capable at times of being brave, philanthropic and reformist, he never really achieved a firm control of his possessions, or made himself popular with the populace of Kakheti. Meanwhile, George XI managed to gain the favor of Shah Hosayn and was reconfirmed as King of Kartli in 1703, while Nazar Alƒ´ KhƒÅn was removed from the throne and ordered to Isfahan where he was invested by Hosayn as King of Kakheti and appointed the commander of the shah's personal guard. He was never able to return to his kingdom, however, and died at the Persian capital in 1710, being succeeded on the throne by his son, David II (ImƒÅm Qulƒ´ KhƒÅn), who had run Kakheti during Nazar Alƒ´ KhƒÅn's absence at Isfahan.

In either 1421 or 1422, he became Archdeacon of Ross on exchange with John de Inchmartin, and was issued a new papal provision on 6 October 1422; his provision was repeated on 11 March 1431.Watt, Fasti Ecclesiae, p. 286. Following the death of John Bullock, Bishop of Ross, in either 1439 or 1440, Munro was postulated as Bullock's successor by the cathedral chapter; his postulation, rather than election, occurred because Munro had a \\"defect of birth\\", being the son of an unmarried woman and a priest.Dowden, Bishops, p. 218; Watt, Fasti Ecclesiae, p. 268. Despite much effort and expense, the postulation was rejected by Pope Eugenius IV, who provided instead Thomas Tulloch, the cathedral Dean. In compensation, on 4 March 1441, Eugenius granted Munro a pension of ¬£40, to be taken from the mensal revenues of the Bishop of Ross. Munro however sought confirmation of his postulation from the Anti-Pope, Felix V, at Basel in the Kingdom of Germany. Felix V confirmed Munro's postulation on 30 May but it was not effective. Munro is heard of again as the Commissary of the diocese of Ross in 1451, while still holding the archdeaconry; he had died by 24 October 1454.Watt, Fasti Ecclesiae, pp. 286, 288.

He diminished these activities during the 1990s.Interview during Stamp Show 2000 , The Chronicle, October 2000, page 2. At the end of the 1950s, Matthews registered to the Council of Industrial Design, which proposed graphic artists to client entities. In 1959, he was amongst the designers the Council proposed to the Post Office; the British postal administration was looking for the design of two stamp series to mark its 300th anniversary. He was then regularly invited to propose stamp projects. His two first postage stamps were issued in 1965 for the 20th anniversary of the United Nations. The Machin series In the 1970s, he became involved in the designs of new Machin definitive stamps, picturing Queen Elizabeth II's profile since 1967. When ordered, he designed new symbols for the Regional Machins in 1971, with new digits and letters.Interview during Stamp Show 2000 , The Chronicle, October 2000, page 1. Philatelic recognition came from his work on the Machin series colours. In 1976, he prepared the three colours needed for the photograved high value stamps. In the middle of the 1980s, he provided the Post Office with a large palette of colours, sufficient for the new next values.

The firm was founded in 1981 as a spin-off from Strategic Planning Associates (now Oliver Wyman) by Michael Kaiser, currently President of the John F.

The firm is noted for its benchmarking, competitive analysis, voice of customer, commercial diligence work supporting investment decisions, and other externally driven strategic development work, developed in the 1980s through extensive work with IBM and General Motors and codified in a number of books including Developing Industry Strategies: A Practical Guide of Industry Analysis (1983) and Understanding the Competition: A Practical Guide of Competitive Analysis (1981), and Beating the Competition: A Practical Guide to Benchmarking. Kaiser's notoriety for benchmarking was continued through the late 1980s and early 1990s under Robert \\"Bob\\" Fifer, a graduate of Harvard Business School whose primary focus was on helping corporate CEOs improve profits through novel methods. His insights were detailed in his book Double Your Profits In Six Months or Less (1995) and The Enlightened CEO: How to Succeed at the Toughest Job in Business (2007). Fifer's departure from the firm marked a transition away from a focus on benchmarking and movement towards more traditional strategic consulting, including a wider array of strategic development and organizational management work competing with other traditional management consulting firms. Kaiser's consulting work has covered topics such as defining innovation metrics and impact on markets, its economic development practice, and its work developing onboarding and new-hire orientation programs for major corporations.

His surviving, undisputed legacy consists of three baroque churches and Moscow Orphanage. The Ukrainian palace of Kachanovka is also attributed to him.  Biography  Blank's ancestors were French Huguenot refugees who settled in Germany. His grandfather, Jacob, a skilled blacksmith, migrated to Russia during the reign of Peter I. Father, already having a russified name, Ivan Yakovlevich Blank, began his career as an interpreter for the German architects in Saint Petersburg. Eventually, he became an assistant to Russian architect, Pyotr Yeropkin, who was closely associated with then-powerful courtier Artemy Volynsky. In June 1740, Volynsky and Yeropkin lost their heads for the alleged conspiracy against Anna of Russia. Ivan Blank was sentenced to lifelong exile in Siberia with all his family. Karl's mother died during the long way to Tobolsk. In Tobolsk, Ivan and Karl met a talented local boy, Alexander Kokorinov. In 1741, when Elizabeth of Russia came to power and pardoned all involved in Volynsky trial, Blanks were allowed to return home; they took Kokorinov with them and left for Moscow. However, Ivan Blank died soon upon his return. Karl Blank and Alexander Kokorinov joined state construction crews led by Ivan Korobov and Pyotr Obukhov. By 1749, Karl passed junior architects' exams to the panel presided by Bartolomeo Rastrelli and was appointed an assistant to Alexey Yevlashev. Rastrelli supervised Blank's early career and instructed him to plan restoration and expansion drafts for the main cathedral of the New Jerusalem Monastery. This early project never materialized, but a few years later, from 1756 to 1759 Blank himself took the lead in restoring New Jerusalem. His own early designs, like the completed Annenhof palace in Lefortovo, did not survive (they burnt down in the Fire of 1812 or otherwise perished before the invention of photography). Blank's career peaked in 1760s, in the reign of Catherine II. He successfully managed the architectural part of Catherine's coronation in Moscow; the new empress commissioned him to build church of St. Catherine in Zamoskvorechye. Despite subsequent fires and rebuilds, original dome of St. Catherine's still stands in Bolshaya Ordynka Street. Blank became a house architect for Ivan Vorontsov, and built two extant churches on Vorontsov's lands (one in Moscow, one in his country estate). The fourth extant church stands near Yauza Gates; two other Moscow churches were demolished in 1930s. Some researchers also give him full credit for the Trinity church in present-day Zheleznodorozhny. Image:Moscow, Rozhdestvenka, St.Nicholas v Zvonaryakh.jpgSt. Nicholas church, Rozhdestvenka Street Image:Catherine Church on Field MOW 02.jpgSt. Catherine church, Zamoskvorechye Image:Wiki Yauzskye Gates Church.jpgTrinity church by Yauza River From 1764 to 1781, Blank built his largest project, Moscow Orphanage, designed to house 8,000 resident children and staff. Only two thirds of his original plan were completed; the eastern wing was added only in 1940s. The Orphanage is believed to be Moscow's first neoclassical building, and is surely the earliest extant example of the style, retaining most of original exterior. The Orphanage earned him a reputation of a manager who could handle the largest projects of his time; at the same time its austere looks scared off the customers. Soon after acquiring the Kremlin Senate commission in 1775, Blank was stripped of the job (the Senate was redesigned and completed by Matvey Kazakov); his third large work for the state, Catherine's Institute in Meshchansky District of Moscow, burnt down in 1812. In the 1780s, Blank quit independent construction management and became a consultant in landscaping and interior design; his advise was sought after by the wealthiest nobles. Notably, he consulted count Pyotr Sheremetyev on Kuskovo palace project, and personally designed the Hermitage and Dutch house pavilions. Blank had five children; among his descendants are Nikolay Basargin, a convicted decembrist, and notable geographer Pyotr Semenov-Tyan-Shansky.

He also was instrumental in the USGA's decision to take the Open to Pebble Beach Golf Links, south of the Bay Area, for the first time in 1972; the championship has since returned there five times: in 1982, 1992, 2000, 2010, and 2019. =Activist, golf course architect, promoter= In the early 2000s, Tatum led a successful campaign for renovation of the Harding Park Golf Club in San Francisco, which had previously hosted many PGA Tour events in the 1950s and 1960s, but which had fallen into disrepair. It took several years, but the Harding Park course was restored to prominence, and has since held several high-profile golf events. Tatum was involved in the design and development of The Links at Spanish Bay golf course in Pebble Beach, California. He co-designed The Preserve Golf Club in Carmel, California and Lockeford Springs Golf Course in Lodi, California, as well as Mount Shasta Resort in Mount Shasta, California. He was involved with The First Tee of San Francisco chapter out of Harding Park, and went on to host \\"Sandy's Circle\\" through the Northern California Golf Association to help fund the Youth on Course subsidized round program in 2007. Tatum was inducted into the Bay Area Sports Hall of Fame in April 2011. Law career Following his graduation from Stanford, Tatum attended Oxford University as a Rhodes Scholar, and received his BCL in 1949. He returned to Stanford, where he earned a JD in 1950, and was admitted to the bar in California in 1950. He was an attorney with Cooley Godward Kronish in Palo Alto, California. Death Tatum died on June 22, 2017 at the age of 96.

Hundreds of wounded Croatian soldiers from Zagreb hospitals and civilians were dumped in a pit here in the ≈Ωumberak Mountains area of Croatia. Some were already dead, but others died of exposure and injuries. Since the site was rediscovered in 1990, when more 800 skeletons were found, an annual pilgrimage has been organized. History The first victims are believed to have been soldiers of the fascist puppet state Independent State of Croatia, captured by Partisan forces after a battle near Kra≈°iƒá in January 1943. Some were likely shot before being dumped into the pit; others might have been thrown in alive. Later in 1945 the Partisans used the pit to dispose secretly of bodies of prisoners of war. They also dumped wounded Croatian soldiers, medical staff, and Catholic nuns. https://hrcak.srce.hr/90525 While local people retained the memory of these events, the Communist government suppressed any acknowledgement of these wartime murders by the Partisans. In 1990, after the fall of socialism in Croatia, the pit was rediscovered. At a depth of around , the remains of more 800 skeletons were found. Since this period, the Catholic Church in Croatia has organised an annual pilgrimage to the site. It is held on June 22 and coincides with Anti-Fascist Struggle Day. The Church has lined the path to the pit from a nearby village with images of stations of the cross. The event is reported as popular among members of fringe right wing groups in Croatia.  Notable victims  * Gaudencija ≈†plajt, Roman Catholic nun who was sentenced to execution by shooting by the Partisan military court in Zagreb on 29 June 1945.

The battleground was later called az-Zallaqah (in English \\"slippery ground\\") because of the poor footing caused by the tremendous amount of blood shed that day, which gave rise to its name in Arabic. Preparations After Alfonso VI, King of Le√≥n and Castile, captured Toledo in 1085 and invaded the taifa of Zaragoza, the emirs of the smaller taifa kingdoms of Islamic Iberia found that they could not resist him without external assistance. In 1086 Yusuf ibn Tashfin was invited by them to fight against Alfonso VI. In that year, he replied to the call of three Andalusian leaders (Al-Mu'tamid ibn Abbad and others) and crossed the straits to Algeciras and moved to Seville. From there, accompanied by the emirs of Seville, Granada, and Taifa of M√°laga marched to Badajoz.O'Callaghan, Joseph F.(1983), 208 and 209 Alfonso VI abandoned the siege of Zaragoza, recalled his troops from Valencia, and appealed to Sancho I of Aragon for help. Finally he set out to meet the enemy northeast of Badajoz. The two armies met each other on 23 October 1086.O'Callaghan, Joseph F.(1983), 209 Alfonso VI of Castile reached the battleground with some 2,500 men, including 1,500 cavalry, in which 750 were knights, some of whom were Jewish,France, John, Western Warfare in the Age of the Crusades, 1000-1300, 162. but found himself outnumbered. The two leaders exchanged messages before the battle. Yusuf ibn Tashfin is reputed to have offered three choices to the Castilians: convert to Islam, to pay tribute (jizyah), or battle.David Levering Lewis, 364; \\"Faithful to the precedent set by the prophet Muhammad, Yusuf sent a messenger to offer Alfonso three alternatives; convert to Islam; submit to the protection of Islam; decide their differences on the battlefield.\\". Battle The battle started on Friday at dawn with an attack from Castile. Yusuf ibn Tashfin divided his army into three divisions. The first division was led by Abbad III al- Mu'tamid, the second division was led by Yusuf ibn Tashfin, and the third division consisted of black African warriors with Talwars and long javelins. Abbad III al-Mu'tamid and his division battled with Alfonso VI alone till the afternoon, then Yusuf ibn Tashfin and his division joined the battle and encircled Alfonso VI and his troops. Alfonso's troops panicked and started to lose ground, then Yusuf ordered the third division of his army to attack and finish the battle. Aftermath More than half the Castilian army was lost. One source claims that only 500 knights returned to Castile, although others do not support this low figure, so it seems that most of the nobility survived. The dead included counts Rodrigo Mu√±oz and Vela Oveguez. King Alfonso VI sustained an injury to one leg that caused him to limp for the rest of his life. Casualties were also heavy on the Almoravid side, especially for the hosts led by Dawud ibn Aysa, whose camp was even sacked in the first hours of battle, and by the Emir of Badajoz, al-Mutawakkil ibn al-Aftas. The Sevillan Emir al-Mu'tamid had been wounded in the first clash but his personal example of valour rallied the al-Andalus forces in the difficult moments of the initial Castilian charge led by Alvar Fa√±ez. Those killed included a very popular imam from Cordoba, Abu-l-Abbas Ahmad ibn Rumayla, and members of Ibn Khaldun's family are also known to have been killed in the battle. The battle was a decisive victory for the Almoravids but their losses meant that it was not possible to follow it up although Yusuf had to return prematurely to Africa due to the death of his heir. Castile suffered almost no loss of territory and was able to retain the city of Toledo, occupied the previous year. However, the Christian advance was halted for several generations while both sides regrouped. Notes References * Dupuy, R. Ernest and Trevor N.

In these catalogues, each painting by an artist was assigned a unique number. These index numbers are now used throughout the art world, in art texts, and on art websites to uniquely identify specific works of art by specific artists. Lemonedes, Heather, Lynn Federle Orr and David Steel, Monet in Normandy, Rizzoli International Publications, 2006, An example is the ' (), which is a four volume set published in 1996 with 2,580 illustrations in 1,540 pages. In this set, volume I is a biography and volumes II-IV contain a chronological listing of Monet's work; that is to say, volume II contains Wildenstein Index No. 1 produced in 1858 through No. 968 produced in 1885. The catalogue is produced with text in French, English, and German. The original version of this set was a five-volume black-and-white edition that has become collectible at costs of approximately U.S.$10,000 because it was originally only available to large museums or major universities' art departments. The original black- and-white version was published in 1974 in four volumes and had a 1991 supplementary volume of additional paintings as well as drawings and pastels. The 1996 revised edition in multiple languages does not include pastels, drawings, letters or footnotes from the original edition. Thus, the original is the most valuable resource for scholars.Ganz, James A. and Richard Kendall, The Unknown Monet: Pastels and Drawings, 2007, Sterling and Francine Clark Art Institute, , p. XI.However, this gives the foundation an effective monopoly over deciding whether a work of art is a genuine Monet, or not. This has been called into question, as the Wildensteins are free to disregard the opinions of art experts and art historians worldwide if they so choose (as discussed in the BBC programme Fake or Fortune? broadcast by the BBC on June 19, 2011 referring to the painting '). See: Although most of the catalogues are published with Daniel as the author, other members of the five-generation family business were also responsible for promulgating this numbering system. Daniel's father Georges Wildenstein published catalogues raisonn√©s for Jean- Honor√© Fragonard and Jean-Baptiste-Sim√©on Chardin in the 1960s. His son, Alec, has published a catalogue for Odilon Redon.

Headquartered in Jacksonville, Florida, Acosta is a sales and marketing company for consumer packaged goods (CPG) companies. Customers include Clorox and Coca-Cola, which have been clients since the 1930s and 1950s, respectively. History Acosta is a sales and marketing agency in Jacksonville, Florida, founded in 1927. Throughout its history Acosta has grown its business through acquisition. In 1956, Common & Company Food Brokers merged with Acosta. Robert (Hy) Albritton, who owned Common, became president and CEO of Acosta when Lou Acosta retired in 1959. Answers.com, Acosta Sales & Marketing Company For the first 40 years, the company expanded in northeast Florida but remained small and profitable; in the early 1970s there were around 12 employees servicing a single market. Beginning in the 1970s, the Company recognized the value of increased reach and believed that further consolidation would occur with Consumer Packaged Goods (CPG) companies, retailers and wholesalers. In 1974 Hy Albritton retired and Delmer Dallas became company president; expansion was at the top of his agenda. An office in Tampa was opened and the service area expanded to central Florida. A branch in Birmingham, Alabama, was started in 1977. In 1981, the Miami office was opened, and Acosta began serving the whole state of Florida. Dallas recognized that the company could grow faster through acquisitions so Raley Brothers was purchased in 1983, providing an immediate presence in Georgia. Acosta began doing business in the Carolinas in 1989, effectively covering the southeast U.S. Thereafter, the company expanded westward into Louisiana and began operations in Tennessee and Virginia. In the 1990s, mass consolidation of food retailers and manufacturers and centralization of procurement centers took place. In 1992, the top five chains accounted for less than 20% of all grocery sales, but as mass retailers like Walmart began to sell groceries, the dynamics in the industry changed. In order to compete, supermarket chains had to become larger as well, and a wave of major mergers took place. By the mid-1990s, the company was servicing 27 markets and employed over 2,000 and held a leading position in the Southeast, seeking growth beyond its core region and the traditional CPG sales and marketing agency business. With the merger of Acosta and PMI-Eisenhart (located in the Midwest) in July 1998 and the subsequent acquisitions of Kelley-Clarke (located in the West) in June 1999, the MAI companies (located in the Northeast) in August 1999, and Luke Soules (located in Texas and New Mexico) in July 2003. In 2002, the company also expanded into Canada by bringing together five leading agencies across the country. By the early 2000s, the top five grocery chains controlled 40% of all sales, and the consolidation trend continued. Faced with a handful of supermarket chains to sell to, manufacturers began to consolidate as well. As a result, both manufacturers and nationwide chains wanted to deal with national sales and marketing agents rather than contend with regional firms. Acosta has also bolstered its business through various acquisitions of agencies dedicated to certain business channels. For example, in 2008 Acosta acquired C. Lloyd Johnson Company and entered the military channel, and in 2010 it acquired FrontLine Marketing to expand its marketing in-store activation services. In 2012, the company entered the foodservice channel through various acquisitions which shaped a national foodservice platform.

Its surface area is . The lake is located above the village of Erlenbach im Simmental, below Mt. Stockhorn. During the 19th and 20th centuries, the \\"Oberstockensee\\" was often called the Vorderstockensee and/or Spetbaerglisee. Local residents still refer to it as the \\"Spetbaerglisee.\\" Vorderstocken and Spetbaergli are the two alpine meadows that are on opposite sides of the lake. Drowning incidents Five people drowned in the \\"Oberstockensee\\" in a tragic accident on Sunday, 1 August 1869 (the Swiss national \\"Independence Day\\" holiday) on Mt. Stockhorn: ‚Ä¢ Johann Gottfried Batzli (1830-1869), the president of the Erlenbach im Simmental Community Council, who only shortly before had been the miller and baker at the lower mill on the \\"Wildenbach\\" creek in the village and was long remembered because of his winning personality and his friendly, gentle voice ‚Ä¢ Johannes Batzli (1862-1869), the seven-year-old orphaned son of a first cousin of the community council president ‚Ä¢ Rudolf Jutzeler (1853-1869), a sixteen-year-old godson of Susanna Katharina Buehler Zurbruegg (1800-1859), the mother-in-law of Johann Gottfried Batzli ‚Ä¢ David Sulzener Jr. (1851-1869), an eighteen-year-old hired hand working for the Batzli brothers on the \\"Hinterstocken\\" alpine pasture ‚Ä¢ Samuel Tschabold (1853-1869), the sixteen-year-old son of Jakob Tschabold Jr. (b. 1806), who had been working with his father on the \\"Spetbaergli\\" alpine pasture. Although hardly any specific details are known that caused the deathly course of events, oral history reports agree that the little boat set out on the east side of the lake below the \\"Oberstocken\\" alpine pasture heading for the herdsmen‚Ä≤s little hut on the \\"Spetbaergli\\" pastures on the west side of the lake. Susanna Katharina Zurbruegg Batzli (1829-1901), who had been with her husband on the \\"Hinterstocken\\" alpine pasture chose not to accompany the men in their little boat. Picking wild flowers as she walked along the rocky narrow pathway (locally known as \\"the evil footpath\\"), she even heard her husband call to her that it was a pity that she had not joined them on the lovely boat-ride. Not long thereafter, the community council president‚Ä≤s wife saw the overturned boat and young Johannes‚Ä≤ straw hat on the little lake only a short distance from their destination. Those sparse facts support the presumption that the boy‚Ä≤s hat had fallen into the water. When he leaned over the edge of the boat to try and fetch his hat, some of the men tried to deter him. The boat lost its equilibrium and quickly overturned. That assumption seemed valid, particularly when amended with the fact that five persons simply overloaded such a small rowing boat. Upon learning of the tragedy, Erlenbach Pastor Ludwig Wilhelm Bernhard Huerner (1827-1903) and village schoolmaster [NN] Saegesser immediately hiked up the mountain to the site of the accident. On Monday gunsmith Johann Jakob Rieder II (1823-1875) joined with them to dredge the lake in search of the bodies. While Huerner and Saegesser rowed the boat, Rieder handled the long rope to which a three-pronged hook resembling a small anchor was attached. It was a taxing ordeal for the three of them as they went back and forth over the area which Jakob Tschabold pointed out as being the actual scene of the accident. After a lengthy search, they found one corpse and then another, until the last body was finally recovered on Thursday. On Saturday, 7 August 1869, the Reverend Huerner presided over the moving funeral service in Erlenbach i.S. for the five persons. The pastor personally chiseled the five names on the commemorative gravestone near the entrance of the Erlenbach churchyard. The name of Adele Batzli (1898-1999) ‚Äì a grandniece of Erlenbach Community Council president Johann Gottfried Batzli ‚Äì appears at the bottom of the gravestone below the names of the five persons who drowned. She donated money to keep up the grave in the churchyard and was therefore allowed to also be buried there and have her name added to the marker. The surnames Batzli and Jutzeler were spelled on the commemorative gravestone without the letter \\"t\\" in their names, a variation typical of the local Bernese dialect in the Simmental valley. However, two distinct errors remain inexplicable: ‚Ä¢ The seven-year-old boy who drowned was named Johannes Batzli and not Johann Friedrich (\\"Joh. Frd. \\") as chiseled on the gravestone. Johann Friedrich Batzli Sr., referenced above as \\"a first cousin of the community council president,\\" was the father of the boy. Little Johannes‚Ä≤ elder brother was Johann Friedrich Batzli Jr. (b. 1860). In the Daerstetten Citizens‚Ä≤ Registers he is recorded as having renounced his Swiss citizenship upon becoming naturalized in \\"Jefferson\\" in the USA in 1892. ‚Ä¢ According to the Daerstetten Christening Register (1843‚Äì75), Rudolf Jutzeler‚Ä≤s correct date of birth is 29 March 1853.

Klein, 462 F. Supp. 1131 (D.N.J. 1978), was a case heard in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey in 1978 to decide whether an involuntarily committed mental patient has a constitutional right to refuse psychiatric medication. It was the first case to establish that such a patient has the right to refuse medication in the United States. Circumstances John Rennie, age 38, was a former pilot and flight instructor who was a patient at Ancora Psychiatric Hospital in Winslow Township, New Jersey. His case was brought in December 1977. Rennie's psychiatric history indicates that he did not show signs of mental illness until he was 31. He was first hospitalized in 1973, and subsequently he was discharged and re-admitted many times, primarily, as trial judge Stanley Brotman noted, because of \\"his failure to continue taking medications after he has left the hospital's custody.\\" He had been given various diagnoses over time including paranoid schizophrenia and manic-depressive psychosis. Rennie had persistent religious delusions (he thought he was Christ) and suicidal ideation. His eighth hospitalization was initiated after he threatened to kill President Ford. On subsequent hospitalizations he became increasingly abusive and assaultive. In December 1977, during his twelfth hospitalization that began on August 10, 1976, doctors had unsuccessfully tried various psychiatric medications. Rennie sued in federal district court to prevent the hospital from administering psychotropic medications to him without a clear emergency. His counsel was the Office of the Public Advocate. As Judge Brotman describes in his decision, the precipitating factors occurred earlier in the month when Rennie had become homicidal. Hospital staff felt his condition was deteriorating; to prevent Rennie from harming other patients, staff, and himself, the treatment team administered prolixin decanoate, an injectable long-acting drug, because of his history of failing to take medication once released. They believed the drug would be the easiest drug on which to maintain him after release. Following initiation of the prolixin regime, Rennie's condition did improve markedly. Judge Brotman responded to Rennie's appeal for an injunction by issuing a compromise ruling. Rather than enjoining the hospital from giving him any medication, he insisted that the prolixin be lowered to a minimum maintenance dosage, which staff psychiatrists considered too low. He then conducted fourteen days of hearings between January 13 and April 28, 1978. Several months after issuing his initial ruling that asserted a right to refuse treatment grounded in a constitutional right to privacy, Judge Brotman made the case into a class action that included all involuntarily committed patients at the five mental health facilities operated by the state of New Jersey, and held an additional seventeen days of hearings. Decision An involuntarily committed patient who has not been found incompetent, barring an emergency, has a qualified right to refuse psychotropic medication, especially when forced treatment violates his First Amendment rights to freedom of speech or to practice his religion, or his Eighth Amendment rights to be free of cruel and unusual punishment. New Jersey's administrative policies, which provide for a second psychiatric opinion in the case of refusing patients, must give adequate scope for the exercise of that right to satisfy constitutional requirements. Additionally, due process must be followed in order to forcibly medicate an individual against his will. Judge Brotman's order that the least restrictive alternative concept applied to choice of medications was upheld upon appeal. Significance Before this case, although attention had been focused on involuntary commitment standards, it was assumed that once the patient was hospitalized, hospitals could administer psychoactive medication without consulting either the patient or the family. This was the first case in which the focus shifted from standards of commitment to standards of treatment once hospitalized. This was the first of a series of cases that increasingly acknowledged patient rights to refuse treatment and right to least restrictive treatment by way of a variety of First Amendment rights including freedom of religion and thought as well as the ultimate right to privacy, control over one's own body. However, as this case illustrates, applying the least restrictive principles and working with a patient on medication choices brings up difficult empirical issues in ranking treatment options in accord with constitutional rights.

Released on March 12, 1956, it was the first ever Sindhi language feature film made in Pakistan. Plot The story of Marvi and Umar is a popular Sindhi folk tale, on which the poet Shah Abdul Latif Bhittai based one of the surs of his Risalo. Umar (Syed Hussain Ali Shah Fazlani), king of Umarkot, is looking for a bride but finds none to his liking. Phog (Noor Muhammad Charlie) mentions the unmatchable beauty of Marvi (Nigat Sultana), a village girl from Malir whom he loves but who is engaged to a fellow villager, Khet. Umar decides to check out Marvi for himself and immediately falls under her spell. After unsuccessfully asking for her hand from her father, he resolves to abduct her. Confined in Umar's palace, Marvi stubbornly refuses to become his wife, faithful to her pledge to Khet. Turning down silks and jewelry, she longs for her people, the Marus. When Marvi seems about to surrender, having lost hope of being rescued, a wet-nurse reveals that they are milk siblings, thus ruling out any possibility of marriage between them. Umar then hands Marvi back to her people, but Khet and the Marus suspect her chastity. Upon hearing the news, Umar goes for Malir to defend Marvi's honor. Both have to undergo a trial to prove their innocence by walking through a fire holding a red-hot iron rod. Umar and Marvi come out of the pyre unhurt. In the end, Umar accepts his mistake and blesses Marvi and Khet as they finally marry. Reception and awards The film met with wide popular success both in India and Pakistan. After its release in Pakistan, the rights of the movie were bought by an Indian distributor named T.M. Bihari. Suhail Hashmi and M.

Career  Hull initially intended Manchester Orchestra to be a solo project, with guest appearances by his friends. \\"I was listening to a lot of Morrissey and The Smiths,\\" said Hull, \\"So the city of Manchester really fascinated me, as did the idea of being the leader of an orchestra and having all my friends come in to play.\\" Feeling increasingly alienated at his \\"small-town-Georgia, Christian high school\\" Providence Christian Academy in suburban Atlanta, Hull spent his senior high school year studying at home. He wrote and recorded his first full-length album in 2004 during the same school year. Hull and Manchester Orchestra guitarist Robert McDowell wrote music for the 2016 film Swiss Army Man. Hull also had a cameo in the film.

Scruggs Lodge 372, is a building constructed in 1876 as a Masonic Hall. It is located in downtown Orangeville, Illinois, a small village in Stephenson County. The building, originally built by the local Masonic Lodge, was bought by the locally more numerous Independent Order of Oddfellows fraternal organization in 1893. The building has served all of Orangeville's fraternal organizations for more than 125 years, from the time it was built. The two-story, front gabled building has Italianate architecture elements. It had a rear wing added to it in 1903. By 2003, the first floor has been returned to use as a community center, holding dinner theatre and other community functions, much as the building had originally served the community until first floor space was rented out for commercial use in the late 19th century. The building was listed on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places in 2003. The building is the home of the Mighty Richmond Players Dinner Theatre (MRPDT) dinner theatre which seats 54 persons and has scheduled four different productions for the 2010 season. A $150,000 renovation of the building was recently completed. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places as AF and AM Lodge 687, Orangeville in 2003. Location The building is located in the central business district, along High and Main Streets, of the 800 person village of Orangeville, Illinois, United States. Orangeville is located about two mile (3 km) away from the Illinois-Wisconsin border, in Stephenson County. The Masonic Hall is one lot west of the intersection of High Street and East Street, High Street is the main thoroughfare through downtown Orangeville. The lot, on the south side of West High Street, is east, across the alley from John Bower's house, the Union House. Along with Union House, and the Masonic Hall, four of five sites in Orangeville listed on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places are found on High Street. High Street slopes uphill from the Richland Creek and is populated by historic, 19th century buildings. At the summit of High Street's slope is the Central House, which is another of the High Street structures listed on the National Register. The other listing is the 1926 People's State Bank. Other historic buildings in the approximately three block area include the 1888 Musser Building, and the 1906 Wagner Building.Buford, John C. \\"People's State Bank,\\" (PDF), National Register of Historic Places Nomination Form, 26 February 2004, HAARGIS Database, Illinois Historic Preservation Agency.

Several alterations were made in 1903 including the addition of large rear wing to the building as well as an overhang above the first floor windows along the entire length of the west facade. The building was originally constructed to serve as the meeting hall for the local Ancient Free and Accepted Masons Lodge (AF and AM), but from its opening it has always been utilized by all of Orangeville's fraternal organizations. The AF and AM Lodge 687 of Orangeville built the building at a cost of US$2,500 just four years after the chapter was organized in 1872. The Independent Order of Oddfellows, J.R. Scruggs Lodge 372 (IOOF) had met in the hall since its construction and began to experience and upswing in membership while the AF and AM membership was declining. In 1893 the Masons sold the hall to the IOOF for $1,800, though they continued to rent the building and meet there as they had before. Architecture The two-story front gabled lodge viewed from in front of the People's State Bank The lodge is a two-story front gabled structure which features two rectangular sections. The first, and original section measures and the 1903 addition at the rear measures ; both sections are rectangular.

This event was one of the largest disturbances in the Russian-controlled Congress Poland during the Russian Revolution of 1905. Poland was a major center of revolutionary fighting in the Russian Empire in 1905‚Äì1907, and the ≈Å√≥d≈∫ insurrection was a key incident in those events. For months, workers in ≈Å√≥d≈∫ had been in a state of unrest, with several major strikes having taken place, which were forcibly suppressed by the Russian police and military. The insurrection began spontaneously, without backing from any organized group. Polish revolutionary groups were taken by surprise and did not play a major role in the subsequent events. Around 21‚Äì22 June, following clashes with the authorities in the previous days, angry workers began building barricades and assaulting police and military patrols. Additional troops were called by the authorities, who also declared martial law. On 23 June, no businesses operated in the city, as the police and military stormed dozens of workers' barricades. Eventually, by 25 June, the uprising was crushed, with estimates of several hundred dead and wounded. The uprising was reported in the international press and widely discussed by socialist and communist activists worldwide. Unrest in ≈Å√≥d≈∫ would continue for many months, although without protests on such a large-scale as before. Background Tsardom of Poland, administrative divisions in 1907. ≈Å√≥d≈∫ was in the northern part of the alt=Administrative map of Poland At the beginning of the 20th century, worsening economic conditions contributed to mounting tensions in Russia and Poland: the Russo-Japanese War had damaged the economy of the Kingdom of Poland, and by late 1904, over 100,000 Polish workers had lost their jobs. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, ≈Å√≥d≈∫ had been a major Polish industrial center, heavily urbanized and industrialized, and its large working class made it an important stronghold of the Polish socialist movement. News of the 1905 Russian revolution, together with its revolutionary spirit, spread quickly into Russian-controlled Poland from Saint Petersburg, where demonstrators had been massacred on 22 January. Poland was a major center of revolutionary fighting in the Russian Empire in 1905‚Äì1907, and the ≈Å√≥d≈∫ insurrection was a key incident in those events. Workers in ≈Å√≥d≈∫ had already begun striking sometime before 22 January, and by 31 January the tsarist police were reporting demonstrators carrying placards with slogans such as \\"Down with the autocracy! Down with the war!\\". This was capitalized on by factions in Russia and Poland that wanted more or less radical changes. Soon over 400,000 workers became involved in strikes in Poland. The wing of the Polish Socialist Party (Polska Partia Socjalistyczna, PPS) that was loyal to J√≥zef Pi≈Çsudski believed that Poles should show their determination to regain independence through active, violent protests against the Russians. This view was not shared by Roman Dmowski's National Democratic Party (ND, ) nor by the PPS's own \\"Left\\" (or \\"Young\\") wing. The National Democrats favored cooperation with the Russian authorities, while the PPS Left wanted to work together with Russian revolutionaries to topple the tsardom and saw the creation of a socialist utopia as more important than Polish independence. The Russo-Japanese War had caused rising dissent throughout the Russian Empire, including its Polish provinces. On 26 January 1905 about 6,000 workers in ≈Å√≥d≈∫ took part in a large strike. Next day, a general strike was declared, and the day after that, 70,000 workers were on strike. They demanded an 8-hour work day and support for the sick. Some worker demonstrations were joined by the students, who demanded an end to the policy of Russification. Another large strike occurred during the Labor Day on 1 May. It affected close to half of the city's industry. On 3 May, the anniversary of the Polish May Constitution, another demonstration with patriotic undertones took place. On 30 May, ≈Å√≥d≈∫'s industrialists asked the Russian governor-general for help. The murder of the worker Jerzy Grabczy≈Ñski by Russian Cossack cavalry at the Grohmana is mentioned as one of the sparks of the insurrection. On 18 June 1905, Russian police opened fire on one of the many workers' demonstrations in ≈Å√≥d≈∫, killing approximately ten workers, whose funerals, attended by over 50,000‚Äì70,000 people, escalated into major demonstrations on 20 and 21 June. The funeral on 21 June was met by Cossack cavalry again; the crowd threw stones, and the Russian cavalry returned fire, killing 25 people and wounding hundreds. Social Democracy of the Kingdom of Poland and Lithuania (SDKPiL) called for a general strike on 23 June. Anarchist communist group in ≈Å√≥d≈∫ in 1906.alt=see caption Pi≈Çsudski's PPS, while not planning for a major uprising then and there, had a policy of supporting the protest and harassing Russian forces. The PPS, as well as other socialist organizations, such as Jewish Bund and SDKPiL, were as surprised by the scale of the spontaneous revolt as the Russian authorities; PPS forces in ≈Å√≥d≈∫ consisted of 10 regular and armed PPS members and a few dozen semi-enlisted workers. A larger group sent from Warsaw under Walery S≈Çawek never made it in time to take control or affect the uprising; it was, in the end, an anarchic and unorganized violent protest against the Russian government. Uprising Tensions mounted further, and in the evening of 21 or 22 June (sources vary), angry workers began building barricades and assaulting police and military patrols, killing those who did not surrender. About a hundred barricades were constructed over the course of the next few days. Around Wschodnia Street, workers opened fire on a company of soldiers and cavalry, and on Po≈Çudniowa street, a unit of gendarmes was surrounded. Several fires begun in the town, as workers set liquor stores on fire, and the government forces assaulted the first barricades, initially without much success. The tsarist representatives called from reinforcements, which came from Czƒôstochowa, Warsaw, and summer training camps. Several infantry regiments entered the city. Eventually, Russian forces sent to suppress the workers numbered six infantry regiments and several cavalry regiments. Despite that, the situation was spiralling into a full blown uprising. On 23 June, all industries, workshops, shops and offices were closed, as the workers and government forces clashed. Some of the heaviest fighting took place near the intersection of Wschodnia and Po≈Çudniowa (now Rewolucji 1905 r.) streets (where four barricades were located), near the Scheibler factory in the ≈πr√≥dliska park and on the Rokociny road (al. Pi≈Çsudskiego). The Rokociny area was manned by a 3,000-strong worker militia, which eventually was forced to retreat to the ≈πr√≥dliska park. The insurgents had no organized agenda, and commonly fought under red standards; common demands were the improvement of workers' living conditions and greater rights for the Polish population. On 23 June (or as late as 26 June ‚Äì sources vary) the Tsar signed a decree of martial law in the city. The PPS-supported worker factions found themselves facing not only Russian police and regular troops, but endecja militia. Armed clashes broke out between gunmen loyal to Pi≈Çsudski's PPS and those loyal to Dmowski. Over the course of the \\"June Days\\", as the ≈Å√≥d≈∫ uprising became known in Poland, a miniature civil war raged between Pi≈Çsudski's PPS and Dmowski's endeks. The insurgents were poorly armed, and eventually were overwhelmed by the tsarist regular military. Most of the barricades fell by 24 June; the last of the barricades (in the ≈πr√≥dliska park and Wschodnia street) were captured by Russian troops by the end of 24 June or by midday on 25 June (sources vary), but unrest‚Äîincluding occasional shots at police or military patrols‚Äîwould continue for days afterwards. Aftermath Monument to the PPS fighters who died in the fighting in the years 1905‚Äì1907 at the alt=see caption The uprising was ultimately crushed by the Russian authorities. Official reports indicated 151 civilian deaths (55 Poles, 79 Jews and 17 Germans) and 150 wounded; unofficial reports spoke of over 200 fatalities and between 800 and as many as 2,000 wounded. The ≈Å√≥d≈∫ uprising was neither the first nor the last disturbance in what has been described in Polish historiography as the revolution in the Kingdom of Poland (1905‚Äì1907)‚Äîvarious protests and strikes occurred in major Polish cities under Russian control throughout the year‚Äîbut it would be the most dramatic one. In September 1905, two PPS activists would assassinate Juliusz Karol Kunitzer, owner of the Heinzel & Kunitzer factory, known for his poor treatment of workers. Strikes in ≈Å√≥d≈∫ continued until mid-1906, when the large Russian military presence and mass layoffs of striking workers from the factories finally pacified the city. Even afterward, ≈Å√≥d≈∫ was not a peaceful city; in the years 1910‚Äì1914 it was the site of a radical, anarchist and socialist group Rewolucyjni M≈õciciele labeled as \\"the most extreme, terrorist group in the history of Poland\\". The uprising was reported in the international press and recognized by socialist and communist activists worldwide. Notes References Further reading * Blobaum, Robert.

She also likes both sports Judo and Sumo. Unlike the other characters, Ramurin's mentality is much higher than the rest of the main cast and usually behaves like a responsible sister. Her catch phrase is \\"suspicious\\" and usually keeps her promises sometimes. Like Mimirin, she doesn't have any older sibling. She officially left Challenge Island along with her father during the last episode of Shimajir≈ç Hesoka, and moved to France to achieve her goals. As a result, she is the only character who does not appear in any of the movies. ; / Nikki \\\\- See \\"Story\\" section, part 5/7 : First introduced in Shimajir≈ç: A World of Wow!, Nikki is a pink- furred cat with a cream-colored face.

The structure was erected in 1926 when two Orangeville banks merged to form the People's State Bank. It operated until 1932 when it became overwhelmed by an economic disaster caused by the Great Depression and the bypassing of downtown Orangeville by an important route. The building is cast in the Commercial style and features Classical Revival detailing, common for banks of the time period. The building was added to the U.S. National Register of Historic Places in 2004. Location The People's State Bank is located in the 800 person village of Orangeville, about two miles (3 km) from the Illinois-Wisconsin border in Stephenson County, Illinois. The building is located in the primary business district, along High and Main Streets, in downtown Orangeville. High Street slopes uphill from the Richland Creek and is populated by historic, 19th century buildings. At the summit of High Street's slope is the Central House, which is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. In total, four of the five structures on the National Register in Orangeville, are found along High Street; the Union House and the Orangeville Masonic Hall are the other two. Other historic buildings in the approximately three block area include the 1888 Musser Building, and the 1906 Wagner Building. History The People's State Bank building was constructed in 1926 when the two of the three state banks in Orangeville merged. The area had enjoyed success as a commercial hub in the years preceding the bank's construction. In 1928, just before the onset of the Great Depression, Illinois State Highway 74 (later Illinois Route 26) was rerouted through the eastern part of Orangeville, bypassing the downtown business district. Though the district no longer had a major thoroughfare passing through it many of the business were able to survive, at least initially. By 1928 the decline in the business community of Orangeville was evident; the bypass, coupled with the depression continued to negatively affect the village. In 1932 the People's State Bank, the last open bank in Orangeville, closed its doors. The American Legion Post #720 bought the bank building after its closure and it served as the American Legion Meeting Hall until 1956. A group of local residents purchased the building in 1956 with the intention of restarting a bank in Orangeville. Until 1980, the People's State Bank building once again operated as a financial institution under the name Orangeville Community Bank. A radio repair and sales business bought the structure in 1980 and held it until the business closed, leaving the premises vacant, in August 2002. An organization called A Community Together bought the bank from the radio business and in turn sold it to John and Caryl Buford in October 2003. Architecture The semi-circular fanlight windows and the brick divides, which resemble pilasters, are among the Classical Revival details in the building. The People's State Bank was cast in the commercial style of architecture and has detailing heavily influenced by Classical Revival, a popular style for bank buildings at the time. The building, a one- story structure, stands on a concrete foundation with 12 inch (30 cm) thick walls, and a full basement. The Classical detailing is emphasized through the use of brick, glass, and concrete throughout the building. The simple design exhibits several Classical Revival influences, among them: its masonry construction, giving it a sturdy appearance, its symmetry, the brick divides on the wall which resemble pilasters, and the semi circular fanlights on the above the east and west facade windows. The size of the interior lobby further emphasized the feeling of solidity, which banks wished to convey to their customers. The 30 foot (9 m) by 64 foot (20 m) rectangular building is composed of brick and features terrazzo flooring. The building is the most ornate of the commercial buildings in downtown Orangeville and is situated on the area's second highest lot. The main entrance, a large wooden, glass paneled door, is recessed and central on the symmetrical south (front) facade of the building. The original door is surrounded by sidelights and topped by a diamond patterned transom window. Flanking the central doorway on each side is a one over one window, each displaying the same diamond patterned transoms as the door.Buford, John C. \\"People's State Bank,\\" (PDF), National Register of Historic Places Nomination Form, 26 February 2004, HAARGIS Database, Illinois Historic Preservation Agency. Retrieved 9 October 2007. Significance The People's State Bank was the last major commercial building constructed in historic downtown Orangeville, Illinois. Prior to World War II Classical architecture was popular in commercial and civic buildings and the People's State Bank provides an example of a one-story, stand alone commercial style block building adorned with Classical details. For its architectural significance the People's State Bank building was listed on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places on August 20, 2004.

History The People's State Bank, next door to the Central House. Central House was constructed in 1888, by John Hoyman, the son in law of town founder John Bower. John Bower had initially built a hotel at the same site in 1867, but it burned to the ground in 1887. It was the first brick commercial building, and the second brick building to be built in Orangeville. From the time it was constructed, until the 1930s, Central House operated as a hotel. During the 1930s the building was converted for use as a single-family residence, a function it retains at present. Though Central House has undergone multiple periods of renovations and alterations it still maintains its historic integrity. When the new hotel was built in 1888, the hotel affixed a large wooden sign adorned with \\"Central House\\" to the front facade; the original was removed during the 1920s. Before the turn of the 20th century the building's partial basement was added on. The home underwent several changes in 1911. They included: the addition of indoor plumbing, the construction of a utility room at the structure's rear, the construction of a separate kitchen building, and the removal of an attached shed on the west facade. Central House did not have electricity until 1920. The kitchen was moved to the main building during the 1940s, and between 1950 and 1952 the second floor balcony was removed. The heating system evolved from potbelly stoves to a radiator hot water system in the 1920s, and during the 1960s gas heaters replaced that system. Architecture The original sign was removed during the 1920s and the original balcony removed in the 1950s. The building stands three stories, and features a partial basement and twenty rooms. Ten of the rooms were specifically designed as bedrooms. The brick building sits on a stone foundation and is cast in a mid-19th-century Italianate style. The hotel building itself features arched segmented one over one windows on all facades and floors. The wooden-framed windows are either all original or could be restored to original appearance. The windows have shallow hood moldings made of soft brick and are all double hung. The original porch and balcony, removed for reasons unknown during the 1950s, measured 18 feet (5.5 m) across and 10 feet (3 m) deep. The property of the Central House has one outbuilding, a five-bay garage that dates to around the 1910s. The garage has had one roof replacement but maintains its historic integrity. Significance Central House is commercially significant for its role as a meeting place for citizens of Orangeville and travelers alike. It provided lodging and dining facilities for more than 60 years, and its construction was with the intention of being the central commercial building in Orangeville. The building remains one of the oldest surviving buildings in Orangeville and is the village's only hotel in its history. It is also the only three-story building within the Orangeville central business district. For its local significance in the area of architecture the building was added to the U.S. National Register of Historic Places on May 20, 1999.

(known to the locals as Madisonville). Madison Twp (Madisonville) formed on Aug. 7, 1849 from parts of Covington and Jefferson Townships and is named after President James Madison. Located on most printed maps about Northeast of Madisonville corners, Quicktown is centered at Quicktown Corners, the intersection of Quicktown Road and Rt. 690 in Madison Township. This intersection was previously known as Carey's Corners after the Carey family that lived near the intersection. The Carey family no longer resides in the area, but was still present up until at least 1930 according to that census. Quicktown is named after the Quick family that lived in the area, but there are no records of Quicks that actually resided in Madison township in the census records other than Matilda Quick, a school teacher boarding with George Weldy in 1880. Rather the records show that the family and descendants of Daniel Thomas Quick (1824‚Äì1911) and Almira J Pedrick Quick living just across the county line in Hollisterville, part of Salem Township, Wayne County. Daniel came from Pike County near Milford and first appeared in Salem in the 1860 census. Daniel's son used the address of Hollisterville on his World War I draft registration. Aerial Picture of Quicktown, Autumn 2006 History and Settlers History and Directory of Newton and Ransom Townships, Lackawanna County, Pennsylvania, 1754 - 1912, compiled by J. B. Stephens, 1912 name the original settlers in what would become Madison Township as Thomas Biesecker and Richard Edwards both arriving in 1825. Horace Hollister names \\"John Besecker\\" (not Thomas) and Richard Edwards among the original settlers in Drinker's Beech in History of the Lackawanna Valley, (p. 288). Census records support Hollister's claim that it was John Biesecker and Richard Edwards. There is no census entry for any Thomas Biesecker in Luzerne County (before the formation of Lackawanna County), but John Biesecker is in Lower Mount Bethel, Northampton County in the 1820 census and in Covington in the 1830 census. However, neither of these original settlers lived in the area considered Quicktown. The first settler in the Quicktown area is unknown. It was likely Alfred Wilcox, Benjamin Pedrick or Benjamin Parker Carey (1819‚Äì1873). Alfred Wilcox and Benjamin Pedrick both appear in the 1840 census in Jefferson (before Madison Township was formed). Both lived in or near Quicktown in 1850 and both appear on the 1873 Madison map (see below). Wilcox lived about where I-84 now passes under Rt. 690. Pedrick lived about where Flip's Market is now located. Benjamin Pedrick is also the father of Almira Pedrick, the wife of Daniel Quick (mentioned above). According to the article, \\"The Settlers of Drinker's Beech\\" by G. Ellis Miller, Benjamin Parker Carey (or Cary), a carpenter and the son of Minor Carey and Sarah Robinson of Old Providence Township, was the first settler at Carey's Corner. He settled there sometime between 1840 and 1850. His home was at the Southern corner of Quicktown Corners. According to family records and census data, John Biesecker's son in law, Peter Alt (1797 - 1891), born in Bavaria, was also an early settler in Quicktown. The Alts moved from Salem, PA to Quicktown in 1847, buying a farm from Balser Fetherman. Records suggest that the Fethermans never lived on this property. The Swartz family was certainly one of the earliest families to settle Quicktown, although the original Swartzes in Madisonville, George and Jacob, seem to have settled in parts of Madisonville that are outside what is usually considered Quicktown. By 1850, census records show the Alt, Dings, Hornbaker, Pedrick, Swartz, Wilcox families in the area. Of these, only the Pedrick and Wilcox families appear in Jefferson in the 1840 census, but a section is missing that includes the name of one family. In 1861, Peter Alt sold his property to Joseph and Esther Ellis Mead and moved to Wisconsin. Joseph Mead (1804 -1880) was born in NY, the son of Selah Mead and Tamar Griffen. Esther Ellis (1819 - 1895) was born in Connecticut, the daughter of Isaac S. Ellis and Sarah Ann Pepper. Joseph had been a farmer in Providence, PA prior to buying their farm in Quicktown. The farm is still in the possession of Joseph Mead's descendants. Peter Alt's son, John Alt, a Civil War veteran, married Sarah Ann Clouse and settled at Carey's Corner where he worked as a blacksmith. Many of their descendants still reside in Quicktown. Floyd Smith bought property in Quicktown from the Quick family, according to local word-of-mouth. Perhaps Almira Pedrick-Quick inherited the property from her parents which would explain how Quicks came to own this property. Today this farm is owned by the Thomas family, descendants of Floyd Smith. In 1873 \\"The Corners\\" had Madisonville Hall, located about where Yonk Mead's former garage stands and John Alt's blacksmith shop across the road. Later, Billy Fuegline built and operated a small one room store at Quicktown Corners. Eventually it was run by Durward \\"Huck\\" and Mary June (Alt) Field.

It is not to be confused with other Chinese opera genres popular in Shanghai, especially Yue opera. Unlike most forms of Chinese opera, Shanghai operas are typically set in the modern era, especially the Republican period. Huju is particularly popular in Baihe, the oldest town in the Qingpu District of Shanghai. There are eight to ten huju ensembles in the Baihe, and many local residents hire these ensembles to perform for weddings and funerals. Huju is accompanied by traditional Chinese instruments, including dizi (transverse bamboo flute), erhu (two- stringed fiddle), pipa (pear-shaped lute), yangqin (hammered dulcimer), and percussion. The instrumentation and style are closely related to the instrumental genre of Jiangnan sizhu. The well-known Chinese composition \\"Purple Bamboo Melody\\" () has been adapted and used for huju.  History  The Shanghai opera is rooted in the folksongs of the Huangpu River area. According to historical records from 1796, there was more than 200 years of cultural development from the original Huaguxi operas before the emergence of contemporary Shanghai opera. During the rule of the Qianlong emperor of the Qing dynasty, Huaguxi was very popular in Shanghai. Influenced by Huaguxi and other forms of drama during the reign of the Guangxu emperor of Qing dynasty, these folksongs developed into Tanhuang (Êª©Á∞ß). In order to distinguish them from Sutan and Nibo Tanhuang, Shanghainese people called them \\"bentan\\" (Êú¨Êª©) or \\"shentan\\" (Áî≥Êª©). Performance of shentan began in Shanghai around the 1900s. Before and after the revolution of 1911, shentan were performed in various venues across Shanghai. In 1914, Wenbin shao (ÈÇµÊñáÊª®), Lanting Shi (ÊñΩÂÖ∞‰∫≠), and Shaolan Ding (‰∏ÅÂ∞ëÂÖ∞) organized \\"zhenxinji \\" to improve bentan. It was then renamed \\"shenqu \\" (Áî≥Êõ≤). In 1941, Shanghai Huju She was founded in Shanghai. It was an ensemble that consisted of several opera performers. They renamed shenqu as Huju. During this period, Huju became a more concrete art form. During the 1950s and 1960s, Huju adapted many modern plays. It adopted divisions of acts and recognized the role of the playwright and director at a much earlier time than other similar art forms. Red Lantern and Shajiabang‚Äîthe most influential Jingju (Peking opera) plays among the eight model plays created during the Cultural Revolution‚Äîwere both adapted from Huju plays. Shanghai opera legend Mao Shanyu in 2019  Characteristics  Huju is performed in Shanghainese, a dialect that is considerably different from Mandarin. Translators are often available at the venues where these are performed. The pieces tend to reflect certain aspects of real life because they derive from folk songs. Performances of the early Huju only needed two performers: one played a musical instrument and the other told contemporary stories. Huju also adopted many elements of movies and dramas in lighting, expression, and stage designs. Through Huju, people can gain a better knowledge of the life and history of Shanghai people.  Future prospects  Like many other regional opera styles, Huju is in danger of disappearing. Wu dialect, which pertains to Shanghai, is not currently popular with local audiences. Performances of Huju are decreasing, and few young actors take up this art form when television and film have more popularity and influence. Meanwhile, lack of good Huju scripts is also a problem for the survival of Huju. References *Stock, Jonathan P. J. (2003). Huju: Traditional Opera in Modern Shanghai. OUP/British Academy. . .

He was chaplain and librarian to the Marchioness of Buckingham and catalogued many manuscripts, including the famous Stowe Missal, now in the Royal Irish Academy. His grandfather was the historian Charles O'Connor, his brother the historian Matthew O'Conor. Description :O‚ÄôConor was a man of mild and timid disposition, liked by every one who knew him, and possessing extensive historical and ‚Äòbookish‚Äô information. In appearance he was short and slight, of sallow complexion, with prominent but distinguished looking features, giving him as age advanced a most vulnerable appearance. His manners were a curious compound of Irish and Italian. He was known locally as ‚Äòthe Abb√©,‚Äô and was for many years daily to be seen walking between Stowe and Buckingham, with his book and gold-headed cane, reading as he walked. Life Charles O'Conor was educated in Ludovisi College, Rome from 1779‚Äì91 and was appointed parish priest of Kilkeevin, County Roscommon (1792‚Äì98). In 1796 he published a memoir of his grandfather, the historian Charles O'Connor which he later suppressed.Charles O‚ÄôConor : Librarian at Stowe In 1798 he was invited to become chaplain to Mary Nugent, the Marchioness of Buckingham and to organize and translate a collection of Gaelic manuscripts at Stowe. With him he brought papers of his grandfather to Stowe, including fifty-nine Gaelic manuscripts. In Stowe O'Conor wrote Columbanus ad Hibernos (1810‚Äì13),a series of letters supporting the royal veto on Catholic episcopal appointments in Ireland. These were answered by Francis Plowden and saw him suspended from duties of parish priest by John Troy, Archbishop of Dublin. In his duties as librarian he edited the Four Masters, and other chronicles from the Stowe Library as Rerum Hibernicarum Scriptores Veteres (1814‚Äì26), an edition regarded as unreliable.Charles O‚ÄôConor : Librarian at Stowe RICORSO: see O‚ÄôConor, Charles in Authors A-Z Connor experienced mental illness.

The house, the first brick home in Orangeville, was built in 1849 by village founder John Bower. It was purchased by Samuel Hutchins in 1885 and it remained in the Hutchins family until 1951. The house blends elements of Greek and Gothic Revival architecture and is the only example of Gothic Revival found in the village of Orangeville. The house was added to the U.S. National Register of Historic Places in 2000. History The Union House was the first brick house in Orangeville and erected by village founder John Bower. Bower came to Stephenson County in 1844 and, on October 16, 1846, bought the land that would be platted as Orangeville from John H. Curtis for US$950. Bowers built the Union House in 1849 on a portion of what eventually became Orangeville in 1851. By 1885 Dr. Samuel Hutchins, and his wife Amanda, owned the Union House and used it as a home and a medical office for Hutchins early in his career. William Hutchins inherited the home and lived in it until he died in 1926. His sister Katherine Hutchins took ownership of the building following William's death. When Katherine died in 1944 her mother Linda inherited the house and it was deeded to Robert and Florence Shafer in 1951. The Shafers in turn sold it to Val and Opel Schreiner. The Schreiner's owned the house when it was nominated to the U.S. National Register of Historic Places in 2000.Buford, John C. \\"Union House,\\" (PDF), National Register of Historic Places Nomination Form, 29 November 1999, HAARGIS Database, Illinois Historic Preservation Agency. Retrieved 9 October 2007. Architecture The Union House is an example of the center gabled variety of Gothic Revival. The Union House utilizes a combination of Greek Revival and Gothic Revival styles. The Greek Revival influence is found in the doorway, which matches almost exactly the description put forth by Virginia and Lee McAlester in their 1984 book, A Field Guide to American Houses. The McAlester description for Greek Revival doorways mentions, elaborate door surrounds flanked by decorative glass sidelights and topped by fanlights, and ornate wood or masonry encasements surrounding the door.McAlester, Virginia & Lee. A Field Guide to American Houses, Alfred A. Knopf, Inc, New York: 1984, p. 180, 197, (). The Union House features these characteristics, though does not feature the recessed doorway the McAlesters call \\"not uncommonly\\" found in Greek Revival doorways. Besides the front entrance, the house is cast in the Gothic Revival style, popularized in the United States through various publications from the late 1830s-1850s. The Union House matches descriptions put forth by McAlester as well as in the Galena Historic Preservation Guidebook. McAlester describes decorative bargeboards, steeply pitched gables, and cross gables, with windows usually extending into the gables; all elements which are present on the Union House. The pointed arch windows described by McAlester are not present on the Union House. The Union House is of the centered gable variety described by McAlester. The Galena guidebook also describes steeply pitched roofs, cross gables and decorative bargeboarding. The original decorative bargeboarding on the Union House remains in place. Significance The Union House, along with being the first brick house built in Orangeville, is the only example of Gothic Revival architecture found in the village. It is important locally because it was constructed by the village founder, John Bower. The house is also a good example of the crossover from Greek to Gothic Revival and blends elements from both style. The house's local significance, combined with its architectural importance qualified it for listing on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places on May 11, 2000.

It belongs to the Wartberg culture of the Central European Later Neolithic. It is of special importance in Central European prehistory because of the sequence of collective burial layers contained within it. Location The tomb, or gallery grave, is located on a slight rise near the village of Niedertiefenbach, about 2 km north of the river Lahn. Visible from the tomb is the hill of Steeden which bore a prehistoric R√∂ssen culture settlement and contained at least two caves with prehistoric activity. The Steeden sites have all been destroyed by quarrying.Jockenh√∂vel 1990, 324, fig. 128 Similarly, no trace of the tomb is visible in situ. Date The tomb belongs to the Hessian-Westphalian stone cist group (Hessisch-Westf√§lische Steinkistengruppe), which is part of the Wartberg culture. It dates to before 3000 BC but was in use for several generations, straddling the 4th and 3rd millennia.Raetzel-Fabian 2000, 119 Discovery and excavation The site was first noticed and identified as a prehistoric monument by K. Rossel in 1859. In 1874, the southern part of the monument was blown up, probably because it was inconvenient for agriculture. Much human bone material was removed at that time. The tomb was rediscovered by H. Wurm in 1961, and excavated in the same year by H. Schoppa.Jockenh√∂vel 1990, 324 Tomb architecture Despite the late 19th century damage, the overall size of the tomb can be estimated at 10 by 3.2 m (outside measurements). Unusually among the Wartberg tombs, it was oriented north‚Äìsouth. The tomb was built of unworked limestone slabs (0.3 to 0.8 m thick) from Steeden (2 km to the south). The relatively large gaps between the slabs were filled with drystone walling (a feature well known from gallery graves elsewhere in Europe, but not familiar within the Lahn and Kassel basin groups of tombs). Its height can be determined, as the tops of the orthostaths had not been destroyed by ploughing; it was low, at 0.8 to 0.88 m.Wurm et al., 51 In 1859, one slab remained of the ceiling. It is not clear whether the ceiling was entirely of stone, or a mixture of stone, wood and other materials. It is similarly unclear whether it was built in a pit (like its counterparts in the general region) and whether it was once covered by a mound. Tomb interior The final 2.7 m of the chamber, near the north end, is set off as a separate compartment by two vertically set slabs, leaving a 60 cm gap in the middle. The chamber formed by these slabs had two unconnected areas of cobbled floor, one of larger slabs in the west, and one of rubble in the east. Two postholes set in front of the back wall might indicate internal supports for a ceiling.Wurm et al. 1963, 55 The state of the skeletons recovered, all of them inarticulate or only partially articulate, placed in a sequence of distinct layers, indicates that the dead were either allowed to decay partially outside the tomb (excarnation), or that their remains were reorganised after partial or complete decomposition within the tomb. It is doubtful whether the bodies entered the tomb through its entrance, as the uppermost levels of burials are only 30 cm under the top of the orthostaths.Wurm et al. 1963, 62 The same doubt has been raised on different grounds, namely the narrow Seelenloch entrances, at Z√ºschen, Lohra and Altendorf. Sequence Careful excavation in the undestroyed part of the tomb revealed ten discernible layers of burials (numbered 1‚Äì10 in the order of discovery from the top down, i.e. the reverse to the order of deposition), most of them consisting of disarticulate, often sorted, groups of bones. The ten layers could be grouped in three phases.Wurm et al. 1963, 61 Phase 1 (layers 10‚Äì7):Wurm et al. 1963, 59-60 Layer 10a, on the floor of the chamber, included a pyramid of bones (six skulls mixed with short and long bones, including the near-complete skeleton of a child), as well as a pair of legs lying parallel to the chamber. Layer 10 had two articulated skeletons, lying on their back with their arms crossed on the chest, at right angles to the chamber. Layer 9 consisted of several caches of longbones, mostly parallel to the chamber, and the bottom halves of three articulated skeletons at right angles to the chamber. Layer 8 contained three badly preserved, but articulate, skeletons, this time parallel to the chamber, again with the arms crossed over the body. Layer 7 had inarticulate bone remains mixed with many stones; it was separated from layer 6 above it by a deposit of earth. It included a skull accompanied by a flint knife. Phase 2 (layers 6‚Äì3):Wurm et al. 1963, 60-61 Layer 6 was also quite mixed, but had a grouping of long bones in the north, a nest of five skulls and a copper spiral further south, as well as individual skull set off by a stone setting. Also in layer 6, a row of skulls running across the chamber near the partition wall was started, which contained through 5 and 4a. Layers 5 and 4 appear to follow a different pattern from previous practice. Apart from the above-mentioned row, skulls are mainly placed along the west, bones to the east, long bones in the north and parallel to the chamber. Most of the copper and amber finds were from these layers. They were covered with a paving-like deposit of large carefully placed limestone slabs. Phase 3 (layers 2‚Äì1): Layer 2, on top of the limestone slabs, contained three skulls and two partially articulated lower bodies, parallel to the chamber, as well as some long bones. Layer 1, the top of the burial deposit, had a mixture of short and long bones spread all over the excavated area, as well as more than fifteen skulls. Anthropology An anthrolopological study of the remains was undertaken. The minimum numbers calculated from the 1961 material reflect only part of the original deposit, as the 19th century disturbance probably removed much of the originally present bone materials.This section is based on Wurm et al. 1963, 75-8 No complete skeletons were found, but the bones encountered were quite well preserved. On the basis of the thighbones, there were 60 male adults, 53 female adults, 11 youths over 14, 10 children over 7, 29 children under 7 and 14 further individuals of undeterminable age; i.e. a total of 177. The males had an average height of 1.68 m, the females of 1.53 m. One adult, and one young child, displayed signs of violent injury with a tool. Finds =Pottery= Virtually no pottery was found. =Stone tools= Two flint arrowheads and a scraper were found on the bottom of the tomb, and a further flint knife in layer 7. The tomb also contained some flint chippings. =Bone= The amount of animal bone found was unusually low. There were fifteen bones and three teeth of cattle, one dog or wolf bone and two unidentified animal bones.Wurm et al. 1963, 67 Ten dog canines, two dog mandibles and two animal bones carved to look like dog (or wolf) teeth are comparable to finds from other Wartberg tombs and might have a totemic or talismanic significance.Wurm et al. 1963, 66 A pierced fossilised seashell was also found. =Amber= 21 amber beads were found, virtually all of them from phase 2.Wurm et al 1963, 66 Amber is not locally available and was probably imported from the Baltic. =Metal= While poor in other finds, the tomb was remarkably rich in metal, especially copper. Six copper spirals were found, one from phase 1, the rest from phase 2.Wurm et al. 1963, 69 They are among the earliest metal finds in that part of Europe.H.-E. Mandera 1972:Die Vorgeschichte Nassaus von der √§lteren Steinzeit bis zur Urnenfelderzeit, in: K. Wurm, H.-E. Mandera, H.-E., E. Pachali & H. Schoppa: Vorgeschichte und R√∂mische Zeit zwischen Main und Lahn, Bonn: Rudolf Habelt., 24-50; p. 35 The presence of several copper ornaments probably places phases 2 and 3 of the Niedertiefenbach tomb, but not necessarily its erection, in late Wartberg, after 3000 BC. Genetics examined the remains of 42 people of the Wartberg culture buried at Niedertiefenbach c. 3300-3200 BC. They were determined to be of about 60% Early European Farmer (EEF) and 40% Western Hunter-Gatherer (WHG) ancestry. The predominance of the single Y-DNA lineage indicated that the people buried at Niedertiefenbach belonged to a patrilineal society.

History  The ability to utilise the Royal Mail network in this way (analogous to local loop unbundling in the telecoms sector) was first introduced in 2003, ending a 350-year monopoly. At first, there were strict limits, restricting DSA to large operations, however over time these have been relaxed further. With the final abolition of the Royal Mail monopoly (but not its universal service obligation), DSA mail makes up an ever-increasing proportion of mail received in the UK. However 99.8 percent of the mail delivered is delivered to Royal Mail to deliver for these third party suppliers. Government attempts to show competition in the postal sector have not created competition as such, but Royal Mail has lost some of the easier and more profitable section of its business. The Postal Services Commission restricts the prices at which Royal Mail sell this downstream access to third party companies.  Future developments  Increasingly, large mailers (banks etc.) are looking to work with or sidestep the DSA providers, and obtain direct access (Customer Direct Access) to Royal Mail delivery themselves. With the end of the monopoly, some DSA providers are moving into the delivery market in major conurbations. Such bypass mail never touches the Royal Mail network. Another innovation is the emergence from DSA providers of so-called Hybrid mail services, which take electronic documents, produce real mailpieces & deliver them to their final destination. DSA Providers in the UK: * Citipost * Whistl (both DSA and hybrid mail provider) * MiPost (both DSA and hybrid mail provider) * The Delivery Group (which includes Secured Mail and ONEPOST) * UK Mail (part of DHL) * DX Network Services * ONEPOST * Northern Mail (both DSA and hybrid mail provider) * FDM PLC (both DSA and hybrid mail provider) * Swiss Post Solutions (both DSA and hybrid mail provider)  References  Category:Royal Mail Citipost Mail ","title":"Downstream access"},{"id":"13650954","text":"\\"Anywhere but Here\\" is the tenth issue of the Buffy the Vampire Slayer Season Eight series of comic books, a continuation from the television series of the same name. It is written by Joss Whedon. Plot Threatened by Twilight's rising, Willow and Buffy fly under Willow's magical power to question a demon named Sephrilian (one of the Old Ones) about the matter. During their flight, they play a game called \\"Anywhere But Here\\" in which they detail their personal fantasies. When Buffy questions Willow about Kennedy's whereabouts, Willow avoids the question just as they finally arrive at the lair that resembles an old cottage. They are greeted by Robin, a Minder, who stabilizes reality around the hut, which is made unstable by the presence of Sephrilian. She warns Willow not to use magic inside and informs Buffy to \\"rescue the prince,\\" much to their confusion. The two enter the lair and find themselves set on a never ending staircase. At the castle, Xander surprises the giant- sized Dawn with a gift: her trunk full of clothes and articles enlarged to fit her. Amongst her possessions, Xander comes across a picture of regular-sized Dawn with her ex-boyfriend Kenny. Dawn finally reveals to Xander that she never slept with Kenny like she had informed everyone. She had in fact slept with his college roommate. Xander comforts her saying that she's only guilty of being human. He asks if she feels better getting it off her chest. She doesn't respond. Buffy and Willow meet Sephrilian, a demon that has the ability to walk between worlds, in order to determine what Twilight signifies. Sephrilian replies: \\"The death of magic;\\" he claims that their fear is \\"sickeningly sweet,\\" as Twilight represents the triumph of humans over demons, the end of the Hellmouths, and that this will be Buffy's life's work achieved. Sephrilian grows impatient with the human natural propensity to lie and hide from reality, and decides to send Buffy and Willow through a series of visions revealing past and future events. In the first vision, Buffy and Willow find themselves looking on as Buffy and other Slayers rob a Swiss Bank Account for their personal funds, several months ago. Willow explains to Buffy that this is what the government feared: Slayers acting above the law. As a result of Buffy's desire to see the bad things Willow has done, a brief scene from the past reveals Willow intimately involved with a NƒÅga-like snake woman that granted her mystical knowledge. Afterward, they are joined by an image of Robin in a new setting: Buffy on the floor of a foggy stone room, beaten, cut, and crying. Robin says she didn't expect Sephrilian to show them this, and explains that the scene shows a betrayal by \\"the closest and most unexpected.\\" She senses that Buffy and Willow are about to cause a disruption and leaves. When Buffy asks Willow if Willow is the betrayer, she gives an evasive answer that is supplemented by a vision where Willow and Kennedy were arguing and Willow eventually confessed that she blames herself for Tara's death and Sunnydale's deterioration. Willow explained that while she and Tara could have left Sunnydale and lived happily, she could not bring herself to either let Buffy stay dead or desert her after her resurrection. She is determined to avoid the same thing happening to Kennedy. Buffy witnesses the revelation in disbelief. Suddenly, Sephrilian returns and informs them that he welcomes the upcoming war, saying he now knows their weaknesses and that he plans to tell the rest of the demon world. Buffy attacks, and Willow conjures her a magical sword to quickly defeat the demon, but because she performed magic the lair explodes as the unstable reality field around it collapses. However, Robin contains the blast and magically rebuilds the hut within seconds. She thanks them for killing Sephrilian and giving her a temporary reprieve from her duties, and asks what happened in there. Buffy explains \\"It was demons. Playing games,\\" and she and Willow walk away in silence. Production =Writing and artwork= Joss Whedon returns as writer for the first time since \\"The Chain\\". Cliff Richards joins the team as penciller, replacing the series' regular Georges Jeanty for this issue. Although this is Richard's first issue penciling for Buffy Season Eight, he has previously worked on past Buffy comics including \\"Slayer, Interrupted\\", \\"Play with Fire\\", and \\"Jonathan\\". \\"Anywhere but Here\\" is 25 pages as opposed to its usual 22, as stated in the letters column of issue 9. =Dark Horse contest= Dark Horse Comics held a contest for one reader to be given a cameo shot in Buffy. The winner was Robin Balzer, who had an entry written on her behalf by her husband, Jerrod. The essay was the couple watching Buffy and sharing it together at the beginning of the onset of Robin's schizophrenia. Upon reading the winner's entry, Whedon decided to expand that character's role and feature her as a critical part of the story, as opposed to a simple cameo. She appears in this issue as well as on the variant cover with Buffy and Willow. Canonical issues This series has been described as 'canon' by both Whedon and various commentators. As the creator of Buffy, Joss Whedon's association with Buffyverse story is often linked to how canonical the various stories are. Since Whedon is writing this story, it will be seen as a continuation of the official continuity established by Buffy and Angel. Season Eight contradicts and supersedes information given in the paperback novels set after Season Seven, such as Queen of the Slayers and Dark Congress, which are described as being set in an unofficial \\"parallel\\" continuity.Mata, Shiai, \\"CHRISTOPHER GOLDEN INTERVIEW 2 \\", SlayerLit.us (2007). Timing *Intended to be set after BtVS's seventh season. The precise timing of this arc is currently uncertain.

Overview  The island covers ; its highest point is above sea level. The island is divided by a narrow piece of land (isthmus) creating the West Island, East Island and the largest Home Island. The island has a rich bird life with about 30 species breeding here. The well- vegetated island has areas of bog, grey basalt on the West Island and eastern shore and at least 156 species of plant. Visitors can reach the island by ferry. In the summer ferries leave daily from Skarfabakki, Harpa, and Aegisgarour pier. In the winter, ferry service is from Skarfabakki on weekends only. The Reykjav√≠k City Card includes free ferry transfer to and from the island.  History  The island has archaeological remains dating back to the early 10th century and was the site where the \\"father of Reykjav√≠k\\" Skuli Magnusson constructed his home and a church in the 12th century. From 1225 to 1539 an Augustine Monastery was established on the island. There is a deserted village on the island, as the island's last inhabitants left in 1943. On the Western Island is the Videyjarstofa House. Vi√∞eyjarstofa House was constructed in 1753-1755 by the Danish government. The Danish architect Nicolai Eigtved designed the House.

Miller's Cove (spelled \\"Miller Cove\\" on USGS maps)United States Geological Survey, \\"Miller Cove.\\" Retrieved: 25 June 2008. is walled off to the north by Chilhowee Mountain, a low ridge stretching for 35 miles between the Little Tennessee River to the west and the Little Pigeon River watershed to the east. Hurricane Mountain to the southwest and Bates Mountain to the southeast divide Miller's Cove from the much larger Tuckaleechee Cove at the base of the Smokies. Little River, which flows down from its source on the northern slopes of Clingmans Dome, splits Miller's Cove into eastern and western sections en route to flatlands of northern Blount County. The river's valley, which divides Hurricane and Bates Mountain and slices a large gap through Chilhowee Mountain, has long provided a convenient bottomland for trails and roads linking the coves of the northern Smokies. Today, it is traversed by U.S. Route 321, which connects Interstate 40 to the Great Smoky Mountains National Park. The park boundary is about 15 miles south of Walland.

The per capita income for the city was $18,337. About 9.2% of families and 12.4% of the population were below the poverty line. History =Early history= In October 1567, the Juan Pardo expedition is believed to have crossed Little River at what is now Walland. The expedition arrived from the east via Reed Creek and headed west along Hesse Creek, traversing part of Chilhowee Mountain and Happy Valley en route to the village of \\"Chalahume\\" on the Little Tennessee River.Charles Hudson, The Juan Pardo Expeditions: Explorations of the Carolinas and Tennessee, 1566-1568 (Tuscaloosa, Ala.: University of Alabama Press, 2005), 36-40. By the time permanent Euro-American settlers arrived in the area in the 1780s, Miller's Cove was part of a vast Cherokee hunting ground. Along with fertile land typical of any limestone cove, the various Cherokee trails in the vicinity drew the first settlers to Miller's Cove in the late 18th century. The Great Indian Warpath passed through Maryville to the north, and the Tuckaleechee and Southeastern Trail forked in Tuckaleechee Cove to the south.Robbie Jones, The Historic Architecture of Sevier County, Tennessee (Sevierville, Tenn.: Smoky Mountain Historical Society, 1997), 3-7. The Overhill Cherokee villages of Chilhowee and Tallassee lay the other end of Chilhowee Mountain. The first Euro-American settlers arrived in Blount County around 1785, during a period of heightened tensions with the Cherokee. The county's early pioneers erected a series of small forts to protect themselves against sporadic Cherokee attacks, most of which were located in the vicinity of the Warpath. Miller's Cove is probably named after Alexander Miller and his brother, Andrew Miller, who built cabins in the cove sometime around 1800.Robert Wilson, \\"Walland Enriched With 200-Plus Years of History.\\" Knoxville News-Sentinel, 9 December 2004. A few years before the Millers arrived, Swiss immigrant John Hess built a grist mill in the west end of the cove. He was followed by the Martin family, whose mill was situated in the cove's eastern section. Other early settlers in Miller's Cove included Alexander Reed and John Waters, both of whom arrived before 1810.Inez Burns, History of Blount County, Tennessee: From War Trail to Landing Strip, 1795-1955 (Nashville: Benson Print Co., 1957), 221, 273-274. In 1810, Miller's Cove Baptist Church was formed from the division of Tuckaleechee Baptist Church between Miller's Cove and Wear Cove. The church remains one of the oldest congregations in Blount County.Burns, History of Blount County, 118-119. =The Civil War= Chilhowee Inn in Walland In 1845, George Amerine (c. 1784-1866) constructed an iron forge on Hess Creek in the western section of Miller's Cove. Using two bloomery fires and a water-driven hammer, Amerine's forge was producing 15 tons of bar iron per year by 1856. At the outset of the Civil War, the forge's operations ceased.Burns, History of Blount County, 245. From the early 19th century onward, Blount County was a hotbed of abolitionist activity, due in large part to the influence of Rev. Isaac Anderson of Maryville College and the Quaker community at Friendsville. When Tennessee voted on whether or not to secede from the Union in 1861, only 24% of Blount Countians voted in favor of secession.Jones, Historic Architecture of Sevier County, 33. Miller's Cove was no exception to Blount's pro-Union sentiment. In 1861, after the outbreak of the war, Union supporters held a rally in Miller's Cove, on the grounds of what is now Chilhowee Inn. Residents from the surrounding hills and mountains raised an American flag and saluted it, pledging their loyalty to the United States. Later in the war, when a Confederate Army unit passed through the cove, Maryville Judge Jesse Wallace warned them to leave the flag alone, for \\"the mountains swarmed with men who were deadly with their rifles.\\"Burns, History of Blount County, 170. Heeding the warning, the Confederate soldiers saluted the flag and continued onward. =The Progressive Era, 1890-1931= The home of James Martin in Walland, built early 1900s In 1893, the Walton and England Leather Co. of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania sent John W. Fisher to East Tennessee to look for suitable sites to build a tannery. Fisher selected Newport and Miller's Cove, both being accessible via railroad or river, and having access to seemingly endless rows of trees, the bark of which was used in the tanning process. Fisher's son, A.J., managed Walton and England's Miller's Cove tannery, and a small company town developed in the tannery's vicinity. The town was named Walland, which was a fusion of \\"Walton\\" and \\"England.\\"Robert Wilson, \\"Walland Enriched with 200-plus Years of History,\\" The Knoxville News-Sentinel, 9 December 2004. Fisher's house still stands on Old Walland Highway, and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. In 1901, using the railroad Walton and England had constructed between Walland and Maryville, the Schlosser Leather Company initiated an even more ambitious tanning project in Miller's Cove. Using the thick bark from trees harvested in the heavily forested Little River valley, the Schlosser tannery was processing 300 hides per day by 1909.Burns, History of Blount County, 274. The tannery allowed Walland to modernize to some extent, bringing electricity, framed houses, and greater railroad access. The company built Chilhowee Inn in 1902 to house executives visiting the tannery, and helped complete Walland High School in 1922.Burns, History of Blount County, 94, 170. While Schlosser Leather ceased operations in the area after the tannery burned in 1931, Walland was already benefiting from the growth of tourism in the Great Smokies several miles to the south. The Little River Railroad was completed from Walland to Elkmont in the early 20th century by W. B. Townsend's Little River Lumber Company. While initially a logging railroad, the line was offering passenger service to the mountains by 1909. Several resorts sprang up in the vicinity of Miller's Cove, using the health-restoring qualities of mountain springs to lure tourists. These included Montvale Springs, on the other side of Chilhowee Mountain to the north, and Kinzel Springs at the northern tip of Tuckaleechee Cove to the south. With the formation of the Great Smoky Mountains National Park in 1934 and the construction of US-321, Walland was able to replace the loss of tannery jobs with income from through-traffic and tourism. In 1966, one of the first sections of Foothills Parkway was completed across the western crest of Chilhowee Mountain, connecting Walland with Chilhowee Lake. Another section, connecting Walland with Wears Valley, was opened to the public in November, 2018 Education There is currently one public school located in Walland: Walland Elementary School, part of the Blount County Schools system. The school, located at 247 E. Miller's Cove Rd., was previously a middle school and high school. The present building was constructed in the 1960s.Davis, J. \\"Walland High School alumni plan to replace stage curtains,\\" The Maryville-Alcoa Daily Times, May 16, 2002 Among the school's outreach efforts is a bookmobile project in the communityTolman, B. \\"Walland Bookmobile seeks donations,\\" The Maryville-Alcoa Daily Times, June 22, 2006.

The sheets of charge, which are not necessarily planar, produce localised excursions of electric potential, resulting in a relatively strong electric field between the layers and weaker but more extensive compensating fields outside, which restore the global potential. Ions and electrons within the double layer are accelerated, decelerated, or deflected by the electric field, depending on their direction of motion. Double layers can be created in discharge tubes, where sustained energy is provided within the layer for electron acceleration by an external power source. Double layers are claimed to have been observed in the aurora and are invoked in astrophysical applications. Similarly, a double layer in the auroral region requires some external driver to produce electron acceleration. Electrostatic double layers are especially common in current-carrying plasmas, and are very thin (typically ten Debye lengths), compared to the sizes of the plasmas that contain them. Other names for a double layer are electrostatic double layer, electric double layer, plasma double layers. The term ‚Äòelectrostatic shock‚Äô in the magnetosphere has been applied to electric fields oriented at an oblique angle to the magnetic field in such a way that the perpendicular electric field is much stronger than the parallel electric field,http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph- bib_query?bibcode=1987dla..conf..295 In laser physics, a double layer is sometimes called an ambipolar electric field. Double layers are conceptually related to the concept of a 'sheath' (see Debye sheath). An early review of double layers from laboratory experiment and simulations is provided by Torv√©n.  Classification  Double layer formation. Formation of a double layer requires electrons to move between two adjacent regions (Diagram 1, top) causing a charge separation. An electrostatic potential imbalance may result (Diagram 2, bottom) Double layers may be classified in the following ways: *Weak and strong double layers. The strength of a double layer is expressed as the ratio of the potential drop in comparison with the plasma's equivalent thermal energy, or in comparison with the rest mass energy of the electrons. A double layer is said to be strong if the potential drop within the layer is greater than the equivalent thermal energy of the plasma's components. *Relativistic or non-relativistic double layers. A double layer is said to be relativistic if the potential drop within the layer is comparable to the rest mass energy (~512KeV) of the electron. Double layers of such energy are to be found in laboratory experiments. The charge density is low between the two opposing potential regions and the double layer is similar to the charge distribution in a capacitor in that respect. *Current carrying double layers These double layers may be generated by current-driven plasma instabilities that amplify variations of the plasma density. One example of these instabilities is the Farley‚ÄìBuneman instability, which occurs when the streaming velocity of electrons (basically the current density divided by the electron density) exceeds the electron thermal velocity of the plasma. It occurs in collisional plasmas having a neutral component, and is driven by drift currents. *Current-free double layers These occur at the boundary between plasma regions with different plasma properties. A plasma may have a higher electron temperature, and thermal velocity, on one side of a boundary layer than on the other. The same may apply for plasma densities. Charged particles exchanged between the regions may enable potential differences to be maintained between them locally. The overall charge density, as in all double layers, will be neutral. Potential imbalance will be neutralised by electron (1&3) and ion (2&4) migration, unless the potential gradients are sustained by an external energy source. Under most laboratory situations, unlike outer space conditions, charged particles may effectively originate within the double layer, by ionization at the anode or cathode, and be sustained. The figure shows the localised perturbation of potential produced by an idealised double layer consisting of two oppositely charged discs. The perturbation is zero at a distance from the double layer in every direction. If an incident charged particle, such as a precipitating auroral electron, encounters such a static or quasistatic structure in the magnetosphere, provided that the particle energy exceeds half the electric potential difference within the double layer, it will pass through without any net change in energy. Incident particles with less energy than this will also experience no net change in energy but will undergo more overall deflection. upright=2.5 Four distinct regions of a double layer can be identified, which affect charged particles passing through it, or within it: # A positive potential side of the double layer where electrons are accelerated towards it; # A positive potential within the double layer where electrons are decelerated; # A negative potential within the double layer where electrons are decelerated; and # A negative potential side of the double layer where electrons are accelerated. Double layers will tend to be transient in the magnetosphere, as any charge imbalance will become neutralised, unless there is a sustained external source of energy to maintain them as there is under laboratory conditions. =Formation mechanisms= The details of the formation mechanism depend on the environment of the plasma (e.g. double layers in the laboratory, ionosphere, solar wind, nuclear fusion, etc.). Proposed mechanisms for their formation have included: *1971: Between plasmas of different temperatures *1976: In laboratory plasmas *1982: Disruption of a neutral current sheet *1983: Injection of non-neutral electron current into a cold plasma *1985: Increasing the current density in a plasma *1986: In the accretion column of a neutron star *1986: By pinches in cosmic plasma regions *1987: In a plasma constrained by a magnetic mirror *1988: By an electrical discharge *1988: Current-driven instabilities (strong double layers) *1988: Spacecraft-ejected electron beams *1989: From shock waves in a plasma *2000: Laser radiation *2002: When magnetic field-aligned currents encounter density cavities *2003: By the incidence of plasma on the dark side of the Moon's surface. See picture.  Features and characteristics  The Moon. The prediction of a lunar double layer was confirmed in 2003. In the shadows, the Moon charges negatively in the interplanetary medium. *Thickness: The production of a double layer requires regions with a significant excess of positive or negative charge, that is, where quasi-neutrality is violated. In general, quasi-neutrality can only be violated on scales of the Debye length. The thickness of a double layer is of the order of ten Debye lengths, which is a few centimeters in the ionosphere, a few tens of meters in the interplanetary medium, and tens of kilometers in the intergalactic medium. *Electrostatic potential distribution: As described under double layer classification above, there are effectively four distinct regions of a double layer where incoming charged particles will be accelerated or decelerated along their trajectory . Within the double layer the two opposing charge distributions will tend to become neutralised by internal charged particle motion. *Particle flux: For non-relativistic current carrying double layers, electrons carry most of the current. The Langmuir condition states that the ratio of the electron and the ion current across the layer is given by the square root of the mass ratio of the ions to the electrons. For relativistic double layers the current ratio is 1; i.e. the current is carried equally by electrons and ions. *Energy supply: The instantaneous voltage drop across a current-carrying double layer is proportional to the total current, and is similar to that across a resistive element (or load), which dissipates energy in an electric circuit. A double layer cannot supply net energy on its own. *Stability: Double layers in laboratory plasmas may be stable or unstable depending on the parameter regime. Various types of instabilities may occur, often arising due to the formation of beams of ions and electrons. Unstable double layers are noisy in the sense that they produce oscillations across a wide frequency band. A lack of plasma stability may also lead to a sudden change in configuration often referred to as an explosion (and hence exploding double layer). In one example, the region enclosed in the double layer rapidly expands and evolves. An explosion of this type was first discovered in mercury arc rectifiers used in high-power direct-current transmission lines, where the voltage drop across the device was seen to increase by several orders of magnitude. Double layers may also drift, usually in the direction of the emitted electron beam, and in this respect are natural analogues to the smooth-bore magnetronhttp://scitation.aip.org/getabs/servlet/GetabsServlet?prog=normal&id;=JAPIAU000037000007002598000001&idtype;=cvips&gifs;=yes *Magnetised plasmas: Double layers can form in both magnetised and unmagnetised plasmas. *Cellular nature: While double layers are relatively thin, they will spread over the entire cross surface of a laboratory container. Likewise where adjacent plasma regions have different properties, double layers will form and tend to cellularise the different regions. Hall effect thruster. The electric fields utilised in plasma thrusters (in particular the Helicon Double Layer Thruster) may be in the form of double layers.See \\"Helicon Double Layer Thruster study\\", European Space Agency; \\"ESA accelerates towards a new space thruster\\" (2005) *Energy transfer: Double layers can facilitate the transfer of electrical energy into kinetic energy, dW/dt=I‚Ä¢ŒîV where I is the electric current dissipating energy into a double layer with a voltage drop of ŒîV. Alfv√©n points out that the current may well consist exclusively of low-energy particles. Torv√©n et al. have postulated that plasma may spontaneously transfer magnetically stored energy into kinetic energy by electric double layers. No credible mechanism for producing such double layers has been presented, however. Ion thrusters can provide a more direct case of energy transfer from opposing potentials in the form of double layers produced by an external electric field. *Oblique double layer: An oblique double layer has electric fields that are not parallel to the ambient magnetic field; i.e., it is not field-aligned. *Simulation: Double layers may be modelled using kinetic computer models like particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations. In some cases the plasma is treated as essentially one- or two- dimensional to reduce the computational cost of a simulation. *Bohm Criterion: A double layer cannot exist under all circumstances. In order to produce an electric field that vanishes at the boundaries of the double layer, an existence criterion says that there is a maximum to the temperature of the ambient plasma. This is the so-called Bohm criterion. *Bio-physical analogy: A model of plasma double layers has been used to investigate their applicability to understanding ion transport across biological cell membranes. Brazilian researchers have noted that \\"Concepts like charge neutrality, Debye length, and double layer are very useful to explain the electrical properties of a cellular membrane.\\"http://scitation.aip.org/getabs/servlet/GetabsServlet?prog=normal&id;=AJPIAS000068000005000450000001&idtype;=cvips&gifs;=yes Plasma physicist Hannes Alfv√©n also noted that association of double layers with cellular structure, as had Irving Langmuir before him, who coined the term \\"plasma\\" after its resemblance to blood cells.G. L. Rogoff, Ed., \\"Introduction\\", IEEE Transactions on Plasma Science, vol. 19, p. 989, Dec. 1991. See extract on the Plasma Coalition web site History A cluster of double layers forming in an Alfv√©n wave, about a sixth of the distance from the left. Click for more details It was already known in the 1920s that a plasma has a limited capacity for current maintenance, Irving Langmuir characterized double layers in the laboratory and called these structures double-sheaths. In the 1950s a thorough study of double layers started in the laboratory.e.g. Many groups are still working on this topic theoretically, experimentally and numerically. It was first proposed by Hannes Alfv√©n (the developer of magnetohydrodynamics from laboratory experiments) that the polar lights or Aurora Borealis are created by electrons accelerated in the magnetosphere of the Earth.Alfv√©n, H., \\"On the theory of magnetic storms and aurorae\\", Tellus, 10, 104,. 1958. He supposed that the electrons were accelerated electrostatically by an electric field localized in a small volume bounded by two charged regions, and the so-called double layer would accelerate electrons earthwards. Since then other mechanisms involving wave- particle interactions have been proposed as being feasible, from extensive spatial and temporal in situ studies of auroral particle characteristics. Many investigations of the magnetosphere and auroral regions have been made using rockets and satellites. McIlwain discovered from a rocket flight in 1960 that the energy spectrum of auroral electrons exhibited a peak that was thought then to be too sharp to be produced by a random process and which suggested, therefore, that an ordered process was responsible. It was reported in 1977 that satellites had detected the signature of double layers as electrostatic shocks in the magnetosphere. indications of electric fields parallel to the geomagnetic field lines was obtained by the Viking satellite, which measures the differential potential structures in the magnetosphere with probes mounted on 40m long booms. These probes measured the local particle density and the potential difference between two points 80m apart. Asymmetric potential excursions with respect to 0 V were measured, and interpreted as a double layer with a net potential within the region. Magnetospheric double layers typically have a strength e\\\\phi_{DL}/k_B T_e \\\\approx 0.1 (where the electron temperature is assumed to lie in the range 2 eV \\\\leq k_B T_e \\\\leq 20 eV) and are therefore weak. A series of such double layers would tend to merge, much like a string of bar magnets, and dissipate, even within a rarefied plasma. It has yet to be explained how any overall localised charge distribution in the form of double layers might provide a source of energy for auroral electrons precipitated into the atmosphere. Interpretation of the FAST spacecraft data proposed strong double layers in the auroral acceleration region. Strong double layers have also been reported in the downward current region by Andersson et al. Parallel electric fields with amplitudes reaching nearly 1 V/m were inferred to be confined to a thin layer of approximately 10 Debye lengths. It is stated that the structures moved ‚Äòat roughly the ion acoustic speed in the direction of the accelerated electrons, i.e., anti-earthward.‚Äô That raises a question of what role, if any, double layers might play in accelerating auroral electrons that are precipitated downwards into the atmosphere from the magnetosphere. The possible role of precipitating electrons from 1-10keV themselves generating such observed double layers or electric fields has seldom been considered or analysed. Equally, the general question of how such double layers might be generated from an alternative source of energy, or what the spatial distribution of electric charge might be to produce net energy changes, is seldom addressed. Under laboratory conditions an external power supply is available. In the laboratory, double layers can be created in different devices. They are investigated in double plasma machines, triple plasma machines, and Q-machines. The stationary potential structures that can be measured in these machines agree very well with what one would expect theoretically. An example of a laboratory double layer can be seen in the figure below, taken from Torv√©n and Lindberg (1980), where we can see how well-defined and confined is the potential drop of a double layer in a double plasma machine. One of the interesting aspects of the experiment by Torv√©n and Lindberg (1980) is that not only did they measure the potential structure in the double plasma machine but they also found high- frequency fluctuating electric fields at the high-potential side of the double layer (also shown in the figure). These fluctuations are probably due to a beam-plasma interaction outside the double layer, which excites plasma turbulence. Their observations are consistent with experiments on electromagnetic radiation emitted by double layers in a double plasma machine by Volwerk (1993), who, however, also observed radiation from the double layer itself. The power of these fluctuations has a maximum around the plasma frequency of the ambient plasma. It was later reported that the electrostatic high-frequency fluctuations near the double layer can be concentrated in a narrow region, sometimes called the hf-spike. Subsequently, both radio emissions, near the plasma frequency, and whistler waves at much lower frequencies were seen to emerge from this region. Similar whistler wave structures were observed together with electron beams near Saturn's moon Enceladus, suggesting the possible presence of a double layer at lower altitude. A recent development in double layer experiments in the laboratory is the investigation of so-called stairstep double layers. It has been observed that a potential drop in a plasma column can be divided into different parts. Transitions from a single double layer into two-, three-, or greater-step double layers are strongly sensitive to the boundary conditions of the plasma. Unlike experiments in the laboratory, the concept of such double layers in the magnetosphere, and any role in creating the aurora, suffers from there so far being no identified steady source of energy. The electric potential characteristic of double layers might however indicate that, those observed in the auroral zone are a secondary product of precipitating electrons that have been energized in other ways, such as by electrostatic waves. Some scientists have suggested a role of double layers in solar flares. Establishing such a role indirectly is even harder to verify than postulating double layers as accelerators of auroral electrons within the earth's magnetosphere. Serious questions have been raised on their role even there.

While originally pertaining to problems associated with paper documentation, data proliferation has become a major problem in primary and secondary data storage on computers. While digital storage has become cheaper, the associated costs, from raw power to maintenance and from metadata to search engines, have not kept up with the proliferation of data. Although the power required to maintain a unit of data has fallen, the cost of facilities which house the digital storage has tended to rise. Data proliferation has been documented as a problem for the U.S. military since August 1971, in particular regarding the excessive documentation submitted during the acquisition of major weapon systems. Efforts to mitigate data proliferation and the problems associated with it are ongoing.Data Proliferation: Stop That Problems caused The problem of data proliferation is affecting all areas of commerce as the result of the availability of relatively inexpensive data storage devices. This has made it very easy to dump data into secondary storage immediately after its window of usability has passed. This masks problems that could gravely affect the profitability of businesses and the efficient functioning of health services, police and security forces, local and national governments, and many other types of organizations. Data proliferation is problematic for several reasons: *Difficulty when trying to find and retrieve information. At Xerox, on average it takes employees more than one hour per week to find hard-copy documents, costing $2,152 a year to manage and store them. For businesses with more than 10 employees, this increases to almost two hours per week at $5,760 per year.‚ÄúDealing with data proliferation‚Äù; Vawn Himmelsbach. it business.ca: Canadian Technology News, September 19, 2006 In large networks of primary and secondary data storage, problems finding electronic data are analogous to problems finding hard copy data. *Data loss and legal liability when data is disorganized, not properly replicated, or cannot be found in a timely manner. In April 2005, the Ameritrade Holding Corporation told 200,000 current and past customers that a tape containing confidential information had been lost or destroyed in transit. In May of the same year, Time Warner Incorporated reported that 40 tapes containing personal data on 600,000 current and former employees had been lost en route to a storage facility.

Mayaki was the Foreign Minister of Niger from 1963‚Äì1965, and a leading member of the ruling PPN-RDA party. Mayaki was born in Filingu√© in 1919. His family was of a royal Sudi√© line, a Hausa speaking subgroup which governed the town under French colonial rule. His grandfather was the first French appointed Chef du Canton of the area, and his father was Serkin of Filingu√© until 1935. Mayaki attended the French teachers college at Kati, Mali, became a civil engineer, and became active in politics in 1946 as a leader of the Nigerien Action Bloc (BNA), which later became the Union of Nigerien Independents and Sympathisers (UNIS), one of two pre-independence parties contesting the 1952 territorial elections. Mayaki was elected to the Nigerien Territorial Assembly in March 1952 from Maradi and was re-elected in 1956. From 1952 he also served on the Grand Council of French West Africa, and from 1953 as Niger colony's representative to the French Union and in 1958, after the UNIS split, was elected to the first Territorial National Assembly from the PPN-RDA-led Union for the Franco-African Community (UCFA). The UCFA was a front aligned with the PPN which proposed continued membership in the French Community, and opposed immediate independence proposed by the PPN's rival SAWABA party. The 1958 election deposed SAWABA (which some other UNIS members had joined) from the Assembly, and Mayaki became a prominent member of Hamani Diori's first semi-independent Nigerien government. Mayaki had been the Territory's Minister of Agriculture from May 1957, and after the UCFA victory, he became Niger's first Minister of the Interior. In December 1958 he became Minister of Economics and Planning. After full independence in 1960, Mayaki became Minister of Commerce and Industry. In 1963 he took over from President Diori as the Foreign Minister of Niger. SAWABA militants, after their party had been decreed illegal in 1959, launched a series of sabotage attacks and border raids in 1964 and 65. In response, the PPN moved a number of members who had at one time belonged to rival parties, Mayaki among them. He became Nigerien ambassador to the United States from 1965 to 1970, prefect of Dosso Region (then named \\"department\\"), and in 1973 president of the Nigerien state trucking company, the SNTN. When the First Republic was overthrown in the 1974 Nigerien coup d'√©tat, Mayaki managed to retain a government post, and Secretary to the Nigerien Ministry of Finance. He retired in 1976.

He is currently the head football coach at the Colorado School of Mines, a position he had held since 2015. Prior to that, he was the offensive coordinator at New Mexico State University and coached tight ends in the United Football League (UFL) for the Las Vegas Locomotives. He also spent two years as the offensive coordinator at the University of Wyoming and was offensive coordinator for the Virginia Cavaliers for the duration of the 2009 season. He was head coach for the Bowling Green Falcons, but was fired following the conclusion of the 2008 season, after six years at the helm, which included three bowl appearances and shares of two division titles. Brandon had previously been an assistant coach and offensive coordinator at Bowling Green under head coach Urban Meyer before Meyer left for the University of Utah in 2003. Playing career Brandon played football at Air Academy High School in Colorado Springs, Colorado. He went on to compete at the collegiate level as both a defensive back and wide receiver at Colorado Mesa University (1974) and University of Northern Colorado (1975‚Äì1977). He graduated from Northern Colorado in 1978 with a bachelor's degree in education. Coaching career =Early career= Brandon began his coaching career as head football coach at Ellicott (Colo.) High School. He spent three seasons there (1978‚Äì1980) before joining the college ranks at Weber State University, under Mike Price, where he coached the next six seasons (1981‚Äì1986). He coached the tight ends and special teams in his first four seasons, the linebackers in his fifth year and the receivers and tight ends during his final year in Ogden. In 1987 was then named receivers coach at Wyoming, where he worked the next four years (1987‚Äì90). During his tenure with head coach Paul Roach, the Cowboys posted a 35‚Äì15 record, including a 16‚Äì0 run in Western Athletic Conference play in 1987 and 1988, and played in three bowls (1987 Holiday Bowl, 1988 Holiday Bowl, and 1990 Copper Bowl). In 1991, he returned to the state of Utah, where he coached the linebackers for one season at Utah State. The following year, Brandon joined the Northwestern staff as receivers coach. He was also Northwestern's recruiting coordinator for his last two seasons there (1997‚Äì1998). In his seven seasons at Northwestern, Brandon assembled an extremely talented group of receivers, including D'Wayne Bates, the second all-time leading receiver in Big Ten history. Bates was a semifinalist for the Biletnikoff Award and an All-America candidate. Brandon returned to the West, spending two seasons at Colorado under Gary Barnett, where he coached the receivers and kickoff return units both years and was the team's passing-game coordinator in 2000 and recruiting coordinator in 1999. =Bowling Green= Brandon joined the Falcons as an assistant head coach and offensive coordinator following the 2000 season under head coach Urban Meyer. Following Meyer's departure to Utah in 2002, Gregg Brandon was named the 16th head football coach in Bowling Green's history. In his first season as Bowling Green's head coach, Brandon lead the Falcons to an 11‚Äì3 record, a national ranking. and an appearance in the 2003 MAC Championship Game, where they lost the Miami RedHawks at Doyt Perry Stadium. The Falcons were invited to a bowl game, defeating Northwestern, 28‚Äì24 at the Motor City Bowl at Ford Field in Detroit, Michigan. The following season, Brandon went 9‚Äì3 including taking the Falcons to a second consecutive bowl game, defeating Memphis 52‚Äì35 at the 2004 GMAC Bowl in Mobile, Alabama. The Falcons finished 6‚Äì5 in 2005 after losing a hard fought game against arch rival, Toledo in multiple overtimes, a game that had the Falcons won would have sent them to their second MAC Championship and then potentially to a bowl game for the third straight year. Brandon suffered his first and only losing season in 2006, finishing 4‚Äì8 including losses to rivals Kent State, Miami (OH), and Toledo, as well as becoming the first team to lose to Temple in 20-games. Brandon's Falcons put the prior season behind them as they posted an 8‚Äì5 record during their 2007 campaign earning a share of the MAC East Division title, but missing out on the opportunity to play in the MAC Championship game due to a tiebreaker. Brandon led the team to its third bowl under his tenure, losing to Tulsa, 63‚Äì7, in the GMAC Bowl. Coming into the 2008 season, the Falcons were picked to be the beast of the MAC East and were projected to reach the MAC Championship Game as well as their second straight bowl game. However, the Falcons had a very disappointing campaign, going 6‚Äì6 including a 1‚Äì4 record at home. Following the Falcons double-overtime loss in their home finale against Buffalo, Brandon showed irritation with the fans for their poor attendance at the game as it had championship implications. The day after winning their first road contest at arch rival Toledo since 1994, Brandon was fired by athletic director Greg Christopher after six years as Bowling Green's head coach and posting a 44‚Äì30 record. =Virginia= On December 18, 2008, Brandon accepted the position of offensive coordinator at the University of Virginia, replacing Mike Groh (son of then current Virginia head coach, Al Groh), who stepped down a week before Brandon's hiring. Brandon had been named a leading candidate for the position soon after Groh's resignation. =Colorado School of Mines= On December 29, 2014, Brandon became the head football coach the Colorado School of Mines.

Two prototype aircraft (designated XOSE-1) were built and flown in 1946. The XOSE-1 was a single-seat low-wing cantilever monoplane with a single float and fixed wingtip stabilizing floats. The wings could be folded for shipboard storage. The aircraft was designed for a variety of roles including observation and anti-submarine patrols. Unusually, it was designed to carry a rescue cell on the underwing hardpoints, which would be capable of carrying a single person when used for air-sea rescue. Eight production aircraft (designated XOSE-1) were built to a United States Navy order but none were accepted into service.

Nowadays historians mostly think that there was a Frisian king in the first half of the 7th century with the name Audulf, containing the words adel and wolf. The land this king ruled was probably the central rivers area of the Netherlands. The written sources do not contain any information of this monarch, but there are some golden coins found with the words ‚ÄúAudulfus‚Äù and ‚ÄúFrisia‚Äù on them. The land where the Frisian people once lived was at that time divided, each with his own ruler.* (2003), Kings of the Noardsea Excavations in the north of Friesland, in the area called Westergo proved that some kind of power has existed in that time in the province of Friesland. The coins were found in the Netherlands at Escharen in nearby Arnhem and also in England. Most are dated between 600 and 630. At the beginning of 2006 a coin stamp of Audwulf with the words AUDWULF FRISIA was found in the Frisian village Wijnaldum at the place which earlier was searched for the keningshal of the Frisian kings. Another interesting finding that is brought in context with Audulf is the treasure trove of Wiuwert.

Discovered by Sergey Belyavsky and Nikolaj Ivanov in 1927, it was named after Russian astronomer Aleksey Hansky. The presumed dark C-type asteroid has a rotation period of 15.6 hours.  Discovery  Hanskya was discovered on 29 August 1927, by Russian astronomers Sergey Belyavsky and Nikolaj Ivanov at the Simeiz Observatory on the Crimean peninsula. The asteroid was independently discovered by two other prolific astronomers in the field, namely Karl Reinmuth at the German Heidelberg Observatory ‚Äì who observed the body only one day later and announced it first ‚Äì and by Belgian astronomer Eug√®ne Delporte at Uccle Observatory on 17 September.  Orbit and classification  Hanskya is a non-family asteroid of the main belt's background population when applying the hierarchical clustering method to its proper orbital elements. It orbits the Sun in the outer asteroid belt at a distance of 3.1‚Äì3.4 AU once every 5 years and 9 months (2,103 days). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.04 and an inclination of 14¬∞ with respect to the ecliptic. The body's observation arc begins at Heidelberg or Simeiz one night after its official discovery observation.  Naming  This minor planet was named on the 25th anniversary of the death of Russian Aleksey Hansky (1870‚Äì1908), whose initiative lead to the construction of the discovering Simeiz Observatory.  Physical characteristics  Hanskya is an assumed carbonaceous C-type asteroid. = Rotation period = In October 21010, a rotational lightcurve of Hanskya was obtained from photometric observations at the Sunflower Observatory in Kansas, United States . Lightcurve analysis gave a rotation period of 15.61 hours with a brightness amplitude of 0.18 magnitude (). More recent observations at the Palomar Transient Factory and by French amateur astronomer Ren√© Roy gave a longer period of 25.31 and 25.3481 hours and an amplitude of 0.38 and 0.25, respectively (). = Diameter and albedo = According to the surveys carried out by the Infrared Astronomical Satellite IRAS, the Japanese Akari satellite and the NEOWISE mission of NASA's Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer, Hanskya measures between 70.954 and 90.29 kilometers in diameter and its surface has an albedo between 0.029 and 0.056. The Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link derives a low albedo of 0.0358 and a diameter of 77.03 kilometers based on an absolute magnitude of 9.8.

It is expected to be relocated to Hialeah Gardens, Florida. History In September 1987, Arnhilda Gonzalez-Quevedo, the Republican member of the Florida House of Representatives for Coral Gables, presented the museum founders with $75,000 from the state of Florida for its construction. The museum was dedicated on April 17, 1988 at 1821 South West Ninth Street in Little Havana, Miami by 400 attendees, including veterans and Cuban exiles. It is officially known as the Juan J. Peruyero Museum and Manuel F. Artime Library, and thus named for two Bay of Pigs Invasion veterans. In 2015, Frank de Varona, a veteran and author attempted to nominate the building for historic registration, only to withdraw the nomination due to opposition from other veterans. The Bay of Pigs Museum was expected to be relocated to Hialeah Gardens, Florida in 2018. A B-26 located in Guatemala was also expected be brought over to the museum. Collections According to Time Out Miami, the museum has \\"a small but interesting collection of ephemera and memorabilia\\" about the Bay of Pigs Invasion, including the Brigade 2506 flag held by Democratic President John F.

Interface and colloid science is an interdisciplinary intersection of branches of chemistry, physics, nanoscience and other fields dealing with colloids, heterogeneous systems consisting of a mechanical mixture of particles between 1 nm and 1000 nm dispersed in a continuous medium. A colloidal solution is a heterogeneous mixture in which the particle size of the substance is intermediate between a true solution and a suspension, i.e. between 1‚Äì1000 nm. Smoke from a fire is an example of a colloidal system in which tiny particles of solid float in air. Just like true solutions, colloidal particles are small and cannot be seen by the naked eye. They easily pass through filter paper. But colloidal particles are big enough to be blocked by parchment paper or animal membrane.

Career  After spending the previous decade working at the Oxford Orthopaedic Engineering Centre (part of the Nuffield Orthopaedic Centre), Kyberd lectured in the Cybernetics Department of Reading University, where he was part of the team that performed the first implant of a bi-directional nerve sensor on a healthy human being. In 2003 he took up the Canada Research Chair in Rehabilitation Cybernetics at the Institute of Biomedical Engineering, University of New Brunswick, where I conducted research in the clinical application of intelligent prosthetic arms, energy storage and return in prosthetic ankles and was part of the Upper Limb Prosthetics Outcome Measures Group (ULPOM), promoting the use of validated and standardised tools of prosthetic assessment. In 2015 he joined the University of Greenwich to serve as head of the Engineering and Science Department, before moving on to Portsmouth in November 2018. One early innovation was the use of sensitive microphones to detect when an object gripped by a prosthetic hand was slipping. Using this, he was able to design a hand which could pick up a raw egg without breaking it.

Greenmarkets In 1976, after the original Greenmarket on 59th Street & 2nd Avenue proved to be successful, the New York City Department of City Planning proposed to the Council on the Environment of New York City opening a second farmers market in Union Square and a third market in Brooklyn. The Union Square farmers market was smaller and considerably less hectic than the 59th Street & 2nd Avenue location. The Brooklyn Market was large and nearly as successful and the 59th Street & 2nd Avenue location. The land where the Brooklyn Market was located was privately owned by the Brooklyn Academy of Music. The Union Square market and the 59th Street & 2nd Avenue market were publicly owned by the city.

She was the youngest person ever selected by a government human spaceflight program.The First Cosmonaut Woman's Journey: When it entered history by Andreea Cuzub (2018)  Life  Kuznetsova was born in Moscow in 1941. In 1958 she completed her secondary schooling and the following year enrolled to study typing and shorthand. Her first job, in 1959, was as a stenographer at the Ministry of Radioelectronic Industry in Moscow, followed by secretarial positions at other government research institutes. In 1958, as a teenager, she took up parachuting as a hobby, and by 1961 was a regional and national champion. In 1964 she became a parachuting instructor. In December 1961, the selection of female cosmonaut trainees was authorised by the Soviet government, with the specific intention of ensuring the first woman in space was a Soviet citizen. In February 1962, Kuznetsova was selected from over 400 applicants to join a group of five female cosmonauts to be trained for a solo spaceflight in a Vostok spacecraft. Even though she was only 20 years old, her skill and courage in parachuting led the cosmonaut recruiters to select her for their programme. In the early days of her training, Kuznetsova was the favourite to become the first woman in space, but by late summer 1962 some failures in the physically and emotionally tough preparation regime resulted in her being removed from training. Despite her earlier difficulties, Kuznetsova was recalled to cosmonaut training in January 1965 to prepare for a spaceflight on a two-woman Voskhod 5 mission, but the project was cancelled before she had a chance to fly. Kuznetsova finally retired from the cosmonaut program in 1969 when it became clear that no women would be included on future Soviet flights. However, she stayed at the training centre and assisted with geophysical experiments and studies. From 1979 she served in the Air Force Reserves and rose to the rank of lieutenant- colonel before retiring in 1991. Kuznetsova died on 28 August 2018.

The museum is located on the Saadiyat Island Cultural District. It is approximately in size, with of galleries, making it the largest art museum in the Arabian peninsula. Artworks from around the world are showcased at the museum, with particular focus placed upon bridging the gap between Eastern and Western art.  History  The establishment of the museum was approved by the French Parliament on 9 October 2007. The architect for the building is Jean Nouvel, and the engineers are BuroHappold Engineering. Jean Nouvel also designed the Institut du Monde Arabe in Paris. The museum is part of a 30-year agreement between the city of Abu Dhabi and the French government. The museum was inaugurated on 8 November 2017 by French President Emmanuel Macron, United Arab Emirates Vice President Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, and Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan. US$525 million was paid by Abu Dhabi to be associated with the Louvre name, and an additional US$747 million will be paid in exchange for art loans, special exhibitions, and management advice. The museum is part of a US$27 billion tourist and cultural development for Saadiyat Island, a complex which is planned to include three other museums, including the Guggenheim Abu Dhabi and the Zayed National Museum. According to the government-sponsored website UAE Interact: \\"The French Museums Agency will operate in collaboration with the Tourism Development and Investment Company (TDIC), which is behind the transformation of Saadiyat Island. It will be chaired by French financier and member of the country's Acad√©mie des Beaux-Arts, Marc Ladreit de Lacharri√®re, publisher of the periodical Revue des Deux Mondes.\\" Bruno Maquart, the former Executive Director of Centre Georges Pompidou, will take the position of Executive Director. After the deal of the Louvre Abu Dhabi between the French government and the government of Abu Dhabi was announced, former French President Jacques Chirac said: On November 2019, the street leading to the Louvre Abu Dhabi was named Jacques Chirac Street in celebration of Chirac's efforts to bolster links between France and the UAE during his presidency.  Design  = Location = Saadiyat Island's Cultural District plans to house the largest single cluster of world-class cultural assets. In addition to the Louvre Abu Dhabi these are intended to include: Zayed National Museum, to be designed by United Kingdom-based architectural company Foster and Partners under the direction of Lord Norman Foster; the Guggenheim Abu Dhabi contemporary arts museum ‚Äì expected to be the world's largest Guggenheim; a performing arts centre designed by Zaha Hadid; a maritime museum with concept design by Tadao Ando and a number of arts pavilions. = Architecture = The museum is designed as a \\"seemingly floating dome structure\\"; its web-patterned dome allowing the sun to filter through. The overall effect is meant to represent \\"rays of sunlight passing through date palm fronds in an oasis.\\". The total area of the museum will be approximately . The permanent collection will occupy , and the temporary exhibitions will take place over . = Engineering = BuroHappold Engineering provided multidisciplinary engineering services across the project, including structural engineering, geotechnical engineering, energy and environmental consultancy, water engineering, facade engineering, lighting design, people movement consultancy, security services and inclusive design. Their structural engineers realised the \\"floating dome\\" from 7,850 aluminium stars of varying sizes, which tessellate over eight layers to create a perforated roof structure that allows sunlight through to the spaces below. A team of specialist geotechnical and water engineers designed a watertight basement and tidal pools within the galleries to give the illusion of a \\"museum in the sea\\" while protecting artwork, artefacts and visitors from the corrosive marine environment. = Construction = Construction works at Louvre Abu Dhabi officially started on 26 May 2009. Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, the Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi and the President of France, Nicolas Sarkozy inaugurated an exhibition titled, Talking Art: Louvre Abu Dhabi at the Gallery One of the Emirates Palace hotel which includes 19 works of art bought over the last 18 months for the Louvre Abu Dhabi, as well as loans from the French national museums to mark the beginning of the construction work. Piling works at the Louvre were to be completed by August 2010, with the piling and enabling works package awarded to the German specialized company (Bauer International FZE). The total of 4536 piles consisted of RC Piles and H-Piles and was completed on 3 August 2010. On 29 October 2011, Tourism Development & Investment Company (TDIC.), the project manager owned by the government of Abu Dhabi, announced it would delay establishing the museum. The company gave no new date. According to the UAE newspapers Gulf News and The National, the delay could be explained by a review of the emirate's economic strategy.Showcase projects yield to more urgent needs, Gulf News, 10 November 2011 In January 2012 it was confirmed that the Louvre Abu Dhabi's new opening date would be 2015. Construction on the main phase of the museum began in early 2013 by a consortium headed by Arabtec, Constructora San Jos√© and Oger Abu Dhabi. This stage includes waterproofing and the two basement levels, along with four concrete pillars that will support the 7,000-tonne dome. Work on the construction of the gallery spaces and initial preparation for the dome began in the fourth quarter of 2013. On 5 December 2013, the first element of the museum's canopy was lifted into place. On 17 March 2014 TDIC announced the completion of the first permanent gallery structure to mark the first anniversary of the start of construction. At this time, it was claimed that a total of ten million man hours had been worked and 120,538 cubic meters of concrete used. On 22 September, the final super-sized element in the canopy was fitted in place, marking a significant milestone in the museum's construction phase. In October, The Tourism & Development Investment Company announced that the Louvre Abu Dhabi was more than 50 percent complete. =Visual identity= The three-languages wayfinding system for the Louvre Abu Dhabi was designed by Philippe Apeloig, and is implemented in both Arabic and Roman script. Frutiger LT typeface has been chosen for the Roman texts for its perfect readability for signage; while Lebanese typographer Kristyan Sarkis created an Arabic bespoke typeface, the LAD Arabic, based on the classic Naskh style and his Colvert Arabic font. The design of the pictograms was inspired by the museum's architecture, and particularly by the abstract shapes created by the rain of light filtering through the gigantic dome's mashrabiyas. Each pictogram is a combination of several of these shapes, creating silhouettes and objects.  Collection  Salvator Mundi, c. 1500 by Leonardo da Vinci, the most expensive painting ever sold as of 2017, was set to be displayed in Louvre Abu Dhabi. However, its whereabouts are currently unknown. Questions have been raised as to the nature of the artworks to be displayed at the museum. However, according to The National: \\"the type and nature of the exhibits planned for the Louvre Abu Dhabi have been affected to no extent by the fact the new museum would be in a Muslim country, said Mr. Loyrette.\\" It has been noted that the museum will showcase work from multiple French museums, including the Louvre, the Centre Georges Pompidou, the Mus√©e d'Orsay and Palace of Versailles. However, Renaud Donnedieu de Vabres, the French Minister of Culture, stated at the announcement that the Paris Louvre \\"would not sell any of its 35,000-piece collection currently on display\\". In 2012, the Louvre Abu Dhabi started collecting photography, making its first acquisitions in the field, including works by Joseph-Philibert Girault de Prangey, Roger Fenton and George Wilson Bridges. The museum also acquired a sculpture of a Bactrian princess dating from the third millennium BC, a pavement and fountain set from the early Ottoman period, as well as the paintings Breton Boys Wrestling (1888) by Paul Gauguin and The Subjugated Reader (1928) by Ren√© Magritte.Gareth Harris (14 September 2012), Louvre Abu Dhabi acquires its first photographic works The Art Newspaper. Further details of the museum's collection on opening were revealed in October 2014, with a number of important works to be loaned under the agreement with Agence France-Mus√©ums and the Mus√©e du Louvre, including Leonardo Da Vinci's La Belle Ferronniere and works by Henri Matisse, a self-portrait by Vincent Van Gogh, Jacques-Louis David's Napoleon Crossing the Alps and Claude Monet's Gare Saint-Lazare. @LouvreAbuDhabi tweeted 8 December 2017 that the Louvre Abu Dhabi is looking forward to displaying the Salvator Mundi by Leonardo Da Vinci. The work was acquired, at a record price for a painting, by the Department of Culture & Tourism of Abu Dhabi for the museum. No date was set for the display of this work but in September 2018, the unveiling was indefinitely postponed and a January 2019 news report indicated that \\"no one knows where it is, and there are grave concerns for its physical safety\\".  Exhibitions  The Louvre Abu Dhabi first started sharing its collection with the public through an exhibition entitled \\"Talking Art: Louvre Abu Dhabi,\\" which opened in May 2009. The exhibition presented the first 19 acquisitions for the institution, including a Mamluk Quran from the 14th century, a 5th-century Fibula from Domagnano, a Virgin and Child by Bellini, and Mondrian‚Äôs Composition with blue, red, yellow and black from 1922.Sara Amdan (26 September 2012), After a Sputtering Start, the Louvre Abu Dhabi Project Gathers Pace New York Times. A second exhibition, \\"Birth of a Museum\\", opened at the exhibition space Manarat Al Saadiyat in May 2013, ending in August that year. The first large-scale preview of the collection, it featured 130 works acquired by the government of Abu Dhabi for the permanent collection. They included a never-before-seen work by Picasso, a Bronze Age terracotta statue from Cyprus, along with artifacts from Greece, Turkey, Japan and Syria. In May 2014, the Birth of a Museum exhibition, featuring works shown in Abu Dhabi and a number of new acquisitions opened at the Louvre in Paris. A number of new works were presented, including Chirisei Kyubiki by the Japanese artist Kazuo Shiraga and painted in 1960.  Other programmes  The Louvre Abu Dhabi has also been working with the Paris Sorbonne University Abu Dhabi to set up a master's program for museum professionals to train them and help them respond to local needs.  Management  Le Boh√©mien (1861‚Äì62), by √âdouard Manet, is displayed in the museum. = Contract = Louvre Abu Dhabi is an entirely separate museum from the Louvre in Paris, although the two are linked by a thirty-year branding and training agreement and the Paris Louvre is one of the 12 shareholders in Agence France-Mus√©ums. The thirty-year agreement, signed by French Minister of Culture Renaud Donnedieu de Vabres and Sheik Sultan bin Tahnoon Al Nahyan, will prompt the construction of a Louvre museum on Saadiyat Island, near central Abu Dhabi, in exchange for US$1.3 billion. The contract prohibits the creation of any similar operation with the name of the Louvre in any of the other emirates of the UAE, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Oman, Bahrain, Qatar, Egypt, Jordan, Syria, Lebanon, Iran, or Iraq. French President Jacques Chirac praised the museum deal with Abu Dhabi, saying it reflects \\"a certain idea of the world\\" in which each party to the accord, \\"proud of its roots and of its identity, is conscious of the equal dignity of all cultures.\\" = Cost = US$525 million was paid by Abu Dhabi to be associated with the Louvre name, and an additional $747 million in exchange for art loans, special exhibitions and management advice. Arabtec & Constructora Sanjose is leading a consortium that is building the museum under a $653 million contract awarded early in 2013. = Cost estimates = US$525 million was paid by the city of Abu Dhabi for the use of the Louvre brand name, with US$195 million payable within a month. In addition to this, US$247 million will be paid for the loan of artworks from the Louvre over a ten-year period, with a total of between two hundred and three hundred artworks expected. The Parisian Louvre will also be providing management advice to its Middle Eastern counterpart, at a cost of US$214.5 million. An additional US$253.5 million will be paid for various special art exhibitions. A total of four exhibitions will be hosted per year over a period of fifteen years. The city of Abu Dhabi will also make a direct donation of US$32.5 million to the Louvre to refurbish a wing of the Pavillon de Flore for the display of international art.  Controversies  = Motivations for the deal = The museum has sparked opposition to the expansion of the Louvre name in both artistic and academic circles in France. The opposition that has surfaced in France is led by art historian Didier Rykner, who is considered one of the most outspoken critics of the French‚ÄìEmirati museum deal. An online petition against the deal, signed by 4,650 curators, archaeologists and art historians, has insisted that French museums are not for sale. Klaus-Dieter Lehmann, the president of the Prussian Cultural Heritage Foundation, characterized the Louvre as behaving \\"like a corporation with a clearly-defined strategy: profit maximization.\\" According to the New York Times, Henri Loyrette, the president and director of the Louvre, responded to the criticism of the museum's policy of establishing footholds abroad, arguing that the Louvre cannot ignore the \\"internationalization\\" of museums. French minister of culture, Renaud Donnedieu de Vabres, vindicated the French government decision to expand the Louvre to Abu Dhabi explaining that it helps to enhance the image of France abroad as well as help invest in French culture through revenues made from the deal. The United Arab Emirates president Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan stated that the museum is a milestone in international cooperation and contributes to a longstanding friendly ties between France and the United Arab Emirates. = Treatment of construction workers = Human Rights Watch reported issues during construction of Louvre Abu Dhabi including the confiscation of workers passports resulting in forced labour conditions. High \\"recruitment loans\\" paid by migrant workers to construction companies still had not been repaid as of 2019, according to government-paid monitors. 86% of these fees were over $2,000. The Human Rights Watch report welcomed improvements in the law made by the UAE since their previous report in 2009 such as the introduction of minimum standards for workers accommodation. However, they added \\"the true test lies in the impact of these changes on workers\\" and suggested that if the abusive recruitment fees were not reimbursed by construction companies or the UAE government, the responsibility to repay them lies with the foreign sponsors who gave their names to the project such as the Louvre. Amid these reports, Jean Nouvel, the architect of Louvre Abu Dhabi defended the treatment of the construction workers, claiming that the conditions of construction workers were better than some European countries.

Young innocent Dong Zi (Shi Yu) is a pole carrier or coolie eking out a meager existence carrying heavy loads from place to place. His friend and roommate Gao Ping (Guo Tao) is from the same home village, but unlike Dong Zi, is older, more cynical, and has fallen into a life of petty crime. As the film begins, Gao has been cheated out of a small amount of money from a local gangster Su Wu (Wu Tao). Enraged, Gao drags his friend into Wuhan's underworld. Their first stop is a local bar, the Li Li Club where they go looking for Ruan Hong (Wang Tong), a Vietnamese singer who is said to know Su Wu. After speaking with her, Gao and Dong kidnap the young woman and drag her to their apartment. Gao asks Dong to leave the room after which he proceeds to rape her, while Dong peers through a crack in the door. Soon afterwards, however, Gao and Ruan suddenly become lovers, much to Dong Zi's surprise and consternation. As Gao and Ruan continue their relationship, Dong Zi becomes sullen and seemingly jealous, though it is unclear of whom. Later Ruan and Gao appear to get in a fight as Gao Ping continues to obsess over the small amount of money he has lost. Enraged, Ruan leaves the apartment with a curious Dong Zi in tow. The two talk throughout the night and Ruan reveals that she only wants to become a professional singer, though such dreams seem out of reach. She eventually returns to the apartment, but only to leave the phone number of Su Wu. Upon finding Su Wu, Gao beats and imprisons Su in a cellar before releasing him, after Su agrees to take him to his boss. What happens next is not shown on screen, though Dong Zi narrating explains that Gao Ping somehow became caught up in a scheme with Su Wu and his boss, leading to Gao murdering an unknown person. Tensions rise, however, when it is discovered that Ruan Hong is the kept woman of Su Wu's boss. Realizing the danger, Gao Ping disappears just as the boss and the police begin to close in on him. Secretly communicating with Ruan, Gao promises to take her away but fails to show up on the appointed day. Ruan is subsequently arrested when the Li Li Club is seized as a den of prostitution. When Gao finally comes back to his apartment, he is caught by the Boss whose men beat him to death. The film then ends as Ruan, now released from prison, returns to the apartment of Dong Zi and Gao Ping. For Dong Zi, she is the only person he knows in the city. They reminisce of the dead Gao, and Ruan thanks Dong Zi for \\"kidnapping\\" her that night. Before she leaves, Dong Zi gives her a Walkman with a tape of one of her songs.  Cast  *Shi Yu as Dong Zi, a na√Øve migrant dockworker. *Guo Tao as Gao Ping, Dong Zi's friend, a small-time criminal. *Wang Tong as Ruan Hong, a Vietnamese cabaret singer. *Wu Tao as Su Wu, a local gangster.  Production  Production for So Close to Paradise began while Wang Xiaoshuai was officially blacklisted. While Wang participated in self-criticisms and networking opportunities in an effort to be allowed to make films again, he was invited to join Tian Zhuangzhuang's production company to begin work on the screenplay of So Close to Paradise, then called The Girl from Vietnam.Berry, p. 171. During this period, the screenplay was vetted by both Beijing Film Studio executives and individual investors, who, while supportive of the film's portrayal of modern social reality, had some misgivings. This led to a shift in focus from the characters' sexual impulses to the general states of being. Wang had originally planned to begin shooting So Close to Paradise in June or July 1994 in Wuhan but was delayed until October due to continued bureaucracy problems between Wang and the state apparatus. As a result of the shift in season, filming of Paradise proved to be far more complicated in terms of logistics than Wang had initially anticipated. Combined with extensive edits to meet government censor approval and the production of the film stretched on for years. While the film was financed with official backing (in contrast to Wang's earlier films), its release was nevertheless delayed and its content subject to substantial censorship by the state apparatus. Indeed, it took nearly four years before the film was finally screened. Reasons for the problems have been speculated to revolve around both the film's gritty depiction of urban life, as well as the fact that a central character is Vietnamese. At one point, the Chinese Film Bureau (SARFT) argued that the film literally had a \\"funny smell,\\" which Wang attributed to the censors' general distaste with the film's depressing tone and subject matter.Berry, p. 172. When extensive edits to the film's \\"mood\\" failed to appease the censors, they eventually acquiesced and approved the film, in part because the process had dragged on so long.  Release and reception  Paradise was originally shown in mainland theaters in the fall of 1998 (nearly four years after production began), and was eventually shown in Hong Kong in December of that year (under the title Take Me Off) at the 1998 Mainland-Hong Kong-Taiwan Film Festival. Following Hong Kong, it reached foreign shores under the title of So Close to Paradise. The film received a Western premiere at the 1999 Cannes Film Festival as part of the Un Certain Regard competition. It would go on to win a Tiger Award for Best Film at the 2000 International Film Festival Rotterdam. Domestically, So Close to Paradise had a much more tortuous journey to cinemas. In an interview, Wang noted that as a result of the film's unusually long gestation period, promotion of the film proved near impossible. While a few cinemas may have received the film in 1998, no commercial release of So Close to Paradise took place. Rather, So Close to Paradise had to wait another six years to be commercially released in mainland China.Berry, pp. 164-65. Abroad, the film received generally positive reviews. A.O. Scott, of The New York Times, compared the film's noir qualities to fellow Sixth Generation director Lou Ye's Suzhou River, though he ultimately states that Paradise generally fails to engage the audience. At the same time, he showers praise on the film's technical aspects, stating that \\"Mr. Wang's extraordinary sense of color and composition reanimates some of its secondhand attitudes.\\" Derek Elley of Variety, generally praising both the cast performances (as \\"flavorful\\") and the more technical aspects of the film. The Hollywood Reporter, meanwhile, is generally negative in its review, arguing that the film's simplistic noir story lacks proper \\"execution\\" leaving it \\"heavy-handed and lethargic.\\"  References   External links   So Close to Paradise at the Chinese Movie Database Category:1998 films Category:Chinese films Category:Mandarin-language films Category:1990s crime drama films Category:Films set in Wuhan Category:Films directed by Wang Xiaoshuai Category:Chinese crime drama films Category:1998 drama films ","title":"So Close to Paradise"},{"id":"13651639","text":"The Committee of Concerned Journalists (CCJ) was a U.S. non-profit consortium of journalists, publishers, media owners, academics and citizens worried about the future of the profession.

It probably dates to the mid 16th century. Over the years, it has served as a family home for members of the Bain family, Clan Davidson, and Vickers family. The castle was used as a hospital after the evacuation of Dunkirk, and then as a hostel for the local education authority. It is currently used as a hotel and conference centre.  History  Tulloch Castle likely dates to the mid 16th century, when Duncan Bane (Bain, Bayne) was granted a charter of lands in 1542. The lands of Tulloch will be erected in free barony by King Charles II in favour of Sir Donald Bain of Tulloch in 1678 i In the 18th century however, ownership of the castle changed hands. Kenneth Bayne, 8th Laird and 5th baron of Tulloch, sold the estate to his cousin, Henry Davidson, in 1762. (Crown Charter by Georges III in favour of Henry Davidson, 6th baron of Tulloch, dated 23 frebruary 1763) On Henry's death in 1781 Tulloch was inherited by his younger brother Duncan Davidson, who was MP for Cromartyshire from 1790 to 1796.David R. Fisher, DAVIDSON, Duncan (1733-99), of Tulloch, Ross and Myles's, Ongar, Essex. in The History of Parliament: the House of Commons 1790-1820 (1986). He was in turn succeeded by his son Henry (1771‚Äì1827), grandson Duncan (1800‚Äì1881) and great-grandson Duncan Henry Caithness Reay Davidson (1836‚Äì1889),David R. Fisher, DAVIDSON, Duncan (?1800-1881), of Tulloch Castle, Dingwall, Ross. in The History of Parliament: the House of Commons 1820-1832 (2009). who was the father of the last Davidson of Tulloch, Duncan (1865‚Äì1917).Charles Mosley, Burke's Peerage, 107th edition (2003) vol. I, p. 1049, cited in Darryl Lundy, Duncan Davidson of Tulloch, thepeerage.com. Accessed 11 February 2013. The castle was damaged by fire in 1845, and extended in 1891. The castle passed out of Davidson ownership in 1917 when Duncan Davidson, 11th baron of Tulloch, died and left the castle and the barony to his daughter and her son, Colonel Angus Vickers, of the Vickers aircraft company. Architect Sir Robert Lorimer designed alterations in the early 1920s. After serving as the Vickers' family home for several years, and as a hospital for casualties of Dunkirk in 1940, Tulloch Castle was purchased by the local education authority in 1957. It was used as a hostel for students from the west coast of Scotland who were studying at Dingwall Academy until 1976. After this, the castle fell into disrepair until it was renovated and converted into a hotel by local family, the MacAulays, in 1996. It remains in use as a hotel and conference centre, and played host to the official Clan Davidson Gathering in October 2007. It is a category B listed building. When her uncle, Colonel Angus Vickers, 13th baron of Tulloch, died in 1990, Lady Phyllis Vickers inherited by disposition the barony. then the Willien family will obtain by assignation the title and the caput of the barony. She also has an entry in Burke's Peerage as a Scots feudal baron.  Supernatural reports  Tulloch castle is said to be haunted by a green lady and other ghosts. These supernatural claims were explored in the Grampian Television series Beyond Explanation in 2005. On 28 May 2008 it was reported that a 14-year-old boy named Connor Bond apparently took a photograph (with a digital camera) of a \\"hand\\" holding on to the stair railing with an apparition floating behind it.  The grounds and estate  Caisteal Gorach Tulloch Castle has many interesting features. A tunnel runs from the basement of the castle under the town of Dingwall to the old site of Dingwall Castle. The tunnel has now collapsed, but it is possible to view this passageway through an air vent on the front lawn of the castle‚Äôs grounds. There is a Davidson cemetery in the grounds of the castle for family members and pets. The graveyard is surrounded by a metal fence and has become overgrown, though some of its headstones are still visible. Originally, there were two walled gardens on either side of the castle. These are now overgrown and parts of them have become woods or have had houses built on them. The castle had two gatehouses and entrance paths. The former west gatehouse was situated at the foot of what is now Maggie's Drive and can be seen on old postcards of Dingwall and also OS maps from the late nineteenth and early twentieth century. Though the west gatehouse no longer exists the east gatehouse has survived and is currently a privately owned house. This gatehouse was built in 1876 and the path which connects it to the castle has become a public road. This road is still used as the main entrance to the castle today. On a hill to the north of the castle stands \\"Caisteal Gorach\\", a late 18th-century folly which was designed by Robert Adam for Duncan Davidson of Tulloch. The folly comprises a ruined round tower and flanking walls, and is a category A listed building.

The similarity matrix is provided as an input and consists of a quantitative assessment of the relative similarity of each pair of points in the dataset. In application to image segmentation, spectral clustering is known as segmentation-based object categorization.  Definitions  Given an enumerated set of data points, the similarity matrix may be defined as a symmetric matrix A, where A_{ij}\\\\geq 0 represents a measure of the similarity between data points with indices i and j. The general approach to spectral clustering is to use a standard clustering method (there are many such methods, k-means is discussed below) on relevant eigenvectors of a Laplacian matrix of A. There are many different ways to define a Laplacian which have different mathematical interpretations, and so the clustering will also have different interpretations. The eigenvectors that are relevant are the ones that correspond to smallest several eigenvalues of the Laplacian except for the smallest eigenvalue which will have a value of 0. For computational efficiency, these eigenvectors are often computed as the eigenvectors corresponding to the largest several eigenvalues of a function of the Laplacian. Spectral clustering is well known to relate to partitioning of a mass-spring system, where each mass is associated with a data point and each spring stiffness corresponds to a weight of an edge describing a similarity of the two related data points. Specifically, the classical reference J. Demmel, , CS267: Notes for Lecture 23, April 9, 1999, Graph Partitioning, Part 2 explains that the eigenvalue problem describing transversal vibration modes of a mass-spring system is exactly the same as the eigenvalue problem for the graph Laplacian matrix defined as : L:=D-A, where D is the diagonal matrix :D_{ii} = \\\\sum_j A_{ij}. The masses that are tightly connected by the springs in the mass-spring system evidently move together from the equilibrium position in low-frequency vibration modes, so that the components of the eigenvectors corresponding to the smallest eigenvalues of the graph Laplacian can be used for meaningful clustering of the masses. A popular related spectral clustering technique is the normalized cuts algorithm or Shi‚ÄìMalik algorithm introduced by Jianbo Shi and Jitendra Malik,Jianbo Shi and Jitendra Malik, \\"Normalized Cuts and Image Segmentation\\", IEEE Transactions on PAMI, Vol. 22, No. 8, Aug 2000. commonly used for image segmentation. It partitions points into two sets (B_1,B_2) based on the eigenvector v corresponding to the second-smallest eigenvalue of the symmetric normalized Laplacian defined as : L^\\\\text{norm}:=I-D^{-1/2}AD^{-1/2}. A mathematically equivalent algorithm Marina MeilƒÉ & Jianbo Shi, \\"Learning Segmentation by Random Walks\\", Neural Information Processing Systems 13 (NIPS 2000), 2001, pp. 873‚Äì879. takes the eigenvector corresponding to the largest eigenvalue of the random walk normalized adjacency matrix P = D^{-1}A. Knowing the eigenvectors, partitioning may be done in various ways, such as by computing the median m of the components of the second smallest eigenvector v, and placing all points whose component in v is greater than m in B_1, and the rest in B_2. The algorithm can be used for hierarchical clustering by repeatedly partitioning the subsets in this fashion.  Algorithms  If the similarity matrix A has not already been explicitly constructed, the efficiency of spectral clustering may be improved if the solution to the corresponding eigenvalue problem is performed in a matrix-free fashion (without explicitly manipulating or even computing the similarity matrix), as in the Lanczos algorithm. For large-sized graphs, the second eigenvalue of the (normalized) graph Laplacian matrix is often ill-conditioned, leading to slow convergence of iterative eigenvalue solvers. Preconditioning is a key technology accelerating the convergence, e.g., in the matrix-free LOBPCG method. Spectral clustering has been successfully applied on large graphs by first identifying their community structure, and then clustering communities. Spectral clustering is closely related to nonlinear dimensionality reduction, and dimension reduction techniques such as locally-linear embedding can be used to reduce errors from noise or outliers. Free software to implement spectral clustering is available in large open source projects like Scikit-learn http://scikit- learn.org/stable/modules/clustering.html#spectral-clustering using LOBPCG with multigrid preconditioning, or ARPACK, MLlib for pseudo-eigenvector clustering using the power iteration method,http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/mllib- clustering.html#power-iteration-clustering-pic and R.https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/kernlab  Relationship with k-means  The kernel k-means problem is an extension of the k-means problem where the input data points are mapped non-linearly into a higher-dimensional feature space via a kernel function k(x_i,x_j) = \\\\varphi^T(x_i)\\\\varphi(x_j). The weighted kernel k-means problem further extends this problem by defining a weight w_r for each cluster as the reciprocal of the number of elements in the cluster, : \\\\max_{\\\\\\\\{C_s\\\\\\\\}} \\\\sum_{r=1}^k w_r \\\\sum_{x_i,x_j \\\\in C_r} k(x_i,x_j). Suppose F is a matrix of the normalizing coefficients for each point for each cluster F_{ij} = w_r if i,j \\\\in C_r and zero otherwise. Suppose K is the kernel matrix for all points. The weighted kernel k-means problem with n points and k clusters is given as, : \\\\max_F \\\\operatorname{trace} (KF) such that : F = G_{n\\\\times k}G_{k\\\\times n}^T : G^TG = I such that \\\\operatorname{rank}(G) = k. In addition, there are identity constrains on F given by, : F\\\\cdot \\\\mathbb{I} = \\\\mathbb{I} where \\\\mathbb{I} represents a vector of ones. : F^T\\\\mathbb{I} = \\\\mathbb{I} This problem can be recast as, : \\\\max_G \\\\operatorname{trace}(G^TG). This problem is equivalent to the spectral clustering problem when the identity constraints on F are relaxed. In particular, the weighted kernel k-means problem can be reformulated as a spectral clustering (graph partitioning) problem and vice versa. The output of the algorithms are eigenvectors which do not satisfy the identity requirements for indicator variables defined by F. Hence, post-processing of the eigenvectors is required for the equivalence between the problems. Transforming the spectral clustering problem into a weighted kernel k-means problem greatly reduces the computational burden.  Relationship to DBSCAN  Spectral clustering is also related to DBSCAN clustering, that finds density- connected components. Connected components correspond to optimal spectral clusters (no edges cut); and DBSCAN uses an asymmetric neighbor graph with edges removed when source points are not dense. Thus, DBSCAN is a special case of spectral clustering, but one which allows more efficient algorithms (worst case O(n^2), in many practical cases much faster with indices).  Measures to compare clusterings  Ravi Kannan, Santosh Vempala and Adrian Vetta proposed a bicriteria measure to define the quality of a given clustering. They said that a clustering was an (Œ±, Œµ)-clustering if the conductance of each cluster (in the clustering) was at least Œ± and the weight of the inter-cluster edges was at most Œµ fraction of the total weight of all the edges in the graph. They also look at two approximation algorithms in the same paper.  Approximate solutions  Spectral clustering is computationally expensive unless the graph is sparse and the similarity matrix can be efficiently constructed. If the similarity matrix is an RBF kernel matrix, spectral clustering is expensive. There are approximate algorithms for making spectral clustering more efficient: power method, Nystrom method, etc. However, recent research pointed out the problems with spectral clustering with Nystrom method; in particular, the similarity matrix with Nystrom approximation is not elementwisely positive, which can be problematic.  History and related literatures Spectral clustering has a long history. Spectral clustering as a machine learning method was popularized by Shi & Malik and Ng, Jordan, & Weiss. Ideas and network measures related to spectral clustering also play an important role in a number of applications apparently different from clustering problems. For instance, networks with stronger spectral partitions take longer to converge in opinion-updating models used in sociology and economics.

It lies about 10 minutes from Annapolis, 25 minutes from Washington, District of Columbia, and 40 minutes from Baltimore. It lies directly next to Central Middle School. It was built in 1978 due to overcrowding at Arundel High School and Southern High School. It is the primary school for high school students from Edgewater, Davidsonville, Riva, and a small portion of Harwood. Students South River High School only has one feeder middle school, which is Central Middle School. Central Middle School has 4 feeder elementary schools: Central, Davidsonville, Edgewater, and Mayo. Prior to the opening of Crofton High School in 2020, half of the Crofton Middle School feeder system was also included in the South River High School feeder system. South River High School students from the Crofton area who were in grade 9 during the 2019-2020 school year will be relocated to Crofton High School in the fall of 2020. However, because Crofton High will only serve grades 9 and 10 during the 2020-2021 school year, Crofton area students who will be in grades 11 and 12 in the fall of 2020 will remain at South River High School. https://www.aacps.org/site/handlers/filedownload.ashx?moduleinstanceid=14405&dataid;=26965&FileName;=2020efmp.pdf It currently has 2,198 students currently enrolled, making it the largest public high school in Anne Arundel County (student body wise). It received a Blue Ribbon in education. South River has a great reputation throughout Maryland and is known as one of the best high schools in Anne Arundel County. In 2013, Newsweek ranked South River as one of the top 30 high schools in Maryland, and one of the top 1,000 in the country. The class of 2009 graduated with over $8.5 million in scholarships, and 5 senior students received Scholarships for Scholars from the Anne Arundel County Government. Members of the school's faculty have received awards from the Karen Gaffney Foundation, an organization promoting community service and excellence in special education programs. South River is Co-Ed and handicap accessible. The student body is 79% White, 7% Hispanic and Latino, 6% Black, 3% Asian, and 4% of South River students identify as being of two or more races. 11% of students receive free and reduced price meals.https://projects.propublica.org/miseducation/school/240006000055 Athletics South River competes in the Anne Arundel County Division of Maryland's 4A subdivision. South River has won many state championships, most recently in 2018, with girl's Varsity Lacrosse. In 2016 and 2017, Varsity Field Hockey won the championships. South River football has not won a county championship since 1986. The Seahawks last appeared in the playoffs in 2018, losing to North Point High School. South River won a state baseball championship in 2013, their first state championship ever and only their third regional championship. South River wrestling won their first regional championship in 2017. STEM Magnet Program South River features the STEM magnet program (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics). It was introduced in the fall of 2009, and students from other Anne Arundel County public high school districts can apply to the magnet program and attend South River if they get accepted by means of a lottery system and are assigned to a middle school that is included in South River‚Äôs STEM feeder system.

The trail follows the path of the Haw River from Haw River State Park on the Rockingham/Guilford County line to Jordan Lake State Recreation Area.  Land trail  About 20 miles of surface trails for hiking, mountain biking, birdwatching, nature lovers, and horse riding are currently open to the public along the Haw River Trail in locations including Haw River State Park, Swepsonville River Park, Glencoe, and Sellers Falls. Additional trails are expected to be built in order to complete the planned 70 mile trail. The land trail will follow the Haw River across Alamance from where it enters near Altamahaw, then around Burlington and Graham, through Swepsonville, and past Saxapahaw. For over a third of the stretch of the Haw River Trail, from Haw River State Park to the confluence with Cane Creek in Alamance County, it will combine with the North Carolina Mountains-to-Sea Trail (MST). The MST begins at Clingmans Dome on the State‚Äôs western border and terminates at Jockey's Ridge on the Outer Banks. Swepsonville had the honor of being first trail segment designated. Mayor Herring received a call from the MST meeting participants, as they had just voted to reroute the trail through his town. He put in the first request for MST designation, and the town park became the first on the Haw River with a MST designation in 2008, with the help of the State Trails Coordinator, Darrell McBane.  Paddle trail  The Haw River Paddle Trail is a part of the Haw River Trail providing access for canoeing and kayaking. The paddle trail has 10 access sites in Alamance County to include Altamahaw Ossipee, Shallow Ford Natural Area, Indian Valley Golf Club, Glencoe Paddle Access, Great Alamanace Creek on Hwy 87, Graham Paddle Access/Hwy 54, Saxapahaw Lake, Greensboro-Chapel Hill Road, and 4 accesses in Chatham County and 4 in Guilford County. Formal accesses are regularly maintained and patrolled and provide paddlers with the assurance that public access rights have been legally secured. Informal access sites are those that have been traditionally used by paddlers.  Conservation efforts  The Haw River Trail attempts to combine recreation and conservation goals into one effort. The Haw River Trail Partnership promotes the idea that the Haw River Trail boosts conservation efforts by increasing public awareness for the river and building a consensus for conservation. Simultaneously, the conservation work on the Haw River provides a protected landscape for the Haw River Trail. As of November, 2008, the HRT Partnership has conserved over of riverside property and of riverbank since 2006. In 2006, an innovative agreement was reached between 10 governmental agencies, referred to as a Memorandum of Understanding, in which the organizations agreed to work together for the development of the Haw River Trail and the conservation of its land and waters. A coordinator position is also funded by the cities of Burlington and Graham, as Alamance County to further conservation and recreation efforts on the Haw River.

The team showed great promise at the outset of the season but finished with a disappointing 46-78 record, placing last in the league. The league championship that year went to an Akron franchise, which closed the season with an 81-40 record.Spalding's Official Athletic Library Baseball Guide (New York: American Sports Publishing Co., 1910), p. 219.  Origins  The short- lived Youngstown Indians team succeeded other minor league clubs in Youngstown, Ohio, including the championship Youngstown Ohio Works and Youngstown Champs. The 1907 sale of the Ohio Works team to investors in Zanesville, Ohio, paved the way for the establishment of the Champs. Like the Ohio Works club, which won two consecutive league championships, the Champs were sponsored by local industrial leader Joseph A. McDonald and his brother, Thomas. The Champs won the 1907 championship of the Ohio‚ÄìPennsylvania League, but the following year, their season was cut short when the owners of the Youngstown franchise \\"threw up the sponge in mid-season\\". In 1909, the newly established Youngstown Indians secured the backing of a stock company in New Castle, Pennsylvania, and were managed by W.R. Terry.  Controversy  The challenges facing the Youngstown Indians reflected perennial difficulties within the Ohio‚ÄìPennsylvania League, including weak financial support for teams and uneven ticket sales. The Spalding Guide's Youngstown-based correspondent, W. A. Mason, noted that support for the league in that city had eroded because of the local club's poor performance. \\"Youngstown had the tailend team and the fans had been used to winning ball\\", Mason wrote. He added, however, that the league, \\"taking together the gate receipts and the moneys received from the sale and drafting of players\\", proved to be a \\"moneymaker\\" for the first time since its establishment. Despite its improved financial situation, the Ohio‚ÄìPennsylvania League narrowly escaped the prospect of dissolution late in the 1909 season. As the Spalding Guide reports, the league's unraveling was prevented only by the guidance of the league president, Sam L. Wright, who had earlier managed the Youngstown Champs. Toward the end of the season, Wright took the extraordinary step of backing the Youngstown Indians, when their New Castle owners \\"gave it up\\". This move preserved the eight-team league, which also included teams from Akron, East Liverpool, McKeesport, New Castle, Canton, and Steubenville.  Dissolution  At the close of the 1909 season, the club came under the co- ownership of former Indians manager Terry and business partner Paul Powers. Renamed as the Youngstown Steelmen, the team competed in the Ohio‚ÄìPennsylvania League during the 1910 and 1911 seasons. The Steelmen joined the Central League in 1912, and that year, narrowly lost the pennant to a rival franchise from Fort Wayne, Indiana, placing second in the league.Spalding's Official Athletic Library Baseball Guide (New York: American Sports Publishing Co., 1913), p. 190.

The school is located in the town of Penarth, south west from Cardiff. The school has approximately 2,000 pupils on the roll in years seven to thirteen with a thriving sixth form. Specialist teaching accommodation has been provided for science (featuring eleven modern laboratories), drama, music, media studies, P.E. (including sports halls and a playing field), Information Technology, Art and Design Technology Stanwell School was previously Penarth County Grammar School prior to becoming a comprehensive. History =A Victorian beginning= The school originally opened in 1897 as Penarth Grammar School during the rapid Victorian expansion of the Penarth, Cogan, Llandough and Dinas Powys areas following the building of Cardiff and Penarth docks to handle the burgeoning South Wales coal trade. Between 1891 and 1901 the population of the town expanded from 12,000 to over 15,000 people and the need for a new school was paramount. The now disused former girls entrance, to the original school building. The tall window to the right gave light to the school's main assembly hall School foundation stone, laid in 1894 by the founder's wife, the Baroness Windsor The school was established for both boys and girls at a time when most British grammar schools were single sex establishments and few girls were even expected to complete a grammar school education. However, within the school the sexes remained segregated during the working day with separate school entrances, classrooms, teaching staff and playground areas. The girls' curriculum included only reading, writing, arithmetic and sewing, but the boys instead studied the sciences, Latin and ancient Greek. All children left school at the age of fourteen until the educational reforms introduced by the Conservative government's Education Board President Rab Butler in his Education Act 1944. Initially the only building on the site was the original school building that still stands, facing onto Archer Road, the headmaster's private residence on the corner of Archer and Stanwell roads (later used as a home by the resident caretaker) and a small chapel building that was later converted into a physics laboratory during the 1940s. In the early years the school roll was bolstered by the children from Radyr, Morganstown, Whitchurch and Rhiwbina where there was no secondary school. The nine mile steam train journey to Penarth Grammar and St Cyres Secondary Modern was easier and quicker than the road journey to any closer Cardiff schools. Penarth served the County of Glamorgan, whereas Cardiff schools only served those within the city limits. The situation only changed in 1968 when Radyr's own secondary school was built and the direct rail link was removed by the Beeching Axe. With the introduction of comprehensive schools, there was no further need to travel outside Cardiff to the County Grammar School. During the second world war, the school took in evacuees from other parts of the UK. Pupils from Whitchurch continued to travel from Cardiff despite air raids and bombing. There was also a barrage balloon unit posted on the playing field, and pupils were allocated local houses to run to in the event of an air raid. =20th century= The main entrance Penarth's town rugby pitch had been dug up and used for growing vegetables by local residents during First World War food shortages, so between 1919 and 1924 the traditional annual Good Friday rugby matches between Penarth RFC and the BarbariansBaBa History were staged instead on the grammar school's playing field, when most of the town's population turned up to watch and cheer. In the autumn of 1924 the new Athletic Ground on Lavernock Road, a gift to the town by the Earl of Plymouth, was opened and the Good Friday matches were moved to their new home the following year. In 1960 the previously segregated sexes were combined into a co-educational school that was renamed as Penarth County Grammar School but the increasing school population had far expanded beyond the available accommodation and a large number of temporary portakabin buildings were added and increasingly built across the original playgrounds and playing fields. These temporary buildings included a gymnasium (1955), chemistry and biology(1952) laboratories, domestic science (now food technology) kitchen, woodwork and metalwork shops, several ranges of classrooms and a toilet block. Originally planned to last no longer than ten years, many of the temporary buildings remained in use well into the 1980s and 1990s. In 1971 the local authority funded the building of a new youth club on the school site, near the Stanwell Road side entrance, called Penarth Youth Wing and the facility was utilised by the school during the day as additional accommodation for music and drama classes. =Developments= A small section of the 1990s additions Entry to the school in the early years had been by 11-plus examination. However, in the late 1960s a Labour government led educational reform, through several ministerial directives and eventually the Education Reform Act 1968,Education Reform Act that was accepted and implemented by the education authority, scrapped the Eleven-Plus examination and with it the segregated tripartite strata of grammar, technical grammar and secondary modern schools. In 1970 the school became a co-educational comprehensive and renamed as Stanwell Comprehensive School. Between 1990 and 1998 Stanwell was a grant maintained schoolGrant maintained operating under direct government funding and effecting its own student selection process, outside the normal procedures of the local education authority. It was during this period of grant maintained status that investment was made into providing new school buildings. The grant maintained system ceased in 1998 under the new Labour government and, renamed again as Stanwell School, it now has foundation status within the education authority but with autonomous school governors controlling admissions to the school, employing the school's staff and owning the school's estate. Performing Arts In recent years the school has hosted several dramatic and musical presentations including Jesus Christ Superstar, Alice in Wonderland and Cabaret. The school was the first in Europe to perform the School Edition of Les Mis√©rables in 2002, and the first in the UK to perform The Phantom of the Opera in December 2011, in celebration of the musical's 25th anniversary. The theatre and auditorium is equipped with a range of musical instruments. The latest lighting systems are installed in the auditorium and other performance areas. The Drama department also took part in the Royal National Theatre Youth Connection where pupils in years 10-13 performed a newly commissioned production entitled Success by playwright Nick Drake at the school, followed by a performance at the Wales Millennium Centre on 9 April 2009. Other schools also perform in Stanwell's auditorium, such as Albert Primary School with their production of Annie in 2009 and their production of Hairspray in 2010.

Buses transport pupils from Sully. Pupils are drawn from the full range of abilities. =Results= Stanwell's 2008 A level results broke previous school records with 22 students achieving four A grades or better, with the top nine students achieving five grade As or better. One quarter of Stanwell pupils achieved three A grades or better, with the average points score per pupil exceeding three A grades (81 points per student). =Sixth Form= At sixteen years of age, most pupils choose to remain at the school to continue with their studies in the sixth form. Stanwell has over 400 6th form students, over 95% of which also studied GCSEs at the school at Key stage 4. To be eligible for 6th form, a student must have achieved at least 5 A*-C grades at GCSE. The school has undergone building work to create a (approximately) 15x20m 'study area' for the upper-sixth form. A high proportion of students go on to continue their studies at university.

Rather than being a structural feature, the primary aim of close studding is to produce an impressive front.Looking at Buildings (Pevsner Architectural Guides): Close Studding (accessed 20 October 2017) Close studding first appeared in England in the 13th century and was commonly used there from the mid-15th century until the end of the 17th century. It was also common in France from the 15th century. Description Close studding with (right) and without (left) middle rail. Braces are not shown Although close studding is defined by the distance between the vertical timbers, the spacing used is variable, up to a maximum of around 2 feet (600 mm). Studs can either span the full height of the storey or be divided by a middle (or intermediate) rail. To give the frame stability, some form of diagonal bracing is required. Limewash and coloured paints would have been used to enhance the pattern. History and usage The use of close studding possibly originated in East Anglia, where the technique was employed in the earliest surviving timber walls thought to date from the early 13th century. Among the earliest examples outside East Anglia are St Michael's Church, Baddiley in Cheshire (1308)Images of England: Church of St. Michael (accessed 9 October 2007) and Mancetter Manor in Warwickshire (c. 1330). It became fashionable in England around 1400, and by the middle of the 15th century close studding was widely used across that country.Harris, 2003, pp. 22‚Äì25 Its popularity coincided with the dominance of the Perpendicular style of architecture, with its emphasis on verticals. Close studding remained in common use in England until the end of the 17th century. Close-studded buildings dating from the 15th and 16th centuries are also seen in France,Hartills Art 2004: Section Two ‚Äì Medieval (accessed 10 October 2007)Hartills Art 2004: Section Three ‚Äì Renaissance Architecture (accessed 10 October 2007) and some experts believe the technique might have originated there.Currie CRJ. 'The age of carpentry: the new art and society in Plantagenet England' (2001) (accessed 10 October 2007) Close studding is very common in the Normandy region of France. St Michael's Church, Baddiley, one of the oldest surviving close-studded buildings Compared with square framing, close studding uses a lot of timber and is time consuming to construct; it was therefore particularly employed for buildings of relatively high status. Public buildings such as guildhalls, market halls, churches and inns often employed close studding. It was also used for private houses of the wealthy, particularly townhouses but also the more prosperous farmhouses. Close studding was not usually employed in outbuildings, although occasional examples exist, such as the Gunthwaite Hall barn in Barnsley.Images of England: Gunthwaite Hall barn (accessed 10 October 2007) Although most examples occur in entirely timber-framed buildings, close studding was also used on the upper storeys of houses with a stone or brick ground storey; examples include the Dragon Hall in Norwich and the Caf√© 'Cave St-Vincent' in Compi√®gne, France. With its lavish use of timber, close studding was extravagant and was seen as a status symbol.Russell P. 'Timber framed buildings and roofs' The Building Conservation Directory, 1993 (accessed 11 October 2007) This led to it being faked with paint or even cosmetic planking. The heavy timber consumption probably also contributed to the decline in the use of close studding from the end of the 17th century, with a reduced supply of domestic hardwood as well as increased competition for timber.Harris, 2003, p. 83 Variations Guildhall, Lavenham, an example of close studding of the East Anglia school Regional variation occurred across England in the use of the middle rail, which was common in the midlands but rare in the east and south east.Harris, 2003, pp. 60‚Äì63 Variation in bracing is also seen. Some close-studded buildings, mainly dated before the mid-16th century, have arch or tension bracing to the exterior; examples include the Guildhall in LavenhamMcKenna, 1994, p. 8 and the Chantry House in Bunbury.McKenna, 1994, pp. 6‚Äì7 In later use, however, braces were usually constructed on the interior and concealed by plaster panelling. Close studding was sometimes used in association with decorative panel work or close panelling, particularly from the end of the 16th century.Price S, Molyneux N. 'The domestic timber-framed tradition', p. 38, in Brooks & Pevsner, 2007 In such buildings, the lower storey would usually employ close studding, while the upper storeys would have small square panels with or without ornamentation. Examples include the White Lion in Congleton and Moat Farm in Longdon. An ornamental effect was also sometimes obtained with herringbone or chevron bracing between the uprights.McKenna, 1994, p. 32 Selected examples Good examples of the various forms of the technique include: =Churches= *Church of St James and St Paul, Marton, Cheshire: close studding with middle rail (c. 1370)Images of England: Church of St James and St Paul (accessed 10 October 2007) *St Michael's Church, Baddiley, Cheshire: the chancel has close studding without a middle rail, with later brick infill (1308)McKenna, 1994, p. 45 *St Michael and All Angels Church, Altcar, West Lancashire: mostly close studded with middle rail (a much later example of 1879)Images of England: Church of St Michael and All Saints, Altcar (accessed 21 March 2008) *St Peter's Church, Melverley, Shropshire: close studding with middle rail (late 15th century)Images of England: Church of St. Peter (accessed 10 October 2007) =Inns and caf√©s= *Bear's Head Hotel, Brereton, Cheshire: close studding with two rails (1615)McKenna, 1994, p. 41Images of England: The Bear's Head Hotel (accessed 9 October 2007) *Caf√© 'Cave St-Vincent', Compi√®gne, France: close studding with braces on upper storey over brick ground floor with stone trimming (15th century)Scholars Resource: Caf√© 'Cave St.-Vincent' (accessed 10 October 2007) *Crown Hotel, Nantwich, Cheshire: close studding on all three storeys with middle rail (c. 1584)McKenna, 1994, p. 18Images of England: Crown Inn & Coffee House Cafe (accessed 9 October 2007) *String of Horses Inn, originally at Frankwell, Shrewsbury, Shropshire, now at Avoncroft Museum of Historic Buildings: close studding with middle rail on both ground and first storeys (1576)Images of England: The String of Horses (accessed 9 October 2007) *White Lion, Congleton, Cheshire: lower storey has close studding, with decorative panelling above (early 16th century)Images of England: Ye Olde White Lion Public House (accessed 9 October 2007) *The Falcon, Chester, Cheshire, formerly a town house, now a public house, which has close studding on its east front at the level of the Chester Rows. =Private houses= *Chantry House, Bunbury, Cheshire: very close studding, with tension braces and arch bracing and no middle rail.

It displays objects from the collections of the Mus√©e du Louvre that are lent to the gallery on a medium- or long-term basis. The Louvre-Lens annex is part of an effort to provide access to French cultural institutions for people who live outside of Paris. Though the museum maintains close institutional links with the Louvre, it is primarily funded by the Nord-Pas-de-Calais region. History The Ministry of Culture and the Louvre Directorate launched a plan, in 2003, to build a Louvre satellite museum in one of the 22 Regions of France. Only the Nord pas de Calais applied for the museum and proposed six cities: Lille, Lens, Valenciennes, Calais, B√©thune and Boulogne-sur-Mer. In 2004, Jean-Pierre Raffarin, then French Prime Minister, announced Lens as the recipient city. The museum site was chosen in hopes of reversing the fortunes of the depressed Lens mining community, which was devastated by both World Wars and the Nazi occupation, and suffered multiple mining catastrophes including the Courri√®res mine disaster, the worst in European history, and a 1974 tragedy killing 42 miners. The last mine in Lens closed in 1986, which caused the unemployment rate to rise well above the French national average. \\"France abandoned us when the coal stopped, and we became a ghost town\\", said Pas-de-Calais president Daniel Percheron. Officials took inspiration from the economic transformation of the Spanish industrial city of Bilbao, which was caused, in part, by the construction of the Guggenheim Museum Bilbao satellite (dubbed the \\"Bilbao effect\\", though some cautioned that the comparison is limited due to the much smaller population of Lens, and its lack of other tourist attractions.) Some Lens locals were critical of the project; they felt that the project to bring culture to their city was \\"patronizing\\". Other critics pointed out that the museum makes no attempt to address Lens's turbulent history or its current economic difficulties. A worldwide design contest was won by Japanese architectural firm SANAA in collaboration with New York firm Imrey Culbert, French landscape architect Catherine Mosbach, and museographer Studio Adrien Gard√®re. The Louvre-Lens Museum, SANAA + Imrey Culbert's first building in France, was awarded the Prix d'architecture de l'Equerre d'Argent for 2013. The Louvre- Lens is near several World War memorials, including the Canadian National Vimy Memorial in Vimy, approximately 15 minutes from the Louvre-Lens. Museum =Architecture= The reception hall The museum is built on a mining site that closed in the 1960s. The area is slightly elevated due to filling in of the mine. To make the building blend into the surrounding area, the architects designed a string of five low-profile structures; the central one is square with glass walls and the others are rectangular with polished, aluminum facades that gave a blurry reflection of the surroundings. Altogether, the museum is long and contains of exhibition space. The design of a central building flanked by two wings mimics the Paris Louvre. The square, central building is the main reception area. It contains several curved glass rooms that contain a cafeteria, bookstore and museum boutique. To the east of the entry hall is the Galerie du Temps which houses approximately 200 items from the Paris Louvre collection. The items in the large, open hall are arranged chronologically, from 3,500 BC to the mid-19th century, regardless of style or country of origin. Beyond the Galerie du Temps is the Pavillon de Verre which exhibits works from neighboring museums. The building to the west of the entry hall is a gallery for temporary exhibits (the Exhibitions Temporaires) and, beyond that, an auditorium. The Gallery du Temps = Temporary exhibits = The Exhibitions Temporaires is dedicated to exhibits which last 3 months. The first exhibition, titled Renaissance, included Leonardo da Vinci's recently restored The Virgin and Child with St. Anne. The second exhibit was dedicated to Rubens and included 170 of his works. Inauguration, opening and visitors On Dec 4, 2012, President Fran√ßois Hollande, alongside first lady Val√©rie Trierweiler, the Minister of Culture Aur√©lie Filippetti, the director of Le Louvre Henri Loyrette, the mayor of Lens Guy Delcourt, and former prime ministers Lionel Jospin and Pierre Mauroy officially opened the Louvre-Lens. The following weekend, the museum welcomed its first visitors; three weeks after the opening, the museum welcomed its 100,000th visitor. In May 2013, during Long Night of Museums 2013, 500,000 visitors viewed the masterpieces displayed in the Louvre-Lens Museum. While visitors were anticipated for the first year (while admission was free), the year's final tally was approximately . On Feb 7 2013, a woman vandalized a major masterpiece of the museum, Liberty Guiding the People, writing \\"AE911\\" on it with a black marker, possibly a reference to a group calling itself \\"Architects & Engineers for 9/11 Truth\\".

Taiwanese scholar Lu Chien-jung described this event as \\"a war that determined the fate of Taiwan in the four hundred years that followed\\".  Prelude  From 1623 to 1624 the Dutch had been at war with Ming China over the Pescadores. In 1633 they clashed with a fleet led by Zheng Zhilong in the Battle of Liaoluo Bay, ending in Dutch defeat. By 1632 the Dutch had established a post on a peninsula named Tayoan (now Anping District of Tainan), which was separated from the main part of Formosa by a shallow lagoon historically referred to as the . The Dutch fortifications consisted of two forts along the bay: the first and main fortification was the multiple-walled Fort Zeelandia, situated at the entrance to the bay, while the second was the smaller Fort Provintia, a walled administrative office. Frederick Coyett, the governor of Taiwan for the Dutch East India Company, was stationed in Fort Zeelandia with 1,800 men, while his subordinate, Valentyn, was in charge of Fort Provintia and its garrison of 500 men. In 1659, after an unsuccessful attempt to capture Nanjing, Koxinga, son of Zheng Zhilong and leader of the Ming loyalist remnants, felt that the Qing Empire had consolidated their position in China sufficiently, while his troops needed more supplies and manpower. He began searching for a suitable location as his base of operations, and soon a Chinese man named He Bin (), who was working for the Dutch East India Company in Formosa (Taiwan), fled to Koxinga's base in Xiamen and provided him with a map of Taiwan.  The siege  The surrender of Fort Zeelandia Peace Treaty of 1662, between Dutch Governor and Koxinga. On 23 March 1661, Koxinga's fleet set sail from Kinmen (Quemoy) with hundreds of junks of various sizes, with roughly 25,000 soldiers and sailors aboard. They arrived at Penghu the next day. On 30 March, a small garrison was left at Penghu while the main body of the fleet left and arrived at Tayoan on April 2. On Baxemboy Island in the Bay of Taiwan, unrelated to the siege, 2,000 Chinese attacked 240 Dutch musketeers, routing them. After passing through a shallow waterway unknown to the Dutch, they landed at the bay of '. Four Dutch ships attacked the Chinese junks and destroyed several but one of their own squadron was burnt by fire boats. The rest escaped from the harbor, two to return, while the third sailed for Batavia, not reaching her destination until after some fifty days owing to the south monsoon. No further opposition was for the time encountered.

On April 4, Valentyn surrendered to Koxinga's army after it laid siege to Fort Provintia. The rapid assault had caught Valentyn unprepared since he was under the impression that the fort was under the protection of Fort Zeelandia. On April 7, Koxinga's army surrounded Fort Zeelandia, sending the captured Dutch priest Antonius Hambroek as emissary demanding the garrison's surrender. However, Hambroek urged the garrison to resist instead of surrender and was executed after returning to Koxinga's camp. Koxinga ordered his artillery to advance and used 28 cannons to bombard the fort. Koxinga's fleet then began a massive bombardment; troops on the ground attempted to storm the fort, but were repulsed with considerable losses. Koxinga then changed his tactics and laid siege to the fort. On the 28th of May, news of the siege reached Jakarta, and the Dutch East India Company dispatched a fleet of 10 ships and 700 sailors to relieve the fort. On July 5, the relief force arrived and engaged in small scale confrontations with Koxinga's fleet. On July 23, the two sides gave major battle as the Dutch fleet attempted to break Koxinga's blockade. A second, ultimately unsuccessful attempt at relief was mounted in October. The Dutch tried to bombard the Chinese position with their ships, but their shots were too high and missed their target, giving the Chinese gunners time to prepare and return fire. Meanwhile the smaller Dutch ships engaged the Chinese junks, which lured them into a narrow strait with a false withdrawal. The Dutch ships were unable to get away as the wind had died and they were forced to paddle their boats, but the Chinese caught them and massacred the crew on board and used pikes to kill those who jumped overboard. The Chinese caught Dutch grenades in nets and threw them back at the Dutch. The Dutch flagship Koukercken ran aground right in front of an enemy cannon placement and was sunk. Another ship was stranded and its crew fled to Fort Zeelandia. The remaining Dutch fleet was forced to retreat with two ships sunk, three smaller vessels captured, and 130 casualties. Coyet remarked on the accuracy of Chinese cannon bombardment against Dutch gun emplacements on the fort. Explosive landmines were used by Koxinga against Dutch musketeers. In October, several dozen Dutch troops raided a nearby island for provisions. The raid took a disastrous turn when they encountered a small group of Chinese soldiers. They tried to flee, but suffered heavy casualties, losing 36 men. In December, deserting German mercenaries brought Koxinga word of low morale among the garrison, and he launched a major assault on the fort, which was ultimately repelled. In January 1662, a German sergeant named Hans Jurgen Radis defected to give Koxinga critical advice on how to capture the fortress from a redoubt whose strategic importance had gone hitherto unnoticed by the Chinese forces. Koxinga followed his advice and the Dutch redoubt fell within a day. This claim of a defector appears in a post hoc account of the siege written by Frederick Coyett, whom scholars have noted sought to absolve the author of responsibility for the defeat. A Swiss soldier also writes about the betrayal independently. Ming records make no mention of any defector or German named Hans Jurgen Radis. Koxinga deployed cannons his uncle had dredged up years earlier from the sea. The Ming dynasty had in the past dispatched work crews to salvage cannons from European shipwrecks and reverse engineer them. On 12 January 1662, Koxinga's fleet initiated another bombardment, while the ground force prepared to assault the fort. With supplies dwindling and no sign of reinforcement, Coyett finally ordered the hoisting of the white flag and negotiated terms of surrender, a process that was finalized on February 1. On the 9th of February, the remaining Dutch East India Company personnel left Taiwan; all were allowed to take with them their personal belongings, as well as provisions sufficient for them to reach the nearest Dutch settlement. =Torture= Torture was used by both sides in the war. One Dutch physician carried out a vivisection on a Chinese prisoner. The Chinese amputated the genitals, noses, ears, and limbs of Dutch prisoners while they were still alive and sent back the mutilated corpses and prisoners to the Dutch. Chinese rebels had earlier cut the genitals, eyes, ears and noses of Dutch people in the Guo Huaiyi rebellion. The mouths of Dutch soldiers were filled with their amputated genitals by the Chinese who also slammed nails into their bodies, and amputated their noses, legs and arms and sent the bodies of these Dutch soldiers back to the fort. =Taiwanese Aborigines= The Taiwanese aboriginal tribes, who were previously allied with the Dutch against the Chinese during the Guo Huaiyi Rebellion in 1652, turned against the Dutch during the siege. They defected to Koxinga's Chinese forces. The aboriginals (Formosans) of Sincan defected to Koxinga after he offered them amnesty. They proceeded to work for the Chinese in executing captured Dutchmen. On 17 May 1661, the frontier aboriginals in the mountains and plains also surrendered and defected to the Chinese. They celebrated their freedom from compulsory education under the Dutch rule by hunting down Dutch colonists and beheading them, while destroying their Christian school textbooks. Koxinga formulated a plan to give oxen, farming tools, and teach farming techniques to the Taiwan Aboriginals. He gave them Ming gowns and caps, provided feasts for chieftains and gifted tobacco to Aboriginals who were gathered in crowds to meet and welcome him as he visited their villages after he defeated the Dutch.  Aftermath  After arriving in Batavia, Coyett was imprisoned for three years and tried for high treason, for surrendering the post and the loss of valuable goods. After lobbying by friends and relatives he was partially pardoned in 1674, and exiled to the most eastern of the Banda Islands. He published Neglected Formosa () in 1675, a book in which he defended his actions in Taiwan and criticized the company for neglecting his pleas for reinforcement. After the loss of the post at Tayoan, the Dutch East India Company mounted several attempts at recapture‚Äîeven forming an alliance with the Qing Empire to defeat Koxinga's fleet. The alliance captured Keelung in northern Taiwan, but was forced to abandon it because of logistical difficulties and the inferiority of the Qing fleet when pitted against Koxinga's veteran sailors. =Dutch prisoners= During the Siege of Fort Zeelandia the Chinese took many Dutch prisoners, among them the Dutch missionary Antonius Hambroek and his wife, and two of their daughters. Koxinga sent Hambroek to Fort Zeelandia to persuade the garrison to surrender; if unsuccessful, Hambroek would be killed upon return. Hambroek went up to the Fort, where two of his other daughters still remained, and urged the garrison to not surrender. He subsequently returned to Koxinga's camp and was beheaded. Additionally, a rumor was spread among the Chinese that the Dutch were encouraging the native Taiwan aboriginals to kill Chinese. In retaliation, Koxinga ordered the mass execution of Dutch male prisoners, mostly by crucifixion and decapitation with a few women and children also being killed. The remainder of the Dutch women and children were enslaved, with Koxinga taking Hambroek's teenage daughter as his concubine (she was described by the Dutch commander Caeuw as \\"a very sweet and pleasing maiden\\", while other Dutch women were sold to Chinese soldiers to become their (secondary) wives or mistresses. The daily journal of the Dutch fort recorded that \\"the best were preserved for the use of the commanders, and the rest were sold to the common soldiers. Happy was she that fell to the lot of an unmarried man, being thereby freed from vexations by the Chinese women, who are very jealous of their husbands.\\" The Chinese took Dutch women as slave concubines and wives and they were never freed: in 1684 some were reported to be still living. In Quemoy a Dutch merchant was contacted with an arrangement to release the prisoners which was proposed by a son of Koxinga's but it came to nothing. The Chinese taking Dutch women as concubines was featured in Joannes Nomsz's famous play \\"Antonius Hambroek, of de Belegering van Formoza\\" (\\"Antonius Hambroek, or the Siege of Formosa\\"), which documented European anxieties at the fate of the Dutch women and defeat by non-Europeans.  Cultural influences  The battle was depicted in the movie The Sino-Dutch War 1661 (), which ended in Koxinga's victory over the Dutch.

In 1879, the company name was changed to Reeves & Company (abbreviated Reeves & Co.). At the same time as Marshal Reeves' brother Milton began making automobiles, in 1895, Reeves & Co. went into the steam engine business. They made engines in sizes from 13 HP to 40 HP (Nominal Horsepower). The company built steam plowing engines for the American and Canadian West and provided an engine and boiler approved by Provinces of Alberta and Saskatchewan. These new engines fulfilled these provinces' revised boiler laws enacted in 1910. There, steam breaking plows were needed to till the virgin soil. The massive 40-120 (and later 140) HP engines were brought out in 1908 and their two stories height allowed the driver (engineer) to see over the cross-compound engine. They built engines in nominal horsepower sizes: 13 hp, 16 hp, 20 hp, 25 hp, 32 hp and 40 hp.

Similar to this, within media studies the central mediating factor of a given culture is the medium of communication itself. The popular conception of mediation refers to the reconciliation of two opposing parties by a third, and this is similar to its meaning in both Marxist theory and media studies. For Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels, this mediating factor is capital or alternately labor,Marx, Karl and Frederick Engels. \\"The German Ideology.\\" Ed. C. J. Arthur. New York: International Publishers, 1973. depending on how one views capitalist society (capital is the dominant mediating factor, but labor is another mediating factor that could overthrow capital as the most important one). To give a concrete example of this, a worker making shoes in a shoe factory is not only producing shoes, but potential exchange-value. The shoes are commodities that can be sold for cash. In this way, the value of the labor of the worker is the exchange-value of the shoes he or she produces minus his or her compensation. At the same time, however, the shoes produced have certain social or cultural values as well. In this way, the worker's labor is mediating between the economic or exchange-value of the shoes, and their social or cultural, or symbolic value. In media studies, thinkers like Marshall McLuhan treat \\"the medium is the message\\" or the medium of a given social object (such as a book, CD, or television show) as the touchstone for both the cultural and material elements of the society in which this object exists.McLuhan, Marshall. \\"Understanding Media: The Extensions of Man.\\" Cambridge: MIT Press, 1994. McLuhan is famous for critiquing the different types of cultural and material processes that are made available between print media (like books and magazines) and electronic media like television, radio, and film. While print requires thinking that is linear, chronological, and separate from the thinking of others, electronic media are considered more organic, simultaneous, and interdependent on other media and on other users of that media. Many thinkerssuch as \\"Marxism And Media Studies: Key Concepts and Contemporary Trends\\" by Mike Wayne; \\"Media Ecologies: Materialist Energies in Art and Technoculture\\" by Matthew Fuller; \\"Media and Cultural Studies\\" by Meenakshi Gigi Durham and Douglas Kellner; \\"Marxism and Communication Studies: The Point Is to Change It\\" edited by Lee Artz, Steve Macek, and Dana L. Cloud; and \\"Hypercapitalism: New Media, Language, and Social Perceptions of Value\\" by Phil Graham are now considering how Marxist theory affects the way we think of media and vice versa, at the same time that new media are becoming a major form of communication. Contemporary media theorists often use elements of Marxist theory, such as mediation, to look at how new media affect social relations and lifestyles through their ability to communicate images, sounds, and other forms of information across the globe at incredible speeds.  Mediation in Marxism  The problem of mediation in Marxism is also referred to as the problem of determination, or namely how social actors navigate the social structures that bind them. For Marx, the primary form of mediation is labor, which forms a dialectical relationship between a worker's body and nature. Labor thus mediates between humans and the natural world. Once labor becomes reified, or made into an abstraction that becomes a commodity, however, it becomes alienated from the worker who owns it and becomes exchangeable just like any other commodity. Once this occurs, capital becomes the mediating or determining factor, with the capitalist setting the wage rate or exchange-value of labor. The only thing the worker owns in this case, his or her labor power or ability to work, becomes the worker's sole means of subsistence. The worker must get as much value from his or her labor as is possible on the open market in order to survive. A major theme in Marxism is the problem of mediation or determination: what amount of agency does labor have in light of the determining forces of a given culture. Implicit in this is the underlying fact that labor is itself worth something, and thus the mediator is actually money, be it access to money or its possession. All arenas of conflict are mediated by how money acts as a primary determining agent in the outcome of that struggle. As James Arnt Aune has reflected, questions that arise concerning this problem include: ‚ÄúHow do institutions, practices, and messages shape class formation? What alternative institutions, practices, and messages are available to those who wish to reshape class formations within the framework of structural possibilities?‚Äù (46). The question of mediation, then, is a question, as Aune puts it, of how Marxist theory mediates ‚Äústructural possibilities and popular struggle‚Äù (46). Aune, James Arnt. Rhetoric and Marxism. Boulder: Westview Press, 1994. =Marx and Engels = For Marx and Friedrich Engels, social actors are caught in a cycle of mediation between the economic base of a culture and the ideas and value systems of the culture that is given rise to by this base. Thus, as he famously formulated in The German Ideology: > The ideas of the ruling class are in every epoch the ruling ideas, i.e. the > class which is the ruling material force of society, is at the same time its > ruling intellectual force. The class which has the means of material > production at its disposal, has control at the same time over the means of > mental production, so that thereby, generally speaking, the ideas of those > who lack the means of mental production are subject to it. The ruling ideas > are nothing more than the ideal expression of the dominant material > relationships, the dominant material relationships grasped as ideas; hence > of the relationships which make the one class the ruling one, therefore, the > ideas of its dominance. (64)Marx, Karl and Frederick Engels. The German > Ideology. Ed. C. J. Arthur. New York: International Publishers, 1973. For Marx and Engels, then, the ruling classes control the subordinate classes through domination of the ideas available in the culture. In this way the subordinate classes are said to be mediated by the effects of ideology, or ‚Äúfalse consciousness‚Äù or a belief system that doesn't allow them to see the oppression they are enduring for what it is. The problem with this idea, as many Marxists have noted, is that it doesn't leave room for members of the subordinate classes to act on the world around them through alternate forms of mediation. = Antonio Gramsci = Later Marxists such as Gramsci would problematize this notion of ideology or false consciousness by studying the ways that workers operate during periods of ‚Äúorganic crisis,‚Äù or those times when social classes become detached from their traditional parties and a violent overthrow of the ruling classes is possible. Seeking to describe the ways that governments regain control of these classes during such periods of unrest, Gramsci developed the idea of hegemony, a process by which social actors within the ruling classes convince subordinate classes to consent to their own oppression once again: > The traditional ruling class, which has numerous trained cadres, changes men > and programmes and, with greater speed than is achieved by the subordinate > classes, reabsorbs the control that was slipping from its grasp. Perhaps it > may take sacrifices, and expose itself to an uncertain future by demagogic > promises; but it retains power, reinforces it for the time being, and uses > it to crush its adversary and disperse his leading cadres. (210-11)Gramsci, > Antonio. Selections from the Prison Notebooks. New York: International > Publishers, 1971. Unfortunately, Gramsci died before he could completely articulate how hegemony mediates the subordinate classes in periods of relative calm or how to work against the powers of the ruling classes as exerted in this way. Importantly, however, he had vastly complicated the ways that later Marxists would think about mediation: as a means of persuasion utilized by the ruling classes, rather than as complete control of the available ideas within a given culture (ideology). =Cultural materialism = The work of Raymond Williams and other members of the Birmingham Center for British Cultural Studies would further extend the notion of mediation in cultural materialism. For Williams, this notion should connote a social actor's position in relation to co-determining aspects of a social formation, or a multitude of pressures and limits that are always changing and being changed by the social actor. Thus, for Williams: > \\"Society\\" is then never only the \\"dead husk\\" which limits social and > individual fulfillment. It is always a constitutive process with very > powerful pressures which are both expressed in political, economic, and > cultural formations and, to take the full weight of \\"constitutive,\\" are > internalized and become \\"individual wills.\\" Determination of this whole > kind‚Äîa complex and interrelated process of limits and pressures‚Äîis in the > whole social process itself and nowhere else: not in an abstracted \\"mode of > production\\" nor in an abstracted \\"psychology.\\" (87)Williams, Raymond. > Marxism and Literature. Oxford: Oxford UP, 1977. Under this guise, mediation becomes a process of lived reality whereas social actors are not so much duped by ruling ideas as incredibly involved with the understanding and circulation of those ideas through their own expressions of individual will. This is a much more dynamic process of mediation than previous versions, but one heavily dependent on a more in-depth theorization of Gramsci's notion of hegemony. = Articulation theory = Cultural theorist Stuart Hall, Ernesto Laclau and Chantal Mouffe have further theorized the complexities of mediation through their development of articulation theory, to describe the ways that certain notions become dominant in a culture, given the relative openness of the social in heavily industrialized nations such as the U.S. This openness results in a ‚Äúnon-necessary belongingness‚Äù for the various elements of a given social formation, or an indeterminacy to the way that history, culture, economics or the material world, and social actors come together to form dominant notions. Thus, for Hall: > ‚Ä¶the so-called unity of a discourse is really the articulation of different, > distinct elements which can be articulated in different ways because they > have no necessary ‚Äúbelongingness‚Äù. The ‚Äúunity‚Äù which matters is a linkage > between that articulated discourse and the social forces with which it can, > under certain historical conditions, but need not necessarily, be connected. > Thus, a theory of articulation is both a way of understanding how > ideological elements come, under certain conditions, to cohere together > within a discourse, and a way of asking how they do or do not become > articulated, at specific conjunctures, to certain political subjects. > (53)Hall, Stuart. ‚ÄúOn Postmodernism and Articulation: An Interview with > Stuart Hall.‚Äù Ed. Lawrence Grossberg. Journal of Communication Inquiry. 10.2 > (1986): 45-60. Under articulation theory mediation becomes a complex, indeterminate process by which social meanings are circulated under the historical conditions of a given culture and social actors take up these meanings or not based on a complex interplay of all the parts of the social whole.  Mediation in media studies  Within media studies mediation is also used in the same sense as in Marxist theory: thinkers try to look at how a given medium reconciles the various forces of history, culture, economics or the material world, and how social actors use that medium to navigate these various meanings and values. The central problem for any media theorist, similar to the problem of a Marxist theorist, is to attempt to analyze what is possible and what is limited by a given medium. Or, in other words, how does the structure of the medium limit how that medium can be used and how do social actors work both within and against that structure? = Mass media and the culture industry = There is another sense in which media theorists look at this question, too, and that is by looking at the \\"mass media\\" as a whole. Beginning perhaps with the Frankfurt school‚Äôs theorization of the \\"culture industry,\\" particularly in the work of Max Horkheimer, Theodor W. Adorno, and Herbert Marcuse, theorists have tried to understand how mass audiences are both affected by and can affect the massive, corporatized media establishment that we see in countries like the U.S. As Adorno and Horkheimer reflect: > The most intimate reactions of human beings have been so thoroughly reified > that the idea of anything specific to themselves now persists only as an > utterly abstract notion: personality scarcely signifies anything more than > shining white teeth and freedom from body odor and emotions. The triumph of > advertising in the culture industry is that consumers feel compelled to buy > and use its products even though they see through them. (167)Horkheimer, > Max, and Theodor W. Adorno. Dialectic of Enlightenment. New York, Herder and > Herder: 1972. Early theorists such as these saw no agency whatsoever for audiences of the culture industry, claiming instead that this industry was founded on mass deception and that the average consumer was a cultural dupe being inculcated into the values of the ruling classes without realizing it. Many critics of this school feel that this represented a reintroduction of Marx's ideas about mediation, or media as purveyors of a dominant ideology that destroyed the possibility that audiences for mass media were able to work against these ruling ideas. = Marshall McLuhan = Perhaps one of the best known media theorists, McLuhan is famous for his dictum that \\"the medium is the message.\\" For McLuhan the central mediating factor in any society is the medium of communication itself. In this way, media occupy for McLuhan what labor or capital did for Marx. By claiming that the \\"medium is the message\\", McLuhan means that \\"the personal and social consequences of any medium‚Äîthat is, of any extension of ourselves‚Äîresult from the new scale that is introduced into our affairs by each extension of ourselves, or by any new technology\\" (p. 7). For McLuhan, the introduction of any new form of media into a given culture radically alters the way that members of that culture mediate between the material world and the given values available to them.McLuhan, Marshall. Understanding Media: The Extensions of Man. Cambridge: MIT Press, 1994. Thus, the shift into print technology radically altered the way that all later media would be both formed and operated: \\"Printing from movable types was the first mechanization of a complex handicraft, and became the archetype of all subsequent mechanization\\" (170). As he continues, however: > Like any other extension of man, typography had psychic and social > consequences that suddenly shifted previous boundaries and patterns of > culture. In bringing the ancient and medieval worlds into fusion‚Äîor, as some > would say, confusion‚Äîthe printed book created a third world, the modern > world, which now encounters a new electric technology, or a new extension of > man. Electric means of moving information are altering our typographic > culture as sharply as print modified medieval manuscript and scholastic > culture. (p. 171) For McLuhan, electronic media, as the new form of mediation in our culture, are creating radical new possibilities for thought and social relations. These new possibilities include the extension of our nervous system across space and time. As McLuhan puts it: > After more than a century of electric technology, we have extended our > central nervous system itself in a global embrace, abolishing both space and > time as far as our planet is concerned. Rapidly, we approach the final phase > of the extensions of man‚Äîthe technological simulation of consciousness, when > the creative process of knowing will be collectively and corporately > extended to the whole of human society. (3-4) This has resulted in a hybridization of media forms: > Media as extensions of our senses institute new ratios, not only among our > private senses, but among themselves, when they interact among themselves. > Radio changed the form of the news story as much as it altered the film > image in the talkies. TV caused drastic changes in radio programming, and in > the form of the thing or documentary novel. (53) It has also resulted in the translation of human consciousness \\"more and more into the form of information\\": > By putting our physical bodies inside our extended nervous systems, by means > of electric media, we set up a dynamic by which all previous technologies > that are mere extensions‚Ä¶ of our bodies‚Ä¶ will be translated into information > systems. Electromagnetic technology requires utter human docility and > quiescence of meditation such as befits an organism that now wears its brain > outside its skull and its nerves outside its hide. Man must serve his > electric technology with the same servo-mechanistic fidelity with which he > served his coracle, his canoe, his typography, and all other extensions of > his physical organs. (57) McLuhan has been critiqued as being alternately utopian, deterministic, and Eurocentric about the ways that media mediate between human beings and their natural world, but no one would deny the effects his work has had on the study of media. = The propaganda model = Edward S. Herman and Noam Chomsky formulated a propaganda model hypothesis for analyzing the media which: > attempts to explain the performances of the U.S. media in terms of the basic > institutional structures and relationships within which they operate. It is > our view that, among their other functions, the media serve, and > propagandize on behalf of, the powerful society interests that control and > finance them. The representatives of these interests have important agendas > and principles that they want to advance, and they are well positioned to > shape and constrain media policy. This is not normally accomplished by crude > intervention, but by the selection of right-thinking personnel and by the > editors‚Äô and working journalists‚Äô internalization of priorities and > definitions of newsworthiness that conform to the institution‚Äôs policy.‚Äù > (xi)Herman, Edward S., and Noam Chomsky. Manufacturing Consent: The > Political Economy of the Mass Media. New York: Pantheon, 2002. This model focuses mainly on ‚Äústructural factors‚Äù of the mass media, including ‚Äúownership and control, dependence on other major funding sources (such as, advertisers), and mutual interests and relationships between the media and those who make the news and have the power to define it and explain what it means‚Äù (xi). Though the influence on media studies remains, later thinkers have criticized this emphasis on structure over agency, because it neglects the ability of audiences of this media to question the prevailing notions represented. = The media‚Äôs audience: Incorporation and Excorporation = Thinkers such as John Fiske have looked at how audiences use popular media to get their own enjoyment from them, claiming, in a diametrically opposed fashion to much other media theory, that popular media, and thus the popular culture they are both part of and help create, can actually be progressive as audiences struggle to use these media for their own individual purposes, and the media then shift to accommodate these purposes. For Fiske this happens through a process of what he calls ‚Äúincorporation and excorporation,‚Äù a process by which social meanings are mediated by the dominant and subordinate members of a society in an ongoing struggle. In this way, excorporation, is ‚Äúthe process by which the subordinates make their own culture out of the resources and commodities provided by the dominant system, and this is central to popular culture, for in an industrial society the only resources from which the subordinate can make their own subcultures are those provided by the system that subordinates them‚Äù (15). Incorporation, on the other hand, is a kind of ‚Äúcontainment‚Äù used by the dominant system, or a ‚Äúprocess of adopting the signs of resistance [that] incorporates them into the dominant system and thus attempts to rob them of any oppositional meanings‚Äù (18).Fiske, John. Understanding Popular Culture. London: Routledge, 2004. These ideas have affected many thinkers after Fiske, but he has also been critiqued as being too utopian, and as not providing enough agency for the audiences he describes. If the only available agency for audiences are their mediation of those values ‚Äúprovided by the system that subordinates them,‚Äù then they will always occupy a subordinate position in relation to that system. = Media and democracy = Thinkers like Robert W. McChesney have looked at how the mass media mediate democracy, creating a touchstone for how citizens think of the mass media as either belonging to and serve their interests or serving the interests of the corporations that own them. As McChesney says: > The corporate domination of both the media system and the policy-making > process that establishes and sustains it causes serious problems for a > functioning democracy and a healthy culture. Media are not the only factor > in explaining the woeful state of our democracy, but they are a key factor. > It is difficult to imagine much headway being made on the crucial social > issues that face our nation given how poorly they are covered by the current > U.S. media system. (p. 7)McChesney, Robert W. The Problem of the Media: U.S. > Communication Politics in the 21st Century. New York: Monthly Review Press, > 2004. At the same time, however, McChesney, unlike early thinkers in this vein, is interested in mobilizing popular resistance against this domination. He continues: ‚Äúthe democratic solution to this problem, is to increase informed public participation in media policy making‚Äù (p. 7). McChesney is well known as an outspoken advocate for this public participation, engaging in speaking tours around the country and lobbying against corporate control of the media. = Remediation = Theorists of new media examine how emerging kinds of media, such as websites, blogs, wiki pages, and digital video, both delimit the ways people can use them, and provide new avenues for the production of social relations and meanings. Picking up from McLuhan, media theorists Jay David Bolter and Richard Grusin, in their 1999 book Remediation: Understanding New Media, sought to describe how media forms interact with one another through remediation and the way that this media practice invokes the interrelated processes of immediacy and hypermediacy. The validation of the concept of remediation ‚Äî \\"the representation of one medium in another\\" ‚Äî is a principal aim of the book, in order to illustrate how new and old media forms continually inform one another. Immediacy attempts to make viewers feel as if they are really there, through hypermediated practices, which splice together (hybridizing as McLuhan would say) different kinds of media, such as the combination of ‚Äúlive-action footage with computer compositing and two- and three-dimensional computer graphics‚Äù in order to create the appearance of a seamless moving image. These interrelated processes highlight, what Bolter and Grusin term the \\"double logic of remediation\\" that pursues the proliferation of media while trying to erase all traces of human and/or technological mediation. Bolter and Grusin contend that the process of remediation emphasizes that all media is, on one level, a poststructutalist \\"play of signs\\". The recognition of these varying signs of influence differ across a spectrum, from \\"transparent\\" remediations that clearly represent the previous media form, to aggressive forms that seek to disguise the role of their hypermediated practices in the name of providing the highest sense of immediacy. Bolter and Grusin broadly identify five forms of remediation: * Transparent: Previous media are \\"highlighted and represented in digital form without apparent irony or critique. Examples include CD-ROM (or DVD) picture galleries (digitized paintings or photographs) and collections of literary texts\\". This form of remediation seeks transparency, endeavoring to erase itself \\"so that the viewer stands in the same relationship to the content as she would if she were confronting the original medium\\". * Translucent: The new media are still justified in terms of the old and seek to remain faithful to the older media's character. This form of remediation seeks \\"to emphasize the difference rather than erase it\\". In translucent remediation \\"the new medium does not want to efface itself entirely\\". For instance, in regards to the CD- ROM encyclopedia Encarta, Microsoft attempts to convey to the consumer that \\"she has purchased not simply an Encyclopedia, but an electronic, and therefore improved, Encyclopedia\\". * Hypermediated: This form of remediation attempts to \\"refashion the older medium or media entirely, while still marking the presence of the older media and therefore maintaining a sense of multiplicity or hypermediacy\\". This form can be seen in the use of simultaneous window frames, which are able to run different programs representative of different media. Hypermediated remediation is akin to \\"a mosaic in which we are simultaneously aware of the individual pieces and their new, in-appropriate setting\\". * Aggressive: The new medium attempts to \\"absorb the older medium entirely, so that the discontinuities between the two are minimized\\". Bolter and Grusin speak to the computer games Myst and Doom, which remediate cinema so that \\"players become characters in a cinematic narrative\\". Video games allow for an (limited) ability to determine narrative within a subjective realization through the capacity to \\"decide where to look‚Äîwhere to direct their graphically realized points of view\\". In regard to film, Bolter and Grusin, in part, understand this form of aggressive remediation as \\"an attempt to hold off the threat that digital media might pose for the traditional, linear film\\". This form of aggressive remediation seeks a different transparency by attempting to make any electronic interventions invisible. This concealment of its relationship to earlier media, \\"promises the user an unmediated experience\\". * Refashioning within a single medium occurs \\"when a film borrows from an earlier film\\". This process of borrowing is a fundamental aspect of film, painting, and literature where the play within a play or the poem within a poem or novel is a very familiar strategy. Bolter and Grusin assert that this kind of remediation has been thought of highly by the respective critics as \\"it does not violate the presumed sanctity of the medium. Bolter and Grusin apply their consideration of remediation on to the ontology of all media: All media, from literature to new digital media, is unable to make a radical break away from what has come before. Media continues to \\"function in a constant dialectic with earlier media\\" forms, where both old and new are able to impact on one another regardless of which came first. For example, \\"users of older media such as film and television can seek to appropriate and refashion digital graphics, just as digital graphics artists can refashion film and television\\". However these appropriations within digital technologies of immediacy have often sought to deny mediation. Bolter and Grusin elaborate on the double logic of this form of remediation as an integral function of contemporary immediacy in media. Although Bolter and Grusin acknowledge that not \\"all of our culture's claims of remediation are equally compelling or that we could necessarily identify all of the strategies through which digital media remediate and are remediated by their predecessors\\" they outline various ways in which \\"the double logic of remediation can function explicitly or implicitly\\" can be restated in the following ways: * Remediation as the mediation of mediation: \\"Each act of mediation depends on other acts of mediation. Media are continually commenting on, reproducing, and replacing each other, and this process is integral to media\\". [Media needs other media in order to function as media at all.] * Remediation as the inseparability of mediation and reality: Bolter and Grusin assert that \\"although Baudrillard's notion of simulation and simulacra might suggest otherwise, all mediations are themselves real. They are real as artifacts (but not as autonomous agents) in our mediated culture. Despite the fact that all media depend on other media in cycles of remediation, our culture still needs to acknowledge that all media remediate the real. Just as there is no getting rid of mediation, there is no getting rid of the real\\". * Remediation as reform: \\"The goal of remediation is to refashion or rehabilitate other media. Furthermore, because all mediations are both real and mediations of the real, remediation can also be understood as a process of reforming reality as well\\". Additionally, Bolter and Grusin also discuss a psychological dimension of \\"the desire for immediacy and the fascination with hypermediacy\\" that considers how individuals are subjugated through their engagement with media forms. For instance, \\"when we watch a film or a television broadcast, we understand ourselves as the changing point of view of the camera\\". Bolter and Grusin stipulate that the media type predisposes the form of subjective response and that all mediated participations offer, \\"a different mediation of the subject, and our experience is the remediation of these differences\\" A subject's existence is understood as \\"the ability to occupy points of view ‚Ä¶ [and] can enter into immediate relationships with the various media or media forms that surround her\\". Considerations of the ways the self is involved in processes of mediation and remediation enable an examination of the effect of the desire for immediacy within media. Bolter and Grusin assert that \\"instead of trying to be in the presence of the objects of representation, the subject now defines immediacy as being in the presence of media\\". Bolter and Grusin provide insight into the interdependency of media and its integral role in understanding how \\"the remediation of reality has been built into our technologies of representation\\".  Marxist theories of media studies  Many thinkers are now working at the intersections of Marxism and media studies, and are attempting to tease out the various interrelations, contradictions, and possibilities inherent in these two conversations. Recent books such as Marxism And Media Studies: Key Concepts and Contemporary Trends by Mike Wayne, Media Ecologies: Materialist Energies in Art and Technoculture by Matthew Fuller, Media and Cultural Studies by Meenakshi Gigi Durham and Douglas Kellner, Marxism and Communication Studies: The Point Is to Change It edited by Lee Artz, Steve Macek, and Dana L. Cloud, and Hypercapitalism: New Media, Language, and Social Perceptions of Value by Phil Graham attest to the strength of such work. Many of these thinkers see as their project the rehabilitation of Marxist theory and cultural studies in light of new forms of media and parallel social and historical developments and vice versa. As Deepa Kumar puts it, regarding aspects of Marxist theory such as dialectical materialism: > the method of analysis developed by Marx and Engels, is more relevant to > media and cultural studies scholarship today for at least two reasons: the > crisis of neoliberalism and the collapse of Stalinism‚Ä¶.The time has come for > critical scholarship to shake off the yoke of TINA (there is no > alternative), and start to take seriously the bankruptcy of capitalism and > the possibilities of a socialist alternative. (71) Kumar, Deepa. ‚ÄúMedia, Culture, and Society: The Relevance of Marx‚Äôs Dialectical Method.‚Äù Marxism and Communication Studies: The Point Is to Change It. Ed. Lee Artz, Steve Macek, and Dana L. Cloud. NY: Peter Lang, 2006. pp. 71-86. Thus, Kumar sees the task of scholars of media and culture as twofold: ‚Äúto explain and critique the state of culture and society, and then to act upon the world to change it. In taking up this challenge, classical Marxism as a guide to action has much to offer‚Äù (85). In addition, this type of work is possible according to Kumar due to the contradictory nature of media: ‚ÄúMedia texts are contradictory, as all reality is contradictory. And contradiction allows for change within the totality of social relations. This change is the product of human beings resisting their conditions of oppression and exploitation‚Äù (p. 84). And this contradictory nature of media, is in turn due to the ways that media are mediated in modern-day culture: ‚ÄúIn short, mass- mediated products are determined by various factors‚Äîthe systems of ownership, the process of cultural production, the level of struggle, the state of consciousness in society at a given time, and so on. A dialectical method of analysis would involve studying all these factors within a concrete historical context so as to explain the multiple mediations that infuse a product of culture‚Äù (85). For many of these new thinkers, the very way that new forms of media are mediated by social actors, or way that these actors navigate the complex and contradictory forces of history, the material world, and culture through media is the key to the age old problem of mediation in Marxist theory. = Hypercapitalism and new media = One particular intersection of Marxist theory and new media studies is to be found in Phil Graham's Hypercapitalism: New Media, Language, and Social Perceptions of Value, in which he attempts to theorize the ways that the new knowledge economy is mediated by various factors. For Graham, in order for a theory to ‚Äúestablish the historical significance of a global, digitally mediated knowledge economy,‚Äù the approach: > must grasp the relationship between language, privilege, and the perceived > relative value of different classes of knowers and knowledges; to grasp the > effects of new media and their relationship to changes in conceptions about > the character of knowledge; and‚Äîsince knowledge, new media, language, and > value are perennial and dynamic influences in human societies‚Äîto identify > what marks the current transition in social relations as historically > significant or unique, if anything. (xi)Graham, Phil. Hypercapitalism: New > Media, Language, and Social Perceptions of Value. New York: Peter Lang, > 2006. In order to do this work, then, Graham is adopting a ‚Äúprocess view of mediation‚Äù, > that sees the movement and transformation of meanings across times, spaces, > and social contexts; which acknowledges that, yes, there are technological > aspects of mediation that cannot be ignored, and there are substantial > issues surrounding what is generally understood by the term ‚Äúcontent‚Äù. > However, mediation is far more than either ‚Äúcontent‚Äù or technology. It is a > complex set of real, material, social processes facilitated by specific > technological means. (p. 3) Ultimately, Graham is representative of this new body of work because he is seeking to define a methodology that accounts for the complexity and contradiction arising from the ways that new media and new methods of information exchange are mediated by all conceivable factors.

It was discovered on 27 October 1927, by German astronomer Karl Reinmuth at the Heidelberg-K√∂nigstuhl State Observatory in southwest Germany. The asteroid has a rotation period of 11.4 hours and measures approximately in diameter. It was named for the Greek island of Euboea.  Orbit and classification  Euboea is a non-family asteroid of the main belt's background population when applying the hierarchical clustering method to its proper orbital elements. It orbits the Sun in the central asteroid belt at a distance of 2.2‚Äì3.0 AU once every 4 years and 3 months (1,540 days; semi-major axis of 2.61 AU). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.16 and an inclination of 8¬∞ with respect to the ecliptic. The body's observation arc begins with a recovered observation from the Lowell Observatory in April 1930, more than 2 years after to its official discovery observation.  Naming  This minor planet was named after Euboea, also known as \\"Negropont\\", the largest island of Greece in the Aegean Sea. The was mentioned in The Names of the Minor Planets by Paul Herget in 1955 ().  Physical characteristics  Euboea is an assumed stony S-type asteroid. = Rotation period and poles = In October 2007, a first rotational lightcurve of Euboea was obtained from photometric observations by astronomers at the Oakley Southern Sky Observatory in Australia. Lightcurve analysis gave a rotation period of 11.41 hours with a brightness variation of 0.50 magnitude (). In April 2010, a similar period of 11.396 hours and an amplitude of 0.46 magnitude was measured by French amateur astronomer Pierre Antonini (). In 2016, two modeled lightcurves were published using photometric data from the Lowell Photometric Database and other sources. They gave a concurring sidereal period of 11.3981 and 11.39823 hours, respectively. Each study also determined two respective spin axes of (79.0¬∞, 75.0¬∞) and (282.0¬∞, 55.0¬∞), and (71.0¬∞, 61.0¬∞) and (280.0¬∞, 54.0¬∞) in ecliptic coordinates (Œª, Œ≤). = Diameter and albedo = According to the surveys carried out by the Japanese Akari satellite and the NEOWISE mission of NASA's Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer, Euboea measures between 18.37 and 31.90 kilometers in diameter and its surface has an albedo between 0.0576 and 0.213. The Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link derives a low albedo of 0.0539 ‚Äì typical for carbonaceous C-type asteroids ‚Äì and a diameter of 31.46 kilometers based on an absolute magnitude of 11.3.

Plot  Fran√ßois Perrin is a belligerent factory worker who plays football for a local amateur team, in a club owned by a rich businessman who also owns the factory where Perrin, as well as most of the population of Trincamp, works. His attitude doesn't endear him to anyone, and the situation is not helped when, at a training session, he pushes Berthier, the star and captain of the team, who demands that Perrin be expelled. Soon thereafter, he is also fired from his job, and the whole town turns against him and he is even prohibited from entering the local bar. When a drunk Berthier tries to rape a woman one night, Perrin is immediately framed for the deed, and ends up in jail after being brutalized by the police. Two months later, the Trincamp team is to participate in an important game for the France's Cup, but the bus carrying the team gets into an accident, and out of desperation to replace the injured players, Perrin is released from jail to help out the team. While on the way to the stadium, he manages to evade police and finds the rape victim and confront her. Rather than resulting in conflict, he actually finds someone who believes him, since she was not positive in her earlier identification, and she decides to investigate the testimonies that convicted Perrin, while he goes on to play and scores both of his team's goals in a very tight victory. Perrin is now the town's hero, and he uses that position and the knowledge of who did what and who made false reports to the police to plot a subtle but effective revenge on those who have wronged him.

History The main entranceway to the Biscainhos residence The interior courtyard of the residence of the Biscainhos A view of the manicured gardens of the Biscainhos In 1665, Maria da Silva e Sousa married Dr. Constantino Ribeiro do Lago (1619-1686), who was one of the most important civil personalities in Braga. He was a Knight in the Order of Christ, alcalde of Ervededo, Overseer and Judge of Braga, Chancellor of Rela√ß√£o, attorney-general of Mitra, represented the city in the 1667 Cortes in Lisbon. Lago ordered the construction of a residence, that was likely constructed by Basque artisans from the province of Biscay, then working in the cathedral of Braga, resulting in its name, Biscainhos. The work was concluded in 1699 by his son, Diogo de Sousa da Silva, who was also a knight in the Order of Christ. In the 18th century, over three generations, the residence was passed-on through the matrilineal descendant of the family. On 26 November 1712, Francisco Pereira da Silva (who was the Dean of the Cathedral of Braga) signed a contract with mason Manuel Fernandes da Silva, to expand the residence along Rua dos Bisca√≠nhos, the second executed to that effect. In the course of this work, a ceiling painting in the main hall was executed by painter Manuel Furtado de Mendon√ßa (in 1724), and later, azulejo tile, which came from fabricators in Coimbra. In the intervening years it passed-into the possession of various illustrious owners. Ant√≥nio Pereira Pinto de E√ßa, was administrator of the second founding of Bertiandos. Jo√£o Pereira Forjaz Coutinho, was the son of the Secret√°rio dos Neg√≥cios Estrangeiros, da Guerra e da Marinha (Secretary for International Affairs, War and the Army). Dami√£o Pereira da Silva de Sousa e Menezes (1764-1835) was administrator of the first founding of Bertiandos. Gon√ßalo Pereira da Silva de Sousa e Menezes (1797-1856), Count of Bertiandos, member of the council of Queen D. Maria II, Peer of the Kingdom, Civil Governor of Braga and attorney of the 1928 Cortes. His daughter, Joana Maria do Ros√°rio Francisca Sales Pereira da Silva de Sousa e Menezes (1818-1874), second Countess of Bertiandos, lading-in-waiting of Queens D. Estef√¢nia and D. Maria. Her nephew, Gaspar Lobo Machado do Amaral Cardoso de Menezes, 3rd Viscount of Pa√ßo de Nespereira was the last member of the family to be owner of the Residence of Biscainhos. The dominant period of its history occurred in the 18th century, resulting in exquisite Baroque interiors that included azulejos, ceilings with beautiful relief stucco work and paintings of the period. It was also framed by the magnificent gardens. In 1963, the building was acquired by the District Junta from the Viscount of Pa√ßo de Nespereira, in order to install a museum, with work initiated under the responsibility of Alberto da Silva Bessa. On 11 February 1978, the Museum of the Bisca√≠nhos was opened to the public. Due to the financial incapacity of the district junta, by decree 133/87 (18 March) the building was placed into the management of the IPPAR Instituto Portugu√™s do Patrim√≥nio Cultural (Portuguese Institute of Cultural Patrimony). During this time, the exterior facades were repaired and the paintings in the halls were repaired. But, on 9 August 1991, it was succeeded by its transfer into the management of the Instituto Portugu√™s de Museus (Portuguese Institute of Museums), in decree 278/91 (Di√°rio da Rep√∫blica, S√©rie-1A), and later (29 March 2007), to the Instituto dos Museus e Conserva√ß√£o, I.P. (Institute of Museums and Conservation) by decree 97/2007 (Di√°rio da Rep√∫blica, S√©rie 1, 63). Architecture The building is located in an isolated context, situated outside the walls of the ancient city, in an area that was formerly rural, but absorbed into the city of Braga overtime, today inserted in what is considered the historic centre, addorsed to other constructions. The large entranceway was structured in a way to permit carriages, and other vehicles, to enter by way of a covered patio, that served simultaneously as principal entrance and passage to the stables and gardens. The space is covered in grooved, non-slip, granite slabs and arch-shaped entrances with granite pilasters. In each of these pilasters there are small statues of a page or knight in costume from the 18th century. The first floor of the main body of the house includes seven rooms. The azulejo hall is of particular interest: it is a large space, about long, covered in azulejo tile, with its ceiling covered in painted wood, representing the history of the illustrious, and much venerated, Bracarense Beato Miguel de Carvalho. Next to this a smaller room, painted with mythological motifs, but from a later period. The set of rooms arranged along the garden, especially the dining room, is furnished and decorated with pieces dating from the beginning of the 18th century and the beginning of the 19th. The romanticised scenes, painted on canvas, evoke themes about ruins and fantastical stories. =Garden= About a hectare in the rear of the house was surrounded by walls and divided into landscaped terraces. On the opposite wall is a polygonal structure of buttresses which, together with its crowning of battlements and sentries located at the angles, gives it an aspect of a 16th century fortress. Inside the bulwark's simulacrum is a small temple with dome and lantern, that contains sepulchral slabs dedicated to the former-gentry the masters of the house. The estate is divided into three terraces, rising slightly from the house to the west, separated by walls crowned with tile planting boxes. The terraces are supported by decorative granite columns that are arranged along the walls and terraces of the estate. Of these terraces, the lower two were cultivated with vegetables and orchard, divided into blocks flanked by boxwood stools. The upper terrace is occupied by the garden itself and by a terrarium that separates it from the house. It occupies a rectangular terrace surrounded by a wall with tiled floor, decorated pyramids, urns and statuary statues, over the access gates, on the side viewpoints and at the angles, together with the raised beds. Inside the flower beds, are five bowls with water springs, similar to those introduced by Muslims during the 8th century, in the Rocaille style. Among the species in the garden are stands of tulip poplar (Liriodendron tulipifera) that were contemporary to the initial plantation. The Museum The museum exhibits, on a permanent basis, collections of decorative arts, integrated into the structure of the 18th century northern manorhouse. Its collection includes furniture, ceramics, European and Oriental porcelain, glassware, and examples of European and Portuguese watches and clocks.

He was also a member of the South American cricket team that toured England in 1932. Ferguson was a right-handed middle order batsman. He first appeared for Argentina as a 17-year-old in three matches against Sir Julien Cahn's XI in early 1930: though his highest score was only 22, he averaged almost 17 runs an innings. On the 1932 tour, he played in all six first-class matches and had success in the first and the last. Against Oxford University he made 85 with a five and 11 fours, and added 159 in 130 minutes with Henry Marshal, who made 153. That score was to prove his career highest in first-class matches, but he also passed 50 in the final match, against Scotland, when his 60 was the top score in the match for the South American team. On the tour as a whole, he made 264 runs at an average of 24 in the first-class games, and 484 runs, average 25.47, in all matches, with a highest of 95. His final three first-class matches were in the 1937-38 season for Argentina against Sir Theodore Brinckman's XI, a touring team of English county cricketers led by R. E. S. Wyatt. He had limited success in these matches, with a highest score of just 36. In non-first-class cricket, Ferguson represented Argentina against a touring MCC as late as 1959, and he represented South of Argentina against North of Argentina in the annual match most years between the 1929-30 season and the 1965-66 season. In his last game at this level, he was joined by his son, Tony Ferguson whose own two sons, Pablo Ferguson and Alejandro Ferguson have represented Argentina in ICC Trophy matches in the early 21st century.

It is a memorial to the perspicacity, work ethic and dedication of the Pioneers who tamed, settled and developed the last frontier known as 'The Great American Desert', referred to generally as The Great Plains of the United States and Canada. Construction Isham and Texana Tubbs began to think of caring for Texana's sister Lizzie Spikes Carlisle who had cared for the sisters' mother Lucinda Pelts Carter Spikes until her death at age 85 in 1902. This called for the sale of developed homesteads in Wolfforth, Texas and a move 10 miles across the prairie onto 1 1/2 sections adjoining W. A.'Gus' Carlisle's homesite. The timber for use in construction of this house was cut from trees selected by Isham Tubbs while on a return trip to their prior home in Kaufman County, Texas some 500 miles to the East. After milling, the lumber was railed to Colorado City, Childress and Amarillo, Texas, as the Railway neared Lubbock, and hauled to the site from those railheads by horse and wagon. There it cured onsite until construction was begun in 1907 and finished in 1908. The House was modeled after one found in a magazine picture or catalog fancied by Texana Tubbs. As the house began to take shape in framing, Uncle Gus and Aunt Lizzie expressed a desire to live there also, so they helped with the addition on the North side of a smaller quarters for their abode. The construction utilizes pier and beam Queen Anne Styling, from the end of the Victorian Era. It has 1':1' pitch roofs, numerous cupolas, \\"fish scaling\\" gables with \\"Gingerbread\\" scroll work, and extensive curved and squared porches on front and a squared porch on back. As of 2007 (100 years), it has been a residence for descendants of the Isham and Texanna Tubbs family continually since their return from Mexico at the outbreak of the Mexican Revolution about 1910 after an aborted plantation venture that was thwarted by the ensuing chaos of the war environment.

The site is located in Claverack, New York, about North of New York City, and includes land art constructions, geoglyphs, architectural fabrications and sculptures:Sun Farm aerial view The shaping of the landscape and structures is oriented to solar and celestial alignments, in a dual effort to capture the sun's energy and to celebrate the cosmos. The work unveils as a built philosophical statement of awareness of being in time and part of a system. The Sun's daily path‚Äîfrom sunrise to sunset and its disappearing at night‚Äîis represented, literally and metaphorically, by two spirals connected by a ¬æ of mile long axis. East Spiral, located at the east end of the axis, represents the day, metaphor of the beginning of human life. Sun Axis stretches in the east‚Äìwest direction and is defined by photovoltaic panels, linked to the energy grid; it ends in West Spiral, representation of the sunset and night. A naked eye observatory for night stars defines the center of the spiral. Initial constructions‚Äîalready realized‚Äîinclude: * East Spiral, an excavated pond, shaped as a logarithmic spiral and surrounded by a mound; the center of East Spiral represents the Axis Mundi of Sun Farm; * East West a geoglyph aligned to an east‚Äìwest axis; * North Arrow, a metal sculpture parallel to the Earth axis; * Meditation Path‚Äîa north‚Äìsouth gravel path framed by a tree-trunk arch, with a timber sculpture Time Helix, as focal point; * Time Helix, a helix sculpture based on 108 rotations of a timber module; * North-South, East-West, Up-down, a tensegrity sculpture aligned to the four cardinal axes; * a passive solar house; * Sunrise Trellis, a structure framing the sunrise at the equinoxes; * Square Field, a rock and gravel garden based on geometric progression; * Noon Columns, a long sundial / sculpture; * Solstice Monument: the Helix, a helix shaped arch, aligned to the sunrise at the winter solstice and the sunset at the summer solstice. Sunrise Trellisframing the Sun path during the Fall equinox Sun Farm is envisioned as an outdoor art center and energy farm, a series of events in a place available to communities as a showcase of alternative energy sources as well as an educational art and nature destination. The viewing of the main artwork‚Äîthe intersecting spirals path‚Äîdevelops at different layers of perception. Art becomes a participatory event leading to a spiritual experience, where the observer is led by views of the sky in the Sun's daily path/cycle. Walking along the path will provide a different layer of interpretation, as a walking meditation, with a direct experience of the metaphors of spirals / time / sun path / life. Sun Farm was inspired by the holistic model of eastern philosophies / practices and the connection with cosmological events which was present in early cultures, where traditional people used interventions in the landscape as a means of interpreting celestial events. The site of Sun Farm is in the Hudson Valley, a geographic region celebrated in the paintings of the nineteenth century Hudson River School, for its landscapes, dramatic skies, sunrises and sunsets. The framing of the sky created by the structures in Sunset Farm echoes the intention of those paintings and brings a contemporary interpretation to the perception of the landscape.

Gilliam and Grisoni went to WGA arbitration to get credit for Fear and Loathing; initially only Tod Davies and Alex Cox (who had written a previous version of the screenplay) were credited, despite Gilliam and Grisoni rewriting the entire film from scratch.

A proposal to host the 2000 FIBA EuroLeague Final Four in the new arena, increased the motivation to complete the stadium. FIBA Europe accepted the offer, and the construction was finished in time.

He was born with the surname of \\"Pipolo\\" but changed his name to Palmer. One of his brothers, Frank Pipolo, was a decorated New York City police officer.  Career  Born in New York City,http://babbittblog.com/2013/04/26/1931-disney-staff-caricatures-profiles- pt-4/ Palmer's first animation credits occurred at the Winkler Studio in 1928 which made Oswald the Lucky Rabbit cartoons. Palmer moved over to Universal Pictures cartoon studio run by Walter Lantz which took over the Oswald series in 1929. By the early 1930s, he was working at Walt Disney Productions. He was lured by Leon Schlesinger to work as an animation director at his newly formed Leon Schlesinger Productions animation studio which made cartoons for Warner Bros.. By June 1933, Palmer was named the production manager and main director of the studio, with Jack King as the head animator. Among the staff were two former associates of Palmer from Disney, animators Paul Fennell and Bill Mason.Barrier (2003), Warner Bros., pp. unnumbered pages According to animation historian Michael Barrier, Schlesinger placed former Disney animators in charge of the studio in hopes of effectively competing with the Disney studio. The first task for the new studio staff was finding a new continuing character to replace Bosko as the star of the Looney Tunes series. Barrier credits Palmer with introducing Buddy to serve as the intended replacement. Like Bosko and Mickey Mouse, Buddy had a girlfriend and a pet dog as supporting characters. He was more recognizably human than either of his predecessors, a prepubescent boy. He was more reminiscent of the boy protagonists of contemporary comic strips, such as Out Our Way. Palmer's only two credited Warner Bros. cartoons were 1933's Buddy's Day Out and I've Got to Sing a Torch Song.Warner Bros. Cartoon Releases - 1933 Palmer's approach in directing Buddy's Day Out was reportedly rather loose. In the story conferences which determined the contents of the film, Palmer would suggest adding \\"a funny piece of business\\", a visual gag. He failed to specify the use of anything particularly funny. According to later interviews with Bernard B. Brown and Bob Clampett, Palmer's original version of the film was virtually devoid of gags. The Warner Bros. studio rejected this version and the film had to be reworked extensively. Barrier considers the finished film, with gags added, to also have been \\"desperately unfunny\\". The gags were neither as well conceived, nor as well executed as those found in the animated short films of Disney. Palmer was fired by Schlesinger after Warner Bros. rejected the cartoons that he had produced. Friz Freleng was called in to rework Palmer's cartoons and ultimately replaced him as the studio's head director. Palmer's initial replacement as director, however, was Earl Duvall. After leaving Warner Bros., Palmer worked at the Van Beuren Studio until it folded in 1936. He briefly returned to Disney where he worked on the cartoon The Old Mill. His final credited work was as an animation director for the feature film Gulliver's Travels (1939) at Fleischer Studios.

In 1981, some UB students continued the tradition of playing music at UB's home football and basketball games by forming UB's Pep Band.

At that time, performances were limited to a few concerts, and marching during the school's football games. The band eventually dissolved in 1927, but many attempts were made to revive it. The band was re-formed in 1946 by Gerald Marx. A saxophone player, Marx brought together around 50 players to play and march at university football and basketball games. They also played concerts around the area, including one in Kleinhans Music Hall, home of the Buffalo Philharmonic Orchestra. In 1952, The Air Force ROTC Band took over the marching duties on campus, leaving the university band only non-marching duties. In 1956, the newly formed music department at the university took over the marching band after the ROTC band failed to meet expectations during its existence, and upon the insistence of UB's president, Clifford C. Furnas. Robert Mols, PhD, led this new band, writing the current fight song, \\"Victory,\\" that is heard at football games and basketball games today. Mols wanted the band to be comparable to Ivy League marching bands, creating uniforms that resembled uniforms of the Ivy Leaguers of the day. The band opened to much success and fanfare thanks to the efforts of Mols and the band's many weeks of practice before their premiere. In 1959, Buffalo Philharmonic member Lowell Shaw took over leading the marching band; Mols went back to conducting the university Concert Band. In 1961, the band again changed leaders with Frank J. Cipolla at the helm. The University purchased new uniforms and a new version of the Alma Mater was written. It was at this time that the band acquired its first nickname, \\"Pride of the East.\\" In 1968, the band had the distinction of being the first group on campus to move to the new North Campus to what is now Bissell Hall. In 1969, the band marched in Richard Nixon's inauguration parade. Between 1961 and the early 1970s, the band grew from only 50 members to over 300 members. The university joined the SUNY system in 1962, eventually leading to the elimination of the football team and with it the need for a marching band. In 1981, a small group of students created a pep band for the then Division III football team. Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, the band grew to become a Student Association group, so beginning the University at Buffalo Blue Noise Pep Band. During this time, there was talk of restarting the marching band, however it never developed. In 1999, football returned to Division I. With this, the university decided a marching band was again a necessity. Mark Flynn was made the director, and with the efforts of Kappa Kappa Psi, many local high schools, and Student Affairs, the Thunder of the East made its debut on September 11, 1999. In 2000, the band began its second season with new uniforms and new words to Victory March written by Mols, the original composer. It's believed that there were never any words for the original song. In the fall of 2001, the band made its first road trip in nearly 30 years to West Point to cheer on the Buffalo Bulls at Army's Michie Stadium. Instrumentation The Thunder of the East is a Drum Corps style band that incorporates traditional marching band instrumentation. Instruments included are: *Piccolo/Flute *Clarinet *Alto/Tenor/Baritone Saxophone *Trumpet *Mellophone (Horn in F) *Trombone *Baritone *Tuba (Contra) *Drumline ‚Äì Snare/Tenor/Bass Drums and Cymbals Visual section The Thunder of the East also has a Visual section to add artistic style to their performances, including: *Color Guard *Featured Twirlers *UB Dazzlers Dance Team Rehearsal Several practices are held per week during the fall semester. Students in the band may also take MUS 130, an optional two-credit course. Rehearsals may be held at Kunz Field, the former football stadium, UB Stadium or indoors at Baird hall, home of the university's music department. University affiliation Marching band is associated with UB's Student Life, and together with the Pep Band, comprises the Athletic Bands. The band is not part of the Music Department at the university. However, all students in the band are given the option of taking MUS 130, a 2-credit course. Band camp Members of the Thunder of the East arrive one week prior to the start of UB's fall semester. Students are able to move into their assigned dorms prior to camp, allowing them to avoid the rush and chaos of university-wide move in day. During the week of Fun in the Sun, members are taught the marching style of the Thunder of the East, fitted for uniforms, and begin to learn that season's music and field show. Also during the time members of the drumline and Dazzlers Dance Team audition for their spots. Organization =Director= UB's Buffalo Bulls Mascot with UB Pep Band Member, October 1990 James E. Mauck has been the director for the Thunder of the East since 2002. He received his undergraduate and master's degrees in music performance at Indiana University of Pennsylvania, and is currently working towards a PhD in Music Education. He is the head of the Department of Athletic Bands at the University at Buffalo. This includes the Thunder of the East and the Blue Noise Pep Band. =Instructors= The band acquires help from several additional instructors. =Drum majors= The drum majors for the Thunder of the East are the on-field commanders of the band, responsible for instructing proper marching technique and rehearsal etiquette. The drum majors primary responsibility is conducting the band. Drum majors are chosen by the director after a series of auditions, held in the spring semester. The current drum majors for the 2019 season are Craig Adriaansen and Madison Richardson. =Officers= The band is also led by a number of students that are elected at the end of the marching band season. =Section leaders= Each section has a student leader that focuses on their specified instrument. Their responsibilities include helping the freshman learn the band's unique style of marching, helping the instructors teach the music to their appropriate section, and providing leadership under the instructors and officers. Section Leaders are selected by the Staff and Elected Officers. Performances The Thunder of the East performs many times throughout the year. The band performs at every home football game, travels to at least one away game per year, and attends other events, such as parades and exhibition performances at New York State Field Band competitions.Thunder of the East performance at New York State Field Band Competition (video), YouTube, 2009, Retrieved March 29, 2014. The Thunder of the East also accompanies the team to any/all Post-Season Performances. In 2008, the band followed the Bulls on their historic run to the MAC Championship and their first ever Bowl Game. =Game day= The band starts game day by warming up and performing a pre-game concert in front of Slee Hall, the university's concert hall. The sounds from this performance can be heard around most of the North Campus, in effect being the first of many pre-game \\"pep rallies\\" that the band will perform. The band then marches down the road, playing in parade formation, to UB Stadium where it will perform at 1‚Äì2 different tailgate parties and the Blue and White Club. While marching, the band plays selections from its halftime show. When the band arrives at the stadium, it takes the field to perform a pre-game show. The band then goes to its section in the stadium, next to the student section and plays typical game tunes along with some of its halftime show. At halftime, the band performs its show facing the home crowd on the west side of the stadium. After the performance, the band returns to the stands to again join the crowd cheering on the Bulls. After the game, the band performs its halftime show facing the east side of the stadium, consisting mostly of students. =Travel= The band travels to away games and many other events.

It is named the Autostrada dei Trafori (the Autostrada of the Tunnels) after the numerous tunnels through which it passes, both Apennine and Subalpine. It runs northwards from Genoa on the Ligurian coast, over the Apennines, and across the wide plain of the Po valley to the environs of Lake Maggiore and the mouth of the Val d‚ÄôOssola. In addition to this ‚Äòmain trunk‚Äô of the road, there are three side branches, also of motorway class which function as link roads between the A26 and the A7, the A4 and the A8.

(Note that the gate of Pra' is still wrongly named \\"Voltri\\", nevertheless, Voltri has anything to do with the motorway gate and that the City of Genova has formally asked for the change of its name in \\"Gate of Pra' \\"). It crosses the Apennines at the Passo del Turchino (532m) and passes through Ovada. Near Castelferro (frazione of Predosa) an eastern branch, the Autostrada A26/A7, provides links to Novi Ligure and to the Autostrada A7 (Genoa ‚Äì Milan) which it joins near Spineto Scrivia, to the south of Tortona. The A26 continues northwards until near Alessandria there is an interchange with the Autostrada A21 (Turin ‚Äì Brescia). The road crosses the Po River just east of Casale Monferrato. South of Vercelli a western branch, the Autostrada A4/26, provides a connection to the Autostrada A4 (Turin ‚Äì Trieste) near Santhi√†, and continues as the Autostrada A4/A5 to the Autostrada A5 (Turin ‚Äì Aosta ‚Äì Monte Bianco) which it joins at Pavone Canavese, just south of Ivrea. Further north, between Greggio and Biandrate Vicolungo to the west of Novara, the A26 intersects with the Autostrada A4 (Turin ‚Äì Trieste), and at Sesto Calende with the Autostrada A8. The road passes close to Romagnano Sesia and Ghemme where there is an exit for the Valsesia. It proceeds north-east and follows the shore of Lago Maggiore with exits for Arona, Brovello-Carpugnino, Baveno - Stresa, Verbania and Gravellona Toce. From here the Strada Statale SS 33 del Sempione continues the route northwards, initially as a superstrada (a form of expressway), to Domodossola and then via the Val Divedro to the Swiss border, affording access to the Simplon Pass. =A7/A26 Bettole ‚Äì Predosa Link= The Autostrada A7/A26 Diramazione Bettole-Predosa (A7/A26) is a 17 km motorway which links the A26 near Predosa with the Autostrada A7 near Bettole (a frazione of Pozzolo Formigaro).

The musical opened at the Martin Beck Theatre in New York on March 30, 1946, and ran for 113 performances. The original cast included Robert Pope (Badfoot), Harold Nicholas (Little Augie), Fayard Nicholas (Barney), June Hawkins (Lilli), Pearl Bailey (Butterfly), Ruby Hill (Della Green), Rex Ingram (Biglow Brown), and Milton J. Williams (Mississippi).St Louis Woman It is based upon the novel God Sends Sunday by African-American writer Arna Bontemps. Background The idea for the St. Louis Woman musical was developed by Hollywood producer Ed Gross, who wanted to create a musical based upon Arna Bontemps' novel God Sends Sunday. The novel had already been adapted into a straight theatrical stage play by Bontemps and poet Countee Cullen in the early 1930s. Gross wanted a musical for the talents of Lena Horne and thought that a musical version of Bontemps' novel would be a powerful vehicle for her. He approached Cullen to write the book and Arlen and Mercer to write the music for the project. All of them accepted. Although Arlen and Mercer created what some consider to be their best score, the musical suffered from many misfortunes during production. First, the book suffered several serious problems. The show was not really a comedy and did not lend itself to standard Broadway musical treatment of its themes. Throughout the drama, any happiness the characters attain is offset by the deepest feeling of gloom. The correct balance for a musical comedy was never achieved, and a book that could have become an opera was treated neither humorously nor dramatically. These problems were compounded by the fact that Cullen died before rehearsals even began, and Ayers and Rouben Mamoulian, who came in after to work on the show's narrative, could not fix the show's sprawling plot. Secondly, the NAACP criticised the musical for \\"offering roles that detract from the dignity of our race\\". Lena Horne agreed with this assessment and refused to star in the show saying she had no intention of portraying \\"a flashy lady of easy virtue\\". When the show eventually opened there were several protests by African Americans outside the theatre, which negatively affected sales. Finally, the show suffered several staffing problems. The choreographer was replaced midway through production and the show's leading lady, Ruby Hill, was replaced after its pre-Broadway tryout in Boston. Hill returned to the show after only three performances in New York at the insistence of the show's cast, in particular Pearl Bailey. The show opened at the Martin Beck Theater on March 30, 1946, and lasted for only 113 performances.St. Louis Woman, musical play: Information and Much More from Answers.com Synopsis The story is set in St Louis in 1898. Little Augie, a jockey who is on a winning streak, is enamoured of Della Green, the belle of St Louis. Della, however, is the girlfriend of Biglow Brown, the proprietor of the local bar. Biglow is abusive toward Della and she decides to leave him. Brown's previous mistress, Lila, is still around which produces complications. And then there is the barmaid, Butterfly. She is in love with Barney, another jockey, but unlike Little Augie, Barney is older and not that lucky. But Butterfly doesn't want things to go too far with Barney until she gets that elusive wedding ring. It's cakewalking time and Augie attracts the attention and admiration of Della with his virtuoso performance of the cakewalk. Things go so well between them that they agree to set up home together and prepare plans to marry. But, things are not destined to go smoothly. While Augie is off at the racetrack, Della gets an unwelcome visit from Biglow Brown. When she refuses to have anything more to do with him he beats her. It is at this point that Lila enters and begs Biglow to take her back. Augie returns and a shot is fired. Brown believing he has been shot by Augie swears a curse on him although it was, in fact, Lila who fired the gun. Although Augie is suspected by everyone that he killed Biglow Brown, it is at Brown's funeral that Lila confesses. However, the curse cast by Brown seems to be working. Augie's horses are no longer winning and Della blames herself for all the problems that have overcome them. She leaves, pretending that she wants a better life than that which can now be provided by Augie. Della's new friend, the new bar-owner, nonetheless tells Augie of Della's true feelings. Augie believes the curse to be so much mumbo-jumbo. He'll win his next race and he and Della can get back together again. He does - and they do!

Bostick (March 5, 1916 ‚Äì January 19, 1991) was an American physicist who discovered plasmoids, plasma focus, and plasma vortex phenomena. He simulated cosmical astrophysics with laboratory plasma experiments, and showed that Hubble expansion can be produced with repulsive mutual induction between neighboring galaxies acting as homopolar generators. His work on plasmas was claimed to be evidence for finite-sized elementary particles and the composition of strings, but this is not accepted by mainstream science. Biography Winston H. Bostick, born in Freeport, Illinois, received both his B.S. and Ph.D. degrees from the University of Chicago. His Ph.D. thesis on cosmic rays was completed under the direction of Nobel laureate Arthur Compton. While working at the MIT Radiation Laboratory from 1941 to 1948, he helped build a microwave linear electron accelerator. As an associate professor of Tufts University from 1948 to 1954, he researched magnetic pinch effects, which led to his later work on plasma pinch effects. His discoveries of plasmoids and other plasma-related effects began between 1954 and 1956 at the Lawrence Livermore Laboratory, where he continued to act as consultant.

When the rewrite is not using existing code at all, it is common to speak of a rewrite from scratch. Motivations A piece of software is typically rewritten when one or more of the following apply: *its source code is not available or is only available under an incompatible license *its code cannot be adapted to a new target platform *its existing code has become too difficult to handle and extend *the task of debugging it seems too complicated *the programmer finds it difficult to understand its source code *developers learn new techniques or wish to do a big feature overhaul which requires much change *developers learn that new codes written may extend content options that can fix or overwrite previous problems *the programming language of the source code has to be changed Risks Several software engineers, such as Joel Spolsky have warned against total rewrites, especially under schedule constraints or competitive pressures. While developers may initially welcome the chance to correct historical design mistakes, a rewrite also discards those parts of the design that work as required. A rewrite commits the development team to deliver not just new features, but all those that exist in the previous code, while potentially introducing new bugs or regressions of previously fixed bugs. A rewrite also interferes with the tracking of unfixed bugs in the old version. The incremental rewrite is an alternative approach, in which developers gradually replace the existing code with calls into a new implementation, expanding that implementation until it fully replaces the old one. This approach avoids a broad loss of functionality during the rewrite. Cleanroom software engineering is another approach, which requires the team to work from an exhaustive written specification of the software's functionality, without access to its code. Notable examples Netscape's project to improve HTML layout in Navigator 4 has been cited as an example of a failed rewrite. The new layout engine (Gecko) had developed independently from Navigator and did not integrate readily with Navigator's code; hence Navigator itself was rewritten around the new engine, breaking many existing features and delaying release by several months. Meanwhile, Microsoft focused on incremental improvements to Internet Explorer and did not face the same obstacles. Ironically, Navigator itself was a successful cleanroom rewrite of NCSA Mosaic overseen by that program's developers. See Browser wars.

Section 212 permits deductions for investment expenses. not personalIRC ¬ß 262. or capital expenses (i.e., long-term, tangible assets, such as property).IRC ¬ß 263(a). Capital expenditures either create cost basis or add to a preexisting cost basis and cannot be deducted in the year the taxpayer pays or incurs the expenditure. In terms of its accounting treatment, an expense is recorded immediately and impacts directly the income statement of the company, reducing its net profit. In contrast, a capital expenditure is capitalized, recorded as an asset and depreciated over time.  Four ways costs can be capital expenditures  The Internal Revenue Code, Treasury Regulations (including new regulations proposed in 2006), and case law set forth a series of guidelines that help to distinguish expenses from capital expenditures, although in reality distinguishing between these two types of costs can be extremely difficult. In general, four types of costs related to tangible property must be capitalized:For more on this subject, see Donaldson, Samuel A., Federal Income Taxation of Individuals: Cases, Problems and Materials 170-92 (2d ed. 2007). 1\\\\. Costs that produce a benefit that will last substantially beyond the end of the taxable year.Prop. Reg. ¬ß 1.263(a)-2(d)(4)(i). 2\\\\. New assets that have a useful life substantially beyond one year. For example, in Commissioner v. Idaho Power Co.,418 U.S. 1 (1974). the taxpayer used its own equipment to construct and improve various facilities that it owned. The taxpayer sought to have the depreciation of the construction equipment treated as a deduction. The Court held that because the equipment was used to invest in a capital asset ‚Äì the new and improved facilities ‚Äì the costs had to be treated as capital expenditures.This result was codified in IRC ¬ß 263A, the uniform capitalization (or UNICAP) rules. 3\\\\. Improvements that prolong the life of the property,Prop. Reg. ¬ß 1.263(a)-3(f)(1). restore property to a ‚Äúlike-new‚Äù condition, or add value to the property.Prop. Reg. ¬ß 1.263(a)-3(d)(1). For example, in Fedex Corp. v. United States,291 F. Supp. 2d 699 (W.D. Tenn. 2003). the taxpayer performed repairs upon jet engines by removing them from the airplane and then having parts replaced. The taxpayer argued that these expenses were deductible, but the IRS stated that the costs should be capitalized. The court held that the inspection and replacement costs could be deducted because the improvements did not add to the value and did not prolong the life of the airplanes as a whole.Prop. Reg. ¬ß 1.263(a)-3(d)(2)(v) sets forth nine factors to use when determining whether an item should be treated as an individual piece of property or as part of a whole. In Midland Empire Packing Co. v. Commissioner,14 T.C. 635 (1950). the taxpayer added a concrete lining to its basement floor to prevent oil from seeping into where the taxpayer stored meat. The taxpayer argued that the costs of installation were deductible and the tax court agreed. The costs of installation only permitted the taxpayer to continue the plant‚Äôs operation. The expenses did not add to the value of the business or permit the taxpayer to make new uses of the basement. 4\\\\. Adaptations that permit the property to be used for a new or different purpose. In contrast to Midland Empire Packing Co., in Mt. Morris Drive-In Theatre Co. v. Commissioner,25 T.C. 272 (1955). under threat of litigation, the taxpayer was forced to create a new drainage system to prevent run-off rainwater from flooding his neighbor's farm. The taxpayer argued that these costs were deductible, but the tax court disagreed. Because the taxpayer knew in advance the property had an inadequate drainage system, the costs to accomplish this adaptation of the property were a capital expenditure. The costs were not simply an improvement of the preexisting drainage system, but rather a completely new addition to the property that permitted the taxpayer to use the property as a drive-in theater. Though it is an oversimplification, when trying to distinguish between expenses and capital expenditures it can be helpful to remember that the U.S. tax code attempts to levy tax on those most able to pay it.  Illustrative Example  Imagine that a business buys a truck for $50,000 and uses $5,000 this year on gasoline to distribute tomatoes upon which it earned $20,000. If we want to apportion tax on the business according to its abilities to pay we should ask, \\"how much better off is the businesses businesses in Year One?\\" It seems unfair to say that the business is $20,000 better off than at the beginning of the year - after all it spent $55,000 to earn those $20,000. However, it also seems unfair to say that the business is $35,000 worse off (the $20,000 earned minus the $55,000 spent) ‚Äì after all it also has a truck which it will use for years to come. Probably the fairest characterization is to say that in Year One the business earned $20,000, spent $5,000 on gas, and \\"spent\\" some (but not all) of the value of the truck it purchased. Since the $5,000 on gas was consumed in Year One and all of its value has been provided during Year One its full cost is properly offset against the income of Year One. In other words it is an expense, and it is recorded right away as such. On the other hand, the truck will contribute to income in Year One, but also contribute to income in future years. Since the truck‚Äôs benefits are spread over the years that the truck is in use, we will want to spread the cost of the truck over those subsequent years as well. Otherwise the business would appear overly burdened in Year One and unnaturally profitable every year thereafter. Thus the truck is a capital expenditure which should be depreciated. However, keep in mind that while depreciation spreads the cost of a capital asset over several years (for tax purposes) it is not intended to actually mirror the real world wear and tear on the asset.

An influential, powerful, and wealthy nobleman of Venice, he is a middle-aged man and a merchant by trade who has his financial interests tied up in overseas shipments when the play begins. He is kind, generous, honest, and confident, and is loved and revered by all the Christians who know him, but not by the Jew Shylock. Antonio Act 1 ‚Äì When we first see him commiserating with his friends Salanio and Salarino he is pondering the unknown source of his depressive state: Antonio: Well, tell me now, what lady is the same To whom you swore a secret pilgrimage That you today promised to tell me of? (The Merchant of Venice 1.1.119‚Äì121) Bassanio then proceeds to tell Antonio of his depleted financial state due to his own excesses, making sure to note that he is aware he already owes him money. He laments his ill-fortune but cheers at the thought of solving his problems by marrying Portia, a woman who has come into a sizeable inheritance from her father and whom he thinks is predisposed to choose him. He compares himself with Jason and his quest for the Golden Fleece. He beseeches Antonio to back this venture knowing he is not likely to be refused by his generous benefactor. Indeed, Antonio, despite the fact that his capital is already at risk elsewhere, gives him a letter of credit and wishes him well. Later Antonio enters the Rialto to assure Shylock that he will be bound for the 3,000 ducats Bassanio wishes to borrow. Antonio has belittled and harassed Shylock in public, and he loathes him because when Christian friends of his owed money to the Jews he paid off the debts, thus depriving them of their interest. Far from lamenting his ill-treatment of the Jew who accuses him of spitting on him and calling him a dog, Antonio replies resolutely \\"I am as like to call thee so again, /To spet on thee again, to spurn thee.\\" (MoV 1.3.127‚Äì128) He agrees to pay with a pound of flesh if he forfeits the bond in lieu of the usual interest. Act 2 ‚Äì Antonio makes a brief appearance in this act in scene 6 when he runs into Gratiano and tells him he has twenty people out looking for him. He goes on to say there will be no mosque and that Bassanio is at that moment preparing to leave for Belmont to win Portia. Act 3 ‚Äì We hear no more from Antonio until after Bassanio wins the hand of the wealthy Portia by correctly guessing which of three caskets holds her portrait. Gratiano proposes to Nerissa, Portia's maid in waiting and friend. In the midst of his merrymaking, he receives a letter detailing Antonio's misfortune. None of the ships have returned to port and as such he has no funds to pay the bond with. His flesh is forfeit to the Jew who is intent on having it. He insists he does not regret helping Bassanio and even does not wish him to feel guilty. He only asks him to come and attend his death so that he can see him one last time. Bassanio, along with Gratiano, rushes off with three times the amount owed and his wife's blessing. The gentlemen leave in such a rush that they cannot consummate their marriages. Antonio, with Solanio and the jailer in attendance, tries to reason with Shylock and convince him to stop pursuing payment of the flesh, but to no avail. Further angered by the elopement and conversion of his daughter Jessica to one of Antonio's Christian friends, Shylock is more determined than ever on revenge. Shylock looks to the law to allow him to fulfill in a legal manner his murderous intent. Antonio is not optimistic about his chances of remarking that \\"The Duke cannot deny the course of law.\\" (MoV 3.3.26) As Antonio knows, Venice's economy depended heavily on the business of foreigners as it was an important port for trade with many nations. As Jews were considered foreigners, the fair adjudication of Shylock's contract was necessary to keep secure the trade of the city. Act 4 ‚Äì This act begins with Antonio's trial. The Duke pleads with Shylock to give \\"a gentle answer\\", a double entendre on the word Gentile, which meant someone, not a Jew. Shylock refuses to deny his bond. Bassanio and Gratiano are in attendance and advocate strongly that the Jew be thwarted by any means necessary. Bassanio attempts to bribe him with three times the amount of the bond. Shylock says he will have nothing but his pound of flesh. All is lost until Portia and Nerissa arrive in the guise of young men pretending to be a learned doctor Balthasar and his clerk. Portia pleads for mercy and getting no further than the previous applicants she seems at first to confirm the strength of the bond and tells Antonio to prepare to pay it. When all seems hopeless Bassanio declares his despair: Various interpreters began to read Antonio as homosexual in the 1950s, but there have been many objections. In that time period, the language was much more expressive, so people in the modern-day society took Antonio to be homosexual. Some modern productions use the theory that Antonio is suffering from his love for Bassanio to explain his melancholic behavior. Many scholars, such as O'Rourke, gather from the writing of Shakespeare that Antonio is gay and in a relationship with Bassanio. Lines by Antonio such as \\"my person ... lie[s] all unlocked to your occasions\\" (MoV 1.1.146), seem to allude to a sexual dimension in Antonio's love for Bassanio. However, there is also evidence that the two shared a strictly fraternal, familial bond, as indicated by the line \\"Bassanio, your most noble kinsman\\" (MoV 1.1.60) Other scholars maintain that all attempts to read Shakespeare's characters as gay or normal in terms of the modern understanding of the word are culturally and historically flawed. Alan Bray's book Homosexuality in Renaissance England argues that in the time period of The Merchant of Venices composition, \\"homosexuality\\" did not refer to an individual's sexual identity but only to specific sexual acts any individual might engage in. As Bray writes: \\"To talk of an individual of this period as being or not being 'a homosexual' is an anachronism and ruinously misleading. The temptation to debauchery, from which homosexuality was not clearly distinguished, was accepted as part of the common lot. Homosexuality [as understood in 15th-century England] was a sin 'to which men's natural corruption and viciousness [were] prone'\\" (16‚Äì17, Rainolds quoted in ). According to the Verity edition of The Merchant of Venice, it is stated that Antonio and Bassanio are best friends; Bassanio is bound to Antonio for being his friend.

Kinetic proofreading allows enzymes to discriminate between two possible reaction pathways leading to correct or incorrect products with an accuracy higher than what one would predict based on the difference in the activation energy between these two pathways. Increased specificity is obtained by introducing an irreversible step exiting the pathway, with reaction intermediates leading to incorrect products more likely to prematurely exit the pathway than reaction intermediates leading to the correct product. If the exit step is fast relative to the next step in the pathway, the specificity can be increased by a factor of up to the ratio between the two exit rate constants. (If the next step is fast relative to the exit step, specificity will not be increased because there will not be enough time for exit to occur.) This can be repeated more than once to increase specificity further.  Specificity paradox  In protein synthesis, the error rate is on the order of 1 in 10,000. This means that when a ribosome is matching anticodons of tRNA to the codons of mRNA, it matches complementary sequences correctly nearly all the time. Hopfield noted that because of how similar the substrates are (the difference between a wrong codon and a right codon can be as small as a difference in a single base), an error rate that small is unachievable with a one-step mechanism. Both wrong and right tRNA can bind to the ribosome, and if the ribosome can only discriminate between them by complementary matching of the anticodon, it must rely on the small free energy difference between binding three matched complementary bases or only two. A one-shot machine which tests whether the codons match or not by examining whether the codon and anticodon are bound will not be able to tell the difference between wrong and right codon with an error rate less than e^{-10} unless the free energy difference is at least 10kT, which is much larger than the free energy difference for single codon binding. This is a thermodynamic bound, so it cannot be evaded by building a different machine. However, this can be overcome by kinetic proofreading, which introduces an irreversible step through the input of energy. Another molecular recognition mechanism, which does not require expenditure of free energy is that of conformational proofreading. The incorrect product may also be formed but hydrolyzed at a greater rate than the correct product, giving the possibility of theoretically infinite specificity the longer you let this reaction run, but at the cost of large amounts of the correct product as well. (Thus there is a tradeoff between product production and its efficiency.) The hydrolytic activity may be on the same enzyme, as in DNA polymerases with editing functions, or on different enzymes.  Multistep ratchet  Hopfield suggested a simple way to achieve smaller error rates using a molecular ratchet which takes many irreversible steps, each testing to see if the sequences match. At each step, energy is expended and specificity (the ratio of correct substrate to incorrect substrate at that point in the pathway) increases. The requirement for energy in each step of the ratchet is due to the need for the steps to be irreversible; for specificity to increase, entry of substrate and analogue must occur largely through the entry pathway, and exit largely through the exit pathway. If entry were an equilibrium, the earlier steps would form a pre-equilibrium and the specificity benefits of entry into the pathway (less likely for the substrate analogue) would be lost; if the exit step were an equilibrium, then the substrate analogue would be able to re- enter the pathway through the exit step, bypassing the specificity of earlier steps altogether. Although one test will only be able to discriminate between mismatched and matched sequences a fraction p=e^{-\\\\Delta F/kT} of the time, two tests will both fail only p^2 of the time, and N tests will fail p^N of the time. In terms of free energy, the discrimination power of N successive tests for two states with a free energy \\\\Delta F is the same as one test between two states with a free energy N\\\\Delta F. To achieve an error rate of e^{-10} requires several comparison steps. Hopfield predicted on the basis of this theory that there is a multistage ratchet in the ribosome which tests the match several times before incorporating the next amino acid into the protein. Experimental examples Comparison between a classical mechanism of molecular interaction (A) and a kinetic proofreading with one step (B). Due to the added reaction labelled in orange in (B), the production rate of the red bead is much more dependent on the value of k_{-1} which is the purpose of kinetic proofreading. * Charging tRNAs with their respective amino-acids ‚Äì the enzyme that charges the tRNA is called aminoacyl tRNA synthetase. This enzyme utilizes a high energy intermediate state to increase the fidelity of binding the right pair of tRNA and amino-acid. In this case, energy is used to make the high-energy intermediate (making the entry pathway irreversible), and the exit pathway is irreversible by virtue of the high energy difference in dissociation. * Homologous recombination ‚Äì Homologous recombination facilitates the exchange between homologous or almost homologous DNA strands. During this process, the RecA protein polymerizes along a DNA and this DNA- protein filament searches for a homologous DNA sequence. Both processes of RecA polymerization and homology search utilize the kinetic proofreading mechanism. * DNA damage recognition and repair ‚Äì a certain DNA repair mechanism utilizes kinetic proofreading to discriminate damaged DNA. Some DNA polymerases can also detect when they have added an incorrect base and are able to hydrolyze it immediately; in this case, the irreversible (energy- requiring) step is addition of the base. * Antigen discrimination by T cell receptors ‚Äì T cells respond to foreign antigens at low concentrations, while ignoring any self-antigens present at much higher concentration. This ability is known as antigen discrimination. T-cell receptors use kinetic proofreading to discriminate between high and low affinity antigens presented on an MHC molecule. The intermediate steps of kinetic proofreading are realized by multiple rounds of phosphorylation of the receptor and its adaptor proteins. Theoretical considerations =Universal first passage time= Biochemical processes that use kinetic proofreading to improve specificity implement the delay-inducing multistep ratchet by a variety of distinct biochemical networks. Nonetheless, many such networks result in the times to completion of the molecular assembly and the proofreading steps (also known as the first passage time) that approach a near-universal, exponential shape for high proofreading rates and large network sizes. Since exponential completion times are characteristic of a two-state Markov process, this observation makes kinetic proofreading one of only a few examples of biochemical processes where structural complexity results in a much simpler large-scale, phenomenological dynamics. =Topology= The increase in specificity, or the overall amplification factor of a kinetic proofreading network that may include multiple pathways and especially loops is intimately related to the topology of the network: the specificity grows exponentially with the number of loops in the network. An example is homologous recombination in which the number of loops scales like the square of DNA length. The universal completion time emerges precisely in this regime of large number of loops and high amplification.

In it, Teitelbaum argues that Zionism is incompatible with Judaism. As Teitelbaum explains in the introduction, the book's title is taken from the biblical verse of Exodus 2:21, and hints to Teitelbaum's first name (Yoel), and to his grandfather, Moshe Teitelbaum. The verse, which states, \\"And Moses agreed to stay ... an alien in a foreign land\\", hints to Teitelbaum's conclusion that the Jewish people should remain in exile. The book is considered to be Teitelbaum's magnum opus, and is of the utmost importance to Satmar Hasidim, as well as to other Haredim who follow the Satmar doctrine regarding Zionism. Satmar Hasidism has many institutions, buildings, and neighborhoods named after the book. Vayoel Moshe is primarily a book of Halacha, Jewish law. However, it draws on Rabbinic Jewish philosophy as well. Structure The book consists of three parts: 1\\\\. Maamar Shalosh Shevuos (Treatise regarding the Three Oaths), is an in depth analysis of the Three Oaths and their practical halachic implications. The \\"Three Oaths\\" are originally detailed by the Talmud in tractate Ketubot. (Please note that the English translation is highly subjective) The Talmud discusses a passage from the Song of Songs in the Tanakh (Hebrew Bible) in which God made the Israelites promise \\"to wait for Him before arousing his love\\", as \\"King Solomon in Song of Songs thrice adjured the daughters of Jerusalem not to arouse or bestir the love until it is ready\\". The Talmud explains that the Jewish people are bound by three oaths: * Not to ascend to Eretz Yisrael \\"like a wall\\" (i. e., in a strong manner). * Not to rebel against the nations of the world. * Not to delay the coming of the Messiah. The Talmud follows the discussion of the oaths with a strong warning: > ... Rabbi Elazar said: The Holy One, Blessed be He, said to the Jewish > people: If you fulfill the oath, it is good, and if not, I will abandon your > flesh, and all will devour you like the gazelles and like the hinds of the > field. Teitelbaum discusses the legal status of the oaths, and what they imply. He argues that while the oaths are clearly metaphorical, and do not have the legal status of actual oaths,Vayoel Moshe, Maamar Shalosh Shevuos, siman 36 they are to be understood as guidelines for what is considered to be an attempt to leave exile before divine redemption, which he posits is severely forbidden and is tantamount to heresy.Vayoel Moshe, Maamar Shalosh Shevuos, simanim 42-45 2\\\\. Maamar Yishuv Eretz Yisroel (Treatise about settling the Land of Israel), which seeks to clarify if there is a halachic obligation to dwell in the land of Israel, as well as general halachic concerns regarding Jews emigrating to Israel, known as Aliyah. 3\\\\. Maamar Leshon HaKodesh (Treatise about the holy tongue), in which Teitelbaum writes that not only is there no reason to choose to speak Modern Hebrew, it is actually forbidden. This was written as a personal answer to the chief rabbi of Montreal at the time, Rabbi Pinchas Hirschsprung, and it was later added into this book. =Other arguments= # Rabbi Teitelbaum refers to religious Zionism as a \\"major desecration of God's name\\". # Blames Zionism for worsening, and the aveirah of Zionism for being a cause of, the Holocaust, both in direct ways, as well as on a spiritual level, by causing the fulfillment of the slaughter the Talmud says will happen if the oaths are violated. # Refers to Zionist leaders such as Theodor Herzl as \\"heretics\\". # Argues that any participation in the Israeli elections is one of the worst sins, and halachically, a Jew must rather be killed than vote. # Blames some of the bloodshed in the Middle East on the Zionists. # Rules that it is forbidden to accept any money from Israeli government programs. # Asserts that the way of the Baal Shem Tov is forgotten today, and that Hasidus is no longer properly understood.Vayoel Moshe, Maamar Shalosh Shevuos, siman 185 # Argues against the practice of making decisions on the basis of folk tales about Hasidic Rabbis, especially in matters of Halacha. # Stresses that blind faith in the righteous is foolish, as even genuinely learned and pious scholars can be misled, make errors, or abandon their righteous ways; rather, a person must conduct his own examination of the original sources.Vayoel Moshe, Maamar Shalosh Shevuos, siman 142-175 See also * Three Oaths External links *Rabbi Gil Student's arguments against Vayoel Moshe, with a counter argument * The book Vayoel Moshe (full in Hebrew) * An English translation of Vayoel Moshe in progress, as well as lectures in English. * Rav Aviner's response to Vayoel Moshe * Shaul Magid: The Satmar Are Anti-Zionist.

Take S to be the set of all C1 functions from E into E‚àó; E‚àó can be thought of as a subspace of E in view of the inclusions ::E^{*} \\\\xrightarrow{i^{*}} H^{*} \\\\cong H \\\\xrightarrow{i} E. :For h ‚àà S, define Ah by ::(A h)(x) = h(x) x - \\\\mathrm{trace}_{H} \\\\mathrm{D} h(x). :This operator A is an integration by parts operator, also known as the divergence operator; a proof can be found in Elworthy (1974). * The classical Wiener space C0 of continuous paths in Rn starting at zero and defined on the unit interval [0, 1] has another integration by parts operator. Let S be the collection ::S = \\\\left\\\\\\\\{ \\\\left. h \\\\colon C_{0} \\\\to L_{0}^{2, 1} \\\\right h \\\\mbox{ is bounded and non-anticipating} \\\\right\\\\\\\\}, :i.e., all bounded, adapted processes with absolutely continuous sample paths. Let œÜ : C0 -> R be any C1 function such that both œÜ and DœÜ are bounded. For h ‚àà S and Œª ‚àà R, the Girsanov theorem implies that ::\\\\int_{C_{0}} \\\\varphi (x + \\\\lambda h(x)) \\\\, \\\\mathrm{d} \\\\gamma(x) = \\\\int_{C_{0}} \\\\varphi(x) \\\\exp \\\\left( \\\\lambda \\\\int_{0}^{1} \\\\dot{h}_{s} \\\\cdot \\\\mathrm{d} x_{s} - \\\\frac{\\\\lambda^{2}}{2} \\\\int_{0}^{1}  \\\\dot{h}_{s} ^{2} \\\\, \\\\mathrm{d} s \\\\right) \\\\, \\\\mathrm{d} \\\\gamma(x). :Differentiating with respect to Œª and setting Œª = 0 gives ::\\\\int_{C_{0}} \\\\mathrm{D} \\\\varphi(x) h(x) \\\\, \\\\mathrm{d} \\\\gamma(x) = \\\\int_{C_{0}} \\\\varphi(x) (A h) (x) \\\\, \\\\mathrm{d} \\\\gamma(x), :where (Ah)(x) is the It≈ç integral ::\\\\int_{0}^{1} \\\\dot{h}_{s} \\\\cdot \\\\mathrm{d} x_{s}. :The same relation holds for more general œÜ by an approximation argument; thus, the It≈ç integral is an integration by parts operator and can be seen as an infinite- dimensional divergence operator. This is the same result as the integration by parts formula derived from the Clark-Ocone theorem.

The festival offers musical performances, workshops, film screenings, yoga, group meditation, fire performance, art gallery and a variety of visual exhibits. Boom Festival takes place every two years and is the largest biennial transformation and psytrance Music Festival in Europe, one of the most famous Transformational festivals in the World. Overview Art Boom Festival began in 1997 as a psychedelic trance music festival with a main stage and a lounge area with mellow, \\"chill-out music\\". Now, there are five stages: the Dance Temple, for psytrance and natural trance music; the Alchemy Circle is for many fresh experimental genres, techno , psychedelic trance , House and unique combinations of those; the Sacred Fire stage is for world music and live music performances; the Ambient Source is for chill-out music; the Funky Beach stage is for electronic dance music dee jays and producers. Other attractions include sculptures, an art gallery, street theatre, and fire performances. Within the shaded Liminal Village are lectures, yoga classes, film screenings, group meditation, and discussions. The Healing Area has group workshops for healing techniques, a pool for water therapy and a massage area. Objective Boom's main focus is to integrate a sustainability ethos with arts and culture. By design, it does not provide corporate entertainment or sponsors. The key goal is to provide a transformational festival for people of different ethnic backgrounds, nationality and ages. In its own words, \\"Boom is not only a festival, it is a state of mind. Inspired by the principles of Oneness, Peace, Creativity, Sustainability, Transcendence, Alternative Culture, Active Participation, Evolution and Love, it is a space where people from all over the world can converge to experience an alternative reality.\\" The festival is entirely funded by ticket sales. It does not use corporate sponsors, which eliminates marketing that is seen as visual pollution. Self-sustainability In 2004, Boom began a series of environmentally self-sustainable projects, which includes: toilets that don't use chemical products, the treatment of residual waters using biotechnology, utilization of wind and solar energy, recycling and the free supply of cleaning kits to participants (including pocket ashtrays and rubbish bags). It has been assessed and awarded Outstanding in the Internationally recognised Greener Festival Award in 2008, 2010, 2012, 2014, and 2016. In 2011, it won, for the second year in a row, the title of YOUROPE Green 'N' Clean Festival of the Year in the Festival Awards Europe.

Nagatsuma is currently the deputy leader and the head of the Tokyo chapter of the CDP. He had served as the Minister of Health, Labour, and Welfare in the Hatoyama and Kan administration. He came to prominence when he reported missing records of public pension plans.Norimitsu Onishi, The New York Times, July 19, 2008: No Longer a Reporter, but a Muckraker Within Japan‚Äôs Parliament A native of Nerima, Tokyo and graduate of Keio University, he was elected for the first time in 2000 after unsuccessful runs in 1995 and 1996.  Political career  = DPJ years = Nagatsuma gained nationwide prominence after exposing scandals involving Japan's bureaucracy, including widespread mishandling of the national pension records and the misuse of public funds for kickbacks. He earned the nickname Mr Pension for his investigations into these scandals. His experience and expertise on pensions led him to be appointed to the Health, Labour, and Welfare Ministry during the administrations of Prime Ministers Yukio Hatoyama and Naoto Kan. After Prime Minister Kan's first cabinet reshuffle, he moved to the DPJ party leadership and became the first vice secretary-general of the party. He continued to be active in the Diet after leaving his cabinet post and became the chairman of the Welfare and Labour Committee in the House of Representatives in 2012. In December the same year, a general election was held and the LDP returned into power. Amidst large swings against the DPJ, Nagatsuma managed to hold his seat. Nagatsuma and Akihisa Nagashima were the only DPJ representatives in Tokyo to win single-seat constituencies in the election. Nagashima was defeated in his district in 2014, leaving Nagatsuma as the only DPJ member with a constituency seat in Tokyo. Nagatsuma continued to rise through the ranks of the party after the 2012 defeat. He became DPJ's deputy secretary-general in May 2013. After then-party leader Banri Kaieda was defeated in the 2014 election, Nagatsuma entered the race to succeed him, but lost to Katsuya Okada. Okada then appointed Nagatsuma to be the party's deputy leader, a position he held even after the merger with Japan Innovation Party. After the election of Seiji Maehara as a president of the post-merger Democratic Party (DP) in September 2017, Nagatsuma was appointed as the party's election campaign committee and its Tokyo chapter chairman. = Formation of the CDP = Less than three weeks after the conclusion of the leadership race, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe called for a snap general election in October. Earlier on the day of the PM's declaration, Tokyo governor Yuriko Koike formed Kib≈ç no T≈ç, intended to be a conservative alternative to the LDP. Many conservative-leaning DP members migrated en masse to Kib≈ç after Maehara allowed DP members to run in the election under Kib≈ç's banner. However, Koike imposed an ideological test that effectively barred liberal DP members from joining Kib≈ç. This spurred DP deputy president Yukio Edano to form the CDP just three weeks before the election. Nagatsuma, a founding member, was tapped as the party's deputy leader. The burgeoning CDP campaign received a surge of support in the run-up to election day. CDP made significant gains in the election across the country, becoming the country's largest opposition party. The surge was also replicated in Tokyo, where the campaign was led by Nagatsuma. LDP's majorities were cut in seats where CDP were contesting. Some were overturned, as in the case of former DPJ leaders Kan and Kaieda, who contested under the CDP banner and regained their seats. After the election, Nagatsuma became the CDP's Tokyo chapter head.

His legend states that he was martyred on the Via Laurentina and his passio places his martyrdom during the reign of Nero, on October 12, 60 AD. His companions are named as Thermantia (Termanzia), Christina, his servant Victoria, and the priest Priscus. Veneration During the papacy of Gregory the Great, there existed at San Paolo fuori le Mura a monastery dedicated to Edistus. In the seventh century, his relics, as well as those belonging to Christina and Victoria, were still venerated there. The sepulcher of Edistus was located at the sixteenth milestone of the Via Ardeatina. A church in honor of him existed there, which was restored during the papacy of Adrian I (772-795). There also existed a papal estate (domusculta) there called Sancti Edisti. He is patron of an old church on the Monte Soratte, near which a town, Sant'Oreste, is named after him. The first mention of Sant‚ÄôOreste is made by Benedict of Soracte in his Chronicon in 747 AD, in which he mentions Curtis Sancii Heristi. One source states that the toponym derives from the family of the Aristi or Edisti. A member of this family was martyred for his faith around 68 AD. Linguistic corruptions transformed the name from Sanctus Edistus to Sanctus Heristus, Santo Resto, San Tresto, Sant'Oreste. Mount Soratte seen from Via Flaminia. According to the legendary account of his martyrdom, he was a soldier who had been christened by Saint Peter. At a site called Laurento, a sandpit (arenario), Edistus participated in a mass at which Priscus was officiating. Thermantia, Christina, and the servant Victoria were present. When they were discovered by the authorities, they were buried alive in the same sandpit, with the exception of Victoria, who managed to escape, but who was later killed in a nearby forest. A church and village grew on the site of sandpit. This was the curtis Sancti Heristi. The village later moved to the slopes of Mount Soratte for better defense against raiders.

After World War II he emigrated to the United States, where he became a full professor at the University of San Francisco. Life Born 20 January 1917 in Lw√≥w, Poland (now Lviv, Ukraine), Lerski studied law at Lw√≥w University. In interwar Poland he joined the Stronnictwo Demokratyczne (Polish Democratic Party); he became known for his strong opposition to anti-semitic events. Jerzy Lerski first saw action in World War II during the 1939 Polish September Campaign. He fought in the Battle of Brze≈õƒá Litewski in the rank of officer cadet (podchorƒÖ≈ºy, ensign). Taken prisoner by the Soviet Army during the Soviet invasion, he managed to escape from a train transport. He joined the anti-Soviet resistance but, with the NKVD (the Soviet Secret Police) actively looking for him, he escaped via Hungary to France, joining the Polish Armed Forces in the West. After the fall of France on 25 June 1940, Lerski went to Great Britain. In 1941, after taking a commando course, he became a \\"cichociemny\\" (a member of a secret unit of the Polish Army in exile). Parachuting into occupied Poland in February 1943, he served as one of the couriers for the Polish Government in Exile ‚Äì individuals who risked their lives, moving between the Polish Government in Exile, in London, England, and the Polish Secret State in occupied Poland. After collecting information from the Secret State, he returned to London. In November 1944 he was appointed secretary to the third Prime Minister of Poland in Exile, Tomasz Arciszewski (1877‚Äì1955). At a meeting between Arciszewski and the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, Winston Churchill, Lerski gave a detailed report on the plight of the Jews in Poland. After 8 May 1945, when World War II ended in Europe, Lerski decided to remain in London instead of returning to Soviet-dominated communist Poland. He was active in the Polish political movement, Polski Ruch Wolno≈õciowy Niepodleg≈Ço≈õƒá i Demokracja. In July 1947 he resigned as Arciszewski's secretary. On the eve of the Cold War, Lerski moved from the United Kingdom to the United States. He obtained his Ph.D. in history from Georgetown University in 1953 and taught at several US universities before in 1956 joining the faculty at the University of San Francisco, where he became a professor and historian of East Central Europe. His courses at USF were on Modern European History. Politically a conservative Republican, he feared the armed power of the Soviet Union against the unprepared West. He was also a visiting scholar abroad, lecturing in Pakistan, Sri Lanka, and Japan. He retired from the University of San Francisco in 1982, but continued to lecture at the Fromm Institute for Lifelong Learning at the University of San Francisco. Lerski published books and articles on Polish history. He was a personal friend of Karol J√≥zef Wojty≈Ça, later Pope John Paul II. He supported Solidarno≈õƒá (Solidarity) founder and activist Lech Wa≈Çƒôsa.

Put another way, Pinker \\"probes the mystery of human nature by examining how we use words\\". The book became a New York Times best seller. Summary Pinker argues that language provides a window into human nature, and that \\"analyzing language can reveal what people are thinking and feeling.\\" He asserts that language must do two things: # convey a message to an audience, and # negotiate the social relationship between the speaker and the audience. Therefore, language functions at these two levels at all times. For example, a common-place statement such as \\"If you could pass the salt, that would be great\\" functions both as a request (though formally not a request) and as a means of being polite or non-offensive (through not directing the audience to overt demands). Pinker says of this example: Through this lens, Pinker asks questions such as \\"What does the peculiar syntax of swearing tell us about ourselves?\\" Or put another way, \\"Just what does the 'fuck' in 'fuck you' actually mean?\\", \\\\- as discussed in the chapter The Seven Words You Can't Say on Television.

Tribune-Star [Terre Haute, Indiana], April 28, 2007. Archived from the original. He was the son of Sara King Harvey, an English professor at Indiana State Teachers College in Terre Haute. An Eagle Scout, he skipped several grades and graduated from Terre Haute's Wiley High School in 1931. After working as a printer and reporter at the Danville Gazette (a newspaper owned by his grandfather) from 1931 to 1933, he enrolled in an accelerated program at Indiana University that encompassed two years of undergraduate studies and enabled him to complete an honors LL.B. from the University's School of Law in 1937. He married Libby McIntire, the daughter of a lawyer from Maysville, Kentucky, but the marriage ended in divorce in 1954. Immediately thereafter, he married Clara Grace \\"CG\\" Follock, a former CIA personnel officer who was the first woman to attain the rank of major in the United States Army. From 1960 to 1969, Harvey and his family (including a son from his first marriage and a daughter adopted by Harvey and Follock during his German assignment) were domiciled in Chevy Chase Village, Maryland.Flawed Patriot, p99 Career Harvey joined the Federal Bureau of Investigation in December 1940 and enjoyed a distinguished career (specializing in German and Soviet counterintelligence) throughout World War II and its immediate aftermath. In July 1947, he broke a regulation on being available on two-hour call due to sleeping off heavy drinking at a party the night before. He refused the resulting demotion and reassignment to Indianapolis, Indiana, preferring to resign. He joined the CIA shortly thereafter. As he plotted to reduce the FBI's overseas powers, his knowledge of the Bureau proved to be invaluable. Along with James Angleton, he became one of the foremost operatives in the secret war against the KGB during the Cold War. According to journalist David Martin, Harvey swiftly gained a reputation for consuming more alcohol than any other person in the United States government; however, no one ever saw him drunk during this period. Harvey's CIA career began with his founding of Staff D, the electronic surveillance branch of the Clandestine Service Division.Martin, David C. \\"The CIA's 'Loaded Gun'\\". Washington Post, October 10, 1976. In 1951 Harvey's investigation of the career history of Kim Philby, noting suspicious coincidences that suggested he had long been a Soviet agent, saw the CIA demand that Philby be kept out of his position as MI6 liaison; Philby was fired. Six months earlier, Harvey had got into a fight with Guy Burgess at a party after Burgess had drunkenly drawn a lewd cartoon of Harvey's wife.Flawed Patriot, p29-31 From 1952 to 1960, Harvey was posted to West Berlin as chief of base, where he led the operation that built a tunnel to the Soviet sector to spy on their communication channels. This operation was called PBJOINTLY. On his return to CIA headquarters, Harvey was tasked with a project to organize \\"executive actions\\" (a euphemism for the assassination of foreign political leaders) under the codename ZR/RIFLE. To vanquish Fidel Castro, Harvey decided he needed to employ the resources of the American Mafia. He drew on the connections of businessman and CIA asset Robert Maheu, who had cultivated relationships with Sam Giancana, Santo Trafficante Jr., Johnny Roselli and other figures. Finding Maheu's operation chaotic, Harvey cut everyone but Roselli out, and ran the operations against Castro himself. Harvey was also involved in Operation Mongoose, a CIA operation run from Miami, Florida that ran various attempts to undermine or overthrow the Cuban Revolution.Anderson, Jack. \\"6 Attempts to Kill Castro Laid to CIA.\\" The Washington Post, January 18, 1971. At the height of the Cuban Missile Crisis in October 1962, Harvey sent ten intelligence operatives into Cuba to gather intelligence and prepare for an invasion Harvey thought inevitable. The unauthorized operation tarnished Harvey's reputation. Although he was eventually assigned to Rome as station chief in 1963 following a punitive administrative post at CIA headquarters, he failed to acclimate to the milieu and was denied a high-profile assignment in the Laotian Civil War by Richard Helms. Notably, Harvey recommended Colonel Renzo Rocca, chief of the Italian military intelligence Division R, as liaison for building up the Italian component of Operation Gladio in 1964.Tunander, Ola, Democratic State vs. Deep State: Approaching the Dual State of the West. Peace Research Institute Oslo, 2008 However, his drinking and health deteriorated, and he was ultimately relieved. Although Harvey briefly headed a CIA headquarters unit on possible countermeasures to electronic surveillance, he took an extended leave of absence (largely precipitated by his alcohol use disorder and the concurrent fallout from his relationship with Roselli, who had been convicted in an elaborate card-cheating case) throughout much of 1967. He formally retired from the CIA in January 1968. Following a brief law practice in Washington, D.C., Harvey and his family relocated to Indianapolis amid fears of ongoing surveillance in 1969. During this period, he curtailed his alcohol use and edited legal decisions for the Bobbs-Merrill Company. In 1975, he testified before the Church Committee on some of the CIA's past operations. Harvey died in Indianapolis on June 9, 1976 from a heart attack, at 60 years of age. Assassination of John F. Kennedy After the death of former CIA officer and Watergate figure E. Howard Hunt in 2007, Saint John Hunt and David Hunt revealed that their father had recorded several claims about himself and others being involved in a conspiracy to assassinate John F. Kennedy. In the April 5, 2007 issue of Rolling Stone, Saint John Hunt detailed a number of individuals implicated by his father, including Harvey, Lyndon B.

In addition to her tugboat duties, she was used by the Navy as a gunboat to patrol and blockade navigable waterways of the Confederacy to prevent the South from trading with other countries.  Built in New York City in 1855  Shawsheen‚Äîa side wheel tug built at New York City in 1855‚Äîwas purchased by the Union Navy at New York City as Young America on 21 September 1861. No record of her commissioning has been found, but Acting Lieutenant Edmund R. Colhoun was apparently the tug's first commanding officer.  Civil War service  = Assigned to the South Atlantic Blockade = Originally assigned to the South Atlantic Blockading Squadron, Shawsheen arrived in Hampton Roads early in November badly damaged and unable to proceed further south under her own power. Nevertheless, the need for blockading vessels was so great off the coast of South Carolina that, on the 12th, she and ‚Äîtowed by ‚Äîgot underway to join Flag Officer DuPont. However, their conditions worsened soon after their departure, forcing them both to return to Newport News, Virginia. = Shawsheen duels with CSS Patrick Henry = Although it seemed desirable to send Shawsheen north for repairs, the tactical situation in the vicinity of Hampton Roads required her to remain there. On the 14th, she ascended the York River to investigate a report that Southern forces were gathering in preparation for an attack. After finding no evidence to support the report, she returned to Newport News and remained there to help guard and . On 23 November shortly after midnight, Shawsheen and bombarded a Confederate camp above Newport News on the Yorktown Road. On the morning of 2 December, Confederate steamer, Patrick Henry, attacked the Union warships. Shawsheen engaged the Southern ship for over an hour and claimed to have scored two hits. In any case, the Patrick Henry was damaged and retired toward Norfolk, Virginia. = Bombarding and capturing Roanoke Island = On 2 January 1862, Shawsheen was ordered to Hatteras Inlet, North Carolina, where a task force was assembling to attempt to capture Roanoke Island, the key to Albemarle Sound. On 5 February, the ships sortied from Hatteras Inlet and began a bombardment of Roanoke Island on the morning of the 7th. By the end of the next day, the conquest of the island was complete providing the Union Navy with a base which proved invaluable throughout the remainder of the war. = North Carolina operations = On the 10th, Shawsheen was part of the Union naval force which engaged Southern batteries and a Confederate naval force near Elizabeth City, North Carolina. The Union ships destroyed the fort and batteries, captured CSS Ellis, sank CSS Seabird, and forced the burning of three other Southern ships to keep them from falling into Union hands. Shawsheen remained in the North Carolina sounds for over a year and one-half, helping to keep those waters under Union control. On 18 May 1862, she and captured the schooner G. H. Smoot, in Potecase Creek, North Carolina. On 9 July, she joined and in an expedition up the Roanoke River to Hamilton, North Carolina. Despite small arms fire from the banks, they proceeded upstream to land their troops at Hamilton where steamer, Wilson, was captured. On 12 December, Shawsheen and three other Union ships began an expedition up the Nuese River to support a Union Army thrust up that stream to destroy railroad bridges and track near Goldsboro, North Carolina, but low water prevented their getting more than 15 miles up stream and they returned four days later. = Beating off a surprise attack on Fort Anderson = On the night of 13 and 14 March 1863, Shawsheen, with Hunchback, , and Ceres, beat off a surprise attack on Fort Anderson on the Nuese River. On 26 May, Shawsheen joined Ceres and in an expedition up the Nuese during which they captured a number of small schooners and boats. They then covered the landing of Union troops and remained on station until the Army was solidly entrenched. On 22 June, during a reconnaissance in Bay River, Shawsheen captured schooner, Henry Clay, up Spring Creek. She then sent an armed boat up Dimbargon Creek to capture a small unnamed schooner carrying turpentine. Perhaps her most productive day came on 20 July when she took five schooners‚ÄîSally, Helen Jane, Elizabeth, Dolphin and James Brice‚Äînear Cedar Island, in the Nuese River. Nine days later, she captured the schooner, Telegraph, in Rose Bay, North Carolina. = Overhauled at Hampton Roads = But wear and tear was beginning to catch up with the tug. On 3 September, she was ordered to Hampton Roads; and she subsequently was given a thorough overhaul at the Norfolk Navy Yard and at Baltimore, Maryland. When she was ready for service again, the tug was based at Newport News from which she operated on the James and York rivers and their tributaries supporting ground operations. On 1 May 1864, she and operated in the Pamunkey River protecting Union troops who had earlier in the day occupied West Point, Virginia. She later returned to Hampton Roads. On the 6th, with Rear Admiral S. P. Lee embarked, she ascended the James River. Near James Neck, he shifted his flag to . The next day, 7 May 1864, the tug was ordered to drag the river above Chaffin's Bluff. =Capture and burning = Shortly before noon, while the ship was anchored close to the shore near Turkey Bend, Confederate infantry and artillery surprised and thoroughly disabled the ship. Her commanding officer reluctantly hauled down her colors. Her crew was taken ashore in boats, and Shawsheen was set afire and exploded.

It is so large that it usually isn't held in the lap, but supported on a spike that rests on the floor. The neck-scale length on a full-size mando-bass is similar to that of a standard orchestral double bass viol: about 43\\" (110 cm).Paul Sparks, The Classical Mandolin, Oxford University Press, pages 205‚Äì206. The instrument is otherwise similar to the smaller, higher-pitched members of the mandolin family, having a fretted neck, a headstock with geared tuning machines, and a large resonating body often‚Äîbut not always‚Äîshaped like that of other mandolins. Variants A Gibson Mandobass (center rear), displayed for size comparison. There are three main variants of the mandobass: * The large four- string mandobass has a much longer neck and is tuned EADG, like a double bass. It was popular in early 20th century American and European mandolin ensembles. Early examples had very large bodies and were often played in an upright position like a double bass is. Later examples often have smaller bodies and are intended to be played guitar style.Johnson, Joseph R.; Mandolin Clubs and Orchestras in the United States (1880-1920): Their Origin, History and Instruments; Vermillion: University of South Dakota: 1987), pp. 34, 49-51, 182. * The small four-string mandobass is identical, but built on a smaller scale and usually tuned either GDAE, two octaves below the mandolin, or CGDA, two octaves below the mandola. Though not as resonant as the larger instrument, players often preferred it as easier to handle and more portable.Ibid. Ruppa, Paul; American Mando-Bass History 101 * The eight-string mandobass, or \\"tremolo-bass\\", relatively rare, is built exactly like a mandolin but is much larger and tuned either GDAE, two octaves lower than the mandolin, or CGDA, two octaves below the mandola.Marcuse, Sibyl; Musical Instruments: A Comprehensive Dictionary; W. W. Norton & Company (1975). (see entries for mandolin, and for individual mandolin family members.)Johnson, J. R.; The Mandolin Orchestra in America, Part 3: Other Instruments, American Lutherie, No. 21 (Spring) 1990, pp.45-46. History When mandolin orchestras were being organized in numbers, the members became aware of a problem of adding bass to their orchestras. In trying to play the bass range, many mandolin players were reluctant to switch to the contrabass, because they saw its bowed action as an intrusion into their plucked-string world. They faced the problem, however, that mandolin basses were too quiet; it was hard to get forte (loud sound) from them. Furthermore, they didn't get the deep bass notes of the contrabass. For those reasons, most mandolin orchestras preferred to use the ordinary contra-bass, rather than a specialized mandolin family instrument. The bow not only helps with volume for forte sections of music, but the contrabass has deeper notes available.Op Cit. Sparks, p.199 Up until 1911, the mandolin family of instruments as known in the United States had no true bass member. Mandolins were relatively new to the United States, beginning to be known in the mid-1880s and reaching the peak of popularity before 1910. The American public was mostly unaware of the few mando-basses being made in Europe.Op Cit. Sparks, Chapters 2, 3. Published minutes from the 1911 meeting of the American Guild of Banjoists, Mandolinists and Guitarists included an entry about bass mandolins developed in Britain, and indicate that issues related to the mando-bass were among the first discussed at the meeting. It was at this meeting that George D. Laurian of the Gibson Mandolin- Guitar Company announced that his department had developed a bass member for the mandolin family.Op Cit. Ruppa. Gibson Melody Maids of Kalamazoo, Michigan from a 1922 trade magazine. One of the musicians is playing a mandobass, center left. At the Guild's next meeting in 1912, four companies displayed their versions of a mando-bass: Gibson, Leland, Vega, and Wm. C. Stahl. All four companies advertised extensively, but in contrast to its competitors, only Gibson promoted their mando-bass in photographs of musicians playing it in large groups, emphasizing the social aspects of playing their instrument. Ultimately, the two most successful instruments were those produced by Gibson and Vega.Op Cit. Rupa.The National Music Museum, NMM 2883. Mando-bass by Gibson Mandolin-Guitar Company, Kalamazoo, 1916. Style J. Serial number 25936. Arne B. Larson Collection, 1979. Gibson designed their mandobasses to play either upright or on their side (like a regular mandolin) through changing of the position of the pins the instrument rests on. Gibson made Mandobasses from 1912 to approximately 1930. Most mandobasses that survive from this era are Gibsons.The National Music Museum, NMM 5910. Mando-bass by Gibson Mandolin- Guitar Company, Kalamazoo, ca. 1923-1924. Style J. Serial number 76525 or 74563 (number faded). Arne B. Larson Estate, 1988. Musical instrument makers produced mandobasses in a variety of sizes and shapes. Gibson models were mostly a scaled-up version of the traditional \\"A\\" style mandolin (teardrop shaped), with the exception of their limited-edition \\"O. Pagani\\" model, which more closely resembled an orchestral double bass in shape. The Pagani model was also one of the few eight-string mando-basses made in the US, with four double-strung courses like the European tremolo bass. Vega produced both a flat-back and a humped-back mando-bass (known as a \\"cylinder back\\"), both with a generally mandolin-shape in outline, but with markedly pointed upper bouts. Other builders (H.F. Meyer; Prairie State; Wm. C. Stahl) produced instruments that were more guitar, lute, or cittern-shaped. By the late 1920s, the popularity of mandolin orchestras was waning, and demand for the mando-bass began to evaporate. Gibson ceased production in 1930, and by the mid-1930s most other companies had followed suit. No commercial mando-basses are known to have been manufactured after 1940, and none are currently (2015) in production. An occasional instrument has been privately commissioned, however, such as that crafted in 1992 by English luthier Robin Greenwood, for musician Hilary James. Tuning and playing As noted earlier, several tunings were employed for the mando-bass, depending on the style and size of the individual instrument, player's preference, and the requirements of the music to be performed. Tuning on the full-sized 4-string instrument was commonly in fourths, and identical to the orchestral double bass: E1 A1 D2 G2. This tuning was favored in both America and also quite common in Europe. Smaller, shorter- scaled instruments were more usually tuned in fifths, two octaves below the mandolin: G1, D2 A2 E3. In Europe, especially, this tuning was sometimes preferred even for the larger instrument. The eight-string instrument appears to always have been tuned in fifths, either two octaves below the mandolin: G1 D2 A2 E3, or two octaves below the mandola: C1, G1, D2 A2. There is scant information as to how common this lower tuning (lower-ranging than the orchestral double bass) was, or in what circumstances people used it. In playing the instrument, the left-hand stops the strings against the top surface of the neck (fingerboard) for different pitches, in the same method as other stringed instruments. Given the scale of the neck and the presence of frets, the left-hand \\"feel\\" of the instrument is similar to a modern electric bass guitar. As with tunings, right-hand playing methods varied. Photographs of the instrument in use show some players using a traditional mandolin technique with a plectrum (pick), while others play the instrument with bare fingers like pizzicato on the double bass. Tremolo is possible with either playing method, but somewhat more difficult that on higher pitched instruments due to the thickness of the bass strings.

Early life Portrait of O'Connor, by Fran√ßois G√©rard. Arthur O'Connor. O'Connor was born near Bandon, County Cork on 4 July 1763 into a wealthy Irish Protestant family. Through his brother Roger O'Connor, the author of the Chronicles of Eri who shared his politics, he was an uncle to Roderic O'Connor, Francisco Burdett O'Connor, and Feargus O'Connor among others. His other two brothers, Daniel and Robert, were pro-British loyalists. As a young man, he embraced the Republican movement early on as he was encouraged by the American Revolution overseas. After his oldest brother Daniel got into debt, his brother Roger bought out his inheritance. The family's political and financial conflicts were only deepened when their sister Anne committed suicide, after having been forbidden by the family from marrying a Catholic man she was in love with. Career From 1790 to 1795 he was a Member of Parliament in the Irish House of Commons for Philipstown. The Irish House of Commons was part of the colonial parliament that sat in College Green. O'Connor was also a member of the Kildare Street Club in Dublin.Thomas Hay Sweet Escott, Club Makers and Club Members (1913), pp. 329‚Äì333 =United Irishmen= In 1796, he became a member of the Society of United Irishmen. He and Lord Edward Fitzgerald petitioned France for aid in support of an Irish revolution. While traveling to France he was arrested alongside Father James Coigly, a Catholic priest, and three other United Irishmen. Coigly, who found to be carrying an incriminating letter, was hanged, whereas O'Connor was acquitted. He was re-arrested immediately and imprisoned at Fort George in Scotland along with his brother Roger. On his way to confinement, he distributed a poem, which, seeming to recant his republican beliefs, with verses re-ordered, was instead a ringing re-affirmation of them: > The pomp of courts, and pride of kings, > I prize above all earthly things; > I love my country, but my king, > Above all men his praise I'll sing. > The royal banners are display'd, > And may success the standard aid: > I fain would banish far from hence > The Rights of Man and Common Sense. > Destruction to that odious name, > The plague of princes, Thomas Paine, > Defeat and ruin seize the cause > Of France, her liberty, and laws.

He travelled to Paris, where he was regarded as the accredited representative of the United Irishmen by Napoleon who, in February 1804, appointed him General of Division in the French army. General Berthier, Minister of War, directed that O'Connor was to join the expeditionary army intended for the invasion of Ireland at Brest. When the plan fell through, O'Connor retired from the army. He offered his services to Napoleon during the Hundred Days. After Napoleon's defeat he was allowed to retire, becoming a naturalised French citizen in 1818. He supported the 1830 revolution which created the July Monarchy, publishing a defence of events in the form of an open letter to General Lafayette. After the revolution he became mayor of Le Bignon-Mirabeau. The rest of his life was spent composing literary works on political and social topics.

Personal life In 1807, although more than twice her age, O'Connor married Alexandrine Louise Sophie de Caritat de Condorcet (b 1790/1-1859), known as Eliza, the daughter of the scholar the Marquis de Condorcet and Sophie de Condorcet.Clifford D.

The company primarily produces circuit protection products but also manufactures a variety of electronic switches and automotive sensors. Littelfuse was founded in 1927. In addition to its Chicago, Illinois, world headquarters, Littelfuse has more than 40 sales, distribution, manufacturing and engineering facilities in the Americas, Europe and Asia. Littelfuse is the developer of AutoFuse, the first blade-type automotive fuse. History =Early history= Edward V. Sundt founded Littelfuse in 1927 in Chicago Illinois as Littelfuse Laboratories. Prior to founding Littelfuse, Sundt had worked for General Electric and Stewart-Warner, where he found diagnostic equipment frequently experienced electrical failure. Sundt developed Littelfuse's first product, a small protective fuse, to regulate current in diagnostic equipment and prevent electrical failure. Littelfuse was incorporated and renamed Littelfuse, Inc. in 1938. Littelfuse became a public company in 1962. The company retained founder Edward V. Sundt as the chairman of its board. In 1963, Littelfuse moved its headquarters from Chicago to Des Plaines, Illinois. Sundt retired in 1965 and was succeeded by Thomas Blake. Tracor purchased the company in 1968. Blake was made president of Littelfuse, which operated as a wholly owned subsidiary of Tracor. =1970‚Äì1991= The company expanded its manufacturing base in the 1970s with new factories opening in Watseka, Illinois and Piedras Negras, Mexico. In 1974, the company also introduced Littelites, electronic indicator lights used in industrial and office machinery, household appliances and computers. In 1976, Littelfuse developed Autofuse, which was the first blade-type fuse used in automobiles. The Autofuse brand was counterfeited heavily and in 1983 the company obtained an exclusionary order from the United States International Trade Commission, which barred the importation of counterfeit blade-type fuses. In 1987, Westmark Systems purchased Tracor and its Littelfuse subsidiary in leveraged buyout. Tracor filed for bankruptcy in 1991 and spun off Littelfuse. =Modern history= Littelfuse reincorporated in November 1991 with Howard Witt as its president and CEO. Witt had worked for Littelfuse since 1979 and had been president and CEO of Littelfuse since February 1990, when the company was still owned by Tracor. In 1991, Littelfuse offered its second IPO in company history. The company's profits rose throughout the 1990s and the company expanded its operations in Europe and Asia. Littelfuse also expanded into South America with a distribution and engineering center in S√£o Paulo, Brazil. Gordon Hunter replaced Witt as president and CEO of Littelfuse at the end of 2004. In 2008, Littelfuse restructured its manufacturing operations, closing 16 small manufacturing plants and opening 6 new, larger plants. The company moved its headquarters from Des Plaines, Illinois, to Chicago, Illinois, the same year. The company was recognized as Product of the Year by Specifying Engineer in 2010, 2011, 2012 and 2013. Arrow Electronics recognized Littelfuse with an award for Supplier Excellence in 2011. The company received TTI Supplier's Excellence Award in 2010, 2011, 2012 and 2013. Littelfuse received the Chicago Innovation Award in 2012.

The name Colville comes from association with Fort Colville, named after Andrew Colvile of the Hudson's Bay Company. Earlier, outsiders often called them Scheulpi, Chualpay, or Swhy-ayl-puh; the French traders called them Les Chaudi√®res (\\"the Kettles\\") in reference to Kettle Falls. The neighboring Coeur d'Alene called them SqhwiyiÃ±'…´pmsh and the Spokane knew them as Sx ∑yelpetk ∑. History The Colville tribe was originally located in eastern Washington on the Colville River and the area of the Columbia River between Kettle Falls and the town of Hunters. The tribe's history is tied with Kettle Falls, an important salmon fishing resource, and an important post of the Hudson's Bay Company, which brought the advantages and disadvantages of contact with people of European heritage. In 1846, the Jesuit St. Paul's Mission was established. Through its influence nearly all the upper Columbia tribes were Christianized. In 1872, the Colville tribe was relocated to an Indian reservation in eastern Washington the named after them. It is inhabited and managed by the Confederated Tribes of the Colville Reservation, which is a federally recognized tribe comprising twelve bands. The twelve bands are the Methow, Okanogan, Arrow Lakes, Sanpoil, Colville, Nespelem, Chelan, Entiat, Moses-Columbia, Wenatchi, Nez Perce, and Palus. Eight of these related bands are the names of rivers that flow off of the eastern slopes of the North Cascades or the Okanagon Highlands of eastern Washington. Several of these rivers have small towns or communities where the rivers flow into the Columbia River. Beginning in the Southwest the rivers in order as you go north and then east are the: Wenatchee (Town of Wenatchee), Entiat (Town of Entiat), Chelan (Town of Chelan), Methow (Town of Methow, upstream of the confluence with the Columbia), Okanogan (Town of Okanogan, upstream of the Confluence), Nespelem (Tribal community of Nespelem, upstream of the confluence), Sanpoil (Tribal community of Sanpoil, on the Sanpoil arm of Lake Roosevelt), and Colville (Town of Colville, upstream of the confluence). The Arrow Lakes are upstream on the Columbia River a little ways above the border in British Columbia. The Moses Coulee, Moses-Columbia, is an Ice Age Canyon (coulee) just south of the Columbia River west of Coulee City on U.S. Highway 2. Not to be confused, Coulee City is located in the Grand Coulee, a similar and more famous Ice Age Canyon that lies east of the Moses Coulee. The Nez Perce are the descendants of Chief Joseph band which came from Northeast Oregon. As part of the conditions of surrender Chief Joseph and his band were not allowed to return to their home in Oregon and were eventually re-located to the Colville reservation after the so called \\"Flight of the Nez Perce\\" in 1877. The Nez Perce (not including the small group re-located to Colville) are located on the Nez Perce Indian Reservation in West central Idaho along the Clearwater River. Mooney (1928) estimated the number of the Colville at 1,000 as of 1780, but Lewis and Clark placed it at 2,500, a figure also fixed upon by Teit (1930). In 1870, there were 616; in 1900, 298; in 1904, 321; in 1907, 334; and in 1937, 322. Language The Colville language or NÃìxÃå ∑ îi≈Çpc…ôn is a one of six dialects of Colville-Okanagan historically spoken by the \\"Syilx peoples\\" including Northern Okanagan and Southern/Lower Okanagan (Sinkaietk), Methow, Sanpoil (Nesilextcl'n), Nespelem (sometimes considered a Sanpoil subtribe), Colville, and Sinixt (Senijextee/Arrow Lakes Band) peoples. Syilx is the historic autonym of the Okanagan peoples and today a political term for land and cultural claims for all Colville-Okanagan- speaking peoples. Together with Wenatchee-Columbian, Spokane-Kalispel- Bitterroot, and Coeur d'Alene, Colville-Okanagan belong to the four Southern Interior Salishan languages of the Plateau.

The battle took place in November 1941, during the East African Campaign. Gondar was the main town of Amhara in the mountains north of Lake Tana in Ethiopia, at an elevation of and had an Italian garrison of 40,000 men, commanded by Generale Guglielmo Nasi. Background After the defeat of the Italians at the Battle of Keren (1 April 1941), many of the remaining Italians withdrew to the strongholds of Amba Alagi, Jimma and Gondar. Amba Alagi fell in May and Jimma fell in July. Gondar is the capital of Amhara on the high ground north of Lake Tana at . In 1941 it was a road junction but only the Amhara road had an all- weather surface. At Wolchefit, guarded by a garrison of Italian troops, towards Amhara, the road chicaned up a escarpment, some parts having been cut into a vertical cliff. From Wolchefit to Gondar the road traced the edge of the escarpment and at Dabat, short of Gondar and at Amba Giorgis were small garrisons. Only a minor road from Um Hagar to the north had a junction with the main road. West from the town, a fair-weather road in poor repair, led to Gallabat and had a garrison at Chilga. There were rough tracks to the west of Lake Tana which met at Gorgora and a better road ran east to Debra Tabor, also garrisoned and Dessie. At Kulkaber, from Gondar, the road passed between Lake Tana and the hills; from Debra Tabor to Dessie, it was a soil road and impassable in rain. Prelude The possession of the Wolchefit and Kulkaber mountain passes was instrumental for attacking Gondar. Wolchefit was defended by a garrison of about 4,000 men under Colonel Mario Gonella. The stronghold had been besieged by irregular Ethiopian forces, led by British Major Ringrose, since May 1941; the besieging force was later augmented by the arrival of units from the British Indian Army and part of the 12th African Division. Several attacks and counterattacks were launched between May and August 1941. On 28 September 1941, after losing in combat 950 men and running out of food, Gonella surrendered with 1,629 Italians and 1,450 colonial soldiers. On 13 November, a mixed force from the British 12th (African) Division under Major-General Charles Fowkes‚Äîsupported by Ethiopian irregular troops‚Äîattacked the key defensive position of Kulkaber and were repelled. Kulkalber was besieged since early September and had already been subjected to several attacks and bombardments. A second attack on 21 November from several directions was resisted until the afternoon, when Italian posts began to surrender. In the final attack there were 206 British and Ethiopian casualties and 2,423 Italian and Ethiopian prisoners taken (Italian sources list Italian casualties as 1,003 killed, 804 wounded and 1,900 prisoners).http://www.ilcornodafrica.it/st-melecaculqualber.pdf By this point the Allies had total control of the skies: the Italians had one Fiat CR.42 left, piloted by Sergente Giuseppe Mottet. On 22 November, in the Regia Aeronautica's final sortie in East Africa, he made a strafing run on British artillery at Kulkaber that killed the Commander, Royal Artillery, Lieutenant- Colonel Ormsby. Afterwards, Mottet landed at Gondar, destroyed the plane and fought on with the army. Battle =Mountain passes= 28 September 1941; men of the King's African Rifles collect weapons surrendered by Italian forces at Uolchefit Pass There were two mountain passes that overlooked the town which were controlled by the Italian troops. They were invested by the two brigades of the 12th (African) Division. The two Italian groups in the passes were cut off and were forced to surrender when their supplies ran out. =Gondar town= Once the Allied troops had taken the passes, they gained control of the heights overlooking Gondar and reached the town on 23 November. The garrison of Gondar was seriously depleted, since many Askari, having gone unpaid by the Italians, had deserted. The final assault on Gondar, where Nasi had his headquarters, started at 5:30 a.m. on 27 November. The Azozo airfield was the initial objective; it was captured by midday of 27 November and shortly afterwards, Commonwealth troops reached Fasilides' Castle.The King's African Rifles - Volume 2 At 4:30 p.m., while the Kenya Armoured Car Regiment penetrated the outskirts of the town, Nasi sent his last message to Italy, explaining that the reserve brigade had been deployed on the southern front but had been unable to stop the attack, that enemy troops had passed the barbed wire and enemy armoured vehicles had entered the town. Nasi surrendered soon after. Some Italian outposts fought on until 30 November, marking the end of the battle.

It has a surface area of approximately 11.5 hectares (28 acres), and is positioned opposite Meudon, a short distance downstream from the √éle Saint-Germain. Administratively Meudon and the island are included as part of Boulogne- Billancourt, on the river's right bank, rather than of S√®vres on the left bank. Seguin Island in 2011 During most of the twentieth century, √éle Seguin was home to a Renault factory, covering virtually the whole island. The last car from the Renault production line was a 1992 Renault 5 Supercinq. The factory remained dormant until 2005 when all the buildings were demolished. The architect Jean Nouvel was appointed in 2009 as the lead planner to transform the island into a new cultural hub. The first permanent concert and performance spaces in the project, known as La Seine Musicale, were opened in April 2017. the former Renault factory History =Before Renault= Before the seventeenth century the island was owned by the Abbey of St. Victor and the land was cultivated by tenant farmers. The island's importance received a sudden boost at the end of the seventeenth century with the construction of a Palace at nearby Versailles, because it was positioned along the route that connected the new palace with Paris. The road was much frequented by itinerant aristocrats. In 1747 the palace builder's grandson, Louis XV, acquired the island - then known as the \\"√éle de S√®ve\\", on behalf of his daughters.chronologie de l'√Æle Seguin, sur lemonde.fr The island found itself renamed as the \\"√éle Madame\\", and during the pre-revolutionary decades it was home to a commercial laundry, the \\"Buanderie de S√®vres\\". Under the revolutionary government the laundry was nationalised and the island fell under direct state control.√éle Seguin, histoire (inachev√©e) d'une longue gestation, de Vincent Renard, CNRS-Polytechnique, d√©cembre 2001. In 1793, briefly, it was owned by a banker called Jean-Baptiste Vandenyver, but he was guillotined a few months later. Control of the island was then disputed, in the broader context of the redrawing of the Paris city limits, between the three municipalities/districts of S√®vres, Issy and Auteuil. In 1794 the island was acquired by the entrepreneurial chemist, Armand Seguin, from whom it takes its name. Seguin became extremely rich, in part by using his island to construct a factory applying a new approach to tanning leather, on an industrial scale. The island also continued to be home to laundry businesses. During the closing decades of the nineteenth century, while retaining its industrial businesses, the island also became a leisure destination, used for recreational boating, clay pigeon shooting and angling. =The Renault factory= Louis Renault, a founder and the energetic hands-on owner of the \\"Soci√©t√© des Automobiles Renault\\", was one of several major automakers to have expanded production (of military supplies) and to have prospered during the war. At this point he already controlled factories on both banks of the river, and in 1919 he acquired the √éle Seguin in the middle of it. Renault built his first factory on the island between 1929 and 1934. For the rest of the twentieth century the island's history would be the history of the Renault plant. The factory was self-sufficient, with its own electric power generation facilities and several testing sites including an underground test track. Infrastructure also included dock facilities necessary for taking delivery of bulk supplies and for transporting finished automobiles by river. Billancourt became France's largest factory, employing more than 30,000 people. During the Second World War the factory, which was at this time being used to produce trucks for the Germans, was an easy target for bomber pilots using the River Seine to navigate, and suffered from several destructive allied bombings attacks. Renault himself was accused of collaboration directly after the war, and in the frenzied atmosphere of retribution that characterized the post- liberation period he died in prison under suspicious circumstances, and without benefiting from the trial which had been intended for him. His company was placed under the direction of a well-connected resistance hero, and then, on 15 January 1945 nationalised and renamed \\"R√©gie nationale des usines Renault (RNUR)\\" France had missed out on the economic recovery that had boosted prosperity in Britain and Germany during the 1930s, but she participated fully in the sustained post-war boom that got going in the 1950s. The Renault plant on the √éle Seguin became, at this time, a beacon for the growth and modernisation of French industry, reflecting the success of models such as the Renault 4CV launched in 1947, which would be the first French car to break through the \\"one million\\" threshold. The factory also continued to justify its reputation, established during the turbulence of the mid-1930s, as a bastion of trades union militancy, notably being closed down by a 33-day strike during the \\"√âv√©nements\\"(\\"Events\\") of May 1968. Growth in the 1950s and 1960s enabled Renault to open several newer car plants on greenfield sites in France, Spain and, later, further afield. Rising wages, union militancy (especially in the big car plants of the Paris region) and high employment taxes encouraged the French auto-industry to become a pioneer of automated vehicle assembly and the Billancourt factory, designed for an era of labor- intensive production processes, was hard to adapt to the new techniques. Renault announced in 1989 that the factory would close and Billancourt's last car, a Renault Supercinq, emerged on 31 March 1992. A major clean-up of the buildings began almost at once, but the challenge was formidable, especially with regard to the necessary asbestos removal and soil decontamination. Destruction of the factory buildings began only on 29 March 2004, and was completed on 8 March 2005.  Bridges  At the time of the factory, the island was accessible from two metal bridges (a suspension bridge designed by Dayd√© in 1928 linked the island to the right bank of the river Seine and another bridge designed by Seibert in 1931 with the left bank). The new Renault bridge designed by Italian architect Marc Barani was inaugurated in 2009.

The five-day event is held annually on Memorial Day Weekend in Corpus Christi, Texas, the Windsurfing Capital of the contiguous United States. Corpus Christi, Texas sits along Corpus Christi Bay in the Gulf of Mexico. The Velocity Games was originally created as a vehicle for the U.S. Open Windsurfing Regatta and the U.S. Open Kiteboarding Championships. Although the events are recognized worldwide and covered by the major windsports magazines, they typically attracted a viewing audience of less than 5,000 spectators. In the first year under the Velocity Games umbrella, the events attracted more than 50,000 spectators, according to the Corpus Christi Caller-Times. The Velocity Games event was almost cancelled before it began when one of its co-founders, Peter Nordby, was killed in a kiteboarding accident six months before the event was set to launch in May 2003. The organizers put the event planning on hold, but due to the urging of the windsurfing and kiteboarding communities, the planning resumed in time for its scheduled Memorial Day Weekend opening date. The Velocity Games differentiated itself from other popular action and extreme sports events, such as X-Games, with its watersports focus and its scenic waterfront venue. The featured events: the U.S. Open Windsurfing Regatta (in its 16th year in 2003) and the U.S. Open Kiteboarding Championships (in its 4th year in 2003) were joined with several new events, including the BMX Pro SkyJam and the Benjamin's Pro Sk8Jam.\\" Other events included an extreme fashion style show called Thrashin Fashion as well as several music stages featuring regional bands primarily from the South Texas area. Velocity Games also hosted various national acts, including A Perfect Circle. The event also featured the MTV Rock Wall Challenge, with MTV Road Rules star Mark Long as the celebrity challenger. Due to the success of the Velocity Games in its inaugural year, a serious traffic problem ensued at the event site and the City of Corpus Christi required that the event be moved in future years to a location with more parking accessibility. After the first year at the Cole Park/Oleander Point site, the event was moved less than a mile north to McGee Beach. After being managed by its founding company ¬°idea! Worldwide for the first three years, the Velocity Games event was handed off to its non-profit Board of Directors, which was originally appointed by its Chairman, Michael R.

Based on the 1929 semi-autobiographical novel A Farewell to Arms by Ernest Hemingway, with a screenplay by Oliver H. P. Garrett and Benjamin Glazer, the film is about a tragic romantic love affair between an American ambulance driver and an English nurse in Italy during World War I. The film received Academy Awards for Best Cinematography and Best Sound, and was nominated for Best Picture and Best Art Direction. In 1960, the film entered the public domain in the United States because the last claimant, United Artists, did not renew its copyright registration in the 28th year after publication. The original Broadway play starred Glenn Anders and Elissa Landi.A Farewell to Arms, as produced on Broadway at the National Theatre, September 22 1930 to October 1930, 24 performances; IBDb.comUnlike most pre-1950 Paramount sound features, A Farewell to Arms was not sold to what is now known as Universal Television. Warner Bros. acquired the rights at an unknown date with the intention to remake the film, but never did. The film would end up in the package of films sold to Associated Artists Productions in 1956, that company would be sold to United Artists two years later. Plot This is the plot of the original 1932 film, as it recently aired on Turner Classic Movies. The film suffered from editing and censorship even at its initial release. (See below.) On the Italian front during World War I, Lieutenant Frederic Henry (Gary Cooper), an American architect serving as an officer on an ambulance in the Italian Army, delivers some wounded soldiers to a hospital. While out carousing with his friend, Italian Captain Rinaldi (Adolphe Menjou), they are interrupted by a bombing raid. Frederic and English Red Cross nurse Catherine Barkley (Helen Hayes), who fled from the nurses‚Äô dormitory in her night clothes, take shelter in the same dark stairwell. The somewhat drunk Frederic makes a poor first impression. Rinaldi persuades Frederic to go on a double date with him and two nurses, one of whom turns out to be Catherine and her friend Helen Ferguson (Mary Philips), or \\"Fergie\\". During a concert for officers and nurses, Frederic and Catherine walk into the garden, and Catherine reveals that she had been engaged for eight years to a soldier who was killed in battle. Away by themselves, he tries to kiss her and she slaps him, but after they talk more, she asks him to kiss her again. In the darkness, he romantically seduces her, over her resistance, and is taken aback and touched to discover she was a virgin. Frederic tell her he loves her. In the morning, three ambulances, including Frederic's, are leaving for what will be known as the Second Battle of the Piave River. Frederic finds Catherine and tells her that he will be away and that he wants her to know that what happened between them was important to him, and that he will survive the battle unscathed. Catherine gives him the St. Anthony medal she wears around her neck. Rinaldi observes all of this, and then enters a major's office where it is revealed that Rinaldi had orchestrated the separation to prevent Frederic from being with Catherine. The head nurse then suggests sending Catherine back to base, but instead the Major (Gilbert Emery) transfers Catherine to Milan. At the front, Frederic is badly wounded in the legs and head when his bunker is blown up by an artillery shell. Frederic is sent to the hospital in Milan where he receives a chilly reception from Fergie while Catherine rushes to his bed to embrace him. Later that night, an Italian Army chaplain (Jack La Rue) known as \\"Padre\\" visits Frederic and sees that Catherine and him are lovers. He asks if they would marry if they could, and they answer \\"yes\\". He then performs an unofficial wedding service for the couple. Months later, Catherine and Frederic ask Fergie to their wedding, who rejects the offer saying they won't marry due to the war. As she leaves, she warns Frederic that if he gets Catherine pregnant, she will kill him. Back at the hospital, Frederic is told his convalescent leave is canceled. While waiting for his train, Catherine confides to Frederic that she is scared of each of them dying. He promises he will always come back, and they kiss before he leaves. Catherine then meets with Fergie and reveals to her that she is pregnant and is going to Switzerland to have the child. While apart, Catherine writes letters to Frederic, never revealing her pregnancy. In Turin, Rinaldi tries to entice Frederic to have some fun, but Frederic is intent on writing to Catherine, who unbeknownst to him is having all his letters from Catherine censored by Rinaldi. Meanwhile, the hospital at Milan returns all of Frederic's letters to him, marked \\"person unknown.\\" He tells the Padre that he is deserting and going to Milan to find Catherine. Frederic makes it to Milan but finds only Fergie is there, who refuses to tell him anything except that Catherine was pregnant and is gone. Rinaldi meets Frederic at a hotel where Frederic reveals that Catherine is going to have a baby. Rinaldi, realizing his mistakes, tells Frederic that she is in Brissago, Switzerland and helps Frederic to get there, apologizing for trying to keep the lovers apart. Meanwhile, Catherine discovers that all of letters to Frederic have been returned, marked \\"Return to Sender\\". She goes into labor and is taken to the hospital where she endures a prolonged and unproductive labor. As Frederic arrives, Catherine is wheeled into the operating room for a Caesarean section. After the operation, the surgeon tells Frederic that the baby, a boy, died in the womb long before Catherine came to the hospital. When Catherine regains consciousness, she and Frederic exchange heartbreaking endearments and plan the future, until Catherine panics and begs Frederic to hold her tight because she is going to die and is afraid. He soothes her and tells her they can never really be parted. She tells him she is not afraid, and dies in Frederic's arms as the sun rises. Frederic picks up her body and turns slowly toward the window, sobbing \\"Peace, Peace.\\" =Ending= This is the original ending of the film when released to international audiences in 1932. Some prints for American audiences had a happy ending, where Catherine did not die, and some were ambiguous; some theaters were offered a choice. The censors were concerned about more than just the heroine's death. Versions proliferated when a much more powerful Motion Picture Production Code got hold of the picture before various re-releases to film and television, not to mention the effects of a change of ownership to Warner Bros. and lapse into the public domain.

Critical reception Gary Cooper and Helen Hayes In his 1932 review in The New York Times, Mordaunt Hall wrote: > There is too much sentiment and not enough strength in the pictorial > conception of Ernest Hemingway's novel ... the film account skips too > quickly from one episode to another and the hardships and other experiences > of Lieutenant Henry are passed over too abruptly, being suggested rather > than told ... Gary Cooper gives an earnest and splendid portrayal [and] > Helen Hayes is admirable as Catherine ... another clever characterization is > contributed by Adolphe Menjou ... it is unfortunate that these three > players, serving the picture so well, do not have the opportunity to figure > in more really dramatic interludes. In 2006, Dan Callahan of Slant Magazine noted, \\"Hemingway ... was grandly contemptuous of Frank Borzage's version of A Farewell to Arms ... but time has been kind to the film. It launders out the writer's ... pessimism and replaces it with a testament to the eternal love between a couple.\\" In a 2014 posting, Time Out London calls it \\"not only the best film version of a Hemingway novel, but also one of the most thrilling visions of the power of sexual love that even Borzage ever made ... no other director created images like these, using light and movement like brushstrokes, integrating naturalism and a daring expressionism in the same shot. This is romantic melodrama raised to its highest degree.\\" Awards and honors The film won two Academy Awards and was nominated for another two: * Academy Award for Best Picture (nominee) * Academy Award for Best Art Direction (nominee) * Academy Award for Best Cinematography (winner) * Academy Award for Sound ‚Äì Franklin Hansen (winner) Also, the film is recognized by American Film Institute in these lists: * 2002: AFI's 100 Years...100 Passions ‚Äì Nominated See also * List of films in the public domain in the United States * The House That Shadows Built (1931 promotional film by Paramount with excerpt of film showing Eleanor Boardman, later replaced by Hayes) References Further reading * Tibbetts, John C., and James M.

Early life Guard was born in London in 1791 or 1792. On 17 March 1813 at age 21, the stonecutter was convicted of stealing a quilt\\"Jack Guard and his Family\\" , Te Papa and sentenced to transportation and five years hard labour. At the end of his sentence, he worked as a sealer, and after five or six years had his own boat and crew. New Zealand Guard can lay credit to a number of European firsts in New Zealand's South Island. His whaling station, established at Te AwaitiWises New Zealand Guide, 7th Edition, 1979. p. 427 on the Arapaoa IslandWises New Zealand Guide, 7th Edition, 1979. p. 10. shore of Tory Channel in 1827, was the first permanent settlement in the South Island. (previous whaling stations having been seasonal) Guard's wife Elizabeth or Betty (n√©e Parker, 1814‚Äì1870) whom he married in Sydney in 1830, was the first European woman to settle in the South Island. Guard's son, John junior (born 1 October 1831) was the first European child born in the South Island and his daughter Louisa (born late 1833) the first female child. A year after starting the Te Awaiti station, in 1828, he started a branch whaling station at Port Underwood using the ship Waterloo. He used the ship to transport flax, whale oil and seal skins to Sydney three times per year, returning with supplies and trade goods. Later he had to abandon the Te Awaiti station. In 1834 he was wrecked off the Taranaki coast in the Harriet with his wife and family and crew. The survivors were attacked by two different groups of local Maori. The wreck was plundered and 14 crew killed and two eaten. Betty Guard was tomahawked in the head, only her comb saving her life. Mrs Guard and her daughter were taken by the chief but the young boy of two 1/2, was taken away from his mother and not seen for two months. Richard Bourke, the governor of New South Wales, dispatched HMS Alligator to Taranaki with a group of 60 British soldiers of the 50th Regiment. They landed a small party on the coast and attempted negotiations with the Maori captors to recover the eight remaining crew, Guard's wife and two children, John and Louisa, but were chased away. The Alligator was forced out to sea by bad weather. Together with the ship Isabella, it returned to the Taranaki coast and landed a detachment of sailors and marines. An arrangement was made to ransom the prisoners. The captain suspected the prisoner were being held at Te Namu Pa and landed a party there. They made contact with Maori. Guard grabbed the chief and took him back to the Alligator where he was beaten up. His wounds were then treated by the surgeon. The next day large numbers of Maori gathered on the beach but negotiations stalled until the Maori chief, Oaoiti, was brought ashore. He made a speech to the Maori captors and immediately Mrs Guard and her baby daughter were taken to the Alligator by waka but the boy was still held prisoner. While negotiations continued for his release a shot from the Pa was fired, narrowly missing a sailor. The captain ordered a bombardment of the pa that lasted 3 hours during which the Maori hostage takers raised and then lowered a white flag several times. Near the end of the bombardment a Maori held up the captive boy to indicate he had not been killed. The Alligator's surgeon landed with 100 men. The boy was handed over and the soldiers then opened fire on the Maori gathered on the beach. The Maori fled and the pa was burnt down. The surgeon was horrified at the troop's action. This was the first clash between MƒÅori and British troops. The rescue expedition sent by Governor Bourke from Sydney was subsequently criticised by a British House of Commons report in 1835. Bourke used the kidnappings, murders and cannibalism to argue for a British warship to be permanently stationed in New Zealand.The Voyagers. p 42-50. Paul Moon. Penguin 2014.Taranaki Story :The Harriet Incident. Puke ArikiThe Harriet Affair- a Frontier of Chaos?- NZ History Net. Guard settled permanently at Port Underwood in 1836, and was still whaling off the Kaikoura coast in the 1840s. About this time onshore whaling ceased to be economically viable in New Zealand. His later life is unknown, but he probably farmed at Kakapo Bay. Guard died in 1857. References Reports on the Parliamentary Select committee on Aboriginal Tribes 1935 Further reading * Grady, D.

He supplied large British trading companies with raw materials and also had business interests in the Gold Coast. At the time of his death he was the wealthiest man in West Africa. Early life =Parents= Dantata was born in Bebeji, Kano Emirate in 1877, one of several children of Abdullahi and his wife Amarya. Both his parents were wealthy Agalawa, a hereditary group of long-distance traders in the Hausa empire. Abdullahi died in Bebeji around 1885. Abdullahi's children were too young to manage his considerable wealth. They all received their portion according to Islamic law. Amarya, like her mother-in-law, was a trader of wealth in her own right. After her husband's death, she decided to leave Bebeji for Accra, where she had commercial interests. Accra is around 1600 km away from Bebeji, and in those days, the journey would take several weeks. She left the children in Bebeji, in the care of an old slave woman named Tata. The young Alhassan became known as Alhassan Dantata because of Tata's role as his \\"mother\\" (\\"Dan-tata\\" means \\"son of Tata\\" in the Hausa language). His name indicates she was a strong influence in his early life. =Schooling= Dantata was sent to a Qur'anic school (madrasah) in Bebeji. It is likely that it was run by a Tijaniyya. His share of his father's wealth seemed to have vanished and he had to support himself. The life of the almajiri (Qur'anic student) is difficult, as he has to find food and clothing for himself and also for his malam (teacher) and at the same time read. Some simply begged while others sought paid work. Dantata worked, as was tradition for a young Agalawa. He succeeded at the insistence of Tata in saving. His asusu, a \\"money box\\" (a pottery vessel) purchased by Tata, still exists in the walls of the house. =Kano Civil War and slavery= Dantata was still a teenager when the great upheavals occurred in the Kano Emirate from 1893 to 1895. There were two claimants to the Kano Emirate when Emir Muhammad Bello died in 1893. Tukur was his son. Tukur received his religious training from a Tijaniyya scholar and received the support of the Agalawa. Yusufu had been passed over when Bello became Emir. Yusufu received his religious training from Qaadiriyya schools. In the resulting civil war, Yusufu forces were victorious over Tukur, and claimed the title of emir. Because of the Agalawa support of Tukur, Dantata and the other Agalawa had their property confiscated and many were captured. Dantata and his brothers were held for ransom, under the threat of slavery. They paid it and Dantata returned to the trading business without his family lands around Kano. =Introduction to trading= Probably after being freed from slavery around 1894, Dantata joined a Gonja-bound caravan to see his mother. He purchased some items in Bebeji, he sold half of them on the way and the rest in Accra. He might have hoped his wealthy mother would allow him to live with her and find him work among the Gold Coast Agalawa community. However, this did not happen. After a rest of only one day, she took him to a mallam and asked Dantata to stay there until he was ready to return to Bebeji. Dantata worked harder in Accra than he did in Bebeji. After the usual reading of the Qur'an, he had to go and beg for food for his mallam and himself. He worked for money on Thursdays and Fridays. As was the tradition, the bulk of his earnings went to his mallam. At some point he returned to Bebeji to his religious studies and work. There, Tata continued to insist that he must save something every day. Career Dantata started to be a long-distance trader himself. He remained in Bebeji until matters had settled down. He used the new trade routes to Ibadan and Lagos to develop his network of trading associates. Instead of bringing kola nuts on pack animals, he used steamships to transport them between Accra, Kumasi, Sekondi and Lagos. He was the first to develop this route. This innovation and contact with Europeans helped establish his wealth and future. In 1906, he began broadening his interests by trading in beads, necklaces, European cloth, and trade goods. His mother, who had never remarried, died in Accra around 1908. After her death he focused his attention on new opportunities in Lagos and Kano. =Base of operations= Dantata maintained a house in Bebeji and had no property in the larger trading town of Kano. He did not own a house there, but was satisfied with the accommodation given to him by his patoma (landlord). When the British disposed the successor of Yusufu in 1903, they appointed Abbas as the Emir of Kano. As part of a recompilation, Abbas returned the confiscated lands around Kano to the Agalawa families. Dantata built his first house in the then empty Sarari area (an extension of Koki) in Kano. He married Umma Zaria, and as was the tradition she conducted business for him with women of Kano. By all accounts, Dantata was hard working, frugal and unpretentious in his personal habits. He was also a good financial manager. He had the good sense to employ Alhaji Babba Na Alhassan who served as his chief accountant and Alhaji Garba Maisikeli as his financial controller for 38 years. Dantata did not manage from behind a desk but involved himself with his workers. =European trading companies= In 1912, when the Europeans started to show an interest in the export of groundnut, they contacted the already established Kano merchants through Emir Abbas and their chief agent, Adamu Jakada. Some established merchants of Kano like Umaru Sharubutu, Maikano Agogo accepted their offer. Dantata was already familiar with the manner by which traders could make fortunes by buying cocoa for Europeans in the Gold Coast. He had several advantages over other Kano business men: language, wealth and age. He could speak some English and already had direct dealings with Europeans in Lagos and Accra. He had substantial amounts of capital. Unlike other established Kano merchants, he was in his mid-thirties, with a small family and retinue to support. Despite the famine in Kano in 1914, he quickly dominated the groundnut purchasing business via promotions, loans and contacts. In 1918, the UK-based Royal Niger Company (later became the United Africa Company) searched for an agent to purchase groundnuts for them, and Dantata responded to their offer. It is said that he used to purchase about half of all the nuts purchased by the United Africa Company in northern Nigeria. By 1922 Dantata had become the richest businessman in Kano, surpassing other merchant traders. In 1929, when the Bank of British West Africa opened a branch in Kano, Dantata placed 20 camel-loads of silver coins in it. (For religious reasons, his money collected no interest). Shortly before his death, he pointed to sixty \\"groundnut pyramids\\" in Kano and said, \\"These are all mine\\". Dantata applied for a licence to purchase and export groundnuts in 1940, on the same level as the United Africa Company. However, it was not granted because of worldwide military and economic conditions. In 1953‚Äì54 he became a licensed buying agent, which allowed him to sell directly to the Nigerian Groundnut Marketing board instead of another firm. He had many business connections both in Nigeria and in other West African countries, particularly the Gold Coast. He dealt not only in groundnuts and kola but also in other merchandise. He traded in cattle, cloth, beads, precious stones, grains, rope and other things. Pilgrimage to Mecca Dantata made a pilgrimage (hajj) to Mecca via boat in the 1920s. On this trip he also went to England and was presented to George V. Dantata financed the pilgrimages of other Muslims to Mecca, a tradition that continues among his descendants. His son, Alhaji Aminu Dantata and his grandchildren like Hajiya Mariya Sunusi Dantata as well as his great-grandchildren, Aliko Dangote still finance pilgrimages of other Muslims to Mecca every year. Death In 1955, Dantata fell ill. Because of the seriousness of his illness, he summoned his chief financial controller, Garba Maisikeli and his children. He told them that his days were approaching their end and advised them to live together. He was particularly concerned about the company he had established (Alhassan Dantata & Sons). He asked them not to allow the company to collapse. He implored them to continue to marry within the family as much as possible. He urged them to avoid clashes with other wealthy Kano merchants. They should take care of their relatives, especially the poor among them. Three days later he died in his sleep on Wednesday 17 August 1955. He was buried in his house in the Sarari ward.  Descendants  Some descendants of Alhassan Dantata includes: #Mahmud Dantata, popularly known as Mamuda Wapa (1922‚Äì1983): son. After graduating from Gold Coast University (Ghana) he became his father's chief scribe and Modernized his business activities. He later founded West African Pilgrims Agency in 1948 and pioneered parallel Market Currency Trading in West Africa.

She is founder and director of the non-governmental organization, Progressive Women's Association (PWA), which documents and opposes violence against women. Education and work She holds a Master's of Science from Punjab University, Lahore. After graduation, she worked as a family counselor in Saudi Arabia for seven years. On returning to Pakistan in 1984, Bukhari observed that there were no services for victims of violence and resolved to fill the void. She founded the Progressive Women's Association (PWA) the following year, an organization to help female victims of social and domestic violence. In 1994, the PWA also began taking on cases of acid and burn victims. She also edits and publishes the magazine Women's World. The same year, the PWA successfully lobbied Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto to have all-female police stations established. In 1999, Bukhari converted her family home in Rawalpindi into AASSRA, Pakistan's first shelter home for battered women with children. Bukhari and the Progressive Women's Association have uncovered over 5,675 stove-death victims as part of the 16,000 cases they have documented of violence against women. From 1994 to 2008, the PWA documented 7,800 cases of acid attacks in the Islamabad area. In 2001, Bukhari was arrested for \\"abetting an attempt to commit adultery\\" after sheltering a woman from an abusive husband at AASSRA. She was cleared of the charges two years later. According to Bukhari, she and her family have also received numerous threats as well as subject to frequent police raids. Personal life She is the single parent of two sons and two daughters, the eldest of which serves as her chief assistant. Her former husband lives in the United States. Awards and recognitions Bukhari won the Civil Courage Prize of the US-based Train Foundation in 2003, awarded for \\"steadfast resistance to evil at great personal risk ‚Äî rather than military valor.\\" One year later, Women's eNews named her one of \\"21 Leaders for the 21st Century\\".

One historian of the Liberal Party praised Martell's contribution to Liberal politics, his ceaseless flow of ideas, his great enthusiasm and his work with another official of the party, Philip Fothergill, in securing broadly based finance for the party, while at the same time damning him as a man with the makings of a dictator and possessing wild judgment.Roy Douglas, History of the Liberal Party, 1895‚Äì1970 (Sidgwick & Jackson, 1971), p. 250. Roy Douglas and Mark Egan have said that whilst Martell was never elected to parliament and was a member of the Liberal Party for less than a decade, \\"there is much to be said for the view that he played a major part in keeping the party in existence, when it could easily have disappeared as a serious political force\\".Roy Douglas and Mark Egan, 'Edward Martell', in Duncan Black (ed.), Dictionary of Liberal Biography (Politico's, 1998), p. 249 Martell was the secretary of the Liberal Candidates' Association in the mid-1940s,\\"Mr Macmillan's \\"new party\\"\\", in Manchester Guardian dated 17 September 1946 and in 1946 was elected to the London County Council together with the former member of parliament Sir Percy Harris in the two-member seat of Bethnal Green South West, the first Liberal LCC victories for many years.Douglas, p. 254 In November of that year he stood unsuccessfully as the Liberal candidate in the Parliamentary by-election for the safe Labour seat of Rotherhithe, although he beat the Conservative candidate into third place. He also contested Hendon North for the Liberals at the 1950 general election. Libertarian activist In September 1956 Martell left the Liberal Party. With other dissident Liberals, such as former Liberal Treasurer Lord Moynihan and former Liberal member of parliament Horace Crawfurd, he set up the People's League for the Defence of Freedom, which was later part of the Freedom Group. In 1962 Martell joined the Conservative Party and in 1963 was chairman of the Hastings Conservative association. His anti-trade union newspaper, The New Daily, reached a circulation of 100,000.E. H. H. Green, Ideologies of Conservatism (Oxford University Press, 2004), p. 230 In 1958, during a London bus crew strike, the People's League ran replacement buses and in the \\"work-to-rule\\" of postal service workers in January 1962 it ran a letter delivery service which was suppressed by the Postmaster General. However the League delivered parcels for three weeks, using its own stamps, until the \\"work-to-rule\\" came to an end. This effort was repeated in July 1964 during the one-day strike and overtime ban for postal workers, again with the League's own stamps.People's League Martell has been described as \\"an expert self-publicist\\" who exercised \\"a volatile influence on public opinion during periods of government unpopularity\\".Ramsden, p. 424. =Bristol South East by- election= At the 1963 Bristol South East by-election, which followed Tony Benn's successful campaign to be allowed to give up his peerage and membership of the House of Lords, the Conservatives decided not to fight the by-election. Martell seized the chance to stand against Benn as a National Fellowship or \\"independent right-wing\\" candidate, and in the event was the only serious opposition to Benn's re-election. He attacked Benn for his absence from the constituency during the early stages of the campaignTony Benn, Out of the Wilderness: Diaries 1963‚Äì67, London: Hutchinson, 1987, pp. 48‚Äì49 and continued to run a high-profile campaign, arranging such publicity stunts as betting the local newspaper editor that he would retain his deposit, claiming to have received telephone threats and publicly calling on the Bristol Conservative Party to endorse him, as well as publishing his own 'Election Special' that accused Benn of hawking his peerage to the highest bidder.Benn, pp. 49‚Äì51 During the campaign Geoffrey Pearl, who had been nominated as an \\"anti- socialist\\" candidate, dropped out of the race and called on his supporters to vote for Martell.Benn, p. 52 Martell's strong anti-trade union line counted against him, as local union activists threw themselves wholeheartedly into Benn's campaign.Benn, p. 51 Ultimately Martell came second with 4,834 votes (19%).

Pap's A. M., 529 U.S. 277 (2000), was a landmark decision by the Supreme Court of the United States regarding nude dancing as free speech. The court held that an ordinance banning public nudity did not violate the operator of a totally nude entertainment establishment's constitutional right to free speech.. Prior history On September 28, 1994, the city council of Erie, Pennsylvania, enacted Ordinance 75-1994, a public indecency ordinance that makes it a summary offense to knowingly or intentionally appear in public in a \\"state of nudity.\\"Ordinance 75-1994, City of Erie, Pennsylvania The respondent, Pap's, a Pennsylvania corporation, operated an establishment in Erie known as \\"Kandyland\\" that featured totally nude erotic dancing performed by women. To comply with the ordinance, these dancers would need to wear, at a minimum, pasties and a G-string. On October 14, 1994, two days after the ordinance went into effect, Pap's filed a complaint against the city of Erie, the mayor (Joyce Savacchio), city solicitor (Gregory A. Karle), and members of the city council, seeking declaratory relief and a permanent injunction against the enforcement of the ordinance. The Court of Common Pleas struck down the ordinance as unconstitutional, but the Commonwealth Court reversed the decision. The Pennsylvania Supreme Court in turn reversed the Commonwealth Court, finding that the ordinance's public nudity section was an unconstitutional violation of Pap's First Amendment rights. Certiorari was granted on appeal from the State Supreme Court. Case =Mootness= The Court proceeded to the merits despite a possible mootness issue. While the case was pending, Pap's A.M. went out of business, meaning that no concrete private rights were left to litigate. Despite going out of business, the Supreme Court still proceeded to decide the case on the merits because 1) the City of Erie was suffering an \\"ongoing injury\\" and 2) Pap's was still incorporated and could potentially go back into business. =Rules of law= The Court found the following rules of law to apply: *Being in a state of nudity is not an inherently expressive condition. Totally nude erotic dancing is expressive conduct, although it falls only within the outer ambit of the protection of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution. *Government restrictions on public nudity that ban all public nudity should be evaluated under the framework set forth in United States v. O'Brien for content-neutral restrictions on symbolic speech. *While the doctrinal theories behind incidental burdens and secondary effects are, of course, not identical, there is nothing objectionable about a city passing a general ordinance to ban public nudity, even though such a ban may place incidental burdens on some protected speech, and at the same time recognizing that one specific occurrence of public nudity, nude erotic dancing, is particularly problematic because it produces harmful secondary effects. *For purposes of analysis under the First Amendment to the United States Constitution, even if a regulation has an incidental effect on some speakers or messages but not others, the regulation is content neutral if it can be justified without reference to the content of the expression. =Test= After determining that the ordinance was content neutral, the Court then applied the O'Brien test. The first factor of the O'Brien test for evaluating restrictions on symbolic speech is whether the government regulation is within the constitutional power of the government to enact. The second factor of the O'Brien test for evaluating restrictions on symbolic speech is whether the regulation furthers an important or substantial government interest. The third O'Brien factor is that the government interest must be unrelated to the suppression of free expression. The fourth and final O'Brien factor is that the restriction be no greater than is essential to the furtherance of the government interest. The court found that the ordinance met all four factors of the O'Brien test, and that a \\"least restrictive means\\" analysis was not necessary. The Court reversed the decision of the Pennsylvania Supreme Court, and found the ordinance to be constitutional. =Aftermath= The effects of this case reach beyond simple restriction of nudity. The majority opinion noted: > The government generally has a freer hand in restricting expressive conduct > than it has in restricting the written or spoken word. Concurrence Justice Scalia, joined by Justice Thomas, agreed that the Pennsylvania Supreme Court's decision must be reversed, but disagreed with the mode of analysis that should be applied.

It was closed in 2008. Opened on the historic Wellington Public School Site, Mount Benson Elementary was the oldest operating school site in British Columbia.  History  The original school site was provided by Robert Dunsmuir of Dunsmuir & Diggle Co to accommodate a public school for their new coal town of Wellington and the families working in the Wellington Colliery. The first official public school on this site was called \\"Wellington Public School\\" and opened on May 20, 1875 as part of the Wellington School District which had been created a year earlier.\\"Wellington Public School 1875‚Äì1944, Mount Benson School 1950‚Äì1990 By Carol Jepson. Nanaimo Community Archives In 1904, a few years after James Dunsmuir closed the Wellington mine and moved his buildings to Ladysmith, the school was destroyed by fire. A new one room school was completed in 1906 and was later expanded into a two-room school. At this time most of the children's fathers worked for another of Robert Dunsmuir's creations, the E&N; Railway. Wellington was the main works yard and the school was located adjacent to both the main station and the roundhouse. World War II created teacher shortages across British Columbia which was the catalystVictoria (CP) - Tuesday, July 28, 1942 for the 1942 amalgamation of Wellington into the \\"Nanaimo-Ladysmith United Rural School District\\". The second school was destroyed by fire shortly after 1944 while the community was in the process of creating a neighbourhood athletic centre in the school building. In 1945 Wellington's new school district split into \\"Nanaimo United\\", and \\"Ladysmith United\\", both of which eventually amalgamated into what is the current \\"Nanaimo-Ladysmith School District\\". In 1950 the school was rebuilt as a 3 classroom school, at which point it received a name change and became Mount Benson Elementary School. The school continued to expand and currently has 10 classrooms. Mount Benson School closed in June 2008, as a result of provincial funding cuts and policy changes legislated by bill 34 which resulted in 50% of neighbourhood students attending out of catchment. During 2008 and 2009 the Wellington community and School District have been working towards creating a community centre at the school.  Name  Mount Benson Elementary got its name from Mount Benson, which the school has an excellent view of, and because it was the public school for children who lived on the north-east slope of the Mountain. The Mountain itself was named after Doctor Alfred Benson, who was an Employee of the Hudson's Bay Company, the first doctor in the area, a photographer, a collier and a friend of Robert Dunsmuir, the founder of Wellington. The name of \\"Wellington\\" was moved to the junior high school level with the opening of a Wellington Junior High School in 1967.

(d. 1439 √ó 1440) was an Augustinian canon and prelate active in the 15th century Kingdom of Scotland. While earning a university degree between 1409 and 1417, Bullock gained several benefices in Scotland, and claimed the headship of St Andrews Cathedral Priory before becoming Bishop of Ross in 1418. He held the latter position until his death, which occurred in either 1439 or 1440. Early career Though his career has not been elaborated by modern historians, Bullock is known to have been a university graduate, having a B. Dec., i.e. a Bachelorate in Decrees (canon law); he did not hold that degree in 1409, but did by 1417.He is not styled as such (B. Dec.) in 1409 at least: compare McGurk (ed.), Papal Letters, p. 198, with Ibid, p. 355. Bullock was a canon regular in the diocese of St. Andrews, and on 23 March 1409, is recorded as holding the vicarage of Dull in the diocese of Dunkeld when Avignon Pope Benedict XIII granted his petition to hold the vicarage of Tranent in the diocese of St Andrews.Dowden, Bishops, p. 218, n. 1; McGurk (ed.), Papal Letters, p. 198. A letter of Benedict XIII, dated 5 June 1417, reveals that John Bullock was one of three clergymen claiming the title Prior of St Andrews, a claim which he seems to have given up in the following year when he had the chance to become Bishop of Ross.McGurk (ed.), Papal Letters, p. 355; Watt & Shead, Heads of Religious Houses, p. 189. Bishop of Ross A papal mandate dated 9 March 1418, provided John, \\"elect of Ross\\", to \\"the bishopric of Ross, vacant by the death outside the curia of Alexander, late bishop under whom the bishopric was reserved to papal provision.\\"McGurk (ed.), Papal Letters, p. 368; Watt, Fasti Ecclesiae, p. 268. On 11 March, an indult was issued to John allowing him to be consecrated by any bishop of his choice, assisted by two other bishops.McGurk (ed.), Papal Letters, p. 370; Watt, Fasti Ecclesiae, p. 268. Another papal letter, issued on 15 March, granted one John Begiert, OSA, B. Dec., canon of St Andrews, the vicarage of Dull, \\"vacant by the promotion of John Bullock, former vicar, to the bishopric of Ross\\".McGurk (ed.), Papal Letters, p. 370. The pope has reserved the bishopric of Ross for his own appointment and, on 16 March, Thomas Lyell, who had been elected by the cathedral chapter of Fortrose \\"in ignorance of the reservation\\", was granted 40 crowns in compensation for his expenses, and two days later, he was granted a canonry in the diocese of Aberdeen allowed to be held alongside his other benefices.McGurk (ed.), Papal Letters, pp. 371-2. Bullock was in possession of the temporalities of the bishopric by 1 August 1419.Watt, Fasti Ecclesiae, p. 268. He was consecrated between 16 July, when as \\"elect and confirmed\\" he sent a proctor to the Provincial Synod, and 16 August 1420, when he as \\"through the grace of Gode Byschop of Rosse\\", sealed a charter.Dowden, Bishops, p. 217; see also Watt, Fasti Ecclesiae, p. 268. As a sign of reconciliation and the ending of the Western Schism, Pope Martin V confirmed Benedict XIII's provision and retrospectively confirmed Bullock's acts as bishop on 1 February 1423, after the translation of Gruffydd Young to the titular bishopric of Hippo.Dowden, Bishops, p. 217; Watt, Fasti Ecclesiae, p. 268. Most of the details of Bullock's episcopate are obscure. On 4 September 1439, Bishop Bullock appended his seal to the contract between Joan Beaufort, Queen Dowager, and Sir Alexander Livingston of Callendar, a contract that made Livingstone guardian of the boy king, James II of Scotland.Borthwick, \\"Livingston, Sir Alexander, of Callendar (b. c.1375, d. in or before 1456); \\"Dowden, Bishops, pp. 217-8. He is dead by 26 September 1440, when a papal mandate rejected the postulation of Andrew Munro and provided Thomas de Tulloch to the bishopric, explicitly vacant because of Bullock's death.

Heraldry of the Polish nobility\\" Eustachy Daszkiewicz or Ostap Daszko (; born in Ovruch ‚Äì died after 1535) is considered to be the first recorded leader of a Cossack defense force (according to Dmitri Bantysh-Kamensky, Dmytro Doroshenko, and others). However that claim of \\"first\\" is debatable because there were many other early leaders, including Bohdan Glinski from Severia and Dmytro Vyshnevetsky. Daszkewicz held a position of starosta in Cherkasy (1514‚Äì35) at the early stages of development of cossacks, and is sometimes mistakenly referred to as a hetman. Some sources as well as oral tradition claim that Dashkevych lived past the age of 80, at which age he routed the Tatars at Cherkasy. Origin Daszkiewicz coat of arms Leliwa III Korybut The information about his origin is very scarce. The Polish poet from Kiev region J√≥zef Bohdan Zaleski in the foreword of his duma \\"Out of the Savur's Grave or duma about the first hetman\\" wrote that in his childhood he heard stories about Daszko Wisnowecki who lived on the Knyahynia [Princess] island just south of Kodak. According to the folk tale, the prince perished in his youth leaving on the island his wife (supposedly of Polish origin) and his son who eventually became a glorious a Cossack hetman. Zaleski suggests that Ostap Daszko was a son of Daszko Wisnowecki. In his opinion, the origin of Daszkewicz from the Princes Wisnoweckis could be confirmed as Ostap Daszko has a same family coat of arms. According to Seweryn Uruski, a Polish heraldry specialist, Daszkewicz belonged to the Leliwa coat of arms. Ostap Dashkevych of Orthodox Christian religion, he was presumably a descendant of Rurikid and Gengisid from Ovruch. Daszkewicz also became known as a founders of Zaporizhian Host. He donated his lands near Kyiv to the Church of Resurrection of Christ at Podil in Kyiv. His estate eventually transformed into the village of Voskresenska Slobidka and later gave a name to the Voskresenka neighborhood which is now a part of modern Kyiv on the left bank of Dnieper. Dashkevych was considered the highest authority in Lithuania on the Tatar question. His campaigns sometimes took him as far as the Crimea. However, in 1515 and 1521, while in alliance with the Tatars, he organized campaigns against the Grand Duchy to assist Lithuania. For some of his wars see Crimean-Nogai Raids, years 1515-1531. He took part in the 1507 uprising of Michael Glinski against King Zygmunt I the Old. In 1514, he became the starosta of both Kaniv and Cherkasy. Dashkevych was an effective leader. He took a major role in not only organizing Cossack forces to defend Ukraine, but also in organizing offensive campaigns against the Turks and Tatars. In Piotrk√≥w in 1533, he gave his plan to the Sejm, recommending that the government of the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth organize the Cossacks as a standing military force for the defense of Ukraine, which at the time made up the southern border of the Commonwealth. His plan was approved, but the Commonwealth provided no assistance.  Impact  Ostap Dashkevych made great impact on the organization of Ukrainian Cossack Army and Ukrainian State. He is prominent descendant of prince Rurik and Genghis Khan of czardom of Great Horde, one of the first cossack otamans, which organized different troops of people of Ukraine of that time who identified themselves as cossacks, free men by the will of God in one military and political force, which in such way got a possibility to defend the lives, freedoms and rights of native people of that day Ukraine, who in the most part were of Orthodox Christian faith and Ukrainian language, that's why oppressed by governments and military forces of surrounding countries. In literature Dashkevych's successful rout of the Crimean Tatars' attempt to sack Cherkasy is commemorated in Tomasz Padura's ballad \\"Duma Rycerska\\".

Life Kaiapoi 1875 general election Bowen was born in County Mayo, Ireland and studied law for two years at Cambridge University. At the age of 20 he emigrated with his parents on one of the First Four Ships, the Charlotte Jane, to the Canterbury settlement. His law training led to a position as private secretary to John Robert Godley, founder of the Canterbury colony. He was in charge of the police force, and, together with Crosbie Ward, became a part-owner of the Lyttelton Times newspaper. In 1859, Bowen traversed the Andes on with Clements Markham, and 16 July 1861, he married his sister Georgina Elizabeth Markham. Following their return to Christchurch, Bowen was appointed resident magistrate in 1864, succeeding Joseph Brittan, who had resigned on health grounds. Bowen held the position until 1874. Political career Bowen started his political career by getting elected to the first Canterbury Provincial Council for the Christchurch Country electorate on 10 September 1853. He served until the end of the first term and then successfully contested the Avon electorate, where he was returned on 6 November 1857. He served on the second to fourth Council representing the Avon electorate until 8 February 1865. He became the council's second Speaker in April 1855 and held that role until February 1865. He served on the Canterbury Executive Council from July to September 1857. He was the Council's first Deputy-Superintendent from September 1857 to September 1862. Bowen was directly appointed to cabinet (by way of the Legislative Council) on 16 December 1874, but wary of criticism that a public servant had been awarded political office, he resigned from the Legislative Council and stood for election to the House of Representatives in the 22 January 1875 Kaiapoi by- election, following the resignation of John Studholme on 8 December 1874. He was confirmed by the Kaiapoi electorate at general elections in 1875 and 1879 and served until the end of the 7th Parliament in 1881, when he retired. From 1874 to 1877, he was Minister of Justice in five successive ministries (first Vogel Ministry, Pollen Ministry, second Vogel Ministry, first and second Atkinson Ministry). Bowen was responsible for the Education Act 1877, which provided for compulsory free, secular primary education. He was again appointed to the Legislative Council on 20 January 1891 and served until his death on 12 December 1917. He was appointed as one of seven new members (including Harry Atkinson himself) appointed to the Council by the outgoing fourth Atkinson Ministry; a move regarded by Liberals as a stacking of the upper house against the new government. He was appointed Speaker of the Legislative Council from 1905 to 1915. Bowen was made a Knight Bachelor in 1910 and a Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George in 1914. He had seven children. He died on 12 December 1917 at his homestead and is buried at the cemetery of St Peter's Church in Upper Riccarton.

Phineas Young was an older brother of Brigham Young, who was the president of the LDS Church and the first governor of the Territory of Utah. Life Young was born in Hopkinton, Massachusetts, the seventh child of John Young and Abigail Howe. Early in his life, Phineas was a Methodist preacher.Backman, Milton V. and Keith W. Perkins, Writings of Early Latter-day Saints and their Contemporaries (Provo: Religions Studies Center, 1996) p. 109 In 1830, Young was contacted by Samuel H. Smith, a missionary in the recently established Latter Day Saint movement. Smith sold Young a copy of the Book of Mormon and told him that it had been translated from ancient records by his brother Joseph Smith. Young undertook a careful study of the book and eventually passed it on to others in his family, including his brothers Brigham, Joseph and John. The five sons of John and Nabby Young From left to right: Lorenzo Dow, Brigham, Phineas H., Joseph, and John. On April 15, 1832, Young and his brother John were baptized into the Latter Day Saint Church of Christ.

Along with species of sister genus Litokoala, the Riversleigh rainforest koala is the smallest representative of family Phascolarctide.Black, K. (2014) 1192. Based on cladistic analysis, Nimiokoala is one of the more basal genera of Phascolarctide. It died out due to climate change rendering the environment more arid.Black, K. (2014) 1195. It probably had a more generalized diet than that of the modern species, but its exact food preferences are unknown.  Etymology  The generic name, Nimiokoala, is derived from the Latin word Nimio \\"excessive\\" referring to its complex molar morphology relative to other koala species. The specific name, greystanesi, honors Greystanes High School.  History of research  As of 2013, the fossil record of extinct koalas consists of 163 specimens across 58 deposits in Riversleigh; 55 specimens are attributed to the Riversleigh rainforest koala.Black, K. (2014) p. 1188. To date, a partial skull has been found along with several lower jaws and isolated teeth. On the basis of these fossils, the dental apparatus of the animal has been completely restored. The species was named in 1997. Specimen QMF30482 was assigned as a holotype; its bones are stored in the Queensland Museum.  Description  In the absence of postcranial fossils, the dimensions of the Riversleigh rainforest koala were calculated from measurements of its surviving teeth. It is estimated to have body length of about 25‚Äì30 cm (9.8-11.8 in), and a weight of about 3.5 kg (7.7 lb), one third the size of modern koalas and more than 10 times smaller than the largest known representative of Phascolarctide (Phascolarctos yorkensis). Its muzzle was more prominent than that of modern koalas, resembling the possum snout. The teeth of the Riversleigh rainforest koala are selenodontal (crescent- shaped), with a numerous cusps and accessory shearing blades. The fossilized skull contains large orbits and very large auditory bulliae relative to its size.  Ecology and behavior  In the early-middle Miocene, Riversleigh was covered with tropical forests. More open areas, with karst soil, occurred at forest edges or freshwater streams and lakes. As the climate became more arid, with a more pronounced change of seasons, small species of koalas died out, including the Riversleigh rainforest koala. The small size of Nimiokoala, which requires a proportionately more intensive diet, and large eye sockets, which indicate good night vision, suggest that this animal was much more mobile than the modern koala. The structure of the ear of Nimikoala corresponds to that which can be observed in modern koalas; in conjunction with the large auditory bulliae, it can be concluded that the Riversleigh rainforest koala was sensitive to and used low-frequency sounds for communication, including to attract mates.

She was then used by the Union Navy to patrol navigable waterways of the Confederacy to prevent the South from trading with other countries. Malvern was built in 1860 as William G. Hewes by Harlan and Hollingsworth Co., Wilmington, Delaware, for Charles Morgan‚Äôs Southern Steamship Co. She commenced regular service between New York City and New Orleans, Louisiana, 11 January 1861.  Seized by the Confederacy when war commenced  As William G. Hewes she was seized 28 April by the Governor of Louisiana and put into service as a Confederate blockade runner, although she was not officially registered as a Confederate steamer until 5 April 1862. Because of her speed, maneuverability, and large cargo capacity Hewes was of far greater value as a blockade running transport than as a gunboat. Few of her contemporaries were able to match the 1,440 bale payload of cotton that she carried to Havana, Cuba, in April. When Admiral David Farragut captured New Orleans, Louisiana, in April 1862, Hewes shifted her operations from there to Charleston, South Carolina, and Wilmington, North Carolina. She was then renamed Ella and Annie. Under the Importing & Exporting Co. of South Carolina she renewed blockade running to Bermuda in April 1863.  Captured by Union forces  Damage sustained during a hurricane in September necessitated repairs in Bermuda. Ella and Annie departed there 5 November in company with steamer R. E. Lee. The two ships separated off Carolina and Ella and Annie steamed for Wilmington, North Carolina. She was delayed by a storm and intercepted the morning of 8 November by off New Inlet, North Carolina. Capt. Frank N. Bonneau, CSN, in command of the blockade runner, rammed the northern gunboat in a desperate attempt at evasion. A broadside from Niphon, Acting Master Joseph B. Breck, USN, in command, killed one man in Ella and Annie, riddled her hull, and brought her to. A boarding party from Niphon captured Ella and Annie and her valuable cargo, and a prize crew took her to Boston, Massachusetts. Captain Bonneau was later convicted of piracy by a Boston court, but the presiding officer, who had been a flag officer himself, suspended the sentence on the grounds that he would have acted in a like manner had he been in similar circumstances. =Captured ship acquired by the Union Navy, renamed USS Malvern = Rear Admiral Porter on the deck of Malvern Ella and Annie was condemned as a prize of war and sold to the navy. Hastily armed, renamed Malvern and provisionally commissioned at the Boston Navy Yard 10 December, she was sent to intercept Chesapeake, which had been hijacked at sea by passengers professing allegiance to the Confederacy. Chesapeake was found abandoned, taken to Halifax, Nova Scotia, and turned over to British authorities. Malvern was formally commissioned 9 February 1864 at Boston Navy Yard. Assigned to the North Atlantic Blockading Squadron, she became Admiral David Dixon Porter‚Äôs flagship. She participated in the campaign that resulted in the capture of Fort Fisher, North Carolina, in December 1864 and January 1865. She captured blockade running steamers Stag and Charlotte 19 January off New Inlet, North Carolina, and participated in the attack 18 February on Fort Anderson, Cape Fear River. = Malvern transports President Abraham Lincoln to Richmond = Malvern was frequently utilized for conferences between Lieutenant General Ulysses S. Grant, Rear Admiral Porter, and U.S. President Abraham Lincoln. Her last notable service for the Navy was to convey the President up the James River to Richmond, Virginia, when that city was evacuated by the Confederates on 2 April. A contingent of armed guards from the Malvern protected the President during his visit to the captured Confederate capital city, now under U.S. control, where Lincoln was greeted amicably by former slaves, who hailed him as a hero and credited for their liberation. Even some Richmonders greeted Lincoln amicably as well, with one Virginian girl giving him a bouquet of flowers for his role in ending slavery. Meeting between Duff Green and Abraham Lincoln After Lincoln's visit to Richmond on 4 April, Democratic politician and Confederate supporter Duff Green boarded Malvern, demanding to naval personnel that they take him to speak to President Lincoln, which was done. Calling Green a friend, Lincoln greeted him amicably with a smile at first, however, Green did not reciprocate in kind, refusing to shake Lincoln's hand when it was offered. In full view of Rear Admiral Porter, Green then proceeded to verbally berate Lincoln, calling him a tyrant, a murderer, accusing him of visiting Virginia only to gloat boastfully over the defeated Confederacy, as well as accusing him of starting the Civil War. After patiently listening to Green berate him for a while, Lincoln's smile soon disappeared and he became incensed, angrily condemning Green as being a traitor to the United States for supporting its wartime enemy, the Confederacy: Green, surprised and left speechless by Lincoln's rare bout of anger, quickly exited the room. Porter then ordered military personnel to remove Green from Malvern and not to allow him to board the ship again. =Decommissioning= Malvern decommissioned 24 October 1865 at New York City.  Post-war service after decommissioning  Malvern was sold at auction at New York to S. G. Bogart, who promptly resold her to her original owner. She was again named William G. Hewes and reconditioned for passenger and freight service at Wilmington, Delaware, during January 1866. Charles Morgan then operated her from New Orleans to the Texas Gulf ports until 1878, when he turned his steamers over to the Louisiana & Texas Railroad, which he owned. Hewes' great grandson was a land developer and contractor in the Gulf of Mexico before World War II. A report filed in Texas Contractors Monthly states that Hewes had to sell some of the ship's hardware after losing to J.O. Winston in a high stakes poker match. Those materials were then incorporated into the construction of a grand estate for Mr. Winston's wife, named Malvern, which was designed and built by famed architect John Staub in the Memorial area of Houston, TX. Hewes served in the West Indies fruit trade for many years. She was caught in a violent Gulf storm on 19 or 20 February 1895 and wrecked on Colorado Reef off the coast of Cuba.

Melee is a 2001 crossover fighting video game developed by HAL Laboratory and published by Nintendo for the GameCube. It is the second installment in the Super Smash Bros. series. It features characters from Nintendo video game franchises such as Mario, The Legend of Zelda, Star Fox, and Pok√©mon. The stages and gameplay modes reference or take designs from these franchises as well. Melee includes all playable characters from the first game, and also adds characters from franchises such as Fire Emblem, of which no games had been released outside Japan at the time. Melees gameplay system offers an unorthodox approach to the fighting game genre, with a counter that measures damage with increasing percentages, representing the knockback the character will experience, rather than a depleting health bar seen in most fighting games. It builds on the first game by adding new gameplay features and playable characters. Following the popularity of its multiplayer gameplay, Melee has been featured in many competitive gaming tournaments and is one of the most popular competitive fighting games. It was first released in Japan in November 2001, in the Americas in December 2001, and in Europe and Australia in May 2002. Super Smash Bros. Melee received acclaim from critics, earning praise for its visuals, simple controls, gameplay, and orchestrated soundtrack, as well as several awards and acknowledgments from various publications; it is now considered one of the greatest video games ever made. It achieved strong sales upon its release, becoming the GameCube's best-selling title with over seven million copies sold by 2008. Super Smash Bros. Melee was followed by Super Smash Bros. Brawl for the Wii in 2008.  Gameplay  Like its predecessor, Super Smash Bros. Melee differs from traditional fighting games as the objective is to force their opponents beyond the boundaries of the stage. Most attacks inflict damage and can, if enough damage is dealt, knock back the enemy. Each character's health is measured by a meter that represents damage as a percentage. The higher the percentage value, the farther the player gets knocked back, and the easier they are to knock off the stage, which will result in the character's death and the loss of a stock, or life. Unlike other games of the same genre, in which moves are entered by button-input combinations, most moves in Super Smash Bros. Melee can be accessed via one-button presses and a joystick direction. During battles, items related to Nintendo games or merchandise fall onto the game field. These items have purposes ranging from inflicting damage on the opponent to restoring health to the player. Additionally, most stages have a theme relating to a Nintendo franchise or a specific Nintendo game and are interactive to the player. Although the stages are rendered in three dimensions, players can only move on a two-dimensional plane. Not all stages are available immediately; some stages must be \\"unlocked\\" by achieving particular requirements. Some stages feature moving elements and platforms and hazards that harm players, while others lack these elements. =Single- player= Single-player mode provides the player with a variety of side- scrolling fighting challenges. The applicable modes range from \\"Classic Mode\\", which involves the player battling multiple opponents and a boss character, to the \\"Home Run Contest\\", a minigame involving the player trying to launch a sandbag as far as possible with a Home Run Bat for ten seconds. Some of these modes are personalized for the character; for example, the \\"Target Test\\" sets out a specialized area for a character in which they aim to destroy ten targets in the least amount of time they can. These areas may include references to that particular character's past and legacy. The \\"Board the Platforms\\" minigame from the prequel was not included in Melee. Melee introduced \\"Adventure Mode\\", which takes the player to several predefined universes of characters in the Nintendo franchise. \\"All-Star Mode\\" is an unlockable feature that requires the player to defeat every character in the game while having only one stock and three health supplements between battles. = Multiplayer = Bowser, Ness, Kirby, and Yoshi fight in a \\"Sudden Death\\" match on the Corneria stage, based on Star Fox. In the multiplayer mode, up to four players or computer-controlled characters may fight in a free-for-all or on separate teams. The central processing unit (CPU) characters' artificial intelligence (AI) difficulty is ranked from one to nine in ascending order of difficulty. Individual players can also be handicapped; the higher the handicap, the stronger the player. Victory is determined in five ways, depending on the game type. The two most common multiplayer modes are ‚ÄúTime mode‚Äù, where the player or team with the most KOs and least falls wins after a predetermined amount of time, and \\"Stock mode\\", a battle in which the last player or team with lives remaining wins. This can be changed to less conventional modes like \\"Coin mode\\", which rewards the richest player as the victor. Players must collect coins created by hitting enemies and try not to lose them by falling off the stage; harder hits release higher quantities of coins. Other options are available, updating from Super Smash Bros., such as determining the number and type of items that appear during the battle. = Trophies = Trophies (known as \\"Figures\\" in the Japanese version) of various Nintendo characters and objects can be collected throughout the game. These trophies include figures of playable characters, accessories, and items associated with them as well as series and characters not otherwise playable in the game. The trophies range from the well-known to the obscure, and even characters or elements only released in Japan. Super Smash Bros. had a similar system of plush dolls; however, it only included the 12 playable characters. One trophy is exclusive to the Japanese version of the game.  Playable characters  Super Smash Bros. Melee features 25 (26 if Zelda and Sheik are considered separate) characters, 13 (14 with Zelda and Sheik separate) more than its predecessor. Fourteen are available initially, while the other 11 characters require completing specific tasks to become available. Every character featured in the game is derived from a popular Nintendo franchise. All characters have a symbol that appears behind their damage meter which represents their series, such as a Triforce symbol behind Link's damage meter and a Pok√© Ball behind a Pok√©mon species. Some characters represent popular franchises, while others were less-known at the time of the release; Marth and Roy represent the Fire Emblem series, which was not released outside Japan at the time. The characters' appearance in Super Smash Bros. Melee led to a rise in the popularity of the series, including releasing it outside of Japan. References are made throughout the game to the relationship between characters of the same universe; in one of the events from \\"Event mode\\", Mario must defeat his enemy Bowser to rescue Princess Peach. Furthermore, each character has recognizable moves from their original series, such as Samus's firearms from the Metroid series and Link's arsenal of weapons.  Development and release  HAL Laboratory developed Super Smash Bros. Melee, with Masahiro Sakurai as the head of production. Mario creator Shigeru Miyamoto served as co-producer. The game was one of the first games released on the GameCube and highlighted the advancement in graphics from the Nintendo 64. Sakurai wanted to make an opening FMV sequence to pay homage to the debut of the GameCube. HAL and Sakurai worked with three separate graphic houses in Tokyo to make the opening sequence. On their official website, the developers posted screenshots and information highlighting and explaining the attention to physics and detail in the game, with references to changes from its predecessor. The game was in development for 13 months, and Sakurai called his lifestyle during this period \\"destructive\\" with no holidays and short weekends. Unlike the experimental first Super Smash Bros., he felt great pressure to deliver a quality sequel, claiming it was the \\"biggest project I had ever led up to that point\\". Despite the painful development cycle, Sakurai proudly called it \\"the sharpest game in the series... it just felt really good to play\\", even compared to its successor, Super Smash Bros. Brawl. On the game's official Japanese website, the developers explain reasons for making particular characters playable and explain why some characters were not available as playable characters upon release. Initially, the development team wanted to replace Ness with Lucas, the main character of Mother 3, but retained Ness in consideration of delays. The game's creators later included Lucas in the game's sequel, Super Smash Bros. Brawl. Video game developer Hideo Kojima originally requested the inclusion of Solid Snake to Sakurai, but the game was too far in development, and according to Yuji Naka of Sonic Team, Miyatomo requested the inclusion of Sonic the Hedgehog to Sakurai, but, like Snake, was not added because the game was too far into development. As with Lucas, development time allowed for his inclusion in Brawl. Marth and Roy were initially intended to be playable exclusively in the Japanese version of Super Smash Bros. Melee. However, they received favorable attention during the game's North American localization, leading to the decision for the developers to include them in the Western version. Sakurai stated that the development team had suggested characters from four other games to represent the Famicom/NES era until the developers decided that the Ice Climbers would be in the game. The developers have noted characters that have very similar moves to each other on the website; such characters have been referred to as \\"clones\\" in the media. Nintendo presented the game at the Electronic Entertainment Expo 2001 as a playable demonstration. The next major exposition of the game came in August 2001 at Spaceworld, when Nintendo displayed a playable demo that updated from the previous demo displayed at E3. Nintendo offered a playable tournament of the games for fans in which a GameCube and Super Smash Bros. Melee were prizes for the winner. Before the game's release, the Japanese official website included weekly updates, including screenshots and character profiles. Nintendo followed this trend with Super Smash Bros. Brawl, in which there were daily updates by the game's developer, Masahiro Sakurai. Japanese gaming magazine Famitsu reported that Nintendo advertised the game in between showings of Pok√©mon 4Ever across movie theaters in Japan. In January 2003, Super Smash Bros Melee became part of the Player's Choice, a marketing label used by Nintendo to promote video games that have sold more than a million copies. In August 2005, Nintendo bundled the game with the GameCube for $99.99. = Music = Super Smash Bros. Melee features both new and re- arranged music from many of Nintendo's popular gaming franchises. In 2002, Enterbrain released a soundtrack in Japan titled Dairantou Smash Brothers DX Orchestra Concert. The same soundtrack was released in 2003 as Smashing... Live! as a bonus for subscribing to Nintendo Power magazine in North America, and also as a free gift in an issue of the British Official Nintendo Magazine. The soundtrack does not include music taken directly from the game, but features many live orchestral arrangements performed by the New Japan Philharmonic. The game contains a number of unlockable tracks that can be obtained after making certain in-game accomplishments. On the same website, the developers have posted discussions about the game's music and voice acting between Masahiro Sakurai and the game's composers. Dean Harrington is the game's in-game narrator, and also voices Master Hand and Crazy Hand.  Reception  Super Smash Bros. Melee received critical acclaim from reviewers, most of whom credited Melees expansion of gameplay features from Super Smash Bros. Focusing on the additional features, GameSpy commented that \\"Melee really scores big in the 'we've added tons of great extra stuff' department\\". Reviewers compared the game favorably to Super Smash Bros. IGN's Fran Mirabella III stated that it was \\"in an entirely different league than the N64 version\\"; GameSpot's Miguel Lopez praised the game for offering a more advanced \\"classic-mode\\" compared to its predecessor, while detailing the Adventure Mode as \\"really a hit-or-miss experience\\". Despite a mixed response to the single-player modes, many reviewers expressed the game's multiplayer mode as a strong component of the game. In their review of the game, GameSpy stated that \\"you'll have a pretty hard time finding a more enjoyable multiplayer experience on any other console\\". Melees visuals garnered a positive reaction. GameSpot lauded the game's character and background models, stating that \\"the character models are pleasantly full-bodied, and the quality of their textures is amazing\\". IGN's Fran Mirabella III praised the game's use of physics, animation and graphics, although his colleague Matt Casamassina thought that \\"some of the backgrounds lack the visual polish endowed upon the characters\\" when giving a second opinion about the game. Critics praised the game's orchestrated soundtrack; while GameSpot's Greg Kasavin commented that \\"it all sounds brilliant\\". GameSpy praised the music for its nostalgic effect, with soundtracks ranging from multiple Nintendo series. Reviewers have welcomed the simplistic controls, but its \\"hyper-responsiveness\\", with the characters easily dashing and precise movements being difficult to perform, was expressed as a serious flaw of the game by GameSpot. With a milder criticism of controls, Bryn Williams of GameSpy commented that \\"movement and navigation seems slightly too sensitive\\". The basis of Melees gameplay system is the battles between Nintendo characters, which has been suggested as being overly hectic; N-Europe questioned whether the gameplay is \\"too Frantic?\\", even though they enjoyed the variety of modes on offer. Similarly, Nintendo Spin's Clark Nielsen stated that \\"Melee was too fast for its own good\\", and \\"skill was more about just being able to wrap your head around what was happening as opposed to really getting into the combat\\". In regards to the pace of the game, Edge commented that it even made gameplay features such as \\"blocking\\" redundant, as the player is not given enough time to react to an attack. Despite the new features added to the game, some reviews criticized Melee for a lack of originality and for being too similar to its predecessor, Super Smash Bros. Caleb Hale from GameCritics.com noted that while it was \\"every bit as good as its Nintendo 64 predecessor\\" he also felt \\"the game doesn't expand much past that point\\". On a similar note, Edge stated that \\"it's not evolution; it's reproduction\\", in reference to a perceived lack of innovation. The nostalgic nature of the game received a positive reaction, as well as the accompanying stages and items that allude to past Nintendo games. Gaming journalists have welcomed the roster of 26 Nintendo characters, as well as the trophy system, which Nintendo Spin labeled as \\"a great addition to this game\\". = Sales = When released in Japan, it became the fastest selling GameCube game with 358,525 units sold in the week ending November 25, 2001. This success continued as the game sold more than a million units only two months after its release, making it the first GameCube title to reach a million copies. The game also sold well in North America, where it sold 250,000-copies in nine days. In the United States, Super Smash Bros. Melee was the 19th best-selling video game in 2001 according to the NPD Group. By July 2006, it had sold 3.2 million copies and earned $125 million in the United States alone. Next Generation ranked it as the fifth highest-selling game launched for the PlayStation 2, Xbox or GameCube between January 2000 and July 2006 in that country. Approximately 4.06 million units have been sold in the country as of December 27, 2007. With a software-to-hardware ratio of 3:4 at one time, some have attributed the increasing sales of the GameCube near the launch date to Melee. As of March 10, 2008, Super Smash Bros. Melee is the best-selling GameCube game, with more than seven million copies sold worldwide. It has been estimated that at one point in time 70% of all GameCube owners also owned Melee. = Awards and accolades = Several publications have acknowledged Super Smash Bros. Melee in competitions and awards. In their \\"Best of 2001\\" awards, GameSpy chose it as Best Fighting GameCube Game, IGN's reader choice chose it as Game of the Year, Electronic Gaming Monthly chose it as Best Multiplayer and Best GameCube Game, and GameSpot chose it as the Best GameCube Game and tenth best game of the year. GameFAQs placed it sixth in a poll of the 100 best games ever and was in the final four of the \\"Best. Game. Ever.\\" contest. In the 200th issue of Electronic Gaming Monthly, the editors selected Melee as the 92nd most influential game in their \\"Top 200 Games of Their Time\\" list, defining Melee as \\"Billions of things to unlock, plus Yoshi pummeling Pikachu with a bat\\". In a similar competition, Nintendo Power named Super Smash Bros. Melee the 16th best game ever to appear on a Nintendo console, and selected it as the 2001 \\"Game of the Year\\". IGN named it the third best GameCube game of all-time in 2007 as a part of a feature reflecting on the GameCube's long lifespan, citing it as \\"the grand stage of fighters, much like Mario Kart is for racing fans\\". GameSpy chose it as fourth in a similar list, citing that it had \\"better graphics, better music, more characters, more gameplay modes, more secrets to discover\\" in comparison to its predecessor. The game was ranked 58th in Official Nintendo Magazine's \\"100 Greatest Nintendo Games Ever\\" feature. In 2019, Game Informer ranked it as the 2nd best fighting game of all time.  Professional competition  Super Smash Bros. Melee is a widely played competitive video game and has been featured in several high-profile tournaments. Many consider it to be the most competitively viable game in the series. From 2004 to 2007, Major League Gaming sponsored Melee on its Pro Circuit. Although dropping Melee from its 2007 Pro Circuit, MLG still sponsored a number of tournaments as part of the Underground Smash Series. Melee was also included in the Evolution Championship Series (Evo) in 2007, a fighting game tournament held in Las Vegas and was hosted at Evo 2013 after a charity vote to decide the final game to be featured in its tournament lineup. Due to the large turnout and popularity that year, Evo again included Melee at their 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017 and 2018 events. In 2014 Melee was played at MLG Anaheim. Evo 2016 is the largest Melee tournament to date with 2,350 entrants. Ken Hoang, also known as \\"The King of Smash\\", considered to be the game's best player from 2003 to 2006, has won over $50,000 from Smash tournaments. As of August 2018, Adam \\"Armada\\" Lindgren has won over $300,000 from Smash tournaments in total and over $90,000 in 2017 alone, placing his tournament winnings as one of the highest of all professional Melee players. Several professional Melee players including Christopher \\"KillaOR\\" McKenzie, Isai Alvarado, and Ken were seen in the 2005 \\"I'm a Professional Gamer\\" episode of the MTV reality series True Life. The competitive Smash community was featured in a 2013 crowd-funded documentary called The Smash Brothers. The film detailed the history of the professional scene and profiled seven prominent Melee players including Hoang, Azen, Jason \\"Mew2King\\" Zimmerman, Isai, PC Chris, KoreanDJ, and Evo 2013 and Evo 2014 champion, Joseph \\"Mang0\\" Marquez. Commentary footage from a Melee tournament is the origin of the Wombo combo internet meme. In 2020, a mod for Melee, Project Slippi--designed to introduce quality-of-life features such as replays and online play--was updated to support rollback netcode and integrated matchmaking, allowing netplay across large distances with little latency.

It was originally built in Vancouver by International Submarine EngineeringISE and purchased by the Canadian federal government. The same government program also operated the Pisces IV manned submersible, now in Hawaii being run by the Hawai'i Undersea Research Laboratory (HURL)HURL who found the long-lost two-man Japanese sub which heralded the attack on Pearl Harbor. The funding for the Canadian submersible program eventually dried up, but by that time the user group had been established and long term experiments put in place on the sea floor. The Canadian Scientific Submersible Facility (CSSF) was formed and leased ROPOS from the government for several years before finally purchasing the ROV a few years ago. In 2005 the vehicle was extensively rebuilt and now boasts a thru- frame lift capability (see below). The ROV is controlled and powered from a surface vessel. Electrical power is supplied through an umbilical, or tether, which also has an optical fibre for telemetry and data. Electrical power is used to power components such as lights and cameras, but most of the energy is used in an electric motor to drive a hydraulic pump. The hydraulic pump in turn powers the thrusters and hydraulic components of the ROV. This is referred to as an electro-hydraulic system. ROPOS is unusual as it is routinely modified to work in three different ranges: 1000 m (540 fathoms); 2,500 m (1,350 fathoms); and (rarely) 5,000 m (2,700 fathoms). Each set up is progressively larger. ROPOS also has \\"plug and play\\" equipment; A hot fluid sampler (HFS) at about and requires 120 V AC and a data line to function, and a number of different hydraulic functions which are available for scientific equipment, similar to the Woods Hole vehicles Jason and Jason 2. Thru-frame lift ROPOS is capable of lifting off the sea floor: the load is attached to the ROV and is lifted by the mid-depth system LARS (launch and recovery system), an enhanced crane modified to accommodate the ROV.

Arthur Lee Whitfield On August 14, 1981, Arthur Lee Whitfield was accused of the rape of a woman in Norfolk, Virginia. Twenty five years ago, the woman identified Whitfield as her attacker, describing him as a tall, muscular black, light skinned with hazel eyes (Washington). This description was also used to identify an attacker from another rape that occurred earlier that night. Whitfield was tried and convicted for these two rapes and sentenced to 63 years (Washington). Whitfield was released by Virginia authorities in August 2004, when a Norfolk prosecutor said DNA evidence proved Whitfield did not commit the two rapes. Whitfield had already served 22 years for the rapes that DNA proved he did not commit (Innocence Project). The woman in the alleged attack does not agree with the DNA testing, saying she knew who she saw. The victim questions state authorities on the profile of Mary Jane Burton, the former crime lab scientist whose work has sparked a review of hundreds of cases and exoneration from the former governor, Mark Warner (Isadora). Whitfield was released on parole, but is trying to get a pardon from the Virginia governor, Tim Kaine. Since the Virginia Supreme Court did not declare him innocent (Isadora), if Whitfield does not get his record cleared, he will be a registered sex offender for life. Julius Ruffin On December 6, 1981, Julius Ruffin was accused of raping, sodomizing, and robbing a woman in her home. The victim looked for a black male and identified Ruffin as her attacker, though the description did not match up (Mid-Atlantic Innocence Project). Ruffin is 6'1\\" (187 cm), with light skin, and two distinguishable gold teeth and facial hair. She identified her attacker as 5'8\\" (174 cm) with dark skin. On October 1, 1982, he ended being sentenced to life in prison.https://www.innocenceproject.org/cases/julius-ruffin/ In June 2002, Virginia courts passed a law that allowed felons to petition the courts for DNA testing. On February 13 of the following year Ruffin, was released by DNA testing. Ruffin was pardoned by the former governor of Virginia and given $1.5 million in compensation (Innocence Project). Similarity in cases These cases were revisited for two reasons. For one their lawyers never gave up fighting for them. Second the Virginia courts passed the law to let felons petition for DNA testing. Since both of these things were done to a great extent the cases were reopened and retested. It proved that they were innocent of the charges after all. The new evidence this brought out was that the former crime lab scientist had kept the DNA in her notebook which allegedly could have caused contamination and getting the real rapist out of trouble and the innocent ones in trouble. Exoneration Although the real criminal has been convicted, only one of the 'convicts' has had his name totally cleared. Julius Ruffin received $1.5 million in compensation and has had his name completely erased from the registered sex offender list and his record has been cleared of the crimes (Makron). However, Arthur Lee Whitfield is still on the registered sex offender list, has yet to receive a pardon from the Governor of Virginia, and no verdict or decision has been made (Makron). Once the actual rapist was found, both Ruffin and Whitfield were exonerated. Aaron Doxie III, the real perpetrator was convicted for unrelated rapes, and will not be tried for the Virginia rapes because the cases are too cold and much of the evidence has been destroyed (Washington). Also, both of the women insist that Ruffin and Whitfield, respectively, are their attackers.

Water stops and breaks have become obligatory relatively recently. Before the 1950s, there had been a practice to eliminate water breaks in order \\"to toughen up boys\\" (see \\"Junction Boys\\" for an example). Water stops are used to combat interrelated dangers: hyperthermia, dehydration and hyponatremia (low blood level of sodium). Drinking water combats dehydration, while intake of electrolyte solutions (often provided by various sports drinks) combats hyponatremia and its severe form, water intoxication. In a marathon, waters stops are usually at every 5K or at every 2 miles, resulting in 8-12 stops. Stopping for 10 seconds per station results in 1-2 minutes of added time, but the loss of stamina due to dehydration would add much more.Scott M. Douglas, Peter D.

Dupont website  History  Simon Tissot-Dupont (born in Savoy in 1847) founded a carriage company which was destroyed in a fire in 1872. The same year, he bought a workshop which made leather briefcases for diplomats and businessmen. In 1884, Dupont became the supplier to one of the world's largest shops ‚Äì Les Grands Magasins du Louvre ‚Äì while maintaining his private clientele. Dupont handed over his company in 1919 to his sons, Lucien and Andr√©, who, trading under the name of Les Fils de S.T. Dupont (the Sons of S.T. Dupont), relaunched the activity. They focused on high-quality travel cases and accessories. Craftsmen were employed and patents were taken out to protect industrial secrets. 250 workers and 17 separate traders were involved in the manufacture, including goldsmiths, woodworkers, engravers, leather craftsmen, lacquer workers, and locksmiths. S.T. Dupont transferred its workshops from rue Dieu in Paris back to the family's hometown of Faverges in Savoy in 1924. In 1929, Lucien Tissot-Dupont was invited to New York by Louis Cartier to present his travel cases in their 5th Avenue shop. On the ship going to New York, he learned about the Wall Street crash. In response, on his subsequent return to Paris, he decided to move even further upmarket and cater to clients unaffected by the crash. In 1971, Gillette purchased 48% of the stock of S.T. Dupont.

They may be commercially packaged or frozen at home. A wide range of frozen vegetables are sold in supermarkets. Frozen veg is also used as a colloquial saying in New Zealand which also means as \\"cold as ice.\\" In Ireland it can also mean to be cool, as in \\"as cool as a cucumber\\". For example \\"oh Laura, she is so frozen veg\\". Examples of frozen vegetables which can be found in supermarkets include spinach, broccoli, cauliflower, peas, corn, yam (in Asia) either packaged as a single ingredient or as mixtures. There are occasions when frozen vegetables are mixed with other food types, such as pasta or cheese. Some popular brands include Birds Eye, Sunbulah and Green Giant, as well as supermarkets' 'store brand' items. Frozen vegetables have some advantages over fresh ones, in that they are available when the fresh counterpart is out-of-season, they have a very long shelf life when kept in a freezer and that they often have been processed a step or more closer to eating. In many cases, they may be more economical to purchase than their fresh counterparts. The history of frozen fruits can date back to the Liao Dynasty of China, with the \\"frozen\\" pear being a classic delicacy eaten by the Khitan tribes in the Northeastern region of China. Health benefits and risks In general, boiling vegetables can cause them to lose vitamins. Thus, the process of blanching does have deleterious effects on some nutrients. In particular, vitamin C and folic acid are susceptible to loss during the commercial process, and canned or frozen broccoli for instance loses the entirety of its nutrient. In addition, studies have shown that thawing frozen vegetables before cooking can accelerate the loss of vitamin C.Researchers preserve cancer-fighting properties in frozen broccoli Over the years, there has been controversy as to whether frozen vegetables are better or worse than fresh ones. Generally, reports show that frozen vegetables are as nutritionally beneficial when compared to fresh ones. A 1997 study performed by the University of Illinois, 2007 study performed by University of California - Davis and a 2003 Austrian study support that canned or frozen produce has no substantial nutritional difference not attributable to the presence of added salt, syrup or other flavouring, and in fact suggest that canned or frozen produce is nutritionally superior because of the very rapid deterioration of nutrients in fresh produce.Are Frozen Vegetables Nutritious An advantage that frozen vegetables have over canned is that many brands contain little or no added salt because the freezing process by itself is able to stop bacterial growth. However, many canned vegetable brands with little or no sodium have become available and many frozen brands do have salt added for more flavour.Guidelines for a Low Sodium Diet See also *Frozen food *Canned food *Cold chain References External links *How Frozen Vegetables are Made Category:Food preservation Category:Convenience foods Category:Vegetables ","title":"Frozen vegetables"},{"id":"13655251","text":"Trinity Cathedral is an Episcopal Church in downtown Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and is the cathedral for the Episcopal Diocese of Pittsburgh. The present Gothic church was completed in 1872 on the site of a hilltop cemetery on land deeded by heirs of Pennsylvania founder William Penn to the congregation's founders. The site, centered on a terrace above the historic \\"point\\" (where the Allegheny River and the Monongahela River join to form the Ohio River) was sacred to Native Americans as a burial ground. The Trinity Churchyard has the oldest marked graves west of the Atlantic Seaboard, of both Native American leaders, French, English, and American colonists. 1780s Round Church The first Trinity Church was built two blocks to the west of this burial ground at the base of the hill or terrace initially. It was constructed from the 1780s to 1805. This first church was a brick building, octagonal in shape in the meeting-house style of architecture. It was known as ‚ÄúThe Round Church.‚ÄùThe Round Church It was situated on a sort of triangular lot with streets on each of the three sides, so that enlargement was out of the question.\\"John Henry Hopkins, Jr. (One of His Sons), The Life of the Late Right Reverend John Henry Hopkins, First Bishop of Vermont, and Seventh Presiding Bishop.

Huntington and Co., 1873), 70. 1824 Cathedral In 1824, Trinity moved to its current site in the middle of the terrace churchyard with what is regarded as the first Gothic structure in Western Pennsylvania. John Henry Hopkins was the architect for the new building. He designed it to seat a thousand people. Hopkins' plans were adopted by the Vestry without alteration. On May 1, the feast of S. Philip and S. James, the corner-stone was laid. The building was \\"brick, roughcast on the outside.\\" The Church was wide, with galleries on three sides, supported by slender cluster. The ceiling was \\"painted in imitation fan-vaulting.\\"John Henry Hopkins, Jr. (One of His Sons), The Life of the Late Right Reverend John Henry Hopkins, First Bishop of Vermont, and Seventh Presiding Bishop. (F. J. Huntington and Co., 1873), 72-73. The growing congregation built St. Peter as a chapel of ease. However, in 1869 the growing congregation erected a new structure.1824 Move. Current Cathedral The current cathedral was completed in 1872. It was the tallest building in the city until the construction of the Allegheny County Courthouse in 1888. The cathedral was designed by architect Gordon W. Lloyd in 1870-71 with an exterior featuring English Gothic Style that was favored by mid-Victorian Episcopalians including a single central steeple and side transepts. The interior features a tall nave flanked by aisles and lit by clerestory windows. The nave walls are supported by clustered stone columns, and the austere interior ornamentation, in which the pointed arch predominates, is reminiscent of the work of the American Gothicist Richard Upjohn. Some of the stained glass windows in the nave were destroyed in a fire in 1967, and were replaced by new ones in a medieval style. All other windows date from 1872. The carved stone pulpit was built in 1922 to the design of the renowned American architect Bertram G. Goodhue. In 2007, the cathedral exterior was cleaned for the first time in preparation for the Episcopal Diocese of Pittsburgh's 250th anniversary. The cleaning removed remnants of industrial soot dating to Pittsburgh's steel making days. The grime was causing acid runoff to deteriorate the exterior stonework. Anglican Realignment On November 2, 2007, the convention of the Episcopal Diocese of Pittsburgh approved a first reading of changes to the diocesan constitution and canons designed to secede from the Episcopal Church as part of global Anglican realignment. The decision was affirmed by a second vote in October 2008 resulting in schism. In preparation for the October 2008 schism, the Cathedral Chapter adopted a special resolution on July 24, 2008. It stated the Cathedral Chapter's intention \\"...neither to withdraw from The Episcopal Church nor to withdraw from a realigned Diocese of Pittsburgh.\\" Over the next three years, the cathedral continued to be led by the Rev. Dr. Catherine Brall as Canon Provost and included elected representatives from both the rump and breakaway dioceses and the cathedral's lay delegate had voice and vote in both the Episcopal and realigned Anglican diocesan conventions. The arrangement was terminated on December 15, 2011, when the Cathedral Chapter voted to reaffirm its original 1928 articles of incorporation which specified that Trinity Cathedral was an Episcopal congregation. That vote constituted a repudiation of the Special Resolution adopted in 2008 restoring the cathedral's service solely as the seat of the Episcopal Bishop of Pittsburgh. In June 2015, Bishop Dorsey W. M. McConnell restored Trinity Cathedral to the center of diocesan life by relocating diocesan offices to the downtown cathedral from the suburb of Monroeville. During the tumultuous realignment, diocesan offices had been located in the Oliver Building between 1999-2009 and the Jonnet Building in Monroeville from 2009 to 2015.

Headquartered in Portland, Oregon, Collins was the first privately owned forest products company in the United States to have all of its hardwood and softwood forests certified by the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC). In addition to its forests and sawmills, Collins also manufactures siding and trim, particleboard, hardwood, and softwood lumber, and operates retail hardware and lumber yards in northern California. Divisions include: Collins Pine Company, Kane Hardwood, Collins Hardwood LLC, Collins Products LLC, Collins Builders Supply, and the Almanor Railroad.  History  =19th century= Truman Doud (TD) Collins began what was later known as the Collins Companies in 1855 at Turkey Run near Whig Hill, Pennsylvania. He and five others, including his brother, Joseph Van Halen (JV) Collins, bought a steam mill and timber from John Alexander. By 1864, TD Collins bought out the remaining partners including his brother. =20th century= Before TD Collins died in 1914, he owned, along with others, a large number of sawmills in the Tionesta Valley of Pennsylvania, over of timberland, the Tionesta Manufacturing Company, the Nebraska Box Mill, the Mayburg Chemical Plant, plus over of logging railroad, of main line, 25 locomotives, several oil companies, and a bank. Married to Mary Stanton Collins, they had one son, Everell (ES) Stanton Collins. Following TD's death, Everell took over the company. He moved the company westward, purchasing forestlands in northern California, Washington, and Oregon. By the time he died in 1940, ES Collins would oversee the operations of 15 timber, logging, railroad, and pulp & paper companies in four states, in addition to moving the company headquarters from Pennsylvania to Portland, Oregon. Following his father, Truman W. Collins became president. During his years in the timber business he began implementing sustainable forest management practices. These practices contributed to the Collins Companies becoming the first privately owned forest products company in the United States to become certified by the Forest Stewardship Council. Truman Collins continued the family's charitable works including founding, among others, the Collins Foundation, the Collins Medical Trust, and the Collins/McDonald Trust. Following Truman's death in 1963, Truman's brother-in-law, Elmer Goudy took over the presidency, followed by his son, Alan Collins Goudy. Truman's wife, Maribeth Wilson Collins, also became involved in the company, serving first as president of The Collins Foundation and later as Chair of the Board of The Collins Companies. =21st century= In 2005, Maribeth Collins stepped down and her daughter, Cherida Collins Smith, became Chair of the Board of The Collins Companies; Maribeth's son, Truman W. Collins, Jr., became president of the Collins Foundation; and her son, Terry Collins, a forester with the company, became president of the Collins Timber Company.  Environmental commitment  Collins has committed to being responsible partners in land and resource management with a policy of change through leadership. Collins asserts that third-party, independent certification of forest lands is the best way to ensure the viability of the total forest ecosystem. The company is also a member of Forest Stewardship Council.

Petra»ôcu or Pƒïtra»ôcuGarabet IbrƒÉileanu, \\"Edi»õiile poeziilor lui Eminescu (continuare)\\", in Via»õa Rom√¢neascƒÉ, Nr. 3/1928, p.424 (common renditions of Nicolae Petra»ôcu /; born Nicolae Petrovici ; ; December 5, 1859 - May 24, 1944) was a Romanian journalist, essayist, literary critic, novelist, and memoirist. The author of monographs on major figures in Romanian literature, Petra»ôcu was originally affiliated with the conservative literary society Junimea, but did not embrace all its tenets. Like his friend, novelist Duiliu Zamfirescu, he parted with the group and, together with Dimitrie C. OllƒÉnescu-Ascanio, established a new circle around the magazine LiteraturƒÉ »ôi ArtƒÉ Rom√¢nƒÉ (\\"Romanian Literature and Art\\"). During the 1890s, his group carried an extended polemic with Junimea, and Petra»ôcu developed his own tenets, which took Historicism, Sociological positivism, and Determinism as its main sources of inspiration. He was also noted for endorsing the views of Western European thinkers such as Hippolyte Taine and √âmile Hennequin. In this context, he engaged in public debates with the Junimist intellectuals Titu Maiorescu, P. P. Negulescu, and Mihail Dragomirescu. Alongside OllƒÉnescu-Ascanio and Zamfirescu, his circle came to include, among others, poet Alexandru Vlahu»õƒÉ, novelist Gala Galaction, and architect Ion Mincu. N. Petra»ôcu was the brother of Gheorghe Petra»ôcu, a renowned painter.CƒÉlinescu, p.542 Petra»ôcu authored a single novel, titled Marin Gelea. The work deals with the status of geniuses in the late 19th century Romanian Kingdom, and contains several references to important cultural figures of the day. Biography =Early life and career= Born in Tecuci as the son of Costache Petrovici-Rusciucliu and Elena Bi»õa, he had his surname changed to Petra»ôin‚Äîaccording to literary historian George CƒÉlinescu, this was on the initiative of Gheorghe and Nicolae's cousin. Also according to CƒÉlinescu, it was Nicolae who later changed the family name to Petra»ôcu, which, the researcher argued, was a \\"voivodal\\" variant (akin to the names of medieval Wallachian figures such as Prince PƒÉtra»ôcu cel Bun). Before the 1890s, N. Petra»ôcu attended Junimea sessions and was an admirer of its main figure, the thinker and Conservative Party politician Titu Maiorescu. Corina Popescu, Verismul italian »ôi literatura rom√¢nƒÉ, 5.1.3, at the University of Bucharest; retrieved October 10, 2007Ornea, p.127-128, 134-135 His other literary idol inside Junimea was Mihai Eminescu (later recognized as Romania's national poet): Petra»ôcu was one of the young and aspiring authors who had discovered Eminescu's work just before the poet went mad and isolated himself, a generation subsequently classified as \\"Eminescian\\". Beginning in 1887, Petra»ôcu sporadically contributed to the Junimist mouthpiece Convorbiri Literare, sending literary essays which he usually signed with the pen name A. Costin.Ornea, p.128, 129 At the time, Petra»ôcu published a series of studies on Romanian writers, including the Romantic Dimitrie Bolintineanu and the Junimist figures Eminescu and Vasile Alecsandri (both of whom successively affiliated with Romanticism and Junimea).Ornea, p.339-340 Some of his other essays were noted for their polemic tone: among these was his earliest, a piece on short story writer Barbu »òtefƒÉnescu-Delavrancea, and an 1888 text on Constantin Mille and his only novel, Dinu Millian.Ornea, p.129, 134-135 His work for the Convorbiri Literare journal included a study of Eminescu's work. It was published as a series between 1890 and 1891 (that is, in the two years following Eminescu's death), but carried the title Mihail Eminescu, studiu critic 1892 (\\"Mihail Eminescu, Critical Study 1892\\") [sic]. In 1893, Maiorescu publicly praised the Eminescu monograph, and awarded it a prize.Ornea, p.128 Petra»ôcu later admitted that the writing was actually \\"an admiring recollection of the great poet\\". The essay was also at the center of a polemic with the anti-Junimist figure and Marxist philosopher Constantin Dobrogeanu- Gherea, on topics surrounding the pessimistic nature evident in some of Eminescu's best-known poems.Ornea, p.340, 345, 357 While Dobrogeanu-Gherea spoke of social causes behind the poet's attitudes, Petra»ôcu attributed these to \\"a change in the fundamental forces of the contemporary soul, that is to say in the relation between intelligence, will, and faith\\".Ornea, p.340 Dobrogeanu-Gherea chose not to reply to these points.Ornea, p.357 The study was nevertheless acknowledged decades later by Dobrogeanu-Gherea's disciple, literary historian Garabet IbrƒÉileanu, who noted its biographical research. Investigating the circumstances of Eminescu's illness and the impact it had on the poet's work, IbrƒÉileanu used assessments made by Petra»ôcu (and, separately, the testimonies of poet Mite Kremnitz), to conclude that Eminescu had been incapable of producing any more poems after the full onset of his symptoms. In May of the same year, his various pieces were reunited under the title Figuri literare contemporane (\\"Contemporary Literary Figures\\"), which opened with a study on Titu Maiorescu.Ornea, p.128, 340-341 =Transition= Nevertheless, his views were often shaped by outside influences. According to literary historian Z. Ornea, Maiorescu's rejection of most new literary trends may have been resented from early on by several young Junimists: alongside Petra»ôcu, these included the radical politicians George Panu and Nicolae Xenopol.Ornea, p.13, 127, 128-129 He clarified his position in time, through polemics, and, during an April 1892 lecture he gave at the Romanian Athenaeum, confessed that he impressed by Positivism following an 1890 trip to Paris. On the same occasion, he claimed that science had the power to \\"remove\\" Idealism, metaphysics, and faith itself. His lecture showed similarities with that of left-wing anti-Junimists such as Dobrogeanu-Gherea, as well as with the ideals expressed by Nicolae Xenopol.Ornea, p.128-129 In contrast to both Junimea and the Romantic writer Bogdan Petriceicu Hasdeu, Petra»ôcu showed that he accepted Realist and Naturalism. At the time, the two innovative currents stood accused of having been generated locally through \\"imitation\\", and of not being connected with the cultural environment. The speaker, who stated that \\"the spirit of imitation\\" was normal and \\"the strongest [one] on which the world's progress rests\\", nonetheless took distance from Dobrogeanu-Gherea and the socialist press in arguing against the Naturalist perception of society as a decaying body. =Polemic with Junimea= His definitive split with Junimea came in 1896, and saw the creation of LiteraturƒÉ »ôi ArtƒÉ Rom√¢nƒÉ as a magazine headed by Dimitrie C. OllƒÉnescu-Ascanio. This coincided with a noted decline in Junimist influence, and was one of several departures‚Äîother prominent Junimists to adopt independent and distinct positions around the same date were Constantin RƒÉdulescu-Motru and Mihail Dragomirescu.Tudor Vianu, Scriitori rom√¢ni, Vol. II, Editura Minerva, Bucharest, 1971, p.11. The journal soon enlisted contributions from other adversaries of Junimea, including Zamfirescu, Dimitrie Anghel, »òtefan Octavian Iosif, George Co»ôbuc, Alexandru Vlahu»õƒÉ, G. Dem. Teodorescu, and »òtefan PeticƒÉ. The group spoke out against Junimea's strict aesthetic guidelines, and advocated instead an art with a patriotic message and a return to \\"national specificity\\". Petra»ôcu himself hailed the French theorist Hippolyte Taine for the emphasis he placed on race, milieu, and moment, arguing that its \\"organic\\" character could serve to renew art and literature in Romania.Ornea, p.86-87 In parallel, he was interested in √âmile Hennequin's Positivism, with its notion of \\"scientific criticism\\". Among other influences he cited were Charles Augustin Sainte-Beuve, Francesco de Sanctis, Bonaventura Zumbini, and Ferdinand Bruneti√®re. N. Petra»ôcu's articles of the time show him to be speaking out against the \\"destructive criticism\\" of Maiorescu and his supporters, arguing that Junimea had sought to marginalize all other voices. He condemned Maiorescu for his belief that a Romanian work could only expect to impose itself if it was of equal value to its foreign counterparts. For Petra»ôcu, this guideline, known as \\"autonomy of the aesthetics\\", was equivalent to cosmopolitanism, and unrealistic in its expectations (he thought Romanian literature was \\"at a primitive phase\\"). As the author himself recorded in his memoirs, he had first expressed moderate criticism of Maiorescu's positions in his 1893 study.Ornea, p.128-129, 340 According to Petra»ôcu, the elder critic replied saying: \\"My opinion is that this [new school of criticism], toward which I see you are inclined, can only be a passing trend, since it only deals with secondary issues, such as the social environment.\\" N. Petra»ôcu expanded on this difference of opinions: \\"I realized, for instance, that [Maiorescu's opinion] about talent being one and the same, be it born in the forest, be it born in Paris or Berlin, be it living in our time, be it living during the Renaissance, was not an allowable opinion. Just as well, and even more so, the idea that the literary work resides in the beauty of shapes and that the substance, that is to say the thoughts it comprises, has no importance, was also an unjust opinion.\\" Like Vlahu»õƒÉ, he called on Junimea to tone down its \\"violent\\" discourse and adopt an \\"honest, helpful and proper criticism\\". Such arguments mirrored those of Dobrogeanu-Gherea, which had first surfaced during an earlier and longer polemic between him and Maiorescu, but were generally harsher in tone.Ornea, p.92, 119 Convorbiri Literare answered through this attack through the intervention of its editor, the philosopher P. P. Negulescu. Negulescu pointed out that, in accusing Junimea of having failed to support young writers, Petra»ôcu had overlooked the encouragements Maiorescu had given to Eminescu, Co»ôbuc, and Samson BodnƒÉrescu; he also argued that the society had not awarded any form of special treatment to its own affiliates. Additionally, Negulescu contradicted Petra»ôcu's historicist views on national specificity, assessing that the idea was not confirmed by science, and that it was itself a new and foreign conceptOrnea, p.87 (stating that Taine was \\"hard to take into consideration as an authority on the matter\\"). However, in his analysis, Negulescu refrained from refuting the theories themselves, and instead argued in favor of a middle path between them and Junimism.Ornea, p.87, 89, 92 In 1895, further criticism of N. Petra»ôcu was voiced by Mihail Dragomirescu, who was still a supporter of the literary group: Dragomirescu indirectly assimilated both Dobrogeanu-Gherea and Petra»ôcu with various known detractors of Eminescu, such as Aron Densu»ôianu and Alexandru Grama (in his review of the article, Ornea indicated that this was done \\"abusively\\").Ornea, p.346 =Later years= 2014 photo of Petra»ôcu's house in Bucharest, Pia»õa RomanƒÉ, nr. 1, designed by Ion Mincu Several years after his polemic with Negulescu, Petra»ôcu acknowledged the importance of Junimea, and, in 1899, his magazine defined Maiorescu as \\"a superior man from several points of view\\". He also spoke of the critic as an inspiration, which, he argued, was still evident despite \\"the different road\\" adopted by LiteraturƒÉ »ôi ArtƒÉ Rom√¢nƒÉ. On the occasion of Maiorescu's 60th year of activity, Petra»ôcu cited him, Dobrogeanu-Gherea and his friend Anghel Demetriescu as the main representatives of Romanian literary criticism. He was nonetheless still critical of Maiorescu's \\"autonomy of the aesthetics\\" and his inflexibility in relation to \\"scientific criticism\\". Demetriescu and N. Petra»ôcu were hosts to an intellectual circle which also included the architect Ion Mincu, the physician Constantin Istrati, the writer Barbu »òtefƒÉnescu-Delavrancea, and the physicist »òtefan Hepites.Perpessicius, \\"Tabel cronologic\\", in Mateiu Caragiale, Craii de Curtea-Veche, Editura pentru LiteraturƒÉ, Bucharest, 1965, p.XVII. For a while before 1902, they were probably joined by Demetriescu's young pupil Mateiu Caragiale, the son of dramatist Ion Luca Caragiale and himself a future novelist. Among his collaborators at LiteraturƒÉ »ôi ArtƒÉ Rom√¢nƒÉ was Gala Galaction, a writer and Romanian Orthodox theologian, whose lengthy correspondence with Petra»ôcu was uncovered and analyzed by the literary critic I. E. Torou»õiuPerpessicius, Studii..., p.34 (who also published and commented Petra»ôcu's autobiography).Ornea, p.129 Among N. Petra»ôcu's final works was his essay on the life and work of Anghel Demetriescu (published by Tipografia Bucovina company and undated), where he notably provides quotes on his friend's old age nostalgia and eccentric projects.Ion Vianu, Investiga»õii mateine, Biblioteca Apostrof & Polirom, Cluj-Napoca & Ia»ôi, 2008, p.52-53. ; In 1929, Petra»ôcu also authored a monograph on Duiliu Zamfirescu. Literary critic Perpessicius argued that the work had \\"volubility\\", \\"sense of the picturesque\\" and \\"critical intuition\\".Perpessicius, Studii..., p.35 Marin Gelea Building on his sociological theories, Petra»ôcu postulated that there was a contrast between the men of genius and the expectations of the local public. He believed that \\"All the Romanian talents have been deviated or defeated by our society, most of them in the flower of their youth and manhood, when they did not yet have time to lend their power to full measure\\". Among the creative people he cited where Mincu, Eminescu, Zamfirescu, Dobrogeanu-Gherea, »òtefƒÉnescu-Delavrancea, Ion Luca Caragiale, Vlahu»õƒÉ, as well as the writer Ioan Slavici and the visual artists Nicolae Grigorescu and Ion Georgescu. This theme is a characteristic trait in Marin Gelea, where the eponymous hero, an architect, faces the moods of his public and ultimately fails to adjust to local culture. George CƒÉlinescu proposed that the protagonist was actually Petra»ôcu's good friend Mincu, and noted that the name used in the book may have been based on that of a real-life participant in the 1907 Peasants' Revolt. The critic also argued that the novel had been heavily influenced by Zamfirescu, and noted that the two authors shared \\"a moralizing and patriotic attitude\\", a sympathy for the landowners and peasants, and a distaste for the middle class and people of foreign origin (\\"the superposed stratum\\", depicted as corrupting).CƒÉlinescu, p.541 Unlike Zamfirescu, CƒÉlinescu suggested, N. Petra»ôcu had little sympathy for high society, seeing as \\"lacking in national sentiment and any contact with the country's tradition\\". Gelea, who completes his studies abroad, returns to Romania \\"imbued with all talents and all virtues, having his will set on raising the artistic level of his country\\", and ready to react against all things he perceives as frivolous. He falls in love with \\"the young widow Olga Lari\\" and then with \\"the daughter of a country boyar, innocent but ailing\\". He marries the latter, and she heals with support from Gelea. In the process, as CƒÉlinescu puts it, the architect becomes \\"a jaded person, one would say a failure\\". A particularly important episode involves Marin Gelea's participation in a contest to design the Romanian Metropolitan Palace, and his subsequent rejection by the jury. George CƒÉlinescu was highly critical of the novel and of Petra»ôcu's techniques, accusing the writer of lacking in \\"creative force\\", and his character of \\"analytical plainness\\" which resulted in \\"interminable speeches\\". CƒÉlinescu notably proposed that the author had failed to profit from the more interesting circumstances of his novel, and, instead of depicting \\"the universal snobbery\\" of his lifetime, resorted to an \\"excessively idealist criticism\\". CƒÉlinescu also commented on the artistic ideals expressed by Gelea (and, through him, by the author), indicating that, to a \\"cultured reader\\", these could only signify \\"platitudes\\". To illustrate this, he cited two of Gelea's monologues. One showed the character commenting on an \\"ideal\\" poem, \\"filled with the promises of a serene and mighty future [...], alive and powerful, and branding with a hot iron the weaknesses and miseries of this day and of life in these times.\\" The other showed Gelea outraged that young women actors had agreed to partake in a vulgar theater production, and commenting on the nature and role of female beauty and behavior: \\"[...] the treasure of virginal beauty which bestows something angelic upon women, the modesty, the chastity, the shyness, were all blown away in a single evening\\". Reviewing Gelea's fictional designs for the Metropolitan Palace and his subsequent frustration, CƒÉlinescu argued that Petra»ôcu had in fact expanded on a \\"false theme\\"‚Äîin his view, if Gelea is a person of genius, he ought to have seen past such impediments. He concluded that the novel's only value resided in its \\"historical interest\\". Among the covert references to various cultural figures of the day, Marin Gelea includes a portrayal of Ion Luca Caragiale, one of the first in literature (see also Ion Luca Caragiale's cultural legacy).»òerban Cioculescu, Caragialiana, Editura Eminescu, Bucharest, 1974, p.316.

It was founded in September 2001 to directly lobby the goals of the American Cancer Society, which is subject to restrictions on advocacy activities because of its tax classification. ACS CAN works to make cancer a national priority. Specifically, it advocates for better access to care, cancer prevention and early detection programs, cancer research funding, regulation of tobacco by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, better quality of life for cancer patients, and attempts to raise awareness of and reduce cancer disparities. Members include cancer survivors, caregivers, patients, volunteers, and students, including Colleges Against Cancer.  Campaigns  ACS CAN's advocacy efforts are targeted at specific cancer-related issues. =Access to healthcare= Like the American Cancer Society, ACS CAN is devoting a significant portion of its resources to raising public awareness of shortcomings in the US health care system from the perspective of cancer patients. Recently, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, supported by the American Cancer Society and ACS CAN, was signed into law by President Barack Obama and has multiple provisions which will gradually take effect over several years. Under the Affordable Care Act, patients are protected from discrimination by insurance companies against people with pre-existing conditions, such as cancer, and insurance companies can no longer drop a person if he or she gets sick. These provisions ultimately reduce cost burden on patients and their families. Further, the law prohibits companies from denying coverage to children with pre-existing conditions, eliminates lifetime benefit limits and annual benefit limits that can cause sudden termination of health care coverage, and allows children to stay on their parent‚Äôs health plan until the age of 26. Also, if a person has been uninsured for at least 6 months and have a health condition, he or she may be eligible for the Pre- existing Condition Insurance Plan. Seniors also will receive many preventative services for free such as cancer screenings. According to the ACS CAN, these rulings will expand access to quality health care for cancer patients, decrease cost burden, and refocus health care emphasis on prevention. =Cancer research funding= The US government is the largest funder of cancer research via the National Institutes of Health (NIH), Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), yet recent budgets have not provided for increases that make up for increases in medical inflation. The recent failure of the United States Congress Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction to come to an agreement about federal budget cuts has caused ACS CAN and other health advocates to fear reduction in services and investment in biomedical research through the NIH. Reduction in NIH funding may lead to lower chances of cancer research breakthroughs and interrupt clinical trials at the National Cancer Institute, according to ACS CAN vice president of federal relations and strategic alliances, Dick Woodruff. =Tobacco regulation= ACS CAN supports efforts to grant the Food and Drug Administration regulatory control over tobacco products. Their efforts include tobacco use prevention and cessation programs, increasing tobacco taxes, and enacting smoke-free laws. ACS CAN states that tobacco use prevention, especially in a ‚Äúnew generation of young smokers‚Äù would be the most effective way to reduce exposure to smoke and reduce health risks, including lung cancer. However, states have recently cut funding for tobacco use prevention programs by 12 percent this year, adding up to a 36 percent funding cut over the past four years. Under the 1998 Tobacco Master Settlement Agreement, states are to receive $246 billion in tobacco industry payments from tobacco companies to compensate for smoking-related health care costs over 25 years. In the Fiscal Year 2012, states will collect $25.6 billion in revenue in tobacco taxes and legal settlements from the 1998 settlement. However, only $45.6 million, or 1.8 percent of that collection will be spent on programs to prevent or stop tobacco use. The CDC recommends $3.7 billion for tobacco cessation and prevention programs, meaning that the allotted $45.6 million is only 12 percent of the recommendation. Of the 50 states, 33 states and the District of Columbia are spending less than a quarter of the recommended amount. Connecticut, Nevada, New Hampshire, Ohio, and the District of Columbia did not allocate any funding for tobacco prevention programs this year. Only Alaska is meeting or exceeding its CDC recommendation for the year by spending $10.8 million. Recently the organization has made a major push against E-Cigarettes. There is currently no research which links E-Cigarettes and cancer.http://www.acscan.org/content/media-center/fda-takes-long-awaited- first-step-to-regulate-cigars-e-cigs-and-other-tobacco-products/ =National Breast and Cervical Cancer Early Detection Program (NBCCEDP)= ACS CAN actively seeks additional funds for the NBCCEDP, which provides breast and cervical cancer screenings for low-income women throughout the United States. The program, started in 1991, is administered by the CDC and in addition to breast and cervical cancer screenings, it provides follow-up services and information to low-income women between 50 and 64 who are at most risk to breast and cervical cancer. This includes uninsured, underinsured, and racial and ethnic minority women. Services provided under NBCCEDP include clinical breast examinations, mammograms, pap smears, pelvic examinations, diagnostic testing for abnormal results, and treatment referrals. Since 1991, the program has provided more than 9.8 million breast and cervical cancer screenings, and diagnosed more than 52,694 breast cancers, 2,856 invasive cervical cancers, and 136,837 premalignant cervical lesions. ACS CAN works to reauthorize and increase funding for NBCCEDP since it has been at risk for recent budget cuts. Although NBCCEDP has served over 3.9 million women, the program serves less than one in five eligible women at the current funding levels. Some states have been forced to reject people who would be eligible for free mammograms and Pap smears due to state budget cuts. In 2009, 14 states cut budgets for free cancer screenings: Colorado, Minnesota, Connecticut, South Carolina, Utah, Missouri, Washington, Ohio, Massachusetts, Arkansas, Montana, Illinois, Pennsylvania, and Alabama.l In 2006, Senators Barbara Mikulski and Kay Bailey Hutchison introduced a bill, supported by ACS CAN, to allow for greater program flexibility and a funding increase of $45 million allowing an additional 130,000 eligible women access to NBCCEDP. In 2007, President George W. Bush reauthorized NBCCEDP, setting the fiscal year 2010 funding level at $250 million, but Congress provided $215 million. Further, NBCCEDP faces a 10 percent cut in the CDC budget, resulting in 40,000 fewer underserved women being screened. =Judicial Advocacy Initiative= ACS CAN and ACS file \\"friend of the court\\" briefs in cases that may affect the cancer community. =Plant It Pink= ACS CAN‚Äôs campaign, ‚ÄúPlant It Pink,‚Äù aims to raise awareness of the fight against breast cancer and to raise funds by planting thousands of Pink Impression tulip bulbs around America. Several states have participated in this event including Illinois, Iowa, Minnesota, Kansas, Missouri, Nebraska, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Dakota, and Wisconsin. The goal is to plant Pink Impression bulbs throughout the states to honor the men and women who will be diagnosed with cancer this year. 800 Pink Impression tulip bulbs were planted in the shape of a 20-foot long ribbon at Ingalls Cancer Care Center in Tinley Park, Illinois by Ingalls Cancer Research Ambassadors. The tulip bulbs were planted in the fall and are expected to bloom this spring.  Events  Each year, ACS CAN hosts a training and lobbying event in Washington, D.C.for top tier volunteers called Leadership Summit & Lobby Day. More than 500 volunteers and staff meet with their lawmakers during this event to talk about cancer issues. In 2002 and 2006, ACS CAN hosted massive lobbying events in Washington, D.C. called Celebration on the Hill. In 2002 and 2006, they hosted 4,000 and 10,000 cancer patients, survivors and advocates as part of this event, respectively. In 2006 ACS CAN successfully met with the office of every member of the United States Congress, an unprecedented achievement for a nonprofit health organization. Attendees were treated to live music, public speakers, and a host of onsite activities, as well as the erection of the American Cancer Society Wall of Hope, a temporary monument to cancer survivorship that covered two city blocks.  Publicity  On November 6, 2011, ACS CAN premiered its second-ever national television ad on Meet the Press to ask Congress to remember the lives lost to cancer and the 12 million cancer survivors living in America today. ACS CAN produced the ad to bring attention to Congress to make cancer a national priority when addressing the country‚Äôs budget deficit. The ad features the Wall of Hope which was created during ACS CAN‚Äôs Celebration on the Hill in 2006. The wall held 1,584 sticky notes with messages from people across America to their loved ones who have battled cancer. The 30-second TV ad is part of a larger national grassroots campaign to protect federal funding for cancer research at the National Institutes of Health and the National Cancer Institute. Along with protecting funding for cancer research, the ad and campaign strive to maintain funding for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention‚Äôs programs that promote prevention and early detection of cancer, and laws and programs that expand access to affordable health care. ACS CAN‚Äôs national TV ad will be aired on major cable networks such as CNN, Fox News Channel, and MSNBC in November and December as Congress and the Super Committee meet to address ways to reduce federal spending.  Staff  Gary M. Reedy is the chief executive officer of the American Cancer Society and the American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network. The President of ACS CAN is Christopher W. Hansen.

The Baptist drilling rig can be built in any ordinary arc welding workshop and materials for a basic version costs about 150 US dollars (2006 prices). In suitable conditions, boreholes over 100 m deep have been drilled with this method. History The method was developed by Terry Waller, a North American Baptist missionary in Africa and Bolivia. It applies some of the same principles used in mechanized commercial well drilling, but does so using the simplest, most available and cheapest possible materials. Social / development context Rural people in developing countries often cannot afford to have specialists drill or dig wells for them. This method was developed to provide poor people with a way to help themselves with their water supply. A Baptist drilling rig, fit to drill holes up to deep, can be built in Nicaragua for about US $150. This includes all essential non-common tools to operate it. Its core element, the drill bits, can be made in about any arc-welding workshop, using only scrap steel and materials that can be found in virtually any hardware store. Once the well is drilled, it is cased with an inexpensive PVC tube. Fitting the well with a slab of concrete as a sanitary seal and a simple PVC piston pump (also built by the users themselves) will cost about 2.5 dollars per meter well depth. Suitable conditions A hybrid between sludging and percussion drilling, this method permits to drill through all kinds of loose alluvial soils, sands, silts and clays, as well as ‚Äúsoft‚Äù rocks, like light conglomerates, consolidated volcanic ashes, some calcareous rocks and weathered materials. It will not penetrate hard igneous rock or boulders (e.g. in ancient river beds). Technical specifications Like in sludging, the drilling process is continuous: the drill bit is normally not removed from the borehole until it is finished and the broken-up material is pumped to the surface in the drilling liquid (mud). But instead of using a hand as a valve on top of the drill pipe (sludging), the drill bit itself doubles as a foot-valve. The operator‚Äôs hand does not have to reach the end of the drill pipe and drill stem extensions can be several meters long. Percussion action is performed by lifting the drill stem with a rope over a pulley, attached to a simple derrick, made with locally available materials, such as wood or bamboo poles. The borehole diameter is kept as small as possible in order to remove a minimum of material and hence advance rapidly. The standard drill bit is based on water pipe fittings and unless a larger diameter is required, the borehole is cased with PVC pipe. The main drill tool consists of a length of metal pipe with a bit/valve. Extensions are standard PVC potable water pipes. No temporary casing is used. The borehole being kept full of mud and the ‚Äúcaking‚Äù of mud into any unstable sand layers, as a consequence of the percussion action and friction of the smooth lateral edges of the bit, is normally sufficient to stabilize it. The drilling mud is evacuated from the borehole after casing the well by pouring or injecting water into the casing, called backwashing. This technique adapts best to sand, loam and light rock. The standard drill bits also work through sticky and even consolidated clays. Nevertheless, best results in varying conditions are obtained with an array of different bits: * Movable point bits for general purpose and clay-holding soils: the moving stem of the heavy dart helps to keep the foot valve clean. * Fixed point bits for sandy and rocky layers, where there is no risk for sticky material to obstruct the foot valve. * Open-ended (hollow) bits without a foot valve (pure sludging) for layers of pure clay or gravel. In these conditions the presence of a foot valve may slow down progress, since clay has to be pounded into suspension and stones have to be ground to small pieces in order to enter the drilling tool through the foot valve. Reaming If required, the upper part of the well can be reamed and cased with larger diameter pipe (3 or 5 inches), to accommodate larger pumps. A shallow (large diameter) rope pump, for example, may require a wider well and submersible pumps commonly need at least 4\\". Note that there is no need to enlarge the entire depth of the borehole: reaming until slightly below the lowest expected water table (the pump's water intake) is sufficient.

The College is affiliated to Kerala University of Health Sciences since 2010. It was affiliated with the University of Calicut till 2010. The facility also includes an on-site hospital.  History  The college was founded in 1976. It was first situated in Karaparamba, Kozhikode, acquiring a mansion that belonged to the manager of the Pearce Leslie Cashew Factory during the British Raj. The present college building was later constructed in the same area. The original mansion, which was used for many years, was demolished in 2002.  Programmes offered  The college provides graduate and post graduate courses in Homoeopathy. The graduate course is a Bachelor of Homoeopathic Medicine and Surgery(BHMS). BHMS is a five-and-half-year course with a one-year internship. Post-graduate courses offered include MD(Homeo) in various specialties. The courses are conducted under the auspices of the University of Calicut and are standardized by regulations of the governing body, the Central Council of Homoeopathy, India.  Hospital  The attached hospital has 125 beds and eight out patient sections. There is a minor operating theater, physiotherapy section and multigym in the hospital. The pain and palliative care unit for terminally ill patients consists of a ward with ten beds. The critical care unit has 10 beds for seriously ill patients.  Ceremonies  Silver Jubilee of the college was celebrated in 2000‚Äì2001 academic year. There was a medical exhibition, and cultural activities. The first proper Graduation ceremony was conducted in GHMC Kozhikode for graduating interns of 2006, named Aumentare 06 - The Rising. The interns received scrolls inscribed with a modified Hippocratic oath and the Hahnemannian Oath, and were sworn in as Homoeopaths. The program was conducted by the Intern Doctors Association of the college and hosted by the College Union. The Advocate Syndicate member of the University of Calicut was the chief guest, and Dr. Haroon Ashraf, Secretary to the Intern Doctors Association, presented the reply speech. There after the ceremony is conducted every year. GHMC hosted Yuva 08, Inter Medical College Festival in 2008.

Gao Zhizhou was born in 602, during the reign of Emperor Wen of Sui, the founding emperor of Tang's predecessor Sui Dynasty. His family was from what would become Chang Prefecture (Â∏∏Â∑û, roughly modern Changzhou, Jiangsu). He was said to have been studious in his youth and, after passing the imperial examination, served as the county magistrate of Fei County (Ë≤ªÁ∏£, in modern Linyi, Shandong). As his salary was higher than those of the sheriff and the secretary general of the county, he shared his salary evenly with them. He was also said to be a capable county magistrate, and the people and subordinate officials carved a stone monument in his honor. Eventually, during the reign of Emperor Gaozong, he was made an imperial scholar and participated in the creation of the literary works Yaoshan Yucai () and Wenguan Cilin (), headed by Emperor Gaozong's crown prince Li Hong. Further, he and two other officials, He Kai () and Wang Zhenru (), assisted in Li Hong's studies. In 668, he took a vacation home to bury his parents, and when he reached home, he commented to his relatives, \\"Knowing how to advance but not how to retreat is the way to disaster.\\" He thereafter, claiming an illness, resigned. Gao was subsequently recalled to serve as the prefect of Shou Prefecture (Â£ΩÂ∑û, roughly modern Lu'an, Anhui). He was said to be gracious and forgiving in his rule, and the people appreciated it. Whenever he went out to visit the towns, he would first summon the local teachers and students to see how the students were doing in their studies and their understanding of current affairs, before he would move on to the matters of agriculture and law. In 671, he was recalled to the central government to serve as imperial consultant and acting deputy minister of ceremonies. In 676, he was serving as Huangmen Shilang (), the deputy head of the examination bureau of government (ÈñÄ‰∏ãÁúÅ, Menxia Sheng), when he was given the designation Tong Zhongshu Menxia Sanpin (), making him a chancellor de facto. He was also in charge of editing imperial histories. In 677, he was also made a member of the staff of Li Hong's younger brother Li Xian, now crown prince after Li Hong's death in 675. In 679, however, he became imperial censor and was no longer chancellor. In 680, when Li Xian, who had by now lost the favor of Emperor Gaozong's powerful wife Empress Wu (later known as Wu Zetian), was accused of plotting treason, Gao, along with the chancellors Xue Yuanchao and Pei Yan, were in charge of the investigations, and Li Xian was found guilty, deposed, and exiled. Gao, by this point, had repeatedly requested to retire, and Emperor Gaozong granted the retirement request. He died in 683 and was given posthumous honors and the posthumous name Ding (ÂÆö, \\"considerate\\").

A Biographical Dictionary of Musicians (3rd Edition). New York: Schirmer. P.974. Biography Varlamov was born in Moscow in 1801. He was a choirboy at the court in St. Petersburg from 1811, and studied under its director, Dmitry Bortniansky. He left the court in 1818 and served as director of the Russian Ambassador's chapel choir in The Hague from 1819 to 1823. Returning to St. Petersburg later that year, he taught singing intermittently for the remainder of his life, and also was the kapellmeister for the Moscow Imperial Theater from 1832 to 1844. Varlamov‚Äôs creativity coincided with the formation of the Russian lyrical songs. In those years the Moscow Imperial troupe became the center of development of Russian lyrical songs (Petersburg Imperial troupe has approached the Emperor and his officials, there was a lot of semi-official music). In theaters in Moscow (the Bolshoi Theatre and the Malyi Theatre) were not only performances, and concerts of songs took place. Alexander Varlamov often took part in concerts and performed his songs himself. He died in St. Petersburg in 1848. He is the father of Russian actor Konstantin Varlamov. He is the great-grandfather of composer Alexander Vladimirovich Varlamov. Among Varlamov's compositions are two ballets, incidental music, piano pieces, and songs. Between 1861 and 1864 a Complete Works edition of his music was published in St. Petersburg under the title Polnoye sobraniye sochineniy. Perhaps his best known work - although it is not as well known that he wrote it - is the song The Red Sarafan. This is often assumed to be a genuine folk song.

Some examples of Nash functions: *Polynomial and regular rational functions are Nash functions. *x\\\\mapsto \\\\sqrt{1+x^2} is Nash on R. *the function which associates to a real symmetric matrix its i-th eigenvalue (in increasing order) is Nash on the open subset of symmetric matrices with no multiple eigenvalue. Nash functions are those functions needed in order to have an implicit function theorem in real algebraic geometry. Nash manifolds Along with Nash functions one defines Nash manifolds, which are semialgebraic analytic submanifolds of some Rn. A Nash mapping between Nash manifolds is then an analytic mapping with semialgebraic graph. Nash functions and manifolds are named after John Forbes Nash, Jr., who proved (1952) that any compact smooth manifold admits a Nash manifold structure, i.e., is diffeomorphic to some Nash manifold. More generally, a smooth manifold admits a Nash manifold structure if and only if it is diffeomorphic to the interior of some compact smooth manifold possibly with boundary. Nash's result was later (1973) completed by Alberto Tognoli who proved that any compact smooth manifold is diffeomorphic to some affine real algebraic manifold; actually, any Nash manifold is Nash diffeomorphic to an affine real algebraic manifold. These results exemplify the fact that the Nash category is somewhat intermediate between the smooth and the algebraic categories. Local properties The local properties of Nash functions are well understood. The ring of germs of Nash functions at a point of a Nash manifold of dimension n is isomorphic to the ring of algebraic power series in n variables (i.e., those series satisfying a nontrivial polynomial equation), which is the henselization of the ring of germs of rational functions. In particular, it is a regular local ring of dimension n. Global properties The global properties are more difficult to obtain. The fact that the ring of Nash functions on a Nash manifold (even noncompact) is noetherian was proved independently (1973) by Jean-Jacques Risler and Gustave Efroymson. Nash manifolds have properties similar to but weaker than Cartan's theorems A and B on Stein manifolds. Let \\\\mathcal{N} denote the sheaf of Nash function germs on a Nash manifold M, and \\\\mathcal{I} be a coherent sheaf of \\\\mathcal{N}-ideals. Assume \\\\mathcal{I} is finite, i.e., there exists a finite open semialgebraic covering \\\\\\\\{U_i\\\\\\\\} of M such that, for each i, \\\\mathcal{I}_{U_i} is generated by Nash functions on U_i. Then \\\\mathcal{I} is globally generated by Nash functions on M, and the natural map :::H^0(M,\\\\mathcal{N}) \\\\to H^0(M,\\\\mathcal{N}/\\\\mathcal{I}) is surjective. However :::H^1(M,\\\\mathcal{N}) eq 0, \\\\ \\\\text{if} \\\\ \\\\dim(M) > 0, contrarily to the case of Stein manifolds. Generalizations Nash functions and manifolds can be defined over any real closed field instead of the field of real numbers, and the above statements still hold. Abstract Nash functions can also be defined on the real spectrum of any commutative ring.  Sources  #J. Bochnak, M. Coste and M-F. Roy: Real algebraic geometry. Springer, 1998. #M. Coste, J.M.
