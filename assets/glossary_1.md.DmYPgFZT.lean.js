She had an older brother, Raymond, and a younger brother, Frank.1900 United States Federal Census She was raised on a rural homestead just below the bluffs of the Mississippi River along the western edge of Davenport, Iowa. This property had been bought by her paternal great-grandfather James Glaspell from the federal government following its Black Hawk Purchase.Ben-Zvi, Linda (2005). Susan Glaspell: Her Life and Times. Oxford University Press, pp. 13 Having a fairly conservative upbringing, \\"Susie\\" was remembered as \\"a precocious child\\" who would often rescue stray animals.Ben-Zvi, p. 25. As the family farm increasingly became surrounded by residential development, Glaspell's worldview was still shaped by the pioneer tales of her grandmother. She told of regular visits by Indians to the farm in the years before Iowa statehood.Ben-Zvi, p. 5. Growing up directly across the river from Black Hawk's ancestral village, Glaspell was also influenced by the Sauk leader's autobiography; he wrote that Americans should be worthy inheritors of the land. During the Panic of 1893, her father sold the farm, and the family moved into Davenport.Ben-Zvi, p. 17. Glaspell, circa 1883. Glaspell was an accomplished student in the city's public schools, taking an advanced course of study and giving a commencement speech at her 1894 graduation. By age eighteen she was earning a regular salary as a journalist for a local newspaper. By twenty, she wrote a weekly 'Society' column that lampooned Davenport's upper class.Ben-Zvi, p. 30. At twenty-one Glaspell enrolled at Drake University, against the local belief that college made women unfit for marriage.Ben-Zvi, p. 35. A philosophy major, she excelled in male-dominated debate competitions, winning the right to represent Drake at the state debate tournament her senior year.Ben-Zvi, p. 37. A Des Moines Daily News article on her graduation ceremony cited Glaspell as \\"a leader in the social and intellectual life of the university.\\"Ben-Zvi, p. 28. The day after graduation, Glaspell began working full-time for the Des Moines paper as a reporter, a rare position for a woman, particularly as she was assigned to cover the state legislature and murder cases.Ben-Zvi, p. 38. After covering the conviction of a woman accused of murdering her abusive husband, Glaspell abruptly resigned at age twenty-four. She moved back to Davenport to focus on writing fiction.Ben-Zvi, p. 47. Unlike many new writers, she readily had her stories accepted and was published by the most widely read periodicals,Ben-Zvi, p. 51. including Harper's, Munsey's, Ladies' Home Journal, and Woman's Home Companion. It was a golden age of short stories. She used a large cash prize from a short story magazine to finance her move to Chicago, where she wrote her first novel, The Glory of the Conquered, published in 1909. It was a best- seller, and The New York Times declared, > \\"Unless Susan Glaspell is an assumed name covering that of some already > well-known author—and the book has qualities so out of the ordinary in > American fiction and so individual that this does not seem likely—The Glory > of the Conquered brings forward a new author of fine and notable gifts.\\"Ben- > Zvi, p. 98. Glaspell published her second novel, The Visioning, in 1911. The New York Times said of the book, \\"it does prove Miss Glaspell's staying power, her possession of abilities that put her high among the ranks of American storytellers.\\"Ben-Zvi, p. 113. Her third novel, Fidelity, was published in 1915. The New York Times described it as \\"a big and real contribution to American novels.\\"Ben-Zvi, p. 159. Theatre Glaspell and husband George Cram Cook in 1917 While in Davenport, Glaspell associated with other local writers to form the Davenport group. Among them was George Cram Cook, who was teaching English literature at the University of Iowa. He was from a wealthy family and also was a gentleman farmer. Though he was already in his second, troubled marriage, Glaspell fell in love with him. He divorced and they wed in 1913. To escape Davenport's disapproving gossip and seek a larger artistic world, Glaspell and Cook moved to New York City's Greenwich Village. There they became key participants in America's first avant-garde artistic movement, and associated with many of the era's most well-known social reformers and activists, including Upton Sinclair, Emma Goldman, and John Reed. Glaspell became a leading member of Heterodoxy, an early feminist debating group composed of the premier women's rights crusaders. After a series of miscarriages, she underwent surgery to remove a fibroid tumor. Along with many others of their artistic circles, Glaspell and Cook went to Provincetown, Massachusetts, on Cape Cod, for the summer of 1915, where they rented a cottage. Although still weak from surgery, Glaspell worked with Cook and friends to start an experimental theatre company, a \\"creative collective\\". They produced their first plays in a refurbished fishing wharf arranged for by another member of their group. What became known as the Provincetown Playhouse would be devoted to creating and producing artistic plays to reflect contemporary American issues. The Players rejected the more commercial and escapist melodramas produced on Broadway. Despite the successes of her earlier fiction, Glaspell would be most remembered for the twelve groundbreaking plays she submitted to the company over the next seven years. Her first play, Trifles (1916), was based on the murder trial she had covered as a young reporter in Des Moines. Today considered an early feminist masterpiece, it was an instant success, riveting audiences with its daring views of justice and morality. It has since become one of the most anthologized works in American theatre history. In 1921 she completed Inheritors; following three generations of a pioneer family, it is perhaps America's first modern historical drama. This same year she also finished The Verge, one of the earliest American works of expressionist art. Believing an amateur staff would lead to increased innovation, the Provincetown playwrights often participated directly in the production of their own plays. Though untrained, Glaspell received further acclaim as an actress. William Zorach, an early member of the group, reported \\"she had only to be on the stage and the play and the audience came alive.\\" Jacques Copeau, a legendary French theatre director and critic, was moved to tears by a Glaspell performance. He described her as \\"a truly great actress.\\"Helen Deutsch and Stella Hanau, The Provincetown: A Story of the Theatre (New York: Farrar & Rinehart, 1931), pp. 24-25. The original Provincetown Theater While considering new plays to produce, Glaspell discovered Eugene O'Neill, who would eventually be recognized as one of the greatest playwrights in American history. Other notables associated with the group include Edna St. Vincent Millay, Theodore Dreiser, and Floyd Dell, Glaspell's friend from the Davenport group. After their first two seasons in Provincetown, the Players moved their theater to New York City. As the company became more successful, playwrights began to view it as a means to get picked up by other, more commercial theatre venues, a violation of the group's original purpose. Cook and Glaspell decided to leave the company they founded, which had become 'too successful'. Glaspell was by now at the height of her theatre career, with her most recent play, The Verge, bringing the most praise. In 1922 Glaspell and Cook moved to Delphi, Greece. Cook died there in 1924 of glanders, an infectious disease he caught from his dog. From the onset, Glaspell's plays were also published in print form, receiving laudatory reviews by New York's most prestigious periodicals. By 1918 Glaspell was already considered one of America's most significant new playwrights. In 1920 her plays began to be printed in England by the highly reputable British publisher, Small & Maynard. She was even better received there. English critics hailed her as a genius and ranked her above O'Neill. They compared her favorably to Henrik Ibsen, whom they ranked as the most important playwright since Shakespeare. To satisfy demand for Glaspell's writing, a British version of her novel Fidelity was published, going through five editions in five weeks. When Inheritors was produced for England in 1925, every leading newspaper and literary magazine published an extensive review, most unanimous in their praise. One enthusiastic reviewer claimed, \\"this play will live when Liverpool is a rubbish heap.\\" However, the influence and critical success of Glaspell's plays did not translate into financial gain. In order to support herself and her husband during their years with the theater, Glaspell continued to submit short stories to top periodicals for publication. Literary scholars consider the stories from this period to be her finest. It was during her productive time as a playwright that Glaspell also established herself as \\"a central figure in the development of the modern American short story.\\" Later career WPA production of Alison's House, for which Glaspell won the Pulitzer Prize for Drama. Glaspell returned to Cape Cod after Cook's death, where she wrote a well-received biography and tribute to her late husband, The Road to the Temple (1927). During the late twenties, she was romantically involved with the younger writer Norman H. Matson. In this period she wrote three best-selling novels, which she considered personal favorites: Brook Evans (1928), Fugitive's Return (1929), and Ambrose Holt and Family (1931). She also wrote the play Alison's House (1930), for which she was awarded the Pulitzer Prize in 1931. In 1932 Glaspell's relationship with Matson ended after eight years. She fell into her first and only period of low productivity as she struggled with depression, alcoholism, and poor health. In 1936 Glaspell moved to Chicago after being appointed Midwest Bureau Director of the Federal Theater Project during the Great Depression. Over the next few years, she reconnected with siblings and regained control of her drinking and creativity. Glaspell returned to Cape Cod when her work for the Federal Theater Project was finished. Her years in the Midwest influenced her work. Her last three novels increasingly focused on the region, family life, and theistic questions. They included The Morning is Near Us (1939), Norma Ashe (1942), and Judd Rankin's Daughter (1945). Susan Glaspell died of viral pneumonia in Provincetown on July 28, 1948. Legacy Glaspell was highly regarded in her time, and was well known as a Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright. Her short stories were regularly printed in the era's top periodicals, and her New York Times obituary states that she was \\"one of the nation's most widely-read novelists.\\" In 1940 a new generation of influential Broadway-based critics began publishing derogatory reviews of her plays, having a sizable effect on her long-term standing. Exacerbating the issue was Glaspell's reluctance to seek publicity and her tendency to downplay her own accomplishments, perhaps a result of her modest Midwestern upbringing. In addition, Glaspell's idealistic novels of strong and independent female protagonists were less popular in the post-war era, which stressed female domesticity. Her novels fell out of print after her death. Accordingly, in the United States her work was seriously neglected for many years. Internationally, she received some attention by scholars, who were primarily interested in her more experimental work from the Provincetown years. In the late 1970s feminist critics began to reevaluate Glaspell's career,Bach, Gerhard and Harris, Claudia (Mar., 1992). \\"Susan Glaspell: Rediscovering an American Playwright\\", Theatre Journal, Vol. 44, No. 1, pp. 94 and interest in her work has grown steadily ever since.Patricia L.

[\\"Review of the book 'Susan Glaspell: A Critical Biography'\\"], by Barbara Ozieblo, The Eugene O'Neill Review, Vol. 24, No. 1/2, pp. 139-141 Several book-length biographies and analyses of her writing have been published by university presses since the late 20th century. After nearly a century of being out of print, a large portion of her work has been republished. With major achievements in drama, novel, and short fiction, Glaspell is often cited as a \\"prime example\\" of an overlooked female writer deserving canonization.Ozieblo-Rajkowska, Barbara (1989). \\"The First Lady of American Drama: Susan Glaspell.\\" BELLS: Barcelona English Language and Literature Studies. 1, pp. 149-159. Perhaps the originator of modern American theater, Glaspell has been called \\"the First Lady of American Drama\\" and \\"the Mother of American Drama.\\" In 2003 the International Susan Glaspell Society was founded, with the aim of promoting \\"the recognition of Susan Glaspell as a major American dramatist and fiction writer.\\" Her plays are frequently performed by college and university theater departments, but she has become more widely known for her often-anthologized works: the one-act play Trifles, and its short-story adaptation, \\"A Jury of Her Peers\\". Since the late 20th century, these two pieces have become staples of theatre and Women's Studies curricula across the United States and the world. Recent productions In 1996 the Orange Tree Theatre in Richmond, London, began a long association with the plays of Susan Glaspell. Auriol Smith directed The Verge in 1996, one of the first of many plays by the American playwright to be performed at the theatre. The Mint Theater in New York City produced Alison's House in 1999 under the direction of Linda Ames Key. The Metropolitan Playhouse, a New York resident theater dedicated to exploring and re-vitalizing American literature and culture, staged Inheritors in 2005; the production was directed by Yvonne Opffer Conybeare. In his 2008 programmed note for Inheritors, Orange Tree director Sam Walters wrote: > In 1996... I felt we had rediscovered a really important writer. Now, > whenever I talk to American students, which I do quite often, I try my > 'Glaspell test'. I simply ask them if they have heard of her, and almost > always none of them have. Then I mention Trifles, and some realize they have > heard of that much-anthologized short play. So even in her own country she > is shamefully neglected. And when I type Glaspell on my computer it always > wants to change it to Gaskell. The Ontological Hysteric Incubator Arts project put on two plays by Glaspell, The Verge in 2009, directed by Alice Reagan; and Trifles in 2010, directed by Brooke O'Harra and Brendan Connelly. As of 2013 the theater has produced three of Glaspell's one-act plays and five of her full-length plays, including the first ever production of Glaspell's unpublished final play, Springs Eternal. In September 2015, celebrating the centenary of Provincetown Players, American Bard Theater Company presented a 12-hour celebration, featuring performances of 10 of Glaspell's plays in a single day. The San Diego State University School of Theatre, Television, and Film staged two one-act plays by Susan Glaspell in September and October 2018, Trifles (1916) and Women Horror (1918,) in a production directed by faculty member Randy Reinholz.

Initially it was known as the Pimlico Rifle Volunteer Corps. A year later it amalgamated with the Westminster Rifle Volunteers and became known as the Queen's Westminsters. Journal of the Society for Army Historical Research Vol. 82, No. 329 (Spring 2004), pp. 76-79 (4 pages) It was numbered 22nd Middlesex Rifle Volunteer Corps. In 1880 most London volunteer units were re-numbered. As a result the unit became the 13th Middlesex (Queen's Westminster) Volunteer Rifle Corps and were attached to the King's Royal Rifle Corps as a Volunteer Battalion.Army List, HMSO, 1892, p.632 In 1886 the battalion established its headquarters at 58 Buckingham Gate, Westminster.Osborne, Mike, 2006. Always Ready: The Drill Halls of Britain's Volunteer Forces, Partizan Press, p. 247 and by 1902 it was the largest volunteer rifle corps battalion in London. First World War Under the Haldane Reforms that created the Territorial Force in 1908, the battalion was included in the new all-Territorial London Regiment, taking its place as the 16th (County of London) Battalion, The London Regiment (Queen's Westminsters). Memorial in St Cassian's Church in Chaddesley Corbett, Worcestershire, to C. F. D. Fitch of the Queen's Westminster Rifles, killed in the Battle of the Somme in 1916 On the outbreak of the First World War the battalion was designated 1/16th (County of London) Battalion (Queen's Westminster Rifles). At this stage it was part of 4th London Brigade, part of the 2nd London Division. On mobilisation it moved to the Hemel Hempstead area. On 3 November 1914 it left the Division and landed at Le Havre. On 12 November 1914 it came under command of 18th Brigade in the 6th Division. During the war the unit raised a 2nd and 3rd Battalion.The battalions were also redesignated, becoming, for example, '1/16th' Londons (for the 1st Line) to differentiate them from the 2nd Line units, which were redesignated '2/16th' Londons (for the 2nd Line). On 10 February 1916 the 1st battalion transferred to 169th (3rd London) Brigade in 56th (London) Division. The 2/16th served as part of 179th (2/4th London) Brigade in the Middle East. Interwar On 31 December 1921 the battalion amalgamated with the 15th (County of London) Battalion, The London Regiment (Prince of Wales's Own, Civil Service Rifles) to form the 16th (County of London) Battalion, The London Regiment (Queen's Westminster and Civil Service Rifles). It evolved to become the 16th London Regiment (Queen's Westminster and Civil Service Rifles) in 1922. Then, on the break-up of the London Regiment in 1937, it became the Queen's Westminsters, The King's Royal Rifle Corps. Second World War The original Westminsters became the 1st Battalion after a duplicate battalion was raised in 1939. The following year, it was converted to a motor battalion. In 1941, the 1st Battalion was re- titled as the 11th (Queen's Westminsters) Battalion, King's Royal Rifle Corps, and the 2nd, the 12th (Queen's Westminsters) Battalion, King's Royal Rifle Corps. Both units saw extensive service during the war. The 11th Westminsters, as part of the 24th Armoured Brigade, saw service in the North African Campaign in mid-1942, taking part in the Allied offensive during the Second Battle of El Alamein against Erwin Rommel's Afrika Korps. The battalion took part in the subsequent advance after the Germans and Italians went into full- retreat in North Africa, seeing action in the Tunisia Campaign as part of the 23rd Armoured Brigade after the 24th Armoured Brigade was disbanded.Joslen, p. 170 The 11th Westminsters moved to Sicily the following year, taking part in the campaign on the Italian island, which began on 10 July 1943. It later moved to the Italian Front, remaining there into 1944. In December 1944, the Westminsters took part in the operations to quell a Communist uprising in the Greek capital of Athens; this mission was successful and a cease-fire was signed on 11 January 1945.

The 12th Westminsters, having remained in the United Kingdom since the war began, took part in the Battle of Normandy in 1944, forming part of the 8th Armoured Brigade. It saw extensive service in France, including action at Rauray on 26 June and at Mont Pincon in Operation Epsom and during the advance east to the Seine, which was crossed in late August. The battalion subsequently crossed the Somme river, a scene of carnage during the Great War, which the Westminsters predecessors had experienced. It later took part in the liberation of Lille in early September, experiencing a welcoming reception by the inhabitants of the large town. Shortly afterwards, the 12th took part in the advance into Belgium, taking part in, among others, the capture of Oostham. The 12th Westminsters saw further service in the Netherlands and when Victory in Europe Day came on 8 May, were in Germany itself. Notable soldiers in the Westminsters during World War II include the journalist Bill Deedes, who served in the North West Europe Campaign, and was awarded the Military Cross, and Lord Killanin, the former President of the International Olympic Committee.

It was nominated for the Prometheus Award. Plot introduction During a raid on his camp, Richard is seriously wounded and now Nicci must use Subtractive Magic in order to save him. Richard awakens to find his wife Kahlan missing and discovers that he is the only person alive who remembers her. As he begins to search for her, he learns that he is also hunted by a beast created by Jagang's Sisters of the Dark. Plot summary Richard Rahl is the ruler of the D'Haran Empire, a collection of nations previously made up of D'Hara and the Midlands. Richard Rahl and the D'Haran Empire are currently locked in an epic struggle with the Imperial Order, an Empire from the Old World, led by Emperor Jagang. Chainfire continues the story of Richard in his attempt to teach the people that their lives are theirs alone, and that they can be free of the Imperial Order. Richard is gravely injured from an enemy's arrow. He is brought to Nicci, a sorceress and former Sister of the Dark, who heals him using Subtractive Magic; this causes unforeseen events to spiral out of control. When Richard awakens, he discovers that his wife, Kahlan Amnell, the Mother Confessor, is missing. Furthermore, no one around him seems to remember her. Nicci and Cara both attribute Richard's memory of Kahlan to dreams and delusions brought on by his injury and possibly an unintended effect of the Subtractive Magic used in healing Richard. Despite Richard's attempts to explain the events of the last several years could not have happened without Kahlan, the paradoxes are explained away as Richard remembering things inaccurately. Fearing for Kahlan's life, Richard desperately tries to find some trace of her and at the same time convince the others that she exists. His search leads him to the witch woman, Shota, who reveals \\"that which you seek is long buried with the bones\\". In return for more information, Shota demands the Sword of Truth, which Richard relinquishes to her pet, Samuel, the previous bearer of the sword. Shota then utters the words \\"Chainfire\\" and \\"The Deep Nothing\\" and tells Richard to \\"beware the four-headed viper\\". She also warns Richard of a \\"blood beast\\" conjured by several wizards and Sisters of the Dark, under the orders of Jagang. The beast is meant to kill Richard and is as unstoppable as it is unpredictable. Further, the beast is able to track Richard when he uses his gift because of the way Nicci healed his arrow wound. In the meantime, Ann and Nathan together have discovered many blank pages in books of ancient prophecy. They seem to remember that the pages should not be blank but cannot remember what was originally written there. Zedd makes the same discovery independently. Leaving Agaden Reach, Richard makes his way to the Wizard's Keep to find Zedd, but he also has no memory of Kahlan. Nicci arrives simultaneously. To prove Kahlan's existence, Richard exhumes her grave and is shocked to find a corpse in the buried casket with a nametag attached to her dress. He is devastated and falls into a deep depression. Meanwhile, Ann, Nathan, and Frederich also arrive at the Keep. Desperate to get their \\"Richard\\" back so that he will \\"fulfill prophecy\\" and lead the D'Haran army against the forces of Emperor Jagang. Zedd, Nathan, and Ann attempt to coerce Nicci into secretly using Subtractive Magic to delete Richard's \\"delusions\\"; Nicci instead begs Richard to persevere in his beliefs. Together with Cara, they head to the Sliph to travel to the People's Palace. Richard learns that the Sliph knows of a place called the Deep Nothing. The Sliph takes them to some ruins called \\"Caska\\" in the Deep Nothing. Upon arriving, they find themselves in the midst of a group of Imperial Order advanced scouts who have captured a girl named Jillian, part of a people called the \\"Dream Casters\\". While Nicci eliminates the rest of the Imperial Troops scouts, Richard and Jillian look for answers in the catacombs. Together, they find a hidden passage that leads to a protected library. In the library, Jillian discovers a book titled Chainfire. At the same time, the reader learns that Kahlan indeed exists, and has been kidnapped by the four remaining Sisters of the Dark who escaped the Dream Walker in Blood of the Fold. The Sisters have cast a spell called Chainfire, using Subtractive Magic to erase people's memories of Kahlan and Kahlan's memories of herself. The Sisters then use Kahlan to steal the boxes of Orden from the Garden of Life in the People's Palace. Kahlan leaves Spirit behind, the statue Richard carved for her. Richard, Nicci, and Cara then travel to the People's Palace and learn that the boxes are missing and that they have been put into play. Richard finds the statue Kahlan left and figures out that the Sisters have stolen his wife and the boxes. With the proof in the Garden of Life, Nicci and Cara finally believe in the existence of Kahlan, despite not remembering her. While there, they learn that an older woman has been found fatally stabbed near the D'haran army; Nicci and Richard determine that it is Sister Tovi. Nicci uses deception to interrogate Tovi, discovering that it was Samuel who stabbed Tovi and took the Box of Orden she was carrying. She also learns about the Chainfire spell, about how it was used to obliterate everyone's memory about Kahlan, and that the Boxes of Orden were created in opposition to it. Later, Richard realizes that the Sword of Truth protected him from the Chainfire spell, which is why he was still able to remember Kahlan. Richard, Nicci and Cara return to the Wizard's Keep and, with the information gathered from Tovi and the book \\"Chainfire\\", they finally manage to convince Zedd, Nathan, and Ann of the truth. While no one but Richard remembers Kahlan, they now believe that she exists. CharactersChainfire magic The spell is explained as a complicated memory-altering magic. But it is not as simple as erasing the memory of everyone directly, as this is merely Subtractive Magic. Also, simply attempting to erase the memory because it uses Subtractive Magic, has a strong probability of destroying portions of the mind, thus killing the subject. A death spell, can for instance, make it seem like a person is dead, but everyone still remembers the person existed. Also, if you tried to erase the knowledge of even a simple person like a woodcutter, the nature of reality would be such that all too obvious gaps in memory would be noticed, such as how the woodcutter's wife got her food and wood if she were crippled. For this reason, some wizards came up with a workaround, using some energy to warp reality itself or at least human perception of it. False memories are automatically created to fill the gaps in reality, almost as if someone went back in time and changed them. Wizard's Ninth Rule The Wizard's Ninth Rule, revealed in Chainfire, is: It is explained in the novel as follows: \\"To believe in a contradiction is to abdicate your belief in the existence of the world around you and the nature of the things in it, to instead embrace any random impulse that strikes your fancy – to imagine something is real simply because you wish it were. A thing is what it is, it is itself. There can be no contradictions. In reality, contradictions cannot exist. To believe in them you must abandon the most important thing you possess: your rational mind. The wager for such a bargain is your life. In such an exchange, you always lose what you have at stake.\\" ReferencesExternal links *Official Terry Goodkind website *'Chainfire' book review, November 9, 2006 Category:The Sword of Truth books Category:2005 American novels Category:2005 fantasy novels Category:American fantasy novels Category:Tor Books books ","title":"Chainfire"},{"id":"1483724","text":"Walter Jones (December 18, 1745 - December 31, 1815) was an 18th- and 19th- century politician and physician from Virginia. Biography Born in Williamsburg, Virginia, Jones graduated from the College of William and Mary in 1760. He studied medicine in Edinburgh, Scotland and received a degree of Doctor of Medicine in 1770. He returned to Northumberland County, Virginia and became physician general of the Middle Military Department in 1777. Jones was a member of the Virginia Senate from 1785 to 1787 and was a delegate to the Virginia Ratifying Convention in 1788. He was elected a Democratic-Republican to the United States House of Representatives in 1796, serving from 1797 to 1799. He returned to the state Senate in 1802 and 1803 and was elected back to the House of Representatives again in 1802, serving from 1803 to 1811. His son and namesake, Walter Jones (1775-1861) practiced law in Washington most of his life and reportedly argued more cases before the US Supreme Court – over 300, including Mcculloch vs. Maryland - than any other attorney in American history. A close friend of James Madison, James Marshall and John Calhoun, he also held the rank of Major General of the Army, and rode at the head of the District of Columbia Militia at presidential Inaugurations. Jones was also a member of the prestigious society, Columbian Institute for the Promotion of Arts and Sciences, which counted among its members former presidents Andrew Jackson and John Quincy Adams and many prominent men of the day, including well-known representatives of the military, government service, medical and other professions. Living until the start of the Civil War, he strongly opposed Virginia’s secession. The senior Jones died in Westmoreland County, Virginia, on December 31, 1815, and was interred there in the family cemetery at \\"Hayfield\\" near what is now Callo, Virginia.

People celebrate their name day (\\"svátek\\" or more formally \\"jmeniny\\") on the date corresponding to their own given name. In the past, parents were not allowed to choose just any name for a child. This has changed, although it is still common to choose the name from the name day \\"calendar\\" and any highly unusual name has to be approved by a special office. The original list was the Roman Catholic calendar of saints, but many changes were made to reflect the present-day usage of names. The name day is commonly of less importance than birthdays to Czech people. The name day celebration can be held together with friends or co-workers of the same name and in this way it can grow in size and \\"importance\\". The name day is nowadays more likely a reason to giving a present to somebody . For example, take a lady named Aneta who was born on January 1st; her name day is the 17th of May and on this day she may feel entitled to presents and gifts from her partner, family, and friends as if it were her birthday.

Collating various sources, his full name was probably Abu Bakr ibn Umar ibn Talagagin (alias Ibrahim) ibn Turgut (or Turgit or Waraggut) ibn Wartantaq. See N. Levtzion and J.F.P. Hopkins, 200'0, editors, Corpus of Early Arabic Sources for West African History, University of Ghana, p.409. (died 1087; ) was a chieftain of the Lamtuna Berber Tribe and commander of the Almoravids from 1056 until his death. Life Abu Bakr ibn Umar was a member of the Banu Turgut, a clan of the Lamtuna Berbers. His brother, Yahya ibn Umar al-Lamtuni was the chieftain of the Lamtuna who invited the Maliki teacher Abdallah ibn Yasin, and together launched the Almoravid (murabitūn) movement in the early 1050s. Upon the death of Yahya ibn Umar in the Spring of 1056 at the Battle of Tabfarilla, the spiritual leader Abdallah ibn Yasin appointed Abu Bakr as the new military commander of the Almoravids. That same year, Abu Bakr recaptured Sijilmassa from the Maghrawa of the Zenata confederation. The city had been taken earlier by Yahya, but subsequently lost; Abu Bakr recaptured it definitively for the Almoravids in late 1056. In order to ensure they did not lose Sijilmassa again, Abu Bakr launched a campaign to secure the roads and valleys of southern Morocco. He immediately captured the Draa valley, then moved along the Wadi Nul (along the edge of the Anti-Atlas, picking up the adherence of the Sanhaja tribes of the Lamta and the Gazzula (Jazzula) to the Almoravid movement. Abu Bakr led the conquest of the Sous valley of southern Morocco, seizing the local capital of Taroudannt in 1057. By negotiation, Abdallah ibn Yasin secured an alliance with the Masmuda Berbers of the High Atlas, which allowed the Almoravids to cross the mountain range with little incident and seize the critical Zenata-ruled citadel of Aghmat in 1058 with little opposition. Delighted at the apparent ease of their advance, Abdallah ibn Yasin, ventured into the lands of the Berghwata of western Morocco with only a light escort and was promptly killed. Abu Bakr, who was them mopping up the area north of Aghmat, wheeled the Almoravid army and conquered the Berghwata in a brutal campaign of revenge. The death of the spiritual leader Abdallah ibn Yasin left the Almoravids under the sole command of Abu Bakr. Abu Bakr continued carrying out the Almoravid program without assuming the pretence of religious authority in himself. Abu Bakr, like later Almoravid rulers, took up the comparatively modest title of amir al-Muslimin (\\"Prince of the Muslims\\"), rather than the caliphal amir al-Mu'minin (\\"Commander of the Faithful\\"). Abu Bakr married the wealthiest woman in Aghmat, Zaynab an-Nafzawiyyah, who helped him navigate the complicated politics of southern Morocco. But Abu Bakr, a rustic desert warrior, found crowded Aghmat and its courtly life stifling. In 1060/61, Abu Bakr and his Sanhaja lieutenants left the city and pitched their tents on the pastures along the Tensift River, setting up an encampment for their headquarters, as if they were back in the Sahara desert. Stone buildings would eventually replace the tents, and the encampment would become the city of Marrakesh, an unusual-seeming city for the time, evocative of desert life with planted palms and an oasis-like feel. Abu Bakr placed his cousin Yusuf ibn Tashfin in charge of Aghmat, and assigned him the responsibility of maintaining the front against the Zenata to the north. In a series of campaigns through the 1060s, while Abu Bakr held court in Marrakesh, Yusuf directed Almoravid armies against northern Morocco, reducing Zenata strongholds one by one. In 1070, the Moroccan capital of Fez finally fell to the Almoravids. Discontent, however, had arisen in the Almoravid ranks, particularly among the desert clans back in the Sahara, who regarded these distant northern campaigns as expensive and pointless. The Guddala tribe, who had earlier broken away from the Almoravid coalition, began urging other desert tribes to follow suit. After the fall of Fez, feeling Morocco was now secure, Abu Bakr decided it was time to return to the Sahara to quell the dissension in the desert homelands. He placed Yusuf ibn Tashfin in charge of Morocco in his absence. As was common among the Sanhaja tribes before extended military campaigns, Abu Bakr divorced Zaynab before he left, advising her to marry Yusuf if she needed protection. Having quelled the discontent back in the Sahara, Abu Bakr returned north to Morocco in 1072. But Yusuf ibn Tashfin had enjoyed his taste of power, and was reluctant to give it up. Pushed by his new wife, Zaynab, Yusuf met Abu Bakr in the plain of Burnoose (between Marrakesh and Aghmat) and, by negotiation (rather than force), persuaded him to abdicate the northern dominions to him. As a courtesy to his former leader, Yusuf kept Abu-Bakr's name on the Almoravid coinage until his death. Abu Bakr returned to the Sahara desert to command the southern wing of the Almoravids. He launched a new set of campaigns against the dominions of the Ghana Empire in 1076 and is often credited with initiating the spread of Islam on the southern periphery of the Sahara. His campaigns are said to have gone as far as Mali and Gao. Abu Bakr ibn Umar died in 1087, and his dominions were partitioned among his sons and nephews (the sons of Yahya) after his death. Mauritanian oral tradition claims Abu Bakr was killed in a clash with the \\"Gangara\\" (Soninke Wangara of the Tagant Region of southern Mauritania), relating that he was struck down by an arrow from an old, blind Gangara chieftain in the pass of Khma (between the Tagant and Assab mountains, en route to Ghana).P.

It is intended to demonstrate that Spiritism clarifies and extends the most important teachings of Jesus. It is one of the five fundamental works of Kardecist Spiritism. The book attracted a lot of reaction from the Catholic Church and was indexed (added to the List of Prohibited Books). The first edition had been titled Imitation de l'Évangile (An Imitation of the Gospels), but the third, and definitive edition (1865) had the book renamed and profusely corrected (mostly typos or supposed mistakes in channeling), edited and expanded. Contents The book, the best documented and the most organised of the five fundamental works of Kardecist Spiritism, contains one introductory part and 28 chapters. The first 27 are each dedicated to dissecting one particular verse of the Gospels and the last one is a collection of prayers inspired by elevated spirits. Kardec was a devoted Catholic and a dedicated teacher (disciple of Pestalozzi before his contact with Spiritism). He looked forward to basing his teachings in solid biblical knowledge, as well as the messages he received from his guiding spirits. Therefore, the first part of the Gospel According to Spiritism is dedicated to a series of observations and clarifications intended to situate its arguments and doctrine so that those more familiar with exegesis would find their way throughout it more easily. Introduction The first item of the introduction argues that the currently existing translations of the Gospels were imperfect and were effectively unintelligible without proper relation to scholarly research about the culture and the customs of the peoples of the Middle-East. As the entirety of the message of Christ cannot be easily grasped from the existing texts about his life, Kardec argues that instead of handpicking the details, we should pay more attention to his teachings and more significant deeds. This is what he tries to do in this book. The second item argues that Spiritism is based on the highest and truer Christian morality: that it descends directly from the key teaching of Jesus. Kardec also argues that what makes the spiritist doctrine reliable is that it is not self-contradictory: the elevated spirits, channeled by mediums of goodwill all gave the same message and this message is logically consistent both internally and with what Christ taught. The third part is a rough guide to the Gospels, explaining the meaning of foreign concepts and new words only found there. The fourth part explains that even before Christ theories similar to Spiritism could be found in the Greek philosophy, notably in Socrates and Plato (Spiritists have both philosophers in high esteem and consider them as precursors of Christ). Chapters These observations are followed by 27 doctrinal chapters which are comments on quotes of Christ. The last chapter is a collection of prayers channeled by elevated spirits, intended as examples of how we are supposed to pray. Doctrinal Principles The key aspects of the Gospel According to Spiritism are: * The revelation of God is continuous because mankind is slowly evolving to a higher level, making it necessary to perfect the doctrine. The first revelation was through Moses, the second through Christ (modern Spiritists argue that it was previously tried in Greece with Socrates but failed), and the third one was from God himself through his messengers, the several spirits that worked on the Codification. (Spiritism). * Spirits are immortal and live several lives (reincarnations) to perfect their moral and their intelligence until they are able to be in the presence of God. * Every revelation elaborates on the previous, instead of revoking it. * Morality is mostly based on love (spiritual love, that is, not carnal love) for everyone and anyone. * Love must be put to practice. * Charity (the practice of love) must not seek retribution. * Religion must be free. * Marriage is not indissoluble, if there is no agreement, nor fidelity to the former love anymore, this proves that the couple is no longer bounded, so the divorce would be the final and natural act of separation for those who choose it. * Outside charity there is no salvation. This is the main motto of Spiritism. * Everyone will eventually be saved, though it may take an unimaginably long time for some (see universal reconciliation).

As a consequence of the frustration in the geometry or in the forces, a plenitude of distinct ground states may result at zero temperature, and usual thermal ordering may be suppressed at higher temperatures. Much studied examples are amorphous materials, glasses, or dilute magnets. The term frustration, in the context of magnetic systems, has been introduced by Gerard Toulouse (1977). Indeed, frustrated magnetic systems had been studied even before. Early work includes a study of the Ising model on a triangular lattice with nearest-neighbor spins coupled antiferromagnetically, by G. H. Wannier, published in 1950. Related features occur in magnets with competing interactions, where both ferromagnetic as well as antiferromagnetic couplings between pairs of spins or magnetic moments are present, with the type of interaction depending on the separation distance of the spins. In that case commensurability, such as helical spin arrangements may result, as had been discussed originally, especially, by A. Yoshimori, T. A. Kaplan, R. J. Elliott, and others, starting in 1959, to describe experimental findings on rare-earth metals. A renewed interest in such spin systems with frustrated or competing interactions arose about two decades later, beginning in the 1970s, in the context of spin glasses and spatially modulated magnetic superstructures. In spin glasses, frustration is augmented by stochastic disorder in the interactions, as may occur, experimentally, in non-stoichiometric magnetic alloys. Carefully analyzed spin models with frustration include the Sherrington–Kirkpatrick model, describing spin glasses, and the ANNNI model, describing commensurability magnetic superstructures. Magnetic ordering Geometrical frustration is an important feature in magnetism, where it stems from the relative arrangement of spins. A simple 2D example is shown in Figure 1. Three magnetic ions reside on the corners of a triangle with antiferromagnetic interactions between them; the energy is minimized when each spin is aligned opposite to neighbors. Once the first two spins align antiparallel, the third one is frustrated because its two possible orientations, up and down, give the same energy. The third spin cannot simultaneously minimize its interactions with both of the other two. Since this effect occurs for each spin, the ground state is sixfold degenerate. Only the two states where all spins are up or down have more energy. Similarly in three dimensions, four spins arranged in a tetrahedron (Figure 2) may experience geometric frustration. If there is an antiferromagnetic interaction between spins, then it is not possible to arrange the spins so that all interactions between spins are antiparallel. There are six nearest-neighbor interactions, four of which are antiparallel and thus favourable, but two of which (between 1 and 2, and between 3 and 4) are unfavourable. It is impossible to have all interactions favourable, and the system is frustrated. Geometrical frustration is also possible if the spins are arranged in a non-collinear way. If we consider a tetrahedron with a spin on each vertex pointing along the easy axis (that is, directly towards or away from the centre of the tetrahedron), then it is possible to arrange the four spins so that there is no net spin (Figure 3). This is exactly equivalent to having an antiferromagnetic interaction between each pair of spins, so in this case there is no geometrical frustration. With these axes, geometric frustration arises if there is a ferromagnetic interaction between neighbours, where energy is minimized by parallel spins. The best possible arrangement is shown in Figure 4, with two spins pointing towards the centre and two pointing away. The net magnetic moment points upwards, maximising ferromagnetic interactions in this direction, but left and right vectors cancel out (i.e. are antiferromagnetically aligned), as do forwards and backwards. There are three different equivalent arrangements with two spins out and two in, so the ground state is three-fold degenerate. Mathematical definition The mathematical definition is simple (and analogous to the so-called Wilson loop in quantum chromodynamics): One considers for example expressions (\\"total energies\\" or \\"Hamiltonians\\") of the form :\\\\mathcal H=\\\\sum_G -I_{k_ u , k_\\\\mu}\\\\,\\\\,S_{k_ u}\\\\cdot S_{k_\\\\mu}\\\\,, where G is the graph considered, whereas the quantities are the so-called \\"exchange energies\\" between nearest- neighbours, which (in the energy units considered) assume the values ±1 (mathematically, this is a signed graph), while the are inner products of scalar or vectorial spins or pseudo-spins. If the graph G has quadratic or triangular faces P, the so-called \\"plaquette variables\\" PW, \\"loop-products\\" of the following kind, appear: :P_W=I_{1,2}\\\\,I_{2,3}\\\\,I_{3,4}\\\\,I_{4,1} and P_W=I_{1,2}\\\\,I_{2,3}\\\\,I_{3,1}\\\\,, respectively, which are also called \\"frustration products\\". One has to perform a sum over these products, summed over all plaquettes. The result for a single plaquette is either +1 or −1. In the last-mentioned case the plaquette is \\"geometrically frustrated\\". It can be shown that the result has a simple gauge invariance: it does not change - nor do other measurable quantities, e.g. the \\"total energy\\" \\\\mathcal H – even if locally the exchange integrals and the spins are simultaneously modified as follows: :I_{i,k}\\\\to\\\\varepsilon_i I_{i,k}\\\\varepsilon_k ,\\\\quad S_i\\\\to\\\\varepsilon_i S_i ,\\\\quad S_k\\\\to \\\\varepsilon_k S_k\\\\,. Here the numbers εi and εk are arbitrary signs, i.e. +1 or −1, so that the modified structure may look totally random. Water ice Figure 5: Scheme of water ice molecules Although most previous and current research on frustration focuses on spin systems, the phenomenon was first studied in ordinary ice. In 1936 Giauque and Stout published The Entropy of Water and the Third Law of Thermodynamics. Heat Capacity of Ice from 15 K to 273 K, reporting calorimeter measurements on water through the freezing and vaporization transitions up to the high temperature gas phase. The entropy was calculated by integrating the heat capacity and adding the latent heat contributions; the low temperature measurements were extrapolated to zero, using Debye's then recently derived formula. The resulting entropy, S1 = 44.28 cal/(K·mol) = 185.3 J/(mol·K) was compared to the theoretical result from statistical mechanics of an ideal gas, S2 = 45.10 cal/(K·mol) = 188.7 J/(mol·K). The two values differ by S0 = 0.82 ± 0.05 cal/(K·mol) = 3.4 J/(mol·K). This result was then explained by Linus Pauling to an excellent approximation, who showed that ice possesses a finite entropy (estimated as 0.81 cal/(K·mol) or 3.4 J/(mol·K)) at zero temperature due to the configurational disorder intrinsic to the protons in ice. In the hexagonal or cubic ice phase the oxygen ions form a tetrahedral structure with an O–O bond length 2.76 Å (276 pm), while the O–H bond length measures only 0.96 Å (96 pm). Every oxygen (white) ion is surrounded by four hydrogen ions (black) and each hydrogen ion is surrounded by 2 oxygen ions, as shown in Figure 5. Maintaining the internal H2O molecule structure, the minimum energy position of a proton is not half-way between two adjacent oxygen ions. There are two equivalent positions a hydrogen may occupy on the line of the O–O bond, a far and a near position. Thus a rule leads to the frustration of positions of the proton for a ground state configuration: for each oxygen two of the neighboring protons must reside in the far position and two of them in the near position, so-called ‘ice rules’. Pauling proposed that the open tetrahedral structure of ice affords many equivalent states satisfying the ice rules. Pauling went on to compute the configurational entropy in the following way: consider one mole of ice, consisting of N O2− and 2N protons. Each O–O bond has two positions for a proton, leading to 22N possible configurations. However, among the 16 possible configurations associated with each oxygen, only 6 are energetically favorable, maintaining the H2O molecule constraint. Then an upper bound of the numbers that the ground state can take is estimated as Ω < 22N()N. Correspondingly the configurational entropy S0 = kBln(Ω) = NkBln() = 0.81 cal/(K·mol) = 3.4 J/(mol·K) is in amazing agreement with the missing entropy measured by Giauque and Stout. Although Pauling's calculation neglected both the global constraint on the number of protons and the local constraint arising from closed loops on the Wurtzite lattice, the estimate was subsequently shown to be of excellent accuracy. Spin ice Figure 6: Scheme of spin ice molecules A mathematically analogous situation to the degeneracy in water ice is found in the spin ices. A common spin ice structure is shown in Figure 6 in the cubic pyrochlore structure with one magnetic atom or ion residing on each of the four corners. Due to the strong crystal field in the material, each of the magnetic ions can be represented by an Ising ground state doublet with a large moment. This suggests a picture of Ising spins residing on the corner-sharing tetrahedral lattice with spins fixed along the local quantization axis, the <111> cubic axes, which coincide with the lines connecting each tetrahedral vertex to the center. Every tetrahedral cell must have two spins pointing in and two pointing out in order to minimize the energy. Currently the spin ice model has been approximately realized by real materials, most notably the rare earth pyrochlores Ho2Ti2O7, Dy2Ti2O7, and Ho2Sn2O7. These materials all show nonzero residual entropy at low temperature. Extension of Pauling’s model: General frustration The spin ice model is only one subdivision of frustrated systems. The word frustration was initially introduced to describe a system's inability to simultaneously minimize the competing interaction energy between its components. In general frustration is caused either by competing interactions due to site disorder (see also the Villain model or by lattice structure such as in the triangular, face-centered cubic (fcc), hexagonal-close-packed, tetrahedron, pyrochlore and kagome lattices with antiferromagnetic interaction. So frustration is divided into two categories: the first corresponds to the spin glass, which has both disorder in structure and frustration in spin; the second is the geometrical frustration with an ordered lattice structure and frustration of spin. The frustration of a spin glass is understood within the framework of the RKKY model, in which the interaction property, either ferromagnetic or anti- ferromagnetic, is dependent on the distance of the two magnetic ions. Due to the lattice disorder in the spin glass, one spin of interest and its nearest neighbors could be at different distances and have a different interaction property, which thus leads to different preferred alignment of the spin. Artificial geometrically frustrated ferromagnets With the help of lithography techniques, it is possible to fabricate sub-micrometer size magnetic islands whose geometric arrangement reproduces the frustration found in naturally occurring spin ice materials. Recently R. F. Wang et al. reported the discovery of an artificial geometrically frustrated magnet composed of arrays of lithographically fabricated single-domain ferromagnetic islands. These islands are manually arranged to create a two-dimensional analog to spin ice. The magnetic moments of the ordered ‘spin’ islands were imaged with magnetic force microscopy (MFM) and then the local accommodation of frustration was thoroughly studied. In their previous work on a square lattice of frustrated magnets, they observed both ice-like short-range correlations and the absence of long-range correlations, just like in the spin ice at low temperature. These results solidify the uncharted ground on which the real physics of frustration can be visualized and modeled by these artificial geometrically frustrated magnets, and inspires further research activity. These artificially frustrated ferromagnets can exhibit unique magnetic properties when studying their global response to an external field using Magneto-Optical Kerr Effect. In particular, a non-monotonic angular dependence of the square lattice coercivity is found to be related to disorder in the artificial spin ice system.  Geometric frustration without lattice  Another type of geometrical frustration arises from the propagation of a local order. A main question that a condensed matter physicist faces is to explain the stability of a solid. It is sometimes possible to establish some local rules, of chemical nature, which lead to low energy configurations and therefore govern structural and chemical order. This is not generally the case and often the local order defined by local interactions cannot propagate freely, leading to geometric frustration. A common feature of all these systems is that, even with simple local rules, they present a large set of, often complex, structural realizations. Geometric frustration plays a role in fields of condensed matter, ranging from clusters and amorphous solids to complex fluids. The general method of approach to resolve these complications follows two steps. First, the constraint of perfect space-filling is relaxed by allowing for space curvature. An ideal, unfrustrated, structure is defined in this curved space. Then, specific distortions are applied to this ideal template in order to embed it into three dimensional Euclidean space. The final structure is a mixture of ordered regions, where the local order is similar to that of the template, and defects arising from the embedding. Among the possible defects, disclinations play an important role. Tiling of a plane by pentagons is impossible but can be realized on a sphere in the form of pentagonal dodecahedron as demonstrated in quasicrystals Simple two- dimensional examples Two-dimensional examples are helpful in order to get some understanding about the origin of the competition between local rules and geometry in the large. Consider first an arrangement of identical discs (a model for a hypothetical two-dimensional metal) on a plane; we suppose that the interaction between discs is isotropic and locally tends to arrange the disks in the densest way as possible. The best arrangement for three disks is trivially an equilateral triangle with the disk centers located at the triangle vertices. The study of the long range structure can therefore be reduced to that of plane tilings with equilateral triangles. A well known solution is provided by the triangular tiling with a total compatibility between the local and global rules: the system is said to be \\"unfrustrated\\". But now, the interaction energy is supposed to be at a minimum when atoms sit on the vertices of a regular pentagon. Trying to propagate in the long range a packing of these pentagons sharing edges (atomic bonds) and vertices (atoms) is impossible. This is due to the impossibility of tiling a plane with regular pentagons, simply because the pentagon vertex angle does not divide 2. Three such pentagons can easily fit at a common vertex, but a gap remains between two edges. It is this kind of discrepancy which is called \\"geometric frustration\\". There is one way to overcome this difficulty. Let the surface to be tiled be free of any presupposed topology, and let us build the tiling with a strict application of the local interaction rule. In this simple example, we observe that the surface inherits the topology of a sphere and so receives a curvature. The final structure, here a pentagonal dodecahedron, allows for a perfect propagation of the pentagonal order. It is called an \\"ideal\\" (defect- free) model for the considered structure. Dense structures and tetrahedral packings Tetrahedral packing: The dihedral angle of a tetrahedron is not commensurable with 2; consequently, a hole remains between two faces of a packing of five tetrahedra with a common edge. A packing of twenty tetrahedra with a common vertex in such a way that the twelve outer vertices form an irregular icosahedron The stability of metals is a longstanding question of solid state physics, which can only be understood in the quantum mechanical framework by properly taking into account the interaction between the positively charged ions and the valence and conduction electrons. It is nevertheless possible to use a very simplified picture of metallic bonding and only keeps an isotropic type of interactions, leading to structures which can be represented as densely packed spheres. And indeed the crystalline simple metal structures are often either close packed face-centered cubic (fcc) or hexagonal close packing (hcp) lattices. Up to some extent amorphous metals and quasicrystals can also be modeled by close packing of spheres. The local atomic order is well modeled by a close packing of tetrahedra, leading to an imperfect icosahedral order. A regular tetrahedron is the densest configuration for the packing of four equal spheres. The dense random packing of hard spheres problem can thus be mapped on the tetrahedral packing problem. It is a practical exercise to try to pack table tennis balls in order to form only tetrahedral configurations. One starts with four balls arranged as a perfect tetrahedron, and try to add new spheres, while forming new tetrahedra. The next solution, with five balls, is trivially two tetrahedra sharing a common face; note that already with this solution, the fcc structure, which contains individual tetrahedral holes, does not show such a configuration (the tetrahedra share edges, not faces). With six balls, three regular tetrahedra are built, and the cluster is incompatible with all compact crystalline structures (fcc and hcp). Adding a seventh sphere gives a new cluster consisting in two \\"axial\\" balls touching each other and five others touching the latter two balls, the outer shape being an almost regular pentagonal bi- pyramid. However, we are facing now a real packing problem, analogous to the one encountered above with the pentagonal tiling in two dimensions. The dihedral angle of a tetrahedron is not commensurable with 2; consequently, a hole remains between two faces of neighboring tetrahedra. As a consequence, a perfect tiling of the Euclidean space R3 is impossible with regular tetrahedra. The frustration has a topological character: it is impossible to fill Euclidean space with tetrahedra, even severely distorted, if we impose that a constant number of tetrahedra (here five) share a common edge. The next step is crucial: the search for an unfrustrated structure by allowing for curvature in the space, in order for the local configurations to propagate identically and without defects throughout the whole space. Regular packing of tetrahedra: the polytope {3,3,5} 600-cell: polytope {3,3,5} Twenty irregular tetrahedra pack with a common vertex in such a way that the twelve outer vertices form a regular icosahedron. Indeed, the icosahedron edge length l is slightly longer than the circumsphere radius r (l ≈ 1.05r). There is a solution with regular tetrahedra if the space is not Euclidean, but spherical. It is the polytope {3,3,5}, using the Schläfli notation, also known as the 600-cell. There are one hundred and twenty vertices which all belong to the hypersphere S3 with radius equal to the golden ratio (φ = ) if the edges are of unit length. The six hundred cells are regular tetrahedra grouped by five around a common edge and by twenty around a common vertex. This structure is called a polytope (see Coxeter) which is the general name in higher dimension in the series containing polygons and polyhedra. Even if this structure is embedded in four dimensions, it has been considered as a three dimensional (curved) manifold. This point is conceptually important for the following reason. The ideal models that have been introduced in the curved Space are three dimensional curved templates. They look locally as three dimensional Euclidean models. So, the {3,3,5} polytope, which is a tiling by tetrahedra, provides a very dense atomic structure if atoms are located on its vertices. It is therefore naturally used as a template for amorphous metals, but one should not forget that it is at the price of successive idealizations.

Over subsequent versions, it evolved to be much more complex and to be based around a framework, named Core, comprising Microsoft Windows Script (JavaScript) code and LiteStep-supported script code. There is also support for Lua and Python code to be run in this framework. This wide-ranging support was a deliberate aim of the developer team because it allowed contributions and encourages extensions to the system. Localisation support is also provided within this framework, although it is not ideal due to limitations from the LiteStep system. The framework simplifies common tasks with a suite of individual scripts that were designed to handle commonly occurring events. An example of a typical basis for this framework to exist is that each traditional LiteStep theme (user interface) author has historically either had to write his or her own code to save settings to files, or has, in the worst case, had to ask the user to directly edit the code. The LDE developers considered this to be an ease-of-use issue and for this and other cases, scripts were coded that eventually formed the LDE(X) Core framework. The framework also provides support for the current in- vogue Open Theme Standard (version 2), OTS, used by the LiteStep community. This was a requested feature and also allows for such themes (user interfaces) to use parts of the LDE(X) SDK to extend their abilities when run on LDE(X). The user interface was able to be chosen from a list of installed systems and is then loaded on top of this framework. User interfaces could load extensions (plugins) from a common repository. Each user using LDE(X) has their own configuration tree which is located in their own OS-provided 'Documents and Settings' folder, with the entire system being designed around multiple user operating systems. LDE(X) was accompanied by a programme called OpenLDE, designed to allow for forks of the main distribution to (if they wish) be quickly recognised as an LDE(X)-derivative. This never saw adoption within the wider community, however. The project was ended in May 2007. The 6.4.4 and 6.4.5 updates remain beta status, and only affect one feature in the system. It is not expected that there will be future updates, primarily due to the size of the community and also the system's dependence on components that were never open-sourced by developers and are only available for 32-bit Windows. The web-site went offline in September 2016.

The highway is entirely within Monroe County with the southern terminus on the Ohio state border near Toledo and a northern terminus at US Highway 24 (US 24) in Frenchtown Township, north of Monroe. M-125 runs through rural farmlands and connects a couple of smaller towns with Monroe. It has an unsigned connector highway that links the main highway with Interstate 75 (I-75). The highway is a section of the former Dixie Highway and US 25 in the state. It was first added to the state highway system in 1926 and given its current number in 1973. Previously there were two other highways that carried the M-125 moniker. One in the 1930s ran through the Upper Peninsula near Thompson and a second from 1938 until the mid-1950s was located in Bay County. The current designation was created in 1973 when US 25 was decommissioned in Michigan. The section in downtown Monroe was named what is now a Pure Michigan Byway in 1995. Route description M-125 starts at the state line as the continuation of Detroit Avenue running northward from Toledo. Once across the state line, the roadway takes on the Dixie Highway name and passes a residential subdivision. The highway runs north-northeasterly roughly parallel with, and between, both US 24 and I-75 through farm land in rural Monroe County. The trunkline passes through the community of Erie before intersecting with Conn. M-125 (Summit Street) north of town. That unsigned connector is a state highway that links M-125 with I-75 to the south. Continuing north, M-125 intersects Luna Pier Road, which to the west is the unsigned Conn. US 24 that offers a path to US 24 (Telegraph Road). The route of M-125 changes direction slightly as it passes through the community of LaSalle; north of town it follows a more northeasterly course. The roadway passes through residential areas north of town as it approaches Monroe. South of the city, M-125 crosses the La Plaisance Creek and turns north-northwesterly through South Monroe. North of Lake Monroe, the road name changes from Dixie Highway to Monroe Street. The highway is the main street of the downtown area as it crosses the River Raisin upstream from the River Raisin National Battlefield Park. M-125 exits town near The Mall of Monroe. About north of Monroe, after running through farm land again, M-125 terminates at an intersection where Dixie Highway merges into US 24 (Telegraph Road). Intersection of M-125 & US 24, facing south M-125 is maintained by the Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT) like other state highways in Michigan. As a part of these maintenance responsibilities, the department tracks the volume of traffic that uses the roadways under its jurisdiction. These volumes are expressed using a metric called annual average daily traffic, which is a statistical calculation of the average daily number of vehicles on a segment of roadway. MDOT's surveys in 2011 showed that the highest traffic levels along M-125 were the 21,229 vehicles daily between Jones and Front streets in Monroe; the lowest counts were the 2,306 vehicles per day between Stearns and Erie roads near Erie. No section of M-125 has been listed on the National Highway System, a network of roads important to the country's economy, defense, and mobility. History=Previous designations M-125 was first designated on a road in the Upper Peninsula from US 2 to north of Thompson in 1931; this roadway was later merged into M-149 in 1936 after a rerouting of US 2 through the area. Later in 1938, the M-125 designation was used for a highway under construction along Parish Road in Bay County running for west of US 23 (now M-13). The highway intersected US 23 between Kawkawlin and Linwood and ran westward to 7 Mile Road. It was completed as a gravel road in 1939, and paved by 1945. The second M-125 was transferred back to local control in late 1956 or early 1957. Current designation The Dixie Highway was conceived in 1915 to connect Chicago to Miami and commemorate a half-century since the end of the Civil War. On the suggestion of Governor Woodbridge Ferris, representatives from Michigan convinced the Dixie Highway Association to include Michigan in the proposed auto trail. Two divisions through the Lower Peninsula were included, the eastern one included a route between Detroit and Toledo via Monroe. This section of the Dixie Highway in Monroe County was first added to the state highway system in 1926 when US 25 was created. The highway was rerouted through downtown Monroe in the early 1930s; instead of turning westward in downtown to connect to Telegraph Road, the highway instead continued northward to the current Dixie Highway–Telegraph Road intersection. When the US 25 designation was decommissioned in the state in 1973, the highway segment between the state line and the Monroe area was given the M-125 designation. The routing has remained unchanged since. In 1995, the section through downtown Monroe was named what is now a Pure Michigan Byway.

The facility is operated by a nonprofit organization named The Carolina Theatre of Durham, Inc. under a management agreement with the City of Durham, which owns the complex. History The main stage, Fletcher Hall In 1923, the city of Durham chose to construct an auditorium on a lot adjacent to Morris Street School. Bids for construction were accepted on May 1, 1925 and the $250,000 budget was set. The building was completed in 1926 and opened on February 2 of that year with the Kiwanis Jollies. The theater's popularity rose during the World War II years and soldiers from Camp Butner were moved to the theater to watch movies. In 1977, the North Carolina Department of Archives and History completed a historic survey of Downtown Durham and recognized The Carolina Theatre as a \\"significant building in the city\\" and the center portion of downtown was placed on the National Register of Historic Places. The Carolina Theatre remains the last of thirteen original theaters in the city. The most recent renovation of the theater was in 2011, which included plaster repairs, new carpeting, painting, and sound upgrades in Fletcher Hall and the Cinemas. Design The Carolina Theatre was designed in the Beaux-Arts style by the Washington, D.C. architectural firm of Milburn, Heister & Company. This facility is not to be confused with the Carolina Theatre of Chapel Hill, which announced its closing in 2005. Theaters The main stage, called Fletcher Hall, seats 1,048 and has two balconies. The cinema wing, built in 1992, seats 226 in Cinema 1 and 49 in Cinema 2. The theater includes two elegant function rooms, the Connie Moses Ballroom, which is known for its chandeliers and large windows overlooking the plaza in front of the theater; and the Donor Lounge, located outside the theater's second balcony. Programming Carolina Theatre of Durham, Inc. is the 5th-largest performing arts organization in the Research Triangle region of North Carolina, which encompasses Raleigh, Durham, and Chapel Hill. The nonprofit presents nearly 100 concerts and comedy performances per year, more than any major venue in the market, and has been among the smallest venues ranked in Pollstar's Top 100 theatres worldwide since 2012. The theater shows more than 3,000 film screenings annually. It is the producer of the North Carolina Gay and Lesbian Film Festival, one of the largest LGBT film festivals in the Southeastern United States, as well as the Nevermore Film Festival. Rental Events The Carolina Theatre hosts numerous arts nonprofits from Durham and the Triangle Region. The Full Frame Documentary Film Festival occupies the theater for four days each April. The Durham Savoyards present a multi-day run of a Gilbert and Sullivan opera each March. Chamber Orchestra of the Triangle, the Mallarme Chamber Players, Durham Symphony, and Triangle Youth Ballet are among the other arts organizations that have a history of performances at the Carolina Theatre. Civil Rights History In 2014, an exhibit commemorating the Carolina Theatre's role in desegregation in Durham was unveiled to the public. The Carolina Theatre was the first theater in Durham to admit African- Americans, although there were still segregated ticket lines and lounge areas until the summer of 1963.

The brand was Anheuser-Busch's first widely distributed light beer, followed by Michelob Light and Bud Light, introduced in 1978 and 1981, respectively.

Some television commercials for the brand featured comedian Norm Crosby; another comedian, Bill Saluga, was noted in some of these for his officious character of \\"Raymond J.

On April 13, 1945, on the Isenschnibbe estate near the northern German town of Gardelegen, the troops forced over 1,000 slave laborers who were part of a transport train evacuated from the Mittelbau-Dora and Hannover-Stöcken concentration camps into a large barn, which was then set on fire. 1,016 prisoners, of which the largest number were Poles, were burned alive or shot trying to escape. The crime was discovered two days later by Company F, 2nd Battalion, 405th Infantry Regiment, U.S. 102nd Infantry Division, when the U.S. Army occupied the area. Eleven prisoners were found alive – seven Poles, three Russians and a Frenchman. The testimonies of survivors were collected and published by Melchior Wańkowicz in 1969, in the book From Stołpców to Cairo. Gardelegen became a part of the newly established German Democratic Republic in 1947 and is now in Saxony-Anhalt, Germany. Details American soldiers view bodies in barn Under the direction of an American soldier, German civilians from Gardelegen carry wooden crosses to the site where they were ordered to bury the bodies of concentration camp prisoners killed by the SS in a barn just outside the town The discovery of the massacre seems to have been by chance. The consensus account is that American Lieutenant Emerson Hunt, a liaison officer between 102nd Infantry Division headquarters and the 701st Tank Battalion, was captured by German forces on April 14, 1945, and bluffed the German forces defending the town of Gardelegen into believing that American tanks were approaching the city. This induced the German commander to surrender to the American forces. The Americans arrived at the site before the Germans had time to bury all of the bodies.https://archive.org/stream/with102dinfantry00unit/with102dinfantry00unit_djvu.txt On April 3–4, following the U.S. Army's crossing of the Rhine River and push into Germany, the SS camp administration at Dora-Mittelbau had ordered the evacuation of prisoners from the main camp and a number of its affiliated subcamps. The goal was to transport the inmates by train or by foot to the other north German concentration camps: Bergen-Belsen, Sachsenhausen, or Neuengamme. Within days, some 4,000 prisoners from Mittelbau-Dora, its satellite camps, and from the Neuengamme subcamp Hannover-Stöcken arrived in the Gardelegen area, where they had to deboard from the freight cars because the trains could not advance any further due to air raid damage to the rail lines. Greatly outnumbered by the prisoners, the SS guards began recruiting auxiliary forces from the local fire department, the air force, the aged home guard, the Hitler Youth, and other organizations to watch over the inmates. On April 13, more than a thousand prisoners, many of them sick and too weak to march any further, were taken from the town of Gardelegen to a large barn on the Isenschnibbe estate and forced inside the building. The assembled guards then barricaded the doors and set fire to gasoline-soaked straw. Prisoners who escaped the conflagration by digging under the barn's walls were killed by the guards. The next day, the SS and local auxiliaries returned to dispose of the evidence of their crime. They planned to incinerate what remained of the bodies and the barn, and kill any survivors of the blaze. The swift advance of the 102nd Infantry Division, however, prevented the SS and its accomplices from completely carrying out this plan. On April 14, the 102nd entered Gardelegen and, the following day, discovered the atrocity. They found the corpses of 1,016 prisoners in the still-smoldering barn and nearby trenches, where the SS had the charred remains dumped. They also interviewed several of the prisoners who had managed to escape the fire and the shootings. U.S. Army Signal Corps photographers soon arrived to document the Nazi crime and by April 19, 1945, the story of the Gardelegen massacre began appearing in the Western press. On that day, both the New York Times and The Washington Post ran stories on the massacre, quoting one American soldier who stated: > I never was so sure before of exactly what I was fighting for. Before this > you would have said those stories were propaganda, but now you know they > weren't. There are the bodies and all those guys are dead. Eleven prisoners survived the burning of the barn and were found alive by U.S. soldiers – seven Poles, three Russians and one severely wounded Frenchman. On April 21, 1945, the local commander of the 102nd ordered between 200 and 300 men from the town of Gardelegen to give the murdered prisoners a proper burial. Over the next few days, the German civilians exhumed 586 bodies from the trenches and recovered 430 bodies from the barn, placing each in an individual grave. On April 25, the 102nd carried out a ceremony to honor the dead and erected a memorial tablet to the victims, which stated that the townspeople of Gardelegen are charged with the responsibility that the “graves are forever kept as green as the memory of these unfortunates will be kept in the hearts of freedom-loving men everywhere.” Also on April 25, Colonel George Lynch addressed German civilians at Gardelegen with the following statement: > The German people have been told that stories of German atrocities were > Allied propaganda. Here, you can see for yourself. Some will say that the > Nazis were responsible for this crime. Others will point to the Gestapo. The > responsibility rests with neither — it is the responsibility of the German > people....Your so-called Master Race has demonstrated that it is master only > of crime, cruelty and sadism. You have lost the respect of the civilized > world. Investigation An investigation was undertaken by Lieutenant Colonel Edward E. Cruise, Investigating Officer, Ninth Army War Crimes Branch. Text of Lieutenant Colonel Cruise's report and text of other exhibits are stored in US Army file 000-12-242. SS-Untersturmführer , the transport leader for the prisoners evacuated from the Mittelbau-Dora concentration camp who subsequently wound up in Gardelegen, was put on trial in 1947 before a US military tribunal and was convicted and sentenced to life in prison. He died of leukemia in 1950. Statements of the survivors were gathered by Polish writer Melchior Wańkowicz and published in 1969. Memorials The surviving wall of the barn The cemetery Gardelegen is now a national memorial, which was rearranged by the former German Democratic Republic from 1952 till 1971. The sign at the cemetery, founded by the U.S. Army, reads: The sign at the remaining wall of the barn, applied by officials of the German Democratic Republic, reads: Memorial barn Isenschnibbe Gardelegen The memorial is located at the historic scene of the massacre of Gardelegen. It is a reminder of the 1016 concentration camp prisoners from many European countries who were murdered there on 13 April 1945 in a field barn near the Hanseatic city of Gardelegen. The site also includes the Memorial Cemetery, where the victims of the massacre are buried.

Hamon joined the Socialist Party in 1988 and by 1993 became the leader of the Young Socialist Movement, serving until 1995. In 2004, Hamon was elected MEP for East of France and during his time as MEP he ran for leadership of the Socialist Party, losing in the first round of the Reims Congress and endorsing the Eurosceptic option in the 2005 European Constitution referendum. In 2012, Hamon was elected to the National Assembly in Yveline's 11th constituency, though he resigned after being appointed as junior minister for the Social Economy at the Ministry of the Economy, Finance, and External Trade by President François Hollande. Hamon was then appointed Minister of National Education in Manuel Valls' new government. He was removed from this position alongside Economy Minister Arnaud Montebourg when they both publicly opposed the government economic policy. He later returned to the National Assembly in September of the same year, running in his previous constituency. Hamon's stint in the National Assembly consisted of voting in line with a group labeled the Frondeurs, a socialist group opposed to the social-liberal politics of Francois Hollande and Manuel Valls. In 2016, Hamon declared his intention to run in the Socialist Party primary for the 2017 presidential election. Being dubbed the \\"Jeremy Corbyn of the French- left\\" and \\"reinventing the French left\\", Hamon ran on ideas accused of being \\"far-out\\" such as legalising cannabis, taxing automation and introducing a universal basic income. Hamon eventually won in a run-off against former Prime Minister Manuel Valls and campaigned on similar ideals in the general election, though only gathering 6.36 percent of votes. Shortly following his loss in the legislative election, Hamon left the Socialist Party in July 2017 to found his own political party called 1 July Movement, later renamed Génération.s. After failing to win any seats in the 2019 European elections, Hamon will step back to reflect on his and his movement's political future.  Early life  Hamon was born 26 June 1967 in Saint-Renan, Finistère to an engineer father who worked for Naval Group in Brest and a secretary mother. Hamon lived in Brest until 1980, moving with his parents to Dakar, Senegal where he attended a Cours Sainte Marie de Hann private school. Hamon credited growing up in Dakar as influential to the future of his life due to the religious and ethnic diversity of the region. Hamon returned to Brittany following his parents divorce in 1984 and eventually enrolled in the University of Western Brittany studying a degree in History where he joined the Young Socialist movement. Hamon lived in an apartment with current Socialist Party first secretary Olivier Faure during his academic life.  Political career = Beginnings  After obtaining a degree in history at the University of Western Brittany in 1991, Hamon started his parliamentary career as an assistant to Socialist Party deputy Pierre Brana at the age of 24. Hamon had been taking part in student protests since the age of 19, starting his involvement in politics during a demonstration against Alain Devaquet's 1986-1987 education reform. Hamon joined the Socialist Party afterwards and became active in the Brest Socialist Party, being an advocate and supporter of Prime Minister Michel Rocard. Hamon also campaigned in support of the Maastricht Treaty in 1992. Following the Socialist Party's loss in the 1993 legislative election, Michel Rocard, with the support of the socialist wing of the party, became the first secretary. The subsequent shake- up of the party's establishment led to the Socialist Party's secretary of communication, Manuel Valls', appointing Hamon within the administration of the Young Socialists. Hamon was a regional manager with supervision over Brittany, Nancy and Lyon. Hamon's leadership was inspired entirely by Rocard, independent from the then-leadership of the Young Socialists. Hamon was elected the leader of the Young Socialists in November 1993. Hamon's leadership of the Young Socialists was marked by a closeness to student unions, which helped current Socialist Party politicians such as Pouria Amirshahi win elections for leadership positions within different student unions. Hamon also led an increase in membership from 500 members to 3,000, an expansion in terms of bases the Young Socialists have in universities and an increase of membership age from 25 to 29, mainly due to Hamon's own age of 26 at the time. Following the revelation that then-president François Mitterrand and former high ranking Vichy member René Bousquet had a friendship, Hamon resigned as the leader of the Young Socialists. He was succeeded by Régis Juanico and became the national Representative of youth issues for the Socialist Party and then the advisor for youth policy in Lionel Jospin's 1995 presidential election. Hamon ran for the National Assembly in 1997, in Morbihan's 2nd constituency's, losing in the second round. Hamon was then appointed as an advisor to Martine Aubry's Employment Ministry, mainly in charge of youth employment from 1997 to 1998 before becoming a senior advisor in 1998 to 2000. Hamon became a city councilor for Brétigny-sur-Orge in 2001, serving until 2008. He was also the director for strategic planning at Ipsos from 2001 to 2004.  European Parliament  In 2003, Hamon founded a caucus within the Socialist Party called the \\"New Socialist Party\\" with Arnaud Montebourg, Vincent Peillon, Julien Dray. The caucus was able to gathered 17% of votes at the Dijon Congress, the second most behind Francois Hollande, who was eventually elected the first secretary of the Socialist Party. The caucus became the main Socialist Left affiliation within the party following an endorsement by former-first secretary Henri Emmanuelli. The \\"New Socialist Party\\" split after a motion proposed by the party at the Le Mans Congress, was rejected by leading member Arnaud Montebourg. The caucus finally collapsed in 2006 after the leadership of the caucus endorsed different candidates during the primary for the presidential election. Hamon was Member of the European Parliament (MEP) for the East of France from 2004 to 2009, attached to the PES Group. He served as a member of the Committee of Economic and Monetary affairs, an alternative member of the Committee on Consumer Protection and the Vice-Chairman of the Delegate for the United States. Hamon was a campaigner for a \\"no\\" vote in the 2005 European Constitution referendum and was the national secretary for the PES Group, elected in 2005 and resigning in 2007 after the Socialist Party's support of the Lisbon Treaty despite promises made during the Le Mans Congress. Hamon became a spokesman for the Socialist Party in the 2007 legislative elections. After the candidacy for the First Secretary of the became a contest between , Hamon urged his supporters to vote for Aubry, who secured a narrow, contested majority. On 16 May 2012, Hamon was appointed Junior Minister for the Social Economy at the French Ministry of the Economy, Finance, and External Trade by President François Hollande. Hamon was Minister of National Education from 2 April 2014 until 25 August 2014, resigning as a result of Hollande's abandonment of a socialist agenda. He was national secretary for Europe and spokesperson for the Socialist Party.  2017 presidential campaign  Hamon announced his intention to seek the French presidency in August 2016. Critical of the social-liberal politics of Hollande and Prime Minister Manuel Valls, Hamon represented the left-wing and green side of the Socialist Party during the primary. Political meeting of Benoît Hamon in Paris on 18 April 2017 Hamon wants to give all French citizens a basic income, believing that the availability of work will decrease due to automation. He supports a 35-hour workweek, and less if a worker chooses in exchange for state compensation, and supports the legalisation of cannabis and euthanasia. He also argues for sizeable investments in renewable energy, aiming for renewable sources to provide 50% of French energy by 2025, and wants to protect the \\"common goods\\" (water, air, biodiversity) in the Constitution. Hamon is also very critical of the neoliberal \\"myth of infinite economic growth\\", which he blames for \\"destroying the planet\\" and argues is a \\"quasi-religion\\" among politicians, saying: \\"There is an urgency to change now our way to produce and consume. [...] We can negotiate with bankers, but we can't negotiate with the planet\\". Polling in January 2017 showed that his support had tripled and put him into serious contention for the nomination. On 22 January 2017, Hamon came in first in the first round of the primary, ahead of Valls. He secured the support of Arnaud Montebourg, who placed third, soon thereafter. In the runoff on 29 January, he won the Socialist Party nomination. Hamon conceded defeat after the first round of the presidential election on 23 April, and immediately announced his support for Emmanuel Macron in the second round. Addressing the 1 July Movement on 1 July 2017, Hamon said he was leaving the Socialist Party, but not socialism and called for the formation of local committees of the left to decide the movement's future.  Personal life  Hamon is in a civil union, also known as PACS in France, with Gabrielle Guallar with whom he has two daughters. The couple met while Hamon was an MEP for East France. Hamon has an estate in his home department of Finistère and an apartment in Hauts-de-Seine.

Like mass, total spin and magnetic moment, particle's charge quantum number remains unchanged between two reference frames in relative motion. For example, an electron has a specific charge e, total spin \\\\tfrac{\\\\hbar}{2}, and invariant mass me.

The origin of charge invariance, and all relativistic invariants, is presently unclear. There may be some hints proposed by string/M-theory. It is possible the concept of charge invariance may provide a key to unlocking the mystery of unification in physics – the single theory of gravity, electromagnetism, the strong, and weak nuclear forces.

It is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade I listed building, and is an active Anglican church in the diocese of Liverpool, the archdeaconry of Liverpool and the deanery of Toxteth and Wavertree. Pevsner described it as \\"by far the most beautiful Victorian church of Liverpool...an epitome of Late Victorian nobility in church design\\". History The church was built between 1883 and 1885 at a cost of £28,000 (equivalent to £ in ), which was paid for by the stockbroker H. Douglas Horsfall. The architect was John Loughborough Pearson. Present day The parish stands in the Anglo-Catholic tradition of the Church of England. As it rejects the ordination of women, it receives alternative episcopal oversight from the Bishop of Beverley (currently Glyn Webster). Architecture=Exterior The church is built in red brick with red sandstone dressings and a tile roof. Its plan consists of a four-bay nave with lean-to aisles and a clerestory, transepts at both ends, a south chapel with lean-to aisles, a short chancel with a canted polygonal apse, and an ambulatory which is flanked by turrets. At the west end are two porches. The west end and the transepts have angle buttresses and gable crosses. Over the east crossing is a lead-covered flèche. The windows are either lancets or have plate tracery. Interior The interior of the church is lined with Caen stone. The northwest transept contains the baptistry with a marble font carved by Nathaniel Hitch, who also worked with Pearson in Truro Cathedral. The nave has arcades with round piers and balconies above. The northeast transept contains the organ loft which consists of a polygonal platform supported by a central column of black marble surrounded by ten more columns around the edges. The south chapel is the Lady Chapel. Its screen of 1904 and reredos of 1904 were designed by G. F. Bodley. The ambulatory runs round the apse and is divided from the sanctuary by an arcade with statues of angel musicians in the spandrels. Above this is a frieze in high relief depicting the Adoration of the Lamb, and above this are statues of angels under canopies. The high altar reredos was carved by Nathaniel Hitch, as were the apse carvings. The pulpit is carved in Italian marble and depicts the Apostles and Church Fathers. The stained glass includes windows by Kempe and Herbert Bryans. The original pipe organ originally built by Wordsworth and Maskell of Leeds, has been unusable since 1996. The fine case and majority of the pipework survive in situ, for restoration should a funds be later made available. The console has been removed and replaced by that of an electronic organ which was made by Hugh Banton. Associated buildings Behind the church is the vicarage which was built between 1885 and 1887 to a design by Norman Shaw and paid for by H. Douglas Horsfall's mother. It is built in red brick with stone dressings and has two storeys. Its windows are arranged asymmetrically and include a canted oriel window on the street elevation. The vicarage is a Grade II* listed building. Also behind the church and attached to it by a passage is the church hall. It was built probably in 1887 and is also by Shaw. The hall is built in red brick with a tile roof. Its main part has a clerestory and lean-to aisles, and behind this is a smaller single-story room with windows containing tracery. It is listed at Grade II. See also *Grade I listed buildings in Merseyside *Grade I listed churches in Merseyside *List of new ecclesiastical buildings by J. L.

It ranges all over the Americas, from the southern United States to northern Argentina. Description A. fulgerator adults all look quite alike. They are mid-sized skipper butterflies with the typical wing shape of this group. The upperside is black, with basal to postbasal blue corners which are more extensive on the forewings. There is one discal-tomal and one apical band on the forewing; these are usually off white to light blue but the former may be quite white towards the costal margin. The thorax has bluish hair on the back, the underside is yellow to orange.Hebert et al. (2004) The caterpillars and pupae show a wide range of colors and patterns, and the caterpillars also vary in food preference. Last-instar caterpillars are black with a pattern consisting of light to bright yellow dots along the sides, or rings of varying thickness, sometimes interrupted on the back, in a range of colors varying from white to orange red. Larval food plants This species is highly polyphagous, with most food plants belonging to the Fabaceae (legume family): Selected primary food plantsArea de Conservación Guanacaste World Heritage Site, NW Costa Rica: Hébert et al. (2004) * Fabaceae ** Inga: I. exalata, I. oerstediana, I. punctata, I. sapindoides, I. vera and probably others ** Lonchocarpus (see also below) ** Senna: candle bush (S. alata), S. cobanensis, S. hayesiana, S. pallida, S. papillosa, S. undulata and probably othersHébert et al. (2004) refer to \\"Cassia emarginata\\", which today is either of Chamaecrista pilosa, Rambling Senna (S. bicapsularis) or Senna candolleana. The last does not occur in their study area; given the general importance of Senna species and the lack of records for Chamaecrista species as food plants in the study area, S. bicapsularis seems to be the plant in question. * Malvaceae ** Hampea appendiculata (but see below) * Sapindaceae ** Cupania: C. glabra, C. guatemalensis and probably others Selected secondary and accidental food plants * Capparaceae ** Capparis frondosa * Fabaceae ** Canavalia brasiliensis ** Cassia: golden shower tree (C. fistula), C. grandis and possibly others ** Centrosema (butterfly peas): C. macrocarpum, C. plumieri and possibly others ** Desmodium glabrum ** Dioclea: D. malacocarpa, D. violacea and possibly others ** Mucuna holtonii ** Piscidia carthagenensis * Malvaceae ** Byttneria catalpaefolia * Rhamnaceae ** Karwinskia calderoni * Salicaceae ** Casearia sylvestris * Styracaceae ** Styrax argenteus Systematics Due to the diversity of caterpillar colors and food plants it was suspected that the butterflies referred to as Astraptes fulgerator might be more than a single species. A controversial 2004 DNA barcoding study of a 648 base pair sequence from the Cytochrome c oxidase (COI) DNA sequence by Paul D. N. Hébert et al. led the authors to claim that at least ten sympatric populations in the Area de Conservación Guanacaste World Heritage Site in northwestern Costa Rica were in various stages of reproductive isolation. However, a later reanalysis of the same DNA sequence data using neighbor joining bootstrap, population aggregation analysis and cladistic haplotype analysis found that: \\"[a]t least three, but not more than seven mtDNA clades that may correspond to cryptic species are supported by the evidence\\". Also, where a specific DNA sequence did not correspond to its purported host plant, it was \\"simply dismissed with an ad hoc hypothesis and manifestly incorrect explanation\\" by Hébert and his coworkers. The improper use of taxonomic vocabulary was also criticized; Hébert et al. apply the terms \\"species\\" and \\"taxa\\" as if they were synonymous, but never actually validly described their proposed \\"species\\".Brower (2006) Two-barred flasher (Astraptes fulgerator azul).jpgA. f. azul Costa Rica Two-barred flasher (Astraptes fulgerator azul) underside.jpgA. f. azul Costa Rica Cryptic variation The exact number of taxa involved is disputed, most of the \\"species\\" detected by the DNA barcoding study seem to be nothing more than morphs or incipient subspecies, coupled with a serious underestimation of variation. Still, two lineages appear to be well distinct and separable at least as subspecies: \\"CELT\\" has larvae with bold orange bands in the last instar, which were recorded only on Celtis iguanaea (Ulmaceae). \\"TRIGO\\" last-instar larvae have bold yellow bands and were found on the Malpighiales Trigonia (T. arborea, T. laevia and T. rugosa) and, apparently accidentally, on Licania arborea. Three more lineages are in need of further study. One (\\"NUMT\\") was initially dismissed as a numt pseudogene combined with sequencing error but may represent a hitherto unrecognized taxon. Two other lineages (\\"LOHAM\\" and \\"LONCHO\\") were considered highly distinct in the barcoding study but the reanalysis showed that this might just as well be in error. The latter two are peculiar in some aspects, such as apparently never having bands or orange colors in the last instar stage and showing a preference for Lonchocarpus costaricensis, Lonchocarpus oliganthus, and Hampea appendiculata as larval food but are not monophagous. They appear to be an intermediate stage in lineage sorting and might be considered one or two subspecies if the two most distinct lineages are split off as species. The other lineages show a marked lack of agreement between morphological, ecological and genetical variation in the reanalysis of the supposed clusters. The entire range of caterpillar colors and patterns is found across one huge ill-structured cluster of genetic diversity. They are polyphagous, feeding preferentially on Inga and Senna as well as a variety of other plants, but apparently not on those preferred by the more distinct lineages except Hampea appendiculata. The proposed divergence times for the lineages are derived from a standard molecular clock model, which is today known to be incorrect.

It is obtained as an intermediate in the recovery of tungsten from its minerals. Tungsten ores are treated with alkalis to produce WO3. Further reaction with carbon or hydrogen gas reduces tungsten trioxide to the pure metal. :2 WO3 \\\\+ 3 C → 2 W + 3 CO2 (high temperature) :WO3 \\\\+ 3 H2 → W + 3 H2O (550 - 850 °C) Tungsten(VI) oxide occurs naturally in the form of hydrates, which include minerals: tungstite WO3·H2O, meymacite WO3·2H2O and hydrotungstite (of the same composition as meymacite, however sometimes written as H2WO4). These minerals are rare to very rare secondary tungsten minerals. History In 1841, a chemist named Robert Oxland gave the first procedures for preparing tungsten trioxide and sodium tungstate. He was granted patents for his work soon after, and is considered to be the founder of systematic tungsten chemistry. Preparation Tungsten trioxide can be prepared in several different ways. CaWO4, or scheelite, is allowed to react with HCl to produce tungstic acid, which decomposes to WO3 and water at high temperatures. :CaWO4 \\\\+ 2 HCl → CaCl2 \\\\+ H2WO4 :H2WO4 → + WO3 Another common way to synthesize WO3 is by calcination of ammonium paratungstate (APT) under oxidizing conditions: :(NH4)10[H2W12O42] → 12 WO3 \\\\+ 10 NH3 \\\\+ 10 Structure and properties The crystal structure of tungsten trioxide is temperature dependent. It is tetragonal at temperatures above 740 °C, orthorhombic from 330 to 740 °C, monoclinic from 17 to 330 °C, triclinic from -50 to 17 °C, and monoclinic again at temperatures below -50 °C.H. A. Wriedt: The O-W (oxygen- tungsten) system. In: Bulletin of Alloy Phase Diagrams. 10, 1989, S. 368, . The most common structure of WO3 is monoclinic with space group P21/n. Tungsten trioxide is a strong oxidizing agent: it reacts with rare-earth elements, iron, copper, aluminium, manganese, zinc, chromium, molybdenum, carbon, hydrogen and silver, being reduced to pure tungsten metal. Reaction with gold and platinum reduces it to the dioxide. :WO3 \\\\+ 2 Fe → W + Fe2O3 :2WO3 \\\\+ Pt → 2 WO2 \\\\+ PtO2 Uses Tungsten trioxide is used for many purposes in everyday life.

The composite showed a modest hydrogen production performance. In 2016, shape controlled tungsten trioxide semiconductors were obtained by the means of hydrothermal synthesis. From these semiconductors composite systems were prepared with commercial TiO2. These composite systems showed a higher photocatalysis activity than the commercial TiO2 (Evonik Aeroxide P25) towards phenol and methyl orange degradation.Székely, I., et al. Synthesis of shape-tailored WO3 micro-/nanocrystals and the photocatalytic activity of WO3/TiO2 composites (2016) Materials, 9 (4).Baia, L., et al. Preparation of TiO2/WO3 composite photocatalysts by the adjustment of the semiconductors' surface charge (2016) Materials Science in Semiconductor Processing, 42, pp. 66-71 Recently, some research groups have demonstrated that non-metal surface such as transition metal oxides (WO3, TiO2, Cu2O, MoO3, and ZnO etc.) could serve as a potential candidate for surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy substrates and their performance could be comparable or even higher than those of commonly used noble-metal elements. There are two basic mechanisms for this application. One is that the Raman signal enhancement was tuned by charge transfer between the dye molecules and the substrate WO3 materials. The other is to use the electrical tuning of the defect density in the WO3 materials by the oxide leakage current control in order to modulate the enhancement factor of the SERS effect.

Between 1999 and 2002, the league was part of the Northern League after the two leagues agreed to merge. The league was superseded by the Canadian American Association of Professional Baseball, which its members joined for the 2005 season. Early history For the first season, six teams played and were all based in southern and central New York. Albany (Albany Diamond Dogs), Glens Falls (Adirondack Lumberjacks), Yonkers (Yonkers Hoot Owls), Newburgh (Newburgh Night Hawks), Little Falls (Mohawk Valley Landsharks) and Mountaindale (Sullivan Mountain Lions) were all given teams and Albany won the first league championship in a 68-game season.https://www.baseball- reference.com/minors/league.cgi?id=9c513c59 For 1996, things changed slightly. The Mountain Lions were sold to a new ownership group who renamed them the Catskill Cougars and moved them to the North Atlantic League while the Landsharks moved to West Warwick, Rhode Island, expanding the league into New England as the team became the Rhode Island Tiger Sharks. The Hoot Owls also folded and the league added a second New England team, the Bangor Blue Ox, and added Maine to its footprint in place of Yonkers. To replace the Mountain Lions/Cougars, an expansion team was granted to Elmira, New York, which had lost its New York–Penn League team when the Boston Red Sox chose to move the team to Massachusetts and rename them the Lowell Spinners. Like every other professional baseball team to play in Elmira since 1923, the expansion team was named the Pioneers.https://www.baseball- reference.com/minors/league.cgi?id=982437de Albany won the league title again.http://www.rauzulusstreet.com/baseball/minors/northerneastchamps.htm In 1997 the league expanded to eight teams and switched to a two-division format. Newburgh and Rhode Island folded after the 1996 season. As the result of the disbanding of the North Atlantic League Catskill rejoined the Northeast League and the Lynn, Massachusetts-based Massachusetts Mad Dogs followed them. Meanwhile, the league expanded into Waterbury, Connecticut and Allentown, Pennsylvania with the Waterbury Spirit and Allentown Ambassadors. The league was won by the Elmira Pioneers.https://www.baseball- reference.com/minors/league.cgi?id=146d9fb7 For 1998, the Diamond Dogs added the name of their actual home town, Colonie, to their name and became known as the Albany-Colonie Diamond Dogs. Bangor's team folded and the team's place was taken by the expansion New Jersey Jackals, who played in a then-unfinished Yogi Berra Stadium in Little Falls, New Jersey on the campus of Montclair State University. The new franchise won the Northeast League championship in their first season. After the season, prior to the merger with the Northern League, the Catskill franchise again folded. The Cougars would return as a member of the Northern League East in 2000 but would not last beyond that season. After the merger After the four-year merger, the Northeast League returned to its status as a separate entity following the 2002 season. In that time, Northeast League teams won all four league titles as the Diamond Dogs, Lumberjacks, and Jackals defeated their Northern League opponents. The league returned to play in 2003 with eight teams. Elmira, Allentown, and New Jersey rejoined the league as they had left it. The Adirondack Lumberjacks relocated to Bangor, returning a team to Maine for the first time since the Blue Ox folded. Joining them were two Northern League expansion teams and two revived franchises. In 1999 and 2002, the Northern League expanded into Quebec City, Quebec and Brockton, Massachusetts and these two teams, Québec Capitales and the Brockton Rox, became part of the revived Northeast League. Meanwhile, in 1999 and 2000, the Massachusetts Mad Dogs and the Waterbury Spirit franchises went dormant. The Mad Dogs were bought by Jonathan Fleisig, who moved the team to Pittsfield, Massachusetts where they played in Wahconah Park as the Berkshire Black Bears. Nicholas Lopardo, meanwhile, bought the remnants of the Spirit and relaunched the team as the North Shore Spirit in the Mad Dogs' old home of Lynn, Massachusetts at Fraser Field.https://www.baseball- reference.com/minors/league.cgi?id=effe1991 After the Rox won the 2003 league title, Berkshire moved to New Haven, Connecticut as the New Haven County Cutters while Allentown folded and were replaced by a traveling team, the Northeast League Aces. The 2004 season, proving to be the final Northeast League season, New Jersey defeated North Shore in the league championship series. New Jersey, Brockton, North Shore, New Haven, Quebec, and Elmira became part of the Canadian American Association of Professional Baseball (or Can-Am League) along with an expansion franchise in Worcester, Massachusetts and a traveling team formed when Bangor's charter for the new league was rescinded. As of 2017, four Northeast League teams still exist. New Jersey and Quebec continue to be members of the Can-Am League. Elmira and Brockton both left the league to become collegiate summer league teams.

Briggs (June 25, 1821 – January 11, 1899) was a leader in the early history of the Latter Day Saint movement and was instrumental in bringing about the 1860 \\"Reorganization\\" of the church, which resulted in the establishment of the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints. Early membership Jason William Briggs was born on June 25, 1821 in Pompey, New York to Hugh Lackey Briggs (1794–1874) and Polly Briggs (née Damon; 1796–1890). His ancestry was mainly from England. In 1841 at Potosi, Wisconsin he was baptized into the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints by William O. Clark. By 1842, Briggs had been ordained an elder of the church and he organized and became the head of a branch in Beloit, Wisconsin. By 1843, Briggs had organized a second branch in Waukesha, Wisconsin. In 1844, the movement's founder, Joseph Smith, was killed and a succession crisis ensued. Brigham Young, president of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles assumed control of the church's headquarters in Nauvoo, Illinois. Briggs became convinced that Young's organization had fallen into apostasy and by 1846 he and his branches affiliated with James J. Strang who had organized a new church headquarters in nearby Voree, Wisconsin. Briggs was a fervent opponent of polygamy, and when Strang began to practice plural marriage openly, Briggs broke with his organization. He affiliated briefly with William Smith's organization of the church before learning that William, too, had been practicing plural marriage. \\"New Organization\\" After these set-backs, Briggs despaired that the Latter Day Saint movement had irrevocably fallen into iniquity. He later reported that November 18, 1851, on the prairie near Beloit, he was pondering this concern when the \\"Spirit of the Lord\\" came upon him and spoke, saying: :Verily, verily, saith the Lord, even Jesus Christ unto his servant, Jason W. Briggs, concerning the church: Behold I have not cast off my people; neither have I changed in regard to Zion. Yea, verily, my people shall be redeemed, and my law shall be kept which I revealed unto my servant Joseph Smith... According to Briggs, the Lord further explained that \\"in mine own due time will I call upon the seed of Joseph Smith,\\" (i.e., one of his sons), \\"and will bring one forth, and he shall be mighty and strong, and he shall preside over the high priesthood of my Church...\\" And finally, Briggs said the Lord assured him \\"that which ye received as my celestial law,\\" (i.e., plural marriage), \\"is not of me, but is the doctrine of Baalam.\\" After reporting that he received this guidance, Briggs began to coordinate with leaders of branches in Wisconsin and Illinois, including Zenos H. Gurley, Sr. who resolved with him to wait for a leader to be raised up \\"from the seed of Joseph.\\" They began to establish a \\"New Organization\\" of the church and Briggs was called to preside over its first conference on June 12, 1852 in Beloit. In 1853, Briggs was called as an Apostle and sustained as President of the Quorum of the Twelve and as the \\"Representative President of the Church.\\" Important leaders including William Marks and Aaron Smith (former leader of a Strangite schismatic group) joined the movement. On April 6, 1860 at a General Conference of the New Organization of the church in Amboy, Illinois, Joseph Smith III joined with the group and was sustained to follow in his father's role as President of the Church. Disagreements and disfellowship By 1885, Briggs was out of harmony with Joseph Smith III. Briggs was theological liberal and was aware of \\"higher criticism\\" of the Bible being taught at the time in German universities. Like these German scholars, Briggs believed that Scripture was contextually understood and that revelation was never a final process, but progressively revealed over time. Such views angered more conservative members. Briggs also attacked the idea of the pre-existence of souls, then a cherished doctrine; he also questioned whether the church should again attempt a gathered community due to the disastrous results in Joseph Smith's lifetime. While many of Joseph Smith III's actual positions mirrored Briggs's thoughts, Briggs presented them more stridently than Smith ever did. Furthermore, Briggs angered Joseph Smith III by his constant reminders that Joseph Smith had practiced polygamy, contrary to what Joseph Smith III believed. In addition, Briggs sparred with Smith over who should be allowed to print their views in the RLDS periodical, the True Latter Day Saints' Herald.. At the 1885 RLDS conference, Briggs was not sustained in his position as Apostle and in 1886 he withdrew from the Reorganization. Briggs died on January 11, 1899 near Denver, Colorado.

Responding to pressure from Moog Music to create a portable, affordable (the Minimoog was US$1,495 upon release) \\"performance\\" synthesizer, ARP Instruments, Inc. scaled down its ARP 2600 synthesizer and created the Odyssey, which became one of their best-selling synthesizer models. There were several versions of the Odyssey over the years, and it was reissued by Korg in early 2015, in cooperation with the original designer and ARP co-founder, David Friend. The ARP Odyssey was used as the lead for Peter Howell's incarnation of the Doctor Who theme.http://www.warpedfactor.com/2015/01/the-composers-of-doctor-who- peter-howell.html Design The Odyssey is a two-oscillator analog synthesizer, and one of the first with duophonic capabilities (the ability to play two notes at the same time). All parameters, including a resonant low- pass filter, a non-resonant high-pass filter, ADSR and AR envelopes, a sine and square wave LFO, and a sample-and-hold function are controllable with sliders and switches on the front panel. Features *Switchable between sawtooth, square, and pulse waveforms with oscillator sync, a \\"ring modulator\\", and pink or white noise. (As with the Korg MS-20, the \\"ring modulator\\" is actually a logical exclusive-OR between the two VCOs' pulse waves.) *Pulse-width can be modulated manually or with the LFO or the ADSR envelope generator. There is a (static) high-pass filter, as well as a voltage controlled low-pass self-oscillating filter. *The filter can be controlled by either of the two envelope generators, an ADSR (attack, decay, sustain, release) and a simple AR (attack, release) and modulated by the LFO, sample- and-hold, the keyboard, or a separate CV (pedal) input on the back panel. *The Sample/Hold input mixer can be used to route the output of the VCOs to the FM input of VCO 2 and the VCF, enabling audio frequency FM.  ARP Odyssey models =Odyssey Mk I (Model 2800) ARP Odyssey Mark I ARP Odyssey Mk1 - black/gold version ARP Odysseys produced between 1972 and 1975, referred to as Mark I, were white-faced Odysseys that used a 2-pole voltage-controlled filter, which were similar to Oberheim SEM modules. Some late models used a black and gold color scheme and include CV/gate jacks like the later Mark II's. These earlier units contained a greater number of internal adjustments and were slightly more difficult to calibrate. Odyssey Mk II (Model 2810-5) ARP Odyssey Mark II Odyssey Mark II's were produced between 1975 and 1978. They are largely similar to Mark I's; the main differences are the use of the black and gold color scheme and the inclusion of CV/gate in all models. These models also use a four-pole VCF, which were similar in design to Moog's four-pole filter. Subsequent models, however, use a different four-pole low-pass filter designed by ARP, the 4075 filter. A later filter with a similar design, the 4072, was used in the 2600, Omni, Axxe, Solus, and other ARP instruments. Odyssey Mk III (Model 2820-2823) The Mark III was introduced in 1978. Mark III's are also the most common models of the Odyssey. The Mark III used ARP's four-pole \\"4075\\" filter. While earlier models had used a simple rotary knob to control pitch bend, The Mark III introduced proportional pitch control (PPC). PPC used pressure-sensitive buttons to control bend up, bend down, and vibrato. ARP included PPC on other instruments, and also offered a kit to add PPC to earlier Odyssey synthesizers. Mark III Odysseys also have unbalanced XLR outputs, in addition to unbalanced 1/4\\" outputs. The Mark III was cosmetically overhauled to feature a redesigned chassis and orange and black color scheme, which was consistent with other contemporary ARP instruments. Production of the Odyssey Mark III ceased when ARP Instruments declared bankruptcy in 1981. Korg ARP Odyssey ARP Odyssey reissued by Korg in 2015 The ARP Odyssey was reissued by Korg in 2015. The new Odyssey's analog signal path is similar to the original, with some additional modern features: * MIDI input and USB MIDI connectivity * a separate headphone output and balanced XLR output * a new \\"drive\\" switch to add distortion to the voltage-controlled amplifier. * includes the three filter circuits from the original Odyssey models, with the ability to switch between them * Ability to switch between two portamento behaviors from the original models. The color scheme is similar to the Mark III, although Mark I and II styles were available in limited editions. All of Korg's reissues use the PPC. The Korg ARP Odyssey is 86% of the size of the original ARP models. The keyboard is similarly reduced in size, and referred to as “Slim Keys” by Korg. Korg ARP Odyssey Module A Korg ARP Odyssey module Similar in size to the panel of Korg’s reissued Odyssey keyboard. Includes minor MIDI implementation improvements. Korg ARP Odyssey FS A limited edition, full-size reproduction of the original Odyssey, available in all three classic ARP colour schemes. ARP Odyssei On Nov 1, 2016 Korg announced the Arp Odyssei for iOS. Behringer Odyssey In August 2019, Behringer began shipping their Odyssey clone. The Behringer Odyssey features a full-size 37-key keyboard and multiple versions of the filter based on several ARP Odyssey models. They have also included an arpeggiator, a 32-step sequencer with on-board storage, an effects bank, and an all-metal case that resembles the ARP Odyssey Mark III.

He was the first President of the short-lived independent Crimean People's Republic, established on November 26 (December 9 under the Gregorian Calendar), 1917. He is known for having written the poem \\"Ant etkenmen\\" (\\"I've pledged\\"), which became the Crimean Tatar national anthem. His early death at the hands of Bolshevik forces during the Russian Civil War is still commemorated in the Crimean Tatar nation. Biography Noman Çelebicihan was born in 1885, in the village of Büyük Sonaq, in Chonhar region of Crimea near the present-day city of Dzhankoy. Today the village does not exist and in 1948–68 was known as Chirik village within the Zavet Lenin rural council. His father's name was İbraim Çelebi, a member of a well-to-do Crimean Tatar family. His mother also was from a well-to-do family, daughter of Cihanşah Çelebi. He received his early education in his village. Afterwards, due to lack of opportunity, Çelebicihan was sent to Gülümbey Medrese, one of the well known madrassas of that time, with the help of his uncles. Later on he was sent to Constantinople to further his education. Noman Çelebicihan arrived in Istanbul, Ottoman Empire in 1908. He attended Vefa Lisesi (High School) and later Law School. He resided in Karagümrük section of Constantinople where a small group of Crimean Tatar students lived. One of the first organizations he founded, while a student in Constantinople, was \\"Yaş Tatar Yazıcılar Cıyını\\" (Young Tatar Writers' Association). He founded this association with his friend Abibulla Temircan in 1910 and published his first literary works such as Qarılğaçlar Duası (Swallows' Prayer), Altın Yarıq (Golden Light) and Şiirler Cönkü (Collection of Poems). He was one of the original founders of \\"Crimean Tatar Student Association\\" and also \\"Vatan\\" (Homeland), which became the seed for the political organization Milliy Fırqa (National Party) to carry on the independent movement in Crimea during the most turbulent period in its history. After graduating from Law School, Çelebicihan returned to Crimea to get involved in the independence movement, and was elected to represent the Or region of Crimea in the Crimean Tatar Qurultay. He was one of the most popular delegates because of his young age and education he received in Istanbul. In 1917 he founded the Milliy Fırqa and later that year, during the opening of the Qurultay on November 26, 1917, Noman Çelebicihan was elected the first president of the young Crimean Republic. Çelebicihan was not only the first president of the independent Crimean People's Republic and Mufti of Crimea, Lithuania and Poland he was also a poet and writer. In addition to his aforementioned works, his poems such as Ant Etkenmen (I've Pledged), Bastırıq (Prison), Ay gidi... (Oh for...), Savlıqman Qal Tatarlıq! (Farewell(Stay with health) Tatarness!), Yolcu Ğarip (Poor Traveler), and Tilkiden Selâm (Greetings from the Fox) are his most popular poems. Ant Etkenmen became the lyrics of the Crimean Tatar national anthem, and according to Şevki Bektöre (another Crimean Tatar poet), \\"... was sung for the first time during the historic Qurultay (1917)....\\" His most memorable poem, however, is Savlıqman Qal Tatarlıq!, which he scribbled on the walls of Simferopol train station on his way to report to military service during World War I. In January 1918, barely two months after he was elected to lead his nation at the Qurultay of the Crimean Tatar people, the Bolshevik forces invaded Crimea. He was arrested and imprisoned in Sevastopol. On February 23, a firing squad of the Black Sea Fleet executed him and threw his body into the sea.

Some writers and authors' advocates have accused the company of being a vanity press while representing itself as a \\"traditional publisher\\". It changed its name in 2014, and since 2017 it has stopped accepting new authors. PublishAtlantica was an imprint of PublishAmerica. PublishAtlantica was headquartered in the UK in Milton Keynes. It was formerly PublishBritannica before a lawsuit from Encyclopædia Britannica. PublishIcelandica was another imprint of PublishAmerica. According to a letter from PublishAmerica in 2006, neither imprint is active.  History  , the executive director of PublishAmerica was Miranda N. Prather. In 2004, Prather said that 80% of authors who submitted manuscripts to the house were rejected, and that the house had \\"30 full-time editors\\" with plans to expand. She refused to identify the CEO of PublishAmerica. In 2005, the company had 70 full-time employees of various functions. In 2004, PublishAmerica published small runs of over 4,800 titles. In 2005, the company had approximately 11,000 authors under contract. In June 2005, PublishAmerica identified Willem Meiners as \\"PublishAmerica CEO\\" and Clopper as \\"company president\\". In August 2005, PublishAmerica was sued by Encyclopædia Britannica for trademark violation over PublishAmerica's PublishBritannica imprint. The matter was settled out of court, with PublishAmerica agreeing to stop using the \\"PublishBritannica\\" name. However, PublishAmerica continued to use the website address on letterhead as late as 2008. In late September 2005, PublishAmerica announced its books would be returnable by the bookseller if they failed to sell, a standard practice among other commercial publishers. The announcement stated that this applied to \\"all\\" of its books, though it noted that there would be \\"a few exceptions initially\\" and that the offer would apply to United States booksellers only. In 2009 PA's site said that \\"many of our books are returnable.\\" Prather left PublishAmerica (renamed America Star Books) in 2016. Criticism PA pays advance fees of US$1–$1,000 to its authors, provides minimal editing, and provides few of the services handled by trade publishing, such as retail distribution, marketing and media relations. Disgruntled authors told Publishers Weekly that PA did not pay royalties owed to them, sold books it no longer had any rights to sell, set unreasonably high list prices and lower-than-average discounts for authors to buy their own books, and either neglected or failed to place books into bookstores. PublishAmerica's Prather stated that book prices reflected \\"what the market would bear\\" and that \\"we don't control the bookstores in the country.\\" Other PublishAmerica authors have spoken out in support of the publisher, denying it is a vanity press and highlighting the opportunities it gives to unpublished authors. Acceptance of hoax manuscripts In an attempt to demonstrate a lack of editorial oversight at PublishAmerica, several authors have written \\"sting\\" manuscripts. For instance, in December 2004, PublishAmerica agreed to publish the novel Atlanta Nights, which was later revealed to be a deliberately badly written hoax, featuring every \\"bad writing\\" trope the authors could conceive of and one chapter randomly generated by a computer. PublishAmerica also accepted another author's manuscript that featured the same 30 pages repeated ten times. 2005 Arbitration case In December 2005, PublishAmerica author Philip Dolan, who had spent between US$7,000 and $13,000 promoting his book, learned that no book stores were able to order copies of it. He took PublishAmerica to arbitration for breach of contract. Dolan also alleged accounting irregularities: despite a clause in his contract allowing him to inspect PublishAmerica's accounts, his accountant was denied access. Dolan received royalties for fewer copies of his book than he was able to account for having sold himself. He was awarded an unspecified amount in compensation for PublishAmerica's breach of contract, and his contract was rescinded. Lawsuit In June 2012, a class action lawsuit was filed in Maryland District federal court against PublishAmerica LLLP, by plaintiffs Darla Yoos, Edwin McCall, and Kerry Levine. New name In January 2014, PublishAmerica changed its name to America Star Books. In 2017, America Star Books became ASB Promotions and ceased accepting new authors.

Most of the houses were occupied by 1840. The square takes its name from one of the Duke of Westminster's subsidiary titles, Viscount Belgrave. The village and former manor house of Belgrave, Cheshire were among the rural landholdings associated with the main home and gardens of the senior branch of the family, Eaton Hall. Today, many embassies occupy buildings on all four sides. History The north-east side of Belgrave Square, soon after construction Statue of Prince Henry the Navigator in Belgrave Square, erected in 2002 The square is perfectly across, inclusive of small porch projections. It essentially four terraces, each of eleven grand white stuccoed houses save for cream-coloured projecting corner houses, apart from the south-east terrace, divided into twelve; detached mansions are in three corners; and a private central garden. Numbering is anticlockwise from the north: NW terrace, №s1 to 11; west corner mansion, №12; SW terrace, №s13 to 23; south corner mansion, №24; SE terrace. №s25 to 36; east corner mansion, №37; NE terrace №s38 to 48. Slightly later north corner mansion №49 was drawn up by Cubitt (not to be confused with his son George, another architect, ennobled as Lord Ashcombe) for Sidney Herbert in 1851. The terraces were designed by George Basevi -- their level of praise such as listed building category is more common among noble families own 'town house' London houses rather than the speculative building leases which saw their creation. The largest corner mansion, №37 (Seaford House), was designed by Philip Hardwick. №12 was designed by Robert Smirke. The square features statues of Christopher Columbus, Simón Bolívar, José de San Martín, Prince Henry the Navigator and the 1st Marquess of Westminster, a bust of George Basevi, and a sculpture entitled Homage to Leonardo by Italian sculptor Enzo Plazzotta. From its construction until the Second World War the square saw building rentals and longer leases by the upper echelons of capitalists seeking further influence, status or socialising in the capital. Such success was immediate. This was encapsulated by the decision of another of London's leading freeholders and estate planners, the Duke of Bedford, to choose №6 as London accommodation rather than any house on his own Bloomsbury, which had lost its aristocratic cachet.Page 75, London in the 19th Century, Jerry White (2007). The square has hosted embassies since its first century, which has increased, including the German Embassy, which occupies three houses on the west sides. During World War II, the square was used as a tank park; afterwards most of the houses were converted into offices for charities and institutes. The 21st century has seen more domestic leases, such as three by the Grosvenor Estate in 2004. The present Duke of Westminster co-administers and enjoys a stake in billion-pound family trusts as the lease- encumbered freeholder i.e. reversioner, entitled to the ground rents and lease renewal premiums, of the family estate, which is largely intact, stretching from the Thames to Marble Arch and the remainder of Oxford Street but which omits Victoria Station, St James's and Buckingham Palace. Listed status=Grade I The buildings on the square are listed. In this highest category are: *the Spanish Embassy at №24, *№s1–11 *№12 *№s13–23 *№s25–36 *№s38–48 are listed Grade I.

It is the only building of those used by the Austro-Hungarian Empire's Foreign Service that is still used today by diplomats of the Republic of Austria. Between 1846 and 1851, it was inhabited by Sir Francis Egerton (born Leveson-Gower), the 1st Earl of Ellesmere, and his family. Owing to the rebuilding of Cleveland House in St. James's, which would be renamed Bridgewater House, the Earl was also forced to house his famed \\"Bridgewater Collection of Pictures\\" here, using bedrooms, dining rooms, hallways, etc.As described in Art-Union vol ix (1847), p. 8-12, 49-52.

Lord Pirrie was the chairman of Harland and Wolff, a leading shipbuilding firm located in Belfast, Ireland. One evening in July 1907, the Pirries hosted J. Bruce Ismay and his wife Florence for dinner. Ismay was the managing director of the White Star Line, one of the top shipping companies of the North Atlantic. Harland and Wolff constructed all White Star vessels. White Star's main rival was the Cunard Line. The Cunard Line's newest ships, the and , the largest ships in the world, had just entered service. Pirrie and Ismay discussed the new ships during the dinner, and how to counter the competition of these new ships. Their discussions led to them planning that night the construction of three ships, larger than any in the world. The names of these ships would be , and . 25 Belgrave Square has been the Embassy of Norway since 1949. 28 Belgrave Square was the home of Robert Carew, 3rd Baron Carew, who died there on 29 April 1923.

Redondo Beach collection #21 ממשת transliterations into English * Mameshat (Yeivin, 1961) * mamsatt (Ginsberg, 1948) * Mamschat (Galling, 1937) * Mamshat (Sellers and Albright, 1931) * Mamshath (Conder, 1901) * Mamshet (Aharoni, 1960) * Mamshit (Vilnay, 1960) * Mamshith (Driver, 1909) * Memsath (McCown, 1947) * Memshat (Bliss, 1900) * Memshath (Macalister, 1905) * Mimshat (Macalister, 1925) A place? Charles Warren excavated the first two specimens in the original 1868–1869 excavations at Jerusalem (Warren, 1870); however, those were both only partial impressions showing the final two letters ST. The first complete inscription was published by Frederick Jones Bliss after excavating it from Tell Ej- Judeideh (Bliss, 1900), later determined to be biblical Moresheth-Gath. Beginning then, here is a list of all the ancient sites scholars have associated with it: * Moresheth-Gath (Clermont-Ganneau, 1899) * Mampsis (also known as Kurnub; Hommel, 1901) * Mareshah (Vincent, 1907) * Tel Masos (see French article Tel Masos in French Wikipedia; also known as Tell el-Meshash or Khirbat al-Mishash; Abel, 1938) * An unknown site near Gezer such as Emmaus (Albright, 1943) * Jerusalem (via MMS[L]T) or one of its suburbs (Ginsberg, 1948) * Tel 'Erani (Yeivin, 1961) * Tel 'Ira (see French article Tel Ira in French Wikipedia; Yadin, 1961) * An unknown site between Bethlehem & Hebron (Lang, 1972); Bethlehem vicinity preferred (Rainey, 1982) * An unknown site between Beth Shemesh & Aijalon such as Emmaus (Lang, 1972) * Emmaus (also known as Amwas; Lemaire, 1975) * Ramat Rachel (Barkay, 1993) These proposals fall into two main streams of thought. One philosophical school places MMST in a geographical region based on the identification of three other regions surrounding Hebron, Sokho, and Ziph (the other words on the LMLK seals). The chief problem is that the majority of the seal impressions were not found in any particular region associated with one of the four inscriptions. For example, the majority of HBRN stamps were found at Lachish significantly to the west. An alternative strategy identifies MMST in the vicinity of Jerusalem (which includes Ramat Rachel) based upon the datum that the majority of MMST stamps were excavated in and around there. The chief problem is that there were more HBRN stamps than MMST found at Jerusalem and more Z(Y)F stamps than MMST found at Ramat Rachel (Grena, 2004, pp. 354–360). In further support of a place name interpretation is the notion that MMST was lost from the Hebrew Masoretic text, but preserved via a corrupt Greek transliteration in the Septuagint version of the Book of Joshua (; Rainey, 1982, p. 59): * Theco * Ephratha (Baethleem) * Phagor * Aetan * Culon * Tatam * Thobes * Carem * Galem * Thether * Manocho A person? In 1905 Robert Alexander Stewart Macalister suggested that MMST meant Mareshah, but instead of identifying it with the town, he proposed that the seal referred to a potter (or family of potters). A proclamation? If the LMLK seal inscriptions were votive slogans or mottoes instead of geographical places, MMST may share the same etymological root as MMSLTW (Strong's Concordance #4475), a Hebrew word used in the Bible translated alternately as domain, dominion, force, government, power, realm, responsibility, rule. (See , , , , , , , .) The parallel passage found in and deserves special attention for its association of the word in the same chronological context as the LMLK seals: :And Hezekiah was attentive to them, and showed them all the house of his treasures--the silver and gold, the spices and precious ointment, and all his armory--all that was found among his treasures. There was nothing in his house or in all his dominion that Hezekiah did not show them. Likewise : :After this Sennacherib king of Assyria sent his servants to Jerusalem (but he and all the forces with him laid siege against Lachish), to Hezekiah king of Judah, and to all Judah who were in Jerusalem... Note that Ginsberg suspected such a literal reading of the inscription in a paper presented in 1945, but changed to the geographic association with Jerusalem in 1948. Note also the well-known Moabite inscription from Kerak that begins with the fragmented phrase ...MSYT MLK. While we may never know if the first word is a compound of KMS, the Moabite deity mentioned in the Bible as Chemosh, the MMST on the LMLK seals may have been \\"MMSYT\\" written scriptio defectiva with a possible relation to \\"mumsa\\" in the Arabic language.

In 1997, several developers, including DreamWorks Interactive and Appaloosa Interactive, produced various games for nine different platforms to coincide with the release of the film, The Lost World: Jurassic Park. For the 2001 film, Jurassic Park III, a total of seven games were produced, including three games for the Game Boy Advance and three PC games. Lego Jurassic World, released in 2015, is based on each of the series' four films, including Jurassic World. Since 1994, a number of other video games that are not based directly on any of the films have also been released. Jurassic Park (1993) Ocean Software released three distinct Jurassic Park games optimized for different platforms, while Sega released four distinct versions of Jurassic Park for five different platforms. In each version, the player has to complete several objectives to finish the game and escape the island of Isla Nublar. Ocean SoftwareNintendo versions= Jurassic Park, released for the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) and Nintendo's Game Boy, is an action- adventure game played from an overhead perspective, with various goals that loosely follow the plot of the film. The Game Boy version is a port of the NES version, and features the addition of a database with information about six of the game's dinosaurs. The NES version was released in July 1993. The Game Boy version was originally scheduled for release in July 1993, but was not released until August 1993. Nintendo Power, reviewing the Game Boy version, wrote negatively, \\"Aiming can be awkward because the gun is offset on your shoulder and doesn't shoot straight in front of you,\\" but positively wrote, \\"Good graphics and fun game play. You really get a sense of the movie danger.\\" Another variation was the Super NES version of Jurassic Park, which incorporates isometric gameplay for outside environments but uses a first person perspective for indoor environments. Objectives include turning on the park's power system and rebooting the main computers, as well as collecting raptor eggs. The Super NES version of Jurassic Park also incorporated four- channel Dolby Pro Logic surround sound. The Nintendo versions include elements from the novel that were not used in the film. The NES/Game Boy version includes a raft level, similar to a scene from the novel. Another level requires the player to destroy Velociraptor nests with bombs, similar to a novel scene in which characters infiltrate a Velociraptor nest while armed with nerve gas grenades. In the Super NES version, the player must use a nerve gas bomb rather than explosive bombs to destroy the nest. Another objective in the Super NES version, taken from the novel, is to prevent velociraptors from escaping to the mainland on a ship. =PC version= Ocean also released a PC version of Jurassic Park for DOS and Amiga. As in the Super NES version, the PC version also features isometric and first-person shooter perspectives. SegaGenesis= Sega published a side-scrolling platformer action game titled Jurassic Park for the Sega Genesis. Developed by BlueSky Software, the game can be played in two modes, either as Dr. Alan Grant or as a Velociraptor. Playing as each provides the user with an alternative story and different levels. =Game Gear/Master System= Another version of the game, developed and published by Sega, was released for the Sega Master System and Sega Game Gear in 1993. The game is an action-based side-scrolling platformer, like the Genesis version. Unlike the Genesis version, Grant is the only playable character. In addition, this version of Jurassic Park features driving levels. The Master System version was released exclusively in Europe and Brazil. The Game Gear version – scheduled for release in September 1993 – features five areas of Isla Nublar, with three levels in each area, for a total of 15 levels. The player can play the first four areas in any order, but cannot access the final area – Jurassic Park's Visitor Center – until the other four are completed. Each area begins with a driving level. At the end of each area is a boss enemy, such as Brachiosaurus, Pteranodon, Triceratops, and Velociraptor. The player is armed with three non-lethal weapons: a stun gun, an aerial stun weapon, and gas grenades. Medical kits can be collected to refill the player's health bar, while bottles can be collected to expand the health bar. The Master System version also features five areas, with locations including mountains and a forest. The fifth area is only accessible upon collecting all of the hidden Jurassic Park logos in each of the earlier areas. In both versions, Jurassic Park is opened to the public upon completion of the game. Four reviewers for Electronic Gaming Monthly praised the Game Gear version for its graphics, although two of the reviewers were not enthusiastic about the driving levels. Sega Visions wrote, \\"Even without the hot Jurassic Park license, this portable action game would stand on its own with solid graphics and game play.\\" Mean Machines magazine gave the Game Gear version a rating of 35 out of 100 and criticized the game for a lack of levels and variety, as well as, \\"Awful sampled roars and instantly forgettable music.\\" Cyril Lachel of DefunctGames.com gave the Master System version a \\"D\\" rating and called it \\"one of the worst-playing 2D action games you'll ever see.\\" Lachel criticized the game's ineffective weapons and wrote that, \\"The real sin of the game is that the dinosaurs tend to attack you from off the screen, which means that you'll take a lot of cheap hits before making it to an even cheaper boss. [...] On the bright side each of the levels are unique and (for the most part) interesting.\\" Lachel concluded, \\"With its terrible controls, boring levels and entirely too difficult boss battles, this is one park you don't want to visit. This is not the worst Jurassic Park game on the market, but it sure comes close.\\" =Mega-CD/Sega CD= A 1994 point-and-click adventure game developed and published by Sega for the Sega CD (also known as the Mega-CD). The game's events take place after the film. The player controls a scientist who becomes stranded on Isla Nublar after a helicopter crash. The player must search the island to retrieve eggs from seven different dinosaur species and place them in an incubator at the Jurassic Park visitor center. =Arcade= In 1994, Sega released a rail shooter arcade game titled Jurassic Park. The game features missions that involve the player using a joystick to protect a vehicle by shooting any targets that appear on screen. The machine's cabinet resembles the rear of the film's Ford Explorer tour vehicles and contains hydraulic pistons to move the seat according to action on the screen. Sequels and other games (1994–1996) A sequel to the Sega Genesis version of Jurassic Park, entitled Jurassic Park: Rampage Edition, was released in 1994, and immediately follows the events of its predecessor. In it, Grant's helicopter crashes on Isla Nublar after taking off from the island. Now he must deal not only with dinosaurs, but InGen soldiers as well. As in the game's predecessor, the player can play as either Grant or a Velociraptor. Additionally, Universal Interactive released Jurassic Park Interactive exclusively on the 3DO Interactive Multiplayer in 1994. The game plays out through eight different minigames and features FMV segments starring look-alikes of the main characters. Also in 1994, Hi Tech Entertainment released Jurassic Park: Paint and Activity Center, a painting activity game for DOS. Ocean developed an action side-scrolling platform game titled Jurassic Park 2: The Chaos Continues and released it for the SNES and Game Boy in 1995. The SNES version uses an original story and is a sequel to the film, while the Game Boy version reuses the film's plot. In the SNES version, which takes place one year after the events of the film, the player controls Dr. Alan Grant, who is sent to Isla Nublar by John Hammond to prevent BioSyn (a rival genetics company) from stealing dinosaurs from the island. On August 12, 1996, Universal launched an online game titled Jurassic Park – The Ride Online Adventure, to promote Jurassic Park: The Ride. In the game, the player controls Jurassic Park's director of operations, who must stop an escaped Velociraptor that is wondering inside a compound, where the game takes place. The player must walk through hallways while avoiding the Velociraptor. The player must search in offices and other rooms for objects that can be used and combined with one another to stop the Velociraptor or gain entry to new areas. The game includes a feature known as the \\"IntraNet,\\" which contains files on the park's employees and records, as well as information on InGen and its dinosaurs. The Lost World: Jurassic Park (1997) To coincide with The Lost World: Jurassic Park, the second film in the movie series, studio DreamWorks utilized its internal software company, DreamWorks Interactive to create their own game. For the PlayStation and Sega Saturn, DreamWorks and Appaloosa Interactive developed The Lost World: Jurassic Park, a side-scrolling platformer portrayed in a totally 3D rendered environment. The game features five playable characters and 30 levels. In 1998, an updated version of The Lost World: Jurassic Park was released for the PlayStation, featuring various gameplay improvements. Appaloosa Interactive developed another version of The Lost World: Jurassic Park that was published by Sega for the Sega Genesis. Played from an overhead view, the game contains levels brought together by four hub areas on Isla Sorna and also contains four unique boss levels. It also has driveable vehicles, a large number of dinosaurs, and a GPS system used for mission objectives. Four versions of the game were developed and published by different companies for handheld game consoles, including Nintendo's Game Boy, Sega's Game Gear, and Tiger Electronics' Game.com and R-Zone consoles. ENGAGE games online, a multiplayer gaming website, announced in June 1997 that they had secured the exclusive online game rights for The Lost World: Jurassic Park through an agreement with Universal Studios. As in the films, the game was to be set on a tropical island of genetically engineered dinosaurs. In the game, the player's objective would be to capture one egg from six different dinosaur nests and return the eggs to a laboratory. The player would have to fight against dinosaurs such as Tyrannosaurus and Velociraptor, as well as other players trying to complete the same mission. Gameplay would consist of four teams, with up to 32 players. Availability of the game was to be announced later that year. At that time, a retail version of the game was not planned. DreamWorks also released Chaos Island: The Lost World, a strategy video game for the PC, with similar gameplay to Command & Conquer. The game is played across 12 levels, and involves the player creating dinosaurs that can be controlled and used against enemies. Six actors from the film provided their voice to the game. An arcade game titled The Lost World: Jurassic Park was also released by Sega, and made use of the then-powerful Model 3 arcade hardware. In 1998, a PC first person shooter game titled Trespasser was released, billed as a digital sequel to the film The Lost World: Jurassic Park. The game was highly ambitious and featured one of the first large scale physics engines in an action game. The developer was pushed by the publisher to ship it to coincide with the VHS release of The Lost World whether it was ready or not. This meant many elements of the planned game design were shelved and many bugs, some major, still remained in the game, resulting in negative critical reception. In April 2002, the game received a large modding community called TresCom, which released many patches and graphical updates for download on their forums. Warpath: Jurassic Park (1999) In 1999, DreamWorks released Warpath: Jurassic Park, a fighting game for the PlayStation, featuring 14 playable dinosaurs and arenas based on locations from the first two films. Jurassic Park III (2001) To coincide with the third film in the series, Jurassic Park III — the first film not based on a Michael Crichton novel and not directed by Steven Spielberg — a number of video games were released for the PC, arcade and Game Boy Advance. Knowledge Adventure developed and published two video games aimed primarily at a younger target audience: a side-scrolling platformer titled Jurassic Park III: Dino Defender; and Jurassic Park III: Danger Zone!, in which the player moves around on a virtual board game map. Later that year, Knowledge Adventure produced Scan Command: Jurassic Park, which utilized a portable barcode scanner accessory known as the Scan Command. A light gun arcade game titled Jurassic Park III was published by Konami and released in 2001. The game features a motion sensor system similar to that of Police 911. Also in 2001, Konami published three games for the Game Boy Advance, two of which were also developed by Konami: * Jurassic Park III: Island Attack was developed by Mobile21. The game is an isometric action-adventure game, where one plays as Dr. Alan Grant trying to escape Isla Sorna by traversing the 8 different game environments to reach a rescue boat. The game allows the player to choose to run from many of the enemies encountered, or collect and use items to destroy them. *Jurassic Park III: The DNA Factor is a side-scrolling platformer with many puzzle-solving elements. The game allows the player to play as either a professional photographer or pilot to search Isla Sorna for the DNA of dinosaurs. Each level involves fighting dinosaurs while searching for all of the DNA to open the exit. Then, using the collected DNA, the player must correctly create different species of dinosaurs, which becomes increasingly complex as the game progresses. *Jurassic Park III: Park Builder is a construction and management simulation game viewed from an omnipotent perspective. In the game, the player creates a virtual amusement park that includes rides, shops, food outlets, and dinosaur facilities. Announced in 2001, Jurassic Park: Survival was a third-person adventure game in development by Savage Entertainment for the PlayStation 2 and Xbox, as well as the GameCube and PC. However, due to conflicts with Vivendi Universal over payments, the game was canceled. Universal Studios Theme Parks Adventure (2001) In 2001, Universal Studios Theme Parks Adventure was released for the Nintendo GameCube. Based on many of the Universal theme park rides, the Jurassic Park ride requires the player to take control of a gun turret on the back of a Jeep to defend against dinosaurs. Jurassic Park: Dinosaur Battles (2002) A PC game titled Jurassic Park: Dinosaur Battles, also produced by Knowledge Adventure, was released on September 10, 2002. Dinosaur Battles is basically Scan Command: Jurassic Park without the portable scanner accessory. The game involves a group of young explorers stranded on Isla Sorna, where the evil Dr. Corts (voiced by Kath Soucie) has carried out experiments to control dinosaurs and pit them against each other for fights. The game features six playable creatures throughout the game, each one with six primary skills to defend against Corts' creatures. Before playing against enemies, the player must arrange pieces of dinosaur DNA to enable each creature's skills. Unlike Scan Command, which requires the player to scan barcodes to receive DNA, Dinosaur Battles presents the player with a list of more than 500 DNA pieces. The game primarily consists of the player controlling a creature from a top- down perspective while carrying out tasks such as locating certain facilities. During this portion of the game, enemy dinosaurs often randomly challenge the player to a battle. The player can fight or choose to abandon the battle. In 2018, Zack Zwiezen of Kotaku ranked the game among the \\"weirdest\\" Jurassic Park games ever released, stating that it was like Warpath: Jurassic Park but with an \\"unnecessary and weird\\" storyline and \\"less fun\\" combat. Jurassic Park: Operation Genesis (2003) In March 2003, Vivendi Universal Games released Jurassic Park: Operation Genesis, a park-building video game developed by Blue Tongue Entertainment that allows players to recreate their own Jurassic Park, featuring 25 dinosaurs and a multitude of rides, shops and other attractions.

Jurassic Park Institute Tour: Dinosaur Rescue (2003) Jurassic Park Institute Tour: Dinosaur Rescue is an action video game featuring a collection of minigames. It was developed and published by Rocket Company and released for the Game Boy Advance exclusively in Japan on July 18, 2003. The game was sold exclusively through the Jurassic Park: Institute Tour, a large educational travelling exhibition in Japan. In 2018, Zack Zwiezen of Kotaku noted that the minigames were \\"simple, but the art is colorful and cute.\\" Later Jurassic Park games (2007–2015) On August 29, 2007, Brighter Minds Media, Inc. and Universal released Jurassic Park Explorer, an interactive DVD game and board game that are played together. The goal of the game, set on Isla Sorna, is to resurrect dinosaurs by progressing along the game board and completing each of the DVD game's seven mini-games. The DVD game also includes over 300 dinosaur trivia questions and clips from the first three films. In August 2010, Gameloft released Jurassic Park, an action/adventure mobile game based on the first film.

In the game, the player creates a movie studio and subsequently recreates films that were released by Universal Pictures. Jurassic Park Builder, developed and published by Ludia in July 2012, is a construction and management simulation video game in which the player builds a Jurassic Park theme park. An Aquatic Park with aquatic animals and a Glacier Park with extinct animals from the Cenozoic era can also be constructed.

This series is about four very different young teenage boys living in Los Angeles. They are all immortal and all four have to try to fit in. Each boy also fights his dark side. They each have different powers and the Sons must complete their destinies and stop the people of Nefandus from invading the Earth's realm. Due to poor book sales, the series has been discontinued. The Sons' fate is told in the last Daughters of the Moon book. Introduction Four guys living in Los Angeles: A rock star, a rebel, an artist, and a shaman. Like most students at Turney High School, they’re just trying to survive. But for these four—Renegades on the run from the sinister world of Nefandus—survival means learning how to control their powers and fulfill their destiny as Sons of the Dark. The Sons of the Dark and others Omer \\"Obie\\" Ostrov Once a Visigoth warrior, Obie is now a high school student and trying hard to control his wild impulses while still performing in his band. In 361 AD, after he was born, his aunt tried to kill him but his mother saved him by committing him to the Legend. He has the power to cast spells with the Rune stones his mother gave him. He is first introduced in Barbarian (Book #1). His aunt lives in Nefandus and she is jealous of his power. He plays in a band called Pagan after he escapes Nefandus. In the end, he sacrificed himself so Catty would stay alive and destroy the Atrox. Samuel Reardon Samuel is from the pioneer times. He shows up for the first time in Escape (Book #2). He was captured with his friend Macduff in 1768. He discovers that he has the power to call on animals and sometimes turn into them. He and Maddie, a girl he meets when he escapes Nefandus, have an on-and-off relationship. In the end, he sacrificed himself so Catty would stay alive and destroy the Atrox. Kyle Ormond From the modern times, he never knew who his real parents were. In Outcast (Book #3), he discovers who he is: his father is a powerful demon, he created his favorite foster parent and his \\"twin brother\\" Kent with his power of projection, and that his destiny and Catty's, a Daughter of the Moon whom he dated, are intertwined. His mother escaped Nefandus with Kyle to protect him from the Regulators after he was born. He was named by the nurses in the hospital he was born in. He escaped Nefandus with the help of a monk. In the end, he sacrificed himself so Catty would stay alive and destroy the Atrox. Yaolt \\"Berto\\" Roberto Ehecatl Berto is from the Toltec Nation. He has the power of astral projection. He was going to be sacrificed to his god, Tezcatlipoca, but was kidnapped by Obie's master, Hawkwick, and a demon named Semihazah. They took him to Nefandus in 1000 BC. His book is Night Sun (Book #4). He is an entrance guard at a club called Quake. In the end, he sacrificed himself so Catty would stay alive and destroy the Atrox. Ashley Showing up for the first time in book 2, she is a venatrix, a servus who is a bounty hunter. She is from Mesopotamia. She and Berto were lovers when they were together in the digs. After they escaped, she became a bounty hunter because for each servus she returns, her ability to time-travel is extended. In book 2, she helps Samuel receive his power. Apparently, she and Klye also have history together. In book 4, she tells Berto the rest of the Legend, asks him to join evil's side, and reveals that she has a son. She tells Berto that she has to return before the night sun to change her son's destructive fate. He agrees and she takes him to Nefandus. After she is told that she can go home, she does so and succeeds in changing her son's fate. Madison-Maddie Sledgeheimer Sledge's younger sister, she is in involved the occult and believes in the supernatural. In book 2, she meets Samuel in a graveyard, trying to help her friend Emily, whom she believes was attacked by a vampire named Macduff. She gets kidnapped in Nefandus but the Sons help her escape. Obie erases her memory to protect her. In book 4, Obie's spell is wearing off and she begins to remember and also see things. She helps Berto even though she didn't understand what she was doing and she tries to tell him the dangers they face but before Berto can stop Obie, once again her memory is erased. She and Samuel have an on and off relationship. Book summaries Book #1: Barbarian Obie hates Los Angeles and all the junk that goes with it—especially trying to fit in at Thomas Turney High School. But with bounty hunters trying to capture him, his Renegade roommates urge him to lie low with his band and forget about ever getting back home. It’s hard to blend in at school, though, when you’ve just made enemies with the football team. Obie can’t keep away from Allison, the most popular girl in school and the girlfriend of the star quarterback, Sledge. And when his true love, Inna, shows up and pleads for his help, Obie must return to the one place he fears most. Book #2: Escape Samuel has just landed in modern-day L.A. He is totally lost until the beautiful Ashley shows up and promises to help him travel back in time to find his family. But the Sons of the Dark believe that Samuel is the fourth, the one they've been waiting for. They urge him not to believe in Ashley—she is only using him to destroy them all. But Samuel knows Ashley is his only hope for finding his way home. Should he trust her? Even if it means turning his back on the Sons of the Dark? Book #3: Outcast Kyle knows his roommates hate it when he tells them what to do—but he’s the only one from modern-day L.A., and the only one with a clue about how to blend in. But lately, the Sons are more than just annoyed with Kyle—they’ve started spreading vicious rumors about him behind his back. Even Emily, a girl he barely knows, accuses him of terrible betrayal. Now Kyle is being haunted by someone, or something, from the childhood he’s tried hard to forget. And without his friends to help him, Kyle may be no match for the evil from his past. Book #4: Night Sun Students from Turney High School are disappearing without a trace, except for a perfect black circle burned into the pavement. Wild speculation is flying through the halls. Some think it has to do with the coming solar eclipse, and others think alien abductions are to blame. Berto has a different theory. And if he’s right, the Legend of Four is about to come true: four will venture in, but only one will venture out. Kyle, Obie, Samuel, and Berto must go to Nefandus and find the kidnapped teenagers—but which of the Sons of the Dark will survive?

He is also a former mayor of Amarante, having been in office from 1989 to 1995, and member of the Assembly of Republic, for two time occasions, the first from 1995 to 2004 and the second from 2009 to 2014. Political career=Role in national politics Assis challenged incumbent António José Seguro for the party leadership in 2011. When the right-wing coalition government of Prime Minister Pedro Passos Coelho lost its absolute majority in parliament as a result of the 2015 legislative election, Assis condemned \\"left-wing fantasies\\" within his own Socialist Party, describing any attempt at an agreement with the Communists and the Left Bloc as \\"absurd\\". However, on 24 November, Socialist leader António Costa was appointed as Prime Minister after forming a parliamentary alliance with three left-wing parties. Assis has since been publicly voicing his staunch opposition against the new coalition agreement, which he has reaffirmed in the context of the October 2017 local elections and wildfires' aftermath. Member of the European Parliament (2014–2019) Ahead of the 2014 European elections, the Socialist Party named Assis at the top of their list. Following elections, he became a member of the Committee on Foreign Affairs and the Subcommittee on Human Rights. He was also the chairman of the parliament's delegation for relations with Mercosur.

It is a popular destination for rafting, fly fishing, and canoeing. Larger cities along it include Kerrville, New Braunfels, Seguin, Gonzales, Cuero, and Victoria. It has several dams along its length, the most notable of which, Canyon Dam, forms Canyon Lake northwest of New Braunfels. Course The upper part, in the Texas Hill Country, is a smaller, faster stream with limestone banks and shaded by pecan and bald cypress trees. It is formed by two main tributary forks, the North Fork and South Fork Guadalupe Rivers. It is popular as a tubing destination where recreational users often float down it on inflated tire inner tubes during the spring and summer months. East of Boerne, on the border of Kendall County and Comal County, it flows through Guadalupe River State Park, one of the more popular tubing areas along it. The lower part begins at the outlet of Canyon Lake, near New Braunfels. The section between Canyon Dam and New Braunfels is the most heavily used in terms of recreation. It is a popular destination for whitewater rafters, canoeists, kayakers, and tubing. When the water is flowing at less than there could be hundreds if not thousands of tubes on this stretch of it. At flows greater than , there should be very few tubes on the water. Flows greater than and less than are ideal for rafting and paddling. The flow is controlled by Canyon Dam, and by the amount of rainfall the area has received. It is joined by the Comal River in New Braunfels and the San Marcos River about two miles (3 km) west of Gonzales. The part below the San Marcos River, as well as the latter, is part of the course for the Texas Water Safari. The San Antonio River flows into it just north of Tivoli. Ahead of the entry into the San Antonio Bay estuary, it forms a delta and splits into two distributaries referred respectively as the North and South parts. Each distributary flows into the San Antonio Bay estuary at Guadalupe Bay.

It was renamed the San Augustin by Domingo Terán de los Ríos who maintained a colony on it, but the name Guadalupe persisted. Many explorers referred to the current Guadalupe as the San Ybón above its confluence with the Comal, and instead the Comal was called the Guadalupe. Evidence indicates that it has been home to humans for several thousand years, including the Karankawa, Tonkawa, and Huaco (pronounced like Waco) Indians. Being led by Prince Solms, 228 pioneer immigrants from Germany traveled overland from Indianola to the site chosen to be the first German settlement in Texas, New Braunfels. Upon reaching the river, the pioneers found it too high to cross due to the winter rains. Prince Solms, perhaps wishing to impress the others with his bravado, plunged into the raging waters and crossed the swollen river on horseback. Not to be outdone by anyone, Betty Holekamp immediately followed and successfully crossed the river.Ransleben, Guido E.; A Hundred Years of Comfort in Texas; 1954 Thus Betty Holekamp is known as the first white woman to cross the Guadalupe on horseback. 1987 flood On July 17, 1987, a sudden flash flood swept a bus full of children away at a low water crossing. The incident occurred near the town of Comfort, Texas, which lies about northwest of San Antonio. At the time, the Pot O' Gold Ranch, which is situated on the south side of the river about two miles southwest of Comfort, was hosting a church camp, with over 300 children from various churches attending. On the night of July 16 and into the morning of the 17th, almost of rain had fallen across the Texas hill country to the north, triggering immense flooding on the Guadalupe River. The camp was scheduled to end on the 17th and the children were to be headed home later that day, but camp supervisors at the ranch decided to evacuate the children early that morning before it rose too high. At around 9am that morning, the children were loaded into buses and the buses were directed to a low water crossing. While most of the buses managed to make it across, one bus from the Seagoville Road Baptist Church/Balch Springs Christian Academy in the Dallas suburb of Balch Springs was swept away, along with Pastor Richard Koons, his wife Lavonda, chaperons Allen and Deborah Coalson, and thirty-nine children, ranging in age from 8 to 17. The vehicle had been among the last to leave the camp and proceed alongside the flooded crossing, but when the bus stalled due to rapidly rising waters, Koons and Coalson attempted to get the children to safety by instructing them to form a human chain so that they could reach shore hand in hand. As this was attempted, a sudden rush of water broke the chain and swept them all away. Rescuers from the Texas Department of Public Safety and the US Army's 507th Medical Division managed to save all four adults and twenty-nine of the children via helicopters. The last survivor was rescued from the river around 11:30am, and by that afternoon two children had been confirmed dead, with eight still missing. The first confirmed fatality was 14-year-old Melanie Finley, who after being lifted from the river by helicopter lost her grip on the rope and fell to her death. The second fatality was thirteen-year-old Tonya Smith, who was found entangled in barbed wire two miles downstream from where the bus was washed away. Several parents of the children descended on Comfort, most staying at a makeshift shelter set up by town residents and the American Red Cross at the Comfort Elementary School. Six more bodies were recovered from the river on July 18, identified as Lagenia Keenum, 15; Michael Lane, 16; Michael O'Neal, 16; Cindy Sewell, 16; Christopher Sewell, 13; and Stacey Smith, 16 (Sister of Tonya Smith). The following day, the ninth and final body was recovered from the river, identified as 14-year-old Leslie Gossett. The body of 17-year-old John Bankston Jr., the oldest of the ten victims, was never found. In the summer of 1988, near the edge of the river and at the foot of the driveway to the Pot O' Gold Ranch, a memorial plaque was dedicated to the children who died as well as those who survived. On April 18, 1989, the story of the deaths and rescues was shown as the pilot episode of Rescue 911, and in 1993 was made into a television movie called The Flood: Who Will Save Our Children? The film followed the experiences of some of the children and their families, and starred Joe Spano as Reverend Richard Koons. Fishing Fly fishing for rainbow and brown trout below Canyon Lake is extremely popular along the entire river, anglers can catch guadalupe bass, largemouth bass, smallmouth bass, rio grande cichlid, striped bass and white bass. Tailrace fishing is also common below many of the weirs, spillways and dams such as West-point Pepperell Dam located on the north end of Lake Dunlap within the City Limits of New Braunfels. River conditions/flow The river's conditions can change rapidly. Its flow is set by the dam at Canyon Lake and operated by the Army Corps of Engineers. It is highly regulated and well maintained to ensure safety. It is, however, prone to severe flooding. During the rainy seasons the water can reach well above the banks and exceed \\"normal\\" levels, in which case it can become life threateningly dangerous due to swift currents. If the flow gauge exceeds at the Sattler Gage, it is generally considered by local authorities as too dangerous for recreational purposes for all except expert kayakers and/or whitewater rafters. On October 31, 2013, the part in New Braunfels rose from in one hour and fifteen minutes due to locally heavy rainfall.

As architect to the Board of Works, he designed several major public buildings, including the main block and façade of the British Museum. He was a pioneer of the use of concrete foundations. Background and training The main block and facade of the British Museum was designed by Robert Smirke. Smirke was born in London on 1 October 1780, the second son of the portrait painter Robert Smirke; he was one of twelve children.page 73, J. Mordaunt Crook: The British Museum A Case-study in Architectural Politics, 1972, Pelican Books He attended Aspley School, Aspley Guise, Bedfordshire,page 74, J. Mordaunt Crook: The British Museum A Case-study in Architectural Politics, 1972, Pelican Books where he studied Latin, Greek, French and drawing, and was made head boy at the age of 15. In May 1796 he began his study of architecture as a pupil of John Soane but left after only a few months in early 1797 due to a personality clash with his teacher.pages 137–8, Gillian Darley, John Soane An Accidental Romantic, 1999, Yale University Press He wrote to his father: > He (Soane) was on Monday morning in one of his amiable Tempers. Everything > was slovenly that I was doing. My drawing was slovenly because it was too > great a scale, my scale, also, being too long, and he finished saying the > whole of it was excessively slovenly, and that I should draw it out again on > the back not to waste another sheet about it.page 65, Dorothy Stroud, Sir > John Soane Architect, 1984, Faber and Faber In 1796, he also began his studies at the Royal Academy winning the Silver Medal that year, also winning the same year the Silver Palette of the Royal Society for the encouragement of Arts, Manufactures & Commerce. He was awarded the Gold Medal of the Royal Academy in 1799 for his design for a National Museum. After leaving Soane he depended on George Dance the Younger and a surveyor called Thomas Bush for his architectural training. In 1801, accompanied by his elder brother Richard he embarked on a Grand Tour which would last until 1805. His itinerary can be followed by the series of letters he wrote: Brussels, Paris (in order to visit which the brothers had to disguise themselves as Americans as Britain was at war with France at the time), Berlin, Potsdam, Prague, Dresden, Vienna. He visited Italy, including, Florence, Venice, Padua, Genoa, Vicenza, Rome, Naples, and Sicily, then went on to Greece, seeing Corinth, Athens, Delphi, Thebes and Olympia. From Athens Smirke wrote to his father: > How can I by description give you any idea of the great pleasure I enjoyed > in the sight of these ancient buildings of Athens! How strongly were > exemplified in them the grandeur and effect of simplicity in architecture! > The Temple of Thesus (Temple of Hephaestus)... cannot but arrest the > attention of everyone from its appropriate and dignified solemnity of > appearance. The temple of Minerva (Parthenon)... strikes one in the same way > with its grandeur and majesty. We were a month there.

Career Surviving Ionic capital in Walthamstow by Smirke, all that remains of his former General Post Office Building in London In 1805, Smirke became a member of the Society of Antiquaries of London and the Architects' Club. His first official appointment came in 1807 when he was made architect to the Royal Mint.page 75, J. Mordaunt Crook: The British Museum A Case-study in Architectural Politics, 1972, Pelican Books He was elected an Associate of the Royal Academy on 7 November 1808, and a full Academician on 11 February 1811, his diploma work consisting of a drawing of a reconstruction of the Acropolis of Athens.page 52, Masterworks: Architecture at the Royal Academy of Arts, Neil Bingham, 2011 Royal Academy of Arts, He only ever exhibited five works at the Academy, the last in 1810.pages 163-4, Algernon Graves The Royal Academy: A Complete Dictionary of Contributors from its Foundations in 1769 to 1904, Volume 7, 1905, Henry Graves Smirke's relations with Soane reached a new low after the latter, who had been appointed Professor of Architecture at the Royal Academy, heavily criticised Smirke's design for the Covent Garden Opera House in his fourth lecture on 29 January 1810.pages 194–5, Gillian Darley, John Soane An Accidental Romantic, 1999, Yale University Press He said: > The practise of sacrificing everything to one front of a building is to be > seen, not only in small houses where economy might in some degree apologize > for the absurdity, but it is also apparent in large works of great expense > .....

In 1819 he was made surveyor of the Inner Temple. In 1819, he married Laura Freston, daughter of The Reverend Anthony Freston, the great-nephew of the architect Matthew Brettingham. The only child of the marriage was a daughter Laura. In 1820, he was made surveyor of the Duchy of Lancaster, and also in 1820 he became treasurer to the Royal Academy.Page 263, John Soane An Accidental Romantic, Gillian Darley, 1999, Yale University Press He was knighted in 1832, and received the RIBA Royal Gold Medal for Architecture in 1853. Smirke lived at 81 Charlotte Street, London. There is a blue plaque commemorating his residence on the outside of the building. He retired from practise in 1845, after which Robert Peel made him a member of the Commission for London Improvements. In 1859, he resigned from the Royal Academy and retired to Cheltenham, where he lived in Montpellier House, Suffolk Square. He died there on 18 April 1867 and was buried in the churchyard of St Peter's in Leckhampton. His estate was worth £90,000. He is known to have designed or remodelled over twenty churches, more than fifty public buildings and more than sixty private houses. This productivity inspired James Planché's 1846 chorus in his burlesque of Aristophanes' The Birds: > Go to work, rival Smirke > Make a dash, À la Nash > Something try at, worthy Wyatt > Plans out carry, great as Barry > The rapid rise of Smirke was due to political patronage.page 79, J. Mordaunt Crook: The British Museum A Case-study in Architectural Politics, 1972, Pelican Books He was a Tory at a time when this party was in the ascendant. His friends at the Royal Academy such as Sir Thomas Lawrence, George Dance, Benjamin West and Joseph Farington were able to introduce him to patrons such as: John Hamilton, 1st Marquess of Abercorn; Henry Dundas, 1st Viscount Melville; Sir George Beaumont, 7th Baronet; George Hamilton-Gordon, 4th Earl of Aberdeen; Francis Seymour-Conway, 3rd Marquess of Hertford; Henry Bathurst, 3rd Earl Bathurst; John 'Mad Jack' Fuller and William Lowther, 2nd Earl of Lonsdale. These politicians and aristocrats ensured his rapid advancement and several were to commission buildings from Smirke themselves. Thomas Leverton Donaldson described Smirke as able to please \\"Men whom it was proverbially impossible to please\\".page 81, J. Mordaunt Crook: 'The British Museum A Case- study in Architectural Politics, 1972, Pelican Books His patron at Lowther Castle William Lowther, 1st Earl of Lonsdale said he was \\"ingenious, modest and gentlemanly in his manners\\".page 81, J. Mordaunt Crook: The British Museum A Case-study in Architectural Politics, 1972, Pelican Books Style=Classicism Smirke's first major work, the rebuilt Covent Garden Theatre, was the first Greek Doric building in London. John Summerson described the design as demonstrating \\"how a plain mass of building could be endowed with a sense of gravity by comparatively simple means\\". During the early part of his career Smirke was, along with William Wilkins, the leading figure in the Greek Revival in England. At the General Post Office in London in the mid-1820s he was still using the giant order of columns with a certain restraint, but by the time he came to design the main front of the British Museum, probably not planned until the 1830s, all such moderation was gone and he used it lavishly, wrapping an imposing colonnade around whole facade.page 108, Henry-Russell Hitchcock, Architecture: Nineteenth and Twentieth Centuries, 4th Edition 1977, Pelican Books. Gothic Revival The Gothic revival Assize Court, Lincoln Castle, Lincoln, 1822–6 Smirke, in the view of Charles Locke Eastlake, came third in importance amongst the Gothic Revival architects of his generation, after John Nash and James Wyatt, but criticised his work for its theatrical impracticability. He said that his Eastnor Castle (1808–15), a massive, gloomy building with watch towers and a keep, \\"might have made a tolerable fort before the invention of gunpowder, but as a residence it was a picturesque mistake\\".page 79, Charles Locke Eastlake: A History of the Gothic Revival, 1872, Longmans, Green & Co Constructional innovation Smirke was a pioneer of using both concrete and cast iron.J. Mordaunt Crook, \\"Sir Robert Smirke: A Pioneer of Concrete Construction\\", 1965, Newcomen Society Transactions xxxviii A critic writing in 1828 in the Athenaeum said \\"Mr. Smirke, is pre-eminent in construction: in this respect he has not his superior in the United Kingdom\\". James Fergusson, writing in 1849, said \\"He was a first class builder architect ... no building of his ever showed a flaw or failing and ... he was often called upon to remedy the defects of his brother artist.\\"J. Fergusson, Observations on the British Museum, National Gallery and National record Office, 1849 Projects in which he used concrete foundations included the Millbank Penitentiary, the rebuilding of the London Custom House and the British Museum. At the first two he was called in when work overseen by previous architects had proved unstable. The prison at Millbank pages 244–9, The Fabrication of Virtue: English Prison Architecture 1750–1840, Robin Evans, Cambridge University Press, 1982, (1812–21; demolished c. 1890) had been designed by an architect called William Williams but his plan was then revised by Thomas Hardwick. The largest prison in Europe, it consisted of a hexagonal central courtyard with an elongated pentagonal courtyard on each outer wall of the central courtyard; the three outer corners of the pentagonal courtyards each had a tower one storey higher than the three floors of the rest of the building. Work had started under Hardwick in late 1812, but when the boundary wall it reached a height of about six feet high it began to tilt and crack. After 18 months, with £26,000 spent, Hardwick resigned. Work continued and by February 1816 the first prisoners were admitted, but the building creaked and several windows spontaneously shattered. Smirke and the engineer John Rennie the Elder were called in, and they recommended demolition of three of the towers and the underpinning of the entire building with concrete foundations: the first known use of this material for foundations in Britain since the Roman Empire.page 84, J. Mordaunt Crook: the British Museum A Case-study in Architectural Politics, 1972, Pelican Books The work cost £70,000, bringing the total cost of the building to £458,000. , The Thames front of the London Custom House In 1825–27 Smirke rebuilt the centre of the Custom House in the City of London,page 295, Buildings of England: London 1 The City of London, Simon Bradley and Nikolaus Pevsner, 1997, Penguin Books, following the failure of its foundations. The building had been erected from 1813 to the designs of David Laing. The building is 488 feet long, the central 200 feet being Smirke's work.page 295, Buildings of England: London 1 The City of London, Simon Bradley and Nikolaus Pevsner, 1997, Penguin Books, He used large cast iron beams to support the floors of the upper galleries at the British Museum;page 21, Marjorie Caygill & Christopher Date, Building the British Museum, 1999, The British Museum Press these had to span 41 feet. Another area where Smirke was an innovator was in the use of quantity surveyors to rationalise the various eighteenth-century systems of estimating and measuring building work.page 84, J. Mordaunt Crook: The British Museum A Case-study in Architectural Politics, 1972, Pelican Books Writings In 1806 he published the first and only volume of an intended series of books Specimens of Continental Architecture. Smirke started to write a treatise on architecture in about 1815page 97, J. Mordaunt Crook: The British Museum A Case-study in Architectural Politics, 1972, Pelican Books and although he worked on it for about 10 years never completed it. In it he made his admiration for the architecture of ancient Greece plain. He described it as \\"the noblest\\", \\"simple, grand, magnificent\\", \\"with its other merits it has a kind of primal simplicity\\". This he contrasted with the Architecture of ancient Rome which he described as \\"corrupt Roman taste\\", \\"An excess of ornament is in all cases a sympton [sic] of a vulgar or degenerate taste\\". Of Gothic architecture he described as '\\"till its despicable remains were almost everywhere superseded by that singular and mysterious compound of styles\\". Pupils and family His pupils included Lewis Vulliamy, William Burn, Charles Robert Cockerell, Henry Jones Underwood, Henry Roberts, and his own brother Sydney, best known for the circular reading room at the British Museum. Another brother, Edward Smirke, was a lawyer and antiquarian. Their sister Mary Smirke was a noted painter and translator. London buildings=Royal Mint The former Royal Mint,page 482, Buildings of England: London 5 East, Bridget Cherry, Charles O'Brien and Nikolaus Pevsner, 2005, Yale University Press, Tower Hill (1807–12). The main building was designed by the previous architect to the Mint James Johnson, but the design was modified by Smirke, who oversaw its execution. The long stone facade with a ground floor of channelled rustication, the two upper floors have a broad pediment containing The Royal Arms supported by six Roman Doric attached columns. The end bays are marked by four Doric pilasters; the Greek Doric frieze and lodges are probably by Smirke. The building contained an apartment for the Deputy Master of the Mint, the Assay Master, and Provost of the Moneyers as well as bullion stores and Mint Office. Covent Garden Theatre Covent Garden Theatre, burnt and rebuilt The second incarnation of the Covent Garden Theatre (now the Royal Opera House), built in ten months in 1808–1809.pages 93–97, Survey of London Volume XXXV: The Theatre Royal, Drury Lane and the Royal Opera House Covent Garden, F.H.W. Sheppard (Ed), 1970 The Athlone Press It had a symmetrical facade with a tetrastyle portico in the centre, and was the first building in London to use the Greek Doric order.page 473, John Summerson, Architecture in Britain 1530–1830, 8th Edition 1991, Pelican Books The portico was flanked by four bays, the end bays being marked by pilasters with a statue in a niche between. The three bays on each side of the portico had arches on the ground floor and windows above these and a single carved relief above designed by John Flaxman. The main entrance hall, behind the three doors in the portico, was divided into three aisles by square Doric piers. To the south was the grand staircase, rising between walls, the flight was divided into two sections by a landing, the upper floor had four Ionic columns each side of the staircase that supported a barrel vault over it. The horseshoe shaped auditorium was on five levels, and seated 2,800 people, not including those in the many private boxes. The building was destroyed by fire in 1857. Lansdowne House Lansdowne House, (1816–19) interiors, notably the sculpture gallery, central part of room has a shallow barrel vault with plain coffering; antae mark off the part circular ends of the room.page 499, Buildings of England: London 6 Westminster, Simon Bradley and Nikolaus Pevsner, 2003, Yale University Press, London Ophtalmic Hospital Smirke's London Ophthalmic Hospital, Moorfields (1821–2) was rebuilt in 1898 on a nearby site; it is now known as Moorfields Eye Hospital NHS Foundation Trust. General Post Office The General Post Office, demolished The General Post Office building in St Martins-le-Grand in the City of London (1825–29; demolished c. 1912). This was England's first purpose built post office.page 154, Living, Leisure and Law: Eight Building Types in England 1800–1914, Geoff Brandwood (Ed), 2010, Spire Books, Its main facade had a central hexastyle Greek Ionic portico with pediment, and two tetrastyle porticoes, without pediments, at each end. The main interior space was the large letter-carriers room, with an elegant iron gallery and a spiral staircase. British Museum The main block and facade of the British Museum,pages 288–295, Buildings of England: London 4 North, Bridget Cherry and Nikolaus Pevsner, 1998, Penguin Books, Bloomsbury (1823–46). This is Smirke's largest and best known building. In 1820, in his role as architect to the Office of Works, Smirke was invited to redesign the museum, although the complete design dates from 1823, and was for a building surrounding a large central courtyard with a grand south front, given the limited funds the work was divided into phases. It is built of brick with the visible facades cased in Portland stone. The first part to be constructed was the \\"King's Library\\" of 1823–1828, which forms the east wing. The north section of the west wing, the \\"Egyptian Galleries\\" followed 1825–1834. The north wing, housing the library and reading rooms, was built in 1833–1838. The west wing and south front were built in 1842–1846. The main feature of the south front is the great colonnade of 44 Greek Ionic columns. The columns are 45 feet high and five feet in diameter; their capitals are loosely based on those of the temple of Athena Polias at Priene and the bases on those of the temple of Dionysus at Teos. At the centre of the colonnade is an octastyle portico, two columns deep; the colonnade continues for three more columns before embracing the two wings to either side. Beyond the facade Smirke built two smaller wings, with Doric pilasters, containing houses, the western one for the Director of the museum. The major surviving interiors are the entrance hall with the Great Stair – in the form of an Imperial staircase– rising to the west, and the \\"King's Library\\". This, built to house 65,000 books, is 300 feet long, 41 feet wide and 31 feet high, the centre section being slightly wider, with four great granite Corinthian columns. The only major interior to survive in the north wing is the \\"Arched Room\\" at the west end. The \\"Egyptian Gallery\\" matches the \\"King's Library\\" but is much plainer in decoration.page 21, Building the British Museum, Marjorie Caygill and Christopher Date, 1999, The British Museum Press, File:SIMPSON, W. after WALKER, E.publ1852 edited.jpgBritish Museum, 1852 File:British Museum (front).jpgEntrance portico, British Museum File:L-british-museum-london.pngPlan of the British Museum File:BM, Main Floor Main Entrance Hall ~ South Stairs.6.JPGGreat Staircase, British Museum File:BM; 'MF' RM1 - The King's Library, Enlightenment 1 'Discovering the world in the 18th Century ~ View South.jpgKing's Library, British Museum File:British Museum Room 1 Enlightenment.jpgBookcases in the King's Library, British Museum File:BM, AES Egyptian Sculpture (Room 4), View North.4.JPGEgyptian Gallery, British Museum The Inner Temple Smirke's works at the Inner Temple included his only Gothic buildings in London.

The building is of Bath Stone. There were several extensions and remodellings during the 20th century. Lancaster House Smirke was first involved with the design of Lancaster Housepage 589, Buildings of England: London 6 Westminster, Simon Bradley and Nikolaus Pevsner, 2003, Yale University Press, ISBN 0-300-09595-3 in 1825, was dismissed and then brought back in 1832. He added the top floor, and designed the interiors apart from the State Rooms. His involvement ceased in 1840.

He was a member of the Royal Academy. Life Smirke was born at Wigton near Carlisle, the son of a travelling artist. When he was twelve he was apprenticed to a heraldic painter in London, and at the age of twenty began to study at the Royal Academy Schools. Robert Smirke by Mary Smirke - now in the Royal Academy In 1775 he became a member of the Incorporated Society of Artists, with which he began to exhibit by sending five works; he showed works there again in 1777 and 1778. In 1786 he exhibited Narcissus and The Lady and Sabrina ( a subject from Milton's Comus) at the Royal Academy; these were followed by many works, usually small in size, illustrative of the English poets, especially James Thomson. In 1791 Smirke was elected an associate of the Royal Academy, in which year he exhibited \\"The Widow\\". He became a full academician in 1793, when he painted as his diploma work Don Quixote and Sancho. His last contribution to the academy, entitled Infancy, appeared in 1813, but he continued to exhibit occasionally elsewhere until 1834. In 1804 he was nominated to succeed Joseph Wilton as keeper to the Royal Academy, but George III refused to sanction the appointment on account of his revolutionary political opinions, and the appointment went instead to Henry Fuseli. In 1815 the British Institution upset many British artists by a preface to the catalogue of their exhibition of Old Masters, The Catalogues Raisonnés, implying rather too strongly that British artists had a lot to learn from them. Smirke is generally accepted as the author in 1815–16 of a series of satirical \\"Catalogues Raisonnés\\", which savagely lampooned the great and the good of British art patronage.Egerton, Judy. The British School (National Gallery Catalogues, new series, 1998) p. 382. Of his sons, Richard Smirke (1778–1815), was a notable antiquarian artist. Robert and Sydney both became notable architects and were both elected members of the Royal Academy. His fourth son, Edward was a noted lawyer and antiquary. There is a portrait of Smirke by John Jackson taken from an original picture by Mary Smirke, engraved by Charles Picart. Sir William John Newton painted several miniatures of him. Smirke died at 3 Osnaburgh Terrace, Regent's Park, London, on 5 January 1845, aged 92, and was buried in Kensal Green Cemetery. Works Smirke's pictures were usually of small size and painted in monochrome, and so adapted for engraving. He designed illustrations for the Bible, The Picturesque Beauties of Shakespeare (1783), Johnson's Rasselas (1805), Gil Blas (1809), the Arabian Nights (1811), Adventures of Hunchback (1814), Don Quixote, (translated by his daughter, Mary Smirke, 1818), and various British poets, especially James Thomson. The Pedagogue, engraved by Joseph Goodyear for the Amulet of 1830, is typical. The Rivals was engraved by William Finden for the Keepsake of 1828; The Secret, by James Mitchell for the same annual in 1830; and The Love Letter was engraved by Alfred W. Warren for the Gem of 1830. Smirke painted also some pictures for John Boydell's Shakespeare Gallery and for Bowyer's History of England. These works included Katharine and Petruchio, Juliet and the Nurse, Prince Henry and Falstaff, and The Seven Ages. A large commemorative plate, with fifteen medallion portraits, of The Victory of the Nile was engraved by John Landseer from his design. In the Guildhall Art Gallery was a picture by him representing Conjugal Affection, or Industry and Prudence, and a series of scenes from Don Quixote.

It has the appearance of black powder with the sodium chloride (face-centered cubic) crystal structure. As found in nature its crystals range in size from 0.1 to 0.3mm. It occurs in nature as a form of the very rare mineral Khamrabaevite (see Khamrabaevite, ) - (Ti,V,Fe)C. It was discovered in 1984 on Mount Arashan in the Chatkal District, USSR (modern Kyrgyzstan), near the Uzbek border. The mineral was named after Ibragim Khamrabaevich Khamrabaev, director of Geology and Geophysics of Tashkent, Uzbekistan. Physical properties Titanium carbide has an elastic modulus of approximately 400 GPa and a shear modulus of 188 GPa. Manufacturing and machining Tool bits without tungsten content can be made of titanium carbide in nickel-cobalt matrix cermet, enhancing the cutting speed, precision, and smoothness of the workpiece. The resistance to wear, corrosion, and oxidation of a tungsten carbide–cobalt material can be increased by adding 6–30% of titanium carbide to tungsten carbide. This forms a solid solution that is more brittle and susceptible to breakage. Titanium carbide can be etched with reactive-ion etching.  Applications  Titanium carbide is used in preparation of cermets, which are frequently used to machine steel materials at high cutting speed. It is also used as an abrasion- resistant surface coating on metal parts, such as tool bits and watch mechanisms. Titanium carbide is also used as a heat shield coating for atmospheric reentry of spacecraft. 7075 aluminium alloy (AA7075) is almost as strong as steel, but weighs one third as much. Using thin AA7075 rods with TiC nanoparticles allows larger alloys pieces to be welded without phase- segregation induced cracks.

The battle was a victory for the United States Army under Commodore Robert F. Stockton and General Stephen Watts Kearny. Background Not finding any Californians at Governor Pío Pico's ranch, the Americans under Stockton and Kearny crossed the plain between the San Gabriel River and the Los Angeles River called La Mesa.Bauer, K.J., 1974, The Mexican War, 1846–1848, New York:Macmillan, They encountered José María Flores' 300-strong force of Californio militia, including artillery, near where the city of Vernon now stands, about four miles south of Los Angeles. Battle The Californian guns were ineffective, while the American guns responded from their square as the Americans advanced. Flores extended his line and brought up two more guns. Stockton halted and formed his guns into a single battery. After fifteen minutes, Stockton's fire drove the Californian artillery from effective range. Flores sent his lancers against the American left flank but were driven back; most of his men deserted, allowing the Americans to advance into Los Angeles. Aftermath The battle was the last armed resistance to the American conquest of California, and General José María Flores returned to Mexico afterward. Three days after the battle, on January 12, the last significant group of residents surrendered to U.S. forces. The conquest and annexation of Alta California was settled with the signing of the Treaty of Cahuenga by U.S. Army Lieutenant- Colonel John C. Frémont and Mexican General Andrés Pico on January 13, 1847. The site of the battle is now registered as California Historical Landmark #167.

(1943), was voted by the American evangelical periodical Christianity Today in 2006 as one of the top 50 books \\"which had shaped evangelicals\\". Early life Bruce was born in Elgin, Moray, Scotland, the son of a Christian Brethren (Plymouth Brethren) preacher and educated at the University of Aberdeen, Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge, and the University of Vienna, where he studied with Paul Kretschmer, an Indo-European philologist.Hippenhammer, Craighton T., \\"F.F. Bruce: A Life, by Tim Grass\\" (2013). Faculty Scholarship – Library Science. Paper 15. http://digitalcommons.olivet.edu/lsci_facp/15. Career After teaching Greek for several years, first at the University of Edinburgh and then at the University of Leeds, he became head of the Department of Biblical History and Literature at the University of Sheffield in 1947. Aberdeen University bestowed an honorary Doctor of Divinity degree on him in 1957.W.W. Gasque, \\"Bruce, F(rederick) F(yvie)\\", Historical Handbook of Major Bible Interpreters, ed. Donald K. McKim, InterVarsity Press, 1998, p. 444. In 1959 he moved to the University of Manchester where he became Rylands Professor of Biblical Criticism and Exegesis. He wrote over 40 books and served as editor of The Evangelical Quarterly and the Palestine Exploration Quarterly. He retired from teaching in 1978. Bruce was a scholar on the life and ministry of Paul the Apostle and wrote several studies, the best known of which is Paul: Apostle of the Free Spirit (published in the United States as Paul: Apostle of the Heart Set Free). He also wrote commentaries on many biblical books including Habakkuk, the Gospel of John, the Acts of the Apostles, Romans, 1 & 2 Corinthians, Galatians, Ephesians, Colossians, Philemon, 1 & 2 Thessalonians, Philippians, the Epistle to the Hebrews, and the Epistles of John. Most of Bruce's works were scholarly, but he also wrote many popular works on the Bible. He viewed the New Testament writings as historically reliable and the truth claims of Christianity as hinging on their being so. To Bruce this did not mean that the Bible was always precise, or that this lack of precision could not lead to some confusion. He believed, however, that the passages that were still open to debate were ones that had no substantial bearing on Christian theology and thinking. Bruce's colleague at Manchester, James Barr, considered Bruce a \\"conservative liberal\\".Iain Murray, Evangelicalism Divided, Edinburgh: Banner of Truth (2000), p. 181; John Wenham, Facing Hell: An Autobiography, Carlisle: Paternoster Press (1999), p. 195. Bruce was a friend and colleague of H.L. Ellison. Personal views Bruce was in Christian fellowship at various places during his life, though his primary commitment was to the Open Brethren among whom he grew up.Arnold Pickering, \\"F.F. Bruce as a Fellow-Elder\\", Christian Brethren Research Fellowship Journal 22 (Nov. 1971), p. 15f.

In other words, only a standalone DSL Internet service is provided on the local loop. The original concept of DSL was to use existing telephone lines for high speed data communication, with DSL and telephone services coexisting on the same phone line - but increasingly customers may require only the Internet service - and see no need for the traditional phone service.  Comparison of Regular and Naked DSL (Standalone DSL) In Regular DSL, data transmission is carried on inaudible high frequencies on a standard Plain Old Telephone Service (POTS) telephone line. The original idea was to use existing telephone lines for high speed data communication. DSL and telephone service can coexist on the same phone line and do not interfere with each other. From the Telco's point of view, DSL gives them the ability to sell the same telephone line twice, to the same customer. It is an idea that benefits the telco (who makes more money) and the customer (who gets a high speed data connection without the need for installation of expensive new cables.) Naked DSL is the same as standard DSL, except that there is no voice service. Telephone service is not required for DSL to operate correctly. The primary advantage of Naked DSL is financial: the customer saves the expense of a phone line, which they may not need. In terms of equipment, physical setup and speed, there is no difference between Naked DSL and Regular DSL. They are identical, except for the absence of dial tone. Telco Response to standalone DSL has generally been hostile. In the United States AT&T; allows Standalone DSL for its own customers, but only very reluctantly, and it blocks third parties from providing Standalone DSL over AT&T; telephone lines unless those customers also purchase AT&T; branded voice services. Verizon stopped permitting Standalone DSL for its own customers in 2014, but some third parties such as Brand X Internet do still offer it. Verizon's own customers are required to buy Verizon branded voice services in order to purchase any kind of DSL. In regular DSL, a cable runs from the telephone switch to a piece of equipment called a Plain Old Telephone Service (POTS) splitter. This splitter separates the DSL and voice bands. Thus the customer will have a dial tone, which allows them to use the telephone line as a regular land line while they are using it to access the Internet on their computer. A cable carrying both services runs from the splitter to the cable head, where it continues on to the customer on outside plant. (See DSLAM.) In naked DSL, there is no cable from the telephone switch to the POTS splitter. Thus there is no dial tone on the line. However, the customer could still use the line for regular telephone service through Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) or a Competitive Local Exchange Carrier (CLEC) instead of the Incumbent Local Exchange Carrier (ILEC). Naked ADSL2 and ADSL2+ provisioned with \\"all digital mode\\" Annex I or Annex J can achieve additional 256 kbit/s of upstream data rate.  Availability  Naked DSL is available in several countries, if not nationwide then via at least one company: Austria, Australia, Belgium, Bulgaria, Canada, Croatia, Denmark, Estonia, France, Germany, Israel, Italy, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Philippines, Portugal, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey and the United States.Naked DSL: The Potential Impact in New Zealand - Network Strategies  Australia  Amnet was the first ISP in Australia to officially launch a naked DSL product live on 14 November 2007, followed by iiNet a day later. Exetel released naked ADSL2 Services on 1 December 2007. Optus, Australia's second largest telecommunications provider, announced on 2 Mar 2009 that it will also be providing naked DSL services. Other providers include offer Naked DSL are listed at Updated List of Naked DSL ISPs that service Australia. Many of the smaller players use Optus to deliver their Naked DSL services.  Canada  Since the CRTC ruling of 21 July 2003,CRTC directs incumbent telephone companies to offer high-speed Internet services to competitors' residential telephone customers Naked DSL service has been made available in Canada. Bell Canada and other incumbents typically charge an additional fee for dry loop DSL based on the \\"Band Rate\\" of the area (ranging from Band A to Band G) to consumers and smaller ISP's who use Bell's phone line.  Croatia  Several providers offer naked DSL, but as of late July 2012, Iskon Internet is the first one to offer naked DSL nationwide on T-Hrvatski Telekom's existing infrastructure, by unsubscribing from T-Com's analog line and providing telephony service over VoIP. However, due to T-HT's wholesale policy and prices, higher speeds would be too expensive for end user, and DSL link still operates in Annex B.  Denmark  Naked DSL is available from the majority of ISPs, as most ISPs have now converted to VoIP solutions. Having 2 different providers for both POTS and DSL is possible.  France  Several ISPs now offer Naked Unbundled DSL services, which are also called offres dégroupées. ISPs generally supply their own DSL modem with an FXS (Foreign exchange station) port for a standard phone handset and a set top box to provide television services. The first ISP to offer Naked DSL was Free with their Freebox.  Germany  At least one ISP offers Naked DSL service: M-Net and its version, Maxi Pur.M-Net website, Accessed 6 October 2008.  Israel  Naked DSL (both ADSL and VDSL) is provided by Bezeq telephony company to customers upon request, since most homes use both telephony and DSL lines as default, the service is provided only by demand. It's possible to request to remove the telephony line function at any given time without any restrictions or obligations. New Zealand Chorus Limited is the wholesale provider for the vast majority of phone lines and it provides naked DSL services. All the major internet retailers provide a naked DSL service. It is possible to get the POTS and DSL from different service providers. , Chorus provides 1.091 million ADSL2+ connections, of which 98,000 (9%) are naked, and it has 25,000 VDSL2 connections, of which 5,000 (20%) are naked.  Paraguay  Naked DSL service is available in Paraguay from State owned COPACO  Philippines  Bayan Telecommunications, Globe Telecom, EASTERN Communications, and Smart Telecommunications offers that service.  Portugal  Portugal Telecom offers that service, called Naked, since September 2008 through SAPO (company). Simplesnet offers that service, called NDSL Simplesnet. In May 2008, Zon TvCabo announced to its investors that it will offer Portugal's first Naked DSL service.  South Africa  Unavailable, as yet there is no Naked ADSL available. Even though there has been discussion on the topic and ISP's trying to implement such services.  Switzerland  Naked DSL service is available in Switzerland from solnet.ch (DSL Solo), green.ch, netstream.ch, origon ag (oDSL), INIT7 AG and SETUP Informatik for ADSL and VDSL. Swisscom (The operator of the POTS infrastructure) plans to shut down POTS beginning in 2018 and is therefore moving all customers to other solutions (Mainly VoIP, but also mobile services). Therefore, naked DSL is now the default product, some providers like iWay and netstream.ch are also selling bundled service with VoIP (usually integrated into the router).  Thailand  Only 3BB offer Naked DSL service. 3BB is former Maxnet who previously offer this service too.  Turkey  In 2011, the regulatory body of Turkish State foreseeing telecommunications have announced whole-sale pricing for government corporation Turk Telekom for providing retailers with Naked DSL. The pricing included additional fees under various labels, such as circuit preparation service (devre hazırlama ücreti) or an additional naked DSL fee (yalın adsl ücreti). Although circuit preparation service fee is one- time, the latter is fixed and can take as much as %20 of the monthly bill. The additional costs was heavily criticized by consumers, as the very slight difference between ADSL+Voice (over fixed-lines) and Naked DSL services has made the latter financially irrelevant. As of 2015, all major broadband retailers offer Naked ADSL service to consumers.  United Kingdom  Naked DSL service, excluding SDSL, is not widely available in the United Kingdom, but it is possible to get a POTS and DSL from different service providers.. The incumbent network operator, BT plc, have previously claimed there was not sufficient demand from ISPs to provide a Naked DSL service. Openreach are currently trialing a product called SOGEA (Single Order Generic Ethernet Access) which is a VDSL2 Profile 17a service without POTS. Additionally a third party ISP in the UK (LLU) can use SLU (Sub Loop Unbundling) to situate their own external cabinets in the Local Network with xDSL/Optical muxing hardware commonly known as MSANs.Samknows.com 21CN overviewBLA pres for BBWG Virgin Media provides broadband services without the requirement for a telephone line in HFC cabled areas only, but this is not naked DSL as the service is provided via a coaxial cable using DOCSIS from the street, rather that over a telephone line, active or otherwise. Some ISPs can provide a copper pair (with no telephone service) as part of their DSL package.AAISP Naked DSL  United States  On March 25, 2005, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) ruled 3-2 against utilities commissions in Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, and Louisiana, which wanted to force BellSouth to unbundle their DSL service from their local phone service.FCC unplugs states' rules on \\"naked\\" DSLFCC \\"Memorandum Opinion and Order and Notice of Inquiry\\" on \\"BellSouth Telecommunications, Inc. Request for Declaratory Ruling that State Commissions May Not Regulate Broadband Internet Access Services.\\" However, in that proceeding, as a compromise between the FCC Commissioners, the FCC released a Notice of Inquiry requesting comment on the \\"competitive consequences when providers bundle their legacy services with new services, or \\"tie\\" such services together\\"; that proceeding remains open before the FCC.Cybertelecom :: Naked DSL Later that year, during merger proceedings, the FCC required Verizon and AT&T; Inc. to offer naked-DSL for a period of two years as conditions to mergers; those conditions have since expired. AT&T; Inc. now provides naked DSL throughout most of the country, and Qwest Communications provides it voluntarily. Verizon Communications also provides it in some areas, although at a higher price than it charges customers who bundle it with regular phone service. Speakeasy also provides this service. Brand X Internet, a California-based Internet provider, offers naked DSL throughout Verizon territories in California, New York, and a number of other states where Verizon dry loop lines are available.Brand X Internet Offers Naked DSL Verizon does not connect dry loop lines to a phone jack, so customers must arrange to have the dry loop line connected to a jack in their office or home.

It has horns, blue fur, and a fanged smile, wearing breakaway orange plastic handcuffs. In 2018, Hasbro acquired the My Pet Monster brand from Saban Brands.  Plush  The My Pet Monster character began as a plush doll first produced by American Greetings in 1986. As one of the few plush dolls marketed to boys at the time, My Pet Monster was popular in the late 1980s and early 1990s. The doll has blue fur, horns and a fanged smile, and is recognizable by its orange plastic handcuffs. The handcuffs could also be worn by children and came with a breakaway link so that the child could simulate breaking the chain. Several versions of the doll have been released in various sizes and other attributes. Other characters were also created with brightly colored fur and unorthodox names like Gwonk, Wogster and Rark. Their popularity allowed a wealth of merchandise including coloring books, Golden Look-Look books, frame-tray puzzles and various other items. Capitalizing on the nostalgia in many children of the '80s, Toymax released a 22-inch tall talking My Pet Monster doll in 2001. Media The character's popularity spawned a live-action direct-to-video film in 1986 about a boy who becomes the Pet Monster after being exposed to a statue, changing when hungry. Dr Snyder, the scientist who originally discovered the statues and the legend behind them, wants to kidnap him for publicity purposes, while his sister helps her brother out of the crisis. My Pet Monster also spawned a children's cartoon series that ran for one season on ABC, produced by Ellipse (France), Nelvana (Canada), and Hi-Tops Video in association with Golden Books. The show follows Monster, who lives with a boy named Max. When Monster wears his handcuffs, they turn him into a stuffed animal. Max often does to keep Monster's existence secret from others. Max's sister, Jill, and his friend Chuckie, are the only ones that know this secret. The two main adversaries in the show are Mr. Hinkle, a neighbor who always thinks Max is up to something, but is not quite sure what; and Beastur, a large monster who hates light and tries to bring Monster back to MonsterLand. Beastur, though immense and fierce, is incompetent. He can be stopped by the magic cuffs -— which reduce him to a smaller, though still \\"alive\\" monster -— or by his own bungling, and sent back through the warp portal to his own world. He wears dark glasses to protect his sensitive eyes, which he can use to see in the dark. Beastur appears in nearly every episode as either a primary or secondary foe. On one notable occasion, he was scared back through the portal to Monsterland not by light or the cuffs, but by the affections of a smitten female gorilla. In the final episode, it is also shown that Beastur hates to be hugged, even more so than being exposed to light. Much of the voice cast of My Pet Monster returned 2 years later in 1989 for Beetlejuice, another cartoon show with a surreal theme and a supernatural world populated by fantastic monsters. Reruns of all 13 half-hour episodes aired on Teletoon Retro in Canada from September 5, 2011.

Nanabozho is the Ojibwe trickster figure and culture hero (these two archetypes are often combined into a single figure in First Nations mythologies, among others). Similar characters in other cultures Among the eastern Algonquian peoples located north of the Abenaki areas, a similar character to Nanabozho existed called Tcakabesh in the Algonquin language, Chikapash among the eastern James Bay Crees, Chaakaapaas by the Naskapi, Tshakapesh in the Innu language and Tcikapec in Atikamekw language, changing to various animal forms to various human forms (adult to child) and to various mythical animals such as the Great Porcupine, or Big Skunk. He conquered or diminished these mythical animals to smaller size after killing or changing them with his trickery or shapeshifting. Among the Meskwaki, Wīsakehā serves a similar role, as does Wisakedjak among northern Algonquian peoples and for the Saulteaux in the Great Plains. The Abenaki-influenced Algonquin had a similar figure called Kanòjigàbe (Fiero spelling: Ganoozhigaabe; Abenaki Gluskabe). Nanabozho name variations The Nanabozho name varies in the Ojibwe language depending on whether it is presented with a first-person prefix n- (i.e. Nanabozho), third- person prefix w- (i.e. Wanabozho), or null-person prefix m- (i.e. Manabozho); the \\"Manabozho\\" form of the name is most commonly associated with Menominee language version of these stories. In addition, depending on the story and the narrator's role in telling the story, the name may be presented in its regular nominative form (with the final o, i.e. Nanabozho) or in its vocative form (without the final o, i.e. Nanabozh). Due to the way the two o sounds, they are often each realized as oo (i.e. Nanaboozhoo). In some dialects, zh is realized as z. These variations allow for associating the name with the word for \\"rabbit(-)\\" (waabooz(o-)). Due to the placement of word stress, determined by metrical rules that define a characteristic iambic metrical foot, in which a weak syllable is followed by a strong syllable, in some dialects the weak syllable may be reduced to a schwa, which may be recorded as either i or e (e.g. Winabozho or Wenabozho if the first weak syllable is graphically shown, Nanabizho if the second weak syllable is graphically shown). In addition, though the Fiero double-vowel system uses zh, the same sound in other orthographies can be realized as j in the Algonquin system or š (or sh) in the Saulteaux-Cree system (e.g. Nanabozho v. Nanabojo). To this mix, depending on if the transcriber used French or English, the Anishinaabe name may be transcribed to fit the phonetic patterns of one of the two said languages (e.g. \\"Winnaboujou\\" and \\"Nanabijou\\": French rendering of Winabozho and Nanabizho respectively, or \\"Nanabush\\": English rendering of Nanabozh). Stories Nanabozho in the flood. (Illustration by R.C. Armour, from his book North American Indian Fairy Tales, Folklore and Legends, 1905) Nanabozho is one of four sons from what some historical and religious scholars have interpreted as spirits of directions.He is descended from a human mother, and his father spiritually impregnated a mother like the virgin birth of Jesus and other gods and heroes cross-culturally. The Anishinaabeg say the mother's name means \\"nourishment\\", but Henry Schoolcraft suggests the name is from the Dakota Winona (\\"first-born daughter\\"). He has a human mother, and E-bangishimog (\\"In the West\\"), a spirit father. Nanabozho most often appears in the shape of a rabbit and is characterized as a trickster. In his rabbit form, he is called Mishaabooz (\\"Great rabbit\\" or \\"Hare\\") or Gitchii-waabooz (\\"Big rabbit\\"). He was sent to Earth by Gitche Manitou to teach the Ojibwe. One of his first tasks was to name all the plants and animals. Nanabozho is considered to be the founder of Midewiwin. He is the inventor of fishing and hieroglyphs. This historical figure is a shapeshifter and a co-creator of the world. Henry Wadsworth Longfellow's epic poem, The Song of Hiawatha is an outsider retelling of several Nanabozho stories based on research conducted by Henry Rowe Schoolcraft. Mishaabooz name variations Like the transcription variations found among \\"Nanabozho,\\" often Mishaabooz is transcribed into French as Michabous and represented in English as Michabou. Additional name variations include: \\"Winneboujou, Winabojo, Wenabozho, Wenaboozhoo, Waynaboozhoo, Wenebojo, Nanaboozhoo, Nanabojo, Nanabushu, Nanabush, Nanapush, Nenabush, Nenabozho, Nanabosho, Manabush, Manabozho, Manibozho, Nanahboozho, Minabozho, Manabus, Manibush, Manabozh, Manabozo, Manabozho, Manabusch, Manabush, Manabus, Menabosho, Nanaboojoo, Nanaboozhoo, Nanaboso, Nanabosho, Nenabuc, Amenapush, Ne-Naw-bo-zhoo, Kwi-wi-sens Nenaw-bo-zhoo [...] Michabo, Michabou, Michabous, Michaboo, Mishabo, Michabo, Misabos, Misabooz, Messou\\" http://www.native-languages.org/nanabozho.htm  See also  * _Aayaase_ *Naniboujou Club Lodge *Sleeping Giant (Ontario) *Winneboujou, Wisconsin NotesReferences * Benton-Banai, Edward.

Biography He was born in New York City to Henry and Frances Kesselring. His father's parents were immigrants from Germany. His mother was an English Canadian.US Census 1920, New York Borough of Manhattan, enumeration district 913, Sheet 19A Kesselring spent much of his life in and around the theater. In 1922, he began teaching vocal music and directed stage productions at Bethel College, a Mennonite school in North Newton, Kansas. After two years, Kesselring left teaching and returned to the stage, working for two years with an amateur theatrical group in Niagara, New York.Dramaturgy: Notes from the Director , Methacton Community Theater website. Retrieved February 19, 2010. He began working as a freelance playwright in 1933, completing 12 original plays, of which four were produced on Broadway: There's Wisdom in Women (1935), Arsenic and Old Lace (1939), Four Twelves are 48 (1951), and Mother of that Wisdom (1963). Arsenic and Old Lace was his masterpiece. It ran for 1444 performances on Broadway and 1337 performances in London, and became a staple in high school and dinner theater circuits. The 1944 movie adaptation was also a comedy hit. Arsenic and Old Lace appeared at a time of strong isolationist sentiment regarding European affairs, of the sort that was very strong where Kesselring went to college. The play suggested that the elite running America had a murderous heritage. Kesselring lived in a college house that would later be the basis of the set of Arsenic and Old Lace, and locals have tried to identify who were some of the character models he used. Kesselring was an Episcopalian who did not fit in well with the strait-laced college. He dropped out of college in 1924.See Keith L. Sprunger, \\"Another Look Another Look: Joseph Kesselring, Bethel College, and the Origins of Arsenic and Old Lace, Menonnite Life (May, 2013). Kesselring died on November 5, 1967, in Kingston, New York, at the age of 65. In 1980, the National Arts Club created the Joseph Kesselring Prize for up-and-coming playwrights. It was funded by Kesselring's widow, Charlotte. Among the playwrights who have won the prize are Tony Kushner, David Adjmi, Doug Wright, Anna Deavere Smith, David Auburn, Rajiv Joseph, Melissa James Gibson, Jo Carson, Nicky Silver, David Lindsay-Abaire, José Rivera, Naomi Wallace, Philip Kan Gotanda, Kira Obolensky, Tracey Scott Wilson, and Marion McClinton.The Kesselring Fellowship , The National Arts Club, The Exchange website.

Linden plays acoustic and electric guitar, specializing in slide guitar, country blues, and ragtime fingerpicking. He frequently collaborates with country and folk performers. He is a member of Blackie and the Rodeo Kings with Stephen Fearing and Tom Wilson. He has worked with Bruce Cockburn, Lucinda Williams, T-Bone Burnett, Kevin Gordon, Colin James, Emmylou Harris, Leon Redbone, Rita Chiarelli, Chris Thomas King, The Band, Keb' Mo', Charles Esten and Bob Dylan. Career=Early years Linden was born in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. When he was still an infant, his family moved to White Plains, New York. The ten-year-old Linden heard rock performers in New York venues, such as Van Morrison, the Flying Burrito Brothers, James Taylor, John Mayall, Johnny Winter and Taj Mahal. 1970s When the family moved back to Toronto, Linden became interested in performers such as Taj Mahal, Mississippi Fred McDowell and Howlin' Wolf. When Howlin' Wolf played at Toronto's Colonial Tavern, the then-11-year-old Linden spent three hours talking with the elder bluesman. He began performing at a local coffee house, the Fiddler's Green Coffee House, singing and strumming a guitar. By 1973, Linden began learning how to finger pick. When Linden met David Wilcox, Linden decided to learn how to play slide guitar. Wilcox gave 140 blues albums to young Linden, to help Linden to learn about blues styles. Paul Mills, the producer of Sylvia Tyson's Touch the Earth show, at the Winnipeg Folk Festival and an outlet on CBC Radio for acoustic roots music, booked Linden in 1975 . At the Winnipeg Folk Festival, Colin met Mississippi bluesman Sam Chatmon, and later that year made a pilgrimage to U.S. to meet South Detroit's Sippie Wallace. North Carolina's Peg Leg Sam, and Mississippi's Son House. In 1976 Wilcox had asked Linden to join his band, the Teddy Bears, which meant that Linden had to learn to play the electric guitar. In 1977, he played solo gigs and did his first western Canadian tour, which was booked by Holger Petersen. In Edmonton he met then 13-year-old Colin James, also a budding blues performer. In the late 1970s, Linden formed his own group, the Group du Jour, which played a mix of covers and a few Linden originals, and a group called the Lucky Charms, which was featured on his first album \\"Colin Linden Live!!!!!\\" (1980) . In 1979, Linden recorded the Sam Chatmon album. 1980s In August 1980, Linden recorded his album Colin Linden Live! He also played as a sideman for Joe Mendelson, Willie P. Bennett, Gwen Swick and Amos Garrett. His second album, Colin Linden and the Immortals was released by Stony Plain Records in 1986. Linden has acknowledged the influence of the Band; in the early 1980s, Linden met three of its original members, Rick Danko, Garth Hudson and Levon Helm. Members of the Band contributed to Linden's recordings, and songs like \\"When the Spirit Comes\\" got radio airplay and \\"Miles Away from You\\" made the rock charts. When the Spirit Comes was released by A & M in 1987. Linden signed a publishing deal with Warner Chappell and did producing for Mendelson Joe, Morgan Davis, Jackson Delta and Hans Thessink. 1990s Linden (left) as part of Blackie and the Rodeo Kings In 1991, Bruce Cockburn recruited Linden as a sideman, and for three- and-a-half years, Linden played guitar for Cockburn. Subsequently, Linden became his co-producer. Linden's blues album of 1993, entitled South at Eight, North at Nine, distributed by Sony Music Entertainment in Canada, won a Juno Award in the blues and gospel category. Guests on the album included Bruce Cockburn and Rick Danko, Garth Hudson and Levon Helm of the Band. As Linden got more interested in gospel records, he began taking vocal lessons from Bourbon Tabernacle Choir singer Dave Wall, such as breathing and warm-up exercises. In 1996, Linden won a Juno in the blues and gospel category for his producing Lennie Gallant's The Open Window. Linden co-wrote Colin James's hit song \\"Real Stuff\\". That same year, he joined with Tom Wilson of Junkhouse and Stephen Fearing to form Blackie and the Rodeo Kings. This band was a tribute to Canadian singer-songwriter Willie P. Bennett. After the album High or Hurtin', on True North Records, their second album, Kings of Love, won a Juno. In February 1998 Linden shared the Maple Blues Producer of the Year award with Colin James. A Tribute to Howlin' Wolf was released by Telarc Records in 1998. In 1999, A Tribute to Howlin' Wolf was nominated for a Grammy Award in the category Best Traditional Blues Album. In 1999, Linden received the Toronto Arts Award.  2000s  In 2000 Linden won three Juno awards: in the category \\"Blues\\", as the producer of Ray Bonneville's Gust of Wind; in the category \\"Roots and Traditional: Solo Artist\\", as the producer of Bruce Cockburn's Breakfast in New Orleans, Dinner in Timbuktu; And in the \\"Roots and Traditional: Group\\" category, as a member of Blackie and the Rodeo Kings. In 2000, Linden produced Sue Foley's Love Comin' Down and Paul Reddick and the Sidemen's Rattle Bag. For the album Big Mouth, a more acoustic recording, Linden recruited Keb' Mo', Bruce Cockburn, and other musicians. In 2002 Big Mouth won a Juno for Best Blues Album. In 2002, an album Linden worked on, Timeless, won the Grammy for Country Album of the Year. In 2002, he co- produced Stephen Fearing's That's How I Walk and Bruce Cockburn's You've Never Seen Everything. In 2003, a third Blackie and the Rodeo Kings album, BARK, was released, and in 2006 they released Let's Frolic and Let's Frolic Again. In 2003, he had a minor role in the film \\"Intolerable Cruelty\\" as a singing, guitar playing minister and was featured performing Paul Simon's \\"The Boxer\\" during the closing credits. 2010s On 15 July 2013 Linden joined Bob Dylan's band for eleven dates until 3 August 2013 [when Charlie Sexton rejoined Dylan's band], playing the first show in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. He was featured on Diana Krall's album Glad Rag Doll in 2012 and Rhiannon Giddens's Tomorrow Is My Turn in 2014. Linden has been a main musician, music producer, music director and songwriter for the ABC television show \\"Nashville\\" since its inception in 2012. He has performed electric, acoustic and slide guitar on most of the show's recorded musical numbers and appears regularly on screen in many of the live performance scenes. His primary residence has been in Nashville since the late 1990s. Linden performed as part of the house band for a T Bone Burnett–produced gospel music concert at the White House on 14 April 2015. Following the end of Nashville, Linden has been a member of star Charles Esten's band and has toured both the US and the UK with him. Personal life Linden married Janice Powers on 14 February 1988.

Hementin is a calcium-dependent protease with a molecular weight of 80-120 kDa, and it contains 39 amino acid sequences. Hementin is present in both the anterior and posterior salivary glands, however it is mostly produced from certain cells in the anterior gland. The secretion of the hementin is limited to the lumen of the proboscis, which the Amazon leech inserts into the host to suck the blood. Hementin dissolves platelet-rich blood clots and lets the blood flow through the proboscis. Hementin is able to dissolve a type of blood clots that cannot be dissolved by other compound, such as streptokinase and urokinase. The processes of blood anticoagulation by hementin includes the degradation of fibrinogen. It is capable of disrupting the function of fibrinogen, a glycoprotein responsible for blood clotting, by cleaving three peptide bonds in its structure. Hementin is also capable of segregating platelets by cleaving the fibrinogen cross-link amongst the platelets. Fibrinogen acts as a substrate for thrombin, which converts the protein into its functional form, fibrin. Cleavage of fibrinogen in its native conformation at AαAsn102-Asn103, BβLys130-Gln131, and ϓPro76-Asn77 yield three sets of products. Hementin may also cause platelet deaggregation, although not under all circumstances. Because of its anticoagulant effects, Hementin can be described as a hemostatic regulator.

Played by Ben Browder, Cameron Mitchell is introduced as a main character in the season 9 premiere \\"Avalon\\", holding the military rank of Lieutenant Colonel in the United States Air Force. Learning of the SG-1 team's off-screen separation after the previous season, Mitchell is assigned as new commanding officer of SG-1, which he remains throughout season 10 (2006-2007) and the direct-to-DVD films Stargate: The Ark of Truth, ending at the rank of Colonel for Stargate: Continuum (2008). The first episodes of season 9 show Mitchell's struggle to reunite the former SG-1 members under his command. With the aid of Lt. Col. Samantha Carter, Dr. Daniel Jackson, the Jaffa Teal'c, and the alien thief Vala Mal Doran, Mitchell attempts to stop the Ori threat to the Milky Way galaxy during the series' run. Mitchell is an experienced fighter pilot and is often involved in close combat. Despite Browder's popularity as former lead in the sci-fi TV series Farscape, Mitchell's role as the SG-1 leader attracted some viewers' resentment for taking over Carter's former position. Browder noted a lack of Mitchell-centric episodes and insufficient interaction between Mitchell and the other main characters. For his portrayal of Cameron Mitchell, Ben Browder was nominated for a Saturn Award in the category \\"Best Supporting Actor on Television\\" in 2006. Role in Stargate SG-1=Character arc Lieutenant Colonel Cameron Mitchell is the son of Frank and Wendy Mitchell, long-time residents of Auburn, Kansas. * Poster: \\"Class of 1987\\" * Mitchell: \\"You know, Colorado Springs, it's not that far away, so maybe someday soon, you might think about taking a little trip.\\" / Amy Vanderberg: \\"Maybe.\\" Mitchell occasionally mentions his Bible-thumping grandmother in comparison and contrast to the Ori religion. * Mitchell: \\"My grandma was a bit of a Bible-thumper. Weekends at grandma's meant long, long Sundays at St. Hilda's Church of the Grand Epiphany.\\" * Mitchell: \\"My grandma used to say, 'God is like a prairie windstorm. If you look too hard, you get dust in your eyes, but there's still plenty of ways to know it's there.'\\" As shown in Stargate: Continuum, Mitchell's grandfather was the captain of the ship that transported the Alpha Gate from Egypt to the United States in the late 1930s. Two episodes flash back to Mitchell's past. As revealed in \\"Collateral Damage\\", Mitchell's father was a test pilot for the United States Air Force and lost both legs in an accident when Mitchell was a child. When Cameron Mitchell was a USAF Captain, he piloted an F-16 over the Middle Eastern desert and mistakenly bombed a vehicle containing innocent refugees rather than the enemy. * Mitchell: \\"We're watching the launch of the first Space Shuttle. I can't be much more than ten years old.\\" * Mitchell: \\"Who was in the convoy, sir?\\" / Davidson: \\"As far as we know, it was a group of refugees. This wasn't your fault.\\" / Mitchell: \\"That doesn't change the fact that I have to live with it for the rest of my life.\\" The season 9 premiere \\"Avalon\\" flashes back to Lieutenant Colonel Mitchell during the events over Antarctica in season 7's \\"Lost City\\". Mitchell led a squadron of F-302 fighters against the forces of the arch villain Anubis and was shot down, resulting in severe injuries. During his recovery in the hospital, he received the Medal of Honor and was promised any assignment by Brigadier General Jack O'Neill. * Carter: \\"The Congressional Medal of Honor is the highest award for valor in action against an enemy force that can be bestowed upon an individual serving in the Armed Services of the United States of America. On behalf of the President...\\" * O'Neill: \\"Get well soon. And when you do, you can do anything you want, and I mean professionally, anything you want. Well not... anything.\\" * Mitchell: \\"General, I'm here to join SG-1.\\" / Landry: \\"Colonel, you're here to lead SG-1.\\" / Landry: \\"Uh, what about Lieutenant Colonel Carter?\\" / Landry: \\"She's taken command of Stargate's R&D; out of Area 51.\\" [...] / Mitchell: \\"And Daniel Jackson?\\" / Landry: \\"Dr. Jackson put in for reassignment. Teal'c left the program over a month ago.\\" * Vala: \\"But I know nothing about your fair planet... other than it seems to have a rather interesting, if somewhat limited, gene pool.\\" Mitchell began reading all mission reports that the SG-1 team had filed. * Carter: \\"You really did read every report from every mission we ever went on, didn't you?\\" / Mitchell: \\"I was in that hospital a long time, and they were all riveting.\\" In his first appearance in the season 9 premiere \\"Avalon\\", Mitchell has fully recovered and opts to join SG-1. When he learns that the original team has moved on to new assignments, he becomes the new SG-1 leader but fails to assemble a new team. After the alien Vala Mal Doran arrives on Earth, Dr. Daniel Jackson and the alien Teal'c assist Mitchell for a treasure hunt on Earth that eventually sets off the Ori arc. Mitchell takes his place at the head of this provisional team rather reluctantly. Lieutenant Colonel Samantha Carter temporarily joins Mitchell's team in season 9's sixth episode, \\"Beachhead\\", which ends with Vala's disappearance. Mitchell officially reunites the former SG-1 team one episode later in \\"Ex Deus Machina\\". Vala reappears in late season 9 and officially joins SG-1 under Mitchell's command in season 10's \\"Memento Mori\\". Mitchell continues to lead SG-1 in Stargate: The Ark of Truth and is promoted to Colonel before his appearance in Stargate: Continuum (where the credits mistakenly list him as \\"Lieutenant Colonel\\"). Characterization At the beginning of season 9, Mitchell's main motivation is to get the SG-1 team back together. Producer Robert C. Cooper wanted Cameron Mitchell to mirror the Stargate fandom and be a \\"super fan\\" of SG-1 and a \\"Stargate geek\\", who is enthusiastic about exploring the galaxy. Nevertheless, Browder described Mitchell as a \\"stoic\\" character who \\"actually follows military protocol\\"; the character has \\"a certain naïvety and innocence, even though he is neither particularly naïve or innocent\\". Mitchell's personality and attitude depends on his location (on-base and off- world) and the people around him. With Mitchell's team demeanor becoming subtler in season 10, Browder felt that the writers \\"finally figured out Mitchell's only superpower is getting beat up and bleeding\\". Browder considered Mitchell to be more restrained than his former Farscape character John Crichton, who had higher emotional stakes and was \\"literally going insane through the process of the series. Mitchell's focus was on his job, and on the fun of his job. But Crichton's focus was on survival, and on the creation of a family.\\" Crichton was also the center of the Farscape narrative, whereas the SG-1 characters serve as nearly equal parts in an ensemble show. Browder did not view Mitchell as a substitute for Richard Dean Anderson's role of Colonel Jack O'Neill, the undisputed SG-1 team leader from seasons 1 through 7. While O'Neill's approach was \\"normally couched in sarcastic terms\\" in later years, Mitchell is \\"more optimistic and has a wry sense about him that's not so much sarcastic\\". Relationships Mitchell maintains a level of decorum around General Landry (Beau Bridges), but is more laid-back around the SG-1 members. Michael Shanks (Daniel Jackson) and Browder did not want to repeat the \\"cliché[d]\\" original O'Neill-Daniel dynamic where views on military and diplomacy clash. The actors tried to find some commonality between the characters while trying to develop an entertaining rapport between them. By mid-season 9, their interaction had become playful, without being decidedly positive or antagonistic. Although Mitchell and Teal'c (Christopher Judge) are both warriors and leaders, Teal'c is taken aback by Mitchell's enthusiasm at first, as he is more used to O'Neill's reserved attitude. Teal'c is unsure if he likes Mitchell, but Mitchell forces Teal'c to interact with him. By not letting Teal'c step back and observe, Mitchell makes Teal'c an active part of the scene. Because Ben Browder and Claudia Black (Vala Mal Doran) were well known for formerly starring as star-crossed lovers in Farscape, the Stargate producers refrained from emphasizing the pairing of Mitchell and Vala beyond in-jokes.Upon meeting Mitchell for the first time in the Season 9 premiere \\"Avalon\\", Vala remarks \\"I know we haven't met. That I'm sure I would remember.\\" The episode \\"200\\" features a short parody segment where Vala imagines the SG-1 members playing various Farscape characters. Vala plays Black's old role of Aeryn Sun, while Mitchell (Browder) plays the Farscape character Stark. Daniel (Shanks) plays Browder's old role of John Crichton. The producers instead opted to further the comedic chemistry between Claudia Black and Michael Shanks. When Vala's relationship with the SG-1 team members evolved in season 10, the producers grew comfortable with pairing Browder's and Black's characters more often, and even teased (and misled) viewers about them \\"end[ing] up in a motel room bed together\\" in the episode \\"Memento Mori\\", involving underwear, \\"handcuffs as well as creamy Twinkies\\". A scene in the milestone episode \\"200\\" also parodied the show's connection to Farscape. Amanda Tapping (Samantha Carter) found that the introduction of the Ori threat inhibited major character and relationship development in season 9. The characters are of equal rank, and regard each other with respect according to producer Joseph Mallozzi. They give each other fair weight in decision-making, and Mitchell defers to Carter on all science-related issues. Tapping's favorite Mitchell-Carter scenes were some \\"neat sibling-type moments\\" in \\"Arthur's Mantle\\", and moments showing their history and friendship in \\"Line in the Sand\\", \\"The Road Not Taken\\", and Stargate: The Ark of Truth. Browder regretted after season 10 that he had not worked enough with the cast besides Tapping, and that \\"the fans probably feel that way as well\\". Several episodes hint at Mitchell's love life. The early episodes of season 9 suggest a relationship between Mitchell and Landry's daughter, Dr. Carolyn Lam (Lexa Doig); a scripted romantic subplot in \\"Avalon\\" was filmed but was cut for time when the two-parter ran long for over twenty minutes. In season 9's \\"Collateral Damage\\", Mitchell has a romantic encounter with a female human researcher from another planet, named Reya Varrick but she is killed. At his 20-year high school reunion in \\"Bounty\\", Mitchell lays the foundation for a relationship with his high school crush, Amy Vanderburg. SG-1 leadership Mitchell was conceived as the leader of SG-1 who brings the team back together. Following negative fan reactions to Carter's cancelled leadership within the team (she commanded SG-1 throughout season 8), Browder noted the production difficulties that came with Amanda Tapping's maternity leave, and claimed that new leaders are brought in routinely into units in military reality. Tapping admitted to also have been \\"kind of put off\\" upon learning that someone else would lead SG-1, and hoped that the producers would make SG-1 more of an ensemble team in season 10 by removing the patriarchal line of command. The writers decided after an animated discussion after the initial season 9 episodes that Mitchell and Carter should co-command the team, although they left Mitchell in the official leadership position. Whereas Mitchell can hardly cope with leading the team in season 9, Mitchell is more comfortable with his leadership position in Stargate: The Ark of Truth. Browder described Mitchell's early leadership difficulties as \\"dealing with what are essentially legendary characters within the mythology of the show\\"; ordering them around would ring false or as hubris from both an audience- and storytelling perspective. Tapping eventually considered the question of leadership irrelevant; Mitchell cannot give orders to his team since he and Carter hold the same military rank, and Daniel and Teal'c are not members of the United States military. Mitchell thus plays more to the strength of the team, choosing a leadership style that is comparable to elite teams like Delta units, where everyone participates to the fullest of their abilities and defers to the specialist quickly when needed. Conceptual history=Conception Ben Browder at a Farscape convention in 2004, a year before being cast as Cameron Mitchell on SG-1 The producers had discussed casting Ben Browder as a possible Major John Sheppard and Colonel Dillon Everett for the first season of Stargate Atlantis. Browder was still filming Farscape at that time, but had met several Stargate producers on sci-fi conventions. With Richard Dean Anderson's (Jack O'Neill) departure from Stargate SG-1 after season 8 (2005), Ben Browder and the Stargate producers got together as soon as the introduction of new main characters was discussed. Browder's character was codenamed \\"M.M.\\" until the producers settled on the name \\"Cameron 'Cam' Mitchell\\", with the aviator call sign \\"Shaft\\", a pun on camshaft. * Pendergast: \\"Shaft... Welcome back to the Prometheus.\\" / Mitchell: \\"Thank you, Colonel.\\" / Carter: \\"Shaft?\\" / Mitchell: \\"My call sign. Cam. Shaft.\\" Also joining the main cast in season 9 was Beau Bridges as General Hank Landry. The alien Vala Mal Doran (played by Browder's former Farscape co-star Claudia Black) was re-introduced for a six-episode story arc to cover for the maternity leave of SG-1 regular Amanda Tapping (Lieutenant-Colonel Samantha Carter). Since the producers had not realized the physical resemblance between Browder and Michael Shanks (Daniel Jackson) when Browder was cast, Shanks grew a beard that he would sport in the first six episodes of season 9; the characters would also often wear differently-colored Battle Dress Uniforms. Vala's line in \\"Avalon\\" that Earth seems to have a \\"limited gene pool\\" refers to the actors' similar looks. Having sporadically watched episodes of SG-1 over the years, Browder watched the first previous seasons of SG-1 in two-and- a-half weeks to catch up with the show, which the writers would turn into a recurring in-joke that Mitchell had read every SG-1 mission report before joining the SG-1 team. Browder relocated to Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, where Stargate SG-1 was being filmed. His family, who had been with him in Australia during his Farscape years, stayed in Los Angeles, although Browder's children would appear as background characters in \\"The Ties That Bind\\" during their set visit. Development Browder put the character's direction into the hands of the writers but thought that the audience would define Mitchell through the character's actions and words and not by his backstory in the end. He wanted to humanize the character without letting him be entirely dictated by military terms, while turning him slowly into as much a hero as the other SG-1 team members already are. Producer Robert C. Cooper, who wrote Mitchell's introduction in the first three episodes of season 9, wanted Mitchell to be enthusiastic about exploring the galaxy from the beginning. Mitchell should be a \\"super fan\\" of SG-1 and a \\"Stargate geek\\", mirroring the Stargate fandom. Browder did not want the character's first on- screen reaction to be enthusiasm, so the character was written to be stoic and guarded around General Landry in the first scenes. Cooper incorporated Mitchell into a flashback to a memorable SG-1 scene from season 7's \\"Lost City\\" to avoid a contrived heroic action by Mitchell in the season 9 opener. Although Mitchell was the leading man, most episodes in the first half of season 9 do not particularly focus on Mitchell. Several writers, who had been used to Anderson's reduced filming schedule in past seasons, subconsciously diminished Mitchell's role until Cooper reminded them of Browder's full-season contract. Although Mitchell had a more prominent role in the season 10 episodes \\"Uninvited\\", \\"Company of Thieves\\", and \\"Bounty\\", Browder noted the lack of Mitchell-centric episodes in season 10. Producer Joseph Mallozzi explained this as the result of having to service the Ori arc and Vala as the new main character. Mitchell also did not appear in any Stargate Atlantis episodes, which Browder explained with the lack of history between Mitchell and Atlantis; for instance, Daniel possesses Ancient knowledge, and Carter shares a history with the Atlantis character Rodney McKay (David Hewlett). Having penned two Farscape episodes, Browder did not pitch possible SG-1 storylines to the producers until season 10. Browder received story credit for his basic pitch for season 10's \\"Bad Guys\\", which Stargate Atlantis producer/writer Martin Gero developed into a teleplay. Stunt work and on- screen violence Mitchell is often at the center of the action and fight sequences. Browder joked for years that \\"Mitchell's super power is getting his ass whipped\\", which was the opposite of the powerful warrior Teal'c. Browder enjoyed the physicality of the role and wanted to do many of his own stunts. Browder had acquired first fight experiences in drama school, and had done much stunt work on Farscape. Browder worked with fight choreographers in seasons 9 and 10 of Stargate SG-1. Browder's first fight sequence on SG-1 was a sword fight with a knight in \\"Avalon\\", where Browder did not have a stunt double and used real swords because heavy swords look more real in action. This fight was followed by an elaborate fight to the death with a Sodan Jaffa warrior in \\"Babylon\\". Although writer Paul Mullie was concerned that fans might be put off by the violence and darkness of \\"Collateral Damage\\", where Mitchell has memories of beating a love interest to death, the producers did not want to shortchange Mitchell's emotional journey and chose to not shy away from violence in the episode. Browder played another sword fight in \\"Camelot\\", and was involved in an extended hand-to-hand combat with a Replicator- possessed IOA member James Marrick (played by Currie Graham) in The Ark of Truth. Reception Although TV Zone's Stephen Graves believed that Ben Browder and Claudia Black's first post-Farscape encounter in \\"Avalon\\" was \\"somewhat underplayed\\", he considered Mitchell's introduction entertaining, with Mitchell's \\"excruciating\\" interviews with potential new recruits as \\"a particular highlight\\". However, Graves was disappointed that Mitchell did not contribute much to the story after the knight fight, and that Mitchell's \\"frantic\\" efforts to get the old SG-1 team back together hinted too much at the production team's efforts to turn around the season 8 finale. While some fans were upset that Carter did not resume command of the SG-1 team after her return, Leonard Fischer of The Seattle Times considered Browder and Michael Shanks to have developed \\"some fun on-screen rapport\\" by the middle of season 9. By season 10's \\"Memento Mori\\", TV Zone's Anthony Brown felt that \\"Ben Browder and Claudia Black have [...] reached a point where they can play out an amusing take on Misery without you feeling that [their Farscape characters] have somehow starbursted onto SG-1's Earth\\". Maureen Ryan of The Chicago Tribune called Browder and Black's interaction in season 10 \\"great fun; the rapport they developed on the stellar Farscape was still much in evidence, even though they played radically different characters on SG-1.\\" For his portrayal of Cameron Mitchell, Ben Browder was nominated for a Saturn Award in the category \\"Best Supporting Actor on Television\\" in 2006. Per popular demand, Diamond Select Toys included Mitchell in their third series of Stargate action figures.

In the film, she is played by Honor Blackman. The character returns in the 2015 Bond continuation novel Trigger Mortis by Anthony Horowitz, set in the 1950s two weeks after the events of Goldfinger. Blanche Blackwell, a Jamaican of Anglo-Jewish descent, is thought to have been the love of Fleming's later life and his model for Pussy Galore. Appearances=Fleming novel In Fleming's 1959 novel Goldfinger, Pussy Galore is the only woman in the United States known to be running an organized crime gang. Initially trapeze artists, her group of performing catwomen, \\"Pussy Galore and her Abrocats\\", is unsuccessful, and so the women train as cat burglars instead. Her group evolves into an all-lesbian organization, based in Harlem, known as the Cement Mixers. In the novel, she has black hair, pale skin, and (according to Bond) the only violet eyes that Bond has ever seen. She is in her thirties, her voice low and attractive. Pussy tells Bond that she became a lesbian after she was sexually abused by her uncle at the age of 12. Auric Goldfinger enlists the help of Pussy and her Cement Mixers to carry out \\"Operation Grand Slam\\", a scheme to kill all the soldiers guarding Fort Knox by poisoning their water supply with a water-borne nerve agent (GB, also called sarin), and then to use a nuclear weapon which he had purchased from a quartermaster storekeeper at an Allied military base in Germany for one million dollars to blow open the United States Bullion Depository and contaminate the one billion dollars of gold stored there with the nuclear bomb to make it radioactive, which will vastly increase the value of his gold holdings.Goldfinger, chapters 17 & 18 Goldfinger chooses the Cement Mixers because he needs a group of women to impersonate the nurses in the fake emergency medical teams he plans to send into the poison-stricken Fort Knox. After Bond and Felix Leiter foil \\"Grand Slam\\", Galore runs into Bond while impersonating a stewardess on Goldfinger's hijacked escape flight to the Soviet Union (which carries his remaining fortune in gold). Bond, having previously been drugged by a fake vaccination, has been kidnapped and transported onto the plane to join Goldfinger, who is determined to kill him at last. However, Bond punctures one of the airplane's windows with a knife (causing Goldfinger's henchman Oddjob to be blown out and plunge to his death), then tackles Goldfinger, and, in the ensuing struggle, kills him. Bond then forces the crew of the airplane to reverse course. When the gold-heavy craft runs out of fuel, and the crew must ditch it in the ocean, Bond and Pussy are the only ones who manage to escape into a life raft. It is hinted at the end of the novel that Pussy is sent to prison, as she says to Bond, \\"Will you write to me in Sing Sing?\\" Her original band of Amazonian catwomen appear as characters in the film, but as small-aircraft aerobatic pilots rather than trapeze artists. Continuation novel Pussy returns in the 2015 Bond continuation novel Trigger Mortis by Anthony Horowitz, set in the 1950s two weeks after the events of Goldfinger. The novel contains material written, but previously unreleased, by Fleming. Film In the film, Galore is first seen when Bond wakes up in Goldfinger's private jet, having been knocked out with a tranquiliser gun by a Goldfinger henchman. He is lying on a couch when he regains consciousness, and since the first thing he sees when he opens his eyes is her stunning blonde-framed visage leaning over him, the dialog runs as follows: She is the leader of Pussy Galore's Flying Circus, a group of women aviators connected with Goldfinger's \\"Operation Grand Slam\\" (played in certain scenes by stuntmen in blonde wigs). In a later scene, Pussy uses judo to attack Bond after she catches him eavesdropping on Goldfinger's plan, and turns him over to Goldfinger. However, Bond corners Galore in a barn and forcibly holds her down and kisses her. She initially tries to fight him off, but she gives in and returns his kiss passionately, and they have sex. She then secretly turns against Goldfinger; she alerts the CIA to her employer's scheme, and they help her replace the deadly nerve gas that Goldfinger is planning to have her aviators spray over Fort Knox with a different, harmless substance. Having foiled Goldfinger's plan, Bond boards the President's private plane to travel to the White House. Goldfinger, now a fugitive, forces Galore to participate in hijacking the plane in order to force the pilot to fly him to Cuba. However, Bond defeats Goldfinger by shooting out the plane's window and causing him to be sucked out of the plane at high altitude and to plunge to his death. Bond then saves Galore from the crashing plane: they both bail out, land safely in an unidentified tropical region, and are presumed to have sex under their parachute.  Reception  Pussy ranked second in a poll of favourite Bond girls by Entertainment Weekly in 2007, beaten only by Ursula Andress' character Honey Ryder. Yahoo! Movies had her name included in the 2012 list of the best Bond girl names, calling it \\"The most famous Bond Girl name, and also the rudest — U.S. censors almost cut it from Goldfinger.\\"  In popular culture  The 1997 parody film Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery features a character named Alotta Fagina in an apparent reference to Galore (and perhaps also to the many other double-entendre named Bond girls, such as Octopussy and Holly Goodhead). The Rolex GMT-Master reference 6542 is nicknamed \\"Pussy Galore\\" because the movie character wears this particular watch. Two Republic F-105 Thunderchief aircraft, both single-seat D-models, were christened \\"Pussy Galore\\" and \\"Pussy Galore II\\" by Capt Victor \\"Vic\\" Vizcarra in 1965 and 1967. Both aircraft were lost during the Vietnam War. Pussy Galore I was shot down over Hanoi. Pussy Galore II was damaged in a ground accident in Taiwan and was a total write-off. Both planes had nose art with female genitalia overlaying openings used to refuel the jets while airborne via aerial refueling. The markings never lasted long, as wing commanders tended to go apoplectic when they were seen.https://theaviationgeekclub.com/heres-why-the-infamous-f-105-pussy- galore-was-an-incredible-morale-booster/ ReferencesBibliography * Category:Bond girls Category:Bond villains Category:Goldfinger (film) Category:Fictional aviators Category:Literary characters introduced in 1959 Category:Fictional gangsters Category:Fictional lesbians Category:Fictional child sexual abuse victims Category:Fictional LGBT characters in film Category:Fictional trapeze artists Category:LGBT villains Category:Fictional LGBT characters in literature Category:Action film villains ","title":"Pussy Galore"},{"id":"1484174","text":"The Aquarium of the Pacific (formerly the Long Beach Aquarium of the Pacific) is a public aquarium on a site on Rainbow Harbor in Long Beach, California, United States. It is situated across the water from the Long Beach Convention Center, Shoreline Village, and the Queen Mary Hotel and Attraction. The Aquarium sees 1.5 million visitors a year and has a total staff of about 1,875 people, including more than 1,500 volunteers and about 375 employees. It is a 501(c)(3) non-profit aquarium. The Aquarium is an accredited member of the Association of Zoos and Aquariums (AZA). Exhibits The Aquarium features a collection of over 11,000 animals representing over 500 different species in exhibits ranging in size and capacity from about 5,000 to 350,000 gallons. Exhibits introduce the inhabitants and seascapes of the Pacific, while also focusing on specific conservation messages associated with each region. The Pacific Ocean is the focus of three major permanent galleries, sunny Southern California and Baja, the frigid waters of the Northern Pacific and the colorful reefs of the Tropical Pacific. A diver addressing a group of visitors using a specially adapted mask in the Blue Cavern exhibit. Southern California & Baja Gallery The Southern California & Baja Gallery features the varied habitats of this region. The first exhibit is the three-story Blue Cavern tank, which houses animals that live in the waters surrounding nearby Catalina Island. Next is the Amber Forest exhibit, which replicates a Giant kelp forest with Garibaldi, California scorpionfish, and other representative organisms. The Gulf of California exhibit houses Cortez rainbow wrasse, Mexican lookdowns, Porcupine fish, and others. Other areas of the gallery include the Seal and Sea Lion Habitat, Ray Touch Pool, and Shorebird Sanctuary. Northern Pacific Gallery The Northern Pacific Gallery focuses on organisms from the Bering Sea. Exhibits include the Sea Otter Habitat, home to southern sea otters; the giant Pacific octopus tank; and Diving Birds, where puffins and auklets live. Other species on display include Japanese spider crabs, jellyfish, and sea anemones. Tropical Pacific Gallery The Tropical Pacific Gallery exhibits animals off the coast of the islands of Palau and has the aquarium's largest tank, the Tropical Reef Habitat. This tank houses olive ridley sea turtles, zebra sharks, and many other species. Elsewhere in the Gallery are big-belly seahorses, leafy seadragons, weedy seadragons, and sea kraits. Explorer's Cove Three Rainbow Lorikeets at the Aquarium The Aquarium's main outdoor area, Explorer's Cove, encompasses the Shark Lagoon and Lorikeet Forest. =Shark Lagoon= This exhibit area houses over 150 sharks and rays. The main tank houses larger spec rays, whitetip reef sharks, nurse sharks, and sand tiger sharks, while the more docile Bamboo and epaulette sharks live in the three touch pools. =Lorikeet Forest= The Lorikeet Forest walk-through aviary covers and houses five subspecies of rainbow lorikeet as well as the violet-necked lory. Guests may feed them small amounts of nectar for a fee. June Keyes Penguin Habitat This exhibit for the Magellanic penguin opened in May, 2012. An underwater crawl-in space allows guests to view the penguins from within the tank. Other attractions In spring 2010, the Aquarium opened a new Earth- Friendly Garden on its front lawn. The garden features California native and drought-resistant plants, as well as a very efficient irrigation system, to show part of the solution to Southern California's ongoing water shortage problems. Activities Activities of the Aquarium of the Pacific employees and volunteers extend far beyond exhibits. The diverse marine science and conservation ventures include: breeding and conservation programs for endangered marine animals and habitats; housing of unreleasable seals, sea lions, and sea otters from local care centers and marine parks; beach and habitat cleanups; a variety of green business practices; and continuing efforts to educate visitors on the importance the ocean, its threats, and conservation, including the hazards of marine pollution, over-harvesting, habitat destruction and global climate change. One example is a trashion festival with works by Marina DeBris educating about ocean pollution. The Aquarium of the Pacific is also home to many cultural events throughout the year, such as the Pacific Islander Festival in the summer, the Moompetam Festival in the fall, special treats for the animals at Christmas, the Festival of Human Abilities in January, and the African Heritage Festival in February. Architecture The Aquarium architecture is inspired by the towering, breaking waves of the Pacific and mirrors the fluid and dynamic temper of the ocean. Kajima International, developers of the world's most critically acclaimed and technologically advanced aquariums, was the developer of the Aquarium of the Pacific and architects included the Los Angeles office of Hellmuth, Obata & Kassanbaum and Esherick Homsey Dodge and Davis of San Francisco. Construction was a joint venture of Turner Construction Company and Kajima International. On June 20, 1998, construction was completed and the Aquarium opened to the public.

The west fork of the San Jacinto River feeds Lake Conroe and flows south through Montgomery County to meet with the east fork in northeast Harris County to form Lake Houston. The east fork begins in Walker County, north of the Sam Houston National Forest. Tributaries of both forks begin within just a few miles of Lake Livingston, a reservoir on the Trinity River. The east fork flows south through Cleveland in Liberty County, Montgomery County, and into the north end of Lake Houston. Continuing southward, the river merges with Buffalo Bayou before the mouth at Galveston Bay. The Battle of San Jacinto was fought near the rain-swollen Buffalo Bayou in what is now Harris County during the 1836 Texas Revolution. The decisive victory gave rise to the Republic of Texas. The site is now a state historic park. The park is the site of the San Jacinto Monument. In October 1994, flooding along the San Jacinto River led to the failure of eight petroleum products pipelines, and the undermining of a number of other pipelines. The escaping products were ignited, leading to smoke inhalation and/or burn injuries of 547 people. In 2008, the EPA added the San Jacinto River waste pits to the federal Superfund cleanup list.

Created by cartoonist Ron Leishman and artist/writer Richard Comely, the original Captain Canuck first appeared in Captain Canuck #1 (July 1975). The series was the first successful Canadian comic book since the collapse of the nation's comic book industry following World War II. Three characters have worn the maple leaf costume of Captain Canuck. The first Captain Canuck patrolled Canada in the then-future year of 1993, where \\"Canada had become the most powerful country in the world\\". He was the costumed agent of the \\"Canadian International Security Organization\\" (CISO). In 1995, Captain Canuck was honored with a Canadian postage stamp, along with Superman, Johnny Canuck, Fleur de Lys and Nelvana of the Northern Lights. — via ProQuest Like most independent comics, Captain Canuck's adventures have been published sporadically. Publication history First published in 1975, Captain Canuck's original adventures were published on and off until 1981. There were several iterations since. Captain Canuck Reborn, Captain Canuck UnHoly War (also called West Coast Canuck) and Captan Canuck Legacy. In 2012 Richard Comely entered into a partnership with Toronto businessman, Fadi Hakim to relaunch a new, updated and modern version of Captain Canuck, which was designed in part by Kalman Andrasofszky (Marvel Comics). An animated series was crowd funded and it aired between 2013 & 2014\\\\. A second series of the animated adventures was set to air between 2015 & 2016\\\\. The first episode of which premiere at Hal-Con during Halloween.  Tom Evans  Canuck's first appearance was in 1975, published by Comely Comix of Winnipeg, Manitoba. The story followed Tom Evans, a Canadian secret agent who gained superhuman strength from contact with extraterrestrials. This first version of the Canadian superhero ran for three issues before going on hiatus in 1976. In 1979, it came back, with Comely being backed by CKR Productions, and publishing 11 more issues, plus a summer special, concluding in early 1981; it was drawn mostly by George Freeman, taking over from Comely, who did the writing and lettering. He was pushed out of CKR after issue #12 was completed and issue #13 and #14 were outlined. The completed issue #15 (written and pencilled by George Freeman and inked, lettered and coloured by Claude St. Aubin) was finally published in 2004 as a limited edition by Comely.  Darren Oak  Since the original, two newer incarnations of the Canadian icon have appeared: Comely launched a second version in 1993, under the imprint Semple Comics. Set in the present, Captain Canuck: Reborn featured a new Captain Canuck, Darren Oak, who fought a global conspiracy. This title lasted only four issues (#0–3) and was written and drawn by Richard Comely, Leonard Kirk and Sandy Carruthers with inks by Éric Thériault. That incarnation continued as a newspaper comic strip for a short while.  David Semple  A third incarnation (sometimes called the \\"West Coast Captain Canuck\\"), edited by Comely but written and drawn by brothers Riel and Drue Langlois, appeared in 2004 under the banner of Comely Comics, entitled Captain Canuck: Unholy War. Yet another man, RCMP Constable David Semple, adopts the guise of Captain Canuck, to take on a biker gang called the Unholy Avengers. \\"Unholy War\\" was slated as a three-issue mini-series, the third and final installment being published in January 2005. However, the series came out with a fourth issue (under the 'Hot Hail Comics' banner) in August 2007, which fully concluded the character.  Captain Canuck: Legacy  A miniseries, written and illustrated by Comely, Captain Canuck: Legacy, began in the fall of 2006. It contained two continued stories: One detailed the efforts of the second Captain Canuck to prevent illegal weapons from reaching Canada, whilst the second chronicled the continued adventures of the third (West Coast) Captain Canuck. While the series has remained in limbo for some time, the official Captain Canuck website stated that the remainder of the series would be completed in 2009. Captain Canuck Legacy 1.5 was published in August 2011 as a limited edition of 5,000 copies only distributed in Ontario.  Captain Canuck Collections  IDW Publishing published two volumes of collected editions of the 1975-1980 Captain Canuck series. Its first release in June 2009 contained issues #4–10. Volume two, released December 2009, contained the 1980 Summer Special. In November 2011, IDW released Captain Canuck The Complete Edition as a 375-page trade paperback with issues #1–15, the Summer Special, the newspaper strips, sketches and Captain Canuck: Legacy #1.5.  Proposed film  The Canadian company Mind's Eye Entertainment announced at Comic-Con International 2011 that it planned to develop a Captain Canuck feature film. No scriptwriter or director were attached. Mind's Eye announced at Comic-Con 2012 that it had selected Vancouver-based screenwriter Arne Olsen to script the feature. Olsen was chosen from a solicitation of pre selected, accredited Canadian writers, who submitted treatments. The final two choices submitted copies of sample scripts.  Web series  In 2013 Captain Canuck was reimagined for a five-episode animated web series by Captain Canuck Inc and Smiley Guy Studios.http://www.captaincanuck.com/s/captain_canuck_press_release.pdf Kris Holden-Reid voices the Captain and Paul Amos his antagonist, Mr. Gold. Several other actors voiced roles in the series including Tatiana Maslany as Redcoat and Laura Vandervoort as Blue Fox. 2014–present  The success of the Web series allowed for a one-shot comic book, The 2014 Captain Canuck Summer Special, which was released on Canada Day, July 1, 2014, at comic shops across Canada. This is the first time since 1981 that the Summer Special was released. In 2015 a Captain Canuck #0 issue was released on Free Comic Book Day, which is the first Saturday of May each year. This issue preceded the new ongoing Captain Canuck series published by Chapterhouse Comics, the first issue of which was available in comic shops worldwide on May 27, 2015.

Retrieved on 6 December 2008. is a poem by Lord Byron first published in 1815 in his Hebrew Melodies (in which it was titled The Destruction of Semnacherib).Ashton (1972), p. 180 The poem is based on the biblical account of the historical Assyrian siege of Jerusalem in 701 BC by Assyrian king Sennacherib, as described in the Bible (2 Kings 18–19, Isaiah 36–37). . The rhythm of the poem has a feel of the beat of a galloping horse's hooves (an anapestic tetrameter) as the Assyrian rides into battle.Paul Fussell (1979), Poetic Meter and Poetic Form. Biblical story Jerusalem Delivered from Sennacherib, 1860 woodcut by Julius Schnorr von Karolsfeld The poem relates to the Biblical account of Sennacherib's attempted siege of Jerusalem. According to the Bible record in 2 Kings 18:13, the Assyrian army came \\"against all the fenced cities of Judah, and took them.\\" When the Assyrians were besieging Jerusalem, Hezekiah prayed to Jehovah in the Temple, and Isaiah sent the reply from Jehovah to Hezekiah: \\"I will defend this city, to save it, for mine own sake, and for my servant David's sake\\" (2 Kings 19:34), and during the following night the Angel of the Lord () \\"smote in the camp of the Assyrians an hundred fourscore and five thousand\\" (i.e. 185,000), so by morning most of the Assyrian army was found \\"as dead corpses” (2 Kings 19:35), and Sennacherib went back to Nineveh. The Assyrian annals do mention tribute paid by Hezekiah to Sennacherib (as recorded in 2 Kings 18), and the Assyrian Siege of Jerusalem (dated 701 BC), but omits any mention of its failure or the loss of the army. Reception The poem was popular in Victorian England and, when the first Australian cricket team to tour England defeated a strong MCC team, including W G Grace, at Lord's on 27 May 1878, the satirical magazine Punch celebrated by publishing a parody of the poem including a wry commentary on Grace's contribution: ::The Australians came down like a wolf on the fold, ::The Marylebone cracks for a trifle were bowled; ::Our Grace before dinner was very soon done, ::And Grace after dinner did not get a run.Altham, p.135. Mark Twain has references to this poem throughout his works, from his early newspaper sketches to The Adventures of Tom Sawyer, and it is mentioned often in biographies of him, making it clear that it was important to him.twainquotes.com. Retrieved on 6 December 2008. Ogden Nash's \\"Very Like a Whale\\", a humorous complaint about poetical metaphors, uses this poem for its inspiration: ::...Now then, this particular Assyrian, the one whose cohorts were gleaming in purple and gold, ::Just what does the poet mean when he says he came down like a wolf on the fold? ::In heaven and earth more than is dreamed of in our philosophy there are great many things. ::But I don't imagine that among them there is a wolf with purple and gold cohorts or purple and gold anythings. ::No, no, Lord Byron, before I'll believe that this Assyrian was actually like a wolf I must have some kind of proof; ::Did he run on all fours and did he have a hairy tail and a big red mouth and big white teeth and did he say Woof Woof?...

These are named after French mathematician Paul Montel, and give conditions under which a family of holomorphic functions is normal. Locally uniformly bounded families are normal The first, and simpler, version of the theorem states that a family of holomorphic functions defined on an open subset of the complex numbers is normal if and only if it is locally uniformly bounded. This theorem has the following formally stronger corollary. Suppose that \\\\mathcal{F} is a family of meromorphic functions on an open set D. If z_0\\\\in D is such that \\\\mathcal{F} is not normal at z_0, and U\\\\subset D is a neighborhood of z_0, then \\\\bigcup_{f\\\\in\\\\mathcal{F}}f(U) is dense in the complex plane. Functions omitting two values The stronger version of Montel's Theorem (occasionally referred to as the Fundamental Normality Test) states that a family of holomorphic functions, all of which omit the same two values a,b\\\\in\\\\mathbb{C}, is normal. Necessity The conditions in the above theorems are sufficient, but not necessary for normality. Indeed, the family {z\\\\mapsto z} is normal, but does not omit any complex value. Proofs The first version of Montel's theorem is a direct consequence of Marty's Theorem (which states that a family is normal if and only if the spherical derivatives are locally bounded) and Cauchy's integral formula. This theorem has also been called the Stieltjes–Osgood theorem, after Thomas Joannes Stieltjes and William Fogg Osgood. The Corollary stated above is deduced as follows. Suppose that all the functions in \\\\mathcal{F} omit the same neighborhood of the point z_1. By postcomposing with the map z\\\\mapsto \\\\frac{1}{z-z_1} we obtain a uniformly bounded family, which is normal by the first version of the theorem. The second version of Montel's theorem can be deduced from the first by using the fact that there exists a holomorphic universal covering from the unit disk to the twice punctured plane \\\\mathbb{C}\\\\setminus{a,b}. (Such a covering is given by the elliptic modular function). This version of Montel's theorem can be also derived from Picard's theorem, by using Zalcman's lemma. Relationship to theorems for entire functions A heuristic principle known as Bloch's Principle (made precise by Zalcman's lemma) states that properties that imply that an entire function is constant correspond to properties that ensure that a family of holomorphic functions is normal. For example, the first version of Montel's theorem stated above is the analog of Liouville's theorem, while the second version corresponds to Picard's theorem.

An agreement was announced in 2019 to sell the global business and assets of Verbatim to CMC Magnetics at an estimated price of $32 million USD. Originally an American company and well known for its floppy disks in the 1970s and 1980s, Verbatim is today one of the best-known brand names for recordable optical media. It was named the leading brand globally in the market in 2005, and are known for their patented azo dye, which is regarded as being high in quality. History The original Verbatim first started in Mountain View, California in 1969, under the name Information Terminals Corporation, founded by Reid Anderson. It grew and became a leading manufacturer of floppy disks by the end of the 1970s, and was soon renamed Verbatim. In 1982 it formed a floppy disk joint venture with Japanese company Mitsubishi Kasei Corporation (forerunner of Mitsubishi Chemical Corporation), with the joint venture called Kasei Verbatim. Verbatim mostly struggled in the decade and was purchased by Eastman Kodak in 1985, while its floppy partnership with Mitsubishi Kasei Corporation was still intact. It was eventually purchased fully by Mitsubishi Kasei Corporation in March 1990, after eight years in a joint venture. Many new products were launched under the new Japanese ownership, and the brand saw immense growth in the decade. Mitsubishi Kagaku Media was founded in October 1994 as a subsidiary through the merger of Mitsubishi Kasei and Mitsubishi Petrochemical, resulting in Mitsubishi Chemical. The new company absorbed the former American company and created a new Japanese entity, whilst the old Verbatim brand lived on. In addition, Mitubishi Kagaku Media sell products under the Freecom brand. Freecom was founded in Berlin, Germany in 1989 and had been based in the Netherlands when it was purchased by Mitsubishi Chemical Holdings in September 2009. The company was selling products under the Mitsubishi brand in Japan from 1994 to 2010, when Verbatim fully replaced it.

Lonely and decrepit, Grizabella seeks acceptance from the other Jellicle cats but is initially ostracised. She sings the most famous song from the musical, \\"Memory\\". The role was originated by Elaine Paige in the West End in 1981, and by Betty Buckley on Broadway in 1982. Buckley won the 1983 Tony Award for Best Featured Actress in a Musical for her portrayal. Jennifer Hudson portrayed Grizabella in the 2019 film adaptation. Character Grizabella is, at the time of her appearance, a very old and mangy cat, withered to the point that she no longer resembles the glamorous cat of her youth. Having left the Jellicle tribe a long time ago, she is now all alone and left with only the memories of her happier days. She returns to the tribe seeking re-acceptance, but her fellow Jellicles are initially repulsed by her and repeatedly shun her. Grizabella makes her entrance early on in the first act of the musical. She approaches the other cats, but they treat her like a pariah as Demeter and Bombalurina explain who she is (\\"Grizabella: The Glamour Cat\\"). She comes back at the end of the first act, watching from afar as the other cats dance at the Jellicle Ball. Grizabella attempts to replicate their dance moves but realises she is too weak; she sings a prelude to \\"Memory\\" as she contemplates her plight. Grizabella makes her final appearance towards the end of the musical. This time, she addresses the cats by singing the full version of \\"Memory\\" in which she pleads for their understanding and acceptance. She collapses in the middle of the song but is encouraged to press on by the kitten Jemima (also known as Sillabub). After the song, Victoria approaches Grizabella and touches her as a sign of acceptance. The other cats soon follow and welcome her back into the tribe. Grizabella is then led to the Jellicle leader Old Deuteronomy; her initial shock turns to happiness as she begins her ascendance to the Heaviside Layer (the Jellicle version of heaven). The role of Grizabella requires a wide vocal range and the ability to belt to E♭5. Origins and songs Although Cats is based on T. S. Eliot's Old Possum's Book of Practical Cats, Grizabella does not appear in the published source material. Instead, the character came from an unpublished poem by Eliot titled \\"Grizabella the Glamour Cat\\" that had been given to Lloyd Webber by Eliot's widow and literary executor, Valerie Eliot. Although the poem had been rejected from Old Possum's Book of Practical Cats for being \\"too sad for children\\", it became the basis for Grizabella's character-defining song in the musical (\\"Grizabella: The Glamour Cat\\"). The poem centres on a former glamour cat who has fallen on hard times and now roams the red-light district near Tottenham Court. Additionally, the introduction for \\"Grizabella: The Glamour Cat\\" is taken almost word-for-word from a verse in another Eliot poem titled \\"Rhapsody on a Windy Night\\", with Grizabella as the feline version of the fallen woman: The main song that Grizabella sings is \\"Memory\\", the best-known song from Cats and \\"by some estimations the most successful song ever from a musical.\\" It has been recorded around 600 times (as of 2006) by artists including Barbra Streisand, Barry Manilow, Johnny Mathis, Michael Crawford and Kikki Danielsson. Notable performers The role of Grizabella was originated by Elaine Paige in the West End in 1981. She later reprised the role for the 1998 film version. Betty Buckley originated the role in the 1982 Broadway production, earning the 1983 Tony Award for Best Featured Actress in a Musical for her performance. In 2015, pop singer Nicole Scherzinger was nominated for a Laurence Olivier Award for Best Supporting Actress for her performance as Grizabella in the West End revival.

He is the first person born in Puerto Rico to become a member of the U.S. Ski Team. He is also known for hosting three seasons of MTV's The Challenge, which was formerly known as Real World/Road Rules Challenge. He has also hosted four reunion specials for Battle of the Sexes, the sequel of Battle of the Seasons, Rivals II and Free Agents. Early years Moseley (birth name: Jonathan William Moseley) was born in San Juan, Puerto Rico. In 1978, he saw snow for the first time when his family went on a trip to California. Eventually, his family moved to Tiburon, California, a suburb north of San Francisco where he attended The Branson School in Ross, California. His family would go to the Sierra Nevada every weekend. This, and the fact that he was a better skier than his brothers, inspired the then nine- year-old Moseley to take skiing lessons. In 1992, he joined the Squaw Valley Freestyle Ski Team and soon won his first Junior National title in Freestyle Skiing; he graduated from high school in 1993 and that same year was selected for the U.S. Ski Team. United States Ski Team Moseley tried but did not qualify for the 1994 Winter Olympics held at Lillehammer, Norway and became determined to qualify for the 1998 Olympics. In 1995, he enrolled at UC Davis, but his education was interrupted by his intense training. In 1998, Moseley participated in and won the first two World Cup events of that year, leading to his participation in the 1998 Winter Olympics held in Nagano, Japan, where he won a gold medal. Later that year he secured the 1998 World Cup Mogul Skiing title with nine wins that season. He also won the U.S. National title. In 1999, Moseley challenged the International Skiing federation to change its policy to allow its athletes to participate in professional events, such as ESPN's X Games where he earned a silver medal in the Big Air event. Moseley was the first skier to medal in both the X-Games (silver) and the Olympics (Gold). In 2000, Moseley won the U.S. Freeskiing Open and in 2001 regained a spot in the U.S. Ski Team at the World Cup qualifications held at Sunday River, Maine. In 2002, Moseley competed but came in fourth place in the Olympic Games. In 2002, Moseley gave the commencement convocation address at UC Berkeley. The choice by the senior class committee was controversial at the time because Moseley had dropped out of college. Honors and recognitions Among the honors and recognitions which Moseley has received is a parade in his honor in which San Francisco Mayor Willie Brown declared a \\"Jonny Moseley Day\\" and handed him the \\"key\\" to the city. He was named \\"Sportsman of the Year\\" (1998) by the U.S. Olympic Committee and has been featured on the covers of Freeskier and Rolling Stone magazines. He was also chosen to be the traditional post-Olympics athlete host of Saturday Night Live in 2002, hosting the March 2, 2002, episode of the show with musical guest Outkast. On the show, he performed a sketch called \\"Jonny's Journey,\\" in which he went \\"around the world on a never-ending Dinner Roll\\" via a green screen. Moseley is largely credited with having brought the Iron Cross trick into the limelight, where the athlete crosses their skis midair during a jump. This trick was a radical departure from the old school air tricks, which include Daffies, Backscratchers and Moonwalks (see Glen Plake). Private life Moseley married Malia Rich, a business manager, on March 25, 2006, in Telluride, Colorado. Moseley met Rich in high school; the couple started dating in 2001 and got engaged on April 20, 2003. On September 4, 2007, Rich gave birth to the couple's first child, named Jonathan \\"Jack\\" William Moseley Jr. in San Francisco, California. Later years Moseley launched a web site that sells products with his logo on them and has appeared on advertisements for McDonald's and Sprint. He graduated from the University of California, Berkeley on May 17, 2007 with a B.A. in American Studies focusing on Consumer and Popular Culture. In December 2001, 3DO released Jonny Moseley Mad Trix a level-based extreme skiing game named after the skier. Moseley, who currently lives in California, was the host of three seasons of the MTV reality show Real World/Road Rules Challenge (now currently called as The Challenge). He is part of the celebrity panel of judges (along with Steve Garvey and Oksana Baiul) on the ABC show \\"Master of Champions\\". After the 2002 Olympics Moseley hosted Saturday Night Live. Moseley developed an aerial ski move called \\"The Dinner Roll\\" and spoke about it during a 2002 speech at UC Berkeley: In 2007, Warren Miller's Playground was released with Moseley as the narrator. He was also in the movie as he has been in a few Warren Miller ski movies in the past. Moseley has narrated every film since. He has gone on to narrate a number of other Warren Miller movies. Moseley also used to host a weekly radio program on Sirius/XM's channel 41. The show was called \\"The Moseley Method\\". Moseley was the color analyst for NBC at the 2010 Olympics in Vancouver for the moguls, aerials and ski cross events. In 2010 he was cast on the ABC show Skating with the Stars where he was paired with retired Pairs skater Brooke Castile. Mosley finished in third place as second runner-up. He is currently the host of the latest viral marketing campaign by Ford Motor Company, Focus Rally America. In 2011 Moseley became a co-host of \\"American Ninja Warrior\\" on G4. In 2012 the show moved to NBC and he continued his hosting role. In 2013, Moseley appeared on Undercover Boss, playing the host of the fictitious reality show which Squaw Valley/Alpine Meadows CEO Andy Wirth is supposedly a contestant on.

It involves buying equities that are expected to increase in value and selling short equities that are expected to decrease in value. This is different from the risk reversal strategies where investors will simultaneously buy a call option and sell a put option to simulate being long in a stock. Overview Typically, equity long/short investing is based on \\"bottom up\\" fundamental analysis of the individual companies, in which investments are made. There may also be \\"top down\\" analysis of the risks and opportunities offered by industries, sectors, countries, and the macroeconomic situation. Long/short covers a wide variety of strategies. There are generalists, and managers who focus on certain industries and sectors or certain regions. Managers may specialize in a category — for example, large cap or small cap, value or growth. There are many trading styles, with frequent or dynamic traders and some longer-term investors. A fund manager typically attempts to reduce volatility by either diversifying or hedging positions across individual regions, industries, sectors and market capitalization bands and hedging against un-diversifiable risk such as market risk. In addition to being required of the portfolio as a whole, neutrality may in addition be required for individual regions, industries, sectors, and market capitalization bands. There is wide variation in the degree to which managers prioritize seeking high returns, which may involve concentrated and leveraged portfolios, and seeking low volatility, which involves more diversification and hedging. Equitized strategy This is in addition to market neutral strategy, as it adds a permanent stock index futures overlay, which makes profit or losses, depending on the movement of the market. Your portfolio then has a full equity market exposure. Hedging example A hedge fund might sell short one automobile industry stock, while buying another—for example, short $1 million of DaimlerChrysler, long $1 million of Ford. With this position, any event that causes all auto industry stocks to fall will cause a profit on the DaimlerChrysler position and a matching loss on the Ford position. Similarly, events that cause both stocks to rise—for example a rise in the market as a whole—will have little or no effect on the position. Presumably the hedge fund has sold DaimlerChrysler and bought Ford because the manager expects Ford to perform better. If the manager is correct, the fund should profit irrespective of market and sector moves. Market neutral strategies Market neutral strategies can be seen as the limiting case of equity long/short, in which the long and short portfolios of the fund are balanced with great care so that a very high degree of hedging is achieved. Some advantages of market neutral strategies include being able to generate positive returns in a down market, and generating returns with a lower volatility profile. \\"Market neutrality\\" refers to hedging out market risk, which can be managed through the use of derivatives, such as futures on market indexes. Market neutral funds usually seek to hedge against most or all predictable risk exposures. An extension on the market neutral strategy is the factor neutral strategy. The factor neutral strategy is neutral on market risk, as well as major factors like momentum and large cap vs small cap. This is a step towards more modern capital market models like the Fama–French three-factor model. Problems There are many difficulties with managing long/short funds. These include the difficulties of estimating and hedging the risks to which a portfolio is exposed, and the requirement to manage unsuccessful short positions in an active manner. Short positions that are losing money grow to become an increasingly large part of the portfolio, and their price can increase without limit. To make money, the hedge fund must successfully predict which stocks will perform better. It requires making intelligent use of the available information, but this is not enough—it also requires making better use of the available information than large numbers of capable investors. This strategy is primarily implemented by hedge funds and sophisticated institutions.

Two of his songs, \\"Driving Wheel\\" and \\"More Often Than Not\\", have become cover standards. Early life Wiffen was born in Redhill, Surrey, England, in 1942. \\"David Wiffen – Coast to Coast Fever (1973): Forgotten Series\\". Something Else Reviews, 13 January 2016 by Kasper Nijsen He spent his early childhood with his mother, living on an aunt's farm in Chipstead, while his father, an engineer, contributed to the war effort. Following the war, Wiffen's family relocated to London and, in 1954, to Claygate, Surrey, where Wiffen attended Hinchley Wood School. Wiffen came to Canada at the age of sixteen.  Career  Wiffen first sang with the Kingston upon Thames-based Black Cat Skiffle group. Wiffen moved with his family to Canada at age 16, and became part of the burgeoning folk music scene, initially in Toronto. In 1964, Wiffen hitchhiked to Edmonton and later managed The Depression folk club in Calgary.Peter Warren, Like...Don't Ring. Calgary Herald, October 1963. Profile of The Depression folk club. As reproduced in www.jonimitchell.com/Library. Retrieved 19 July 2014. In 1965, having moved to Vancouver, Wiffen was invited to perform at The Bunkhouse club on a live ensemble album. It became Wiffen's first solo album, David Wiffen at the Bunkhouse Coffeehouse, Vancouver BC, on the Universal International label, when the other invited musicians failed to show up. Wiffen was subsequently in several bands, including The Pacers, based in Prince George, British Columbia, where he was the lead vocalist, and The Children, based in Ottawa. Members of The Children included William Hawkins, Bruce Cockburn, Sneezy Waters and Richard Patterson. He subsequently joined 3's a Crowd, whose initial members included Brent Titcomb, Donna Warner, Trevor Veitch and Richard Patterson.\\"David Wiffen Releases ‘Songs From the Lost & Found’\\".

Page 30 The album also contained his most widely covered song, \\"Driving Wheel\\". By this time a number of his songs had been recorded by other musicians, including Harry Belafonte, Anne Murray and Tom Rush. Wiffen's second solo studio album, Coast to Coast Fever (United Artists, 1973), was produced by Bruce Cockburn, and Wiffen's musical career appeared to be quite promising. He continued to perform regularly in the 1970s,Including being an inaugural performer at the Vancouver Folk Music Festival in 1978; see 1978 Artist Profile; www.thefestival.bc.ca. though found his success diminishing and a consequent source of frustration and depression,\\"David Wiffen: Finding his Driving Wheel\\". compared to the success of contemporaries Bruce Cockburn and Murray McLauchlan. Alcohol abuse compounded the difficulties he was experiencing in his musical career. He eventually ceased performing, choosing to become a limousine driver and later a publicly funded driver for handicapped persons in Ottawa. Wiffen suffered a serious back injury on the job while moving a wheelchair, which required corrective surgery and impeded any return to performing. Wiffen's third album, South of Somewhere, was released in 1999, twenty-six years after Coast to Coast Fever. At that time, Wiffen had been sober for ten years and had spent six years in preparation and development for the album's production. The album contained a mix of reworkings of some of his older material, such as \\"Driving Wheel\\", plus some new songs. During this period, he returned briefly to performing, principally as a weekly performer and performance host at Irene's Pub in Ottawa, Ontario, but then stopped performing publicly. (As of 2008 and through much of 2009, Wiffen was on EMI's list of \\"missing royaltors\\").General Notice to Royaltors ; retrieved 24 November 2009.

It has been translated into English by John Nathan and published in the volume Teach Us to Outgrow Our Madness, along with the title story, Prize Stock and The Day He Himself Shall Wipe My Tears Away. Aghwee was one of the first in Ōe's series of stories inspired by the birth of his autistic son Hikari. Plot Aghwee opens with the anonymous narrator, a 28-year-old man, talking about the near-blindness in one of his eyes, the result of an attack by a group of children that year. Because of his blurred vision he sees \\"two worlds superimposed\\".Aghwee in Teach Us to Outgrow Our Madness p. 223. The attack had prompted him to remember the events of the story, which took place ten years earlier, and the memory freed him from hatred of his assailants. The narrator had worked as a companion to a composer, D, then aged 28, who had (apparently) gone mad after the death of his infant son. D says that when he goes outside, he is visited by the spirit of his son, who swoops down out of the sky: \\"a fat baby in a white cotton nightgown, big as a kangaroo\\".Aghwee p. 238. D talks to Aghwee but refuses to interact with the people around him, saying that he is no longer living in the present time. The narrator is told by D's estranged wife that D had killed their son, starving him because he was born with a brain hernia (which later turned out to be a benign tumour). 'Aghwee' was the only word the child had spoken. The wife accuses D of fleeing reality. She gives the narrator a key which turns out to unlock a box of D's compositions, which D burns and buries. D takes the narrator to various places where D had previously enjoyed himself, as well as sending him to inform D's former girlfriend that he will no longer see her. Matters reach a crisis when a pack of dogs (of which Aghwee is said to be afraid) comes across D and the narrator while D is talking to Aghwee. However it is the narrator who panics until he feels a hand on his shoulder, \\"gentle as the essence of all gentleness\\"Aghwee p. 253. which he says he knows to be the D's but imagines to be Aghwee's. D then tells the narrator more about his experience of the world, saying that the sky contains all those whom a person has lost; he stopped living in the present to prevent the number of figures floating in his sky from increasing. The story reaches an end with the death of D on Christmas Eve. D begins talking to Aghwee while he and the narrator are out in the city. While waiting to cross a road, \\"D cried out and thrust both arms in front of him as if he were trying to rescue something\\".Aghwee p. 257. D is injured and is taken to hospital. As he lies dying, the narrator asks him if he had simply made up Aghwee as a cover for his suicide, and says that he himself was about to believe in the spirit. In answer D merely smiles; whether mocking or \\"friendly mischief\\" the narrator cannot tell. In a coda, the narrator returns to the recent incident when he was attacked by a group of children, who unaccountably became frightened and started to throw stones at him. He sensed \\"a being I knew and missed\\" — Aghwee — leaving him and returning to the sky. He no longer hated the children, and started to think of the figures who had filled his own sky over the intervening decade, associating the \\"gratuitous sacrifice\\" of his eye with perception of those figures. Reception This story has been lauded by comparative literary critics, being compared even to famous Japanese short story author Akutagawa Ryunosuke.

L. No. 66-261, 41 Stat. 988 (1920). Among other purposes, the law regulates maritime commerce in U.S. waters and between U.S. ports. Section 27 of the Merchant Marine Act is known as the Jones Act and deals with cabotage (coastwise trade) and requires that all goods transported by water between U.S. ports be carried on U.S.-flag ships, constructed in the United States, owned by U.S. citizens, and crewed by U.S. citizens and U.S. permanent residents.46\\\\. U.S.C. § 50101 et seq. (2006).Lin, Tom C.W., Americans, Almost and Forgotten, 107 California Law Review (2019) The act was introduced by Senator Wesley Jones. The law also defines certain seaman's rights. Laws similar to the Jones Act date to the early days of the nation. In the First Congress, on September 1, 1789, Congress enacted Chapter XI, \\"An Act for Registering and Clearing Vessels, Regulating the Coasting Trade, and for other purposes\\", which limited domestic trades to American ships meeting certain requirements.First Cong., sess. 1, ch. 11, §1 (1789). Such laws served the same purpose as – and were loosely based on – England's Navigation Acts, which were finally repealed in 1849. The Merchant Marine Act of 1920 has been revised a number of times; the most recent revision in 2006 included recodification in the U.S. Code. Some economists and other experts have argued for its repeal, while military and Department of Commerce officials have spoken in favor of the law. Research shows that the Jones Act reduces domestic trade via waterways (relative to other forms of trade) and increases consumer prices. The Jones Act is not to be confused with the Death on the High Seas Act, another United States maritime law that does not apply to coastal and in- land navigable waters. Objectives and purpose The intention of Congress was to ensure a vibrant United States maritime industry and for national defense as stated in the preamble to the Merchant Marine Act of 1920. Cabotage Cabotage is the transport of goods or passengers between two points in the same country, alongside coastal waters, by a vessel or an aircraft registered in another country. Originally a shipping term, cabotage now also covers aviation, railways, and road transport. Cabotage is \\"trade or navigation in coastal waters, or the exclusive right of a country to operate the air traffic within its territory\\".\\"Cabotage,\\" definition, the Free Dictionary, available at http://www.thefreedictionary.com/Cabotage+trade. In the context of \\"cabotage rights\\", cabotage refers to the right of a company from one country to trade in another country. In aviation terms, for example, it is the right to operate within the domestic borders of another country. Most countries enact cabotage laws for reasons of economic protectionism or national security; 80% of the UN’s member states with coastlines have cabotage law.((sources needed)) The cabotage provisions relating to the Jones Act restrict the carriage of goods or passengers between United States ports to U.S.-built and flagged vessels. It has been codified as portions of 46 U.S.C. 46 U.S.C. §55102 et seq. Generally, the Jones Act prohibits any foreign-built, foreign-owned or foreign-flagged vessel from engaging in coastwise trade within the United States. A number of other statutes affect coastwise trade and should be consulted along with the Jones Act. These include the Passenger Vessel Services Act, , which restricts coastwise transportation of passengers, and , which restricts the use of foreign vessels to commercially catch or transport fish in U.S. waters.ch.551 Coastwise Trade Cornell Law School These provisions also require at least three-fourths (75 percent) of the crew members to be U.S. citizens or permanent residents. Moreover, the steel of foreign repair work on the hull and superstructure of a U.S.-flagged vessel is limited to ten percent by weight.\\"Cabotage laws put Jones Act in frame: Push to tighten legislation may spark WTO review,\\" Lloyd's List International. September 13, 2006. Lloyd's List This restriction largely prevents Jones Act ship-owners from refurbishing their ships at overseas shipyards. The Merchant Marine Act of 1936 is a United States federal law. Its purpose is \\"to further the development and maintenance of an adequate and well-balanced American merchant marine, to promote the commerce of the United States, to aid in the national defense, to repeal certain former legislation, and for other purposes.\\" Specifically, it established the United States Maritime Commission, and required a United States Merchant Marine that: can carry all domestic water-borne commerce, can carry a substantial portion of foreign commerce, can serve as a naval auxiliary in time of war or national emergency, is owned and operated under the U.S. flag by U.S. citizens \\"insofar as may be practicable,\\" is composed of the best-equipped, safest, and most suitable types of vessels, consists of vessels constructed in the United States, and consists of vessels manned with a trained and efficient citizen personnel. The Act restricted the number of aliens allowed to work on passenger ships, requiring that, by 1938, 90 percent of the crew members were U.S. citizens. Although about 4,000 Filipinos worked as merchant mariners on U.S. ships, most of these seamen were discharged in 1937 as a result of the law.[1] The Act also established federal subsidies for the construction and operation of merchant ships. Two years after the Act was passed, the U.S. Merchant Marine Cadet Corps, the forerunner to the United States Merchant Marine Academy, was established. U.S. Representative Schyler O. Bland of Virginia was known as the \\"father of the Merchant Marine Act of 1936.\\" Seamen's rights The U.S. Congress adopted the Merchant Marine Act in early June 1920, formerly and codified on October 6, 2006 as . The act formalized the rights of seamen. The Jones Act formalized the rights of seaman that have been recognized for centuries. The Jones Act allows injured sailors to make claims and obtain damages from their employers for the negligence of the ship owner, including many acts of the captain or fellow members of the crew. It operates simply by extending similar legislation already in place that allowed for recoveries by railroad workers and providing that this legislation also applies to sailors. Its operative provision is found at , which provides: The law allows U.S. seamen to bring actions against ship owners based on claims of unseaworthiness or negligence, rights not afforded by common international maritime law. The United States Supreme Court, in the case of Chandris, Inc., v. Latsis, 515 U.S. 347, 115 S.Ct. 2172 (1995), has set a benchmark for determining the status of any employee as a \\"Jones Act\\" seaman. Workers who spend less than 30 percent of their time in the service of a vessel on navigable waters are presumed not to be seaman under the Jones Act. The Court ruled that any worker who spends more than 30 percent of his time in the service of a vessel on navigable waters qualifies as a seaman under the act. Only maritime workers who qualify as a seaman can file a suit for damages under the Jones Act. An action under the Jones Act may be brought either in a U.S. federal court or in a state court. The right to bring an action in state court is preserved by the \\"savings to suitors\\" clause, 28 U.S.C. § 1333. The seaman-plaintiff is entitled to a jury trial, a right which is not afforded in maritime law absent a statute authorizing it. Seamen have three years from the time the accident occurred to file a lawsuit. Under the Jones Act, maritime law has a statute of limitations, of three years, meaning that seamen have three years from the time the injury occurred to file a lawsuit. If an injured seaman does not file a case within that three year period, the seaman's claim may be dismissed as time-barred. Effects The Jones Act prevents foreign-flagged ships from carrying cargo between the contiguous U.S. and certain noncontiguous parts of the U.S., such as Puerto Rico, Hawaii, Alaska, and Guam. Foreign ships inbound with goods cannot stop at any of these four locations, offload goods, load contiguous-bound goods, and continue to U.S. contiguous ports, although ships can offload cargo and proceed to the contiguous U.S. without picking up any additional cargo intended for delivery to another U.S. location.  Economic Effects  According to a private study from PriceWaterhouseCoopers, the law is responsible for 650,000 jobs, with Louisiana, Florida, and Texas as the top three states for Jones Act employment. This same study found that the Jones Act contributes $154 billion annually to the nations economy. Puerto Rico In June 2012, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York indicated that the Jones Act may hinder economic development in Puerto Rico, although the magnitude of the effect is unclear after a Government Accountability Office report debunked that study. In March 2013, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) released a study of the effect of the Jones Act on Puerto Rico that noted \\"[f]reight rates are set based on a host of supply and demand factors in the market, some of which are affected directly or indirectly by Jones Act requirements.\\" The report further concludes, however, that \\"because so many other factors besides the Jones Act affect rates, it is difficult to isolate the exact extent to which freight rates between the United States and Puerto Rico are affected by the Jones Act.\\" The report also addresses what would happen \\"under a full exemption from the Act, the rules and requirements that would apply to all carriers would need to be determined.\\" The report continues that \\"[w]hile proponents of this change expect increased competition and greater availability of vessels to suit shippers' needs, it is also possible that the reliability and other beneficial aspects of the current service could be affected.\\" The report concludes that \\"GAO's report confirmed that previous estimates of the so-called 'cost' of the Jones Act are not verifiable and cannot be proven.\\"http://www.gao.gov/assets/660/653046.pdf U.S. shipbuilding Because the Jones Act requires all transport between U.S. ports be carried on U.S.-built ships, proponents of the Jones Act claim that it supports the domestic U.S. shipbuilding industry. Critics of the act describe it as protectionist, harming the overall economy for the sake of benefiting narrow interests. A 2014 report by The Heritage Foundation argues that the Jones Act is an ineffective way to promote U.S. shipbuilding, claiming it drives up shipping costs, increases energy costs, stifles competition, and hampers innovation in the U.S. shipping industry. A 2019 Congressional Research Service report stated that U.S. shipbuilding has declined in competitiveness since the law's passage. The defense think tank CSBA came to the opposite conclusion in a 2020 study on the maritime industry, warning that without the Jones Act, the shipbuilding industry would face dire impacts, up to and including the inability of the government to purchase any auxiliary ships domestically.  National security  One of the primary impetuses for the law was the situation that occurred during World War I when the belligerent countries withdrew their merchant fleets from commercial service to aid in the war effort. This left the US with insufficient vessels to conduct normal trade impacting the economy. Later when the U.S. joined the war there were insufficient vessels to transport war supplies, materials, and ultimately soldiers to Europe resulting in the creation of the United States Shipping Board. The U.S. engaged in a massive ship building effort including building concrete ships to make up for the lack of U.S. tonnage. The Jones Act was passed in order to prevent the U.S. from having insufficient maritime capacity in future wars.  Mariners  It has been effective as the Jones Act fleet is the largest single source or merchant mariners for surge sealift operations: 3,830 mariners make up 29% of what MARAD needs to operate surge sealift during wartime. American crews frequently sail into war zones. Foreign crews contracted by the U.S. government during Operation Desert Storm refused to sail into a war zone. A 2011 study by the Government Accountability Office (GAO) found there are approximately 5 million maritime crew entries into the United States each year, and \\"the overwhelming majority of seafarers entering U.S. ports are aliens.\\" The study also showed that 80% of those seafarer aliens are working on passenger ships that are covered by the Passenger Vessel Services Act of 1886 rather than the Jones Act. The GAO said that while there are no known examples of foreign seafarer involvement in terrorist attacks and no definitive evidence of extremists infiltrating the United States on seafarer visas, \\"the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) considers the illegal entry of an alien through a U.S. seaport by exploitation of maritime industry practices to be a key concern.  Shipbuilding  Shipyards that build Jones Act vessels are needed to build smaller but important government vessels like auxiliary ships, cutters, and research vessels. Jones Act requirements creates additional work for these shipyards in between government orders. Defense think tank CSBA found that “[w]ithout the Jones Act’s requirements … it is likely the U.S. government would have few, if any, shipyards available to episodically recapitalize its smaller vessels.” By keeping the industrial base working, the Jones Act ensures that the Navy and Marine Corps can spin up shipbuilding without relying on other nations.  Homeland Security  The Jones Act includes dredging and salvage operations. Because the Jones Act creates a domestic dredging and salvage industry in the United States, it prevents the United States from depending on foreign companies to dredge naval facilities, which could create opportunities for sabotage or the depositing of underwater surveillance equipment. Additionally, the requirement that ships in the domestic fleet be manned by crews of U.S. citizens or permanent residents reduces the likelihood foreign ships and mariners will illegally gain access to America’s inland waterways and associated infrastructure. A 2011 study by the Government Accountability Office (GAO) found there are approximately 5 million maritime crew entries into the United States each year, and \\"the overwhelming majority of seafarers entering U.S. ports are aliens.\\" The study also showed that 80% of those seafarer aliens are working on passenger ships that are covered by the Passenger Vessel Services Act of 1886 rather than the Jones Act. The GAO said that while there are no known examples of foreign seafarer involvement in terrorist attacks and no definitive evidence of extremists infiltrating the United States on seafarer visas, \\"the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) considers the illegal entry of an alien through a U.S. seaport by exploitation of maritime industry practices to be a key concern.\\"  Economic Security  The Jones Act’s requirements also apply to shipping between the contiguous United States and overseas territories and states. The Jones Act reduces the ability of adversaries to interfere with commercial links to the Continental United States.  Importation of liquefied natural gas  Because of the lack of Jones Act-compliant liquefied natural gas tankers, the Northeast of the U.S. imported liquefied natural gas from Russia in order to avoid shortages in 2018. Support Supporters of the Jones Act maintain that the legislation is of strategic economic and wartime interest to the United States. The act, they say, protects the nation's sealift capability and its ability to produce commercial ships. In addition, the act is seen as a vital factor in helping maintain a viable workforce of trained merchant mariners for commerce and national emergencies. Supporters also argue that allowing foreign-flagged ships to engage in commerce in domestic American sea lanes would undermine U.S. wage, tax, safety, and environmental standards. According to the Lexington Institute, the Jones Act is also vital to national security and plays a role in safeguarding America's borders. The Lexington Institute stated in a June 2016 study that the Jones Act plays a role in strengthening U.S. border security and helping to prevent international terrorism. Criticism=Protectionism Critics claim the Jones Act is protectionist, and point to a 2002 report by the United States International Trade Commission that estimated the savings for the U.S. economy that would result from the repeal or amendment of the Jones Act. Critics contend that the Act results in higher costs for moving cargo between U.S. ports, particularly for Americans living in Hawaii, Alaska, Guam, and Puerto Rico. A 2019 study by the OECD estimated that the economic gains to the U.S. economy from the repeal of Jones Act would range from an added $19 billion up to $64 billion. Efforts at repeal Legislative efforts to repeal the Jones Act have been repeatedly introduced in Congress since 2010 in the form of the Open America's Waters Act, championed by the late Senator John McCain and by Utah Senator Mike Lee, but have not passed to become law. Waivers Requests for waivers of the Act and its provisions are reviewed by the Department of Homeland Security on a case-by-case basis, and can only be granted based on interest of national defense. Historically, waivers have only been granted in cases of national emergencies or upon the request of the Secretary of Defense. In the wake of Hurricane Katrina, Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff temporarily waived the coastwise laws for foreign vessels carrying oil and natural gas from September 1 to 19, 2005.Waiver of Compliance with Navigation and Inspection Laws U.S. Department of Homeland Security, September 1, 2005 In order to conduct an emergency shipment of gasoline from Dutch Harbor, Alaska, to Nome in January 2012, Secretary of Homeland Security Janet Napolitano granted a waiver to the Russian ice class marine tanker Renda.Homeland Security grants waiver of Jones Act for Nome fuel delivery from Alaska Business Monthly The Secretary of Homeland Security issued a temporary conditional waiver of the Jones Act for the shipment of petroleum products, blending stocks and additives from Gulf Coast Petroleum Administration for Defense District (PADD 3) to the New England and Central Atlantic Petroleum Administration for Defense Districts (PADDs 1 a and 1 b, respectively) for 12 days from November 2 to 13, 2012, following widespread fuel shortages caused by Hurricane Sandy.See Waiver of Compliance with Navigation Law , Dept. of Homeland Security (Nov. 2, 2012) On September 8, 2017, the Jones Act was simultaneously suspended for both Hurricane Harvey, which hit Texas fourteen days prior, and Hurricane Irma, which hit Florida on that day. In the same month, the Act was waived, after two days of debate, for Puerto Rico in the aftermath of Hurricane Maria. Requests for waivers of certain provisions of the act are reviewed by the United States Maritime Administration (MARAD) on a case by case basis. Waivers have been granted for example, in cases of national emergencies or in cases of strategic interest. For example, in June, 2006, declining oil production prompted MARAD to grant a waiver to operators of the 512-foot Chinese vessel Tai An Kou to tow an oil rig from the Gulf of Mexico to Alaska. The jackup rig will be under a two-year contract to drill in the Alaska's Cook Inlet Basin. The waiver to the Chinese vessel is said to be the first of its kind granted to an independent oil-and-gas company.\\"Coast wise: the U.S. marine industry is keeping a close watch on Jones Act assaults,\\" Workboat. January 1, 2007 Pressure exerted by 21 agriculture groups, including the American Farm Bureau Federation, failed to secure a Jones Act waiver following Hurricane Katrina in the Gulf of Mexico.

The act superseded the Foraker Act and granted U.S. citizenship to anyone born in Puerto Rico on or after April 11, 1899. It also created the Senate of Puerto Rico, established a bill of rights, and authorized the election of a Resident Commissioner (previously appointed by the President) to a four-year term. The act also exempted Puerto Rican bonds from federal, state, and local taxes regardless of where the bondholder resides. Impetus The impetus for this legislation came from a complex of local and mainland interests. Puerto Ricans lacked internationally recognized citizenship, but the local council was wary of \\"imposing citizenship.\\" Luis Muñoz Rivera, the Resident Commissioner in Washington, argued against US citizenship, giving several speeches in the House of Representatives.Munoz Rivera, Luis (17 July 1859-15 Nov. 1916) On 5 May 1916 he demanded: Rep. William Atkinson Jones, (D-Virginia), chairman of the House Committee on Insular Affairs, and Sen. John Shafroth, (D-Colorado), chairman of the Committee on Pacific Islands and Puerto Rico, sponsored the legislation which bears their names. Major features This Act made all citizens of Puerto Rico U.S. citizens[The Louisiana Purchase and American Expansion: 1803-1898. By Sanford Levinson and Bartholomew H. Sparrow. New York: Rowman and Littlefield Publishers. 2005. Page 166, 178.]\\" U.S. citizenship was extended to residents of Puerto Rico by virtue of the Jones Act, chap. 190, 39 Stat. 951 (1971) (codified at 48 U.S.C. § 731 (1987)\\") and reformed the system of government in Puerto Rico. In some respects, the governmental structure paralleled that of a state of the United States. Powers were separated among executive , judicial, and legislatives. The law also recognized certain civil rights through a bill of rights to be observed by the government of Puerto Rico (although trial by jury was not among them). Citizenship According to Public Law 414 of June 27, 1952 SEC.302: §1402. Persons born in Puerto Rico on or after April 11, 1899 All persons born in Puerto Rico on or after April 11, 1899, and prior to January 13, 1941, subject to the jurisdiction of the United States, residing on January 13, 1941, in Puerto Rico or another territory over which the United States exercises rights of sovereignty and not citizens of the United States under any other Act, are declared to be citizens of the United States as of January 13, 1941. All persons born in Puerto Rico on or after January 13, 1941, and subject to the jurisdiction of the United States, are citizens of the United States at birth. (June 27, 1952, ch. 477, title III, ch. 1, §302, 66 Stat. 236 .) The Act abolished racial restrictions found in United States immigration and naturalization statutes going back to the Naturalization Act of 1790. The 1952 Act retained a quota system for nationalities and regions. Eventually, the Act established a preference system that determined which ethnic groups were desirable immigrants and placed great importance on labor qualifications. The Act defined three types of immigrants: immigrants with special skills or who had relatives of U.S. citizens, who were exempt from quotas and who were to be admitted without restrictions; average immigrants whose numbers were not supposed to exceed 270,000 per year; and refugees. It expanded the definition of the \\"United States\\" for nationality purposes, which already included Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands, to add Guam. Persons born in these territories on or after December 24, 1952, acquire U.S. citizenship at birth on the same terms as persons born in other parts of the United States.[13] Residents of the island were granted United States citizenship and allowed to reject it voluntarily within six months of the act being established. Of the almost 1.2 million residents on the island, only 288 rejected it. Legislators  The Act created a legislative system comprising two houses: a Senate consisting of 19 members and a House of Representatives with 39 members. Under the Spanish colonial government, Puerto Rico had a unicameral legislature, the House of Delegates of Puerto Rico. The legislature was to be elected by manhood suffrage (limited at the time to white males) for a term of four years. Acts of the Legislature could be vetoed by the governor, but his veto could be overridden by a two-thirds vote, in which case the President of the United States would make the final decision. Matters relating to franchises and concessions were vested in a Public Service Commission, consisting of the heads of the executive departments, the auditor, and two elected commissioners. A Resident Commissioner to the United States was elected by popular vote for a four-year term; the Resident Commissioner's duties included representing Puerto Rico in the U.S. House of Representatives, with a voice but without a vote, as well as before the executive departments in Washington. Executive branch Under the Act, six executive departments were constituted: Justice, Finance, Interior, Education, Agriculture, Labor, and Health. The governor, the attorney-general, and the commissioner of education were appointed by the President with the approval of the U.S. Senate; the heads of the remaining departments were appointed by the governor of Puerto Rico, subject to the approval of the Puerto Rican Senate. The Governor of Puerto Rico was to be appointed by the President of the United States, not elected. All cabinet officials had to be approved by the United States Senate, and the United States Congress had the power to veto any law passed by the Puerto Rican Legislature. Washington maintained control over fiscal and economic matters and exercised authority over mail services, immigration, defense, and other basic governmental matters. Puerto Rico was not given electoral votes in the election of U.S. President, because the Constitution of the United States of America allows only full-fledged states to have electoral votes. Triple tax exemption Section 3 of the act also exempted Puerto Rican bonds from federal, state, and local taxes regardless of where the bondholder resides. This has made Puerto Rican bonds extremely attractive to municipal investors as they may inure from holding a bond issued by a state or municipality different from the one where they reside. This is because municipal bonds that enjoy triple tax exemption are typically granted such exemption solely for bondholders that reside in the state that issues them.http://www.municipalbonds.com/tax-education/tax-exemption-from-state- income-taxes. \\"As a general rule in most states, if the bonds are issued in a particular state, they are exempt from that state's income taxes.\\"http://www.barrons.com/articles/SB50001424052748704836204578354303522222668 \\"Muni income generally escapes federal taxes, along with state taxes for those who buy bonds in their home states.\\" Effects= Conscription  Before the Jones–Shafroth Act, insular Puerto Ricans were not citizens of the United States. Subsequent to the Act, they immediately became U.S. citizens. The act also extended almost all U.S. laws to have the same force and effect in Puerto Rico as in the United States (the only laws excepted were those concerning internal revenues) including the National Defense Act of 1916 which established the composition of the U.S. military. Two months after Congress passed the Jones–Shafroth Act, that same Congress enacted the Selective Service Act of 1917 which based conscription \\"upon liability to military service of all male citizens.\\" Through its passage, the Jones–Shafroth Act—via a combination of citizenship and the expansion of U.S. laws to Puerto Rico, including the aforementioned National Defense Act—imposed mandatory conscription into the U.S. military on Puerto Ricans, precisely at the moment that the United States entered World War I. As a result, more than 18,000 Puerto Ricans served in the U.S. armed forces during World War I. Subsequent legislation Portions of the Jones Act were superseded in 1948, after which the Governor was popularly elected. In 1948, U.S. Congress mandated Puerto Rico to draft its own Constitution which, when ratified by the electorate and implemented in 1952, provided greater autonomy as a Commonwealth.

The controls, display and speakers are all part of a single unit. Rather than a general-purpose screen made up of a grid of small pixels, they usually have custom displays designed to play one game. This simplicity means they can be made as small as a smartwatch, and sometimes are. The visual output of these games can range from a few small light bulbs or LED lights to calculator-like alphanumerical screens; later these were mostly displaced by liquid crystal and vacuum fluorescent display screens with detailed images and in the case of VFD games, color. Handhelds were at their most popular from the late 1970s into the early 1990s. They are the precursors to the handheld game console. History Early handheld games used simple mechanisms to interact with players, often limited to illuminated buttons and sound effects. Notable early handheld games included Mattel Auto Race (1976), and Mattel Electronic Football (1977),DP Interviews. Digitpress.com. Retrieved on 2013-09-27. which featured very simple red-LED displays; gameplay involved the player pressing buttons to move his car or quarterback icon (represented by a bright dot) to avoid obstacles (represented by less bright dots). In 1978 the Milton Bradley Company entered the handheld market with Simon, a simple color-and-sound-matching game. Simon had no dedicated display, but featured four colored, lighted buttons; the original version was large enough to be used as a tabletop game or a handheld; later versions became increasingly smaller. The same year, Parker Brothers also released Merlin, a more sophisticated handheld which could play six different games using an array of 11 buttons with integrated LEDs. Despite their relative simplicity, each of these early games was highly successful. The initial success of Mattel and Parker Brothers' entries spawned a wave of similar handheld devices which were released through the early 1980s. Notable among these were a series of popular 2-player \\"head-to-head\\" games from Coleco. Other games were miniaturized versions of popular arcade video games. In 1979, Gunpei Yokoi, traveling on a bullet train, saw a bored businessman playing with an LCD calculator by pressing the buttons. Yokoi then thought of an idea for a watch that doubled as a miniature game machine for killing time.The Escapist: Searching for Gunpei Yokoi Starting in 1980, Nintendo began to release a series of electronic games designed by Yokoi called the Game & Watch games. Taking advantage of the technology used in the credit-card-sized calculators that had appeared on the market, Yokoi designed the series of LCD-based games to include a digital time display in the corner of the screen. For later, more complicated Game & Watch games, Yokoi invented a cross shaped directional pad or \\"D-pad\\" for control of on-screen characters. Yokoi also included his directional pad on the Famicom game console's controllers, and the cross- shaped thumb controller soon became standard on game console controllers and ubiquitous across the video game industry as a replacement for the joystick. During the 1980s, LCDs became inexpensive and largely replaced LED displays in handheld games. The use of custom images in LCD and VFD games allows them to have greater detail and avoid the blocky, pixellated look of console screens, but not without drawbacks. All graphics are fixed in place, so every possible location and state of game objects has to be preset (and are usually visible when resetting a game), with no overlap. Illusion of movement is created by sequentially flashing objects between their possible states. Backgrounds for these games are static drawings, layered behind the \\"moving\\" graphics which are transparent when not in use. Partly due to these limitations, the gameplay of early LCD games was often even more crude than for their LED antecedents. Some of the more well-known handheld games of the LCD era are the Game & Watch series by Nintendo and the games by Tiger Electronics, and many titles from other companies were also popular, especially conversions of arcade games. New games are still being made, but most are based on relatively simple card and board games. In 1982, the Bandai LCD Solarpower series were the first solar- powered gaming devices. Some of its games, such as the horror-themed game Terror House, featured two LCD panels, one stacked on the other, for an early 3D effect.The top ten retro gaming secrets (page 3) , PC Pro In 1983, Takara Tomy's Tomytronic 3D series simulated 3D by having two LED panels that were lit by external light through a window on top of the device, making it the first dedicated home video 3D hardware.The top ten retro gaming secrets (page 1) , PC Pro Other handheld games were built as flipcases and had two or even three LCDs with different foreground and background scenes, offering some variety in the gameplay. Handhelds today Brick Game Despite the increasing sophistication of handheld consoles such as the Nintendo Switch, dedicated handhelds continue to find a niche. Among technophilic gamer subcultures like Akiba-kei, unique control schemes like that of the 2008 Tuttuki Bako have been proven salable due to novelty, however dedicated handhelds such as this are uncommon. Adult fads such as blackjack, poker, and Sudoku also spawn dozens of original and knockoff handheld games. Devices like Brick Game (E-Star E-23) include games using the block grid as a crude, low resolution dot matrix screen. Such devices often have many variations of Tetris and sometimes even other kinds of games like racing or even space shooters, such as Space Invaders, where one box projects boxes at the enemy boxes. The most advanced of these designs can easily have more than 20 distinct games implemented and feature multi-channel sound, voice synthesis or digital sounds samples, and internal CMOS memory which can save the current game progress and high scores when the system is turned off. Many of these handhelds with a dozen such games are marketed as having hundreds or even thousands of games, though the vast majority are just different speed and difficulty settings. The most basic can now be sold for less than the cost of a glossy magazine. At the lowest end of handheld game sophistication, there is also the \\"avoid/catch the falling objects\\" game. These games are controlled with 2 movement buttons, and sport a screen with a column of player positions, and rows of projectiles to animate towards the player. The player and projectiles could be any picture, from tanks dodging missiles to a dog catching sausages.

Almodis de la Marche ( 1020 – 16 October 1071) was a French noble. She was famed for her marriage career, in particularly for her third marriage to Ramon Berenguer I, Count of Barcelona, with whom she committed double bigamy in 1053, for which the Pope had them excommunicated. Life Almodis was the daughter of Bernard I, Count of Marche and wife Amélie. She married Hugh V of Lusignan around 1038 and they had two sons and one daughter. Almodis and Hugh of Lusignan divorced due to consanguinity. She later, with Hugh's assistance, married Count Pons of Toulouse in 1040. Almodis was still Pons' wife in April 1053, when she was abducted by Ramon Berenguer I, Count of Barcelona. He kidnapped her from Narbonne with the aid of a fleet sent north by his ally, the Muslim emir of Tortosa. They married immediately (despite the fact both of her previous husbands were still alive) and they appear with their twin sons in a charter the next year. Pope Victor II excommunicated Almodis and Ramon for this illegal marriage until 1056. Almodis maintained contact with her former husbands and many children, and in 1066/1067 she traveled to Toulouse for her daughter's wedding. A few years before, in 1060, Hugh V of Lusignan had revolted against his lord, Duke William VIII of Aquitaine, in support of Almodis' son William IV of Toulouse. Her sons supported one another in military campaigns; Hugh VI of Lusignan, Raymond IV of Toulouse, and Berenguer Ramon all took the Cross. Her third husband Ramon was married to her niece, Isabela Trencavel, the daughter of Rangearde de la Marche. Their son, Peter Raymundi, was Ramon's original heir. Peter Raymundi resented Almodis' influence and was concerned she was trying to replace him with her own two sons, his consanguinous nephews, both who had claims through their father, Count La Marche. He murdered her in October 1071. William of Malmesbury reflected that she was, \\"sad, [of] unbridled lewdness\\". Pere-Ramon was disinherited and exiled for his crime and fled the country. When his father died in 1076, Barcelona was split between Almodis' sons, Berenguer Ramon and Ramon Berenguer. The family history of murder did not end with Pere-Ramon, as Berenguer Ramon earned his nickname \\"The Fratricide\\" when he killed his own twin brother.

Tradition has evolved that there are words or phrases that are deemed inappropriate for use in the legislature whilst it is in session. In a Westminster system, this is called unparliamentary language and there are similar rules in other kinds of legislative systems. This includes, but is not limited to, the suggestion of dishonesty or the use of profanity. Most unacceptable is any insinuation that another member is dishonourable. So, for example, in the British House of Commons any direct reference to a member as lying is unacceptable. A conventional alternative, when necessary, is to complain of a \\"terminological inexactitude\\". Exactly what constitutes unparliamentary language is generally left to the discretion of the Speaker of the House. Part of the speaker's job is to enforce the assembly's debating rules, one of which is that members may not use \\"unparliamentary\\" language. That is, their words must not offend the dignity of the assembly. In addition, legislators in some places are protected from prosecution and civil actions by parliamentary immunity which generally stipulates that they cannot be sued or otherwise prosecuted for anything spoken in the legislature. Consequently, they are expected to avoid using words or phrases that might be seen as abusing that immunity. Like other rules that have changed with the times, speakers' rulings on unparliamentary language reflect the tastes of the period. The Table, the annual journal of the Society of Clerks-at-the-Table in Commonwealth Parliaments, includes a list of expressions ruled unparliamentary that year in the national and regional assemblies of its members. Partial list, by country=Australia In the Australian Senate, the words \\"liar\\" and \\"dumbo\\" were ordered to be withdrawn and deemed unparliamentary during a session in 1997. Belgium In Belgium there is no such thing as unparliamentary language. A member of parliament is allowed to say anything he or she wishes when inside parliament. This is considered necessary in Belgium to be able to speak of a democratic state and is a constitutional right. Nevertheless, on 27 March 2014, Laurent Louis called the Prime Minister Elio Di Rupo a pedophile. The other members of parliament left the room in protest. This immunity that manifests itself in an absolute freedom of speech when in parliament does not exist when outside of parliament. In that case prosecution is possible when and if the majority of parliament decides so. Canada These are some of the words and phrases that speakers through the years have ruled \\"unparliamentary\\" in the Parliament of Canada, the Legislative Assembly of Alberta, and the National Assembly of Québec: * Parliamentary pugilist (1875) * a bag of wind (1878) * inspired by forty-rod whisky (1881) * coming into the world by accident (1886) * blatherskite (1890) * the political sewer pipe from Carleton County (1917) * lacking in intelligence (1934) * a dim-witted saboteur (1956) * liar (1959) * devoid of honour (1960) * joker in the house (1960) * ignoramus (1961) * scurrilous (1961) * to hell with Parliament attitude (1961) * trained seal (1961) * evil genius (1962) * demagogue (1963) * Canadian Mussolini (1964) * sick animal (1966) * pompous ass (1967) * crook (1971) * does not have a spine (1971) * fuddle duddle (1971) * pig (1977) * jerk (1980) * sleazebag (1984) * racist (1986) * scuzzball (1988) * weathervane (2007) * a piece of shit (2011) * like a fart (2016) Hong Kong The President of the Legislative Council ordered out for using the following phrases: * (foul grass grows out of a foul ditch), when referring to some of the members (1996). The following phrases have been deemed unparliamentary by the President of the Legislative Council: * (literally stumble on street, loosely translated as \\"go die\\" or \\"go to hell\\") widely considered by Hong Kongers as unacceptable language in civil settings (2009). India In 2012, the Indian Parliament published a book of words and phrases that were considered to be unparliamentary: : Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves, bad man, badmashi, bandicoot, blackmail, blind, deaf and dumb, bluffing, bribe, bucket of shit, communist, confused mind, dacoit, darling (said to a female MP), deceive, double-minded, double-talk, downtrodden, goonda, lazy, liar, loudmouth, lousy, nuisance, racketeer, radical extremist, rat, ringmaster, scumbag, thief, thumbprint (to an illiterate MP) Ireland In Dáil Éireann, the lower house of the Oireachtas (Irish parliament), the chair (Ceann Comhairle or replacement) rules in accordance with standing orders on disorderly conduct, including prohibited words, expressions, and insinuations. If the chair rules that an utterance is out of order, then typically the member withdraws the remark and no further action occurs.Dáil Éireann 2011, §§272, 275; Dáil CPP 2010 p.8 §14 The relevant words are retained in the Official Report transcription despite being formally withdrawn. The chair cannot rule if they did not hear the words alleged to be unparliamentary. A member who refuses to withdraw a remark may be suspended and must leave the chamber.Dáil Éireann 2011, §§283(b), 286 A periodically updated document, Salient Rulings of the Chair, lists past rulings, ordered by topic, with reference to the Official Report.

Italy In Italian history, the unparliamentarian language was the only limit to free speech of a deputy. So it was claimed by Giacomo Matteotti in his last discourse in the Chamber of Deputies: In addition, during the Republic, the use of foul language in Parliament produced jurisprudence by the constitutional court, which has implemented the libel suits.See Giampiero Buonomo, Lo scudo di cartone, Rubbettino Editore, 2015, p. 25 , ; see also ((https://www.academia.edu/12695276/Autorecensione_02_dello_Scudo)). New Zealand The Parliament of New Zealand maintains a list of words, and particularly phrases, that the Speaker has ruled are unbecoming, insulting, or otherwise unparliamentary. These include:\\"Special topics: unparliamentary language\\", Parliament of New Zealand website, dated 28 July 2006, retrieved 16 April 2016. * idle vapourings of a mind diseased (1946) * his brains could revolve inside a peanut shell for a thousand years without touching the sides (1949) * energy of a tired snail returning home from a funeral (1963) The Parliament also maintains a list of language that has been uttered in the House, and has been found not to be unparliamentary; this includes: * commo (meaning communist, 1969) * scuttles for his political funk hole (1974) Norway In 2009, a member of the Progress Party was interrupted during question period by the Speaker for calling a minister a \\"highway bandit\\". United Kingdom In the House of Commons of the United Kingdom, the following words have been deemed unparliamentary over time: :bastard, blackguard, coward, deceptive, dodgy, drunk, falsehoods, git, guttersnipe, hooligan, hypocrite, idiot, ignoramus, liar, pipsqueak, rat, slimy, sod, squirt, stoolpigeon, swine, tart, traitor,\\"Unparliamentary language\\", BBC News website, 31 October 2008, retrieved 3 April 2009 wart In addition, accusations of 'crooked deals' or insinuation of the use of banned substances by a member are considered unparliamentary language (all attributable to Dennis Skinner). An accusation that an MP's presence in the house has \\"been bought\\" is also unparliamentary. The word 'dodgy' when used by Ed Miliband, was not however, found to be unparliamentary. In 2019, in the run up to the Conservative leadership election, SNP leader Ian Blackford accused Boris Johnson of being a racist. Asked to withdraw the term by the speaker, Blackford confirmed that he had informed Johnson about his intention to use it and qualified his statement. The speaker then allowed it to stand. In the following week he accused Johnson of being a liar (\\"has made a career out of lying\\"). No request was made by the speaker to withdraw this statement. =Northern Ireland= The Speaker of the Northern Ireland Assembly, William Hay MLA, gave a ruling in the Chamber on 24 November 2009 on unparliamentary language. In essence rather than making judgements on the basis of particular words or phrases that have been ruled to be unparliamentary in the Assembly or elsewhere the Speaker said that he would judge Members' remarks against standards of courtesy, good temper and moderation which he considered to be the standards of parliamentary debate. He went on to say that in making his judgement he would consider the nature of Members' remarks and the context in which they were made. In 2013, Hay ruled that insinuation of MLAs being members of proscribed organizations was unparliamentary language. =Wales= In the National Assembly for Wales the Presiding Officer has intervened when the term \\"lying\\" has been used. In December 2004, the Presiding Officer notably sent Leanne Wood out of the chamber for referring to Queen Elizabeth II as 'Mrs Windsor'. United States In the US, representatives were censured for using unparliamentary language in the House of Representatives throughout its history. Other levels of government have similar disciplinary procedures dealing with inappropriate words spoken in the legislature. Avoiding unparliamentary language It is a point of pride among some British MPs to be able to insult their opponents in the House without use of unparliamentary language. Several MPs, notably Sir Winston Churchill, have been considered masters of this game. Some terms which have evaded the Speaker's rules are: *Terminological inexactitude (lie) *Being economical with the truth (lying by omission), since used on the floor of the house as an insult or taunt. *Tired and emotional, a euphemism for intoxicated Clare Short implicitly accused the Employment minister Alan Clark of being drunk at the dispatch box shortly after her election in 1983, but avoided using the word, saying that Clark was \\"incapable\\". Clark's colleagues on the Conservative benches in turn accused Short of using unparliamentary language and the Speaker asked her to withdraw her accusation. Clark later admitted in his diaries that Short had been correct in her assessment. In 1991, Speaker Bernard Weatherill adjudged that usage of the word \\"jerk\\" by Opposition leader Neil Kinnock was not unparliamentary language.\\"European Community (Intergovernmental Conferences)\\". theyworkforyou.com.

The neighborhood is known for its strong Italian-American heritage and identity. The neighborhood is still mostly populated by the descendants of Italian-American immigrants and remains a closely knit ethnic enclave. Due to its close proximity to desirable neighborhoods such as Fell's Point, Upper Fell's Point and Harbor East, real estate values in Little Italy have become high in recent years. Another cause for the neighborhood's competitive real estate market is the lack of properties entering the market due to the longstanding neighborhood tradition of keeping houses within the family. Each summer, the Little Italy community hosts an outdoor film festival where outdoor movies are projected onto a wall at the intersection of High and Stiles Streets. History Located just east of the Inner Harbor, Little Italy was given its name due to the large number of Italian immigrant families that moved into the area during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. When Italian immigrants first moved into the what is now Little Italy, the neighborhood was home to a diverse community of Irish, German, and Jewish immigrants. By the start of the 20th century, the neighborhood had become almost exclusively Italian-American, eventually earning it the name, Little Italy. Little Italy is home to St. Leo the Great Roman Catholic Church, established in 1881 (cornerstone laid 1880), and listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

He last rode for on the UCI World Tour. Robbie is a three-time winner of the Tour de France points classification and, at the peak of his career, was considered one of the world's fastest sprinters. A former Australian BMX champion, McEwen switched to road cycling in 1990 at 18 years of age. He raced as a professional from 1996 until 2012. McEwen lives in Australia with his Belgian wife, Angélique Pattyn, his son, Ewan, and his daughters, Elena and Claudia. In 2011, McEwen published an autobiography entitled 'One Way Road'. McEwen lived for many years in the Belgian town of Everbeek and is fluent in Dutch. Robbie retired from the World Tour after riding the 2012 Tour of California and is now an occasional cyclist journalist, commentating on the Tour Down Under and the Tour de France. Career Bay Cycling Classic McEwen was born in Brisbane. After four years of moving through the regional, state and national levels of cycling, he started at the Australian Institute of Sport in Canberra under road cycling coach Heiko Salzwedel. The first signs of his sprinting prowess on the international stage were at the Peace Race, winning three stages for the Australian national team. McEwen competed in the road race at the 1996 Atlanta Olympic Games (23rd) and the 2000 Sydney Olympic Games (19th). He was also included on the Australian team for the 1994 UCI Road Cycling World Championship in Italy, and the 2002 UCI Road Cycling World Championship in Belgium, where he won a silver medal. McEwen was again selected for Australia at the 2004 Athens Olympic Games (11th) as part of the road race team. McEwen was named 2002 Australian Cyclist of the Year, 2002 Male Road Cyclist of the Year and 1999 Male Road Cyclist of the Year. After spending 16 seasons racing for foreign teams (Dutch: Rabobank & Farm Frites; Belgian: Lotto; Russian: Katusha; USA: RadioShack), Robbie signed for the new Australian team in September 2011 after it gained a ProTeam licence for the 2012 season. Tour de France McEwen participated in the Tour de France on 12 occasions: 1997 (117th), 1998 (89th), 1999, 2000, 2002, 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008 and 2010. Over the years, he has won 12 stages. In 1999, McEwen won the final stage sprint in Paris on the Champs-Elysées. In 2002, McEwen won stage 3 (Metz–Reims) and stage 20 (Melun–Paris). In 2004, McEwen won stages 3 and 9. In 2005, McEwen won stage 5 to Montargis, stage 7 to Karlsruhe in Germany, and stage 13 to Montpellier. In 2006, McEwen won stages 2, 4 and 6 to Esch-sur- Alzette, St Quentin and Vitré respectively. He started the 2007 Tour with a victorious sprint on stage 1 to Canterbury. The stage win was seen as remarkable as he had crashed with to go. He injured his knee and wrist but with the help of his team he clawed his way back to the bunch to win the sprint by over a bike length. The injuries he sustained from this crash did not prevent him from continuing but eventually he was forced out of the race when the Tour entered the Mountains, his knee injury became worse and he failed to finish stage eight within the time limit. In 2002, McEwen became the first Australian to win the Tour de France points classification. By 2006, McEwen had won the Tour de France green points jersey three times in this race – in 2002, 2004 and, again, in 2006 – defeating rivals such as fellow Australians Baden Cooke and Stuart O'Grady, and international competitors like Erik Zabel of Germany, Tom Boonen of Belgium and Thor Hushovd of Norway. McEwen's first win in the 2002 Tour de France saw him win the green jersey from German legend Erik Zabel, with O’Grady third and Cooke fourth. In 2004, McEwen won the points classification for a second time, defeating Hushovd and Erik Zabel. McEwen had fractured two transverse process (vertebrae) in a mass pile up on stage 6 and continued the race in extreme pain, making his stage 9 win in Gueret all the more remarkable. McEwen won his third and final Points classification in the 2006 Tour de France, this time with Zabel second and Hushovd third. In 2012, he announced that the Tour of California would be the last professional race of his career. He struggled to reach the finishing line of the mountain stages in the gruppetto. He humorously said after his arrival on the final stage in Los Angeles: \\"This was a good race to pick as my last because I suffered so much this week I won't miss it.\\" He was awarded the \\"Most Courageous Rider\\" jersey at the end of the race to commemorate his last day of professional cycling. After retiring from racing, McEwen remained with Orica-GreenEDGE as a technical adviser and sprint coach. Commentating In 2017, 2018, 2019 and 2020, Robbie McEwen commentated on the Tour de France's world feed in English, alongside fellow Australian Matthew Keenan. Sprinting style McEwen was known as a particularly cunning and tactical sprinter. Where many teams would use 'Lead-Out Trains' to secure a stage win for their selected sprinter, McEwen achieved many of his victories either with one lead- out man, or often none at all, by aggressively and intelligently positioning himself within the peloton in the final kilometres. Fellow Australian cyclist Stuart O'Grady considers McEwen to be \\"one of the fastest, most powerful accelerators the planet has ever seen\\". Personal life McEwen has two brothers, the eldest is Ross and is getting into Triathlon, the youngest, Cam, is a Scrum Master at Telstra and a car enthusiast.

It has become best known through the subsequent film adaptation starring Cary Grant and directed by Frank Capra. The play was directed by Bretaigne Windust, and opened on Broadway at the Fulton Theatre on January 10, 1941. On September 25, 1943, the play moved to the Hudson Theatre. It closed there on June 17, 1944, having played 1,444 performances. Of the twelve plays written by Kesselring, Arsenic and Old Lace was the most successful, and, according to the opening night review in The New York Times, the play was \\"so funny that none of us will ever forget it.\\"\\"Arsenic and Old Lace, Brooks Atkinson, The New York Times, 11 January 1941. Plot Boris Karloff as Jonathan Brewster The play is a farcical black comedy revolving around the Brewster family, descended from the Mayflower settlers but now composed of maniacs, most of them homicidal. The hero, Mortimer Brewster, is a drama critic who must deal with his crazy, murderous family and local police in Brooklyn, New York, as he debates whether to go through with his recent promise to marry the woman he loves, Elaine Harper, who lives next door and is the daughter of the local minister. His family includes two spinster aunts who have taken to murdering lonely old men by poisoning them with a glass of home- made elderberry wine laced with arsenic, strychnine, and \\"just a pinch\\" of cyanide; a brother who believes he is Theodore Roosevelt and digs locks for the Panama Canal in the cellar of the Brewster home (which then serve as graves for the aunts' victims; he thinks that they died of yellow fever); and a murderous brother who has received plastic surgery performed by an alcoholic accomplice, Dr. Einstein (a character based on real-life gangland surgeon Joseph Moran) to conceal his identity, and now looks like horror-film actor Boris Karloff (a self-referential joke, as the part was originally played on Broadway by Karloff). The film adaptation follows the same basic plot, with a few minor changes. The character Mortimer Brewster says of his family’s history that it is as if \\"...Strindberg wrote Hellzapoppin.\\" Cast Erich von Stroheim replaced Boris Karloff as Jonathan Brewster in the original Broadway production The opening night cast consisted of: * Jean Adair as Martha Brewster * John Alexander as Teddy Brewster * Wyrley Birch as The Rev. Dr. Harper * Helen Brooks as Elaine Harper * Bruce Gordon as Officer Klein * Henry Herbert as Mr. Gibbs * Josephine Hull as Abby Brewster * Allyn Joslyn as Mortimer Brewster * Boris Karloff as Jonathan Brewster * William Parke as Mr. Witherspoon * John Quigg as Officer Brophy * Anthony Ross as Officer O'Hara * Edgar Stehli as Dr. Einstein * Victor Sutherland as Lieutenant Rooney Inspiration When Kesselring taught at Bethel College in North Newton, Kansas, he lived in a boarding house called the Goerz House, and many of the features of its living room are reflected in the Brewster sisters' living room, where the action of the play is set. The Goerz House is now the home of the college president. The \\"murderous old lady\\" plot line may also have been inspired by actual events that occurred in a house on Prospect St in Windsor, Connecticut, where a woman, Amy Archer-Gilligan, took in boarders, promising \\"lifetime care,\\" and poisoned them for their pensions. M. William Phelps book The Devil's Rooming House (2010) tells the story of the police officers and reporters from the Hartford Courant who solved the case. Kesselring originally conceived the play as a heavy drama, but it is widely believed that producers Howard Lindsay and Russel Crouse (who were also well known as play doctors) convinced Kesselring that it would be much more effective as a comedy. TV adaptation On January 5, 1955, a 60-minute version of the play aired on the CBS Television series The Best of Broadway. It starred Boris Karloff, recreating his stage role as homicidal maniac Jonathan Brewster. Helen Hayes and Billie Burke played his not-so-innocent aunts, Abby and Martha. Peter Lorre and Edward Everett Horton repeated their roles as Dr. Einstein and Mr. Witherspoon, which they had played in Frank Capra's film version. John Alexander, who created the role of Teddy Brewster on Broadway and reprised it in the film version, returned once more to play the role in the broadcast. Orson Bean played the role of Mortimer Brewster. Karloff played Jonathan once more (and for the last time) on the February 5, 1962 broadcast of NBC's Hallmark Hall of Fame. Dorothy Stickney and Mildred Natwick played Abby and Martha. Joseph Kesselring had sent his original play, then titled Bodies in Our Cellar, to Stickney when she was starring opposite her husband Howard Lindsay on Broadway in Life With Father (opened in 1939), with a view to her playing Abby Brewster. It would be 23 years before she would finally play the part. Tony Randall played Mortimer in the Hallmark production and Tom Bosley played Teddy. In 1969, Robert Scheerer directed a TV version with Helen Hayes and Lillian Gish as the elderly aunts, Bob Crane as Mortimer, Fred Gwynne as Jonathan and David Wayne as Teddy. Revivals Jezinky a bezinky, a Czech translation of the play in performance by the Brno City Theatre in 2012 Later revivals in the 1940s and 1950s had Bela Lugosi playing the role of Jonathan Brewster with box office returns reflecting better sales than when Boris Karloff traveled through the same cities. In 1965, Sybil Thorndike, Athene Seyler, Julia Lockwood and Richard Briers appeared in the play in London. The play is still widely performed and has been translated into many languages, including a Russian film. A Broadway revival of the play ran from June 26, 1986, to January 3, 1987, at the 46th Street Theatre in New York, starring Polly Holliday, Jean Stapleton, Tony Roberts and Abe Vigoda.

He was one of the two writers of the Principia Discordia, along with Kerry Wendell Thornley (a.k.a. Lord Omar Khayyam Ravenhurst). He was also adapted as a character in The Illuminatus! Trilogy. During the early years of circulation of the Principia Discordia, rumors claimed that the author of the book was Richard Nixon, Timothy Leary, or Robert Anton Wilson; or that the book and Malaclypse the Younger were both fictional inventions of Robert Anton Wilson, as with Abdul Alhazred's Necronomicon. Biography Gregory H. Hill was born in California on Wednesday, May 21, 1941. He worked for Western Union while a young man in the Southern California area of Whittier, California. Around 1958 or 1959 while still a teenager, he, Kerry Thornley and others began working on the Discordian religion. In 1965, the first edition of Principia Discordia was printed, allegedly in five copies. The most famous edition was the fourth. Hill spent much of his life working for Bank of America as a computer programmer, and moved to the San Francisco Bay Area. He had apparently visited there while a child. Robert Anton Wilson stated, in the lecture \\"The I in the Triangle\\" from 1990, that Greg Hill was at the time the head of a large computer facility owned by one of the largest banks in the United States.'The I in the Triangle', lecture by Robert Anton Wilson in 1990 Video of the lecture (duration: 1:56:25) A designer of one of the early video games, Hill wrote about computers including editing a computer-oriented newsletter. He also published an article proposing using a computer to transmit signals to remotely control robots. He was married to Jeanetta; they later separated and may have divorced. He died in the San Francisco Bay Area of California on the July 20, 2000. A long-time smoker, he died of cancer. In 1994, he and Omar Khayyam Ravenhurst were inducted into the Order of the Pineapple. Greg Hill described Mal-2 as a spirit sent into him by Eris that helped him write the Principia Discordia over the course of ten years in his early adulthood. An interview included in the fourth edition of the Principia Discordia by Loompanics Press reveals that Mal-2 left once the book was finished. He claims Mal-2 returned to leave a fifth and final edition consisting solely of a Western Union telegraph form filled with the letter \\"M\\". Greg Hill also reveals that he had access to Western Union forms when he worked at Western Union. Principia Discordia In 2006, a copy of the first edition of the Principia Discordia was claimed to have been discovered in the President John F. Kennedy Assassination Records Collection in the National Archives, proving Malaclypse the Younger to be Gregory Hill.The complete document may be found here:, and the entry in the JFK Assassination Archive here by searching for \\"Kerry Thornley\\". The document is titled \\"Discordian Socity\\" (sic). Possessing many titles, including \\"Omnibenevolent Polyfather of Virginity in Gold\\", Malaclypse's true identity or position within the Erisian religion is completely unknown. He is frequently mentioned in the Principia Discordia. Credited with wiring telegrams to God from the Celestial Hotel and decrying the usefulness of prayer, these claims are in the nature of the Principia Discordia. Very little is known about Malaclypse the Elder, the namesake of Mal-2. The Principia Discordia merely mentions him as a \\"non-prophet\\" and that he was mistaken for a doomsayer when carrying a sign that read \\"DUMB.\\" Illuminatus! Malaclypse the Younger also appears in The Illuminatus! Trilogy by Robert Shea and Robert Anton Wilson. According to Illuminatus!, he founded the Norton Cabal, and then left the cabal to join the very esoteric Erisian Liberation Front. The character Dr. Ignotum P. Ignotius says the last thing Mal-2 wrote before he left for the ELF was, \\"Everybody understands Mickey Mouse. Few understand Hermann Hesse. Hardly anyone understands Albert Einstein. And nobody understands Emperor Norton.\\" This is the slogan of the Joshua Norton Cabal of San Francisco. Malaclypse the Elder has an even larger role in The Illuminatus! Trilogy. In fact, he is an important shape-shifting character in the book, posing as Jean-Paul Sartre, Billy Graham, and the Devil. According to Malaclypse the Elder himself, he is a 4th century B.C. Erisian priest (who was also prepared to perform services to Hermes, Dionysus, Heracles, Aphrodite, Athena, and Hera) who achieved \\"transcendental illumination\\" in the course of the massacre at Melos in 415 BC. The Illuminati believe that death releases a certain form of energy. Given enough death and a person intent on capturing said energy, a person may be transformed into an immortal, immaterial being, or so the plot element goes. Malaclypse the Elder also posed as Jesus after Jesus was crucified. In the form of Jesus, he introduced Bingo, but asked Luke to not record it. Bibliography *Malaclypse the Younger.

The Noahic Covenant (in Genesis), which is between God and all living creatures, as well as a number of more specific covenants with individuals or groups. Biblical covenants include those with Abraham, the whole Israelite people, the Israelite priesthood, and the Davidic lineage of kings. In form and terminology, these covenants echo the kinds of treaty agreements in the surrounding ancient world. In the Book of Jeremiah, verses predict \\"a new covenant\\" that God will establish with \\"the house of Israel\\". Most Christians believe this New Covenant is the \\"replacement\\" or \\"final fulfilment\\" of the Old Covenant described in the Old Testament and as applying to the People of God, while some believe both covenants are still applicable in a dual covenant theology. Ancient Near Eastern treaties The Hebrew term בְּרִית bĕriyth for \\"covenant\\" is from a root with the sense of \\"cutting\\", because pacts or covenants were made by passing between cut pieces of flesh of the victim of an animal sacrifice.Strong's Concordance (1890). There are two major types of covenants in the Hebrew Bible, including the obligatory type and the promissory type. The obligatory covenant is more common with the Hittite peoples, and deals with the relationship between two parties of equal standing. In contrast, the promissory type of covenant is seen in the Abrahamic and Davidic covenants. Promissory covenants focus on the relationship between the suzerain and the vassal and are similar to the \\"royal grant\\" type of legal document, which include historical introduction, border delineations, stipulations, witnesses, blessings, and curses. In royal grants, the master could reward a servant for being loyal. God rewarded Abraham, Noah, and David in his covenants with them.Weinfeld, M. (2005). Normative and Sectarian Judaism in the Second Temple Period. United States: T & T Clark International. As part of his covenant with Abraham, God has the obligation to keep Abraham's descendants as God's chosen people and be their God. God acts as the suzerain power and is the party of the covenant accompanied by the required action that comes with the oath whether it be fire or animals in the sacrificial oaths. In doing this, God is the party taking upon the curse if he does not uphold his obligation. Through history there were also many instances where the vassal was the one who performed the different acts and took the curse upon them. Terminology of covenants Weinfeld believes that similar terminology and wording can connect the Abrahamic and Davidic covenants with ancient Near Eastern grants, as opposed to being largely similar to the Mosaic covenant, which, according to Weinfeld, is an example of a suzerainty treaty. He goes on to argue that phrases about having a \\"whole heart\\" or having \\"walked after me [God] with all his heart\\" strongly parallels with Neo- Assyrian grant language, such as \\"walked with royalty\\". He further argues that in Jeremiah, God uses prophetic metaphor to say that David will be adopted as a son. Expressing legal and political relationships through familial phraseology was common among Near Eastern cultures. Babylonian contracts often expressed fathership and sonship in their grants to actually mean a king to vassal relationship. Further underlying the idea that these covenants were grant-like in nature is the similar language used in both. In the grant of Ashurbanipal, an Assyrian, to his servant Bulta, he describes Bulta's loyalty with the phrase \\"kept the charge of my kinship\\". Abraham similarly kept God's charge in Genesis 26: 4–5: \\"I will give to your descendants all these lands...in as much as Abraham obeyed me and kept my charge, my commandments, my rules and my teachings.\\" Dissolving covenant form According to Mendhenhall, pressures from outside invaders led the loosely bound Israelite tribes to converge into monarchical unity for stability and solidarity. He also argues that during this consolidation, the new state also had to unify the religious traditions that belonged to the different groups to prevent dissent from those who might believe that the formation of a state would replace direct governance from God. Therefore, Mendenhall continues, these loosely bound tribes merged under the Mosaic covenant to legitimize their unity. They believed that to obey the law was to obey God. They also believed that the king was put into power as a result of God's benefaction, and that this accession was the fulfillment of God's promise of dynasty to David. Mendenhall also notes that a conflict arose between those who believed in the Davidic covenant, and those who believed that God would not support all actions of the state. As a result, both sides became relatively aloof, and the Davidic covenant and the Mosaic covenant were almost entirely forgotten. Biblical covenants=Number of biblical covenants Students of the Bible hold wildly differing opinions as to how many major covenants exist (or did exist) between God and humanity, with numbers ranging from one to at least twelve. (See covenant theology and dispensationalism for further information on two of the major viewpoints.) Some scholars classify only two: a covenant of promise and a covenant of law. The former involved an oath taken by God - a word of promise instead of command - while the latter is known in the Bible as \\"the Law\\". Edenic covenant The Edenic covenant applies to all of humanity. It can be found in Genesis 1:28-30. In this passage, God gives mankind the mandate to procreate and God gives mankind dominion over the earth and all the animals. Noahic covenant Noah's Thanksoffering (c.1803) by Joseph Anton Koch. Noah builds an altar to the Lord after being delivered from the great Flood; God sends the rainbow as a sign of his covenant. The Noahic covenant applies to all of humanity and all other living creatures. In this covenant with all living creatures, God promises never again to destroy all life on Earth by flood and creates the rainbow as the sign of this \\"everlasting covenant between God and every living creature of all flesh that is on the earth\\". Noah and the generations of his posterity were required in their turn never to shed human blood (murder), because mankind was made in the image of God. Mankind was forbidden to consume meat with the blood in it, so the blood must be drained from the animal before consuming. Abrahamic covenant The covenant found in is known as the Brit bein HaBetarim, the \\"Covenant Between the Parts\\" in Hebrew, and is the basis for brit milah (covenant of circumcision) in Judaism. The covenant was for Abraham and his seed, or offspring, both of natural birth and adoption. And ye shall circumcise the flesh of your foreskin; and it shall be a token of the covenant betwixt me and you. And he that is eight days old shall be circumcised among you, every man child in your generations, he that is born in the house, or bought with money of any stranger, which is not of thy seed. He that is born in thy house, and he that is bought with thy money, must needs be circumcised: and my covenant shall be in your flesh for an everlasting covenant. With Abraham multiple promised lands were given to his innumerable descendants (Gen 15:18-21; 17:1-9, 19; 22:15-18; 26:2-4, 24; 28; 35:9-13; Gal 3; Abr 2:6-11), with special 'gathering' and leadership roles assigned to the descendants of Joseph and his son Ephraim (Gen 48 and 50; Deut 33:17; 1 Chron 5:1-2; Psalm 80:2; Isaiah 11:13; Jer 31:6, 9; Ezek 37:15-19; Zech 10:6-12), and circumcision marking them as a peculiar people set apart (Gen 17:10-13). In Genesis chapters 12–17 three covenants can be distinguished based on the differing Jahwist, Elohist and Priestly sources.Michael D. Coogan, A Brief Introduction to the Old Testament, (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2009), 62–68 In Genesis 12 and 15, God grants Abraham land and a multitude of descendants but does not place any stipulations (meaning it was unconditional) on Abraham for the covenant's fulfillment. By contrast, Genesis 17 contains the covenant of circumcision (conditional). # To make of Abraham a great nation and bless Abraham and make his name great so that he will be a blessing, to bless those who bless him and curse him who curses him and all peoples on earth would be blessed through Abraham. # To give Abraham's descendants all the land from the river of Egypt to the Euphrates. Later, this land came to be referred to as the Promised Land (see map) or the Land of Israel. # To make Abraham the father of many nations and of many descendants and give \\"the whole land of Canaan\\" to his descendants. Circumcision is to be the permanent sign of this everlasting covenant with Abraham and his male descendants and is known as the brit milah. Covenants in biblical times were often sealed by severing an animal, with the implication that the party who breaks the covenant will suffer a similar fate. In Hebrew, the verb meaning to seal a covenant translates literally as \\"to cut\\". It is presumed by Jewish scholars that the removal of the foreskin symbolically represents such a sealing of the covenant.\\"Circumcision.\\" Mark Popovsky. Encyclopedia of Psychology and Religion. Ed. David A. Leeming, Kathryn Madden and Stanton Marlan. New York: Springer, 2010. pp. 153–154. According to Weinfeld, the Abrahamic covenant represents a covenant of grant, which binds the suzerain. It is the obligation of the master to his servant and involves gifts given to individuals who were loyal serving their masters. In the covenant with Abraham in Genesis 15, it is God who is the suzerain who commits himself and swears to keep the promise. In the covenant there are procedures for taking the oath, which involve a smoking oven and a blazing torch. There are many similarities between Genesis 15 and the Abba-El deed. In Genesis 15 and similarly in the Abba-El deed, it is the superior party who places himself under oath. The oaths in both, moreover, involve a situation wherein the inferior party delivers the animals while the superior party swears the oath. The Abrahamic covenant is part of a tradition of covenantal sacrifices that dates back to the third millennium BC. The animals that are slaughtered in the covenant in Genesis 15 are considered a sacrificial offering. And it is that covenant which preserves the sacrificial element alongside the symbolic act. Mosaic covenant The Ten Commandments on a monument on the grounds of the Texas State Capitol The Mosaic covenant made with Moses and the Israelite people at Horeb-Sinai, which is found in and the book of Deuteronomy, contains the foundations of the written Torah and the Oral Torah. In this covenant, God promises to make the Israelites his treasured possession among all people and \\"a kingdom of priests and a holy nation\\", if they follow God's commandments. As part of the terms of this covenant, God gives Moses the Ten Commandments (Exod 24:8; these are later embellished or elaborated on in the rest of the Torah). The blood of sacrificial oxen is thereafter sprinkled on the altar and on the people to seal the covenant. Beyond its central religious purpose, the Mosaic covenant was also political. It established Israel as a holy nation, God's special possession (Exod 19:5-6), with its chosen guardian-angel and shepherd, Yahweh, the Son of El-Elyon.Barker, Margaret. (2005) [1988]. \\"The Origin of Evil,\\" \\"The Cosmic Covenant,\\" and \\"Postscript,\\" in The Lost Prophet: The Book of Enoch and Its Influence on Christianity. London: SPCK; Sheffield Phoenix Press. pp. 33-48, 77-90, 92, 95, 97-98, 105-113. The form of the covenant resembles the suzerainty treaty in the ancient Near East.Kline, Meredith. \\"Deuteronomy\\". The Zondervan Pictorial Bible Dictionary Like the treaties, the Ten Commandments begins with Yahweh's identification and what he had done for Israel (\\"who brought you out of the land of Egypt\\"; Ex 20:2) as well as the stipulations commanding absolute loyalty (\\"You shall not have other gods apart from me\\"). Unlike the suzerainty treaty, the Decalogue does not have any witness nor explicit blessings and curses.Michael D. Coogan, \\"A Brief Introduction to the Old Testament\\" page 103, Oxford University Press, 2009 The fullest account of the Mosaic covenant is given in the book of Deuteronomy. God gave the children of Israel the Shabbat as the permanent sign of this covenant. Priestly covenant The priestly covenantQumran and Jerusalem: studies in the Dead Sea scrolls p. 248 Lawrence H. Schiffman – 2010 This priestly covenant is also echoed in the poem in 1QM 17:2–3 that refers to the eternal priestly covenant. ... Num 18:19).57 That the priestly “covenant of salt,” a biblical expression denoting a permanent covenant,58 is to be ... ( brith ha-kehuna) is the covenant that God made with Aaron and his descendants, the Aaronic priesthood, as found in the Hebrew Bible and Oral Torah. The Hebrew Bible also mentions another perpetual priestly promise with Phinehas and his descendants.Jewish Encyclopedia: Phinehas: \\"...for this act he was approved by God and was rewarded with the divine promise that the priesthood should remain in his family forever (Num. xxv. 7–15).\\"Jewish Encyclopedia: Covenant: \\"The term \\"berit\\" ... refers chiefly to God's covenant made with Israel, and with Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Moses, Aaron, Phineas, and David (Derek Ereẓ Zuṭa, i., end).\\" Davidic covenant The royal covenant was made with David (2 Sam 7). It promised to establish his dynasty forever while acknowledging that its original royal-covenant promises had been given to the ancestor of the whole nation, Abraham. The Davidic covenant establishes David and his descendants as the kings of the united monarchy of Israel (which included Judah). The Davidic covenant is an important element in Jewish messianism and Christian theology. In Jewish eschatology, the messiah is believed to be a future Jewish king from the Davidic line, who will be anointed with holy anointing oil, gather the Jews back into the Land of Israel, usher in an era of peace, build the Third Temple, have a male heir, re-institute the Sanhedrin and rule the Jewish people during the Messianic Age. The tablets of the Ten Commandments were kept in the Ark of the Covenant, and this became the symbol of the Israelite nation, and of God's presence with His people. Thus when King David wanted to establish Jerusalem as his own capital city he brought the Ark there (2 Sam 6). \\"It is this picture of the covenant which colours most of our thinking about covenant in the Old Testament, and in the expression 'Law and Gospel' it represents the old covenant of the law [of Moses] in contrast with the new covenant of the gospel [of Jesus Christ]. But older than the Mosaic covenant was the royal covenant [of Abraham extended through David], which promised stability to the royal house.\\" =Christian view of Davidic covenant= Christian theologian John F. Walvoord maintains that the Davidic covenant deserves an important place in determining the purposes of God and that its exegesis confirms the doctrine of a future reign of Christ on earth.Walvoord, John F. \\"Eschatological Problems VII: The Fulfillment of the Davidic Covenant.\\" Web: 19 Mar 2010. Eschatological Problems VII: The Fulfillment of the Davidic Covenant While Jewish theologians have always held that Jesus did not fulfill the expectations of a Jewish messiah, Dispensational (historically-grammatically literal) biblical theologians are almost unanimous that Jesus will fully fulfill the Davidic covenant, the provisions of which Walvoord lists as: # David is to have a child, yet to be born, who shall succeed him and establish his kingdom. # A son (Solomon) shall build the temple instead of David. # The throne of his kingdom shall be established forever. # The throne will not be taken away from him (Solomon) even though his sins justify chastisement. # David’s house, throne, and kingdom shall be established forever (2 Samuel 7:16). New covenant (Christian) The New Covenant is a biblical interpretation originally derived from a phrase in the Book of Jeremiah, in the Hebrew Scriptures. It is often thought of as an eschatological Messianic Age or world to come and is related to the biblical concept of the Kingdom of God. Generally, Christians believe that the New Covenant was instituted at the Last Supper as part of the Eucharist, which in the Gospel of John includes the New Commandment. A connection between the Blood of Christ and the New Covenant is seen in most modern English translations of the New Testamentbut not in the KJV for example with the saying: \\"this cup that is poured out for you is the new covenant in my blood\\". Christians see Jesus as the mediator of this New Covenant, and that his blood, shed at his crucifixion is the required blood of the covenant: as with all covenants between God and man described in the Bible, the New Covenant is considered \\"a bond in blood sovereignly administered by God\\".This definition of covenant is from O. Palmer Robertson's book The Christ of the Covenants. It has become an accepted definition among modern scholars. See this critical review of his book by Dr. C. Matthew McMahon. It has been theorized that the New Covenant is the Law of Christ as spoken during his Sermon on the Mount.George R. Law, \\"The Form of the New Covenant in Matthew,\\" American Theological Inquiry 5:2 (2012). In the Christian context, this New Covenant is associated with the word 'testament' in the sense of a 'will left after the death of a person', the instructions for the inheritance of property (Latin testamentum), the original Greek word used in Scripture being diatheke (διαθήκη) which in the Greek context only meant 'will (left after death)' and virtually never 'covenant, alliance'.Catholic Encyclopedia, 1912, article 'New Testament' https://www.catholic.com/encyclopedia/new-testament This fact implies a reinterpreted view of the Old Testament covenant as possessing characteristics of a 'will left after death' in Christian theology and has generated considerable attention from biblical scholars and theologians. The reason is connected with the translation of the Hebrew word for covenant, brit (בְּרִית), in the Septuagint: see 'why the word Testament' in the New Testament article. Islamic view The Mosaic covenant is referred to in a number of place in the Quran as a reminder for the Jews, of whom two tribes inhabited Medina at the time of Muhammad. The verses also mention particular commandments of the Decalogue and, in God's words, admonishes the Jews for being insolent about it and displaying violence against the prophets - a group of them they called liars, and other prophets among them they killed - even though they agreed to keep them at the time the covenant was made. The Quran also states how God cursed the Children of Israel and made them suffer for breaking the covenant while also mentioning other covenants such a prophetic covenant with the Israelites in , the Noahic and Abrahamic covenants in , and in and a covenant made with the followers of Jesus (apparently very different from how Christians interpret it), who likewise failed to observe it following their own desires.

The castle served as a place for safekeeping the Imperial Regalia as well as the Bohemian crown jewels, holy relics, and other royal treasures. Location It is located about southwest of Prague in the Beroun District of the Central Bohemian Region, above the market town of the same name. Tourism Karlštejn is one of the most famous and most frequently visited castles in the Czech Republic. As of 2019, it was the 5th most visited castle with more than 200,000 visitors per year. History The Imperial Crown of the Holy Roman Empire was kept in the Castle until 1421 Founded in 1348, the construction works were directed by the later Karlštejn burgrave Vitus of Bítov, but there are no records of the builder himself. Some historians speculate that Matthias of Arras may be credited with being the architect, but he had already died by 1352. It is likely that there was not a progressive and cunning architect, but a brilliant civil engineer who dexterously and with a necessary mathematical accuracy solved technically exigent problems that issued from the emperor's ideas and requests. Instead, Holy Roman Emperor Charles IV personally supervised the construction works and interior decoration. Construction was finished nearly twenty years later in 1365 when the \\"heart\\" of the treasury - the Chapel of the Holy Cross situated in the Great tower - was consecrated. Following the outbreak of the Hussite Wars, the Imperial Regalia were evacuated in 1421 and brought via Hungary to Nuremberg. In 1422, during the siege of the castle, Hussite attackers used biological warfare when Prince Sigismund Korybut used catapults to throw dead (but not plague-infected) bodies and 2,000 carriage-loads of dung over the walls, apparently managing to spread infection among the defenders. Karlštejn around 1850 Later, the Bohemian crown jewels were moved to the castle and were kept there for almost two centuries, with some short breaks. The castle underwent several reconstructions: in late Gothic style after 1480, in Renaissance style in the last quarter of the 16th century. In 1487, the big tower was damaged by fire and during the 16th century there were several adaptations. During the Thirty Years' War in 1619, the coronation jewels and the archive were brought to Prague, and in 1620, the castle was turned over to Ferdinand II, Holy Roman Emperor. After having been conquered in 1648 by Swedes, it fell in disrepair. Finally, a neo-Gothic reconstruction was carried out by Josef Mocker between 1887 and 1899, giving the castle its present look. The nearby village was founded during the construction of the castle and bore its name until it was renamed to Buda in the wake of the Hussite Wars. Renamed to Budňany in the 18th century, it was merged with Poučník and called Karlštejn (Beroun District). There is a golf club named after the castle nearby.Karlstejn Golf Club - Prague GOLF RESORT KARLŠTEJN a.s. On a nearby hillside behind the castle, there is a marker erected and maintained by the Czech/Slovak mission of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints. The marker signifies the place (known as \\"Priest's Hill\\") where Apostle John A. Widstoe, local members of the church, and American missionaries organised and dedicated the land of former Czechoslovakia for proselyting on July 24, 1929. The mission was closed during the communist era, and was reopened and rededicated in the 1990s by Apostle Russel M. Nelson. Every year on the 24th of July, all of the missionaries from the Czech Republic travel to the marker to celebrate the opening of the mission and to pray before returning to their proselyting. Architectural description Chapel of the Holy Cross The castle was built upon a promontory from the south side of Kněží Hora hill, divided from it by a narrow sag. The first gate, a square, two-storey tower with a tall hip roof, stood above a moat at the western slope of the promontory. It was connected with the rampart traverse by means of a small portal. The traverse was protected by battlement and divided by a covered bastion in the middle. The second gate led to the Burgrave House courtyard. Drawbridges closed both entrances. The Burgrave House formed the Karlštejn settlement, it was fortified with a two meters wide rampart, the Well Tower stood slightly lower. In the burgraviate's rampart a third gate was staved – the main entrance into the inner castle. The core of the castle consisted of three parts placed on three levels-differentiated terraces; every level express different importance. On the lowest terrace there stood the Imperial Palace, above it there was the Marian Tower and the Big Tower stood the highest. The Palace is a single-tract building, about wide and long, closed in the east by a semi-cylinder tower, had – aside of the cellar dug in the rock – the ground floor and two walled floors; the third floor under the roof was built from half-timbered work. The ground space is open to the courtyard, the rest was occupied by a granary. Three rooms form the first floor; largest is the central room, the so-called Knight Hall. The emperor inhabited the second floor of the palace; the floor was divided into four rooms by self-supporting partitions. A spiral staircase connected it with the third floor in which – according to the record from the 16th century – there was a residence of the \\"empress with her female retinue\\". The layout and equipment of the second and third floor was approximately the same: bedrooms on the eastern side, then the stateroom, a hall and the rooms in the west. Portrait of Charles IV and his wife Anna of Schweidnitz in the Chapel of St. Catherine in the Marian Tower The central area of the high and separately fortified Big Tower, with walls thick, is the Chapel of the Holy Cross; it has no analogy in concept elsewhere in the world. In the safety of the chapel, behind four doors with nineteen locks to each key was guarded independently, the valuable documents of the state archive were kept along with the symbols of the state power – the Imperial Regalia, later the Czech Crown Jewels. The Well Tower, being the logistical centerpiece the castle could not function without, was the first part of the castle to be built. Miners were brought in from the mining town of Kutná Hora, however, water was not encountered even after the depth of the well was , well below the level of the nearby Berounka river. An underground channel was therefore excavated to bring in water from a nearby stream, yielding a water column of , sufficient to last for several months. The reservoir had to be manually refilled roughly twice a year by opening a floodgate. Considering the significant strategic weakness incurred to the castle by the lack of an independent water source, the existence of the underground channel was a state secret known only to the Emperor himself, and the burgrave. The only other persons aware of its existence were the miners, who were however allegedly massacred on their way from the castle after the construction, leaving no survivors. Trivia A miniature replica of the castle was built by a Czech immigrant in Batchelor, Northern Territory.

The shock wave is refracted horizontally by density variations in the atmosphere so that it can have impacts in localized areas much further away than the theoretical extent of its blast effect. In large bombs, some effects may thus be found hundreds of kilometers from the blast site (such as in the case of the Tsar Bomba test, where damage was caused up to approximately 1,000 km away). This effect operates similarly to the patterns made by sunlight on the bottom of a pool, the difference is that the light is bent at the contact point with the water while the shock wave is distorted by density variations (e.g. due to temperature variations) in the atmosphere. Variations of wind can cause a similar effect. This will disperse the shock wave at some places and focus it at others. For powerful shock waves this can cause damage farther than expected; the shock wave energy density will decrease beyond expected values based on uniform geometry falloff for weak shock or acoustic waves, as expected at large distances).

It includes chronology, succession of office holders, their biographies and related records. Background Political science and history would be void and misunderstood without naming its chief actors. In many cases, these actors were those who either sat on the throne or enjoyed popular support at election or violently seized the power when circumstances permitted. There have always been those who held important state, public and party offices, those who wielded absolute power, those who were limited in their actions by law or tradition. This category colloquially known as \\"rulers\\" has been an object of studies in scientific chronology for long ages. An interest in studying the rulers emerged long before it became a part of history and chronology as academic disciplines. This distinctive interest in studying the chronologies of heads of states, governments, ministries and other offices may be rigorously defined as institutional chronology or even as archontology (from Greek, αρχων (archon), meaning ruler; used specifically for supreme magistrates, as in Athens, or even kings, as in the Cimmerian Bosporus). Development of archontology Institutional chronology as integral part of general chronology dates back to the times of first civilizations. One of the earliest efforts of ancient historians was aimed at compiling the chronology of contemporary rulers and their predecessors. The kinglists, found in most centers of the ancient civilizations (for an example, see the Sumerian kinglist), formed a basis for building more detailed historical accounts and served as a skeleton for further historical studies. It is difficult to imagine what history of Ancient Egypt we would have, if modern historians could not base their research on the tables of rulers by Manetho and the Abydos inscriptions. The history of Rome would be difficult to reconstruct if we did not have the availability of consular lists. The tradition of keeping records of rulers survived through the ages and became a part of modern history and chronology, but in fact it appears as a distinctive field of study and independent discipline closely related to political science and legal studies. Historians and chronographers built the lists of kings, queens, presidents and other powerful leaders. Royal genealogies including information on reigns and pedigree became the first analytical works in institutional chronology. A 17th-century work of R. P. Anselme, Histoire de la maison royale de France et des grands officiers de la CouronneR. P. Anselme, Histoire de la maison royale de France et des grands officiers de la Couronne. Paris, 1674 is an example of early studies focused on the heads of state and the holders of highest state offices. The 19th and 20th centuries witnessed the appearance of general works attempting to compile the lists of rulers sorted out by nations and time.(Stokvis, Poole, Spuler, Truhart) The most massive example of such study is the work of Peter Truhart, Regenten der Welt/Regents of NationsPeter Truhart, Regenten der Welt/Regents of Nations. Munich, 1985 a universal reference book for heads of states and governments of all nations of all times. It was published twice, in 1985 and in 2001, but is still riddled with errors resulting from the attempt by its author to include as much information as available regardless of its validity from the viewpoint of chronology. Works focused on a narrow scope of research enjoyed a far better success. The Handbook of British Chronology, a work continuously improved by its editors, serves as an excellent example of the combining of theoretical, historical and chronological methods. A large number of studies closely related to the institutional chronology is represented by thematic works on rulers of different nations. These works may include documented information, but often deviate from the main course of archontology. Apparently in attempt to extend the limits of a target group, their authors often focus on curious but less important facts. Contemporary archontology and genealogy receive the support of many enthusiasts interested in collecting the information related to the history of offices. Modern technical improvements should increase the sophistication of chronological analysis and turn institutional chronology into a more refined discipline. These fields not only offer opportunities for amateurs, but currently depend on their input, both as to facts and as to analysis and organization. However, the quality of studies has not yet dramatically improved. The process of collecting attracts many of those whose primary objectives were far from profound analysis and extensive study. The majority of the studies currently being published leans towards an easier approach. Approaches to archontology Further development of archontology as academic discipline requires new approaches. More attention to the facts determining the dates of reigns and offices. What should be accepted as a sound reason for dating the beginning of a reign: the death of a predecessor, the proclamation by parliament, coronation? What does officially determine the premature end of an office holder's tenure: the date of his/her resignation, the date when the resignation was accepted by national legislature, the installation of a successor? Such questions are often neglected or noted only occasionally. Therefore, the study of political developments and national legal systems should be recognized as essential tool in determination of dates. Personal identification of \\"rulers\\" should be used by adding biographical details including full names, titles, precise dates and geographic locations of births and deaths. Numerous studies contradict each other concerning even the most obvious dates. The reasons for such contradictions apparently lay in the fact that different authors were chiefly concerned with building consistent chronologies, which recorded each possible name and date, but failed to provide reasonable explanations for picking the dates and sometimes even for historical characters included in such records. In most of these works one can hardly find references to the primary sources including archival documents. A lack of details and proper explanations diminishes the quality of reference works on institutional chronology. The availability of quality studies in this field varies from country to country. It is very simple to learn the dates and mechanisms of changing presidents in the United States from 1789, but not every book may answer the question what preceded the inauguration of George Washington and what role the presidents of the Continental Congress played in 1774 - 1788. The history of Russia is covered in thousands of studies, but we still cannot name a book providing documented dates for its heads of government in the 20th century as a constituent republic of the Soviet Union. A number of gaps remain for historians to fill. This enterprise would not involve only the study of printed primary sources, but also a lot of work in the archives. Archontology is not aimed at a simple collecting of dates and names, but combining them into detailed chronologies, where the changes of office holders are reasonably explained from the viewpoints of history, political science and law. This approach significantly boosts the value of the collected material and should help fill in the gaps existing in chronologies of national leaders. There is no carefully elaborated and universally accepted system for selecting and verifying chronological facts, but such a system would be extremely helpful to determine the criteria of selection for dates and names. The lack of authoritative information results from many factors. It might seem to be easy, but verification of dates and creation of consecutive chronologies appears to be a challenging task. Lists of rulers used as appendices to academic works are usually over-simplified and poorly verified. This may be the case because the verification requires consulting a great number of official periodicals and collections of legal statutes published in various countries. The tiny facts related to the changes in government are hidden deeply in the minutes of national parliaments and executive bodies. An illustrative example of discovering new names for institutional chronology is the story of Wilhelm Pfannkuch, who was practically excluded from the list of rulers of Germany until the facts were found restoring his place in historical chronology. While Eduard David, the first president of the Nationalversammlung (7 February 1919 - 13 February 1919), was always considered as temporary head of state of Germany from 7 February 1919 to 11 February 1919, the name of Pfannkuch was omitted. The minutes of the Nationalversammlung for 6 February 1919 reveal that Pfannkuch indeed chaired the Nationalversammlung on 6 February 1919 and partly on 7 February 1919 as Alterspräsident (president by age). Thus in his capacity as head of the national constituent assembly, he briefly exercised the functions of head of state. The study of national leadership chronologies may be enriched by attaching theoretical analysis of patterns found in political developments of different countries. Provisional governments, temporary substitutions of office holders, term definitions, authentic position titles, regencies – these topics form only a part of theoretical issues. The works not focused on the institutional chronology tend to use colloquial terms and definitions, which partially distort the historical retrospective. Currently, most works on chronology of rulers and high state officials require extensive improvement as they appear as skeletons of names and dates, to which no flesh of facts is attached. A reader may find himself confused with thousands of unexplained dates and names, while different works continue to contradict each other, adding to the reader's confusion. The nations whose histories feature a rich variety of constitutional and unconstitutional changes of rulers are presented in the reference books in an impoverished form, because their institutional histories are not properly studied. It would not be a surprise to fail in finding the complete membership of a Nicaraguan governing junta in the mid-19th century, but we still lack definite works on many European governments. A great number of stand-ins and short-lived political bodies await inclusion in the works on institutional chronology. All these omissions might be done away with only if we applied a more thorough approach to these studies. Theoretical principles of institutional chronology are still far from being clearly formulated. A researcher puzzled with two or more conflicting dates needs a definite guidance on what event makes the date valid from the viewpoint of institutional chronology or needs an alternative date backed by facts. A simple question as to when an office holder legally took possession of his or her office may raise a number of tough questions. A very interesting instance of this issue is the case of the Executive Directory of the French Republic in 1795 - 1799. Various works on the history of the Executive Directory give rather contradicting answers to a question as to when a directory's member formally took his office. A detailed study showed that at least three different approaches might be applied to the precise determination of their terms of office. Out of 13 directors, the initial four members officially entered into exercising their duties upon constituting the Directory as an executive body, seven – upon their election, and two – on the dates fixed in a special law. Despite the fact that numerous works on the history of France in the 18th century have been published and continue being published, these difficulties remain largely unknown. As a result, one finds conflicting and confusing appearances of the respective dates in reference works. A significant portion of sources for studying the institutional chronology consists of the archives of actual legislation. The collections of documents issued for the purpose of governing by the heads of states and governments, ministers, military leaders and others contain valuable information for studying authentic definitions used by the office holders, their self-styles and official parlance in general. Slightest changes in styles, frequently ignored in the works on general history, might be restored only by careful examination of heritage accumulated by the national governments. For instance, it is known that the colloquial use of the term tsar for the All-Russian Emperor in 1721–1917 is strictly incorrect, because in this period the term tsar was used in the sense of monarch only for subsidiary (and partially imaginary) polities (with the exception of Poland, at least from 1815 to 1830). The lack of proper definition for a ruler's style results in a distorted view of political development. The answers are often to be found exclusively in the study of legal documents. Disciplinary aims and objectives Besides purely academic interest, institutional chronology has a true practical meaning. It is used in many disciplines and can be utilized for different purposes. Definite and proven information on the terms of offices may be successfully used for dating the documents. The advantages of proven chronologies of office holders appear when reasonable defined terms of offices narrow the area of research. The right of signature pertinent to office holders and the dates of holding the office help determine the dates of issuing a document if such date was not found in original copy. The principle of using the rulers' names for year counting is known for many nations including ancient Rome and Greece, imperial China and Japan. The regnal years have an essential role for chronology of England and other European countries. Thus, only a neatly composed chronology of rulers may serve as a good basis for researchers. The ultimate goals of institutional chronology cannot be achieved only by removing discrepancies and filling the gaps in the lists of rulers. As a matter of fact, these gaps cannot be reconciled unless some universal definitions and terms are accepted by researchers. The criteria for selection of persons to be included in archontological studies, the criteria for selection and verification of terms and dates, the ways of identification of rulers and office holders are still to be defined. Current approaches should go through reconsideration for further improvement and sophistication. To become an independent academic discipline, archontology should focus on elaborating new standards and terminology for classification of rulers and officials. The existing chronologies, based on well established facts, may serve as a basis for archontological studies, but it should be extended, restructured and supplemented with theoretical information including historical, political and juridical aspects for changes in the forms of government and governmental succession. It is not necessarily that the studies should focus on the succession of office holders. The research on authentic titles, mechanisms for succession, classification of legal information, inauguration ceremonies and others may form an organic part of archontology. While a universal improvement of records for all nations and ages could hardly be expected in the nearest future, the study of institutional chronologies for particular countries and supranational unions should be encouraged through sophistication of methods and approaches. The appearance of enriched, verified and documented chronologies recorded with the appropriate technical terminology would signify a real improvement in the development of this field of study and would help the general regeneration of archontology.

PAG is also the primary control center for descending pain modulation. It has enkephalin-producing cells that suppress pain. The periaqueductal gray is the gray matter located around the cerebral aqueduct within the tegmentum of the midbrain. It projects to the nucleus raphe magnus, and also contains descending autonomic tracts. The ascending pain and temperature fibers of the spinothalamic tract send information to the PAG via the spinomesencephalic tract (so-named because the fibers originate in the spine and terminate in the PAG, in the mesencephalon or midbrain). This region has been used as the target for brain-stimulating implants in patients with chronic pain. Role in analgesia Stimulation of the periaqueductal gray matter of the midbrain activates enkephalin-releasing neurons that project to the raphe nuclei in the brainstem. 5-HT (serotonin) released from the raphe nuclei descends to the dorsal horn of the spinal cord where it forms excitatory connections with the \\"inhibitory interneurons\\" located in Laminae II (aka the substantia gelatinosa). When activated, these interneurons release either enkephalin or dynorphin (endogenous opioid neurotransmitters), which bind to mu and kappa opioid receptors on the axons of incoming C and A-delta fibers carrying pain signals from nociceptors activated in the periphery. The activation of the mu-opioid receptor inhibits the release of substance P from these incoming first-order neurons and, in turn, inhibits the activation of the second-order neuron that is responsible for transmitting the pain signal up the spinothalamic tract to the ventroposteriolateral nucleus (VPL) of the thalamus. The nociceptive signal was inhibited before it was able to reach the cortical areas that interpret the signal as \\"pain\\" (such as the anterior cingulate). This is sometimes referred to as the Gate control theory of pain and is supported by the fact that electrical stimulation of the PAG results in immediate and profound analgesia. The periaqueductal gray is also activated by viewing distressing images associated with pain. Three known kinds of opioid receptors have been identified: mu (μ), kappa (κ) and delta (δ). Synthetic opioid and opioid- derivative drugs activate these receptors (possibly by acting on the PAG directly, where these receptors are densely expressed) to produce analgesia. These drugs include morphine, heroin (diacetylmorphine), pethidine, hydrocodone, oxycodone, and similar pain-reducing compounds. Role in defensive behavior Dorsal PAG neurons are activated during various defensive behaviors. Stimulation of the dorsal and lateral aspects of the PAG can provoke defensive responses characterised by freezing immobility, running, jumping, tachycardia, and increases in blood pressure and muscle tonus. In contrast, stimulation of the caudal ventrolateral PAG can result in an immobile, relaxed posture known as quiescence, whereas its inhibition leads to increased locomotor activity. Lesions of the caudal ventrolateral PAG can greatly reduce conditioned freezing, whereas lesions of the dorsal aspect can reduce innate defensive behavior, virtually \\"taming\\" the animal. Role in reproductive behavior Neurons of the PAG are excited by endorphins and by opiate analgesics. It also plays a role in female copulatory behavior (see lordosis behavior) via a pathway from the ventromedial nucleus of the hypothalamus. Role in maternal behavior The PAG may be specifically involved in human maternal behavior. The PAG contains a high density of vasopressin and oxytocin receptors, and it has direct connections with the orbitofrontal cortex, which might mediate the role of the PAG in maternal love. The lateral orbitofrontal cortex is activated by pleasant visual, tactile, and olfactory stimuli. Its response depends on pleasantness rather than on intensity of stimulation. Here, its activity is likely to reflect one aspect of the pleasant emotions associated with motherly love.

The new law became effective July 1, 1820 and required full payment at the time of purchase and registration. But to encourage more sales and make them more affordable, Congress also reduced both the minimum price (from $2.00 to $1.25 per acre ($495 to $309/km²)) and the minimum size of a standard tract (from 160 to 80 acres (647,000 to 324,000 m²)). The minimum full payment now amounted to $100, rather than $320.Land Act of 1820 Ohio History Central, At the time, these lands were located on the frontier within the Congress Lands of Ohio and elsewhere in the Northwest Territory and Missouri Territory, in what was then \\"The West\\". With the high cost of transporting their produce and lack of internal improvements, the law was considered necessary because many farmers were having trouble paying off loans due to the additional economic hardships brought by the Panic of 1819. The previous Land Act of 1804 still included a minimum purchase (160 acres) too large for many individuals, and the price that was established by the Land Act of 1785. This was too expensive for the average family moving west. Squatters too were breaking the laws by trying to get land more cheaply; this was accomplished by moving onto the land before it was acquired by the government and put up for auction. Congress did not like these encroachments on Indian Treaties and had to do something about it. The act was instrumental in ushering in a new age of Western influence. The low price made it possible for settlers to move to the West, thus increasing the population in the west, and with it, Congressional states. Although the Land Act of 1820 was good for the average American it was also good for the wealthy investors, who had sufficient money to buy the lower cost land. Although the Land Act helped create a new age of Western growth and influence, it also increased the confiscation of land from Native Americans. For earlier buyers of public lands however, and although helped by the eight-year credit extension, more than time was required to alleviate their situation. On February 16, 1821, the Relief Act of 1821 was passed to adjust debt repayment schedules for people who had bought public land prior to the Land Act of 1820, when the federal government changed its method of selling public lands.Cynthia Clark Northrup, Ed.

The amendment was submitted in the U.S. House of Representatives on February 13, 1819, by James Tallmadge, Jr., a Democratic-Republican from New York, and Charles Baumgardner. The measure passed the House 87-76, with Northern representatives voting 86-10 in its favor and Southern representatives voting 66-1 against. However, the measure failed in the Senate due to a unified Southern opposition joined by five senators from northern states: Harrison G. Otis of Massachusetts, Ninian Edwards and Jesse B. Thomas of Illinois, and two others. In 1820, the Missouri Compromise was passed, which did not include the Tallmadge Amendment but attempted to appease both sides of the debate by admitting Missouri as a slave state in exchange for the admission of Maine as a free state and the complete prohibition of slavery in all of the remaining Louisiana Purchase territory north of the 36˚30' parallel, except in Missouri. Background In response to the ongoing debate in Congress concerning the admission of Missouri as a state and its effect on the existing balance of slave and free states, Tallmadge, an opponent of slavery, sought to impose conditions on Missouri's statehood that would provide for the eventual termination of legal slavery and the emancipation of current slaves: There were two Senators from each state regardless of the population of the state. The number of seats in the House of Representatives, however, was based on the population of the state, and to further complicate matters, slave states were allowed to count three-fifths of their slave population to increase their number of representatives. The population of the North had grown more rapidly than that of the South, and the South also had a large percentage of slaves, which resulted in a lower countable populace. Thus, the proposed Tallmadge Amendment was seen as a way to further restrict the weight of the slaveholding South in Congress. Tallmadge delivered an impassioned speech on February 16 in support of his amendment and of abolitionism in general. By a close vote on the same day, the House of Representatives adopted the Tallmadge Amendment, but it was promptly rejected by the Senate. Congress adjourned on March 4, 1819 without acting on Missouri's request for statehood. Heated discussions regarding the Tallmadge Amendment and Missouri statehood continued through the summer and autumn. Southern delegates to Congress upheld that the Tallmadge Amendment was unconstitutional because it put restrictions on states as a condition of admission to the Union. They argued that it was the decision of the people of Missouri, not Congress, if slavery should be legalized within the borders of the proposed state. The proponents of the Tallmadge Amendment argued that \\"slavery itself was a moral and political evil that was contrary to the spirit of the Declaration of Independence, and that it had been tolerated in the Constitution only by necessity and ought to now be restricted:\\" See also *History of slavery in Missouri References Category:Pre-statehood history of Missouri Category:History of United States expansionism Category:Legal history of the United States Category:United States federal territory and statehood legislation Category:Presidency of James Monroe Category:16th United States Congress ","title":"Tallmadge Amendment"},{"id":"1484491","text":"Gintaras Didžiokas (born 10 August 1966, Vilnius) is a Lithuanian politician and Member of the European Parliament for the Peasants and New Democratic Party Union; part of the Union for a Europe of Nations.

An individual can travel anywhere while still feeling comfortable because of the connectivity of their mobile device. The connection creates a sense of familiarity which results in the individual's identity becoming attached to their mobile service provider. This concept leads to the idea that \\"home\\" need not be a domestic structure featuring walls and a roof, but that the mobile sense of connection provides a portable community similar to a home environment. History of the concept The term was first used by Raymond Williams in his 1974 book Television: Technology and Cultural Form (Routledge, 3rd ed., 2003, ). Williams described the main contradiction in modern society as the one between mobility and home-centered living. He considered that television can negotiate that contradiction by providing users privacy to view the world. Paul du Gay, of the Copenhagen Business School, developed this theory in 2001. His main perspective was that home, for Williams, is a shrunken social space where isolated individuals gain vicariously increased mobility. Accordingly, he introduced the concept of “mobile privatised social relations”. Henrikson applied the concept of Technological Determinism to conclude that “Technologies can be designed, consciously or unconsciously, to open certain social options and close others”. In 2005, Kenichi Fujimoto, Professor of Informatics and Mediology at Mukogawa Women's University, came up with a theory called \\"Nagara Mobilism\\". Nagara means people have the ability to handle different process like text video and sound at the same time. He reaffirmed the contradiction between the physical and virtual home, and explained that increased privacy of public space can make the contradiction stronger. In 2007, the term Glocalization was introduced. It means that when individuals utilize mobile technology, their social networks expand while making themselves much closer to the local community. Hans Geser, a professor at the University of Zürich, has isolated four main features of mobile technology that weaken societal development: *By increasing the pervasiveness of primary, particularistic social bonds. *By reducing the need for time based scheduling and coordination. *By undermining institutional controls and replacing location-based communication systems with person-based. *By providing support for anachronistic “pervasive roles”.

Bidwell, 182 U.S. 244 (1901), was a case in which the US Supreme Court decided whether US territories were subject to the provisions and protections of the US Constitution. The issue is sometimes stated as whether the Constitution follows the flag. The decision narrowly held that the Constitution does not necessarily apply to territories. Instead, the US Congress has jurisdiction to create law within territories in certain circumstances, particularly those dealing with revenue, which would not be allowed by the Constitution for US states. It has become known as one of the \\"Insular Cases.\\" Background The case specifically concerned a merchant, Samuel Downes, who owned S. B. Downes & Company. His company had imported oranges into the Port of New York from the newly-acquired territory of Puerto Rico and had been forced to pay import duties on them. He sued George R. Bidwell, the US customs inspector for the port of New York. The Supreme Court in DeLima v. Bidwell had decided that ever since Puerto Rico had been acquired by the United States from Spain in the Treaty of Paris (1898), normal customs levied on imports from foreign countries did not apply to imports from Puerto Rico since it had ceased to be a foreign country.. However, the Foraker Act now levied customs specifically on imports from Puerto Rico. Downes disputed its constitutionality on the grounds that such duties were under the jurisdiction of Article I, Section 8, of the US Constitution, which provides that \\"all duties, imposts, and excises shall be uniform throughout the United States.\\" Since the duty on oranges did not exist for other parts of the United States, he argued that it should not exist for Puerto Rico. Decision The Supreme Court decided 5–4 that the newly-annexed territories were not properly part of the United States for purposes of the Constitution in the matter of revenues, administrative matters, and the like. However, the court was careful to note that the constitutional guarantees of a citizen's rights of liberty and property were applicable to all and \\"cannot be under any circumstances transcended,\\" according to Justice Edward Douglass White's concurring opinion.Downes, 182 U.S. at 294–95 (White, J., concurring.) Territories were due the full protections of the Constitution only when Congress had incorporated them as an \\"integral part\\" of the United States. The dissenting opinion was written by Justice John Marshall Harlan, who held that Congress was always bound to enact laws within the jurisdiction of the Constitution: \\"This nation is under the control of a written constitution, the supreme law of the land and the only source of the powers which our government, or any branch or officer of it, may exert at any time or at any place.\\" He held that the Congress had no existence and thus had no authority outside the Constitution. He continued: > The idea prevails with some, indeed it has expression in arguments at the > bar, that we have in this country substantially two national governments; > one to be maintained under the Constitution, with all its restrictions; the > other to be maintained by Congress outside and independently of that > instrument, by exercising such powers as other nations of the earth are > accustomed to.... I take leave to say that, if the principles thus announced > should ever receive the sanction of a majority of this court, a radical and > mischievous change in our system will result. We will, in that event, pass > from the era of constitutional liberty guarded and protected by a written > constitution into an era of legislative absolutism.... It will be an evil > day for American Liberty if the theory of a government outside the Supreme > Law of the Land finds lodgment in our Constitutional Jurisprudence. No > higher duty rests upon this court than to exert its full authority to > prevent all violation of the principles of the Constitution.Downes, 182 U.S. > at 380–382 (Harlan, J., dissenting). Aftermath The idea of territorial incorporation is generally agreed to have arisen from Justice White's concurring decision noted above. \\"Incorporation,\\" in this sense, does not refer to the legal process whereby a company takes on certain of the characteristics of a person (see incorporation). The concept of \\"territorial incorporation\\" is that the United States can be proprietor of a territory without having actually incorporated that territory into the United States. Unincorporated territories are not due the full benefits of the US Constitution, as noted from Justice White's decision above. The idea has been used in court cases ever since to affirm that the citizens of certain territories can be subject to laws and regulations that are not constitutionally applicable to other citizens of the United States. Many citizens of territories that have been designated unincorporated have seen the principle of territorial incorporation as a form of oppression.See, e.g., .

They also were famous by bring elements of funk into their hardcore punk style. History=Formation Based in Austin, Texas, United States, the band members were Randy \\"Biscuit\\" Turner on vocals, Tim Kerr on guitar and Chris Gates on bass. The key members of the band were childhood friends for a decade before the band was started.Al Kowalewski and Holly Duval Cornell, \\"Big Boys,\\" Flipside, whole no 32 (August 1982), pg. 12. Over the years the group played with five drummers in all; Steve Collier, Greg Murray, Fred Schultz, Rey Washam and Kevin Tubb who played only one show (the band's first) because Collier was sick. The hardcore punk style, a development from the earlier punk sound, arose spontaneously in various cities, but in Austin it was represented by MDC, Big Boys, The Huns, The Skunks and The Dicks. The bands often played together; Big Boys and The Dicks jointly released a split single and an LP, Live At Raul's. Big Boys shows were legendary, frequently involving food fights, with \\"Biscuit\\" frequently sporting a pink ballerina's tutu and pink cowboy boots. Invitations would be made to the audience to come up and sing along, which often occurred. At the end of early shows, the band was famous for yelling, \\"OK y'all, go start your own band.\\" Queried about his sexuality by Flipside magazine in 1982, \\"Biscuit\\" Turner replied: > \\"I don't know if I want to answer that or not because it doesn't make any > difference if I'm gay or not, I'm a human being and my sexual preference > doesn't play into my lifestyle. It comes from my heart and I want people to > look at me and say I'm a human being — don't ask me about what 5% of my life > is.\\" Musical importance Big Boys are credited as well with the introduction of funk rhythms to hardcore punk, producing funk metal, an innovation influential on later bands such as Red Hot Chili Peppers, who actually opened up for the Big Boys in Hollywood, leading to Red Hot Chili Peppers being referred to as \\"The Little Big Boys\\". This credit is due in no small part to the addition of a horn section, The Impromptu Horns, spearheaded by Chris Gates' brother, Nathan. The Impromptu Horns played mainly local shows, and played on some of the funkiest tracks recorded by Big Boys. Horn players included Nathan Gates, David Kitto and Tim Kopra on trombones; Brent Fawns and David Griffy on trumpets. They were also one of the first bands involved in the skatepunk scene, appearing in Thrasher skateboarding magazine and on Thrasher's Skate Rock compilation records, and had their own Big Boys skateboard designed by Pushead and produced by Zorlac Skateboards. After a Bad Brains show in Austin that ended in controversy involving Biscuit (and later inspired the songs \\"Brickwall\\" by Big Boys and \\"Pay to Come Along\\" by MDC), conflicts began to arise within the band, specifically between Biscuit and Chris. Big Boys played their last show very unexpectedly. Biscuit and Chris never spoke to each other again. Aftermath Tim Kerr went on to play with many bands, including Poison 13, Bad Mutha Goose, Monkeywrench, Jack O Fire, Lord High Fixers and, in 2004, The Total Sound Group Direct Action Committee. Chris Gates was also with Poison 13, Junkyard and Charter Bulldogs. Gates can currently be heard fronting Big Chris Gates and Gatesville, a southern-fried country group based in Austin. Horn player Tim Kopra became an astronaut and commander of the International Space Station. Drummer Rey Washam has played consistently with such groups as Jerryskids, Scratch Acid, Rapeman, and Ministry. Original drummer Steve Collier switched from drums to guitar and formed Doctors' Mob, whose first album was produced by Chris Gates, and later played in the Sidehackers and the Rite Flyers. Randy Turner performed with The Slurpees, Cargo Cult, and Swine King, the latter band contributing the song \\"All Broke Down\\" to Outpunk Records' compilation, Outpunk Dance Party. Randy Turner was found dead from Hepatitis C complications in his home on August 18, 2005. This was particularly odd simply because he was on the cover of that week's The Austin Chronicle. The Big Boys also appeared in the well-reviewed 2006 Sundance film, American Hardcore. Their song \\"Brickwall\\" appeared on the soundtrack. Big Boys were innovative in many ways and were influential in the direction music and music scenes would take in their wake.

Controversies Tyagi was briefly named in an Italian Investigation into bribes paid to secure a Helicopter Contract, although further information created doubts in the matter. As per the unverified testimony of an Italian businessman, he received illegal payments to change the technical specifications of the helicopters which favored AgustaWestland which was finally awarded the deal. However, further investigation showed that the technical specifications were changed prior to his tenure on the orders of Brajesh Mishra, the National Security Adviser, in the Prime Minister's office (PMO).

Frass refers loosely to the more or less solid excreta of insects, and to certain other related matter. Definition and etymology Frass is an informal term and accordingly it is variously used and variously defined. It is derived from the German word Fraß, which means the food takeup of an insect.M. Clark and O. Thyen. The Oxford-Duden German Dictionary. Publisher: Oxford University Press 1999. The English usage applies to excreted residues of anything that insects had eaten, and similarly, to other chewed or mined refuse that insects leave behind. It does not generally refer to fluids such as honeydew, but the point does not generally arise, and is largely ignored in this article. Such usage in English originated in the mid-nineteenth century at the latest. Modern technical English sources differ on the precise definition, though there is little actual direct contradiction on the practical realities. One glossary from the early twentieth century speaks of \\"...excrement; usually the excreted pellets of caterpillars.\\"Smith, John. B. Explanation of terms used in entomology. Pub: Brooklyn Entomological Society 1906. May be downloaded from: In some contexts frass refers primarily to fine, masticated material, often powdery, that phytophagous insects pass as indigestible waste after they have processed plant tissues as completely as their physiology would permit.Allaby (2004) Other common examples of how frass types may differ, include the fecal material that insects such as the larvae of codling moths leave as they feed inside fruit or seed, or that the likes of Terastia meticulosalis leave as they bore in the pith of Erythrina twigs. Various forms of frass may result from the nature of the food and the digestive systems of the species of insect that excreted the material. For example, many caterpillars, especially large, leaf-eating caterpillars in families such as Saturniidae, produce quite elaborately moulded pellets that may be conspicuous on the ground beneath plants in which they feed. In the tunnels they eat in the leaves on which they feed, leaf miners commonly leave visible amorphous frass residues of the pulp of the mesophyll. Their frass commonly does not fill the tunnel. In contrast larvae of most powder post beetles partly eject their finely granular frass from their tunnels when boring in the wood on which they feed, while the larvae of most dry-wood Cerambycidae leave their frass packed tightly into the tunnels behind them. Many other species of wood borers also leave the tunnels behind them tightly packed with dry frass, which may be either finely powdery or coarsely sawdusty. Possibly this is partly as a defence against other borer larvae, many species of which are cannibalistic, or it might serve to reduce attacks from some kinds of predatory mites or soak up fluids that a live tree might secrete into the tunnel. Loose, fibrous frass of some moths in the family Cossidae, such as Coryphodema tristis, may be seen protruding from the mouths of their tunnels in tree trunks, especially shortly before they emerge as adult moths. In this respect their frass differs from the powdery frass of powder post beetles such as Lyctus. Borer tunnels may occur either in dry or rotting wood or under bark, in the comparatively soft, nutritious bast tissue, either dead or living. Yet another effect arises when the boring insect does not digest the wood or other medium itself, but bores tunnels in which yeasts or other fungi grow, possibly stimulated by excretions and secretions of the insects. Such tunnels obviously cannot be permitted to become clogged, or the insects could not access their own pastures, so they either must eject at least part of their frass, or otherwise leave room for the edible growth. Examples of such boring-insect/fungal associations include Ambrosia beetles with Ambrosia fungi, Sirex woodwasp with its fungal partner Amylostereum areolatum, and more. In a significantly different sense the term \\"frass\\" also may refer to excavated wood shavings that carpenter ants, carpenter bees and other insects with similar wood-boring habits eject from their galleries during the tunneling process. Such material differs from the frass residues of foods, because insects that tunnel to construct such nests do not eat the wood, so the material that they discard as they tunnel has not passed through their gut.Catseye Pest Control http://www.catseyepest.com In concept the difference is categorical, but even professional entomologists might need suitable instruments and detailed examination to distinguish the categories. Ecological considerations Contact with frass causes plants to secrete chitinase in response to its high chitin levels. Frass is a natural bloom stimulant, and has high nutrient levels. Frass contains abundant amoebae, beneficial bacteria, and fungi. Accordingly, it is a microbial inoculant, in particular a soil inoculant, a source of desirable microbes, that promotes the formation of compost.

M. Whelan, M. J. Hodgeson, 2nd Edition, 1978, John Murray, The term is generally meaningful only for fields that, at each point, vary sinusoidally in time with a single temporal frequency (otherwise the phase is not well defined). Wavefronts usually move with time. For waves propagating in an unidimensional medium, the wavefronts are usually single points; they are curves in a two dimensional medium, and surfaces in a three-dimensional one. The wavefronts of a plane wave are planes. Wavefronts change shape after going through a lens. For a sinusoidal plane wave, the wavefronts are planes perpendicular to the direction of propagation, that move in that direction together with the wave. For a sinusoidal spherical wave, the wavefronts are spherical surfaces that expand with it. If the speed of propagation is different at different points of a wavefront, the shape and/or orientation of the wavefronts may change by refraction. In particular, lenses can change the shape of optical wavefronts from planar to spherical, or vice versa. Simple wavefronts and propagation Optical systems can be described with Maxwell's equations, and linear propagating waves such as sound or electron beams have similar wave equations. However, given the above simplifications, Huygens' principle provides a quick method to predict the propagation of a wavefront through, for example, free space. The construction is as follows: Let every point on the wavefront be considered a new point source. By calculating the total effect from every point source, the resulting field at new points can be computed. Computational algorithms are often based on this approach. Specific cases for simple wavefronts can be computed directly. For example, a spherical wavefront will remain spherical as the energy of the wave is carried away equally in all directions. Such directions of energy flow, which are always perpendicular to the wavefront, are called rays creating multiple wavefronts.University Physics – With Modern Physics (12th Edition), H. D. Young, R. A. Freedman (Original edition), Addison-Wesley (Pearson International), 1st Edition: 1949, 12th Edition: 2008, , The simplest form of a wavefront is the plane wave, where the rays are parallel to one another. The light from this type of wave is referred to as collimated light. The plane wavefront is a good model for a surface-section of a very large spherical wavefront; for instance, sunlight strikes the earth with a spherical wavefront that has a radius of about 150 million kilometers (1 AU). For many purposes, such a wavefront can be considered planar over distances of the diameter of Earth. Wavefronts travel with the speed of light in all directions in an isotropic medium. Wavefront aberrations Methods utilizing wavefront measurements or predictions can be considered an advanced approach to lens optics, where a single focal distance may not exist due to lens thickness or imperfections. For manufacturing reasons, a perfect lens has a spherical (or toroidal) surface shape though, theoretically, the ideal surface would be aspheric. Shortcomings such as these in an optical system cause what are called optical aberrations. The best-known aberrations include spherical aberration and coma.Encyclopaedia of Physics (2nd Edition), R.G. Lerner, G.L. Trigg, VHC publishers, 1991, ISBN (Verlagsgesellschaft) 3-527-26954-1, ISBN (VHC Inc.) 0-89573-752-3 However there may be more complex sources of aberrations such as in a large telescope due to spatial variations in the index of refraction of the atmosphere. The deviation of a wavefront in an optical system from a desired perfect planar wavefront is called the wavefront aberration. Wavefront aberrations are usually described as either a sampled image or a collection of two-dimensional polynomial terms. Minimization of these aberrations is considered desirable for many applications in optical systems. Wavefront sensor and reconstruction techniques A wavefront sensor is a device which measures the wavefront aberration in a coherent signal to describe the optical quality or lack thereof in an optical system. A very common method is to use a Shack–Hartmann lenslet array. There are many applications that include adaptive optics, optical metrology and even the measurement of the aberrations in the eye itself. In this approach, a weak laser source is directed into the eye and the reflection off the retina is sampled and processed. Alternative wavefront sensing techniques to the Shack–Hartmann system are emerging. Mathematical techniques like phase imaging or curvature sensing are also capable of providing wavefront estimations. These algorithms compute wavefront images from conventional brightfield images at different focal planes without the need for specialised wavefront optics. While Shack-Hartmann lenslet arrays are limited in lateral resolution to the size of the lenslet array, techniques such as these are only limited by the resolution of digital images used to compute the wavefront measurements. That said, those wavefront sensors are suffering from linearity issues and so are much less robust than the original SHWFS, in term of phase measurement. Another application of software reconstruction of the phase is the control of telescopes through the use of adaptive optics. A common method is the Roddier test, also called wavefront curvature sensing. It yields good correction, but needs an already good system as a starting point. Indeed because of those linearity issues described above. That's why people are coupling different types of WFS in those next Gen adaptive optics systems.

She identifies as a queer feminist. Early years and education Alix Olson's parents were both politically minded professors, ideals she believed were passed along to her, as she recalls some of her earliest memories involving sitting under a table coloring protest signs. Olson attended Stockholm University in 1996, received a B.A. from Wesleyan University in 2007 and received her PhD in Political Science from the University of Massachusetts at Amherst, with a Graduate Certificate in Advanced Feminist Studies. Career Olson taught as Faculty at the Juniper Institute for Young Writers at University of Massachusetts at Amherst in Summer 2011 and 2012, Faculty at CSU Summer Arts, California State University, Fresno, CA and at the Eleanor Roosevelt Center at Val Kill's Young Women's Leadership. In 1997, Olson began performing at the Nuyorican Poets Cafe, where she quickly made the 1998 Nuyorican Poetry Slam team. She and her fellow Nuyorican team members Lynne Procope, Steve Colman and Guy LeCharles Gonzalez would go on to win the 1998 National Poetry Slam Championship in Austin, TX.Aptowicz, Cristin O'Keefe.

It was enacted before the introduction of broadcasting to the general public, and was eventually found to contain insufficient authority to effectively control this new service, so the Act was replaced and the government's regulatory powers increased by the passage of the Radio Act of 1927. Background Radio communication (originally known as \\"wireless telegraphy\\") was developed in the late 1890s, but it was initially largely unregulated in the United States. The Wireless Ship Act of 1910 mandated that most passenger ships exiting U.S. ports had to carry radio equipment under the supervision of qualified operators, however individual stations remained unlicensed and unregulated. This led to numerous interference issues, including conflicts between amateur radio operators and the U.S. Navy and commercial companies, with a few amateur radio enthusiasts alleged to have sent fake distress calls and obscene messages to naval radio stations, and to have forged naval commands, sending navy boats on spurious missions. The U.S. policy of unrestricted stations differed from most of the rest of the world. The 1906 International Radiotelegraph Convention, held in Berlin, called for countries to license their stations, and although United States representatives had signed this agreement, initially the U.S. Senate did not ratify the treaty. However, the U.S. was told it would not be invited to the next International Radiotelegraph Convention scheduled to be held in London in June 1912 unless it completed ratification, so on April 3, 1912, the U.S. Senate formally accepted the 1906 Convention, and began work on legislation to implement its provisions. The issue gained importance twelve days later due to the sinking of the Titanic, and the new law would also incorporate provisions of the London Convention signed on July 5, 1912, although the United States had not yet ratified the new treaty. The resulting Radio Act of 1912 was signed by President Taft on August 13, 1912, and went into effect December 13, 1912.\\"The Achievement of Federal Radio Regulation\\", History of Communications-electronics in the United States by Linwood S. Howeth, pages 162-164. Implementation At this time radio was almost exclusively used for point-to-point communication, and the three major categories of stations were maritime, transoceanic, and amateur. The Act was unusual in including numerous regulations within the text of the bill, in addition to providing a general regulatory framework. A key provision was the restriction of most amateur stations to wavelengths below 200 meters (frequencies above 1500 kHz), an assignment that greatly limited their transmitting range until the discovery a decade later of the great distances achievable through shortwave transmissions. Implementation and enforcement of the Act was made the responsibility of the U.S. Department of Commerce and Labor (Department of Commerce after March 1913), which was empowered to impose fines of not more than $500 and to suspend or revoke licenses of operators who violated regulations. Nine regional Radio Inspection districts were designated, with a radio inspector based in a major port within each district. The broadcasting of news and entertainment to the general public, which began to be significantly developed in early 1920s, was not foreseen by this legislation.\\"An Act to regulate radio communication\\", approved August 13, 1912. The first regulations specifically addressing broadcasting were adopted on December 1, 1921, when two wavelengths were set aside for stations making broadcasts intended for a general audience: 360 meters (833 kHz) for \\"entertainment\\", and 485 meters (619 kHz) for \\"market and weather reports\\".\\"Amendments to Regulations\\", Radio Service Bulletin, January 3, 1922, page 10. The number of broadcasting stations grew tremendously in 1922, numbering over 500 in the United States by the end of the year. Herbert Hoover became the Secretary of Commerce in March 1921, and thus assumed primary responsibility for shaping radio broadcasting during its earliest days, which was a difficult task in an fast-changing environment. To aid decision-making, he sponsored a series of four national conferences from 1922 to 1925, where invited industry leaders participated in setting standards for radio in general. Legal challenges and replacement In 1926, station WJAZ successfully challenged the government's authority to assign transmitting frequencies under the Radio Act of 1912.WJAZ \\"wave pirates\\" publicity photograph, Popular Radio, May 1926, page 90. During his tenure, Hoover was aware that some of his actions were on shaky legal ground, given the limited powers assigned to him by the 1912 Act. In particular, in 1921 the department had tried to refuse to issue a renewal license to a point-to-point radiotelegraph station in New York City, operated by the Intercity Radio Company, on the grounds that it was causing excessive interference to earlier radiotelegraph stations operating nearby. Intercity appealed, and in 1923 the Court of Appeals of the District of Columbia sided with Intercity, stating the 1912 Act did not provide for licensing decisions at \\"the discretion of an executive officer\\". The Department of Commerce planned to request a review by the Supreme Court, but the case was rendered moot when Intercity decided to shut down the New York City station. Still, it had raised significant questions about the extent of Hoover's authority.Intercity Radio Company case, The Law of Radio Communication by Stephen Davis, 1927, page 37. A second, ultimately successful, challenge occurred in 1926. The Zenith Radio Corporation in late 1925 established a high-powered radio station in Chicago, WJAZ. Due to a lack of available frequencies, the station was only authorized to transmit two hours each week. Based on the Intercity Radio Company ruling, company president E. F. McDonald decided to challenge the government by moving the station to a frequency previously reserved for use in Canada.The Beginning of Broadcast Regulation in the Twentieth Century by Marvin R. Bensman, 2000, pages 159-160. On April 16, 1926, Judge James H. Wilkerson's ruling stated that, under the 1912 Act, the Commerce Department in fact could not limit the number of broadcasting licenses issued, or designate station frequencies. The government reviewed whether to try to appeal this decision, but Acting Attorney General William J. Donovan's analysis concurred with the court's decision. \\"Federal Regulation of Radio Broadcasting\\" (July 8, 1926) by Acting Attorney General William J. Donovan, Official Opinions of the Attorneys General of the United States, Volume 35, 1929, pages 126-132. The adverse ruling showcased the deficiencies of the 1912 Act. Thus, on February 23, 1927, a replacement, the Radio Act of 1927, was signed into law by President Calvin Coolidge in order to strengthen the government's ability to effectively regulate radio communication.

The terms used may be derived from such sources as compass directions, altitude directions, or other directions. However, the railroad directions frequently vary from the actual directions, so that, for example, a \\"northbound\\" train may really be headed west over some segments of its trip, or a train going \\"down\\" may actually be increasing its elevation. Railroad directions are often specific to system, country, or region. Radial directions Many rail systems use the concept of a center (usually a major city) to define rail directions. Up and down In British practice, railway directions are usually described as \\"up\\" and \\"down\\", with \\"up\\" being towards a major location. This convention is applied not only to the trains and the tracks, but also to items of lineside equipment and to areas near a track. Since British trains run on the left, the \\"up\\" side of a line is on the left when proceeding in the \\"up\\" direction. On most of the network, \\"up\\" is the direction towards London. In most of Scotland, with the exception of the West and East Coast Main Lines , and the Borders Railway, \\"up\\" is towards Edinburgh. The Valley Lines network around Cardiff has its own peculiar usage, relating to the literal meaning of traveling \\"up\\" and \\"down\\" the valley. On the former Midland Railway \\"up\\" was towards Derby. On the Northern Ireland Railways network, \\"up\\" generally means toward Belfast (the specific zero milepost varying from line to line); except for cross-border services to Dublin, where Belfast is \\"down\\". Mileposts normally increase in the \\"down\\" direction, but there are exceptions, such as the Trowbridge line between Bathampton Junction and Hawkeridge Junction, where mileage increases in the \\"up\\" direction. Individual tracks will have their own names, such as Up Main or Down Loop. Trains running towards London are normally referred to as \\"up\\" trains, and those away from London as \\"down\\". Hence the down Night Riviera runs to and the up Flying Scotsman to London King's Cross. This distinction is less meaningful for trains not travelling towards or away from London; for instance a CrossCountry train from to uses \\"up\\" lines as far as and \\"down\\" lines thereafter. In China, railway directions with terminus in Beijing are described as \\"up\\" (, shàngxíng) and \\"down\\" (, xiàxíng), with up towards Beijing; trains leaving Beijing are \\"down\\", while those going toward Beijing are \\"up\\". Trains run through Beijing may have two or more numbers, for example, the train from Harbin to Shanghai K58/55 uses two different numbers: on the Harbin–Tianjin section, the train runs toward Beijing, the train is known as K58, but on the Tianjin–Shanghai section, the train is known as K55; the opposite train from Shanghai to Harbin is known as K56/57, while K56 is used from Shanghai to Tianjin and K57 is used from Tianjin to Harbin.Train numbers Generally even numbers denote trains heading towards Beijing while odd numbers are those heading away from the capital. In Japan, railway directions are referred to as and , and these terms are widely employed in timetablesJR Timetable, March 2012 issue and station announcements for the travelling public. For JR Group trains, trains going towards the capital Tokyo are \\"up\\" trains, while those going away from the capital are \\"down\\" trains. For private railway operators, the designation of \\"up\\" or \\"down\\" (if at all) usually relies on where the company is headquartered as \\"up\\". The railway systems of the Australian states have generally followed the practices of railways in the United Kingdom. Railway directions are usually described as \\"up\\" and \\"down\\", with \\"up\\" being towards the major location in most states, which is usually the capital city of the state. For example, in New South Wales, trains running away from Sydney are \\"down\\" trains, while in Victoria, trains running away from Melbourne are \\"down\\" trains. An interstate train travelling from Sydney to Melbourne is a \\"down\\" train until it crosses the state border at Albury, where it changes its classification to an \\"up\\" train. Even in states that follow this practice, exceptions exist for individual lines. In the state of Queensland, \\"up\\" and \\"down\\" directions are individually defined for each line. Therefore, a train heading towards the main railway station in Brisbane (Roma Street station) would be classified as an \\"up\\" train on some lines but as a \\"down\\" train on other lines. Inbound and outbound In many commuter rail and rapid transit services in the United States, the rail directions are related to the location of the city center. The term inbound is used for the direction leading in toward the city center and outbound is used for the opposite direction leading out of the city center. City name directions Some British rail directions commonly used are London and Country. The London end of a station is the end where trains to London depart. The country end is the opposite end, where trains to the country depart. This usage is problematic where more than one route to London exists (e.g. at Exeter St Davids, or Edinburgh Waverley). Even and odd In France, railway directions are usually described as Pair and Impair (meaning Even and Odd), corresponding to Up and Down in the British system. Pair means heading toward Paris, and Impair means heading away from Paris. This convention is applied not only to the trains and the tracks, but also to items of lineside equipment. Pair is also quasi-homophonic with Paris, so direction P is equivalent either with direction Pair or with direction Paris. A similar system is in use in Italy, where directions can be Pari or Dispari (Even and Odd respectively). Pari (Even) trains conventionally travel north- and west- bound. The city of Paris is referenced in colloquial use (Parigi in Italian), with Pari trains virtually leading towards it (Paris being in a north-western direction from any point in Italy). In Russia (and ex-USSR countries), the \\"even direction\\" is usually north- and eastbound, while the \\"odd direction\\" is south- and westbound. Trains traveling \\"even\\" and \\"odd\\" usually receive even and odd numbers, respectively. Circumferential directions In double track loop lines – such as those encircling a city – the tracks, trains and trackside equipment can be identified by their relative distance from the center of the loop. Inner refers to the track and its trains that are closer to the geographic center. Outer refers to the track and its trains that are furthermost from the geographic center. One example is the City Circle line in the Sydney Trains system. For circle routes, the directions may indicate clockwise or counterclockwise (anti-clockwise) bound trains. For example, on the Circle line of London Underground or the loop of the Central line, the directions are often referred to as \\"inner rail\\" (anti-clockwise) or \\"outer rail\\" (clockwise). The same practice is used for circle routes in Japan, such as the Yamanote Line in Tokyo and the Osaka Loop Line, where directions are usually referred to as and , in a system where trains go clockwise on the outer track and counter-clockwise on the inner track. Geographical directions=Cardinal directions Most railroads in the United States use nominal cardinal directions for the directions of their lines, which often differ from actual compass directions. These directions are often referred to as \\"railroad\\" north, south, east, or west, to avoid confusion with the compass directions. Typically an entire railroad system (the lines of a railroad or a related group of railroads) will describe all of its lines by only two directions, either east and west, or north and south. This greatly reduces the possibility of misunderstanding the direction in which a train is travelling as it traverses lines which may twist and turn or even reverse direction for a distance. These directions also have significance in resolving conflicts between trains running in opposite directions. For example, many railroads specify that trains of equal class running to the east are superior to those running west. This means that, if two trains are approaching a passing siding on a single-track line, the inferior westbound train must \\"take the siding\\" and wait there for the superior eastbound train to pass. In the United States, most railroads use \\"east and west\\", and it is unusual for a railroad to designate \\"north and south\\" (the New York City Subway, the Chicago \\"L\\", and the Washington Metro are rare examples). Even-numbered trains (superior) travel east (or north). Odd-numbered trains (inferior) travel west (or south). On the London Underground, geographic direction naming generally prevails (e.g. eastbound, westbound) except for the Circle line where it is Outer Rail and Inner Rail. Other names for north and south In New York City, the terms uptown and downtown are used in the subway to refer to northbound and southbound respectively. The nominal railroad direction is determined by how the line will travel when it enters Manhattan. In Hong Kong practice, the up track refers to northbound, and the down track refers to southbound. This old practice on the British Section of the Kowloon-Canton Railway, now called the East Rail, is followed on the West Rail. In other words, trains towards the city center of Kowloon is the \\"down\\" direction instead of the \\"up direction \\". \\"Northbound\\" and \\"southbound\\" are, nonetheless, more commonly used. On the original metro network of the MTR, platforms for the general direction towards the depot are numbered with odd numbers, whereas platforms for the opposite direction are numbered with even numbers. Depots are usually located on or near the end of MTR lines. Exceptions are stations that are located further than the depot, such as the stations of Ngau Tau Kok and Kwun Tong on the Kwun Tong Line. For railways in China that are not connected with Beijing, north and west are used as \\"up\\", and east and south as \\"down\\". Odd numbered train codes are used for \\"down\\" trains, while even numbers are used for \\"up\\"; for example, train T27 from Beijing west to Lhasa is \\"down\\" (going away from Beijing) since 27 is odd.

She was a longtime city councillor in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. She was first elected to Toronto City Council in 1972, and served until 1985 when she ran against incumbent Mayor Art Eggleton, but was defeated. In 1988 she was elected to Metro Toronto Council (in the first election where Metro Councillors were directly elected). She served until Toronto was amalgamated into the megacity in 1997. That year, she was elected to the new Toronto City Council and served until 2003, when she was defeated by Karen Stintz. At the time of her defeat, she was the longest-serving and the oldest member of Toronto council. Johnston was also a candidate for Mayor of Toronto in 1978, when she lost to Fred Beavis in a deadlocked council vote for David Crombie's interim replacement; that vote literally came down to Beavis' name being drawn out of a hat. She campaigned for the Legislative Assembly of Ontario in the 1981 provincial election as a member of the Ontario Liberal Party, and lost to Progressive Conservative incumbent Larry Grossman in St. Andrew—St. Patrick by 3,835 votes. Johnston attempted to unseat Art Eggleton as mayor in the 1985 municipal election but was defeated 92,994 votes to 59,817. She returned to elected office in the 1988 when she was acclaimed as Metro Councillor for North Toronto. In the late 1990s, Johnston's queries into the city's computer leasing deal led to the establishment of the MFP Inquiry which unearthed corrupt practices in the deal and reforms in the city's public accountability framework. For most of her career, Johnston was known as a progressive voice on council. In her final term she supported a controversial condominium development at the corner of Yonge and Eglinton in 2002 adjacent to her ward. The North Toronto Tenants Network was so incensed by Johnston's move that they ran an advertisement in a local community paper, seeking applicants to contest Johnston's council seat. Stintz responded, and defeated Johnston in the 2003 municipal election by 2,321 votes. Johnston chaired the Toronto Seniors' Assembly and has been appointed as the group's Seniors' Advocate.City of Toronto: Toronto history, Former City Councillor Anne Johnston - 2001-2003 The Anne Johnston Health Station in Toronto is named after her.

There is also a short portion in Connecticut with no junctions. The highway connects I-84 with I-287 and the Hutchinson River Parkway, primarily serving commuter traffic to and from the northern suburbs of the New York metropolitan area. Most of the route is in northern Westchester County. The route of the highway was originally designated as part of I-87 from 1968 to 1970. The first section of the roadway opened to traffic in October 1968, and the final segment was completed in December 1974. Route description=Cross-Westchester Expressway to Saw Mill River Parkway  Northward, I-684 begins as two separate spur routes. The primary spur, which is officially designated I-684, begins at the White Plains–Harrison line at exit 9A of the Cross-Westchester Expressway (I-287) in Westchester County, New York. The other, offiically designated as New York State Route 984J (NY 984J) but signed as I-684 in the northbound direction, begins in Harrison north of exit 26 on the Hutchinson River Parkway. NY 984J has one independent exit with Manhattanville Road, which serves Manhattanville College, before joining the spur to I-287. The spurs, I-287 and the Hutch surround an office park. From the junction of the two spurs, the Interstate Highway takes a straight course to the north-northwest through a wooded corridor with a golf course on the west and residences on the east. After the Barnes Lane overpass a mile and a half (2 km) north of the spurs, it veers to the north-northeast for a half- mile (1 km) before turning to the north alongside Rye Lake, part of Kensico Reservoir, one of many that provide water to New York City. It remains in an increasingly narrow strip of woods between the lake and Westchester County Airport into its first exit, Airport Road, 4.4 miles (7.1 km) from its southern terminus. NY 120 parallels the highway to the east. alt=Three signs along a busy freeway. The one at the bottom says \\"Entering Greenwich Connecticut\\". The one above it has \\"Litter Removal\\" on it. The last one, at the top, is irregularly shaped with the number 684 Just north of that exit, NY 120 crosses over the road. Immediately after this exit, I-684 crosses the Connecticut state line. Signage indicates this, but it retains its New York reference markers as it curves more to the northeast for the next through wooded and swampy country in the western corner of Greenwich. There is no exit in Connecticut. A mile after it re-enters New York, in the town of North Castle, it reaches its next exit, where NY 22 serves that community and the nearby hamlet of Armonk. The short section of I-684 in Connecticut is owned by the Connecticut Department of Transportation, but maintenance and repairs to the stretch are performed by the New York State Department of Transportation, with the cost of maintenance being reimbursed to New York by Connecticut. Past that exit, it bends even more to the northeast, continuing past houses, parks and golf courses located amidst dense woodlands. At Byram Lake Reservoir, it returns to a northward heading for a mile (1.6 km), crossing into the town of Bedford. The highway then curves northeasterly and then to the northwest once the reservoir is past. The Arthur W. Butler Memorial Sanctuary, a private nature preserve, replaces it on the east of the highway. Just south of the exit for NY 172, I-684 bends northwest again. Over the next two miles (3.2 km), the interstate curves gently back and forth, maintaining its generally northerly heading, as its median strip widens slightly. The surrounding lands start to include some more cleared lots, larger estates that were once small farms. At the northern end of this section a rest area serves southbound traffic. The highway passes Bedford Hills Correctional Facility, one of New York's two main women's prisons, a short distance to its west, and then bends northwest into the most extensive junction since its beginning: the northern terminus of the Saw Mill River Parkway.  Saw Mill River Parkway to Brewster  Diagram of interchanges 5 and 6. The Saw Mill merges from the southeast, its two roadways forming service roads flanking I-684 for the next mile as it passes a southern extension of Muscoot Reservoir just east of the hamlet of Katonah. Entry from the interstate to the parkway (and NY 117, which has its northern terminus at the parkway just below the interstate) is from the southbound lanes only. A half-mile (1 km) north of the merger the frontage roads merge into the interstate at the exit for NY 35, serving Katonah and the hamlet of Cross River to the east. After that exit the electrified tracks of Metro-North Railroad's Harlem Line parallel the highway to the west. They cross into the town of Lewisboro. A mile north of that point, NY 22 parallels on the east. A northbound-only exit leads onto it, allowing access to NY 138, which crosses the interstate at the hamlet of Golden's Bridge. Its train station is prominently visible on the west side of the highway. North of that station is the North Salem town line. NY 22 detours slightly eastward, away from the interstate, for a mile. When it returns, the roads and the railroad tracks bend strongly to the northeast, following the Croton River on their west. After a mile this brings them to I-684's next exit, at NY 116, again for only northbound traffic but with southbound entry. The Purdy's Metro-North station is also adjacent to the highway, but is screened from view by a line of trees. A quarter-mile (500 m) to the north, NY 22 crosses under to the opposite side. A short distance later, the Harlem Line veers northwest, followed quickly by NY 22, as the interstate veers northeast. The Hardscrabble Road exit serves both directions and, via NY 22, allows access to the nearby hamlet of Croton Falls. One mile past that junction, I-684 crosses into Putnam County and the town of Brewster. Within a thousand feet (300 m) of the county line, the Brewster rest area serves northbound traffic. Beyond, the highway turns slightly more to the east, then swings back to the north into its northern terminus at I-84. An almost-complete cloverleaf interchange guides traffic east to Danbury, Connecticut or west towards Newburgh. Traffic continuing north remains on a limited-access route, designated but not signed as NY 981B, to the last signed exit with the concurrent routes of U.S. Route 6 (US 6) and US 202 adjacent to East Branch Reservoir. The highway carrying both roads parallels I-84 at this point. Just past it I-684 officially ends as NY 22 merges onto the highway, having left the 6/202 concurrency. Over the next quarter-mile the two roadways slowly converge into a two-lane surface road by the at-grade intersection with Sodom and Old Milltown roads, continuing north towards Pawling. History Interstate 684 wends between Muscoot Reservoir to its west and Cross River Reservoir to its east near Katonah, New York. Byram Lake Reservoir just west of I-684 at bottom. (Aerial photo, 2013). An expressway along the NY 22 corridor between White Plains and Brewster was planned by Westchester County in 1956. In 1961, the proposed routing of I-87 north of Elmsford along the east bank of the Hudson River was relocated to use the NY 22 corridor instead via modern I-287 and I-84. After much controversy, the routing of I-87 was approved by the Bureau of Public Roads in December 1964. Construction began soon after the approval with the southernmost section between White Plains and Armonk (including the short section in Connecticut) opened in October 1968. The northernmost section between Purdys and Brewster opened in 1969. On January 1, 1970, I-87 was relocated to follow the New York State Thruway north of Elmsford. The old route was redesignated as I-684. Later that year, a third segment of the new highway between Armonk and Bedford Hills opened to traffic as well. For a time, Route 22 was a four-lane superhighway extending from Bedford Hills/Katonah to Goldens Bridge. The final segment eventually utilized the footprint of Route 22 and the Route 22 designation was returned to \\"Old Route 22\\", a parallel local road. The portion from Goldens Bridge to Brewster, which proved to be difficult from an engineering standpoint, was completed in December 1974. Exit list I-684's exit numbers are sequential. While NYSDOT is transitioning to mileage-based numbers, there are no announced plans to convert I-684 exit numbers.

The many banks of this era were regulated by the states only, and \\"such restraints were infrequent and ineffective\\", (Krause Pubs, Standard Catalog of United States Paper Money, 22nd Edition), indeed law applicable to banks during this period were \\"those applying to similar firms whether or not they were financial institutions\\".Dwyer, Gerald P. \\"Wildcat Banking, Banking Panics, and Free Banking in the United States\\". The few private currency issues still extant after the passing of the National Banking Act rapidly disappeared under further legislation of 1865, and thereafter the US Government held an effective monopoly of the note-issuing function. According to some sources, the term came from a bank in Michigan that issued private paper currency with the image of a wildcat. After the bank failed, poorly backed bank notes became known as wildcat currency, and the banks that issued them as wildcat banks.Robert Allen Palmer, Speaking of Animals: A Dictionary of Animal Metaphors, Westport, Conn.: Greenwood Press, 1995, p.414. However, according to others, wildcat meant a rash speculator as early as 1812, and by 1838 had been extended to any risky business venture.Christine Ammer, It's Raining Cats and Dogs ... and Other Beastly Expressions (New York: Bantam Doubleday Dell, 1989) 152 A common conception of the wildcat bank in Westerns and like stories was of a bank that left its safe somewhat ajar for depositors to see, in which the banker would display a barrel full of nails, grain or flour with a thin sprinkling of cash on top, thus fooling depositors into thinking it was a successful bank. About The traditional view of wildcat banks describes them as distributing occasionally worthless currency backed by questionable security (such as mortgages and bonds). These actions ended when currency issued by state banks was brought to a close through the passage of the National Banking Acts 1863-5. Mark Twain, in his autobiography, refers to the use of such currency in 1853, \\"The firm paid my wages in wildcat money at its face value\\".Autobiography of Mark Twain, Smith, page 460 Before the establishment of the Federal Reserve System in 1913, banks extended loans by issuing notes. An individual may take his promissory notes or bills of exchange to the bank for discount. Banks would issue their own bank notes to the borrowers. Bank notes were usually backed by specie or government bonds. The holder of the bank note had a claim on the bank's assets. The overwhelming determinate of value on a bank's notes would be the quality of that bank's assets. Many of the states' regulations required for the banks to back their notes with state bonds. Banks in states that had safe bonds would thrive whereas banks in states that had risky bonds would suffer. Other factors could influence the value of a bank note, the major secondary cause being the likelihood of fraud, either from the bank or from forgery.Dwyer, Gerald P. \\"Wildcat Banking, Banking Panics, and Free Banking in the United States\\". Economic Review, 1996. p. 2. Retrieved 6 December 2013. \\"Free banks did not always redeem their notes as promised, and there are fabulous stories of fraudulent activities, stories that appear frequently in histories of free banking and general histories of banking.\\" Many varieties of money different banks traded at different discounts to their face value. Lists were published to help bankers and others to identify and appraise the bills (and forgeries). One of the major causes of discounting occurred due to the real cost of transferring the notes to the original bank, (Dennett 2016, _English Provincial Paper Money_ ).

CDO plays an important role in cysteine catabolism, regulating intracellular levels of cysteine and responding changes in cysteine availability. As such, CDO is highly regulated and undergoes large changes in concentration and efficiency. It oxidizes cysteine to the corresponding sulfinic acid by activation of dioxygen, although the exact mechanism of the reaction is still unclear. In addition to being found in mammals, CDO also exists in some yeast and bacteria, although the exact function is still unknown. CDO has been implicated in various neurodegenerative diseases and cancers, which is likely related to cysteine toxicity.  Function  CDO is responsible for the first major step in metabolism of cysteine. CDO oxidizes to cysteine sulfinic acid (which exists predominantly in the anionic sulfinate form in vivo). Overall, CDO catalyzes the addition of dioxygen (O2) to a thiol, producing a sulfinic acid. More specifically, CDO is part of the group of non-heme iron oxygenases that employ oxygen as an electron acceptor. Cysteine sulfinic acid is then metabolized further via two divergent pathways: decarboxylated to hypotaurine by sulfinoalanine decarboxylase and oxidized to taurine by hypotaurine dehydrogenase; or transaminated to a putative 3-sulfinylpyruvate intermediate, which decomposes spontaneously into pyruvate and sulfite. Sulfite can then be oxidized to sulfate by sulfite oxidase. Thus CDO is necessary for hypotaurine/taurine and sulfite/sulfate production. The role of CDO may vary between cell types as it can either be used primarily for taurine or sulfate production or for degradation of cysteine.CDO reaction scheme showing cysteine sulfinic acid formation from cysteine by dioxygen incorporation  Structure  Active site of CDO, with iron (II) bound to cysteine substrate and key residues highlighted. Generated from 2IC1. CDO is a 22.5 kDa protein that contains 200 amino acid residues and has an isoelectric point (pI) of 5.5. The primary structure is highly conserved between mammalian species, with murine and human CDO differing in only 16 residues. CDO is part of the cupin superfamily, whose members possess a 6-stranded β-barrel in a \\"jelly-roll\\" topology. Crystal structures of the protein have been obtained at 1.5 Å resolution (mouse). The active site displays a unique geometry where instead of the typical facial triad of two histidines and one carboxylate side-chain coordinating to an iron (II) species, three histidine ligands are bound to iron. Furthermore, crystal structures show the amino nitrogen and thiolate sulfur of cysteine coordinated to the iron in addition to a single water molecule (see figure). CDO contains a unique internal cofactor created by intramolecular thioether formation between Cys93 and Tyr157, which is postulated to participate in catalysis. When the protein was first isolated, two bands on agarose gel were observed, corresponding to the cofactor- containing protein and the unlinked \\"immature\\" protein, respectively. Crosslinking increases efficiency of CDO ten-fold and is regulated by levels of cysteine, an unusual example of protein cofactor formation mediated by substrate (feedforward activation).  Mechanism  The CDO mechanism is still not well understood, despite active research to elucidate details of the reaction. Overall, the reaction involves addition of O2 to cysteine, which occurs spontaneously without enzyme catalysis. Studies have shown that the cysteinyltyrosine bridge lowers the oxidation potential of tyrosine (commonly an electron donor, as in photosystem II) by ~0.5 V relative to phenol and increases its acidity. The thioether moiety likely plays a structural, redox, or, acid/base role. Other studies have shown that Tyr157 is needed for enzyme function (possibly as a tyrosinyl radical) and is highly conserved across CDO variants. Furthermore, research has shown that cysteamine, a structurally similar molecule to cysteine, enhances cysteine oxidation but is not a substrate. left One proposed mechanism, supported by computational and spectroscopic studies, involves O2 binding cis to a thiolate to form reactive iron (III)-superoxo species (A), which then attacks the bound sulfur of cysteine to form a four-membered ring structure (B). Heterolytic O-O bond cleavage then affords a high-valent iron (IV) oxo intermediate (C), which transfers the second oxygen to sulfur.  Regulation  CDO is tightly regulated in the cell to maintain cysteine homeostasis. In particular, CDO responds to changes in dietary cysteine availability and protein intake, maintaining decreased activity with low cysteine levels and increased activity at high levels to prevent cytotoxicity. Studies have shown that CDO can exhibit a dramatic increase in hepatic activity within hours. Unlike many enzymes, it is predominantly regulated at the level of protein turnover rather than transcriptional (mRNA levels). High cysteine levels inhibit ubiquitinylation, which lowers the rate of proteasomal degradation. CDO is also regulated in adipose tissue, where high cysteine levels cause increased hypotaurine/taurine production. Regulation of CDO is also thought to involve both the crosslinked and immature forms of the protein.  Disease Relevance  Because of its relevance to cysteine metabolism, changes in CDO activity may cause disease in humans. Research has found that elevated cysteine can by cytotoxic, neurotoxic, and excitotoxic. Abnormal or deficient CDO activity has been linked to Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, rheumatoid arthritis, and motor neuron diseases. In these diseases, patients display depressed sulfate levels, elevated fasting cysteine plasma concentrations, and other symptoms consistent with impaired cysteine oxidation. CDO deficiency and subsequent cysteine accumulation in the globus pallidus has been linked to Hallervorden-Spatz disease. The expression of CDO is altered in cancer cells and methylation of the CDO1 (human cysteine dioxygenase type I) promoter gene was shown to occur in colon, breast, esophageal, lung, bladder, and stomach cancers. Silencing of CDO1 is a critical epigenetic event in breast cancer, leading to downregulation of CDO1 activity. In particular, decreased CDO1 activity causes increased hydrogen sulfide (H2S), which has been connected to various diseases. These results suggest that CDO1 (human cysteine dioxygenase type I) acts as a tumor suppressor gene and may potentially serve as a biomarker for cancer.

According to the , it has a population of . It is one of the notable places that had a major role in the country's history during the 1800s and 1900s. Formerly known as Cavite El Viejo, it is the location of his home,and the name Kawit is from the word kalawit, the Aguinaldo Shrine, where independence from Spain was declared on June 12, 1898. It is also the birthplace of Emilio Aguinaldo, the first President of the Philippines, who from 1895 to 1897, served as the municipality's chief executive. Etymology The name Kawit is derived from the Tagalog word kawit (hook) which is suggestive of its location at the base of a hookshaped shoreline along Manila Bay extending to the tip of Cavite City. Legend, however, gives another version on how the town got its name. One day a Spanish visitor asked a native blacksmith about the name of the village. The latter was busy at the time pounding on the anvil a piece of hot metal that looked like a hook. He hesitated to speak, not understanding what the stranger was asking, but when pressed for an answer, and thinking that he wanted to know what he was doing, he merely said kawit (hook). The Spaniards left muttering the word kawit. In the course of the time the word kawit evolved into \\"cauite,\\" and finally \\"cavite\\". History Kawit was the most thriving settlement prior to the coming of the Spaniards. In fact, the town provided the first anchorage of the Spaniards in the province, whence colonization and proselytization of the Christian religion began, spreading to all corners of the province. For a long time, the place was called by the Spaniards \\"Cavite el Viejo\\" or Old Cavite to distinguish it from \\"Cavite la Punta\\" or \\"Cavite el Puerto,\\" the commercial port and naval base (now Cavite City) whence came many Spanish marines on shore leave who made frequent visits to Cavite el Viejo, eventually turning it into a red-light district. This seedy reputation of the town was erased when Saint Mary Magdalene was made patroness, under the spiritual supervision of the Jesuits as ordered by Miguel García Serrano, O.S.A. (1618–1629), the fifth Archbishop of Manila. With the establishment in the wake of the Philippine Revolution, the Philippine Independent Church built a shrine to Saint Michael, the Archangel in the barrio of Binakayan in 1902. Cavite el Viejo was then a big town, comprising the municipality of Kawit today, Cavite la Punta (now Cavite City), Noveleta (called Tierra Alta by the Spaniards), and Imus. Eventually, these three barrios' populations grew and they eventually seceded to become independent municipalities. Aside from its role as the birthplace of independence, Kawit was also the site of the Battle of Binakayan-Dalahican, one of several Filipino victories during the Revolution. Barangays Kawit is politically subdivided into 23 barangays. ClimateDemographics In the , the population of Kawit was people, with a density of . Culture= Maytinis Festival  An original Kawit tradition that takes place every Christmas Eve, a dramatic retelling of the Virgin Mary and Joseph's search in bethlehem for a place to stay called \\"Panunuluyan\\". This reenactment happens on the streets of Kawit with different floats depicting different biblical scenes from Adam and Eve up to Mary and Joseph. The \\"Panunuluyan\\" takes place in several houses and is done in singing until it reaches the 400-year-old St. Mary Magdalene Church of Kawit where the Virgin Mary and Joseph are welcomed by angels in a giant \\"belen\\" (Nativity Scene) which covers the whole main Retablo or altarpiece of the church. The songs performed by the angels acted by little girls are mostly in Spanish and Tagalog. Government Like any other Philippine municipality, Kawit is headed by a municipal mayor, vice mayor, and ten councilors, eight of them elected at large by the voting populace and two of them being sectoral representatives (one for the barangays and one for the youth, elected respectively through their federations). The current mayor of the historical town is Angelo Emilio G. Aguinaldo who succeeded his father, Reynaldo \\"Tik\\" Aguinaldo, after winning over former Vice Mayor Paul Plaridel A. Abaya Jr. by a historic margin of 5,039 votes in the last May 2016 elections. Mayor Angelo Aguinaldo served as a Sangguniang Bayan member from 2013–2016.

Public Service Responsibility of Broadcast Licensees [The Blue Book], 7 March. Washington, DC: FCC. The report was informally and commonly referred to as the FCC Blue Book because of the report's blue cover. The Blue Book bound the privilege of holding a lucrative and scarce radio broadcast license to certain public service requirements. The Blue Book specified the requirements and tied failure to meet these obligations to hearings and to the potential revocation of a broadcast license. Such a standard was never before proposed in the annals of the FCC, and hasn't been proposed since.Victor Pickard, “The Battle over the FCC Blue Book: Determining the Role of Broadcast Media in a Democratic Society, 1945-1948”, in Media, Culture and Society 33, no. 2 (2011): 172. The Blue Book—and the commissioners and staff at the FCC who wrote, published, and defended it—faced a considerable backlash from commercial broadcasters.Pickard, “The Battle over the FCC Blue Book”, 182–5. The backlash was tied closely to anti-Communist fervor in the United States in the 1940s and 1950s. Opponents, in particular the National Association of Broadcasters and the radio industry's leading trade magazine, Broadcasting, decried the Blue Book as Communist-inspired, pro-censorship, and anathema to freedom. Broadcasting’s editorials attacked it for 15 consecutive weeks and were later compiled by NBC president Niles Trammel in a red-covered booklet called “The Red Book Looks at the Blue Book.”The Red Book Looks at the Blue Book. NBC Publications, 1946. The backlash was ultimately successful. Those staff most closely involved with the Blue Book were driven out of the FCC; none of the Blue Book's policy prescriptions were ever implemented, and no U.S. radio broadcaster ever lost its broadcast license as a result of violating the Blue Book's prescriptions. Context Disfavor ran rampant against the state of radio in the 1930s and 1940s. Chief among the complaints: the vulgarity of radio commercials and overcommercialization, the erosion of so-called \\"sustaining (non-commercial) programs\\", the influence of advertisers to shape news coverage, and the lax performance of broadcasters to abide by their original obligations towards public service.Pickard, “The Battle over the FCC Blue Book”, 178. Emblematic of this sentiment was the highly popular novel The Hucksters (1946), which depicted greedy radio station owners. A later film adaptation of The Hucksters (1947) starred Clark Gable. This sentiment dovetailed with a progressive current at the FCC, whose chair James Lawrence Fly spearheaded a number of initiatives—among them the 1941 Report on Chain BroadcastingFederal Communications Commission: Report on Chain Broadcasting (May 1941). that resulted in the breakup of the NBC radio network and the formation of the ABC radio network. The Supreme Court in its 1943 decision NBC, Inc. v. United States affirmed that FCC had the authority to establish programming objectives. One subsequent initiative was a formalization of the rules of the social contract between radio broadcasters and the public; that crystallized as the Blue Book, which codified the thinking of the majority of FCC commissioners at the time. The Blue Book was unanimously approved by the commission and published on March 7, 1946. Content of the Blue Book The Blue Book comprised five parts and was 59 pages long. The five parts are roughly summarized as follows: 1\\\\. Local broadcasting is important, and many radio stations violated their commitments for localism. 2\\\\. The FCC has the jurisdiction to evaluate public service performance. 3\\\\. A number of public service issues are discussed, including public interest considerations regarding license assignment, and what programming suffices to serve the public interest, defining the functions thereof. 4\\\\. Statistics show increasing profitability on the part of radio broadcasters, but little improvement of programming. This contradicted the claim that broadcasters couldn't afford public interest programs. 5\\\\. Four requirements for broadcast licensees are outlined: promote live, local shows; devote programming to discussing public issues; sustain \\"unsponsorable\\" programs; and eliminate \\"excess advertising\\".  WBAL Trial  In the fall of 1946, the William Hearst owned Baltimore radio station WBAL was challenged by the Public Service Radio Corporation (PSRC). Formed by well-known radio newsmen, Robert Allen and Drew Pearson, the PSRC claimed WBAL shouldn't have its broadcasting license renewed due to failure in adhering to the Blue Book's regulations in not providing public service programming to the local community and conglomerating a newspaper, radio station, and television station in one city market. The FCC hearings were held between November 1947 and February 1948, to reach a decision, but ultimately stalled allowing WBAL to hold a temporary license. In 1951, the commissioners voted and determined in a three to two vote with two abstains that the WBAL demonstrated competence despite imperfections.  Failure  The FCC never obtained congressional legislation or judicial approval to support the Blue Book's progressive regulations. The Congress was becoming increasingly conservative allowing for increased sympathy for broadcaster and hostility towards radio reformists. Senate Interstate Commerce Committee chairman, Republican senator Wallace White and Republican house representative Charles Wolverton drafted the White-Wolverton Bill to impose clear regulatory guidelines for the FCC and increased constraints on broadcasters. Provisions included granting the FCC authority in determining any station's public service performance, but prevented discriminatory withholding of licenses. The bill also included pro-monopoly legislation prohibiting the FCC from preventing newspapers from owning radio stations. Both broadcasters and reformists were dissatisfied, especially broadcasters as the industry benefited from keeping the FCC's power vague so interventions could be contested automatically. In June 1948, neither of the companion bills received a vote and were discarded. By the end of 1947, hearings on broadcasters that failed Blue Book standards were dropped and chairman Charles Denny backtracked on the Blue Book's principles.  Impact  Other similar FCC's policies were challenged including the Mayflower Doctrine which prohibited political editorializing, expressing partisan opinion rather than news. On June 2, 1949, the rule was revoked and replaced with the Fairness Doctrine allowing radio stations to choose their own programming, but requiring a reasonable amount of air time to be devoted to public service programming of interest to the community and be designed to hear opposing views on public issues. In February 1944, the University of Chicago announced the formation of the Hutchins Commission to inquire on the function and responsibilities of the American press. Formed and chaired by University of Chicago president, Robert Hutchins and composed of twelve commissioners that would interview individuals throughout the news industry including advertisers, editors, readers, and reporters. The commission interviewed FCC commissioner and head of the Blue Book study, Clifford Durr and FCC chairman, Lawrence Fly and studied the Blue Book closely to draw its conclusions. In March 1947, the commission released its report and like the Blue Book outlined the need for the press to service programming for the community to clarify societal goals and values.

As a university professor he had been active in the state militias of Kentucky and Tennessee and on the outbreak of hostilities he sided with the South, despite having been born in the North in a family of abolitionist quakers. As a divisional commander he managed to evade capture at the Battle of Fort Donelson, but was wounded at the Battle of Shiloh. He served under Robert E. Lee throughout the 10-month Siege of Petersburg, and surrendered with him at Appomattox. Early life Johnson was born in Belmont County, Ohio. He was raised as a Quaker and, before moving to the South, worked on the Underground Railroad with his uncle.Fergus M. Bordewich, Bound for Canaan: The Epic Story of the Underground Railroad, America's First Civil Rights Movement, at 230 (Amistad 2006). He graduated from the United States Military Academy in 1840 and was commissioned a second lieutenant in the 3rd U.S. Infantry. He fought in the Seminole War in Florida and the Mexican–American War. He was forced to resign from the Army in October 1847 after being accused of selling contraband goods. He worked as a professor of natural philosophy and chemistry at the Western Military Institute, Georgetown, Kentucky (1848–1849), and professor of mathematics and engineering at the University of Nashville (1849–1861). During this period he was active in the state militias of Kentucky and Tennessee, rising to the rank of colonel. His wife Mary died prior to the war of natural causes, leaving him with a disabled son. Civil War After the start of the Civil War, Johnson entered the service June 28, 1861, as a colonel of engineers in the Tennessee Militia, and a week later this commission was changed to be in the Confederate States Army. Before his wartime service he went north and left his developmentally disabled son in the care of relatives; his son grew up believing that he was fighting for the Union. He approved the locations of two new river-defenses, Fort Donelson on the west bank of the Cumberland River in Tennessee and Fort Henry on the low and flood-prone east bank of the Tennessee River, just 12 miles west of Fort Donelson and also located in Tennessee. Johnson was promoted to brigadier general on January 24, 1862. Fort Henry would turn out to be a disastrous location on swampy ground, often flooded, and easily captured by U.S. Grant. In approving the proposed site for Fort Henry, Johnson overruled vigorous objections to the proposed site from the two members of the Confederate survey team, Adna Anderson, a civil engineer, and Maj. William Foster of the Tennessee 1st Infantry. Just days before the Battle of Fort Donelson he was placed in command of the fort but served in that capacity only briefly as the higher ranking Brig. Gen. Gideon J. Pillow arrived only hours after Johnson assumed command. He commanded a division of the army at Donelson, but was effectively overshadowed by the more politically astute Pillow, who led the wing in a fierce assault in an attempt to break out and escape from the encircled fort. The fort and its army surrendered to Brig. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant on February 16, 1862, but two days later Johnson was able to walk unimpeded out through the porous Union Army lines and escaped capture. Johnson commanded a brigade of the Army of Mississippi at the Battle of Shiloh, and on the second day of battle, April 7, 1862, he became the division commander, but was severely wounded by the concussion of an artillery shell. For the next year in Braxton Bragg's Army of Tennessee, Johnson's brigade served under a number of divisional commanders of William Hardee's corps: (1) Simon Bolivar Buckner during Bragg's Invasion of Kentucky and its culminating Battle of Perryville; (2) Patrick Cleburne after Bragg's withdrawal back into Tennessee and the Battle of Stones River; and (3) A.P. Stewart during the Battle of Hoover's Gap of the 1863 Tullahoma Campaign. Thereafter, Bragg withdrew into Georgia. At the Battle of Chickamauga, Johnson's brigade spent September 18 on the Confederate right, assigned to the command of John Bell Hood's division of James Longstreet's corps, then just arriving from Virginia. There, Johnson's men secured Reed's Bridge. On September 19, Longstreet's forces were shifted to the Confederate left and Johnson's men saw minor action against Union forces coming north from the vicinity of Crawfish Springs. The following day, Johnson's men were part of the Confederate push across the Brotherton Field, but were not able to overtake the Union right on Snodgrass Hill. Bragg followed up with a siege of Chattanooga, while Johnson, now commanding a division, accompanied Longstreet's force north for the Siege of Knoxville. After spending the winter of 1863-64 in northeastern Tennessee, Longstreet's force was transported by rail back to Virginia to reinforce Robert E. Lee for the Overland Campaign. En route, Johnson alone was diverted to Petersburg, to command a division in the Department of North Carolina and Southern Virginia under P. G. T. Beauregard. During the ensuing Bermuda Hundred Campaign, Johnson's division blocked the Union advance toward Petersburg at Swift Creek on May 9. Beauregard defeated the larger Union offensive, and Johnson was promoted to major general on May 21. During the Siege of Petersburg, the section of the defenses held by Johnson's division was attacked in the Battle of the Crater on July 30. The mine was set off under part of Elliott's South Carolina Brigade, which rallied and captured three stands of colors and 130 prisoners that day. When Beauregard was transferred to the western theater in October, Johnson's division was assigned to Anderson's Fourth Corps in the Army of Northern Virginia under Robert E. Lee. Johnson's division spent the next seven months of the siege in the trenches. In late March 1865, Johnson's division was withdrawn from the trench line to meet the Union drive around the Confederate right flank, and fought at Lewis's Farm on March 29. On March 31, Johnson led them in a counterattack at White Oak Road. They drove back two Union divisions, but were halted and driven back themselves by Union reinforcements. Two brigades of the division were detached to Pickett at Five Forks, and largely destroyed in that battle on April 1. Johnson led the rest of the division in the retreat toward Appomattox. At Sailor's Creek on April 6, the division was shattered, although Johnson escaped capture. Lee relieved Johnson of command on April 8. He accompanied the army without a command until the surrender at Appomattox Court House, when he was paroled. Postbellum life and death Johnson returned to teaching to become a professor and co- chancellor (1870) of the University of Nashville with former Confederate General Edmund Kirby Smith. His health failing, he retired in 1875 to a farm near Brighton, Illinois, where he died in 1880. He was originally buried in Miles Station, near Brighton, but was reinterred in 1975 to Old City Cemetery, Nashville, Tennessee, to be next to the grave of his wife, Mary.

It was published by Random House on January 12, 1984. It is an anti-war story; specifically, a parable about arms races in general, mutually assured destruction and nuclear weapons in particular. The Butter Battle Book was a New York Times Notable Book of the Year. This book was written during the Cold War era and reflects the concerns of the time, especially the perceived possibility that humanity could be destroyed in a nuclear war. It can also be seen as a satirical work, with its depiction of a deadly war based on a senseless conflict over something as trivial as a breakfast food. The concept of a war based on toast is similar to the war between Lilliput and Blefuscu in Jonathan Swift's 1726 satire Gulliver's Travels, which was nominally based on an argument over the correct end to crack an egg once soft-boiled. Plot The Yooks and Zooks live on opposite sides of a long curving wall. The narrator of the story is a Yook child whose grandfather takes him to the wall, explaining he is a retired soldier. The Yooks wear blue clothes, but the Zooks wear orange. The difference between the two cultures is that while the Yooks eat their bread with the butter-side up, the Zooks eat their bread with the butter-side down. The conflict between the two sides leads to an escalating arms race, which results in the threat of mutual assured destruction. The race begins when a Zook named VanItch slingshots the Yook patrolman's (Grandpa in his younger years) \\"Tough-Tufted Prickly Snick-Berry Switch\\" (a switch-esque truncheon with prickly burrs). The Yooks then develop a machine with three slingshots interlinked, called a \\"Triple-Sling Jigger\\". This works once; but the next day VanItch counterattacks with his own creation: The \\"Jigger-Rock Snatchem\\", a machine with three nets to fling the rocks fired by the Triple- Sling Jigger back to the Yooks' side. Every time the patrolman is defeated, he reports this to his general, who tells him not to worry (\\"My Bright Boys are thinking\\"), and three intelligent Yooks are shown drafting plans for a more modern weapon. The Yooks then create a gun called the \\"Kick-A-Poo Kid\\", which is loaded with \\"powerful Poo-A-Doo powder and ants' eggs and bees' legs and dried-fried clam chowder\\", and carried by a trained gun-toting spaniel named Daniel. The Zooks counterattack with an \\"Eight-Nozzled Elephant-Toted Boom Blitz\\", a machine that shoots \\"high-explosive sour cherry stone pits\\". The Yooks then devise the brand new \\"Utterly Sputter\\": a large blue vehicle mainly intended \\"to sprinkle blue goo all over the Zooks\\". The Zooks counterattack with a Sputter identical to the Yooks'. Eventually, each side possesses a small but extremely destructive red bomb called the \\"Bitsy Big-Boy Boomeroo\\", and neither has any defense against it, so while the Yooks' patrolman and VanItch drop theirs, the Yooks and Zooks will have to stay underground to make sure that they don't get blown away. No resolution is reached by the book's end, with the generals of both sides on the wall poised to drop their bombs and waiting for the other to strike. The narrator asks his grandfather, \\"Who's gonna drop it? Will you or will he?\\" To which Grandpa nervously replies, \\"Be patient. We'll see. We will see...\\" Television special There was an animated TV special by animator and filmmaker Ralph Bakshi, narrated by Charles Durning and produced by and aired on TNT on November 13, 1989. The special followed the book closely, notably in its preservation of its original cliffhanger ending, with the title card \\"The end... maybe\\" at the conclusion of the story. Seuss himself called the short the most faithful adaptation of his work.Dr. Seuss considered the 1989 television special of The Butter Battle Book to be the most faithful rendition of any of his works. The cliffhanger ending was undone by the Berlin Wall opening just four days before the TV show aired. The wall had been taken as a simple fact of life in the book. As the TV show aired floods of East Germans poured through the wall, celebrating the end of Soviet domination.

Fear of Words: Censorship and the Public Libraries of Canada. Ottawa, Ont.: Canadian Library Association \\"Challenged Books\\" University of Saskatchewan website An article in the July 27, 1984 issue of the conservative magazine National Review found it plausible that the book was not more popular because of Seuss' promotion of a theme of \\"moral equivalence\\", where the difference between the Soviet Union and the United States was equivalent to a disagreement over the proper side on which to butter bread.The Butter Battle Book, National Review, July 27, 1984, p. 16 On the other hand, Roger S. Clark, a professor at Rutgers University School of Law, argued in an article in the New York Law School Law Review that \\"The Butter Battle Book ... captures the arms race and the development of weapons of war. ... The book struck such a chord with me when it came out in 1984 (which was also Seuss’s eightieth birthday). Something Orwellian about the timing! While its message is timeless, I suspect Seuss was well aware of the context he was writing in. It was a time when many people the world over, especially organizations of doctors and lawyers, were groping their way toward the massive civil society effort that led eventually to the advisory proceedings on nuclear weapons being brought through the World Health Organization (WHO) and the U.N. General Assembly.\\"Clark, Roger S. \\"Is The Butter Battle Book’s Bitsy Big-Boy Boomeroo Banned?

He was the first cousin of Emilio Aguinaldo, the first president of the Philippines, as well as the grandfather of Cesar Virata, a former prime minister in the 1980s. Early life Baldomero Aguinaldo was born in Kawit, Cavite. He was the son of Cipriano Aguinaldo y Jamir and Silveria Baloy. His father was the son of Eugenio Aguinaldo y Kajigas and Maria Jamir. Education He studied law at the University of Santo Tomas in Manila and was still a law student during the outbreak of the Philippine Revolution. He obtained a law degree, but failed to take the bar examination. Unable to practice law, he became a farmer. Career Aguinaldo organized, along with his cousin Emilio, the Magdalo chapter of the Katipunan in Kawit. He became president of the council. In the early days of hostilities, he always stayed at the side of his cousin Emilio. He fought in several bloody battles. He also led the Magdalo faction to the Katipunan which had its headquarters in Kawit, Cavite. Aguinaldo's knowledge of the law and administrative procedures made him a valuable asset to the revolutionary government. He was appointed to several cabinet positions, and was a signer of two important documents: The Biak-na-bato Constitution, and the Pact of Biak- na-Bato. During the Philippine–American War, Aguinaldo fought again, becoming commanding general of the revolutionary forces in the southern Luzon provinces. When hostilities ended in 1901, he retired to private life. He held many various positions in the Aguinaldo Cabinet as Minister of National Defense and Finance Minister. During the American occupation he became the President of the Philippine Veteran's Association. Personal life He was married to Doña Petrona Reyes with 2 children: Leonor and Aureliano. Leonor was the mother of former Prime Minister Cesar Virata. Aguinaldo was a member of the Philippine Independent Church (also known as the Aglipayan Church) as he saw independence from the Roman Catholic Church as a source of national pride. Death Aguinaldo died in Manila of heart failure and rheumatism on February 4, 1915 at the age of 45 and was interred at the Manila North Cemetery. His remains were later exhumed and brought to his home in Binakayan, Cavite.

These other objects are called dependencies. In the typical \\"using\\" relationship the receiving object is called a client and the passed (that is, \\"injected\\") object is called a service. The code that passes the service to the client can be many kinds of things and is called the injector. Instead of the client specifying which service it will use, the injector tells the client what service to use. The \\"injection\\" refers to the passing of a dependency (a service) into the object (a client) that would use it. The service is made part of the client's state. Passing the service to the client, rather than allowing a client to build or find the service, is the fundamental requirement of the pattern. The intent behind dependency injection is to achieve separation of concerns of construction and use of objects. This can increase readability and code reuse. Dependency injection is one form of the broader technique of inversion of control. A client who wants to call some services should not have to know how to construct those services. Instead, the client delegates the responsibility of providing its services to external code (the injector). The client is not allowed to call the injector code; it is the injector that constructs the services. The injector then injects (passes) the services into the client which might already exist or may also be constructed by the injector. The client then uses the services. This means the client does not need to know about the injector, how to construct the services, or even which actual services it is using. The client only needs to know about the intrinsic interfaces of the services because these define how the client may use the services. This separates the responsibility of \\"use\\" from the responsibility of \\"construction\\". Intent Dependency Injection solves problems such as: * How can an application or class be independent of how its objects are created? * How can the way objects are created be specified in separate configuration files? * How can an application support different configurations? Creating objects directly within the class is inflexible because it commits the class to particular objects and makes it impossible to change the instantiation later independently from (without having to change) the class. It stops the class from being reusable if other objects are required, and it makes the class hard to test because real objects can not be replaced with mock objects. A class is no longer responsible for creating the objects it requires, and it does not have to delegate instantiation to a factory object as in the Abstract Factory design pattern. See also the UML class and sequence diagram below. Overview Dependency injection separates the creation of a client's dependencies from the client's behavior, which allows program designs to be loosely coupled and to follow the dependency inversion and single responsibility principles.Niko Schwarz, Mircea Lungu, Oscar Nierstrasz, “Seuss: Decoupling responsibilities from static methods for fine-grained configurability”, Journal of Object Technology, Volume 11, no. 1 (April 2012), pp. 3:1-23 It directly contrasts with the service locator pattern, which allows clients to know about the system they use to find dependencies. An injection, the basic unit of dependency injection, is not a new or a custom mechanism. It works in the same way that \\"parameter passing\\" works. Referring to \\"parameter passing\\" as an injection carries the added implication that it is being done to isolate the client from details. An injection is also about what is in control of the passing (never the client) and is independent of how the passing is accomplished, whether by passing a reference or a value. Dependency injection involves four roles: * the service object(s) to be used * the client object that is depending on the service(s) it uses * the interfaces that define how the client may use the services * the injector, which is responsible for constructing the services and injecting them into the client As an analogy, * service - an electric, gas, hybrid, or diesel car * client - a driver who uses the car the same way regardless of the engine * interface - automatic, ensures driver does not have to understand engine details like gears * injector - the parent who bought the kid the car and decided which kind Any object that may be used can be considered a service. Any object that uses other objects can be considered a client. The names have nothing to do with what the objects are for and everything to do with the role the objects play in any one injection. The interfaces are the types the client expects its dependencies to be. An issue is what they make accessible. They may truly be interface types implemented by the services but also may be abstract classes or even the concrete services themselves, though this last would violate DIP and sacrifice the dynamic decoupling that enables testing. It is only required that the client does not know which they are and therefore never treats them as concrete, say by constructing or extending them. The client should have no concrete knowledge of the specific implementation of its dependencies. It should only know the interface's name and API. As a result, the client will not need to change even if what is behind the interface changes. However, if the interface is refactored from being a class to an interface type (or vice versa) the client will need to be recompiled. This is significant if the client and services are published separately. This unfortunate coupling is one that dependency injection cannot resolve. The injector introduces the services into the client. Often, it also constructs the client. An injector may connect together a very complex object graph by treating an object like a client and later as a service for another client. The injector may actually be many objects working together but may not be the client. The injector may be referred to by other names such as: assembler, provider, container, factory, builder, spring, construction code, or main. Dependency injection can be applied as a discipline, one that asks that all objects separate construction and behavior. Relying on a DI framework to perform construction can lead to forbidding the use of the new keyword, or, less strictly, only allowing direct construction of value objects. Taxonomy Inversion of control (IoC) is more general than dependency injection. Put simply, IoC means letting other code call you rather than insisting on doing the calling. An example of IoC without dependency injection is the template method pattern. Here, polymorphism is achieved through subclassing, that is, inheritance. Dependency injection implements IoC through composition so is often identical to that of the strategy pattern, but while the strategy pattern is intended for dependencies to be interchangeable throughout an object's lifetime, in dependency injection it may be that only a single instance of a dependency is used. This still achieves polymorphism, but through delegation and composition. Dependency injection frameworks Application frameworks such as CDI and its implementation Weld, Spring, Guice, Play framework, Salta, Glassfish HK2, Dagger, and Managed Extensibility Framework (MEF) support dependency injection but are not required to do dependency injection. Advantages * Dependency injection allows a client the flexibility of being configurable. Only the client's behavior is fixed. The client may act on anything that supports the intrinsic interface the client expects.https://python.astrotech.io/design- patterns/structural/dependency-injection.html * Dependency injection can be used to externalize a system's configuration details into configuration files, allowing the system to be reconfigured without recompilation. Separate configurations can be written for different situations that require different implementations of components. This includes, but is not limited to, testing.http://python-dependency-injector.ets- labs.org/introduction/di_in_python.html * Because dependency injection does not require any change in code behavior it can be applied to legacy code as a refactoring. The result is clients that are more independent and that are easier to unit test in isolation using stubs or mock objects that simulate other objects not under test. This ease of testing is often the first benefit noticed when using dependency injection.https://visualstudiomagazine.com/articles/2014/07/01/larger- applications.aspx *Dependency injection allows a client to remove all knowledge of a concrete implementation that it needs to use. This helps isolate the client from the impact of design changes and defects. It promotes reusability, testability and maintainability. *Reduction of boilerplate code in the application objects, since all work to initialize or set up dependencies is handled by a provider component. *Dependency injection allows concurrent or independent development. Two developers can independently develop classes that use each other, while only needing to know the interface the classes will communicate through. Plugins are often developed by third party shops that never even talk to the developers who created the product that uses the plugins.https://dzone.com/articles/how-dependency-injection-di- works-in-spring-java-a *Dependency Injection decreases coupling between a class and its dependency. Disadvantages * Dependency injection creates clients that demand configuration details be supplied by construction code. This can be onerous when obvious defaults are available.https://dzone.com/articles/how-dependency-injection-di-works-in- spring-java-a * Dependency injection can make code difficult to trace (read) because it separates behavior from construction. This means developers must refer to more files to follow how a system performs.https://dzone.com/articles/how-dependency-injection-di-works-in- spring-java-a * Dependency injection frameworks are implemented with reflection or dynamic programming. This can hinder use of IDE automation, such as \\"find references\\", \\"show call hierarchy\\" and safe refactorings.https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/a-quick-intro-to-dependency- injection-what-it-is-and-when-to-use-it-7578c84fa88f/ * Dependency injection typically requires more upfront development effort since one can not summon into being something right when and where it is needed but must ask that it be injected and then ensure that it has been injected.https://www.professionalqa.com/dependency-injection * Dependency injection forces complexity to move out of classes and into the linkages between classes which might not always be desirable or easily managed. * Dependency injection can encourage dependence on a dependency injection framework.  Structure = UML class and sequence diagram  A sample UML class and sequence diagram for the Dependency Injection design pattern. In the above UML class diagram, the \`Client\` class that requires \`ServiceA\` and \`ServiceB\` objects does not instantiate the \`ServiceA1\` and \`ServiceB1\` classes directly. Instead, an \`Injector\` class creates the objects and injects them into the \`Client\`, which makes the \`Client\` independent of how the objects are created (which concrete classes are instantiated). The UML sequence diagram shows the run-time interactions: The \`Injector\` object creates the \`ServiceA1\` and \`ServiceB1\` objects. Thereafter, the \`Injector\` creates the \`Client\` object and injects the \`ServiceA1\` and \`ServiceB1\` objects. Examples= Without dependency injection  In the following Java example, the Client class contains a Service member variable that is initialized by the Client constructor. The client controls which implementation of service is used and controls its construction. In this situation, the client is said to have a hard-coded dependency on ExampleService. // An example without dependency injection public class Client { // Internal reference to the service used by this client private ExampleService service; // Constructor Client() { // Specify a specific implementation in the constructor instead of using dependency injection service = new ExampleService(); } // Method within this client that uses the services public String greet() { return \\"Hello \\" + service.getName(); } } Dependency injection is an alternative technique to initialize the member variable rather than explicitly creating a service object as shown above. We can adjust this example using the various techniques described and illustrated in the subsections below.  Types of dependency injection  There are at least three ways a client object can receive a reference to an external module: ;constructor injection : The dependencies are provided through a client's class constructor. ;setter injection : The client exposes a setter method that the injector uses to inject the dependency. ;interface injection : The dependency's interface provides an injector method that will inject the dependency into any client passed to it. Clients must implement an interface that exposes a setter method that accepts the dependency. = Other types = It is possible for DI frameworks to have other types of injection beyond those presented above. Testing frameworks may also use other types. Some modern testing frameworks do not even require that clients actively accept dependency injection thus making legacy code testable. In particular, in the Java language it is possible to use reflection to make private attributes public when testing and thus accept injections by assignment. Some attempts at Inversion of Control do not provide full removal of dependency, but instead simply substitute one form of dependency for another. As a rule of thumb, if a programmer can look at nothing but the client code and tell what framework is being used, then the client has a hard-coded dependency on the framework. = Constructor injection = This method requires the client to provide a parameter in a constructor for the dependency. // Constructor Client(Service service) { // Save the reference to the passed-in service inside this client this.service = service; } = Setter injection = This method requires the client to provide a setter method for the dependency. // Setter method public void setService(Service service) { // Save the reference to the passed-in service inside this client. this.service = service; } = Interface injection = This is simply the client publishing a role interface to the setter methods of the client's dependencies. It can be used to establish how the injector should talk to the client when injecting dependencies. // Service setter interface. public interface ServiceSetter { public void setService(Service service); } // Client class public class Client implements ServiceSetter { // Internal reference to the service used by this client. private Service service; // Set the service that this client is to use. @Override public void setService(Service service) { this.service = service; } } = Constructor injection comparison = Preferred when all dependencies can be constructed first because it can be used to ensure the client object is always in a valid state, as opposed to having some of its dependency references be null (not be set). However, on its own, it lacks the flexibility to have its dependencies changed later. This can be a first step towards making the client immutable and therefore thread safe. // Constructor Client(Service service, Service otherService) { if (service  null) { throw new InvalidParameterException(\\"service must not be null\\"); } if (otherService  null) { throw new InvalidParameterException(\\"otherService must not be null\\"); } // Save the service references inside this client this.service = service; this.otherService = otherService; } = Setter injection comparison = Requires the client to provide a setter method for each dependency. This gives the freedom to manipulate the state of the dependency references at any time. This offers flexibility, but if there is more than one dependency to be injected, it is difficult for the client to ensure that all dependencies are injected before the client could be provided for use. // Set the service to be used by this client public void setService(Service service) { if (service  null) { throw new InvalidParameterException(\\"service must not be null\\"); } this.service = service; } // Set the other service to be used by this client public void setOtherService(Service otherService) { if (otherService  null) { throw new InvalidParameterException(\\"otherService must not be null\\"); } this.otherService = otherService; } Because these injections happen independently there is no way to tell when the injector is finished wiring the client. A dependency can be left null simply by the injector failing to call its setter. This forces the check that injection was completed from when the client is assembled to whenever it is used. // Set the service to be used by this client public void setService(Service service) { this.service = service; } // Set the other service to be used by this client public void setOtherService(Service otherService) { this.otherService = otherService; } // Check the service references of this client private void validateState() { if (service  null) { throw new IllegalStateException(\\"service must not be null\\"); } if (otherService  null) { throw new IllegalStateException(\\"otherService must not be null\\"); } } // Method that uses the service references public void doSomething() { validateState(); service.doYourThing(); otherService.doYourThing(); } = Interface injection comparison = The advantage of interface injection is that dependencies can be completely ignorant of their clients yet can still receive a reference to a new client and, using it, send a reference-to-self back to the client. In this way, the dependencies become injectors. The key is that the injecting method (which could just be a classic setter method) is provided through an interface. An assembler is still needed to introduce the client and its dependencies. The assembler would take a reference to the client, cast it to the setter interface that sets that dependency, and pass it to that dependency object which would turn around and pass a reference-to-self back to the client. For interface injection to have value, the dependency must do something in addition to simply passing back a reference to itself. This could be acting as a factory or sub-assembler to resolve other dependencies, thus abstracting some details from the main assembler. It could be reference- counting so that the dependency knows how many clients are using it. If the dependency maintains a collection of clients, it could later inject them all with a different instance of itself. // Service setter interface. public interface ServiceSetter { public void setService(Service service); } // Client class public class Client implements ServiceSetter { // Internal reference to the service used by this client. private Service service; // Set the service that this client is to use. @Override public void setService(Service service) { this.service = service; } } // Injector class public class ServiceInjector { Set clients; public void inject(ServiceSetter client) { clients.add(client); client.setService(new ServiceFoo()); } public void switchToBar() { for (Client client : clients) { client.setService(new ServiceBar()); } } } // Service classes public class ServiceFoo implements Service {} public class ServiceBar implements Service {}  Assembling examples  Manually assembling in main by hand is one way of implementing dependency injection. public class Injector { public static void main(String[] args) { // Build the dependencies first Service service = new ExampleService(); // Inject the service, constructor style Client client = new Client(service); // Use the objects System.out.println(client.greet()); } } The example above constructs the object graph manually and then invokes it at one point to start it working. Important to note is that this injector is not pure. It uses one of the objects it constructs. It has a purely construction-only relationship with ExampleService but mixes construction and using of Client. This should not be common. It is, however, unavoidable. Just like object oriented software needs a non-object oriented static method like main() to get started, a dependency injected object graph needs at least one (preferably only one) entry point to get the whole thing started. Manual construction in the main method may not be this straight forward and may involve calling builders, factories, or other construction patterns as well. This can be fairly advanced and abstract. The line is crossed from manual dependency injection to framework dependency injection once the constructing code is no longer custom to the application and is instead universal. Frameworks like Spring can construct these same objects and wire them together before returning a reference to client. All mention of the concrete ExampleService can be moved from the code to the configuration data. import org.springframework.beans.factory.BeanFactory; import org.springframework.context.ApplicationContext; import org.springframework.context.support.ClassPathXmlApplicationContext; public class Injector { public static void main(String[] args) { // -- Assembling objects -- // BeanFactory beanfactory = new ClassPathXmlApplicationContext(\\"Beans.xml\\"); Client client = (Client) beanfactory.getBean(\\"client\\"); // -- Using objects -- // System.out.println(client.greet()); } } Frameworks like Spring allow assembly details to be externalized in configuration files. This code (above) constructs objects and wires them together according to Beans.xml (below). ExampleService is still constructed even though it is only mentioned below. A long and complex object graph can be defined this way and the only class mentioned in code would be the one with the entry point method, which in this case is greet(). In the example above Client and Service have not had to undergo any changes to be provided by spring. They are allowed to remain simple POJOs. This shows how spring can connect services and clients that are completely ignorant of its existence. This could not be said if spring annotations are added to the classes. By keeping spring specific annotations and calls from spreading out among many classes, the system stays only loosely dependent on spring. This can be important if the system intends to outlive spring. The choice to keep POJOs pure does not come without cost. Rather than spending the effort to develop and maintain complex configuration files it is possible to simply use annotations to mark classes and let spring do the rest of the work. Resolving dependencies can be simple if they follow a convention such as matching by type or by name. This is choosing convention over configuration. It is also arguable that, when refactoring to another framework, removing framework specific annotations would be a trivial part of the task and many injection annotations are now standardized. import org.springframework.beans.factory.BeanFactory; import org.springframework.context.ApplicationContext; import org.springframework.context.annotation.AnnotationConfigApplicationContext; public class Injector { public static void main(String[] args) { // Assemble the objects BeanFactory beanfactory = new AnnotationConfigApplicationContext(MyConfiguration.class); Client client = beanfactory.getBean(Client.class); // Use the objects System.out.println(client.greet()); } } import org.springframework.context.annotation.Bean; import org.springframework.context.annotation.ComponentScan; import org.springframework.context.annotation.Configuration; @ComponentScan public class MyConfiguration { @Bean public Client client(ExampleService service) { return new Client(service); } } @Component public class ExampleService { public String getName() { return \\"World!\\"; } }  Assembly comparison  The different injector implementations (factories, service locators, and dependency injection containers) are not that different as far as dependency injection is concerned. What makes all the difference is where they are allowed to be used. Move calls to a factory or a service locator out of the client and into main and suddenly main makes a fairly good dependency injection container. By moving all knowledge of the injector out, a clean client, free of knowledge of the outside world, is left behind. However, any object that uses other objects can be considered a client. The object that contains main is no exception. This main object is not using dependency injection. It is actually using the service locator pattern. This can not be avoided because the choice of service implementations must be made somewhere. Externalizing the dependencies into configuration files does not change this fact. What makes this reality part of a good design is that the service locator is not spread throughout the code base. It is confined to one place per application. This leaves the rest of the code base free to use dependency injection to make clean clients.  Dependency Injection Pattern  The examples until now have been overly simple examples about constructing a string. However, the dependency injection pattern is most useful when constructing an object graph where objects communicate via messages. Objects constructed in main will last for the life of the program. The typical pattern is to construct the graph and then call one method on one object to send the flow of control into the object graph. Just as main is the entry point to the static code, this one method is the entry point to the applications non-static code. public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException { // Construction code. Greeter greeter = new Greeter(System.out); // This may be many lines that connect many objects // Behavior code. greeter.greet(); // This is one call to one method on one object in the object graph } class Greeter { public void greet() { this.out.println(\\"Hello world!\\"); } public Greeter(PrintStream out) { this.out = out; } private PrintStream out; } AngularJS example In the AngularJS framework, there are only three ways a component (object or function) can directly access its dependencies: # The component can create the dependency, typically using the \`new\` operator. # The component can look up the dependency, by referring to a global variable. # The component can have the dependency passed to it where it is needed. The first two options of creating or looking up dependencies are not optimal because they hard code the dependency to the component. This makes it difficult, if not impossible, to modify the dependencies. This is especially problematic in tests, where it is often desirable to provide mock dependencies for test isolation. The third option is the most viable, since it removes the responsibility of locating the dependency from the component. The dependency is simply handed to the component. function SomeClass(greeter) { this.greeter = greeter; } SomeClass.prototype.doSomething = function(name) { this.greeter.greet(name); } In the above example \`SomeClass\` is not concerned with creating or locating the greeter dependency, it is simply handed the greeter when it is instantiated. This is desirable, but it puts the responsibility of getting hold of the dependency on the code that constructs \`SomeClass\`. To manage the responsibility of dependency creation, each AngularJS application has an injector. The injector is a service locator that is responsible for construction and look-up of dependencies. Here is an example of using the injector service: // Provide the wiring information in a module var myModule = angular.module('myModule', []); // Teach the injector how to build a greeter service. // greeter is dependent on the $window service. // The greeter service is an object that // contains a greet method. myModule.factory('greeter', function($window) { return { greet: function(text) { $window.alert(text); } }; }); Create a new injector that can provide components defined in the \`myModule\` module and request our greeter service from the injector. (This is usually done automatically by the AngularJS bootstrap). var injector = angular.injector(['myModule', 'ng']); var greeter = injector.get('greeter'); Asking for dependencies solves the issue of hard coding, but it also means that the injector needs to be passed throughout the application. Passing the injector breaks the Law of Demeter. To remedy this, we use a declarative notation in our HTML templates, to hand the responsibility of creating components over to the injector, as in this example: Hello function MyController($scope, greeter) { $scope.sayHello = function() { greeter.greet('Hello World'); }; } When AngularJS compiles the HTML, it processes the \`ng-controller\` directive, which in turn asks the injector to create an instance of the controller and its dependencies. injector.instantiate(MyController); This is all done behind the scenes. Because the \`ng-controller\` defers to the injector to instantiate the class, it can satisfy all of the dependencies of \`MyController\` without the controller ever knowing about the injector. The application code simply declares the dependencies it needs, without having to deal with the injector. This setup does not break the Law of Demeter.

He came to the notice of Robert E. Lee while serving briefly as his quartermaster, and was given a brigade in the Third Corps of the Army of Northern Virginia commanded by A.P. Hill, whose division he commanded when the latter was wounded at Chancellorsville. He is generally blamed for accidentally starting the Battle of Gettysburg by sending half his division into the town before the rest of the army was fully prepared. Later in the day, Confederate troops succeeded in routing a Union corps, but at a heavy cost in casualties, including Heth himself. Heth continued to command his division during the remainder of the war and briefly took command of the Third Corps in April 1865 after the death of General Hill. Heth surrendered with the rest of Lee's army on April 9. Early life Henry Heth was born at Black Heath in Chesterfield County, Virginia, son of United States Navy Captain John Heth, and Margaret L. Pickett. He was a cousin of George Pickett. He usually went by \\"Harry\\", the name also preferred by his grandfather, American Revolutionary War Colonel Henry Heth, who had established the Heth family in the coal business in the Virginia Colony after serving in the American Revolution. (The name Heth is pronounced like \\"Heath\\".) Henry Heth was born and raised in Virginia, as were both of his parents, and all four of his grandparents. Heth was wounded at West Point in 1846 with a bayonet stab to his leg. He graduated from the United States Military Academy at the bottom of his class in 1847 (like his cousin George the year before). He was commissioned a brevet second lieutenant and assigned to the 1st Infantry Regiment. His antebellum career was served primarily in western posts, some as a quartermaster. He was serving as a first lieutenant in the 6th Infantry when John C. Symmes III refused a captaincy in the new 10th Infantry on March 3, 1855, and Heth was appointed in his place. He played a prominent role in the 1855 Battle of Ash Hollow, leading a company of mounted infantry against the Lakota. In 1858, he created the first marksmanship manual for the Army. Civil War Heth as a member of the Confederate Army After the war began at Fort Sumter, Heth resigned from the U.S. Army and joined the Confederate States Army, where he was promoted to lieutenant colonel. His initial assignment was to muster and drill regiments of state militia in southwestern Virginia. In June, he was promoted to colonel. Born in Virginia's Tidewater region, Heth was unpopular with the mountain farmers and was known as a strict disciplinarian. In turn, Heth was frustrated by the illiteracy and lack of discipline of his men, as well as General John B. Floyd's actions as commanding officer in the region. Heth wrote of Floyd, \\"I soon discovered that my chief was as incapacitated for the work he had undertaken as I would have been to lead an Italian opera.\\" Under Floyd, Heth led his regiment in the battles of Kessler's Cross Lanes and Carnifex Ferry. His brief service as General Robert E. Lee's quartermaster in the Virginia Provisional Army led to a close friendship between the two officers, Heth being one of the few generals whom Lee called by his first name. He spent the remainder of 1861 in the Kanawha Valley in western Virginia in the 5th and 45th Virginia Infantry regiments. He was promoted to brigadier general on January 6, 1862. In the spring of 1862 Heth was in command of the \\"Army of the New River,\\" (in actuality the 22nd and 45th Virginia Infantry regiments, with attached cavalry and artillery). Heth's diminutive force held off the forces of General Jacob D. Cox at Giles (County) Courthouse (May 10, 1862) and pursued the enemy to Lewisburg, where Heth was forced to withdraw (May 23, 1862). The actions were critical to keeping federal forces tied up and out of the southern Shenandoah Valley while Stonewall Jackson was conducting his own campaign 120 miles to the North. Despite the small size of his force, Heth submitted his reports as an army commander and had his regimental commanders write their own as \\"brigade\\" commanders, possibly assisting in the eventual promotion of Heth to major general. He was then sent west to the Department of East Tennessee, to serve under Edmund Kirby Smith. During the Kentucky Campaign, he was sent by Smith to take a division north from Lexington, Kentucky, to make a demonstration on Cincinnati; although this caused a great commotion in the city's defenses, only a few skirmishes occurred.Noe, pp. 86-87. Smith's portion of the army was spread too far north in Kentucky to consolidate with Bragg's portion in time for the Battle of Perrysville. Bragg ordered the withdrawal of Confederate forces back to Tennessee, and Smith was subsequently transferred to the Trans-Mississippi Department, his forces again missing a vital battle at Stones River. In March 1863, Lee, commanding the Army of Northern Virginia then-positioned at Fredericksburg, recalled Heth to Virginia to serve as a brigade commander in Maj. Gen. A.P. Hill's division. He fought in the Battle of Chancellorsville, showing aggressive, but misguided, qualities in his first large-scale combat, attacking without reserves against a Union force emerging from the Wilderness. Heth assumed command of Hill's division after Hill assumed corps command after Stonewall Jackson's wounding. Following the death of Jackson, Lee reorganized his army into three corps, promoting Hill to the Third Corps. Heth retained his division command and was promoted to major general on May 24, 1863. An illustration of Confederate troops at Gettysburg on July 1, 1863 Heth's division made history by inadvertently starting the Battle of Gettysburg. Marching east from Cashtown on July 1, 1863, Heth sent two brigades ahead in a reconnaissance in force. His memoirs referred to sending them in a search of shoes in Gettysburg, but some historians consider this an apocryphal story; they say Heth knew that Jubal A. Early had been in Gettysburg a few days earlier and any available shoes would have been taken at that time. They also consider sending two brigades on such a mission would have been wasteful. The brigades made contact with Union cavalry under Brig. Gen. John Buford and spread out into battle formation. Lee had ordered A.P. Hill to avoid a general engagement with the enemy before he could assemble his full army, but Heth's actions had now rendered that order moot. They were engaged and Union reinforcements started arriving quickly. Heth's decision to deploy his two brigades before the arrival of the rest of his division was an error as well; they were repulsed in hard fighting against an elite division of the Army of the Potomac's I Corps, including the famously tenacious Iron Brigade. After a lull in fighting, Heth brought two more brigades into the fray in the afternoon and the Union forces were driven back to Seminary Ridge, but principally because the XI Corps' right flank was crushed by Richard S. Ewell's corps coming in from the north. Finally, Heth attacked again in conjunction with the division of Maj. Gen. Robert E. Rodes and the Union corps were routed, retreating back through town to Cemetery Hill. But Confederate losses were severe; Heth should have better coordinated his attack with the division of Maj. Gen. Dorsey Pender. Heth was wounded during the attack when a bullet struck him in the head. However, he was wearing a hat that was too large and stuffed with papers to make it fit. The papers probably deflected the bullet to avoid a fatal wound, but Heth was knocked unconscious and effectively out of the battle. Parts of his division, under the command of Brig. Gen. Johnston Pettigrew, saw more action two days later in Pickett's Charge and he recovered enough to command during the retreat back to Virginia and the minor engagements of the fall of 1863. Harry Heth commanded his division through the 1864 Overland Campaign. At the Battle of the Wilderness, his men were on the front line of A.P. Hill's corps, which blunted Union attacks on the Orange Plank Road. In the subsequent Battle of Spotsylvania Court House, his division was held primarily in the rear, and was positioned on the Confederate left flank at the Battles of North Anna and Cold Harbor. Heth also participated in the Siege of Petersburg, playing direct roles in the battles of Globe Tavern; Second Ream's Station; Peeble's Farm; Boydton Plank Road; and Hatcher's Run. Following the death of Gen. A.P. Hill on April 2, 1865, Heth briefly took over command of the Third Corps. Heth's troops, now led by Gen. John R. Cooke, were pushed back at the Battle of Sutherland's Station. Heth led the remainder of his troops in the Appomattox Campaign, fighting at Cumberland Church and retreating to Appomattox Court House, where he surrendered with Lee on April 9, 1865. Postbellum years After the war, Heth worked in the insurance business and later served the government as a surveyor and in the Office of Indian Affairs. He died in Washington, D.C., and is buried in Hollywood Cemetery in Richmond, Virginia. Heth served as the first Commander of the Centennial Legion of Historic Military Commands when it was founded in 1876.Centennial Legion of Historic Military Commands web site.

It is owned and operated by the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign and is named for former University of Illinois president Arthur Cutts Willard.  History  The airport was dedicated on 26 October 1945. Airline flights began in 1954. The terminal building built in 1960Urbana Courier clipping file was used until the present terminal was completed in 1987.University Office for Facilities Planning and Programs: Willard Airport By 1969 Willard was the second-busiest airport in the state of Illinois. After the Airline Deregulation Act of 1978 many airlines found service to small airports to be inefficient, the price differential to airfares from major hub airports such as Chicago O'Hare grew, which limited demand for tickets from Willard and caused airlines to leave. Until 2014, the airport was home to the University of Illinois Institute of Aviation, a research and pilot training facility. The university trustees voted to shutter the institute in 2011 while allowing enrolled students to complete their studies. In 2013, the university agreed to transfer the pilot training function of the institute to Parkland College, a local community college. The university continues to operate the airport and provides an annual subsidy of $433,000 for its operations. Traffic at Willard airport declined significantly from 2005 to 2013. According to FAA published data, in CY2013 there were 84,853 passenger enplanements compared to 132,077 in 2005. Overall traffic also declined to 54,653 total Combined TRACON / Tower operations in CY 2013 compared to 123,341 in CY2005. The airport has had various problems with delays recently. In 2013, the airport ranked 285th out of 320 airports for on- time performance according to government statistics and was ranked 251st out of 324 airports for the first 11 months of 2014. The airport gained some notoriety for a January 21, 1998, incident in which Air Force One became stuck in mud, requiring a backup aircraft to transport President Bill Clinton from a speaking engagement at the University of Illinois' Assembly Hall. The pilot opted to enter the main taxiway from the ramp using a feeder taxiway with an unusually large angle. Due to the wide turn, the right main gear left the taxiway and slipped into the soft turf, causing the aircraft to be lodged in the mud. The Air Force dispatched backup aircraft SAM26000, which first entered service during the Kennedy Administration and would be retired later in 1998.  Facilities  Willard Airport covers and has three runways: * Runway 4/22: , concrete * Runway 14L/32R: , concrete with ILS * Runway 14R/32L: , asphalt The terminal has five gates.  Airlines and destinations  Terminal building at Willard Airport American Eagle has two daily flights (one on Saturdays) to Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport on 50-seat ERJs, four daily (three on Saturdays) ERJ flights to Chicago's O'Hare International Airport, and twice daily non-stop to Charlotte Douglas International Airport on ERJ 140s. Delta Air Lines dropped Willard Airport on August 31, 2010. Vision Airlines also ceased service to Willard Airport on January 6, 2012 after three weeks of service.http://www.news-gazette.com/news/politics-and- government/2011-12-18/visions-final-flight-just-weeks-after-first.html United Airlines as well ceased service to Willard Airport on September 5, 2018 after a year of service. Ground transportation Four car rental agencies have offices in the terminal building. The airport is reached from U.S. Route 45, five miles south of downtown Champaign. The nearest expressway exit is Exit 229 (Monticello Road) on Interstate 57, about a four-mile drive from the terminal. Parking facilities include a paid parking lot, rental car parking lot, and curbside loading zone. Economic impact In 2016, the Champaign County Economic Development Corporation commissioned an Economic Impact Report with support from community sponsors. The report found that the airport had a total of $74,325,994 annual economic impact and a $204,000 daily impact within Champaign County. The 23,266 visitors coming to the area each year because of the airport helped created 112.8 jobs locally. Further, the airport was found to generate $10.2 million in annual tax receipts, $2.3 million in annual local taxes. More than $800,000 of these local tax dollars goes to local schools.

Carcinisation (or carcinization) is an example of convergent evolution in which a crustacean evolves into a crab-like form from a non-crab-like form. The term was introduced into evolutionary biology by L. A. Borradaile, who described it as \\"one of the many attempts of Nature to evolve a crab\\". PDF Examples Carcinisation is believed to have occurred independently in at least five groups of decapod crustaceans: * King crabs, which most scientists believe evolved from hermit crab ancestors * Porcelain crabs, which are closely related to squat lobsters * The hairy stone crab (Lomis hirta) * The coconut crab (Birgus latro) * True crabs (Brachyura) A prehistoric example is the extinct crustacean order Cyclida, which evolved their crab-like morphology before the existence of true crabs. King crabs A Red king crab in the collection of the Children's Museum of Indianapolis. The example of king crabs (family Lithodidae) evolving from hermit crabs has been particularly well studied, and evidence in their biology supports this theory. For example, most hermit crabs are asymmetrical, so that they fit well into spiral snail shells; the abdomens of king crabs, even though they do not use snail shells for shelter, are also asymmetrical. Hypercarcinisation An exceptional form of carcinisation, termed \\"hypercarcinisation\\", is seen in the porcelain crab Allopetrolisthes spinifrons. In addition to the shortened body form, A. spinifrons also shows similar sexual dimorphism to that seen in true crabs, where males have a shorter pleon than females.

In the seventh term of the European Parliament, he works in the European Conservatives and Reformists group; he is a member of European Conservatives and Reformists Group Executive and a member of the group Bureau. He was formerly vice- president of the now defunct Union for a Europe of Nations group. Background Zīle was born in Riga on 20 June 1958 and gained his first education in the Riga 25th high school. After graduating in 1976, Zīle continued his education at the University of Latvia, Faculty of Economics, culminating in a Baccalaureate degree in Economics in 1981. In 1983, Zīle began part-time studies at the Latvian Institute of Agriculture and Agricultural Economics. During the period between 1992 and 1994, Zīle interned at the Iowa State University in the USA, at the Brandon University in Canada, and at the La Trobe University in Australia. Finally, in 1997 Zīle gained a Doctorate degree of Economics from the Latvian University of Agriculture. Early career Zīle began his career in 1980 as editor of the publishing house \\"Avots\\". From 1982 until 1986 Zīle was a research fellow, later appointed to head of unit, at the Latvian State Institute of Agrarian Economics. From 1989 to 1993, Zīle was editor of the economics section of the Citizens' Congress of the Republic of Latvia newspaper \\"Citizen\\" (\\"Pilsonis\\") and the LNNK newspaper \\"National Independence\\" (\\"Nacionālā Neatkarība\\"). Political Career in Latvia Zīle began his political career in 1990, when he became member of the executive institution of the Latvian Citizens' Congress, the Committee of Latvia. In 1994, Zīle ran in the Riga City Council elections from the \\"For Fatherland and Freedom\\" party's list. After being a deputy in the Riga City Council, he became an assistant to Ilmārs Dāliņš, a member of the 5th Saeima (Parliament of Latvia). In 1995, Zīle was himself elected in the 6th Saeima from the \\"For Fatherland and Freedom\\" list. He worked there as a member of the European Affairs committee and the Budget and Finance committee. Later, Zīle became chairman of the Budget and Finance committee. In February 1997, Zīle became Minister of Finance of Latvia under Prime Minister Andris Šķēle. The position was extended from July 1997 to November 1998 in the government of Guntars Krasts. In October 1998, Zīle was elected to the 7th Saeima from the recently founded political Union's \\"For Fatherland and Freedom\\"/LNNK (TB/LNNK) list. In the 7th Saeima, Zīle continued his work in the European Affairs committee and the Budget and Finance committee. Zīle also served as the Minister of Special Affairs for cooperation with international financial institutions in the government of Vilis Krištopans from November 1998 to July 1999, in the government of Andris Šķēle from July 1999 to May 2000, and in the government of Andris Bērziņš from May 2000 to July 2002. In January 2000, Zīle resigned his seat in the Saeima due to a new legislation which banned simultaneous holding of positions of a Minister and a Member of Saeima. In 2002, Zīle was elected to the 8th Saeima from the TB/LNNK list. In November 2002, Zīle resigned from the Parliament, because he was confirmed as a Minister of Transport in the government of Einars Repše. Zīle held this position until March 2004. In July 2006, TB/LNNK nominated Zīle as a candidate for the position of Prime Minister. In December 2006, he was elected chairman of TB/LNNK. In July 2011, upon the creation of the new association of political parties National Alliance \\"All for Latvia!\\" - \\"For Fatherland and Freedom/LNNK\\", Zīle became co-chairman of the association from the TB/LNNK side. In August 2011, he resigned his post as co-chairman, declaring that he wishes to focus his attention on the events in the European Parliament and believes that the leaders of the National Alliance should be based in Latvia. Political career in the European Parliament For the sixth term of the European Parliament, Zīle ran in the 2004 European Parliament elections as representative of TB/LNNK. As a result, he was elected in June 2004 and became Member of the European Parliament (MEP). As MEP, Zīle joined the nationally conservative Union for Europe of the Nations political group, where he served as Vice-President. Zīle worked in the Transport and Tourism committee, the Industry, Research and Energy committee, as well as in the Delegation for Relations with Australia. At the 2009 European Parliament elections, Zīle was the top candidate for the For Fatherland and Freedom/LNNK ticket. He was elected and became MEP in June 2009. Due to the departure of several parties, the Union for Europe of the Nations group was terminated. Zīle thereafter joined the British Conservative party's initiated European Conservatives and Reformists group (ECR), whose largest members include the British Conservative Party, the Czech Civic Democratic Party and the Polish Law and Justice party. He is a member of the European Conservatives and Reformists Group Executive. Zīle currently has been working in the European Parliament's Transport and Tourism committee, the Delegation for Relations with the People's Republic of China, and, as a substitute, in the Economic and Monetary Affairs committee. He was also active in the temporary Special Committee on the Financial and Economic Crisis, created in 2009. The creation of the ECR brought TB/LNNK and Zīle into the political media spotlight in Britain. Left-wing British politicians including the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, David Miliband and Denis MacShane criticised the activities and views of Zīle and his party. Miliband wrote of TB/LNNK \\"its members attend commemorations for the Waffen-SS\\".David Miliband's speech showed rare passion – this was powerful stuff, The Guardian In a response, Shadow Foreign Secretary William Hague demanded an apology to TB/LNNK and the Latvian government from Miliband, describing his remarks as recycling \\"false Soviet propaganda\\" and noting that \\"the majority of parties forming Latvia’s current Government including the Prime Minister’s party, have attended the commemoration of Latvians who fought in the Second World War\\".William Hague demands an apology from Miliband after “disgraceful smears.” Zīle himself wrote a response in the left-wing Guardian newspaper: \\"I am proud of the new European Conservatives and Reformists group we have formed in the European parliament. Its foundations are strong, and the more bile and mud thrown by the leftwing press and domestic opponents, the more united and resolved we have become\\". Academic activities During his career, Zīle has represented Latvia in a variety of international scientific projects, including programmes developed by the FAO, OECD and the European Commission ACE programme. He has published articles and research papers on property rights and agricultural policy issues in the United States of America, Australia, Norway, Finland, Hungary, Slovakia and Germany. Political and social activities Zīle began his political activities as a member of the 18th November Association, Latvian Citizen's Congress and Union \\"For Fatherland and Freedom\\". Simultaneously, he was also active in the Popular Front of Latvia. He is one of the founders of the Economists Association 2010, which was launched in 1994. The Association was created to stimulate economic growth of the national economy and to educate the public on economy issues. The Association is widely known due to its connection with the Spīdola Award. At the moment, Zīle is a Member of the Board of the Association. Zīle has been a member of the board of the \\"Foundation for the Development of Public Ideas -- Think!\\" (\\"Domā!\\") since 2012. The objective of the foundation is to offer and introduce new ideas for the political, economic and social life in Latvia and the EU, based on nationally conservative values. Zile has managed or partly managed three of the conferences organized by the foundation - on the unemployment and quality of life of the Latvian youth in May 2012, on conservative values in the modern world in October 2012, and on drivers of energy sector in the Baltics. Zīle has participated in numerous public guest lectures in universities in Latvia on topics related to the economy and politics of the European Union, as well as various conferences on macroeconomic and energy related issues in the European Parliament. Prior to the 9th Saeima elections Zīle developed an extensive economic reform program (sometimes called Zīle's program), designed to prevent a looming real estate crisis and to create a socially equitable tax system in Latvia, which would be oriented towards productive investments. In the European Parliament, Zīle's current agenda is focused on issues related to the EU transport policy, especially the \\"Rail Baltica\\" railway project; overcoming the economic crisis; the economic governance of the EU and solving banking issues; energy, especially ensuring the energy independence of the Baltic countries from Russia. In Latvian domestic affairs, Zīle has been continuing activities focused on ensuring the long term macroeconomic stability and overhaul of the tax system. His objective is to prevent the creation of a new banking and real estate bubble based on non-resident activities, as well as to decrease the tax burden on labour, especially low income households and families with children. He also advocates tax increase on capital gains and income from speculative activities with real estate, as well as calls for a state aid for the acquisition of residence for new families.

The detention block is shown with sunshades drawn on 3 December 2002. Camp Delta is a permanent American detainment camp at Guantanamo Bay that replaced the temporary facilities of Camp X-Ray. Its first facilities were built between 27 February and mid-April 2002 by Navy Seabees, Marine Engineers, and workers from Halliburton subsidiary Kellogg, Brown and Root. It is composed of detention camps 1 through 6, Camp Platinum, Camp Iguana, the Guantanamo psychiatric ward, Camp Echo and Camp No. The prisoners, referred to as detainees, have uncertain rights due to their location not on American soil. There are allegations of torture and abuse of prisoners. Most of the security forces are U.S. Army military police and U.S. Navy Masters-at-Arms. The camps have different amenities and levels of comfort. Detainees are quartered in different parts of Camp Delta according to their level of cooperation with guards and interrogators, with the exception of newly arriving detainees who always go to maximum security in Camp 3. Thereafter, cooperative detainees are moved to Camp 2 and then Camp 1 as rewards for cooperation. When detainees cooperate and are thought to show no security risk they can be moved to the buildings of Camp 4, which have a shower and lavatory, plus four communal living rooms for 10 detainees each. In Camp 4, each detainee has a bed and a locker. Camp 4 detainees may eat their meals together, instead of alone in their own cells as in the other camps, and Camp 4 detainees are set apart by their white jump suits, in contrast to the orange worn by detainees in other camps. In addition to these benefits, detainees are also allowed special meal supplements to their diets, along with longer shower periods and longer exercise periods. Camp one Camp one is one of the camps where the United States held detainees classified as \\"enemy combatants in extrajudicial detention\\". Although the camp was reported to have been closed, Human Rights Watch reported in June 2008 that it currently houses non-compliant detainees. At that time they said the camp held 25 detainees in adjacent cells. Camp three Camp three is one of the camps that held detainees classified as \\"enemy combatants in extrajudicial detention.\\" Although the camp was closed in 2006, Human Rights Watch reported in June 2008 that it was then used to house half a dozen non-compliant detainees who had to be housed in isolation. The detainees' cells were sufficiently isolated from one another that they could not see one another. Camp four Photo taken by the US military shows one of the Camp Four barracks, May 2006 according to the US military Camp four is the camp that most closely resembles a traditional Prisoner of War camp. Captives held there live in communal dormitories, and have day long access to communal exercise yard, games, and books. Camp authorities only allow the captives they considered \\"compliant\\" to stay in camp four and they are allowed to wear white or tan uniforms which distinguish them from the orange uniforms \\"non- compliant\\" captives wear. Camp five A camp five cell GIs inspect every detainee every three minutes. According to Commander Jeff Hayhurst, deputy commander of the Guard force, \\"...the camp opened in 2004, cost $17.5 million. It's modeled on a max security facility in Terre Haute, Indiana.\\" The camp was built by Kellogg, Brown and Root. Hayhurst said that the camp was used to hold the most non-compliant detainees. In September 2006, National Public Radio reported that the camp could hold 100 detainees, and was about half full. Initially the press was told the fourteen \\"high value detainees\\" transferred from CIA custody on 5 September 2006 were held in Camp five. But they were in fact held in a small, secret, ultra high security facility – Camp seven. The Department of Defense reports that Mohammad Ahmed Abdullah Saleh Al Hanashi committed suicide in camp five on 1 June 2009.  Camp Five Echo  Camp Five Echo is a \\"disciplinary block\\" for \\"non-compliant\\" prisoners. Lawyers claim that the cells are too small to be regarded as humane, that the toilets are inadequate, the lights are too bright and the air in the cells is foul. The cells are only half the size of the cells in Camp Five and have squat toilets in the floor instead of standard prison toilets. David Remes described Camp Five Echo in 2011 as violating the Geneva Conventions, and called it \\"a throwback to the bad old days at Guantánamo.\\" Camp six Camp six, under construction Camp six detainees are shackled to the floor when they watch TV. Camp Six, constructed by Halliburton, was modeled on US Federal medium- security penitentiaries. It was constructed to have individual cells that surrounded and looked in on a communal mess area, where it was planned compliant detainees could interact for part of the day. However, while the building was still under construction, the decision was made to confine all detainees to their cells, except when they were taken to shower, taken for solitary exercise, or for official business. The communal areas were left unused. This transformed the facility to a high-security facility. In April 2010 The Guardian published a photo essay that showed that a TV had been installed in the common areas. Detainees were shackled to the floor during their TV privileges. Camp seven Camp Seven, also known as Camp Platinum, is an isolated outpost, strictly off-limits from the Pentagon's media tour. A group of six mostly military lawyers representing prisoners at Camp seven concluded in February 2012 that the conditions at the camp fall short of the minimum guarantees of humane treatment under the Geneva Conventions.

History  *During Korea ruled by Japan During the Japanese occupation of Korea the Japanese exported pork from Korea- the preference in Japan was for cuts that could be readily used for the production of Tonkatsu. As a result, pork belly was left in Korea and became a popular meat there as a result.  Etymology  Directly translated from Korean, samgyeop-sal () means \\"three layer flesh,\\" referring to striations of lean meat and fat in the pork belly that appear as three layers when cut. In Korea, the word samgyeop-sal, meaning \\"pork belly\\", often refers to samgyeop- sal-gui (grilled pork belly), in the same way that the word galbi, meaning \\"ribs\\", often refers to galbi-gui (grilled beef ribs). Gui refers to roasted, baked, or grilled dishes. One can also find ogyeopsal (), with an o meaning \\"five\\". Ogyeop-sal includes the skin part of the pork belly, unlike samgyeop- sal where the skin is removed. This corresponds with the Chinese word for pork belly, wǔ huā ròu () or \\"five flower meat\\", as the Chinese pork belly usually includes the rind.  Preparation  Samgyeopsal on a charcoal grill Cooked samgyeopsal being cut with scissors Thick, fatty slices of pork belly, sometimes with the skin left on and sometimes scored on the diagonal, are grilled on a slanted metal griddle or a gridiron at the diners' table, inset with charcoal grills or convex gas burners. Usually, diners grill the meat themselves, flipping and cutting them with tongs and scissors, and eat directly from the grill. The meat is usually neither marinated nor seasoned, although marinated samgyeopsal in flavors such as ginseng, wine, garlic, herbs, curry, doenjang, and gochujang has gained popularity since the late 2000s. Slices of garlic, onions, green chili peppers, mushrooms, and kimchi are often grilled alongside using the fat trickling from the pork belly. Common accompaniments for samgyeopsal include ssam vegetables such as lettuce, kkaennip (perilla leaves), ssammu (pickled radish paper) and dipping sauces such as ssamjang (made with seasoned mixture of chili paste and soy bean paste) and gireum-jang (made with sesame oil, salt, and black pepper), jangajji (soy sauce-pickled vegetables) such as myeongi-jangajji (pickled Siberian onion leaves) or yangpa-jangajji (pickled onions), kimchi, as well as sliced garlic, onions, and seasoned shredded scallions. Garlic, onions, and kimchi can be either grilled with the meat or consumed raw with the cooked meat. Mushrooms, such as button mushrooms or oyster mushrooms, are also grilled with the meat.  Consumption  Grilled meat is placed on fresh and/or pickled leaves of vegetables, with some ssamjang, and rolled up to make ssam (wrap) which is eaten in one mouthful. Any combination of accompaniments mentioned above can be added to the roll according to preference, most popularly sliced garlic. Cooked rice, stews such as kimchi-jjigae and doenjang-jjigae, as well as naengmyeon (cold noodles), can be served as meals. Sometimes, leftover meat is mixed with rice, gim-garu (seaweed flakes), and seasonings to make bokkeum-bap (fried rice) at the end. Samgyeopsal is often accompanied by, or accompanying (as anju) shots of soju.

She is co- chairwoman of the Latvian Russian Union and sits with the European Greens–European Free Alliance group. In the period of 1988-1989 she was one of the leaders of the Interfront, a political organization opposing Latvia's independence from the Soviet Union and too rapid market reforms. She remained active in the Communist Party of Latvia after January 1991, when the party leadership called for a coup against the government of the Latvian SSR (in opposition to a restoration of independence). In 1997 Tatjana Ždanoka was elected to Riga municipal council. In 1999 she was deprived of the mandate in the Council and is prohibited from further nomination for election to the Latvian Parliament or local councils under Latvian law due to her former allegiance with the Communist Party after January 1991. She is (with Alfrēds Rubiks) in the peculiar position of being restricted to Europarliament elections. Ždanoka has been co-chairwoman of the LRU and its predecessors since 2001.  Background  Born 1950 in Riga, Ždanoka is of mixed Latvian Jewish-Russian origin. The family of her father was decimated by Latvian Nazi collaborators during World War II.Lieven, Anatol. The Baltic Revolution: Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and the Path to Independence. New Haven, Connecticut: Yale University Press, 1994. , . P. 442. \\"Zdhanoka, Tatiana: Born 1953. From a Riga Jewish family murdered by Latvian Nazi auxiliaries in 1941.\\"  Politician  Ždanoka became politically active in the late 1980s, at first a member of the Popular Front, she soon became one of the leaders of the Interfront, a political organization opposing Latvia's independence from the Soviet Union and too rapid market reforms. Prior to that, she taught mathematics at the University of Latvia, where she received her doctorate in mathematics in 1992. In 1989, she was elected to the Riga City Council, and in 1990, to the Supreme Soviet of the Latvian SSR. Ždanoka was also active with the Communist Party of Latvia but never belonged to this party nomenclature. From 1995 till 2004 Ždanoka was co-chairwoman of the Latvian Human Rights Committee (a member of FIDH). She has also been one of the leaders of Equal Rights since it foundation in 1993 and of the For Human Rights in United Latvia alliance. In 1999 Ždanoka was banned from running for the Latvian parliament Saeima and deprived of her seat on Riga City Council, because she had participated in two seats of the Communist Party's Audit Committee after the party leadership called for a coup against the elected government of the Latvian SSR in January 1991. Subsequently, she sued Latvia in the European Court of Human Rights. With the court case pending, the Latvian parliament decided not to impose restrictions on former members of the Communist Party in the 2004 European Parliament elections. Ždanoka was elected to the European Parliament in June 2004 and won the court case a few days later with a margin of 5-2. Latvia appealed the decision to the Grand Chamber of the European Court of Human Rights on the grounds that Latvia's emergence from totalitarian rule brought about by the occupation of Latvia had not been sufficiently taken into account, and on March 16, 2006, the court ruled 13-4 that Ždanoka's rights had not been violated. The Court also called the Latvian legislature to \\"keep the statutory restriction under constant review, with a view to bringing it to an early end (..) the failure by the Latvian legislature to take active steps in this connection may result in a different finding by the Court\\".ECtHR Grand Chamber judgment in Ždanoka v. Latvia para. 135 In 2005 Ždanoka became one of the founders of the EU Russian-Speakers' Alliance. In 2004, she ran successfully for MEP as a candidate of the largest Russian political bloc in Latvia. She also won a seat in 2009. In the European Parliament she was a member of the fraction The Greens–European Free Alliance. In 2014 Ždanoka took part in the controversial Crimean referendum as an \\"international observer\\" in a trip paid by the European Union. Her support for the referendum outcome of Crimea’s accession to Russia and other remarks were scolded by the president of the European Parliament Martin Schulz as being \\"completely contradictory to the position of the European Parliament and the EU.\\" who said that she had \\"absolutely no right and certainly no mandate from this Parliament to make such comments on its behalf.\\" Ždanoka responded by pointing out that Schulz is an MEP \\"just like she is\\", and that only her voters can tell her what to do. Co-chairwoman of the Greens/European Free Alliance Rebecca Harms deemed Ždanoka's actions and statements as \\"totally unacceptable\\" and \\"in complete and direct opposition with the very clear position the Greens/EFA group has taken since the outset on this issue\\", calling the European Free Alliance to expel Ždanoka from its ranks. Ždanoka's actions were also condemned by the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Latvia Edgars Rinkēvičs, with Ministry's press secretary Kārlis Eihenbaums pointing out that Ždanoka did not to represent Latvia nor the EU, as she did not have any official authorization from Latvian institutions to do so. On March 11, 2014 Ždanoka and her party organized a rally at the European Commission Representation in Riga participated by about 200 people who expressed support for Russians living in Crimea and separation of Crimea from Ukraine. In May, Ždanoka suggested to the European Council to classify Ukrainian political bloc Right Sector as a \\"terrorist organization.\\" In 2016 Ždanoka voted against the European Parliament resolution of 23 November that condemned the use of disinformation and propaganda by Russia and Islamist terrorist organisations and called for strengthening EU’s \\"strategic communication\\" task force, as well as investing more in awareness raising, education, online and local media, investigative journalism and information literacy. Prior to the vote she distributed a letter to other MEPs, saying that the resolution crosses \\"all red lines\\" and that Russia's state-sponsored news and information channels are no different to Western media that exhibit \\"double standards\\", recommending them to watch Russia Today and form their own opinion of the channel. A submission has been made by another Latvian MEP, Kārlis Šadurskis, to the Latvian state prosecutor to investigate Ždanoka for undermining the Latvian state in her support for Russia. In his submission, Šadurskis pointed to her participation at events organised by \\"Essence of Time\\" that advocates the restoration of the USSR. The application of Šadurskis was rejected by Security Police who did not find a crime in Ždanoka's actions. In January 2018 Ždanoka left European Parliament and returned to Latvian politics with the intention of running for 2018 Latvian parliamentary election in October. She was named Latvian Russian Union's #1 ticket for Vidzeme region, however on August 21 Latvia's Central Election Commission removed her from the list of candidates on the same basis that barred her from running in the 1999. Ždanoka contested it in the Administrative District Court, but the court upheld the decision made by the Central Election Commission. On March 5, 2019 State Security Service launched a criminal procedure over incitement to ethnic hatred or discord for Ždanoka's remarks at a discussion organized by her at the European Parliament, where she likened the situation of ethnic Russians and Russian speakers in Latvia to Jews prior the World War II. The case was terminated by the SSS in 2020, for absence of any crime in Ždanoka's remarks.СГБ закрыл дело против Жданок: состав преступления в ее высказываниях не обнаружен DELFI In 2020 Ždanoka, alongside her party members Miroslav Mitrofanov and Andrejs Mamikins, was included in the European Platform for Democratic Elections database of \\"biased observers\\" for backing disputed and rigged elections in Russia and occupied Ukraine Criticism The Jamestown Foundation's political analyst Vladimir Socor has called her a \\"radical\\" opposed to Latvian national statehood.Jamestown Foundation 23 May 2004: Zhdanok Candidacy Polarizes Latvian Election by Vladimir Socor ReferencesExternal links *Ždanoka's résumé at LRU website *Tatjana Ždanoka in the European Parliament *HRUL in European Parliament: Europeanisation of a Soviet Legacy? by A.

It takes the form of a parody of an antiquarian study of an imaginary English town's development. This moves from its muddy Saxon origins -- the Fleet River is the ancient river that runs in sewers under the City of London-- and is profusely illustrated at each turn with Lancaster's caricature architectural views, always showing the same corner of Drayneflete, as it appears through history. Lancaster follows the changing fortunes of the architectural development from village to small city, and wittily captures the foibles and fashions of the inhabitants, all rendered in flawlessly deadpan camp. Lancaster's Drayneflete may have taken its initial hints from a public lecture delivered in 1947 by Sir John Summerson outlining the issues in historic preservation that underlie Lancaster's comedy. Summerson described tongue-in cheek the typical English village's \\"laminations of architecture which would take a whole library of Mumfords to describe in detail:\\" :\\"The 'matrix' is medieval and a few Tudor gables jut out in the High Street; the one where Cromwell is conclusively proved not to have slept is an antique shop; another is the Nell Gwynne Cakery. These are the much- photographed 'old bits' The remainder of the High Street is 70 per cent Georgian--I should, perhaps, say 35 per cent, because the shopfronts have eaten up half the façades and sash windows peer over the enormous flashing fascias of the chain stores...\\"Summerson, John, 1947. \\"The Past in the Future\\" collected in Heavenly Mansions 1948 (paperback 1963) Drayneflete is a fairly high-toned joke, that any reader with some experience of English architecture and the English county way-of-life and the style of English antiquarian notes about parish churches and curious village harvest traditions and the like will recognize. The sensibility resurfaced in Susan Sontag's famous 1964 Partisan Review essay and was broadened for general public consumption. Drayneflete rated an entry in Robert Cowan's Dictionary of Urbanism. 2005 The aesthetic of this haphazard jumble of a collage as an art in its own right, though seen in American contexts, was first set out by Robert Venturi and Robert A. M. Stern in the 1970s and has provided part of the context of post-Modernism.

New York University Professor Keith Vincent has called her a \\"Japanese Electra\\", referring to the Electra complex counterpart put forth by Carl Jung to Sigmund Freud's Oedipal complex. Early life and family Mari Mori was born in Hongō, Tokyo. Her father was novelist Mori Ōgai. Career Mori won the Japan Essayist Club Award in 1957 for a collection of essays called My Father's Hat. She began a movement of writing about male homosexual passion (tanbi shousetsu, literally \\"aesthetic novels\\") in 1961 with A Lovers' Forest, , which won the Tamura Toshiko Prize. Later works include I Don't Go on Sundays (1961) and The Bed of Dead Leaves (1962). She was greatly influenced by her father; in A Lover's Forest, the older man can be seen as imbued with the same virtues and honor as she saw in her father. An older man and younger boy are trademarks of Mori Mari's work. The older man is extremely rich, powerful, wise, and spoils the younger boy. In The Lover's Forest, for example, the older man, Guido, is 38 or so, and Paulo is 17 or 18. (However, he is not yet 19, the age that Mori was when her father died.) Paulo is extraordinarily beautiful, prone to lounge lazily, and has a lack of willpower in all but the field of his pleasure. (Guido dies when Paolo is 19, and Paulo subsequently falls in love with a man who's been waiting in the wings, another one just like Guido.) In 1975 her won the 3rd Izumi Kyōka Prize for Literature. Personal life Her first husband was Tamaki Yamada, whom she married in 1919 and divorced in 1927. Her second husband was Akira Sato 佐藤彰. Mori Mari died of heart failure on 6 June 1987.

Springsteen has often played the song in a full band arrangement in concert. Background Springsteen chose the title \\"Fistful of Dollars\\" from the Clint Eastwood movie, and recorded two demos in April 1981 at his home in Colts Neck, New Jersey. He recorded another demo in late 1981, this time changing the title to \\"Atlantic City\\". He recorded at least five takes on his Portastudio at Colts Neck during a two- week period, December 17 to January 3, 1982, with take three chosen for Nebraska. In a letter to Jon Landau, Springsteen noted that \\"this song should probably be done with the whole band really rockin' out\\". At The Power Station on April 26–28, 1982, with the E Street Band during the 'Electric Nebraska' sessions, Springsteen spent three days trying to make a rock record out of the demo. Landau insisted on releasing the solo version, \\"No way was it as good as what he had goin' on that demo tape\\". History Springsteen wrote in his Greatest Hits sleeve notes that he recorded the track in his bedroom \\"for $1,050 (the cost of the four-track Tascam recorder), mixed through an old Gibson guitar unit to a beat box\\". He provides the vocals, guitar, harmonica, tambourine, organ, and synthesizer for the song. The song depicts a young couple's escape to Atlantic City, New Jersey, but it also wrestles with the inevitability of death as the man in the relationship intends to take a job in organized crime upon arriving in the city. The opening lines of \\"Atlantic City\\" refer to mafia violence in nearby Philadelphia, with Springsteen singing: \\"Well, they blew up the chicken man in Philly last night/Now they blew up his house too.\\" The phrase \\"chicken man\\" refers to Philadelphia crime family mafia boss Philip Testa, who was killed by a rival gang operator who planted a bomb in his Philadelphia house in March 1981. The song evokes the widespread uncertainty regarding gambling during its early years in Atlantic City and its promises to resurrect the city, as well as the young man's uncertainty about taking the less-than-savory job: \\"Everything dies, baby, that's a fact, but maybe everything that dies someday comes back.\\" The song is also included on his 1995 Greatest Hits album and on the 2003 compilation The Essential Bruce Springsteen. \\"8 Years\\", a 2006 episode of the television series Cold Case, was based around nine Springsteen songs, with \\"Atlantic City\\" played during its climactic murder scene. In 2012 following Hurricane Sandy, New Jersey Governor Chris Christie quoted the song's chorus during a cameo on Saturday Night Live. The song plays over the opening of episode 3 of season 4 of Billions. A few scenes later, the character \\"Dollar\\" Bill Stern (played by Kelly AuCoin) sings the opening lines of the song. Music video A music video, directed by Arnold Levine, was produced for \\"Atlantic City\\", which received moderate play on MTV in the United States. Springsteen does not appear in the video, which features stark, black-and-white images of Atlantic City. The video also contained clips of the demolition of the main dome of the Marlborough-Blenheim Hotel. Other versions The Band covered the song for their 1993 album Jericho. Rolling Stone called it a \\"clear highlight\\". After the Band split up, Levon Helm continued to perform \\"Atlantic City\\" in his solo performances. Country artist Riley Green covered the song on his 2018 EP County Line. Live performances From the Born in the U.S.A. Tour on, \\"Atlantic City\\" has made fairly regular appearances in Springsteen's band concerts, with a soft-hard-cycle arrangement very similar to that of \\"Darkness on the Edge of Town\\". Such live versions appear on Springsteen's In Concert/MTV Plugged (1993) and Live in New York City (2001) albums. For the 2006 Bruce Springsteen with The Seeger Sessions Band Tour, \\"Atlantic City\\" was drastically rearranged and featured multiple outros; as such it appears on the Live in Dublin (2007) album.

Sayers' novels and short stories featuring Lord Peter Wimsey.  Literary Background  Dorothy L. Sayers (1893–1957) wrote a number of novels and short stories concerning the adventures of a fictional private detective called Lord Peter Wimsey who had his genesis in a Sexton Blake story Sayers wrote in 1920.See http://www.greenbay.co.uk/books/Witham.html The first Wimsey story was published in 1923, and the last by Sayers alone in 1937. Other stories based on original material were published under the authorship of Sayers and Jill Paton Walsh, the last appearing in 2013.The Late Scholar (Paperback) , The action of the original stories takes place between 1921 and 1937; the books in co-authorship extend this period through the Second World War and into the 1950s. During this whole period, Lord Peter has a manservant called Mervyn Bunter, and in him Sayers created a fictional persona that is fascinating and enigmatic. Sayers admitted having partially based Bunter's character on P. G. Wodehouse's Jeeves, although Wimsey and Bunter are quite distinct from Wooster and Jeeves. He is the ultimate \\"Gentleman's Gentleman\\". Bunter ensures that his master is perfectly dressed, he cooks excellent meals, he is knowledgeable regarding spirits, wines and cigars and is faultless when dealing with social etiquette, whether concerning dukes or tramps. Bunter conveys an air of awesome solemn dignity lightened at rare intervals by an icy sarcasm and an understated but biting criticism. He uses carefully correct and sometimes stilted English (in Five Red Herrings he talks of having \\"attended the cinematograph\\" rather than \\"gone to the cinema\\"). He has an unexpected talent for music-hall mimicry (The Nine Tailors),Sayers, D.L.: \\"The Nine Tailors\\" Coronet Press, 1934. and assists Lord Peter in the purchase of rare books and the solving of crimes.  Bunter as manservant  If Lord Peter is in the top rank of society, being a friend of the Prince of Wales (Clouds of Witness and Thrones, Dominations),Sayers, D.L.: \\"Clouds of Witness\\" Coronet Press, 1926Sayers, D.L.& Walsh, J.P.: \\"Thrones, Dominations\\" Hodder & Staunton,1998. then Bunter is a prince among domestic staff. As a gentleman's gentleman, or valet, he is the functional equivalent of a butler and his rank reflects that of his master. He insists on being called \\"Mr Bunter\\" by all other servants and tradesmen (for example Frank Crutchley in Busman's Honeymoon). Other domestics respect his position, and his personal appearance, severely impeccable clothes and bowler hat combined with rigidly correct manners allow him to impress cooks and susceptible maids.Sayers, D.L.: \\"Whose Body?\\" Cornet Press, 1923. (Whose Body?). Even in the small hours of the morning he can be found \\"dressed with an impeccability worthy of Inigo Jones\\". (Busman's Honeymoon).Sayers, D. L.:\\"Busman's Honeymoon\\" New English Library 1937. His Olympian calm is monumental and gives way only twice. A very minor instance is told by a penitent Bunter after a maid is caught polishing a beer bottle taken as evidence (The Nine Tailors). The one great explosion is in Busman's Honeymoon when Mrs Ruddle stands all the bottles of Cockburn '96 port upright, and washes them clean. So great is his anger that not only does he refer to the cleaner as a \\"… lousy old nosy-parking bitch!\\" but he also, for the only time, drops an h.  Bunter as assistant detective  Although he is not allowed crime-solving leaps of imagination, Bunter also regularly assists in the routine processes of deduction, undertaking tasks not suitable for a lord. He has advanced photographic skills and possesses not only a wide-angled lens but also a spy camera hidden in his pocket (The Entertaining Episode of the Article in Question).Sayers, D.L.:\\"The Entertaining Episode of the Article in Question\\" in \\"Lord Peter Views the Body\\" Coronet, 1928. He will photograph crime scenes and fingerprints as well as follow suspects, checking alibis and the like. He is allowed to comment on the progress of each case.  Bunter, Lord Peter and Harriet Vane  Sergeant Bunter had been Major Wimsey's batman, or personal servant, during the Great War. They served in the Rifle Brigade, one of the prestigious units of the \\"Old Army\\". In October or November 1918 Wimsey was buried in a dug-out by a shell, and was rescued (Clouds of Witness) by Bunter, among others. Several times afterwards, Bunter saved Wimsey's life, notably from quicksand in Yorkshire (Clouds of Witness). Immediately after the war, Bunter arrived to take up service, as promised, with Lord Peter. Like many other soldiers, Wimsey was afflicted with shell shock. He had nightmares, delusions, and a morbid fear of giving orders, having ordered so many men to their deaths. Bunter took him in hand, devoted himself to his recovery, and became indispensable as a servant, fellow-investigator and intimate. However dependent Wimsey might be on Bunter, there is never any doubt as to who is in charge, and Bunter, though firm on the points of dressing well, never oversteps the line. However, it is the opinion of Lord Peter's mother, the Dowager Duchess, that \\"It's that wonderful man of his who keeps him in order...so intelligent...a perfect autocrat\\" (Strong Poison).Sayers, D.L.:\\"Strong Poison.\\" Coronet, 1930. The main negative thing to be said about Bunter is that he seems to have no other interest in life than serving Lord Peter; he is even ready to give up marriage rather than leave (Thrones, Dominations). However, this attitude must be seen in the context of early 20th century society, not that of the 21st century. In Strong Poison, Dorothy L. Sayers begins her exploration of Peter Wimsey's strange courtship and marriage to Harriet Vane. One effect of this is to eclipse Bunter, whose role reduces to that of the perfect servant in the background. In Busman's Honeymoon the relationships of this odd triangle are worked out. Harriet cannot believe she has married Peter until Bunter calls her \\"Your Ladyship\\". Peter, utterly dependent on Bunter, is relieved when the latter accepts the new mistress. Bunter seems to accept the situation docilely, but is justified and consoled when Wimsey turns to him, not to Harriet, for assistance at a major breakthrough in the case. However, at the end of the case, when the culprit is to be hanged and Peter's nerves threaten to give way, Bunter and Harriet join forces to save him. Bunter was rewarded in a literary fashion by eventually marrying and having a child (Thrones, Dominations). This marriage is not the work of Miss Sayers, but of Miss Paton Walsh, who also gives him a son, Peter Meredith, born in December 1937. Peter attends Eton College, being in the same house as Wimsey's son Bredon (it is not stated how the fees are financed) and is a budding economist.  Biography  1850: Birth of Bunter's mother, who lived at least until 1936 (Thrones, Dominations); his father seems to have died earlier. The family were conventionally religious: Bunter quotes from the Bible and prayer book and attends Church of England services; he is very High Church (Thrones, Dominations). c. 1880–1889: Mervyn was born in Kent, one of seven; a brother was called Meredith (Clouds of Witness and Thrones, Dominations); Lord Peter was born in 1890 and is described as being the younger (Whose Body?). c. 1885–1894: At age 5 he moved to London (Busman's Honeymoon). 1914: Bunter was head footman in the house of Sir John Sanderton (A Presumption of Death)Sayers, D.L.:\\"A Presumption of Death\\" St. Martin's Press, 2002. who, by 1928, had been killed and his family broken up (The Unpleasantness at the Bellona Club).Sayers, D.L.:The Unpleasantness at the Bellona Club, Coronet, 1928. It was in this household that he learned those housekeeping skills so much in evidence later, although how he acquired his skill in cooking, and incredible amounts of information, is a mystery (Busman’s Honeymoon). Although he does say how much he had learned from Wimsey, this might be flattery (Whose Body). 1914: Bunter joined the Rifle Brigade, presumably as a volunteer, and was posted to France. Despite his obvious talents, his social position allowed him to rise no higher than sergeant. 1918 (October): Caudry, near Cambrai, was re-taken from the Germans; and Wimsey with Sergeant Bunter, now his batman, moved into the trenches there. Within a few weeks Wimsey was buried in a dug-out by shell fire, and Bunter was among those who rescued him. 1919 (January): Lord Peter had promised to take Bunter into service, and the ex-sergeant appeared at the ducal residence surprisingly quickly, in January 1919, only three months after the Armistice. 1920: To assist Wimsey's recovery, Bunter found a modern flat in Piccadilly, the heart of fashionable London. The Dowager Duchess later tells Harriet that Bunter knew the recovery was under way when Wimsey \\"demanded\\" a sausage at breakfast (Busman's Honeymoon). As well as having a \\"small apartment\\" for photography and chemistry (Strong Poison) Bunter is paid £200 per year, a very good salary considering he has free board and lodging.

Bunter assists a doctor friend of Wimsey with his photographic skills, then helps to solve the murder. The doctor invites Bunter to join them at lunch; Bunter refuses. \\"Bunter likes me to know my place. Terrorisin' sort of man, Bunter\\", says Lord Peter. 1922/3: The first major investigation is recorded in Whose Body? (published 1923). Although playing a strong supporting part in the case, Bunter is also allowed to be a domestic tyrant: '\\"Not in those trousers, my lord,\\" said Mr Bunter, blocking the way to the door with deferential firmness.' However, in this case the real relationship between Wimsey and Bunter is made clear, as are Bunter's sterling qualities as a servant and as an investigator. His superior standing with other servants is also displayed. 1922/3 (November): Clouds of Witness (published 1926). As Lord Peter is 33, the action takes place in 1922, possibly 1923. Bunter is on holiday with his master and has sacrificed his \\"civilized habits\\" to allow Wimsey to go unwashed and unshaven, and had photographed scenery instead of fingerprints. On their return Lord Peter would casually refer to Bunter having had \\"a regular affair with an inn-keeper's daughter\\" and remark \\"He's an awfully susceptible old beggar. You'd never think it, would you?\\". It is Bunter who sees the newspaper items referring to the Duke's arrest, and they return by air (booked by Bunter) to Yorkshire. He has useful conversations with the maid, and a young lady at an inn. Wimsey strays into a bog, and Bunter saves his life. Bunter attends the trial of the Duke in Westminster Hall, and produces the ducal garb when the Duke is acquitted. c. 1923: The Abominable History of the Man with Copper Fingers (In Lord Peter Views the Body – short stories published 1928).Sayers, D.L.:\\"The Abominable History of the Man with Copper Fingers\\" in \\"Lord Peter Views the Body\\" Coronet, 1928. Set in America where Bunter works in the background, undertaking necessary support work. Sometime between 1923–1926 The Entertaining Episode of the Article in Question (In Lord Peter views the Body – short stories published 1928). Bunter takes photos of suspects in Paris using a small camera hidden in his breast pocket. On the boat back to England he develops the photos in the cabin. Wimsey begs to help and is given some crystals to dissolve in water – here follows an example of Bunter’s understated sarcasm: \\"I say, Bunter, it's no end of a bore to dissolve.\\" \\"Yes, my lord\\", returned Bunter sedately, \\"I have always found that part of the process exceptionally tedious, my lord.\\" Lord Peter jabbed viciously with the glass rod. \\"Just you wait\\", he said in a vindictive tone, \\"till we get to Waterloo\\". Bunter helps to hold and disarm a female impersonator. Sometime between 1923–1926: The Fascinating Problem of Uncle Meleager’s Will (In Lord Peter views the Body – short stories published 1928).Sayers, D.L.:\\"The Fascinating Problem of Uncle Meleager’s Will \\" in \\"Lord Peter Views the Body\\" Coronet, 1928.

Bunter's photographic skills provide a vital clue to a double identity. He instructs Wimsey on how to dress as a newly married man, but remains the servant. Wimsey is relieved to find Bunter is human when he is given the slip by a lady he is tailing. 1928 The Unpleasantness at the Bellona Club (Published 1928) Standard Bunter – the superb servant, advisor on Lord Peter's clothes, photographer at crime scenes. Curiously, Wimsey refers to Bunter simply as his NCO during the war, and says that he, Wimsey, looked up Bunter after the war. This was because Bunter's old master had been killed and his family broken up. 1929 The Adventurous Exploit of the Cave of Ali Baba (In Lord Peter views the Body – Short stories published 1928).Sayers, D.L.:\\"The Adventurous Exploit of the Cave of Ali Baba \\" in \\"Lord Peter Views the Body\\" Coronet, 1928.

Bunter, the capable manservant, is heard on the telephone, helping to show how an alibi was faked. 1930 Strong Poison (published 1930) Harriet Vane is introduced, and Bunter has his part as the perfect servant. Bunter quickly realises that Lord Peter has fallen in love. Wimsey reassures him that he wishes him to remain nevertheless. He is called upon to make the acquaintance of a cook and a parlour maid. Wimsey says, \\"You have a good, impressive upstanding figure…a bold and roving eye when off duty.\\" It is objected that Bunter looks like a deacon. \\"You've never seen Bunter off duty\\", replies Lord Peter somewhat mysteriously. Bunter's liaison with the domestic staff is a major help, and he is allowed to prove that the mysterious powder is arsenic. 1931 (early) The Five Red Herrings (published 1931)Sayers, D.L.:\\"The Five Red Herrings.\\" Coronet, 1931. Bunter is suffering in a primitive Kirkcudbrightshire cottage, trying to maintain West End manners. He also picks up local gossip, and takes a local maid to the cinema – getting her to speak very indiscreetly about her employer's secrets and probably getting her sacked (though this is not specifically stated). He receives little mention, however, and, strangely, is not included in the complicated reconstruction of the crime. It is also strange that although this novel falls between Strong Poison and Have His Carcase, which are the first and second Harriet Vane novels, Miss Vane is not mentioned at all. 1931 (Summer) Have His Carcase (published 1932)Sayers, D.L.:\\"Have His Carcase\\" New English Library, 1932. 18 June is noted as a Thursday, so this is 1931. Bunter appears very little and is largely eclipsed by Harriet. He continues, however to be the perfect servant: \\"I wish to appear in my famous impersonation of the perfect Lounge Lizard – imitation très difficile.\\" \\"Very good, my lord. I suggest the fawn-coloured suit we do not care for, with the autumn leaf socks and our outsize cigarette holder.\\" \\"As you will Bunter ... we must stoop to conquer.\\" He also allowed to carry out a very difficult piece of surveillance.

Wimsey travelling on train with \\"rigidly correct manservant\\", whom Lord Peter names when he asks Bunter to get the train staff to open up the \\"commissariat\\" and secure some food for Langley. Early 1932 The Queen's Square (in Hangman's Holiday, short stories published 1933).Sayers, D.L.:\\"The Queen’s Square\\" in \\"Hangman's Holiday\\" Coronet, 1933. At a country house Christmas party attended by Lord Peter, Bunter assists with the refreshments. However, after a murder, Bunter and Wimsey take a number of photographs which are developed in the cellar. It is Bunter's explanation of the effects of light at this point that enables Wimsey to solve the crime. 1932 Murder Must Advertise (published 1933). Wimsey is 42, hence it is 1932. There is only one obscure reference to Bunter, and none to Miss Vane directly, although at one point Wimsey has a date with the one \\"young woman who showed no signs of yielding to him, and what he did or said on that occasion is in no way related to this story\\". This ties in with references in Gaudy Night, when Wimsey is mentioned as undertaking an investigation in an advertisement agency while Harriet Vane goes about her normal life. 1933 The Nine Tailors (published 1934). Bunter plays a large part in the events. He acts as the perfect valet and assistant investigator. The servant Emily upsets Bunter by wiping fingerprints from a beer bottle. \\"You don’t look very merry, Bunter, but then you're one of those sphinx-like people. I've never seen you upset, except for that infernal beer-bottle.\\" \\"No, my lord. That hurt my pride very much.\\" When the village is flooded, Bunter acts as butler for the whole parish, and this includes his music-hall impressions. 1934–1935 Gaudy Night (published 1935).Sayers, D.L.:\\"GaudyNight\\" Hodder, 1935. Set in Oxford: Bunter plays a very minor part: two-thirds of the way through he is allowed to use his camera and find a hairpin. Miss Vane is once again the centre of attention. 1935 Busman's Honeymoon (the last novel entirely by Sayers: published 1937, action 1935). Bunter prepares Wimsey and his nephew for the wedding and all three look splendid. He also takes part in the subterfuge which whisks the couple away from the reporters afterwards. He deals with the strange circumstances surrounding their unheralded arrival at Talboys and efficiently sets up the cleaning lady, her son, the gardener and various tradesmen to form a support group over which he presides as de facto butler. He also hires a number of animals to scare off reporters. It is the housekeeper that provokes his one real outburst when she washes the bottles of Cockburn '96 port (17 /- a bottle). There is one moment when Lord Peter realises how the crime was done, and Bunter is almost overwhelmed because his master turns to him, not his new wife, for help with the next difficult steps. However, Bunter and Harriet together help Lord Peter through the difficult time at the execution of the murderer. October 1936 The Haunted Policeman (in Striding Folly, short stories published 1973).Sayers, D.L.:\\"The Haunted Policeman\\" in \\"Striding Folly\\" New English Library, 1973 Bunter does not appear in this story, which is very odd as it takes place at the moment when Lord Peter's first child is born in October 1936. 1936 Thrones, Dominations (Sayers notes expanded by Jill Paton Walsh, published 1998). After the honeymoon, Bunter is in service with Harriet and Peter in their London house with his brother Meredith as butler. Bunter is overjoyed to be called upon to assist in an investigation. He uses his camera at the scene of the crime and discovers the blocked sink; later he goes to France with Lord Peter on a diplomatic mission concerning the new king Edward VIII. Bunter marries professional photographer Hope Fanshaw. Bunter's mother attends, as does Lord Peter's Viennese opera singer. Bunter is revealed as very High Church. Mr and Mrs Bunter have a son, Peter Meredith, born December 1937. 1940 A Presumption of Death (Sayers with Jill Paton Walsh published 2002) Harriet moves with the children from London to Talboys at Paggleham, Hertfordshire. Bunter accompanies Lord Peter on secret missions into Europe for Military Intelligence while Wimsey's nephew Jerry is a fighter pilot. The Dowager Duchess says he cannot be in disguise as he has \\"English gentleman's personal gentleman\\" written all over him. He returns without Lord Peter and resumes service with Harriet. His wife, Hope, is working on aerial reconnaissance at Lopsley Manor; their son is with her parents in Evesham. Bunter attempts to rejoin the services, but is too old and instead takes a major part in organising the local Home Guard unit; he makes pellets for the shotguns which are all they have. Bunter makes himself quarters in the attic. After Lord Peter's return, he becomes involved in the death of a spy and, as ever, takes photographs, especially of fingerprints. He visits his son and in-laws in Evesham, and a friend in Gloucester. He deals in the country black market for the family. 1940/41 Mrs Bunter's studio is blitzed, so the Bunters rent a cottage in Paggleham near Talboys. Thrones, Dominations (Sayers notes expanded by Jill Paton Walsh published 1998). 1942 Talboys (in Striding Folly short stories published 1973 Action 1942)Sayers, D.L.:\\"Talboys\\" in \\"Striding Folly\\" New English Library, 1973 This story is oddly placed in the middle of the war, and Bunter is only mentioned as a servant: one who sleeps in the attic (see A Presumption of Death). As such, however, he is still \\"… your indispensable man …\\", and the last words of the story refer to \\"Bunter who knew everything without asking.\\" References Category:Characters in British novels of the 20th century Category:Dorothy L.

When dividing adjacent window units its primary purpose is a rigid support to the glazing of the window. Its secondary purpose is to provide structural support to an arch or lintel above the window opening. Horizontal elements separating the head of a door from a window above are both a head jamb and horizontal mullion and are called \\"transoms\\". History Stone mullions were used in Armenian, Saxon and Islamic architecture prior to the 10th century. They became a common and fashionable architectural feature across Europe in Romanesque architecture, with paired windows divided by a mullion, set beneath a single arch. The same structural form was used for open arcades as well as windows, and is found in galleries and cloisters. In Gothic architecture windows became larger and arrangements of multiple mullions and openings were used, both for structure and ornament. This is particularly the case in Gothic cathedrals and churches where stained glass was set in lead and ferramenta between the stone mullions. Mullioned windows of a simpler form continued to be used into the Renaissance and various Revival styles. Italian windows with a single mullion, dividing the window into two equal elements are said to be biforate, or to parallel the Italian bifore windows. Design Moorish mullioned window in the Alhambra of Granada Mullions may be made of any material, but wood and aluminium are most common, although glass is also used between windows. I. M. Pei used all-glass mullions in his design of JFK Airport's Terminal 6 (National Airlines Sundrome), unprecedented at the time. Mullions are vertical elements and are often confused with transoms, which lie horizontally. In US parlance, the word is also confused with the \\"muntin\\" (\\"glazing bar\\" in the UK) which is the precise word for the very small strips of wood or metal that divide a sash into smaller glass \\"panes\\" or \\"lights\\". A mullion acts as a structural member, in most applications the mullion transfers wind loads and weight of the glazing and upper levels into the structure below. In a curtain wall screen, however, the mullions only support the weight of the transoms, glass and any opening vents. Also in the case of a curtain wall screen the weight of glazing can be supported from above (providing the structure can take the required loads) this puts the mullions under tension rather than compression. When a very large glazed area was desired before the middle of the nineteenth century, such as in the large windows seen in Gothic churches or Elizabethan palaces, the openings necessarily required division into a framework of mullions and transoms, often of stone. It was further necessary for each glazed panel, sash or casement to be further subdivided by muntins or lead cames because large panes of glass were reserved primarily for use as mirrors, being far too costly to use for glazing windows or doors. In traditional designs today, mullions and transoms are normally used in combination with divided-light windows and doors when glazing porches or other large areas.

Demszky was the Mayor of Budapest from 1990 to 2010. He was a founding member of the Alliance of Free Democrats (SZDSZ) between 1988 and 2010.  Biography  As a teenager, Demszky joined an informal Maoist radical group, which criticized the socialist Kádár's government from an ultra-hardliner communist viewpoint. After two years, he lost faith in political left ideas and took interest in libertarian ideology. He earned a degree in sociology from Eötvös Loránd University. During the late period of communist regime, Demszky was a leading figure of the then illegal underground democratic opposition to the Kádár- system. His main anti-government activities included the organizing of printing and publishing of illegal books, periodicals, and newspapers collectively called 'samizdats'. During this time he was surveyed by the secret services, harassed by authorities and he clashed multiple times with the state police during demonstrations for free press and multi-party democracy. In the last years of the regime, he was a founding member of the SZDSZ party, which he led briefly during the late 1990s, before he resigned the post of party premier in protest over factionary in-fighting. He did not ask for his membership's renewal in 2010, therefore ceased to be a member. Since he left his office, he is in a set of former mayors who, despite being younger than the retirement age, are eligible for state-pensions, according to the law on local governments. He declared he doesn't plan full-time activity in the future.  Office  Demszky was first elected as Mayor of Budapest in 1990, and has won all the elections in which he run for that position since then (1994, 1998, 2002, 2006). He is with one of the longest serving time among politicians holding the same offices since the fall of communism. During his first term, the primary goal of his mayorship was working against the collapse of public services and order and working against increasing homelessness and unemployment, while dealing with the soviet-era legacy: the environmental damages and the ruined down working infrastructure that had been suffering from underinvestment and lacked satisfactory repairs for at least one decade. Cityscape quality was also ruined because of the pragmatic modernizations of a shortage-economy. In the first five years they managed to bring unemployment and homelessness down by inviting private investors and building relationships with employee-trainers, but the economy of the city mainly depended on government policy. During the first two terms reconstruction of the Millennium Underground to its Dualism-Era quality was done, as well as building the new Lágymányosi Bridge, and the Hungary Boulevard (the boulevard that is currently the furthest from the city center), while the national government built the southern sector of M0, albeit temporarily on a decreased capacity. János Kóka and Gábor Demszky at the presentation of the first Siemens Combino tram in 2006 A government denial of transferring of even compulsory funds to compulsory services of the city in the 1998–2002 term led to a stop in infrastructure investment and, in spite of the metropolitan government's own funds were diverted to repair-politics, statistical degradation of the pipe system and all materials (schools, buses, trams, heat plants) in metropolitan ownership took place for four years. Only the cultural life of the city was boosted from government funds constructing the House of Terror, the National Theatre, in Park Millenáris the House of Future and the Palace of Miracles, etc. After what all notable political analysts described as the government fell in trying to make Demszky fall (no Fidesz MEP-nominee could win in, e.g., any electorate district of all districts affected by cancellation of metro line 4, the number of people voting there impacted the rate-defined parliamentary seats dramatically), a faster development started with comprehensive repairs. From 2004, BKV started a modernization, by 2010 50% of the city's main roads were reconstructed, only the northwestern sector of M0 was missing, the tunnel of metro line 4 was started and metró line 2 was reconstructed, 1 more bridge (Megyeri Bridge) was built and 3 others were completely reconstructed and renovated (Liberty Bridge, Margaret Bridge and North Rail Bridge). Sewage treatment increased from 20% of generated sewage in 1990 to 98% in 2010,Demszky: Nem szabad mindent újrakezdeni Demszky: It is not advisable to start everything from scratch pipe-coverage also increased to near 100%. The lighting and traffic- light systems were reconstructed with energy-efficient and non-skypolluting lamps, and the central heating and electric power systems were also reconstructed. In the two last terms the problems to be worked against and finally decreased were rapid increase in modern cars and traffic, and intrusive effects of nightlife. The attention of the local government gradually turned to urban renewal as infrastructure-modernization programs finished and funds spent on them freed up.Demszky: Városfejlesztési Korszakhatáron vagyunk Demszky: We are approaching a next era in city development Criticism His party initiated the dissolution of the central local government to district governments which had significant powers like deciding the layouts of areas on the micro-level, or deciding on allowing demolition of large areas after selling them to private investors, which in return built and paved roads and built and replaced pipes in outer districts. He after getting elected as mayor worked for recentralising the city, but could never get the parliament modify the law created during the moment of the second world melting forever. He became a vocal critic of the districts because they achieved accelerated improvement at the cost of intrusion to the structure of the city, especially to its contiguous areas with potential in tourism or historical reconstruction, and he also became a vocal critic of the passages of the local government law applying to the capital. The districts in turn complained of negligence from the metropolitan government's part and of unfair dealings and distribution of funds and cooperation which outer districts and even professionals of the metropolitan government described as solving problems beginning from the center. His administration was also criticized for not stepping into direct oversight of the financial activities of its companies. This was achieved in cooperation with government agencies (National Bureau of Investigation, Police) during the last government's country-level program of transparency. Demonstration against Gábor Demszky during his speech (15 March 2007) In 2006, after the Ferenc Gyurcsány's audiotape-created political crisis broke out, Demszky's actions to seek ways to limit or otherwise restrict demonstrations critical of the government were criticised by his party's opposition and as well as by civil rights groups. He ordered the posting of 100–150 signs forbidding agricultural vehicles to use Budapest's main roads and enter the city center,MNO Magyar Nemzet Online to prevent an agricultural association staging a protest against the government and also he initiated a regulation, that mandates a permission to be obtained from the mayor's office to set up a stage for the purpose of a political event and also mandates a permission to be obtained for placing vehicles on public property for non-parking reasons. The regulation has been passed in the city council by the government majority, but it has been widely criticised for contradicting the constitution and the law which regulates public assembly (this is a so-called qualified majority law, i.e. in order to modify that law, a 2/3 majority has to be obtained in the national assembly).HírTV - Nyitólap :: Botrány: minden politikai rendezvény megakadályozható lesz? In an interview, Demszky stated that the reason for forbidding the tractors was that they would have eroded the freshly reconstructed roads (200 km roads were reconstructed in the year 2006 only) and would have completely disrupted the full traffic of Budapest and since that they would have expressed only a few hundred people's opinion, it was unacceptable. Nevertheless, he thought that the protest had no real basis, as all fund transfers were done that year, the tractors were funded by the government 40-45%, and the leaders of the agricultural association happening to organise were members of that Fidesz faction which agitated to radicals in front of parliament, and refused to be present in the assembly during the Prime Minister's speeches, the only difference was that these members have drawn into battle their supporters' tractors also.Index Demszky: A gazda traktor nélkül is gazda Index News Portal: Demszky: The farmers are still farmers without tractors However, he stated he never denied the right of protesting and only protected the reconstructed roads from vehicles not supposed to function there. He was criticized for the worn state of Metro Line 3, which his successor, István Tarlós inherited. During Tarlós' first term trains started burning or smoking multiple times, but this caused neither fatality nor serious injury. Tarlós reacted by scrapping all carriages older than 40 years and by starting the work leading to reconstruction of the line. Demszky had mobilized and tied down half of the budgets of his last term to investments in infrastructure (like building Metro Line 4 and the Central Wastewater Treatment Plant, which now treats 50% of the capital's sewage), for which he had also secured national and EU funds supplementing the invested amount of the capital multiple times. Thus he could not afford to reconstruct Metro Line 3, but financing the reconstruction's planning would have cost only a few hundred millions of Forints in the approximately 500-billion-Forint yearly budgets, and it would have allowed the reconstruction to start years earlier.

There are two kinds of came: the H-shaped sections that hold two pieces together and the U-shaped sections that are used for the borders. Cames are mostly made of lead, zinc, copper, brass or brass-capped lead.Art Glass Originals. (2004). Stained Glass for the first time. Sterling Publishing Company, Inc. p. 21. .Stevenson, Christine. (2004). Creative Stained Glass: Modern Designs & Simple Techniques. Lark Books. p. 12. . Of the metal strips, lead is softer and more flexible, making it easier to cut and bend. The harder metals are used to work with slightly curved lines and pieces that require greater structural support. They can also be used as border came, once again for stability and support.Shannon, George and Pat Torlen. (2002). The new stained glass: techniques, projects, patterns, designs. Sterling Publishing Company, Inc. p. 51. . Purpose Came serves three purposes:Berry, Leigh Ann. (2003). Basic Stained Glass Making: All the Skills and Tools You Need to Get Started. Stackpole Books. p. 10. . # it joins the pieces of glass (the H shaped channels are used to join two pieces of glass and the U-shaped are used for the border), # forms the lines within the glasswork and # provides the metal to be soldered, thus joining the pieces of came. Came face Came comes in varying face sizes and shapes. They can be round, flat or colonial shaped strips. They can also be narrow or have wide faces.Payne, Vicki. (2005). Traditional Leaded Glass Crafting: Projects & Techniques. Sterling Publishing Company, Inc. p. 22. . Came strips Came strips are 4 to 6 feet in length. The came strips can be a leaf, channel or heart came: > \\"The leaf is the surface on either side of the came that overlaps the edges > of the glass and is left exposed once the panel has been assembled. It has > either a flat or rounded profile and its width is the measurement given when > a came size is listed. > The channel runs the length of the came. H-shaped came has 2 back-to-back > channels that hold adjoining glass pieces in position on the interior of a > stained glass panel. It can also be used as a border came in certain > situations. U-shaped came has only one channel and is used as a border > around the perimeter of panels. > The heart is the part of the came that the glass pieces rest against inside > the channel. The width of lead came pattern lines is usually 1/16 inch and > allows for the thickness of the came's heart to fit between the adjoining > pieces of glass.\\" The width and depth of the came used to assemble the piece affect the pattern for cutting glass and for creating the finished piece.Shannon, George and Pat Torlen. (2002). The new stained glass: techniques, projects, patterns, designs. Sterling Publishing Company, Inc. p. 53. . Border cames Border cames are U-channel cames that are used on the outside edges of works. The selection of the metal of the came may vary depending upon the work. For instance, zinc may be a solid selection for free-hanging panels, because it is rigid, but lightweight. Architectural panels, on the other hand, are often enclosed in framing and therefore do not require a hard metal.Shannon, George and Pat Torlen. (2002). The new stained glass: techniques, projects, patterns, designs. Sterling Publishing Company, Inc. p. 55. . Bumpers or lead spacers Bumpers, or lead spacers, are pieces of cut came strips that are left over. They can be used temporarily in the glasswork process to hold together two pieces of glass to estimate the spacing of the finished project.Payne, Vicki. (2005).

Its approved indications are the treatment of acute pain, the symptomatic treatment of osteoarthritis, and primary dysmenorrhoea in adolescents and adults above 12 years old. Side effects may include liver problems. It has a multifactorial mode of action and is characterized by a fast onset of action. It works by blocking the production of prostaglandins (a chemical associated with pain), thereby relieving pain and inflammation. Medical uses Nimesulide is not available in the United States, however is used in other countries for acute pain. It may be used for pain, including period pains. Nimesulide is not recommended long-term, as for chronic conditions such as arthritis. This is due to its association with an increased risk of liver toxicity, including liver failure. Children Less than 10 days of nimesulide does not appear to increase the risk of hypothermia, gastrointestinal bleeding, epigastric pain, vomiting, diarrhea, or transient, asymptomatic elevation of liver enzymes compared to ketoprofen, paracetamol, mefenamic acid, aspirin, or ibuprofen in children. However, data does not speak to populations less than 6 months old. Pregnancy and lactation Women should use the drug with caution during lactation and nimesulide is contraindicated during pregnancy, and research suggest that it is also contraindicated in lactating women. Contraindications It should be avoided by children under 12 and people with liver problems or flu-like symptoms. Side effects Due to concerns about the risk of liver toxicity, nimesulide has been withdrawn from market in several countries (Spain, Finland, Belgium, Ireland, and United States). Liver problems have resulted in both deaths and the need for transplantation. This may occur in as little as three days after starting the medication. Continuous use of nimesulide (more than 15 days) may cause the following side effects: * Diarrhea * Vomiting * Skin rash * Itchiness * Dizziness * Bitterness in mouth Pharmacokinetics Nimesulide is absorbed rapidly following oral administration. Nimesulide undergoes extensive biotransformation, mainly to 4-hydroxynimesulide (which also appears to be biologically active). Food, gender, and advanced age have negligible effects on nimesulide pharmacokinetics. Moderate chronic kidney disease does not necessitate dosage adjustment, while in patients with severe chronic kidney disease or liver disease, Nimesulide is contraindicated.Microsoft Word - opnh.P.Nimesulide .EMEA-CPMP-3086-03-en-Final.doc Nimesulide has a relatively rapid onset of action, with meaningful reductions in pain and inflammation observed within 15 minutes from drug intake. The therapeutic effects of Nimesulide are the result of its complex mode of action, which targets a number of key mediators of the inflammatory process such as: COX-2 mediated prostaglandins, free radicals, proteolytic enzymes, and histamine. Clinical evidence is available to support a particularly good profile in terms of gastrointestinal tolerability. History It was launched in Italy for the first time as Aulin and Mesulid in 1985 and is available in more than 50 countries worldwide, including among others France, Portugal, Greece, Switzerland, Belgium, Russia, Thailand, and Brazil. Nimesulide has never been filed for Food and Drug Administration (FDA) evaluation in the United States, where it is not marketed. Availability 100mg Nimesulide pills It is available in a variety of forms: tablets, powder for dissolution in water, suppositories, mouth dissolving tablets, and topical gel. A recent evaluation from the European Medicines Agency (EMA) concluded that the overall benefit/risk profile of nimesulide is favourable and in line with that of the other NSAIDs such as diclofenac, ibuprofen, and naproxen.

CD ROM, Appropriate Use of Antipyretics / Analgesics in Children, Health Informatics, New Delhi, 2004. On February 12, 2011, Indian Express reported that the Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare finally had decided to suspend the pediatric use of the analgesic, Nimesulide suspension. From 10 March 2011 onward Nimesulide formulations are not indicated for human use in children below 12 years of age.CDSCO website-wide gazette notification GSR 82(E) dated 10.03.2011. On September 13, 2011 Madras High Court revoked a suspension on manufacture and sale of paediatric drugs nimesulide and phenylpropanolamine (PPA).  EMA confirms the positive benefit/risk ratio  On September 21, 2007 the EMA released a press release on their review on the liver-related safety of nimesulide. The EMA has concluded that the benefits of these medicines outweigh their risks, but that there is a need to limit the duration of use to ensure that the risk of patients developing liver problems is kept to a minimum. Therefore, the EMA has limited the use of systemic formulations (tablets, solutions, suppositories) of nimesulide to 15 days.EMA press release on nimesulide September 2007  Irish Medicines Board  The Irish Medicines Board has decided to suspend Nimesulide from the Irish market and refer it to the EU Committee for Human Medicinal Products (CHMP) for a review of its benefit/risk profile. The decision is due to the reporting of six cases of potentially-related liver failures to the IMB by the National Liver Transplant Unit, St. Vincent's University Hospital. These cases occurred in the period from 1999 to 2006.  Bribes  In May 2008, Italy's leading daily paper Corriere della Sera and other media outlets reported that a top- ranking official at Italy's medicines agency AIFA had been filmed by police while accepting bribes from employees of pharmaceutical companies.«Mazzette per evitare i controlli sull'Aulin». Mario Pappagallo, Corriere della Sera, 23 May 2008 The money allegedly was being paid to ensure that certain drugs would be spared scrutiny from the drugs watchdog. The investigation had started in 2005 following suspicions that some AIFA drug tests had been faked. Eight arrests were made. Nimesulide can be bought carrying a prescription from a physician that is kept as a receipt at the chemist shop, nominally allowing strong control over selling. The original manufacturer of Nimesulide is Helsinn Healthcare SA, Switzerland, which acquired the rights for the drug in 1976. After the patent protection terminated in 2015https://patents.google.com/patent/EP0782855B1/en, a number of other companies started production and marketing of Nimesulide.

From 1989 he was an Emeritus Fellow of Downing College, Cambridge. Life David Holbrook was born in Norwich in 1923. He was educated at City of Norwich School and won a scholarship to study English at Downing College, Cambridge for a year in 1941, where he was a pupil of F. R. Leavis. He is sometimes identified as a Leavis disciple, but their relationship was slighter than this might suggest (and also ended angrily, though this is a lesser indication). Holbrook was called up for military service with the British Army in 1942 and served until 1945 as an officer with the East Riding Yeomanry. His novel Flesh Wounds (1966) is a lightly fictionalised account of his D-Day campaign experiences with the East Riding Yeomanry. In 1945 he returned to Downing to complete his degree, which he did in 1947. In 1946 he made a bleak visit to George Orwell on Jura. The actual reason was to see his girlfriend Susan Watson, who was Orwell's housekeeper, but Orwell assumed it was connected with Holbrook's membership of the Communist Party of Great Britain, and gave him a frosty reception. After Cambridge, he became an editor with Edgell Rickword, of the communist cultural periodical Our Time. He then took up teaching positions, for the Workers' Educational Association and then at a secondary school in Bassingbourn, Cambridgeshire. He became a full-time writer in the early 1960s. He also renewed links with the University of Cambridge, becoming a Fellow of King's College, Cambridge in 1961, a Fellow of Downing College, Cambridge in 1981 and an Emeritus Fellow of Downing in 1988. The Associated University Presses marked his seventieth birthday by publishing a Festschrift entitled Powers of Being in October 1995. The book of essays is edited by Edwin Webb, Senior Lecturer in English at the University of Greenwich, and held contributions by sixteen academics and teachers from the United Kingdom, Canada, and the United States, including a portrait written by Boris Ford. In over thirty years his range of publications was prodigious: from \`English for Maturity' (1961), his first book on teaching English, to \`Creativity and Popular Culture' (1994), he wrote about literature, culture, and education, as well as producing his poetry and his novels. His distinguished literary achievements are suitably celebrated. He was a Fellow of the English Association. Works=Novels Holbrook wrote several novels based on his own life and his family history. These were not Romans à clef—most characters were identified by their real names—but they were closely based on real events without the constraints of veracity. The novels were not written in the internal chronological order. His first novel (Flesh Wounds (1966)) told the story of the escapades of Paul Grimmer (Holbrook's fictionalised persona) as a tank officer in the Normandy invasions. The events of Grimmer's adolescent life up to his enlistment were recounted in A Play of Passion (1978), which told of his involvement with the Maddermarket Theatre and its founder Nugent Monck. In Going Off The Rails (2003), Holbrook recreates the Edwardian lives of his paternal grandparents in rural Norfolk. His grandfather William built wagons in the Midland and Great Northern Railway workshops at Melton Constable. Holbrook's father worked as a railway booking clerk in North Walsham. He moved to Norwich when he was suspected of theft. His other novels are Nothing Larger Than Life (1987); Worlds Apart (1988); A Little Athens (1990); Jennifer (1992); The Gold in Father's Heart (1992); Even If They Fail (1994); and Getting It Wrong With Uncle Tom (1998).

He was sent to China in 1920 as a Senior advisor to contact the top prominent Chinese Communists such as Chen Duxiu, just before the formation of the Communist Party of China. The process of forming the Communist Party can be mostly attributed to his influence, although his successor advisors had more influence about the official party line itself, such as allying with the Kuomintang. He was born on 17 April 1893 in Nevel to a Russian Jewish family. In 1918, he joined the Bolshevik Party. He took an active part in the Far Eastern Front in the Russian Civil War.Yoshihiro Ishikawa, The Formation of the Chinese Communist Party. Columbia University Press, 2013  Work in China  In 1920, the Soviet Union established the Far Eastern Bureau in Siberia, a branch of the Third Communist International, or the Comintern. He was directly responsible for managing the establishment of a Communist party in China and other far east countries. Soon after its establishment, the bureau's deputy manager Voitinsky arrived in Beijing and contacted the Communist vanguard Li Dazhao. Li arranged for Voitinsky to meet with another Communist leader, Chen Duxiu, in Shanghai. In August 1920, Voitinsky, Chen Duxiu, Li Hanjun, Shen Xuanlu, Yu Xiusong, Shi Cuntong, and others began to establish the Comintern China Branch. The Shanghai Chronicle (not to be confused with the Shanghai Jewish Chronicle) was set up in 1919 in Shanghai by Shemeshko and other Russians with socialist leanings, and received financial aid from the Soviet Russian government in early 1920. In the spring of 1920, Voitinsky and his colleagues came to China on a mission to establish the Communist Party in China. They not only came to China in the guise of editors and reporters for the newspaper, but also set up the Comintern's East Asia Secretariat in the newspaper office. From then on, the Shanghai Chronicle became both a propaganda vehicle for the East Asia Secretariat and a cover for Bolshevik activity in China. Because the newspaper staff assisted Soviet Russian and Comintern personnel stationed under cover at the newspaper in activities to establish a communist organization in China, the newspaper as a whole played a special role in the early communist movement in China. Although the Shanghai Chronicle stopped publication at the end of 1922 because Russian aid came to an end, many staff members continued to work for Bolshevism.Frank L. Britton Behind Communism. University of Michigan, 1952  Later career  He worked as Comintern representative until 1926. Then worked in the Siberian government in Irkutsk until 1929, when he moved to Moscow, where he worked in various Orientalist institutions. In 1934 he became a professor in Moscow State University. Biography (in Russian) He is considered one of the founders of Soviet Sinology. He wrote several books about contemporary China politics. He died in 1953 during an unsuccessful surgical operation.

Administrative regulations for driver licensing, vehicle ownership and registration, insurance, vehicle safety inspections and parking violations may also be included, though not always directly related to driving safety. Violations of traffic code (i.e., a \\"moving violation\\") are often dealt with by forfeiting a fine in response to receiving a valid citation (\\"getting a ticket\\"). Other violations, such as drunk driving or vehicular homicide are handled through the criminal courts, although there may also be civil and administrative cases that arise from the same violation (including payment of damages and loss of driving privileges). In some jurisdictions, there is a separate code-enforcement branch of government that handles illegal parking and other non-moving violations (e.g., noise and other emissions, illegal equipment). Elsewhere, there may be multiple overlapping police agencies patrolling for violations of state or federal driving regulations. United States For the traffic code in the United States, each state has its own traffic code, although most of the rules of the road are similar for the purpose of uniformity, given that all states grant reciprocal driving privileges (and penalties) to each other's licensed drivers. There is also a \\"Uniform Vehicle Code\\" which has been proposed by a private, non-profit group, based upon input by its members. As with many such offerings, some states adopt selected portions as written, or else with modifications, and others create their own versions. Similarly, most states have adopted relevant standards for signs and signals, based upon the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices from the U.S. Department of Transportation. Many of the standard rules of the road involve consistent interpretation of the standard signs and signals, such as what to do when approaching a stop sign, or the driving requirements imposed by a double yellow line on the street or highway. Many federal departments have also adopted their own traffic code for enforcement on their respective reservations (e.g., national parks, military bases).  Outside US  Most countries define national legislation relative to car driving and penalties. Most of those regulations have some common basis to help people driving from one country to one other: Vienna Convention on Road Traffic and Vienna Convention on Road Signs and Signals have helped this harmonization effort. Road, driving and traffic regulations are the subject to specific codification of the law in countries such as: * Austria: '''' * Brasil: ', basis is Vienna convention * Canada and Québec: L.R.Q., chapitre C-24.2 * Canada and Manitoba: The ' contains legislation called \\"Highway Traffic Act\\", translated as ' in French (chaptre H 060). * United States of America: Traffic code (each local to a state from United states of America) * France: '''' * Germany: '''' * Italy: '''' * Lithuania: ' * Luxembourg: In Luxembourg, the equivalent legislation is called Code de la route and is considered codes-loi (\\"law-code\\") or recueil de Législation Routière. * Poland: '''' * Portugal: '''' * Russia: '''' * Swiss: '''' * Ukraine: '''' In Morocco, the law loi n°52-05 portant code de la route deals with a new traffic code, approved on 14 January 2009 and adopted on 11 February 2010 (26 safar 1431). In Belgium this regulation is not a code although it is road traffic specific. It is defined by Koninklijk besluit houdende algemeen reglement op de politie van het wegverkeer en van het gebruik van de openbare weg. [KB. 09.12.1975]. In Switzerland, this legislation is not considered as code it is legislation number 741.01. In United Kingdom there is no codification. Some laws, such as a Road Traffic Act and a Traffic Signs Regulations and General Directions, do exist; a manual titled Highway Code is edited by a public entity with guidelines based on and/or compatible with local law. In European Union federal level, legislation is more oriented on transport competition and not on sharing the road. There is some effort oriented to issues such as driving license and car control.

It was established in 1977 by the Queen Elizabeth the Second National Trust Act 1977 \\"to encourage and promote, for the benefit of New Zealand, the provision, protection, preservation and enhancement of open space.\\" QEII enables landowners to protect special features on their land through its open space covenants. QEII does this by partnering with private landowners to protect natural and cultural heritage sites on their land with covenants. The landowner continues to own and manage the protected land, and the covenant and protection stays on the land, even when the property is sold to a new owner. Open space is defined in the QEII National Trust Act as any area of land or body of water that serves to preserve or to facilitate the preservation of any landscape of aesthetic, cultural, recreational, scenic, scientific, or social interest or value. QEII covenants consist of a network of over 4,400 protected areas throughout New Zealand, ranging from small backyard patches to huge swathes of high country. These covenants protect more than 180,000 ha of private land, and play a hugely critical role as a refuge for some of New Zealand’s rarest and most endangered biodiversity and ecosystems. QEII also delivered New Zealand’s contribution to the Queen’s Commonwealth Canopy Initiative (QCC). This is a worldwide initiative set up to mark Queen Elizabeth II’s reign and leadership of the Commonwealth. It aims to create a network of native forest throughout the Commonwealth, and QEII is the link to the QCC in New Zealand. The National Trust puts a high priority on securing covenants that support the objectives of the New Zealand Biodiversity Strategy.  History  QEII National Trust was set up in 1977, with the intention that it was set up by farmers for farmers and other landowners at a time when the New Zealand Government offered subsidies to encourage bush and wetland clearance on farms. There was a desire in the community among farmers and other landowners to protect areas on private land that were home to native species. Their vision was for protection to be both voluntary and everlasting, legally protecting the land forever. QEII was founded by Gordon Stephenson who was also the first covenantor. Founder Gordon Stephenson died in December 2015.  Governance  QEII is an independent charitable trust, rather than a Government institution. Our Board is responsible for executive control and management of the QEII National Trust. QEII is governed by a board of directors. The board is made up of six directors. The Minister of Conservation appoints four directors who have the right mix of environmental and conservation values, and who can reflect the interests of rural landowners, and the interests of the Maori community. QEII National Trust members elect the remaining two directors.

France In France, a number of court cases have involved Jehovah Witnesses and their organizations, especially on the question of their refusing blood transfusions to minor patients. These questions had far- reaching legal implications regarding the tax status of their organizations. = Association Les Témoins de Jéhovah = Association Les Témoins de Jéhovah v. Direction des Services Fiscaux challenged the denial of tax-exempt status for Association Les Témoins de Jéhovah, the not-for-profit corporation used by Jehovah's Witnesses in France. Religious associations (“”, the legal status defined by the 1905 law on the Separation of the Churches and the State) in France can request exemption from certain taxes, including taxes on donations, if their purpose is solely to organize religious worship and they do not infringe on public order. According to the French tax administration, tax-exempt status was denied because: On October 5, 2004, the Court of Cassation--the highest court in France for cases outside of administrative law --rejected the Witnesses' recourse against taxation at 60% of the value of some of their contributions, which the fiscal services assimilated to a legal category of donations close to that of inheritance and subject to the same taxes between non-parents.Court of Cassation, October 5, 2004, 03-15.709 (French). The court ruled that the tax administration could legally tax the corporation used by Jehovah's Witnesses if they received donations in the form of dons gratuits and they were not recognized as associations cultuelles. According to the Watch Tower Society, the taxed contributions include donations for the support of humanitarian relief efforts in Rwanda in 1994. French law makes a distinction between normal non-profit associations (whose donations for humanitarian aid are not tax-exempt), non-profit associations of public usefulness (whose donations for humanitarian aid are tax exempt), and associations supporting religious activities (whose donations are tax exempt). Humanitarian aid is not considered to support religious activities and thus, accordingly, is not considered to be tax-exempt under the rules governing associations supporting religious activities. Typically, religious organizations in France providing humanitarian aid found a separate association devoted to that purpose; it may then be declared of public usefulness. In the case of two local associations of Jehovah's Witnesses, the Council of State, the supreme court for administrative matters, ruled that denying the legal status of on grounds of accusations of infringement of public order was illegal unless substantiated by actual proofs of that infringement.Council of State, June 23, 2000 (French).

For example, in a 2001 case, doctors at a French public hospital who gave blood products to a patient with an acute kidney injury were found not to have committed a mistake of a nature to involve the responsibility of the State.Council of State, Press release, October 26, 2001. The Council stated that \\"there does not exist, for the doctor, an abstract and unalterable hierarchy between the obligation to treat the patient, and that to respect the will of the patient,\\" concluding that faced with a decision to treat patients against their will, doctors do not have a legally predefined obligation to treat the patient, nor do they have a legally predefined obligation to abide by their wishes. One year later, after the adoption of the Kouchner Law on patients' rights and quality of the health system,Loi no 2002-303 du 4 mars 2002 relative aux droits des malades et à la qualité du système de santé. the Council of State recalled that not respecting the patient's wishes violates his individual freedom, but the doctor did not commit a fault if under extreme conditions he performs an intervention “necessary and proportionate to its state” in order to try to save the patient's life. In a child custody case following a divorce, a woman was denied custody of her children outside of holidays for various reasons, including her membership of Jehovah's Witnesses; the court of appeals of Nîmes considered that the educational rules applied by the Witnesses to their children were essentially inappropriate because of their hardness, their intolerance, and the obligation for children to practice proselytism. The case went before the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR), which ruled that the court should have based its decision on the mother's actual handling of her children and not on abstract, general notions pertaining to the mother's religious affiliation.European Court of Human Rights, 16 December 2003, application no. 64927/01. Some Witnesses requested that the National Union of the Associations for the Defense of Families and Individuals not be officially recognized as useful to the public because of its opposition to sectarian excesses which, the plaintiffs alleged, persecuted Jehovah's Witnesses. Both the Conseil d'État and the ECHR rejected their claim. Following a lengthy administrative procedure initiated by Jehovah's Witnesses, on October 16, 2013, the Council of State condemned the refusals of the French administration to accept their religious ministers as prison chaplains, explaining that the detainees “may exercise the religion of their choice, in accordance with the suitable conditions for organising the premises, within solely the limits imposed by security and good order in the institution”.Jehovah's Witnesses chaplains must be approved for prisons, EUREL.

Modern settlement Greek Orthodox Basilica of Saint George, Madaba The resettlement of the city ruins by 90 Arab Christian-convert families from Al Karak, in the south, led by two Italian priests from the Latin Patriarchate of Jerusalem in 1880.PEF Survey of Palestine, Survey of Eastern Palestine (1889), page 291: \\"In the midst of these tribes a colony of native Christians is established at Madeba. They were converted at Kerak in 1880 by Jesuit missionaries from Jerusalem, and established themselves early in 1881 at the ruined town of Madeba.\\" This period saw the start of archaeological research. This in turn substantially supplemented the scant documentation available. The Catholic Church's list of titular sees uses the spelling \\"Medaba\\", traditional in reference to the ancient bishopric centred on this city, while at the same time referring to the modern city as 'Madaba\\".Annuario Pontificio 2013 (Libreria Editrice Vaticana, 2013, ), p. 926 In his memoirs, the German Count von Rantzau reports about his friend Sultan Gin-Achmed, Royal Prince of Madaba both studying at Helmstedt University, Germany in 1729 and meeting again in Paris ten years later. Climate Madaba has a hot-summer Mediterranean climate (Köppen climate classification Csa). Most rain falls in the winter. The average annual temperature in Madaba is . About of precipitation falls annually. Archaeology of Khirbat Ataruz  Ataruz (Ataroth) is mentioned prominently in the Mesha stele. The city was conquered by Israelite King Omri, as discussed in the Mesha stele, Book of Numbers 32, and 2nd Books of Kings 3:4-27. The oldest inscription in the Moabite language script, dated to the late 9th or early 8th century BCE, was found at Khirbat Ataruz.  Archaeological finds in Madaba city  Hippolytus Hall in the Archaeological Park of Madaba The first mosaics were discovered during the building of new houses using bricks from older buildings. The new inhabitants of Madaba, made conscious of the importance of the mosaics by their priests, made sure that they took care of and preserved all the mosaics that came to light. The northern part of the city turned out to be the area containing the greatest concentration of mosaics. During the Byzantine-Umayyad period, this northern area, crossed by a colonnaded Roman road, saw the building of the Church of the Map, the Hippolytus Mansion, the Church of the Virgin Mary, the Church of Prophet Elijah with its crypt, the Church of the Holy Martyrs (Al-Khadir), the Burnt Palace, the Church of the Sunna' family, and the church of the salaita family. A 6th-century mosaic map of Jerusalem in the Madaba Map The Map of Madaba mosaic was discovered in 1896 and the findings were published a year later. This discovery drew the attention of scholars worldwide. It also positively influenced the inhabitants, who shared the contagious passion of F. Giuseppe Manfredi, to whom the rediscovery of most of the city's mosaics are owed. Madaba became known as the \\"City of Mosaics\\" in Jordan. The Madaba Mosaic Map is a map of the region dating from the 6th century and preserved in the floor of the Greek Orthodox Basilica of Saint George, sometimes called the \\"Church of the Map\\". With two million pieces of colored stone, the map depicts hills and valleys, villages and towns in Palestine and the Nile Delta. The mosaic contains the earliest extant representation of Byzantine Jerusalem, labeled the \\"Holy City.\\" The map provides important details about its 6th-century landmarks, with the cardo, or central colonnaded street, and the church of the Holy Sepulchre clearly visible. This map is one key in developing scholarly knowledge about the physical layout of Jerusalem after its destruction and rebuilding in 70 AD. Other mosaic masterpieces found in the Church of the Virgin and the Apostles and the Archaeological Museum, depict a profusion of flowers and plants, birds and fish, animals and exotic beasts, as well as scenes from mythology and everyday pursuits of hunting, fishing and farming. Hundreds of other mosaics from the 5th through the 7th centuries are scattered throughout Madaba. The University of Toronto has been excavating in Madaba from 1996 until the present. Their efforts have focused primarily on the west acropolis where an open field has allowed access to uncover the entire sequence of occupation at Madaba from the modern period down to the Early Bronze Age levels. The most visible feature of this area is a fortification wall built sometime in the 9th century BC, with subsequent rebuilds throughout its history. There is also the remains of a well-preserved Byzantine-era house at the base of the fortification wall. In 2010, a 3,000-year-old Iron Age temple containing several figurines of ancient deities and circular clay vessels used in Moabite religious rituals was discovered at Khirbat 'Ataroz near Mabada. Mosaic school The Institute of Mosaic Art and Restoration was founded in 1992 as the Madaba Mosaic School, and funded by the Italian Government. It was a high school which offered the Tawjihi, the Jordanian equivalent of a high school diploma. In 2007, the Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities, under the Department of Antiquities partnered with USAID's Siyaha tourism development project, and a rejuvenated Italian commitment to launch the institute as a 2-year, post-Tawjihi program. The aim of the institute is to be a center of excellence in the region, and to train locals on a scientific level to conserve and restore the many ancient mosaics found in Jordan. Students are also taught traditional and modern methods of mosaic production, Computer Aided Design (CAD), Arabic, English, geology, and chemistry. Soon, students will also be able to transfer their credits to Yarmouk University to complete a BA in Archaeology with a further two years of study. The institute is located between the Madaba Visitors Center and the Madaba Archaeological Park.  Hammamat Ma'in  Southwest of Madaba is Hammamat Ma'in or Zarqa Ma'in, the thermal mineral springs that for centuries have attracted people to come and immerse themselves in the sites' warm therapeutic waters.  Bani Hamida  Bani Hamida Weavings A weaving project was started by twelve women of the tribe in 1985 and since then Bani Hamida has become famed for producing woven items in traditionally bright colors. Traditional ground looms, assembled using stones and sticks, are used for the weaving, and the products can be found at numerous outlets in Jordan and abroad. Visitors can stop by the weaving rooms, located in the village of Mukawir, to see how rugs are made. The women also make decorative candles.  New developments  Madaba has been chosen to house new universities (American University of Madaba) and a new settlement operation not far from the historic city will house over 600 villas. Kuwaiti corporations are now funding the construction of new office buildings to be built in Madaba. Tourist attractions The Madaba visitors center Madaba's main attraction is its Byzantine mosaics, drawing many visitors, especially since the creation of an archaeological park. They cover the floors of houses and churches dating from the site's earliest period of habitation. The nearby site of Umm ar-Rasas, south-east of Madaba on the edge of the semi-arid steppe, started as a Roman military camp and grew to become a town from the 5th century. It also has very large and well-preserved mosaics. At the southern entrance to Madaba, near the King's Highway, is the Church of the Apostles. The ruins of this Byzantine church date to 578 CE, and are currently being restored. It includes a mosaic known as the \\"Personification of the Sea\\", depicting a woman emerging from the sea, surrounded by mythical aquatic creatures and a hodgepodge of rams, bulls, parrots and exotic vegetation. The mosaic was signed by a mosaicist named Salamanios.

Types Bay window is a generic term for all protruding window constructions, regardless of whether they run over one or multiple storeys. In plan, the most frequently used shapes are isosceles trapezoid (which may be referred to as a canted bay windowGlossary of Architectural Terms s.v. Bay Window.) and rectangle. But other polygonal shapes with more than two corners are also common as are curved shapes. If a bay window is curved it may alternatively be called bow window.John Fleming, Hugh Honour, Nikolaus Pevsner, The Penguin Dictionary of Architecture, Fourth edition, Harmondsworth 1991, p. 36. Bay windows in a triangular shape with just one corner exist but are relatively rare. A bay window supported by a corbel, bracket or similar is called an oriel window. Uses Most medieval bay windows and up to the Baroque era are oriel windows. They frequently appear as a highly ornamented addition to the building rather than an organic part of it. Particularly during the Gothic period they often serve as small house chapels, with the oriel window containing an altar and resembling an apse of a church. Especially in Nuremberg these are even called (), with the most famous example being the one from the parsonage of St. Sebaldus Church. In Islamic architecture, oriel windows such as the Arabic mashrabiya are frequently made of wood and allow viewing out while restricting visibility from the outside. Especially in warmer climates, a bay window may be identical to a balcony, with a privacy shield or screen. Bay windows can make a room appear larger, and provide views of the outside which would be unavailable with an ordinary flat window. They are found in terraced houses, semis and detached houses as well as in blocks of flats. Based on British models, their use spread to other English-speaking countries like Ireland, the US, Canada and Australia. Following the pioneering model of pre-modern commercial architecture at the Oriel Chambers in Liverpool, they feature on early Chicago School skyscrapers, where they often run the whole height of the building's upper storeys. Bay windows were identified as a defining characteristic of San Francisco architecture in a 2012 study that had a machine learning algorithm examine a random sample of 25,000 photos of cities from Google Street View.

However, the official form as used in the statuto comunale is not hyphenated. () is a comune in the Metropolitan City of Messina on the island of Sicily in southern Italy. It is situated on the coast of the Ionian Sea on a bay which lies between Cape Taormina and Cape Schisò. Since the 1970s it has become a seaside-resort.  History  A view of San Giovanni, one of Giardini Naxos' beaches. Founded by Thucles the Chalcidian in 734 BC, Naxos was never a powerful city, but its temple of Apollo Archegetes, protecting deity of all the Greek colonies, gave it prominence in religious affairs. Leontini and Catania were both colonized from here. Hippocrates, tyrant of Gela, captured it in 494 BC. Its opposition to Syracuse ultimately led to its capture and destruction in 403 BC at the hands of Dionysius the tyrant, after it had supported Athens during that city's disastrous Sicilian Expedition. Though the site continued to be inhabited, most activity shifted to neighbouring Tauromenium. In 1544, following the raids by corsair, Kheir-ed-Din, several military buildings were constructed to protect Cape Schisò from the Barbary pirates who continued to attack and plunder the coastal villages. These were Schisò Castle, which was rebuilt from an earlier 13th-century castle, Schisò fort, and Vignazza Tower. The latter is a quadrangular watchtower which served to patrol the coast south of Port Schisò; if any pirate boats were sighted, the observers inside the tower could alert the villagers and neighbouring watchtowers by sending out smoke signals. Vignazza Tower is located in the Recanati area of Giardini Naxos.  Economy  Prior to the early 1970s, Giardini Naxos was a quiet fishing village. Now it is a tourist destination, its attractions including beaches, the panoramic view of the bay and surrounding hills, and its small fishing port. It attracts foreign visitors and Italians alike, many of whom own summer residences in the comune. The seafront is lined with hotels, smaller pensions, pubs, restaurants and pizzerias. A Giardini Naxos beach at dusk. The town of Taormina is situated in the hills above Giardini Naxos and can be easily accessed by car and bus.

Subsequently, after the Norman conquest, it was an office held by a man of lower rank, appointed as manager of a manor and overseer of the peasants. In this later role, historian H. R. Loyn observes, \\"he is the earliest English specialist in estate management.\\"Loyn, Anglo-Saxon England and the Norman Conquest, 2nd ed. 1991:356. Anglo-Saxon England Before the Conquest, a reeve (Old English ġerēfa; similar to the titles greve/gräfe in the Low Saxon languages of Northern Germany) was an administrative officer who generally ranked lower than the ealdorman or earl. The Old English word ġerēfa was originally a general term, but soon acquired a more technical meaning. Land was divided into a large number of hides—an area containing enough farmable land to support one household. Ten hides constituted a tithings, and the families living upon it (in theory, 10 families) were obliged to undertake an early form of neighbourhood watch, by a collective responsibility system called frankpledge. Tithings were organised into groups of 10, called hundreds due to containing 100 hides; in modern times, these ancient hundreds still mostly retain their historic boundaries, despite each generally now containing vastly more than a mere 100 families. Each hundred was supervised by a constable, and groups of hundreds were combined to form shires, with each shire being under the control of an earl. Each unit had a court, and an officer to implement decisions of that court: the reeve. Thus different types of reeves were attested, including high-reeve, town-reeve, port-reeve, shire- reeve (predecessor to the sheriffOnline Etymology Dictionary:sheriff), reeve of the hundred, and the reeve of a manor. The word is often rendered in Latin as prefectus (Modern English prefect), by the historian Bede, and some early Anglo-Saxon charters. West-Saxon charters prefer to reserve the term prefectus for the ealdormen (earls) themselves. After the Conquest After the Norman conquest, feudalism was introduced, forming a parallel administrative system to the local courts. The feudal system organised land on a manorial basis, with stewards acting as managers for the landlords. The Norman term describing the court functionary—bailiff—came to be used for reeves associated with lower level courts, and with the equivalent role in the feudal courts of landlords. Courts fulfilled administrative, as well as judicial, functions, and on the manorial level its decisions could concern mundane field management, not just legal disputes. The manorial bailiff thus could be set tasks such as ensuring certain crops were gathered, as well as those like enforcing debt repayment. Sometimes, bailiffs would have assistants to carry out these tasks, and the term reeve now came to be used for this position—someone essentially assisting the steward, and sometimes a bailiff, by effectively performing day-to-day supervision of the work done on the land within a particular manor. This reeve has been described as \\"the pivot man of the manorial system\\". He had to oversee the work which the peasants were bound to perform, as an obligation attached to their holding of land in the Manor, for the lord of the manor on the demesne land; such reeves acted generally as the overseer of the serfs and peasants on the estate. He was also responsible for many aspects of the finances of the manor such as the sale of produce, collection of monies and payment of accounts. He was usually himself a peasant, and was chosen once a year, generally at Michaelmas. In some manors the reeve was appointed by the lord of the manor, but in others he was elected by the peasants, subject or not to a right of veto by the lord. It depended on the custom of the manor, but there was an increasing tendency for election to be favoured. No doubt an elected reeve was more willingly obeyed, and sometimes the peasants generally would be made financially liable if an elected reeve defaulted.see H. S. Bennett: Life on the English Manor (Cambridge 1937) pp. 166ff Although this reeve was subject to the steward, the steward might not always be resident within the manor, and may manage many, and would not usually concern himself with day-to-day working. A good reeve who carried out his duties efficiently, and was trusted by the lord and the peasants alike, was likely to stay in office more or less permanently. By the 14th century the reeve was often a permanent officer of the manor. With the subsequent decline of the feudal system, and the subversion of its courts by the introduction of Justices of the Peace (magistrates), this use of reeve fell out of practice. Depiction by Chaucer There is an exceptional literary portrait of a reeve in the second half of the 14th century. The reeve is one of the pilgrims who are making their way to Canterbury in Chaucer's Canterbury Tales and the Prologue paints a vivid picture of this man, who had originally been a carpenter but had served as reeve of a manor for many years and had grown old in service. Chaucer describes a highly efficient servant, impossible for any man to deceive or outwit, never in debt and knowing exactly how much the manor should produce. It is an early picture of a completely reliable accountant, rather a cold individual but indispensable.Canterbury Tales. Prologue lines 590 ff. When he comes to tell his tale, the Reeve's Tale is appropriately about a miller who stole corn from two students who then get their revenge in bed with his wife and daughter.

Ann Cooper was born in Woodbury, New Jersey on April 23, 1716. She married James Whitall in 1739 at age 23.Burstyn, Joan N. (1990). Past and Promise: Lives of New Jersey Women. The Scarecrow Press, Inc. . Whitall kept a diary starting in about 1760 that contains important historical insight into the lives of people in the Red Bank area and Quaker family life in colonial times. As a devout Quaker and pacifist, Whitall stayed in her house on October 22, 1777, even though British warships were firing cannon in that direction during the Battle of Red Bank.Burstyn, Joan N. (1990). Past and Promise: Lives of New Jersey Women. The Scarecrow Press, Inc. . A cannonball did crash into the very room where Whitall sat working at a spinning wheel. She moved the spinning wheel down to the basement and kept working. The battle was a victory for the colonists, and afterwards Whitall opened her house to wounded Hessian soldiers, even though they were the enemy. She gave them herbal medicines and bandaged their wounds. She is called the Heroine of Red Bank for her actions at that time. The Battle of Red Bank took place on the Delaware River in west New Jersey, below Trenton, in the county of Gloucester, in what is now the town of National Park. Southern New Jersey folk hero Jonas Cattell ran the entire distance from Haddonfield to Woodbury to warn Colonel Christopher Greene, who commanded the small colonial contingent at nearby Red Bank, that the Hessians, commanded by Count von Donop, were marching towards Red Bank. Ann and James Whitall had nine children together, six sons and three daughters. Ann Whitall died in 1797 at age 82 during a yellow fever epidemic. Her remains are interred along with her husband's at the Friends Burial Ground in Woodbury, New Jersey. The James and Ann Whitall House stands today, preserved, as part of the Red Bank Battlefield county park. Tours are available seasonally. Ann Cooper Whitall's brother, John Cooper served in the Continental Congress in 1776. Her grandson, John Mickle Whitall, was a prominent sea captain and Quaker businessman who manufactured glass bottles in Millville, NJ.

Jogiches was a founder of the political party known as The Social Democracy of the Kingdom of Poland (main forerunner of the Communist Party of Poland) in 1893 and a key figure in the underground Spartacus League in Germany (main forerunner of the Communist Party of Germany) during the years of World War I. For many years the personal companion and a close political ally of internationally famous revolutionary Rosa Luxemburg, Jogiches was assassinated in Berlin by right-wing paramilitary forces in March 1919 while investigating Luxemburg's murder some weeks before. Early life Leon Jogiches was born to a wealthy ethnic Polish-Jewish family in Vilnius, now Lithuania, then part of the Russian Empire, on 17 July 1867.J.P. Nettl, Rosa Luxemburg. In Two Volumes. London: Oxford University Press, 1966; vol. 1, pg. 66.Biographische Datenbanken – Jogiches, Leo. Bundesstiftung Aufarbeitung. Retrieved 1 December 2018. Little is known of his childhood years, although it is perhaps instructive that Jogiches spoke no Hebrew and had no more than a rudimentary grasp of Yiddish, indicating a closer familiarity with other regional languages and cultures than those of his Jewish heritage. The family mostly spoke Polish at home and Russian elsewhere. As a young man of 18, Jogiches founded one of the earliest underground socialist study circles in Vilnius, its 1885 origin predating the foundation of the first mass international socialist organization in the Russian Empire by a dozen years. Using the first of many pseudonyms, Liofka (little Leo), Jogiches attained an almost legendary local status for his tenacious dedication to the anti-Tsarist cause.Nettl, Rosa Luxemburg, vol. 1, pg. 67. This commitment led to two arrests and short terms in jail, in both 1888 and 1889.Aleksandr Mikhailovich Prokhorov, \\"Leo Jogiches,\\" Great Soviet Encyclopedia. English edition. New York: Macmillan Educational Company, 1982. Zurich emigration The arrogant and domineering \\"father of Russian Marxism\\" Georgy Plekhanov quickly became a lasting enemy of the young Jogiches With the threat of conscription into the Tsar's army looming — possibly a penal battalion — Jogiches escaped to Zurich, Switzerland. He brought with him during his furtive departure a considerable sum of money, including both personal and donated funds earmarked for the publication and distribution of socialist literature. A few months after his arrival in Zurich, the 23-year old Jogiches met a fellow 20-year old ethnic Jewish political émigré from Tsarist autocracy, Rosa Luxemburg.Elzbieta Ettinger, \\"Comrade and Lover: Rosa Luxemberg's Letters to Leo Jogiches,\\" New German Critique, whole no. 17, (Spring 1979), pg. 132. The pair fell in love and became both close political allies and personal companions. Shortly after his arrival in Switzerland, Jogiches made contact with pioneer Russian Marxist Georgy Plekhanov and proposed a business partnership for the publication of radical literature, in which Jogiches' money and publishing expertise would be complemented by Plekhanov's prestige and copyright control of Russian editions of works by Karl Marx and Frederick Engels. A financial split of 50-50 was proposed by Jogiches, which was abruptly rejected by Plekhanov and an ongoing personal frostiness between the pair ensued. Not to be deterred by the clash of egos and the dispute over money, Jogiches would nevertheless proceed to establish his publishing house, The Social-Democratic Library (Sotsialdemokraticheskaya Biblioteka) in 1892, issuing pirated editions of works by Marx, Karl Kautsky, and others — further poisoning relations with Plekhanov. The bitter battle with Plekhanov over publishing had the effect of isolating Jogiches (and his companion Luxemburg) from the bulk of the exile Russian colony in Switzerland.Nettl, Rosa Luxemburg, vol. 1, pg. 68. Jogiches turned his primary attention to Polish affairs for the next several years, doubtlessly influenced in the decision to a great extent by Luxemburg.Nettl, Rosa Luxemburg, vol. 1, pg. 69. In July 1893 Jogiches financed a new Paris- based socialist publication in the Polish language, Sprawa Robotnicza (The Workers' Cause), which emphasized close cooperation between Polish and Russian radicals in their joint goal of overthrowing Tsarist autocracy and emphasizing the internationalist essence of the socialist movement.Nettl, Rosa Luxemburg, vol. 1, pg. 70. Writing as \\"R. Kruszyńska,\\" Rosa Luxemburg played a key role in contributing content to this paper, soon taking over the editorship. The paper's internationalist political line proved somewhat at odds with the program of the Polish Socialist Party (PPS), however, with the latter emphasizing the aspect of Polish national liberation from Russian control, and consequently no support of the paper by the PPS leadership was to be forthcoming. As Kruszyńska the 23-year old Luxemburg sought admission as a delegate to the 3rd Congress of the Socialist International, held in Zurich from 6 to 12 August 1893, as the representative of Sprawa Robotnicza.Nettl, Rosa Luxemburg, vol. 1, pg. 71. The mandate of the upstart young socialist representing the new independent socialist publication was challenged by the PPS in front of the Congress, however, and by a vote of 9 to 7, with 3 abstentions, Luxemburg was denied a seat at the Congress.Nettl, Rosa Luxemburg, vol. 1, pp. 73-74. Luxemburg departed the gathering under protest — with bad feelings between her and Jogiches on the one hand and the PSP on the other festering further.Nettl, Rosa Luxemburg, vol. 1, pg. 74. Late in 1893, Jogiches and Luxemburg took yet another step towards permanent independence from the mainline Polish socialist movement with the establishment of a new Marxist political party, the Social Democracy of the Kingdom of Poland (SDKP), a group later known as the Social Democracy of the Kingdom of Poland and Lithuania (SDKPiL). This new group stood aloof from PSP, a broad coalition party founded in 1892 and supported by the bulk of the Russian exile community. Revolution of 1905 Jogiches as he appeared at the time of his 1906 arrest in Warsaw The Russian Revolution of 1905 erupted abruptly on \\"Bloody Sunday,\\" 22 January with the shooting deaths of hundreds of peaceful protesters who were attempting to present a petition to Tsar Nicholas II. Within days, protests and strikes calling for establishment of a constitutional order swept the empire, which rocked the state censorship and threatened the stability of the government for months. For the time, Leo Jogiches and his common-law wife, Luxemburg, remained in German exile, their eyes set firmly on the German movement. Jogiches returned to Poland first, traveling to Warsaw in the spring of 1905 to Warsaw to establish the Central Committee of the SDKPiL there together with Julian Marchlewski, Adolf Warski, Felix Dzerzhinsky, and Yakov Hanecki.Nettl, Rosa Luxemburg, pg. 326. Luxemburg remained in Berlin as the representative of the SDKPiL abroad, representing it before the Socialist International and attempting to win support for the organization and its activities among the German socialist movement. Within the SPD Luxemburg, drawing upon the ongoing Russian experience, pushed the idea of the \\"mass strike\\" as a strategic tool for the achievement of power, over the objections of trade unionists and more conservative and electorally- driven party leaders.Nettl, Rosa Luxemburg, vol. 1, pp. 307-308, 311. Jogiches would return to delegate to the annual congress of the SPD, held at Jena in the middle of September 1905.Nettl, Rosa Luxemburg, vol. 1, pp. 306-307. As part of an ongoing battle to radicalize the party's daily newspaper, Vorwärts (Forward), Luxemburg was named to the paper's editorial board in the fall of 1905.Nettl, Rosa Luxemburg, vol. 1, pg. 312. She would spend the months of November and December 1905 churning out aggressive commentary about Russian events for her German readers, attempting to draw analogies between the Russian and German situations whenever possible,Nettl, Rosa Luxemburg, vol. 1, pg. 314. her contributions appearing almost daily.Nettl, Rosa Luxemburg, vol. 1, pg. 316. It was not until the morning of 28 December 1905, that she would board a train for Warsaw in Russian Poland to herself become a direct participant in the ongoing revolutionary effort to overthrow the Tsarist government of the Russian Empire. In March 1906, Luxemburg and Jogiches were arrested for their revolutionary activity. Jogiches was sentenced by the court to 8 years of hard labor followed by lifetime exile to Siberia. He served months in prison before managing to escape across the border to Berlin. Jogiches attended the 1907 London Congress of the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party, where he was elected a candidate member of the party’s governing Central Committee. Split with Luxemburg Leo Jogiches as he appeared in 1910 Although an intelligent person and dedicated revolutionary socialist thinker, Jogiches was virtually incapable of converting his ideas into written words: \\"the mere thought of putting his ideas on paper paralyzes him,\\" Luxemburg later recalled.Ettinger, \\"Comrade and Lover,\\" pg. 133. Consequently, the chief contribution of Jogiches was that of literary stimulant to the skilled publicist Luxemburg as well as behind-the-scenes organizer of the fledgling underground political party that he had helped to establish. As Luxemburg grew in fame as a Marxist theoretician, Jogiches became gradually more embittered about his life, until by his mid-30s, he had come, as one Luxemburg biographer phrased it, to have \\"fully realized the gap between his youthful aspirations and the disillusionments of reality.\\"The words are those of Elzbieta Ettinger. See: Ettinger, \\"Comrade and Lover,\\" pg. 135. Interpersonal conflict followed, exacerbated by the different trajectories of personal achievement, with the pair permanently separating in 1907.Ettinger, \\"Comrade and Lover,\\" pg. 135. Spartakusbund Jogiches was the editor of the illegal Spartacus newsletter, launched in September 1916, from which the underground Spartakusbund took its name On 4 August 1914, the parliamentary representatives of the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD) agreed among themselves to maintain party discipline and voted en bloc in support of a bill authorizing war credits for the Imperial government in the erupting international conflagration that would be remembered to history as World War I.Pierre Broué, The German Revolution, 1917-1923. John Archer, trans. Chicago: Haymarket Books, 2006; pg. 44. This stunning reversal of the Second International's position on capitalist war came as a shock to radical internationalist elements in the party, including Jogiches. Rosa Luxemburg's immediate inclination was to publish and clandestinely circulate a manifesto signed by anti-war leaders of the SPD calling for spontaneous resistance — an effort which Jogiches criticized as no substitute for actual political organization.Broué, The German Revolution, pg. 50. Luxemburg's idea was soon abandoned due to lack of support from the broad circle of party leaders tapped for the effort, of whom no more than a small handful responded. Rosa Luxemburg and a small network of her friends and co-thinkers began to organize themselves politically from the summer of 1914 and into 1915.Broué, The German Revolution, pg. 60. These included Leo Jogiches, Julian Marchlewski, Franz Mehring, and Klara Zetkin, her lawyer Paul Levi, and second secretary of the SPD in Berlin Wilhelm Pieck, among others.Broué, The German Revolution, pg. 61. It would be several months after getting together before the first leaflet of the group would be published. The group sought to make contact with socialists from other European countries through letters to the Swiss socialist press, condemning the war effort and linking the struggle for peace with the class struggle to overthrow autocracy. Imperial authorities were not deaf to the threat of anti-war radicalism gaining a foothold and conscripted left wing parliamentary official Karl Liebknecht on 7 February 1915, only to begin transferring him from one military unit to another in an effort to isolate him and neutralize his influence.Broué, The German Revolution, pg. 58. Luxemburg was similarly targeted not long after, arrested later that same month and held for eight weeks.Broué, The German Revolution, pg. 62. Anti-war sentiment was short-circuited by arrests of leaders and suppression of anti- war publications, but not silenced entirely, with more than 1,000 women demonstrating for peace in front of the Reichstag on 28 May 1915 — further adding to the government's unease.Broué, The German Revolution, pp. 58-59. Active efforts were made to locate active supporters in every locality and every large factory and the radical Luxemburg circle was in contact with individuals in more than 300 places by the middle of 1915. A formal conference was held on 5 May 1915, in the apartment of Wilhelm Pieck to discuss a regional system of organization, which was conceived as a secret network of anti-war militants operating within the SPD. The group began to issue its own newspaper, Die Internationale (The International), edited by Luxemburg and Mehring, only to see it immediately banned. The short-lived paper did provide a handle for the burgeoning underground organization, however, which began to be known as the Internationale group.Broué, The German Revolution, pg. 63. The Internationale group held a conference on 1 January 1916, in the apartment of Karl Liebknecht, attended by 12 delegates.Broué, The German Revolution, pg. 64. This group adopted a program drafted from prison by Rosa Luxemburg and was preparatory to a more authoritative gathering held on 19 March in Berlin. The group did not immediately seek to establish themselves as an independent political party, believing instead that while a new Third International was historically necessary, instead of a sectarian split that would isolate the revolutionary left from the working class ensconced in the SPD, instead the \\"bureaucratic system\\" of the party needed to be made into a \\"democratic system.\\"Broué, The German Revolution, pp. 69-70. They sought to drive out pro- war political leaders, leaving a mass revolutionary party to await the forthcoming national revolution.Broué, The German Revolution, pg. 71. Following the jailing for their anti-war efforts of Liebknecht in May 1916 and Luxemburg that same July, Jogiches took over as the leader of the organization's underground activity.David Fernbach, \\"Memories of Spartacus: Mathilde Jacob and Wolfgang Fernbach,\\" History Workshop Journal, whole no. 48 (Autumn 1999), pg. 207. In JSTOR. As leader of the underground organization it was Jogiches that oversaw the publication of the official newsletter Spartacus, launched in September 1916, which gave a new name to the faction — the Spartakusbund, rendered into English as the Spartacist League. While the revolutionary left chose not to pursue an immediate split, seeking instead to purge the party of its right-wing leadership, the pro-war majority of the SPD worked throughout 1916 to pursue a purge of their own, marked by the 24 May 1916, expulsion of 33 dissident SPD members of the Reichstag from the party for their formal disavowal of the war effort and the October seizure of Vorwärts (Forward) from the SPD's pacifist wing by the pro-war party officialdom.Broué, The German Revolution, pp. 77-78. A national conference of dissident socialists was held in Berlin on 7 January 1917, with 35 of the 157 delegates members of the Spartacistbund.Broué, The German Revolution, pg. 78. This gathering was ruled an effort to \\"sabotage\\" the SPD through factionalism and mass expulsions of leftists followed.Broué, The German Revolution, pg. 79. The acrimony and expulsions within the SPD culminated with a formal split of the party. A Congress was held at Gotha during Easter 1917 by the pacifist center and revolutionary left socialists, with the gathering launching a new organization, the Independent Social Democratic Party of Germany (USPD). About 170,000 members remained with the old pro-war SPD, with the new USPD claiming a membership of 120,000 at its launch — including among its ranks Jogiches and the members of the Spartakusbund. Jogiches would remain in the role of the underground Spartacist group until his own arrest in Berlin on 24 March 1918, at which time the leadership of the Spartacus League passed into the hands of Paul Levi.Paul Frölich, Rosa Luxemburg: Gedanke und Tat (Rosa Luxemburg: Thought and Deed). Paris: Editions Nouvelles Internationales, 1939; pg. 241. Cited in Pierre Broué, The German Revolution, 1917-1923. John Archer, trans. Chicago: Haymarket Books, 2006; pp. 125-126, fn. 60. The Spartakusbund would later become one of the primary forces in the unity congress which established the Communist Party of Germany (KPD) at the end of 1918.Ottokar Luban, The Role of the Spartacist Group after 9 November 1918 and the Formation of the KPD, in: Ralf Hoffrogge and Norman LaPorte (eds.), Weimar Communism as Mass Movement 1918-1933, London: Lawrence & Wishart, 2017, pp. 45-65. Assassination The Spartacus League led the failed German Revolution of 1918/1919 after which Luxemburg and Liebknecht were killed by the right-wing paramilitary Freikorps troops. Jogiches was killed in Moabit prison in Berlin on the 10 March 1919, probably because he was investigating the assassination of Luxemburg and Liebknecht.

Its movements have been described as: : Two fists are fast like the falling rain drops, and fast like a snapping whip. Fānziquán routines are usually quite short and very fast. It is a source of many other modern styles like Eagle Claw. History Until at least the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644), Fānziquán was known as Bāshǎnfān (; literally \\"8 flash tumbles\\"), or \\"8 evasive tumbles\\" and is attributed to General Qi Jiguang. Whereas in the Qing Dynasty it art is known as BāfānMén (). According to the Bafanquan manuals, during the Ming dynasty a master named Wang Zhiyuan had been taught the boxing by a mountain wanderer in the turn of the 17th century. It is said that Master Wang was an accomplished warrior but had become injured in battle in a remote part of what is currently Shandong province. There, the wanderer assisted with Master Wang's injuries and instructed him in the methods of Bafanquan to improve his already good martial skills. The style then passed down through various generations in the Northern provinces such as Henan, Hebei and Shandong. During the Qing dynasty, one of the most famous exponents of the style was Master Li Gongran from Xiong county in Hebei province. During that time he became a famed boxer, and it was claimed that \\"from Nanjing to Beijing, all Fanzi under heaven belongs to Li Gong (Grandmaster Li)\\". This indicated how key he was to the spread and development of the style. His son Li Erlou, and disciple Feng Zhenyuan, taught the style in Sunning county. Their students founded many \\"Security Logistics Bureaus\\". In modern times, Fānziquán is often taught in conjunction with Chuōjiǎo, not unlike how Xíngyìquán and Bāguàzhǎng are often taught together. The routines of Chuōjiǎo, with its kicks, wide open stances and focus on hard power, were known as Martial Routines and those of Fānziquán, with their more compact movements combining soft and hard power, were known as Scholarly Routines, which is why the Chuōjiǎo/Fānziquán combination is known as Wen Wu or Martial-Scholar. Both Fānziquán and Chuōjiǎo are associated with the 12th century Song Dynasty general Yue Fei, and the association between the two may date that far back. However, as a legendary figure, Yue Fei has had many martial arts attributed to him. Nonetheless, the association between the two is very old. By the mid-19th century, Zhao Canyi, a general in the failed Taiping Rebellion, was a master of both styles. After the failure of the rebellion, Zhao went into seclusion in Raoyang, Hebei Province, where he taught Fānziquán, which emphasizes the hands, to the Wang family and Chuōjiǎo, which emphasizes the feet, to the Duan family. During practice, the families would exchange techniques. The complete system of Fānziquán of Hebei province is rarely practiced today. The Dongbei Style of Fānziquán is the most popular and was also the basis on which the Modern Wushu Fānziquán routines have been based. Elements or parts of Old BāfānMén have been spread under many banners. Liu DeKuan taught a set of Ba Fan Shou in Beijing which has been practiced by his descendants. The Eagle Claw style, which is a derivative of Fānziquán, includes a set of Xingquan and Lianquan which are said to be the essence of the style and are based on some parts of BāfānMén. In turn the Yingzhao Fanziquan style is a combination of Fanzi, Eagle Claw and Leopard Kung Fu. The Ma Family Tongbei System of North Western China includes the Dongbei variants of Fānziquán. The Mianzhang style (Duanquan) was combined with Hebei Fanzi to create the style Mianzhang Fanzi. Throughout history, BāfānMén's techniques have been admired by many masters and as a result it is often recognized as Muquan, or Mother Fist, in representing how essential it is to the Chinese Martial Arts.

Photo, Nils Fretwurst, 2005 Cathedral glass is the name given commercially to monochromatic sheet glass. It is thin by comparison with slab glass, may be coloured, and is textured on one side. The name draws from the fact that windows of stained glass were a feature of medieval European cathedrals from the 10th century onwards. The term cathedral glass is sometimes applied erroneously to the windows of cathedrals as an alternative to the term stained glass. Stained glass is the material and the art form of making coloured windows of elaborate or pictorial design. Manufacture=Traditional methods of making coloured glass Very early architectural glass, like that sometimes found in excavations of Roman baths, was cast. The molten glass was poured into a mold of wood or stone to make a sheet of glass. The texture of the mold material would be picked up by the glass. By the time stained glass was being made, the glassblowing pipe was in common use, so hand-blown (or mouth-blown) sheets were made by the cylinder glass and/or crown glass method. Casting came back as a common technique when rolled glass began to be manufactured in the mid-1830s and as glass jewels (also used for architectural glass) became popular. Rolled glass is not as rich and translucent as hand-blown glass, but it is much cheaper and is made in a variety of colors and textures, making it a useful decorative material. Stencilled cathedral glass in a leadlight window from a chapel Modern methods of making cathedral glass This type of rolled glass is produced by pouring molten glass onto a metal or graphite table and immediately rolling it into a sheet using a large metal cylinder, similar to rolling out a pie crust. The rolling can be done by hand or machine. Glass can be \\"double rolled\\", which means it is passed through two cylinders at once to yield glass of a certain thickness (approximately 3/16\\".) Glass made this way is never fully transparent, but it does not necessarily have much texture. It can be pushed and tugged while molten to achieve certain effects. For more distinct textures the metal cylinder is imprinted with a pattern that is pressed into the molten glass as it passes through the rollers. The glass is then annealed. Rolled glass was first commercially produced around the 1830s and is widely used today. It is often called cathedral glass, but this has nothing to do with medieval cathedrals, where the glass used was hand-blown. Cathedral glass comes in a very wide variety of colors and surface textures including hammered, rippled, seedy, and marine textures. It is made in the US, England, Germany, and China. Uses Cathedral glass has been used extensively in churches (often for non-pictorial windows) and for decorative glass in domestic and commercial buildings, both leaded and not, often in conjunction with drawn sheet glass and sometimes with decorative sections of beveled glass. It lets in light while reducing visibility and is an inexpensive, but useful and decorative material. While it does not have the richness and versatility of hand-blown glass, it has been used successfully for the creation of modern stained-glass windows in which the texture of the glass is treated, with the color, as a significant design element.

The trilogy, as a whole, portrays his rise from common boy to the autocrat The Anome, and finally, as a saviour of his world against the alien Asutra of the third book. The three books in the trilogy are, in reading and publication order: * The Anome * The Brave Free Men * The Asutra  Plot summary  The land of Shant on the planet Durdane is ruled by a purposely anonymous dictator called the Anome or Faceless Man. He maintains control by virtue of the torc, a ring of explosive placed around the neck of every adult in Shant. The Anome is the product of a self-perpetuating, self-selecting dynasty. When one Anome grows old, he chooses his successor, a system hundreds of years old. The reason for this harsh system of government is the extreme individuality of the folk of Shant. They are divided into dozens of different cantons, each with very distinctive customs and laws, united only by a common language. Prior to the ascendancy of the Faceless Man, Shant was plagued by constant civil war and dissension. The Faceless Man not only provides the glue that holds Shant together; he communicates anonymously with the cantonal leaders. Those who lose their heads are largely those who have violated local law. The protagonist of the trilogy is Gastel Etzwane, the son of a prostitute and an anonymous musician. The first two volumes chronicle his coming of age, his discovery of the identity of his father, his struggles to become a musician himself, the murder of his mother and sister by a race of alien barbarian invaders known as the Roguskhoi, and his struggle for revenge against them. This leads to Etzwane's discovering the identity of the Anome, who, strangely passive, refuses to mobilize the armies of Shant against the aliens. Etzwane is forced to assume the role of Anome himself and, through luck and improvisation, leads an eventually successful struggle against the invaders. In response to the social upheaval caused by the war, Etzwane lays down his office, and the torc system is abolished. In the third and final volume, Etzwane learns - the hard way - that the invaders were the creation of an alien race known as the Asutra, who designed these caricatures of humanity in a first assay at biological warfare against the peoples of Durdane. Since the Roguskhoi are all males, they can only reproduce by sexual intercourse with human women, and they are insanely lustful. The resulting \\"imps\\" have no genetic relationship to the human mother, who is a host only. This process, by design, also renders the woman sterile. The trilogy is set in the same broad Gaean Reach milieu of many of Vance's books. Like most of his work, it is full of color, ornately bizarre cultures and heroic adventure.  Publication history  The Durdane trilogy was originally published in The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction, in six parts, two per novel, between February 1971 and June 1973: *\\"The Faceless Man\\" (part one of two), The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction, February 1971 *\\"The Faceless Man\\" (part two of two), The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction, March 1971 *\\"The Brave Free Men\\" (part one of two), The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction, July 1972 *\\"The Brave Free Men\\" (part two of two), The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction, August 1972 *\\"The Asutra\\" (part one of two), The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction, May 1973 *\\"The Asutra\\" (part two of two), The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction, June 1973 The trilogy was first published in book form in the U.S. by Dell, with the title of the first part changed to The Anome: The Anome (1973), The Brave Free Men (1973), The Asutra (1974). The first U.K. publication was by Coronet: The Anome (1975), The Brave Free Men (1975), The Asutra (1975).

Famous examples include the original Britannia Bridge over the Menai Strait, the Conwy railway bridge over the River Conwy, designed and tested by William Fairbairn and built by Robert Stephenson between 1846 and 1850, and the original Victoria Bridge in Montreal. Conwy and Britannia Bridges Conwy Bridge.Construction of second tube, September, 1848 The Conwy railway bridge carries the North Wales coast railway line across the River Conwy between Llandudno Junction and the town of Conwy. The wrought iron tubular bridge was built by Robert Stephenson to a design by William Fairbairn, and is similar in construction to Stephenson's other famous tubular bridge, the Britannia Bridge across the Menai Strait. It was officially opened in 1849, but had been completed in 1848. Being the first tubular bridge to be built, the design needed much testing on prototypes to confirm that it would be capable of carrying heavy locomotives, the testing being performed by Fairbairn. The successful result enabled the much larger Britannia bridge to be built. The current Conwy bridge has been reinforced by extra columns under the bridge into the river, but is otherwise virtually unchanged since it was built. Before the Britannia Bridge was constructed, Fairbairn conducted \\"the most celebrated of all engineering experiments on the grand scale\\" a series of experiments \\"of a gigantic character\\". One-sixth scale models, 78 ft long, were built at Fairbairn's Millwall Iron Works and tested with increasing loads. By this means, although at an experimental cost of thousands of pounds, the design of the cellular girder was refined until it could carry loads of 2.4 times the original capacity. The most significant finding was that of a thin section's susceptibility to buckling under compression loads, and the cellular girder's resistance to this. Stephenson's would build around a thousand other bridges using this cellular structure. The most impressive test was performed on-site at Conway. The 1300 ton tubular girder, deflecting 8 inches under its own weight, was loaded with a further 300 tons and the deflection measured. The effects of wind loading and asymmetric thermal expansion due to sunlight were also studied. Chepstow and Tamar Bridges At Chepstow, a tubular railway bridge was built to the instructions of Isambard Kingdom Brunel in 1852. The \\"Great Tubular Bridge\\" over the River Wye, which at that point forms the boundary between Wales and England, is considered one of Brunel's major achievements, despite its appearance. It was economical in its use of materials, and would prove to be the design prototype for Brunel's Royal Albert Bridge at Saltash. Other bridges The unconventional nature of the tubular girder bridge was not widely accepted. John Fowler's 1847 tubular girder design for Torksey used tubes that were only 10 foot high and placed the railway deck between them, rather than inside. This is now considered as the first box girder bridge, rather than a pure tubular bridge. Despite this, it was initially rejected after completion by the Board of Trade’s inspector, Captain Lintorn Simmons, and the design was also criticized by the Institution of Civil Engineers. When the bridge was strengthened in 1897, this was done by added a central truss above the deck rather than by strengthening the box. Legacy Section of the original wrought-iron tubular Britannia Bridge standing in front of the modern bridge Original Britannia Bridge Since the destruction by fire of Britannia Bridge in 1970, Conwy railway bridge remains the only surviving example of this means of construction undertaken by Stephenson. In the case of the Britannia Bridge this technology allowed a bridge with spans up to long to be constructed, when until then the longest wrought iron span had been .

Established in 1882 primarily to advance the Navy's modernization efforts, ONI is the oldest member of the United States Intelligence Community and serves as the nation's premier source of maritime intelligence. Since the First World War, its mission has broadened to include real-time reporting on the developments and activities of foreign navies; protecting maritime resources and interests; monitoring and countering transnational maritime threats; providing technical, operational, and tactical support to the U.S. Navy and its partners; and surveying the global maritime environment. ONI employs over 3,000 military and civilian personnel worldwide and is headquartered at the National Maritime Intelligence Center in Suitland, Maryland. History Despite playing an active and decisive role in the American Civil War, in the following years the U.S. Navy fell into precipitous decline. A lack of both federal funding and public interest reduced the Navy's size, prestige, and technological superiority; whereas steel ships were increasingly the norm, the U.S. Navy was entirely wood-based. Towards the end of the 19th century, American naval power had become vastly obsolete compared to Europe, and even lagged behind the navies of less developed nations such as Chile. In an era of rapid industrialization, globalized commerce, and colonial expansion, the prevailing military theory of the time held that navies were critical to the commercial and strategic interests of a nation, as well as a source of national prestige and power projection. In light of these developments, American naval officers and military strategists advocated for a larger and more technologically advanced navy that could protect the U.S.' vast maritime borders, safeguard its commercial interests, and project power abroad. Among the leading reformers was Navy Lieutenant Theodorus Bailey Myers Mason, who called for the creation of a naval intelligence office dedicated to gathering information on foreign navies and the latest in naval science to help rebuild the U.S. Navy. William H. Hunt, who served briefly as Secretary of the Navy under President James Garfield, formed a Naval Advisory Board tasked with rebuilding the Navy and bringing it up to par to global standards. Largely in response to Mason's recommendations, on March 23, 1882, Hunt issued General Order No. 292, which read: The new Office of Naval Intelligence would be headquartered in the State, War and Navy Building (now the Old Executive Office Building), with Mason appointed as its first \\"Chief Intelligence Office\\". As originally conceived, ONI assisted in the Navy's advancement by dispatching naval attachés around the world to acquire data and resources related to the latest in naval warfare. These findings would be analyzed, interpreted, and disseminated to Navy leaders and government officials, helping to inform policies and programs related to naval development. Expansion Mason was succeeded as Chief Intelligence Officer by Rear Admiral Raymond P. Rodgers in April 1885. In addition to intensifying ONI's research and surveillance of naval technology abroad, Rodger's four-year tenure saw ONI partner with the U.S. Department of State in gathering information on strategic maritime interests such as Panama, Samoa, and the Kingdom of Hawaii. ONI also began to develop capabilities in cryptography, which would foreshadow its evolution into a full-fledged military intelligence office. In 1890, one year after Rodger's departure from ONI, the office was transferred from the Bureau of Navigation to the Secretary of the Navy, solidifying its key role in the Navy's growth and development. ONI's emergence as a proper naval intelligence arm began in earnest with the Spanish–American War of 1898. Naval operations were critical in the conflict, and ONI was responsible for protecting Navy Personnel, providing tactical support, and implementing counter-intelligence measures. Nevertheless, weaknesses in its intelligence gathering were revealed.Arlington National Cemetery Website: Raymond P. Rodgers, Rear Admiral, United States Navy ONI grew in prominence under President Theodore Roosevelt, a former Assistant Secretary of the Navy and naval enthusiast. His expansionist foreign policy — and the central role the U.S. Navy played therein — made maritime intelligence more crucial. The sailing of the \\"Great White Fleet\\" around the world between 1906 and 1907, which included sixteen newly constructed steel battleships, showcased new- found American seapower and validated ONI's efforts. By 1911, the U.S. was constructing super-dreadnoughts at a pace that would eventually become competitive with Britain. American entry into the First World War in 1917 marked a turning point in the office's history. President Woodrow Wilson was an exponent of the importance of a strong navy to U.S. defense. Under his administration, Congress authorized ONI's first major increase in personnel and funding, and expanded its role to include domestic security operations — namely the protection of U.S. ports, harbors, and maritime facilities from enemy infiltration and sabotage. ONI's mandate often entailed partnering with the departments of State, War, Justice, Commerce, and Labor. Due to the increasingly sensitive nature of its work, ONI also began to censor radio and mail communications, which further marked its development as a major intelligence office. During the 1920s and 1930s, many of ONI's activities were dedicated to Japan, which was an increasingly advanced and belligerent naval power. The office investigated Japanese fortifications in the Pacific, acquired information on Japanese military aircraft and weaponry, and partnered with the U.S. Army's Military Intelligence Division and the Federal Bureau of Investigation to monitor potentially subversive elements within the Japanese American community; ONI's director, Rear Admiral Walter Stratton Anderson, met weekly with his counterparts in the FBI and MID to gather and share information on suspected internal threats. In 1929, Chief of Naval Operations William D. Leahy made permanent ONI's functions as an intelligence office, while in 1939, President Franklin D. Roosevelt granted the office considerable authority on matters of domestic security. World War II Following Japan's attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941, concerns about subversive activity by Japanese Americans grew more pressing. ONI commissioned Kenneth Ringle, assistant district intelligence officer for the Eleventh Naval District in Los Angeles, to conduct a thorough investigation of the resident Japanese population. He found little evidence of Japanese American saboteurs, and in his final report to President Roosevelt, advised against mass incarceration, a view that was shared by most ONI officials, but that was largely ignored by the Army and War Department. The Second World War would see another expansion of ONI's duties and a subsequent increase in its budget and staff. The office established two intelligence schools that trained hundreds of Intel officers for the Navy. Its Special Activities Branch offered critical intelligence on German U-boat technology, operations, and tactics, which proved decisive in the Battle of the Atlantic. ONI supplied U.S. forces with ship and aircraft recognition manuals, provided photographic specialists for identifying enemy vessels, assisted in naval mission planning, and was responsible for the translation, evaluation, and dissemination of intercepted Japanese communications. Cold War While other parts of the Navy were downsized after the war, U.S. Fleet Admiral Chester Nimitz ensured ONI's continued strength, which was to prove important during the Cold War. Secretary of the Navy James Forrestal broadened ONI's mandate to include investigations of major criminal and security matters. In 1946, the Operational Intelligence Section was formed to provide fleet commanders with real-time analysis of the maritime activities and positions of foreign naval forces, namely the Soviet Navy. The Navy Field Operational Intelligence Office (NFOIO) was established in 1957 to provide more advanced signals intelligence and timely information on the intent of enemy forces. ONI also made a concerted effort to enhance its technical and scientific resources, diversifying its personnel to reflect a wider range of expertise. The Navy Scientific and Technical Intelligence Center (NAVSTIC) was established in 1968 and shortly thereafter was folded into the Navy Reconnaissance and Technical Support Center (NRTSC). In response to the threat posed by nuclear-armed Soviet submarines, ONI developed the Sound Surveillance System (SOSUS) and the Ocean Surveillance Information system (OSIS), allowing the U.S. Navy to monitor and deter these threats. Consolidation and transformation Beginning in 1988, and following the end of the Cold War, ONI's headquarters was moved to its current location in the National Maritime Intelligence Center (NMIC) in Suitland, Maryland. It was joined by Coast Guard Intelligence (CGI), which is responsible for domestic maritime operations, and the Marine Corps Intelligence Activity, which supports expeditionary missions in littoral areas. The housing of all three of the nation's principal maritime intelligence agencies was intended to facilitate data sharing and coordination. Since the start of the Global War on Terror in 2001—and the subsequently large role played by the U.S. Navy in related conflicts in Afghanistan, Iraq, and the Horn of Africa—ONI has experienced further expansion of its duties and functions. The year 2009 was characterized by a major reorganization of the office. Chief of Naval Operations Admiral Gary Roughead authorized ONI's conversion into a command with four subordinate commands, each with a specialized function: scientific and technical intelligence, operational intelligence, information services and technology, and expeditionary and special warfare support. All four commands were collocated in NMIC, which was afterward designated by the Director of National Intelligence as the nation's central source for integrated strategic maritime intelligence. The same year, the Information Dominance Corps (IDC) was established by the Navy to train enlisted sailors and officers in a wide range of supporting intelligence capabilities. The IDC was redesignated in 2016 as the information warfare Community (IWC), with a greater emphasis on inter-disciplinary expertise in sustaining the U.S. Navy's operational and technological superiority. ONI provides the IWC with critical maritime intelligence and real-time global maritime surveillance. The 21st century has also seen an extension of ONI's support beyond the Navy and U.S. government and towards relevant academic and commercial partners. In addition to operations related to the War on Terror, contemporary challenges that rely upon maritime intelligence include anti-piracy efforts, surveillance of potential maritime conflict zones (such as the territorial disputes in the South China Sea), and monitoring the activities and developments in emerging rival navies (such as those of China, Russia, and Iran). Organization and personnel According to its official website, ONI's organizational structure is specifically designed to \\"strengthen the Navy's conventional and irregular war fighting capacities, and to expand our foresight into new technologies, future platforms, weapons, sensors, C4ISR and cyber capabilities\\". ONI is based in the National Maritime Intelligence Center (NMIC), located on the grounds of the Suitland Federal Center in Suitland, Maryland. It is collocated with its four specialized subcommands, known as \\"Centers of Excellence\\" – the Nimitz Operational Intelligence Center, Farragut Technical Analysis Center, Kennedy Irregular Warfare Center, and the Hopper Information Services Center. Since 2009, the facility has been designed to facilitate 24-hour-a-day coordination, collaboration, and analysis of maritime intelligence among ONI's subcommands, as well as its counterparts in the Marine Corps and Coast Guard. This integration is intended to offer both comprehensive and rapid intelligence to a broad range of stakeholders. ONI is led by a commander, formally known as the Commander, Office of Naval Intelligence (COMONI), who also serves as Director of the National Maritime Intelligence Integration Office (NMIIO), the national intelligence community center for maritime issues under ODNI. The COMONI's functions including fulfilling the national maritime intelligence duties required by the Navy, Department of Defense (DoD), and wider intelligence community. There is also a Deputy Commander, who serves as the Commander’s primary assistant and adviser; a Chief Staff Officer, who directs the activities of staff directors and officers, and serves as the point of contact for other commands; and the Command Master Chief, who leads the enlisted personnel and advises the COMONI, Deputy Commander, and Chief of Staff on command policy. ONI employs over 3,000 military and civilian personnel worldwide, including contractors. Its staff includes intelligence analysts, scientists, engineers, and other qualified specialists. In addition to its permanent staff, ONI is supported by more than 800 Navy Reservists, who assist the office during weekend drills and active duty. Nimitz Operational Intelligence Center Named after World War II Fleet Admiral Chester W. Nimitz, the Nimitz Operational Intelligence Center has responsibility for Maritime Domain Awareness (MDA) and Global Maritime Intelligence Integration (GMII), which allows it to maintain the U.S. Navy's warfighting superiority by delivering precise and timely information on the capability and position of enemy naval forces. Farragut Technical Analysis Center Named for Admiral David Farragut, the Farragut Technical Analysis Center is the U.S. Navy's Center of Excellence for strategic scientific and technical intelligence (S&TI;) analysis of foreign technologies, sensors, weapons, platforms, combat systems, C4ISR, and cyber capabilities. In addition to its all-source capabilities, the Farragut Center conducts ONI's foreign materiel exploitation, signal intelligence analysis, modeling and simulation, and is home to the national maritime acoustic intelligence laboratory. The Farragut is one of four Centers of Excellence that are distinct Commands under the Office of Naval Intelligence (ONI). Kennedy Irregular Warfare Center Commanded by a captain, the Kennedy Center provides support to Navy Special Warfare and Navy Expeditionary Combat Command forces by providing intelligence on potential threats posed by asymmetrical warfare. Analysts are often called upon to perform other tasks and duties within this specialized area. Hopper Information Services Center Named for Rear Admiral Grace Hopper, the Hopper Center provides information services that support global maritime and intelligence operations. Its staff consists of more than 850 information technology specialists based in 42 locations in 11 countries. The center also assists in the integration, testing, fielding, and maintenance of advanced technologies utilized by ONI and its centers.

This species is employed as a solution in water or alcohols. It is a common base in organic chemistry. Relative to more conventional inorganic bases, such as KOH and NaOH, Bu4NOH is more soluble in organic solvents.. Preparation and reactions Solutions of Bu4NOH are usually prepared in situ from butylammonium halides, Bu4NX, for example by reacting them with silver oxide or using an ion exchange resin. Attempts to isolate Bu4NOH induces Hofmann elimination, leading to Bu3N and 1-butene. Solutions of Bu4NOH are typically contaminated with Bu3N for this reason. Treatment of Bu4NOH with a wide range of acids gives water and the other tetrabutylammonium salts: Bu4NOH + HX -> Bu4NX + H2O Applications Bu4NOH is a strong base that is used often under phase-transfer conditions to effect alkylations and deprotonations. Typical reactions include benzylation of amines and generation of dichlorocarbene from chloroform. Bu4NOH can be neutralized with a variety of mineral acids to give lipophilic salts of the conjugate base. For example, treatment of Bu4NOH with disodium pyrophosphate, Na2H2P2O7, gives (Bu4N)3[HP2O7], which is soluble in organic solvents. Similarly, neutralization of Bu4NOH with hydrofluoric acid affords an relatively water-free Bu4NF. This salt dissolves in organic solvents and is useful to desilylation.

Meanwhile, Clare Bennett (Eleanor Powell) is a big Broadway star. Owing to a case of mistaken identity, Shaw is offered the chance to be Clare's dancing partner in a new Broadway show, when Johnny's dancing was really what producer Bob Casey (Frank Morgan) saw and wanted. The partnership breaks up, but Johnny still helps out King, who lets his newfound success go to his head. Clare eventually realizes that Johnny, not King, is the better dancer, and she falls in love after having lunch with him. When Shaw gets drunk on opening night, Johnny steps in and saves the show with a brilliant performance, though he lets King think he did it himself. Clare later tells King the truth. Just before the next show, Clare discovers King drunk again, and Johnny becomes the permanent replacement. After the show, they find out that King was pretending to be drunk so that Johnny would get the job.TCM Full synopsisBrenner, Paul Description (Allmovie) Cast * Fred Astaire as Johnny Brett * Eleanor Powell as Clare Bennett * George Murphy as King Shaw * Frank Morgan as Bob Casey * Ian Hunter as Bert C.

Schary would go on to be head of production (1948) and then president (1951) of MGM until 1956. The film was originally planned to be shot in Technicolor, but because of the unsettled state of Europe due to World War II, MGM decided to stick to black and white.TCM Notes The film was the fourth and final entry in MGM's loosely connected Broadway Melody series, which began with the original The Broadway Melody released in 1929, and was followed by Broadway Melody of 1936 and Broadway Melody of 1938. The films were unconnected except for the use of the song \\"Broadway Melody\\" (the 1940 entry did not feature the number, although a bit of it can be heard over the film's opening credits), and the fact that Powell starred in the 1936, 1938 and 1940 entries, playing different roles in each. A fifth Broadway Melody film was planned for release in the early 1940s, pairing Eleanor Powell with Gene Kelly, but production was cancelled at the rehearsal stage. Another production was to have been called Broadway Melody of 1944 but was instead renamed Broadway Rhythm. The 1940 entry is considered Powell's last major successful film, as she would go on to appear in a succession of only moderate hits before retiring from the screen several years later. It has the distinction of being the first non-documentary film featuring Powell to be released on DVD. Fred Astaire had just left RKO, and Broadway Melody of 1940 was his first film for MGM since his small part in 1933's Dancing Lady. Astaire was reportedly slightly intimidated by Powell, as she was considered one of the few female dancers capable of out-performing Astaire. According to Powell in her introduction to the book, The MGM Story, the feeling was somewhat mutual. Powell recalled finally saying to Astaire, \\"Look, we can't go on like this. I'm Ellie; you're Fred. We're just two hoofers,\\" after which, they got along well, and rehearsed so much they wore out their pianist.Fristoe, Roger \\"Broadway Melody of 1940\\" (TCM article) Broadway Melody of 1940 was in production from early September until late November 1939.

Selected-ion flow-tube mass spectrometry (SIFT- MS) is a quantitative mass spectrometry technique for trace gas analysis which involves the chemical ionization of trace volatile compounds by selected positive precursor ions during a well-defined time period along a flow tube. Absolute concentrations of trace compounds present in air, breath or the headspace of bottled liquid samples can be calculated in real time from the ratio of the precursor and product ion signal ratios, without the need for sample preparation or calibration with standard mixtures. The detection limit of commercially available SIFT-MS instruments extends to the single digit pptv range. The instrument is an extension of the selected ion flow tube, SIFT, technique, which was first described in 1976 by Adams and Smith.\\"The selected ion flow tube (SIFT); A technique for studying ion-neutral reactions\\" Adams N.G., Smith D.; International Journal of Mass Spectrometry and Ion Physics 21 (1976) pp349-359. It is a fast flow tube/ion swarm method to react positive or negative ions with atoms and molecules under truly thermalised conditions over a wide range of temperatures. It has been used extensively to study ion- molecule reaction kinetics. Its application to ionospheric and interstellar ion chemistry over a 20-year period has been crucial to the advancement and understanding of these topics. SIFT-MS was initially developed for use in human breath analysis, and has shown great promise as a non-invasive tool for physiological monitoring and disease diagnosis. It has since shown potential for use across a wide variety of fields, particularly in the life sciences, such as agriculture and animal husbandry, environmental research and food technology. SIFT-MS has been popularised as a technology which is sold and marketed by Syft Technologies based in Christchurch, New Zealand.  Instrumentation  In the selected ion flow tube mass spectrometer, SIFT-MS, ions are generated in a microwave plasma ion source, usually from a mixture of laboratory air and water vapor. From the formed plasma, a single ionic species is selected using a quadrupole mass filter to act as \\"precursor ions\\" (also frequently referred to as primary or reagent ions in SIFT-MS and other processes involving chemical ionization). In SIFT-MS analyses, H3O+, NO+ and O2+ are used as precursor ions, and these have been chosen because they are known not to react significantly with the major components of air (nitrogen, oxygen, etc.), but can react with many of the very low level (trace) gases. The selected precursor ions are injected into a flowing carrier gas (usually helium at a pressure of 1 Torr) via a Venturi orifice (~1 mm diameter) where they travel along the reaction flow tube by convection. Concurrently, the neutral analyte molecules of a sample vapor enter the flow tube, via a heated sampling tube, where they meet the precursor ions and may undergo chemical ionization, depending on their chemical properties, such as their proton affinity or ionization energy. The newly formed \\"product ions\\" flow into the mass spectrometer chamber, which contains a second quadrupole mass filter, and an electron multiplier detector, which are used to separate the ions by their mass-to-charge ratios (m/z) and measure the count rates of the ions in the desired m/z range.  Analysis  The concentrations of individual compounds can be derived largely using the count rates of the precursor and product ions, and the reaction rate coefficients, k. Exothermic proton transfer reactions with H3O+ are assumed to proceed at the collisional rate (see Collision theory), the coefficient for which, kc, is calculable using the method described by Su and Chesnavich,\\"Parametrization of the ion-polar molecule collision rate constant by trajectory calculations\\" Su T., Chesnavich W.J.; Journal of Chemical Physics 76 (1982) pp5183-5186. providing the polarizability and dipole moment are known for the reactant molecule. NO+ and O2+ reactions proceed at kc less frequently, and thus the reaction rates of the reactant molecule with these precursor ions must often be derived experimentally by comparing the decline in the count rates of each of the NO+ and O2+ precursor ions to that of H3O+ as the sample flow of reactant molecules is increased.\\"Selected ion flow tube mass spectrometry (SIFT-MS) for on-line trace gas analysis\\" Smith D., Španěl P.; Mass Spectrometry Reviews 24 (2005) pp661– 700. The product ions and rate coefficients have been derived in this way for well over 200 volatile compounds, which can be found in the scientific literature.\\"An index of the literature for bimolecular gas phase cation-molecule reaction kinetics\\" Anicich, V. G.; JPL-Publication-03-19 Pasadena, CA, USA http://hdl.handle.net/2014/7981 The instrument can be programmed either to scan across a range of masses to produce a mass spectrum (Full Scan, FS, mode), or to rapidly switch between only the m/z values of interest (Multiple Ion Monitoring, MIM, mode). Due to the different chemical properties of the aforementioned precursor ions (H3O+, NO+, and O2+), different FS mode spectra can be produced for a vapor sample, and these can give different information relating to the composition of the sample. Using this information, it is often possible to identify the trace compound(s) that are present. The MIM mode, on the other hand will usually employ a much longer dwell time on each ion, and as a result, accurate quantification is possible to the parts per billion (ppb) level. SIFT-MS utilises an extremely soft ionisation process which greatly simplifies the resulting spectra and thereby facilitates the analysis of complex mixtures of gases, such as human breath. Another very soft ionization technique is secondary electrospray ionization (SESI-MS). For example, even proton-transfer-reaction mass spectrometry (PTR- MS), another soft ionisation technology that uses the H3O+ reagent ion, has been shown to give considerably more product ion fragmentation than SIFT-MS.K. Buhr, S. van Ruth, C. Delahunty, Analysis of volatile flavour compounds by Proton Transfer Reaction-Mass Spectrometry: fragmentation patterns and discrimination between isobaric and isomeric compounds, Int. J. Mass Spectrom., 221, 1-7 (2002) Another key feature of SIFT-MS is the upstream mass quadrupole, which allows the use of multiple precursor ions. The ability to use three precursor ions, H3O+, NO+ and O2+, to obtain three different spectra is extremely valuable because it allows the operator to analyse a much wider variety of compounds. An example of this is methane, which cannot be analysed using H3O+ as a precursor ion (because it has a proton affinity of 543.5kJ/mol, somewhat less than that of H2O), but can be analysed using O2+.\\"Quantification of methane in humid air and exhaled breath using selected ion flow tube mass spectrometry\\" Dryahina K., Smith D., Španěl P.; Rapid Communications in Mass Spectrometry 24 (2010) pp1296–1304. Furthermore, the parallel use of three precursor ions may allow the operator to distinguish between two or more compounds that react to produce ions of the same mass-to- charge ratio in certain spectra. For example, dimethyl sulfide (C2H6S, 62 amu) accepts a proton when it reacts with H3O+ to generate C2H7S+ product ions which appear at m/z 63 in the resulting spectrum. This may conflict with other product ions, such as the association product from the reaction with carbon dioxide, H3O+CO2, and the single hydrate of the protonated acetaldehyde ion, C2H5O+(H2O), which also appear at m/z 63, and so it may be unidentifiable in certain samples. However dimethyl sulfide reacts with NO+ by charge transfer, to produce the ion C2H6S+, which appears at m/z 62 in resulting spectra, whereas carbon dioxide does not react with NO+, and acetaldehyde donates a hydride ion, giving a single product ion at m/z 43, C2H3O+, and so dimethyl sulfide can be easily distinguished. Over recent years, advances in SIFT-MS technology have vastly increased the sensitivity of these devices such that the limits of detection now extend down to the single-digit-ppt level.B.J.

Established in 1996, when the city's principal wholesale fruit and vegetable market in Kothawal Chavadi had to be closed. The market is one of the largest of its kind in Asia. In 2013, construction of an exclusive foodgrains market, the first such facility in the state, began at the market complex at a cost of 690.7 million. Constructed in an area of 14.41 acres, next to the existing wholesale vegetable market, it was to be opened by mid-2014. Koyambedu Roundtana Koyambedu Junction otherwise known as the Koyambedu Roundtana is an important road junction in Chennai. It is located north of the Chennai Mofussil Bus Terminus at the junction of the Inner Ring Road and the NH4. The junction is a part of the Golden Quadrilateral project taken up under the National Highways Development Project. Sewage treatment plants There are two sewage treatment plants at Koyambedu and they jointly have the capacity to treat 94 million litres a day (mld) of sewage generated in localities such as T. Nagar, Kodambakkam, Anna Nagar, Virugambakkam and Mogappair. The sewage treatment capacity of the city is set to be enhanced with Chennai Metrowater preparing to float tenders for construction of another plant to treat 20 mld at Koyambedu. The new plant will facilitate treating of more sewage - generated in the neighboring suburbs. The 1,160-million project, which was sanctioned under Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission, will come up at a 25-acre site in the existing facility at Koyambedu. The new plant will take in the additional volume from suburbs such as Maduravoyal, Ambattur, Nerkundram and Nolambur that are being provided with sewerage network. Unlike the existing facilities, the infrastructure to generate electricity from sewage will be provided during the construction of the plant. The project will be commissioned in two years. This will add to the existing nine facilities having a capacity of 486 mld in Kodungaiyur and Nesapakkam. The two upcoming STPs will have a treatment capacity of 114 mld.Koyambedu to get third sewage treatment plant Chennai Mofussil Bus Terminus or CMBT CMBT Spread over an area of 37 acre in Koyambedu is the largest bus terminus in Asia and is accredited with the ISO 9001:2000 quality certification.

It was built by the Government of Tamil Nadu to provide accommodation during the 7th South Asian Federation Games (or SAF Games) event held in Chennai (then Madras) in 1995 to the sportspersons who participated in it. Later, the flats were taken over by Government institutions under various projects of the Tamil Nadu Government and promoted as a large residential complex. Approximately 100 officers belonging to the IAS, IPS, IFS, IRS, IA&AS;, IPoS, etc. reside here. The dwelling units coming under the control of organizations such as the RBI, Indianoil and SBI, Income tax and central excise departments present a pretty picture. The development of this area also led to a tremendous increase in the value of property touching even ₹ 1 to 1.5 crores per ground. South Asian Federation (SAF) Games Village is famous for its greenery, even though it is close to the Chennai Mofussil Bus Terminus. It has beautiful parks, which form an ideal place for kids to enjoy and for morning walkers and joggers.

He fiercely resisted politicians' demand to loosen monetary policy, thereby increasing the pressure on politicians to reduce stifling regulation, monopolies, and oligopolies in various economic sectors. This strategy stressed Japan's long-term economic health over the short term problems of deflation and recession.

Such fragments are too long to be sequenced in a single sequence read using the chain termination method. This method works by dividing the long sequence into several consecutive short ones. The DNA of interest may be a plasmid insert, a PCR product or a fragment representing a gap when sequencing a genome. The term \\"primer walking\\" is used where the main aim is to sequence the genome. The term \\"chromosome walking\\" is used instead when the sequence is known but there is no clone of a gene. For example, the gene for a disease may be located near a specific marker such as an RFLP on the sequence. The fragment is first sequenced as if it were a shorter fragment. Sequencing is performed from each end using either universal primers or specifically designed ones. This should identify the first 1000 or so bases. In order to completely sequence the region of interest, design and synthesis of new primers (complementary to the final 20 bases of the known sequence) is necessary to obtain contiguous sequence information. Process The overall process is as follows: # A primer that matches the beginning of the DNA to sequence is used to synthesize a short DNA strand adjacent to the unknown sequence, starting with the primer (see PCR). # The new short DNA strand is sequenced using the chain termination method. # The end of the sequenced strand is used as a primer for the next part of the long DNA sequence, hence the term \\"walking\\". The method can be used to sequence entire chromosomes (hence \\"chromosome walking\\").

It is immediately northwest of London Heathrow Airport, which is in the same borough. It is the westernmost settlement in Greater London, close to the borders of Berkshire and Surrey. It was formerly part of Harmondsworth by tithes, land tax, vestry and still by Church of England parish. As it has never had a church it can also be considered a hamlet. It is in the historic county of Middlesex. Longford is 15.8 miles (25.4 km) west of Charing Cross and within the M25 motorway which marks its western boundary with Colnbrook, Berkshire. Etymology The name Longford derives from the two words \\"long\\" and \\"ford\\", after the wide ford across the Colne which is where the old Bath Road crosses it, a middle ditch, and the Wraysbury River, carrying on west from the village street. Its old country residents pronounced its name as \\"Long Ford\\" with both syllables stressed. History The settlement developed by this multi-channel ford of the River Colne and its distributaries, which presented numerous obstacles for travellers to and from the west of the edge of Middlesex, on the old Bath Road west out of London. Longford may be founded on a small Saxon settlement dating from the 5th to 7th century AD. Historic buildings survive from the medieval and immediate post-medieval periods. Limited evidence survives of Roman occupation, though archaeological excavations have revealed two brooches of Roman date. Longford, the only medieval settlement to grow up along the Bath Road in Middlesex, had 30 inhabited buildings in 1337. An important part of the parish economy, aside from its four manor houses, 48 houses were on Moor and Sheep Lanes in Harmondsworth. In 1586 land on either side of the river was charged with the upkeep of Mad Bridge, which carried the Bath Road across the river. During the 18th and early 19th centuries this bridge was maintained by the Colnbrook turnpike trustees, who presumably erected in 1834 the bridge with cast-iron parapets which now stands. Rocque's map of 1754, shows clearly the settlement pattern: at Longford, Harmondsworth, Sipson there were small compact groups of houses, and a straggling group at Heathrow. At Longford they lined both sides of the Bath Road from the east bank of the Longford River up to and across the Duke of Northumberland's River. The uncultivated area west of the rivers was to the north known as Harmondsworth moors, south of the Bath Road the area between the Colne and the Longford rivers was meadowland and, between the Longford and the Duke's rivers, arable. Parliament's Act of common land inclosure (privatisation) came to Harmondsworth parish in 1819; in it Harmondsworth's three open fields and Harmondsworth Moor and a big tract to and around Heathrow (part of Hounslow Heath) were divided among the local residents. During this Enclosure two bad bends of the Bath Road in Longford were straightened.The Villages of Harmondsworth, edited by Philip Sherwood, publ. West Middlesex Family History Society, 1993 By 1839 Longford and Harmondsworth and Sipson had a shop serving the whole parish. In 1929 the Longford and Colnbrook by-pass was built. In 1930 the Road Research Laboratory on the Colnbrook by-pass opened. In the same year the Fairey Aviation Company opened an airfield, the Great West Aerodrome, southeast of Heathrow village. About 1930 a brickworks was set up east of the junction of Cain's Lane and Heathrow Road in Heathrow. Later the quarry's main purpose changed to excavating sand and gravel. The quarry company went bankrupt in 1943; after 1944 the airport obliterated the quarry along with every trace of Heathrow village. Middlesex County Council opened a large sewage sludge settlement works west of Perry Oaks farm; in the 1990s it was removed and Heathrow Airport's Terminal 5 is there now. In 1648 the first bridge across the then- new Longford River was demolished. This had been replaced by 1675. In the 19th century, when it was called Stone Bridge, the Crown, not a local authority, was responsible for its upkeep and by 1960 it had been renamed King's Bridge. Geography Longford village is a linear development astride the Bath Road immediately north of Heathrow Airport and as such to the south of the M4, It is also immediately north of Heathrow's Western Perimeter Road. The area is characterized by an historic village core and similar-sized green buffer zones. The last bridge or ford in the west over the Wraysbury River marked the boundary of Colnbrook which has been superseded by the M25 motorway which the road then crosses over. The Duke of Northumberland's River that runs from here to Isleworth since its construction in or about 1543. Soil and elevation Elevation is an almost uniform . Longford's soil is the rich western soil of the historic parish of Harmondsworth, being alluvial. Shortly south of the main street gravel is instead close to the surface except near rivers and northeastward of the village, and less fertile clay soil dominates for many miles. Transport Immediately to the north is a purpose-built bypass with a western junction connected A4, to the M4 that is, which is parallel and has two junction with this road also directly north of Heathrow airport, with the newer Junction 14 for Terminal 5 a very limited access junction, for the airport roads only. Access to the M25 motorway is considerably shortest to the south, at Junction 14 (Stanwell Moor). The Bath Road (A4) is an arterial road and traffic along it became so dense so early that in 1928 a bypass to Longford and Colnbrook was opened. Landmarks Longford retains an old- fashioned community centre character, in particular a former and an existing public house which are listed buildings only at Grade II mostly on age rather than simply architecture.King Henry and Stables (opened before 1775, closed 20th century) White Horse -- 17th century, restored An old building, Yeomans, which has been subdivided into three flats is listed.Yeomans Other listed buildings include Longford Cottage, Queen River Cottage and adjoining Willow Tree Cottage,Queen River Cottage and Willow Tree Cottage and King's Bridge which is the name of the 1834-built main bridge by the very last building at the west end of the (old) Bath Road street, which crosses the nearby siphoned off Longford River, which Charles I had constructed -- this feeds Bushy Park and Hampton Court Gardens.King's Bridge One of the listed cottages is thatched.Image of the Thatched Cottage with modern houses behind at geograph.org.uk  Longford Village Conservation Area  Much of the land surrounding the village of Longford is within the Metropolitan Green Belt. Many of its buildings are included in the Longford Village Conservation Area, which was designated in 1988 with a minor boundary change in 1999. It includes seven listed buildings, one listed wall and a number of unlisted properties which are considered to make an important contribution to the character and appearance of the Conservation Area.

Once known as a religious and traditional town, the municipality of São Bento do Sapucaí, now with its population reaching 10,000 inhabitants, is known for its mild weather, beautiful landscapes, and great conditions for the practice of many action sports. History First settlings in that area were made by Bandeirantes that went up the Serra da Mantiqueira trying to reach the gold mining regions of Minas Gerais. The town was founded on August 6, 1832 and Saint Benedict was chosen as the patron saint. The name of the place comes from Saint Benedict in Portuguese) and the river Sapucaí, that crosses town. Around 1850, José Pereira Alves and his wife, Ignez Leite de Toledo donated a large area of land to the town, with the purpose of building a great church in honor of St. Benedict. The town's folk went in a religious procession to retrieve an image of the saint from the nearest chapel (which was almost in Sapucaí-Mirim, Minas Gerais), and then the \\"Igreja Matriz de São Bento\\" (St. Benedict's Matrix Church) started to be built by the slaves. Still today, you can find in there paintings of well-known artists that date back to 1853. Geography A View of São Bento do Sapucaí countryside from SP-042 highway. Located 164 km northeast of São Paulo, on a mountain chain called Serra da Mantiqueira, it has a total area of 251.2 km². The topography is very mountainous. There are many hills and waterfalls (the highest being Toldi Falls with more than 200 m). The city's average altitude is 886 meters, and the highest peak is a rock compound known as Pedra do Baú with an elevation of . The municipality contains 66% of the Sapucaí Mirim Environmental Protection Area, created in 1998.

In both groups, the claws are modified into tools for digging, and the body is a rounded shape that is easy to bury in sand. Unlike most other true crabs, the abdomens of raninids are not curled under the cephalothorax. The earliest fossil attributable to the family Raninidae dates from the Albian.

In December 2008, Nogaideli withdrew into opposition, setting up the Movement for a Fair Georgia party.Ex-PM Nogaideli Sets Up Party. \\"Civil Georgia\\". 3 December 2008 Early life and career Born in Kobuleti, Ajaria, Georgia, Nogaideli graduated from the Moscow State University with a diploma in Physics in 1988. Before entering into national politics, he worked for the Institute of Geography of the Georgian Academy of Sciences between 1988-1992. In 1989-1990, he was also trained at the Institute of Geology of the Academy of Sciences of Estonia. Parliament He started his political career together with his friend, Zurab Zhvania, in the Green Party of Georgia in early 1990s. Nogaideli became a deputy in the Parliament of Georgia in 1992, elected following the overthrow of President Zviad Gamsakhurdia, and chaired the Parliamentary Committee on Environment Protection and Natural Resources during 1992-1995. He was again member of the successor Parliaments in 1995-1999 and 1999–2000, when he chaired the Parliamentary Tax and Income Committee. Minister of Finance He joined the government of Eduard Shevardnadze in the capacity of Minister of Finance in May 2000. During these years, he was considered a member of a political team of young reformists headed by Zurab Zhvania and Mikheil Saakashvili and proved to be quite an effective minister. In 2001, he left the President-run Union of Citizens of Georgia party which he had joined in 1995. He was sacked, in 2002, without explanation, though it appears that he had intended to resign in protest against the policies of Shevardnadze's increasingly corrupted government (as the Minister of Justice Mikheil Saakashvili did a year before). In a brief period of 2002-2003, he was involved in banking and investment ventures. After Shevardnadze was ousted in the Rose Revolution of 21–23 November 2003, Nogaideli returned to government as the economic adviser to the acting president, Nino Burjanadze. He was re- appointed to his old post as Minister of Finance in February 2004 in the government of Prime Minister Zurab Zhvania. Prime minister President Mikhail Saakashvili nominated Nogaideli for the post of Prime Minister on 11 February 2005 following the untimely death of Zhvania. He was confirmed by the Georgian Parliament on 17 February 2005 by a vote of 175 to 24, and was sworn in immediately. Nogaideli is not a member of any party and is regarded as a technocrat with a tough approach to the corruption that plagues Georgia's economy. According to Financial weekly Georgian newspaper The World Bank Group and the U.S. Agency for International Development has honored Zurab Nogaideli, Prime Minister of Georgia, as top business environment reformer of the year 2007. The Prime Minister has led reforms which have catapulted Georgia from a ranking of 112 to 37th place in the World Bank Group's 2007 global rankings on the regulatory ease of doing business. Nogaideli is married with one son. Resignation Nogaideli announced his resignation on 16 November 2007 due to his poor health condition. In April 2007, Nogaideli underwent elective open- heart surgery at St. Luke's Episcopal Hospital in Houston, U.S.RFE/RL Newsline, 07-04-20. Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty. Accessed on 16 November 2007. The operation, led by leading US surgeon Dr. Charles Frazier, lasted for 8 hours and involved transplanting one mitral valve of the PM's heart. After his resignation, Nogaideli said he would retire from politics and later joined the Kala Capital company - owned by the soccer star Kakha Kaladze - as its chairman. Since June 2008, he has also been a chairman of the International School of Economics at Tbilisi State University Business Council.Zuran Nogaideli. The Kala Capital. Retrieved on 23 July 2008. Opposition After the Russian-Georgian war, in September 2008, Nogaideli appeared in the Georgian press, unleashing heavy criticism of foreign and domestic policies of Mikheil Saakashvili. On 3 December 2008, he set up a new opposition party, the Movement for Fair Georgia.

The popularity of sunless tanning has risen since the 1960s after health authorities confirmed links between UV exposure (from sunlight or tanning beds) and the incidence of skin cancer. The chemical compound Dihydroxyacetone (DHA) is used in sunless tanning products in concentrations of 3%-5%. Zoe Kececioglu Draelos. (2019). Cosmetics and dermatologic problems and solutions. Boca Raton: Crc Press. DHA concentration is adjusted to provide darker and lighter shades of tan. The reaction of keratin protein present in skin and DHA is responsible for the production of pigmentation. James Rippe. (2013). Lifestyle Medicine, Second Edition. Editorial: Crc Press. Since sunscreen absorbs ultraviolet light and prevents it from reaching the skin, it will prevent tanning. It has been reported that sunscreen with a sun protection factor (SPF) of 8 based on the UVB spectrum can decrease vitamin D synthetic capacity by 95 percent, whereas sunscreen with an SPF of 15 can reduce synthetic capacity by 98 percent.  Carotenoids  A safe and effective method of sunless tanning is consumption of certain carotenoids — antioxidants found in some fruits and vegetables such as carrots and tomatoes — which can result in changes to skin color when ingested chronically and/or in high amounts. Carotenoids are long-lasting. In addition, carotenoids have been linked to more attractive skin tone (defined as a more golden skin color) than suntan. Carotenes also fulfil the function of melanin in absorbing the UV radiation and protecting the skin. For example, they are concentrated in the macula of the eye to protect the retina from damage. They are used in plants both to protect chlorophyll from light damage and harvest light directly. Carotenaemia (xanthaemia) is the presence in blood of the yellow pigment carotene from excessive intake of carrots or other vegetables containing the pigment resulting in increased serum carotenoids. It can lead to subsequent yellow-orange discoloration (xanthoderma or carotenoderma) and their subsequent deposition in the outermost layer of skin. Carotenemia and carotenoderma is in itself harmless, and does not require treatment. In primary carotenoderma, when the use of high quantities of carotene is discontinued the skin color will return to normal. It may take up to several months, however, for this to happen. Lycopene Lycopene is a key intermediate in the biosynthesis of beta-carotene and xanthophylls. Lycopene may be the most powerful carotenoid quencher of singlet oxygen. Due to its strong color and non-toxicity, lycopene is a useful food coloring (registered as E160d) and is approved for usage in the US, Australia and New Zealand (registered as 160d)Australia New Zealand Food Standards Code and the EU.UK Food Standards Agency: Beta-carotene Sunless-tanning pills often contain β-carotene. The American Cancer Society states that \\"Although the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved some of these additives for coloring food, they are not approved for use in tanning agents.\\" Also that \\"They may be harmful at the high levels that are used in tanning pills.\\". Chronic, high doses of synthetic β-carotene supplements have been associated with increased rate of lung cancer among those who smoke. Canthaxanthin Canthaxanthin is most commonly used as a color additive in certain foods. Although the FDA has approved the use of canthaxanthin in food, it does not approve its use as a tanning agent. When used as a color additive, only very small amounts of canthaxanthin are necessary. As a tanning agent, however, much larger quantities are used. After canthaxanthin is consumed, it is deposited throughout the body, including in the layer of fat below the skin, which turns an orange-brown color. These types of tanning pills have been linked to various side effects, including hepatitis and canthaxanthin retinopathy, a condition in which yellow deposits form in the retina of the eye. Other side effects including damage to the digestive system and skin surface have also been noted. The FDA withdrew approval for use of canthaxanthin as a tanning agent, and has issued warnings concerning its use. Other agents=DHA-based products DHA (Dihydroxyacetone, also known as glycerone) is not a dye, stain or paint, but causes a chemical reaction with the amino acids in the dead layer on the skin surface. One of the pathways is a free radical-mediated Maillard reaction. The other pathway is the conventional Maillard reaction, a process well known to food chemists that causes the browning that occurs during food manufacturing and storage. It does not involve the underlying skin pigmentation nor does it require exposure to ultraviolet light to initiate the color change. However, for the 24 hours after self-tanner is applied, the skin is especially susceptible to ultraviolet, according to a 2007 study led by Katinka Jung of the Gematria Test Lab in Berlin. Forty minutes after the researchers treated skin samples with high levels of DHA they found that more than 180 percent additional free radicals formed during sun exposure compared with untreated skin. Another self-tanner ingredient, erythrulose, produced a similar response at high levels. For a day after self-tanner application, excessive sun exposure should be avoided and sunscreen should be worn outdoors, they say; an antioxidant cream could also minimize free radical production. Although some self-tanners contain sunscreen, its effect will not last long after application, and a fake tan itself will not protect the skin from UV exposure. The study by Jung et al. further confirms earlier results demonstrating that dihydroxyacetone in combination with dimethylisosorbide enhances the process of (sun-based) tanning. This earlier study also found that dihydroxyacetone also has an effect on the amino acids and nucleic acids which is bad for the skin. The free radicals are due to the action of UV light on AGE (advanced glycation end-products) as a result of the reaction of DHA with the skin, and the intermediates, such as Amadori products (a type of AGE), that lead to them. AGEs are behind the damage to the skin that occurs with high blood sugar in diabetes where similar glycation occurs. AGEs absorb and provide a little protection against some of the damaging factors of UV (up to SPF 3), However, they do not have melanin's extended electronic structure that dissipates the energy, so part of it goes towards starting free radical chain reactions instead, in which other AGEs participate readily. Overall tanner enhances free radical injury. Although some self-tanners contain sunscreen, its effect will not last as long as the tan. The stated SPF is only applicable for a few hours after application. Despite darkening of the skin, an individual is still susceptible to UV rays, therefore an overall sun protection is still very necessary. There may also be some inhibition of vitamin D production in DHA- treated skin. The color effect is temporary and fades gradually over 3 to 10 days. Some of these products also use erythrulose which works identically to DHA, but develops more slowly. Both DHA and erythrulose have been known to cause contact dermatitis. Professional spray tan applications are available from spas, salons and gymnasiums by both hand-held sprayers and in the form of sunless or UV-Free spray booths. Spray tan applications are also available through online retail distribution channels and are widely available to purchase for in home use.FDA Comments on Sunless Tanners and Bronzers The enclosed booth, which resembles an enclosed shower stall, sprays the tanning solution over the entire body. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) states when using DHA-containing products as an all-over spray or mist in a commercial spray \\"tanning\\" booth, it may be difficult to avoid exposure in a manner for which DHA is not approved, including the area of the eyes, lips, or mucous membrane, or even internally. DHA is not approved by the FDA for inhalation. An opinionhttp://ec.europa.eu/health/scientific_committees/consumer_safety/docs/sccs_o_048.pdf issued by the European Commission's Scientific Committee on Consumer Safety, concluding spray tanning with DHA did not pose risk, has been heavily criticized by specialists. This is because the cosmetics industry in Europe chose the evidence to review, according to the commission itself. Thus, nearly every report the commission's eventual opinion referenced came from studies that were never published or peer-reviewed and, in the majority of cases, were performed by companies or industry groups linked to the manufacturing of DHA. The industry left out nearly all of the peer-reviewed studies published in publicly available scientific journals that identified DHA as a potential mutagen. A study by scientists from the Department of Dermatology, Bispebjerg Hospital, published in Mutation Research has concluded DHA 'induces DNA damage, cell-cycle block and apoptosis' in cultured cells.  SIK-inhibitors  A novel class of compounds has been found to stimulate melanogenesis in a mechanism that is independent from α-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (α-MSH) activation of the melanocortin 1 receptor (MC1 receptor). This is accomplished via small molecule inhibition of salt-inducible kinases (SIK). Inhibition of SIK increases transcription of MITF which is known to increase melanin production. Work published in June 2017 has demonstrated compounds that have efficacy when applied topically to human skin. These compounds are still however in pre-clinical stages of development. Future directions may include the incorporation of SIK-inhibitor compounds with traditional UV-blocking sunscreens to minimize UV-related DNA damage in the short term while providing longer term protection through endogenous melanin production.  Tyrosine- based products  Tanning accelerators—lotions or pillsUS FDA/CFSAN - Tanning Pills that usually contain the amino acid tyrosine—claim that they stimulate and increase melanin formation, thereby accelerating the tanning process. These are used in conjunction with UV exposure. At this time, there is no scientific data available to support these claims. Melanotan peptide hormones The role of alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (α-MSH) in promoting melanin diffusion has been known since the 1960s. In the 1980s, scientists at University of Arizona began attempting to develop α-MSH and analogs as potential sunless tanning agents, and synthesized and tested several analogs, including afamelanotide, then called melanotan-I. To pursue the tanning agent, melanotan-I was licensed by Competitive Technologies, a technology transfer company operating on behalf of University of Arizona, to an Australian startup called Epitan, which changed its name to Clinuvel in 2006. A number of products are sold online and in gyms and beauty salons as \\"melanotan\\" or \\"melanotan-1\\" which discuss afamelanotide in their marketing. The products are not legal in any jurisdiction and are dangerous. Starting in 2007 health agencies in various counties began issuing warnings against their use. Other melanogenesis stimulants Eicosanoids, retinoids, oestrogens, melanocyte-stimulating hormone, endothelins, psoralens, hydantoin, forskolin, cholera toxin, isobutylmethylxanthine, diacylglycerol analogues, and UV irradiation all trigger melanogenesis and, in turn, pigmentation. Temporary bronzers Bronzers are a temporary sunless tanning or bronzing option. These come in powders, sprays, mousse, gels, lotions and moisturizers. Once applied, they create a tan that can easily be removed with soap and water. Like make- up, these products tint or stain a person's skin only until they are washed off. They are often used for \\"one-day\\" only tans, or to complement a DHA-based sunless tan. Many formulations are available, and some have limited sweat or light water resistance. If applied under clothing, or where fabric and skin edges meet, most will create some light but visible rub-off. Dark clothing prevents the rub-off from being noticeable. While these products are much safer than tanning beds, the color produced can sometimes look orangey and splotchy if applied incorrectly. A recent trend is that of lotions or moisturizers containing a gradual tanning agent. A slight increase in color is usually observable after the first use, but color will continue to darken the more the product is used. Air brush tanning is a spray on tan performed by a professional. An air brush tan can last five to ten days and will fade when the skin is washed. It is used for special occasions or to get a quick dark tan. At-home airbrush tanning kits and aerosol mists are also available. Risks Tanners usually contain a sunscreen. However, when avobenzone is irradiated with UVA light, it generates a triplet excited state in the keto form which can either cause the avobenzone to degrade or transfer energy to biological targets and cause deleterious effects. It has been shown to degrade significantly in light, resulting in less protection over time.File:Free text.png The UV-A light in a day of sunlight in a temperate climate is sufficient to break down most of the compound. It's important to continue wearing SPF while self-tanning, as self-tanner is generally a fake and temporary tan, and your skin is still sensitive to the sun. If avobenzone- containing sunscreen is applied on top of tanner, the photosensitizer effect magnifies the free-radical damage promoted by DHA, as DHA may make the skin especially susceptible to free-radical damage from sunlight, according to a 2007 study led by Katinka Jung of the Gematria Test Lab in Berlin. Forty minutes after the researchers treated skin samples with 20% DHA they found that more than 180 percent additional free radicals formed during sun exposure compared with untreated skin. A toxicologist and lung specialist at the University of Pennsylvania's Perelman School of Medicine (Dr. Rey Panettieri) has commented, \\"The reason I'm concerned is the deposition of the tanning agents into the lungs could really facilitate or aid systemic absorption -- that is, getting into the bloodstream. These compounds in some cells could actually promote the development of cancers or malignancies, and if that's the case then we need to be wary of them.\\" A study by scientists from the Department of Dermatology, Bispebjerg Hospital, published in Mutation Research has concluded DHA 'induces DNA damage, cell-cycle block and apoptosis' in cultured cells. Many self tanners use chemical fragrances which may cause skin allergies or may trigger asthma. Furthermore, some of them contain parabens. Parabens are preservatives that can affect the endocrine system.

Early life Raphael von Koeber was born in Nizhny Novgorod, Russian Empire, his father (a doctor) was ethnic German, his mother was ethnic Russian, she died when he was one year old, and he was raised by his grandmother, a daughter of a priest and tutor to Tsar Alexander II’s wife. She taught young Raphael the piano at the age of 6, and greatly influenced him in his habits and studies. As an ethnic German, he was uncomfortable at school, which he therefore attended only irregularly. At the age of 19, he entered a music school in Moscow over the opposition of his father, where he was befriended by Tchaikovsky and Rubinstein. He graduated at age 24, but decided not to pursue a career as a musician due to his shyness, and instead went to Jena in Germany, where he studied natural history, and later philosophy at the University of Jena with Rudolf Christoph Eucken. After receiving his doctorate at the age of 30, he held teaching posts in University of Berlin, University of Heidelberg and University of Munich, mostly teaching music history and music aesthetics. Life in Japan Koeber came to teach in Japan in June 1893, based on the recommendations of his friend Karl Robert Eduard von Hartmann, who overcame his worries about the long sea voyage, earthquakes and having enough English language ability to lecture. He was 45 years old. He studied and worked for 21 years at the Tokyo Imperial University from 1893 to 1914 teaching philosophy, in particular, Greek philosophy, Medieval philosophy and Aesthetics. Koeber was known to be somewhat eccentric, and had fixed habits of reading, lecturing and playing the piano per a strict schedule. He rarely visited anywhere in Japan outside of Tokyo; he traveled to nearby Kamakura and once to Enoshima. He was indifferent about money and clothes, and wore the same winter clothes for 17 years. He had many students, among them were the famous writer Natsume Sōseki and the philosophers Nishida Kitaro and Watsuji Tetsuro. Koeber also taught piano at the Tokyo National Music School, which has now become a part of Tokyo National University of Fine Arts and Music. In 1901, he wrote the music for the opening of Japan Women's University. In 1903, Raphael also provided piano accompaniment for the first opera performed in Japan. When the Russo-Japanese War broke out in 1904, Koeber refused to return to his country and the Japanese government did not make a political issue about his desire to remain in Japan. In 1912, Koeber's domestic servant from Munich committed suicide and Koeber was shocked by the incident. In the summer of that year, Natsume Sōseki called on Koeber, and later wrote about Koeber \\"a professor of noblest character\\" in his book Teacher Koeber (In Japanese: Koeber Sensei). He retired from his teaching position in 1914 and decided to return to Munich. However, immediately before getting aboard the ship at Yokohama, World War I began. Unable to travel and with no place to stay, he lived out of a room at the Russian Consulate in Yokohama for nine years until his death in 1923. His grave is at the Zōshigaya cemetery in Tokyo. His collection of books, numbering 1,999 volumes and mainly consisting of Greek and Latin classics, and works on philosophy and literature is now at the Tohoku University Library.

It was once a major port of the region and summer retreat for Maharao (king) of the Cutch State. The old city was enclosed in the fort wall and remains of the fort wall can still be seen. The city has a four-hundred- year-old ship building industry. Which is still functional and ships of woodens are made( Dhow) Fortress The Fortress of Mandvi was built by Raoshri Bharmalji in 1549. It was eight km long, 2.7 metres broad and three metres high with five gates, three windows and seven bastions (kotha). In 1978, Mandvi municipality was handed over the fort under condition that it will preserve the fortress. Later in 1992, the municipality decided to demolish 290 metres of wall to free the land but was opposed by citizens. The appeal was rejected in 1993 and the 300-metre-long wall of west side was demolished in 1993. In 1999, the state archeological department considered it for declaring protected monument but later decided against it. After assessing condition of fort, the court rejected appeals against demolition in 2001. The fort wall was demolished in two phases except four gates and six bastions which were preserved as protected monuments. Geography Mandvi is a port city located at where the Rukmavati River meets the Gulf of Kutch. It is about 56 km south of the regional capital, Bhuj. It is approximately 446 km from the major megacity of Ahmedabad. Because Mandvi has no rail transport, the nearest public airport and train station is Bhuj. Climate The climate here is tropical. The summers are much rainier than the winters in Mandvi. According to Köppen and Geiger, this climate is classified as Aw. The average temperature in Mandvi is 27.4 °C. In a year, the average rainfall is 1539 mm. History Mandvi was founded by the Rao of kutch State, Khengarji I in 1580. Ruins of fort wall and gate near Brahmapuri area Mandvi Bridge over Rukmavati * The city Mandvi was named after Sage Mandavya (Mahabharata story), who lived here. He was also known as AM BABA. *When Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered Europe-to-India sea route in 1497, he had a Gujarati by his side to show him the way. A Kutchi sailor, Kanji Malam, navigated the commander to Calicut from Malindi on east African coast. Malam hailed from Mandvi, a shipbuilding hub.Historians have differed over the identity of the sailor, calling him a Christian and a Gujarati. German author Justus says it was Malam (Kharva) and he was a Hindu Gujarati who accompanied Vasco. Italian researcher Sinthia Salvadori too has concluded that it was Malam who showed Gama the way to India. Salvadori has made this observation in her 'We Came in Dhows', an account written after interacting with people in Gujarat. \\"Malam's role in the Vasco expedition has largely been overlooked by historians. * As per chronicles of Kutch Gurjar Kshatriyas – many clans of their community, especially, Gohil, Bhatti, Jethwa, Solanki, Rathod clans & also Visavaria Brahmins shifted to Mandvi in between 15th to 16th century AD, from Dhaneti.Kadia Kshatriya Itihas by Nutan Prakashan: 1897 * The establishment of the town dates back to the late 16th century (1581 AD) and is attributed to the first Jadeja ruler of Kutch, Rao Khengarji I. * In the 18th century, the Mandvi merchants collectively owned a fleet of 400 vessels trading with East Africa, Malabar coast and the Persian Gulf. In the early 19th century, it was a major port of entry for the inland trade with Malwa, Marwar and Sindh. * Mandvi was at the junction of two trade routes the maritime spice trade-route and the desert camel caravan route, acting as an important trade center. * Mandvi was originally a fortified town having a fort wall of about 8 m high and 1.2 m wide stone masonry. The fort had several gateways and 25 bastions; but at present, most of the wall has disappeared. The bastion on the southwest is largest and acts as a lighthouse. * In the heyday of maritime trade, before the arrival of steamboats, Mandvi was a rich and prosperous town, earning four times more revenue from export than import. It was a profit-making center of the Kutch state, surpassing the capital city of Bhuj in terms of wealth. Dr. Manubhai Pandhi, a local social leader, recorded shipbuilding art and collected old documents which is treasured now in Prince of Wales Museum (www.bombaymuseum.org ) in Mumbai. * As most of the top ports of India were controlled by Europeans, especially the Portuguese, even the Mughals held the Maharaos of Kachchh in high esteem, as they needed the port of Mandvi for exports, imports and also for pilgrimages to Mecca. *In decade of 1960, the Dabeli is said to have been invented here by Keshavji Gabha Chudasama (Malam)(Kharva). Demographics Mandvi houses a population of about 51,000 people, mainly Brahmin, Brahmkshatriya, Bhatalas, Kharvas, Lohanas, Maheshwari, Dawoodi Bohra, Muslims and Jains, Kandoi, Patidar, Mistris. Mandvi is a unique town which captures the true Gujarat, Kutchi culture. Mandvi also incorporates the neighboring villages of Nagalpur and Moti Rayan. Mandvi is a town of merchants and seamen, both mutually benefiting from each other. Mandvi had the Lal Bungalow / Arihant Bungalow Built by Khengarji III. It took 16 years to build this palace. with unique architecture and a lavishing of 55 Rooms and 5 Floors with all Teak Wood Ceilings. Lal Bungalow was Heritage Site and currently owned by Sanket Shah. It is demolished in 2011–2012. Now there is a new built shopping and residential complex. Mandvi was one of the towns deeply impacted by the 2001 Gujarat earthquake. Noted social worker Dr. Chhotalal J. Mehta (1911–1982) and his brother Dr. Prabhudas J. Mehta (1925–1959) started first free TB hospital in 1950 in the district if Kutch, and school for deaf and mute children and 1000th Rotary club in the world.

The town had a population of 19,033 as of 31 December 2019. History The first mention of \\"Wolveradeshusun\\" appears in documents from the year 1003. About 100 years later, Otto II, the Graf of Deißen-Andechs, built a castle on a hill overlooking the valley. The castle was destroyed on 7 April 1734 when lightning struck the tower storing black powder. Stones from the ruins were transported to Munich where they were used to build the Residenz. From 1280 the town was designated a market town. In the 15th century, people were using the Loisach and Isar rivers for water transport, especially logging. Even today, you can ride a raft from Wolfratshausen into Munich. During World War II, a forced-labor subcamp of Dachau concentration camp named Föhrenwald was located between Wolfratshausen and Geretsried. Following the war, the labor camp was used as a displaced persons camp by the Allies. In 1957, Föhrenwald was transformed into a suburb of Wolfratshausen and renamed Waldram, to honor the Lord of Münsing who was one of the founders of the Benediktbeuern Abbey.Waldram In modern times, Wolfratshausen was formerly the seat of the district government, but this moved to Bad Tölz in 1972. Geography Wolfratshausen sits at the confluence of the Isar and Loisach Rivers, at approx. 30 km (19 mls.) southwest of Munich. A canal joins the two rivers to return water diverted for power generation at the Isar Amper Werke to the Isar. The town covers 9.13 square kilometres and is 577 meters above sea level. Town subdivisions The town of Wolfratshausen is split into the following subdivisions: * Altstadt * Weidach * Nantwein * Farchet * Waldram Notable residents Former Bavarian Prime Minister Edmund Stoiber lives in Wolfratshausen.

This was first introduced by Burnaby Munson and Frank H. Field in 1966. This technique is a branch of gaseous ion-molecule chemistry. Reagent gas molecules are ionized by electron ionization, which subsequently react with analyte molecules in the gas phase in order to achieve ionization. Negative chemical ionization (NCI), charge-exchange chemical ionization and atmospheric-pressure chemical ionization (APCI) are some of the common variations of this technique. CI has several important applications in identification, structure elucidation and quantitation of organic compounds. Beside the applications in analytical chemistry, the usefulness in chemical ionization extends toward biochemical, biological and medicinal fields as well. Principles of operation Chemical ionization requires a lower amount of energy compared to electron ionization (EI), but this depends on the reactant material used. This low-energy ionization mechanism yields less or sometimes no fragmentation, and usually a simpler spectrum. The lack of fragmentation limits the amount of structural information that can be determined about the ionized species. However, a typical CI spectrum has an easily identifiable protonated molecular ion peak [M+1]+, which allows easy determination of molecular mass. This technique requires the transfer of high-mass entities from the reagent gas to the analyte, and therefore, the Franck-Condon principle does not govern the process of ionization. CI is thus quite useful in cases where the energy of the bombarding electrons in EI is high, resulting exclusively in fragmentation of the analyte, causing the molecular-ion peak to be less detectable or completely absent.  Instrumentation  CI uses a common source for ionization as EI, with some modifications. To facilitate the reactions between the ions-gases, the chamber is kept gastight with a pressure around 1 torr. Electrons are produced through a metal filament, which is made of tungsten, rhenium, or iridium and travel to a longer distance in the ionization chamber, due to high energy it owns. In contrast to EI, the magnet and the electron trap is not needed for CI, since the electron beam do not travel to the end of the chamber. The pressure inside the chamber is kept below 10−4 torr. Mechanism A CI experiment involves the use of gas phase acid-base reactions in the chamber. Ions are produced through the collision of the analyte with ions of a reagent gas that are present in the ion source. Some common reagent gases include: methane, ammonia, water and isobutane. Inside the ion source, the reagent gas is present in large excess compared to the analyte. Electrons entering the source with energy around 200-500 eV will preferentially ionize the reagent gas. Then, the ion/molecule reactions produces more stable reagent ions and the resultant collisions with other reagent gas molecules will create an ionization plasma. Positive and negative ions of the analyte are formed by reactions with this plasma. The following reactions are possible with methane as the reagent gas.  Primary ion formation  :CH4{} + e^- -> CH4^{+\\\\bullet}{} + 2e^-  Secondary reagent ions  :CH4{} + CH4^{+\\\\bullet} -> CH5+{} + CH3^{\\\\bullet} :CH4 + CH3^+ -> C2H5+ + H2  Product ion formation  :M + CH5+ -> CH4 + [M + H]+ (protonation) :AH + CH3+ -> CH4 + A+ (H^- abstraction) :M + C2H5+ -> [M + C2H5]+ (adduct formation) :A + CH4+ -> CH4 + A+ (charge exchange) If ammonia is the reagent gas, :NH3{} + e^- -> NH3^{+\\\\bullet}{} + 2e^- :NH3{} + NH3^{+\\\\bullet} -> NH4+{} + NH2 :M + NH4^+ -> MH+ + NH3 For isobutane as the reagent gas, :\\\\ce{C4H10{} + e^- -> C4H10^{+\\\\bullet}{} + 2e^-} (\\\\ce{ + C3H7+} \\\\text{and other ions}) :C3H7^+{} + C4H10^{+\\\\bullet} -> C4H9^+{} + C3H8 :M + C4H9^+ -> MH^+ + C4H8 Self chemical ionization is possible if the reagent ion is an ionized form of the analyte. Advantages and limitations The high energy molecular ions produced by the bombardment with electrons pass their energy to neutral molecules via collision. This allows the analytes to be less fragmented and therefore molecular weight of an unknown analyte can be determined. The extent of fragmentation is controlled by proper selection of reagent gases. The spectra given by CI is simpler and more sensitive compared to other ionization methods. Moreover, some variations of CI can be coupled to chromatographic separation techniques, thereby improving its usefulness in identification of compounds. However, this method is restricted to volatile compounds and due to less fragmentation, lesser amount of information can be obtained.  Applications  Peroxynitrate chemical ionization mass spectrometer at the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration CI mass spectrometry is a useful tool in structure elucidation of organic compounds. This is possible with CI, because formation of [M+1]+ eliminates a stable molecule, which can be used to guess the functional groups present. Besides that, CI facilitates the ability to detect the molecular ion peak, due to less extensive fragmentation. Chemical ionization can also be used to identify and quantify an analyte present in a sample, by coupling chromatographic separation techniques to CI such as gas chromatography (GC), high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and capillary electrophoresis (CE). This allows selective ionization of an analyte from a mixture of compounds, where accurate and precised results can be obtained. Variants=Negative chemical ionization Chemical ionization for gas phase analysis is either positive or negative. Almost all neutral analytes can form positive ions through the reactions described above. In order to see a response by negative chemical ionization (NCI, also NICI), the analyte must be capable of producing a negative ion (stabilize a negative charge) for example by electron capture ionization. Because not all analytes can do this, using NCI provides a certain degree of selectivity that is not available with other, more universal ionization techniques (EI, PCI). NCI can be used for the analysis of compounds containing acidic groups or electronegative elements (especially halogens).Moreover, negative chemical ionization is more selective and demonstrates a higher sensitivity toward oxidizing agents and alkylating agents. Because of the high electronegativity of halogen atoms, NCI is a common choice for their analysis. This includes many groups of compounds, such as PCBs, pesticides, and fire retardants. Most of these compounds are environmental contaminants, thus much of the NCI analysis that takes place is done under the auspices of environmental analysis. In cases where very low limits of detection are needed, environmental toxic substances such as halogenated species, oxidizing and alkylating agents are frequently analyzed using an electron capture detector coupled to a gas chromatograph. Negative ions are formed by resonance capture of a near-thermal energy electron, dissociative capture of a low energy electron and via ion-molecular interactions such as proton transfer, charge transfer and hydride transfer. Compared to the other methods involving negative ion techniques, NCI is quite advantageous, as the reactivity of anions can be monitored in the absence of a solvent. Electron affinities and energies of low-lying valencies can be determined by this technique as well. Charge-exchange chemical ionization This is also similar to CI and the difference lies in the production of a radical cation with an odd number of electrons. The reagent gas molecules are bombarded with high energy electrons and the product reagent gas ions abstract electrons from the analyte to form radical cations. The common reagent gases used for this technique are toluene, benzene, NO, Xe, Ar and He. Careful control over the selection of reagent gases and the consideration toward the difference between the resonance energy of the reagent gas radical cation and the ionization energy of the analyte can be used to control fragmentation. The reactions for charge-exchange chemical ionization are as follows. : He{} + e^- -> He^{+\\\\bullet}{} + 2e^- : He^{+\\\\bullet}{} + M -> M^{+\\\\bullet} Atmospheric pressure chemical ionization source Atmospheric-pressure chemical ionization Chemical ionization in an atmospheric pressure electric discharge is called atmospheric pressure chemical ionization (APCI), which usually uses water as the reagent gas. An APCI source is composed of a Liquid Chromatography outlet, nebulizing the eluent, a heated vaporizer tube, a corona discharge needle and a pinhole entrance to 10−3 torr vacuum. The analyte is a gas or liquid spray and ionization is accomplished using an atmospheric pressure corona discharge. This ionization method is often coupled with high performance liquid chromatography where the mobile phase containing eluting analyte sprayed with high flow rates of nitrogen or helium and the aerosol spray is subjected to a corona discharge to create ions. It is applicable to relatively less polar and thermally less stable compounds. The difference between APCI and CI is that APCI functions under atmospheric pressure, where the frequency of collisions is higher. This enables the improvement in sensitivity and ionization efficiency.

It typically has vacancies on the vertical axis and unemployment on the horizontal. The curve, named after William Beveridge, is hyperbolic- shaped and slopes downward, as a higher rate of unemployment normally occurs with a lower rate of vacancies. If it moves outward over time, a given level of vacancies would be associated with higher and higher levels of unemployment, which would imply decreasing efficiency in the labour market. Inefficient labour markets are caused by mismatches between available jobs and the unemployed and an immobile labour force. The position on the curve can indicate the current state of the economy in the business cycle. For example, recessionary periods are indicated by high unemployment and low vacancies, corresponding to a position on the lower side of the 45° line, and high vacancies and low unemployment indicate the expansionary periods on the upper side of the 45° line. History The Beveridge curve, or UV curve, was developed in 1958 by Christopher Dow and Leslie Arthur Dicks-Mireaux. They were interested in measuring excess demand in the goods market for the guidance of Keynesian fiscal policies and took British data on vacancies and unemployment in the labour market as a proxy, since excess demand is unobservable. By 1958, they had 12 years of data available since the British government had started collecting data on unfilled vacancies from notification at labour exchanges in 1946. Dow and Dicks-Mireaux presented the unemployment and vacancy data in an unemployment-vacancy (UV) space and derived an idealised UV-curve as a rectangular hyperbola after they had connected successive observations. The UV curve, or Beveridge curve, enabled economists to use an analytical method, later known as UV-analysis, to decompose unemployment into different types of unemployment: deficient-demand (or cyclical) unemployment and structural unemployment. In the first half of the 1970s, that method was refined by economists of the National Institute of Economic and Social Research (NIESR), in London, so that a classification arose that corresponded to the 'traditional' classification: a division of unemployment into frictional, structural and deficient demand unemployment. Both the Beveridge curve and the Phillips curve bear implicit macroeconomic notions of equilibrium in markets, but the notions are inconsistent and conflicting. Most likely, because the curve enabled economists to analyze many of the problems that Beveridge had addressed, like mismatch between unemployment and vacancies, at aggregate level and industry levels and trend v. cyclical changes and measurement problems of vacancies, the curve was named in the 1980s after William Beveridge, who never drew the curve, and the exact origin of the name remains obscure. Movements The Beveridge Curve can move for the following reasons: * The matching process will determine how efficiently workers find new jobs. Improvements in the matching system would shift the curve towards the origin, because an efficient matching process will find jobs faster, filling vacancies and employing the unemployed. Improvements can be the introduction of agencies (‘job centres’), lower rates of unionisation, and increasing the mobility of labour. *Skills mismatches occur when changes in the skills employers want differ from the available skills in the labour pool. Greater mismatches would shift the Beveridge curve outward. If that were the driving factor behind the shift, one would expect to also see employers bid up wages for the few candidates who were desirable. Although the US Beveridge curve shifted outward in the 2010–2012 period, wages did not increase. * Labour force participation rate: as the number looking for jobs increases relative to total population, the unemployment rate increases, shifting the curve outwards from the origin. Labour force participation can increase due to changes in education, gender roles, population age and immigration. * Long-term unemployment will push the curve outward from the origin, which could be caused by deterioration of human capital or a negative perception of the unemployed by the potential employers. *Frictional unemployment: a decrease in frictions would reduce the number of firms searching for employees and the number of unemployed searching for jobs. That would shift the curve towards the origin. Frictional unemployment is caused by job losses, resignations and job creation. *Economic and policy uncertainty may cause employers to hold vacancies open longer in the search for the \\"perfect candidate\\", particularly when there is high unemployment with a large number of candidates from which to choose. More uncertainty would tend to shift the curve outward. Skill shortages should not be confused with \\"labour shortages\\", which identify an objective lack of workers in the market, independently of their skills, and it may arise because of limited geographical mobility, ageing populations or a labour market approaching full employment during an economic boom. Along with labour surpluses, labour shortages are one of the most traditional examples of labour market imbalances. What distinguishes an objective shortage of labour from a skill- related shortage (i.e. a special case of skill mismatch) is just the presence of a pool of unemployed individuals (non-discouraged job seekers) willing to take up jobs in the labour market considered at the ongoing rate. Nevertheless, even in presence of unemployment and assuming that there is an adequate demand for labour in the market, it could still be difficult to point to a skill shortage for at least two reasons: if whether the unemployment we observe is frictional (just a short-term consequence of costly \\"search\\"), cyclical (caused by the business cycle) or structural cannot be established or if whether the position offered is accessible and/or attractive (such as whether or not the wage posted is competitive or at least rising with respect to other segments of the market that are not reporting unmet labour demands) cannot be established. In addition, skill shortages may be caused by both \\"horizontal\\" skill mismatch, when workers have qualifications/skills which are different than the one required by the firms, or by \\"vertical\\" skill mismatch, when workers' skills and qualifications are lower level than what firms require. In the literature, scholars have also referred to skill mismatch and sometimes even to skill shortages to define a situation of the skills of the employed workers and those required by being jobs were different. To avoid any possible confusion, that form of mismatch affecting only employed individuals will be referred as \\"on-the-job\\" mismatch, in the more general case of workers being both over and under skilled for their jobs (vertical on-the-job mismatch) or have different skills/qualifications (horizontal on-the-job mismatch) and as skill gap to refer to employed workers whose skills are lower than those required by their jobs. It follows that skill mismatch, as it is defined here, can result in the occurrence of both skill shortages and on-the- job mismatches (both vertical and horizontal). Economists generally believe that labour markets adjust to such imbalances, especially over time, but it is also possible for such mismatches to persist for many years or decades. In such instances, adverse equilibria, characterized by more structural unemployment, long-term unfilled vacancies and/or lower labour force participation may arise, and employers may eventually be forced to hire workers who possess lower or just different skills, giving place to the mismatch \\"on the job\\". Public policy interventions to change or improve the match of workers to employers might be appropriate in such cases.

Unlike many of the civil parishes of Lisbon, this region can be commonly explained as a loose association of neighbourhoods, with no formal local political authority but social and historical significance to the urban community of Lisbon and of Portugal as a whole. The bairro or \\"neighbourhood\\" resulted from urban expansion in the 16th century, forming outside the walls of the historical city, and is characterized by an almost orthogonal tract (developing from two phases of distinct urbanization). It is a fundamental quarter of Lisbon, organized into a hierarchical scheme of roads and lanes: the roads, the structural axis, run perpendicular to the river; and the lanes, or secondary axis, cut parallel to the river. The matrix of allotments reflects the persistent use of the medieval layout; the division and multiplication of this module had its origin in the variations of the architectural typology. The space constructed is dominated by living spaces implanted in long narrow lots, three to four storeys in height, with asymmetric facades consisting of windows along the various storeys and staircases along the lateral flanks. Although less representative, the Pombaline-era buildings are common, essentially introducing modifications to the level of the façade's composition. Although there are many typological variations to the facade designs, certain elements are repeated, such as the corners, bay and sill windows, eaves and attics, securing a homogeneous urbanized front. History Detail from one of the entrances in the Bairro Alto The sloping roadway of the Bairro, near the edge of the old medieval walled city The romanticism of the Bairro, with a mixture of 19th century elements Leading to another intersection in the Bairro of three to four-storey dwellings The Bairro Alto was born as a response to the social and economic transformation in Lisbon in the second half of the 15th century. Commercial development caused the growth in the population, and an associated expansion of construction within the medieval walled city. It was this phenomenon that resulted in the urbanization process of the Bairro Alto district, in two distinct phases. The first phase began in 1487, after the death of Guedelha Palaçano, an influential figure in the kingdom: his widow transferred lands situated on the western limit of the city to the King's equerry, Filipe Gonçalves. The land rights for these lands were sold in 1498 to the nobleman Luís de Atouguia. Between 1499 and 1502 various royal letters, signed by King Manuel, indicated that there was a need to demolish the balconies and verandas that occupied public spaces in the district. This was part of a package of legislative reforms issued to improve the image of the city. A similar royal charter in 1500, was issued with the objective of transforming the free lands that still existed with the old walls. These initiatives lead to the first urbanization, named Vila Nova do Olival (around 1502), situated around the old Convent of the Trinity, using a series of administrative tools and proceedings that would, later, be used in the creation of the Bairro Alto. In 1505, the construction of the new royal palace, resulted in the move of the Court to the riverfront, and extended the city until the Cais do Sodré. Around 1513, the first move to divide the lands of the Bairro Alto began, under the approval of Lopo Atouguia. Bartolomeu de Andrade and his wife Francisca Cordovil received permission to section-off plots for the construction of houses. The new urbanization would be designated Vila Nova de Andrade. After the establishment of a grid network of roads, the first houses began to be built, with the majority popping-up south of the Portas de Santa Catarina in 1514. The remainder of the homes also began occupying plots along Rua das Flores, Rua do Cabo, Rua do Castelo, the consecutively named Rua Primeira, Segunda and Terceira, in addition to the Rua da Barroca do Mar. By 1527, there were a total of 408 buildings in the area, totalling 1600 inhabitants. During the 1530s, the agglomeration began to spread towards the old Estrada de Santos (now the Calçada do Combro), tracing or following to the north of this route, where it encountered Rua da Rosa, Rua da Atalaia, Rua dos Calafates (now Rua Diário de Notícias), Rua das Gáveas, Rua do Norteand Rua de São Roque. The 1531 earthquake resulted in a need to increase the number of residential homes, speeding the growth of the Bairro. The first Jesuits arrived in Portugal in 1540. In 1551, the civil parishes of Mártires and Loreto included 2464 homes and 20132 inhabitants. The second phase of urbanization in the Bairro Alto began around 1553, with the implantation of the Society of Jesus () in the civil parish of São Roque, initiating a period of polarized growth, due to their presence. At that time, the zone to the north of Estrada de Santos began being referred to as the Bairro Alto de São Roque. This new phase, growth extended from São Roque until the terrains of the Palace of the Counts of Avintes to the north, limited by the Rua de São Boaventura, Rua do Loureiro, Rua da Cruz and Rua Formosa (now Rua do Século). In 1559, the civil parish of Santa Catarina was created. Less than a decade later, the Largo de São Roque was formed, and the beginning of the construction of new church and residences of the Society of Jesus were initiated. The enlargement of the route between the Portas de Catarina and Largo de São Roque would occur in 1569, becoming known as the Rua Larga de São Roque. The civil parish of Encarnação was formed in 1679. Although the Bairro was not significantly affected by the 1755 Lisbon earthquake, the Marquess of Pombal developed plans to restructure the urban fabric between the Bairro Alto and Baixa, which included standardizing the largos, squares and roads. Between 1760 and 1780, was the beginning of the renovation/remodelling of the roads Rua de São Roque, Rua de Calhariz and Rua do Século, that included the widening of the routes and construction of new buildings. Around the 19th century, the northern limites of the Bairro, including the zone around São Pedro de Alcântara up to Príncipe Real were delimited. The area was consolidated with the construction of a group of diverse buildings and specifically rental properties. The block that existed between Rua da Rosa and the Travessa do Tijolo came to condition activity in the neighborhood, including the establishment of various newspapers, of which O Bolastill remains. In 1880, the municipal council decided to widen the Rua dos Moinhos do Vento (now the Rua de São Pedro de Alcântara), expropriating lands and buildings that restricted its expansion. In 1881, lots pertaining to the Count of Soure in the Alto do Longo area of the Bairro were opened to the public. This zone maintained a semi-rural character, with single-storey houses and courtyards, until the alteration of Rua D. Pedro V (the old Estrada da Cotovia), when the construction of four- and five-storey homes came to eliminate these early residences. In 1887 the Caixa Geral de Depósitos was installed in the Palace of Sobral. Republic The old Travessa da Estrela became known as Rua Luísa Todi in 1917. In the middle of the 20th century (1945), the Instituto do Vinho do Porto installed itself in the Palace of Ludovice, in a project under the architect Jorge Segurado. The creation of the Gabinete Técnico do Bairro Alto (Bairro Alto Technical Council) in 1989, and the beginning of a city council policy on urban rehabilitation and renewal. In the last decades of the 20th century, there was a significant socio-cultural dynamic in the area, as a great part of the nightlife became dependent on the restaurants and bars of the quarter. Lisbon's city council made extensive remodelling and repairs to the district, resulting in the opening of new restaurants, clubs and trendy shops. While cars were restricted in the district (except for residents and emergency vehicles), many young people began to live in the Bairro; it is generally a youth-oriented heart of the sub-culture and nightlife of Lisbon. In 2002 some arteries in the Bairro were restricted to pedestrian traffic. A 2004 dispatch from the President of the IPPAR, dated 11 November, determined the opening of a process to classify the district as architecturally significant. From 1 November 2008, many of the bars in Bairro Alto were forced to close their doors at 2:00 a.m., due to noise complaints. However, after 1 August 2009, this restriction was alleviated with an extension to 3:00 a.m., which also included the increase in the number of police officers assigned to the district, to patrol the streets. Around this time, the city council approved a 1.2 million Euro investment project to improve the area's physical appearance and improve security, as well as tackling the excessive graffiti problem. Geography The Praça Luís de Camões near the historical gates of Santa Catarina The Ascensor da Glória connecting between the Praça dos Restauradores and Avenida da Liberdade Although central to Lisbon, it is normally identified by a different urban nucleus. Bairro Alto is characterized by orthogonal blocks, sometimes rectangular, with a proportion of two lots wide by six or eight lots in length, with many of the length dimensions accompanying the roads, while the shorter dimensions following the lanes. This spatial configuration is not fixed completely within the district. For example, north of the Travessa da Queimada, the blocks, although maintaining a rectangular form, are of different dimensions, with the laneway-side representing those of longer length. It is this model that guides the blocks where the majority of the 16th and 17th century buildings are located. In a few cases, there are also meio chão configurations, destined for those of the population with less financial resources. Further, there are rare instances in the district where one lot may encompass an entire block, such as the Palace of Andrade and the Palace Ludovice. During the Pombaline era, there was an increase in the number of multiple lots with the standard dimensions. The large occupation rate in the 17th and 18th centuries originated in the changes to the dimensions of these blocks. Many of the buildings were expanded, both in height, in addition to size. It is this form that predominates the Bairro, which is highly dense, somber and where only the upper floors are exposed to direct sunlight. The design of the roadways that run through the Bairro Alto, consists of a hierarchy of structural roads, oriented north to south in the direction of the Tagus River, and secondary lanes, perpendicular to the roads, running east to west. The hierarchy of these routes are homogeneous in scale, with little variation in size in roads or lanes, a characteristic that is missing from the zones adjacent to the Bairro Alto, preserving an intimacy and unique character. Architecture The multi-storey Pombaline-era facade of the Consulate-General of Brazil in the Bairro The inclined streets and 3-storey buildings in a typical street In addition to being formed in an orthogonal layout, the construction in the Bairro Alto used new construction techniques for the time: the transition from buildings built in wood to those completed in stone masonry. The older homes in the bairro, dating from the 16th and 17th centuries are characteristically two types: low buildings with two storeys (ground and first floor), square, asymmetric with small windows and sills; and buildings that were long and narrow, consisting of three floors with windows, balconies and aligned spans. The first type, from the rural architectural tradition, were generally substituted for the second (which allowed a higher rate of occupation), with examples surviving to this day. The second type, which are more common, are, nonetheless, infrequent (with the exception existing along the Rua da Atalaia. From the natural typological evolution, and growth in the resident population during the 17th century, each of these types served the necessities of its inhabitants, and as a result, there were alterations to the layouts and façades over time. Although the 1755 earthquake did not result in great damage to the Bairro, there are examples of Pombaline- era frame system employed in some of these buildings. The Pombaline building of the period is characterized by a four-storey block with differentiated windows. The façade is recognized by a symmetry made possible by a central staircase, with two opposite sets, and the windows in the mansard roofs. By the beginning of the 19th century, the Pombaline style gave way to a simplification and enhancement of the Pombaline-era buildings. While, generally, the gaioleiro-style reinforcement of the buildings is not common, many of the Pombaline buildings were redesigned in keeping with the design aesthetic of the time. The construction of palacettes in this Romanticism style, resulted from a collage of the French aesthetic influences, identified primarily in the north and east of Bairro Alto, and especially in the area of São Pedro de Alcântara, where the Palacete Laranjeiras is the best example. This was a period that emphasized the façade of the buildings, with large verandas. They present a strong characteristic of the façade, with protruding balconies, fine gratings, frame spans over worked masonry and the application of curved lines, especially in the design of courtyards and windows along street corners. At the same time, some buildings were constructed to house workers, organized into villages or in courtyards, such as the Pátio do Tijolo (literally, the Yard of Bricks). These were multi-family buildings, usually two to three storeys in height, with a high occupancy and little space. Architectural influences from the 20th century are limited, and restricted to a few points.

Species The genus contains five species: *Equivalent teeth shrew mole (U. aequodonenia) *Anderson's shrew mole (U. andersoni) *Gracile shrew mole (U. gracilis) *Inquisitive shrew mole (U. investigator) *Chinese shrew mole (U. soricipes) Although each species' official English common name still calls them \\"shrew moles\\", Uropsilus today are referred to as \\"shrew-like moles\\" to distinguish them from other shrew moles, Neurotrichus gibbsii of North America, and the Urotrichini, or Japanese shrew moles, both of which are morphologically quite different from Uropsilus and are grouped with the Old World Moles and relatives. As a result, the term \\"shrew-like moles\\" has been used to refer to Uropsilus, although specific species are still called \\"shrew moles\\". Although little is currently known regarding any aspect of their natural history, Uropsilus are thought to be the most ancestral group of moles, and as such, very similar to the primitive talpid from which all Talpidae have evolved.

The Carolingian successors of Pepin the Short appointed chancellors over the whole Frankish realm in the ninth century. Hincmar refers to this official as a summus cancellarius in De ordine palatii et regni and an 864 charter of King Lothair I refers to Agilmar, Archbishop of Vienne, as archchancellor, a word which also begins appearing in chronicles about that time. The last Carolingian archchancellor in West Francia was Archbishop Adalberon of Reims (969-988), with the accession of Hugh Capet the office was replaced by a Chancelier de France. At the court of Otto I, then King of Germany, the title seems to have been an appanage of the Archbishop of Mainz. After Otto had finally deposed King Berengar II of Italy and was crowned Holy Roman Emperor in 962, a similar office was created for the Imperial Kingdom of Italy. By the early eleventh century, this office was perennially held by the Archbishop of Cologne. Theoretically, the archbishop of Mainz took care of Imperial affairs for Germany and the Archbishop of Cologne for Italy, though the latter often used deputies, his see being outside of his kingdom. A third office was created about 1042 by Emperor Henry III for the recently acquired Kingdom of Burgundy. He initially bestowed it on Archbishop Hugh I of Besançon.Stefan Weinfurter, The Salian Century: Main Currents in an Age of Transition (University of Pennsylvania Press, 1999), p. 97. It only appears in the hands of the Archbishop of Trier in the twelfth century as the chancellory of Arles, as Burgundy was then known. By the Golden Bull of 1356, Emperor Charles IV confirmed the threefold division of the archchancellory among the three ecclesiastical Prince-electors of the Empire. Actual governmental functions like calling the Imperial elections, however, were carried out by the Mainz archbishops alone. The office in this form was part of the constitution of the Empire until the German Mediatisation in 1803, when Mainz was secularised. The last elector, Karl Theodor Anton Maria von Dalberg, however, retained the title of archchancellor until the dissolution of the Empire in 1806. There was a marked resemblance between the medieval archchancellor and the later chancellors of the German Empire, the Weimar Republic, Reincke. and the Austrian Empire. The title is continued by the present-day Chancellors of Germany and Austria. In France the title of \\"Archchancellor of the Empire\\" was given to Napoleon I's chief legal advisor, Jean-Jacques-Régis de Cambacérès. In modern times, there is an Archchancellor in the virtual state of Imperial Throne, the position is held by Anton Bakov who was appointed by the Emperor Nicholas III.https://www.wsj.com/articles/this-mans-quest-to-restore-the-russian- empire-isnt-going-well-1492351200https://www.rt.com/news/376747-romanovs- bakov-kiribatu-empire/ Archchancellors of the Holy Roman Empire * Bardo (c. 1042–1051) * Liutpold (c. 1055–) * Bruno (c. 1114) * Albrecht (c. 1130) See also *Chancellor *Archchancellor of Unseen University NotesSources *Charles du Fresne, sieur du Cange.

Early life Wing was born in Hackney, London, and started out as an artist's model and later, during the Second World War, worked in East End hospitals. At age 30, she married the actor Peter Davey, by whom she had a son, actor-director Mark Wing-Davey, but the marriage ended in divorce after six years. Her seven years as the lover of Philip O'Connor, a surrealist writer and contemporary of Stephen Spender and Laurie Lee, saw her spend some time as a nursery teacher in West London. With her new lover she had a second son, Jon O'Connor. Career Wing is best known for portraying the Beale and Fowler family matriarch Lou Beale on EastEnders from the show's inception in February 1985, until the character was killed off in July 1988. She quit her role in the hit show as she was unhappy with the direction in which it was going, but later reflected that it may not have been the right decision. Wing studied at the Croydon School of Acting in London, and appeared in London repertory theatre for over 65 years. She also performed in Canada at the Stratford Festival in 1967. She made an earlier soap appearance in Market in Honey Lane for ATV in the late 1960s. She also had a role in the Doctor Who serial \\"Kinda\\" in 1982. Other TV credits include The Witches and the Grinnygog, Dixon of Dock Green, Z-Cars, Play for Today and The Sweeney. Her film career included roles in Billy Liar (1963), Two Gentlemen Sharing (1969), The 14 (1973) which also featured her future EastEnders co-star June Brown, A Doll's House starring Jane Fonda (1973), Providence (1977), The Hound of the Baskervilles (1978), The Ploughman's Lunch (1983), and 3 British horror films – Full Circle (1977), The Godsend (1980) and Xtro (1983), in which her character was killed by a life-size Action Man doll. After leaving EastEnders, Wing continued to work on stage, playing the medium, Madame Arcati, in Noël Coward's comedy Blithe Spirit. She also had numerous television roles, including parts in Casualty, Doctors, French and Saunders, The Bill, as well as adding her vocal talents to the animated series Fungus the Bogeyman. Her later film credits included The Calcium Kid with Orlando Bloom, Tooth (2004), in which she played an ancient fairy), and Grandma in the 2007 film Son of Rambow. In May 2005 she attended the British Soap Awards, where she presented June Brown with a lifetime achievement award for Brown's portrayal of Dot Branning in EastEnders. In 2005, by now aged 91, Wing formed part of the cast of the short film Ex Memoria, directed by Josh Appignanesi and produced by Oscar-winning producer Mia Bays. The short film tells of an elderly woman's struggle with Alzheimer's Disease. Ex Memoria was nominated for a British Independent Film Award for Best Short in 2006. In 2009, aged 94, she worked on a short film, Numbers Up, from Guildhall Pictures. The same year Wing was appointed Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in the 2009 Birthday Honours for her services to drama and charity. In April 2012, she appeared in the music video for Quarrel's 'Is It Cool?'. Later life Wing was a member of the Religious Society of Friends, the Quakers, and supported the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament. She attended the funeral of her EastEnders onscreen daughter Wendy Richard on 9 March 2009. She died in her sleep on 7 July 2013, at the age of 98. The episode of EastEnders that was broadcast the following day was dedicated to her memory, and was immediately followed by a 90-second long BBC News report, the headlines of which included her death. Her funeral took place in London. Adam Woodyatt was a mourner.

They appeared as permanent cast members from Mighty Morphin Power Rangers until Power Rangers in Space. Bulk (by himself) was a recurring character in Power Rangers Lost Galaxy and Skull made one cameo appearance, making the pair the two longest consecutively appearing characters in the program. They later returned for a cameo in Power Rangers Wild Force and in Power Rangers Samurai where Bulk is teaching Skull's son Spike how to be a samurai. Bulk and Skull are portrayed by Paul Schrier and Jason Narvy respectively. Character overview Bulk and Skull provided much of the comic relief in the series, usually through an over-the-top slapstick; their actions were often punctuated with cartoony sound effects, and they came with their own leitmotif, which Jason Narvy has said was based on Skull's high pitched, whiny laugh and \\"fat guy: tuba\\". Black Nerd Comedy : Power Morphicon 2010 (Part 1) - Character Actors (6.48 to 7.11) This was highlighted by their physical appearances: Bulk was heavyset and Skull was lean, similar in style to the comedy duo Laurel and Hardy. Bulk was the dominant member of the duo, and Skull would usually follow and attempt to emulate Bulk and repeat whatever Bulk had said, usually beginning with \\"Yeah\\". Appearances=MMPR pilots In the pilot for the TV show, a gang of punk bullies included an unnamed character played by Paul Schrier. One of the gang members hits on Kimberly but she rejects his advances. This leads to the entire gang engaging in line dancing at a bowling alley with the five Rangers-to-be. Each one is disposed of by a typical gang manner, such as a generic \\"Punk #5\\" played by Paul Schrier sliding into the bowling pins when kicked in the back by Jason. Another gang member is unwittingly hit by Billy. Jason Narvy is not present in the pilot. Schrier got the role, according to him, by turning up ten minutes earlier than the other auditioning actors, so the director standing in for \\"Punk #5\\" at the audition got him to do it.Power Morphicon 2010: Bulk and Skull Panel Part 2 02:50 - 04:12 In a second pilot, shown at Power Morphicon 2007, Schrier was playing a named character (Bulk) and was now the leader of the gang, which included Jason Narvy as Skull. Narvy had originally auditioned for Billy and was called back to audition for Skull, as, according to Narvy, the actor who played \\"Punk #1\\" in the pilot was thought to look too intimidating to play a comedic character. He turned up to his audition intending to be obnoxious, as he was tired of the industry at the time, which helped get the role; Narvy and Schrier quickly bonded during rehearsals.Power Morphicon 2010: Bulk and Skull Panel Part 2 04:00 - 06:02 This version of Bulk was defeated in a similar slapstick style to the show - he's eventually tied up by a skipping rope - but is more menacing than he'd be in the series, physically intimidating Kimberly (who sounds worried about angering him), using some of the lines from \\"Punk #1\\", and throwing aside both the female punk & Skull when they get in his way. The debut of the pilot's Bulk and Skull would end up as the ending scene in the episode \\"Big Sisters\\".Youtube:\\"Power Morphicon 2007- Tony Oliver's Documentary/Closing 2of6\\" Mighty Morphin Power Rangers Bulk and Skull started out as bullies at Angel Grove High School, usually targeting the Power Rangers in the 'B plots' of the episode. They were regulars at Angel Grove's Youth Center. Their actions were motivated by greed and ego in the first season. Wacky schemes abound (such as creating an obviously-fake kung fu style called \\"Cockroach Kung Fu\\" to attempting to catch fish or claiming reward money for themselves) always ends in failure and/or humiliation. They are also frequently put in detention by Angel Grove High's somewhat-antagonistic but well meaning principal, Mr. Caplan. In early episodes, as with the second pilot, Bulk and Skull had accomplices: a female punk is with them in \\"Teamwork\\" and \\"Food Fight\\", and a black male punk in \\"Food Fight\\". Early scripts for Season 1 show the female punk was meant to be a recurring character named Sharkie. She was written into scripts up into \\"The Trouble With Shellshock\\"Project Hexagon: Season 1 scripts (The name, was differently spelled, and was already in use on Fox Kids). Skull had a crush on Kimberly, and Bulk appeared to want to win Trini's heart, as well, in a few episodes. Whenever the girls were alone, they tried their best to win them over, although it resulted in Bulk and Skull's humiliation. When Kimberly and Trini are with the four male Rangers, they are called six \\"nerds\\" and \\"geeks\\" (despite the fact that Kimberly originally appeared to be ditzy and materialistic, not intellectual), and occasionally \\"dorks\\" and \\"losers\\", as well, among other insults. This group of demeaning insults and name-calling would eventually turn against them by the time of the episode \\"A Friend in Need\\", when two teenage girls call them as such throughout the episode. This was later explained by Paul Schrier himself that the two were being angry at the world and jealous of the ranger teens, hence the namecalling, shoving, and bullying that they originally did. Often, the duo got themselves mixed up with some of the villains' schemes. In \\"Green with Evil: Part IV\\", the two tried to flee the city in a bus, but were taken hostage by the giant Goldar. The Power Rangers had to summon the Megazord to save them from being thrown over a cliff. In \\"The Mutiny: Part 2\\", when Pirantishead places magic on their ATVs making them drive out of control, until Part 3, Billy uses his machine to remove the spell. In \\"Zedd Waves\\", when Beamcaster places a spell on the citizens puts them in a trance, stand up with arms out, begin walking aimlessly and chant 'Hail Lord Zedd', he first hit Bulk then Skull, Skull unlike Bulk, the citizens and the Rangers saying 'Hail Lord Zedd', Skull says 'Hail Lord Fred'. When the Rangers (free from the trance) destroyed him with the Power Blaster the citizens and Bulk and Skull are free. In \\"The Wedding\\", when they went to Australia with the Rangers for Spring Break, Alpha 5, who was under the influence of a brainwashing computer disc, sent them to the outback, where they encountered Australian wildlife up close. After the disc was removed and Alpha sent them back, they decided that if anyone asked, \\"nothing happened!\\" In the following episode, \\"Return of the Green Ranger: Part I\\", the Wizard of Deception brainwashed them into going to get a lock of Tommy's hair, but failed miserably. The Wizard angrily put Bulk and Skull to sleep for their failure. During the early part of the first season, Bulk and Skull would occasionally be presented as threats, physically intimidating or attempting to assault the Rangers or others; Bulk even had a bench press record in \\"A Pressing Engagement\\". Over time, while still being antagonistic, their more aggressive nature was toned down and they would get some more sympathetic portrayals. In the first-season episode \\"Foul Play in the Sky\\", which had footage shot later in production and then edited in later, Bulk and Skull were even shown with a normal hobby, plane-spotting and politely asking to join Kimberly; \\"A Pig Surprise\\" would have them happily looking after a pig; and in the three-part \\"The Ninja Encounter\\" in season two, when Bulk spotted a runaway baby stroller he and Skull immediately sprang into action to help out, and the duo would spend the rest of the episode looking after the baby boy after his father was abducted by Goldar. This was also the first time the duo were seen on skateboards which, despite their generally unathletic nature, they appeared moderately skilled at. During the second season, they attempted to discover the secret identities of the Power Rangers and repeatedly failed, eventually giving up by the time of the episode \\"A Friend in Need Part III\\". During this time, Bulk and Skull started showing greater intelligence and initiative than before, coming up with complicated plans and utilizing bizarre gadgets. They discovered the Rangers' identities twice. At one time, they saved the Rangers when the Ranger team lost their memories and de-morphed in front of them - Bulk and Skull tricked the Scatterbrain monster to fire his amnesia beam through two prisms, distorting the beam and restoring the Rangers' memories. Unfortunately, Bulk and Skull lost their short-term memories in the process due to being flung back by the amnesia beam and landing on their heads. The second time, a psychic pointed the Ranger teens out to Bulk, but he did not believe her as they were holding a picture of the morphed Ranger team at the time when it was just given to them by Ernie. A change of direction for the duo occurred in the third season of Mighty Morphin Power Rangers, when they joined the Angel Grove Junior Police Force (having heard girls like men in uniform) and first met Lieutenant Jerome Stone, explicitly changing from stereotypical bullies into good natured goofs; Ernie and the Rangers expressed pride at the duo for graduating police training. Lt. Stone became a permanent character himself, frequently giving Bulk and Skull orders that they failed to perform, leading eventually to his anger (rather than just their humiliation). Despite this, Bulk and Skull were close to Lt. Stone and took their new jobs seriously as they would be shown trying to perform police duties (albeit incompetently) and occasionally try to help people in trouble: in \\"The Changing of the Zords: Part I\\" they rushed to save children from drowning (who were not), in \\"Follow That Cab\\" they tried to stop a thief who'd stolen Kimberly's car and managed to apprehend him, ironically after they inadvertently helped him, In \\"Rita's Pita\\" they used their own money as donations to an elderly home to cover for their mistake, and they assisted in a housing project in \\"Another Brick in the Wall\\". A number of season three jokes would also be based around Bulk and Skull constantly running into monsters and being comically terrified; in \\"The Changing of the Zords: Part II\\", Lt. Stone finally questioned why they always seem to run into monsters. The best way to describe them is \\"monster magnets\\". Mighty Morphin Alien Rangers Bulk and Skull are regressed to children due to Master Vile's Orb of Doom. They would act like the bullies they were in the first season. Unlike what happened when Lord Zedd regressed time, Bulk and Skull did not have their memories altered to believe they were already acquainted with everyone they knew when Master Vile activated the orb. As a result, they did not recognize any of the rangers other than Billy. Bulk is briefly turned into the \\"Brat Boy\\" monster by Rita and Zedd during the course of the mini-series and battles the Aquitian Rangers, but soon rebels against his masters as his human self surfaces from within, prompting Rita and Zedd to return him to normal in retaliation. Paul Schrier directed a few \\"Mighty Morphin Alien Rangers\\" episodes, including \\"Attack of the 60' Bulk\\", which he also appeared in briefly, despite his character at the time being reduced to the age of a child. Schrier (under the name of Paul Schrier II) had also directed a few episodes of Power Rangers: Turbo during the first half of the season (while his character of Bulk was a chimp). Power Rangers: Zeo During Power Rangers Zeo, Bulk and Skull remained members of the Junior Police Force (even getting a new motorcycle with a sidecar). They remained members until Bulk's attempts to woo the police chief's daughter accidentally caused Lt. Stone to be fired. They quit the force out of loyalty to Stone and joined him when he opened his own detective agency. While they initially continued to be scared of monsters, their sub-plots would shift towards their detective work after they switched jobs. In \\"The Joke's On Blue\\", they also had to clash with a rival gang of detectives, Humphrey and Bogart, who were trying to frame a new student named Robert for a series of practical jokes all over town, until Kat and Tanya helped expose the rival detectives as the practical jokers with the help of the owner of the novelty shop in identifying both Humphrey and Bogart as his best customers. Also, during this time, Bulk and Skull secretly hosted Rito and Goldar, who lost their memories after setting up the bomb that destroyed the Command Center at the end of Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers, adopting them as their \\"pets\\" (though the two monsters really were more like Bulk and Skull's servants). However, when Rito and Goldar regained their memories, they turned on their masters and went back to Lord Zedd and Rita. In one episode, Skull shows he is an adept classical pianist by playing Chopin's Revolutionary Etude. While Skull enjoyed classical music, it was something of a hidden shame behind his tough guy image. Fearing mockery, he kept his talent hidden even from Bulk. This moment shows that the Rangers thought of Bulk and Skull as their friends and vice versa, when Skull confides in Adam about his talents and He offers him his support, advising Bulk would do the same if he were truly his friend. After seeing Skull perform at a recital, Bulk was honestly moved and praised his friend, joining him on stage to applaud him. Perhaps Bulk and Skull's greatest achievement during their time in the series occurred during this season. In the \\"King for a Day\\" two- parter, they're accidentally trapped in Prince Gasket's prison while looking for a lost Tommy. They encountered another prisoner, a reptilian alien named Tritor, who believed them to be great heroic warriors that Gasket had abducted. The duo play up this façade and end up being part of Tritor's plan to free the other prisoners. They get to defeat a squad of Cogs, while Tritor manages to destroy both the brain drain machine that had been used on Tommy and the other prisoners, and the generator to the forcefield that trapped the Rangers in the Machine Arena and prevented them from morphing. Before dropping them back on Earth, Tritor says that they will be legends and honored on his homeworld of Horath which they have just helped save. Nobody believes their later tale, except for Tommy, Katherine and Jason who overhear them boasting about it. However, thinking they are just being further mocked, the duo storm off. Near the end of Zeo, Bulk and Skull take a test for their detectives licenses. A monster attack occurs during the test, but the duo believe it to be part of the exam. They manage to take the test during the entire attack, even as the office falls apart around them. When Detective Stone presents them with their results, they are initially pleased that they passed. Detective Stone then reveals that normally they would have failed, but they examiners gave them extra points for completing the test during the monster attack. This ends up shocking the two as they realize the attack was real and they could've died. Zeo concluded with Bulk and Skull accepting an offer to work for an agency in France on a top secret mission, They departed much to the dismay and frustration of Stone. This major plot point was dropped without explanation in between Zeo and filming of Turbo: A Power Rangers Movie. The main reason being was that Zeo was originally the last series the duo were set to appear on, with a spin-off show being planned. However, this would be cancelled. Turbo: A Power Rangers Movie At the beginning of the movie, Bulk, Skull, and Lieutenant Stone are again seen working as police officers (the reason for this remains unexplained until the first episode of Power Rangers Turbo). Later, while on a secluded road, they are abducted by Elgar to be used as sacrifices for Maligore, scrambling their brains in the process to make them easier to deal with. When Divatox deems the pair inadequate as sacrifices, they are thrown below deck on the Subcraft. Due to the brain scramble, they come to be under the impression that they are Antonio Bandaras (Skull) and an unnamed German (Bulk), much to the annoyance of their inmates, Jason and Kimberly. In spite of their disoriented state of mind, they are able to successfully escape the Subcraft with Jason and Kimberly and are later rescued by the Power Rangers, who presumably help them restore their minds back to the way they were. Power Rangers: Turbo At the start of Power Rangers Turbo, Bulk and Skull are given one last chance to rejoin the Police Force with Lt. Stone. Unfortunately, their assignment inadvertently brings them into contact with Elgar, who turns them into chimpanzees. This marked a permanent end to Bulk and Skull's time with the police. Bulk and Skull would remain chimpanzees for several episodes. They are voiced by their respective, however only the audience can understand them. Lt. Stone takes the chimpanzees into his care (claiming that they seem 'familiar'). They make several attempts to inform him and others of their true identities, but are unsuccessful. (They were transformed into Chimps so Narvy and Schrier would have time to work on a proposed spin-off series for the characters which would have seen them operate a hotel, featuring El Vez, the \\"Mexican Elvis\\" (a local personality in Southern California). The attempts never made it to a final production, and the actors returned full-time to the series.Audio interview with Paul Schrier) Later, four of the Rangers are shrunk by one of Divatox's monsters. They use one of her submarine's torpedoes (her way of making monsters grow) to return to normal. Bulk and Skull happened to be near the impact site and are returned to normal as a result, though they are also temporarily made invisible. This state only lasts for three episodes, until they become visible again. When they return, Stone asks where they've been, to which they reply, \\"Just monkeying around.\\" Out of high school and no longer on the force, Bulk and Skull needed something to do. Stone arranged for them to get jobs – ranging from pizza delivery to construction. They were always fired from them, so they usually had new jobs in every episode they appeared in. Also during this time, they got to know the second generation of Turbo Rangers. During most of the season, the Rangers were used to their wacky antics and tolerated them, but they seemed to like the two, with T.J. specifically treating them as his friends. Notably, in \\"Parts and Parcel\\", Bulk and Skull are suspected of stealing from their current job and T.J. outright states to the Rangers that he knows they would not do that, and as the Red Ranger, he goes on to prove them innocent. Power Rangers in Space In \\"Save Our Ship\\", Bulk and Skull spot a UFO approaching Earth. They end up going to work for Professor Phenomenus, who is constantly on the search for aliens on Earth. The professor immediately proved to be very odd, but also quite brilliant. The trio's antics frequently saw them crossing paths with the Space Rangers (whenever they were on Earth, of course). Due to the Rangers' adventures often taking them off Earth, Bulk and Skull appeared less frequently than in the previous seasons, showing up in only thirteen of its forty-three episodes. In \\"Countdown to Destruction\\", Bulk and Skull undergo their most noteworthy change. The Space Rangers had battled the invading forces of Astronema, but were overwhelmed and forced to retreat. Astronema demanded that the Rangers be turned over to her or else Earth would be destroyed. When other civilians openly question the Power Rangers' dependability, Bulk says, \\"The Rangers have never let us down before. We have to believe they'll be here.\\" The next morning, the Rangers (sans Andros, who left to board the Dark Fortress) intend to turn themselves in to save Earth. However, Bulk suddenly announces he's a Ranger, prompting Skull, Professor Phenomenus and every other present civilian to do the same. A frustrated Astronema orders their destruction, but then the real Space Rangers reveal themselves (Bulk is stunned to learn the Rangers were \\"them\\"). As the Rangers battle Elgar, the Quantrons and the Piranhatrons, Bulk & Skull have arguably their most defining moment. Bulk, inspired by the Rangers, rallies the civilians together to \\"get in there\\" and he and Skull lead the charge to help the Rangers in battle, Bulk fighting off a Quantron to protect Zhane and Skull pulling a Piranhatron off Ashley and throwing it away. After Zordon's energy wave destroys the invading forces, Bulk, Skull and Professor Phenomenous are among those celebrating. In the original plans for in Space, Bulk and Skull were going to form a volunteer Citizen Force Group to protect Angel Grove while the Power Rangers were away.Project Hexagon: Mega Rangers Element Breakdown Power Rangers: Lost Galaxy Bulk and Professor Phenomenus board the space station Terra Venture for its interstellar journey. Certain that they were forgetting something, Bulk and the Professor realized too late that Skull was not with them. Skull had overslept and did not wake up in time to join them. Sometime into Terra Venture's journey, the two were working at the station's restaurant, the Comet Cafe. Mike Corbett thought they were supposed to be working in the science division. Despite Professor Phenomenus' attempted spin, Bulk clarified that they had been fired. At the end of the series, Bulk and Phenomenus survived Terra Venture's crash and evacuation to Mirinoi. After the Galaxy Rangers saved the people from Trakeena's last attack, Bulk and the Professor were among those cheering them. Power Rangers: Wild Force During the Power Rangers Wild Force episode \\"Forever Red\\", Bulk and Skull made a special cameo appearance, though how Bulk returned from Mirinoi is never explained. Bulk and Skull were shown as servers and managers of a tropical-themed bar called \\"Bulkmeier's\\". Tommy Oliver, the veteran Power Ranger, is also present. In this episode, Bulk and Skull were shown having a conversation about the early days of Power Rangers - in particular, Bulk is bragging to Skull about how he once met Lord Zedd and Rita Repulsa. Skull feigns interest before pointedly reminding him that he did, too. Bulk takes a call from Andros that was meant for Tommy, and the two seemed somewhat intimidated by the idea of talking to Tommy despite having known him for years; they may be aware that he's a Ranger. In the original cut of \\"Forever Red\\", their scene went on longer. The two would try to refer to more monsters to one-up each other (including later monsters they had not seen on screen; Skull stated he was avoiding Phenomenous; and the characters are wary of Tommy because he's their boss and the real owner of Bulkmeier's.Forever Red Archived Footage (YouTube) (As this was never aired, it is not taken as canon and was contradicted by the later Power Rangers Dino Thunder.) In an earlier outline of Forever Red, Bulk & Skull were not going to be present but Tommy would pass up a T-shirt of \\"the famous two-man rock band Bulk & Skull\\".Forever Red: Ten Years Later This was Schrier's final on-screen appearance for nine years until his return on Power Rangers Samurai, and Narvy's final appearance until the Power Rangers Super Samurai episode \\"Samurai Forever\\". Between Lost Galaxy and Wild Force, Schrier was still involved with the PR Crew, voicing Infinitor in Power Rangers Lightspeed Rescue and Severax in Power Rangers Time Force. Power Rangers Samurai/Super Samurai Power Rangers Samurai follows Bulk trying to train Skull's son Spike in the ways of the Samurai, but failing each time. The two of them operated out of a converted garage. Due to Bulk's sister's marriage with Skull, Spike addresses him as \\"Uncle Bulk\\" - he had to be reminded to call him \\"Sensei\\" during training. Much like his father, Spike has a big crush on the Pink Ranger. Skull made a brief appearance in the Power Rangers Super Samurai finale, \\"Samurai Forever\\", where Skull picks up his son; he arrives in a limo with a suit. Bulk and Skull size each other up and Bulk remarks he's changed, but after a brief tease of conflict they're shown to still be friends. Skull remains accident-prone as he and Spike hit their heads on a sign when waving good-bye to Bulk. In the original casting sides, Bulk and Spike were not present and the comic relief were two singing roadsweepers \\"Big Mack\\" and \\"Skinny Jack\\".Den of Geek: The Power Rangers Seasons We Never Saw (May 9th 2014) Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: The Movie Bulk and Skull participated in the charity skydive with the Ranger teens, but landed in the construction site where Ivan Ooze's prison egg would be unearthed. They are later seen during a party at Ernie's, and assist the Rangers' young friend Fred Kelman and the other Kids in stopping the parents of Angel Grove from leaping to their deaths. When the movie ends with a celebration at Angel Grove Harbor and a sign thanking the Power Rangers for saving the world is lit up, Bulk and Skull are offended, even though they just played a major part in saving people's lives. Canceled spinoff Around the time of Zeo, Saban planned to make a Bulk and Skull comedy spinoff show, where they would run a hotel (Jason Narvy has said that he thinks it was \\"their grandmothers' hotel\\"). A Mexican Elvis impersonator was going to be a supporting character. Narvy claims that the video release The Good, The Bad, and the Stupid was put out as a \\"test market\\" and when \\"no one out there bought it\\", Saban cancelled the plans.Power Morphicon 2010 (Part 3) : Dark Side of the Power Coin : Black Nerd (1.17 to 1.31 and 2.41 to 3.00) This is also the reason why the characters were turned into chimpanzees in Turbo as the actors who played them were busy shooting the pilot for their spin-off.

Cromwell invaded Ireland with his New Model Army on behalf of England's Rump Parliament in August 1649. Following the Irish Rebellion of 1641, most of Ireland came under the control of the Irish Catholic Confederation. In early 1649, the Confederates allied with the English Royalists, who had been defeated by the Parliamentarians in the English Civil War. By May 1652, Cromwell's Parliamentarian army had defeated the Confederate and Royalist coalition in Ireland and occupied the country, ending the Irish Confederate Wars (or Eleven Years' War). However, guerrilla warfare continued for a further year. Cromwell passed a series of Penal Laws against Roman Catholics (the vast majority of the population) and confiscated large amounts of their land. The Parliamentarian conquest was brutal, and Cromwell is still a hated figure in Ireland.\\"Of all these doings in Cromwell's Irish Chapter, each of us may say what he will. Yet to everyone it will at least be intelligible how his name came to be hated in the tenacious heart of Ireland\\". John Morley, Biography of Oliver Cromwell.

WayBack Machine holds archive here The extent to which Cromwell, who was in direct command for the first year of the campaign, was responsible for the atrocities is debated to this day. Some historiansPhilip McKeiver in his, 2007, A New History of Cromwell's Irish Campaign and Tom Reilly, 1999, Cromwell: An Honourable Enemy argue that the actions of Cromwell were within the then-accepted rules of war, or were exaggerated or distorted by later propagandists; these claims have been challenged by others. The impact of the war on the Irish population was unquestionably severe, although there is no consensus as to the magnitude of the loss of life. The war resulted in famine,Padraig Lenihan, Confederate Catholics at War (2001) p112, 'As late as 1650, provisions were cheaper in Ireland than in England; the famine of 1651 onwards was a man made response to stubborn guerrilla warfare. Collective reprisals against the civilian population included forcing them out of designated no man's lands and the systematic destruction of foodstuffs'. which was worsened by an outbreak of bubonic plague. Estimates of the drop in the Irish population resulting from the Parliamentarian campaign range from 15 to 83 percent.15–25% *Padraig Lenihan, Confederate Catholics at War, p112 50%: *The History and Social Influence of the Potato, Redcliffe N. Salaman, Edited by JG Hawkes, 9780521316231, Cambridge University Press *How many died during Cromwell’s campaign? 83%: *The Cromwellian Settlement of Ireland by John Patrick Prendergast The Parliamentarians also transported about 50,000 people as indentured labourers. Some estimates cover population losses over the course of the Conquest Period (1649–52) only, while others cover the period of the Conquest to 1653 and the period of the Cromwellian Settlement from August 1652 to 1659 together. Background The English Rump Parliament, victorious in the English Civil War, and having executed King Charles in January 1649, had several reasons for sending the New Model Army to Ireland in 1649. The first and most pressing reason was an alliance signed in 1649 between the Irish Confederate Catholics, Charles II (who had been proclaimed King of Ireland in January 1649), and the English Royalists. This allowed for Royalist troops to be sent to Ireland and put the Irish Confederate Catholic troops under the command of Royalist officers led by James Butler, Earl of Ormonde. Their aim was to invade England and restore the monarchy there. This was a threat which the new English Commonwealth could not afford to ignore. Secondly, Parliament also had a longstanding commitment to re-conquer Ireland dating back to the Irish Rebellion of 1641. Even if the Irish Confederates had not allied themselves with the Royalists, it is likely that the English Parliament would have eventually tried to invade the country to crush Catholic power there. They had sent Parliamentary forces to Ireland throughout the Wars of the Three Kingdoms (most of them under Michael Jones in 1647). They viewed Ireland as part of the territory governed by right by the Kingdom of England and only temporarily out of its control since the Rebellion of 1641. Many Parliamentarians wished to punish the Irish for atrocities against English Protestant settlers during the 1641 Uprising. Furthermore, some Irish towns (notably Wexford and Waterford) had acted as bases from which privateers had attacked English shipping throughout the 1640s.O'Siochru, God's Executioner, p.69 & 96. In addition, the English Parliament had a financial imperative to invade Ireland to confiscate land there in order to repay its creditors. The Parliament had raised loans of £10 million under the Adventurers Act to subdue Ireland since 1642, on the basis that its creditors would be repaid with land confiscated from Irish Catholic rebels. To repay these loans, it would be necessary to conquer Ireland and confiscate such land. The Parliamentarians also had internal political reasons to send forces to Ireland. Army mutinies at Banbury and Bishopsgate in April and May 1649 were unsettling the New Model Army, and the soldiers' demands would probably increase if they were left idle. Finally, for some Parliamentarians, the war in Ireland was a religious war. Cromwell and much of his army were Puritans who considered all Roman Catholics to be heretics, and so for them the conquest was partly a crusade. The Irish Confederates had been supplied with arms and money by the Papacy and had welcomed the papal legate Pierfrancesco Scarampi and later the Papal Nuncio Giovanni Battista Rinuccini in 1643–49. The Battle of Rathmines and Cromwell's landing in Ireland By the end of the period, known as Confederate Ireland, in 1649 the only remaining Parliamentarian outpost in Ireland was in Dublin, under the command of Colonel Jones. A combined Royalist and Confederate force under the Marquess of Ormonde gathered at Rathmines, south of Dublin, to take the city and deprive the Parliamentarians of a port in which they could land. Jones, however, launched a surprise attack on the Royalists while they were deploying on 2 August, putting them to flight. Jones claimed to have killed around 4,000 Royalist or Confederate soldiers and taken 2,517 prisoners.McKeiver, A New History of Cromwell's Irish Campaign, page.59 Oliver Cromwell called the battle \\"an astonishing mercy, so great and seasonable that we are like them that dreamed\\",Antonia Fraser, Cromwell, our Chief of Men (1973), p. 324 as it meant that he had a secure port at which he could land his army in Ireland, and that he retained the capital city. With Admiral Robert Blake blockading the remaining Royalist fleet under Prince Rupert of the Rhine in Kinsale, Cromwell landed on 15 August with thirty-five ships filled with troops and equipment. Henry Ireton landed two days later with a further seventy-seven ships.Fraser, Cromwell our Chief of Men, p.326 Ormonde's troops retreated from around Dublin in disarray. They were badly demoralised by their unexpected defeat at Rathmines and were incapable of fighting another pitched battle in the short term. As a result, Ormonde hoped to hold the walled towns on Ireland's east coast to hold up the Cromwellian advance until the winter, when he hoped that \\"Colonel Hunger and Major Sickness\\" (i.e. hunger and disease) would deplete their ranks.Padraig Lenihan, Confederate Catholics at War, p.113 The Siege of Drogheda Upon landing, Cromwell proceeded to take the other port cities on Ireland's east coast, to facilitate the efficient landing of supplies and reinforcements from England. The first town to fall was Drogheda, about 50 km north of Dublin. Drogheda was garrisoned by a regiment of 3,000 English Royalist and Irish Confederate soldiers, commanded by Arthur Aston. After a week-long siege, Cromwell's forces breached the walls protecting the town. Aston refused Cromwell's request that he surrender. In the ensuing battle for the town, Cromwell ordered that no quarter be given, and the majority of the garrison and Catholic priests were killed. Many civilians also died in the sack. Aston was beaten to death by the Roundheads with his own wooden leg.Fraser, pp.336–339. . The massacre of the garrison in Drogheda, including some after they had surrendered and some who had sheltered in a church, was received with horror in Ireland and is used today as an example of Cromwell's extreme cruelty.O Siochru, God's Executioner, pp. 82–91. Faber & Faber (2008) Tom Reilly in Cromwell, an Honourable Enemy (Dingle 1999), argues that what happened at Drogheda was not unusually severe by the standards of 17th century siege warfare. In Cromwell was Framed (2014), he claims that civilians were not targeted. Having taken Drogheda, Cromwell took most of his army south to secure the south western ports. He sent a detachment of 5,000 men north under Robert Venables to take eastern Ulster from the remnants of a Scottish Covenanter army that had landed there in 1642. They defeated the Scots at the Battle of Lisnagarvey (6 December 1649) and linked up with a Parliamentarian army composed of English settlers based around Derry in western Ulster, which was commanded by Charles Coote. Wexford, Waterford and Duncannon Kilkenny Castle. The Irish Confederate capital of Kilkenny fell to Cromwell in 1650. The New Model Army then marched south to secure the ports of Wexford, Waterford and Duncannon. Wexford was the scene of another infamous atrocity, when Parliamentarian troops broke into the town while negotiations for its surrender were ongoing, and sacked it, killing about 2,000 soldiers and 1,500 townspeople and burning much of the town. Cromwell's responsibility for the sack of Wexford is disputed. He did not order the attack on the town, and had been in the process of negotiating its surrender when his troops broke into the town. On the other hand, his critics point out that he made little effort to restrain his troops or to punish them afterwards for their conduct. Arguably, the sack of Wexford was somewhat counter-productive for the Parliamentarians. The destruction of the town meant that the Parliamentarians could not use its port as a base for supplying their forces in Ireland. Secondly, the effects of the severe measures adopted at Drogheda and at Wexford were mixed. To some degree they may have been intended to discourage further resistance. The Gaelic Irish majority saw such towns as culturally English; seeing the Anglo-Irish being punished so harshly, the rural Gaelic Irish might expect even worse unless they complied with the invaders. The Royalist commander Ormonde thought that the terror of Cromwell's army had a paralysing effect on his forces. Towns like New Ross and Carlow subsequently surrendered on terms when besieged by Cromwell's forces. On the other hand, the massacres of the defenders of Drogheda and Wexford prolonged resistance elsewhere, as they convinced many Irish Catholics that they would be killed even if they surrendered. Such towns as Waterford, Duncannon, Clonmel, Limerick and Galway only surrendered after determined resistance. Cromwell was unable to take Waterford or Duncannon and the New Model Army had to retire to winter quarters, where many of its men died of disease, especially typhoid and dysentery. The port city of Waterford and Duncannon town eventually surrendered after prolonged sieges in 1650. Clonmel and the conquest of Munster Henry Ireton. Cromwell passed the command of Parliamentarian forces in Ireland to Ireton in 1650. He died of disease at the Siege of Limerick in 1651 The following spring, Cromwell mopped up the remaining walled towns in Ireland's southeast—notably the Confederate capital of Kilkenny, which surrendered on terms: see Siege of Kilkenny. The New Model Army met its only serious reverse in Ireland at the Siege of Clonmel, where its attacks on the towns walls were repulsed at a cost of up to 2,000 men. The town nevertheless surrendered the following day. Cromwell's treatment of Kilkenny and Clonmel is in contrast to that of Drogheda and Wexford. Despite the fact that his troops had suffered heavy casualties attacking the former two, Cromwell respected surrender terms which guaranteed the lives and property of the townspeople and the evacuation of armed Irish troops who were defending them. The change in attitude on the part of the Parliamentarian commander may have been a recognition that excessive cruelty was prolonging Irish resistance. However, in the case of Drogheda and Wexford no surrender agreement had been negotiated, and by the rules of continental siege warfare prevalent in the mid-17th century, this meant no quarter would be given; thus it can be argued that Cromwell's attitude had not changed. Ormonde's Royalists still held most of Munster, but were outflanked by a mutiny of their own garrison in Cork. The British Protestant troops there had been fighting for the Parliament up to 1648 and resented fighting with the Confederates. Their mutiny handed Cork and most of Munster to Cromwell and they defeated the local Irish garrison at the Battle of Macroom. The Irish and Royalist forces retreated behind the River Shannon into Connacht or (in the case of the remaining Munster forces) into the fastness of County Kerry. The collapse of the Royalist alliance In May 1650, Charles II repudiated his father's (Charles I's) alliance with the Irish Confederates in preference for an alliance with the Scottish Covenanters (see Treaty of Breda). This totally undermined Ormonde's position as head of a Royalist coalition in Ireland. Cromwell published generous surrender terms for Protestant Royalists in Ireland and many of them either capitulated or went over to the Parliamentarian side. This left in the field only the remaining Irish Catholic armies and a few diehard English Royalists. From this point onwards, many Irish Catholics, including their bishops and clergy, questioned why they should accept Ormonde's leadership when his master, the King, had repudiated his alliance with them. Cromwell left Ireland in May 1650 to fight the Third English Civil War against the new Scottish-Royalist alliance. He passed his command onto Henry Ireton. Scarrifholis and the destruction of the Ulster Army The most formidable force left to the Irish and Royalists was the 6,000 strong army of Ulster, formerly commanded by Owen Roe O'Neill, who died in 1649. However the army was now commanded by an inexperienced Catholic bishop named Heber MacMahon. The Ulster Army met a Parliamentarian army, composed mainly of British settlers and commanded by Charles Coote, at the Battle of Scarrifholis in County Donegal in June 1650. The Ulster army was routed and as many as 2,000 of its men were killed.McKeiver, A New History of Cromwell's Irish Campaign, p.167. In addition, MacMahon and most of the Ulster Army's officers were either killed at the battle or captured and executed after it. This eliminated the last strong field army opposing the Parliamentarians in Ireland and secured for them the northern province of Ulster. Coote's army, despite suffering heavy losses at the Siege of Charlemont, the last Catholic stronghold in the north, was now free to march south and invade the west coast of Ireland. The Sieges of Limerick and Galway King John's Castle and Thomond Bridge, Limerick city. Ireton took Limerick in 1651 after a long siege The Parliamentarians crossed the River Shannon into the western province of Connacht in October 1650. An Irish army under Clanricarde had attempted to stop them but this was surprised and routed at the Battle of Meelick Island. Ormonde was discredited by the constant stream of defeats for the Irish and Royalist forces and no longer had the confidence of the men he commanded, particularly the Irish Confederates. He fled for France in December 1650 and was replaced by an Irish nobleman Ulick Burke of Clanricarde as commander. The Irish and Royalist forces were penned into the area west of the river Shannon and placed their last hope on defending the strongly walled cities of Limerick and Galway on Ireland's west coast. These cities had built extensive modern defences and could not be taken by a straightforward assault as at Drogheda or Wexford. Ireton besieged Limerick while Charles Coote surrounded Galway, but they were unable to take the strongly fortified cities and instead blockaded them until a combination of hunger and disease forced them to surrender. An Irish force from Kerry attempted to relieve Limerick from the south, but was intercepted and routed at the Battle of Knocknaclashy. Limerick fell in 1651 and Galway the following year. Disease however killed indiscriminately and Ireton, along with thousands of Parliamentarian troops, died of plague outside Limerick in 1651.Micheal O Siochru, God's Executioner, Oliver Cromwell and Conquest of Ireland, p.187. Guerrilla warfare, famine and plague The heavily fortified city of Galway in 1651. It was the last Irish stronghold to fall to the Parliamentarians, surrendering in 1652. The fall of Galway saw the end of organised resistance to the Cromwellian conquest, but fighting continued as small units of Irish troops launched guerrilla attacks on the Parliamentarians. The guerrilla phase of the war had been going since late 1650 and at the end of 1651, despite the defeat of the main Irish or Royalist forces, there were still estimated to be 30,000 men in arms against the Parliamentarians. Tories (from the Irish word tóraidhe meaning, \\"pursued man\\") operated from difficult terrain such as the Bog of Allen, the Wicklow Mountains and the drumlin country in the north midlands, and within months, made the countryside extremely dangerous for all except large parties of Parliamentarian troops. Ireton mounted a punitive expedition to the Wicklow mountains in 1650 to try to put down the tories there, but without success. By early 1651, it was reported that no English supply convoys were safe if they travelled more than two miles outside a military base. In response, the Parliamentarians destroyed food supplies and forcibly evicted civilians who were thought to be helping the Tories. John Hewson systematically destroyed food stocks in counties Wicklow and County Kildare, Hardress Waller did likewise in the Burren in County Clare, as did Colonel Cook in County Wexford. The result was famine throughout much of Ireland, aggravated by an outbreak of bubonic plague.Lenihan, p.122 As the guerrilla war ground on, the Parliamentarians, as of April 1651, designated areas such as County Wicklow and much of the south of the country as what would now be called free-fire zones, where anyone found would be, \\"taken slain and destroyed as enemies and their cattle and good shall be taken or spoiled as the goods of enemies\\".James Scott Wheeler, Cromwell in Ireland This tactic had succeeded in the Nine Years' War. This phase of the war was by far the most costly in terms of civilian loss of life. The combination of warfare, famine and plague caused a huge mortality among the Irish population. William Petty estimated (in the 1655–56 Down Survey) that the death toll of the wars in Ireland since 1641 was over 618,000 people, or about 40% of the country's pre-war population. Of these, he estimated that over 400,000 were Catholics, 167,000 killed directly by war or famine, and the remainder by war-related disease.. Scott Wheeler, Cromwell in Ireland. Modern estimates put the toll at closer to 20%. In addition, some fifty thousand Irish people, including prisoners of war, were sold as indentured labourers under the English Commonwealth regime. They were often sent to the English colonies in North America and the Caribbean where they subsequently comprised a substantial portion of certain Caribbean colony populations in the late 17th century. In Barbados, some of their descendants are known as Redlegs. Eventually, the guerrilla war was ended when the Parliamentarians published surrender terms in 1652 allowing Irish troops to go abroad to serve in foreign armies not at war with the Commonwealth of England. Most went to France or Spain. The largest Irish guerrilla forces under John Fitzpatrick (in Leinster, Edmund O'Dwyer (in Munster) and Edmund Daly (in Connacht) surrendered in 1652, under terms signed at Kilkenny in May of that year. However, up to 11,000 men, mostly in Ulster, were still thought to be in the field at the end of the year. The last Irish and Royalist forces (the remnants of the Confederate's Ulster Army, led by Philip O'Reilly) formally surrendered at Cloughoughter in County Cavan on 27 April 1653. However, low-level guerrilla warfare continued for the remainder of the decade and was accompanied by widespread lawlessness. Undoubtedly some of the tories were simple brigands, whereas others were politically motivated. The Cromwellians distinguished in their rewards for information or capture of outlaws between \\"private tories\\" and \\"public tories\\". The Cromwellian Settlement After Cromwell's victory, huge areas of land were confiscated and the Irish Catholics were banished to the lands of Connacht. Cromwell imposed an extremely harsh settlement on the Irish Catholic population. This was because of his deep religious antipathy to the Catholic religion and to punish Irish Catholics for the rebellion of 1641, in particular the massacres of Protestant settlers in Ulster. Also he needed to raise money to pay off his army and to repay the London merchants who had subsidised the war under the Adventurers Act back in 1640. Anyone implicated in the rebellion of 1641 was executed. Those who participated in Confederate Ireland had all their land confiscated and thousands were transported to the West Indies as indentured labourers. Those Catholic landowners who had not taken part in the wars still had their land confiscated, although they were entitled to claim land in Connacht as compensation. In addition, no Catholics were allowed to live in towns. Irish soldiers who had fought in the Confederate and Royalist armies left the country in large numbers to find service in the armies of France and Spain—William Petty estimated their number at 54,000 men. The practice of Catholicism was banned and bounties were offered for the capture of priests, who were executed when found. The Long Parliament had passed the Adventurers Act in 1640 (the act received royal assent in 1642), under which those who lent money to Parliament for the subjugation of Ireland would be paid in confiscated land in Ireland. In addition, Parliamentarian soldiers who served in Ireland were entitled to an allotment of confiscated land there, in lieu of their wages, which the Parliament was unable to pay in full. As a result, many thousands of New Model Army veterans were settled in Ireland. Moreover, the pre-war Protestant settlers greatly increased their ownership of land (see also: The Cromwellian Plantation). Before the wars, Irish Catholics had owned 60% of the land in Ireland, whereas by the time of the English Restoration, when compensations had been made to Catholic Royalists, they owned only 20% of it. During the Commonwealth period, Catholic landownership had fallen to 8%. Even after the Restoration of 1660, Catholics were barred from all public office, but not from the Irish Parliament.Lenihan, p. 111 Historical debate The Parliamentarian campaign in Ireland was the most ruthless of the Civil War period. In particular, Cromwell's actions at Drogheda and Wexford earned him a reputation for cruelty. However, pro-Cromwell accounts argue that Cromwell's actions in Ireland were not excessively cruel by the standards of the day. Cromwell himself argued that his severity when he was in Ireland applied only to \\"men in arms\\" who opposed him. Accounts of his massacres of civilians are still disputed. Cromwell's critics point to his response to a plea by Catholic Bishops to the Irish Catholic people to resist him in which he states that although his intention was not to \\"massacre, banish and destroy the Catholic inhabitants\\", if they did resist \\"I hope to be free from the misery and desolation, blood and ruin that shall befall them, and shall rejoice to exercise the utmost severity against them\\".The wording of this version is taken from a London edition, Thomas Carlyle notes that another contemporary version copied from the original Cork edition, ends with the phrase \\"and shall rejoice to act severity against them\\" and that he states \\"is probably the true reading\\" . It has also recently been argued, by Tom Reilly in Cromwell, an Honourable Enemy,Reilly, Dingle 1999 that what happened at Drogheda and Wexford was not unusually severe by the standards of 17th century siege warfare, in which the garrisons of towns taken by storm were routinely killed to discourage resistance in the future. John Morrill commented, \\"A major attempt at rehabilitation was attempted by Tom Reilly, Cromwell: An Honourable Enemy (London, 1999) but this has been largely rejected by other scholars.\\"John Morrill. \\"Rewriting Cromwell: A Case of Deafening Silences.\\" Canadian Journal of History. Dec 2003: 19. Morrill himself argued, that what happened at Drogheda, \\"was without straightforward parallel in 17th century British or Irish history... So the Drogheda massacre does stand out for its mercilessness, for its combination of ruthlessness and calculation, for its combination of hot- and cold-bloodiness\\".Morrill pp. 263–265 Moreover, historians critical of Cromwell point out that at the time the killings at Drogheda and Wexford were considered atrocities. They cite such sources as Edmund Ludlow, the Parliamentarian commander in Ireland after Ireton's death, who wrote that the tactics used by Cromwell at Drogheda showed \\"extraordinary severity\\". Cromwell's actions in Ireland occurred in the context of a mutually cruel war. In 1641–42 Irish insurgents in Ulster killed between 4,000 and 12,000 Protestant settlers who had settled on land where the former Catholic owners had been evicted to make way for them. These events were magnified in Protestant propaganda as an attempt by Irish Catholics to exterminate the English Protestant settlers in Ireland. In turn, this was used as justification by English Parliamentary and Scottish Covenant forces to take vengeance on the Irish Catholic population. A Parliamentary tract of 1655 argued that, \\"the whole Irish nation, consisting of gentry, clergy and commonality are engaged as one nation in this quarrel, to root out and extirpate all English Protestants from amongst them\\".Richard Lawrence, The Interest of England in Irish transplantation (1655), quoted in Lenihan, Confederate Catholics at War, p.111. Atrocities were subsequently committed by all sides. When Murrough O'Brien, the Earl of Inchiquin and Parliamentarian commander in Cork, took Cashel in 1647, he slaughtered the garrison and Catholic clergy there (including Theobald Stapleton), earning the nickname \\"Murrough of the Burnings\\". Inchiquin switched allegiances in 1648, becoming a commander of the Royalist forces. After such battles as Dungans Hill and Scarrifholis, English Parliamentarian forces executed thousands of their Irish Catholic prisoners. Similarly, when the Confederate Catholic general Thomas Preston took Maynooth in 1647, he hanged its Catholic defenders as apostates. Seen in this light, some have argued that the severe conduct of the Parliamentarian campaign of 1649–53 appears unexceptional.John Morrill. \\"Rewriting Cromwell: A Case of Deafening Silences.\\" Canadian Journal of History. December 2003: 19. Nevertheless, the 1649–53 campaign remains notorious in Irish popular memory as it was responsible for a huge death toll among the Irish population. The main reason for this was the counter-guerrilla tactics used by such commanders as Henry Ireton, John Hewson and Edmund Ludlow against the Catholic population from 1650, when large areas of the country still resisted the Parliamentary Army. These tactics included the wholesale burning of crops, forced population movement, and killing of civilians. Total excess deaths for the entire period of the Wars of the Three Kingdoms in Ireland was estimated by Sir William Petty, the 17th Century economist, to be 600,000 out of a total Irish population of 1,400,000 in 1641. One modern estimate estimated that at least 200,000 were killed out of a population of allegedly 2 million. In addition, the whole post-war Cromwellian settlement of Ireland has been characterised by historians such as Mark Levene and Alan Axelrod as ethnic cleansing, in that it sought to remove Irish Catholics from the eastern part of the country, others such as the historical writer Tim Pat Coogan have described the actions of Cromwell and his subordinates as genocide. * Albert Breton (Editor, 1995).

Most Irish remember him as the man responsible for the mass slaughter of civilians at Drogheda and Wexford and as the agent of the greatest episode of ethnic cleansing ever attempted in Western Europe as, within a decade, the percentage of land possessed by Catholics born in Ireland dropped from sixty to twenty. In a decade, the ownership of two-fifths of the land mass was transferred from several thousand Irish Catholic landowners to British Protestants. The gap between Irish and the English views of the seventeenth- century conquest remains unbridgeable and is governed by G. K. Chesterton's mirthless epigram of 1917, that 'it was a tragic necessity that the Irish should remember it; but it was far more tragic that the English forgot it'.\\" * James M.

The aftermath of the Cromwellian campaign and settlement saw extensive dispossession of landowners who were Catholic, and a huge drop in population. In the event, the much larger number of surviving poorer Catholics were not moved westwards; most of them had to fend for themselves by working for the new landowners. Long-term results The Cromwellian conquest completed the British colonisation of Ireland, which was merged into the Commonwealth of England, Scotland and Ireland in 1653–59. It destroyed the native Irish Catholic land-owning classes and replaced them with colonists with a British identity. The bitterness caused by the Cromwellian settlement was a powerful source of Irish nationalism from the 17th century onwards. After the Stuart Restoration in 1660, Charles II of England restored about a third of the confiscated land to the former landlords in the Act of Settlement 1662, but not all, as he needed political support from former parliamentarians in England. A generation later, during the Glorious Revolution, many of the Irish Catholic landed class tried to reverse the remaining Cromwellian settlement in the Williamite War in Ireland (1689–91), where they fought en masse for the Jacobites. They were defeated once again, and many lost land that had been regranted after 1662. As a result, Irish and English Catholics did not become full political citizens of the British state again until 1829 and were legally barred from buying valuable interests in land until the Papists Act 1778.

Early life Roy Plomley in the late 1930s presenting Radio Normandy Calling from the stage of the Hippodrome, Eastbourne. Plomley was born in Kingston upon Thames, Surrey, son of a pharmacist and was educated at King's College School, Wimbledon. On leaving school he worked first briefly for an estate agent, then for a London advertising agency, then in publishing. His original aim was to be an actor, and he did secure very minor parts in a number of films (e.g. To the Public Danger (1948), Double Confession (1950)), but he soon drifted into broadcasting, coming to public notice as an announcer, and later producer, for the International Broadcasting Company (IBC), starting on Radio Normandy in April 1936 and moving on at the end of that year to the IBC's Paris-based station, Poste Parisien. Between mid-1937 and late 1939 he was involved in writing and production, travelling back and forth between these two IBC stations in France and the company's offices and studios in London, while also presenting the variety programme Radio Normandy Calling, recorded on location in theatres at UK seaside resorts and regularly beating the BBC in audience ratings.Roy Plomley, Days Seemed Longer: Early Years of a Broadcaster, London, 1980, pp.107–159. World War II This part of his career came to an abrupt end when commercial broadcasting from the continent was brought to a halt by World War II. Plomley and his new wife stayed on in Paris, only narrowly escaping back to the UK via a circuitous route through the chaos and panic of the Fall of France, losing all their possessions in the process, as German occupying forces approached the French capital in June 1940.Plomley, op. cit., pp.183–199. Desert Island Discs In 1941, he devised the BBC Radio series Desert Island Discs. It was created on a cold November evening while Plomley was contemplating ideas and deciding whether to retire to bed or not. In the cottage he was living in at the time at Little Bushey Lane, Bushey, Hertfordshire, he wrote to Leslie Perowne, who was in charge of popular record programmes. He had a favourable reply and so, in his little back bedroom/study (still existing today) he set out his ideas with the names of personalities to be invited to participate. In those days of WWII every BBC Radio show was scripted by Plomley and submitted for censorship. In January 1942 the first of a series of eight weekly programmes was broadcast. Each show consisted of an interview with a celebrity, interspersed by the guest's choice of music. His contract was renewed for a further 15 shows. In the end he presented 1,791 editions of the programme stretching over 43 years. Its success was attributed to his skill as an interviewer and to his meticulous research.Richard Baker, \\"Plomley, (Francis) Roy (1914–1985)\\", Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004. Plomley was succeeded as presenter by Michael Parkinson (1985–1988), then by Sue Lawley (1988–2006), Kirsty Young (2006—2018) and most recently by Lauren Laverne. Desert Island Discs is the second longest-running radio programme in the world (after the Grand Ole Opry), and it is still running. Until late September 2009, unlike many other BBC radio programmes, Desert Island Discs was unavailable for Listen Again on the BBC website. This was because, when Roy Plomley devised the programme, he was a freelance producer, and it had been argued therefore, that the 'format rights' of the programme belonged to him rather than to the BBC. At his death, those 'rights' passed to his widow, and the BBC were subsequently unable to negotiate the right to include Desert Island Discs in their Listen Again offering. It was announced on 27 September 2009 that an agreement had been reached with the family as to payment of royalties and it would be available via iPlayer. Other work Plomley's grave at Putney Vale Cemetery, London in 2014 Plomley's broadcasting career was not restricted to Desert Island Discs; he also compiled and presented several feature programmes and was the chairman of BBC Radio's game show Many a Slip from 1964 to 1979, and a participant in such panel games as Does the Team Think?, also on BBC Radio. He also anchored Round Britain Quiz in 1961. For television he produced Dinner Date with Death in 1949, claimed to be the first UK film made for TV, and in the same year chaired We Beg to Differ on BBC Radio, transferring with it to BBC Television in 1951.\\"Roy Plomley, Creator of 'Desert Island Discs'\\" (obituary), The Times, London, 30 May 1985. He wrote the screenplay for the 1953 film The Blakes Slept Here and a number of plays including 'The First Time I Saw Paris', 'Moonlight Behind You', 'The Lively Oracles' (with John Allegro) and the comedies 'Round the Mulberry Bush', 'Everybody's Making Money - Except Shakespeare', 'Salad Days', 'The Galleon in the Garden', and 'Half Seas Over'. Plomley was awarded the OBE in 1975. He was Chairman of the Radio and Television Writers' Association from 1957 to 1959, and was voted BBC Radio Personality of the Year in 1979. He published 16 stage plays (one of which, Cold Turkey, was put on in the West End), and one novel.\\"Plomley, (Francis) Roy (died 1985)\\", Who Was Who, A&C; Black, London, January 2007.

Giovanni Palatucci (31 May 1909 – 10 February 1945) was an Italian police official who was long believed to have saved thousands of Jews in Fiume between 1939 and 1944 (current Rijeka in Croatia) from being deported to Nazi extermination camps. In 2013 a research panel of historians led by the Centro Primo Levi reviewed almost 700 documents and concluded that Palatucci had followed Italian Social Republic and German orders concerning the Jews and enabling the deportation of the majority of the 570 Jews living in Fiume and surrounding areas, 412 of whom were deported to Auschwitz, a higher percentage than in any Italian city.Patricia Cohen, He acted like a German to trick them and halp save the Jews. An Italian Saint in the Making or a Collaborator With Nazis, The New York Times, 19 June 2013 The matter is currently the topic of scholarly debate. A national commission of historians recommended by the Union of the Italian Jewish Communities, the Center for Contemporary Jewish Documentation in Milan, the Italian Ministry of the Interior and the Centro Primo Levi NY is conducting a comprehensive review of the documents. Biography Palatucci was born in Montella, Avellino, Italy. He graduated from the University of Turin, Faculty of Law in 1932. In 1936 he entered police service in Genoa and the following year he was assigned to Fiume. For 5 decades, Palatucci was believed to have been Fiume Chief of Police, and that he used his power to help the Jews until he got arrested. Even though already in 1994, historian Marco Coslovich published the documents showing that Palatucci never had more than a subordinate administrative role, in which he excelled and for which he was praised by his superiors, the misrepresentation of his position continued until the 2013, when the Holocaust Museum stated in its anniversary exhibition that Palatucci \\"used his power of Chief of Police to help the Jews\\". Palatucci, known as “the Italian Schindler,” has long been credited with saving thousands of Jews during the Holocaust while serving in the police department in the city of Fiume, and was designated by Yad Vashem as one of the Righteous Among the Nations. After the promulgation of racial laws against Jews in 1938 and at the beginning of World War II in 1939, Palatucci was chief of the Foreigners' Office. According to his hagiographers, he began falsifying documents and visas. The documentary report issued by Centro Primo Levi NY in 2013 demonstrates that no evidence nor testimony of such activity was ever found. Moreover, the report reviews in depth hundreds of police records preserved at the State Archive of Rijeka showing that one of Palatucci's main activities between 1938 and 1943 was the compilation and update of the census of the Jews. The census was the principal instrument in the application of the Racial Laws and in Fiume it was compiled and maintained with unparalleled thoroughness. Hagiographers also claim that when Palatucci \\"officially deported\\" Jews, he instead arranged for them to be sent to Campagna, telling them to contact his uncle, the Catholic Bishop of Campagna Giuseppe Maria Palatucci, who would offer them the greatest assistance possible.Tenembaum, Baruch. \\"Giovanni Palatucci, an Italian hero in the Holocaust\\" , The International Raoul Wallenberg Foundation. Already Marco Coslovich in 1994 had demonstrated through extensive documentation that Palatucci and the Police of Fiume had no power to decide internment location for the Jews. More recently the database of foreign Jews interned in Italy curated by Anna Pizzuti provided unequivocal evidence of the implausibility of this theory. As published in Pizzuti's documentary resource, the Jews deported from Fiume to Campagna are 40. Moreover, 10 of this allegedly \\"protected group\\" ended up in Auschwitz. Hagiographers also claim that he managed to destroy all documented records of some 10,000 Jewish refugees living in the town, issuing them false papers and providing them with funds. This theory has been questioned by several historians, including Marco Coslovich and Silva Bon. The latter, in her \\"The Jewish Communities of Fiume and the Carnaro\\" (Trieste, 2001) argued that, based on official records, the Germans and the RSI police conducted the arrests of the Jews through the lists of the Italian police. The arrests began in October 1943 and were organized first as round- ups and then as targeted operations in which the Italian Questura provided information to both locate and identify Fiume Jews. Both German and Italian records indicate that by June 1944 hardly any Jews had remained in Fiume. Moreover, if local records had been destroyed, something of which there is no sign, those refugees would still appear in the central police archive that kept copies of all local police headquarters as well as in the records of the Italian DP camps after the war, which is not the case. Following the 1943 capitulation of Italy, Fiume was occupied by Nazis. Purportedly, he continued to clandestinely help Jews and maintain contact with the Resistance, until his activities were discovered by the Gestapo. However, both German and Italian documents show that Palatucci was arrested for treason and for having transmitted to Britain official documents requesting negotiations for Fiume’s post-war status under Italian aegis.Alessandra Farkas, Shadows cast on the heroism of ‘Italian Schindler’, The Times of Israel, June 14, 2013 As the imminent defeat of the Axis became clear, many RSI officers began to negotiate with the Allies Italy's post war fate and their own. The tensions between the German and Italian RSI forces grew harsher. On the Eastern border, near Fiume, British support of Yugoslav resistance fighters grew stronger causing continuous attacks. Palatucci highest superior, to whom he reported, Tullio Tamburini was arrested in June for treason and embezzlement and deported to Dachau. After the liberation of Florence, in August 1944, Roberto Tomasselli, his direct superior and protector who had left him in his place, defected the ranks of Salò and ended up in an Anglo-American POW camp. His chief of cabinet and close collaborator in Fiume, left for Milan, where he served briefly Mussolini ailing administration and passed to the Liberation forces before the Allies entered the city. On 13 September 1944 Palatucci was arrested. Oral sources claim that he was condemned to death, but no documentary evidence of this fact ever emerged. Along with other Italian policemen from Fiume and Trieste who were also accused of treason and embezzlement, he was deported to the Dachau concentration camp, where he died during the epidemics of typhus on 9 February 1945, before the camp was liberated by the Allies on 29 April 1945. The Yad Vashem Holocaust Memorial honored him in 1990 as Righteous Among the Nations, for helping one Jewish woman. The Institute of the Righteous commission in 1990 found no evidence that he might have assisted anyone outside of this case. In October 2002, the Pope's vicar in Rome opened a beatification case for Palatucci, but in June 2013 the Vatican announced that it had asked a historian to review the new findings. Allegations of collaboration According to the 2013 research, the story surrounding Palatucci stemmed from the activity of Bishop Giuseppe Maria Palatucci and Rodolfo Grani, a Jewish man from Fiume who had briefly been interned in Campagna and remained friendly with the bishop after the war. As shown in the 2013 report, the main narrative of all rescue operations attributed to Palatucci can be found in a speech that the bishop delivered in Ramat Gan (Tel Aviv) on the occasion of a dead boy ceremony in honor of his nephew. According to the CPL report, there is no evidence that Grani, ever died, never returned to Fiume after 1940, ever met Giovanni Palatucci. Michael Day asked in The Independent newspaper how Palatucci helped \\"more than 5,000 Jews to escape in a region where officially, the Jewish population was half that\\". Anna Pizzuti, editor of the database of foreign Jewish internees in Italy, told Corriere Della Sera that it was impossible that Palatucci could have rerouted thousands of Jews to Campagna when \\"no more than 40 Fiume residents were interned in Campagna; and a third of these ended up in Auschwitz\\". The Giovanni Palatucci Foundation, which campaigns for Palatucci's beatification, criticized what it called \\"revisionist historians\\", and cites on its website individual cases where Jews claim relatives were saved by Palatucci’s direct intervention. It also said that critics who claim it is untenable to suggest he saved 5,000 Jews in an area with a Jewish population of just half that number, have failed to take into account the huge number of migrant Jews from eastern or central Europe who may have been present. However to date, all research concerning the influx of Jewish refugees through Italy's eastern border, including works by Klaus Voigt, Liliana Picciotto and Anna Pizzuti, concurs that very few refugees were able to pass through Fiume. The historian of Early Modern Europe Anna Foa of Sapienza University of Rome wrote in a June 2013 article for the Vatican newspaper L'Osservatore Romano that the decision to re-classify Palatucci, a Catholic, as a collaborator was hasty, bur conceded that more study was needed. She asserted that the target of the move against Palatucci was the papacy of Pope Pius XII, and wrote that \\"in targeting Palatucci the desire was essentially to hit a Catholic involved in rescuing Jews in support of the idea that the Church spared no effort to help the Jews — a person whose cause of beatification was under way. ... But this is ideology and not history.\\" Foa argued that \\"Palatucci may have saved only a few dozen lives instead of the 5,000 attributed to him\\". She agreed that Palatucci's achievements have at times been exaggerated based on the limited evidence, but noted that scholars should be cautious about jumping to conclusions given the paucity of evidence. Foa claimed that there are many testimonies in favor of Palatucci and concluded that before a definitive determination can be made about Palatucci's role in the Holocaust, the documentation used by the Primo Levi Center would have to be made available for other historians to review. The New York Times reported a reply from Centro Primo Levi's director, Natalia Indrimi, stating that the documents have been available to the scholarly community since the inception of the project, and that, if testimonies are available, they should be made public. Fr. Murray K.

The company was created to publish Empire Builder, a railroad game designed by Bromley and Bill Fawcett. In 1982, Mayfair Games expanded its focus to include Role Aids, a line of role-playing game supplements. In 1993, Mayfair was sued by TSR, Inc., who argued that Role Aids violated their 1984 trademark agreement, being advertised as compatible with Advanced Dungeons & Dragons. The court found that some of the line violated the trademark, but the line as a whole did not violate the agreement,TSR, Inc. v. Mayfair Games, Inc., 1993 WL 79272 (N.D. Ill.) and Mayfair continued publishing the line until the rights were bought by TSR. In 1996, Mayfair Games became the publisher of The Settlers of Catan in the US. The company shut down for financial reasons in 1997 but was subsequently bailed out by Iron Crown Enterprises (ICE), who purchased most of their assets and restarted operations as Ironwind, Inc.

The book is written in epistolary form (as a series of letters) and examines the limits of women's freedom in an aristocratic society. Although de Staël denied political intent, the book was controversial enough for Napoleon to exile the author. In this tragic novel, influenced by Johann Wolfgang von Goethe's The Sorrows of Young Werther and Jean-Jacques Rousseau's Julie, or the New Heloise, she reflects on the discussions on divorce in the National Assembly before the Concordat of 1801, when the laws were changed; the consequences after the Battle of Verdun (1792) leading to arrests and the September Massacres, the fate of the émigrés. The main characters have traits of Benjamin Constant and Talleyrand, and the liberalist view of the Italian politician Melzi d'Eril.From the Introduction to Madame de Staël (1987) Delphine. Edition critique par S. Balayé & L. Omacini. Librairie Droz S.A. Génève  Creation  In a literary and political essay called De la littérature dans ses rapports avec les institutions sociales published in 1800, Germaine de Staël wrote about the history of literature and its links with political contexts, and also advocated the ideas of the Age of Enlightenment, which did not please Napoleon. The emperor of the French was also afraid of de Staël's political relations, and suspected her to be an opponent. Delphine's publication in 1802 made things even worse: de Staël was exiled from Paris, and forbidden to get closer than 40 lieues from the city. When publishing Delphine, she claimed she was not interested in politics any more. Yet, this novel dedicated to \\"the silent France\\" (la France silencieuse) explicitly talks about such political and sociological subjects such as women's status, Protestantism, political liberalism, and emigration.Introduction to Madame de Staël (1987) Delphine. Edition critique par S. Balayé & L. Omacini. Librairie Droz S.A. Génève  Summary  The story takes place in Paris between 1789 and 1792 during the French Revolution. Delphine d'Albémar, a young widow, arranges a wedding between one of her distant relatives, Matilde de Vernon, and Léonce de Mondoville. But she falls in love with Léonce, and as he is engaged with Matilde, their love is impossible. The story ends tragically with Delphine committing suicide.  Main characters  * Delphine d'Albémar, the heroine, who gives her name to the novel. Formerly married to M. d'Albémar, she is now a widow ; she is rich, generous and smart and wishes to make her friends happy. This is why she arranges the wedding of Matilde de Vernon and Léonce de Mondoville. She claims that the duty to do what is right is more important to her than the judgement of others on her doings, but when she falls in love with Léonce, she gets torn between the two, and ends up killing herself. * Matilde de Vernon, a distant cousin and friend of Delphine. She is quite the opposite of Delphine, being discreet, bigot, but deeply in love with Léonce though she doesn't show it at first. * Madame de Vernon, Matilde's mother, a pleasant-looking woman, but who is actually sly and acts for her own interest only. However, her character can be explained by her loveless marriage with M. de Vernon.

Mercury  Colombo studied the planet Mercury, and it was his calculations which showed how to get a spacecraft into a solar orbit which would encounter Mercury multiple times, using a gravity assist maneuver with Venus. Due to this idea, NASA was able to have the Mariner 10 accomplish three fly-bys of Mercury instead of one. Mariner 10 was the first spacecraft to use gravity assist. Since then, the technique has become common. Colombo also explained the spin-orbit resonance in Mercury's orbit, showing that it rotates three times for every two orbits around the sun.

In surveying, a baseline is a line between two points on the earth's surface and the direction and distance between them. In a triangulation network, at least one baseline between two stations needs to be measured to calculate the size of the triangles by trigonometry. In the United States Public Land Survey System, a baseline is the principal east-west line (i.e., a parallel) upon which all rectangular surveys in a defined area are based. The baseline meets its corresponding principal meridian at the point of origin, or initial point, for the land survey. For example, the baseline for Nebraska and Kansas is shared as the border for both states, at the 40th parallel north. More specifically a baseline may be the line that divides a survey township between north and south. \\"Baseline Road\\" in the United States Many communities in the United States have roads that run along survey baselines, many of which are named to reflect that fact. Some examples: * In Little Rock, Arkansas, Baseline Road follows the baseline used by surveyors of the Louisiana Purchase. * In Colorado, Baseline Road in Boulder marks the 40th parallel, or the western extension of the Kansas-Nebraska boundary, which is also the boundary between Adams and Weld counties. * In Arizona, the baseline near the Phoenix metro area is marked by Baseline Road. * In Southern California, from Highland to San Dimas, the baseline is marked by Baseline Road. * In Michigan, the baseline for the Michigan Survey forms the boundary between the second and third tiers of counties and in many portions, discontinuous segments of road along the baseline are known as \\"Baseline Road.\\" 8 Mile Road in the Detroit area runs along the Michigan Baseline and was formerly known as \\"Baseline Road.\\" * Baseline Road in Hillsboro, Oregon, generally follows the Willamette Baseline which intersects the Willamette Meridian at the Willamette Stone State Park. Canada In Canadian land surveying, a base line is one of the many principal east-west lines that correspond to four tiers of townships (two tiers north and two south). The base lines are about apart, with the first base line at the 49th parallel, the western Canada–US border. It is, therefore equivalent to the standard parallel in the US system. Ontario In Ontario, a baseline forms a straight line parallel a geographical feature (mostly a lake, especially Lake Ontario or Lake Erie) that serves as a reference line for surveying a grid of property lots. The result of this surveying is the concession road and sideline system in use today. Many prominent Ontario baselines lie on the surveyed boundaries of land treaties signed with First Nations peoples. For example, several baselines in Waterloo Region and Brant County (including Wilmot Line, Brant-Oxford Road, and Indian Line) follow the borders of the Haldimant Tract land grant to the Six Nations confederacy, leading to the patchwork road and lot network, surveyed parallel to the western edge of the tract, which can seen in this area to this day. Jones Baseline which runs through Wellington County and Halton Region follows the original survey route marked by Augustus Jones after the Between the Lakes Purchase in 1792.

A first-time buyer is usually desirable to a seller as they do not have to sell a property, and as such will not involve a housing chain.First time buyers There are many factors a first-time buyer may need to consider before purchasing their first property; how much initial cash they will need for stamp duty and any solicitors fees, and if they need to arrange a mortgage how much are they able to afford. In many countries such as United Kingdom, Canada and Australia home ownership is seen as a natural step in the life cycle and the natural form of property tenure.Housing Policies for the New UKChapter on Housing Trends in Ireland Canada and Australia have some of the most ownership rate in word (all above 65%) home ownership. Ireland has one of the highest proportions of owner-occupiers in the EU at around 80%. In the UK in the 1980s almost half of all mortgages were taken out by first-time buyers, but this has now declined to only about 15%.. In Ireland, FTB's represent 34% of the market. In recent years the number of new buyers purchasing property has declined.Decline in number of first-time buyers In the 2007 Scottish parliamentary election the Scottish National Party proposed a £2,000 grant for first-time buyers to help them get onto the property ladder.Brown in economy clash with SNP Grants have not been forthcoming in the rest of the UK, but in July 2007 Housing Minister Yvette Cooper announced it would be broadening the government's Homebuy Shared Equity scheme to help buyers. \\"Unless we act now by 2026 first-time buyers will find average house prices are ten times their salary. That could lead to real social inequality and injustice,\\" Cooper told Parliament. Since then, first time buyers have regained momentum in the market, with reports in 2010 citing first-time buying as the most popular of consumer enquiries for a local, whole of market mortgage adviser - accounting for 37% of total enquiries.Consumers Seeking Pension Advice in July 2010 In 2016 the UK Government launched the Help to Buy ISA for first time buyers through incentivising them to use savings to fund a deposit on a property. The money saved is then boosted by 25% up to a maximum of £3000. In April 2017, the Lifetime ISA was launched. It was launched to replace the Help to Buy ISA (which was closed in Nov 2017).

From 1998 to 2005, he was the chancellor of the University of California, Irvine. From 2005 to 2016, he was the president of the National Academy of Sciences (NAS). He was a \\"renowned authority\\" on climate change and atmospheric chemistry, and issued an early warning about the grave potential risks of climate change. Early life and education Cicerone was born in New Castle, Pennsylvania, on May 2, 1943, to Salvatore and Louise (Palus) Cicerone. His father, an insurance salesman, was the son of Italian immigrants. Cicerone was the first in his family to attend college. He graduated from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1965 with a bachelor of science degree in electrical engineering. He was captain of MIT's varsity baseball team. After college, he obtained masters and doctoral degrees from the University of Illinois. Career Cicerone joined the University of Michigan as a research scientist, later holding faculty positions in electrical and computer engineering from 1971 to 1978. In 1978 he moved to the Scripps Institution of Oceanography at UC San Diego as a research chemist. He was appointed senior scientist and director of the Atmospheric Chemistry Division at the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colorado, in 1980. He held this position until 1989 when he joined the University of California, Irvine (UCI), as professor of earth system science (having founded the department) and chaired the Department of Earth System Science from 1989 to 1994, when he became Dean of Physical Sciences. Cicerone was recognized on the citation for the 1995 Nobel Prize in chemistry awarded to colleague F. Sherwood Rowland. In 1998 he became the fourth Chancellor of UCI. Ralph Cicerone held the position of Chancellor of UC Irvine until 2005, when he left to be President of the National Academy of Sciences. He retired as NAS President in June 2016. In 2001, while chancellor of UCI, Cicerone led an academy panel, commissioned by George W. Bush, tasked with reporting to him on climate change. The panel concluded unequivocally that \\"greenhouse gases are accumulating in Earth's atmosphere as a result of human activities, causing surface air temperatures and subsurface ocean temperatures to rise.\\" Cicerone was a member of the USA Science and Engineering Festival's Advisory Board, a Foreign Member of the Royal Society, Academia Sinica, the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, the American Philosophical Society, the Accademia Nazionale dei Lincei, the Russian Academy of Sciences, the Korean Academy of Science and Technology.He also served as president of the American Geophysical Union, the world's largest society of earth scientists. Honors, awards and legacy He was the 1999 laureate for the Bower Award and Prize for Achievement in Science. The American Geophysical Union awarded him its James B. Macelwane Award in 1979 for outstanding contributions to geophysics by a young scientists and later in 2002 its Roger Revelle Medal for outstanding research contributions to the understanding of Earth’s atmospheric processes, biogeochemical cycles, and other key elements of the climate system. The World Cultural Council honored him with the Albert Einstein World Award of Science in 2004. Cicerone revived the baseball program at UC Irvine in 2002, while he was its chancellor. The baseball field at UC Irvine's Anteater Ballpark was named after Cicerone in 2009. Ralph Cicerone and his wife Carol Cicerone endowed a graduate fellowship at UCI in 2009. Personal life Cicerone was married to Carol M. (Ogata) Cicerone (a professor of cognitive sciences at the UCI during the Cicerone's time at the university) and had a daughter and two grandchildren. He was an avid baseball fan who played varsity baseball during college at MIT. Cicerone died unexpectedly at his home in the Short Hills section of Millburn, New Jersey on November 5, 2016.

Drawing heavily on Froissart's Chronicles, Tuchman recounts the Hundred Years' War, the Black Plague, the Papal Schism, pillaging mercenaries, anti-Semitism, popular revolts including the Jacquerie in France, the liberation of Switzerland, the Battle of the Golden Spurs, and peasant uprisings. She also discusses the advance of the Islamic Ottoman Empire into Europe, ending in the disastrous Battle of Nicopolis. Yet Tuchman's scope is not limited to political and religious events. She begins with a discussion of the Little Ice Age, a change in climate that reduced the average temperature of Europe until the 18th century, and describes the lives of all social classes, from nobility and clergy to the peasantry. Much of the narrative is woven around the life of the French nobleman Enguerrand de Coucy. Tuchman chose him as a central figure partly because he lived a relatively long life and could therefore stay in the story during most of the 14th century. (Coucy was born in 1340, seven years before the Black Death began in southern Italy. He died in 1397.) He was also close to much of the action, tied to both France and England. (Coucy was a French noble but he married Isabella, the eldest daughter of Edward III of England.)  Critical reception  A Distant Mirror received much popular acclaim. A reviewer in the monthly history magazine History Today described it as an enthralling work full of \\"vivid pen-portraits.\\" In The Spectator, David Benson called it \\"an exciting and even bracing\\" book which did away with many sentimental myths about the Middle Ages. It also received a favorable review in the Los Angeles Times, though in the Saturday Review, Ted Morgan described it as a \\"noble failure.\\" However, scholarly reaction was muted. In the journal Speculum, Charles T. Wood praised Tuchman's narrative abilities but described the book as a \\"curiously dated and old-fashioned work\\" and criticized it for being shaped by the political concerns of the United States in the late 1960s and early 1970s. Bernard S. Bachrach criticized Tuchman's reliance on secondary sources and dated translations of medieval narratives at the expense of archival research, and characterized the book as a whole as \\"a readable fourteenth-century version of the Fuzz n' Wuz (cops and corpses) that dominates the evening news on television.\\" Thomas Ohlgren agreed with many of Bachrach's criticisms, and further took issue with many perceived anachronisms in Tuchman's characterization of the medieval world and a lack of scholarly rigor. William McNeill, writing in the Chicago Tribune, thought that A Distant Mirror, while well-written on a technical level, didn't present an intelligible picture of the period.

A. Gibbs, taken some time prior to 1902 James Edward Allen Gibbs (1829–1902) was a farmer, inventor, and businessman from Rockbridge County in the Shenandoah Valley in Virginia. On June 2, 1857, he was awarded a patent for the first twisted chain-stitch single-thread sewing machine using a rotating hook. In partnership with James Willcox, Gibbs became a principal in the Willcox & Gibbs Sewing Machine Company. Willcox & Gibbs commercial sewing machines are still made and used in the 21st century. The Willcox & Gibbs Sewing Machine Company started in 1857 by James E. A. Gibbs and James Willcox opened its London Office in 1859 at 135 Regent Street. By around 1871 the European offices were at 150 Cheapside, London and later 20 Fore Street, London. The company hired John Emory Powers for marketing its product. Powers pioneered the use of many new marketing techniques, including full-page ads in the form of a story or play, free trial uses of a product and installment purchasing plan. The marketing campaign created a demand for sewing machines in the Great Britain that Wilcox and Gibbs could not meet. The machine's circular design was so popular that it was produced well into the early 20th century, long after most machines were of the more conventional design. The machines shown employ the Gibbs rotary twisted chain stitch mechanism which was less prone to coming undone. Following his successful invention, he named his family's farm \\"Raphine.\\" The name originated from an old Greek word \\"raphis\\" which means \\"to sew.\\" The community of Raphine, Virginia, was named in his honor.

He is known mainly for his popular biographies; they made him the leading British biographer of his time, in terms of commercial success. Early life Pearson was born in Hawford, Claines, Worcestershire, to a family with a large number of members in Holy Orders. His parents were Thomas Henry Gibbons Pearson, a farmer, and the former Amy Mary Constance Biggs. He was a great-great-great nephew of the statistician and polymath Francis Galton, whom he described in Modern Men and Mummers. After the family moved to Bedford in 1896, he was educated there at Orkney House Preparatory School for five years, a period he later described as the only unhappy episode in his life, for the compulsive flogging beloved of its headmaster. At 14, he was sent to Bedford School, where he proved an indifferent student. Rebelling against his father's desire for him study Classics to prepare himself for a career in Holy Orders, on graduation, he entered commerce but happily accepted his dismissal as a troublemaker when he inherited £1,000 from a deceased aunt. He employed the funds to travel widely, and on his return joined his brother's car business. Author Conservative by temperament, he was a passionate reader of Shakespeare's plays and a frequent theatre-goer. When his brother's business faced bankruptcy, he applied for a job with Herbert Beerbohm Tree and began acting with that theatrical entrepreneur's company in 1911. A year later, he married Gladys Gardner, one of the company's actresses. At the outbreak of the First World War, Pearson enlisted immediately in the British Army but was soon invalided out when it was discovered that he suffered from tuberculosis. He volunteered for the Army Service Corps and was sent to Mesopotamia, whose climate was conducive to treatment for tuberculosis. He recovered from that malady there but contracted several other diseases, septic sores, dysentery and malaria and was close to death on three occasions. He attributed his survival to his practice of reciting long passages of Shakespeare while he was critically ill. He distinguished himself under fire and, on one occasion, received a severe head wound from shrapnel. He was subsequently awarded the Military Cross. After the war, Pearson returned to the stage and, in 1921, met Hugh Kingsmill, an encounter that, thanks to Kingsmill's charismatic friendship and influence, changed his life.Richard Ingrams, God's Apology,1977 chapter 3 In 1926 the anonymously-published Whispering Gallery, purporting to be diary pages from leading political figures, caused him to be prosecuted for attempted fraud. He won the case. He was a close friend and collaborator of Malcolm Muggeridge. Richard Ingrams's later biography of Muggeridge [Muggeridge: The Biography ] claimed that Pearson had an affair with Kitty Muggeridge in the early the 1940s, while her husband, Malcolm, was in Washington DC.

Cromwell's 8,000 men eventually took the town from its 2,000 Irish defenders, but not before they suffered losses of around 2,000 soldiers. Most were killed after being caught in a trap by Hugh Dubh (\\"Black Hugh\\") O'Neill on 17 May 1650. Background The garrison at Clonmel changed as the arrival of the Puritan army through Kilkenny became imminent. In November 1649, the town's Mayor John Bennet White wrote to the Duke of Ormond seeking military assistance. Colonel Oliver Stephenson and part of the old Confederate army, mostly from County Clare, took up quarters. The southern Confederates were not fully trusted by the townspeople, particularly after the fall of Carrick on Suir due to treachery. Ormond arrived in person at the end of the month and the Clare men were replaced by experienced soldiers from Ulster under O'Neill, a veteran of siege warfare in the Thirty Years' War. Under his command were 1,500 soldiers from the Irish Ulster army, mostly from the modern counties of Tyrone and Cavan. These two regiments had served under Owen Roe O'Neill and were now led by his nephew. They were accompanied by two troops of cavalry under Colonel Edmond Fennell of Ballygriffin, Co. Cork. O'Neill sent reinforcements to some outlying fortifications at Ballydine, Kilcash and 'Castle Caonagh' (Mountain Castle). Even before the siege commenced, provisioning the new influx was causing difficulties, Ormond proving unable to adequately supply them. As other walled towns in the vicinity capitulated with little resistance, tension in the town rose as evidenced by correspondence between O'Neill and Ormond. To which Ormond responded in the following terms : Cromwell was in a hurry to take the town as he had been summoned back to England by the English Parliament to deal with a Royalist uprising there. As a result, he tried to take Clonmel immediately by assault, rather than opt for a lengthy siege. The assault Cromwell's artillery, positioned on a hill near present-day Melview, battered a breach in the town walls. It was intended that his infantry would storm this breach and then open the nearby North town gate to allow access to Cromwell and the Parliamentarian cavalry. However, O'Neill put all able-bodied townspeople to work building a coupure inside the breach lined with artillery, muskets, and pikemen. The coupure was V-shaped, starting at the mouth of the breach and narrowing until it ended about 50 metres inside the town. At the end of the breach, O'Neill positioned two cannon, loaded with chain-shot. The area behind the breach became, in military terms, a \\"killing field\\". The Parliamentarian infantry which assaulted the breach was engaged by pikemen and repeatedly cut down by marksmen on the earthworks behind until the soldiers finally refused to make any further attacks on what was a death trap. Cromwell then appealed to his elite cavalry, the Ironsides to make a fresh assault on foot. This time the Irish allowed them to enter at first without resistance. A British officer of Sir John Clotworthy's regiment described the entry of the Ironsides into the town, the bulk of them belonging to Ireton's regiment. Cromwell was with a second assault force waiting for the town North (or Lough) gate to be opened by the party that had stormed the breach. When he saw that the initial assault had failed and that as night was approaching, even if the disheartened soldiers could be persuaded to enter the breach once more, he judged that it would be futile against the internal defences without artillery support so he decided to end the assault for the day. The town is surrendered Cromwell knew that O'Neill's garrison and supplies were severely depleted and planned the next morning to try a fresh assault with close artillery support to batter the coupure and its defenders. However, O'Neill's men were out of ammunition and slipped away under the cover of darkness – making their way to Waterford. Cromwell negotiated a surrender with the town's mayor, John White, believing that Clonmel was still heavily defended. The surrender terms stipulated that the lives and property of the townspeople would be respected. After agreeing to the surrender terms, Cromwell found out that O'Neill and the Confederates had slipped away and that he had been deceived. Although he was angry, Cromwell made his men abide by the terms of the surrender agreement and treat the townspeople and their property with respect. Aftermath After five weeks of close investment and nearly three months since the first elements of the New Model Army appeared before the town the New Model Army's losses were between 2,000 and 2,500, with hundreds more wounded, its largest ever loss in a single action.

It is about west of Fakenham in Norfolk, England. It forms part of the Defence Training Estate. The training area was the former Royal Air Force Station Sculthorpe, which closed circa 1992. The airfield has been home to many visiting airmen and support crews of the RAF and United States Air Force. In 1997, the Ministry of Defence sold the entire technical, domestic and administrative site including the married quarters site previously occupied by the USAF to the Welbeck Estate Group. After the sale the airfield was retained for military training usage. History=World War Two RAF Sculthorpe was built as the second satellite airfield of RAF West Raynham a few miles to the south, the first being RAF Great Massingham. Work was begun in the spring of 1942 and the airfield was laid out as one of only two RAF heavy bomber airfields (the other was the nearby RAF Marham) with the familiar wartime triangular three runway layout expanded by 50 percent, the main runway being 9,000 feet long compared to the standard 6,000 and the subsidiary runways being 6,000 feet compared to around 4,000. The work involved construction of the concrete runways, dispersals site, mess facilities and accommodation. Much of the work was completed by Irish labour working for the construction company Bovis. As work was drawing to a close in May 1943 the first squadrons started to arrive. The first was 342 (Lorraine) Squadron of the Free French Air Force within 2 Group from RAF West Raynham. This squadron operated two flights of the Douglas Boston aircraft along with some Douglas A-20 Havoc aircraft for training. No. 342 Squadron stayed until 19 July 1943 when they moved to RAF Great Massingham. On 20 July 1943 the Royal New Zealand Air Force and Royal Australian Air Force moved in with No. 487 Squadron RNZAF and No. 464 Squadron RAAF taking up residence with their Lockheed Ventura aircraft having moved from RAF Methwold before converting at Sculthorpe onto the de Havilland Mosquito. On 20 September 1943, 21 Squadron moved in from RAF Oulton, also with Mosquitos to form the Sculthorpe Wing (No. 140 Wing RAF). The wing stayed at Sculthorpe, completing more than 100 missions, before departing for RAF Hunsdon on 31 December 1943. In January 1944 100 Group Royal Air Force No. 214 Squadron RAF moved in with Boeing Flying Fortress aircraft for use in electronic warfare support of Bomber Command to be joined by crews from the USAAF 96th Bomb Group from RAF Snetterton Heath, known at Sculthorpe and thereafter as the 803rd Bomb Squadron of the USAAF. In April 1944 the 803rd and 214 Squadron departed for RAF Oulton leaving Sculthorpe empty for its redevelopment as a \\"very heavy bomber base\\" with the work not being completed until the spring of 1946. A number of units were also posted here: * No. 11 Heavy Glider Maintenance Section * No. 140 Airfield * No. 1699 (Fortress Training) Flight RAF * Mosquito Conversion Flight RAF Cold War 125px Douglas B-66B-DL Destroyer Serial 55-0309 of the 84th Bomb Squadron. KB-50J of the 420th Air Refueling Squadron refueling 2 Republic F-105D's from the 36th TFW, Bitburg AB West Germany. Sculthorpe was refurbished for USAF use during the Berlin Crisis in 1949 and then later, in 1952, it became home for the 49th Air Division (Operational) and the 47th Bombardment Wing, who were to stay for a decade. The 49th Air Division maintained operational control of the 47th Bomb WG and the 20th Fighter-Bomber Wing which provided tactical nuclear weapons support to the Supreme Allied Commander Europe (SACEUR). Later the 81st Fighter-Bomber Wing was provided a nuclear capability and assigned to the operational control of the 49th Air Division. The Soviet Union's enormous conventional force in eastern Europe posed a major problem for NATO due to the Soviets maintaining high personnel levels after World War II when most of the American and British forces had demobilized. To counter this Soviet threat to Western Europe, NATO decided to expand their tactical nuclear force by introducing the North American B-45 Tornado to the UK. The US Tactical Air Command had about 100 of these four-engine jet bombers, each capable of dropping five tactical nuclear bombs. In the summer of 1952, the Pentagon decided to deploy the 47th Bomb Wing to Sculthorpe from Langley Air Force Base, Virginia. The movement of the 49th AD, 47 Bomb Wg and the 20th FB WG was the first unit deployment since World War II. The squadrons of the 47th Bomb WG were: * 84th Bombardment Squadron (B-45, B-66) (17 November 1952 – 22 June 1962) * 85th Bombardment Squadron (B-45, B-66) (17 November 1952 – 22 June 1962) * 420th Air Refueling Squadron (KB-29, KB-50) (25 September 1955 – 23 March 1962) * 86th Bombardment Squadron (B-45, B-66) (23 March 1954 – 22 June 1962) * 19th Tactical Reconnaissance Squadron (RB-45C) (7 May 1954 – 1 December 1958) Due to a shortage of space at Sculthorpe, the 86th BS operated from RAF Alconbury as a detachment of the 47th. In addition to the B-45 squadrons at Sculthorpe, the 47th's sister wing, the 20th Fighter-Bomber Wing with the nuclear capable North American F-84G \\"Thunderjet\\" were transferred to RAF Wethersfield in Essex. From 1954 to 1958, the 19th Tactical Reconnaissance Squadron also flew the reconnaissance version of the B-45 known as the RB-45. The 19th TRS was assigned to the 47th Bomb Wing from May 1954 to December 1958. When the 19th began to re-equip with RB-66's in 1957, its RB-45's were transferred to other squadrons of the 47th Bomb Wing. By 1957, hosting 10,000 personnel it was the biggest USAFE base in Europe. In May 1958, the re-equipping of the 47th Bombardment Wing began and Douglas B-66 Destroyers began to replace the B-45s. With this equipment change, the 47th's squadrons were redesignated Bombardment Squadron (Tactical). right During 1960-1962 the 47th performed air refueling missions assigning KB-50J tankers to the 420th Air Refueling Squadron from 15 March 1960 to 22 June 1962. The KB-50s were specially equipped with two General Electric J47 turbojet engines that enabled the tankers to match the speed of the faster jet fighters during refueling; however most of the KB-50s were more than fifteen years old and were too slow to refuel the faster tactical jets of USAFE. The 420th ARS was inactivated on 25 March 1964. In 1962 Project Clearwater halted large scale rotational bomber deployments to Britain with Sculthorpe, along with RAF Fairford, RAF Chelveston, and RAF Greenham Common, being turned over to USAFE for tactical air use. As a result, the 47th Bomb Wing was inactivated on 22 June 1962. A number of the aircraft were reassigned to the 42nd TRS, 10th Tactical Reconnaissance Wing at RAF Chelveston and modified with the electronic counter-measures tail system. With the inactivation of the 47th, Sculthorpe was put under the command of the 7375th Combat Support Group, the 7375th was later replaced by the Detachment 1, 48th Tactical Fighter Wing. In 1979 Handley Page Victor aerial tankers from 55 & 57 Squadrons and Canberra target towing aircraft of 100 Squadron operated from Sculthorpe when the runway at RAF Marham was re-surfaced. In spring 1982 units from RAF Coltishall moved to Sculthorpe while the Coltishall runway was resurfaced. During the spring and summer of 1983, units of the 48th Tactical Fighter Wing deployed to RAF Sculthorpe because their home station, RAF Lakenheath was having its runway resurfaced. During the summer of 1984 the F-4E and F-4G squadrons from Spangdahlem Air Base, West Germany, operated from RAF Sculthorpe to allow runway re-surfacing at Spangdahlen to take place. During most of 1988 and part of 1989, deploying C-130 units from the 463rd TAW (Dyess AFB, Texas), the 314th TAW (Little Rock AFB, Arkansas), and the 317th TAW (Pope AFB, North Carolina) were forced to operate from RAF Sculthorpe due to runway resurfacing at RAF Mildenhall. In August 1989 the TR-1A squadron from RAF Alconbury operated from RAF Sculthorpe whilst Alconbury's runway was re-surfaced. The airfield became inactive at the end of the Cold War; an end- of-use date of 2 October 1992 is quoted.  Post RAF use  The airfield, now known as the Sculthorpe Training Area, is retained by the Ministry of Defence and forms part of the Defence Training Estate. During 2016, it was used by the USAF 352nd SOG, based at RAF Mildenhall, to perform training in low flying, airdrops, and rescue and recovery missions. These exercises were conducted by MC-130 Hercules and CV-22 Ospreys. During the mid-1990s the entire technical and domestic site was sold to Roger Byron-Collins' Welbeck Estate Group by Defence Estates. The domestic married quarters site included a number of single storey \\"tobacco houses\\". The housing estate was renamed \\"Wicken Village\\" and, after refurbishment, the houses were sold. The remaining technical site including barrack blocks, post exchange (PX), church, guardroom, gymnasium, community centres, and extensive storage and industrial units were sold to a single purchaser and there is now a fledgling industrial park. The Welbeck Estate Group went on to acquire the nearby technical and married quarters estate at RAF West Raynham. The only military buildings that remain are the control tower, the fire station (next to the control tower), and a small half-moon concrete shelter, now used by a farmer for machinery and equipment storage. RAF Sculthorpe Heritage Centre opened in a room at Green Park Rural Centre, Wicken Green, in August 2019. It features many Sculthorpe- related items, and has parts of a RB-66 Destroyer including its J71 jet engine which is the only known surviving example in the country.

The new settlement is being developed 16 km from Dublin city centre, on a 220 hectare site just south of Lucan, west of the Griffeen River and north of the Grand Canal. No date has been set for the official granting of any specific official status but development is underway since 2005. As of 2017, perhaps 3,500 of a planned population of 25,000 were resident. Adamstown is in the jurisdiction of South Dublin. Location and access Adamstown railway station, 2008 Adamstown is beside the Dublin- Kildare railway line The new and privately funded railway station opened on 10 April 2007, provisioned with 5 platforms. The settlement is beside the N4 national primary route. Weston Airport is nearby. History Adamstown originated with the South Dublin County Development Plan of 1998, which envisaged the creation of several \\"new towns\\" - only Adamstown made it to the development stage. The provision of a new railway station was an integral part of its development, together with the provision of new schools, shopping and sporting facilities within walking distance in the neighbourhood. The new settlement was designed to promote public transport and reduce car dependence. Infrastructure works officially commenced on 7 February 2005, and on 16 February 2006 the first houses went on the market. Plans It was intended that after an initial ten years of development the development would have around 10,000 homes, and about 25,000 people. To date around 1,200 homes have been constructed. The homes built in Adamstown were to be familiar types of house and apartment block but with a layout dissimilar to other later 20th century developments in Ireland in that they were to incorporate modern urban design concepts. These primarily include permeability, and a 'joined up' street system, avoiding the common cul de sac layouts. The formation of streets is designed to reduce car usage. These features, combined with ease of access to the train station is intended to promote walking and cycling. There is a strict limit on high-rise buildings, three to four storeys being the norm. Development slowed after the initial phases were complete, and parts of the proposed settlement remain boarded off. The train station and two schools, and a few retail facilities, are now operating.  Amenities The area features a Liffey tributary stream, the Tobermaclugg, which is planned to be used as the centrepiece of a public park. Adamstown's first neighbourhood shopping centre including a Londis small supermarket, a hair and beauty salon, and a cafe / pizzeria is open in the Sentinel Building. Nearby are a Supervalu shopping centre on the Newcastle Road and a short distance further is Lucan village. Some distance away is Liffey Valley shopping centre. Education There are two primary schools, a large secondary school and a crèche. The local secondary school, Adamstown Community College, opened in September 2009.http://adamstowncc.ie/ From sixty nine students entering the school it now has over a thousand students attending there. The school crest, of a castle, originates from an old castle that use to stand where the current school stands today. The secondary school is operated by County of Dublin VEC. The first two primary schools, Adamstown Educate Together and St. John the Evangelist, Adamstown, commenced classes in September 2007. Sport Adamstown has a soccer club, Adamstown Football Club, and a GAA club, Adamstown GAA club for both girls and boys, hurling, and camogie clubs. Adamstown Football Club was established in November 2005 and plays in the United Churches League, with two teams (as of 2008). The GAA club was authorised on 11 June 2007 at a meeting of the Dublin County Board. A new structure, Club Adamstown, is being put in place by the local council to offer sporting opportunities, including cricket, to local children.  Awards  Obelisk installed in 2009 during the formal launch  Sustainable Communities Award 2009  In February 2009, Adamstown, the new neighbourhood being built on the west side of Dublin, won a \\"Sustainable Communities\\" award from the UK's Royal Town Planning Institute. It was the only non-UK project to pick up a prize at the annual awards ceremony, and was entered by South Dublin County Council and Chartridge, the developers (comprising Castlethorn Construction, Maplewood Homes and Tierra Construction). The award recognises that Adamstown has been properly planned and balances living accommodation with infrastructure, such as shops, cinema, train station, swimming pool, library, health centres, restaurants, schools, mixed places of worship and parks, among other facilities. Adamstown is Ireland's first Strategic Development Zone, which means that the construction of homes runs in tandem with such facilities. The judges praised the design and layout of Adamstown for its \\"modern vernacular\\" and said it would be a \\"model for development elsewhere\\".

It can refer to either a specific group of people with historical claims to a district, or more broadly the Māori people as a whole. Etymology According to Williams' definitive Dictionary of the Māori Language, tangata means \\"man\\" or \\"human being\\", whilst tāngata (with the macronated \\"ā\\") is the plural, and means \\"people\\". Tangata—without the macron—can also mean \\"people\\" in reference to a group with a singular identity. Whenua means both \\"land\\" and \\"placenta\\" (again referencing Williams, who lists five definitions). It is an ancient Austronesian word with cognates across the Malayo-Polynesian world, from Malay benua, Visayan *banwa and to Rapa Nui henua. Unlike European thought, wherein people own land, in the Māori worldview the land is regarded as a mother to the people. The relationship to land is not dissimilar to that of the foetus to the placenta. In addition, there are certain Māori rituals involving burying the afterbirth of a newborn in ancestral land, which may further illustrate the word whenua meaning both \\"land\\" and \\"placenta\\". Contexts * In the context of tribal descent and ownership of land, tangata whenua are the people who descend from the first people to settle the land of the district; the mana may reside with later arrivals. * At a particular marae, the tangata whenua are the owners of the marae, in contradistinction to the manuhiri (guests). After the welcoming ceremony on a marae, the guests may be afforded the temporary, honorary status of tangata whenua, and may even be invited to participate as locals as the ceremonies continue. * Tangata whenua has also become a New Zealand English term with specific legal status. Law and custom The indigenous peoples of New Zealand may be divided into three levels of kinship, on which traditional governance was based.  Whānau  The smallest level, whānau, is what Westerners would consider the extended family, perhaps descended from a common great-grandparent. Traditionally a whānau would hold in common their food store (their forest or bush for hunting birds and gathering or growing plant foods, and a part of the sea, a river or a lake for gathering eels, fish, shellfish, and other seafood). These food stores were fiercely protected: when one's resources could no longer support a growing whānau, war with a neighbouring tribe might eventuate.  Hapū  The next level, hapū (sub- tribe), is a group of several related whānau, and was traditionally the primary governance unit. In war, and when decisions needed to be made in negotiations with outside tribes, whānau leaders would gather and the hapū would make collective decisions.  Iwi  Several (or many) hapū can trace their ancestry, usually on the male line, back to a particular waka, the ocean-going canoe upon which the common ancestors of that tribe arrived in Aotearoa New Zealand, and this unified level is called the iwi. Until the British arrived, the iwi was not a governance unit, but was, among other things, a way to establish kinship and commonality—a kind of \\"who's who\\". For example, it is part of the formal greeting ceremony of \\"pōwhiri\\" when one group visits another. However, under British and subsequent New Zealand law, typically an iwi forms itself into a legally recognised entity, and under the Treaty of Waitangi these entities are accorded special rights and obligations under New Zealand law, when they are recognised as tangata whenua. Iwi must have a provable relationship with a specific area of geography, and if this is acknowledged by the national or local authority, they become the legal tangata whenua. (Some areas may have several groups given tangata whenua status, which can make the process more complex). When, for example, a major real-estate development is proposed to the territorial authority, the tangata whenua must be consulted, although the mere fact that \\"consultation\\" take place does not mean that the views of the tangata whenua will necessarily be listened to. When bones are found, the tangata whenua are supposed to be called. In addition to these sorts of legally mandated requirements, when a person wishes to have land blessed, or when a sudden death occurs, an elder (kaumātua or tohunga) of the tangata whenua may be asked to perform a cleansing ritual. Tangata tiriti The notion of tangata whenua is sometimes contrasted with tangata tiriti—literally, \\"the people of the Treaty\\". The latter term refers to non-indigenous New Zealanders who are in the country by virtue of the Treaty of Waitangi. Although some see it as close to (but not necessarily synonymous with) the term pākehā, the peoples who have arrived through the auspices of the monarchs of Great Britain and then of New Zealand range in ethnicity, ancestry and roots from most parts of the world including the continents of Europe, Asia, Africa and the Americas, as well as many islands in the Pacific. As used notably by Judge Eddie Durie, the notion of tangata tiriti underlines partnership and acceptance.Michael King, The Penguin History of New Zealand, 2003, , p.167 Unlike tangata whenua, the term tangata tiriti has not yet achieved common use in New Zealand.

It is commonly served with a wedge of lime or lemon in the neck of the bottle to add tartness and flavour. It is one of the top-selling beers worldwide, and Corona Extra has been the top-selling imported drink in the U.S. since 1998.  Ingredients  Mexican Corona truck According to Sinebrychoff, a Finnish company owned by the Carlsberg Group, Corona Extra contains barley malt, corn, hops, yeast, antioxidants (ascorbic acid), and propylene glycol alginate as a stabilizer. Propylene glycol alginate is a synthetic, colorless, odorless, tasteless liquid that belongs to the same chemical class as alcohol. Packaging Corona beer is available in a variety of bottled presentations, ranging from the ampolleta (labeled Coronita and just referred as the cuartito) up to the Corona Familiar (known as the familiar, Litro or Mega). A draught version also exists, as does canned Corona in some markets. In Spain, the beer is branded as (literally, 'little crown'), as renowned winemaker Bodegas Torres has owned the trademark for \\"Coronas\\" since 1907. The packaging is otherwise unchanged. In the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, and the US, smaller, 210ml (7 fl. oz) bottles of the beer are also branded as \\"Coronita\\". Sponsorship partners cl = bottle and carton that is marked 6 × 0.33 L (partially visible). This bottle features eight languages for export to the Common Market. Corona was a longtime sponsor of boxing in Mexico, including sponsorship of Saturday night fights on Televisa, but reduced its sponsorship after Anheuser-Busch InBev took full control of the brand. In the United States, Constellation Brands continues to sponsor boxing through Corona, most notably with undefeated featherweight champion Floyd Mayweather Jr. Corona was the title sponsor of the LPGA Tour tournament Corona Championship (later Tres Marias Championship) from 2005 to 2009, and of the NASCAR Mexico Corona Series (now NASCAR PEAK Mexico Series) from 2004 to 2011, the most followed stock car racing series in Mexico. In addition, Corona is a \\"second sponsor\\" for four of the top-flight professional football teams of Mexico's first division, Liga MX. The teams sponsored by Corona are Atlas, Santos Laguna, Querétaro, Puebla, Chiapas, América, Pachuca, Morelia, León, Toluca, and Necaxa. Corona also sponsored the Mexico national football team. Corona and the ATP had a 5½ year sponsorship in which Corona was the ATP's premier worldwide sponsor. Corona was also the title sponsor of the SBK Superbike World Championship from 1998 until 2007. Use in cocktails Some bars and restaurants serve a \\"Coronarita\\", a beer cocktail that consists of a bottle of Corona upturned to drain into a margarita. Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic Corona bottle with a lime slice As of February 2020, after the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, Corona suffered a $170 million loss in earnings in the virus' origin country of China. The company attributed the sales drop to fewer people going out in public, with many bars and restaurants being forced to close down. Multiple brands of beer experienced relative sales slumps in the country, as the spread of COVID-19 had generally dampened public activities. Sales were typically high over the period due to Chinese New Year celebrations. However, Constellation Brands reported a 5% increase in sales of Corona Extra in the U.S. in the four weeks ending February 16, though the company's new hard seltzer had to stop promotion because its ads were perceived as being in \\"poor taste\\". CNN reported that a survey by 5W Public Relations said that 38% of Americans would not buy Corona \\"under any circumstances\\" because of the outbreak, and another 14% said they would not order a Corona in public. The survey of 737 American beer drinkers over the age of 21 was conducted via phone on February 25 and 26, 2020. The PR firm's news release said the survey was done \\"regarding their opinions about the popular Mexican beer brand, Corona, as a result of the deadly COVID-19 coronavirus that's spreading around the world\\". The company did not publish detailed methodological data. The question responsible for the 38% statistic did not explicitly mention COVID-19 as a motivation, which might have instead simply indicated a preference for a different brand of beer. Among regular Corona drinkers, only 4% said they planned to stop drinking the brand. Grupo Modelo announced on Twitter that it would stop producing Corona beer during a shutdown of non-essential businesses lasting from March 30 to April 30 by the Mexican government due to COVID-19.

It is organised by the Defence Exhibition Organisation, Ministry of Defence. Organisers The Defence Ministry of India, Indian Air Force, Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO), Department of Space, the Union Civil Aviation Ministry and other such organisations join hands to organise the Aero India show, making it the largest air show in Asia. Air shows The first edition of the air show was held in 1996. During this Aero India Show, many manufacturers and service providers from the Indian aerospace and aviation industry meet the potential buyers of their products. After 1996, the 4th edition of the air show took place in 2003. About 176 exhibitors from 22 countries all over the world came to grace the show. In the year 2005, more than 380 participants came to the Aero India show's 5th edition. In this show, many military and civil aircraft as well as aerospace products were displayed. The 2007 Aero India show was held at Yelahanka Air Force Station in Bangalore in Karnataka. The 7th edition was held from 11 to 15 February 2009, and included 592 exhibitors from over 25 countries. The eighth edition started on 9 February 2011. In recent years, the Aero India has emerged as one of the world's most important and largest military aviation exhibitions. The Mikoyan MiG-35 and F-16IN Super Viper were unveiled for the first time at the 6th and 7th editions of Aero India respectively. 1st edition (1996)  The first edition of Aero India was held in 1996. Since then, the event has gradually earned international recognition, and has seen increased participation from exhibitors since then.  2nd edition (1998)  The second edition started on 8 December 1998 at the Yelahanka Air Force Base. It was inaugurated by George Fernandes, India's Defence Minister. It included fly pasts by three Jaguars, three MiG-23s, three HAL Tejas, 9 HAL Kiran aircraft of the Surya Kiran aerobatic team, Hawk 200, Mirage 2000 and the Sukhoi Su-30MKIs. this was followed by sky diving display by nine sky divers of the Akash Ganga team. The exhibition stalls included displays by Boeing, Allied Signal, Bell Textron, Airbus Industries, Aerospatiale, Dassault, British Aerospace, HAL, DRDO, ADA, BEL and NAL. The French and Russian presence was especially strong, and the highlights were the detailed models of all Boeing commercial aircraft starting from Boeing 717 to Boeing 777.  3rd edition (2001)  Bangalore's third air show opened at the Yelahanka AF Base on 7 February 2001.  4th edition (2003)  176 companies from 22 countries participated in the 4th edition of the event from 5 to 9 February 2003 in Yelahanka at the outskirts of Bangalore. It was inaugurated by the then Defence Minister of India (seen in the first thumb of a photograph), George Fernandes. About 50 delegations from the United States, Europe, Russia, the Middle East, Asia-Pacific and Africa visited Bangalore for the event. The French delegation was led by the Prime Minister of France, Jean-Pierre Raffarin. A pair of HAL Dhruv performed their first display, and a composite formation was flown which was led by the Dhruv, followed by a pair of Kiran, Mirage 2000 and Sukhoi Su-30s.  5th edition (2005)  The 5th Aero India 2005, the biennial air-show-cum-defence exhibitions, was held at the Yelahanka Air Force Base in Bangalore from 9–13 February 2005. The Aero India 2005 attracted record 380 exhibitors from the world's leading industries in the field of civil and military aviation, aerospace and airfield upgrade. The show included both air displays as well as static exhibitions of military and civil aircraft. A total of 80 aircraft including Fighters, Light Combat Aircraft, Advanced Light Helicopters, Intermediate Jet Trainers (AJTs), Maritime Surveillance Aircraft and Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) displayed their flying skills and capability during the Aero India 2005 show. The Indian Air Force (IAF) and the Indian Navy also displayed their various aircraft. There were 32 official military delegations and over 250,000 people enjoyed the Aero India 2005 show, which is considered Asia's premier air show. The major attractions of Aero India 2005 were the leading fighter, advanced jet trainers and unmanned aerial vehicles from Russia, US, France, Britain, Israeli and India who took part in the flying as well as static displays at the show. The visitors enjoyed the spectacular flying performances and static exhibitions of the Russian MiG-29K, Su-30MKI and Il-78 tanker; the American F-15E, C-130J Super Hercules and P-3C Orion aircraft; the French vintage Mirage 2000 and Falcon 2000; the British Hawk 100, Jaguar and Sea Harriers, and the Indian Dhruv (Advanced Light Helicopter) and Intermediate Jet Trainer (IJT) and the Swedish Saab JAS 39 Gripen. The colourful aerobatics performance by Sarang- the Indian Air Force's Advanced Light Helicopters, made everyone spell bound during the inaugural function. Other major attractions in Aero India 2005 were the unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). The Israel's Orbiter and SkyLite mini UAV impressed their visitors with beautiful look and features. The lightweight Orbiter just weighs 4.5 kg features an advanced data link system transmitting all the data and video in real time. The SkyLite mini is capable of making vertical flights from the canister, and can be launched even from narrow alleys. The U.S. maritime surveillance aircraft P-3C Orion and C-130J Super Hercules transport aircraft attracted the attention of visitors. The P-3C Orion is generally used in anti- submarine and anti-ship warfare, over-water and over-land surveillance missions, and network-centric warfare missions. The U.S. Hawkeye 2000, known for its airborne early warning and battle management command and control system, was another attraction in the Aero India 2005 show. Aero India 2005 also proved good for passenger aircraft manufacturers, as number of inquiries, especially for the smaller and low-cost aircraft were made during the show. Visitors also had a chance to get a glimpse of advanced missile systems, avionics suites, radars, and simulators.  6th edition (2007)  This event was held from 7 February 2007 to 11 February 2007, at the Yelahanka Air Force Station. The attractions of the event were the Lockheed-Martin F-16, as well as the Boeing F/A-18E/F Super Hornet, all contenders for the Indian Air Force's 126 aircraft MRCA requirement. Also present were the Surya Kiran and Sarang acrobatic teams. The Surya Kiran team consists of nine Indian pilots, and have displayed skills by flying as close as 3–5 m at high speeds and have exhibited various formations like the arrow, diamond and concluding with the hearts. The Sarang team displays manoeuvres of Advanced Light Helicopter (ALH). During the rehearsals for the show, one of the Sarang helicopters crashed on 2 February 2007. The co-pilot was killed in the incident. However, the team performed the displays in the show. During the show, a HAL HJT-36 skidded off the runway when a tyre burst after the pilot aborted take-off as the aircraft's canopy inadvertently opened up. Fortunately, there was no fatality.  7th edition (2009)  The 7th edition of Aero India was held on 11–15 February 2009. 289 Indian firms and 303 foreign companies participated in one of the largest international aerospace exhibitions in Bangalore. Armament majors from several countries, including Australia, Brazil, Britain, Belgium, Canada, Czech Republic, France, Germany, Italy, Ireland, Israel, Malaysia, Norway, Poland, Romania, Russia, Singapore, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Netherlands, Ukraine and United States. There were also country pavilions from Australia, Belgium, Germany, Israel and Romania. This year also saw China participating for the first time in Aero India. The show was preceded by an international seminar (Aero India Seminar) on aerospace technologies and applications (9–11 February), hosted by Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO). Nearly 330 companies from 50 countries abroad and 230 from India set up exhibits. Some 30 military and civil aircraft gave flight demonstrations. The F-16, F-18, MiG-35D, Eurofighter, IJT, Dhruv, Hawk, C-17, Embraer 135 business jet Legacy 600, C-130J, Citation XLS, G 550, AN-12 Cargo and A-310 MRTT were on display. Some 70 more were on static display. Whose event manager will be the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII). Defense Minister A. K. Antony chaired the first meeting of the apex committee of the exhibition here Friday. \\"Addressing the top officials from several ministries and organisations, Antony said Aero India-2009 should be conducted in such a manner that it provides a benchmark for similar shows being organised in various parts of the world,\\" the official said. The Indian Air Force brought out some of the vintage aircraft from its stable and flew them. The defence ministry also facilitated interaction between the overseas original equipment manufacturers and Indian business houses. \\"Similar interactions will also be encouraged between small and medium enterprises from home and abroad. Efforts are also being made to give exposure to students of technical and engineering colleges to encourage them to be part of the country's aim of becoming a design hub in aerospace technologies in the foreseeable future,\\" the official added. The central government will spend nearly Rs. 200 million to augment the infrastructure in and around the Air Force Station Yelahanka.  8th edition (2011)  The 2011 edition of Aero India was held from 9 to 13 February in Bangalore. It was reported that the Chinese aircraft will not participate in this edition, due to rising trade competition between India and China. However these claims were false and China had its representatives present there. The highlight of the morning was the flight display in which several aircraft performed intricate manoeuvres. HAL Tejas, which flew in a formation in public view for the first time, was a key highlight, as it performed a vertical climb and then did a belly turn right in front of the podium. While five Jaguars flew in a V-formation, the Sukhoi Su-30MKI flew in a trident formation. Boeing's F/A-18 Super Hornet, the Saab Gripen and Dassault Rafale also performed loops, rolls, and somersaults in the air. The aerobatic team Surya Kiran did their last show with their Kiran aircraft which are planned to be replaced by new BAE Hawk aircraft. The aerobatic team of Czech Republic popularly known as Flying Bulls or Red Bull also performed for first time. Indian Aerospace Companies such as Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL), National Aerospace Laboratories, Mahindra Aerospace, Taneja Aerospace (TAAL) and Tata Aerospace also participated in the event.  9th edition (2013)  Aero India 2013 started on 6 February 2013 at the IAF's Yelahanka Air Force base, Bengaluru and ended on 10 February 2013. 607 companies attended the air show, with 352 foreign and 78 official national delegations. The major foreign companies were from US (67 companies), France (49), United Kingdom (33), Russia (29) and Germany (22). Major attraction of this edition were the Dassault Rafale, Boeing C-17 Globemaster III, HAL Rudra, HAL Tejas, HAL Light Combat Helicopter, and the Russian Knights aerobatic team, who had come to India to perform for the first time. Major aircraft manufacturing companies like Lockheed Martin, Saab, and the British Aerospace did not showcase any aircraft this time, however an air force F-16 was part of the static display. The Suryakiran aerobatic team did not take part as it was grounded.  10th edition (2015)  The tenth edition of Aero India was held from 18 to 22 February 2015. The main attraction of this year was the Make in India campaign by Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Prime Minister Modi inaugurated the show and mentioned that its easier for Public, private and foreign investors to manufacture defence equipment in India after the reform of the defence procurement policies and procedure. He also mentions the simplification of offset procedures and mentioned the need to have strategic partnerships rather than buyer seller relationships. The Small and Medium scale industries are also meant to benefit from being part of global supply chain by providing cost effective engineering solutions to global players. He also stressed the need to export equipment and also to ensure that it does not fall into the wrong hands.Full Text of PM Narendra Modi's speech at Aero India Show There is a requirement of one million skilled workers in the Aerospace industry in India in the next 10 years. The aim is to make the ensure that 70 percent of the defence equipment are made within the country in the next five years from the current 40 percent. This can create large number of jobs. Prime Minister Modi said that \\"A strong Indian defence industry will not only make India more secure. It will also make India more prosperous\\". Tejas on display A total of 72 aircraft were part of the air show. The main attraction of the event was the fly past and demonstration by HAL Tejas, HAL Light Combat Helicopter, Sarang display team and air display teams from Sweden, UK, Czech Republic and Open sky jump by US Special forces. A total of 11 foreign military aircraft on display, out of which a majority of them from the United States including two F-15C Eagles, two F-16C Fighting Falcons, one Boeing KC-135 tanker, one C-17 Globemaster III and a P-8A Poseidon maritime surveillance aircraft.PM seeks a stronger defence sector  11th edition (2017)  The 11th edition of the Aero India was held from 14 to 18 February 2017. This edition of the show will see participation from a total of 549 companies (270 Indian and 279 Foreign), 72 participating aircraft, cover an area of 27,678 sqm and witness participation from 51 different countries. Four aerobatic teams are expected to participate in the show including Sarang Team (Indian Air Force), Surya Kiran Team (Indian Air Force), the Scandinavian Air Show Team (Sweden) and the Yakovlevs Aerobatic Team (Russia).  12th edition (2019)  The 12th edition of Aero India was held from 20 to 24 February 2019 in Bengaluru, Karnataka inaugurated by defence minister Nirmala Sitharaman. The theme of the event was Runway to a Billion Opportunities. The logo of the exhibition was inspired by the Tejas Light Combat Aircraft (LCA). In this edition, for the first time, combined the defence and civil aviation segments into a holistic event with the co- involvement of the defence and civil aviation ministries in the event. More than 600 Indian Companies and 200 Foreign Companies participated and witnessed the largest Air show of Asia.

As an Integration theorist, he is notable for Henstock–Kurzweil integral. Henstock brought the theory to a highly developed stage without ever having encountered Jaroslav Kurzweil's 1957 paper on the subject. Early life He was born in the coal-mining village of Newstead, Nottinghamshire, the only child of mineworker and former coalminer William Henstock and Mary Ellen Henstock (née Bancroft). On the Henstock side he was descended from 17th century Flemish immigrants called Hemstok. Because of his early academic promise it was expected that Henstock would attend the University of Nottingham where his father and uncle had received technical education, but as it turned out he won scholarships which enabled him to study mathematics at St John's College, Cambridge from October 1941 until November 1943, when he was sent for war service to the Ministry of Supply's department of Statistical Method and Quality Control in London. This work did not satisfy him, so he enrolled at Birkbeck College, London where he joined the weekly seminar of Professor Paul Dienes which was then a focus for mathematical activity in London. Henstock wanted to study divergent series but Dienes prevailed upon him to get involved in the theory of integration, thereby setting him on course for his life's work. A devoted Methodist, the lasting impression he made was one of gentle sincerity and amiability. Henstock married Marjorie Jardine in 1949. Their son John was born 10 July 1952. Ralph Henstock died on 17 January 2007 after a short illness. Work He was awarded the Cambridge B.A. in 1944 and began research for the PhD in Birkbeck College, London, under the supervision of Paul Dienes. His PhD thesis, entitled Interval Functions and their Integrals, was submitted in December 1948. His Ph.D. examiners were Burkill and H. Kestelman. In 1947 he returned briefly to Cambridge to complete the undergraduate mathematical studies which had been truncated by his Ministry of Supply work. Most of Henstock's work was concerned with integration. From initial studies of the Burkill and Ward integrals he formulated an integration process whereby the domain of integration is suitably partitioned for Riemann sums to approximate the integral of a function. His methods led to an integral on the real line that was very similar in construction and simplicity to the Riemann integral but which included the Lebesgue integral and, in addition, allowed non-absolute convergence. These ideas were developed from the late 1950s. Independently, Jaroslav Kurzweil developed a similar Riemann-type integral on the real line. The resulting integral is now known as the Henstock-Kurzweil integral. On the real line it is equivalent to the Denjoy-Perron integral, but has a simpler definition. In the following decades, Henstock developed extensively the distinctive features of his theory, inventing the concepts of division spaces or integration bases to demonstrate in general settings the properties and characteristics of mathematical integration. His theory provides a unified approach to non-absolute integral, as different kinds of Henstock integral, choosing an appropriate integration basis (division space, in Henstock's own terminology). It has been used in differential and integral equations, harmonic analysis, probability theory and Feynman integration. Numerous monographs and texts have appeared since 1980 and there have been several conferences devoted to the theory. It has been taught in standard courses in mathematical analysis. Henstock was author of 46 journal papers in the period 1946 to 2006. He published four books on analysis (Theory of Integration, 1963; Linear Analysis, 1967; Lectures on the Theory of Integration, 1988; and The General Theory of Integration, 1991). He wrote 171 reviews for MathSciNet. In 1994 he was awarded the Andy Prize of the XVIII Summer Symposium in Real Analysis. His academic career began as Assistant Lecturer, Bedford College for Women, 1947–48; then Assistant Lecturer at Birkbeck, 1948–51; Lecturer, Queen's University Belfast, 1951–56; Lecturer, Bristol University, 1956–60; Senior Lecturer and Reader, Queen's University Belfast, 1960–64; Reader, Lancaster University, 1964–70; Chair of Pure Mathematics, New University of Ulster, 1970–88; and Leverhulme Fellow 1988-91.  List of publications of Ralph Henstock  Much of Henstock's earliest work was published by the Journal of the London Mathematical Society. These were \\"On interval functions and their integrals\\" I (21, 1946) and II (23, 1948); \\"The efficiency of matrices for Taylor series\\" (22, 1947); \\"The efficiency of matrices for bounded sequences\\" (25, 1950); \\"The efficiency of convergence factors for functions of a continuous real variable\\" (30, 1955); \\"A new description of the Ward integral\\" (35 1960); and \\"The integrability of functions of interval functions\\" (39 1964).

It was first published in the United States on 13 April 1959 by Simon & Schuster, New York, and in the United Kingdom on 26 June 1959 by Herbert Jenkins, London. The first US edition dust jacket was designed by Paul Bacon.McIlvaine (1990), pp. 93–94, A82. The book's title comes from the informal phrase \\"a quick one\\", which is British slang for an alcoholic drink consumed quickly. All the stories in the collection feature recurring Wodehouse characters and themes: four Drones Club members (two Freddie Widgeon and two Bingo Little), two golf stories (with the Oldest Member), two Mr Mulliner, one Jeeves and Bertie Wooster, and one Ukridge. \\"A Tithe for Charity\\" did not appear in the original US edition, which instead featured a 1958 \\"exclusive\\" pseudo-Drones story entitled \\"Unpleasantness at Kozy Kot\\" (actually a rewritten version of the 1928 Jeeves story \\"Fixing it for Freddie\\" collected in Carry On, Jeeves). \\"Jeeves Makes an Omelette\\" was a rewritten version of the 1913 Reggie Pepper story \\"Doing Clarence a Bit of Good\\", which appeared in the UK collection My Man Jeeves. Contents=\\"The Fat of the Land\\" * US; This Week, 2 November 1958 (a shorter and somewhat altered version) \\"The Fat of the Land\\" introduces the Drones Club Fat Uncles sweepstakes, which is also central to the 1965 short story \\"Stylish Stouts\\". ;Plot Freddie Widgeon starts a Fat Uncles sweepstakes, in which the names of Drones Club members' uncles are drawn from a hat, and the person who draws the name of the fattest uncle wins the jackpot, which is well over one hundred pounds. On the first day of the Eton v Harrow match, the members will bring their uncles to their club, and the weights of the uncles will be determined by Mr. McGarry, the club bartender, who can tell the weight of anything by sight. It is agreed by the members that whoever draws Freddie's large uncle Lord Blicester (pronounced \\"blister\\") will win. The wealthiest member, Oofy Prosser, draws Lord Blicester's name, while Freddie Widgeon draws Oofy's Uncle Horace. Oofy reads a letter from his uncle, whom he has not seen since childhood, which includes a photograph of Horace Prosser in a bathing suit. Uncle Horace is very fat. Oofy offers to trade tickets with Freddie, pretending he is giving Freddie the winning ticket out of kindness. The Crumpet who is managing the contest records the change of tickets. Oofy has lunch with his uncle and is startled to learn that Uncle Horace is on a diet to please the woman he wants to marry, Mrs. Loretta Delancy. Oofy returns to the Drones Club and tricks Freddie Widgeon into swapping tickets again by showing Freddie the photograph. While visiting Paris, Oofy sees Uncle Horace, as stout as ever. Uncle Horace has lost interest in Loretta and in dieting. Oofy goes back to the Drones Club in London to find Freddie Widgeon, but Freddie is not there. Confident of winning money off the ticket for Oofy's uncle, Freddie had bet on an unsuccessful horse and owes a bookie fifty pounds; the bookie told Freddie that unpleasant accidents happen to people who do not pay him back, so Freddie is hiding in East Dulwich disguised in a beard until he can get the money from the Fat Uncles contest. On the day of the contest, Oofy finds Freddie and tells him they have to swap tickets again, claiming that Uncle Horace has lost weight. When Freddie hesitates, Oofy gives Freddie fifty pounds to make the trade. Uncle Horace arrives, and the Crumpet discovers that \\"Uncle\\" Horace is actually Oofy's distant cousin. Uncle Horace is disqualified. Oofy is less than pleased, especially since he now has to pay for his uncle's lunch. \\"Scratch Man\\" * US: Saturday Evening Post, 20 January 1940 (as \\"Tee for Two\\") (with American setting and names; mostly followed in American edition of book) * UK: Strand, September 1940 (as \\"Tee for Two\\") (with British setting and names; mostly followed in British edition of book) ;Plot The Oldest Member tells a young man the following story about Harold Pickering, who had a handicap of fourteen before love made him a scratch golfer, though only temporarily. Harold Pickering is a partner in a publishing house. He visits champion golfer John Rockett to buy his memoirs. Rockett's children are named after golf courses and are all scratch golfers. Harold falls in love with Rockett's daughter Troon. He tries to propose to her a week later, gargling nervously as he does so. She leaves the room. Believing she rejected him because his handicap is too high, Harold decides to become scratch, and seeks a teacher. He admires the skill of Agnes Flack, the female champion of the club. She is athletic and tough, and her voice is so forceful that she can even make the slow-moving Wrecking Crew scatter. She is confident she can make Harold a scratch player, since she helped another golfer, Sidney McMurdo, bring his handicap down from fifteen to plus one. Thanks to Agnes's lessons, Harold becomes scratch and enters the club championship. He tells the Oldest Member that he is now engaged to Agnes because of a misunderstanding. When he became scratch, he thanked her warmly, and she mistakenly thought he loved her and said she would marry him. The championship final round is between Harold and Sidney. Agnes tells Harold she used to be engaged to Sidney, but broke it off after he used a Number Three iron when she told him to take a Number Four. Sidney is large, intimidating, and jealous. He threatens to injure Harold, but Harold convinces him to postpone it by pointing out that posterity would not look well on Sidney for winning the match that way. Harold lets Sidney win the match and tries to flatter him. Nonetheless, Sidney still threatens Harold afterwards. Harold knocks Sidney over a bridge into the water and flees. He later returns to his house, but sees through the window that Sidney is waiting there. Agnes comes and tells Sidney she means to end her engagement with Harold, because he played so badly in the competition. Sidney tells her he should have used a Number Four when she said so, and they renew their engagement. Troon comes as they leave. Harold approaches her and is surprised when she embraces him. She explains that she had thought Harold was having a fit of some kind when he was gargling, and left to get a doctor. She only realized later that he was proposing when another man did the same thing. She fell in love with Harold when they met. He admits that he cannot keep up being scratch and should have a handicap around ten. She reveals that she has always dreamed of marrying a man with a handicap around ten, because she has also struggled to make herself scratch and would be happier letting herself slip back to ten. \\"The Right Approach\\" * UK: Lilliput, September 1958 (without the Angler's Rest introduction) * US: Playboy, January 1959 (rewritten and condensed, with changes to character names) The character Russell Clutterbuck also appears in French Leave. ;Plot A discussion about romance stories in magazines leads to Mr. Mulliner telling the following story about his nephew Augustus. Augustus accompanies his godmother to a charity bazaar at a house called Balmoral on Wimbledon Common. He falls in love with Hermione Brimble, who lives at Balmoral with her formidable aunt, Beatrice Gudgeon. Augustus pretends he knows Mrs Gudgeon's friend, the Rev. Theophilus Mulliner. Mrs Gudgeon mentions that Hermione's father was a bishop. Augustus believes he must make himself seem pious to impress them. He speaks highly of Social Purity, which Mrs Gudgeon values, and she invites him to the house. Mrs Gudgeon's stepson, novelist Oswald Stoker, is engaged to someone named Yvonne. Oswald is worried about his upcoming dinner with his American publisher, Russell Clutterbuck. Hermione explains that Oswald got a hangover the last time he dined with Clutterbuck. Augustus claims to be a teetotaler, and Hermione remarks that he is good and steady. He proposes, but Hermione turns him down. Augustus is surprised, and wonders why she did not accept him. At one in the morning, he concludes that she misspoke, and goes back to Balmoral. Shortly before two, the butler Staniforth, in pyjamas and a dressing-gown, opens the door and is obviously annoyed. Staniforth informs Augustus that Hermione and her aunt are in town. Staniforth refuses to let him inside, so Augustus waits in the garden. He gazes reverently at all the windows, not knowing which is hers. Oswald suddenly appears and tells Augustus that the right approach is to serenade Hermione by singing about wanting a little rose from her hair. Oswald is drunk, having dined with Clutterbuck, and Augustus ignores him. Oswald mentions that he brought Clutterbuck, who brought a dog. Oswald goes to look for Clutterbuck. The large, unfriendly dog appears and advances on Augustus. He climbs and hides in a tree. The dog leaves and Oswald returns with Clutterbuck, neither of whom notice Augustus. They decide to do Augustus's wooing of Hermione for him, with Oswald singing while Clutterbuck hums the bass. Clutterbuck, also drunk, says they have to launch ship first, and throws a battle of champagne at an upper window, breaking it. At the window, the butler demands to know who is there. Oswald replies that he is Augustus. Clutterbuck throws an egg at Staniforth. Staniforth comes out with a shotgun, intending to put Augustus under restraint. He thinks Augustus sang and threw the egg. It is now three in the morning. Hermione and Mrs Gudgeon return. Oswald agrees with everything Staniforth tells them. Mrs Gudgeon is angry at Augustus and goes to the house with Staniforth. Oswald sees Hermione start to cry. She now thinks Augustus is a sportsman and loves him. She fears she has lost him, until Augustus comes down from the tree. They get engaged. Oswald gives them a toad as a wedding present. Augustus suggests that Hermione put the toad in the butler's bed. She agrees and wants to add a few frogs, too. \\"Jeeves Makes an Omelette\\" * Canada: Toronto Star, 22 August 1958 (a shorter version) * UK: Lilliput, February 1959 (a shorter version) * US: Ellery Queen's Mystery Magazine, August 1959 (as \\"Jeeves and the Stolen Venus\\") See \\"Jeeves Makes an Omelette\\". \\"The Word in Season\\" * UK: Punch, 21 August 1940 * US: Harper's Bazaar, 15 September 1940 * US: This Week, 18 May 1958 (as \\"Bingo Little's Wild Night Out\\") ;Plot Bingo Little's baby, Algernon Aubrey Little, has been proposed by Bingo and seconded by an influential Crumpet for election for Drones Club membership. Some members are reluctant to elect a noisy, messy baby for membership. The Crumpet assures them that Algy will be a beneficent member, as he has a knack for doing the right thing at the right time. The Crumpet tells the other members the following story. Bingo promised his wife Rosie that he would add ten pounds to a deposit account for Algy for his first birthday. This was all he had on hand after getting an advance on his salary. He bets the ten pounds on a horse, hoping to give Algy twenty pounds. The horse loses. To make the money back, Bingo writes a story called \\"Tibby's Wonderful Adventure\\" about a little girl named Gwendoline and her cat Tibby. As editor of Wee Tots, Bingo accepts it for the paper, but the proprietor Henry Cuthbert Purkiss does not pay him for it, saying that all Bingo's contributions are already covered by his salary. Knowing Oofy Prosser is Algy's godfather, Bingo asks him for ten pounds for Algy. Oofy instead pays Bingo to give dinner to a girl named Mabel Murgatroyd, whom Oofy wants to avoid. Mabel and Bingo dine and then go to a gambling place near Bingo's house. Bingo loses his money and police raid the establishment. Bingo hides in a water barrel belonging to his neighbour Mr. Quintin. Mabel hides in the barrel with him until it is safe to leave. The next morning, Rosie returns from a trip, and later confronts Bingo for gambling and hiding in a water barrel with a woman, which she learned about from Quintin. Algy's nanny reports that Algy said his first word, \\"Cat\\". This distracts Rosie, temporarily saving Bingo. Mr. Purkiss and his wife, Rosie's friend Julia, appear. Purkiss wants Bingo to confirm that they were together the previous night, which Purkiss clearly wants his wife to believe. Eagerly, Bingo agrees, and adds that Purkiss had agreed to pay him ten pounds; grudgingly, Purkiss pays Bingo. Bingo tells Rosie that Purkiss can confirm that he was not at the gambling house. He also gives her ten pounds for Algy's account. After Rosie and Julia go to the nursery, Bingo and Purkiss once again agree with each other that they were together the previous night before they also go to Algy. \\"Big Business\\" * US: Collier's, 13 December 1952 (without Mulliner framework; hero is Reggie Watson-Watson) * UK: Lilliput, March/April 1953 (without Mulliner framework; hero is Reggie Watson-Watson) ;Plot After the song \\"Ol' Man River\\" is mentioned at the Angler's Rest, Mr Mulliner tells the following story about his nephew Reginald. Reginald plans to sing \\"Ol' Man River\\" at the annual village concert at Lower-Smattering-on-the-Wissel in Worcestershire. The lawyers of a legal firm inform him that he has inherited fifty thousand pounds from a cousin in Argentina. Reginald is happy about this because he wants money to marry his fiancée Amanada Biffen. Until now their engagement had been secret, because Reginald was not rich, and Amanda's uncle and guardian, retired financier Sir Jasper Todd, wouldn't have approved. Amanda tells Sir Jasper that Reginald has been left fifty thousand pounds. Sir Jasper knows Reginald is not very intelligent and starts to think of ways to get his money. He invites Reginald to his large residence, Wissel Hall. Sir Jasper also happens to be increasing the insurance on his house. Sir Jasper sells Reginald fifty thousand pounds worth of oil stock, pretending he is being generous. Reginald tells Amanda about his purchase, but Amanda realizes that her uncle sold him worthless stock. She is upset with Reginald for buying the shares and says she will agree to marry Lord Knubble of Knopp the next time he proposes. Reginald's disappointment in losing his money and Amanda puts him in the right state of mind to sing \\"Ol' Man River\\" very well. He performs the song in blackface at the village concert, feeling particularly sombre because Amanda is sitting in the front row near Lord Knubble. His performance is very moving and he receives thunderous applause. Normally diffident, Reginald feels emboldened and goes to Wissel Hall to confront Sir Jasper. Nobody answers at the door, so Reginald climbs up a ladder to a first floor balcony. Inside the house, he sees Sir Jasper pouring paraffin over paper and shavings on the floor. Reginald supposes it is for removing stains. He remembers he put burnt cork on his face and hands, and decides he should wash up before talking to Sir Jasper. He leaves the house. Outside, he is stopped by Police Constable Popjoy, who thinks he is a burglar. Meanwhile, Amanda, deeply moved by Reginald's performance, changes her mind and wants to marry him. She sees him running away from Popjoy. She knocks out Popjoy with a wrench from behind, and tells Reginald she loves him. Reginald describes what he saw Sir Jasper doing with paraffin. She tells Reginald to go home to wash up. When Popjoy comes to, she says he was hit by Sputnik and invites him to Wissel Hall. At the house, she tells her uncle that she will bring Popjoy inside if he does not sell Reginald back the oil shares. She adds that the value has gone up and he needs to pay a hundred thousand pounds. Sir Jasper reluctantly agrees. \\"Leave it to Algy\\" * US: Blue Book, 1954 (as \\"The Ordeal of Bingo Little\\") (an earlier version with significant differences in plot but much reused wording in book version) * UK: John Bull, 16 May 1959 (a shorter version whose plot more closely mirrors book version) ;Plot Bingo Little, his wife Rosie, and their infant son Algernon Aubrey, or \\"Algy\\", are on vacation at the seaside resort Bramley-on-Sea. Also there are Henry Cuthbert Purkiss, the manager of the magazine for children Wee Tots which Bingo works for, his wife Julia Purkiss, Oofy Prosser, and the American cartoonist Wally Judd. Before heading to London for the day, Rosie tells Bingo to report his missing gold cufflinks to the police, so they can check pawn shops. Bingo is concerned because he secretly pawned the cufflinks for five pounds to back a losing horse. Rosie leaves, and Bingo sees his boss Purkiss, who is upset that he has to judge a Bonny Babies contest the next day. Bingo takes the job off his hands in exchange for five pounds. Unfortunately, the five pound note is blown away by the wind, and Bingo cannot chase the money since he has to watch over Algy, who, when unsupervised, is apt to hit men wearing Homburg hats with the spade he makes sand castles with. When Bingo sees Oofy, he tells Oofy about his dilemma. Oofy suggests a plan: Oofy will pretend to be Algy's uncle and enter him in the Bonny Babies contest. Bingo will then declare Algy the winner, and this will make Rosie so happy that she will forget about the cufflinks. Bingo is nervous about the plan, because Algy is an unattractive baby, but he agrees. Oofy then leaves to make a telephone call to his bookmaker in London, and bets ten pounds that his \\"nephew\\" will win the Bonny Babies contest. When Oofy returns to Bingo, he says he will also give Bingo five pounds after the contest, so Bingo can buy back his cufflinks. Bingo is grateful. At the contest, Oofy fails to appear with Algy. Bingo selects a winner at random. A police officer comes, saying that a Mrs. Purkiss saw a man with Bingo's baby and had him arrested for kidnapping. Bingo gets Oofy released. Oofy, who had an altercation with a constable, refuses to give Bingo five pounds. The police return Algy to Bingo. Later at the beach, Algy hits a man in a Homburg hat with a spade. Bingo tries to apologize, but the man, the cartoonist Wally Judd, is only too pleased to see Algy and pays Bingo twenty pounds to use Algy as a model for a villain in his comic strip. Bingo happily agrees and goes to the pawn shop. \\"Joy Bells for Walter\\" * US: This Week, 7 October 1956 (as \\"Keep Your Temper, Walter\\") * UK: John Bull, 16 February 1957 (as \\"Keep Your Temper, Walter\\") The story is an Oldest Member golf story. It is a simplified reworking of \\"Excelsior\\" from Nothing Serious. \\"A Tithe for Charity\\" * US: Playboy, April 1955 ;Plot Corky, a writer and friend of Stanley Ukridge, is initially surprised when their friend George Tupper tells him that Ukridge visited him without trying to borrow money. However, George adds that a suit of his and some other nice clothes have gone missing. Corky goes to see Ukridge, and asks him if he stole George's clothes. Ukridge claims he borrowed them for a job interview with a friend of his Aunt Julia, the wealthy novelist. Her friend is looking for a tutor for his son. Aunt Julia gave Ukridge fifteen pounds to buy nice clothes, which her latest butler, Barter, suggested he wager on a horse called Dogsbody. Before he could bet his money, a man to whom Ukridge has owed two pounds, three shillings and sixpence for a few years spotted Ukridge and he fled. Dogsbody lost the race, so Ukridge thanks his guardian angel for preventing him from gambling. Out of gratitude, Ukridge says he will give a tithe of the fifteen quid to charity by giving a shilling each to three deserving cases, though Corky points out that a tithe of fifteen pounds should mean ten shillings each. The next day, Corky is about to go to the Senior Conservative Club to interview novelist Horace Wanklyn about \\"The Modern Girl\\" for the Sunday Dispatch, but can't find his tightly rolled umbrella, which he needs to make a good impression. Corky's landlord Bowles, who is inexplicably fond of Ukridge, tells Corky that he let Ukridge borrow the umbrella. Corky finds Ukridge, who is nicely dressed in George Tupper's clothes and has Corky's umbrella. They realize Ukridge's job interview is with the same man Corky is going to see. Ukridge has already helped two deserving cases. First, he gave a shilling to a shabby-looking man and left quickly to escape his thanks. Then he was generous enough to put a whole quid in the purse of a girl with inexpensive clothes, but a policeman saw this and thought he was stealing from her. Ukridge explained what he did, but was only allowed to go after taking a number of sobriety tests. A ragged man comes along asking for money, and after Ukridge gives him sixpence, he is effusively grateful and practically embraces Ukridge. Corky goes to the Senior Conservative and meets Wanklyn, who is obviously uncomfortable in his elegant but stiff clothes. Wanklyn complains that his daughter Patricia, who nags him to stop dressing in shabby clothes, made him change after a man came up and gave him a shilling. He blames that man for his predicament. Corky later warns Ukridge not to see Wanklyn. Ukridge discovers that he has lost his wallet, which was stolen by the ragged individual. Ukridge is through with charity and ignores the next ragged individual who tries to trick him out of money. \\"Oofy, Freddie and the Beef Trust\\" * First published in the 1949 omnibus Best of Wodehouse,In the Omnibus it is preceded by a page headed \\"Introducing a new story\\" as \\"Freddie, Oofy and the Beef Trust\\" ;Plot Oofy Prosser makes it clear to other members at the Drones Club that he hates wrestlers. A Crumpet tells the following story about how Jas Waterbury, a \\"greasy bird\\" (a greasy-headed person), caused trouble for Oofy involving wrestlers. Jas Waterbury proposes an investment opportunity to club member Freddie Widgeon that requires a couple hundred pounds. Freddie says he does not have that kind of money, unlike Drones Club member Oofy Prosser. Jas agrees to pay Freddie a commission in exchange for being introduced to Oofy. The next morning, Oofy tells the Crumpet that Freddie introduced him to Waterbury, who wants Oofy to invest two hundred pounds so they can put on wrestling matches. Oofy meets Jas's two large and intimidating all-in wrestlers, Porky Jupp and Plug Bosher (see \\"beef trust\\"). They go into training for a couple of weeks at a cottage. The wrestlers become uncooperative because of poor quality meals. Oofy suggests bringing in a new cook, and Jas recommends one of his nieces, Myrtle Cootes. She cooks well for them, and the two wrestlers become friends again. To avoid paying Freddie his commission, Oofy convinces Freddie that reconciliation between the wrestlers has proved impossible, and gives him ten pounds as a consolation. Another problem arises: Porky and Plug are now rivals for the affection of Myrtle. Jas persuades Oofy to pretend to court Myrtle so that Porky and Plug will unite against him, and tells Oofy to kiss Myrtle. When Oofy kisses her, Porky and Plug threaten to harm Oofy for playing with her feelings. Jas tells Porky and Plug that Oofy is honorably engaged to Myrtle, and Oofy confirms this in order to save himself. Heartbroken, Plug and Porky decide to give up wrestling and go to Africa. Jas says that at least Myrtle will be happy being married to Oofy. Oofy does not want to marry her, but Jas threatens a breach of promise case and violence from the wrestlers. Oofy is forced to pay Jas two thousand pounds. About a week later at the Drones Club, Jas Waterbury shows up and tells Freddie he wants to become a member. However, when Oofy sees Jas, he attacks him, and after being pulled back by Freddie, walks off angrily. Freddie, trusting and naive as ever, is tricked by Jas into giving him ten pounds. Background In \\"Leave it to Algy\\", it is mentioned that Oofy Prosser agreed to become Algernon Aubrey Little's godfather with the understanding that, having provided a christening gift, Oofy would not be expected to give Algernon Aubrey any future gifts. This reflects Wodehouse's real agreement to become godfather to Frances Donaldson's daughter Rose on the understanding that after the obligatory christening gift, there would be no expectation of future presents.

The event usually occurs when a corporation's stockholders develop opposition to some aspect of the corporate governance, often focusing on directorial and management positions. Corporate activists may attempt to persuade shareholders to use their proxy votes (i.e., votes by one individual or institution as the authorized representative of another) to install new management for any of a variety of reasons. Shareholders of a public corporation may appoint an agent to attend shareholder meetings and vote on their behalf. That agent is the shareholder's proxy.Klein, Ramseyer, and Bainbridge. Business Associations: Cases and Materials on Agency, Partnerships, and Corporations. (7th Ed.) Foundation Press. In a proxy fight, incumbent directors and management have the odds stacked in their favor over those trying to force the corporate change. These incumbents use various corporate governance tactics to stay in power, including: staggering the boards (i.e., having different election years for different directors), controlling access to the corporation's money, and creating restrictive requirements in the bylaws. As a result, most proxy fights are unsuccessful; except those waged more recently by hedge funds, which are successful more than 60% of the time.Klein, April and Zur, Emanuel. 2009. Entrepreneurial shareholder activism: Hedge funds and other private investors. Journal of Finance 64(1): 187-229. Examples *An acquiring company, frustrated by the takeover defenses of the management, may initiate a proxy fight to install a more compliant management of the target. *An early history of proxy fighting, detailing such 1950s battles as the fight for control of some of U.S. largest corporations, including the Bank of America and the New York Central Railroad, can be found in David Karr's 1956 volume, Fight for Control. *Stockholder dissidents opposed to an impending takeover in the view that it will dilute value may also use a proxy fight to stop it. An example of a proxy fight took place within Hewlett-Packard, when the management of that company sought to take over Compaq. Opponents of the Compaq takeover lost the fight. The management, under Carly Fiorina, remained in place, and the merger went ahead.HP declares proxy win *In the absence of any looming takeover, proxy fights can come about because dissidents are unhappy with management, as with Carl Icahn's effort in 2005–2006 to oust a majority of the board of Time Warner.Frank Biondi Joins Carl Icahn in Time Warner Proxy Fight Key players Due to their out-sized influence with many institutional investors, proxy advisors play a key role in many proxy fights.

It took its name from Richard le Child, who in 1312 held a customary house and \\"30 acres\\" of its area. It is a mainly late-19th-century suburban large neighbourhood centred 5 miles (8 km) northwest of Charing Cross bordered by the arterial road Hendon Way in the west and south-west, Dunstan Road in the north, West Heath and Golders Hill Park which form an arm of Hampstead Heath to the east and the borough boundary as to the short south-east border. Child's Hill reaches relatively high ground in London along its eastern border. Adjoining Hampstead Heath features, less than a mile from the centre of Child's Hill, the summit of London's third-highest escarpment. From 1789 to 1847 Child's Hill hosted an optical telegraph station. Politics The area has long given its name to a ward of the United Kingdom and which has always taken in the heart of the area and many other neighbouring streets. It currently reaches to take in Cricklewood and in the opposite direction most of Golders Green; to give it a population of 20,049 across 3.089 square kilometres. Due to large- scale exclusion of the parkland to the east and north-east, the ward as drawn is currently the most densely populated in the borough. For 2018-2022 it sends to Barnet Council two Conservatives, Shimon Ryde and Peter Zinkin, and one Labour Party councillor, Anne Clarke.Election results on Barnet Council website The area has two Residents' Associations: *GERA, for Granville Rd. and neighbouring roads *CLAN, representing three residential streets at the heart of the neighbourhood - Crewys, Llanvanor and Nant Roads. History Childs Hill took its name from Richard le Child, who in 1312 held a customary house and \\"30 acres\\" of its area, believed to be on the ancient long-held borders within Hendon rather than Hampstead, the area having always whilst rural been so split. The earliest known use with the word Hill is in 1593. Today, the apostrophe in the name is optional.T F T Baker, Diane K Bolton and Patricia E C Croot, 'Hampstead: Childs Hill', in A History of the County of Middlesex: Volume 9 ed. C R Elrington (London, 1989), pp. 73-75. British History Online http://www.british-history.ac.uk/vch/middx/vol9/pp73-75 [accessed 10 May 2018]. In the 18th century, Childs Hill was a centre for brick and tile making, supplying material for building Hampstead. The Castle Inn dates from this period: the first record of it is in 1751. The land drains steeply from east to west. It reaches over above mean sea level in the east at the top of residential Platts Lane where Hampstead Heath starts. From 1789 to 1847 the east of Childs Hill hosted an optical telegraph station. In 1808 this became one of a line of telegraph stations stretching from the Admiralty to Great Yarmouth, erected as part of Britain's national defences. Only the name, Telegraph Hill, remains; it has been covered with housing (the Telegraph Hill south-east corner of Childs Hill is now inside the boundary of the London Borough of Camden). An Act of Parliament in 1826 enabled Finchley Road giving a new road to the north other than two further east through hillier and higher, sometimes narrow urban lanes, which met at Highgate; it was completed by 1829. It had a tollgate at the Castle Public House. The road has a double- width bypass skirting Childs Hill. In the early 1850s a Colonel Evans speculatively built \\"The Mead\\", where brickworks had been, renamed Granville Road, the street name today. By the 1870s laundries were a major local industry. The last, the Initial Laundry in Granville Road, closed in 2006. Housing Childs Hill has streets of leafy semi-detached and relatively plain terraced housing. It is also characterised by four high rise blocks of flats and some blocks of mid-rise apartments. The first block of the four was built by the building company Tersons for the Metropolitan Police in about 1956. These were homes for police families. Orchard Mead House, on the Finchley Road, later became Quarters/homes for armed/other emergency Services families for a short time before moving into the private sector. The second and third blocks, in Granville Road were built in about 1960, by the local borough as housing in the local community. The fourth block, presumed to be the same, was built some time later. Amenities Childs Hill has a public library, as well as a square park, Childs Hill park, which also contains the Childs Hill Bowls Club, several shops and restaurants, small businesses, offices, primary schools and two churches (All Saints C of E with Primary School and Childs Hill Baptist, whose pastor of over 30 years is Gary Brady). At the Western extreme on the Hendon Way, is the Palm Hotel, formerly the Garth Hotel. Alexei Sayle's short story Barcelona Plates goes into some detail as its protagonist stays there for a while, noting, amongst many other features, the idiosyncratic design of the building, an amalgamation of suburban houses. It has an off-centre park, Basing Hill Park. Golders Hill Park borders the east of its area; over half of it is included in two purely Childs Hill census output areas though it borders too Golders Green. Another park, Clitterhouse Recreation Ground is just over the usual borders of the area. Neighbouring areasNotable people Childs Hill has blue plaques commemorating two famous former residents: Sportsman C. B. Fry who lived at Moreland Court, Lyndale Avenue, and Aviator Amy Johnson, who lived at Vernon Court on the Hendon Way. Another former resident was John Bloxham, who used to live in Garth Road, He now resides in Northampton. Though not a resident John Constable, who lived in nearby Hampstead, painted Childs Hill in oils in 1825. (The work is entitled Childs Hill with Harrow in the Distance). The painting shows the view northwest along what is now Cricklewood Lane, with Harrow on the Hill visible beyond.

It is located in Dobrich Province, 35 km southeast of Dobrich and 42 km northeast of Varna. The town sprawls scenically along hilly terraces descending from the Dobruja plateau to the sea. It is often called \\"The white city\\" because of the white color of the hills. Etymology The town is named after the medieval ruler Balik, brother of Dobrotitsa, after whom is named the city of Dobrich.  History  Balchik's centre Balchik's centre The Balchik Botanical Garden Founded as a Thracian settlement, it was later colonised by the Ionian ancient Greeks with the name Krounoi () (renamed as Dionysopolis (), after the discovery of a statue of Dionysus in the sea).An inventory of archaic and classical poleis By Mogens Herman Hansen, Thomas Heine Nielsen, Kobenhavns universitet. Polis centret Page 932 Later became a Greek-Byzantine and Bulgarian fortress. Under the Ottoman Empire, the town came to be known with its present name, which perhaps derived from a Gagauz word meaning \\"small town\\".И така, нзв Балканът в качеството си на собствено име заема едно точно определено място в ономастичното пространство на българския език или което е същото - сред всички остана... Another opinion is that its actual name derived from that of a local noble - Balik. After the liberation of Bulgaria in 1878, Balchik developed as centre of a rich agricultural region, wheat-exporting port, and district (okoliya) town, and later, as a major tourist destination with the beachfront resort of Albena to its south. After the Second Balkan War, in 1913, the town was renamed Balcic and became part of the Kingdom of Romania. It was regained by Bulgaria during World War I (1916–1919), but Romania restored its authority when hostilities in the region ceased. In 1940, just before the outbreak of World War II in the region, Balchik was ceded by Romania to Bulgaria by the terms of the Craiova Treaty. During Romania's administration, the Balchik Palace was the favourite summer residence of Queen Marie of Romania and her immediate family. The town is the site of Marie's Oriental villa, the place where her heart was kept, in accordance with her last wishes, until 1940 (when the Treaty of Craiova awarded the region back to Bulgaria). It was then moved to Bran Castle, in central Romania. Today, the Balchik Palace and the adjacent Balchik Botanical Garden are the town's most popular landmarks and a popular tourist sightseeing destination. During the inter-war period, Balchik was also a favorite destination for Romanian avant-garde painters, lending his name to an informal school of post-impressionist painters – the Balcic School of Painting Balcica Maciuca, Balcic, Editura Universalia, București, 2001\\\\- which is central in the development of Romanian 20th-century painting. Many works of the artists composing the group depict the town's houses and the Turkish inhabitants, as well as the sea.  Population  The city's population is 11,051 people (data from National Statistics Institute - Bulgaria, 2018). The total population of Balchik municipality is 19,331. According to an estimate by Bulgarian historian Rayna Gavrilova the Bulgarian population before 1878 was only around 10%.Gavrilova, Raina:\\"Bulgarian urban culture in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries\\" p.47. The ethnic composition has gradually changed from mostly Gagauz and Tatar/Turkish to predominantly Bulgarian. According to the latest 2011 census data, Balchik's ethnic composition is the following: Population on 01.02.2011 by provinces, municipalities, settlements and age; National Statistical Institute Population by province, municipality, settlement and ethnic identification, by 01.02.2011; Bulgarian National Statistical Institute *Bulgarians: 7,916 (72.9%) *Turks: 1,715 (15.8%) *Gypsies: 954 (8.8%) *Others: 191 (1.8%) *Indefinable: 79 (0.7%) *Undeclared: 755 (6.5%) Culture=Art Held each year since 1991, \\"The ProcessSpace Art Festival\\" is an annual international festival of Contemporary Art, which takes place over two weeks in June. Balchik Palace also hosts In the Palace International Short Film Festival. Music Held annually each summer since 2006 in the nearby town of Kavarna, the Kavarna Rock Fest hosts top-name bands for a three-day festival. Previous acts have included Motorhead, Twisted Sister, Motley Crew, Scorpions, Alice Cooper, Deep Purple, and the Michael Schenker Group. Since a few years the major has cancelled the Kavarna Rock Fest due to different music preference. Sports Balchik is becoming well known internationally as a golfing destination.

Although a technological achievement and a short term commercial success, the canal was soon eclipsed by the railway, and Dundas by neighbouring Hamilton. Historical context Following the US Revolutionary War the British government felt an urgent need to populate the interior of the province of Upper Canada. The immediate concern was to find a refuge for Loyalists forced from their previous homes in the United States. After the early settlement of Kingston and the lower St. Lawrence River, and the establishment of Butler's Rangers and others in the Niagara peninsula, the possibility also existed for Loyalist communities at the head of Lake Ontario. Another priority was the need to accelerate the settlement of the unoccupied areas in western Upper Canada in order to provide a buffer zone between that province and the United States in the event of further hostilities. Lieutenant-Governor John Graves Simcoe hoped to achieve this by offering free 200-acre (80 ha) grants of land in the interior of the province to prospective settlers regardless of nationality. It had been expected that this would entice from the United States immigrants who would become loyal citizens and add to the province's defensive capability. However land in the Ohio Territory and western New York proved more to their liking. In order to make the area more attractive, Simcoe wished to open transportation arteries between the interior of the province and the shipping corridor provided by Lake Ontario and the Saint Lawrence River. Not only would these support commercial services for the expanding population and economy of the new territory, they would also serve military purposes, routing traffic away from areas controlled by the United States. The story of the area around the head of the lake during the early 19th century is one of competition between the towns of Dundas, Ancaster and Hamilton to service this increased trade and achieve economic supremacy. Each town had its unique advantages and disadvantages which might make it more or less attractive to prospective businessmen and settlers. Ancaster had an abundance of fertile land, streams adequate to power mills, and a population of nearly two thousand people. However, in order for an industrial economy to develop, easy access to Lake Ontario was critical. As Ancaster did not border on the lake, in the 1820s and 1830s Dundas, with better water access, an established commercial centre, a relatively stable industrial base and available water power eclipsed it in size and importance. However Dundas in turn was challenged by Hamilton. In 1816 the district of Gore had been created at the head of the lake amid jockeying over the selection of the district town. The previous year George Hamilton, then living in Queenston, had decided to move away from the border with the United States due to concern about further conflict. Well-connected (his father had been a member of the Legislative Council and an extensive landowner), he was aware that a new district was to be established and purchased a substantial amount of land in the area from James Durand. Within a year Hamilton had been selected as the district town. The Desjardins Canal was the centerpiece of Dundas’ efforts to adjust to this development and preserve its early status as the industrial hub of the area. Early Manoeuvring Map of the canal Access to Lake Ontario from the mainland was made more difficult by the topography of the area, which included a large sandbar, a natural sand and gravel barrier, across Burlington Bay. A water outlet to the lake through a depression in the sandbar existed but it was intermittent and quite near the water's surface with clearance of two to three feet, allowing only small boats and bateaux to pass through. For any other type of craft it was necessary for the cargo to be unloaded, carried across the barrier, and then reloaded on another vessel for further handling. Because of this obstacle to any commercial shipping entering the bay from Lake Ontario all parties had an interest in seeing the barrier breached. Restricted access to Burlington Bay was a concern for reasons other than the usual commercial ones. One involved vessel safety, as access to a protected harbor had obvious advantages in the event of lake storms. There were also military considerations. Since action on the Niagara Peninsula could be expected in any future war with the United States, warships sheltering in Burlington Bay could be protected by land-based guns. An added incentive was the fact that the liberalization of the British Navigation Acts in the 1820s meant that certain U.S. products could be exported from Canada as though they had originated there, allowing the U.S. Midwest to share in Colonial preferences and attracting additional trade from this source. Improved access to the lake from the entrepôts at the limits of land transportation was required in order for the scheme to achieve its full potential. However, with the road network in the province at that time being dismal at best, improving water transportation, was seen as vital to economic growth. It was in this context that the government of Upper Canada authorized in 1823 the construction of a canal through the sandbar. In 1826 the passage was completed, allowing schooners to sail right up to Hamilton's doorstep. Hamilton then became a major port and quickly expanded as a center of trade and commerce. Access to the hinterland through Dundas was still easier as the Dundas Valley offered a natural route up the Niagara Escarpment, yet its major problem, difficult passage of goods and produce through the marsh, still existed. The two most influential people in the effort to ensure that Dundas got its share of increased trade with the interior were Richard Hatt and Peter Desjardins. The Key Players Richard Hatt emigrated from England to Canada in 1792, settling first at Niagara and moving, possibly as early as 1796, to Ancaster. In 1798 Hatt and his brother built his so-called \\"Red Mill\\" in Ancaster and cleared a road from there to Dundas in order to attract customers. However success in Ancaster was limited and he soon focused his attention on Spencer Creek in the Dundas area, which not only had ample water to power a mill but also potentially better access to Lake Ontario and the interior of the province. In 1800 Hatt purchased land for a flour mill in Dundas. Recognizing the need for facilities near the inlet to the marsh, where cargoes were loaded and unloaded because of the lack of water clearance over the sandbar, he petitioned for land to build a storehouse and wharf. This request was granted in 1804. He expanded his holdings by building warehouses on both Burlington beach and in Cootes Paradise (the early name for Dundas). He also funded the clearing of debris from Spencer Creek and the deepening of portions of the channel between Burlington beach and Dundas. Hatt saw the benefits of controlling not only the milling operation but also the transportation of goods to and from the area. In 1809 he received approval to deepen the channel through the village of Coote's Paradise to the wharf at his mill. By 1808 he owned all the water rights and mills from Webster's Falls to Main Street in Dundas and in that year cleared a path through the marsh, which was used until the canal opened in 1837. Hatt set in place the initial plans and facilities from which the Desjardins Canal would later emerge. When he died in 1819 he was one of the wealthiest men in Upper Canada, having an interest in over of land, several farms and a number of industries along Spencer Creek. On his death his business empire was divided. His waterway, storage and bateau interests were acquired by Pierre (Peter) Desjardins while his milling interests and water rights were taken over by others. Desjardins, who was born in France, came to Canada in 1792. Following his arrival he worked in several locations, from 1812 serving as a clerk for Richard Hatt while Hatt was away campaigning. He held this position until Hatt's death in 1819, then becoming a partner with William Lyon Mackenzie in a warehouse on the bank of Spencer Creek. Desjardins saw the considerable benefits possible if access from the lake to Dundas were improved. He was primarily interested in developing a canal between his property and Burlington Bay but also promoted related schemes, including a second canal (never built) extending from the Desjardins Canal in Dundas to Lake Huron. The proposal would have allowed the Desjardins Canal a direct water access to the western areas of both Canada and the United States and might have proved financially attractive, if technically viable. However, by this time the Erie Canal was completed and the Welland Canal was well on its way so undoubtedly the competition was seen to be too great, considering the late start. The Search for Support In 1820 Desjardins had petitioned the government for a lot on Spencer Creek as well as for a small island in front of the lot. He planned to build a storehouse beside Spencer Creek, deepen the creek to make a channel from the town to the marsh and cut a channel through the marsh to allow access of larger boats from Lake Ontario. The government was far from being solidly behind the project but was willing to let Desjardins go ahead on an experimental basis as long as in case of failure no risk would be transferred to the province. Desjardins’ proposal to provide access for \\"sloops and small vessels\\" was endorsed by local business leaders and approved by an order-in- council Nov 14, 1820, with the injunction that Desjardins could not charge tolls for access to the properties. Unfortunately, during the 1820s there was a serious depression and a reversal in the flour trade. For three years Desjardins circulated a prospectus to draw in capital but was unsuccessful. In spite of this he persevered and made substantial progress using his own resources. In 1825 a group of local incorporators, seeing in the canal a means of directing additional business to themselves and increasing the value of their real estate holdings, applied for a charter to build the canal. A joint stock company was planned. Royal assent to the formation of the corporation was given on January 30, 1826. Eight hundred shares of capital stock were authorized at a price of £12/10/0 for a projected capitalization of £10,000. The parliamentary approval provided for a fifty-year lease, with title to revert to the Crown after that period subject to reimbursement to the stockholders of the value of their holdings. Desjardins was granted land including a lot on North Quay Street in Coote's Paradise, a piece of land on the bank of the creek in front of the lot and a small island in the creek itself. However Desjardins did not live to see the results of his efforts. The costs that he personally incurred to get the Desjardins Canal project under way exhausted his assets and credit. He had hoped to be reimbursed when investor capital began to flow but instead was required by the agreement with the province to accept canal stock for one half of his expenditures and security (a provincial bond) for the other half. No actual cash was forthcoming. By 1827 he was forced to offer his house and some land for sale in order to finance work on the canal. Peter Desjardins died on September 7, 1827, from injuries received while collecting amounts owing for stock in the Desjardins Canal. When his horse returned without a rider a search was made and Desjardins’ body was discovered. An inquest was inconclusive and finally ruled that Desjardins had \\"Died by the visitation of God\\". There were no witnesses to the event and the cause of death was never truly known. Project Progress The project to build Desjardins Canal continued for ten years, from 1827 to 1837. It was a local operation with limited objectives and attracted financial backers and political support almost exclusively from within Upper Canada. In this it contrasted with such projects as the Welland Canal, the completion of which was of international importance, and whose individual backers were largely from outside the province. Once work on the Desjardins Canal had begun in earnest it was necessary to recruit a supply of workers. Although canal labourers were much in demand due to the many projects previously alluded to, still wages were low, fluctuating around two to three shillings per day, an amount barely sufficient for a family's basic needs. The Desjardins Canal Company hired labourers directly for some tasks, for others dealing with contractors who would then recruit the labour force themselves. Attracting capital was a continuing problem for the company. Available records do not indicate that at any time more than 70-80% of the authorized shares were subscribed or that more than £6000 (out of an authorized £10000) was raised in this way. A limited amount of money came from canal operations (tolls) but for the bulk of the needed capital other sources were required. Government financial support was continually necessary to prop up the company. The early 1830s were especially bleak. However work continued in spite of all the difficulties that the project had endured, and by 1837 the company was able to put the final touches on the canal. For that year the company's financial statements recorded income of close to £6000 of which the majority, £5,000, was from a government loan. £166 was received from canal tolls in 1837, the first year for which any operating income was recorded. The canal was officially opened and dedicated on August 16, 1837 to great celebration and hoopla. Steamers brought revellers to Dundas from Hamilton for concerts and an evening dinner. The Canal at Mid-Century Dundas experienced significantly increased prosperity once the canal had opened. Since flour could now be shipped more cheaply the local mills prospered. Shipments of lumber-based products of all types increased. Once the canal had provided an outlet to the lake, local manufacturers could sell to a broader market. As money flowed into the area the town was able to accumulate capital to finance the growth of local industries. The population, which had been 800 in 1836, had increased to 2000 by this time. Soon sailing vessels were being built in the turning basin. In spite of the economic benefits that the canal was generating, however, the company continued to struggle with technical and financial problems. Repairs and improvements were necessary in order to make canal operations viable on an ongoing basis but sufficient money was not available from private sources, or from canal operations. There were, however, some bright spots. Increased imports of coal and pig iron through the canal were indicative of the fact that an industrial economy was developing in Dundas. Imports of merchandise rapidly increased as the population grew, the economy developed, and people had more money to spend. By the beginning of the 1850s the citizens of Dundas had reason to feel optimistic about their town. In 1849, 14,000 tons of produce had been shipped via the Desjardins Canal, a reflection of the importance of the canal in supporting the export trade of the area. The construction of a road network connecting Dundas with the back country was also accelerated by the incorporation of the Paris and Dundas Road Company. The Desjardins Canal Company was able to keep the canal operational by means of a scaled down dredging operation. Along the canal a warehouse 120 by , described as one of the largest in British North America was nearing completion and had already been rented by a Toronto firm. There were several other warehouses on the margin of the canal and it was not uncommon to ship more than 100,000 barrels of flour yearly through the port. However the coming of railway service to Hamilton caused added complications and the competition finally doomed the canal. The End of the Road The first railway in Canada was the Champlain and St. Lawrence Railroad, built in 1836 in Lower Canada to connect ports on the St. Lawrence and Richelieu Rivers. The potential for railroad transportation in Upper Canada was quickly recognized and almost immediately the Desjardins Canal Company was forced to deal with this new source of competition. Railways came on stream rapidly during the mid-1850s but the one that had the most impact on Dundas and the Desjardins Canal was the Great Western Railway connecting Niagara Falls and Windsor through Hamilton, Dundas and London. This development was good news for the province as a whole but, as the lines serviced areas on which the Desjardins Canal depended for much of its traffic, they had a negative impact on the canal company. While the canal continued to provide benefits to Dundas, its problems did not abate. Chief among them were financial issues as the canal continued to be unable to generate sufficient operating income to remain viable. Competition from the railroads, and from the network of roads allowing improved travel between producers and consumers, certainly contributed to this. Another factor was that, with the development of steam-based power technology, it became possible to locate industry away from sources of water power. This, along with the availability of waterfront access not dependent on the vagaries of the Desjardins Canal, accelerated the growth of industry on Hamilton's bay shore to the detriment of Dundas. All this was exacerbated by squabbling between the railroad, road and canal companies about bridge construction and rights-of-way. As the canal cut through the shortest route between Toronto and Hamilton for both rail and road traffic it was necessary to bridge the gap in some way in order to accommodate land-based traffic. Conflict over the years centered over whether to build a low level bridge (cheaper but with the potential to block canal traffic, and difficult for trains to use) or a high level one (more expensive but providing a straight and level base for train traffic). The bridges also presented safety issues, most notably in 1857 when a derailment which killed 59 people received wide attention. Protracted negotiations between the contending companies led nowhere and finally the Desjardins Canal Company was offered $10,000 if they would close the canal down. However the town of Dundas had become the canal's principal mortgage holder, with a $52,000 stake in the canal, and as income from future tolls was the only apparent way by which this debt could be discharged, the offer was refused. To protect their interest the town seized the canal to settle the mortgage and applied to the government for relief from canal debts. This was granted in 1873. However the bridges were still perceived to be in an unstable condition and this, along with rapidly dropping canal revenues, caused the town to reverse its position and agree to close the canal subject to payments of $35,000 each from both the road company and the railway company in lieu of any claims. For all practical purposes the canal had ceased to have a serious commercial future once a low level road bridge was constructed in 1869, denying access to most lake schooners. Writing in 1875 a local historian commented on \\"The ill-fated Desjardins canal. It is now seldom used except by raftsmen for the purpose of floating timber into Burlington Bay, or sometimes by the people of Dundas who might use the small boat Argylle for the purpose of convening pleasure parties to Rock Bay or other points along the shore.\\" In 1876 the canal company was liquidated. The canal was turned over to the Crown as required by the original incorporation agreement and became a public work. However the provincial government, then as in the past, had no interest in equity ownership and the canal was placed under the control and management of the town of Dundas by an Order in Council on April 25, 1877. In October of that year full ownership was transferred to the town by two additional Orders in Council. In 1878 a canal committee was struck by Dundas, the canal was dredged again, tolls were revised and advertisements for business published. However this was to little avail and in 1895 direct rail service to Dundas was inaugurated, finally ending any dreams of commercial potential for the Desjardins Canal. Today, its remains can be seen north of Cootes Drive in east Dundas and in the rotting logs in the shallows of Cootes Paradise. As part of the renaissance in the area, the city of Hamilton established a walking path along the former canal.

It was designed by Bill Wadge and Ed Ashcroft and described in the 1985 book Lucid, the Dataflow Programming Language. pLucid was the first interpreter for Lucid. Model Lucid uses a demand-driven model for data computation. Each statement can be understood as an equation defining a network of processors and communication lines between them through which data flows. Each variable is an infinite stream of values and every function is a filter or a transformer. Iteration is simulated by 'current' values and 'fby' (read as 'followed by') operator allowing composition of streams. Lucid is based on an algebra of histories, a history being an infinite sequence of data items. Operationally, a history can be thought of as a record of the changing values of a variable, history operations such as first and next can be understood in ways suggested by their names. Lucid was originally conceived as a disciplined, mathematically pure, single-assignment language, in which verification would be simplified. However, the dataflow interpretation has been an important influence on the direction in which Lucid has evolved. Details In Lucid (and other dataflow languages) an expression that contains a variable that has not yet been bound waits until the variable has been bound, before proceeding. An expression like \`x + y\` will wait until both x and y are bound before returning with the output of the expression. An important consequence of this is that explicit logic for updating related values is avoided, which results in substantial code reduction, compared to mainstream languages. Each variable in Lucid is a stream of values. An expression \`n = 1 fby n + 1\` defines a stream using the operator 'fby' (a mnemonic for \\"followed by\\"). fby defines what comes after the previous expression. (In this instance the stream produces 1,2,3,...). The values in a stream can be addressed by these operators (assuming x is the variable being used): \`'first x'\` \\\\- fetches the first value in the stream x, \`'x'\` \\\\- the current value of the stream, \`'next x'\` \\\\- fetches the next value in the stream. \`'asa'\` \\\\- an operator that does some thing 'as soon as' the condition given becomes true. \`'x upon p'\` \\\\- upon is an operator that repeats the old value of the stream x, and updates to the new values only when the stream p makes a \`true\` value available. (It serves to slow down the stream x) i.e.: \`x upon p\` is the stream x with new values appearing upon the truth of p. The computation is carried out by defining filters or transformation functions that act on these time-varying streams of data.

Taxonomy The white-flippered penguin is currently considered by most taxonomists to be a colour morph or subspecies of the little penguin (E. minor). Analysis of mtDNA in 2002 revealed two clades in Eudyptula: one containing little penguins of New Zealand's North Island, Cook Strait and Chatham Island, as well as the white-flippered penguin, and a second containing little penguins of Australia and the southeastern coast of New Zealand's South Island.Banks, Jonathan C.; Mitchell, Anthony D.; Waas, Joseph R. & Paterson, Adrian M.

In 2008, Shirihai treated the little penguin and white-flippered penguin as allospecies.Shirihai, Hadoram (2008). The Complete Guide to Antarctic Wildlife, 2d Edition. Princeton University Press. However, as of 2012, the IUCN and BirdLife International consider the white-flippered penguin to be a subspecies or morph of the little penguin. Habitat White-flippered penguins live in headlands, caves, rock jumbles, and in the sheltered areas at the bases of bays. They are found mostly in Canterbury, New Zealand. General behaviour White-flippered penguins are primarily nocturnal animals on land and are unique among penguins in this respect. They differ from other penguins in that they stay with the colony during the day, and then leave under the cover of darkness and return before dawn. However, on Banks Peninsula, some birds can be observed on land outside their burrows during daylight. In the evening, these penguins tend to assemble offshore in groups until light levels are low enough for them to feel sufficiently safe to head inland. This results in large batches of birds arriving at one time. Breeding The white-flippered penguin lays its eggs from July to December, with most egg-laying occurring August through November. The eggs are always laid in burrows under tree brush almost like nests; they are also laid in dunes, or on vegetated slopes, and are incubated for 33 to 39 days. Chicks fledge after 50 to 65 days. Feeding The white-flippered penguin feeds on small shoaling fish, such as pilchards and anchovies, or cephalopods, and less often on crustaceans. It catches its food by pursuit diving. Most feeding takes place within of the coast with daily round trips. The farthest trip out to sea for food was offshore.

The AutoHotkey installation includes its own extensive help file, and web-based documentation is also available. Features AutoHotkey scripts can be used to launch programs, open documents, emulate keystrokes, Unicode characters, and mouse clicks and movements. AutoHotkey scripts can also assign, retrieve, and manipulate variables, run loops and manipulate windows, files, and folders. These commands can be triggered by a hotkey, such as a script that would open an internet browser whenever the user presses on the keyboard. Keyboard keys can also be remapped or disabled, such that pressing , for example, might result in the active window receiving an en dash (-), or nothing at all. AutoHotkey also allows for 'hotstrings' that will automatically replace certain text as it is typed; the most typical use for hotstrings is expanding abbreviations, such as assigning the string \\"btw\\" to produce the text \\"by the way\\" when typed, or the text \\"%o\\" to produce \\"percentage of\\". Further, some scripts can be initiated automatically at computer startup and need not interact with the keyboard at all, perhaps performing file manipulation at a set interval. More complex tasks can be achieved with custom data entry forms (GUI windows), working with the system registry, or using the Windows API by calling functions from DLLs. The scripts can be compiled into an executable file that can be run on other computers that do not have AutoHotkey installed. The source code is in C++ and can be compiled with Visual Studio Express. Memory access through pointers is allowed just as in C. Some uses for AutoHotkey: * Remapping the keyboard, such as from QWERTY to Dvorak or other alternative keyboard layouts. * Using shortcuts to fill in frequently-used file names or other phrases. * Typing punctuation not provided on the keyboard, such as curved quotes (“…”). * Controlling the mouse cursor with a keyboard or joystick. * Opening programs, documents, and websites with simple keystrokes. * Adding a signature to e-mail, message boards, etc. * Monitoring a system and automatically closing unwanted programs. * Scheduling an automatic reminder, system scan, or backup. * Automating repetitive tasks. * Filling out contest and freebie forms automatically (i.e., it can type in your name, address, etc. automatically). * Prototyping before implementing in another, more time-consuming, programming language. History The first public beta of AutoHotkey was released on November 10, 2003 after author Chris Mallett's proposal to integrate hotkey support into AutoIt v2 failed to generate response from the AutoIt community. So the author began his own program from scratch basing the syntax on AutoIt v2 and using AutoIt v3 for some commands and the compiler. Later, AutoIt v3 switched from GPL to closed source because of \\"other projects repeatedly taking AutoIt code\\" and \\"setting themselves up as competitors.\\" In 2010, AutoHotkey v1.1 (originally called AutoHotkey_L) became the platform for ongoing development of AutoHotkey. In late 2012, it became the official branch. Another port of the program is AutoHotkey.dll. Examples The following script will allow a user to search for a particular word or phrase using Google. After copying text from any application to the clipboard, pressing the configurable hotkey will open the user's default web browser and perform the search. #g::Run http://www.google.com/search?q=%clipboard% The following script defines a hotstring that enables the user to type \\"afaik\\" in any program and have it automatically replaced with \\"as far as I know\\": ::afaik::as far as I know The example below makes replace selected text in an editor with a quoted version of that text. It illustrates the use of functions, arguments and default argument values. ^+q::QuoteSelection() ; Ctrl+Shift+Q QuoteSelection() { selection := GetSelection() ; Get selected text. PasteText(Quote(selection)) ; Quote the text and paste it back. } GetSelection(timeoutSeconds := 0.5) { Clipboard := \\"\\" ; Clear clipboard for ClipWait to function. Send ^c ; Send Ctrl+C to get selection on clipboard. ClipWait %timeoutSeconds% ; Wait for the copied text to arrive at the clipboard. return Clipboard } PasteText(s) { Clipboard := s ; Put the text on the clipboard. Send ^v ; Paste the text with Ctrl+V. } Quote(s) { return \\"\\"\\"\\" . s . \\"\\"\\"\\" }  User-contributed features  There are extensions/interops/inline script libraries available for usage with/from other programming languages: * VB/C# (.NET) * Lua * Lisp * ECL * Embedded machine code * VBScript/JScript (Windows Scripting Host) Other major plugins enable support for: * Aspect-oriented programming ** Function hooks * COM wrappers * Console interaction * Dynamic code generation * HIDs * Internet Explorer automation * GUI creation * Synthetic programming * Web services * Windows event hooks Malware When AutoHotkey is used to make self-contained software for distribution, that software must include the part of AutoHotkey itself that understands and executes AutoHotkey scripts, as it is an interpreted language. Inevitably, some malware has been written using AutoHotkey. When anti-malware products attempt to earmark items of malware that have been programmed using AutoHotkey, they sometimes falsely identify AutoHotkey as the culprit rather than the actual malware.

He was the youngest of five children of Jacques Dominique, Comte de Cassini, famous for completing the map of France, who had succeeded his father as the director of the Paris Observatory. He was also the great-great-grandson of famous Italian-French astronomer, Giovanni Domenico Cassini, discoverer of Jupiter's Great Red Spot and the Cassini division in Saturn's rings. The genus Cassinia was named in his honour by the botanist Robert Brown. He named many flowering plants and new genera in the sunflower family (Asteraceae), many of them from North America. He published 65 papers and 11 reviews in the [Nouveau] Bulletin des Sciences of the Société Philomatique de Paris between 1812 and 1821. In 1825, Cassini placed the North American taxa of Prenanthes (family Asteraceae, tribe Lactuceae) in a new genus Nabalus. In 1828 he named Dugaldia hoopesii for the Scottish naturalist Dugald Stewart (1753-1828).

Its roots date back to ancient times. The differences in the selection of foodstuffs and forms of cooking are most notable between those in mainland and those in coastal regions. Mainland cuisine is more characterized by the earlier Slavic and the more recent contacts with Hungarian and Turkish cuisine, using lard for cooking, and spices such as black pepper, paprika, and garlic. The coastal region bears the influences of the Greek and Roman cuisine, as well as of the later Mediterranean cuisine, in particular Italian (especially Venetian). Coastal cuisines use olive oil, herbs and spices such as rosemary, sage, bay leaf, oregano, marjoram, cinnamon, clove, nutmeg, and lemon and orange rind. Peasant cooking traditions are based on imaginative variations of several basic ingredients (cereals, dairy products, meat, fish, vegetables, nuts) and cooking procedures (stewing, grilling, roasting, baking), while bourgeois cuisine involves more complicated procedures and use of selected herbs and spices. Charcuterie is part of the Croatian culinary tradition in all regions. Food and recipes from other former Yugoslav countries are also popular in Croatia. Croatian cuisine can be divided into several distinct cuisines (Istria, Dalmatia, Dubrovnik, Lika, Gorski Kotar, Zagorje, Međimurje, Podravina, Slavonija) each of which has specific cooking traditions, characteristic for the area and not necessarily well known in other parts of Croatia. Most dishes, however, can be found all across the country, with local variants. Meat and game * Specialities from the grill are called s roštilja, those roasted on the spit s ražnja * pečeno means roasted * prženo means fried * pod pekom means that the dish has been put into a stone oven under a metal cover. The cook puts hot coals on the cover so that the meal is cooked slowly in its own juices. Specialties cooked pod pekom include lamb, veal, and octopus. * na lešo means boiled in broth or water (lamb, beef, fish) – pork from \\"tiblitsa\\" wooden barrel from Međimurje County, northern Croatia Croatian meat-based dishes include: *Pork *Miješano meso or Ražnjići (skewers) *Zagrebački odrezak (Veal steaks stuffed with ham and cheese, breaded and fried) *Šnicle (schnitzel) – breaded veal, pork or chicken cutlets * – pork ham from Međimurje County *Janjetina – roasted lamb garnished with Mediterranean herbs *Odojak – roasted suckling pig *Fresh game from Dalmatia *Visovačka begavica *Turkey with mlinci (flat pasta, soaked in roast juices) *Buncek – smoked pork hock, used in bean, sauerkraut or kale stews *Leg of lamb à la Pašticada *Leg of venison the count's way *Wild duck with sauce *Polpete, faširanci – Frikadeller *Roasted pheasant *Kotlovina from Samobor (kettle with knuckle of pork and other meat and sausages) *Boiled fillet of beef haunch with Sauerkraut *Escalope à la Baron Trenk (spicy-rolled Schnitzel) *Međimurje Goose (stuffed with buckwheat) *Turopolje Goose (with corn semolina as a side dish) *Purgerica Turkey (Christmas dish from the bordering region to Zagreb, turkey filled with chestnuts, apples, bacon, lemons, etc.) *Krvavice, or čurke, blood sausages, made of blood and kaša *Hladetina, a particular type of head cheese *Brački vitalac *Edible dormouse – eaten on the Dalmatian coast according to Bizarre Foods with Andrew Zimmern. Seafood Lobster from Dalmatia Croatian seafood dishes include: *Squid – Croatian: lignje, Italian: calamari, grilled, fried, stuffed or prepared as stew and served with polenta *Octopus salad – Croatian: salata od hobotnice; octopus can also be prepared brudet style, with red wine, or baked pod pekom *Cuttlefish risotto – Croatian: Crni rižot, Italian: Risotto nero *Tuna *Scampi – Croatian: škampi, Italian: scampi *Common mussels – Croatian: dagnje *Salted cod is imported, but dishes are very popular for Christmas Eve or on Good Friday. It can be prepared either as bakalar na bijelo (Dubrovnik, Dalmatia and Istria, with olive oil and garlic, with or without potatoes), or as bakalar na crveno, in tomato-based stew, with potatoes. *Fish stew – Croatian brodet or brudet (Dubrovnik and Dalmatia), Italian brodetto, best made with several type of fish (red rascasse, European conger, monkfish, European hake) *Clams *Sea spider salad *Breaded catfish or carp *Grilled sardines or other fish (na gradele) *Salted anchovies or sardine (slana riba) are served as hors d'oeuvres or as a part of light supper with povrće na lešo, salads etc. *Buzara or buzzara (shellfish sautéed in garlic, olive oil, parsley & white wine) * Date shells or prstaci are part of the traditional cuisine, but in the 20th century their extraction was banned as a measure of ecological protection Stews Stewed vegetables with a small amount of meat or sausages (varivo or čušpajz) is perceived as a healthy, traditional meal. Sour cream (in Northern Croatia) or olive oil (on the coast) can be added to the plate just before serving. Stewed meat dishes are often prepared by men in open spaces, following hunting and shepherding traditions. In Dalmatian urban cuisine, spices such as cinnamon and clove, dried plums, dried figs, apples and other fruit are sometimes added to meat stews. Goulash is very popular in most parts of Croatia *Goulash (Croatian: gulaš, see also Hungarian gulyás) *Grah – pork hock bean stew (often done as grah i zelje – with sauerkraut, or grah s kiselom repom – with pickled turnip strings) *Varivo od mahuna – green beans stew *Riblji paprikaš – also called fiš-paprikaš (spicy fish stew from Slavonia, see also Hungarian halászlé) *Slavonska riblja čorba (fish stew from Slavonia) *Brudet (or Brodet) – fish stew *Chicken stew *Rabbit goulash *Ričet, also known as jačmik, orzo *Istrian stew (Jota) *Pašta fažol – bean stew with small pasta *Game Čobanac (Shepherd's Stew) *Feines Venison goulash with prunes *Hunter's stew *Wine goulash *Sauerkraut stew *Zelena menestra – traditional cabbage and meat dish – Dubrovnik and surrounding area *Pašticada – Dalmatian beef stew with prunes and dried figs *Tripe stew (tripice, fileki)  Pasta  Pasta is one of the most popular food items in Croatian cuisine, especially in the region of Dalmatia. Manistra na pome (pasta with tomato sauce) is a staple. The other popular sauces include creamy mushroom sauce, minced meat sauce and many others. Fresh pasta (, ) is added to soups and stews, or prepared with cottage cheese, cabbage, even with walnuts or poppy seed. Potato dough is popular, not only for making (gnocchi), but also for making plum or cheese dumplings which are boiled, and then quickly fried in breadcrumbs and butter. * Žganci – cornmeal dish in Slovenian and Northern Croatian cuisine, also known as polenta (palenta, pura) in Istria and Dalmatia * Gnocchi, often served with pašticada or goulash * Fuži, a typical pasta from Istria * Needle macaroni *Štrukli – baked or cooked filled pastry from Zagorje, Zagreb area. *Krpice sa zeljem – pasta with stewed cabbage *Šporki makaruli – traditional pasta with cinnamon-flavored meat sauce, from Dubrovnik and surrounding area File:Mlinci.jpgMlinci File:Kuhane_strukle_0210_1.jpgZagorski Štrukli File:Ajdovi_zganci.JPGŽganci  Soups  Soup is an integral part of a meal in Croatia and no Sunday family meal or any special occasion will go without it. The most popular soups are broth-based, with added pasta or semolina dumplings. They are usually light in order to leave space for the main course and dessert to follow. However, cream or roux-based soups are also popular, and there are many local variations of traditional soups. In Dalmatia, fish soup with fish chunks, carrots and rice is commonly served. *Maneštra *Veal soup with smoked meat *Beef broth with vermicelli pasta *Mushroom soup, especially with porcini *Dill soup *Zagorska juha with porcini mushrooms, bacon, sweet pepper *Prežgana juha *Chicken soup  Side dishes  *Sataraš (sliced and stewed summer vegetables) *Mlinci (typical northwest Croatian, roasted flatbread, similar to Caucasian flatbreads) *Đuveč (baked summer vegetables, similar to Ratatouille) *Šalša od pomidora (tomato salsa) *Restani krumpir (cooked potato fried with onion) *Blitva s krumpirom (cooked chard and potato, with olive oil and garlic) *Povrće na lešo (boiled vegetables seasoned with olive oil, salt and sometimes garlic) is a common way of preparing chard, kale, cabbage, green beans, potato, cauliflower, carrots, broad beans, zucchini and other vegetables as a side dish.

Each of the main regions is divided into sub-regions which are divided yet further into smaller vinogorje, (literally wine hills) and districts. Altogether, there are more than 300 geographically-defined wine- producing areas in Croatia. In parts of Croatia, wine, either red or white, is sometimes consumed mixed in approximately equal proportions with water.

Coffee  Croatia is a country of coffee drinkers (on average 5kg per person annually), not only because it was formerly part of the Austrian-Hungarian Empire, but also because it bordered the former Ottoman Empire. Traditional coffee houses similar to those in Vienna are located throughout Croatia.  Mineral water  Regarding its water resources, Croatia has a leading position in Europe. Concerning water quality, Croatian water is greatly appreciated all over the world. Due to a lack of established industries there have also been no major incidents of water pollution. *Jamnica – Winner of the Paris AquaExpo for best mineral water of 2003 *Lipički studenac *Jana – also belongs to Jamnica, best aromatized mineral water (Eauscar 2004)  Juices and syrups  *Badel *Jamnica *Maraska *Dona *Vindija juices – Vindi sokovi *Cedevita See also * Croatian wine References Further reading  * \\"Hrvatska za stolom – mirisi i okusi Hrvatske\\", Ivanka Biluš et al., Zagreb:Alfa, Koprivnica: Podravka, 1996, 192 p., illustrated in color, (Biblioteka Anima Croatarum, 2) *\\"Hrvatska vina\\" (Croatian wines), Fazinić Nevenko, Milat Vinko, illustrated, 159 p., 1994, *\\"Nova hrvatska kuhinja\\" (New Croatian cuisine), Davor Butković, Ana Ugarković, Profil international, Zagreb, 2005, 272 p., *.

The AMS also publishes an associated online bibliographic database called MathSciNet which contains an electronic version of Mathematical Reviews and additionally contains citation information for over 3.5 million items as of 2018.  Reviews  Mathematical Reviews was founded by Otto E. Neugebauer in 1940 as an alternative to the German journal Zentralblatt für Mathematik, which Neugebauer had also founded a decade earlier, but which under the Nazis had begun censoring reviews by and of Jewish mathematicians. The goal of the new journal was to give reviews of every mathematical research publication. As of November 2007, the Mathematical Reviews database contained information on over 2.2 million articles. The authors of reviews are volunteers, usually chosen by the editors because of some expertise in the area of the article. It and Zentralblatt für Mathematik are the only comprehensive resources of this type. (The Mathematics section of Referativny Zhurnal is available only in Russian and is smaller in scale and difficult to access.) Often reviews give detailed summaries of the contents of the paper, sometimes with critical comments by the reviewer and references to related work. However, reviewers are not encouraged to criticize the paper, because the author does not have an opportunity to respond. The author's summary may be quoted when it is not possible to give an independent review, or when the summary is deemed adequate by the reviewer or the editors. Only bibliographic information may be given when a work is in an unusual language, when it is a brief paper in a conference volume, or when it is outside the primary scope of the Reviews. Originally the reviews were written in several languages, but later an \\"English only\\" policy was introduced. Selected reviews (called \\"featured reviews\\") were also published as a book by the AMS, but this program has been discontinued.  Online database  In 1980, all the contents of Mathematical Reviews since 1940 were integrated into an electronic searchable database. Eventually the contents became part of MathSciNet, which was officially launched in 1996. MathSciNet also has extensive citation information.Mathematical Reviews database  Mathematical citation quotient  Mathematical Reviews computes a \\"mathematical citation quotient\\" (MCQ) for each journal. Like the impact factor, this is a numerical statistic that measures the frequency of citations to a journal.\\"Citation Database Help Topics\\", Mathematical Reviews. Accessed 2011-1-13 The MCQ is calculated by counting the total number of citations into the journal that have been indexed by Mathematical Reviews over a five-year period, and dividing this total by the total number of papers published by the journal during that five-year period.

It may be done with a machine designed for this purpose, or by connecting two different machines: one to play back and one to record the signal. The purpose of dubbing may be simply to make multiple copies of audio programs, or it may be done to preserve programs on old media which are deteriorating and may otherwise be lost. One type of dubbing device combines two different storage media, such as an audio cassette deck that incorporates a Compact Disc recorder. Such a device enables the transfer of audio programs from an obsolete medium to a widely used medium. It may also simply be used to transfer material between two types media which are popular in different settings, so that material originating in one type of environment can be used in another. An example of the latter would be the dubbing of a Digital BetaCam videocassette to DVD. Another type of dubbing device is designed to rapidly produce many copies of a program. It may combine a single playback unit with multiple recording units to simultaneously create two, four, eight, sixteen, or more copies during the playback of a single original program. This type of device can often perform the copying process at many times the standard playback speed. Typical multiplexed dubbing decks of either analog (cassette) or digital (CD) programs can operate at 48 times the standard playback speed, thus producing complete copies of a program in sixty or ninety seconds. Sometimes this high-speed dubbing incurs some loss of quality compared to the best normal (1×) speed dub. The verb \\"dub\\" as used here long predates and is unrelated to the Jamaican musical style dub music; the origin of both words stems from the dubplate. It is also different with the term dubbing, which is mostly a type of frottage dance usually found in the Caribbean clubs. Victor S/8  Victor S/8 marking Some of the earliest dubbings were made by the Victor Talking Machine Co. In 1916, Victor developed an acoustical dubbing process to create new masters from pressings where damage had occurred to the originals. Such dubbings are marked with the symbol “s/8” stamped in the inner rim. These are occasionally (but not always) noted in the New York files. Pressings made from these dubbed masters are sonically inferior to the originals.

It was written and directed by Stephen Poliakoff, and starred Michael Gambon, who won a British Academy Television Award for his performance, Lindsay Duncan, Matthew Macfadyen, Claire Skinner, and Toby Stephens. The drama received two Royal Television Society awards and a Peabody Award. The action takes place during a large family reunion at a hotel. It aired on BBC America under the title Almost Strangers. Summary The series is set over a three-day family reunion of considerably more than a hundred guests, that draws together the extended branches of the Symon family. Raymond Symon (Michael Gambon) reluctantly attends with his wife Esther (Jill Baker) and son Daniel (Matthew Macfadyen), who was not aware of the sprawl of his extended family because of his father's estrangement from his relatives. The stories Daniel learns about his family's past are episodic and non-linear, from his mysterious presence in a photograph taken at a children's party that he can't remember attending, to the wartime experiences of three distant elderly cousins. An important plot strand concentrates on a rift between two cousins (Claire Skinner and Toby Stephens) and their aunt (Lindsay Duncan) that has grown since the sudden death of the cousins' brother and Daniel's attempts to reunite the trio. An early incident of Raymond suffering a stroke while giving a withering speech to the reunion-goers and his subsequent bedridden state force him to appreciate the character of relatives that reflect his. Poliakoff's use of old photographs to unlock the intricacies of individuals' lives is prolific.

It is the administrative centre of the homonymous Batak Municipality. As of December 2009, the town has a population of 3,498 inhabitants. Bulgarian National Statistical Institute - towns in 2009  Geography  Batak Panorama Batak dam. Batak is situated in the northwestern slopes of the Rhodope Mountains, at 1036 m above sea level. It is surrounded by many peaks, clad with century-old pine and spruce forests. The climate is temperate continental with a characteristic southern warm wind. Batak was pronounced town in 1964 and has a population of 4,019 people. Batak is a centre of one of Bulgaria's largest municipalities by terms of territory - 667 km2 or 15% of the Pazardzhik Province area - as well as one of the most sparsely populated ones including only the town itself and two villages - Fotinovo and Nova Mahala. Ninety percent of the municipal area is covered with thick forests. Batak is situated at 15 km to the south of Peshtera and 33 km to the south of the regional centre Pazardzhik. The nearest railway station is in Peshtera.  History = Antiquity  The Russian church in Batak. The Balinova house. The monument of Trendafil Balinov. The church in Batak. Batak, the old church. There are numerous archaeological monuments of most ancient times in the region of Batak. A find of the Old Stone Age was discovered in 1958. Tools, objects, ceramic vessels, ornaments as well as bones of rhinoceros were found which proves that the climate was warmer in the Quaternary. Twenty Thracian, Thraco-Roman, Byzantine and Slavic fortresses, churches and monasteries, as well as Thracian mounds, Roman bridges, mines, mills and other archaeological sites were registered.  Origin of the settlement and medieval history  The exact origin of Batak is unknown, since there is a lack of historical data. The earlier view that the settlement was founded by Bulgarians who escaped from the forced mass conversion into Islam in the valley of Chepino in 16th century today is rejected because it is believed that the settlement is much older. This is justified by an inscription on the fountain of Virgin Mary Monastery of Krichim built by the people of Batak in 1592, a writ of the feudal possessions of Sultan Suleiman I (1520–1566), in which the village of Batak is also mentioned, as well as the remnants of many churches and monasteries burnt down by the Ottomans during the conversion into Islam in this region. The origin of the name of Batak is not certain, too. In the old legends it is related to the Tsepina chieftain Batoy, while the history professors Yordan Ivanov and Vasil Mikov suppose that Batak was Potok, a settlement of Cuman origin existing between the 11th and the 13th century. It is, however, certain that the name of the village is Bulgarian, not Turkish as some authors assert.  Ottoman rule  During the centuries of Ottoman rule, many hajduks in the region of Batak took revenge from the Turks for the outrages upon Bulgarian people – Strahil Voivoda, Deli Arshenko Payaka, Gola Voda, Todor Banchev, Beyko, Yanko Kavlakov, Mityo Vranchev, etc. From these times have remained the old rebel names, such as Haydushka Skala, Haydushka Polyana, Haydushko Kladenche (spring), Sablen Vrah (\\"Sabre Peak\\"), Karvav Chuchur (\\"Bloody Spout\\"), as well as many legends. Woodworking, trade and innkeeping were developed in Batak during the National Revival. The prosperity of the population was conducive to the prosperity of education — a secular school was opened in 1835 and the St. Nedelya Church was built in 1813 at the Todor Balinov place (mayor of the village at the time), donated by him specifically for the construction of the church. Built for 75 days with the work of citizens of Batak.. Batak has given many eminent figures of the Bulgarian Revival, such as clerics like archimandrite Yosif, Nikifor, Kiril and others, who worked in the Rila Monastery, a centre of the Bulgarian National Revival. Famous men of letters are Georgi Busilin and Dragan Manchov.  April Uprising and Ottoman war-crimes  Monument in Batak Icon of the Saints from Batak The population of Batak took part in the April Uprising of 1876. The people of Batak rebelled on 22 April under the leadership of voivoda Petar Goranov. On 30 April the village was surrounded by Ottoman irregulars called bashi-bozouk, pomaks from the surrounding villages. The battles were carried on for five days. The last stronghold of the rebels was the St. Nedelya Church. At the end five thousand people were killed and the village was burned down to ashes. News of the atrocities spread around the world, aided in large part by Januarius MacGahan's writing for the London Daily News . The public outcry created favourable conditions for Russia to declare war on Turkey. On 20 January 1878 the people of Batak who had survived the uprising enthusiastically met the advancing Russian army.  Batak today  City hall in Batak Today Batak is a renovated modern town famous for its historical monuments and a resort and tourist centre. A key hydro power system — Batashki Vodnosilov Pat — with five dams and three hydroelectric stations was constructed in the 1950s.

The suovetaurilia or suovitaurilia was one of the most sacred and traditional rites of Roman religion: the sacrifice of a pig (sus), a sheep (ovis) and a bull (taurus) to the deity Mars to bless and purify land (Lustratio). The ritual is preserved in Cato the Elder's De Agri Cultura, \\"On Agriculture\\". The first step was to lead the three animals around the boundaries of the land to be blessed, pronouncing the following words: :Cum divis volentibus quodque bene eveniat, mando tibi, Mani, uti illace suovitaurilia fundum agrum terramque meam quota ex parte sive circumagi sive circumferenda censeas, uti cures lustrare. :\\"That with the good help of the gods success may crown our work, I bid thee, Manius, to take care to purify my farm, my land, my ground with this suovetaurilia, in whatever part thou thinkest best for them to be driven or carried around.\\" \\"Manius\\" in this passage may be an obscure minor deity, related to the Manes, or may be the equivalent of English John Doe. Then, before the sacrifice is performed, the following prayer to Mars must be made: :Mars pater, te precor quaesoque uti sies volens propitius mihi domo familiaeque nostrae, quoius re ergo agrum terram fundumque meum suovitaurilia circumagi iussi, uti tu morbos visos invisosque, viduertatem vastitudinemque, calamitates intemperiasque prohibessis defendas averruncesque; utique tu fruges, frumenta, vineta virgultaque grandire beneque evenire siris, pastores pecuaque salva servassis duisque bonam salutem valetudinemque mihi domo familiaeque nostrae; harumce rerum ergo, fundi terrae agrique mei lustrandi lustrique faciendi ergo, sicuti dixi, macte hisce suovitaurilibus lactentibus inmolandis esto; Mars pater, eiusdem rei ergo macte hisce suovitaurilibus lactentibus esto :\\"Father Mars, I pray and beseech thee that thou be gracious and merciful to me, my house, and my household; to which intent I have bidden this suovetaurilia to be led around my land, my ground, my farm; that thou keep away, ward off, and remove sickness, seen and unseen, barrenness and destruction, ruin and unseasonable influence; and that thou permit my harvests, my grain, my vineyards, and my plantations to flourish and to come to good issue, preserve in health my shepherds and my flocks, and give good health and strength to me, my house, and my household. To this intent, to the intent of purifying my farm, my land, my ground, and of making an expiation, as I have said, deign to accept the offering of these suckling victims; Father Mars, to the same intent deign to accept the offering of these suckling offering.\\" The original Latin of this prayer is crudely metrical and incantatory; even in Old Latin, the prayer contains many rhetorical figures such as alliteration and liberal use of merisms and antithesis. It illustrates the sing-song, metrical, and poetic format of polytheistic prayers. Cakes of bread were sacrificed along with the three animals. At the moment the sacrifices were made, the landowner was to say: :Eiusque rei ergo macte suovitaurilibus inmolandis esto. :\\"To this intent deign to accept the offering of these victims.\\" If favourable omens as a response to the sacrifice were not forthcoming, the landowner was instructed to redo the sacrifice and offer a further prayer: :Mars pater, siquid tibi in illisce suovitaurilibus lactentibus neque satisfactum est, te hisce suovitaurilibus piaculo. :\\"Father Mars, if aught hath not pleased thee in the offering of those sucklings, I make atonement with these victims.\\" If only one or two of the omens expected after the three sacrifices failed to appear, the landowner was instructed to offer an additional swine, saying: :Mars pater, quod tibi illoc porco neque satisfactum est, te hoc porco piaculo. :\\"Father Mars, inasmuch as thou wast not pleased by the offering of that pig, I make atonement with this pig.\\" The nature of the expected omens is not given by Cato. The omens, however, were likely determined by the art of haruspicy, the examination of the entrails, and especially the livers, of sacrificed animals for divinatory signs. Both public and private suovetaurilias were performed in the Roman religion. Cato describes the ritual performed to purify, or \\"lustrate\\", a farm. A private rural suovetaurilia was sacrificed each May on the festival of Ambarvalia, a festival that involved \\"walking around the fields.\\" Public suovetaurilias were offered at certain state ceremonies, including agricultural festivals, the conclusion of a census, and to atone for any accidental ritual errors. Traditionally, suovetaurilias were performed at five year intervals: this period was called a lustrum, and the purification sought by a suovetaurilia was called lustration. Suovetaurilia in a military setting, from Trajan's Column Right hand panel of The Bridgeness Slab showing a suovetaurilia. If a temple were destroyed, the site of the temple must be purified by a suovetaurilia before a new temple could be reconstructed on the site. When the Capitolium was burnt as a result of a struggle for imperial succession in the year 69, a suovetaurilia was performed to reconsecrate the site. A public suovetaurilia was also offered to bless the army before a major military campaign. On Trajan's column, the emperor Trajan is depicted as offering a suovetaurilia to purify the Roman army. A suovetaurilia is shown on the right hand panel of The Bridgeness Slab. It was suggested that the sacrifice might have been made at the start of the building of the Antonine Wall. Some religious rites similar to the Roman suovetaurilia were practiced by a few other Indo-European peoples, from Iberia to India. The Cabeço das Fráguas inscript (found in Portugal) describes a threefold sacrifice practiced by the Lusitanians, devoting a sheep, a pig and a bull to what may have been local gods. In the Indian Sautramani, a ram, a bull and a goat were sacrificed to Indra Sutraman; in Iran ten thousand sheep, a thousand cattle and a hundred stallions were dedicated to Ardvi Sura Anahita. Similar to the above rituals is the Greek trittoíai, the oldest known being described in the Odyssey and dedicated to Poseidon. The philosopher and historian Plutarch related in the Lives Of The Noble Greeks And Romans a story from the life of Pyrrhus about the sacrifice of a ram, a pig and a bull. The Umbrian Iguvine Tables also describe a sacrificial ritual related to the aforementioned rites. ReferencesBibliography *Watkins, Calvert.

In 1944, retreating German troops destroyed its four-latticed mast antenna system which was used in conjunction with the existing 900 kilowatt(kW) transmitter. On 19 October 1952 a new long wave transmitter with an output of 250 kW was put into service at Allouis. It featured three special prism aerials, which were suspended between steel framework mastsat a height of 308 meters. Transmitting power was increased to 600 kW in 1957, to 1,000 kW in 1974 and to 2,000 kW in 1981. The system attains its full transmitting potential during daylight hours. The antenna system underwent extensive conversion in 1974. The prism aerials were removed and antenna masts were increased to a height of 350 meters. In addition, a second 350-meter high mast was built to provide better coverage within France. Since 1977, the Allouis transmitter also transmits standard time signals for AMDS. Wave frequencies are generated on the basis of an atomic clock located in the transmitter station and serves for calibration frequency purposes.

R. Martin, and its television adaptation Game of Thrones. He is a prominent point of view character in the novels. Davos first appears in 1998's A Clash of Kings and later in A Storm of Swords (2000) and A Dance with Dragons (2011), serving as Stannis Baratheon's most trusted counselor. Davos comes from humble means and was a successful smuggler, who slipped through Targaryen loyalists' blockade to bring a shipful of much-needed supplies to Stannis and his starving forces defending the castle Storm's End during Robert's Rebellion. As appreciation for saving his men, Stannis raised him up as a knight and a vassal lord, but personally cut off the fingertips of Davos' left hand to punish for the criminal career of smuggling. Davos considers the treatments fair, and is stubbornly loyal to Stannis, but fears the growing influence of the red priestess Melisandre. He forms a close fatherly relationship with Stannis' disfigured daughter Shireen. Davos is portrayed by Irish actor Liam Cunningham in the HBO television adaptation. Character=Background Davos is of low birth, being born to the life of a poor commoner in King's Landing's Flea Bottom. In his youth, he became one of the most infamous smugglers of the Seven Kingdoms, often piloting his black-sailed ship into harbors in the dead of night, and navigated treacherous shallows. He married a woman named Marya, with whom he had seven sons: Dale, Allard, Matthos, Maric, Devan, Stannis and Steffon. At the time of Robert Baratheon's rebellion, Davos evaded the blockade of Shipbreaker Bay and smuggled a shipment of onions and salted fish into Storm's End to Stannis Baratheon and his men, who were starving under siege by Mace Tyrell and the Redwynes. The food that Davos brought allowed Stannis's men to hold on for almost a year until Eddard Stark arrived to relieve the siege. As a reward for this service, Stannis knighted Davos and awarded him nobility status with choice lands on Cape Wrath, for which Davos choose \\"Seaworth\\" as the name of his new house. However, also as a punishment for his years of criminal activity as a smuggler, Stannis personally \\"shortened\\" Davos's left hand, cutting off the first joint from each finger. Despite this, Davos found Stannis's ruling fair and just, and kept the bones of his severed fingertips in a pouch hung around his neck as a lucky charm. Character Davos is humble but very loyal to Stannis, due to the life and opportunities that Stannis' knighting him presented to Davos and his family, despite sometimes disagreeing with Stannis's methods. Davos is a devout believer in the Faith of the Seven, which puts him at odds with the red priestess Melisandre and the Queen's Men, who worship the eastern religion of R'hllor. Davos tries to always be honest to Stannis, speaking his mind instead of saying what Stannis wants to hear, which earns him Stannis' silent respect in return. Storylines Coat of arms of Davos Seaworth  A Clash of Kings  Due to Joffrey Baratheon's illegitimacy, Stannis names himself heir to his brother King Robert Baratheon. Davos supports him, though he dislikes Stannis converting to R'hllor under the red priestess Melisandre. Davos is sent to deliver letters declaring Queen Cersei's children were born of incest, so they cannot claim the Iron Throne. However Stannis receives little assistance from other noble lords. Davos sails with Stannis to besiege Storm's End when Stannis's younger brother Renly has also declared himself king and tries to defeat and kill Stannis, but is killed by a \\"shadow\\" birthed by Melisandre. The castellan of Storm's End, Ser Cortnay Penrose, refuses to surrender Storm's End. Davos advises attacking King's Landing before taking Storm's End, but Stannis fears that the stormlords will not follow him if he appears defeated. Davos personally escort Melisandre, about whom he already has misgivings, into the caverns underneath Storm's End, where she births another \\"shadow\\" that assassinates Penrose and allows Stannis to claim Edric Storm, his illegitimate nephew via Robert. Davos is given command of a ship at the Battle of the Blackwater, though he disagrees with their commander, Stannis's brother-in-law Ser Imry Florent. Tyrion Lannister, who is Iron Throne's acting Hand of the King in charge of defending King's Landing, traps Stannis' vanguard fleet with a river chain and destroys much of them with wildfire. Davos's four oldest sons are killed in the ambush, but Davos survives and is washed ashore on the seamounts known as the Spears of the Merling King, losing his \\"luck\\", and is eventually recovered by Stannis' men.  A Storm of Swords  Blaming Melisandre for the loss (due to Tyrion's use of wildfire and Melisandre's religious associations with fire), Davos plots to murder the priestess. However, Melisandre foresees it and Davos is imprisoned by Stannis' uncle-in-law Ser Axell Florent, who also threatens to kill Davos if he does not help Axell become Stannis's Hand of the King. Imprisoned with Davos is Stannis' Hand and uncle-in-law Lord Alester Florent, who was imprisoned for trying to negotiate with the Lannisters behind Stannis' back. Stannis releases Davos to hear his counsel on attacking Claw Isle, and Davos claims that it would be unjust to attack despite Lord Celtigar bending the knee to Joffrey, as its people are innocent and only following their Lord. Pleased by his honesty, Stannis names Davos Hand of the King. Davos then watches a ritual where Stannis uses blood leeched from Edric Storm to curse the three rival kings Joffrey Baratheon, Balon Greyjoy and Robb Stark. After Robb and Balon later die, Stannis and Melisandre consider sacrificing Edric to raise a rumored dragon sleeping under Dragonstone, despite Davos' objection. On hearing of Joffrey's death, Davos smuggles out Edric east to the Free Cities to protect him from Melisandre. Learning to read, Davos comes across a plea for aid from the Night's Watch, and convinces Stannis to sail north and help defending the Wall against an invasion of wildlings fleeing the Others. Atter Stannis makes port at Eastwatch-at-the-Sea to reinforce Castle Black, Davos is sent to White Harbor to persuade Lord Wyman Manderly, the wealthiest and second most powerful Northern lord, to support Stannis' war effort.  A Feast for Crows and A Dance With Dragons  After being abandoned by the Lyseni sellsail Salladhor Saan, the escortless Davos manages to arrive at White Harbor after a much troubled journey, and discovers that the Manderlys are hosting three members of House Frey, who previously betrayed House Starks at the Red Wedding and massacred unarmed northmen loyal to Robb Stark, including Lord Wyman's younger son Ser Wendel Manderly. Alone and disadvantaged, Davos nevertheless claims the North should support Stannis as he will give them vengeance, is imprisoned by Wyman. Wyman then sends word to King's Landing that he has executed Davos as a show of fealty, but in reality executed a criminal vaguely resembling Davos. Davos is kept imprisoned in the Wolf's Den but treated well, and is later released and taken to meet with Wyman in secrecy by Robett Glover, who is also Wyman's secret guest. Wyman apologizes to Davos for the earlier reception and explains that he cannot publicly defy the Lannisters while his only surviving son and heir Ser Wylis is a captive at Harrenhal, but the fake execution has worked and Wylis is being returned home. Wyman implies he plans to murder the three Freys, and reveals that many of the other Northern lords also wish to overthrow House Bolton, who has assumed control of the North after betraying House Stark, but dare not openly defy the Boltons unless a legitimate Stark heir can be found. Wyman also reveals to Davos that he has been harboring Wex Pyke, Theon Greyjoy's mute squire, who is a hidden witness to Ramsay Snow's sacking of Winterfell and secretly followed the fleeing Rickon Stark and Osha, and points out that Rickon is on the fabled cannibal island of Skagos. Wyman then tells Davos if he can successfully retrieve Rickon from Skagos, House Manderly will support Stannis' campaign. TV adaptation Liam Cunningham plays the role of Davos Seaworth in the television series In the HBO series, Davos has the fingers taken from his right hand (as actor Liam Cunningham is left-handed). He references having multiple sons, but only one is seen or included in the story (Matthos).  Season 2  When Renly refuses to surrender to Stannis, Davos is ordered to sail with Melisandre beneath Storm's End. When they reach shore, Davos is horrified when Melisandre gives birth to a shadowy demon, who kills Renly. The stormlords bend the knee to Stannis, who plans to launch a naval attack on King's Landing and gives Davos command of the fleet. As the Baratheon fleet arrives in Blackwater Bay, a ship filled with wildfire is detonated in the middle of the fleet; Davos's ship is one of the closest, and he is thrown into the sea when his ship is destroyed.  Season 3  Davos is revealed to have survived by swimming to a rock, and is rescued by his friend, the pirate Salladhor Saan, who reveals that Matthos died during the Battle of the Blackwater. Grief-stricken by the death of his son, Davos blames Melisandre for Stannis's defeat and unsuccessfully tries to assassinate her before being thrown into the dungeons. During his captivity, Stannis's daughter Shireen discovers that Davos is illiterate and teaches him to read. Stannis eventually releases Davos, naming him as his hand. Soon after, Stannis and Melisandre plot to sacrifice Robert's bastard, Gendry, until Davos frees him and helps him escape Dragonstone. An enraged Stannis resolves to execute Davos, until Davos presents a letter from Castle Black warning of the White Walkers' return. Melisandre corroborates this and counsels Stannis that he will need Davos when the Long Night comes, thus prompting Stannis to pardon Davos.  Season 4  After Joffrey Baratheon's death, Stannis reprimands Davos for not being able to secure more men. Davos arranges a meeting with Tycho Nestoris, a representative of the Iron Bank of Braavos, and persuades him to give their financial backing to Stannis instead. Davos uses the money to hire ships and sellswords and the Baratheon army travels to the Wall, defeating the wildling army besieging it.  Season 5  Davos accompanies the Baratheon forces on their march to Winterfell. During their march, Ramsay Bolton and his men infiltrate the camp and destroy their supplies. Davos is sent back to the Wall to ask for more supplies, unaware that Stannis plans to sacrifice Shireen to assure his victory. Lord Commander Jon Snow, though sympathetic, is unable to offer help. Soon after, Melisandre arrives at Castle Black, having fled in the aftermath of Shireen's sacrifice. Davos realises that Stannis has been defeated and Shireen is dead, though Melisandre does not reveal her role.  Season 6  Davos is the first to discover Jon Snow's body after his assassination, and barricades his body in a storeroom with the help of Jon's loyalists. After the wildlings imprison the mutineers who killed Jon, Davos persuades Melisandre to attempt a resurrection of Jon, which is ultimately successful. Jon's death releases him from his Night's Watch vows and he decides to gather allies to march with him on Winterfell. Davos accompanies him, and is able to convince the young Lady Lyanna Mormont to offer House Mormont's support, though few other houses do the same. During the army's march to Winterfell, Davos finds the remnants of a sacrificial pyre and the burnt remains of the wooden stag he had carved for Shireen as a gift, and realises that she had been sacrificed by Melisandre. Davos initially keeps this revelation to himself, instead participating in the Stark loyalists' victory over the Bolton forces. After the battle has been won and Winterfell retaken, Davos confronts Melisandre. When Melisandre confesses to killing Shireen, Jon exiles her from the North, and Davos threatens to execute her personally if she ever returns. Davos is later among the Northern and Vale lords who crown Jon as the King in the North.  Season 7  Jon receives an invitation from Daenerys Targaryen to come to Dragonstone to bend the knee. Though apprehensive, Jon decides to go to obtain access to Dragonstone's dragonglass mines, taking Davos with him. There, Davos supports Jon's claim that the White Walkers have returned, whilst almost accidentally revealing Jon's resurrection in the process. Daenerys is unconvinced, but permits them to mine the dragonglass as a gesture of goodwill. Daenerys's advisor Tyrion Lannister suggests that Jon go beyond the Wall to capture a wight, to present to Queen Cersei Lannister as evidence of the White Walkers. Davos smuggles Tyrion into King's Landing to arrange a meeting between Cersei, Daenerys and Jon after their return, while Davos seeks out Gendry, who is hiding as a blacksmith in King's Landing. Despite being encouraged to conceal his identity, Gendry reveals his parentage to Jon, and is allowed to join Jon in the journey beyond the Wall. Davos travels with Jon and his party to Eastwatch-by-the-Sea, staying at the castle while the others seek out a wight. Gendry returns in the evening, telling Davos that Jon and his allies are surrounded by the White Walkers and ordering a raven be sent to Dragonstone to request Daenerys's assistance. Daenerys arrives with her dragons to rescue Jon's allies, while Jon flees to Eastwatch on horseback. Davos joins Jon, Daenerys, and Sandor Clegane as they journey to King's Landing. There, they meet Queen Cersei, who is shocked by the wight captured by Jon. Cersei pledges her forces in the fight against the White Walkers, and Davos sails back to Winterfell with Jon, Daenerys, and their army.  Season 8  After arriving at Winterfell, Davos, Tyrion, and Lord Varys discuss the implications of Jon and Daenerys' budding romantic relationship. As the White Walkers approach Winterfell, Davos spends time with Tyrion, Podrick Payne, Brienne of Tarth, Ser Jaime Lannister, and Tormund Giantsbane. Shortly thereafter, the Walkers' army arrives, and Melisandre returns to aid the Northern forces with her fire magic. Before Davos can threaten to execute her, Melisandre tells him she will be dead before dawn. Davos survives the Battle of Winterfell, during which he helps command the Northern army. As dawn breaks, Davos watches as Melisandre removes her enchanted necklace and fades to bones in the snow. In the aftermath, Davos celebrates with the survivors and joins Jon when he marches the bulk of the remaining allied army to face Cersei. In the final episode of the series Davos accompanies Jon into the devastated city of King's Landing, intervening in a futile attempt to prevent the execution of Lannister prisoners by Grey Worm and the Unsullied. He is last seen as a member of King Bran's Small Council, tasked with the rebuilding of fleets and forts.

He played in 19 Test matches and six One Day Internationals for the England cricket team and later coached South Africa, Warwickshire and Pakistan. On 18 March 2007, Woolmer died suddenly in Jamaica, just a few hours after the Pakistan team's unexpected elimination at the hands of Ireland in the 2007 Cricket World Cup. Shortly afterwards, Jamaican police announced that they were opening a murder investigation into Woolmer's death. In November 2007, a jury in Jamaica recorded an open verdict on Woolmer's death. Early life Woolmer was born in the Georgina McRobert Memorial Hospital across the road from the Green Park Stadium in Kanpur, India on 14 May 1948. His father was the cricketer Clarence Woolmer, who represented United Provinces (now Uttar Pradesh) in the Ranji Trophy. At the age of 10, Woolmer witnessed Hanif Mohammad scoring 499, setting a world record for the highest score in first-class cricket. Some 35 years later, Woolmer, as coach of Warwickshire County Cricket Club, was watching when the county's batsman Brian Lara passed that mark, setting a new record of 501 not out. Woolmer went to school in Kent, first at Yardley Court in Tonbridge and then The Skinners' School in Tunbridge Wells. When he was 15, Colin Page, the coach and captain of the Kent second XI, converted him from an off-spinner to a medium pace bowler. Woolmer's first job was as a sales representative for ICI, and his first senior cricket was with the Tunbridge Wells club and with Kent's second XI. In 1967 he broke the Kentish Leagues' Bat and trap record for most consecutive strikes between the white posts: 13 in one game. Selection for Kent In 1968, at the age of 20, Woolmer joined the Kent cricket staff and made his championship debut against Essex. His ability to move the ball about at medium-pace was ideally suited to one-day cricket at which he became a specialist. He won his county cap in 1969. Woolmer began his coaching career in South Africa in 1970–71 at the age of 22 and by 1975, when he made his Test debut, he had become a teacher of physical education at a prep school in Kent as well as running his own cricket school – at the time one of the youngest cricket school owners anywhere. Playing career Bob Woolmer played English county cricket for Kent, initially as an all-rounder. He graduated to Test cricket with England in 1975 again, at first, as an all-rounder, having taken a hat-trick for MCC against the touring Australian cricket team with his fast- medium bowling. But he was dropped after his first Test, only reappearing in the final match of the series at The Oval where he scored 149, batting at number five, then the slowest Test century for England against Australia. Further batting success followed over the next two seasons, including two further centuries against Australia in 1977. Rarely for an Englishman since the Second World War, all his Test centuries were made against Australia. Woolmer was also a regular in England ODI cricket from 1972 to 1976. But Woolmer's international career stalled after he joined the World Series break- away group run by Kerry Packer. Though he appeared intermittently in the Test team up to 1981, he never recaptured the form of the mid 1970s. He also took part in the South African rebel tours of 1982, a move that effectively ended his international career. Coaching career Woolmer obtained his coaching qualification in 1968. In South Africa After retiring from first-class cricket in 1984, he emigrated to South Africa, where he coached cricket and hockey at high schools. He also became involved in the Avendale Cricket Club in Athlone, Cape Town. He preferred to join a 'coloured' club rather than a 'white' one in apartheid South Africa. He was an inspiration to Avendale and was instrumental in assisting the club to grow and be successful. Because of him, there is still an annual programme for a talented Avendale cricketer to spend a summer at Lord Wandsworth College in Hampshire. In England He returned to England in 1987 to coach the second eleven at Kent. He went on to coach the Warwickshire County Cricket Club in 1991, the side winning the Natwest Trophy in 1993, and three out of four trophies contested the next year. He continued his success by leading Warwickshire to Natwest and County Championship success in 1995, before taking on the Post of South African National Coach. Woolmer is thought to be the only man to have witnessed both Brian Lara's innings of 501 not out against Durham in 1994 and Hanif Mohammad's 499 in Karachi in 1958.Wisden 1995, p. 17. Coaching methods Woolmer was known for his progressive coaching techniques. He is credited with having made the reverse sweep a more popular shot for batsmen in the 1990s, as well as being one of the first to use computer analysis, and trying to adapt the knowledge of goalkeepers to wicketkeepers in cricket. He later attracted attention at the 1999 World Cup by communicating with his captain Hansie Cronje with an earpiece during matches. The practice was later banned. South Africa He was appointed coach of South Africa in 1994. Initially his team performed poorly, losing all six matches on his first outing in Pakistan. However, in the next five years, South Africa won most of their Test (10 out of 15 series) and One Day International matches (73%). However, the side failed to win either the 1996 World Cup or the 1999 World Cup, despite having the highest ODI success rate among international teams in that period. At the 1996 tournament on the Indian subcontinent, his team won all their preliminary group matches before succumbing to the West Indies in the quarter finals. At the 1999 tournament, South Africa faced Australia in the final match of the Super Six round; Australia needed to win to qualify for the semifinals, whereas South Africa had already done so. Australia boasted a superior recent record in must-win matches against South Africa. Media speculation was focused on Woolmer's team being less adept at handling high pressure situations. In the 1997/98 Australian international season, Australia had lost all four of their qualifying matches against South Africa in a triangular tournament and conceded a 1–0 finals series lead, before recovering to take the series 2–1. The Super Six match saw Australia win the match in the last over, after Herschelle Gibbs dropped Australian captain Steve Waugh in a premature celebration of a catch. Waugh went on to score an unbeaten century and score the winning runs. The semifinal rematch saw a late Australian comeback culminate in a tie, when with match scores level, South African batsmen Lance Klusener and Allan Donald had a mix up, with Donald dropping his bat and being run out. As a result, South Africa were eliminated due to their inferior performance in the earlier matches. and Woolmer resigned. Woolmer was a strong candidate to replace David Lloyd as coach of England in 1999 but wanted a break from cricket and was reluctant to lead England in a tour of South Africa so soon after having relinquished the South African coaching job. Woolmer speaking at a cricket dinner in Cape Town in December 1999 Back to Warwickshire He later returned to Warwickshire, and gained attention when he called for the removal of a life ban on South African captain Hansie Cronje for match-fixing. Woolmer spoke openly about Cronje and match fixing in an interview on the BBC TV programme \\"Panorama\\" in May 2001.Transcript – Panorama: \\"Not Cricket\\" BBC News, 20 May 2001 He then worked for the International Cricket Council in helping with cricket development in countries where the sport was not well established. Pakistan He was appointed coach of the Pakistan team in 2004. This came after Javed Miandad was sacked when the Pakistanis conceded a 2–1 Test and 3–2 ODI series loss on home soil to arch rivals India, their first series win there in two decades. He was feted when his team reversed the result in early 2005 on their return tour to India, drawing the Tests 1–1 and winning the ODI series 4–2. In 2005 Pakistan beat England in a home series immediately after England had beaten the Australian team in England to secure the Ashes. In the home series against India that followed, Woolmer's side were victorious in the Test series, winning it 1–0; however, the side lost the ODI series that followed 4–1. Woolmer's side then beat Sri Lanka 2–0 in a 3 ODI series and achieved a 3rd consecutive Test series win with a 1–0 win in a 2 test series with Sri Lanka. =2006 ball-tampering row= In August 2006, on the eve of Pakistan's Twenty20 international against England in Bristol, Bob Woolmer was forced to defend his reputation when it was claimed Pakistani players lifted the seam of the ball when he was in charge of the team. Former International Cricket Council match referee Barry Jarman alleged that during the 1997 triangular one-day tournament involving South Africa, Zimbabwe and India, a match ball, still in Jarman's possession, that was confiscated after just 16 overs showed evidence of tampering by Woolmer's team. Woolmer could not recall any such incident and he denied advocating ball-tampering. He also indicated that he contacted the match officials from that game who also could not recall any such incident. Woolmer stated in 2006 that he believed that ball-tampering should be allowed in cricket and that a modification to existing laws should be made. Death On 18 March 2007 – the day after Pakistan were knocked out of the 2007 World Cup, and three days before their final game of the tournament – Woolmer was found dead in his hotel room at the Jamaica Pegasus Hotel in Kingston, Jamaica. The initial report was that Woolmer had died of a heart attack. On 22 March, Jamaican police confirmed that an investigation had been launched because of the circumstances of Woolmer's death, based on a report by pathologist Ere Seshaiah that Woolmer had died of asphyxia via manual strangulation. Deputy Police Commissioner Mark Shields led the investigation. On 12 June 2007, Lucius Thomas, the commissioner of the Jamaica Constabulary Force, announced that the investigation had concluded that Woolmer had died of natural causes, and was not murdered as indicated by the earlier pathologist's report. Three independent pathologists' reports commissioned by the police had found that the initial conclusion of manual strangulation was incorrect, and toxicology tests found no evidence of poisoning. The findings of the pathologists, and of Metropolitan Police detectives who had visited Jamaica to assist with the investigation, were reported in the weeks leading up to the announcement, which was widely expected by the time it was made. Reports suggested that Woolmer suffered from health problems including an enlarged heart and diabetes, which may have contributed to his death. On 6 November, coroner Patrick Murphy asked for further tests to be carried out on samples taken from Woolmer's body following discrepancies in the toxicology reports by forensic scientists from the Caribbean and the UK.Coroner calls for further tests on Woolmer's body ESPN cricinfo, 6 November 2007 After hearing twenty-six days of evidence, the jury at the inquest returned an open verdict, refusing to rule out the controversial strangulation theory put forward by Ere Seshaiah.Police close Woolmer case after open verdict ABC, 30 November 2007 In an interview with Fox News, former South African cricketer Clive Rice claimed that Woolmer was murdered by organised crime groups, saying \\"These mafia betting syndicates do not stop at anything and they do not care who gets in their way\\". Former Australian captain Ian Chappell has also gone on record stating that he \\"doubts that he died of natural causes\\" and speculated that Woolmer may have been about to reveal \\"some misgivings\\".

It is the administrative centre of the homonymous Belene Municipality. The town is situated on the right bank of the Danube river, close to the town of Svishtov. As of December 2009, it has a population of 8,905 inhabitants. Bulgarian National Statistical Institute - towns in 2009 Belene was proclaimed a town in 1964, Bulgarian National Statistical Institute - Belene in 1964 which is celebrated every year in the first week of September with a market and cultural events. The place is best known for the Belene prison (formerly a concentration camp) on Belene Island where thousands of innocent Bulgarians found their deaths during the communist dictatorship, and as the proposed site of Bulgaria's second nuclear power plant, which has been under construction east of the town. Although about 40% of construction worked and 80% of equipment deliveries for the first unit had been completed in 1991, construction was suspended owing to a lack of financial resources. In 2002, the Government decided to resume the Belene NPP Project and in 2005, the Council of Ministers issued a decision for construction of two 1000 MW units. However, the Council of Ministers decision about the Belene NPP Project was subsequently suspended in 2012. In 2018, the Minister of Energy was assigned to again explore possibilities for construction of the Belene NPP. until it was interrupted in 1990 due to the severe economic crisis that followed the fall of communism in the country. There are plans to start construction again as a replacement for reactors 3 and 4 at Kozloduy Nuclear Power Plant, which Bulgaria shut down as a condition for EU membership. The total capacity of the two reactors will be 2,000 MW. The main confessions in the town are Roman Catholicism and Eastern Orthodoxy, with two Roman Catholic and one Orthodox church being present. The Catholic Church of the Blessed Virgin Mary was built in 1860, the Eastern Orthodox Church of St George in 1874 and the Catholic Church of Saint Anthony of Padua was constructed in 1893. Belene was the focal point for the feature documentary film The Mosquito Problem and Other Stories by Andrey Paounov The Mosquito Problem & other stories The film features many of the town's colourful characters, highlighting their daily plight of a nuclear plant of empty promises and a year-round mosquito epidemic.

It is a part of the Emerald Necklace system of parks, and is bounded by Charles Street and Boston Common to the east, Beacon Street to the north, Arlington Street and Back Bay to the west, and Boylston Street to the south. The Public Garden was the first public botanical garden in America. History Boston's Back Bay, including the land the garden sits on, was mudflats until filling began in the early 1800s. The land of the Public Garden was the earliest filled, as the area that is now Charles Street had been used as a ropewalk since 1796. The town of Boston granted ropemakers use of the land on July 30, 1794,Report on the Proceedings of the City Council of Boston, 1875 after a fire had destroyed the ropewalks in a more populated area of the city. As a condition of its use, the ropewalk's proprietors were required to build a seawall and fill in the land which is now Charles Street and the land immediately bordering it (now a part of the Public Garden). Much of the landfill material came from Mount Vernon, formerly a hill in the Beacon Hill area of Boston. Initially, gravel and soil were brought from the hill to the landfill area by handcart. By 1804, a gravity railroad had been constructed to rapidly bring material from the top of the hill to the marsh; today, Mount Vernon no longer exists, having been completely removed to be used as landfill for the Back Bay. In February 1824, the city of Boston purchased back the land granted to the ropemakers, for a cost of $50,000.Report on the Proceedings of the City Council of Boston, 1875. The next year, a proposal to turn the land into a graveyard was defeated by a vote of 1632 to 176. The Public Garden was established in 1837, when philanthropist Horace GrayHorace Gray: Father of the Boston Public Garden petitioned for the use of land as the first public botanical garden in the United States. By 1839, a corporation was formed, called Horace Gray and Associates, and made the \\"Proprietors of the Botanic Garden in Boston.\\"Newman p 23 The corporation was chartered with creating what is now the Boston Public Garden. Nonetheless, there was constant pressure for the land to be sold to private interests for the construction of new housing. The year that Boston's Public Garden opened, Mr. John Fottler, Sr., dubbed \\"the Father of Our Parks\\", delivered the first load of plants ever set at the gardens, from the Hon. Marshall P. Wilder of Dorchester.http://www.dorchesteratheneum.org/page.php?id=405 While most of the land of the present-day garden had been filled in by the mid-1800s, the area of the Back Bay remained an undeveloped tidal basin. In 1842, the state legislature created The Commissioners on Boston Harbor and the Back Bay, in order to determine how to best develop the land; the state wanted to control the lands and to build an upper-class neighborhood in the area beyond the Public Garden. The City of Boston petitioned the state to grant control over the basin (which was controlled by the then-independent city of Roxbury), in hopes of generating significant revenue from any developments that would be built after filling it in. When the state commission rejected Boston's petition, the Boston City Council threatened to sell the garden to housing developers, which would have significantly reduced the desirability of the area for the upper class elite that the state was hoping to attract. The conflict between the City of Boston and the Commonwealth of Massachusetts was finally resolved when the Tripartite Indenture of 1856 was agreed to by both parties and passed a general vote of citizens 6,287 to 99.Stevens p 345 In the agreement, Boston gave up its rights to build upon the Public Garden; in return, it received a strip of land which is now a part of the garden, abutting Arlington Street.Newman, p.64-65 Drawing of the Public Garden in 1850, facing east. Note the empty foreground: where the Back Bay neighborhood is today, mudflats are seen in this drawing. In October 1859, Alderman Crane submitted the detailed plan for the Garden to the Committee on the Common and Public Squares and received approval.The New England magazine, Volume 24. p.346. New England Magazine Co., 1901 Construction began quickly on the property, with the pond being finished that year and the wrought iron fence surrounding the perimeter erected in 1862. Today the north side of the pond has a small island, but it originally was a peninsula, connected to the land. The site became so popular with lovers that John Galvin, the city forester, decided to sever the connection with the land.Stevens p 347 The landscape was designed by George F. Meacham. The paths and flower beds were laid out by the city engineer, James Slade, and the forester, John Galvin. The plan for the garden included a number of fountains and statues, many of which were erected in the late 1860s. The most notable statue is perhaps that of George Washington, done in 1869 by Thomas Ball, which dominates the western entrance to the park facing Commonwealth Avenue. The signature suspension bridge over the middle of the pond was erected in 1869. Common and garden. Compared to 49 years earlier, the Back Bay is now completely filled in, and the garden much more closely resembles that of today. Common and garden. Gas lamps were originally used to light the garden at night, but in 1883, construction of electric lamps was begun. There was initially concern over the use of electric lamps, as it would require wires to be run through the garden, and some members of government feared that it would harm the aesthetics of the place.Report on the Proceedings of the City Council of Boston, 1883. But as electric lighting replaced gas lighting, and vandalism of the garden – such as the theft and destruction of its flowers – was a growing concern, electric lighting was eventually installed throughout. A flagpole stands today on the eastern side of the garden, close to Charles Street and just south of the main entrance there. The original flagpole was struck by lightning and destroyed in 1918, and in 1920 the city appropriated $2,500 for construction of a new one.Report on the Proceedings of the City Council of Boston, 1920. In 1982, the city granted an additional $25,000 for improvements to the flagpole. A circular granite bench was installed around the pole, with the work being done by the Friends of the Public Garden.Report on the Proceedings of the City Council of Boston, 1982. On January 6, 1913, the City Council placed the garden, along with the Boston Common, under the direct management of the Public Grounds Department of the city. That department declared walking upon the grass of the Common or garden to be illegal, and arrests were made for that offense until at least the 1960s. Today, sitting on the grass is permitted except for specific sections of the lawn where a posted sign forbids access.Posted Rules of the Public Garden. https://www.flickr.com/photos/lindsayhancock/6936393544 Accessed March 19, 2017. In 2008 an automated sprinkler system was installed at a cost of $800,000. Heavy foot traffic, a multitude of plant types, the garden's historical and cultural importance, and a variety of microclimates increased the complexity of the automated system. Originally, the Charles Street side of the Public Garden (along with the adjacent portions of Boston Common) was used as an unofficial dumping ground, due to being the lowest-lying portion of the Garden; this, along with the Garden's originally being a salt marsh, resulted in this edge of the Public Garden being \\"a moist stew that reeked and that was a mess to walk over, steering people to other parts of the park\\". Although plans had long been in place to regrade this portion of the Garden, the cost of moving the amount of soil necessary (approximately , weighing ) prevented the work from being undertaken. This finally changed in the summer of 1895, when the required quantity of soil was made available as a result of the excavation of the Tremont Street Subway, and was used to regrade the Charles Street sides of both the Garden and the Common. The Public Garden is managed jointly between the Mayor's Office, The Parks Department of the City of Boston, and the non-profit Friends of the Public Garden. It was designated a Boston Landmark by the Boston Landmarks Commission in 1977 and declared a National Historic Landmark in 1987. and Description Venus and behind it of George Washington in a stereoscopic image by John P. Soule Swan boats tied up (2017) Together with the Boston Common, the parks form the northern terminus of the Emerald Necklace, a long string of parks designed by Frederick Law Olmsted. While the Common is primarily unstructured open space, the Public Garden contains a pond and a large series of formal plantings that are maintained by the city and others and vary from season to season. Mostly flat and varying in elevation by less than five feet, the garden is designed in the style of an English landscape garden. A straight pathway, including a bridge that crosses over its pond, spans the two main entrances of Charles and Arlington streets; but its pathways are otherwise winding and asymmetrical.Boston Landmarks Commission Study report on the Public Garden, 1975. p12 The Public Garden is rectangular in shape and is bounded on the south by Boylston Street, on the west by Arlington Street, and on the north by Beacon Street where it faces Beacon Hill. On its east side, Charles Street divides the Public Garden from the Common. The greenway connecting the Public Garden with the rest of the Emerald Necklace is the strip of park that runs west down the center of Commonwealth Avenue towards the Back Bay Fens and the Muddy River. The pond During the warmer seasons, the pond is the home of a great many ducks, as well as of one or more swans. A popular tourist attraction is the Swan Boats, which began operating in 1877. For a small fee, tourists can sit on a boat ornamented with a white swan at the rear. The boat is then pedaled around the pond by a tour guide sitting within the swan. The current pair of swans are mute swans named Romeo and Juliet after the Shakespearian couple, however, it was found that both are female. Being no more than three feet deep at its deepest point, the pond easily freezes during the colder months. In 1879, the Boston City Council passed an order to maintain the pond for skating during the winter;Reports of the Proceedings of City Council of Boston; 1879. today, there is an official skating rink maintained at Frog Pond on the Common, instead. The pond represented a significant health concern shortly after it was constructed, as it was fed by a combination of salt water from the Charles River, sewer water, and fresh water from Frog Pond in the Common.Reports of the Proceedings of the City Council of Boston; 1882. As a result, there was often a thick slime present in the pond, and an accompanying stench. Consequently, the caretakers of the garden drain and clean the pond annually.Reports on the Proceedings of the City Council of Boston; 1992 Plantings Permanent flower plantings in the garden include numerous varieties of roses, bulbs, and flowering shrubs. The beds flanking the central pathway are replanted on a rotating schedule throughout the year, with different flowers for each season from mid-spring through early autumn. Plantings are supplied from 14 greenhouses the city operates at Franklin Park for the purpose. The Public Garden is planted with a wide assortment of native and introduced trees; prominent among these are the weeping willows around the shore of the lagoon and the European and American elms that line the garden's pathways, along with horse chestnuts, dawn redwoods, European beeches, ginkgo trees, and one California redwood.

They occur in rivers of the Yucatán Peninsula, Mexico, south through Belize and into northern Guatemala. Their natural habitat is typically shallow, slow-moving, often turbid, water with a pH of 6.5 - 8.0. It has also been reported to live in cave systems. As fish with a tropical distribution, firemouth cichlids live in warm water with a temperature range of 23–30 °C (75–86 °F). The common name, firemouth, is derived from the bright orange-red colouration on the underside of the jaw. Males in particular flare out their gills, exposing their red throats, in a threat display designed to ward off male rivals from their territory. Like most cichlids, brood care is highly developed; this species is an egg-layer. Firemouth cichlids form monogamous pairs and spawn on flattened surfaces of rocks, leaves or submerged wood. Breeding males are primarily responsible for territorial defense, while females are more intensively involved in raising the fry, though both parents lead the fry in search of food. Firemouth cichlids are omnivorous and opportunistic in their feeding strategies. Their ability to protrude their jaw 6% standard length limits their diet to about 6% evasive prey. Sexual dimorphism is present, though limited in this species. Males are generally larger, (up to 15 cm), than females with brighter and more red colouration around the throat, they also have more pointed dorsal and anal fins. Firemouths are suitable for community aquaria, though they may become extremely aggressive to other members of its species and other community fish during spawning.

Geography Belitsa is close to Razlog Municipality, Bansko Municipality, and Yakoruda Municipality. The municipality of Belinitsa is picturesquely situated in the northeastern part of the valley of Razlog and the Blagoevgrad regione, in the dale of the river Mesta, in between the southern slopes of eastern Rila and the northern slopes of the Beliyshko-Videnishki part of the southern Rhodopes. It contains 12 settlements, and 8 of them are scattered in the mountainous area of the Rhodopes. The municipal centre, Belitsa, is located in the southern part of the Rila mountains and is connected to the route Razlog-Velingrad (with international E79 and E80) but off to the side by 4 kilometres. This makes for easy transportation from the town to Sofia (172 kilometres away) and Blagoevgrad (72 kilometres away). History The exarchal school in Belitsa, St. St. Cyril and Methodius The area of Belitsa first fell into the hands of the Roman Empire. The Romans made many settlements larger in the Razlog valley and led Hellenized and Romanized colonists into them. Belitsa is recorded for the first time in a record from the Tatarpazardzhiyska province (kaaza) in the Ottoman Empire in 1516 under the name Belitsa, together with Little Belitsa (, Malka Belitsa).Бойков, Григор.

Construction was unusually slow because of the unwillingness of the then-in-power Turkish local government, which would often destroy what progress the Christians had made. The church was built contrary to the laws of the empire, in a high and visible part of the village. Its domes were visible from everywhere. As a compromise, Belitsan Christians convinced the local authority to bring an mount a clock face from Vienna, which would be mounted on the highest dome. It was bought from Vienna with natural products (cheese, wool and others). During 1903, during the Ilinden-Preobrazhenie Uprising, the church was burned down and the clock fell to the ground, stopping at 16:00. Its parts were collected by the Bulgarian Muslim Irlovets and later returned to the returning Christians with the purpose to be returned to its old place. According to one legend—which Belitsa is full of—Levski came to Pope Danail's house in Belitsa after the pope fictitiously invited him to marry his daughter so he would come to the village. After that, a revolutionary organisation was formed in the village to ready the Christian population for the April Uprising. During the Russo- Turkish War from 1877–78, under the Samara flag, 19 Belitsan volunteers fought at Svishtov, Rousse, Sheinovo and Shipka. They returned to their village with many medals and honors and were received with delight from their neighbours. Belitsan volunteers were also involved in the Kresna-Razlog Uprising as well as the training and fighting at Razlog.

Formed in 1964, their work is marked by the use of sonic experimentation, innovative album art, and elaborate live shows. Originally an R&B; band called the Soul Giants, the band's first lineup included Ray Collins, David Coronado, Ray Hunt, Roy Estrada and Jimmy Carl Black. Frank Zappa was asked to take over as the guitarist following a fight between Collins and Coronado, the band's original saxophonist/leader. Zappa insisted that they perform his original material, and on Mother's Day in 1965, changed their name to the Mothers. Record executives demanded that the name be changed, and so \\"out of necessity,\\" Zappa later said, \\"we became the Mothers of Invention.\\" After early struggles, the Mothers earned substantial popular commercial success. The band first became popular playing in California's underground music scene in the late 1960s. Under Zappa's helm, it was signed to jazz label Verve Records as part of the label's diversification plans. Verve released the Mothers of Invention's début double album Freak Out! in 1966, featuring a lineup including Zappa, Collins, Black, Estrada and Elliot Ingber. Don Preston joined the band soon after. Under Zappa's leadership and a changing lineup, the band released a series of critically acclaimed albums, including Absolutely Free, We're Only in It for the Money and Uncle Meat, before being disbanded by Zappa in 1969. In 1970, he formed a new version of the Mothers that included Ian Underwood, Jeff Simmons, George Duke, Aynsley Dunbar and singers Mark Volman and Howard Kaylan (formerly of the Turtles, but who for contractual reasons were credited in this band as the Phlorescent Leech & Eddie). Later adding another ex-Turtle, bassist Jim Pons, this lineup endured through 1971, when Zappa was injured by an audience member during a concert appearance. Zappa focused on big-band and orchestral music while recovering from his injuries, and in 1973 formed the Mothers' final lineup, which included drummer Ralph Humphrey, trumpeter Sal Marquez, keyboardist/vocalist George Duke, trombonist Bruce Fowler, bassist Tom Fowler, percussionist Ruth Underwood and keyboardist/saxophonist Ian Underwood. The final album using the Mothers as a backing band, Bongo Fury (1975), featured guitarist Denny Walley and drummer Terry Bozzio, who continued to play for Zappa on non-Mothers releases. History=Early years (1964–1965) The Soul Giants were formed in 1964. In 1964, Frank Zappa was approached by Ray Collins who asked him to take over as the guitarist following a fight between Collins and the group's original guitarist. Zappa accepted, and convinced the other members that they should play his music to increase the chances of getting a record contract. Original leader David Coronado did not think that the band would be employable if they played original material, and left the band. Zappa soon assumed leadership and the role as co-lead singer, even though he never considered himself a singer. The band was renamed the Mothers, coincidentally on Mother's Day. The group increased their bookings after beginning an association with manager Herb Cohen, while they gradually gained attention on the burgeoning Los Angeles underground music scene. In early 1966, they were spotted by leading record producer Tom Wilson when playing Zappa's \\"Trouble Every Day,\\" a song about the Watts Riots. Wilson had earned acclaim as the producer for singer-songwriter Bob Dylan and the folk-rock act Simon & Garfunkel, and was notable as one of the few African Americans working as a major label pop music producer at this time. Extract of page 86 Wilson signed the Mothers to the Verve Records division of MGM Records, which had built up a strong reputation in the music industry for its releases of modern jazz recordings in the 1940s and 1950s, but was attempting to diversify into pop and rock audiences. Verve insisted that the band officially rename themselves because \\"Mother\\" in slang terminology was short for \\"motherfucker\\"—a term that apart from its profanity, in a jazz context connotes a very skilled musical instrumentalist. The label suggested the name \\"The Mothers Auxiliary\\", which prompted Zappa to come up with the name \\"The Mothers of Invention\\". Debut album: Freak Out! (1966) With Wilson credited as producer, the Mothers of Invention, augmented by a studio orchestra, recorded the groundbreaking Freak Out! (1966) which, preceded by Bob Dylan's Blonde on Blonde, was the second rock double album ever released. It mixed R&B;, doo-wop, musique concrète, and experimental sound collages that captured the \\"freak\\" subculture of Los Angeles at that time. Although he was dissatisfied with the final product—in a late '60s radio interview (included in the posthumous MOFO Project/Object compilation) Zappa recounted that the side-long closing track \\"Return of the Son of Monster Magnet\\" was intended to be the basic track for a much more complex work which Verve did not allow him to complete—Freak Out immediately established Zappa as a radical new voice in rock music, providing an antidote to the \\"relentless consumer culture of America\\". The sound was raw, but the arrangements were sophisticated. While recording in the studio, some of the additional session musicians were shocked that they were expected to read the notes on sheet music from charts with Zappa conducting them, since it was not standard when recording rock music. The lyrics praised non-conformity, disparaged authorities, and had dadaist elements. Yet, there was a place for seemingly conventional love songs. Most compositions are Zappa's, which set a precedent for the rest of his recording career. He had full control over the arrangements and musical decisions and did most overdubs. Wilson provided the industry clout and connections to get the group the financial resources needed. Wilson nominally produced the Mothers' second album Absolutely Free (1967), which was recorded in November 1966, and later mixed in New York, although by this time Zappa was in de facto control of most facets of the production. It featured extended playing by the Mothers of Invention and focused on songs that defined Zappa's compositional style of introducing abrupt, rhythmical changes into songs that were built from diverse elements. Examples are \\"Plastic People\\" and \\"Brown Shoes Don't Make It\\", which contained lyrics critical of the hypocrisy and conformity of American society, but also of the counterculture of the 1960s. As Zappa put it, \\"[W]e're satirists, and we are out to satirize everything.\\" New York period (1966–1968) The Mothers of Invention played in New York in late 1966 and were offered a contract at the Garrick Theater during Easter 1967. This proved successful and Herb Cohen extended the booking, which eventually lasted half a year.James, 2000, Necessity Is ... , pp. 62–69. As a result, Zappa and his wife, along with the Mothers of Invention, moved to New York. Their shows became a combination of improvised acts showcasing individual talents of the band as well as tight performances of Zappa's music. Everything was directed by Zappa's famous hand signals. Guest performers and audience participation became a regular part of the Garrick Theater shows. One evening, Zappa managed to entice some U.S. Marines from the audience onto the stage, where they proceeded to dismember a big baby doll, having been told by Zappa to pretend that it was a \\"gook baby\\". Situated in New York, and only interrupted by the band's first European tour, the Mothers of Invention recorded the album widely regarded as the peak of the group's late 1960s work, We're Only in It for the Money (released 1968).. Retrieved on January 2, 2008. It was produced by Zappa, with Wilson credited as executive producer. From then on, Zappa produced all albums released by the Mothers of Invention and as a solo artist. We're Only in It for the Money featured some of the most creative audio editing and production yet heard in pop music, and the songs ruthlessly satirized the hippie and flower power phenomena. The cover photo parodied that of the Beatles' Sgt Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band,As the legal aspects of using the Sgt Pepper concept were unsettled, the album was released with the cover and back on the inside of the gatefold, while the actual cover and back were a picture of the group in a pose parodying the inside of the Beatles album. its art provided by Cal Schenkel whom Zappa had met in New York. This initiated a lifelong collaboration in which Schenkel designed covers for numerous Zappa and Mothers albums. Reflecting Zappa's eclectic approach to music, the next album, Cruising with Ruben & the Jets (1968), was very different. It represented a collection of doo-wop songs; listeners and critics were not sure whether the album was a satire or a tribute. Zappa has noted that the album was conceived in the way Stravinsky's compositions were in his neo-classical period: \\"If he could take the forms and clichés of the classical era and pervert them, why not do the same ... to doo-wop in the fifties?\\" A theme from Stravinsky's The Rite of Spring is heard during one song. Return to Los Angeles and break up (1968–1969) Zappa and the Mothers of Invention returned to Los Angeles in the summer of 1968. Despite being a success with fans in Europe, the Mothers of Invention were not faring well financially. Their first records were vocally oriented, but Zappa wrote more instrumental jazz and classical oriented music for the band's concerts, which confused audiences. Zappa felt that audiences failed to appreciate his \\"electrical chamber music\\". Recorded from September 1967 to September 1968 and released in early 1969, Uncle Meat, the final release by the original Mothers, was a double album of varied music, intended as a soundtrack for a proposed film of the same name. In November 1968, after Collins had left for the final time, Zappa recruited future Little Feat guitarist Lowell George to replace him. In 1969, there were nine band members and Zappa was supporting the group himself from his publishing royalties, whether they played or not. 1969 was also the year Zappa, fed up with the label's interference, left MGM Records for Warner Bros.' Reprise subsidiary, where Zappa/Mothers recordings would bear the Bizarre Records imprint. In late 1969, Zappa broke up the band. He often cited the financial strain as the main reason, but also commented on the band members' lack of sufficient effort. Many band members were bitter about Zappa's decision, and some took it as a sign of Zappa's concern for perfection at the expense of human feeling. Others were irritated by 'his autocratic ways', exemplified by Zappa's never staying at the same hotel as the band members. Several members would, however, play for Zappa in years to come. He did, however, start recruiting new band members at this time, even asking Micky Dolenz from The Monkees to join. Zappa had appeared on the series and in the movie Head. Remaining recordings with the band from this period were collected on Weasels Ripped My Flesh and Burnt Weeny Sandwich (both released in 1970). George and Estrada formed Little Feat with Richie Hayward and Bill Payne after The Mothers disbanded. Rebirth of the Mothers and filmmaking (1970) Mark Volman performing with the Mothers in 1971. Later in 1970, Zappa formed a new version of the Mothers (from then on, he mostly dropped the \\"of Invention\\"). It included British drummer Aynsley Dunbar, jazz keyboardist George Duke, Ian Underwood, Jeff Simmons (bass, rhythm guitar), and three members of the Turtles: bass player Jim Pons, and singers Mark Volman and Howard Kaylan, who, due to persistent legal and contractual problems, adopted the stage name \\"The Phlorescent Leech and Eddie\\", or \\"Flo & Eddie\\". This version of the Mothers debuted on Zappa's next solo album Chunga's Revenge (1970), which was followed by the double-album soundtrack to the movie 200 Motels (1971), featuring the Mothers, the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra, Ringo Starr, Theodore Bikel, and Keith Moon. Co-directed by Zappa and Tony Palmer, it was filmed in a week at Pinewood Studios outside London. Tensions between Zappa and several cast and crew members arose before and during shooting. The film deals loosely with life on the road as a rock musician. It was the first feature film photographed on videotape and transferred to 35 mm film, a process which allowed for novel visual effects. It was released to mixed reviews. The score relied extensively on orchestral music, and Zappa's dissatisfaction with the classical music world intensified when a concert, scheduled at the Royal Albert Hall after filming, was canceled because a representative of the venue found some of the lyrics obscene. In 1975, he lost a lawsuit against the Royal Albert Hall for breach of contract. After 200 Motels, the band went on tour, which resulted in two live albums, Fillmore East - June 1971 and Just Another Band From L.A.; the latter included the 20-minute track \\"Billy the Mountain\\", Zappa's satire on rock opera set in Southern California. This track was representative of the band's theatrical performances in which songs were used to build up sketches based on 200 Motels scenes as well as new situations often portraying the band members' sexual encounters on the road.During the June 1971 Fillmore concerts Zappa was joined on stage by John Lennon and Yoko Ono. This performance was recorded, and Lennon released excerpts on his album Some Time In New York City in 1972. Zappa later released his version of excerpts from the concert on Playground Psychotics in 1992, including the jam track \\"Scumbag\\" and an extended avant- garde vocal piece by Ono (originally called \\"Au\\"), which Zappa renamed \\"A Small Eternity with Yoko Ono\\". Accident, attack and their aftermath (1971–1972) The Mothers of Invention in 1971 In December 1971, there were two serious setbacks. While performing at Casino de Montreux in Switzerland, the Mothers' equipment was destroyed when a flare set off by an audience member started a fire that burned down the casino. Immortalized in Deep Purple's song \\"Smoke on the Water\\", the event and immediate aftermath can be heard on the bootleg album Swiss Cheese/Fire, released legally as part of Zappa's Beat the Boots II compilation. After a week's break, the Mothers played at the Rainbow Theatre, London, with rented gear. During the encore, an audience member pushed Zappa off the stage and into the concrete-floored orchestra pit. The band thought Zappa had been killed—he had suffered serious fractures, head trauma and injuries to his back, leg, and neck, as well as a crushed larynx, which ultimately caused his voice to drop a third after healing. This accident resulted in him using a wheelchair for an extended period, forcing him off the road for over half a year. Upon his return to the stage in September 1972, he was still wearing a leg brace, had a noticeable limp and could not stand for very long while on stage. Zappa noted that one leg healed \\"shorter than the other\\" (a reference later found in the lyrics of songs \\"Zomby Woof\\" and \\"Dancin' Fool\\"), resulting in chronic back pain. Meanwhile, the Mothers were left in limbo and eventually formed the core of Flo and Eddie's band as they set out on their own. Top 10 album (1973–1975) After releasing a solo jazz-oriented album Waka/Jawaka, and following it up with a Mothers album, The Grand Wazoo, with large bands, Zappa formed and toured with smaller groups that variously included Ian Underwood (reeds, keyboards), Ruth Underwood (vibes, marimba), Sal Marquez (trumpet, vocals), Napoleon Murphy Brock (sax, flute and vocals), Bruce Fowler (trombone), Tom Fowler (bass), Chester Thompson (drums), Ralph Humphrey (drums), George Duke (keyboards, vocals), and Jean-Luc Ponty (violin). Zappa continued a high rate of production through the first half of the 1970s, including the solo album Apostrophe (') (1974), which reached a career-high No. 10 on the Billboard pop album charts. Retrieved on January 3, 2008. helped by the chart single \\"Don't Eat The Yellow Snow\\".. Retrieved on January 3, 2008. Other albums from the period are Over-Nite Sensation (1973), which contained several future concert favorites, such as \\"Dinah-Moe Humm\\" and \\"Montana\\", and the albums Roxy & Elsewhere (1974) and One Size Fits All (1975) which feature ever-changing versions of a band still called the Mothers, and are notable for the tight renditions of highly difficult jazz fusion songs in such pieces as \\"Inca Roads\\", \\"Echidna's Arf (Of You)\\" and \\"Be-Bop Tango (Of the Old Jazzmen's Church)\\". A live recording from 1974, You Can't Do That on Stage Anymore, Vol. 2 (1988), captures \\"the full spirit and excellence of the 1973–75 band\\". Zappa released Bongo Fury in 1975, which featured live recordings from a tour the same year that had reunited him with Captain Beefheart for a brief period. They later became estranged for a period of years, but were in contact at the end of Zappa's life. Bongo Fury was the last new album to be credited to the Mothers. In 1993, Zappa released Ahead of Their Time, an album of previously recorded material by the original Mothers of Invention lineup.

It is the administrative centre of the homonymous Berkovitsa Municipality, Montana Province and is close to the town of Varshets. , it has a population of 13,917 inhabitants. Bulgarian National Statistical Institute - Bulgarian towns in 2009 Location and history Berkovitsa is situated on the northern slope of Kom Peak of the Berkovska Stara Planina Mountain along the valley of the Berkovitsa River, which is a tributary to the Barziya River, at an altitude above sea level 405 m. The town was mentioned for the first time in Ottoman documents of 1488.Nicoara Beldiceanu, Les actes des premiers sultans conservés dans les manuscrits Turcs de la Bibliothèque Nationale a Paris, II, Paris, La Haye, 1964, p. 218, note 2 It is near the site of an old fortified settlement on the road from Sofia to Lom. The remains of the fortress and a church were discovered on high ground at Kaleto, just to the west of the present-day town. The former settlement was known as early as the reign of King Kaloyan and was mentioned as a border settlement in the period of the Vidin Kingdom. Berkovitsa Glacier, on Livingston Island in the South Shetland Islands, Antarctica, is named for Berkovitsa.  History  The region was involved in the Uprising of Konstantin and Fruzhin (1408 - 1413) and the Chiprovtsi Uprising (1688). At the end of August 1872, Vasil Levski arrived in Berkovitsa, together with the chairman of the Vratsa Revolutionary Committee, Mito Ankov.  Religion = Christianity  In the late antique fortress Kaleto, located on a hill north of Berkovitsa, a large bishopric complex was built during early Christianity. *Orthodox church of Nativity of Mary  Judaism  Until 1947, there was a significant Jewish community in Berkovitsa and there was a functioning synagogue.

It gets its name from the way the planned chain appears to hang from the \\"neck\\" of the Boston peninsula. In 1989, the Emerald Necklace was designated as a Boston Landmark by the Boston Landmarks Commission. Overview The Necklace comprises half of the City of Boston's park acreage, parkland in the Town of Brookline, and parkways and park edges under the jurisdiction of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. More than 300,000 people live within its watershed area. From Boston Common to Franklin Park it is approximately seven miles by foot or bicycle through the parks. The Emerald Necklace includes: * Boston Common * Public Garden * Commonwealth Avenue Mall * The Fens * Forsyth Park * The Riverway * Olmsted Park * Jamaica Pond * Jamaicaway * Arborway * Arnold Arboretum * Franklin Park Several components of the Emerald Necklace pre-date the plan to unite them. Some links of the Emerald Necklace not only offer an opportunity for recreation in a wooded environment, but are also ecologically important urban wilds that provide nesting places for migratory birds and improve the air quality of the city. History Ward's Pond in Olmsted Park Fens from footbridge opposite Forsyth Dental building, looking north. Prudential building in background This linear system of parks was designed by Frederick Law Olmsted to connect Boston Common, dating from the colonial period, and Public Garden (1837) to Franklin Park, known as the \\"great country park.\\" The project began around 1878 with the effort to clean up and control the marshy area which became the Back Bay and The Fens. In 1880, Olmsted proposed that the Muddy River, which flowed from Jamaica Pond through the Fens, be included in the park plan. The current was dredged into a winding stream and directed into the Charles River. The corridor encompassing the river became the linear park still in existence today. Olmsted's vision of a linear park of walking paths along a gentle stream connecting numerous small ponds was complete by the turn of the century. The parks conceived by Olmsted, from Storrow Drive south to Franklin Park, were collectively listed on the National Register of Historic Places as the Olmsted Park System. Over the past decade, almost $60 million in capital expenditures for parks and waterway improvements have been made in the Emerald Necklace by the City of Boston and the Town of Brookline. These efforts have included improved pathways, plantings and signage, bridge repairs, and the restoration of boardwalks and buildings. In some areas (especially the woodlands of Franklin Park and Olmsted Park) these efforts have only begun to address the over 50 years of neglect the Emerald Necklace has suffered. Several dedicated parks organizations, including the Emerald Necklace Conservancy, the Friends of the Public Garden, the Franklin Park Coalition, and the Arboretum Park Conservancy, were created to protect, maintain, restore and advocate for the Emerald Necklace parks through the work of their staff, the donations of their constituents and the efforts of their volunteers. Shape The Emerald Necklace begins near Boston's Downtown Crossing, proceeds along the Boston–Brookline border, then curves into Jamaica Plain. At the south border of Arnold Arboretum, at the point most distant from its beginning, the Emerald Necklace is in Roslindale. It then hooks back up into Roxbury and Dorchester. Olmsted's original plan called for a \\"U\\"-shaped necklace which terminated at Boston Harbor. The final link, the Dorchesterway, was never realized. Jurisdiction * Arnold Arboretum is leased to and managed by Harvard University. * The west banks of Olmsted Park and the Riverway are under the jurisdiction of Brookline Parks & Open Space. * The majority of the Emerald Necklace is maintained by Boston Parks and Recreation with a small portion belonging to the Department of Conservation and Recreation. Emerald Necklace Conservancy The Emerald Necklace Conservancy is a private non- profit stewardship organization founded in 1998. Its mission is to restore and improve the Emerald Necklace for all. To steward the Emerald Necklace’s 1,100 acres of parkland extending from Boston’s Back Bay through Brookline and Jamaica Plain to Franklin Park in Dorchester, the conservancy works in collaboration with its partners on advocacy, maintenance and restoration, education and access, and promoting park stewardship through volunteer and youth programs. Governed by a board of directors, the conservancy brings together representatives of both the private and public sectors to carry out these goals. Its activities complement the longstanding initiatives of its public partners, the Boston Parks & Recreation Department, Brookline Parks and Open Space and the Massachusetts Department of Conservation and Recreation. With its public and private partners, dedicated staff and an ever-expanding cadre of volunteers the conservancy is committed to preserving Olmsted’s historic legacy and ensuring that these parks continue to serve the common good for generations to come. The Conservancy offers a wide range of services to visitors of the Emerald Necklace including events, guided tours, a mobile tour guide, volunteer opportunities and youth programs. The Emerald Necklace Conservancy's Shattuck Visitor Center is open to the public year-round and is both an educational resource about the parks and a gathering place for the community. The Shattuck Visitor Center, located at 125 Fenway, provides free maps, visitor information services and exhibits about the parks. Plans The Emerald Necklace Parks Master Plan was completed in 1989, and updated in 2001. The parks have long been subject to flooding from the Muddy River. The Muddy River Restoration Project will dredge contaminated sediments and implement other major structural improvements, unburying the river and improving its integrity, appearance, and flood control capabilities. Phase I – daylighting the river at the Landmark Center – began spring 2009. The parks have similarly been attempting to mitigate the spread of Phragmites (an invasive species). Olmsted's initial view of a park with linear composition is being compromised due to the common reed. Unfortunately it has taken a lot of conservation efforts in order to limit this plant's spread, making it more difficult to achieve Olmsted's vision.

Life and work  Born the son of a London woollen draper, Collinson entered his father's business and developed an interest in botany. His family belonged to the Gracechurch Street Meeting of the Religious Society of Friends (i.e. Quakers). In October 1728, Collinson wrote to Sir Hans Sloane, President of the Royal Society, about strange events in Kent and on 7 November 1728, he was proposed for Fellowship of the Society. Collinson supported the struggle of Thomas Coram, William Hogarth, and others to establish a charitable institution that would welcome babies abandoned by their mothers. A Royal Charter to start the Foundling Hospital was granted by George II on 17 October 1739. The charter lists Collinson as a founding governor. Although Collinson was a cloth merchant by vocation, largely trading with North America, his real love was gardening. Through his business contacts, he obtained samples of seeds and plants from around the world. Collinson's personal plant collections, first at Peckham and later at Mill Hill became famous. He came to realise that there was a market for such things in England and, in the late 1730s, began to import North American botanical seeds for English collectors to grow through financing the travels of John Bartram. Yearly, he distributed the New World seeds collected by Bartram to British gentry, nurserymen, and natural scientists including Dillenius, Philip Miller, Lord Petre, the Dukes of Richmond and Norfolk, James Gordon,James Gordon (1708–1780) – article in Dictionary of British and Irish Botanists and Horticulturists by Ray Desmond, Christine Ellwood, Published by CRC Press, 1994 , p286 – extracts on GoogleBooks John Busch, etc. Collinson was also the patron of the artist and natural historian Mark Catesby. Collinson maintained an extensive correspondence and was friendly with notable scientists in London and abroad including Sloane, Carl Linnaeus, Gronovius, Dr. John Fothergill, Cadwallader Colden, and Benjamin Franklin. Collinson was a particular patron of the Philadelphia scientific community assisting the fledgling American Philosophical Society founded by Bartram and Franklin in 1743. He also served for many years as the purchasing agent for the Library Company of Philadelphia. It was through Collinson that Franklin first communicated to the Royal Society what would in 1751 be published as Experiments and Observations on Electricity. He was elected a foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences in 1747. Whilst living in Mill Hill, he lived in what is now the Ridgeway House boarding house of Mill Hill School. Furthermore, the school also has a Collinson House and more recently a Cedars House, named after the trees Collinson planted. References * Alan W.

At the time of his death his history of Kingston was nearly complete and awaited publication.  Biography  Evers was born in the Bronx neighborhood of Williamsbridge and lived there till the age of nine, when his parents moved to a farm near Tillson. He developed a passion for history from the many stories of the farmhands, the work of British naturalist Gilbert White and collecting Native American arrowheads with one of his high school teachers in New Paltz. He attended Hamilton College and, after graduation, returned to the city and the Art Students League, where he met his wife, illustrator Helen Baker. They eventually settled in Litchfield, Connecticut, where they wrote and illustrated 50 children's books together, most telling fables in a simple prose style that earned comparisons to Aesop, and raised three children Jane, Barbara and Christopher Evers. In 1950 he and his wife divorced. He chose to return to Ulster and begin the first of three histories that would define his later career. The Catskills: From Wilderness to Woodstock, published in 1972 (with a later afterword to the 1984 edition) is a comprehensive 720-page history of a region that had previously been lacking for one. Extensive research went into covering every aspect of a long and tangled story, with special attention paid to the folklore that Evers had first heard from inhabitants of the region as a boy.

It is located in Kyustendil Province and is close to the towns of Kocherinovo and Rila. The town of Boboshevo is situated around to the south of Sofia and from Bulgaria's prime skiing destination, Bansko. Approximately 4 km away from Boboshevo is the main road that connects Sofia with the Greek border. Boboshevo lies in the lowest part of the southwestern ridge of the Rila Mountains, in the fertile valley of the Struma River (where it meets with the German River). Thanks to its favourable location and mild climate, the area of Boboshevo has been populated since antiquity. The Boboshevo region is known also as the 'Bulgarian Jerusalem' along with the region of Ohrid due to its role of a cultural centre during the 15th to the 17th century. The region is rich in churches and monasteries, most of which date back to that period. The most famous of these is the St Dimitar Monastery, which lies in the lower eastern part of the Ruen Mountain. It is an extremely precious representative of medieval architecture, possessing the highest value — a monument of national importance — according to the Bulgarian criteria of listing. The church (as it now stands) was constructed during the last quarter of the 15th century. It has one nave, one round apse, and is covered by a semi-spheric vault. The wall paintings cover both the walls and the ceiling entirely, as well as the western façade. They are dated to 1488 and are extremely valuable, which goes beyond national cultural boundaries and provokes the interest of many Balkan researchers, tourists and pilgrims. St Dimitar is one of the oldest monasteries in Bulgaria having existed since the First Bulgarian Empire, around the 10th century. After being destroyed during the Ottoman invasion in Bulgaria in the late 14th century, it was reconstructed in 1488. The monastery is not only significant because of its age. It is treasured also because one of Bulgaria's greatest heroes and the country's patron saint, St Ivan Rilski, got his start there. St. Dimitar hosted St Ivan Rilski during his early years of monkhood, before he moved to live as a hermit in a nearby cave and then founded the famous Rila monastery. In 2002–2003, another monastery was built in the region. It is located in the neighbourhood of the village Skrino and is named after St Ivan Rilski for his being born in the same village. A steep path starts from the monastery and leads up in the mountains to the cave where St Ivan Rilski used to live. Located nearby in the neighbourhood of the Slatino village, an Eneolithic settlement with valuable objects of the early 5th millennium BC was uncovered during excavations. In addition to more than 500 ceramic objects, qualified as true masterpieces of fine art, there is a unique finding of an oven model with a lunar calendar painted on its bottom. The calendar is the oldest of its kind found anywhere in Europe. Today, Boboshevo is a quiet little town with picturesque houses, a few coffee shops and bars.

Brooks (October 30, 1828 - April 20, 1887) worked as chief engineer for the New York and Erie Railroad (NY&E;) until the railroad moved its steam locomotive maintenance facilities from Dunkirk, New York, to Buffalo. In 1869 he leased the former NY&E; shops in Dunkirk and formed Brooks Locomotive Works. Brooks also served for three terms as mayor of Dunkirk. He was a leading figure in the business and social life of the area around Dunkirk, and western New York state.  Family and early life  Horatio Brooks was born on October 30, 1828, in Portsmouth, New Hampshire. His family moved to Dover, New Hampshire, in 1838. He married Julia A. Haggett, of North Edgecomb, Maine, on March 6, 1851.  Career  In 1844, he began working as an apprentice machinist in the shop of Isaac and Seth Adams, his cousins. He started with the Boston and Maine Railroad (B&M;) at their shops in Andover, Massachusetts, in 1846, and worked his way up to become a fireman in 1848 and an engineer in May 1849. His experience on the B&M; led to his next position as an engineer for the New York and Erie Railroad in 1850; in this position he operated the first locomotive in Chautauqua County, New York, on November 28, 1850. He moved west in 1856 at the request of his friend from the B&M;, Charles Minot, who was superintendent of the Ohio and Mississippi Railroad, where Brooks became master mechanic of the line. The move was the result of a trainmen strike against the Erie, for which both Brooks and Minot were identified for dismissal; after the superintendent during the strike resigned, Minot was recalled to the Erie and he brought Brooks back with him. Brooks was appointed superintendent of the western division of Erie Railroad in October 1862, and superintendent of motive power in 1865. When Jay Gould ordered that the railroad's shops at Dunkirk, New York, be closed with work consolidated to other locations on the line, Brooks leased the shops buildings and formed Brooks Locomotive Works in October and November 1869.  Death and legacy  Horatio Brooks died on April 20, 1887, survived by his wife and two daughters (a third daughter preceded him in death). He was buried in Forest Hill Cemetery, Fredonia, New York. The Brooks Locomotive Works remained in the family for a while, with his sons-in-law Edward Nichols and Frederick H. Stevens both serving as president, Nichols from 1887 to 1892 and Stevens from 1896 to the merger that formed Alco in 1901. Stevens continued on with Alco, becoming chairman of the board of directors in 1905. In 1898, the Stevens family donated the Horatio G. Brooks Dunkirk homestead to YMCA to become the organization's hospital and library; the donation was valued at $150,000 (). It became known as the Brooks Memorial Hospital. By 1944, the original building was slated to be razed. Horatio Brooks's wife Julia died in 1896, leaving many shares of company stock and large amounts of cash to their descendants and family. She was buried beside her late husband in Forest Hill Cemetery. Monuments to Horatio Brooks commemorating his work as president of Brooks Locomotive Works and his contributions to the community were proposed as early as 1903. A locomotive that bore his name in honor was involved in a collision in 1923 when it ran out of control onto another line. Brooks was remembered in celebration in 1923 by employees of the Brooks plant who had worked there for 25 or more years; he was hailed as \\"Dunkirk's first citizen.\\" Brooks was one of a few men nominated to be included in the Hall of Fame for New York State's exhibit at the 1939 World's Fair.

It is located in the Arequipa Region and is the capital of both the Islay Province and the Mollendo District. Mollendo was the main port in the Peruvian southern coast until Matarani was developed about 50 years ago; the port of Mollendo only serves fishermen for the local economy currently and all the commercial shipping is done through Matarani 12 kilometers north; the old port is in ruins. From about 1830 to 1880 it was important in the Guano trade. The railroad used to run a passenger train daily, but a good highway connects Mollendo to the Panamerican Highway now and the train now only runs the summer express that goes down from Arequipa on Saturday and returns on Sunday; the beach is the main attraction, even though it is visited by the Humboldt Current that brings cold water from Antarctica.

It is also a popular beach resort. The Auxiliary Ship BAP Mollendo (ATC-131) of the Peruvian Navy is named after the town.  History = The Inca era  About 1300, the legendary Inca Mayta Cápac, puts the regions of Arequipa and Moquegua under the control of the Inca empire. Sixty three years later, and according to Garcilaso de la Vega, the Inca Cápac Yupanqui, following traditional customs of the Inca Empire, selected four generals from his major staff and entrusted them the command of approximately twenty thousand soldiers (or Tuqui Titos) for the coast region conquest project. Cápac Yupanqui's son, Sinchi Rocca, conquered all of Arequipa and Moquegua coast area. From this event and ahead, Tambo is a main protagonist into the region history, due their geographical position and serving as weapons and food supply depot. Inca Yáhuar Huácac, successor of Inca Cápac Yupanqui, established his supply depots and headquarters in this valley, to march into Atacama (north Chilean region) direction to expand the territory of the Inca Empire.  First inhabitants  After Tiahuanaco's culture decadency and during the Inca era, the Peruvian south coast was occupied by several tribes: * The \\"Tampus\\" stationed into today Tambo region. * The \\"Chullis\\" corresponding to Chule zone. * The \\"Changos\\" located between the Aranta and Islay zones. The river basin formed by the Tambo river, probably conquest and occupied by external forces during several periods, generate a population with local and heterogeneous customs, leaving several vestiges about their civilization, suddenly attached to the remaining mixed etymology name from several languages such as Quechua, Cocachacra, Challascapi, etc. Another external influences were the Kauiqui and Puquina with characteristic suffixes such as ando, endo, indo. Some examples are: Cachendo, Mollendo, Huarindo, Catarindo, etc. A large population was located along the valley and nearing hills, serving it from subterranean waters. Influence of the sea was decisive on the valley and coast inhabitants were the mama coccha (the sea creator) provide them with fish and sea fruits.  War of the Pacific  During the War of the Pacific Mollendo was invaded by Chilean forces under the command of Colonel Orozimbo Barbosa. The main aim of this force (transported by the Chilean Navy) was to wreak havoc on Southern Peru, so as to force the process of negotiations for peace between Peru and Chile. The invasion forces consisted of the 3rd Chilean Line Infantry Regiment, The Chilean Marines, One brigade of Chilean Sappers, and 30 Horse Cavalry. The defenses of Mollendo consisted of two small forts with no cannon ( which were days earlier transported to Arequipa) defended by 100 soldiers. The first to disembark were the Chilean Marines, who took the town without a struggle. The rest (Main Body) of the expedition landed on or near Islay, without opposition. On March 9, 1880, the Main Body of the expedition entered Mollendo. Colonel Barbosa with 500 soldiers left Mollendo towards Mejia in search of the defenders, leaving the 3rd Chilean Line Infantry in charge of the town, looting of homes quickly began. Colonel Barbosa arrived in Mejia, destroying the locomotives and railtracks to prevent reinforcements arriving from Arequipa via rail. Colonel Barbosa surprised the defenders at Ensenada, taking 20 prisoners. Upon his return to Mollendo, he learned of the sacking of the town, punishing some members of his command. This resulted in some desertions.

The hotel is managed by JW Marriott Hotels, which is a brand of Marriott International, and it is owned by Katara Hospitality. History Grosvenor House Hotel, 1920s postcard illustration The Grosvenor House Hotel was built in the 1920s and opened in 1929 on the site of Grosvenor House, the former London residence of the Dukes of Westminster, whose family name is Grosvenor. The hotel owed its existence to Arthur Octavius Edwards, who conceived and built it, then presided over it as chairman for 10 years. Key to the story of the hotel was A.H. Jones, who had worked for Edwards in Doncaster. In January 1929, six months after the completion of the first block of apartments, and six months before completion of the hotel, Edwards brought Jones to Grosvenor House as accountant. In 1936, at the age of 29, Jones became general manager of Grosvenor House. Apart from the war years, when he served with the Royal Artillery and later in the NAAFI, Jones held this position until he retired in 1965. The hotel was not finally completed until the 1950s because Bruno, Baron Schröder, who had acquired the lease of 35, Park Street in about 1910, had refused to give it up to Edwards. Schröder remained in the house until his death in 1940, and permission to demolish the house was finally given in 1956. The house was replaced with a 92-bedroom extension, which was officially opened in 1957 by the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Peter Thorneycroft. Grosvenor House managed to have a 'good' World War II. Ten thousand sandbags and five miles of blackout material protected the building, and its entertaining space was used in the war effort. The Great Room initially became home to the Officers' Sunday Club and then, in 1943, to the US officers' mess. Generals Dwight D. Eisenhower and George S. Patton were regular visitors. The hotel underwent a four-year renovation and restoration costing £142 million, and it reopened in 2008.London's Grosvenor House Gets Grand Renovations. HotelChatter (24 September 2008). Retrieved 12 August 2013. This included a full refurbishment of all restaurants, guest rooms, health facilities, and public areas. The Great Room, Ballroom, Court Suite, restaurants, bars, meeting spaces and 494 guest rooms can accommodate a total of over 6,000 people. In 2010, Indian conglomerate Sahara India Pariwar purchased the hotel from the Royal Bank of Scotland for £470 million. Sahara India Pariwar also owned a controlling stake in New York's famous Plaza Hotel from 2012 to 2018. Grosvenor House is managed by the JW Marriott Hotels brand of Marriott International. The hotel drew protests in 2017 when it hosted the annual gathering of the Aerospace Defence Security group (ADS), a trade association which represents arms companies. Campaigners stood outside the hotel and held banners protesting the role of some ADS member companies in the arming of Saudi Arabia during its attack on Yemen. In April 2017, Sahara India Pariwar turned down an offer of more than £600 million for the hotel from British billionaires David and Frederick Barclay, before finally selling the hotel to US-based Ashkenazy Acquisition Corporation for an undisclosed sum. In November 2018, it was announced that Katara Hospitality (owned by the Qatar Investment Authority) was buying the hotel for an undisclosed sum. Facilities Hotel viewed from Park Lane Grosvenor House was the first hotel in London at that time to have a separate bathroom and entrance lobby for each bedroom, and running iced water in every bathroom. When the hotel first opened, it was also the headquarters of the International Sportsmen's Club. Its facilities included Turkish baths, a swimming pool, squash courts and a gymnasium. The hotel has a pedestrian entrance on Park Lane in Mayfair, but this is not the 'main/courtyard' entrance, which is actually on Park Street. The official address of the hotel is 86–90, Park Lane. Great Room The Great Room (which is a separate room from the Ballroom) at the Grosvenor House is the venue of many prominent awards evenings such as The Asian Awards, Pride of Britain Awards, and the O2 Silver Clef Awards, as well as charity balls and the like, and it is often seen on British television. Since the 1930s, the Great Room has hosted the world's oldest charitable ball, the Royal Caledonian Ball, and it is one of the largest ballrooms in Europe, with a maximum capacity of 2,000 seated (200 10-person tables) or 1,100 theatre style. Although now not used as such, the Great Room was originally built as an ice- rink, and much of the machinery lies dormant under the current flooring. In 1933, Princess Elizabeth, the future Queen Elizabeth II, learnt to skate at the hotel at just seven years of age. Sonja Henie, Cecilia Colledge, and other famous skaters frequently displayed their skill. International ice hockey matches were played there, and the newly formed Grosvenor House Canadian hockey team, recruited from Canadians living in London, played the Queen's Ice Hockey Club on the rink, the first of a series of matches against teams from the United Kingdom and the Continent. Anticipating competition from other ice rinks, the rink was converted in 1935 into a banquet hall measuring 1,902 square metres (20,454 square feet). Tenants Richard Corrigan rents space within the hotel and runs the restaurant Corrigan's Mayfair.

He was born in Kobe. He lost his sight in 1902, when he was 8 years old, and started his study in koto under the guidance of Nakajima Kengyo II, dedicating the rest of his life to the instrument. In 1907 he moved with his family to Incheon, in southern Korea. When he was 14 years old, in 1909 he finished his first composition, Mizu no Hentai. At 18 he reached the rank of kengyo, the highest rank for a koto performer. Miyagi moved to Tokyo in 1917, and in 1919 he did his first recital of his own compositions. In 1920, he took part in the Great Recital of the New Japanese Music with Seifu Yoshida and Nagayo Motoori. He was reckoned as an authority in the new Japanese music, achieving notability in the early Shōwa period. In 1925 he participated in one of the first radio presentations in Japan, and in 1929 he signed an exclusive contract with Victor Record Company, current JVC. He composed his most famous piece, Haru no Umi (The Sea in Spring), in 1929. In 1930 he became a lecturer at the Tokyo College of Music (current Tokyo University of the Arts), until he was appointed professor in 1937. In 1932 French violinist Renée Chemet visited Japan on a concert tour. After hearing Miyagi perform Haru no Umi Chemet arranged the shakuhachi part for violin, which she and Miyagi then recorded for distribution in Japan and Europe. He gained worldwide notability after the issuing of his albums in Japan, United States and UK. After the Second World War, in 1948, he was appointed to the Academy of Arts of Japan. On 25 June 1956 he died after falling from a train in Kariya, Aichi during one of his tours. He wrote more than 500 pieces, improved Japanese string instruments, and invented new kotos with 17 strings (bass koto) and 80 strings. He was also an essayist, and published more than ten books including Ame no Nenbutsu.

The album was reissued as a deluxe edition with bonus tracks and an additional disc of previously unreleased material on March 4, 2008. Background and production Throughout 1996, Whiskeytown recorded new material in Chapel Hill and Durham, North Carolina. Two separate recording sessions – dubbed the \\"Barn's On Fire\\" sessions and the \\"Baseball Park\\" sessions – produced several songs that were later re-recorded for Strangers Almanac. And while praising everyone involved in making Strangers, principal songwriter Ryan Adams once remarked in an interview that he preferred these earlier songs to the final album. Tracks from these sessions would later be released on the reissues of Faithless Street and Strangers Almanac. The road to making Strangers was a rocky one – in late 1996, bassist Steve Grothman and drummer Skillet Gilmore left the band on the same day, suddenly placing the future of Whiskeytown in doubt. It was then that violinist Caitlin Cary also considered leaving the band, while Adams toyed with the idea of signing as a solo artist with A&M; Records. But in the end, the remaining band members soldiered on and, in February 1997, Adams, Cary, and guitarist Phil Wandscher traveled to Woodland Studios in Nashville to record their major label debut. Drummer Steve Terry and bassist Jeff Rice were also added to the lineup. Producer Jim Scott was selected due to his previous work on Tom Petty's Wildflowers album. The sessions featured plenty of give-and-take between the young, scrappy band and the older, more-polished producer. Said Adams later: \\"He [Jim Scott] wanted to make something flow. He wanted to make our record work, whereas we wanted our record to get damaged.\\" And for his part, Scott points to a particularly raw- sounding guitar part in the song \\"Everything I Do\\" and says, \\"I listen to that and go, oh my God, we should've redone that guitar because it just is a little rough on such a beautiful song. But that's maybe what they liked about it; they were like, 'No, that's cool'... Maybe that was the bruise on the apple that they were looking for.\\" The first notes heard on the album – Adams picking out a slow acoustic guitar line at the beginning of \\"Inn Town\\" – were played using an Alvarez guitar purchased for $100 at a Nashville pawn shop. Adams had arrived in Nashville without a guitar because of an unfortunate mishap: on the day they were leaving for Nashville, the band met in a parking lot to load their gear into a van for the trip. After loading their gear, everyone hopped in the van and drove off. It was only later that they realized they'd left Adams' guitars behind, still sitting in the parking lot. The title of the album's opening track is a reference to fellow North Carolinian/Superchunk frontman Mac McCaughan and his band Wwax, who released a song with the same title. The song \\"Excuse Me While I Break My Own Heart Tonight\\" features Alejandro Escovedo on vocals. The band had previously covered Escovedo's True Believers song \\"The Rain Won't Help You When It's Over\\", which is featured on Disc 2 of the album's 2008 reissue. The understated piano accents on \\"Avenues\\" were played by Adams. Producer Scott believes that this was the first time that the young songwriter had ever played piano on a recording. About the song \\"Losering\\", Adams says: \\"I love 'Losering' because I think it makes a beautiful statement with only about six words. I coulda put more extremely well-written, musically perfect songs on the record but decided not to because I was proud of the fact that there was finally some experimenting going on in the band. And 'Losering' was one of them – 'Losering' was originally just about a six or seven-bar little hymn that I was writing, like Sun Ra or somebody might do – like A Love Supreme, you know, where they just mumble that in succession at the end of that Coltrane record? I kinda wanted to do something like that but maybe with an influence from The Byrds, you know. And I was really proud of that; I really thought that was amazing, so I love listening to it.\\" After a month of recording at Woodland Studios, the band finished recording and mixing at Ocean Way Studios in Los Angeles. Thirty-six songs were recorded for the album, of which thirteen made the final cut. Strangers Almanac Tour (1997–98) In a 2008 interview with Independent Weekly, Adams admitted that the Strangers sessions were a very unhappy time for him personally. Depression, substance abuse, and a general dissatisfaction with the band plagued his time in Nashville. In spite of this, Whiskeytown embarked on a grueling and turbulent tour that stretched out over the next 19 months. The band first appeared as part of the \\"No Depression Tour\\" with fellow alt-country acts Old 97's, Hazeldine, and The Picketts in the Spring of 1997. After Strangers Almanac was released on July 29, another round of touring ensued. This leg of the tour, dubbed the \\"RV Tour\\", found the band traveling between gigs in an RV. On the whiskeytownavenues message board, tour manager Thomas O'Keefe called the tour \\"a 2-month trek in the US that still causes mental illness in those that were there.\\" One particular show at the Iota Club in Arlington, VA, found guitarist Phil Wandscher sitting above the stage for the entire performance, playing his guitar and occasionally throwing beer bottles down at singer Ryan Adams. At another show in Lansing, MI, a fan threw tomatoes at the band's crew following an abbreviated set by the band. On September 10, the band recorded a live in- studio performance for the KCRW radio program \\"Brave New World\\", which was later released on the 2008 deluxe edition of Strangers. Following a contentious September 25 show at The Hurricane in Kansas City, the band splintered. Ryan Adams and Caitlin Cary played the remaining dates of the tour as an acoustic duo. Wandscher, an original member of the band, would never play or record with Whiskeytown again. (Wandscher's work on the Strangers Almanac album would later secure a record deal for his next band – thanks to a recommendation by Death Cab for Cutie's Chris Walla, who's a big fan of the album.) Less than a month later, Whiskeytown had a new touring lineup and hit the road again. Joining Adams and Cary were ex-Firehose guitarist Ed Crawford, bassist Jenni Snyder, multi-instrumentalist Mike Daly, and the band's original drummer Skillet Gilmore. In January 1998, this lineup taped a live performance for Austin City Limits. They also performed on a number of radio programs, including Mountain Stage, Acoustic Cafe, Modern Rock Live, and KMTT's Music Lounge. In late April, the band embarked on their very first European tour, but without Crawford or Snyder. The Strangers tour continued in June as the band opened for John Fogerty, again with a new lineup of sidemen for Adams and Cary, including Brad Rice and Danny Kurtz from The Backsliders. Whiskeytown's ever-evolving lineup would prompt the band to poke fun at itself by selling T-shirts at shows that read: \\"I Played In Whiskeytown And All I Got Was This Lousy Goddamn T-Shirt!\\"http://lh6.ggpht.com/WhittingStock/R0u49aq9SbI/AAAAAAAABDk/5zdV3riY- As/s400/whiskeytown+T-shirt.JPG In September, having now been on the road since March of the previous year, the band played yet another scandalous show – this time at the historic Fillmore Auditorium in San Francisco. At the end of the show, after experiencing sound problems, a lukewarm crowd, and being told he couldn't smoke on stage, an upset Adams smashed his mic stand and tossed the monitors off the stage. He then got into an altercation with the venue's security, and was finally dragged away by band member Daly. By the final show of the tour in October 1998, the band was playing almost an entire set of brand-new, unreleased music, with barely any songs from Strangers Almanac – the very album which had launched the tour nearly two years before.

He was known for playing Commander Ed Straker in UFO, Captain Blue in Captain Scarlet and the Mysterons and for voicing Philip Marlowe in a series of BBC Radio adaptations of the Marlowe novels by Raymond Chandler. Early life George Victor Bishop was born on 11 June 1932, the son of a Manhattan banker, in Brooklyn, New York. He attended Peekskill High School before a brief spell at teacher training college. Bishop served in the United States Army as a disc jockey with the Armed Forces Radio at St. John's in Newfoundland where he was introduced to acting with the St John's Players. After leaving the army, Bishop enrolled at Boston University where he initially studied business administration but halfway through the course, transferred to drama, much against his parents' wishes. After graduating in Theatre Arts, he won a Fulbright Scholarship to study for two years at the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art, from which he graduated in 1959; he almost immediately found work in the British theatre and film industries. He adopted the stage name \\"Ed Bishop\\" at this time to distinguish himself from George Bishop, an established actor of the time. His first Broadway appearance was as Villebosse in David Merrick's production of Jean Anouilh's The Rehearsal in 1963, though he returned to Britain in 1964. Career Bishop made his film acting debut as an ambulance driver in Stanley Kubrick's 1962 movie Lolita. He played an American astronaut going to the Moon in the film The Mouse on the Moon (1963) and also appeared in The Bedford Incident (1965) and Battle Beneath the Earth (1967). He also had small speaking roles in the James Bond films You Only Live Twice (1967) and Diamonds Are Forever (1971), but was not included in either film's credits. He appeared in a second Kubrick film, 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968), in which he played the Captain of the Aries 1B Moon shuttle. The role initially featured dialogue, though this was later cut from his scenes. Bishop appeared in various film and television projects created by producer Gerry Anderson. He provided narration, in addition to the voice of Captain Blue, for Anderson's Supermarionation puppet series, Captain Scarlet and the Mysterons (1967) and appeared in Anderson's science-fiction film Doppelgänger (1969). Perhaps his most prominent screen role of all was as Commander Ed Straker in Anderson's science-fiction series UFO (1970–71). Bishop had his dark hair dyed blond for the role, though he eventually wore a blond wig instead. In later years, he appeared in films such as Twilight's Last Gleaming, Saturn 3, Silver Dream Racer and The Lords of Discipline. Bishop also provided vocal work for the 1974 animated TV series of Star Trek and appeared as Lieutenant Colonel Harrity in the final episode of the British World War II prisoner-of-war drama Colditz. In the 1980s, he made several appearances on The Kenny Everett Television Show, Whoops Apocalypse (he also appeared in the subsequent film) and had a role in the children's television series Chocky's Children.. On radio, in 1977 and 1978 he played the private eye Philip Marlowe in The BBC Presents: Philip Marlowe, adaptations of Raymond Chandler's stories for the BBC, the last of them, Farewell, My Lovely, produced nearly a decade after the others, as the rights had previously been unavailable. Bishop continued to act on film, TV and radio, usually in British and other European productions, and was a frequent guest at science fiction conventions. Bishop and fellow Anderson actor Shane Rimmer (a Canadian actor who often worked in the UK) often joked about how often their professional paths crossed and termed themselves \\"Rent-a-yank\\". They appeared together as NASA operatives in the opening of You Only Live Twice and as United States Navy sailors in The Bedford Incident, as well as the 1983 film of the Harold Robbins novel The Lonely Lady. In 1989, Bishop was reunited with Rimmer and another Anderson actor, Matt Zimmerman, in the BBC Radio 4 adaptation of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's A Study in Scarlet. Bishop and Rimmer also toured together in theatre shows including Death of a Salesman in the 1990s and also appeared in the BBC drama-documentary Hiroshima (2005), one of Bishop's last TV projects. In 2000, Bishop briefly reprised the role of Captain Blue in a trailer for the new Captain Scarlet series. He did not, however, reprise the role for the actual series, which would not debut until five years later. In 2002, Bishop recorded a commentary for the DVD release of UFO. In 2003, he performed in the Doctor Who audio drama, Full Fathom Five, produced by Big Finish Productions. Personal life Bishop was politically active, participating in the March 2003 UK protest against the Iraq War. Bishop had already shown his disapproval of the military-industrial complex when, in 1993, he gatecrashed an arms-trade fair held in Aldershot, Hampshire whilst dressed to resemble Augusto Pinochet. During the Aldershot protest he met photographer Jane Skinner, who later became his third wife. Bishop was married three times; first to Jane Thwaites in 1955 before divorcing a few months later in the year. He then married Hilary Preen in 1962; they had four children, they remained married for thirty-four years before divorcing in 1996. He later married photographer Jane Skinner in 2001, the marriage lasted until his death in 2005.https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1491788/Ed-Bishop.html Death Bishop's grave in St Lawrence churchyard, Napton, Warwickshire Bishop died on 8 June 2005 at the age of 72, three days before his 73rd birthday, and five days after the death of his UFO co-star Michael Billington. He succumbed to a chest infection contracted while undergoing treatment for leukemia. He is buried in the churchyard of the Parish Church of Saint Lawrence in Napton, Warwickshire, having previously lived there for many years. His grey sandstone tombstone has a peace symbol prominently engraved on it. Its design is very similar to the one situated two metres on the right, which marks the grave of his son Daniel (16 May 1967 – 18 January 1988), who was killed in a car accident in Cumbria. Bishop's epitaph (from Red River Valley) reads: From This Valley They Say You Are Going. We Shall Miss Your Bright Eyes And Your Smile. He spent the last few years of his life living in West Molesey. His life and work was honoured at the British Academy Television Awards in May 2006. He is survived by his widow, by three daughters from his second marriage (Georgina, Jessica and Serina) and by his first son, Warren, from his first marriage.

Brialmont qualified as an officer in the Belgian army engineers in 1843 and quickly rose up the ranks. He served as a staff officer, and later was given command of the district of the key port of Antwerp. He finished his careers as Inspector-General of the Army. Brialmont was also an active pamphleteer and political campaigner and lobbied through his career for reform and expansion of the Belgian military and was also involved in the foundation of the Congo Free State. Today, Brialmont is best known for the fortifications which he designed in Belgium and Romania and would influence another in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The fortifications he designed in Belgium at the end of the 1880s around the towns of Liège, Namur and Antwerp would play an important role during the early stages of the German invasion of Belgium during World War I. Early life Henri-Alexis Brialmont was born in Venlo in Dutch Limburg in 1821. His father, Mathieu Brialmont, had served in the French Grand Armée during the Napoleonic Wars and had reached the rank of Captain. During Dutch rule in Belgium, Mathieu served in the Dutch army and, after Belgian independence in 1830, joined the Belgian army. In 1849 he was made General, and was appointed Minister of War in 1850. Although Venlo is not situated in Belgium today, the whole of Limburg was a disputed territory over which the Belgian government claimed control after the Belgian Revolution. Belgium was forced to relinquish its claims at the Treaty of London in 1839 and today Limburg is divided in a Dutch and a Belgian part. Henri-Alexis performed poorly at school but succeeded in getting into a military academy. In 1859, during his military career, he married the daughter of the journalist and leading figure of the Belgian Revolution, Louis de Potter. Military career Painting depicting a Belgian fort of the period under construction Brialmont graduated from military school in 1843 as a Sous-lieutenant of the Engineers. He quickly rose up the ranks, being promoted to Lieutenant in 1847. From 1847 to 1850 he was private secretary to the war minister, General Baron Félix Chazal. In 1855 he entered the staff corps, was promoted to the rank of major in 1861, lieutenant-colonel in 1864, colonel in 1868. In 1874 he was promoted to major-general and was appointed to oversee the fortifications of Belgium's major port, Antwerp, the same year. In 1877 he was promoted to Lieutenant General and later to Inspector-General of the Army; a post which he held until his retirement in 1892. During the Belgian response to the Franco-Prussian War of 1870–71, Brialmont, then a colonel, served as chief-of-staff of the Army of Antwerp, assigned to defending the National Redoubt at Antwerp. However, during his whole military career, Brialmost never once served in a war, even though some Belgian soldiers served as volunteers during the Mexican Adventure (1861–67) and during fighting for the Unification of Italy. Political activities Statue of Brialmont in central Brussels From his early career, Brialmont advocated expanding the importance of the Belgian army. In 1850, he convinced his father to resign his ministerial post rather than consent to a lowering of defence spending. His stance put him into conflict with Walthère Frère-Orban and the Liberals. From 1855, he began campaigning for restructuring of the defenses of the crucial port city of Antwerp in north- east Belgium. Despite being officially warned off the politically unpopular project, he continued. In the mid 1850s, he published a series of pamphlets arguing for the reorganization and expansion of the tiny Belgian navy, which he believed could be used for imperialist purposes projecting Belgian influence abroad. Although King Leopold I was deeply opposed to Brialmont's plans, his son Leopold, Duke of Brabant (the future King Leopold II) was impressed by his ideas and the two corresponded frequently. Brialmont felt that colonial expansion was essential to make Belgium a world power, and was an energetic supporter of Leopold II's Congo Free State, which he even helped to found, from the 1880s. Nevertheless, Brialmont refused the offer of becoming Leopold II's aide-de-camp. In the aftermath of the Franco-Prussian War, Brialmont became an advocate for the abolition of the Remplacement system of conscription and the adoption of a form of universal military service. Political and historical writings Brialmont was an energetic writer on military and political subjects. In 1851, he published his first major work, entitled Considérations politiques et militaires sur la Belgique, which was well received. In 1872, he created the newspaper La Belgique Militaire. He also wrote a number of historical works, including an account of the campaigns of the Duke of Wellington. Fortress design As a result of Brialmont's lobbying, Belgium undertook an ambitious programme of fortress design between 1887 and 1892. In addition to forts built at Antwerp after 1859 on Brialmont's instructions, twelve new forts were built at Liège and nine in Namur. The entrance to the Fort d'Embourg, near Liège, which was designed by Brialmont and built between 1881 and 1884 Brialmont believed that, in order to protect cities from long-range artillery, it was important to move fortifications several miles outside the city itself. On average the forts he constructed were situated outside the settlement they were intended to defend. In order to guarantee effective protection, a number of forts distributed around the city's perimeter were required. Using new materials, many of these newer fortifications were built of concrete and incorporated retractable gun cupolas, often based along triangular or trapezoid plans. Because of the need to use specialist workers, the construction process was slow and expensive. He was also an early supporter of using wire entanglements for defensive purposes. In an 1879 pamphlet, he advocated the use of wire barricades against infantry assaults. The Brialmont forts would be used for the first time after Brialmont's death during the German invasion of Belgium in 1914. The system of fortifications established by Brialmont was at the heart of the ultimately unsuccessful Belgian defensive strategy and led to decisive battles at major fortified regions, including the Battles of Liège, Namur and Antwerp between August and October 1914. Ultimately the fortifications proved ineffective against new, large caliber German siege artillery such as the \\"Big Bertha\\" and Austrian Model 1911 howitzers. After the end of the First World War, some of the forts were upgraded and also saw service in the Battle of Belgium in May 1940. Romania In 1882, Brialmont was commissioned by King Carol I of Romania to design a series of fortifications to protect the new Kingdom of Romania (which received its independence from the Ottoman Empire in 1877) against invasion and to enhance the status of its new capital, Bucharest. Brialmont was refused permission by the Belgian government to visit Romania in his official capacity and instead went to Romania as a private citizen. Work on the ring of 18 forts around Bucharest began in 1883 and lasted until 1900. On his return he was accused by Frère-Orban of having endangered Belgian neutrality. While the Bucharest fortifications never served their intended defensive purpose, they were a major influence on the subsequent development and urban planning of the city. The routes constructed to link the forts served as the basis for the modern Bucharest ring-road. Influence Captain-Commandant Émile Wangermée, one of Brialmont's pupils, was instrumental in the design of the Fort de Shinkakasa (built 1891–94) at Boma in the Congo Free State. The fort, based on those designed by Brialmont at the Meuse, was designed to house coastal artillery to protect the Congo River, the main artery in Leopold II's personal colony, against Portuguese encroachment. The fort was the site of a significant mutiny in 1900. References=Sources   , col. 267-70. Further reading * P. CROKAERT, Brialmont (contenant les mémoires du général). * P.

Since district magistrates are responsible for the collection of land revenue in the district, the post is also referred to as the District Collector in terms of the revenue department, and as the office-bearer works under the supervision of a Divisional Commissioner. The post is also known as Deputy Commissioner in several Indian states like Delhi, Haryana, Punjab, Himachal Pradesh etc. In the revenue department, the Deputy Collectors (also called Deputy District Collector) is usually a tehsildars who report into the District Revenue Officer (DRO) who is also called the Additional District Collector and is the overall in-charge of revenue department for the district, DRO in turn reports into the District Collector (also called District Commissioner) who is in-charge of overall management of the district across all departments. Deputy Collectors are hired through State's Service Selection Commission, where as DRO and District Collector are usually Centre Civil Services employees appointed to the state cadre.  History  District administration in India is a legacy of the British Raj. District collectors were members of the Indian Civil Service and were charged with supervising general administration in the district. Warren Hastings introduced the office of the district collector in 1772. Sir George Campbell, lieutenant-governor of Bengal from 1871-1874, intended \\"to render the heads of districts no longer the drudges of many departments and masters of none, but in fact the general controlling authority over all departments in each district.\\" The office of a collector during the British Raj held multiple responsibilitiesas collector, he was the head of the revenue organization, charged with registration, alteration, and partition of holdings; the settlement of disputes; the management of indebted estates; loans to agriculturists, and famine relief. As district magistrate, he exercised general supervision over the inferior courts and in particular, directed the police work. The office was meant to achieve the \\"peculiar purpose\\" of collecting revenue and of keeping the peace. The superintendent of police (SP), inspector general of jails, the surgeon general, the divisional forest officer (DFO) and the chief engineer (CE) had to inform the collector of every activity in their departments. Until the later part of the nineteenth century, no native was eligible to become a district collector. But with the introduction of open competitive examinations for the Indian Civil Service, the office was opened to natives. Anandaram Baruah, an eminent scholar of Sanskrit and the sixth Indian and the first Assamese ICS officer, became the third Indian to be appointed a district magistrate, the first two being Romesh Chandra Dutt and Sripad Babaji Thakur respectively. The district continued to be the unit of administration after India gained independence in 1947. The role of the district collector remained largely unchanged, except for the separation of most judicial powers to judicial officers of the district. Later, with the promulgation of the National Extension Services and Community Development Programme by the Nehru government in 1952, the district collector was entrusted with the additional responsibility of implementing the Government of India's development programs in the district.  Posting  They are posted by the state government, from among the pool of Indian Administrative Service (IAS) officers, who either are on Level 11, Level 12 or Level 13 of the Pay Matrix, in the state. The members of the IAS are either directly recruited by the Union Public Service Commission, promoted from State Civil Service (SCS) or nominated from Non-State Civil Service (Non-SCS). The direct recruits are posted as collectors after five to six years of service, whereas the promoted members from state civil services generally occupy this post after promotion to the IAS, which generally happens after two decades of service. A district magistrate and collector is transferred to and from the post by the state government. The office bearer is generally of the rank of under secretary/deputy secretary or director in Government of India.  Functions and responsibilities  The responsibilities assigned to a district magistrate vary from state to state, but generally, district collectors are entrusted with a wide range of duties in the jurisdiction of the district, generally involving the following: ;As district magistrate: * Conducts criminal court of executive magistrate. * Maintenance of law and order. * Co ordinates of the police . * Supervision of subordinate executive magistracy and conduct magisterial inquiries. * Hearing cases under the preventive section of the Criminal Procedure Code. * Supervision of jails and certification of execution of capital sentences. * Inspection of police stations, prisons and juvenile homes in the district. * Authorising parole orders to inmates. * Granting arms and ammunition licence under Arms Act. * Prepares panel of names for appointment of public prosecutors and additional public prosecutors with consultation with session judge in district. * Disaster management during natural calamities such as floods, famines or epidemics. * Crisis management during riots or external aggression. * Child Labour/bonded labour related matters. ;As district collector * Conducts revenue court. * Arbitrator of land acquisition, its assessment and collection of land revenue. * Collection of income tax dues, excise duties, irrigation dues and its arrears. * Registration of Property documents, sale deeds, power of attorneys, defacement, share certificates etc. * Issue various kinds of statutory certificates including SC/ST, OBC & EWC, Domicile, Nationality, Marriage, etc. * Relief and rehabilitation. * Custodian of evacuee and migrant property * Inspection of various district offices, sub divisions and tehsils. ;As deputy commissioner/district commissioner: * Co-ordination with various local bodies, departments and agencies for proper administration. * Reports to divisional commissioner on all matters.

Laurel and Hardy were one of the first pairings, appearing in buddy films from the 1930s onward. The buddy film is a film genre in which 2 people—often both men—are put together and on an adventure, a quest, or a road trip. The two often contrast in personality, which creates a different dynamic onscreen than a pairing of two people of the opposite gender. The contrast is sometimes accentuated by an ethnic difference between the two. The buddy film is commonplace in American cinema; unlike some other film genres, it endured through the 20th century with different pairings and different themes. Male–male relationships A buddy film portrays the pairing of two people, often the same sex, historically men. A friendship between the two people is the key relationship in a buddy film. The two people often come from different backgrounds or have different personalities, and they tend to misunderstand one another. Through the events of the buddy film, they gain a stronger friendship and mutual respect. Buddy films often deal with crises of masculinity, especially related to class, race, and gender. American Masculinities: A Historical Encyclopedia explains, \\"[Buddy films] offer male movie–going audiences an opportunity to indulge in a form of male bonding and behavior usually discouraged by social constraints.\\" Ira Konigsberg wrote in The Complete Film Dictionary, \\"Such films extol the virtues of male comradeship and relegate male–female relationships to a subsidiary position.\\" Female–female friendships A female buddy film is similar to a buddy film except that the main characters are female, and it is centered on their situation. The cast may be mainly female depending on the plot. \\"The female buddy film is a recent trend in mainstream cinema. However, Thelma and Louise in the early ‘90s had a similar popular impact to Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, paving the way for onscreen female friendships such as those in Waiting to Exhale and Walking and Talking, and the relationship between Evelyn Couch and Ninny Threadgoode in Fried Green Tomatoes',.\\" Hybrid genres Buddy films are often hybridized with other film genres, such as road movies, Westerns, comedies, and action films featuring cops. The \\"threats to [the] masculinity\\" of the male–male relationship depend on the genre: women in comedies, the law in films about outlaw buddies, and criminals in action films about cop buddies. History=Pre-1930s The buddy film is more common to cinema in the United States than cinema in other Western countries, which tend to focus on male–female romantic relationships or an individual male hero. Film historian David Thomson observes that buddy films are rare among British and French films, \\"You just wouldn't see three Englishmen behave the way American men do, who are truly happiest when they are together with other men.\\" Portrayal of male bonding in the United States traces back to 19th-century author Mark Twain's characters Huck Finn and Tom Sawyer as a \\"good boy-bad boy combo\\", as well as Huck Finn and the slave Jim in Twain's 1884 novel Adventures of Huckleberry Finn. Vaudeville acts in early 20th century United States often featured male pairs.Another example could be 1881's The Prince and the Pauper with Prince Edward and Miles Hendon. 1930s to 1960s: Comedy duos From the 1930s to the 1960s in the United States, male comedy duos often appeared in buddy films. Laurel and Hardy and Abbott and Costello were popular in the 1930s and 1940s. Laurel and Hardy starred in films like Sons of the Desert (1933), and Abbott and Costello starred in films like Buck Privates (1941). Another comedy duo was Wheeler & Woolsey, who starred in Half Shot at Sunrise (1930). Bing Crosby and Bob Hope starred together in the 1940 Paramount Pictures film Road to Singapore, which led to other 1940s buddy films that the Los Angeles Times described as \\"escapist wartime fantasies\\". Hope and Crosby starred together in a series of films that lasted to the 1960s. Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis were a popular duo in the 1950s, and Walter Matthau and Jack Lemmon were famous in the 1960s, starring in the hit 1968 film The Odd Couple. A major departure from the more comic buddy films of the era was Akira Kurosawa's 1949 Japanese film Stray Dog, starring Toshirō Mifune and Takashi Shimura. It was a more serious police procedural film noir that served as a precursor to the buddy cop film genre. 1960s to 1970s: Responses to feminism and society Throughout the 1960s and the 1970s, the feminist movement and \\"a widespread questioning\\" of social institutions influenced buddy films. The films explored male friendships more dramatically and encouraged individualism—particularly to be free from women and society. Critics like Molly Haskell and Robin Wood saw the decades' films as \\"a backlash from the feminist movement.\\" Philippa Gates wrote, \\"To punish women for their desire for equality, the buddy film pushes them out of the center of the narrative... By making both protagonists men, the central issue of the film becomes the growth and development of their friendship. Women as potential love interests are thus eliminated from the narrative space.\\" The buddy films of these decades were also hybridized with road movies. The decades' buddy films included Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969), Easy Rider (1969), Midnight Cowboy (1969), Thunderbolt and Lightfoot (1974), and Dog Day Afternoon (1975). The Los Angeles Times said films like Scarecrow (1973) and All the President's Men (1976) reflected the \\"paranoia and alienation\\" felt in the era. Beyond Hollywood, a notable buddy road movie of that era was the Bollywood \\"Curry Western\\" film Sholay (1975), which was the highest-grossing Indian film of all time. Biracial buddy films emerged in the 1970s and 1980s; Richard Pryor and Gene Wilder initiated the movement with Silver Streak (1976) and Stir Crazy (1980). Eddie Murphy was a key actor in biracial buddy films, starring in 48 Hours (1982) with Nick Nolte and in Trading Places (1983) with Dan Aykroyd. Throughout the 1980s, the individual roles in biracial buddy films are reversed. The \\"racial other... is too civilized\\" while the white man \\"is equipped for survival in... the urban landscape\\". 1980s: Action films and biracial pairings The 1980s was a popular decade for action films, and the genre that \\"blended masculinity, heroism, and patriotism into an idealized image\\" was hybridized with buddy films. Following the Civil Rights Movement, black advancement was also reflected in more common biracial pairings. In this decade, the buddy cop film took the place of the buddy road movie. Action films with biracial pairings include the 1982 film 48 Hours starring Eddie Murphy and Nick Nolte and the 1987 film Lethal Weapon starring Mel Gibson and Danny Glover.Another combination of the action film and the buddy film in the 1980s and another biracial reversal was the 1988 film Die Hard in which Bruce Willis's heroic character John McClane is supported by the black cop Al (played by Reginald VelJohnson). 1990s: New approaches to the genre In the early 1990s, the masculine figure in films became more sensitive, and some buddy films \\"contemplated a masculinity that required sensitive relations between men\\". Such films included The Fisher King (1991) and The Shawshank Redemption (1994). The decade also saw new approaches to the genre. The 1991 film Thelma & Louise featured a female pairing of Geena Davis and Susan Sarandon, and the 1993 film The Pelican Brief featured a male–female platonic pairing of Julia Roberts and Denzel Washington. The 1998 film Rush Hour featured a nonwhite male pairing of Jackie Chan and Chris Tucker, which the Los Angeles Times said symbolized color blindness in American cinema. Biracial buddy films continued in the 1990s and 2000s and were combined with different genres, such as White Men Can't Jump (1992), Bulletproof (1996), Gridlock'd (1997), National Security (2003) and The Bucket List (2007). Also in the 1990s and 2000s, John Woo's Hollywood films imported the wuxia \\"themes of loyalty and trust\\" from his previous Hong Kong-produced films to create different takes on male bonding. Kin–Yan Szeto writes in The Martial Arts Cinema of the Chinese Diaspora, \\"[In] his third Hollywood film, Face/Off... Woo manages to deploy and politicize themes of homosociality with the possibility of contesting hegemonic masculinity that consolidates kinship and family.\\" Woo's 2001 World War II film Windtalkers depicted two buddy pairs, with each pair indicating inequality through ethnicity (white American soldiers protecting Navajo code talkers but ready to kill the talkers to protect the code). Szeto explains, \\"Woo uses the twin buddy pairs to explore the shifting meanings and multiple possibilities in interracial bonding, rather than simply recuperating and empowering dominant positions for white heterosexual men.\\" Selected filmography=Comedy *The Flying Deuces (1939)Robb, Brian J.

These species include domestic cattle (\\"cows\\"), bison (\\"buffalo\\"), yak, and water buffalo. Cow dung is the undigested residue of plant matter which has passed through the animal's gut. The resultant faecal matter is rich in minerals. Color ranges from greenish to blackish, often darkening soon after exposure to air. Uses Cow dung, which is usually a dark brown color, is often used as manure (agricultural fertilizer). If not recycled into the soil by species such as earthworms and dung beetles, cow dung can dry out and remain on the pasture, creating an area of grazing land which is unpalatable to livestock. In many parts of the developing world, and in the past in mountain regions of Europe, caked and dried cow dung is used as fuel. Dung may also be collected and used to produce biogas to generate electricity and heat. The gas is rich in methane and is used in rural areas of India and Pakistan and elsewhere to provide a renewable and stable (but unsustainable) source of electricity. In central Africa, Maasai villages have burned cow dung inside to repel mosquitos. In cold places, cow dung is used to line the walls of rustic houses as a cheap thermal insulator. Most of villagers in India spray fresh cow dung mixed with water in front of the houses to repel insects. It is also dried into cake like shapes and used as replacement for firewood. In Rwanda, it is used in an art form called imigongo. Cow dung fuel in Bangladesh Cow dung is also an optional ingredient in the manufacture of adobe mud brick housing depending on the availability of materials at hand. A deposit of cow dung is referred to in American English as a \\"cow pie,\\" or less commonly \\"cow chip,\\" and in British English as a \\"cowpat\\". When dry, it is used in the practice of \\"cow chip throwing\\" popularized in Beaver, Oklahoma in 1970.Town of Beaver, Oklahoma On April 21, 2001 Robert Deevers of Elgin, Oklahoma, set the record for cow chip throwing with a distance of . Cow dung is also used in Hindu religious fire yajna as an important ingredient. Cow dung is also used in the making of panchgavya, for use in Hindu rituals. Cow dung is nowadays used for making flower and plant pots. It is plastic free, bio degradable and eco friendly. Unlike plastic grow bags which harms nature, cow dung pots dissolves naturally and becomes excellent manure for the plant. Ecology Cow dung provides food for a wide range of animal and fungus species, which break it down and recycle it into the food chain and into the soil. In areas where cattle (or other mammals with similar dung) are not native, there are often also no native species which can break down their dung, and this can lead to infestations of pests such as flies and parasitic worms. In Australia, dung beetles from elsewhere have been introduced to help recycle the cattle dung back into the soil. (see the Australian Dung Beetle Project and Dr. George Bornemissza).Bornemissza, G. F. (1976), The Australian dung beetle project 1965-1975, Australian Meat Research Committee Review 30:1-30 Cattle have a natural aversion to feeding around their own dung. This can lead to the formation of taller ungrazed patches of heavily fertilized sward. These habitat patches, termed \\"islets\\", can be beneficial for many grassland arthropods, including spiders (Araneae) and bugs (Hemiptera). They have an important function in maintaining biodiversity in heavily utilized pastures.Dittrich, A. D. K. and Helden A. J. 2012. Experimental sward islets: the effect of dung and fertilisation on Hemiptera and Araneae. Insect Conservation and Diversity 5:46-56. Variants A buffalo chip, also called a meadow muffin, is the name for a large, flat, dried piece of dung deposited by the American bison. Well dried buffalo chips were among the few things that could be collected and burned on the prairie and were used by the Plains Indians, settlers and pioneers, and homesteaders as a source of cooking heat and warmth. Bison dung is sometimes referred to by the name nik- nik. This word is a borrowing from the Sioux language (which probably originally borrowed it from a northern source). In modern Sioux, nik-nik can refer to the feces of any bovine, including domestic cattle. It has also come to be used, especially in Lakota, to refer to lies or broken promises, analogously to the vulgar English term \\"bullshit\\" as a figure of speech.

He summoned all the town and demanded that the court shorthand writer take down every word he said, among which he complained: \\"I was charged before [the Magistrate of Reitz] for beating a native boy. I only did it with a small shepherd's whip, and for that I was fined 5/–\\". On hearing the contents of the speech, General Smuts christened the rising as \\"the Five Shilling Rebellion\\". (). Other sources place the incident in the town of Vrede on 28 October 1914 - see, for example, P.J. Sampson, The Capture of De Wet: the South African Rebellion, 1914 (1915), pp. 145-146., was an armed insurrection in South Africa in 1914, at the start of World War I. It was led by Boers who supported the re- establishment of the South African Republic in the Transvaal. Many members of the South African government were themselves former Boers who had fought with the Maritz rebels against the British in the Second Boer War, which had ended twelve years earlier. The rebellion failed, and its ringleaders received heavy fines and terms of imprisonment.  Prelude  At the end of the Second Boer War twelve years earlier, all former Boer combatants had been asked to sign a pledge that they would abide by the peace terms. Some, like Deneys Reitz, refused and were exiled from South Africa. Over the following decade many returned home, and not all of them signed the pledge upon returning. At the end of the second Boer War, those Boers who had fought to the end were known as \\"\\" (\\"bitter enders\\"); by the time of the rebellion, those who had not taken the pledge and wanted to start a new war had also become known as the \\"bitter enders.\\" A German journalist who interviewed the former Boer general J. B. M. Hertzog for the wrote: Paraphrasing the Irish Nationalists' \\"England's misfortune is the bitter enders' opportunity,\\" the \\"bitter enders\\" and their supporters saw the start of World War I as that opportunity, particularly since England's enemy, Germany, had been their old supporter.  First World War starts  The outbreak of hostilities in Europe in August 1914 had long been anticipated, and the government of the Union of South Africa was well aware of the significance of the common border South Africa shared with the German colony of South-West Africa. Prime Minister Louis Botha informed London that South Africa could defend itself and that the imperial garrison could depart for France; when the British government asked Botha whether his forces would invade German South-West Africa, the reply was that they could and would. South African troops were mobilised along the border between the two countries under the command of General Henry Lukin and Lieutenant Colonel Manie Maritz early in September 1914. On 19 September 1914 another force occupied the German port of .Luderitz Municipal Cemetery.  Rebellion  The Commandant-General of the Union Defence Force, Brigadier-General Christiaan Frederick Beyers was opposed to the South African government's decision to undertake offensive operations. He resigned his commission on 15 September 1914, writing \\"It is sad that the war is being waged against the 'barbarism' of the Germans. We have forgiven but not forgotten all the barbarities committed in our own country during the South African War\\", referring to the atrocities committed during the Boer War. A nominated senator, General Koos de la Rey, who had refused to support the government in parliament over this issue, associated himself with Beyers. On 15 September they set off together to visit Major JCG (Jan) Kemp in Potchefstroom, who had a large armoury and a force of 2,000 men who had just finished training, many of whom were thought to be sympathetic to the rebels' ideas. Although it is not known what the purpose of their visit was, the South African government believed it to be an attempt to instigate a rebellion, as stated in the Government Blue Book on the rebellion.The \\"Blue Book\\" was issued by the Union of South Africa government on 26 February 1915, entitled [The] Report on the Outbreak of the Rebellion and the Policy of the Government with regard to its Suppression. () According to General Beyers it was to discuss plans for the simultaneous resignation of leading army officers as protest against the government's actions, similar to what had happened in Britain two years earlier in the Curragh incident over the Irish Home Rule Bill. On the way to the meeting de la Rey's car was fired upon by a policeman at a road block set up to look for the Foster gang. De la Rey was hit and killed. At his funeral, however, many Nationalist Afrikaners believed and perpetuated the rumour that it was a government assassination, which added fuel to the fire. Their anger was even further inflamed by Siener van Rensburg and his controversial prophecies. Lt-Col Maritz, who was head of a commando of Union forces on the border of German South-West Africa, allied himself with the Germans. He then issued a proclamation on behalf of a provisional government. It stated that \\"the former South African Republic and Orange Free State as well as the Cape Province and Natal are proclaimed free from British control and independent, and every White inhabitant of the mentioned areas, of whatever nationality, are hereby called upon to take their weapons in their hands and realize the long-cherished ideal of a Free and Independent South Africa.\\" \\"My Lewe en Strewe\\" by Manie Maritz, 1939. It was announced that Generals Beyers, de Wet, Maritz, Kemp and Bezuidenhout were to be the first leaders of this provisional government. Maritz's forces occupied Keimoes in the Upington area. The Lydenburg commando under General De Wet took possession of the town of Heilbron, held up a train and captured government stores and ammunition. Some of the prominent citizens of the area joined him, and by the end of the week he had a force of 3,000 men. Beyers also gathered a force in the Magaliesberg; in all, about 12,000 rebels rallied to the cause. The irony was that General Louis Botha had around 32,000 troops to counter the rebels and of the 32,000 troops about 20,000 of them were Afrikaners. The government declared martial law on 12 October 1914,On This Day - 12 October 1914. and forces loyal to the government under the command of General Louis Botha and Jan Smuts proceeded to destroy the rebellion. General Maritz was defeated on 24 October and took refuge with the Germans. The Beyers commando was attacked and dispersed at Commissioners Drift on 28 October, after which Beyers joined forces with Kemp, but drowned in the Vaal River on 8 December. General de Wet was captured in Bechuanaland on 1 December 1914, with 52 others on a farm called Waterbury. His remark when captured was: \\"Thank God it was not an Englishman who captured me after all\\". His grandson, Dr , then Minister of Health, consecrated a monument at this spot on 14 February 1970. General Kemp, having taken his commando across the Kalahari desert, losing 300 out of 800 men and most of their horses on the 1,100 kilometre month-long trek, joined Maritz in German South-West Africa, but returned after about a week and surrendered on 4 February 1915.  Aftermath  After the Maritz rebellion was suppressed, the South African army continued their operations into German South West Africa and conquered it by July 1915. Compared to the fate of the ringleaders of the Easter Rising in Ireland in 1916, the leading Boer rebels got off relatively lightly with terms of imprisonment of six and seven years and heavy fines. Two years later they were released from prison, as Louis Botha recognised the value of reconciliation. One notable exception was Jopie Fourie, a Union Defence Force officer who had failed to resign his commission before joining the rebellion. He was executed.

Goodbye to a River is a book by John Graves, published in 1960. It is a \\"semi-historical\\" account of a canoe trip made by the author during the fall of 1957 down a stretch of the Brazos River in North Central Texas, between Possum Kingdom Dam and Lake Whitney. The book presents both the author's account of the trip itself and numerous stories about the history and settlement of the area around the river and of North Central Texas. The title refers to Graves' childhood association with the river and the country surrounding it, and his fear of the \\"drowning\\" effect that a proposed series of flood-control dams (most notably, Lake Granbury) would have on the river. Only three of the dams were built on the river, but at one time up to thirteen were proposed at various locations along its course to the Gulf of Mexico. The success of Goodbye to a River is often cited as a major reason that the proposed dams were never built. The book is acclaimed as a work of both conservationism and history and has been compared to Walden by Henry David Thoreau.

The battalion served as infantry on the Western Front during World War I. In the 1930s it re-roled as an anti-aircraft unit and served in World War II, including North-western Europe from June 1944 to May 1945. Formation Plaque on the terrace of Nottingham Castle commemorating the raising of the Robin Hood Rifles in 1859 The unit was formed on 30 May 1859 when six volunteers paraded at Nottingham Castle under Sergeant-Major Jonathan White. (White became the Adjutant and was still an officer in the corps 40 years later with the honorary rank of colonel.Army List, various dates.) It was one of many such Rifle Volunteer Corps (RVCs) to be formed at a time of increased fear of war with France, which created a flurry of interest in establishing such volunteer corps by the more affluent classes of British society.Beckett.Spiers, pp. 163–8. The unit was simply known as the Robin Hood Rifles in honour of Nottingham's legendary Robin Hood. Uniform of the Robin Hood Rifles depicted on a 1939 cigarette card By October 1859, five separate company-sized Rifle Volunteer Corps (RVCs) had been raised in Nottingham, the first officers' commissions were issued on 15 November, and by December they had been combined into a battalion as the Robin Hood RVC, becoming the 1st Nottinghamshire (Robin Hood) RVC of nine companies by March 1860. One company was raised by A.J. Mundella from employees of his hosiery mill. The unit adopted a uniform of Rifle green with black facings.Beckett, p. 70 & Appendix VII.Westlake, p. 194-5. In 1881, following the Cardwell-Childers Reforms, the Sherwood Foresters (Derbyshire Regiment), later the Sherwood Foresters (Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire Regiment), was formed as the county regiment, and the 1st Nottinghamshire (Robin Hood) RVC (now 10 companies strong) became its 3rd Volunteer Battalion without changing its title. An 11th company was added in 1895, a 12th in 1896, and during the Second Boer War 1900–01 the establishment was increased in 1900–01 to 18 companies (including two cyclist companies), divided into two battalions, together with a cadet corps at Nottingham High School. The battalion was part of the North Midland Brigade from 1888 until 1901 when that formation split to form a separate Sherwood Foresters Brigade. Boer War In 1900, men of the battalion volunteered for service in the Boer War that which had been raging since 1899 and contingent sailed for South Africa in February. During the campaign it took part in three pitched battles and 25 smaller engagements. Sergeant Hickinbottom was Mentioned in dispatches and awarded the Distinguished Conduct Medal (DCM), and the battalion was awarded its first Battle honour South Africa 1900–1902.Leslie. Territorial Force The Robin Hoods' drill hall in Derby Road, Nottingham. When the Volunteers were subsumed into the new Territorial Force (TF) under the Haldane Reforms of 1908,Dunlop, Chapter 14.Spiers, Chapter 10. the 1st Nottinghamshire Volunteer Rifle Corps became the 7th (Robin Hood) Battalion, Sherwood Foresters.London Gazette 20 March 1908. It built a new Drill Hall in Derby Road in 1910. World War I When the First World War began in August 1914, the Robin Hood Rifles continued to be part of the Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire Brigade (later the 139th (1/1st Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire) Brigade), North Midland Division (later the 46th (North Midland) Division). On 19 September, a duplicate battalion of the Robin Hoods was formed, the original becoming the 1/7th. This duplicate joined the 2nd Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire Brigade, 2nd North Midland Division, which later became the 178th (2nd Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire) Brigade and 59th (2nd North Midland) Division respectively. Another duplicate battalion, the 3/7th, was formed in March 1915; this battalion remained in Britain for the duration of the war, became 7th (Reserve) Battalion in April 1916, later absorbing the 8th (Reserve) Battalion in September 1916. The 1/7th Battalion landed in France in February 1915 with the rest of the 46th Division. The battalion saw heavy fighting at the Battle of Hohenzollern Redoubt – a subsidiary action of the Battle of Loos – which was their first major action of the war. The battalion received its first Victoria Cross (VC) when Temporary Captain Geoffrey Vickers was awarded the VC – the highest award for bravery in the face of the enemy – for his actions at Hohenzollern on 14 October. The battalion was involved in the first day of the Battle of the Somme on 1 July 1916 and the brigade they were part of sustained very severe casualties in the Attack on the Gommecourt Salient. In the home front, the 2/7th Robin Hoods had, meanwhile, been sent to Ireland with the rest of the 59th Division to help suppress the 1916 Easter Uprising in Dublin. The division returned to England in January 1917 and then moved to France in February. The 2/7th Battalion took part in many actions, including the Battle of Passchendaele and Cambrai. The battalion was absorbed by the 1/7th on 31 January 1918 and the Robin Hoods reverted to their original name, the 7th (Robin Hood) Battalion. On 7 May, the 7th Robin Hoods were reduced to cadre strength. The First World War ended on 11 November 1918. On 14 June 1919, the Battalion was disbanded. During the First World War, Captain Albert Ball - fourth ranking ace of the Royal Flying Corps - had been awarded the Victoria Cross for his actions in 1916–1917 while seconded from the Robin Hoods. Between the wars In 1920 the Territorial Force was reformed as the \\"Territorial Army\\" and, on 7 February, the 7th (Robin Hood) Battalion (TA) was re-raised, once more forming part of the 46th (North Midlnad) Division.Titles and Designations. With the advent of air power, and the reduced need for so much infantry, the Robin Hoods were one of many units to be converted to the anti-aircraft role. The battalion re-roled as a unit of the Royal Engineers on 10 December 1936 and became the 42nd (The Robin Hoods, Sherwood Foresters) Anti-Aircraft Battalion, Royal Engineers. It joined the 32nd (Midland) Anti- Aircraft Group, 2nd Anti-Aircraft Division (formerly 46th (North Midland) Division) and was based in the West Riding region. In this role the Robin Hoods were organised as follows:Monthly Army List, May 1939. * Battalion HQ at Nottingham * 366 AA Company at Carlton * 367 AA Company at Beeston * 368 AA Company at Bulwell * 369 AA Company at Sutton-in-Coldfield, Warwickshire World War II=Mobilisation 90 cm 'Projector Anti-Aircraft', displayed at Fort Nelson, Portsmouth The TA's AA units were mobilised on 23 September 1938 during the Munich Crisis, with units manning their emergency positions within 24 hours, even though many did not yet have their full complement of men or equipment. The emergency lasted three weeks, and they were stood down on 13 October.Routledge, pp. 62–3. In February 1939 the existing AA defences came under the control of a new Anti-Aircraft Command. In June a partial mobilisation of TA units was begun in a process known as 'couverture', whereby each AA unit did a month's tour of duty in rotation to man selected AA and searchlight positions. On 24 August, ahead of the declaration of war, AA Command was fully mobilised at its war stations.Routledge, pp. 65–6, 371; Table LX, p. 378. On mobilisation, the battalion deployed 366, 368 and 369 AA Cos as part of 39 AA Bde and battalion HQ moved from Nottingham to Red House at South Collingham, near Newark-on-Trent.39 AA Bde War Diary 1939–41, The National Archives (TNA), Kew, file WO 166/2272. Battle of Britain and Blitz When the RE AA battalions were transferred to the RA in August 1940, the battalion became 42nd (The Robin Hoods, Sherwood Foresters) Searchlight Regiment, RA, retaining its Robin Hoods cap badge in silver for officers and white metal for other ranks, together with a Rifle green lanyard instead of the white lanyard normally worn by the RA.Farndale, Annex M, p. 339.Litchfield, pp. 199–200.42 S/L Rgt at RA 39–45. By now the Battle of Britain was on; the regiment was still in 2 AA Division but had transferred to 50 Light AA Bde covering Nottingham and Derby. It continued to serve with this formation during the Blitz, including the Nottingham Blitz of 8/9 May 1941, a misdirected attempt to bomb the Rolls Royce aero engine works at Derby, which was one of the last raids of the campaign.2 AA Division at RA 39–45.

Mid-War In 1941 the searchlight layout over the Midlands was reorganised, so that any hostile raid approaching the Gun Defended Areas (GDA) around the towns must cross more than one searchlight belt, and then within the GDAs the concentration of lights was increased.Routledge, p. 399. The regiment remained with 50 LAA Bde for the next two years. The brigade became part of 5 AA Group in October 1942 when the AA divisions were scrapped in favour of an organisation that closely corresponded to the groups of RAF Fighter Command. In March 1943, 42nd S/L Rgt moved back to 39 AA Bde, then in April on to 57 AA Bde (with 366 and 369 S/L Btys attached to 50 LAA Bde), and finally in May to 31 (North Midland) AA Bde – all within 5 AA Group.Order of Battle of Non-Field Force Units in the United Kingdom, Part 27: AA Command, 2 December 1941, TNA file WO 212/80.Order of Battle of Non-Field Force Units in the United Kingdom, Part 27: AA Command, 14 May 1942, TNA file WO 212/81.Order of Battle of Non-Field Force Units in the United Kingdom, Part 27: AA Command, 1 October 1942, with amendments, TNA file WO 212/82.Order of Battle of Non- Field Force Units in the United Kingdom, Part 27: AA Command, 13 March 1943, with amendments, TNA file WO 212/83.

North West Europe In early 1944 the regiment was in the North of England under 31 AA Bde, which was one of the formations earmarked for the Allied invasion of Normandy, Operation Overlord. 369 Bty was disbanded on 23 February, and the remainder of the regiment underwent special training to support Night fighters over the Normandy beachhead.31 AA Bde War Diary, February 1944, TNA file WO 171/1080.Order of Battle of AA Command, 27 April 1944, TNA file WO 212/85.Routledge, p. 304. After D-Day (6 June) the regiments of 31 AA Bde waited in England for their turn to embark for Normandy to join 21st Army Group. However, the planned night fighter belt over the beachhead was cancelled and the Robin Hoods remained in England. On 1 August the regiment left its staging camp and deployed in the AA role round RAF Colerne in Wiltshire, then on 6 August it moved to RAF Middle Wallop and relieved 69th (3rd City of London) S/L Rgt, establishing Regimental HQ (RHQ) at Fonthill Abbey, near Tisbury, Wiltshire. On 24 August the regiment was relieved by 54th (Durham Light Infantry) S/L Rgt and concentrated around Tisbury, where it was at 6 hours' notice to move to its marshalling area.42 S/L Rgt War Diary, August–December 1944, TNA file WO 171/1209. On 1 September, RHQ under the command of Lt-Col C.W. Cronin moved to Storrington, West Sussex, and then on 12 September to an embarkation marshalling area at Whipps Cross Camp, near London. From there it embarked at Royal Albert Dock aboard SS Empire Swordsman and disembarked by landing craft at Arromanches-les-Bains in Normandy on 18 September. It then moved by stages to Brussels, where it arrived on 24 September. Also on 1 September, 366 S/L Bty moved from Alderbury, Wiltshire, to a concentration area at West Chiltington, West Sussex, then on 17 September to the embarkation marshalling area at Lee-on- the-Solent, Hampshire. It was shipped to Arromanches in three groups, 18–22 September, and concentrated at Sainte-Croix-sur-Mer before moving to Dieppe where it came under the command of 80 AA Bde on 25 September.366 S/L Bty War Diary, September–December 1944, TNA file WO 171/1209. Similarly, 367 S/L Bty arrived at Brussels, and 368 S/L Bty at Ostend. While 367 SL Bty joined the AA defence of Brussels, the rest of 42nd S/L Rgt was deployed in a joint AA and coastal defence role along the Scheldt estuary. 366 S/L Battery under the operational control of 56 US AA Artillery Bde set up 90 cm lights to illuminate any surface craft trying to approach Antwerp and allow LAA guns to engage them.Routledge, pp. 315, 326, 334–6; Table XLIX, p. 319; Table L, p. 327. Defence of Antwerp V-1 in flight over Antwerp Captured V-1 displayed at Antwerp at the end of World War II. The air situation was quiet until 21 October, when the Germans began a bombardment of Antwerp and Brussels with V-1 flying bombs. With experience drawn from defending against the V-1 attacks on Southern England (Operation Diver), GHQ AA Troops with 21st Army Group had a contingency plan for this, known as 'X' defences. This involved three lines of warning stations in the path of the V-1 attacks, then heavy AA guns at least 10 miles from the target cities. Searchlights were deployed to aid the guns at night, and to mark the boundaries of the X defence areas to warn off friendly aircraft. British units took responsibility for Brussels, but the two batteries of 42nd S/L Rgt deployed at Antwerp were under the command of the US 50th AA Artillery Brigade.Routledge, pp. 336–9. With experience, the defenders improved their effectiveness: in Christmas week, the Antwerp X defences plotted 209 missiles approaching the city, of which 171 came from directions in which it was safe to employ AA guns; of these 102 were engaged and 61 destroyed. The number of V-1s approaching Antwerp reached a peak of 623 a week in February, but declined thereafter. Overall the defenders' success rate was 43.2 per cent of V-1s destroyed by AA fire, reaching 97.5 per cent in March, after which the launch sites in Germany were overrun.Routledge, pp. 339–41.42 S/L Rgt War Diary, January–May 1945, TNA file WO 171/5090. Meanwhile, the Luftwaffe carried out major air raids on the nights of 30/31 December and 31 December/1 January 1945 in connection with Operation Bodenplatte, the attacks on Allied air bases in support of the German Ardennes Offensive. 42 S/L Regiment's lights were heavily involved during the two nights and assisted in the destruction of 5–7 raiders. Although on high alert during the daylight raids, none came close enough to be engaged by the AA light machine guns of the S/L sites. At the end of January, 368 S/L Bty rejoined the regiment from Ostend, driving through bad winter roads. The regiment returned to British command under 80 AA Bde in February. In the last stages of the war, 42nd S/L Rgt moved into Germany to defend the Rhine bridges against conventional air attack, with 366th Bty still deployed on the South Scheldt estuary.Routledge, Table LVII, p. 366. After VE Day the regiment moved to Hamburg to begin occupation duties; in July, 367 S/L Bty was called out to suppress rioting between German and Italian dock workers. The regiment was placed in suspended animation in 1946. Post-War In 1947, the Robin Hoods were reformed in the reconstituted TA as the 577th (The Robin Hoods, Sherwood Foresters) Searchlight Regiment, RA. It formed part of 58 AA Brigade (the pre- war 32nd (North Midland) AA Brigade). Over the next few years the title varied between 'searchlight' and 'light anti-aircraft' until 1953 when it became 'light anti-aircraft/searchlight'. AA Command was disbanded on 10 March 1955 and there were wholesale merges and amalgamations amongst its regiments. The Robin Hoods amalgamated with the 350th (South Nottinghamshire Hussars Yeomanry) Heavy Regiment, Royal Artillery and 528th Light Anti-Aircraft Regiment (West Nottinghamshire) to form the 350th (The Robin Hood Foresters) Heavy Regiment, RA. The following year Heavy was changed to Light.Litchfield, Appendix 5. In 1961, the regiment converted to engineers and re-titled as the 350 (The Robin Hood Foresters) Field Squadron. In 1967, with reforms of the Armed Forces, it left the RE, returning to the Sherwood Foresters as part of The Robin Hood (Territorial) Battalion, a TAVR III (Territorial and Army Volunteer Reserve) unit. In 1969, the Robin Hoods were reduced to cadre strength when they became the Robin Hood (T) Battalion, The Sherwood Foresters, RE. The Robin Hoods were sponsored by 73 Engineer Regiment, RE. In 1971, with further defence reforms, the Robin Hoods became D (Robin Hood Foresters) Company, 3rd (V) Battalion of the newly formed Worcestershire and Sherwood Foresters Regiment. In 1992, the Robin Hood lineage was discontinued upon D Company becoming the HQ Company; the company was disbanded in 1999. Insignia When the battalion transferred to the RA in August 1940 it was allowed to retain its Robin Hoods cap badge in silver for officers and white metal for other ranks, together with a Rifle green Lanyard instead of the white lanyard normally worn by the RA. 42nd (Robin Hoods) S/L Regiment was cited in a decree of the Belgian government on 8 May 1947 for its heroic part in the defence of Antwerp, and members of its successor regiment were permitted to wear a strip of ribbon of the Belgian Croix de Guerre on each shoulder.

During the Second World War, the estate was used by the Royal Air Force. Hutton donated it to the United States after the war, and since 1955 it has been the American ambassador's residence. The house is Grade II listed by Historic England as an \\"exceptional ambassador's residence and as a notable Neo-Georgian town house containing numerous features of note.\\" Hertford Villa The first house on the site was Hertford Villa, the largest of the eight villas originally constructed in the park, in the development scheme of John Nash. This house was designed by Decimus Burton in 1825 for Francis Seymour-Conway, 3rd Marquess of Hertford, who used it for orgies.Stourton. Page 153. Burton's creation was described as, 'decorated simplicity, such as the hand of taste, aided by the purse of wealth can alone execute'. Burton's creation was subsequently reconstructed as a building with a modern exterior. Later, the Georgian villa was known as St Dunstan's because of the distinctive clock that hung in front of it, which was purchased by the art-collecting Marquess of Hertford when material from St Dunstan-in-the-West was auctioned off in 1829–30 prior to the church's demolition for a road- widening scheme.Godwin, George; John Britton (1829).

The house was at first known by the name of its predecessor (St Dunstan's), but Lord Fraser of Lonsdale, head of the charity, approached Hutton to explain that the similarity in the name and location of her house and his organisation (still with an office in Regent's Park) caused confusion, and he asked that she give up the historical name.p. 361 My Story of St Dunstan's (1961) by Lord Fraser of Lonsdale She agreed to the request and chose a new name, derived from her grandfather Frank Winfield Woolworth, who had an estate, Winfield Hall, in Glen Cove, New York. During the Second World War, the house was used by a Royal Air Force barrage balloon unit and as an officer's club. It was visited during the war by film actor Cary Grant, who was married to Hutton at the time. After the war, Hutton sold the house to the American government for one dollar. After extensive alterations, Winfield House became the ambassador's official residence in 1955. The previous residence at 14 Prince's Gate had been deemed inadequately secure. The house is listed on the U.S. Secretary of State's Register of Culturally Significant Property, which denotes properties owned by the U.S. State Department with particular cultural or historical significance. The interiors have undergone extensive alterations at several points, including in 1969 by William Haines, a decorator and former silent film star. Route 66-themed drive connecting the rear grounds to the front entrance Grounds Winfield House is situated within twelve acres of grounds set into Regent's Park, which includes a small front wood, sculpture garden, formal garden, vegetable garden, and tennis court, as well as an extensive lawn which comprises the majority of the acreage. Pathways and drives extend into the grounds, and connect the front garden and entrance to the rear. The property is surrounded by trees, primarily for security and privacy.

He is best known for his experiences living and traveling among the Harakmbut people of Peru, and the Asmat people of Papua, Western New Guinea, Indonesia, then known as Irian Jaya. Early life Schneebaum was born into a family of Jewish emigres from Poland in New York City. Schneebaum's father Jacob (known as Yankle) emigrated to America from Poland just before World War I, in which he served in order to get U.S. citizenship. His mother, Riftcha, emigrated in 1913. He was born as Toivele Schneebaum on Manhattan's Lower East Side and grew up in Brooklyn. A school official later changed this to Theodore Schneebaum, by which he was known by friends and family throughout his childhood. (He later changed his name legally to Tobias.) In 1939 he graduated from the Stuyvesant High School, moving on to the City College of New York, graduating in 1943 after majoring in mathematics and art. During World War II he served as a radar repairman in the U.S. Army. Travels In 1947, after briefly studying painting with Rufino Tamayo at the Brooklyn Museum of Art, Schneebaum went to live and paint in Mexico for three years, living among the Lacandon tribe. In 1955 he won a Fulbright fellowship to travel and paint in Peru. After hitch-hiking from New York to Peru, he lived with the Harakmbut people for seven months, and said he had joined the tribe in cannibalism on one occasion.. He recounted his journey into the jungles of Peru in the 1969 memoir Keep the River on Your Right. Until 1970 he was the designer at Tiber Press, then in 1973 he embarked on his third overseas trip, to Irian Jaya in South East Asia, where he lived with the Asmat people on the south-western coast. He helped establish the Asmat Museum of Culture and Progress. In 1999, he revisited both Irian Jaya and Peru for a documentary film, titled Keep the River on Your Right: A Modern Cannibal Tale. Later life Schneebaum spent the final years of his life in Westbeth Artists Community, an artists' commune in Greenwich Village, New York City, also home to Merce Cunningham and Diane Arbus, and died in 2005 in Great Neck, New York of Parkinson's Disease. He bequeathed his renowned Asmat shield collection to the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City and his personal papers are preserved within the Jean-Nickolaus Tretter Collection in Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual and Transgender Studies. Awards Schneebaum received a Master of Arts in anthropology at The New School in New York City, and another from Goddard College, Plainfield, Vermont.

Regulatory affairs professionals (aka regulatory professionals) usually have responsibility for the following general areas: * Ensuring that their companies comply with all of the regulations and laws pertaining to their business. * Working with federal, state, and local regulatory agencies and personnel on specific issues affecting their business, i.e., working with such agencies as the Food and Drug Administration or European Medicines Agency (pharmaceuticals and medical devices); The Department of Energy; or the Securities and Exchange Commission (banking). * Advising their companies on the regulatory aspects and climate that would affect proposed activities. i.e. describing the \\"regulatory climate\\" around issues such as the promotion of prescription drugs and Sarbanes-Oxley compliance.  Healthcare RA  The regulatory function in healthcare industries is vital in making safe and effective healthcare products available worldwide. Individuals who ensure regulatory compliance and prepare submissions, as well as those whose main job function is clinical affairs or quality assurance are all considered regulatory professionals. The most significant responsibility of a Regulatory professional in an export company is to get a product successfully registered and approved by the Health Agency of the country like FDA for USA or EMA for Europe. Regulatory professionals are employed in industry, government and academia and are involved with a wide range of products, including: * pharmaceuticals * medical devices * in vitro diagnostics * biologics and biotechnology * nutritional products * cosmetics * veterinary products The regulatory professional's roles and responsibilities often begin in the research and development phases, moving into clinical trials and extending through premarket approvals, manufacturing, labeling and advertising and postmarket surveillance.  Core competencies  Regulatory professionals come from diverse backgrounds. Most regulatory professionals have earned a bachelor's degree, and more than half have an advanced degree, most often in a scientific or technical field. In addition, regulatory professionals usually have experience in other careers before transitioning into regulatory affairs. Although there are some university degree and graduate certificate programs in regulatory affairs and related areas, experience is a key asset for regulatory professionals. Valuable skills include project management and organization, negotiation and communication, and the ability to learn from the experience of others, both inside and outside the organization. Continuing education and professional development are critical to the regulatory professional. Regulatory professionals must keep up to date with regulatory policies and procedures for one or more countries, as well as maintain an understanding of the scientific and technical background of healthcare products. Global aspects of regulatory affairs are taken up by organisations such as the Drug Information Association (DIA) and the International Conference on Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (ICH).  Origins  The healthcare industries were the first to be significantly regulated in the modern era. Much of this regulation has stemmed from avoiding the repetition of disasters, and has tended to be led by the USA due to size of the market and its technological lead:United States Food and Drug Administration * Diphtheria Epidemic led to 1902 Biologics Control Act * Publication of The Jungle by Upton Sinclair led to 1906 Pure Food and Drugs Act * Elixir of Sulfanilamide led to the 1938 Food Drug and Cosmetic Act * Thalidomide led to the 1962 Kefauver Harris Amendments * Dalkon Shield led to the 1976 Medical Device Amendments * Bjork-Shiley Heart Valves led to the 1990 Safe Medical Devices Act In the US, this regulation is largely written directly into law and codified in Title 21 of the Code of Federal RegulationsFDA Center for Devices and Radiological Health  Recent developments  Starting in 1980 the European Union started to harmonize the regulation of healthcare products in the member states.MeddiQuest Consultants Information Site The concept of regulating medicines was well established in most member countries along similar lines to the US model, but many countries did not have any significant medical device regulation. Concurrently the EU had been developing the concept of New Approach Directives where only broad concepts were written into the law and the bulk of the technological detail delegated to compliance with recognized standards (which are more readily update-able).Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (UK)Europa Medical Devices New Approach Organization The Europeans took the radical approach of applying the New Approach Directive to Medical Devices and by doing so made the first significant conceptual advance in healthcare regulation for nearly 100 years. The European Model for medical device has largely been adopted by the Global Harmonization Task Force as the international template.Global Harmonization Task Force  Future developments  Many in the Regulatory Affairs Profession believe the New Approach to regulation will eventually be adopted for all healthcare products as it represents the best model for delivering new healthcare advances to market in a reasonable time with acceptable safety. Regulatory Affairs departments are growing within companies. Due to the changing resources necessary to fulfill the regulatory requirements, some companies also choose to outsource or outtask regulatory affairs to external service providers. Regulatory Affairs department is constantly evolving and growing and is the one which is least impacted during the Acquisition and Merger, and also during recession. Global harmonization in standards has led to consistent approach in regulatory submissions and hence its review.  Regulatory affairs profession  The (healthcare) regulatory affairs profession is still an emergent profession but has four major international professional membership organizations: * Drug Information Association, DIA, http://www.diahome.org * The Regulatory Affairs Professionals Society, RAPS, http://www.raps.org * The Organisation for Professionals in Regulatory Affairs, TOPRA, http://www.topra.org * Vietnam Regulatory Affairs: https://vnras.com/ * Association of Regulatory Affairs Professionals: ARAP which offer education and training, professional development, competence certification and codes of ethics. The regulatory professional typically has a background relevant to the business in which they work, i.e., science, medicine, or engineering.

Dulcie is described as ‘ordinary-looking and unaccompanied’ and consequently no one takes any notice of her, even though some of them had ‘read and enjoyed her books’. Her fellow guests do not realise that they are being observed. Dulcie and Viola set about discovering more about his background, which entails a trip to his mother's guest house, which has a ‘bright Christian atmosphere’, in Taviscombe. Publication history No Fond Return of Love was Pym's sixth novel, published by Jonathan Cape in 1961. During the writing period, Pym noted that she wanted to write a novel about \\"the lives of ordinary people\\" . The novel did not receive much critical notice, although was reviewed positively in Tatler, where the reviewer wrote Holt 1990, p. 183: Pym's working title was A Thankless Task, in reference to the live of an indexer and assistant researcher Binding, Paul. 'Introduction', No Fond Return of Love (London: Virago, 2009), p.xii.. Pym shared the same profession as Viola and Dulcie, having worked at the International African Institute in London since 1946. The publishers felt the title was too negative, and so Pym chose the final title from a poem by eighteenth-century poet Frances Greville (which she altered from \\"no kind return of love\\") Holt 1990, p. 183. The novel was first published in the United States by E. P. Dutton in 1982. No Fond Return of Love was released as an audiobook in the 1980s by Chivers Press read by Angela Pleasence and again in 2010 read by Maggie Mash. The novel was published in Spain as Amor no correspondido, and in Italy in 1991 as Per guarire un cuore infranto (To heal a broken heart) and again in 2014 as Amori non molto corrisposti (Unrequited love) Connections with other novels Pym's novels usually feature reappearances from characters from her previous novels. Here, the characters of Wilmet and Rodney Forysth, Piers Longridge and his partner Keith, from A Glass of Blessings appear as tourists visiting the castle. Deirdre Swan and Digby Fox, from Less than Angels, also appear briefly. For the first time, Pym inserts herself as a cameo appearance. When Dulcie visits a guest house, she notes one of the novels for guests to read is Some Tame Gazelle, Pym's first published novel. The author would insert herself for a second time in An Unsuitable Attachment. Adaptations The novel was serialised on the BBC radio programme Woman's Hour in 1965 .

Kennedy, A Concise History of the Netherlands (Cambridge UP, 2017) Although the first socialist party, the Social Democratic League, was founded in the 19th century, the electoral system, combined with a policy of containment and repression, prevented the development of the socialist movement. In the 1901 election, the Social Democratic Workers' Party increased its representation from two to six seats in the lower house of parliament, to the great unease of the confessional and liberal elite. This unease became even greater during the railway strike of 1903, which disrupted the functioning of Dutch society. The railway strike was followed by a general strike in protest at the harsh treatment of the railway workers by the confessional government. In contrast to Germany, the majority of Dutch socialists did not complain about imperialism and the East Indies.Erik Hansen, \\"Marxists and Imperialism: The Indonesian Policy of the Dutch Social Democratic Workers Party, 1894-1914.\\" Indonesia 16 (1973): 81-104. online After the 1913 elections, in which the social democrats doubled their number of seats (from 7 to 15), the Liberal Union tried to form a coalition government with the social democrats but the social democrats refused to cooperate with what they perceived as bourgeois (or \\"middle class\\") parties. World War I Although its army mobilised when World War I broke out in August 1914, the Netherlands remained a neutral country. The German invasion of Belgium led to a large flow of refugees from that country (about 1 million). The German Imperial Army however did march through a small part of Dutch territory during the invasion of Belgium, effectively 'taking a shortcut'. The government accepted this to maintain the neutrality of the Netherlands.Kennedy, A Concise History of the Netherlands (2017) The country being surrounded by states at war, and with the North Sea unsafe for civilian ships to sail on, food became scarce; food was now distributed using coupons. An error in food distribution caused the so-called Aardappeloproer (Potato-rebellion) in Amsterdam in 1917, when civilians plundered a food transport intended for soldiers. Interwar  Dutch society became divided among three large ideologies, Protestantism, Roman Catholicism and Socialism, who tried to protect their populations with a system called verzuiling or Pillarization. The small minority of Liberals, though insisting that their \\"general\\" organisations were open to all, effectively consisted a fourth pillar that held power through financial, rather than social, strength.Kennedy, A Concise History of the Netherlands (2017) Although both houses of the Dutch parliament were elected by the people, only men with high incomes were eligible for voting. This situation lasted until 1918, when pressure from socialist movements had resulted in elections in which all men were allowed to vote. From 1922 onward, women could vote as well. The worldwide Great Depression of 1929 and the early 1930s had crippling effects on the Dutch economy, effects which lasted longer than they did in most European countries. The long duration of the Great Depression in the Netherlands is often explained by the very strict fiscal policy of the Dutch government at the time, and its decision to adhere to the Gold Standard much longer than most of its trading partners. The depression led to large unemployment and poverty, as well as increasing social unrest. Riots in a working-class neighbourhood in Amsterdam were put down with army assistance, with fatal consequences (for more details: Great Depression in the Netherlands).E.H. Kossmann, The Low Countries 1780-1940 (1978). The rise of Nazism in Germany did not go unnoticed in the Netherlands, and there was growing concern over the possibility of armed conflict. However, some say the threat of Nazi aggression was not fully acknowledged by the government of the time. An often mentioned example is a particular statement by prime minister Hendrik Colijn at the end of his radio speech on the occupation of the Rhineland. He stressed that citizens could sleep safely, because there was no reason for concern.E.H. Kossmann, The Low Countries 1780-1940 (1978). World War II At the outbreak of World War II in 1939, the Netherlands declared their neutrality again. However, on May 10, 1940, Nazi Germany launched an attack on the Netherlands and Belgium and overran most of the country quickly, fighting against a poorly equipped Dutch army.Kennedy, A Concise History of the Netherlands (2017) By May 14, fighting was only occurring in a few isolated areas, including Rotterdam. That same day, at 10:35am, Nazi Germany demanded, in an ill-formatted ultimatum -- it was signed simply \\"the commanding officer of the troops at Rotterdam\\", without giving the exact identity of the sender -- that the Netherlands surrender the city within two hours, to which the commander in chief, General Henri Winkelman, replied through the garrison commander at 12:15 that only a correctly signed ultimatum would be considered. Around 13:30 a new ultimatum was handed out to a Dutch officer, and a reply was expected before 16:30. However, at the same time the bombardment of Rotterdam began, killing about 800 people and destroying large parts of the city, leaving 78,000 homeless. Following the bombardment and German threats of the same for Utrecht, general Winkelman capitulated. However, the capitulation affected only the Royal Netherlands Army -- not the Royal Netherlands Navy, the air force or the Netherlands East Indies Army, in the Dutch East Indies. In this way, the Netherlands did not cease to exist, which proved of vital importance for the governing of the overseas territories and for keeping the Navy active against Germany. The government, the queen and some military forces fled to Britain, while other members of the royal family fled to Canada. Nazi Germany's civil administration of the Netherlands was headed by Arthur Seyss-Inquart. Persecution of the Jews, of which about 140,000 lived in the Netherlands at the start of the war, including some 20,000 refugees, started immediately after the invasion. In 1942, a transit camp was erected near Westerbork. Concentration camps were built near Vught and Amersfoort. At the end of the war, only about 20,000 of the 140,000 Dutch Jews remained alive. Anne Frank, who later gained worldwide fame when her diary, written in the Achterhuis, while hiding from the Nazis, was found and published, died shortly before the liberation of her camp on May 5, 1945. Following the refusal of the Netherlands government-in-exile to allow the sale of oil from the Dutch East Indies to Japan, Japanese forces invaded Dutch territory on January 11, 1942. The Dutch surrendered on March 8, after Japanese troops landed on Java. Dutch citizens were captured and put to work in labour camps. However, many Dutch ships and military personnel managed to reach Australia, from where they were able to fight against the Japanese. In Europe, after the Allies landed in Normandy in June 1944, they proceeded quickly towards the Dutch border. On September 5 most of the Dutch thought the liberation would be very soon; the day is known as Dolle Dinsdag (Mad Tuesday). On September 17 a daring operation, Operation Market Garden, was staged to make a quick incursion into the southern Netherlands and capture bridges across the three main rivers. The bridge at Arnhem, across the Rhine, could however not be captured. The part south of the rivers was liberated in the period September - November 1944. However, for most of the country people would have to wait until May 1945. The winter of 1944-1945 was very harsh, and many Dutch starved, giving the winter the name Hongerwinter (Hunger winter) Dutch famine of 1944–45. Following Allied victories in Nazi Germany and Adolf Hitler's suicide on April 30, 1945, Canadian General Foulkes accepted the surrender of the German troops in the Netherlands at Wageningen on May 5, 1945. Post-war years=Indonesia Allied forces liberated parts of the Dutch East Indies in mid-1945. However the Japanese-installed local leadership declared independence as Indonesia, and controlled the main islands. A confusing phase followed. Its massive oil reserves provided about 14 percent of the prewar Dutch national product and supported a large population of ethnic Dutch government officials and businessmen in Jakarta and other major cities. In 1945, the Netherlands could not regain these islands on its own; had to depend on British military action and American financial grants. By the time Dutch soldiers returned, an independent government under Sukarno, was in power. The Dutch in the East Indies, and at home, were practically unanimous (except for the Communists) that Dutch power and prestige and wealth depended on an extremely expensive war to regain the islands. Compromises were negotiated, were trusted by neither side. When the Indonesian Republic successfully suppressed a large-scale communist revolt, the United States realized that it needed the nationalist government as an ally in the Cold War. Dutch possession was an obstacle to American Cold War goals, so Washington forced the Dutch to grant full independence. A few years later, Sukarno seized all Dutch properties and expelled all ethnic Dutch—over 300,000—as well as several hundred thousand ethnic Indonesians who supported the Dutch cause. In the aftermath, the Netherlands prospered greatly in the 1950s and 1960s but nevertheless public opinion was bitterly hostile to the United States for betrayal. Washington remained baffled why the Dutch were so inexplicably enamored of an obviously hopeless cause. Western New Guinea remained Dutch (until 1961).Henri Baudet, \\"The Netherlands after the Loss of Empire\\" Journal of Contemporary History 4#1 (1969), pp. 127- 139 online Prosperity Although it was originally expected that the loss of the Indies would lead to an economic downfall, the reverse proved to be true, and in the 1950s and 1960s the Dutch economy experienced a near unprecedented growth - see the post–World War II boom. In fact, the demand for labor was so strong, that immigration was actively encouraged, first from Italy and Spain; then later on, in larger numbers, from Turkey and Morocco. Combined with the immigration from (former) colonies like Indonesia, Surinam and Netherlands Antilles, this meant that the Netherlands was becoming a multicultural country. The late 1960s and 1970s were the period of the Dutch disease, which means that easy gains from natural gas exports crowded out manufacturing exports and employment. In the 1960s and 1970s there were great social and cultural changes, such as rapid depillarization a process that involved the gradual decay of the old divisions along class and religious lines (which had led to things like separate education and separate television broadcasts for Catholics, Protestants, socialists and liberals). Youths, and students in particular, rejected the traditional morals and pushed for social change in matters like women's rights, sexuality and environmental issues. Today, the Netherlands is regarded as a very liberal country, considering its drugs policy and its legalisation of euthanasia. Same-sex marriage became permitted on April 1, 2001. At that time, the Netherlands was the only country where gay marriages were not only allowed, but also considered fully equivalent to heterosexual ones. In 1952, the Netherlands was among the founders of the European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC) (together with France, West Germany, Italy, Belgium and Luxembourg). The ECSC would over time evolve into the European Union. A modern, industrialised nation, the Netherlands is also a large exporter of agricultural products. The country was a founding member of NATO and participated in the introduction of the euro in 1999. From 1918 to 1967 Dutch politics were dominated by the Christian Democrat parties, which were members of every government, sometimes in coalition with the liberal party, sometimes with the social democrats. This changed in 1994, when social- democrats and liberals formed the so-called \\"Purple Cabinet\\", which governed until 2002. 21st century Since 2002, the Dutch governments has mostly been led by Christian-democrats and liberals interchangeably. On May 6, 2002, the murder of Pim Fortuyn, a right-wing populist calling for a very strict policy on immigration, shocked the country. His party became a major political force after the elections, significantly changing the political landscape. However, lack of leadership and fighting within the party caused them to lose much of their following in elections the next year. Another political murder took place on November 2, 2004, when film director and publicist Theo van Gogh was assassinated by a Dutch-Moroccan Islamic extremist. This sparked debate about Islamic extremism in the Netherlands, and on immigration and integration (or lack thereof) as well. In 2017, the government consists of the People's Party for Freedom and Democracy (VVD), The Christian Democratic Appeal (CDA), Democrats 66 (D66) and The Christian Union (CU).

The smaller Lake Neale is adjacent to the northwest. It is part of (or a surface feature of) the Amadeus Basin that was filled with the erosion products of the Petermann Orogeny. Physical features Due to the aridity of the area, the surface of Lake Amadeus is usually a dry salt crust. In times of sufficient rainfall, it is part of an east-flowing drainage system that eventually connects to the Finke River. Lake Amadeus is long and wide, making it the largest salt lake in the Northern Territory. Lake Amadeus contains up to 600 million tonnes of salt; however, harvesting it has not proved viable, owing to its remote location. History Lake Amadeus is on Aboriginal land, and is covered by the Katiti and Petermann Aboriginal Land Trusts. The first European to arrive at the lake, the explorer Ernest Giles, encountered it in 1872. Giles originally intended to honour his benefactor Baron Ferdinand von Mueller with the eponym Lake Ferdinand. However, Mueller prevailed upon Giles to instead honour King Amadeo I of Spain (reigned 1870–1873, known in English as King Amadeus I), who had previously bestowed honour on him. The lake's expanse proved a barrier for Giles, who could see both the as yet undiscovered Uluru and Kata Tjuta but could not reach them as the dry lake bed was not able to support the weight of his horses. The next year, William Gosse climbed and named both rises. Mythology Legend describes how pantu was created by wanampi (water snake).

Its popularity saw it released over the following years for the Commodore 64, Acorn Electron, MSX, Tatung Einstein, Amstrad CPC and Atari 8-bit family. It was later updated for the Amiga, Atari ST, and IBM PC compatibles. The game was written by Nigel Alderton, then 16 or 17 years old. After a month or two of development, Nigel took a pre-release version of his Spectrum code to the two-year-old software company A&F;, co-founded by Doug Anderson and Mike Fitzgerald (the \\"A\\" and \\"F\\", respectively). Doug took on the simultaneous development of the BBC Micro version, whilst Mike Webb, an A&F; employee, completed the Dragon port. Chuckie Egg went on to sell over a million copies and remained a steady earner for A&F; before the company went into administration in the late 1980s. The versions fall broadly into two groups: those with realistic physics (e.g., BBC Micro and Amstrad CPC) and those without (e.g., ZX Spectrum). Although there is a substantial difference in play between the two, levels remain largely the same and all the 8-bit versions have been cited as classics.Your Sinclair magazine: January 1992, Issue 73Retro Gamer Issue Thirty Seven, May 2007Edge presents: Retro \\"The making of ...\\" special - Chuckie Egg (February 2003) Gameplay As Hen-House Harry, the player must collect the twelve eggs positioned in each level, before a countdown timer reaches zero. In addition there are piles of seed which may be collected to increase points and stop the countdown timer for a while, but will otherwise be eaten by hens that patrol the level, causing them to pause. If the player touches a hen or falls through a gap in the bottom of the level, he loses a life. Each level is made of solid platforms, ladders and occasionally lift platforms that constantly move upwards but upon leaving the top of the screen will reappear at the bottom. Hitting the top of the screen while on one of these lifts, however, will also cause the player to lose a life. Eight levels are defined and are played initially under the watch of a giant caged duck. Upon completion of all eight the levels are played again without hens, but Harry is now pursued by the freed duck flying around the screen and homing in on him. A second completion of all eight levels yields a third play through with both hens and the duck. A fourth pass introduces additional hens. Finally, a fifth pass has the duck and additional hens moving at a greater speed. If the player completes all forty levels then they advance to 'level 41' which is in fact exactly the same as level 33. The player starts with five lives, and an extra life is awarded every 10,000 points. Reception The ZX Spectrum version was rated number 13 in the Your Sinclair Official Top 100 Games of All Time.  Legacy  There was an official, apparently A&F; approved Chuckie Egg upgrade on the BBC and Electron machines called Chukee. This was published by a small company called Bit Twiddlers and gave the player the ability to start at any level. It also introduced an \\"Extended Jump\\" feature (instituted by holding down the up key whilst jumping). This was one of the earliest available 'hacks' for any 8-bit computer. In 2009, the Organ Grinder's Monkey produced an unofficial upgrade to the original Chuckie Egg for the BBC and Electron which includes a full level editor and a set of eight new levels. Chuckie Egg was also followed up, two years after its first release, with a sequel entitled Chuckie Egg 2. Available on a much smaller subset of platforms, this release changed genre quite radically and involved the player, as Harry again, working through a factory attempting to create Easter eggs complete with toy, in a Jet Set Willy-style adventure. Whilst the first game had each level on one single screen, the new version had levels covering multiple screens. Although the sequel has gained a small number of admirers, it never received the same attention as the original. In 2017, the remake Super Chuckie Egg was released for mobile devices.

In 1925, on the advice of Ildebrando Pizzetti, he went to Milan, where he worked as a teacher, music critic and an arranger of vocal scores for Casa Ricordihttp://www.naxos.com/person/Mario_Pilati/19227.htm until 1930, when he moved back to Naples to take up a professorship at the conservatory where he had been a student. In 1933 he accepted a post at the conservatory in Palermo, returning to Naples in 1938, where he became ill and died just before the outbreak of World War II. Works Pilati's output is considerable given his few years of compositional maturity, and includes a Concerto for Orchestra (1932), premiered by Dmitri Mitropoulos at the Venice Biennale in 1938, which shows modal influences of Respighi as well as a Mahlerian ländler in the finale. Other compositions include a Suite for Strings and Piano of 1925 and several chamber works. At his death he was working on an opera, , to a libretto in Neapolitan dialect. Only the first act was completed. His work continued to be popular for some time after his death, but gradually waned until its rediscovery in the 1950s, when his long-lost was published for the first time.

He played for the Eagles for six seasons from 2003 to 2008 and the Minnesota Vikings for two seasons from 2009 to 2010. Lewis has served as assistant coach for the University of San Diego, San Jose State, Pittsburgh Panthers, Philadelphia Eagles, and Kansas City Chiefs. Early years Lewis attended Rich South High School in Richton Park, Illinois, which retired his No. 8 jersey in 2004. College career Lewis went to the University of Illinois, joining the football team as a walk-on. Professional career=Philadelphia Eagles After going undrafted in the 2003 NFL Draft, Lewis signed with the Philadelphia Eagles as an undrafted free agent. Limited to mostly special teams his rookie season, Lewis worked his way into the receivers rotation his second year, helping the Eagles reach Super Bowl XXXIX. He caught a 30-yard touchdown in the fourth quarter to bring the Eagles within 3, but the Eagles would go on to lose the game. Lewis spent six seasons with the Eagles, playing in 99 games with 24 starts between the regular season and playoffs, while recording 136 receptions for 1,879 yards and eight touchdowns. New England Patriots Lewis was acquired via trade along with a 2010 7th-round draft pick by the New England Patriots in exchange for a 2009 5th-round draft pick on March 5, 2009.

This reunited him with Vikings coach Brad Childress, who previously served as offensive coordinator for the Eagles. On September 27, 2009, Lewis caught a contested 32-yard touchdown pass from quarterback Brett Favre while falling out of the back of the end zone with two seconds remaining to give the Vikings a dramatic come-from-behind 27-24 victory over the San Francisco 49ers. It was Lewis' first catch with the team and the game marked his debut as a Viking (he was inactive for the previous two games). He received an ESPY Award for Best Play along with Favre.

The pulwar or pulouar is a single-handed curved sword originating in Afghanistan. Origin The pulwar originated alongside other scimitar-type weapons such as the Arab saif, the Persian shamshir, the Turkish kilij, and the Indian talwar, all of them ultimately based on earlier Central Asian swords. Originally, the Khyber Knife (a type of short sword) served as the weapon of the common people while upper-classes could afford to import swords from neighbouring Persia and India. Over time, the Afghans combined characteristics of the imported swords and adapted it to create the pulwar. Most existing pulwars date back to the early 19th century. Characteristics Afghan police ca. 1880, a man near the centre of the group holds a scabbarded pulwar upright; to his left another man holds a Persian shamshir across his lap. Borrowing features from the swords of neighboring lands, the pulwar may be described as an Afghan version of the Indian talwar. Pulwar blades tend to be more elaborately fullered than those of the talwar. Some pulwar hilts were fitted to Persian blades which are slimmer and more curved and tapered towards the tip than the more typically robust pulwar blades. The hilt is characterized by two quillons which are short and turned to point in the direction of the blade in the manner of some shamshir and saif, a feature typical of swords produced in Qajar period Iran. Like the tulwar, the hilt is made of iron, and is attached to the tang of the blade by a very strong adhesive resin. Unlike the flat disc surrounding the pommel of the tulwar, the pommel of pulwar exhibits a cup-shape.Evangelista and Gaugler, p. 483. Both hilt and blade can be ornately engraved with inscriptions, designs, and images.

For the 2013 video game, see Citadels (video game). Citadel is a computer game developed for the BBC Micro and released by Superior Software in 1985. It was also ported to the Acorn Electron. A platform game with some puzzle solving elements. Michael Jakobsen’s puzzle-platformer, centred around a castle, requires players to find five hidden crystals and return them to their rightful place. Outside of the castle there are outside areas (including a wasteland, a pyramid, a sea and an island). Upon returning the crystals, the player must teleport to a separate set of locations to complete the game. Once the game is completed, the player is left free to roam the castle in order to achieve the maximum possible score if they have not done so already. The only way to see the final congratulatory message is to reach 99 points. Citadel was unusual at the time for playing synthesized speech before loading the main game (in part to advertise Superior Software's \\"Speech!\\" programme package), as well as having other special effects advanced for the time, such as splashing water sounds. Many BBC Micro gamers regard Citadel as a seminal game and it has spawned social media appreciation pages.  Gameplay  In game (Acorn Electron) Citadel has a number of distinctive features. Unlike many other platform games, the player is not automatically killed if they come into contact with fireballs, snakes or other hazards; instead the player is allocated a set amount of energy, measured by a number, which is depleted through contact, which can be replenished by collecting objects shaped like bottles. If the player continuously loses too much energy in a room, the screen turns red and the player is transported back to where they entered the room. This prevents players from passing through a room simply by walking through enemies and taking the damage. The game also allows the player to choose the sex of their character and uses a different sprite accordingly - quite unusual in the days when in-game memory was at a premium (although the chosen gender of the sprite does not affect gameplay). The player sprite is not superimposed over objects that it walks \\"in front\\" of; rather, the colour of the pixels of the character sprite is overlaid, using an XOR bitwise operation, with the colour of the superimposed object, resulting in a completely different colour. For instance, the male player sprite normally has pink hair and yellow skin, but has yellow hair and pink skin when placed in front of the cyan stones of the Stonehenge screen. This effect is quite distinctive (it was also used in the two \\"sequels\\"). Most enemies cannot be destroyed, only avoided. The exceptions to this are the 'monks' which can be destroyed by jumping and firing a projectile-like 'spell' into their face. Each spell expends one unit of energy, which is restored if the player is successful in killing the monk. If a player returns to a room where they had previously destroyed a monk, the monk reappears and must be killed again, often employing a different technique if the room was entered by a different way. In addition to the crystals, various other items are located throughout the 100 different rooms of the castle which can be collected and used to solve puzzles in order to obtain the crystals. These include coloured keys which open doors of the same colour, giving access to other areas of the game; an 'ice crystal' which, whilst carried, causes water in its vicinity to freeze, enabling access to previously inaccessible areas; trampolines which can be jumped on to reach high areas ordinarily out of reach, and many others. The player is limited to carrying two items at any one time and a certain combination of objects in their inventory is often needed to solve particular problems. For example, one crystal is located in a room behind a brick wall. Access is obtained by finding a cannonball and sack of gunpowder and then walking past a cannon. These items are then automatically 'loaded' into the cannon which fires, blasting a hole in the brick wall giving access to the crystal behind. Most of the items scattered throughout the game are needed to complete it, with the exception of the barrel (which can be used as a platform to jump to a higher area, although the same effect can be achieved with the trampoline), and the metal bars, which can be taken to the Stonehenge screen to be converted into energy, but add no points to the player's score. The numbers below the name of the screen (\\"The Prison\\" in this case) indicate the number of units of energy left, the player's score, and two coordinates indicating the location of the screen. The letter next to the key which is being carried in the inventory was used by players who only had access to a monochrome monitor.  Ports  In order to port the BBC Micro game to the Electron, which had more limited memory constraints, apparently random multicoloured top and bottom borders had to be left on screen. This was actually machine code that was left on-screen as 'decoration' rather than use more memory to hide it. Reception and legacy Citadel received a great deal of acclaim at the time of its release, and remains one of the classic BBC Micro games. The game Palace of Magic, released in 1987, used extremely similar gameplay principles, and was in a way a de facto sequel. Although subsequent games from Superior, such as Quest, Camelot, Ricochet and Baron, used many of the same elements — though without achieving the same cult status — an official sequel to the game was not released until 1993 when Superior decided to release The Fort, yet another such game, as Citadel 2. However, by this time the BBC Micro was declining in popularity — Citadel 2, written by \\"Symo\\" (Simon Storr) was one of the last BBC Micro games released — and the sequel is little known. As with most Superior Software games during this period, there was a prize associated with Citadel. The winner was the first person to find three crowns which were hidden around the game map. It is possible for the player to complete the game without picking up the crowns, although the player cannot see the final congratulatory message if they are not collected. Reconstructed source code obtained by disassembling the BBC Model B version of the game was released in October 2018.

He is purple with shaggy black hair that stands on end. His name is a word play on the name of the late U.S. President Franklin Roosevelt, but the first and last names are reversed. Sesame Street cast member Matt Robinson, who also played Gordon on the series for the first three seasons (1969–1972), created the character and provided his voice. Franklin is an intelligent boy who often speaks in rhyme or scat. Franklin began to appear more rarely in episodes created after the mid-1970s until he no longer was on the series. Robert W. Morrow, author of \\"Sesame Street\\" and the Reform of Children's Television, wrote that \\"Franklin's sudden arrival may have been in response to early criticism of the show as too white.\\" Roosevelt Franklin usually appears in scenes with his mother, voiced by Loretta Long, who plays Susan on the series, and Roosevelt frequently recites poetry. Later scenes were set in a classroom at Roosevelt Franklin Elementary School, in which Roosevelt appears to fill in for an absent teacher while teaching lessons about up and down, high and low, loud and soft, here and there, good and bad luck, poison, Africa, rhyming words, trying and trying again, leaving other people's belongings alone, and street-crossing safety. Jane O'Connor, the sole African- American woman in early Sesame Street planning discussions, perceived Roosevelt Franklin to be causing white children to believe in a stereotypical view of African Americans. The character faded from the show because teachers were concerned that his rowdy behavior in class was setting a bad example for the pre-school audience. Franklin is featured on a 1971 record album titled The Year of Roosevelt Franklin, Gordon's Friend from Sesame Street, reissued in 1974 as My Name Is Roosevelt Franklin.Sesame Street - My Name Is Roosevelt Franklin (Full Album), YouTube ReferencesExternal links *Roosevelt Franklin as classroom teacher *Roosevelt Franklin chosen as the Most Underrated Muppet *9 Muppets Kicked Off Sesame Street Franklin, Roosevelt Category:Television characters introduced in 1970 Category:Fictional African- American people ","title":"Roosevelt Franklin"},{"id":"1486231","text":"In Unix-like and some other operating systems, \`find\` is a command-line utility that locates files based on some user-specified criteria and then applies some requested action on each matched object. It initiates a search from a desired starting location and then recursively traversing the nodes (directories) of a hierarchical structure (typically a tree). find can traverse and search through different file systems of partitions belonging to one or more storage devices mounted under the starting directory. The possible search criteria include a pattern to match against the filename or a time range to match against the modification time or access time of the file. By default, \`find\` returns a list of all files below the current working directory, although users can limit the search to any desired maximum number of levels under the starting directory. The related \`locate\` programs use a database of indexed files obtained through \`find\` (updated at regular intervals, typically by \`cron\` job) to provide a faster method of searching the entire file system for files by name. History \`find\` appeared in Version 5 Unix as part of the Programmer's Workbench project, and was written by Dick Haight alongside cpio, which were designed to be used together. The GNU \`find\` implementation was originally written by Eric Decker. It was later enhanced by David MacKenzie, Jay Plett, and Tim Wood.Finding Files The command has also been ported to the IBM i operating system. Find syntax $ find [-H-L] path... [operand_expression...] The two options control how the \`find\` command should treat symbolic links. The default behaviour is never to follow symbolic links. The -L flag will cause the \`find\` command to follow symbolic links. The -H flag will only follow symbolic links while processing the command line arguments. These flags are specified in the POSIX standard for \`find\`. A common extension is the -P flag, for explicitly disabling symlink following. At least one path must precede the expression. \`find\` is capable of interpreting wildcards internally and commands must be quoted carefully in order to control shell globbing. Expression elements are separated by the command-line argument boundary, usually represented as whitespace in shell syntax. They are evaluated from left to right. They can contain logical elements such as AND (-and or -a) and OR (-or -o) as well as predicates (filters and actions). GNU \`find\` has a large number of additional features not specified by POSIX. Predicates Commonly-used primaries include: * -name pattern - tests whether the file name matches the shell-glob pattern given. * -type type - tests whether the file is a given type. Unix file types accepted include: ** b - block device (buffered); ** c - character device (unbuffered); ** d - directory; ** f - regular file; ** l - symbolic link; ** p - named pipe; ** s - socket; ** D - door. * -print - always returns true; prints the name of the current file plus a newline to the stdout. * -print0 - always returns true; prints the name of the current file plus a null character to the stdout. Not required by POSIX. * -exec program [argument ...] ; - always returns true; run a program with the fixed arguments given and the current path of the file. * -exec program [argument ...] {} + - always returns true; run a program with the fixed arguments given and as many paths as possible (up to the maximum command-line size, like xargs). For most implementations, additional occurrences of {} mean additional copies of the name given (feature not required by POSIX). * -ok program [argument ...] ; - like -exec, but returns true or false depending on whether the program returns 0. If the expression uses none of -print0, -print, -exec, or -ok, find defaults to performing -print if the conditions test as true. Operators Operators can be used to enhance the expressions of the find command. Operators are listed in order of decreasing precedence: * ( expr ) - forces precedence; * ! expr - true if expr is false; * expr1 expr2 (or expr1 -a expr2) - AND. expr2 is not evaluated if expr1 is false; * expr1 -o expr2 - OR. expr2 is not evaluated if expr1 is true. $ find . -name 'fileA_*' -o -name 'fileB_*' This command searches the current working directory tree for files whose names start with \\"fileA_\\" or \\"fileB_\\". We quote the so that the shell does not expand it. $ find . -name 'foo.cpp' '!' -path '.svn' This command searches the current working directory tree except the subdirectory tree \\".svn\\" for files whose name is \\"foo.cpp\\". We quote the \`!\` so that it's not interpreted by the shell as the history substitution character. POSIX protection from infinite output Real-world file systems often contain looped structures created through the use of hard or soft links. The POSIX standard requires that Examples=From the current working directory $ find . -name 'my*' This searches the current working directory tree for files whose names start with my. The single quotes avoid the shell expansion—without them the shell would replace my* with the list of files whose names begin with my in the current working directory. In newer versions of the program, the directory may be omitted, and it will imply the current working directory. Regular files only $ find . -name 'my*' -type f This limits the results of the above search to only regular files, therefore excluding directories, special files, symbolic links, etc. my* is enclosed in single quotes (apostrophes) as otherwise the shell would replace it with the list of files in the current working directory starting with my… Commands The previous examples created listings of results because, by default, \`find\` executes the \`-print\` action. (Note that early versions of the \`find\` command had no default action at all; therefore the resulting list of files would be discarded, to the bewilderment of users.) $ find . -name 'my*' -type f -ls This prints extended file information. Search all directories $ find / -name myfile -type f -print This searches every directory for a regular file whose name is myfile and prints it to the screen. It is generally not a good idea to look for files this way. This can take a considerable amount of time, so it is best to specify the directory more precisely. Some operating systems may mount dynamic file systems that are not congenial to \`find\`. More complex filenames including characters special to the shell may need to be enclosed in single quotes. Search all but one subdirectory tree $ find / -path excluded_path -prune -o -type f -name myfile -print This searches every directory except the subdirectory tree excluded_path (full path including the leading /) that is pruned by the \`-prune\` action, for a regular file whose name is myfile. Specify a directory $ find /home/weedly -name myfile -type f -print This searches the /home/weedly directory tree for regular files named myfile. You should always specify the directory to the deepest level you can remember. Search several directories $ find local /tmp -name mydir -type d -print This searches the local subdirectory tree of the current working directory and the /tmp directory tree for directories named mydir. Ignore errors If you're doing this as a user other than root, you might want to ignore permission denied (and any other) errors. Since errors are printed to stderr, they can be suppressed by redirecting the output to /dev/null. The following example shows how to do this in the bash shell: $ find / -name myfile -type f -print 2> /dev/null If you are a csh or tcsh user, you cannot redirect stderr without redirecting stdout as well. You can use sh to run the \`find\` command to get around this: $ sh -c \\"find / -name myfile -type f -print 2> /dev/null\\" An alternate method when using csh or tcsh is to pipe the output from stdout and stderr into a grep command. This example shows how to suppress lines that contain permission denied errors. $ find . -name myfile & grep -v 'Permission denied' Find any one of differently named files $ find . ( -name '*jsp' -o -name '*java' ) -type f -ls The \`-ls\` operator prints extended information, and the example finds any regular file whose name ends with either 'jsp' or 'java'. Note that the parentheses are required. In many shells the parentheses must be escaped with a backslash (\`\\\\(\` and \`\\\\)\`) to prevent them from being interpreted as special shell characters. The \`-ls\` operator is not available on all versions of \`find\`. Execute an action $ find /var/ftp/mp3 -name '*.mp3' -type f -exec chmod 644 {} \\\\; This command changes the permissions of all regular files whose names end with .mp3 in the directory tree /var/ftp/mp3. The action is carried out by specifying the statement \`-exec chmod 644 {} \\\\;\` in the command. For every regular file whose name ends in \`.mp3\`, the command \`chmod 644 {}\` is executed replacing \`{}\` with the name of the file. The semicolon (backslashed to avoid the shell interpreting it as a command separator) indicates the end of the command. Permission \`644\`, usually shown as \`rw-r-- r--\`, gives the file owner full permission to read and write the file, while other users have read-only access. In some shells, the \`{}\` must be quoted. The trailing \\"\\" is customarily quoted with a leading \\"\\", but could just as effectively be enclosed in single quotes. Note that the command itself should not be quoted; otherwise you get error messages like find: echo \\"mv ./3bfn rel071204\\": No such file or directory which means that \`find\` is trying to run a file called and failing. If you will be executing over many results, it is more efficient to use a variant of the exec primary that collects filenames up to and then executes COMMAND with a list of filenames. $ find . -exec COMMAND {} + This will ensure that filenames with whitespaces are passed to the executed without being split up by the shell. Delete files and directories The \`-delete\` action is a GNU extension, and using it turns on \`-depth\`. So, if you are testing a find command with \`-print\` instead of \`-delete\` in order to figure out what will happen before going for it, you need to use \`-depth -print\`. Delete empty files and print the names (note that \`-empty\` is a vendor unique extension from GNU \`find\` that may not be available in all \`find\` implementations): $ find . -empty -delete -print Delete empty regular files: $ find . -type f -empty -delete Delete empty directories: $ find . -type d -empty -delete Delete empty files named 'bad': $ find . -name bad -empty -delete Warning. — The \`-delete\` action should be used with conditions such as \`-empty\` or \`-name\`: $ find . -delete # this deletes all in . Search for a string This command will search all files from the /tmp directory tree for a string: $ find /tmp -type f -exec grep 'search string' /dev/null '{}' + The \`/dev/null\` argument is used to show the name of the file before the text that is found. Without it, only the text found is printed. GNU \`grep\` can be used on its own to perform this task: $ grep -r 'search string' /tmp Example of search for \\"LOG\\" in jsmith's home directory tree: $ find ~jsmith -exec grep LOG '{}' /dev/null \\\\; -print /home/jsmith/scripts/errpt.sh:cp $LOG $FIXEDLOGNAME /home/jsmith/scripts/errpt.sh:cat $LOG /home/jsmith/scripts/title:USER=$LOGNAME Example of search for the string \\"ERROR\\" in all XML files in the current working directory tree: $ find . -name \\"*.xml\\" -exec grep \\"ERROR\\" /dev/null '{}' + The double quotes (\\" \\") surrounding the search string and single quotes (' ') surrounding the braces are optional in this example, but needed to allow spaces and some other special characters in the string. Note with more complex text (notably in most popular shells descended from \`sh\` and \`csh\`) single quotes are often the easier choice, since double quotes do not prevent all special interpretation. Quoting filenames which have English contractions demonstrates how this can get rather complicated, since a string with an apostrophe in it is easier to protect with double quotes: $ find . -name \\"file-containing-can't\\" -exec grep \\"can't\\" '{}' \\\\; -print Search for all files owned by a user $ find . -user Search in case insensitive mode Note that \`-iname\` is not in the standard and may not be supported by all implementations. $ find . -iname 'MyFile*' If the \`-iname\` switch is not supported on your system then workaround techniques may be possible such as: $ find . -name '[mM][yY][fF][iI][lL][eE]*' This uses Perl to build the above command for you (though in general this kind of usage is dangerous, since special characters are not properly quoted before being fed into the standard input of \`sh\`): $ echo 'MyFile*'  perl -pe 's/([a-zA-Z])/[\\\\L\\\\1\\\\U\\\\1]/g;s/(.*)/find . -name \\\\1/'  sh Search files by size Searching files whose size is between 100 kilobytes and 500 kilobytes: $ find . -size +100k -a -size -500k Searching empty files: $ find . -size 0k Searching non-empty files: $ find . ! -size 0k Search files by name and size  $ find /usr/src ! ( -name '*,v' -o -name '.*,v' ) '{}' \\\\; -print This command will search the /usr/src directory tree. All files that are of the form '*,v' and '.*,v' are excluded. Important arguments to note are in the tooltip that is displayed on mouse- over. for file in \`find /opt ( -name error_log -o -name 'access_log' -o -name 'ssl_engine_log' -o -name 'rewrite_log' -o -name 'catalina.out' ) -size +300000k -a -size -5000000k\`; do cat /dev/null > $file done The units should be one of [bckw], 'b' means 512-byte blocks, 'c' means byte, 'k' means kilobytes and 'w' means 2-byte words. The size does not count indirect blocks, but it does count blocks in sparse files that are not actually allocated.

Found in all temperate to tropical oceans yet rarely seen, the oarfish family contains three species in two genera. One of these, the giant oarfish (Regalecus glesne), is the longest bony fish alive, growing up to in length. The common name oarfish is thought to be in reference either to their highly compressed and elongated bodies, or to the now discredited belief that the fish \\"row\\" themselves through the water with their pelvic fins. The family name Regalecidae is derived from the Latin regalis, meaning \\"royal\\". The occasional beachings of oarfish after storms, and their habit of lingering at the surface when sick or dying, make oarfish a probable source of many sea serpent tales. Although the larger species are considered game fish and are fished commercially to a minor extent, oarfish are rarely caught alive; their flesh is not well regarded for eating due to its gelatinous consistency. Davis, Josh L. Rare \\"Sea Monster\\" Washes Ashore In New Zealand. IFLScience Anatomy and morphology The dorsal fin originates from above the (relatively large) eyes and runs the entire length of the fish. Of the approximately 400 dorsal fin rays, the first 10 to 13 are elongated to varying degrees, forming a trailing crest embellished with reddish spots and flaps of skin at the ray tips. The pelvic fins are similarly elongated and adorned, reduced to one to five rays each. The pectoral fins are greatly reduced and situated low on the body. The anal fin is completely absent and the caudal fin may be reduced or absent, as well, with the body tapering to a fine point. All fins lack true spines. At least one account, from researchers in New Zealand, described the oarfish as giving off \\"electric shocks\\" when touched. Like other members of its order, the oarfish has a small yet highly protrusible oblique mouth with no visible teeth. The body is scaleless and the skin is covered with easily abraded, silvery guanine. In the streamer fish (Agrostichthys parkeri), the skin is clad with hard tubercles. All species lack gas bladders and the number of gill rakers is variable. Oarfish coloration is also variable; the flanks are commonly covered with irregular bluish to blackish streaks, black dots, and squiggles. These markings quickly fade following death. It is probable that these markings are bioluminiscent in the deep sea. Oarfish that washed ashore on a Bermuda beach in 1860: The fish was long and was originally described as a sea serpent.

BBC Earth NewsDouglas Quenqua. Oarfish Offer Chance to Study an Elusive Animal Long Thought a Monster. New York Times. 2 November 2013 specimens—and in weight. The streamer fish is known to reach 3 m (10 ft) in length, while the largest recorded specimen of Regalecus russelii measured 5.4 m (18 ft). Oarfish have the longest known length of any living species of bony fish. Range The oarfish is thought to inhabit the epipelagic to mesopelagic ocean layers, ranging from 200 meters (660 ft) to 1,000 meters (3,300 ft) and is rarely seen on the surface. A few have been found still barely alive, but usually if one floats to the surface, it dies. At the depths the oarfish live, there are few or no currents. As a result, they build little muscle mass and they cannot survive in shallower turbulent water. Distribution The members of the family are known to have a worldwide range. However, human encounters with live oarfish are rare, and distribution information is collated from records of oarfish caught or washed ashore. Ecology and life history Oarfish were first described in 1772. Rare encounters with divers and accidental catches have supplied what little is known of oarfish ethology (behavior) and ecology. Oarfish are solitary animals and may frequent significant depths up to . An oarfish measuring and was reported to have been caught in February 2003 using a fishing rod baited with squid at Skinningrove, United Kingdom. A photograph on display in bars, restaurants, guesthouses and markets around Laos and Thailand captioned \\"Queen of Nāgas seized by the American Army at Mekhong River, Laos Military Base, on June 27, 1973, with the length of \\" is, as far as the caption goes, a hoax. The photograph itself is real, however, and was taken by Dr. Leo Smith of the Field Museum, of an oarfish found in September 1996 by United States Navy SEAL trainees on the coast of Coronado, California, USA. Behavior In 2001, an oarfish was filmed alive in situ: the fish was spotted by a group of U.S. Navy personnel during the inspection of a buoy in the Bahamas. The oarfish was observed to propel itself by an amiiform mode of swimming; that is, rhythmically undulating the dorsal fin while keeping the body itself straight. Perhaps indicating a feeding posture, oarfish have been observed swimming in a vertical orientation, with their long axis perpendicular to the ocean surface. In this posture, the downstreaming light would silhouette the oarfishes' prey, making them easier to spot. In July 2008, scientists captured footage of the rare fish swimming in its natural habitat in the mesopelagic zone in the Gulf of Mexico. It is the first ever confirmed sighting of an oarfish at depth, as most specimens are discovered dying at the sea surface or washed ashore. The fish was estimated to be between in length. As part of the SERPENT Project, five observations of apparently healthy oarfish Regalecus glesne by remotely operated vehicles were reported from the northern Gulf of Mexico between 2008 and 2011 at depths within the epipelagic and mesopelagic zones. These observations include the deepest verified record of R. glesne (). From December 2009 to March 2010, unusual numbers of the slender oarfish Regalecus russelii (竜宮の使い “Ryūgū-No-Tsukai”,) known in Japanese folklore as the Messenger from the Sea God's Palace, appeared in the waters and on the beaches of Japan, the appearance of which is said to portend earthquakes. After the 2011 Fukushima earthquake and tsunami which killed over 20,000 people, many pointed to the oarfish from 2009–⁠2010 to build up this myth. In 2016, Animal Planet aired an episode of the television series River Monsters named \\"Deep Sea Demon\\" in which Jeremy Wade was filmed during an encounter with a live oarfish while diving. The oarfish at this location seemed to be using a buoy anchor chain as a guide to ascend to the surface. On his second diving attempt, he was able to film two live oarfish as they ascended relatively close to the surface. This is the only known footage of human interaction with a healthy oarfish in its own environment. Wade was even able to touch one of the oarfish with his hand. The oarfish were propelling themselves by an amiiform mode of swimming as noted by other sightings.http://animals.barcroft.tv/sea-serpent-river-monsters-jeremy-wade- rare-oar-fish In January 2019 two oarfish were found alive in the nets of fisherman on the Japanese island of Okinawa. Juvenile Regalecus glesne Feeding ecology Oarfish feed primarily on zooplankton, selectively straining tiny euphausiids, shrimp, and other crustaceans from the water. Small fish, jellyfish, and squid are also taken. Large open-ocean carnivores are all likely predators of oarfish. Life history The oceanodromous Regalecus glesne is recorded as spawning off Mexico from July to December; all species are presumed to not guard their eggs, and release brightly coloured, buoyant eggs, up to across, which are incorporated into the zooplankton. The eggs hatch after about three weeks into highly active larvae that feed on other zooplankton. The larvae have little resemblance to the adults, with long dorsal and pelvic fins and extensible mouths. Larvae and juveniles have been observed drifting just below the surface. In contrast, adult oarfish are rarely seen at the surface when not sick or injured. It is probable that the fishes go deeper as they mature.

To facilitate eye-contact and improve posture when facing an audience, lecterns may have adjustable height and slant. People generally use lecterns while standing. In pre-modern usage, the word lectern was used to refer specifically to the \\"reading desk or stand ... from which the Scripture lessons (lectiones) ... are chanted or read.\\"Lectern, Chambers's Cyclopaedia, Vol. VI W. and R. Chambers, 1864; pp. 71-72. One 1905 dictionary states that \\"the term is properly applied only to the class mentioned [church book stands] as independent of the pulpit.\\"D. C. Gilman, H. T. Peck and F. M. Colby (eds), Lectern, The New International Cyclopaedia, Vol. XII, Dodd, Mead and Co., 1905; p. 68. By the 1920s, however, the term was being used in a broader sense, for example, in reference to a memorial service in Carnegie Hall, it was stated that \\"the lectern from which the speakers talked was enveloped in black.\\"Domestic News: New York, The Reform Advocate, Vol LV, No. 7, September 18, 1920; p. 181.  Use = Academic context  Lecterns used in academia—generally in seminar rooms and lecture theatres—may have certain features that common lecterns lack, based on the technological sophistication of the venue. These features usually include a microphone stand, audio-visual controls, sometimes even an integrated computer and recording system. Lecterns of this sort are generally attached or integrated into a large desk, as the amount of support material tends to be larger in academic contexts than in straightforward public talks.  Religious context  Eagle lectern in the choir hall of Aachen cathedral with a bat cast in 1874 in Stolberg. The bat on the eagle's back serves to stabilize the damaged lectern. = Christian = In the Christian Church, the lectern is usually the stand on which the Bible rests and from which the \\"lessons\\" (reading from Scripture) are read during the service. The lessons may be read or chanted by a priest, deacon, minister, or layperson, depending upon the liturgical traditions of the community. The lectern is normally set in front of the pews, so that the reader or speaker faces the congregation. Lecterns are often made of wood. They may be either fixed in place or portable. A lectern differs from a pulpit, the latter being used for sermons. Churches that have both a lectern and a pulpit will often place them on opposite sides. The lectern will generally be smaller than the pulpit, and both may be adorned with antipendia in the color of the liturgical season. In monastic churches and cathedrals, a separate lectern is commonly set in the centre of the choir. Originally this would have carried the antiphonal book, for use by the cantor or precentor leading the singing of the divine office. Lecterns often take the form of eagle lecterns to symbolise John the Apostle.How to read a church, Richard Taylor, London 2003, George Ferguson, Signs and Symbols in Christian Art, New York 1966 Especially in North America and Great Britain lecterns are sometimes made as 'angel lecterns'. = Jewish = Because the Torah scrolls are generally large, the central feature of the bimah in a synagogue is a table large enough to hold an open Torah along with a tikkun or Chumash (reference books used to check the reading). In some synagogues, this table may resemble a large lectern. The Hebrew term for this article of furniture is amud () \\"Jewish English Lexicon\\". In traditional yeshivas and some synagogues, students and members of the congregation may use small desks called shtenders (). These closely resemble conventional lecterns, and indeed, one shtender may be used as a lectern by the Hazzan leading the service. Note however that each study group in a yeshivah may have its own shtender and in some older synagogues, individual members of the congregation may have their own shtenders.Samuel C. Heilman, The People of the Book, University of Chicago Press, 1983, Transaction Publishers, 2009; see Chapter 1, page 3.Hanoch Teller, Sunset, Feldheim Publishers, 1987; page 169. Traditional shtenders frequently incorporate a locker under the desktop where prayerbooks and study material may be locked when not in use, and many feature a footrest for comfort during extended study sessions or standing prayers. Some older synagogues have large collections of shtenders.

The collision resulted in eleven deaths and 45 people injured, and led to improvements in signage around automatic level crossings. Background In the 1950s, British Railways found that the cost of manning some 2,400 level crossings had risen past £1 million per annum, with some locations seeing a tenfold increase. In the postwar labour market it was often difficult to recruit crossing keepers, the job itself being a responsible but rather dull occupation. In addition, manually operated crossings often caused long delays to road traffic because of the need to close the gates and clear the distant signal before the approaching train reached it. In October 1956, senior members of Her Majesty's Railway Inspectorate (HMRI) embarked on a fact-finding trip to the Netherlands, Belgium and France, to investigate the practice of automating level crossings. Their subsequent report recommended the introduction of automatically operated crossings with half-barriers, known as AHBs. This was projected to give considerable cost savings through the withdrawal of crossing keepers and would also speed up the flow of road traffic; the crossing being closed for less than a minute as opposed to 3 or 4 minutes at manned crossings. Safety requirements were drawn up in 1957, but it was not until 1961 that the first automatic crossing in Britain was installed at Spath, near Uttoxeter. The crossing was designed to give a minimum of 24 seconds warning for the fastest train on that line. By January 1968 there were 207 automatic crossings in Britain including the one at Hixon, which had been converted to automatic half-barrier operation in July 1967. Incidentally, Hixon was only eight miles from the pioneering installation at Spath. Low-loader movements On 6 January 1968, a 120-ton electrical transformer was to be moved from the English Electric works at Stafford to a storage depot at the disused RAF Hixon airfield. The airfield was on Station Road, adjacent to the Manchester branch of the West Coast Main Line and approximately three miles north of Colwich Junction. To carry out this move a huge transporter vehicle, long and with a 32-wheeled trailer, was chartered. It had a gross weight of 162 tons, was impelled by a tractor unit at each end, and had a crew of five. In charge of the vehicle was B. H. Groves, who occupied the leading cab. The journey was not an unusual procedure as six other abnormal loads belonging to the English Electric Company had passed over the automatic crossing in the preceding months. The transporter and its police escort left Stafford at approximately 09:30 on the morning of Saturday 6 January. Although Hixon was only six miles from Stafford, the nature of the load meant that it needed to travel south out of the town and then along a somewhat laborious route north via the M6 motorway, the A34 to Stone and finally the A51 to Hixon. This route had been approved by the Ministry of Transport, but the map of the route made no mention of the level crossing at Hixon; the description of the route in the Order merely ended with \\"Weston to junc class III road approx past Hixon turn left class III road turn left access road to English Electric Works and destination\\". J. H. Preston, Chief of Heavy Transport at English Electric, had mentioned the level crossing to Groves – but only as a landmark. At around 12:20 the transporter turned off the A51 into Station Road and slowed to walking pace as it approached the crossing. It stopped for a moment while the police car went over the crossing to check where the entrance to the airfield was; on its return, one of the police officers told Groves that \\"this is the place\\" and proceeded back over the level crossing. The trailer needed to be raised by the crew to negotiate the track, but, in addition, it needed to be low enough to clear the overhead lines. While this was taking place the transporter slowed to around . At this speed, it would take approximately one minute to traverse the crossing. Accident Class AL1 locomotive similar to the one involved in the accident, 1979 At 12:26, the leading tractor had traversed the two railway tracks and the main bulk of the transporter was astride them when the 11:30 express train from Manchester to London Euston activated the crossing sequence by operating a treadle away. The warning lights began to flash and the bells began to ring, with the barrier descending onto the forward part of the transformer. At about the same time Groves, who had not heard the bells and could not see the lights, saw the train approaching from his left and, realising that it would not stop, shouted a warning to his crew. He then accelerated and so did the driver of the tractor at the rear, A. L. Illsley, although this meant that Illsley was deliberately bringing himself into the direct path of the train. As a result of these actions, the train hit only the rear seven or eight feet of the transformer at approximately , sheared through the trailer and threw the transformer forward and to the left of the line. The train consisted of a Class AL1 electric locomotive No. E3009 and twelve coaches. The locomotive and the first five coaches of the train were destroyed, and the following three coaches were derailed. Both railway lines were destroyed for a length of and the overhead lines were brought down. Eleven people (eight passengers and three railwaymen) were killed, with 45 being injured, six of them seriously. The relatively small number of casualties was due to the sturdy steel construction of the coaches and the first class carriages at the front being only lightly occupied. The three railwaymen were all in the cab of the engine but the second class coaches were filled to capacity, with standing room only, after a large number of sixth form students boarded after a conference at Keele University. Investigation leaflet distributed to police stations shortly before the automatic crossing was commissioned in July 1967. It had not been seen by either of the officers who escorted the load. The circumstances of the accident, and the subsequent public reaction, led to an Order being made on 16 January for a judicial enquiry under Section 7 of the Railways Act 1871; required because HMRI which would normally hold an accident inquiry was involved in the programme of automating level crossings. The findings of this enquiry would be presented to Parliament by the Minister for Transport. This was the first Section 7 inquiry since the Tay Bridge disaster of 1879. It was chaired by Mr F. B. Gibbens QC. The haulage company The inquiry identified the directors of the haulage company, Robert Wynn and Sons Ltd, as being chiefly to blame. It transpired that, on 8 November 1966, one of their transporters had narrowly avoided disaster when it became grounded on an automatic crossing at Leominster. A catastrophe was only avoided after its driver violently revved the engine and let the clutch in. Wynn's had pointed out their concern at the short warning time given in a letter to British Railways, but received a terse reply from the assistant general manager of the Western Region, and therefore did not press the matter further. BR's reply to them said, \\"I must emphasise ... that the hazard was of your firm's making and it is fortunate that it was not more than a hazard\\". This was described as being \\"remarkable for its arrogance and lack of insight\\". Despite this incident, no instructions regarding automatic crossings had ever been given to Wynn's drivers (or the police escort), and at Hixon the driver assumed that it was safe to cross because the police car had already done so. The role of the police Neither of the police officers who were escorting the load had been to Hixon before. They had both been posted to traffic duties in the Stone Division five days earlier and they were unaware of the presence of a main railway line. Although both officers knew about the existence of automatic crossings in Staffordshire, they were not aware of the comparatively short warning time that the crossing gave, one of them later telling the inquiry, \\"I was absolutely astounded by the speed of the whole process.\\" Leaflets had been distributed to local police stations when the crossing was automated the previous July, although they were only on display for the public to pick up. The inquiry described them as \\"mere flotsam\\". British Rail Both British Rail and the Ministry of Transport also received criticism for their lack of foresight and failure to adequately point out that drivers of slow or heavy loads were required to use the telephone provided before crossing the line. There was a warning notice at Hixon crossing to this effect, but it was almost impossible to read from a passing vehicle. The telephones at some crossings were installed by BR despite the HMRI being opposed to their provision. Aftermath A level crossing in Lincolnshire, showing the improved signage introduced from 1969. This crossing also has an additional warning sign regarding the risk of long vehicles being grounded. From 1969, improved warning signs were introduced, informing drivers of large or slow vehicles that they should telephone the signalman for permission to cross the line. The crossing equipment was also modified so that an amber light was exhibited before the red flashing lights operated. Even so, the automation of level crossings ground almost to a halt; from 207 in 1968, to 234 in 1978. In 1977, the Railway Inspectorate again examined the question of automating level crossings and once again a working party visited mainland Europe. This time, as well as relaxing the requirements, they recommended the introduction of an automatic crossing with only the warning lights, known as an Automatic Open Crossing (AOCR). However, history repeated itself in the Lockington rail crash of 1986, which involved a newly installed AOCR. The level crossing at Hixon was replaced in 2002 by a bridge costing £2 million. In 2017, a book The Hixon Railway Disaster was published by Richard Westwood, whose father Jack Westwood was a BR signal technician at Leominster who phoned the signalman to set the distant and home signals to danger thus avoiding an earlier (1966) accident with a slow Wynns transporter. Fraser Pithie has criticised the role of the HMRI which was 'in the driving seat' with the installation of AHB (automatic half barriers), not BR. Colonel McMullen had stated in 1957 that if they were adopted \\"the principle must be recognised that it is the responsibility of the individual to protect himself from the hazards of the railway in the same way as from the hazards of the road\\". Colonel Reed of the HMRI was put in charge of AHB introduction in 1961, and he opposed the provision of telephones or signal protection. But some BR managers still ensured that a telephone was provided at AHB crossings, and Hixon had a telephone. , the former airfield continues to be the site of various industrial units, known as the Hixon Airfield Industrial Estate. On 6 January 2018, on the fiftieth anniversary of the disaster, a memorial in Hixon village churchyard was dedicated to those who died.

They are not to be confused with elevator mechanics. Consultants (unlike mechanics) do not normally perform work on conveyances. Some elevator consultants may also work as private elevator inspectors. Some jurisdictions may accept independent third party inspectors for certified inspections while others may employ their own inspectors. Job duties Elevator consultants work for property owners, developers, building tenants, architects, engineers, municipal code enforcement bodies and insurance companies for the following purposes: *Identifying elevator system options for Developers in order to create the most efficient transportation solution for a specific building. *Designing elevator systems for Architects and Engineers, including elevator bank traffic studies, component specifications, and providing blueprint drawings for incorporation into contract bid packages. *Performing ASME A17.1 QEI-1 certified inspections under the authority of the Municipal Code Enforcement Officials (in the USA). *Providing maintenance audits to verify contract compliance with the maintenance provisions of the contract, confirming compliance with the ASME A17.1 maintenance provisions, and determining the long term viability of the equipment as required by the Original Equipment Manufacturer's (OEM) maintenance requirements. * Enforcing Municipal code upon conveyances, ensuring the public's safety, although these inspections are frequently performed by elevator inspectors employed by or authorized by public entities. *Expert testimony for lawsuits involving conveyances. Elevator Consultants can be a helpful resource to those who are involved in the design of new buildings and the management of existing buildings. An Elevator Consultant will typically not perform work on a conveyance in order to ensure their independence. In some instances, they may be authorized to address serious hazards as part of their ethical responsibility to the public by removing a conveyance from service, until potential dangers can be addressed. Education background There are no specific university programs to train an Elevator Consultant, although many are trained in mechanical and electrical engineering. Many Elevator consultants are former employees of major manufacturers, but may have limited technical background in the design and construction of buildings. Elevator consultants most frequently gain skills through experience in a variety of conveyance-related work. A qualified Elevator Consultant should have specific experience in elevator construction and modernization, familiarity with model codes and standards, and familiarity with local building codes, laws and regulations. Some elevator consultants may also perform certified inspections, after qualifying and obtaining QEI-1 credentials in the States or Provinces where independent inspectors are authorized. (see elevator inspector) Although some elevator consultants may be certified as QEI Inspectors, verifying qualifications of a consultant can be difficult. One organization called the International Association of Elevator Consultants, (IAEC) sets standards for experience and certification of independence, in order to become a member, which is intended to minimize concerns with the consultant's qualifications. IAEC has recently made available a special certification, the Qualified Elevator Consultant, (QEC). There are currently 10 QECs in the world. Included in this list are representatives from the USA, Canada, and India. Requirements for attaining QEC certification are found in the IAEC bylaws and include, among other things, ten years of verifiable elevator consulting experience and extensive industry involvement. Some elevator manufacturers may also employ trained staff in technical sales and support engineering departments to assist in the design of elevator and escalator systems. Elevator consultants however, are generally employed as independent contractors by architects, engineers or directly by property owners for large scale building projects involving multiple technical disciplines. A design team for a major building project will often require a specific technical design experience by professional consultants, such as a kitchen consultant, lighting consultant, audio-visual consultant, landscape architect, and/or am elevator consultant to supplement the technical work of the architect and engineer. It is expected by the Owner that these design teams will avoid using consultants that represent a specific manufacturer to minimize the potential, or even the appearance of a conflict of interest. The demands of the real estate business have promoted the growth of the elevator consulting field, largely because one of the most expensive parts of the elevator is the space taken in the building. Careful design of the elevator system can both minimize the cost of elevators and improve the efficiency of the building. Elevators and escalators can add a substantial initial and long term investment to a building. A qualified independent elevator consultant is common in large campus type environments such as colleges, hotel chains and malls where standardization of materials and methods is desirable. Elevator inspector In general, elevator and escalator inspectors in the US and Canada are required to carry a current Qualified Elevator Inspector's (QEI) certification. In some jurisdictions, equivalent certification may be offered through State or Provincial authorities; however the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) requires QEI certification as the sole standard for proof of qualification (See: ASME A17.1 Safety Code for Elevators and Escalators). Increasingly, US States are using authorized independent inspectors to perform periodic inspections, witnessing annual tests that in the past would have been the work of State employees. In many States, a list of qualified competitive inspection companies are made available to private property owners to select from. QEI Certification is available from one of three organizations approved by the ASME. Qualification to obtain QEI certification includes extensive previous experience in the field of elevators (and other conveyances), experience working as an inspector and passing a comprehensive written examination. An application is available from the National Association of Elevator Safety Authorities, maintaining current certification that includes meeting standards for continuing education, required to be renewed annually. The qualifications for QEI Inspectors and QEIS (inspector supervisors) and Certifying Organizations and performance standards for inspectors can be found in the ASME standard QEI-1 Standard for the Qualification of Elevators and Inspectors. Inspectors are required by the ASME standards to avoid situations that are considered unethical, such as conflicts of interest that include performing or witnessing inspections and test on conveyances that they or their employer have financial interest in. Inspections are performed using the ASME A17.2 Guide for Inspection of Elevators, Escalators and Moving Walks as well as other relevant reference standards and local building codes. In most cases, inspectors are required to verify that conveyances meet the standards that they were originally installed under, however some jurisdictions may require conveyances that meet more current standards, including US federal authorities that often require conveyances meeting the minimum standards of the ASME A17.3 Safety Code for Existing Elevators and Escalators. Additionally, all conveyances are required to meet current safety standards for maintenance and inspection regardless of the date of original installation. ASME A17.1 Appendix N lists the recommended frequency for conveyance inspections and tests. Each Authority Having Jurisdiction has authority to determine the frequency for inspection in their jurisdiction. However, the International Code Council, the most commonly adopted national standard for building codes in the US, adopts the recommended frequency of Appendix N in its entirety. In general, a QEI certified elevator inspector is required to perform a periodic inspection on passenger and freight elevators and escalators every six months. Additionally, each conveyance is required to have a series of safety tests completed annually by qualified elevator maintenance personnel (as defined by ASME A17.1). This test is required to be witnessed by a QEI inspector that does not have a personal financial interest in, or be employed by someone that has a financial interest in the results of the test. (This would be considered an unethical conflict of interest) In summary, most elevators, escalators, platform lifts and other conveyances that are permitted to carry people, are required to have two periodic inspections and one annual test each year. Additionally, all new and renovated elevators require an acceptance inspection and test to verify that any new or substantially modernized equipment conforms to the latest codes and standards. Elevator Inspection Companies are Independent Contractors that are required to be authorized by the local, State or national authority having jurisdiction. (According to ASME A17.1) Standards for being approved for authorization generally include verification of independence, current certification and appropriate liability insurance. In most Jurisdictions that use independent inspectors, the authority having jurisdiction authorizes multiple inspection companies to avoid concerns with anti-trust lawsuits (see: Professional Ambulance Service, Inc. v. Abramowitz, 328 N.Y.S.2d 467). To protect the interests of the public, authorities are responsible to verify that an inspection company maintains current QEI certification for inspectors (as applicable), provides proper safety equipment to employees, carrying general liability, errors and omissions insurance prior to authorization. Violations of elevator, escalator and other conveyance safety codes may involve civil damages to property owners, and may include liability claims if those violations include personal injuries. Property Owners may incur additional liability, including civil and criminal penalties if it can be proven that they failed to properly maintain and/or meet the State or Provincial requirements for inspections of their conveyances, particularly if those claims are made that indicate negligence. Verification by Users of Conveyances of proof of current inspection is generally the right of the public. Certification processes vary widely across jurisdictions, but in general, the riding public has a right to demand proof that a conveyance available to the public has met the Jurisdiction's standards for current inspections. In States enforcing the ICC International Property Maintenance Code, that right is explicitly stated in section 606.1. Recent attempts to make those certifications more easily accessible to the public were blocked by building owner associations, however the property maintenance code is unambiguous about the right of the riding public to verify current certifications are maintained.

This does not rule out another hypothesis, which states that it comprises multiple trunks from a single individual. The age is unknown, with estimates ranging between 1,200 and 3,000 years, and even one claim of 6,000 years; the best scientific estimate based on growth rates is 1,433-1,600 years. Local Zapotec legend holds that it was planted about 1,400 years ago by Pechocha, a priest of the god that the Aztecs would call Ehecatl, the Aztec wind god,(this is in broad agreement with the scientific estimate); its location on a sacred site (later taken over by the Roman Catholic Church) would also support this. The tree is occasionally nicknamed the \\"Tree of Life\\" from the images of animals that are reputedly visible in the tree's gnarled trunk. As part of an official project local schoolchildren give tourists a tour of the tree and point out shapes of creatures on the trunk, including jaguars and elephants. Slowly dying In 1990, it was reported that the tree is slowly dying because its roots have been damaged by water shortages, pollution, and traffic, with 8,000 cars travelling daily on a nearby highway.

Early life and career Bryant (nicknamed \\"Al\\" or \\"Bones\\") was born in Thomasville, Georgia, and later moved to Detroit, Michigan, where he met best friend Otis Williams. Williams and Bryant were in a number of groups together, including Otis Williams & the Siberians, the El Domingoes, and The Distants before forming The Elgins in 1960 with fellow Distants Melvin Franklin and Otis Williams, and The Primes' Eddie Kendricks and Paul Williams. The Elgins would re-christen themselves as The Temptations before signing with Miracle Records, a subsidiary of Motown Records. After releasing two of the group's singles, the label was closed and all following singles were released under the Gordy Records label. On The Temptations’ studio recordings using this lineup, Paul Williams and Kendricks would split most of the leads, while Otis Williams, Franklin and (the rarely recorded) Bryant were usually called upon to sing background vocals and deliver ad-libs, harmony vocals, and occasionally a few lead lines. However all five group members got a chance to sing lead when they performed live on stage; most of which was handled by Bryant, Kendricks and Paul Williams (the latter would serve as the Temptations main lead, both on stage and in the studio, for most of this period). Bryant would also sometimes sing the lead on \\"May I Have This Dance\\" (led by Kendricks - in his natural voice - on the studio recording), and was a co-lead on \\"I Want a Love I Can See\\" (led only by Paul Williams on the studio version) during live performances the group made in 1963. They also served as background singers for various Motown acts, including Mary Wells and Marvin Gaye. During the Temptations' first two years with Motown, they only scored one charting single, \\"Dream Come True\\", which hit #22 on the R&B; charts; the b-side to the single, \\"Isn't She Pretty\\", featured all five members trading lead vocals.The Temptations - 50th Anniversary: The Singles Collection 1961-1971 [CD liner notes]. New York: Hip-O Select/Motown/Universal Records But despite its commercial success the single still failed to make the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 pop singles charts, just as the group's other six singles released during this period (although most became huge regional hits). Their lack of national success caused Bryant to become restless: he had a regular day job as a milkman, which he preferred to constantly performing and recording with the group. By 1963, Bryant had become sometimes volatile and unpredictable to deal with and he also had a heavy drinking problem. One mid-1963 backstage altercation between Bryant and Paul Williams resulted in the former smashing a beer bottle across the latter's face and landed him in the hospital. Surprisingly, Paul forgave Al and talked the other group members out of firing him as he was determined to give Bryant another chance. However, a few months later, the group would determine that he had done little to change and was still being uncooperative. After a second altercation onstage during Motown's 1963 company Christmas party, Bryant was fired from the group. By the New Year of 1964, the Temptations had recruited David Ruffin as their new fifth member, and the group recorded what would be their first Top 20 pop hit, \\"The Way You Do the Things You Do\\". Later years After being fired from the Temptations, Bryant turned up in a number of other Detroit singing groups, including The Premiers, which reunited him with former Distants bandmate Pee Wee Crawford. He is also listed as appearing with The Dramatics at the Summit on August 23, 1972, when they recorded their Dramatics Live CD, released in 1988 for Fantasy/Stax Records (though it was probably a mistaken credit for then group member Elbert Wilkens).

The side of a 6-inch (15-cm) heave with the soil removed to reveal (bottom to top): · Needle ice, which has extruded up from the freezing front through porous soil from a water table below · Coalesced ice-rich soil, which has been subject to freeze-thaw · Thawed soil on top. Photograph taken 21 March 2010 in Norwich, Vermont Frost heaving (or a frost heave) is an upwards swelling of soil during freezing conditions caused by an increasing presence of ice as it grows towards the surface, upwards from the depth in the soil where freezing temperatures have penetrated into the soil (the freezing front or freezing boundary). Ice growth requires a water supply that delivers water to the freezing front via capillary action in certain soils. The weight of overlying soil restrains vertical growth of the ice and can promote the formation of lens-shaped areas of ice within the soil. Yet the force of one or more growing ice lenses is sufficient to lift a layer of soil, as much as or more. The soil through which water passes to feed the formation of ice lenses must be sufficiently porous to allow capillary action, yet not so porous as to break capillary continuity. Such soil is referred to as \\"frost susceptible\\". The growth of ice lenses continually consumes the rising water at the freezing front. Differential frost heaving can crack road surfaces—contributing to springtime pothole formation—and damage building foundations. Frost heaves may occur in mechanically refrigerated cold-storage buildings and ice rinks. Needle ice is essentially frost heaving that occurs at the beginning of the freezing season, before the freezing front has penetrated very far into the soil and there is no soil overburden to lift as a frost heave.  Mechanisms =Historical understanding of frost heaving  Ice lens formation resulting in frost heave in cold climates. According to Beskow, Urban Hjärne (1641–1724) described frost effects in soil in 1694.Sjögren, Hjalmar (1903) \\"Om ett \\"jordkast\\" vid Glumstorp i Värmland och om dylika företeelser beskrivna av Urban Hiärne\\" (On an \\"earth casting\\" at Glumstorp in Värmland and on such phenomena described by Urban Hiärne), Arkiv för matematik, astronomi och fysik, 1 : 75–99. Patrick B. Black and Mark J. Hardenberg, ed.s, Special Report 91-23: Historical Perspectives in Frost Heave Research: The Early Works of S. Taber and G. Beskow (Hanover, New Hampshire: U.S. Army Corps of Engineers: Cold Regions Research & Engineering Laboratory, 1991). By 1930, Stephen Taber (1882–1963), head of the Department of Geology at the University of South Carolina (Columbia, South Carolina), had disproved the hypothesis that frost heaving results from molar volume expansion with freezing of water already present in the soil prior to the onset of subzero temperatures, i.e. with little contribution from migration of water within the soil. Since the molar volume of water expands by about 9% as it changes phase from water to ice at its bulk freezing point, 9% would be the maximum expansion possible owing to molar volume expansion, and even then only if the ice were rigidly constrained laterally in the soil so that the entire volume expansion had to occur vertically. Ice is unusual among compounds because it increases in molar volume from its liquid state, water. Most compounds decrease in volume when changing phase from liquid to solid. Taber showed that the vertical displacement of soil in frost heaving can be significantly greater than that due to molar volume expansion. Taber demonstrated that liquid water migrates towards the freeze line within soil. He showed that other liquids, such as benzene, which contracts when it freezes, also produce frost heave. This excluded molar volume changes as the dominant mechanism for vertical displacement of freezing soil. His experiments further demonstrated the development of ice lenses inside columns of soil that were frozen by cooling the upper surface only, thereby establishing a temperature gradient. Development of ice lenses Frost heaves on a rural Vermont road during spring thaw The dominant cause of soil displacement in frost heaving is the development of ice lenses. During frost heave, one or more soil-free ice lenses grow, and their growth displaces the soil above them. These lenses grow by the continual addition of water from a groundwater source that is lower in the soil and below the freezing line in the soil. The presence of frost- susceptible soil with a pore structure that allows capillary flow is essential to supplying water to the ice lenses as they form. Owing to the Gibbs–Thomson effect of the confinement of liquids in pores, water in soil can remain liquid at a temperature that is below the bulk freezing point of water. Very fine pores have a very high curvature, and this results in the liquid phase being thermodynamically stable in such media at temperatures sometimes several tens of degrees below the bulk freezing point of the liquid.John Tyndall (1858) \\"On some physical properties of ice,\\" Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London, 148 : 211–229. Summarized in: This effect allows water to percolate through the soil towards the ice lens, allowing the lens to grow. Another water-transport effect is the preservation of a few molecular layers of liquid water on the surface of the ice lens, and between ice and soil particles. Faraday reported in 1860 on the unfrozen layer of premelted water. Ice premelts against its own vapor, and in contact with silica. Micro-scale processes The same intermolecular forces that cause premelting at surfaces contribute to frost heaving at the particle scale on the bottom side of the forming ice lens. When ice surrounds a fine soil particle as it premelts, the soil particle will be displaced downward towards the warm direction within the thermal gradient due to melting and refreezing of the thin film of water that surrounds the particle. The thickness of such a film is temperature dependent and is thinner on the colder side of the particle. Water has a lower thermodynamic free energy when in bulk ice than when in the supercooled liquid state. Therefore, there is a continuous replenishment of water flowing from the warm side to the cold side of the particle, and continuous melting to re- establish the thicker film on the warm side. The particle migrates downwards toward the warmer soil in a process that Faraday called \\"thermal regelation.\\" This effect purifies the ice lenses as they form by repelling fine soil particles. Thus a 10-nanometer film of unfrozen water around each micrometer- sized soil particle can move it 10 micrometers/day in a thermal gradient of as low as 1 °C m−1. As ice lenses grow, they lift the soil above, and segregate soil particles below, while drawing water to the freezing face of the ice lens via capillary action. Frost-susceptible soils Partially melted and collapsed lithalsas (heaved mounds found in permafrost) have left ring-like structures on the Svalbard Archipelago Frost heaving requires a frost- susceptible soil, a continual supply of water below (a water table) and freezing temperatures, penetrating into the soil. Frost-susceptible soils are those with pore sizes between particles and particle surface area that promote capillary flow. Silty and loamy soil types, which contain fine particles, are examples of frost-susceptible soils. Many agencies classify materials as being frost susceptible if 10 percent or more constituent particles pass through a 0.075 mm (No. 200) sieve or 3 percent or more pass through a 0.02 mm (No. 635) sieve. Chamberlain reported other, more direct methods for measuring frost susceptibility. Based on such research, standard tests exist to determine the relative frost and thaw weakening susceptibility of soils used in pavement systems by comparing the heave rate and thawed bearing ratio with values in an established classification system for soils where frost-susceptibility is uncertain. Non-frost-susceptible soils may be too dense to promote water flow (low hydraulic conductivity) or too open in porosity to promote capillary flow. Examples include dense clays with a small pore size and therefore a low hydraulic conductivity and clean sands and gravels, which contain small amounts of fine particles and whose pore sizes are too open to promote capillary flow. Landforms created by frost heaving Palsas (heaving of organics-rich soils in discontinuous permafrost) may be found in alpine areas below Mugi Hill on Mount Kenya. Frost heaving creates raised-soil landforms in various geometries, including circles, polygons and stripes, which may be described as palsas in soils that are rich in organic matter, such as peat, or lithalsa in more mineral-rich soils. The stony lithalsa (heaved mounds) found on the archipelago of Svalbard are an example. Frost heaves occur in alpine regions, even near the equator, as illustrated by palsas on Mount Kenya. In Arctic permafrost regions, a related type of ground heaving over hundreds of years can create structures, as high as 60 metres, known as pingos, which are fed by an upwelling of ground water, instead of the capillary action that feeds the growth of frost heaves. Cryogenic earth hummocks are a small formation resulting from granular convection that appear in seasonally frozen ground and have many different names; in North America they are earth hummocks; thúfur in Greenland and Iceland; and pounus in Fennoscandia. Polygonal forms apparently caused by frost heave have been observed in near- polar regions of Mars by the Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC) aboard the Mars Global Surveyor and the HiRISE camera on the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter. In May 2008 the Mars Phoenix lander touched down on such a polygonal frost-heave landscape and quickly discovered ice a few centimetres below the surface. In refrigerated buildings Cold-storage buildings and ice rinks that are maintained at sub-freezing temperatures may freeze the soil below their foundations to a depth of tens of meters. Seasonally frozen buildings, e.g. some ice rinks, may allow the soil to thaw and recover when the building interior is warmed. If a refrigerated building's foundation is placed on frost-susceptible soils with a water table within reach of the freezing front, then the floors of such structures may heave, due to the same mechanisms found in nature. Such structures may be designed to avoid such problems by employing several strategies, separately or in tandem. The strategies include placement of non-frost-susceptible soil beneath the foundation, adding insulation to diminish the penetration of the freezing front, and heating the soil beneath the building sufficiently to keep it from freezing. Seasonally operated ice rinks can mitigate the rate of subsurface freezing by raising the temperature of the ice.

Design and development British cruiser tank design began with the Mk I and somewhat heavier Mk II in the mid-1930s.

The books are published by Big Balloon, Uitgeverij Oberon (both Dutch), Egmont Ehapa Verlag, Norbert Hethke Verlag (both German), Star Comics and Esperos Comics (both Greek), Incal (Polish), and Glénat (French).

The Navel of the Double God had an early publication in the Dutch magazine Myx.Don Lawrence - In the Myx (last visited on: 04-09-2008) __TOC__ Overview The actual series can be split in two parts: The Chronicles of the Deep World, which takes place on post-apocalyptical Earth, and The Chronicles of Pandarve, taking place in the Pandarve multiverse. Characters The main characters are Storm himself, Roodhaar/Redhair/Carrots/Ember, Nomad and Marduk, the Theocrat of Pandarve, although the last two only make their appearance in The Chronicles of Pandarve. Storm is an astronaut who accidentally got lost in time. Ember is a beautiful red-haired girl and Nomad is a hairless red skinned muscle man. Commander Grek The Deep World was originally conceived as a framework for stories revolving around the character Commander Grek. An episode (in which Commander Grek turns into a fishman) was written in 1976 by Vince Wernham and drawn by Don Lawrence, which was not picked up by Dutch publisher Oberon. The story was later reworked by Philip Dunn, now with the astronaut Storm as the main character. Storm did get published by Oberon. When Storm appeared to be a success, the previously unreleased Commander Grek album was published as part of the Storm series, as \\"Episode 0\\". The album includes background information regarding the inception of Commander Grek and Storm. The Chronicles of the Deep World Storm is an astronaut in the 21st century who makes a journey to the Great Red Spot of Jupiter. The Great Red Spot is an anticyclonic storm which has already been there for at least 300 years. Once arrived, his ship gets dragged into the storm. When Storm manages to escape, it seems he has traveled through time. The civilizations on Earth have collapsed and turned into a barbaric society. This is where the adventures of Storm begin. Apart from albums 4, 5 and 6, each album is a separate adventure. The Chronicles of Pandarve Storm and Ember get beamed to the Pandarve multiverse, where they meet Nomad, and a new enemy: Marduk, the Theocrat of Pandarve. Marduk wants to catch Storm, because Storm is an anomaly (he imbalances the multiverse because he traveled through time) and is the key to give him power over the multiverse. The Pandarve multiverse is a bubble of breathable gas surrounding a white hole that contains Pandarve itself, and thousands of other planetary objects. The main body, Pandarve, is a giant telluric planet. At Pandarve, the normal physical laws are no longer valid; this gives Don and Martin room for incredible stories and magnificent scenery. Also, Pandarve is a living planet - which means it has intellect and can even interact with other beings. For this interaction she normally relies on her Theocrat, but she is also capable of creating a humanlike representation of herself [Alice]. Storm's time travel remains important, but Ember has also travelled through time. So she is (or should be) an anomaly as well (In the Legend of Yggdrasil, they both arrive in a certain time period together). This fact is never really used in the stories. Other planets and planetoids in the Pandarve multiverse described in the chronicles are: * Farseid - a synthetic ring world controlled by robots.

(Vandaahl the Destroyer) The last three albums (The Von Neumann Machine, The Genesis Equation and The Armageddon Traveller) form a trilogy wherein Storm & co and Marduk need to work together to save Pandarve from perdition. A strange, gigantic \\"spaceship\\" (referred to as the Intruder) is headed for a collision with Pandarve, which will mean the end of both entities. The \\"spaceship\\" consists of various \\"cocoons\\". Some time around the 21st century, one \\"cocoon\\" was sent into space with the purpose of making replicas of itself. But because of a system error, the strangest \\"cocoons\\" started to emerge (including one resembling Heaven and one the Hell from La Divina Commedia) and cluttered together instead of floating off. There are some references to well-known stories (Alice in Wonderland, Hänsel und Gretel, Sherlock Holmes, ..), movies (My Little Chickadee and other Western influences), celebrity actors(Marlene Dietrich and Marilyn Monroe, ..) and some mathematical theorems (the Genesis Formula, Goldbach's Conjecture and Fermat's last theorem). Chronicles of Meanwhile About the time when The Genesis Equation was published, a spin- off series was started, called Chronicles of Meanwhile. The episodes take place between albums 6 and 7 of The Chronicles of the Deep World. Three episodes were released, drawn by Dick Matena, the first two under his pseudonym John Kelly. Continuation Cover of the Storm album De Navel van de Dubbele God - (The Navel of the Double God). Three years after Don Lawrence died, a new team continued his work.

He is one of the stalwarts of modern Kannada literature. His most notable work is the Mankuthimmana Kagga (\\"Dull Thimma's Rigmarole\\", 1943), which is similar to the wisdom poems of the late medieval poet Sarvajna.George, pp. 1057, 1437 Publications=Poetry *Vasantha Kusumanjali (1922) *Nivedana (1942) *Kavite *Umarana Osage *Mankuthimmana Kagga *Marula Muniyana Kagga *Shri Rama PareekShaNaM *Antahpura Geete *Geetha Shaakuntala *Kethaki Vana (1973) *\\"Gauravisu Jeevanava\\" Essays *Jeevana saundarya mattu saahitya *Saahitya Shakti *Baaligondu Nambike Drama (ನಾಟಕ) *Vidhyaranya Vijaya *Jack ked *Macbeth *Kanakaaluka *Tilottamey Biography *Diwan Rangacharlu *Gopalakrishna Gokhale *Vidyaranyara Samakaleenaru *Jnapaka chitra shaale 1 to Jnapaka chitra shaale 6 *Halavu mahaneeyaru *Mysorina Divanaru *Kalopasakaruu Political science *Rajyanga Tattvagalu *Rajakeeya Prasangagalu 1 & 2 *Rajya Shastra *Vrutta Patrike *Principles of Constitution *Probity in Public Life  Spiritual  *Purushasookta *Devaru *Rutha, Satya mattu Dharma *Ishopanishat Children's literature *Indravajra *Bekkoji Legacy Published in 1943, Mankuthimmana Kagga is one of the best known of the major literary works in Kannada. The title of this work can be translated as \\"Dull Thimma's Rigmarole\\".George, p. 175 Facing life's challenges with cheerfulness, understanding everything as a divine play, recognizing our own and others needs, honoring human aspirations and dreams, working for noble causes and above all, dissolving our ego in mature thinking are among the great thoughts that the Kagga offers. Countless similes, metaphors and multitude of choice expressions make the reading of the Kagga thoroughly delightful. Translated twice into English, this work has its renderings in Hindi and Sanskrit too. Throwing light on life in its various aspects, this inspiring literature sends out a positive message to all: live, learn, grow and be a blessing to your surroundings. DVG was a titan among Kannada writers, says Ranganatha Sharma. Though DVG only completed matriculation, he gained tremendous knowledge to become a preeminent literary name in Karnataka. DVG's concern for society was incomparable and he was one of the great persons to serve ‘Kannadanadu’. D. V. G wrote a sequel to Mankuthimmana Kagga, known as Marula Muniyana Kagga. Marula Muniyana Kagga is practically the extension of Mankuthimmana Kagga. These are the stray poems of DVG which have been collected together and published after his death. There are 825 poems in this book, 120 poems less than the number of poems in Kagga. :Like the growing tail of :Hanuman in Lanka, :Questions and problems keep :\\"Surging forth for this talkative,'' :a stammerer, Marula Muniya\\" :No Comic story is this Kagga, nor :It is an emotional outpouring, :Stuff it is for cogitation in mind, :Enjoy each poem, one at a time, Marula Muniya He also wrote Srimad BhagavadGeeta Tatparya, also known as Jeevana Dharma Yoga, which has received the Sahitya Akademi Award in 1967. Jeevanadharmayoga (yoga of everyday life) is an extraordinary piece of literature, which provides great solace and at the same time makes a commoner realize values of life, D.V.G has turned the great Hindu philosophical work into a common man's handbook of useful life. Vasantha Kusumanjali was the first collection of poems of DVG. Poems on popular personalities such as nationalists, social reformers, administrators, philanthropists and their activities have been included in this collection. The pen pictures of Tilak, Gokhale, Rabindranath Tagore, Visvesvaraya, Raja Ram Mohan Roy and Gandhi highlight the characteristic qualities of the personalities depicted. On the occasion of his birth centenary, all his works compiled in eleven volumes titled \\"D.V.G. Kriti Shreni\\", are jointly published by Department of Kannada and Culture and Karnataka Sahitya Academy. Very ably edited by late Dr. Ha.Ma. Nayak the volumes were published between 1990 and 2000. A second edition was brought out in 2005 CE. DVG served as the president of the 18th Kannada Sahitya Sammelana (Literary Conference) held in Madikeri in 1932. DVG was a pioneer in writing biography in Kannada. He knew well that human traits were basic material for both creative writing and writing of biography. The book Dadabhai Navaroji that he wrote in 1950 is in a way his experiment with biographical writing. The first biography of Rangacharlu by DVG virtually reveals the author's abounding interest in politics, his deep public sympathy and his faith firmly rooted in democracy. These very values of the author were reiterated in his second biography of Gopalakrishna Gokhale. Other than the biography of Diwan Rangacharlu, the biography of Gopalakrishna Gokhale by DVG is a much appreciated one. Gopalakrishna Gokhale had immense influence on DVG. He was in total agreement with Gokhale's principle, namely, \\"Public life must be spiritualized\\". This very fact led him to found the Gokhale Institute of Public Affairs later. In the preface to the biography, DVG wrote \\"I have written this book to enuciate some principles, ends and means in which I have full faith, implementation of which would do good to the people and society.\\" Gokhale lived a frugal life. This quality along with the undivided commitment to finish the works being undertaken, heavily influenced DVG throughout his life. The biography of Gokhale saw many reprints and it was also prescribed as a textbook. Selected lectures of Gokhale were later added to it. DVG founded the Gokhale Institute of Public Affairs GIPA) located in Bull Temple Road, Basavanagudi and promoted fine arts of India. Sri Nittoor Srinivasa Rao, The then Chief Justice of Karnataka, Masti Venkatesa Iyengar, V.T.Srinivasan, the Principal of Vijaya College, Bengaluru were some of his close associates. DVG died on 7 October 1975. The road where his residence existed in Nagasandra road has been renamed as DVG Road in Basavanagudi. Journalism DVG started his career in journalism in 1906–07. He started Kannada newspapers \\"Bharat\\" and \\"Karnataka\\". DVG started a weekly called \\"Sumathi\\" and a publication division called \\"Sumathi Granthamale\\" under which a dozen small books were published in the course of eight months. The biography of Diwan Rangacharlu was highly appreciated out of these.\\"The Karnataka\\" started off as an English magazine to be published twice every week. With Diwan Visvesvaraya's help, he published the first issue of \\"The Karnataka\\" on 2 April 1913. After about a year, \\"The Karnataka\\" started publishing articles in Kannada. Many important books got an opening in the paper. The English paper earned him a lot of respect and honour from all quarters. DVG was forced to close the paper in 1921 due to want of sufficient support. The book called Vrutta Patrike which was published in 1928 contained the codified quintessence of newspaper publication. Among his books, the one on Political Science published in 1952 can be said to be his tour de force. The rich experience he earned through years of keen observation of state administration, deep study of books of important western political thinkers and his own political formulations have gone into the making of this book. This is the first book of its kind to be published in Kannada. It deals with a variety of subjects relating to formation of state, characteristics of a responsible government, the concept of freedom, freedom of the people, weaknesses of democracy, impact of franchise, fundamental rights and economic policies and principles. A comprehensive coverage apart, the book contained forthright expression of opinions, and is occupying libraries even now as an ideal book of reference for students of political science. In fact, D. V. Gundappa established the Gokhale Institute of Public Affairs (GIPA) at Bengaluru to facilitate a central meeting place for intellectuals, common folk, people with dissenting ideas and ideologies and critics to assemble under one roof to deliberate upon and discuss social issues with a democratic spirit. Gokhale Institute of Public Affairs is today chaired and managed by noted intellectual, writer and journalist S. R. Ramaswamy who shared a close proximity to D. V. G. for several years. A nationalist shall not merely have control over the weaknesses of political nature but would cultivate the qualities of politeness and cordiality. Power without the fear of inquiry is like pickles without salt that would degenerate into a pit of worms, according to DVG. The fear of inquiry is the bodyguard of power administration. DVG has also written two books of the same genre, namely, Principles of Constitution and Probity in Public Life. The first book traces the development of political science in the west in comparison with its growth in the east. It prescribes a standard of minimum education required for administration and citizens. The second one explains in delicate terms the political situation obtaining at present. It is normal nature of man not to exert himself. \\"Be relaxed, not to bother yourself, let it happen whatever that happens.\\" Awards and honours D.V. Gundappa's statue at Bugle Rock Park, Basavanagudi, Bengaluru. Gundappa was awarded Padmabhushan by the Government of India in 1974. The State of Karnataka under Chief Minister Sri Veerandra Patil honored him for his services to Kannada literature in 1970 at Ravindra Kalkshetra, Bengaluru and awarded a purse of Rs 90,000. DVG donated the entire award money to the Gokhale Institute of Public Affairs. India Post issued a commemorative stamp of Dr. Gundappa in 1988. In 2003, a statue was erected to honor DVG in Bugle Rock Park, Basavanagudi. e-Publications Gokhale Institute of Public Affairs has brought out all publications of D. V.

It was based in Stourbridge, Worcestershire, now West Midlands. James Foster, an ironmaster, and John Urpeth Rastrick, an engineer, became partners in 1816, forming the company in 1819. Rastrick was one of the judges at the Rainhill Trials in 1829. The company was dissolved on 20 June 1831. Origins Foster, Rastrick & Company were based at the purpose-built New Foundry, Stourbridge, constructed in 1821 and here shown in a derelict state before conversion into a health centreJames Foster was the half-brother of John Bradley who founded the company John Bradley & Co, taking a lease on land near the canal at Stourbridge in 1800 with the aim of developing an ironworks. The deed of partnership for the company was drawn up in 1802 which granted a share in the company to Bradley's six half-brothers and sisters. By 1813 only John Bradley and James Foster had shares in the company and on Bradley's death in 1816, James Foster took control of the enterprise, which included the Stourbridge Iron Works. John Urpeth Rastrick was an engineer born in 1780 at Morpeth in Northumberland. After finishing an apprenticeship with his father, which included work on steam engines, he worked first at the Ketley Ironworks and subsequently worked in partnership with John Hazledine of Bridgnorth. In 1808 he constructed a locomotive for Richard Trevithick and subsequently constructed a bridge at Chepstow (opened 1816). Shortly afterwards (1817) Rastrick left the partnership with Hazledine's company and moved to West Bromwich. In June 1819 Rastrick and James Foster agreed to form the firm Foster, Rastrick & Company at a site next to the Stourbridge Iron Works. A new foundry was constructed from 1820-1821 to produce products for the partnership. Products The company produced a variety of engineering products including steam engines, proving machines for chain cable, saws, mills, and boilers. It also produced structural components for buildings, bridges and gas works. It had the facilities to produce cast industrial components including beams, cylinders and flywheels as well as some household items. In 1825 it listed railway components in a catalogue of products including rail, railway sleepers and railway chairs.  Locomotives  Foster, Rastrick and Company's locomotives commemorated in a sculpture above the subway leading to Stourbridge Town Station At the end of the 1820s, Foster, Rastrick and Company produced steam locomotives intended for two railways: one in the USA and one just a few miles from the works at Stourbridge. The local opportunity had arisen after an agreement between James Foster and Francis Downing, the mineral agent of John William Ward, the 4th Viscount Dudley and Ward. The parties agreed to build a three-mile railway linking coal mines in the Shut End area with a purpose- built canal basin at Ashwood on the Staffordshire and Worcestershire Canal. In America, at about the same time, the Delaware and Hudson Canal Company were developing a rail and canal link between coal mines at Carbondale and the Hudson River. The Foster, Rastrick and Company built only four steam locomotives (each one having vertical cylinders, placed at the back and each side of the furnace, with grasshopper beams and connecting-rods from them to the crankpins in the four coupled wheels). Three were sent to America and one to the Kingswinford Railway in the Black Country.  For America  The first run of the Stourbridge Lion as depicted by the artist Clyde Osmer DeLand The Delaware and Hudson Canal Company built a canal of total length 108 miles from Rondout on the Hudson River to Honesdale near a coal-bearing region named Carbondale. The canal was finished in 1828 but in order to connect the mines to the canal, the Chief Engineer of the project, John Jervis, planned to construct a railway of around 16 miles in length. Jervis entrusted an assistant, Horatio Allen, who was already planning to visit England, to purchase rail and a locomotive. In the end, Allen bought four locomotives, three from Foster, Rastrick and Company and one from Robert Stevenson & Co. Horatio Allen arranged for the purchase of three locomotives from the company for the use of the Delaware and Hudson Canal Company Of the Foster, Rastrick and Company engines, the Stourbridge Lion built in 1828, was the first locomotive to run on rails in America. It was shipped from Liverpool in April 1829. Two others, named Delaware and Hudson were supplied later that year. The Stourbridge Lion was tested on blocks on May 28, 1829. In July of that year it was sent to Honesdale by boat. Its first test on the railway took place on 8 August 1829 when it ran on 3 miles of track. It quickly became apparent that the track was not stable enough to bear the weight of the locomotive and after a second on September 8, 1829, it was decided not to use the locomotives. The railroad was subsequently operated using gravity, stationary engines and horse power.  For England  The fourth locomotive, Agenoria, was built for service on the Earl of Dudley's Shutt End Colliery Railway in Kingswinford, Staffordshire. It weighed 11 tons, had four coupled wheels of 4 ft ¾in diameter and two cylinders of 8.5 inches diameter by 36 inches stroke. Agenoria was probably the first locomotive to use mechanical lubrication for its axles. The boiler was 10 feet in length and four feet in diameter. The locomotive featured an extremely tall chimney of height 14 feet and 4 inches - this being the most immediately obvious difference between Agenoria and The Stourbridge Lion, which had a shorter chimney. The railway opened on 2 June 1829, the opening being described in Aris's Birmingham Gazette. The track, of standard gauge, was around three miles in length but featured two inclined planes that were too steep for the Agenoria to climb so the locomotive worked about two miles of near-level track. On the opening day, which according to Aris's Gazette, took place \\"amidst an immense concourse of spectators from the surrounding country\\", the locomotive first pulled eight carriages filled with 360 passengers along the level section at a rate of 7.5 miles an hour. For its next demonstration it was attached to twenty carriages, twelve of which carried coal whilst eight carried passengers. For this test it travelled at 3.5 miles an hour. Unlike the company's first three steam locomotives it had a long life, being withdrawn from service in . After a period of neglect, the locomotive was rediscovered disassembled and covered with rubbish. The person who rediscovered it, Mr. E.B. Marten, obtained the permission of the owner William Orme Foster to reassemble the engine and display it at an exhibition in Wolverhampton in 1884. After the exhibition, Foster presented the locomotive to the Science Museum (London) in December 1884 and it is now on permanent display at the National Railway Museum in York.  Dissolution  Although pioneering, the company's locomotive designs were almost immediately outdated upon the arrival in 1829 of George Stephenson's Rocket, the locomotive which virtually set the pattern for the rest of the steam age. Ceasing locomotive work, the company was officially dissolved on 20 June 1831, its assets being absorbed into the Stourbridge Iron Works of John Bradley & Co. (iron manufacturer and owner of several coal mines), where James Foster was already the major partner and after 1832 the sole owner.  The factory building today  The original factory building in Lowndes Road where Stourbridge Lion and Agenoria were built is still standing, although near to collapse from a fire in 2004. Its renovation began in 2012 to house (with a new adjoining building) a Stourbridge medical practice, which will be known as the Lion Medical Practice.Stourbridge News 25 October 2012.

W. Bush, making him one of the longest-serving press secretaries in history. He is the only U.S. Press Secretary to be appointed by two different U.S. Presidents (Stephen Early and Pierre Salinger served as transition press secretaries for a few weeks and a few months, respectively). Early life and education Fitzwater was born in a Salina, Kansas hospital; his family's farm was in Dickinson County. He attended school in Abilene, Kansas from kindergarten to his graduation in 1960. He received a degree in journalism from Kansas State University in 1965.Appointment of Marlin Fitzwater as Assistant to the President for Press Relations Fitzwater became a member of Delta Tau Delta fraternity and also served in the United States Air National Guard. While in school, he worked at newspapers (Lindsborg News Record, Abilene Reflector-Chronicle, Manhattan Mercury, and Topeka Capital Journal) in various Kansas communities before moving to Washington, D.C. upon graduation. Career in the government In Washington, Fitzwater served at various federal agencies, including the Appalachian Regional Commission (1965–67), the U.S. Department of Transportation (1970–72), and the Environmental Protection Agency (1972–80). He was the spokesman who explained the toxic waste disposal problem in America and developed the public information activities related to disaster sites like Love Canal in New York State. Fitzwater was named Outstanding Civil Servant in government in 1980. He served as Deputy Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs at the Department of the Treasury from 1981 to 1982. Fitzwater headed to the White House in 1983 and served until 1993: He served in the Reagan White House as president's spokesman under the title Assistant to the President for Press Relations from 1987 to 1989, until Reagan left office in 1989.

When Mikhail Gorbachev first visited the United States, in Reagan's first term, Fitzwater gave joint press briefings with his Soviet counterpart. Over 7,000 journalists attended them. Press Secretary under George H.W. Bush When George H.W.

It first appeared in discrete two-to-four-page episodes, in issues 6 through 41 of the Franco-Belgian comics magazine Métal Hurlant from 1976 to 1979,BD Oubliées (Forgotten Comics) website listing. \\"Jean Giraud (Gir, Moebius) dans Métal Hurlant\\" Retrieved 17 May 2014. and later in the American version of the same magazine, Heavy Metal, starting in 1977. It was subsequently collected as a graphic novel in various editions. Publication history The book-length version appeared first in the original French and with the original black and white art, and only later in a US edition in English and in color. The US edition, published by Marvel Comics' Epic imprint in 1987 (as the third volume in a series devoted to the collected works of Moebius), used a new translation, by Jean-Marc Lofficier and Randy Lofficier, different from the Heavy Metal serialisation, and presented the work with the pages colored. This version, along with most of the other Epic volumes collecting Moebius's work, was later reprinted in a signed & numbered limited edition hardcover series from Graphitti Designs. It was also published in the UK as a graphic novel by Titan Books in 1989, in advance of a Sony film adaptation that was never made. It was also reprinted in 1992 in the smaller, standard comic-book format, as a four-issue limited series that included several new pages drawn especially for that edition. In the twenty years since then, no English-language edition has been published. In France, however, as of 2012, the French version (Le Garage Hermétique) is available in both the original black-and-white \\"classique\\" edition and in a \\"Moebius U.S.A.\\" format that combines the color art from the US editions with the original French text.

The latter has never appeared in English. Some of the characters from these stories also show up in the 1974 comic Le Bandard Fou (The Horny Goof), which can be considered a prequel to The Airtight Garage. The hero of The Airtight Garage, Major Grubert, was also the subject of some shorter comic-strip stories, poster images, and paintings over the course of his creator's long career, and eventually became the central character in an entire sketchbook-as-graphic-novel entitled Le Major, published in a limited edition facsimile in 2011. Major Grubert and his lady companion Malvina also appear throughout the six-volume Inside Moebius series (2000–2008). Plot Moebius has explained that the story was improvised in a deliberately whimsical or capricious manner. For this reason, the story is at times (deliberately) confusing. The \\"garage\\" itself is actually an asteroid in the constellation Leo which houses a pocket universe. Major Grubert orbits the asteroid in his spaceship Ciguri, from which he oversees the development of the worlds contained within. Several entities, including Jerry Cornelius, seek to invade the garage. Critical responses The Airtight Garage is \\"generally regarded as Moebius’ masterpiece\\" according to journalist and critic Chris Mautner, who ranked it first on a list of \\"essential Moebius works\\" shortly after the author's death in March 2012.

Trademark dispute The Jerry Cornelius character was originally invented by Michael Moorcock who at one point gave permission for him to be used by any artist or writer who wished to. There was later some dispute over the character, and the right of use was revoked. When Marvel Comics reprinted the series, the name Jerry Cornelius was changed to \\"Lewis Carnelian\\". In 2006, on his website, Moorcock himself wrote: Legacy The Airtight Garage was also the name of a bar and videogame parlor in the Metreon in San Francisco, featuring unique original games developed for the venue. The name and architectural styling was no coincidence, and Moebius souvenirs could be purchased there. The arcade was later renamed Portal One, and the original games were phased out in favour of more familiar ones (although the decor was still Moebius-inspired). It closed permanently on 13 May 2007. It reopened briefly under the name Tilt with the same decor, but otherwise as a traditional arcade. Tilt is now closed, and the entire second floor of the building has become a City Target concept store.

It followed directly on from the Tank, Cruiser, Mk III (A13 Mk I). The first Mk IVs were Mk IIIs with extra armour fitted to the turret. Later Mk IVAs were built with the complete extra armour. The tank was used in France in 1940 and in the early part of the war in North Africa, before being withdrawn from service. In total, 955 of these tanks were built. Design and development Britain became interested in fast tanks after observing the Soviet BT tanks during the 1936 Red Army manoeuvres. The BT was based on the revolutionary designs of American J. Walter Christie and a team from Morris Motors was sent to the United States to purchase a Christie tank and the rights to build more. The tank became known as the A13E1 and was delivered in late 1936, but the hull was too small and this led to a second British-built prototype. The A13E2 was built to mount the turret of the Vickers designed Cruiser Tank MkI (A9). This carried a 40 mm Ordnance QF 2-pounder gun and a co-axial .303 water-cooled Vickers machine gun. The drive train was also revised, with the road wheels no longer powered so the tank could not be driven on its wheels alone. Better tracks were used, with rear-mounted drive sprockets and in trials, over was attained on them but later the speed was governed to . The armour of the A13E2 was , in line with other pre-war fast tank designs. The A13E3 was the final trials model, which led to the production tank, A13 MkI, Cruiser Tank Mk III, which entered production in 1939 at Nuffield Mechanization & Aero Limited, a munitions subsidiary of Morris Motors. An order for 65 tanks was placed and at least 30 tanks completed when the War Office decided to build a new model with thicker armour. The A13 MkII, Cruiser Tank Mk IV, had a maximum armour thickness of and faceted armour was mounted on the original turret sides and rear. This gave the tank a far more modern appearance; some Mk III tanks were re-built to Mk IV standard while at the factory. The .303 Vickers machine gun gave constant trouble and was replaced by the 7.92 mm BESA. All British tanks were to have their designs modified to mount the new weapon from early 1940. This led to the main production version, the A13 MkIIA, Cruiser Tank MkIVA. A few examples were sent with the BEF to France, along with most of the earlier A13s. It is not known how many A13 MkIVA tanks were built - the numbers depending on the source. Between the Cruiser Mark III and Cruiser Mark IV, 665 had been built when production ended in 1941. English Electric, Leyland and LMS Railway were also involved in A13 production. In France, the A13 did not do well, due to poor crew training as a result of its being rushed into service. Many tanks shipped to France were in poor condition and some were so new that they had vital parts missing. The A13 performed much better in the deserts of North Africa and coped with the conditions better than some other designs. It was fast, adequately armed and armoured against Italian and German tanks. It remained an effective weapon until late 1941, when newer models of the Panzer III and Panzer IV appeared with thicker armour and larger guns. In North Africa, it was the anti-tank gun that claimed the vast majority of British tanks lost in battle; German tanks accounted for few British losses, contrary to popular belief.Harris J. P. and Toase F. N., Armoured Warfare (London, 1990), p78 The Cruiser MkIV was replaced by two tank designs, the Cruiser MkV Covenanter tank and the A15 Crusader. The A13 Covenanter was a radical departure from the original A13 design and constituted an entirely new tank though reliability issues meant to was used just for training. The A15 Crusader tank retained the original Cruiser IV Liberty engine but in all other respects was a new design.

The MkIVA featured a new gun mantlet and was built at several factories, including LMS Railway. It was the main type used in the desert from 1940–42. Combat history Approximately 40 Cruiser Mk IV and MkIVA, saw service in France in 1940 with the 1st Armoured Division of the British Expeditionary Force. Most were abandoned at Calais, and the few tanks that did see action were destroyed by the numerically superior German armored forces. From October 1940, the Cruiser Tank MkIVA was sent to North Africa, where it was used with the older A9, Cruiser Tank MkI and A10 Cruiser Tank MkII. The A13 was never available in sufficient numbers and a typical armoured brigade would have a mixture of slow () A9 and A10 with faster () A13 and Light Tank Mk VI (acting as cruiser tanks). This caused tactical and supply difficulties, but the A13 was popular with its crews and its only deficiency was the lack of a high-explosive shell for the 2-pounder. In common with all cruisers, it was vulnerable to standard Axis anti-tank guns, (unlike the Matilda II infantry tank), which it could only counter with short-range machine gun fire. The A13 was generally reliable and the 2-pounder gun was adequate against all Axis tanks up to late 1941, when the A13 was retired. It was replaced by the A15 Crusader tank, which was an enlarged A13 with thicker armour. Nine MkIV tanks captured by the Germans after the Battle of France were reused as command vehicles for Panzer Abteilung (Flamm) .100 during Operation Barbarossa.http://beutepanzer.ru/Beutepanzer/uk/A13_MkII/a-13_MkII-3.htm ReferencesExternal links * HenkofHolland * OnWar.com * WWIIvehicles.com Category:Cruiser tanks of the United Kingdom Category:World War II tanks of the United Kingdom ","title":"Cruiser Mk IV"},{"id":"1486409","text":"Cirroc Lofton (born August 7, 1978) is an American actor who started his career at nine years of age with many minor roles.

They were created on November 15, 1928 https://www.snackhistory.com/reeses-peanut-butter-cupsby H. B. Reese, a former dairy farmer and shipping foreman for Milton S. Hershey. Reese left his job at The Hershey Company to start his own candy business. Reese's generates more than $2 billion in annual sales for The Hershey Company https://www.foodbusinessnews.net/articles/14762-reeses-thins-a-win-for- hersheyand Reese's Peanut Butter Cups are #1 on the List of top-selling candy brands. The history of the H.B. Reese Candy Company In 1923, The H.B. Reese Candy Company was established in the basement of Reese's home in Hershey, Pennsylvania. Reese had originally worked at a Hershey dairy farm, and from the start he used Hershey Chocolate in his confections. Reese's Peanut Butter Cups were his most popular candy, and Reese eventually discontinued his other lines. H. B. Reese died on May 16, 1956, in West Palm Beach, Florida passing the company to his six sons, Robert, John, Ed, Ralph, Harry, and Charles Richard Reese. On July 2, 1963, the Reese brothers merged the H.B. Reese Candy Company with the Hershey Chocolate Corporation in a tax- free stock-for-stock merger. In 2020 after 57 years of stock splits, the Reese brothers' original 666,316 shares of Hershey common stock represented 16 million Hershey shares valued at over $2.5 billion that paid annual cash dividends of $51.4 million. In 1969, only 6 years after the Reese/Hershey merger, Reese's Peanut Butter Cups became The Hershey Company's top seller. The H.B. Reese Candy Company is maintained as a subsidiary of Hershey because the Reese plant workforce is not unionized, unlike the main Hershey plant. In 2012, Reese's was the best-selling candy brand in the United States with sales of $2.603 billion, and was the fourth-best-selling candy brand globally with sales of $2.679 billion—only $76 million (2.8%) of its sales were from outside the United States market. Additionally, the H.B. Reese Candy Company manufactures the Kit Kat in the United States, which had 2012 U.S. sales of $948 million. As of October 2017 in the U.S. convenience store channel, Reese's was the largest confection brand by far: it was 62% larger than the next brand, with more households purchasing Reese's than any other confection brand across the United States. Reese's includes the overall top-selling confection item—the Reese's Peanut Butter Cups King Size—as well as six of the top 20 chocolate/non-chocolate items. Additionally, the Reese's brand accounts for over 47% of all seasonal sales within the U.S. convenience store channel, including the top two items in the largest four commercial seasons: Valentine's, Easter, Halloween, & Christmas. As a comparison, the next largest brand accounts for only 10% of seasonal sales. Product Brand Variations The first Peanut Butter Cup, a peanut butter and chocolate confection, was launched in 1928 by The H.B. Reese Candy Company. The official product name was actually \\"Penny Cups\\" because the cost was only one cent at that time. In 1963, The Hershey Company purchased The H.B. Reese Candy Company from H.B. Reese's sons. Since then, the famous Reese's Peanut Butter Cup product portfolio has grown to sell different variations of the product, using alternate chocolate or candy coatings, offering different sizes, and honoring different seasonal holidays and events. As the introduction of these variations took off in popularity, they soon earned a permanent spot in the product portfolio. The first non-original Reese's Peanut Butter Cup product brand variation was launched in 1976, under the product name \\"Reese's Crunchy\\". The Reese's Crunchy product brand variation featured a crunchy peanut butter creme, as opposed to the smooth peanut butter creme in the original Reese's Peanut Butter Cup. In 1987, the first Reese's Peanut Butter Cup, King Size was launched. In 1993, Hershey nationally launched the Reese's Peanut Butter Pumpkins. The White Creme pumpkins were added to the Reese's Peanut Butter Pumpkin line in 2017. In 1997, Hershey added another seasonal product brand variation to the Peanut Butter Cups product line with national launch of the Reese's Peanut Butter Hearts. In March 2003, Hershey's introduced a Sugar Free variation of the Reese's Peanut Butter Cup, called Reese's Sugar Free Peanut Butter Cups. In December 2003, the White Reese's Peanut Butter Cup product variation was permanently added to the Reese's Peanut Butter Cup product line. The product brand variation originally launched as \\"White Chocolate Reese's Peanut Butter Cups\\" but was changed to White Reese's or White Creme Reese's after much scrutiny for its misrepresentation since the product does not actually include any chocolate. Reese's Big Cups are a thicker version of the traditional Reese's Peanut Butter Cup which was introducted in 2003, but was not added to the permanent product brand portfolio until 2005. In 2007, Hershey released a limited edition \\"Elvis Peanut Butter & Banana Creme\\" Reese’s Peanut Butter Cup product variation to honor the King. The filling flavor was inspired with by Elvis Presley's known love of peanut butter and banana sandwiches. Although this product brand variation has not made its way onto the list of the permanent product brand offerings, there is a petition to bring it back permanently. Although being introduced on and off as part of limited edition product variations for many year, the Dark Chocolate Reese's Peanut Butter Cups product made its permanent debut in 2009. In July 2016, The Hershey Company launched a product variation that merges two of Reese's popular product brands: Reese's Pieces and Reese's Peanut Butter Cups. The new product brand variation is called Reese's Pieces Peanut Butter Cups which consist of the original Reese's Peanut Butter Cup that has Reese's Pieces candy mixed in to the peanut butter filling. IIn March of 2017, Hershey added the Reese's Crunchy Cookie Peanut Butter Cup which are a variation of the original Reese's Peanut Butter Cup including crunchy cookie bits in the peanut butter filling. Hershey has since launched a Big Cup version called Reese's Big Cup Crunchy Cookie. In October 2018, Reese's Peanut Butter Cups launched a product brand variation that was 40% thinner than the original cup, called Reese's THiNs. Reese's THiNs were first launched in only milk chocolate or dark chocolate, but now are offered in white creme as well. In April 2019, the Chocolate Lovers and the Peanut Butter Lovers product brand variations of Reese's Peanut Butter Cups were launched. The Peanut Butter Lovers Cup features a peanut butter top on the shell coating, and the Reese's Chocolate Lovers cup features more chocolate. Variations of these two product brands were launched originally in 2005 as a limited edition. The Peanut Butter Lovers cup in 2005 did not have extra peanut butter in the shell coating as it does today. In July 2020, Hershey announced its first-ever colored product brand variation, the Reese's Peanut Butter Franken-Cup. The Reese's Franken-Cup consists of milk chocolate, white creme that is dyed green, and the traditional peanut butter creme filling. In September 2020, The Hershey Company announced the introduction of a new product variation on the Reese's Peanut Butter Big Cup that will include pretzel pieces within the peanut butter creme filling, called \\"Reese’s Big Cups with Pretzels\\". At the same time, Hershey also announced the limited edition Big Cup launched in March 2021 called \\"Big Cup with Chips\\" which will be a Reese's Big Cup with potato chips mixed into the peanut butter creme filling.

The \\"Classic\\" two-pack is a 0.75 oz. cup since 2001 (originally a 0.9 oz. size, reduced to 0.8 oz. in 1991), the \\"King Size\\" four-pack introduced in the early 1980s is a 0.7 oz. cup (originally a 0.8 oz. cup until 1991) and the \\"Lunch\\" eight-pack is a 0.55 oz. cup. \\"Large Size\\" packs of three 0.7 oz. cups, as well as bags containing 0.6 oz. cups, are also available. The \\"mini\\" cups come in various bag sizes and foil colors for seasonal themes like red, gold and green for the Christmas holiday season. In Canada, where they are packaged as Reese Peanut Butter Cups, but still widely referred to by their American name, they come in a standard pack of three 0.55 oz. cups or the king-size variation with four cups. In the United Kingdom and Ireland, they were originally available only in two-packs, though are now available in three-packs, five-packs and minis. In 2008 Reese's Peanut Butter Cups were made available in Europe by Hydro Texaco and 7-Eleven. In Australia, Reese's products can be found in many specialty candy stores, as well as from American stores such as Costco. In the 1970s and 1980s, a series of commercials were run for Reese's Peanut Butter Cups featuring situations in which two people, one eating peanut butter and one eating chocolate, collided. One person would exclaim, \\"You got your peanut butter on my chocolate!\\" and the other would exclaim, \\"You got your chocolate in my peanut butter!\\" They would then sample the mixture and remark on the great taste, tying in with the slogan \\"Two great tastes that taste great together.\\" In the 1990s, the product's slogan was: \\"There's no wrong way to eat a Reese's.\\" In 2006, its slogan was: \\"Perfect\\". The current slogan, introduced in 2018, is: Not Sorry Reese's. Reese's was an associate sponsor of NASCAR Cup Series drivers Mark Martin (1994), and Kevin Harvick (2007–2010).

Located in Salt Lake City, Utah, it is the centerpiece of the 10 acre (40,000 m2) Temple Square. In the Latter Day Saint movement, a temple is a building dedicated to be a house of God and is reserved for special forms of worship. A temple differs from a church meetinghouse, which is used for weekly worship services. Temples have been a significant part of the Latter Day Saint movement since early in its inception. Today, temples are operated by several Latter Day Saint denominations. The most prolific builder of temples of the Latter Day Saint movement is The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church). Several others within the movement have built, or attempted to build, temples. The Community of Christ operates two temples in the United States, which are open to the public and are used for worship services, performances, and religious education.Temple School, Community of Christ, (retrieved February 14, 2010) Other denominations with temples are the Apostolic United Brethren, the Church of Christ, the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints and the Righteous Branch of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. __TOC__ History The Kirtland Temple, owned and maintained by the Community of Christ, was the first temple of the Latter Day Saint movement and the only temple completed in the lifetime of Joseph Smith The Nauvoo Temple: built in 1846, destroyed soon after, and rebuilt in 2002 The Latter Day Saint movement was conceived as a restoration of practices believed to have been lost in a Great Apostasy from the true gospel of Jesus Christ. Temple worship played a prominent role in the Bible's Old Testament, and in the Book of Mormon.\\"Questions and Answers\\", Tambuli, July 1984, pp. 6–10, 24–26 On December 27, 1832, two years after the organization of the Church of Christ, the church's founder, Joseph Smith, reported receiving a revelation that called upon church members to restore the practice of temple worship. The Latter Day Saints in Kirtland, Ohio, were commanded to: :\\"Establish a house, even a house of prayer, a house of fasting, a house of faith, a house of learning, a house of glory, a house of order, a house of God.\\"Doctrine and Covenants (1835 ed.) VII:36; LDS Church ed. 88:119; Community of Christ ed. 85:36b. Latter Day Saints see temples as the fulfillment of a prophecy found in (KJV): \\"Behold, I will send my messenger, and he shall prepare the way before me; and the Lord, whom ye seek, shall suddenly come to his temple, even the messenger of the covenant, whom ye delight in: behold, he shall come, saith the Lord of hosts.\\" It is believed to emphasize that when the Jesus comes again, he will come \\"to his temple.\\" As plans were drawn up to construct a temple in Kirtland, the decision was made to simultaneously begin work on a second temple at the church's colony in Jackson County, Missouri. Surviving plans indicate that both temples would have the same dimensions and approximately the same appearance and both were to be at the \\"centerplaces\\" of cities designed according to Smith's plan for the City of Zion. Conflict in Missouri led to the expulsion of the Mormons from Jackson County, preventing any possibility of building a temple there, but work on the temple in Kirtland continued. At great cost and sacrifice, the Latter Day Saints finished the Kirtland Temple in early 1836. On March 27, they held a lengthy dedication ceremony and numerous spiritual experiences and visitations were reported. Conflict relating to the failure of the church's Kirtland Safety Society bank, caused the church presidency to leave Kirtland and move the church's headquarters to the Mormon settlement of Far West, Missouri. Far West was also platted along the lines of the City of Zion plan and in 1838 the church began construction of a new, larger temple in the center of the town. They may also have dedicated a temple site in the neighboring Mormon settlement of Adam- ondi-Ahman. The events of the 1838 Mormon War and the expulsion of the Mormons from Missouri left these attempts at temple-building no further progressed than excavating foundations. In 1839, the Mormons regrouped at a new headquarters in Nauvoo, Illinois. They were again commanded to build a \\"House of the Lord\\"—this one even larger and greater than those that went before. Plans for the temple in Nauvoo followed the earlier models in Kirtland and Independence with lower and upper courts, but the scale was much increased. New conflicts arose that led to Smith being killed, along with his brother Hyrum, at Carthage Jail on June 27, 1844. The Nauvoo Temple stood only half finished. Eventually, this temple was finished and dedicated. Some temple ordinances were performed before most of the Latter Day Saints followed Brigham Young west across the Mississippi River. Smith's death resulted in a succession crisis which divided the movement into different sects. The concept of temple worship evolved separately in many of these sects and until the 1990s only the sects claiming a succession through Brigham Young continued to build new temples. In April 1990, the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (RLDS Church) began to construct the Independence Temple, which was dedicated in 1994. The RLDS Church—now called the Community of Christ—owns the Kirtland Temple, which is used for worship services and special events but also open to visitors, including various Latter Day Saint denominations interested in the building's historical significance. Purposes Temple in Salt Lake City on \\"Temple Square\\" circa 1897 The Mesa Arizona Temple built in 1919 Temples have held numerous purposes in the Latter Day Saint movement, both historically and their differing expressions today. These purposes include: *A House of the Lord — Smith reported a revelation in 1836 explaining that the recently dedicated Kirtland Temple was built \\"that the Son of Man might have a place to manifest himself to his people.\\" (Doctrine and Covenants LDS 109:5). All Latter Day Saint denominations with temples still consider them to be special houses of the Lord. *A House of Learning — The Kirtland Temple housed the \\"School of the Prophets.\\" *Center of the City of Zion — Latter Day Saints often view temples as central to the establishment of Zionic communities. Examples include: the Kirtland Temple, the original (unfinished) Independence Temple, the (unfinished) Far West Temple, the (unfinished) Adam-ondi-Ahman Temple, the original Nauvoo Temple, the Salt Lake Temple, the St. George Utah Temple, the Mesa Arizona Temple, the , and others. *Headquarters of the church — the Kirtland Temple served as the headquarters of the early church from its completion in 1836 through the end of 1837. *Sacred spaces for special ordinances — Beginning in Nauvoo, temples were spaces in which to perform special ordinances such as the endowment and baptism for the dead — see Ordinance (Mormonism). LDS Church The Columbus Ohio Temple, an example of smaller temples built under Hinckley's direction The Preston Temple in the United Kingdom in 2006. The LDS Church has been the most prolific builder of temples in the Latter Day Saint movement. In the LDS Church, temples are not only a House of the Lord, but are also where members of the church make covenants and perform sacred ordinances, such as baptism for the dead, washing and anointing (or \\"initiatory\\" ordinances), the endowment, and eternal marriage sealings. Ordinances are a vital part of the theology of the church, which teaches that they were practiced by God's covenant people in all dispensations. Additionally, members consider the temple a place to commune with God, seek God's aid, understand the will of God, and receive personal revelation. Upon completion (or after the completion of significant renovations), temples are open to the public for a period of time (an \\"open house\\"). During the open house, the church conducts tours of the temple with missionaries and members from the local area serving as tour guides, and all rooms of the temple are open to the public. The temple is then dedicated as a \\"House of the Lord,\\" after which only members in good standing are permitted entrance. Thus, in the LDS Church, temples are not churches or meetinghouses but rather places of more consecrated worship. History In 1832, shortly after the formation of the church, Smith said that the Lord desired the Latter Day Saints build a temple;Recorded in the Doctrine and Covenants, Smith wrote that the Lord commanded the Saints to \\"establish a house, even a house of prayer, a house of fasting, a house of faith, a house of learning, a house of glory, a house of order, a house of God;\\" (see ) and they completed the Kirtland Temple in 1836. Differing from other churches in the Latter Day Saint tradition, members feel that the first endowment ceremonies were performed in Kirtland, Ohio, although the endowment performed in Kirtland differed significantly from the endowment performed by Smith in Nauvoo. The construction of the Nauvoo Temple and the teaching of the full endowment by Smith are seen as the final steps in restoring the church founded by Jesus Christ following the Great Apostasy. Because it is an integral part of their worship, Mormon pioneers, upon arriving in the Salt Lake Valley, began plans to build temples there, and built the Endowment House to allow members to receive the endowment until the temples were completed. Construction Initially, the church constructed temples in areas where there were large concentrations of members: Utah, Idaho, Arizona, Hawaii, and Alberta. In the mid-20th century, because of the importance of temples in the theology, the church tried to balance density with the travel requirements that attending the temple imposed upon members. Thus, temples were built in Europe (Switzerland–1955 and England–1958); the Pacific Islands (New Zealand–1958); and Washington, D.C. (1974) when membership alone might not have justified the effort. Temple growth continued in the 1980s, church president Spencer W. Kimball (1895–1985) directed the church to build smaller temples with similar designs. Before this time, all but the Swiss Temple were at least , and the average size of the first 20 temples was . The new temples varied in size but were generally less than allowing temples to be built where there were fewer members. As a result, the first temples in South America (Brazil–1978); Asia (Japan–1980); and Latin America (Mexico City–1983) were built and the number of temples doubled from 15 to 36. Church president Gordon B. Hinckley (1910–2008) also accelerated the construction of temples through the use of an even smaller standardized base designHinckley announced the use of smaller standardized temples in 1997 (). The base design is about , and temples built from the design are generally between . These temples generally do not include a large laundry facility, do not provide members with the ability to rent temple clothing, nor provide a cafeteria for members (Almanac, 2000). and set a goal to have 100 operating temples before 2001. Between the brief building period from 1998 to 2001, 38 of these standardized temples were constructed and dedicated, meeting Hinckley's goal and, during his service as president, the number of temples more than doubled from 47 to 124. Church of Jesus Christ (Cutlerite) Cutlerite meetinghouse in Independence, Missouri, which serves the functions of a temple. The Church of Jesus Christ (Cutlerite) performs temple ordinances in its Independence, Missouri, meetinghouse, their only building still in active use,A second meetinghouse exists in Clitherall, Minnesota, but it is not currently in use. though the church also believes in the principle of constructing special temples such as the ones in Kirtland and Nauvoo. Cutlerites do not designate their meetinghouse as a temple per se, but they believe that it serves precisely the same purpose and that the ordinances performed there are equally as valid as ones done in any pre-1844 temple. These sacred services of the Cutlerites are not open to the public, and participants are forbidden to discuss them outside the room in which they are performed. Cutlerite meetinghouses are constructed with a main-floor chapel that is always open to the public unless baptisms for the dead are being performed; a second-floor room, which is closed to the public at all times, is reserved for the ordinances of the endowment. Cutlerites do not use the term \\"endowment\\" to refer to these rituals; they generally refer to them as \\"the priesthood ordinances.\\" A rectangular-shaped baptismal font is accessed through a trap door beneath the floor of the main-floor chapel, which is used for baptisms of both the living and the dead. Eternal marriages are not performed by the Cutlerites, as they have always rejected that particular doctrine. Community of Christ Independence Temple of Community of Christ in Independence, Missouri, USA. Dedicated 1994 Community of Christ (formerly the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints) maintains two temples. Unlike those of the LDS Church, these temples are open to the public. Many religious functions take place including communion and a daily prayer for peace. The temple built in Kirtland, Ohio, is owned and maintained by Community of Christ. This was the first temple built by the Latter Day Saint movement and the only temple completed in the lifetime of Joseph Smith. During its 1994 World Conference, Community of Christ dedicated the Independence Temple located in Independence, Missouri. The Community of Christ describes this temple as a house of worship and education \\"dedicated to the pursuit of peace\\".Doctrine and Covenants, Section 156:5. See also The church holds a Daily Prayer for Peace at 1:00 p.m. Central Time in the temple's 1,600 seat sanctuary. Other denominations with temples Four additional Latter Day Saint denominations have built temples: *The Church of Christ (Wightite) built a temple near Zodiac, Texas, about three miles from Fredericksburg, at a colony founded by Lyman Wight. The only remaining material infrastructure of the colony is the Mormon Mill cemetery near Hamilton Creek, about fifty miles east by north of Fredericksburg.Van Wagenen, Michael. The Texas Republic and the Mormon Kingdom of God. College Station: Texas A&M; University Press, 2002. *The Righteous Branch of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, a denomination founded in 1978, built a pyramid-shaped temple near Modena, Utah. This was the first time any of the polygamous Mormon fundamentalists sects built a temple of their own. *The Apostolic United Brethren built a temple in Ozumba, Mexico, in the 1990s, and has had an endowment house in Utah since sometime in the 1980s. *The Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter- Day Saints (FLDS) built a temple at their settlement near Eldorado, Texas, in 2004. The architectural footprint of the FLDS temple roughly matches that of the original Nauvoo Temple. file:FLDS Eldorado hi.jpgFLDS Temple file:Righteous Branch Temple.jpgRighteous Branch temple Unsuccessful attempts at building temples During the life of Joseph Smith, a few years before the Kirtland temple was built, Smith dedicated a location in Independence, Missouri, for the building of a special temple, which was to be the center of a New Jerusalem. However, hostile action by non-Mormon citizens resulted in the expulsion of all Latter Day Saints from the area in 1833, and the planned temple did not proceed beyond the laying of cornerstones. As of 2011, the lot for this temple is owned and maintained by the Church of Christ (Temple Lot). The Temple Lot church endeavored to construct a temple beginning in 1929, as a result of a revelation that apostle Otto Fetting was said to have received from John the Baptist. A hole for the proposed temple basement was excavated, and architects' drawings were done, but no further work was completed due to a chronic lack of funding and the expulsion of Fetting and his followers (about one-third of the Temple Lot organization at the time) from the Temple Lot church. In 1946, the City of Independence had the hole filled in, and the lot today is mostly covered with grass, with the Church of Christ's meetinghouse and a few trees at the northeast corner.Jackson County Temple Lot Saga, Deseret News, 22 June 2009. Today, the Temple Lot church has no plans to build a temple but sees itself as the steward of the lot until the various Latter Day Saint factions unite around the time of Jesus Christ's Second Coming. The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (Strangite) endeavored to construct a temple in the mid-1840s in Voree, Wisconsin, according to a rather elaborate plan devised by their prophet James J. Strang. Poverty and factional infighting among the Strangites prevented the temple from progressing beyond the planning stage.Voree Temply by John Hamer, in By Common Consent, 17 October 2008. The church has made no attempt to build temples since Strang's death. Performing ordinances in other buildings Building currently known as the Endowment House, Spring City, Utah. From 1855 to 1889, the LDS Church performed ordinances in the Endowment House to allow members to receive the endowment during construction of temples in Utah. Before the Endowment House was built, the Council House was similarly used, between 1850 and 1855. Historically, there were other locations where ordinances for the living were performed, both indoors and out, as recorded in pioneer journals. One of these is a building known as the Endowment House in Spring City, Utah, built by Orson Hyde.Allen D. Roberts, “The ‘Other’ Endowment House,” Sunstone 11 (July–August, 1978): 9-10. The building is still standing at 85 West 300 South.

Holt (born January 17, 1965) is an American Baptist minister and a conservative Republican politician from Springdale in northwestern Arkansas. Background Holt was born in Camden in Ouachita County, southern Arkansas. He joined the military in 1987 and served in the U.S. Army Joint Intelligence Operations at the National Security Agency. His website notes he \\"was involved in highly classified operations during the Cold War, the ousting of Manuel Noriega from Panama, and Operation Desert Storm\\". He is a \\"small business owner/operator and a part-time counselor\\". In 1996, Holt became an ordained Southern Baptist minister. He and his wife, the former Bobye Barenberg, originally of Rogers, Arkansas, have ten children. Political career Holt was first elected to the Arkansas House of Representatives in the 2000 general election. He served in the House from 2001 to 2003, during which time, he sponsored a bill designed to prohibit the teaching of the theory of evolution in Arkansas public schools (see Evolution below). Holt was elected to the Arkansas Senate in the 2002 general election and served there until December 31, 2006. In 2004, Holt was the Republican nominee for the U. S. Senate. He was defeated by the Democrat Blanche Lincoln, 55–44 percent. In 2006, Holt was the Republican nominee for lieutenant governor and was defeated by Democrat Bill Halter, 57–42 percent. In 2010, Holt was a candidate in the Republican primary for U.S. Senate and was defeated by Republican John Boozman, 53–17 percent, with the remaining percent divided among six other GOP candidates. Boozman in turn unseated Lincoln, against whom Holt had run six years earlier. Political positions=Evolution Holt co-sponsored Arkansas House Bill 2548 in 2001, which would have required public schools to identify evolution as an unproven theory, and which would have prohibited the use of public funds for the promotion of evolution-related information as fact. The bill was sponsored by several other House members, including Representative Jack Critcher, who later became the Democratic President Pro Tempore of the Arkansas Senate. The measure fell six votes short of passage. Holt was criticized in July 2006 by Don Michael, an opinion writer for the Fayetteville Northwest Arkansas Times, for having invited in April 2001 the creationist Kent Hovind to speak on behalf of the bill before a House committee. Abortion Holt has also attempted to halt or restrict abortion. He has called for the overturning of Roe v. Wade as an example of \\"judicial tyranny plaguing our nation today. The laws in all fifty states were overturned, and the consent of the governed as the basis for all just governmental power was thrown out. I will not confirm a federal judicial nominee who I believe will vote to uphold Roe vs. Wade.\\" Healthcare Holt opposes the healthcare reform measures implemented by the U.S. Congress in March 2010, stating \\"We don’t need health care 'reform', but remove government from the health sector and let the market decide. Opposition to Mike Huckabee As a legislator, Holt tangled publicly with former Governor Mike Huckabee over immigration. Huckabee, who like Holt is a Southern Baptist preacher, spoke out against Holt's proposal in 2005 to ban state services to illegal immigrants. Holt has criticized Huckabee for having told him, \\"I drink a different kind of Jesus juice.\\" That same year, Holt opposed Huckabee's unsuccessful effort to make children of illegal immigrants eligible for state-funded scholarships and in- state tuition to Arkansas colleges, a position also adopted in Texas under Republican Governor Rick Perry. Holt defended his position by asking Huckabee if he would allow the same privileges to families of military personnel deployed overseas. Huckabee did not respond. In December 2007, Holt was asked by the presidential campaign of Congressman Ron Paul of Texas to go to Iowa and do several radio interviews about Huckabee with former colleague Randy Minton of Cabot, Arkansas. Holt did not endorse Paul or any other candidate, but he vowed to acquaint Iowa caucus participants about liberal aspects of Huckabee's record in Arkansas. On January 18, 2008, the Northwest Arkansas Times ran an opinion piece by Holt blasting Huckabee and his supporters. Holt accused Huckabee's followers of not researching what Huckabee's positions are, and supporting him merely because he is a Christian.

Such rules include the way in which the participants should look and the way in which they approach, dance with and leave their partner. Etiquette can vary in its specification and stringency between different styles of dance.  Why Dance Etiquette is Important  Why is dance etiquette important? It makes the difference between having a happy or unhappy dancing experience. It helps you avoid offending or upsetting your partner and other dancers. It helps you build a good reputation for yourself as a dancer. Whether the style of dance, dance can be a socially intimate activity and you must know the proper dance manners.  Asking For A Dance  When asking for a dance, it is best to stay with traditional phrases: * \`\`May I have this dance?'' * \`\`Would you like to dance?'' * \`\`Care to dance?'' * \`\`Shall we dance?'' In the past men typically have followed the tradition that a man asked a woman to dance. This practice has changed over the years and today woman should feel equally comfortable asking a partner for a dance, no matter the setting.  Cutting In  Cutting in is a process in dancing where a person interrupts two dance partners and claims the partner of one. If a gentleman or woman would like to dance with a someone who is already dancing with another person, he/she may cut in by approaching the dancing couple, tapping the him/her on the shoulder, and asking, “May I cut in?” \\"May I finish this dance?\\" etc. It is inappropriate for either member of the dancing pair to refuse the request to cut in. If the first gentlemen or woman would like to dance with the other individual again, he/she must wait until the next dance to ask him/her to cut in.  Declining A Dance/Being Declined  Being declined is always hard to experience for both individuals. Dance etiquette requires that one should avoid declining a dance under most circumstances. For example, there is no correct way of refusing an invitation on the basis of preferring to dance with someone else. According to tradition, the only graceful way of declining a dance is either voice * You do not know the dance, * You need to take a rest, or * You have promised the dance to someone else. Dancers are encouraged to use discretion and restraint when exercising this option. In some situations, the simplest best way may be to say “No, Thank You.” Responding to a “No, Thank You” can be tough, but don’t read into it too much. They were polite and honest and maybe just don’t want to dance. Dealing with rejection can show your true colors as well so, move on and go ask someone else, while smiling.  Dance Hygiene  Dance involves an activity where people may be in close contact. Before dancing make sure to * Be sure to bathe, * Wear deodorant, * Keep in mind of your breath, you may need a mint. These are all things everyone should do daily but especially when dancing with a partner. Make sure to keep fingernails trimmed and/or out of harm’s way. Wear appropriate clothing depending on the dance/function attending.  Western social dance rules  * The dancers move counter clockwise (from above) around the floor. * When things go wrong on the dance floor always apologize. Generally it does not matter who is at fault. * If you are moving more slowly than other dancers keep to the center of the floor. * If you are engaged in conversation move off the dance floor. * To cross the room either dance across the floor or walk around the perimeter. * Carry food and beverages around the perimeter. Wipe up your own spills. * While dancing, do not give dance tips unless asked. If asked, just give tips about what you were asked about. When engaged in giving a lengthy tip, or if you stop dancing to discuss it, move off the dance floor. And, above all, don't give that person tips again until they ask you again. * The traditional rule about declining dances was that you could politely turn down a request to dance only by saying something like \\"No, thank you. I'm sitting this one out.\\" or \\"I'd be happy to dance with you later. I just need to rest now\\", and that if you turn down a request to dance, to be polite, it was considered important that you not dance at all during the dance in question. Many dance groups today have abandoned this rule, and explicitly say that it's always ok to decline a dance with a simple \\"no, thank you\\", and no reason need be given. * Don't just dance with your favorite dancers. It's called \\"social\\" dancing for a reason. * It is always up to the follow, not the lead, to set the distance between the partners. However, if the lead feels like he is being held too closely for comfort or safety, they might say something like \\"If you move away a little bit, I'll be able to lead you more safely.\\" If either partner is not being allowed to set what they feel is a comfortable and safe distance, they should feel free to say that they need to sit down to rest, or something else equally polite. * Be aware of sight lines between ourselves, other dancers and the audience when onstage and offstage.

Cultural communication differences can be identified by 8 different criteria: # when to talk; # what to say; # pacing and pausing; # the art of listening; # intonation; # what is conventional and what is not in a language; # degree of indirectness; and # cohesion and coherence.  Cross-cultural pedagogies  The appearance of the term \\"cross-cultural\\" in the titles of a number of college readers and writing textbooks beginning in the late 1980s can be attributed to a convergence of academic multiculturalism and the pedagogical movement known as Writing Across the Curriculum, which gave educators in the social sciences greater influence in composition pedagogy. Popular examples included Ourselves Among Others: Cross-Cultural Readings for Writers (1988), edited by Carol J. Verburg, and Guidelines: A Cross Cultural Reading Writing Text (1990), ed. Ruth Spack. Cross-cultural studies Cross-cultural studies is an adaptation of the term cross-cultural to describe a branch of literary and cultural studies dealing with works or writers associated with more than one culture. Practitioners of cross-cultural studies often use the term cross- culturalism to describe discourses involving cultural interactivity, or to promote (or disparage) various forms of cultural interactivity. Cross- culturalism is nearly synonymous with transculturation, a term coined by Cuban writer Fernando Ortiz in the 1940s to describe processes of cultural hybridity in Latin America. However, there are certain differences of emphasis reflecting the social science derivation of cross-culturalism. The term \\"cross-culturalism\\" became prevalent in cultural studies in the late 1980s and 1990s.Joseph Trimmer and Tilly Warnock, Understanding Others: Cultural and Cross-Cultural Studies and the Teaching of Literature Urbana, IL: National Council of Teachers of English, 1992. An early proponent of the term was the Guyanese writer Wilson Harris, who wrote in The Womb of Space (1983), that \\"cultural heterogeneity or cross-cultural capacity\\" gives an \\"evolutionary thrust\\" to the imagination.Wilson Harris, The Womb of Space (Westport: Greenwood, 1983): xviii.Wilson Harris, The Unfinished Genesis of the Imagination, ed. Andrew Bundy. London/New York: Routledge, 1999. Anthropology exerted a strong influence on the development of cross-culturalism in literary and cultural studies. French anthropologist Claude Lévi-Strauss was a key figure in the development of structuralism and its successor, post- structuralism. Cross-influences between anthropology and literary/cultural studies in the 1980s were evident in works like James Clifford and George Marcus's collection, Writing Culture: the Poetics and Politics of Ethnography (1986). Harvard anthropologist Clifford Geertz was cited as an influence on literary critics like Stephen Greenblatt, while other literary/cultural scholars turned to works by Victor Turner and Mary Douglas. Like multiculturalism, cross-culturalism is sometimes construed as ideological, in that it advocates values such as those associated with transculturation, transnationalism, cosmopolitanism, interculturalism, and globalism. Nevertheless, cross-culturalism is a fundamentally neutral term, in that favorable portrayal of other cultures or the processes of cultural mixing are not essential to the categorization of a work or writer as cross-cultural. Cross-culturalism is distinct from multiculturalism. Whereas multiculturalism deals with cultural diversity within a particular nation or social group, cross-culturalism is concerned with exchange beyond the boundaries of the nation or cultural group. Cross-culturalism in literary and cultural studies is a useful rubric for works, writers and artists that do not fit within a single cultural tradition. To the extent that cultures are national, the cross-cultural may be considered as overlapping the transnational. The cross- cultural can also be said to incorporate the colonial and the postcolonial, since colonialism is by definition a form of cross-culturalism. Travel literature also makes up a substantial component of cross-cultural literature. Of the various terms, \\"cross-culturalism\\" is the most inclusive, since it is free of transnationalism's dependence on the nation-state and colonialism/postcolonialism's restriction to colonized or formerly-colonized regions. This inclusiveness leads to certain definitional ambiguity (albeit one derived from the term culture itself). In practice, \\"cross-cultural\\" is usually applied only to situations involving significant cultural divergence. Thus, the term is not usually applied in cases involving crossing between European nations, or between Europe and the United States. However, there is no clear reason why, for example, Alexis de Tocqueville's Democracy in America or even Woody Allen's Annie Hall (in which the protagonist experiences culture shock after traveling to Los Angeles from New York City) could not be considered cross-cultural works. Although disagreement over what constitutes a \\"significant\\" cultural divergence creates difficulties of categorization, \\"cross-cultural\\" is nevertheless useful in identifying writers, artists, works, etc., who may otherwise tend to fall between the cracks of various national cultures.  Cross-cultural studies in the social sciences  The term \\"cross-cultural\\" emerged in the social sciences in the 1930s, largely as a result of the Cross-Cultural Survey undertaken by George Peter Murdock, a Yale anthropologist. Initially referring to comparative studies based on statistical compilations of cultural data, the term gradually acquired a secondary sense of cultural interactivity. The comparative sense is implied in phrases such as \\"a cross-cultural perspective,\\" \\"cross-cultural differences,\\" \\"a cross-cultural study of...\\" and so forth, while the interactive sense may be found in works like Attitudes and Adjustment in Cross-Cultural Contact: Recent Studies of Foreign Students, a 1956 issue of The Journal of Social Issues. Usage of \\"cross-cultural\\" was for many decades restricted mainly to the social sciences. Among the more prominent examples are the International Association for Cross-Cultural Psychology (IACCP), established in 1972 \\"to further the study of the role of cultural factors in shaping human behavior,\\" and its associated Journal of Cross-Cultural Psychology, which aims to provide an interdisciplinary discussion of the effects of cultural differences.

Cross-cultural narratives tend to incorporate elements such as: *acculturation or resistance to acculturation *culture shock *ethnographic description *overcoming of social obstacles through acculturation, tricksterism, kindness, luck, hard work, etc. *return home (often accompanied by further culture shock) *social obstacles such as discrimination, racism, prejudice, stereotypes, linguistic difficulties, linguicism *travel writing  Cross-cultural music  Music has long been a central medium for cross-cultural exchange.

The ornate 30-story building, completed in 1928, is one of the major works of architect Albert Kahn, and is designed in an Art Deco style, faced with limestone, granite, and several types of marble. The Fisher family financed the building with proceeds from the sale of Fisher Body to General Motors. It was designed to house office and retail space. The building, which contains the elaborate 2,089-seat Fisher Theatre, was designated a National Historic Landmark on June 29, 1989. It also houses the headquarters for the Detroit Public Schools and the studios of radio stations WJR, WDVD, and WDRQ. History Façade detail Initially, architect Joseph Nathaniel French of Albert Kahn Associates planned for a complex of three buildings, with two 30-story structures flanking a 60-story tower. However, the Great Depression kept the project at one tower. The Fisher brothers located the building across from the General Motors Building, now Cadillac Place, as General Motors had recently purchased the Fisher Body Company. The two massive buildings spurred the development of a New Center for the city, a business district north of its downtown area. The building's hipped roof was originally covered with gold leaf tiles, but during World War II these tiles were covered in asphalt because it was feared that the reflective surface would attract enemy bombers. After the war, the asphalt could not be removed from the gold tiles without harming them, so they were replaced with green tiles. Since the 1980s, these tiles have been illuminated at night with colored lights to give them a gold appearance. On St. Patrick's Day, the lights are changed to green and, in recent years, to celebrate the NHL playoffs, the tower is illuminated with red lights in honor of the Detroit Red Wings. In 1974, Tri-Star Development purchased the Fisher Building and adjoining New Center Building for approximately $20 million. In 2001, FK Acquisition LLC, a real estate firm based in Southfield, purchased the two buildings from TrizecHahn Corporation for $31 million. FK Acquisition LLC lost the buildings to its lender in 2015. In 2002, Detroit Public Schools (DPS) paid the owner of the Fisher Building $24.1 million to purchase five floors to house administrative offices, citing the high cost of renovations needed at the Maccabees Building, the previous headquarters, to comply with building and safety codes. In July 2015, Southfield-based developer Redico LLC, in partnership with HFZ Capital Group of New York City and Peter Cummings of The Platform, a Detroit-based development company, taking advantage of the general decline in Detroit real estate values, purchased the Fisher Building and adjacent Albert Kahn Building, plus 2,000 parking spaces in two parking structures and three surface lots in New Center for only $12.2 million at auction. Redico said the partnership plans to transform the two buildings, which are connected by an underground pedestrian concourse, into what it called a \\"true urban\\" mixed-use development, with a mix of office, retail, residential and entertainment uses. The multi-year project has a potential cost of $70 million to $80 million in addition to the purchase price. The Redico interest was purchased by Cummings and his partner in The Platform, Dietrich Knoer, in 2016. Architecture Arcade and theatre entrance The Fisher Building rises 30 stories with a roof height of , a top floor height of , and the spire reaching . The building has 21 elevators. Albert Kahn and Associates designed the building with Joseph Nathaniel French serving as chief architect. French took inspiration from Eliel Saarinen's Tribune Tower design of 1922, seen in the emphasis on verticality and the stepped-back upper stories. The building is unlike any other Albert Kahn production. It has been called \\"Detroit's largest art object\\". In 1929, the Architectural League of New York honored the Fisher Building with a silver medal in architecture. The opulent three-story barrel vaulted lobby is constructed with forty different kinds of marble, decorated by Hungarian artist Géza Maróti, and is highly regarded by architects. The sculpture on the exterior of the building was supplied by several sculptors including Maróti, Corrado Parducci, Anthony De Lorenzo and Ulysses Ricci.Broddie, Joan, Decoration of the Fisher Building Lobby, Master’s Essay, University of Michigan, 1978 p. 19 Radio Designs called for two flagpoles atop the gilt roof. While they were installed, they were essentially unusable as a radio antenna was installed when one of the building's oldest tenants, radio station WJR, leased space in December 1928. On-air hosts often mention that broadcasts originate \\"from the golden tower of the Fisher Building.\\" This was a requirement of the station's original lease in exchange for a nominal rent. Two other radio stations, WDVD-FM (the former WJR-FM) and WDRQ-FM, also have broadcast studios in the building. In 1970, building employees discovered a storage room sealed with tape. None of the staff knew what the room contained or why it was sealed. When they located the key, they found the flags of 75 nations that apparently were created in 1928 and intended to be flown for foreign visitors. Fisher Theatre The building also is home to the Fisher Theatre, one of Detroit's oldest live theatre venues. The theatre, designed by the Chicago-based architectural firm of Anker S. Graven & Arthur G. Mayger, originally featured a lavish Aztec-themed interior in the Mayan Revival style, and once had Mexican-Indian art, banana trees, and live macaws that its patrons could feed.Schneider, Andrew (August 16, 2016). Exclusive: Rare photos inside the original Fisher Theatre. Curbed Detroit. Retrieved August 17, 2016. After the Depression, the theatre operated primarily as a movie house until 1961. Originally containing 3,500 seats, the interior was renovated into a 2,089-seat playhouse that allowed for more spacious seating and lobbies for patrons at a cost of $3.5 million. The decor was changed to a simple mid-century design. The \\"new\\" Fisher Theatre opened October 2, 1961 and is owned and operated by the Nederlander Organization. It primarily features traveling productions of Broadway shows and has hosted numerous out-of-town tryouts.

The battle resulted in U.S. forces fighting their way across the Moselle and liberating Nancy. Overview When the Third Army began its attempt to capture Nancy, it had only recently recovered from a severe fuel shortage which had caused it to halt on the Meuse River for five days. During this time, German defenders in the area had reinforced their positions. While the U.S. XX Corps in the north was tasked with the capture of Metz, Nancy, the other major city in the region, was assigned to the U.S. XII Corps. When the XII Corps first started on this assignment it was not at full operational strength as the 35th Infantry Division was guarding the southern flank of the Allied forces until the southern Seventh Army could close the gap. This left only the 4th Armored Division and the 80th Infantry Division available. U.S. forces U.S. XII Corps - Major General Manton Eddy *4th Armored Division - Major General John S.

Flieger-Regiment (ad hoc regiment of Luftwaffe antiaircraft units and other ground troops) 80th Infantry Division attempts to secure a bridgehead Initial plans for assault on Nancy. Due to the difficulty of the terrain and lack of intelligence about enemy strength, it was decided against risking the 4th Armored Division in the initial capture of a bridge, as had been done at Commercy. Instead, the 80th Infantry Division was assigned to secure three crossing sites across the Moselle: at Pont-à- Mousson with the 317th Infantry Regiment, Toul with the 319th Infantry Regiment, and a limited one at Marbache () with the 318th Infantry Regiment. The 4th Armored Division would then sweep around from the northern Pont-à- Mousson to assault Nancy from the east, while infantry from Toul would attack from the west. At Pont-à-Mousson, the 317th Infantry dispensed with reconnaissance and preliminary artillery bombardments, hoping to use tactical surprise instead. This turned out to be a poor decision though, as the German defenders, who were in greater strength and much better prepared than assumed, held terrain that allowed them to observe the movement of the American forces in the vicinity. American forces made two crossing attempts, the first in the daylight and the second at night, but both were easily repulsed and the assault was called off by General Eddy. Confronting the German 92. Luftwaffe- Regiment around Marbache, the 318th Infantry had a difficult fight through the woods as they tried to seize the high ground which commanded the vicinity. After a two-day battle, they managed to dislodge the German defenders and capture the hill, but were soon thrown back by a German counter-attack. At Toul, there was seemingly more success as a loop of the Moselle was crossed by the 319th Infantry, but it was short-lived as the German defenders of the 3rd Parachute Replacement Regiment simply fell back until they reached a defensive line flanked by two forts from which they were able to stall further advances. The Americans regroup Though the initial crossing attempts largely failed, by 7 September the situation had started to improve for the Americans. With the Seventh Army rapidly approaching from the south and the XV Corps returning to the Third Army to guard the southern flank, the 35th Infantry Division was now available to use in the next assault. A new plan drawn up was for the 80th Division to attack in the north and the 35th Division in the south along with the 4th Armored's Combat Command B (CCB), while Combat Command A (CCA) would wait in reserve to exploit either flank. This new plan was scheduled to take place on 11 September. The Dieulouard Bridgehead After the poor results from the hasty earlier crossing attempts, greater effort was made for a coordinated and well-supported assault, with General Eddy deciding on a concentric advance to encircle the German forces around Nancy. Dieulouard (), located about south of Pont-à-Mousson, was chosen as the new crossing site for the northern thrust of the encircling maneuver. The new plan would have the 317th Infantry cross first and secure a foothold, then for the 318th Infantry to follow and capture the high ground centered on Mousson Hill to the north. A heavy bridge would then be laid and CCA would be able to strike and capture Château-Salins, an important rail centre in the region. Because the 319th Infantry was still engaged in combat at Toul, they could not be used in this assault. Because of the formidable terrain held by the German forces, extra support was called in. On 10 September, the IX Bomber Command destroyed a bridge at Custines to prevent enemy reinforcements from Nancy, and the following evening struck at Mousson Hill. In order to feint the enemy, artillery and air strikes were primarily directed at Pont-à-Mousson. The infantry crossings took place on September 12 and met with only weak resistance. So fast was the advance that elements of CCA were able to cross on the very same day. The reason for this ease was the Americans had crossed in a region near where two separate German divisions (3. Panzergrenadierdivision and the 553. Volksgrenadierdivision) linked up and were thinly posted. Most of the reserves in the area had already been sent north to engage XX Corps. The German assault to destroy the bridge began about 01:00 on 13 September, and was initially successful as troops of the 29. Panzergrenadier-Regiment forced a retreat of the American infantry and pushed them almost back to the bridge itself. An American battalion commander assembled enough troops and medium tanks (of the attached 702nd Tank Battalion) to stop the Germans at le Pont de Mons. CCA sent a reconnaissance troop of armored cars and jeeps into the bridgehead at 06:15, and this unit pushed to the outskirts of Sainte-Geneviève () but was forced to halt by German self-propelled guns. As daylight broke, the Germans began retreating to the north and east, pursued by 80th Division troops and tanks of CCA. CCA's 37th Tank Battalion—commanded by Lt. Col. Creighton Abrams—pushed across the bridgehead and rapidly moved to the southeast, defeating German roadblocks and taking prisoners. By that evening, the bridgehead was considered secure, allowing all of CCA to cross and move on Château-Salins. The following day saw further counterattacks against the foothold by German forces emerging from mist-shrouded hills, but they were again repelled by the 80th Division, aided by reinforcements sent back from the advanced CCA. The Flavigny and Bayon Bridgeheads On 10 September, as the 35th Division moved into position to begin their part of the assault, a bridge, rigged with demolition charges but otherwise intact, was located at Flavigny (). The 2nd Battalion of the 134th Infantry Regiment was given permission to assault the bridge at dusk, and although they succeeded in capturing it and establishing a bridgehead, reinforcements failed to arrive. The Americans defeated two German infantry attacks, but the bridge was subsequently destroyed by German artillery early the next morning. The American troops were forced back across the river by a third German counterattack supported by tanks, suffering heavy losses. This loss prevented the regiment from being further involved in the attempt to secure a crossing site, and the next day, it was instead assigned to guard the left flank at Pont St. Vincent (). At this location, the regiment garrisoned an 1880s-era French fort which was subject to a small German assault that was eventually broken up by artillery. CCB managed to cross at Bainville-aux-Miroirs () and near Bayon (). A large bridge was floated at Bayon that night, which German forces attempted to destroy, but were annihilated instead after being encircled. The 137th Infantry also managed to secure a foothold at Crévéchamps () after a feint to the north and a half-hour artillery bombardment. They quickly found themselves pinned down after crossing, but were able to fight themselves out after German forces were depleted following the failed counterattack against the Bayon bridgehead. Encirclement of Nancy 4th Armored Division encircles Nancy The drive of Abrams' 37th Tank Battalion on 13 September reached Fresnes-en-Saulnois (), a village located west of Château-Salins. The next day, orders were changed though and CCA was to instead capture the high ground at Arracourt (), cutting off German escape routes from Nancy. On arrival in the area, CCA encountered and dispatched forces from the 15. Panzergrenadierdivision with only light casualties, then proceeded to set up a defensive position, oriented towards the east from which they were able to harass German forces on the main road to Nancy and send advance units to meet with patrols from CCB around the Marne-Rhin Canal. The raiding party was very successful, as CCA took over 400 prisoners, destroyed over 160 vehicles, and knocked out ten guns. The following day brought word to CCA of further German counterattacks at Dieulouard, at which point they released a reinforcing infantry battalion as well as a tank company to stabilize the situation. After CCB crossed the Moselle in the south, the German defenders, finding poor natural defense in the terrain, retreated to the Forêt de Vitrimont () across the Meurthe River. The Germans had little time to prepare their defenses in the area, and were soon driven off after CCB crossed the Meurthe River on 14 September, the bulk of them falling back to Lunéville. The meeting with units from CCA at the Marne-Rhein Canal that night completed the encirclement of Nancy. Liberation of Nancy The concentric assault around Nancy hastened the German withdrawal from the city which had already been authorized on 13 September by Generaloberst Johannes Blaskowitz, the army group commander. The 320th and 137th Infantry Regiments pushed out of the Bayon bridgehead and made an oblique advance to the Meurthe River, crossing it by the evening of 14 September. By 16 September, the 320th Infantry had crossed the Marne-Rhin Canal while the 137th Infantry had pushed up to it in the vicinity of Saint-Nicolas-de-Port (). At this point, resistance by the 553. Volksgrenadierdivision stiffened again, and both regiments found themselves under heavy fire. On 14 September, the 319th Infantry was prepared to advance on Nancy proper. Intelligence provided by the French Forces of the Interior informed the U.S. troops that the Germans had evacuated the Forêt de Haye (), and on 15 September, the 3rd Battalion, 319th Infantry entered Nancy on the Toul Road and pushed through to the eastern outskirts of the city with no opposition. Aftermath The capture of Nancy provided the Allies an important communications center in France and the city later served as the garrison of Third Army Headquarters. The German defenders of Nancy, however, largely escaped the encirclement of the city and were available for further operations during the Lorraine Campaign. The XII Corps' successful assault across the Moselle around Nancy also prompted the subsequent German counter-attack at Arracourt by the 5. Panzerarmee.

The film was distributed by Warner Bros. under their Warner Bros. Family Entertainment label. The film stars Macaulay Culkin (in his final film as a child actor), John Larroquette, Edward Herrmann, Jonathan Hyde, and Christine Ebersole, while Reggie Jackson, Claudia Schiffer, and Ben Stein appear in cameo roles. Culkin's younger brother, Rory Culkin, played the part of Young Richie Rich. In theaters, the film was shown with a Wile E. Coyote and the Road Runner cartoon called Chariots of Fur, and it was followed by the direct-to-video sequel Richie Rich's Christmas Wish. Plot Richie Rich is the world's richest boy, the son of billionaire businessman and philanthropist Richard Rich. Richie has only his loyal butler Herbert Cadbury as a companion, and lacks any friends his own age. At a dedication to the reopening of United Tool, a factory Richard recently acquired (intending to modernize the factory and give it away to the workers as a token of goodwill) Richie encounters a group of sandlot kids playing baseball. Unfortunately, before he is able to talk to them, the overly-strict head of security, Ferguson, stops Richie and sharply pulls him away. Cadbury, ever the \\"third parent\\", reprimands Ferguson for his excessively-physical treatment of Richie. Richard tries to spend time with his son whenever he can, but is usually busy. Hence, the family's chief scientist Professor Keenbean has invented a cellular-phone-like machine called the \\"Dadlink\\" that pinpoints Richard's location in seconds, so that Richie can talk to his dad whenever he's away on business. Meanwhile, the greedy CFO of Rich Industries Lawrence Van Dough is plotting to steal the Rich financial fortune, believed to be stored in the Rich family vault. Van Dough, with the help of Ferguson, plots to blow up the plane carrying the Rich family to England. After a failed attempt on Richie's part to make friends with the sandlot people, Cadbury makes a suggestion to Richie's mother Regina and arranges for Richie to stay home in Chicago for a weekend of fun with the sandlot people. That weekend allows Richie to earn the friendship of the sandlot people — most importantly, the assertive Gloria Koscinski. Cadbury also begins to fall for Gloria's pleasantly-outspoken mother, Diane. During the plane trip to England, the bomb is detected. Richard is able to toss it out his window, but the bomb detonates while still near the plane, destroying part of the tail, sending Billion Dollar One into the Bermuda Triangle. Richard and Regina survive the crash and float on a life raft. Believing that Richie's parents are dead, Van Dough assumes leadership of the Rich corporation, and proceeds to cut the many charitable contributions the Rich family were known for. This includes closing the recently reopened United Tool factory, which the parents of the sandlot people relied upon for their income. This angers Richie, and so with the encouragement and assistance of Cadbury, he proceeds to the company headquarters and, as a living Rich family member, assumes the leadership position. Van Dough, however, sees this as a minor setback: as Richie is still underage, his ability to run the business is limited by the powers given to him by someone who was able to give it to him – namely, Cadbury. Cadbury is framed for the Rich family's apparent murder when bomb parts are found in his room, and most of the Rich family's other loyal servants are fired en masse by Van Dough's edict. Van Dough plots to have Cadbury murdered in jail and make it look like a suicide. With Professor Keenbean eavesdropping on their conversation, he manages to sneak Richie out and enact a successful plan to help Cadbury escape from prison just as a hulking hitman arrives to murder Cadbury; though bruised, Cadbury is able to knock out the hitman. Cadbury and Richie then make their way to Gloria's house, where Diane tends to Cadbury, and Richie uses Gloria's computer to hack into the Dadlink's mainframe at Rich Manor. During this time, Van Dough finds out about Cadbury's escape and, with Ferguson's help, confronts Keenbean. They tie the professor up and threaten him with his own invention, the molecular reorganizer which uses nuclear plasma technology to transform matter into a different form. Keenbean states that the lock to the Rich family vault is voice-activated by Richard and Regina. In the Bermuda Triangle, Richard manages to send out a distress code on his repaired Dadlink, but the signal is intercepted by Ferguson, who disconnects Richie's modem from the phone line and then informs Van Dough that Richie's parents are alive. After rescuing Keenbean from captivity, the children and Diane manage to sneak both Richie and Cadbury back into Rich Manor, only to discover that the Dadlink shows that Richie's parents are inside Rich Manor. He is shocked to discover that Van Dough had anticipated his own arrival, and had arranged for his parents' rescue. Held at gunpoint, Van Dough forces the Rich family elders to reveal the location of the Rich vault, while Ferguson and his partner take Richie and his friends to the molecular reorganizer. Once in the lab, Keenbean manages to subdue both Ferguson and his partner with the world's stickiest substance named , but ends up stuck as well; thinking cleverly, he uses a remote to power a robotic bee he created to sting Ferguson, causing him to crash into the machine's emergency off button, and thus saving Richie and the others. Van Dough is eventually led to Mount Richmore, a gigantic mountainside-sculpture of the three Rich members' heads where the vault is located. There, he is furious when he sees that the vault only holds the Rich family's most precious memories and keepsake treasures — nothing that is valuable monetarily; he then learns that the Rich family keeps their money in banks, the stock market, and real estate. Desperate to get the money, he attempts to shoot Richard and Regina, only for Richie to appear in the nick of time and interfere. Van Dough attempts to shoot Richie instead, but manages to barely faze him (because of a special spray of Professor Keenbean's which makes any fabric bulletproof). The Rich family manages to get away and the chase leads them down the side of the mountain, where they are under further attack by Ferguson and a rock-blasting laser that had originally been used to sculpt the mountain/vault. Cadbury finally succeeds in disarming Ferguson, while Van Dough ends up hanging upside down for dear life after Cadbury blasts away the rock-face near him with the laser. Although Richard has never fired any of his employees ever, he allows Richie to fired Van Dough, who is then subsequently punched by Regina. Later, Richie plays baseball with his new friends for the United Tool team on the Rich Manor's yard, with Cadbury as team coach and Keenbean as umpire. He hits a home run which is picked up by Van Dough, who is gardening with Ferguson as part of their work release and subsequently tosses the baseball into the fountain in humiliated resentment. Richard and Regina blissfully state that Richie now really is the richest boy in the world, as he has found the one thing that money cannot buy: friends.
