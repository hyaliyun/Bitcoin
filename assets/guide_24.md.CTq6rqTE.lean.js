Considered the first successful manhua magazine in China and one of the most influential, it was highly popular and inspired numerous imitators in Shanghai and the rest of China. Shanghai Manhua was known for its provocative cover art and the popular Mr. Wang comic strip by Ye Qianyu. History=Founding Zhang Guangyu: Degenerate, 23 Nov 1929 Among the artists who established Shanghai Manhua, several had worked together on the small, short-lived journal Sanri Huabao (Three Day Pictorial), including Ye Qianyu and the brothers Zhang Guangyu and Zhang Zhenyu. The journal was shut down when Chiang Kai-shek's Northern Expedition reached Shanghai in April 1927. Out of work, cartoonists Ye Qianyu, Huang Wennong, and Lu Shaofei published a dedicated publication for manhua named Shanghai Manhua (Shanghai Sketch). The first effort resembled a propaganda poster and was a failure. Undeterred, the original three, joined by eight more artists, including the Zhang brothers, Ding Song, and Wang Dunqing, formed the Shanghai Sketch Society (also translated as Shanghai Manhua Society) in the autumn of 1927. It was China's first association dedicated to manhua and a major event in the history of Chinese comics. Although the society had no formal structure, the two eldest and most established artists, Zhang Guangyu and Ding Song, were regarded as its leaders. The society was registered and often met at Ding Song's home on Rue Amiral Bayle (now South Huangpi Road). Under the leadership of Zhang Guangyu, who recruited sponsors including the wealthy poet Shao Xunmei, the association relaunched Shanghai Manhua on 21 April 1928. It proved very popular: about three thousand copies of each issue were printed, which was considered a large amount for the 1920s. Demise Lu Shaofei: Recent Empresses, from issue 15 (29 July 1928). Left to right: empresses of Shanghai's brothel district, movies, dance hall girls, prostitutes, and of the wives of physiognomists In 1930, a Singapore-based businessman made a proposal to Zhang Guangyu and Zhang Zhenyu for starting a new pictorial magazine to compete with the popular monthly The Young Companion (Liangyou). The Zhang brothers agreed, but several partners in charge of photography objected. As a result of the dispute, Shanghai Manhua was shut down in June 1930 after publishing 110 issues. The manhua team of the magazine moved with the Zhangs to the newly established Shidai (Epoch) Publishing Group, which went on to publish a series of magazines including Modern Sketch, the centerpiece of China's golden era of cartoon art. In May 1936 Zhang Guangyu re-established Shanghai Manhua, while many of the original members were then working with Modern Sketch. Together they organized the highly successful First National Cartoon Exhibition in September and formed the National Association of Chinese Cartoonists in the spring of 1937. The blossoming movement, however, was brought to a halt by the Japanese invasion a few months later. Format Huaisu: Fascination, cover of issue 8, 9 June 1928 Each issue of the magazine consists of eight pages including the front and back covers. The front cover featured its famously provocative cover art, and the back page carried Ye Qianyu's popular comic strip Mr. Wang, inspired by the American Bringing Up Father. Reflecting the tribulations of daily urban life, Mr. Wang became one of China's most famous cartoons. Pages four and five were dedicated to other cartoons from various artists, and the remaining four pages were flexibly given to manhua, photography, prose, reviews, etc. Influence In addition to members of the Shanghai Sketch Society, other famous artists and writers also contributed to Shanghai Manhua, including Shao Xunmei (Sinmay Zau), a wealthy and influential poet, writer, and publisher. His friend, artist and writer Ye Lingfeng, also became a staff member and regular contributor. Their photographs were frequently published in the magazine, with some taken by the famous photographer Lang Jingshan. Many of the images published in Shanghai Manhua reflect the daily urban life, while others are innovative visual commentaries on political events and contemporary society. The editorial staff of the magazine had close links to leading members of the decadent \\"neo-sensationist\\" school of the Shanghai literary scene. Influenced by ideas expressed in their writing, the artists produced startling images unparalleled in Republican-era China.

Biography = Education  In the 1970s, Tomov was a student at the UNWE and Leningrad University. He completed his primary, secondary and university education with excellent marks. In 1984, Tomov earned a doctoral degree in the field of economics. Tomov has made specializations in political science and macroeconomics in Sofia and London.  Academic career  In addition to his political career, Tomov has also worked as a professor and lecturer in the political science department (of which he is one of the founders in 1985) at Sofia University. He has further taught courses at the Karl Marx Institute of Economics in Sofia. Tomov has authored six books. In 1995, Tomov was appointed as the director of the EastWest Institute in New York City for a period of three years.  Politics  In 1990, Tomov was elected to the 7th Grand National Assembly of Bulgaria as a member of the Bulgarian Socialist Party. He was also a member of the 36th and 38th National Parliaments. Tomov served as Deputy-Prime Minister in the Dimitar Popov government, the first one since the collapse of the communist system in 1989. In 1993, he established the Citizens' Union for the Republic (Bulgarian: Гражданско обединение за републиката), which was initially not envisioned as a political party. However, it evolved into the Bulgarian Euro-Left in 1997. Tomov was formerly vice-chairman of the supreme council (Bulgarian: Висш съвет) of the Bulgarian Socialist Party and was among the founders of the Bulgarian Euro-Left in 1997, eventually being elected (and reelected in 2000) as its leader after receiving more votes than his main opponent Elena Poptodorova. The Euro-Left officially became a political party in 1998. He has been critical of the delayed social democratization of the BSP party in the 1990s. In 1996, Tomov was a candidate to become President of Bulgaria (with Lyudmil Marinchevski as his running mate) and finished in fourth place, earning 3.16% of the votes cast. Since 2003, Tomov has been the leader of the Bulgarian Social Democracy party. In 2013, his party expressed support for the \\"Bulgarian Spring\\" (Bulgarian: Българска пролет) protest movement.  Kremikovtzi AD  In 2009, Tomov came under legal scrutiny due to supposedly abusing his position during his time as chairman of the managerial board of Kremikovtzi. In early 2011, the Sofia City Court found Tomov guilty of allegedly siphoning off money (15 million leva) from Kremikovtzi, imposing a prison sentence. In 2013, the Appellate Court decided that the case needs a review and returned it to the court of first instance, with the trial recommencing in April 2014. In February 2015, the Sofia City Court declared Tomov not culpable.  Sport  Tomov is also well known for his involvement in various capacities with the CSKA Sofia football club. He was instrumental in bringing Indian businessman Pramod Mittal to Bulgaria in relation to a number of Kremikovtzi deals. Mittal eventually became the owner of the \\"armymen\\" in December 2006 before selling the club to Titan Sport EAD in early 2009. Tomov served as the president of CSKA Sofia between 5 December 2006 and 5 June 2008 as well as from July 2008 to 9 April 2009. In the summer of 2008, Tomov was blamed by some sections of the reds' supporters due to the team not receiving a license for European club competitions. In the summer of 2013, he was credited with playing a vital role in preventing the team's likely bankruptcy. Tomov was the main CSKA Sofia shareholder and de facto owner (with Lira Investment providing the main part of the financing) of the club between the second half of 2013 and April 2015. He has been against the idea of a deliberate declaration of insolvency and the creation of a new unofficial successor company as a solution to the debts accumulated by the club.  Personal life  Tomov has three children named Rada, Lidia and Alexander. His wife Kalina is an expert on psychology. Tomov's sister, Tatyana, is an academic at Sofia University whose area of expertise covers the social policies of European countries. One of Tomov's great-grandfathers perished in the April Uprising. In addition to his native Bulgarian, he is also conversant in English and Russian. In an interview with the press, Tomov identified drawing as one of his hobbies. Since February 2015, Tomov has a profile on Facebook.  Honours  Churchill award (1999) - for his contribution to the development of Bulgaria - United Kingdom relations.

Kim's early life was difficult as he was exposed to poverty, separation and death. His father died when Kim was fourteen and his stepmother, older, brother, and sister abandoned him. With his three half-sisters, Kim was forced onto the streets. In his work Cast-Away Lives (1988), he describes his hand-to-mouth existence as an A-frame carrier, bicycle car driver, movie extra, and worker in a town being demolished for urban renewal. He also sold his blood for money, and engaged in petty thievery, which resulted in his working as a laborer in a prison gang. Imprisonment, at age 16, came to Kim as a relief from the hardships of the outside world, as in prison he was fed, clothed, and allowed to read. In fact, Kim called prison “my classroom, my workroom.”\\"김신용\\" biographical PDF available at LTI Korea Library or online at: http://klti.or.kr/ke_04_03_011.do# Work Kim's poems record what life is like at the bottom of the social heap. But his poems contain nothing of the all- consuming rage at society or hostile enmity that one might expect from a poet with his background. Kim does not place blame for his life on capitalist society, its oppression of workers, or the contradictions in the social structure. His labor poetry does not possess an organizational or ideological character. Instead, it casts a sympathetic gaze on the difficult lives of those who have dropped to the lowest place in society, and embraces them warmly. These labor poems have little in common with antagonistic strikers on the picket line. Rather, they exist as small voices offering up consolation in whispered tones that reflect the experiences of the workers themselves. Even though his poetic subjects live in a world of poverty, neglect and lack of compassion, the poems hold out hope that love—in the truest sense of the word—can help these individuals form a community that belongs to them alone.Source-attribution\\"Kim Sinyong\\" LTI Korea Datasheet available at LTI Korea Library or online at: http://klti.or.kr/ke_04_03_011.do# As one critic summarized his work, he \\"continues to feel imaginary pains even after the disappearance of a painful life but endures them with aesthetic sorrow.\\" Kim won three literary awards in his career, the Cheon Sang-byeong Poetry Prize in 2005, and the Sowol Prize of Excellence and Long-Term Literature Prize (노작문학상) in 2006.

Engstrom served one term apiece in the Alaska House of Representatives and the Alaska Senate as a Republican during the 1960s, leaving in 1971. He was also a part of one of Alaska's longest-enduring political families; his father served in Alaska's territorial and state senates, his mother served in the territorial house, and his daughter, Cathy Muñoz was a member of the Alaska House from 2011 through January 16, 2017.

The synonym Endopiza viteana is frequently used in literature, but was replaced by Paralobesia viteana per J.W. Brown (2006). Description=Caterpillar Newly hatched larvae are about 1 mm long and creamy whiteUniversity of Minnesota or yellow-green in appearance. They turn purple as they mature and grow to a length of roughly 8 mm. Adult The wingspan of an adult Paralobesia viteana specimen ranges from 8 to 13 mm. The forewings are brown with a mild purplish sheen and a band in the middle of the wing,Oklahoma State University: Entomology and Plant Pathology - Grape Berry Moth factsheet with a wing pattern similar both to other Nearctic species of Paralobesia and to Lobesia botrana, with the latter unable to be separated from P. viteana on wing pattern alone.Tortricids of Agricultural Importance: Paralobesia viteana factsheet The lighter hindwings, which are more cream-colored, are folded beneath the forewings when in rest. The head and body of P. viteana are brown. Range and host plants Paralobesia viteana is native to Eastern North America, with wild grape as ancestral host plant. In recent times, it has also been observed in western Colorado. The primary host plant in both areas is grape (Vitis spp.), both wild and cultivated variations, though documentation of P. viteana on other host plants, including sassafras and blackberry, exists. Because of the damage done by the larvae when feeding from the grape berries and blossoms, P. viteana is considered to be one of the worst insect pests on grape berries in the Eastern North American bioregion.Ohio Agricultural Research and Development CenterMichigan State University Extension - North Central Region Grape Pest Management Strategic Plan, 2007 Behaviour Depending on weather and location, P. viteana occurs in two to four generations per year, with generations above a second being more common in the southern areas of its range but occasionally happening in the northern areas as well. The last generation overwinters in the pupal stage. Adults of the various generations of P. viteana are on wing from roughly March to August, depending on the weather and location. The adults of the first flight emerge, after overwintering, during spring around the time of grapevine bloom. The females lay the eggs of the first generation separately on flowers or small berries. After about four to eight days the eggs hatch. The first generation larvae feed on flowers, growing fruit clusters and tender stems from the outside, webbing the developing cluster together. As the caterpillars reach maturity, they leave the cluster to pupate by cutting part of a leaf and wrapping it around themselves to create a cocoon. Occasionally, they pupate within a webbed cluster. The later generations of larvae do not feed externally, but tunnel into the berries, feeding from within. This causes red spots on the grape berries at the point of entry. Grapes affected in such a way are known as \\"stung\\" berries. A single caterpillar may go through two to six berries before pupating. Although early larvae of the first generation may cause serious damage by feeding on the blossoms, buds and developing berries,New York State Integrated Pest Management Program the later generations often cause the majority of damage to the grape harvestTexas Winegrape Network by causing parts of berries to ripen early and hollowing out berries, both reducing yield and increasing the risk of fungal infection and infection by fruit flies. Larvae of the last generation overwinter in the pupal stage on the ground, in leaf litter.

History=Reorganisation Services in Kidderminster and Redditch have been under threat for many years. Proposals to downgrade Kidderminster hospital provoked the establishment of Independent Community and Health Concern. Their candidate Dr Richard Taylor defeated David Lock the sitting Labour MP in the 2001 general election. The building of the new Treatment Centre, in Kidderminster was handled by Durrow healthcare consultancy. In November 2013 further proposals to reduce services in Redditch were opposed by Redditch, Bromsgrove and Stratford councils who claimed \\"The removal of services from Redditch will leave what is already a vulnerable society, with the worst accessibility to health services in the region, and will introduce substantial inequalities with the populations of Redditch, Bromsgrove, Studley, Alcester and neighbouring areas being significantly worse off than all other areas in Worcestershire.\\" The trust is currently under the leadership of chief executive Matthew Hopkins who joined the trust during January 2019 and Sir David Nicholson KCB CBE who was appointed Chair of the trust in May 2018. In November 2018 it was announced that the Hereford and Worcester Fire and Rescue Service's community risk team would be running an enhanced hospital from home service to help discharge patients from the hospital in Redditch for six months. Facilities The Trust opened a new cancer treatment unit which has three linear accelerators in January 2015, a partnership with University Hospitals Coventry and Warwickshire NHS Trust, which it hopes will treat about 1,500 patients per year who previously had to travel for radiotherapy. It is also intended to extend the chemotherapy services available on the site. Performance In December 2013 the Trust had to cancel non-urgent operations and appointments due to increased pressure on their A&E; units. In April 2014 it was revealed that the Trust had mislaid up to 270,000 ultrasound scans which were stored on obsolete technology dating back to 2004. Andrew Brown, whose complaints led to this revelation had been labelled a ‘vexatious complainant’ after raising concerns about his treatment at Worcestershire Royal Hospital over several years. 2015 The Trust's former Chief Operating Officer, Stewart Messer, attempted to ban Stuart Gardner, a UNISON representative of the West Midlands Ambulance Service from Trust premises in January after he told the BBC about 18 patients being treated in corridors at the Worcester Royal Hospital. Messer claimed the staff were upset. The Trust later agreed with the union they did not have the authority to ban the paramedic from its premises and an apology was issued for suggesting he should be. Nurses at the Alexandra Hospital complained of serious bullying by their seniors.Nurses at Redditch's Alexandra Hospital 'reduced to tears' BBC News 6 February 2015 In February it was reported that four emergency consultants had resigned from the Woodrow Drive hospital and another emergency consultant had resigned from the Worcestershire Royal Hospital. Consequently, the future of the Alexandra Hospital Accident and Emergency department was in doubt.A&E; future in doubt as consultants quit Redditch Standard 13 February 2015 Their resignation letter accused “successive management decisions” of undermining services at the Alexandra, which they say has “led to the self-fulfilling prophecy of failing and unsustainable services” and that the proposed service model would be “neither an A&E; service nor a safe service”. In April, after a major incident at Worcestershire Royal Hospital, when seven patients had to be cared for in a corridor, Neal Stote, chairman of the Save the Alex campaign claimed that reconfiguration plans meant that \\"Worcestershire Acute Hospitals NHS Trust is trying to make us go to a hospital which is not only hard to get to but a hospital which, when you get there, is unable to cope.\\" The Care Quality Commission carried out an inspection of the trust's accident and emergency departments in March. They found numerous examples where patient safety was at risk. Medication was not given in a timely manner, patient notes were not up- to-date and there were \\"inadequate\\" security arrangements. In September Redditch and Bromsgrove Clinical Commissioning Group asked local GPs not to refer patients to the Trust over the next three months because it was unable to treat patients within 18 weeks of referral. Waiting times were out of control in ear, nose and throat, trauma and orthopedics, gynaecology, general surgery and dermatology. 2,347 patients had waited more than 18 weeks. 11 patients were infected after treatment at the Alexandra Hospital endoscopy unit, seven with Pseudomonas and four with Serratia. The machines for decontaminating endoscopes were more than eight years old and in need of replacement. The trust was put into special measures in December 2015 after a Care Quality Commission inspection in July. It was still rated inadequate in June 2017, and performance, particularly in emergency care, had deteriorated. 2016 The trust was singled out by the West Midlands Ambulance Service as one of two in the region responsible for the most serious delays in ambulance turn around times. 2017 Two patients died while waiting on hospital trolleys in corridors at Worcester Royal Hospital during the 2017 New Year period. Many other patients at Worcester Royal Hospital during the first week of January spoke of long waits, patients in corridors, overstretched staff doing their best. Similar problems are in other NHS hospitals.NHS faces 'humanitarian crisis' as demand rises, British Red Cross warns The Guardian A patient died from an overdose of DNP, which overworked medical staff failed to recognise in time.'Overwhelmed' hospital in Worcester missed DNP overdose BBC In December the trust diverted emergency patients away from the A&Es; at two hospitals, the Worcestershire Royal Hospital and the Alexandra Hospital in Redditch.Major NHS trust turns away A&E; patients 13 times in a week The Guardian During the winter the trust had to divert emergency patients elsewhere at least 65 times. 35% of patients with suspected cancer waited longer than two weeks to see a cancer specialist though 93% of patients should be seen within that time.Under-strain NHS fails to ensure cancer patients seen quickly enough The Guardian Four-hour target in the emergency department quarterly figures from NHS England Data from https://www.england.nhs.uk/statistics/statistical-work-areas/ae-waiting-times- and-activity/ In 2017-18 only 78.9% of A&E; patients were seen within four hours.The 10 worst A&Es; for waits revealed BBC 2018 Eight year old Callum Cartlidge died after Worcestershire Royal Hospital failed to do a blood test and misdiagnosed his condition.

If the illness had been identified the boy would have survived.Callum Cartlidge: Boy, 8, 'failed' by Worcestershire hospitaldate=4 May 2018 BBC The Carnall Farrar consultancy was engaged to review emergency care in the trust in January. They found that 700 patients a month were waiting more than 12 hours in the emergency department before being admitted or discharged, far more than the trust had reported. Waiting in corridors had \\"largely been normalised and accepted as standard practice” and ambulance handover delays were worsening. In September the trust announced that it needed 208 extra beds, increasing its current bed base by nearly a third, to reach a relatively safe occupancy level of 91%. Finance The trust performs about 95,000 planned and emergency operations each year, with 140,000 A&E; attendances and about 500,000 outpatient appointments. In September 2015 it predicted a deficit of £58 million against turnover of £364 million. It had been given a temporary working capital facility of £19m. The 30-year private finance initiative scheme at the Worcestershire Royal Hospital which runs until 2032 costs the trust about £13.6m a year. In February 2016 it was expecting a deficit of £65 million for the year 2015/6. In 2019 it rejected a proposal by NHS Improvement to achieve a £64.4 million deficit for 2019-20 and would only accept a target £73 million deficit, about the same as the result achieved in 2018-9. It has opened nearly 100 additional beds at a cost of about £22.5 million.

History  The league's inaugural schedule, as published in The Austin American on March 25, 1923 The league operated in 1923 with a six-team format. The Austin Rangers, Corsicana Oilers, Marlin Bathers, Mexia Gushers, Sherman Twins, and Waco Indians made up the league that year. While Mexia had the best win–loss record for the entire season, the league played a split season, with Sherman winning the first half, and Austin winning the second half. Sherman and Austin played a six-game playoff series, which ended in a tie at three games each. The Sherman squad did not return for 1924 and was replaced by the Temple Surgeons; all other teams returned. Corsicana finished in first place during both halves of the split season, thus no playoffs were held. For 1925, the Austin Rangers became the Austin Senators, while the Waco club did not return and was replaced by the Terrell Terrors; all other teams returned. On May 13, Marlin moved to Palestine to become the Palestine Pals. Corsicana again won both halves of a split season. Minor league legend Smead Jolley played for Corsicana that year, while 12-year major league veteran Boom-Boom Beck suited up for the Marlin/Palestine club. 1926 was the final year of the Texas Association, with all six teams returning from the previous year. Austin won the first half of the split season and Palestine won the second half. These two teams played a postseason series, won by Palestine, three games to none. No effort was made to bring the league back for 1927. Teams of three cities moved to the newly formed Lone Star League (Palestine, Mexia and Corsicana) while three others ceased operations (Austin, Terrell, and Temple).

GABA is a major inhibitory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system. Upon binding, it triggers the GABAA receptor to open its chloride channel to allow chloride ions into the neuron, making the cell hyperpolarized and less likely to fire. GABAA PAMs increase the effect of GABA by making the channel open more frequently or for longer periods. However, they have no effect if GABA or another agonist is not present. Unlike GABAA receptor agonists, GABAA PAMs do not bind at the same active site as the γ-Aminobutyric acid (GABA) neurotransmitter molecule: they affect the receptor by binding at a different site on the protein. This is called allosteric modulation. In psychopharmacology, GABAA receptor PAMs used as drugs have mainly sedative and anxiolytic effects. Examples of GABAA PAMs include alcohol (ethanol), benzodiazepines such as diazepam (Valium) and alprazolam (Xanax), Z-drugs such as zolpidem (Ambien) and the barbiturate drugs. History The GABAA receptors have historically been a target of drug treatment research. The earliest compounds were ions, such as bromide.  Barbiturates  In 1903, the first psychoactive derivative of barbituric acid was synthesized and marketed for headaches. Within 30 years, many other barbiturates were developed and found use as sedatives, sleep aids and general anesthetics. Although barbiturates fell out of favor, they continue to serve as a short- acting anesthetic and anti-epileptic drugs.  Benzodiazepines  Benzodiazepines were discovered in 1955 and largely replaced the barbiturates because of their larger therapeutic index. At first benzodiazepines were considered to be safe and efficient minor tranquilizers but then were criticized for their dependence producing effects. Several efficient benzodiazepines offer choices about dosage form, length of action, metabolic interaction and safety. Benzodiazepines function by binding to the benzodiazepine site on most, but not all, GABAA receptors. GABAA modulation by benzodiazepine site agonists is self-limiting. The channel conductance is not higher in the presence of benzodiazepine and GABA than the conductance with the presence of only high GABA concentrations. Additionally, in the absence of GABA the presence of benzodiazepines alone does not open the chloride channel. Certain metabolites of progesterone and deoxycorticosterone are potent and selective positive allosteric modulators of the γ-aminobutyric acid type A (GABAA) receptor. Hans Selye demonstrated in the 1940 that certain pregnane steroids could cause both anesthesia and sedation but 40 years later the molecular mechanism emerged to explain their depressant effect. In a rat brain slice preparation, the synthetic steroidal anesthetic alphaxalone (5α-pregnan-3α-ol-11,20 dione) enhanced both stimulus-evoked inhibition and the effects of exogenously applied muscimol which is a GABAA selective agonist. Receptor Fig 3. Binding sites of different therapeutic chemical groups on a GABAA receptor The GABAA receptors are made up of subunits which form a receptor complex. Humans have 19 receptor subunits and are classified into α (1–6), β (1–3), γ (1–3), δ, ε, π, θ, and ρ (1−3). The function of the receptor is different according to how the pentameric complex is put together. The most common complex that includes around 40% of the GABAA receptors is the α1β2γ2 combination. The expression of the subunits can be very different depending on brain region. The combination of the subunits influences how the receptor acts. For example, if the α1 and β2 subunits are expressed together they have high sensitivity to GABA, but low channel conductance. But if the γ2 is expressed with α1 and β2 the sensitivity is low and channel conductance is high. γ2 subunit has to be present for high affinity binding of benzodiazepine. Little is known about where different complexes are located in the brain, complicating drug discovery. For example, the binding site of neurosteroids in the GABAA receptor is not known and barbiturates bind at a beta subunit that is distinct from the benzodiazepine binding site. Available agents * Chloral hydrate (and related trichloroethanol prodrugs) * Barbiturates * Benzodiazepines * Nonbenzodiazepines (e.g., zaleplon, zolpidem, zopiclone) * Inhalational anesthetics (e.g., diethyl ether, halothane, isoflurane) * Etomidate * Propofol * Neurosteroids (e.g., brexanolone, alphaxalone (veterinary))  Applications = Barbiturates  Barbiturates' precise action sites have not yet been defined. The second and third transmembrane domains of the β subunit appear to be critical; binding may involve a pocket formed by β-subunit methionine 286 as well as α-subunit methionine 236. = Insomnia = Barbiturates were introduced as hypnotics for patients with schizophrenia. It induced a state of deep and prolonged sleep. But this was not used for long because of adverse side effects. = Anticonvulsant = Phenobarbital was the first truly effective drug against epilepsy. It was discovered by accident when given to epileptic patients to help them sleep. The positive side effects were anticonvulsant properties that reduced seizure number and intensity. = Sedation = Pentobarbital is used as a hypnotic when analgesia is not required. It´s often used in CT imaging when sedation is needed. It is efficient, safe and the recovery time is short. In 2013 the barbiturates phenobarbital and butabarbital are still used as sedatives in certain cases as well as to antagonize the effects of drugs as ephedrine and theophylline. Phenobarbital is used in cases of drug withdrawal syndromes. It is used as normal and emergency treatment in some cases of epilepsy. Fig 4. GABAergic synapse. The synaptic anchoring protein Gephyrin is indirectly linked to the GABAA receptors.  Benzodiazepine  Synaptic action of benzodiazepines: GABAA receptors located at synapses are activated when they are exposed to high concentration of GABA. Benzodiazepines enhance the receptor affinity for GABA by increasing the decay of spontaneous miniature inhibitory postsynaptic currents (mIPSC). = Analgesia = Sedative actions of benzodiazepines limit their usefulness as analgesic agents and they are therefore generally not considered to be appropriate. This limitation can be bypassed by intrathecal administration. GABAA receptors in the periaqueductal gray are pro-nociceptive at supraspinal sites while GABAA that are found in the spinal cord are anti-hyperalgesic. Spinal α2 and α3 containing GABAA receptors are responsible for the anti-hyperalgesic action of intrathecal diazepam. This was shown when the anti-hyperalgesic action was reduced when administered in α2 and α3 mice in inflammatory pain and in neuropathic pain. Additionally, studies in α5 mice showed that the spinal α5-containing GABAA receptor has a minor role in inflammatory pain. An α2, α3 and/or α5 selective positive allosteric agonist, like L-838,417 for example, might be useful as an analgesic drug against inflammatory or neuropathic pain. Further studies in animal neuropathic pain models have shown that stabilizing the Potassium Chloride Cotranspoter 2 (KCC2) at neuronal membranes could not only potentiate the L-838,417-induced analgesia but also rescue its analgesic potential at high doses, revealing a novel strategy for analgesia in pathological pain, by combined targeting of the appropriate GABAA receptor subtypes (i.e. α2, α3) and restoring Cl− homeostasis. = Schizophrenia = Benzodiazepines are used as a supporting treatment in patients with schizophrenia. = Depression = GABA ergic hypothesis for depression has been proposed. This hypothesis places the GABA system in a central role in the pathophysiology of depression and in addition to that clinical studies have shown that alprazolam and adinazolam have antidepressant activities in patients with major depressive disorder. Unfortunately we do not know which receptor subtype is responsible for the antidepressant activities. Studies in y2 knockout mice have shown that they display increased anxiety and depressive-like symptoms in despair based tests. The mice also had increased corticosterone concentration which is a symptom in major depression in humans. The y2 subunit is associated with α1-α6 subunits, which are all known α subunits, so these studies do not show which of the α subunits are related to the depressive like symptoms. Other studies with α2 knockout mice have displayed increased anxiety and depression-like symptoms in conflict based feeding tests and the fact that anxiety and depression are often linked seems to indicate that the α2 subunit might be a valid target for a GABAA antidepressant. = Stroke = Preclinical studies have shown that benzodiazepines can be effective in reducing the effect of strokes for up to three days after the drug has been administered.  Neurosteroids  Neurosteroids can act as allosteric modulators of neurotransmitter receptors, such as the GABAA, NMDA, and sigma receptors. The neurosteroid Progesterone (PROG) that activates progesterone receptors expressed in peripheral and central glial cells. Additionally it has been surmised that the 3α-hydroxy ring A-reduced pregnane steroids allopregnanolone and tetrahydrodeoxycorticosterone increase the GABA-mediated chloride currents while pregnenolone sulfate and dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) sulfate on the other hand display antagonistic properties at the GABAA receptors. Synthesis= Barbituric acid  Barbituric acid is the parent compound of barbiturate drugs although barbituric acid itself is not pharmacologically active. Barbiturates were synthesized in 1864 by Adolf von Baeyer by combining urea and malonic acid (Figure 5). A synthesis process was later developed and perfected by French chemist Edouard Grimaux in 1879, making possible the subsequent widespread development of barbiturate derivatives. Malonic acid was later replaced by diethyl malonate, as using the ester avoids the need to deal with the acidity of the carboxylic acid and its unreactive carboxylate (see figure 6). Barbituric acid can form a large variety of barbiturate drugs by using the Knoevenagel condensation reaction. Fig 7. Synthesis and discovery of chlordiazepoxide  Benzodiazepines  The structure that the first benzodiazepine is based on was discovered by Leo H. Sternbach. He thought the compound had a heptoxdiazine structure (Figure 7) but it was later determined to be a quinazoline-3-oxide. Possible drug candidates were then synthesized from that compound and screened for activity. One of these compounds was active, chlordiazepoxide. It was marketed in 1960 and became the first benzodiazepine drug.  Biosynthesis of neurosteroids  Neurosteroids are synthesized in the central nervous system (CNS) and the peripheral nervous system (PNS) from cholesterol and steroidal precursors that are imported from the peripheral sources. These sources include 3β-hydroxy-Δ5 derivatives, such as pregnenolone (PREG) and dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), their sulfates, and reduced metabolites such as the tetrahydro derivative of progesterone 3α-hydroxy-5α-pregnane-20-one (3α,5α-THPROG). After the local synthesis or from metabolism of adrenal of gonadal steroids many neurosteroids accumulate in the brain. Structure-activity relationship= Barbiturates  Fig 8. R-group position of Barbiturates Barbiturates have special uses and are organized into 4 classes: ultrashort-, short-, intermediate- and long-acting. Empirically SARs of barbiturants are based on thousands of (animal) tested compounds. They have shown that R and R´ may not be H in position 5 (see figure 8). Also, position 5 confer sedative-hypnotic properties. Generally alkyl branching in position 5 means less lipid solubility and less activity. Unsaturation show less activity in position 5 and alicyclic and aromatic rings show less potency. Polar substiuents (-NH2, -OH, -COOH) will decrease lipid solubility but it will also eliminate activity. R´´ in position 1 is usually, H but CH3 in that position yields less lipid solubility and duration. Exchanging S for O atom in position 2 produces thiobarbiturates, which are more lipid-soluble than the oxybarbiturates. In general, the more lipid- soluble the barbiturate, the more rapid its onset, the shorter its duration and the greater the degree of hypnotic activity. Barbiturates showed some hydrolytic problems in regard to formulation of liquid dosage forms. The difficulty is -OH catalyzed degration of the ureide rings but that can be fixed if the pH is 6 in the formulation. S(-) form of barbiturate have shown more depressant activity while the R(+) isomers have an excitatory effect.  Benzodiazepines  Fig 9. Common R group positions of Benzodiazepines According to research performed by Maddalena et al., using artificial neural networks, position 7 has the most effect on receptor affinity. When the active group in position 7 is made more lipophilic and the electronic charge is increased the receptor affinity increases. In the same study position 2´ was found to be the second-most important in affecting the affinity, but the group in that position needs to be electrophilic to have an effect. Positions 3, 6’ and 8 are of less importance. Changes to 6, 8, 9 or 4´ decrease activity. If the group in position 1 is changed to N-alkyl, haloalkyl, alkynyl and small cycle or aminoalkyl the activity is increased. Position 3 hydroxylation can cause rapid conjugation and decrease duration and potency, which can be clinically useful. Fig 10. Different R-group analogs for neurosteroids. Groups 1–4 and 10 have significant therapeutic value.  Neurosteroids  In the mid 1980s, the neuroactive steroids 3α,5α-tetrahydroprogesterone or allopregnanolone (3α,5α-THP) and 3α,5α-tetrahydrodeoxycorticosterone (3α,5α-THDOC) were shown to modulate neuronal excitability via their interaction with GABAA receptors. The steroids 3α,5α-THP and 3α,5α-THDOC were able to enhance the GABA-elicited Cl− current. In addition, these steroids might enhance the binding of muscimol and benzodiazepines to GABAA receptors. Structure- activity studies (SAR) showed that the 3alpha-OH group is essential for the anesthetic actions of these steroids, they also have an optimally- placed hydrogen bond accepting group on the β face of the steroid at the C-17 position. The four steroid rings form a rigid framework for positioning these hydrogen groups in three-dimensional space. Analogues 5 and 6 (Figure 10) are weak modulators of GABAA receptor function because the flexible side chains in these analogues do not have the conformations required for high biological activity.

The city's first tram line opened in 1872, but almost all of these historic lines had closed by 1971, being replaced by buses and by the expanding Barcelona Metro. The one remaining line, the Tramvia Blau, was retained as tourist attraction, utilising historic rolling stock. However at the beginning of the 21st century, two new tram systems, the Trambaix and Trambesòs, opened in the suburbs of the city. History The first tramway line in Barcelona was the Barcelona-Gràcia (Josepets), a horse tramway that opened by the Barcelona Tramways company on June 28, 1872. Within a few years, lines were built throughout Barcelona and many of its surrounding villages. As the tramways helped to integrate the metropolis, these villages became quarters of today's Barcelona. Lines were built by a number of companies, but by the 1900s the two main companies were Barcelona Tramways and Compañía General de Tranvías. Electrification took place in the 1900s, with the introduction of route numbers following from 1910 onwards. In 1925, the two main companies merged to Tranvías de Barcelona (TB). The Spanish Civil War (1936-9) caused major damage to the tramways. Services recovered in the 1950s and 1960s, and double-decker trams were used to operate some services. In the early 1960s, a fleet of 101 PCC cars were purchased second-hand from the United States city of Washington and, after modification, placed in service in Barcelona. However closures then started to happen. With the exception of the Tramvia Blau, the last two tramway lines operated on March 18, 1971. For the next thirty years or so, this one short line was the only tramway in Barcelona. Towards the end of the 1980s a number of new tramways were opened in other European cities, and Barcelona started to consider the possibility of building new lines. To test this idea, in 1997 a short test tramway was built along the Diagonal with just two tram stops. Tests were conducted with a tram from the Grenoble tram system in June 1997, and a month later with a Siemens Combino. The tests were successful, and the decision was made to build two new tram systems, both operating on parts of the Diagonal, although not interconnected. Both lines commenced operation in 2004, with TramBaix in the west starting on April 5, whilst Trambesòs in the east commenced on May 8. Current situation=Tramvia Blau Tramvia Blau The Tramvia Blau is a long heritage streetcar line serving a hilly area of the Sarrià-Sant Gervasi district. It links the Avinguda Tibidabo terminus of Barcelona Metro line L7 with the lower station of the Funicular del Tibidabo, thus providing part of a through link from the city centre to Tibidabo. Tramvia Blau is operated by Transports Metropolitans de Barcelona (TMB), albeit not part of Autoritat del Transport Metropolità (ATM) and therefore not fare-integrated with the other public transportation networks of the metropolitan area; ticketing is paid cash only to the tram operators. The line is operated with a fleet of seven tram cars dating from between 1901 and 1906. Trambaix Trambaix The Trambaix is a light rail (tram) system connecting the Baix Llobregat area with the city of Barcelona. It includes three routes (T1, T2 and T3), which have an inner terminus at Plaça Francesc Macià, to the west of the city centre, and extend west, passing L'Hospitalet de Llobregat, Esplugues de Llobregat, Cornellà de Llobregat, Sant Joan Despí, Sant Just Desvern and Consell Comarcal in Sant Feliu de Llobregat. The Trambaix is operated by the TramMet company and is part of the ATM network and is fare- integrated with the other public transportation networks of the metropolitan area. The line uses a fleet of Alstom Citadis trams. Trambesòs Trambesòs Trambesòs is a light rail (tram) system, consisting of three routes that connect the district of Sant Martí in Barcelona to Badalona and Sant Adrià de Besòs municipalities. Its name comes from the union of the words \\"tram\\", an abbreviation of the Catalan word tramvia, and \\"Besòs\\", the name of an area in northern Barcelonès dominated by river Besòs. Like the Trambaix, Trambesòs is operated by the TramMet company and is part of the ATM network and is fare- integrated with the other public transportation networks of the metropolitan area. It uses the same type of rolling stock as the Trambaix system.

Unlike most task management programs, Habitica takes the form of a role-playing game. Habitica is an open source project.  Concept  A screenshot of the gameplay of Habitica as of December 16, 2013. Habitica is a self-improvement web application with game mechanics overlaid in order to help the player keep track of and remain motivated to achieve their goals. The game is laid out in the form of an RPG, in which the player collects items such as gold and armor to become more powerful. Rewards are achieved through maintaining real-life goals, in the form of Habits, Dailies, and To-Dos.  Habits  In Habitica, Habits are long-term goals which are utilized to change a person's habits. These \\"Habits\\" can be set to either 'positive' or 'negative', or both. For example: * a pre-defined Habit can be \\"1h productive work\\". This is a positive Habit: if a user records an hour of productive work on the Habitica app, they will gain experience and gold. * a pre-defined Habit can be \\"Eat junk food\\". This is a negative Habit: if a user records eating junk food on the Habitica app, they will lose health. * a pre-defined Habit is \\"Take the stairs\\". This is a positive and a negative Habit: if a user does take the stairs, they will gain experience and gold. If they don't take the stairs, they will lose health. If a user completes a positive Habit often, it will turn green. This signifies that they are doing a good job following their Habit. On the other hand, if a user performs a negative Habit often, it will start to turn red and do increasing damage to their health. When players accrue enough experience points, they gain a level, which restores their health.  Dailies  Habitica uses Dailies to track habits that the user wants to complete in a known, scheduled, and repeatable fashion. Dailies are completed by ticking a check box: the user sets their Dailies in advance, and checks off what they have completed during their day. Completed Dailies give the user experience and gold; Dailies that fail to be completed by the end of the day result in a loss of health.  To-Dos  To-Dos are one-time tasks that can be added or deleted. When a user completes a To-Do, they gain experience. The To-Do then disappears (it can later be found under the 'Complete' To-Dos tab). Unlike Habits and Dailies, To-Dos will never cause the user to lose health: the To-Do just becomes more valuable over time (it gives more experience and gold once completed).  Role-playing aspect  A major part of Habitica is the role-playing aspect. A role-playing game (RPG) is one in which the player takes on the role of another person or character, and Habitica uses many genre conventions from this kind of game to motivate app users. In Habitica, the user takes control of a character that they design themselves, and by forming good habits and decreasing bad ones, the user can level up and unlock new features.  Character  The player can build their own character (also known as an avatar) using various customization options such as hair, skin color, and shirts. The armor and swords that a player buys when equipped also provide an attribute bonus. Some of the art in Habitica is sourced from BrowserQuest. The class system is another feature that adds complexity to the role-playing aspect of Habitica and increases the drive to form habits. Players can choose to make their avatar one of four character classes (Warrior, Mage, Rogue, or Healer), each of which has different skills, can wear different kinds of armor, and has different primary and secondary character attributes that affect gameplay.  Levels  Depending on how well a player completes their Habits, Dailies, and To-Dos, they either gain experience or lose health. When a player obtains enough experience, they gain a level, but losing all their health will cause their character to die and be set back a level. The higher the level the player is, the more features they have access to.  Currency  When a player completes a Habit, Daily, or To-Do, they gain Gold in some amount corresponding to the difficulty of the task. Gold can be used to buy rewards - which can either be user-defined, real life rewards, or else equipment that can give boosts in-game.  Pets and mounts  When checking off items, sometimes the player will receive an item. The items that can be found in Habitica are eggs, color potions, and food. The player can combine these to collect a set of 90 pets, which they can display beside their avatar, and 90 mounts, which their avatar can ride. Additional pets and mounts can be obtained during special events and by completing quests.  Social accountability  Players can band together in parties to complete quests. Players can also join guilds and participate in challenges made by other players, where the person with the most consistency in performing a task wins an achievement. Players can compete with friends and strangers, as well as collaborate and focus on accountability. In parties and guilds, as well as in the community-wide Tavern, players can communicate with one another via chat.  Seasonal events  There are four seasonal events called Grand Galas that happen each year in Habitica. Past Galas have involved new quests, special items such as limited edition equipment and avatar customization options, and bosses for the whole community to fight together. Other holidays, such as Valentine's Day and April Fools' Day, are also celebrated.  Mobile application  A screenshot of the Habitica Android mobile app. An official mobile application named Habitica is available for the Android and iOS operating systems. These mobile applications are replacements for the deprecated mobile apps named HabitRPG, which were released as promised after the $25,000 Kickstarter fund goal was reached.  Reception  In reviewing the site, Alan Henry wrote for Lifehacker that \\"while it doesn’t offer the advanced features that many other to-do apps have, it’s certainly a blast to use, and really addictive\\". Kelsey Adams wrote for CNET that Habitica (then known as HabitRPG) 'had [her] at RPG', and describes 'how much more compelling a game can be than reality to those of us whose brains are bent that way'.Adams, Kelsey (16 July 2014). \\"HabitRPG Helps You Win at Life and Zombie Cactuses.\\" CNET.com. Retrieved 31 May 2018.  History  Tyler Renelle originally created HabitRPG to help with his own habits, having been inspired by the self-help books The Power of Habit and The Now Habit. The earliest version of HabitRPG was a Google Docs spreadsheet with color-coded cell formulae.Orin, Andy (29 January 2015). \\"Behind the App: The Story of HabitRPG.\\" LifeHacker.com. Retrieved 31 May 2018. As the community of HabitRPG users grew, Renelle reached out to Siena Leslie and Vicky Hsu. Leslie and Hsu became cofounders of HabitRPG, Inc., which was formally incorporated as a company in 2014. On July 31, 2015, the website and apps were renamed to Habitica, after the land where players’ adventures take place. The change was made because some users found the name HabitRPG confusing or difficult to remember. The company name remained HabitRPG, Inc.  Community  In addition to participating in the website and apps’ social aspects, the community has been involved in helping with and improving Habitica.  Contributors  Community volunteers contribute to Habitica in various ways, such as by creating pixel art, translating text, creating music and sound effects, writing blog posts to promote Habitica, editing the wiki, resolving bugs, implementing new features, and answering new users’ questions.  Kickstarter  Starting on January 11, 2013, Renelle started a campaign on fund-raising site Kickstarter to improve development of the application with a goal of $25,000.

The geographic location of Santa Maria may be regarded favorable with respect to its relative distance from the National Capital Region (NCR) and the Provincial Capitol. Lying at the eastern portion of Bulacan, which is just 32 kilometers away from Manila. In terms of location relative to its neighboring towns, Santa Maria is bounded on the north by the municipalities of Angat and Pandi; portion of San Jose del Monte City on the south; Norzagaray and other portions of San Jose del Monte City on the east; and municipalities of Marilao and Bocaue on the western side.  Topography  The topography of Santa Maria is generally flat, however, it is hilly towards the north. This area covers the barangays of Silangan, Mag-asawang Sapa, Pulong Buhangin and some parts of Balasing with landscape ranging from 8 to 18 percent slope. The rest of the barangays have a slope range from level to undulating. Network of small rivers can be found all throughout the municipal territory. Flowing downstream from the north, these tributaries converge into the Santa Maria River. This river plays a vital role in the physical configuration of Santa Maria and adjacent towns of Norzagaray and San Jose del Monte City as it drains water from these areas.  Climate  Santa Maria has a climate “first type” which is defined as having two pronounced seasons: Dry from November to April and wet during the rest of the year. During the dry months, precipitation is less because of the prevailing easterly wind blow to produce rainfall in its leeward side. The Köppen climate system classifies Santa Maria climate as tropical monsoon (Am) due to its location and precipitation characteristics. This means that the municipality has two pronounced seasons: dry and wet seasons. Santa Maria's most perceptible months start from May and may have its maximum in August, which gradually decreases until December. During these most months, thunderstorms and rain showers causes precipitation in May and June while the rest is primarily due to the southeast monsoon that prevails on this particular part of the year. Others which occur in November and December are caused by tropical cyclones that pass through the area.  Temperature  The annual mean temperature in the area is . The warmest month is May with mean temperature of while the coldest is January at .  Relative humidity  The mean annual relative humidity in the area is 77%, which is under a normal condition. The mean monthly relative humidity is lowest in March at 64% and highest in September at 84%.  Ground water  The source of potable water of Santa Maria is purely dependent from its aquifer underneath it. Although the town is not rich in surface water, its ground water resources has sufficiently provide Santa Maria with their present requirement. Ground water in Santa Maria is essentially under shallow well areas, which means that fresh water can be easily found at a depth of about 20 meters below the ground surface. However, at present, potable water is sourced at 100 meters above. On the contrary, this finite resource has been badly contaminated by infiltration of sewage in some shallow wells at barangays San Jose Patag, Catmon, Pulong Buhangin, Santa Clara and Bagbaguin.  Soil = Soil suitability  The soils in Santa Maria is classified under three (3) categories namely soils of the Alluvial Landscape, soils of the Piedmont Landscape and soils of the Hilly Landscape. = Alluvial landscape = Soils range from clayey to fine clayey somewhat poorly to poorly drained deep soils. These soils are principally grown to paddy rice and can be used for fishpond during rainy season. This landscape is composed of two (2) minor landform units as follows: ::1. River terraces and levees – Narrow river terraces are topographic surfaces, which mark former valley floor levels and resulting from seasonal stream. The levels are elevated landforms slightly above the narrow river terraces. Some areas are subject to slight to moderate seasonal flooding in some years. ::2. Low Alluvial terraces and depressions – It consists of the slightly dissected broad low alluvial terraces depressions and narrow alluvial valleys. Moreover, soil series of the Alluvial Landscape consists of the Batia and Tagulod Series. Both series has low to adequate organic matter content and inherent fertility. However, Batia Series can be found on a relative steeper slopes covering the barangays of Lalakhan, Bagbaguin and Santa Clara. Tagulod Series on the other hand, covers the barangays of Manggahan, Caysio, Caypombo, Camangyanan, Tumana and Parada which is regarded to be generally utilized under rice production during wet season. = Piedmont landscape = It consists of gently undulating to rolling tuffaceous and sedimentary foot slopes slightly above and adjacent to the plain and free from local flooding hazard. This landscape, however, is composed of two soils series namely the Pulong Buhangin Series and Maysan Series. Pulong Buhangin Series has deficient organic matter content and high to moderate inherent fertility. This is principally utilized for paddy rice and built-up areas. Non-irrigated paddy rice constitutes the principal crop during wet season. These soils are left fallowed during dry season due to lack of irrigation and rainfall. These areas can be found in the central to upper portion of Santa Maria. Meanwhile, the Maysan series consists of very gently sloping to gently undulating shallow moderately drained soils that is formed on degraded tuffaceous sandstone footslopes. This series is mainly utilized for paddy ricefields during wet season and generally left idle during dry season = Hilly landscape = These soils are primarily in rolling sedimentary hills. The drainage is good with low to medium natural fertility. These areas can be found at barangays Pulong Buhangin, Mag-asawang Sapa, Balasing, Bulac, San Vicente and Guyong. These soils are primarily under pasture grass. Some cultivated areas are grown to diversified cropping.  Soil fertility = Soil pH  Soil pH measures the level of acidity of the soil – the lower the pH, the more acidic the soil. Most parts of Santa Maria are medium acidic ranging from 5.6 to 6.0 pH. Includes the barangays of Silangan, Mag-asawang Sapa, Caypombo, Caysio, Manggahan, Santa Cruz, Poblacion, Guyong, Balasing, Bulac, Catmon, San Gabriel, San Vicente, Camangyanan and Buenavista. The barangays of Pulong Buhangin, Santa Clara, Lalakhan, Tumana and Parada are strongly acidic ranging 5.1 to 5.5 pH and slightly acidic for the barangay of San Jose Patag ranging from 6.1 to 6.5 pH.  Available phosphorus  Most parts of Santa Maria are low in phosphorus ranging from 0 ppm to 9 ppm. It includes the barangays of Silangan, Mag-asawang Sapa, Caypombo, Caysio, Manggahan, Santa Cruz, Santa Clara, Lalakhan, Poblacion, Guyong, Balasing, Bulac, San Jose Patag, Tumana, San Gabriel, Parada and San Vicente. Other barangays such as Pulong Buhangin, Camangyanan and Buenavista are medium in phosphorus ranging from 9.0 ppm to 20.0 ppm.  Available potassium  Most parts of Santa Maria are sufficient in Potassium ranging from 100 ppm and above. It includes the barangays of Mag- asawang Sapa, Santa Clara, Poblacion, Guyong, Balasing, Bulac, San Jose Patag, Parada, San Vicente, Camangyanan and Buenavista. However, Silangan, Caypombo, Caysio, Manggahan, Santa Cruz, Tumana, San Gabriel and Pulong Buhangin are deficient in Potassium ranging from 0 ppm to 100 ppm.  Geology  Guadalupe Formation is the major underlying geological structure present in the territory of the municipality of Santa Maria. This is made up of two formations namely Alat Conglomerate and Diliman Tuff. Alat Conglomerate is characterized by its consolidated pebbles, gravel or boulder beds composition. While Diliman Tuff is generally made up of an almost flat-lying sequence of vitric tuffs and welded volcanic breccias with subordinate amounts of tuffaceous, fine- to medium-grained sandstone. Based on this makeup, the whole area of Santa Maria is regarded to be very suitable to hold structures necessary for urban development.  Ground shaking  The primary hazard or danger that can be brought by an earthquake is the effect of ground shaking. Buildings or properties can be damaged by the shaking itself or by the ground beneath them settling to a different level than it was before the earthquake. Santa Maria is fortunate to be free from fault lines. The nearest fault line is found at San Jose del Monte City which is just 17 kilometers away from its city proper. However, ground shaking can still be experienced by the town which can pose hazard to properties. Using the Rapid Earthquake Damage Assessment System (REDAS), the planning team was able to simulate the effect of ground shaking at Santa Maria if the nearest fault line located at San Jose del Monte City would move at magnitude 7 and 5 meter depth earthquake. The side effect is estimated to incur slight damage.

During the conflict the entire Division was deployed to Aleppo in March 1980, and garrisoned the city for an entire year. Patrick Seale wrote on how the division had \\"a tank in almost every street.” Seale also wrote of an incident where General Fayadh stood on the turret of a tank and proclaimed that “he was prepared to kill a thousand men a day to rid the city of the vermin of the Muslim Brothers.”Joseph Halliday, The Syrian Army: Doctrinal Order of Battle, Institute for the Study of War, February 2013, p.10 The division was also used in the Government assault on Hama, with the division's 47th Armoured and 21st Mechanized Brigades providing the backbone of the assault. Muslim Brotherhood reports following the uprising suggested that three quarters of the officers, and a third of the soldiers of these brigades were Alawites. 1984 coup attempt The division, under Fayadh, also played a key role in blocking an attempted coup in 1984 by Rifaat al-Assad. The 3rd Division, along with Ali Haydar's Special Forces and the Republican Guard, engaged with Rifaat's Defence Companies in Damascus. While the Special Forces deployed anti-Tank platoons on the streets of Damascus to confront Rifaat's armoured columns and surrounded Rifaat's bases with snipers, Fayadh's armoured forces provided the armoured back-up and firepower to completely insulate Damascus from the outside, so that Defense Company units outside of Damascus ( in Lebanon and further north) could not come inside Damascus, and the 30,000 or so of Rifaat's forces within the environs of Damascus were effectively trapped. Role in the civil war Human Rights Watch accused the division of involvement in the suppression of protests at the beginning of the Syrian Civil War. Specifically, the division was alleged to have been involved in the violent suppression of protests in Douma“By All Means Necessary” - Individual and Command Responsibility for Crimes against Humanity in Syria, Human Rights Watch, 2011, p.22 and Daraa“By All Means Necessary” - Individual and Command Responsibility for Crimes against Humanity in Syria, Human Rights Watch, 2011, p.36 in April 2011. In Douma, the division was allegedly involved in arbitrary arrests, the looting of homes, and the shooting of unarmed protesters.

They had a son named Santiago, whose godmother was Rosa Ascázubi, the first lady of Ecuador (married to President Gabriel Garcia Moreno). Veintimilla, her husband, and son moved to Guayaquil where they were accepted by high society with open arms. She committed suicide on May 23, 1857 in Cuenca. Literary works Her notable prose includes “Fantasía” (Fantasy) and “Recuerdos” (Recollections), in which she dialogues with the past and blames time for giving an early death to her dreams. She best expressed her pain in her poetry, which includes “Aspiración” (Aspiration), “Desencanto” (Disenchantment), “Anhelo” (Yearning), “Sufrimiento” (Suffering), “La noche y mi dolor” (The Night and My Pain), “Quejas” (Complaints), “A mis enemigos” (To My Enemies), “A un Reloj” (To a Clock) and “A mi madre” (To My Mother). Her literary style is characterized by rhythmic and musical verse, and she hardly made use of metaphors or imagery in her poetry.Escritores Ecuatorianos (List of Ecuadorian writers and biographies in Spanish)  References  Category:1829 births Category:1857 deaths Category:Ecuadorian women writers Category:Ecuadorian poets Category:People from Quito Category:Ecuadorian women poets Category:19th-century poets Category:19th-century women writers Category:19th-century Ecuadorian people Category:Poets who committed suicide Category:Suicides in Ecuador Category:Female suicides Category:19th-century Ecuadorian women Category:19th-century Ecuadorian writers Category:19th- century Ecuadorian women writers ","title":"Dolores Veintimilla"},{"id":"41069854","text":"FAIR Girls (formerly FAIR Fund) is an anti-human-trafficking organization, founded in 2003 and headquartered in Washington, D.C..

The community is situated along Pockwock Road and is considered one of the most historic communities for Black Nova Scotians. There were 330 residents who identified themselves as having black ancestry in the 2006 census. The community is named after the Governor of Nova Scotia Sir Andrew Hamond, 1st Baronet. Its border is defined by the Government of Nova Scotia and it is adjacent to Hammonds Plains in the east and south, Upper Tantallon in the south, Head of St. Margarets Bay and Mount Uniacke in the west, and Mount Uniacke and Upper Sackville in the north. History Upper Hammonds Plains was originally established in 1815 as a settlement area for Black Refugees from the War of 1812 when a group of 500 refugees moved to the area immediately north of the then 34-year-old logging and farming community Hammonds Plains. \\"As with most Blacks forced to live on the outskirts of more thriving areas, they were faced with great hardships. In 1821, 95 of these Black settlers left for Trinidad. Most, however stayed under horrible living conditions and numerous obstacles, rising above their circumstances to carve out an honest living for themselves.\\" \\"Land and water expropriation has been a major issue in the community since municipal and provincial governments began looking to the Upper Hammonds Plains area for land around 1974. This resulted in the expropriation of Pockwock Lake to supply water for the city of Halifax, the town of Bedford, and Halifax County. The expropriated land would house the Halifax regional water commission’s water treatment plant. The community was offered $100,000 for the land – much less than what it was actually worth. Moreover, although the water main lines passed through the community’s backyards, there was no offer of water service made to the community. In 1987 Rev. Willard Clayton raised the issue of the need for water service and compensation, citing that the community lost use of its sustainable resource of fishing, as well as recreational swimming and Sunday morning baptisms, among other things. Hammonds Plains is now connected the city’s water system.\\" Community infrastructure \\"Rev. John Burton (or 'Father Burton') was the first to provide pastoral services to the community. He established the Hammonds Plains Second Baptist Church in 1822. In 1832, the legendary Rev. Richard Preston (founder of the African United Baptist Association) established the Hammonds Plains Baptist Church. In 1839, the two churches joined - the unified church was referred to as Emmanuel Baptist Church.\\" The current building housing Emmanuel Baptist Church was built in 1845 and has served the community continuously since that time, having undergone a significant expansion in 2005. The Pockwock Lake reservoir is the primary water supply for Halifax. A water treatment plant and pipeline in the community are operated by Halifax Water, a commission of the Halifax Regional Municipality. Madeline Symonds School is named after Upper Hammonds Plains resident Madeline Symonds, the first Black teacher to graduate from the Provincial Normal School in Truro.

G. Grace Memorial Gates in 2012 The right pair of gates in 2012 The Grace Gates, officially the W. G. Grace Memorial Gates, are two pairs of gates on St John's Wood Road at Lord's Cricket Ground in London, England. They were erected in 1923 and the gates with their flanking walls and piers became a Grade II listed building in 1996.  Design  The Grace Gates were designed by architect Sir Herbert Baker as a tribute to English cricketer W. G. Grace, who had died in 1915. They replaced an earlier, less decorative, entrance to the ground. Baker also designed the old Lord's Grandstand, which was demolished in 1996. The gates are made of cast iron and bear motifs of a cricket ball and the sun's rays, and the initials of the Marylebone Cricket Club. They are set within the south exterior wall of Lord's on St John's Wood Road, within a curved recess (or exedra) of Portland stone, which also contains a door to either side for pedestrian access. The two pairs of gates are separated from each other by a pillar made of Portland stone, topped by a stone carving of three stumps and urn, with a further pillar to either side, also topped by a stone urn. On the centre pillar is a carved wreath with the initials WGG, and the engraved inscription TO THE MEMORY OF WILLIAM GILBERT GRACE THE GREAT CRICKETER: 1848–1915: THESE GATES WERE ERECTED: THE MCC AND OTHER FRIENDS AND ADMIRERS. The inscription was a matter of some debate, with various suggestions made in English, Latin and Greek. Sir Stanley Jackson suggested including \\"The Great Cricketer\\" in the design.  History  The Grace Gates were officially opened by Sir Stanley Jackson at a ceremony in 1923. They are located close to the west end of the Tavern Stand, and are the main entrance to Lord's for MCC members, who often queue outside the gates hours before Lord's opens on the day of a Test match to get a good seat in the Lord's Pavilion. The \\"Toffs and Toughs\\" photograph, of two boys in Harrow School uniform and three others in the plain clothes of pre-war working class youths, was taken outside the Grace Gates in July 1937. A protest was held outside the Grace Gates in 1970, opposing the 1969–70 South Africa rugby union tour of Britain and Ireland because of South Africa's apartheid policies. The Grace Gates were listed in 1996. In 2006, there was discussion in the MCC about possibly removing the Grace Gates to another part of Lord's. This was discussed after consideration of the MCC's planned redevelopment of Lord's with the Grosvenor Group and because the gates were being constantly damaged by supply lorries turning in the vicinity of the gates. However the MCC members voted against moving the gates. In 2013, as part of a revised redevelopment of Lord's, it was announced that a new entrance would be built into Lord's to supersede the Grace Gates as the entrance for MCC members. The gates themselves would be locked for three years while the pavilion end is redeveloped.

Related deaths and damage in the United States were widespread and extensive. While the exact number is not certain, flood- related deaths in Ohio, Indiana, and eleven other states are estimated at approximately 650. The official death toll range for Ohio falls between 422 and 470. Flood-related death estimates in Indiana range from 100 to 200. More than a quarter million people were left homeless. The death toll from the flood of 1913 places it second to the Johnstown Flood of 1889 as one of the deadliest floods in the United States. The flood remains Ohio's largest weather disaster. In the Midwest damage estimates exceeded a third of a billion dollars. Damage from the Great Dayton Flood at Dayton, Ohio, exceeded $73 million. Indiana’s damages were estimated at $25 million (in 1913 dollars). Further south, along the Mississippi River, damages exceeded $200 million. Devastation from the flood of 1913 and later floods along the Mississippi River eventually changed the country's management of its waterways and increased federal support for comprehensive flood prevention and funding for flood control projects. The Ohio Conservancy Act, which was signed by the governor of Ohio in 1914, became a model for other states to follow. The act allowed for the establishment of conservancy districts with the authority to implement flood control projects. The storm system that produced the flood in late March 1913 began with a typical winter storm pattern, but developed characteristics that promoted heavy precipitation. Strong Canadian winds stalled a high-pressure system off Bermuda and delayed the normal easterly flow of a low-pressure system. In the meantime, moist air from the Gulf of Mexico moved into the Midwest through the Mississippi River valley as a second Canadian high-pressure system arrived from the west, creating a low-pressure trough that stretched from southern Illinois, across central Indiana, and into northern Ohio. At least two low-pressure systems moving along the trough caused heavy rain over the four-day period between March 23 and March 26. As the storm gained strength on Sunday, March 23, high winds, hail, sleet, and tornadoes arrived in the Great Plains, the South, and the Midwest. Major tornadoes hit Omaha, Nebraska; Lone Peach, Arkansas; and Terre Haute, Indiana. On Monday and Tuesday, March 24 and 25, of rain fell in Ohio, Indiana, and southern Illinois. Major rivers in Indiana and Ohio experienced heavy runoff. Downstream, where the Ohio River enters the Mississippi River, the water level broke record highs to that time as the water flowed south to the Gulf of Mexico. By Tuesday, March 25, the Ohio River and its tributaries flooded cities such as Indianapolis, Indiana, and Cincinnati, Youngstown, and Columbus, Ohio. Dayton, Ohio, was particularly hard-hit. On Wednesday, March 26, the storm moved east into Pennsylvania and New York, while heavy rain continued in the Ohio River valley. The heaviest rainfall, or more, covered an area from southern Illinois into northwestern Pennsylvania. As the storm continued eastward, flooding began in New York, Massachusetts, Vermont, and Virginia. The Potomac River overflowed its banks in Maryland. State and local communities handled much of their own disaster response and relief in 1913. The American Red Cross, a small organization at that time, focused its efforts in more than one hundred of Ohio's hardest-hit communities, including Dayton, and served six of Indiana’s hardest-hit counties. Ohio governor James M. Cox called on the state legislature to appropriate $250,000 (about $11 million in today's dollars) for emergency aid. Indiana governor Samuel M. Ralston appealed to Indiana cities and other states for relief assistance. Many communities cared for their own flood victims with Red Cross assistance, charitable donations, and contributions from local businesses, industries, and service organizations. Affected areas The storms that created the floods in 1913 continued over several days and produced record-breaking rain. It remains Ohio's \\"largest weather disaster\\" and triggered Indiana's worst flood on record. Storm-related flooding affected more than a dozen states: Alabama, Arkansas, Connecticut, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Massachusetts, Mississippi, Missouri, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Vermont, and Virginia. The same weather system caused major tornadoes in the Great Plains, the South, and the Midwest, most notably in Omaha, Nebraska; Lone Peach, Arkansas; and Terre Haute, Indiana. Dayton, Ohio Ludlow Street in Dayton, Ohio The Great Flood in Hamilton, Ohio Between March 23 and 25 heavy rains and rising waters from the Great Miami River burst levees on Dayton's south side and flooded of the city. Dayton's downtown streets experienced water deep. On March 26, as floodwaters reached their crest, Dayton's business district suffered more damage after an early morning fire and gas explosion. An estimated 123 people were killed in Dayton. Downstream in nearby Hamilton, Ohio, about 100 people died after water deep flowed into its residential neighborhoods. Columbus, Ohio In Columbus, the Near West Side and parts of downtown experienced severe floods. Approximately 93 people died in the flooding. The event was described by historian Ed Lentz as \\"the worst catastrophe in the history of Columbus\\".https://www.dispatch.com/entertainmentlife/20190209/review--the- flood-operas-simultaneous-action-and-multiple-time-periods-dampens-dramatic- flow Indianapolis, Indiana alt=A bridge collapse Approximately of rain fell on Indianapolis over the period of March 23 through March 26, inundating nearly a area and causing five known deaths. Unconfirmed deaths numbered as many as twenty-five. See Bodenhamer and Barrows, p. 582. On March 26 floodwaters estimated at above flood stage destroyed Indianapolis's Washington Street bridge, the main connection over the White River. High water forced 4,000 to flee their homes on the city's near west side when an earthen levee failed and a wall of water flooded an area nearly a wide around Kentucky Avenue and Morris Street.Williams, p. 172. The city's transportation and water supply were disrupted for nearly four days in flooded areas and as many as 7,000 Indianapolis families lost their homes. Contributing factors=Weather The weather pattern that triggered heavy rains over the Midwest began after strong Canadian winds stalled a high-pressure system off Bermuda and delayed the normal easterly flow of a low-pressure system. As moist air from the Gulf of Mexico moved into the Midwest through the Mississippi River valley, a second Canadian high-pressure system arrived from the west and squeezed the low into a trough that stretched from southern Illinois, across central Indiana, and into northern Ohio. At least two low-pressure systems moving in quick succession along the trough dumped one rainstorm after another. The weather pattern changed little over the four-day period of March 23 through March 26 and caused heavy rain over the Ohio River valley. The heaviest rainfall, or more, covered an area from southern Illinois into northwestern Pennsylvania.The area covered approximately and included a population of approximately five million based on the 1910 census. See Louisville, Kentucky, experienced the storm’s heaviest recorded rainfall rate of in twenty-eight minutes on March 25. Other factors contributing to the extensive flooding were the storm's size, its duration, and existing ground conditions. Rivers and streams affected by the flood were at near normal or below flood stage levels two days prior to the major flooding in Indiana and Ohio. Some experts argue that the ground may have become quickly saturated, resulting in runoff and flash flooding. Others have suggested that frozen ground in tributary watersheds may have contributed to the flooding along the rivers. Up to of snow followed the heavy rain in northern Indiana. In some areas thawed ground and a lack of snowpack may have minimized the destruction from runoff and flooding. Watersheds Rivers rose several feet above previous high-water marks in Ohio and Indiana after heavy rains at the headwaters of the region’s rivers moved downstream. The area's rivers experienced heavy runoff, especially along the Muskingum, Scioto, Great Miami, and Wabash rivers. The Scioto River basin in central Ohio recorded a flood level of , which remains a record of nearly higher than its other recorded floods. The Great Miami River and its tributaries, including the Whitewater River in Indiana, rose at least higher than previous flood levels in many locations. Downstream from Indiana and Ohio, where the Ohio River enters the Mississippi River at Cairo, Illinois, the water level reached and broke record highs to that time. High waters continued to flow south to the Gulf of Mexico, causing some levees to fail in Arkansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Missouri. Water from flood-crested rivers flowing into the Mississippi River in April set new height records downriverBell, \\"Forgotten Waters\\", Traces of Indiana and Midwestern History, p. 6. and caused cities such as Memphis, Tennessee; Natchez, Mississippi; New Orleans, Louisiana; and elsewhere along the Mississippi to prepare for flooding.Williams, p. 283. Timeline The storm system that produced the flood in late March began with a typical winter storm pattern, but soon developed special characteristics that promoted heavy precipitation. Friday, March 21 * A series of nine tornadoes associated with the same weather system that produced the flood sweeps through the Gulf States of Alabama, Georgia, and Mississippi, leveling towns, killing 48 people, and injuring 150. * A blizzard hits twenty states and kills 21 people.Williams, p. 5. * Temperatures drop below freezing in the Midwest, while hurricane-force winds move into Ontario, Canada.Bell, \\"Forgotten Waters\\", Traces of Indiana and Midwestern History, p. 7 and 9. Record-setting winds reach in Indianapolis, Indiana; in Louisville, Kentucky; in Toledo, Ohio; in Detroit, Michigan; and in Buffalo, New York. Saturday, March 22 * Ice begins to melt and winds die down.Bell, \\"Forgotten Waters\\", Traces of Indiana and Midwestern History, p. 9. Sunday, March 23 * The storm gains strength. High winds and sleet in the Midwest topple buildings, telephone and telegraph poles, and overhead wires, disrupting electric services and severely limiting communications within the Midwest and with areas west of the Mississippi River. * The storm keeps the U.S. Weather Bureau from collecting timely information about the weather system and communicating weather warnings in advance of the storm. * A high-pressure system moves northeast over New England and a low-pressure system is over Colorado. Southerly winds increase between the two systems as warm and moist air enters the Great Plains and the Ohio River valley. * Gusty winds produce a dust storm in Kansas, while Missouri is hit with hail and heavy rain, and a series of funnel clouds move across Nebraska, Iowa, Illinois, Missouri, Michigan, and Indiana. The number of tornadoes range from six to twelve, but at least six strike the Midwest, killing approximately 221 people and injuring 761.Williams, p. 23-24. * Major tornadoes hit Omaha, Nebraska. The event ranks as Nebraska’s deadliest.Williams, p. viii. A tornado hits Terre Haute, Indiana, that same evening.Batic and Giacomelli, p. 6. * The storm moves into Michigan. * Winds of , gusting up to , are reported in Nebraska, Iowa, and Illinois. Monday, March 24 * The first low-pressure system from the storm weakens and moves northeast from the Great Lakes into eastern Canada and New England. * The system stalls over the Ohio River basin and triggers more rain and thunderstorms. * A second low-pressure system that developed in Colorado merges with a third low that forms over western Texas. * Overnight the first storm system moves eastward over Kentucky, while the second system enters southern Indiana and Illinois and merges with a stationary front over the Ohio River valley. * Rainfall totals from Sunday through Monday, March 23 and 24, measure in Ohio, Indiana, and southern Illinois, surpassing the normal monthly rainfall totals in less than forty-eight hours. Rain continues, averaging in southern Indiana and western Ohio. * Flooding moves into central Indiana. Waterways are at or near crest along the Wabash River from Logansport to Attica, the White River in the Indianapolis area, and the East Fork of the White River near Columbus and Seymour, Indiana. Eastern Indiana floods after the Maumee, Whitewater, and upper portions of the Wabash and White Rivers reach record high water levels. * Heavy rain falls at Dayton, where the Great Miami River reaches a high stage for the year and continues to rise.

Other communities such as Cumberland, Maryland, feel the effects of the floods, which cause damage but no deaths.Williams, p. 282. Relief efforts In the immediate aftermath of the floods businesses and factories shut down, schools closed, government services were disrupted, and train travel was delayed or stopped throughout the Midwest. Newspapers in many communities were not published during the storm. Theaters around the country were showing pictures of the flood devastation in Dayton and other Ohio cities and tornado damage in Omaha, Nebraska, within weeks after the disaster.Williams, p. 123-24 and 213. In 1913, years before the federal government provided significant disaster relief, state and local communities handled their own disaster response and relief.Batic and Giacomelli, p. 11. Cleanup efforts were made even more difficult with increased fire and health risks, flood-damaged communications systems, disrupted transportation networks, debris-littered streets, and flooded utility systems.Bell, \\"Forgotten Waters\\", Traces of Indiana and Midwestern History, p. 13. The American Red Cross was still a small organization in March 1913, with a few full-time employees at its headquarters in Washington, D.C. and about sixty volunteer chapters in the United States, when President Woodrow Wilson named it \\"the official disaster-relief agency for the federal government\\".Williams, p. 203-4. Flood reports in the country's newspapers carried an appeal from the president to help victims with contributions to the Red Cross. Wilson also sent telegrams to the governors of Ohio and Indiana asking how the federal government might help. Indiana governor Samuel M. Ralston did not receive President Wilson's telegram offering federal support due to flood-damaged communications.Williams, p. 204 and 208. Ohio governor James M. Cox replied to the president with a request for tents, rations, supplies, and physicians and sent a telegram to the Red Cross requesting its assistance in Dayton and surrounding communities. Red Cross agents and nurses focused their efforts in 112 of Ohio's hardest-hit communities, which included Dayton, primarily along Ohio's major rivers. The Red Cross had less of a presence in Indiana, where it established a temporary headquarters in Indianapolis and served the six hardest-hit Indiana counties. Red Cross disaster relief in other regions of the United States, with the exception of Omaha, Nebraska, and Lower Peach Tree, Alabama, was limited or nonexistent. Governor Cox called on the Ohio legislature to appropriate $250,000 (about $11 million in today's dollars) for emergency aid and declared a 10-day bank holiday. Cox, who was also the publisher of the Dayton Daily News, provided the press with daily briefings and appeals for donations. Governor Ralston appealed to Indiana cities and other states for relief assistance and donations of money and supplies. Ralson appointed a trustee to receive relief funds and arrange for distribution of supplies. Approximately one-half of Indiana's counties cared for their own flood victims. Railroads, most notably \\"the Big Four, the Pennsylvania Lines, and the Vandalia,\\" put their equipment at the Indiana governor's disposal and had work crews rebuild the state's rail network. The Chicago Association of Commerce wired $100,000 to the Red Cross on March 26, becoming one of many organizations that contributed funds for flood relief.Williams, p. 236. Rotary clubs across the United States contributed more than $25,000 (half a million in today's dollars) to a Rotary Relief Fund, which was established for flood relief in Indiana and Ohio. It was the organization's \\"first cooperative disaster relief effort.\\" In some areas independent local organizations helped with relief efforts. The Rotary Club of Indianapolis, chartered just a few weeks before the flood, and the Rotary Club of Dayton, chartered six months earlier, assisted relief efforts within their communities by helping to provide medical support, transportation, and shelter. Other Rotary clubs in the United States and Canada donated funds, supplies, and medicine. In Colorado stage actress Sarah Bernhardt and fellow actor John Drew, Jr. gave a benefit performance that contributed $5,000 to a $41,000 relief fund already raised by Colorado residents for Indiana and Ohio flood victims.Williams, p. 313. Deaths The exact death toll from the flood and its aftermath may never be known.Williams, p. 306. One estimate of storm-related deaths from March 21 to March 28 is more than 900. Flood deaths in Ohio, Indiana, and eleven other states (Arkansas, Illinois, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Michigan, Missouri, New York, Pennsylvania, West Virginia, and Wisconsin)Williams, p. xi. is estimated at approximately 650.The total number of deaths as a result of tornadoes between March 21 through March 23 are estimated at 249. The tornadoes at Omaha, Nebraska, on March 23 left 103 dead. Eight other tornadoes associated with the storm killed eighty-nine more in Nebraska, Iowa, Louisiana, and Missouri. See Bell, \\"Forgotten Waters\\", Traces of Indiana and Midwestern History, p. 13, and Deaths from windstorms that swept the eastern U.S. on March 21 numbered at least sixty-six across eleven states: Arkansas, Illinois, Louisiana, Michigan, Mississippi, Missouri, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, and West Virginia. See Approximately 450 died from drowning along the Mississippi River. See This death toll places the flood of 1913 second to the Johnstown flood of 1889, when more than 2,200 people died, as one of the country's deadliest floods.Williams, p. ix. Official reports of flood deaths are inconsistent. The bodies of some of the victims were never found and not all fatalities were reported to agencies collecting flood statistics. Some disaster-related deaths from injuries or illness were not listed in official counts if they occurred after publication of official reports.Bodies were recovered down the Ohio and Mississippi rivers weeks after the flood, but without the means to link missing persons from the flood to the unidentified bodies, the total body count remains incomplete. See An estimate of 467 flood deaths has been quoted for Ohio, with the official death toll range between 422 and 470. Dayton's official death toll was not certain, but Ohio's Bureau of Statistics listed eighty-two people, while one flood historian puts the number at ninety-eight. Others reported Dayton's death toll at nearly 300, but this figure may have included other neighborhoods and cities.Williams, p. 303. Estimated deaths for flood victims in Indiana is 100 to 200. Flooding in the Great Miami River basin caused at least 260 deaths, more than in any other river basin. Approximately seventeen people died in flooding in the Whitewater River basin. Disease related to the flood Secondary to the flood itself, there were outbreaks of diphtheria and typhus in several flooded areas, such as the area in north-central Dayton, Ohio. It is likely that roughly 2000 additional hospitalizations were the result of these outbreaks, following the more directly physical damage of the flood. Although information for Indiana is not presently available, estimates are that an additional 1000 people were effected in that state. Damage estimates Damage in Miamisburg, Ohio after the flood. Damage from the flood was widespread and extensive. The storm destroyed hundreds of bridges and railroad trestles and 12,000 telegraph and telephone poles. Flooding stopped communications between Chicago and New York for a day and a half, disrupted road and rail transportation, and slowed mail delivery. More than 38,000 homes and other buildings, plus thousands of schools, businesses, utilities, and city streets were damaged or destroyed. More than a quarter million people were left homeless.Bell, \\"Forgotten Waters\\", Traces of Indiana and Midwestern History, p. 6-7. In the Midwest alone, damage estimates, which one flood historian suggests were understated, were more than \\"a third of a billion dollars.\\"Bell, \\"Forgotten Waters\\", Traces of Indiana and Midwestern History, p. 7. The Dayton Citizens' Relief Committee's report documented damage in Dayton in excess of $73 million. Damage in Indiana was estimated at $25 million in 1913 dollars. Cairo, Illinois, where its citizens had advance knowledge of the oncoming high water that arrived the week after the Dayton flood, reported no fatalities, but damage estimates there and in smaller communities such as Shawneetown, Illinois, and Caseyville, Kentucky, was in excess of $5 million. Along the Mississippi River damages exceeded $200 million. Impact Devastation from the flood of 1913 and later floods along the Mississippi River in 1917, 1927, 1936, and 1937, eventually changed the country’s management of its waterways and increased congressional support beyond emergency flood assistance to include national flood control measures.Williams, p. vii and viii. Federal legislation Following the flood of 1913, citizens and government officials took a greater interest in comprehensive flood prevention, managing flood-prone areas, and funding for flood control projects that would limit damage and save lives. Congress previously contended that floods were local events and flood control was the responsibility of state and local government. The Flood Control Act of 1917 was the first of several pieces of legislation that eventually led to the creation of the National Flood Insurance Program of 1968, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) in 1979, and the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act of 1988. Federal funding for national flood control projects began slowly in 1917, with Congress authorizing funding for flood control studies in the Mississippi River as part of House Document 308. By 1925 it had been expanded to include other major rivers in the United States. State and local programs The Dayton Relief Committee began shortly after the flood of 1913 to raise $2 million to develop a comprehensive flood protection system that would prevent another flood disaster of the same magnitude. The committee hired Arthur Ernest Morgan and his Morgan Engineering Company from Tennessee to design a plan that used levees and dams. On March 17, 1914, the governor of Ohio signed the Ohio Conservancy Act, which allowed for the establishment of conservancy districts with the authority to implement flood control projects. Ohio's Upper Scioto Conservancy District was the first to form in February 1915. The Miami Conservancy District (MCD), which includes Dayton and surrounding communities, was the second, formed in June 1915. The MCD began construction of their flood control system in 1918. The project was completed in 1922 at a cost in excess of $32 million and has kept Dayton from flooding as significantly as it did in 1913. The Ohio Conservancy Act became the model for other states, such as Indiana, New Mexico, and Colorado.

Navielektro develops, manufactures and provides maintenance for a range of various radar and related sensors and communication equipment.  History  Navielektro was founded by Asser Koivisto in 1987. The company originally began as a three person endeavor, selling and installing navigation systems onboard vessels. The operations eventually expanded to include installations of ship bridges. In the mid 1990s, the company branched out to surveillance sensors and software, as the focus shifted from providing on-board navigational systems to developing sensors, maritime surveillance systems and vessel traffic management systems for control centers. The first radar manufactured by Navielektro was developed in 1994, and the company has continued to produce their own line of antennas and sensors ever since. In 1996, Navielektro signed a contract with the Finnish Maritime Administration (now the Finnish Transport Agency) to help establish a VTS system for the Archipelago Sea. From this point onwards, the company began to focus mainly on development, maintenance and delivery of situational awareness systems. By the early 2000s, the entire coast of Finland was covered by VTS delivered by Navielektro. Navielektro co- operated with the main Swedish actors in the field of AIS system technology, resulting in the development of the first system in the world fusing AIS and radar tracks. Collaboration with the Finnish Maritime Administration, the Southwestern Maritime District and the Finnish Defense Forces made it possible to realize this innovation in Finland, making the Finnish VTS system the first in the world to incorporate AIS, providing interaction between the VTS system and vessels. Navielektro’s operations further expanded to include general situational awareness services and related software in the year 2000. In May 2004, the Swedish Saab TransponderTech announced the company would be partnering with Navielektro to promote products for the VTS and coastal surveillance systems market. Navielektro and Saab TransponderTech teamed up to offer VTMS and Coastal Surveillance Systems for maritime administrations and port authorities worldwide for several years. Since the year 2000 and onwards, Navielektro has provideded the Finnish Border Guard and the Finnish Navy with command, control, communications and surveillance platforms.  Deliveries  Navielektro is the leading supplier of VTS, Coastal Surveillance and Situational Awareness Systems for the Coast of Finland. The majority of the radars currently in operation along the Finnish coast have been provided by Navielektro, replacing FIKA-radars from the 1970s. All of the Finnish agencies engaging in coastal surveillance (such as the Finnish Transport Agency, the Finnish Border Guard and the Finnish Navy) utilize radars and situational awareness systems manufactured by Navielektro. The VTMS and Coastal Surveillance System that Navielektro designed and delivered for the Finnish trilateral METO agencies is one of the largest and most sophisticated of its kind in the world. In 2011, Navielektro and Eltel signed a contract with Ghana Maritime Authority to supply and install a Vessel Traffic Management Information System to ensure electronic surveillance and monitoring of the coast of Ghana. Navielektro provided the technology, while Eltel implemented telecommunication and homeland security solutions. The system was inaugurated on April 29, 2014, and integrates several sub-systems like radar control, automatic identification, radio data, CCTV and area control centers. Navielektro actively participates in the development of situational awareness systems as part of joint operations with ITU, IALA and NATO.  Projects  Navielektro has actively participated in the following projects: * HELCOM (Helsinki Commission, First International AIS data-sharing tests in the late 1990s) * GOFREP (Gulf of Finland Tri National Reporting System) * METO (Finnish Maritime Tri Lateral Co-Operation) * SUCFIS (Sweden-Finland, Military Sea Surveillance Co-Operation) * SUCBAS (Baltic Sea Surveillance Co-Operation) * MARSUR (Maritime Surveillance) * ENSI (Enhanced Navigation Support Information) Service  Products and Services  Navielektro offers a wide range of different solutions for surveillance and communication for both civilian and military customers. The company provides naval and military tactical information systems as well as systems for maritime surveillance (integrating VTS and AIS information in the RMP), intelligent transport, voice communication and weather information. Navielektro also manufactures radar sensors and transceivers.

Samuel Evans et alJames Traub, New York, 8 February 1987, The Katzenjammer Falcon) was a US trial in the 1980s relating to the attempted shipment of $2.5bn worth of US- made arms to Iran; it was described by the Los Angeles Times in 1986 as \\"the largest arms conspiracy prosecution ever brought by the Justice Department\\". The case (with indictments in May 1986, following a four-month investigation) was dropped in January 1989 after the prosecution said it could not prove the defendants did not believe their dealings were officially sanctioned. The planned deals were being arranged at the same time as the White House was secretly seeking to arrange arms sales to Iran, in what became known as the Iran-Contra affair; some evidence indicated that defendants were aware of these efforts. Overview In December 1985, the case began when Iranian banker Cyrus Hashemi approached US Customs with a deal. Hashemi, described by Assistant Treasury Secretary John M. Walker, Jr. as a \\"major figure in international arms trafficking\\", had been indicted in July 1984 over arms dealing with Iran, and sought leniency in exchange for cooperation. The US agreed to drop the charges against Hashemi in exchange for his cooperation.Los Angeles Times, 4 August 1988, Iran Arms Dealers May Use Secret CIA Links as Defense Hashemi said he had been approached in late 1985 by Samuel Evans, an advisor to Saudi arms dealer Adnan Khashoggi, leading to US Customs setting up a sting operation. The four-month investigation, costing over $100,000, led to arrests in April 1986 in New York and Bermuda, with the involvement of Special Agent Joseph F. King. Evans was recorded by US Customs saying that he had received assurances of \\"full and complete cooperation\\" from Israeli officials, and was expecting to discuss the matter with Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin on his next trip.Douglas Frantz, Chicago Tribune, 3 August 1986, Tapes Implicate Israel In Arms Deal In April 1986, 17 suspects were indicted in the case, accused of planning to use false end-user certificates to bypass the US arms embargo against Iran. Three suspects were named as retired Israeli general Avraham Bar-Am, William Northrop, and Samuel Evans. The deal was said to involve over 100 aircraft, as well as tanks and missiles.Arnold H. Lubasch, The New York Times, 23 April 1985, 17 ARE CHARGED IN A PLOT TO SELL WEAPONS TO IRAN Tanks were promised by Bar-Am, who said they were Soviet tanks captured from the Syrian Army in 1973. Indictments were issued on 5 May 1986. According to Victor Ostrovsky's The Other Side of Deception, a contact at Mossad asked Ostrovsky to call Bar-Am on 8 April 1986 and tell him that the deal had been approved. Ostrovsky said he made the call, knowing that Bar-Am was walking into a trap - his contact had told him that Bar-Am's contact had been \\"turned\\" by the FBI.Victor Ostrovsky, The Other Side of Deception, Chapter 12 Evans' lawyer later told the court that Evans had first been introduced to Hashemi by Roy Furmark, a close friend of Central Intelligence Agency Director William Casey, in January 1985.Jewish Telegraphic Agency, 29 January 1987, Some Defendants in the Arms to Iran Case Allowed to Return to Their Home Countries, but Israelis Den Furmark was alleged to have repeatedly assured Evans that according to Casey the US approved of supplying arms to Iran. Northrop sought Casey's telephone logs, claiming to have spoken with Casey on a monthly basis since 1981 and that Casey knew of and approved of the deals. Testifying to Congress, Casey stated Furmark told him in October 1986 about the possible diversion of funds from arms sales to Iran.Bob Drogin, Los Angeles Times, 17 December 1986, Warned Casey 3 Times on Iran Funds, Furmark Says : Businessman Claims He Got Middlemen Together One of the defendants met with US Ambassador Maxwell M. Rabb in Rome, and was recorded telling Hashemi that he was waiting for Rabb to confirm official approval (Rabb later admitted the meeting but denied discussing the arms deal). An arms dealer with a diplomatic passport, John Delaroque, not indicted, assured Hashemi on 7 February 1986 that the matter had gone as far as the Vice President.Stuart Diamond, The New York Times, 29 November 1986, U.S. EMPLOYED A 'STING' SETUP FOR ARMS TO IRANJohn J.

Elected to Croydon Local Board, he was one of the main proponents of the incorporation of Croydon as a borough, and was one of the first members of the town council, elected an alderman, following the granting of a charter in 1883. He was subsequently a justice of the peace for the borough. He was also a member of Croydon School Board. He was also a temperance activist as a leading member of the Band of Hope.

It currently houses The Minories Galleries which are run by Colchester School of Art, part of Colchester Institute.  Early history  The house is believed to have been built in the Tudor period. In 1731 it was purchased by the baize manufacturer Isaac Boggis for £420. His son, Thomas Boggis, inherited the house, and employed an architect, probably John Alefounder (1732–1787) to remodel the building, turning parts of it into an elegant Georgian residence. The Boggis family lived in the house for almost 200 years. From 1821 to 1915 the building had several owners and tenants, one of whom was Dr. Becker, a general practitioner (GP) whose son, Harry Becker, lived there for a time while he learned his trade as a landscape painter and went on to become one of East Anglia's best known artists. In 1915 Geoffrey Crawford Bensusan-Butt and his wife Dr. Ruth Crawford took over the lease, purchasing the property along with a portion of land that included the Gothic Folly, a summer house built in 1830. Crawford later had three exhibitions of his artwork shown at the Minories in 1962, 1964 and 1975. Dr. Ruth Crawford was the sister-in-law of the painter Lucien Pissarro, and was one of the first female GPs in Colchester. She used the front rooms of The Minories as her consulting rooms, and also opened Colchester's first infant nursery there. One of the Bensusan-Butt's three children was the English economist, David Bensusan-Butt.  The Victor Batte-Lay Trust  The Gothic Folly in the Minories' garden In 1956 Dr. Ruth, who had survived her husband, sold The Minories along with the garden to the Victor Batte-Lay Trust, named after the art collector who had been a hereditary freeman of the town. The trust was set up by Batte-Lay's window, Margaret, to purchase and endow a building in Colchester as a memorial to her husband. From 1963 to 1974 R. A. Bevan was chair of the Victor Batte-Lay Trust. The Minories was sold on the strict condition that it would continue to be used for artistic purposes. The Victor Batte-Lay Trust has provided a public cultural and artistic centre for Colchester and North-East Essex. No. 73, the house next door to The Minories, was purchased and added in 1975 with funding from Eastern Arts and the support of local professionals. The Minories, run by the Trust as The Minories Art Gallery, presented work by Edward Bawden, Leon Underwood, Eric Ravilious, Harry Becker, John Bratby, John and Paul Nash, Lucien Pissarro, Cedric Morris, Christopher Wood, Bill Brandt, Maggi Hambling, Jacob Epstein and Mark Wallinger. By the early 1990s the Trust's resources were significantly reduced, and the gallery closed in 1992, leading to a period of uncertainty. It reopened in 1994 when Firstsite took on the lease and continued to pay some of the Trust's obligations.  The Victor Batte-Lay Trust Collection  Upon her death in 1955, Margaret Batte-Lay bequeathed her husband's collection of art objects to \\"the people of Colchester … in particular those who shall take an interest in the artistic and antiquarian features of that town\\".Art for Colchester: The 20th century collecting practices of the Victor Batte-Lay Trust [exhibition catalogue] Exhibited at The Minories Galleries, Colchester 22 September -20 October 2012. The initial collection held works mainly by British artists, including still lives from the 17th century, regency portraiture, 18th century prints and drawings and 19th century oil paintings and samplers.http://www.vblfcollection.org.uk/about-us/ This collection was first displayed on the ground floor of The Minories Gallery in an imitation of the original domestic setting together with new acquisitions which included antique clocks and chandeliers that highlighted Batte-Lay’s discerning taste in art and antiques. By the end of the decade, the Trustees had acquired new works through purchases, loans and gifts with the intention to expand the Permanent Collection. By the 1960s, as the collection grew via purchases and the occasional gift, it also took on a more modern direction in order to attract new and younger audiences. Works acquired during this period varied in style but the strength of the collection lay in its possession of prints by several British modernists most notably, John Nash, Paul Nash and Blair Hughes-Stanton as well as 14 figure drawings by Camille Pissarro. The acquisition and subsequent sale of Robert Bevan’s The Cab Yard in the 1970s paved the way for the purchase of the adjacent property as a new exhibiting space, which became known as The Girling Room. As a result, the Contemporary Art Society gifted generously to the collection with works such as Margaret Mellis' Lilac Yellow and Ian McKeever's Sand and Sea Series No. 8. The Victor Batte-Lay Trust then developed a policy of acquiring work by 20th century artists preferably with strong regional links. In the early 1980s, the team at The Minories was the recipient of a sizeable amount of funding from charitable organisations and Friends of The Minories which led to the setting up of an official purchasing policy. The collection expanded again through new purchases, most significantly the team established a sculpture collection. During this period, there was also a Permanent Collection room that exhibited a selection of works on rotation. By the mid-1980s the collection faced a sudden change in funding circumstances. In order to stay afloat, several works were sold off and those acquired by Colchester Borough Council stayed in the local area. At present, the Victor Batte Lay collection consists of 135 acquisitions by renowned British and international artists.Art UK They are not on permanent display but a selection of the Victor Batte-Lay art collection can be viewed in temporary exhibitions at Colchester’s Firstsite and on loan in regional and national institutions.http://www.vblfcollection.org.uk/about- us/#history  Current use  Installation view of Keith Albarn's exhibition, Pattern and Belief at The Minories Galleries In early 2008 Firstsite left The Minories and moved into Crouch Street while their new building was developed, and in June 2008 Colchester Institute took on the lease for the Minories. The site is currently home to The Minories Galleries, a contemporary art gallery run by Colchester School of Art which is open to the public and houses the Colchester School of Art's Postgraduate programmes and a café surrounded by a walled garden. The Minories is next door to Firstsite, Colchester’s contemporary art space, in the centre of St Botolph's Quarter. Since being run by Colchester School of Art and Colchester Institute, The Minories has presented exhibitions by artists and designers including Joseph Robinson, Abram Games, Romek Marber, Noel Myles, Keith Albarn (father of Blur frontman Damon) and Chris Meigh-Andrews. In October 2015, the cafe and tearoom in the back of the venue was taken over by Wilkin & Sons and is now operated as the Batte-Lay Tearoom, whilst the gallery space remains under previous management.  The Friends of The Minories  The Friends of the Minories is an organisation which supports the gallery and assists in its funding. About four or five events occur each year, generally visits to local places of interest. The revenue from these fund-raising events goes into maintaining the garden and its 18th-century Gothic Folly. The garden and Folly are both registered with the Essex Gardens Trust.

Clockhammer soon gained a local following, opening for such bands as Firehose, DC3, and Meat Puppets. After an altercation between Nagle and Swanson in the summer of 1988, Nagle left to finish college and the band continued as a trio. In the early 1990s the trio's music became popular in the college radio scene and many predicted Clockhammer would be a breakthrough success. Bailey's guitar playing reached a plateau by the time the debut album was recorded, evident in the intro to the song \\"Extra Crispy.\\" The lyrics to songs like \\"Sun Goes Black\\" show an artistic edge over most jazz metal at the time. Bailey's guitar playing would draw large crowds at Nashville's Exit/In, which was \\"the place\\" for alternative music in the Music City.

When Bailey left the group in the middle of a tour that year, the trio was finished. Re-formation (1992-1995) Bailey and Nagle went on to re-form Clockhammer in 1993, with Mark Smoot (bass), and Chris Gallo (drums). Nagle and Smoot had played together in the short-lived project Chainsaw Jazz, and Smoot and Gallo in the group Jaws of Life. This last version of Clockhammer produced only one album, So Much For You on the German label Houses in Motion and it was never released in the US. The label-dictated list of songs was not entirely to the band's liking, and as family, money, management, and other concerns loomed, the group amicably disbanded in 1995. Influences Byron Bailey was reportedly influenced by the likes of King Crimson and Cream. Post-Clockhammer projects Ken Coomer recorded and was a member of Wilco and went on to produce several projects, including, Latin sensation Chetes, Son's Of Bill, Will Hoge and more. and Swanson with My Dad Is Dead and Lambchop. Nagle was a founding member of the Japanese band, Illuminati, and is now a teacher and author in Tokyo, Japan. Bailey played drums and bass for the short-lived Portland, Oregon band, Vista Bridge. He now teaches English in Poquoson, VA. Smoot continues to record and perform music in the Washington, D.C. area.

A. Sysas has been promoting social dialogue, but it has not been among priorities of Lithuanian governments, even leftist. # On social insurance. 'If we want to have more people joining the national social insurance system, we have to guarantee higher social benefits from the fund. On the other hand, fixed ceiling is not acceptable'. # Effective tax rates. Sysas is the proponent of progressive tax system which would apply to all income and wealth. He argues that it has been a mistake of a number of Lithuanian governments and the non- existent progressive tax has damaged the idea of solidarity in the society, added to the divide and social exclusion as well as huge emigration to countries of progressive taxation (UK, Ireland, Norway, Germany, etc.). 'Progressive taxation characterises society where social justice is prevalent. Harsh criticism of progressive tax is the sign of envy. It is common in some societies which still live in culture of poverty (Dickensian), where people tend to be narrow-minded and of low social intelligence. Societies, where people fear that those living in poverty might be living better at some point'. # On Nuclear Power Station in Lithuania. 'I can only speak for myself - I do not want nuclear power plant. I support the majority who said „No to the power plant“ in the referendum. In case we decide to go against this decision, we need to hold referendum again. Judging from what is happening around, what the electricity needs are, what technologies exist, we have already incurred losses. Neighboring countries are building two nuclear power plants which implies that there will be enough electricity in the region and it will be possible to buy it on the market.http://www.alfa.lt/straipsnis/15078874/Sysas..as.atsakau.uz.save..nenoriu.atomines.elektrines=2013-02-06_09-25/%7D%7D ReferencesExternal links * Personal website * Biography on Lithuanian Parliament website * News portal Delfi Category:Politicians from Vilnius Category:Social Democratic Party of Lithuania politicians Category:Members of the Seimas Category:Vilnius University alumni Category:1954 births Category:Living people Category:Lithuanian orienteers Category:Male orienteers Category:21st-century Lithuanian politicians ","title":"Algirdas Sysas"},{"id":"41070588","text":"Rear Admiral Edward Courtney \\"Ted\\" Thorne, (29 October 1923 – 23 October 2013) was a senior Royal New Zealand Navy officer.

Sinai Holiness Church of Deliverance is the current occupant of 52 Cooper St., Charleston, South Carolina. The Emma Abbott Memorial Chapel is a late Victorian church located at 52 Cooper St., Charleston, South Carolina. On October 4, 1890, the Citadel Square Baptist Church bought a parcel at the northwest corner of Cooper and America Streets for the construction of a mission church serving the Eastside. The land was marshy and had to be filled at a cost of $1500. In January 1891, Citadel Square Baptist Church learned that it had been named as one of several beneficiaries of the estate of Emma Abbott, a popular opera singer. She had attended church at Citadel Square Baptist Church during trips to Charleston in 1880, 1886, and February 1888. Abbott left the church $5,000, but because of New York probate laws, the gift could not be released until January 1892. In the meantime, the church began foundation work for the new church. The church hired Richmond, Virginia architect S.H. Foulk to design their new mission. The work was performed by John Murphy for $4,000; he finished the work in December 1892. The cost of the building had been higher than expected, and the steeple was not built. A two- story entrance tower appears to have been a later addition. The church was designed in the Romanesque Revival style and has broad gables with shingles, narrow weatherboard siding, and large round-topped openings. The interior is executed largely in wood.

They were designed with the purpose of laying small minefields and transporting naval special forces, with or without their submersibles, in shallow waters that were inaccessible for larger submarines. Due to their mission profile that called for a small design as well as the need to stay undetected, they lacked torpedo armament and a generator for battery recharging. During the Croatian War of Independence and the dissolution of SFR Yugoslavia, five of the six boats were relocated to Boka Kotorska where they served with the SR Yugoslav Navy. One, Soča (P-914), was captured in drydock by Croatian forces. It was later modified and entered service with the Croatian Navy as . All of the boats have since been decommissioned.  Development  During the 1970s the Brodarski Institute (BI) from Zagreb started working on a new class of submarines for the Yugoslav Navy (JRM). The project, designated B-91 and led by Lieutenant Colonel Davorin Kajić, was tasked with developing a class of midget submarines capable of operating in the shallow waters of the northern Adriatic. Using their small dimensions, the submarines were to be able to maneuver in depths as shallow as ; such abilities were needed to conduct offensive minelaying near the enemy coastline, reconnaissance, and transporting naval special forces in hostile waters. All six boats were completed from 1985 to 1989 at the Brodogradilište Specijalnih Objekata (BSO) in Split, SR Croatia and named after rivers in SFR Yugoslavia: Tisa (P-911), Una (P-912), Zeta (P-913), Soča (P-914), Kupa (P-915) and Vardar (P-916). Further planned improvements included the addition of a Stirling engine, either by refitting the existing boats or building a new, seventh one, but the imminent breakup of Yugoslavia happened before anything was realized.  Description  Interior of Zeta (P-913) after renovation The Una-class featured a single-hulled design, measuring in length with an average draught of . The boats displaced when surfaced and when submerged. Because deploying naval commandos was one of their main tasks, they were equipped with an underwater exit/re-entry chamber. Propulsion consisted of two electric motors, mounted on a single shaft and powered by two battery groups with 128 cells each. The class lacked the ability to recharge during surface drive making them dependent on external power sources such as harbours and depot ships. Maximum achievable speed was underwater and surfaced. Traveling at a speed of they had a range of . Maximum diving depth was . The sensor suite included an active/passive Krupp Atlas sonar. In accordance with their expected mission, the boats could transport up to six naval commandos armed with 6-12 M-66 or M-71 limpet mines. Also at their disposal were four large AIM-70/71 bottom mines mounted on the outside of the submarines. Four R-1 swimmer delivery vehicles could be carried in place of the AIM-70/71 mines. With a full crew of six members the boats had an underwater endurance of 160 hours which was reduced to 96 hours if the complement numbered ten personnel (four crew members and six naval commandos).

Due to modifications carried out by the Croatians after the war, Velebit is longer than other Una- class boats All six boats were in service with the 88th submarine flotilla of the JRM with Lora Naval Base being their homeport. At the start of the Croatian War of Independence all boats except Soča were relocated to Montenegro without participating in combat operations. Croatian forces captured Soča in drydock at the BSO where it was undergoing an overhaul. Soča underwent a modification program that improved its autonomy by installing a diesel generator. It was recommissioned, now with the Croatian Navy, in 1996 as and remained in service until the early 2000s when it was declared redundant. The remaining boats entered service with the new SR Yugoslav Navy. The first ones to be decommissioned sometime between 1997 and 2001 were Tisa and Una. In 2003 a decision was made that the ongoing major overhaul of Kupa would stop; the boat was decommissioned and broken up in 2008. It appears that the last Una-class boats in service with the SR Yugoslav Navy were Zeta and Vardar, both of them being decommissioned in 2005.  Aftermath  Ownership of the decommissioned boats passed on to Montenegro after the country declared independence in 2006, ending the state of Serbia and Montenegro and its joint armed forces. In 2009 the Ministry of Defence announced that it is willing to donate three Una-class submarines to former SFR Yugoslav republics of Slovenia, Croatia and Serbia. Although the \\"Submariner\\" society from Pula was interested in accepting the donation and exhibiting it in a museum, the Croatian MoD responded with a statement that accepting the donation is against national interests; since most of the fleet of the former Yugoslav Navy was relocated to Montenegro at the beginning of the Croatian War of Independence, Croatia claims the military equipment of the former joint armed forces was stolen, and should be a subject of succession. The MoD further explains that the state interest is in compensation for that equipment, not returning \\"obsolete, damaged and corroded equipment which nowadays Serbia and Montenegro are unsuccessfully trying to sell\\". Una (P-912) Slovenia on the other hand reacted positively to the offer; in 2011 Zeta was loaded on a truck and transported by road through Serbia and Hungary. Although longer and thus more expensive, sea routes and roads that included crossing the Croatian border were avoided in fear of Croatian authorities confiscating the submarine. P-913 was restored with the help of the \\"Slovenian Submariners Society\\" and the Slovenian Army, being officially placed on display at the Pivka Park of Military History on 17 September 2011. In 2013, Una and a Heroj-class attack submarine, Heroj (P-821), were restored and opened to the public in the museum section of the Porto Montenegro marina. The project was initiated by the \\"Submariner\\" Society from Tivat and was, after approval by the Montenegro MoD, financed by Porto Montenegro. The donation of one of the submarines to Serbia was initiated by the \\"Submariner\\" society from Belgrade in 2009. However it wasn't until five years later in June 2014 that the Government of Montenegro officially accepted the proposal and agreed to cede Tisa (P-911) to Serbia. The submarine will be exhibited at the Museum of Science and Technology in Belgrade.

This is particularly applied in fluent interfaces. For example, in Dart, the cascade: a..b() ..c(); is equivalent to the individual calls: a.b(); a.c(); Method cascading is much less common than method chaining – it is found only in a handful of object- oriented languages, while chaining is very common. A form of cascading can be implemented using chaining, but this restricts the interface; see comparison with method chaining, below. Application Cascading is syntactic sugar that eliminates the need to list the object repeatedly. This is particularly used in fluent interfaces, which feature many method calls on a single object. This is particularly useful if the object is the value of a lengthy expression, as it eliminates the need to either list the expression repeatedly or use a temporary variable. For example, instead of either listing an expression repeatedly: a.b().c(); a.b().d(); or using a temporary variable: b = a.b(); b.c(); b.d(); cascading allows the expression to be written once and used repeatedly: a.b()..c() ..d(); Comparison with method chaining Given a method call \`a.b()\`, after executing the call, method cascading evaluates this expression to the left object \`a\` (with its new value, if mutated), while method chaining evaluates this expression to the right object. ;Chaining The following chain (in C++): a.b().c(); is equivalent to the simple form: b = a.b(); b.c(); ;Cascading The following cascade (in Dart): a..b() ..c(); is equivalent to the simple form: a.b(); a.c(); Cascading can be implemented in terms of chaining by having the methods return the target object (receiver, \`this\`, \`self\`). However, this requires that the method be implemented this way already – or the original object be wrapped in another object that does this – and that the method not return some other, potentially useful value (or nothing if that would be more appropriate, as in setters). In fluent interfaces this often means that setters return this instead of nothing. Languages= Pascal  Within the component statement of the with statement, the components (fields) of the record variable specified by the with clause can be denoted by their field identifier only, i.e. without preceding them with the denotation of the entire record variable. The with clause effectively opens the scope containing the field identifiers of the specified record variable, so that the field identifiers may occur as variable identifiers. with date do if month = 12 then begin month := 1; year := year + 1 end else month := month + 1 { is equivalent to } if date.month = 12 then begin date.month := 1; date.year := date.year + 1 end else date.month := date.month + 1 Smalltalk Method chains and cascades were both introduced in Smalltalk; most subsequent object-oriented languages have implemented chains, but few have implemented cascades. In Smalltalk the semicolon operator can be used to send different messages to the same object: self listPane parent color: Color black; height: 17; width: 11 Compare with separate statements, terminated with a period, also using a variable for abbreviation: parent parent := self listPane parent. parent color: Color black. parent height: 17. parent width: 11. One subtlety is that the value of a method call (\\"message\\") in a cascade is still the ordinary value of the message, not the receiver. This is a problem when you do want the value of the receiver, for example when building up a complex value. This can be worked around by using the special \`yourself\` method that simply returns the receiver: Object>>yourself ^self For example, the \\"add an object to a collection\\" method (\`Collection>>add: anObject\`) returns the object that was added, not the collection. Thus to use this in a cascade in an assignment statement, the cascade must end with \`yourself\`, otherwise the value will just be the last element added, not the collection itself: all := OrderedCollection new add: 5; add: 7; yourself. Visual Basic Visual Basic uses the \`With\` statement to enable an arbitrary number of method calls or property accesses on the same object: With ExpressionThatReturnsAnObject .SomeFunction(42) .Property = value End With \`With..End With\` blocks in Visual Basic can be nested: With ExpressionThatReturnsAnObject .SomeFunction(42) .Property = value With .SubObject .SubProperty = otherValue .AnotherMethod(42) End With End With Dart Among newer languages, Dart implements cascades, using a double-dot \`..\` \\"cascaded method invocation operation\\". Unlike Smalltalk, in Dart the value of a cascaded method invocation is the receiver (base object), not the value of the (uncascaded) method invocation, and thus there is no need for \`yourself\`. Dart uses properties, and thus rather than using method syntax for getters and setters (\`foo.getBar(); foo.setBar(b);\`), it uses field value/assignment syntax (\`foo.bar; foo.bar = b;\`), and cascades work with assignments: a..string = 'Hello world!' ..done = true; is equivalent to: a.string = 'Hello world!'; a.done = true; References * External links ;Dart * \\"Method Cascades in Dart\\", Gilad Bracha, February 17, 2012 * Milestone 1 Language Changes, \\"Cascades\\", Bob Nystrom, July 2012 (updated March 2013) Cascading ","title":"Method cascading"},{"id":"41071349","text":"Madre Tierra Resort and Spa' is an eco-resort and spa, located about 2 kilometers north of the town of Vilcabamba near Loja, Loja Province, in Southern Ecuador.

Aldo Raimondi (Rome, 1902 - Milan, 1997), was an Italian painter. Biography Born in Rome in 1902, Raimondi began his artistic career there in the studio of Giuseppe Signorini. He majored in architecture at the Academy of Fine Arts at the age of 22. Between 1925 and 1926 he lived in Milan, where he served in the Italian military; while there, he painted a fresco for a barracks, and restored some of the rooms of the Palazzo Cusani, home of the Command of the Army Corps. Raimondi moved to Parma in 1926, and began to teach in the local Art Institute: there he inserted himself into a difficult environment without much effort, and was quickly befriended by the natives for his extraordinary dedication to his craft and the eye-catching qualities of his character. In Parma, he was commissioned by the mayor to paint some watercolors of the view over the old city, still visible today in the Town Hall, which are proof of his skill as a landscape artist; Raimondi would receive other such commissions both in Italy and abroad later on. In Parma in 1930 he organized his first of many solo exhibitions, both in Italy and abroad. From 1938-40 he replaced Achille Beltrame as the illustrator of \\"Domenica del Corriere,\\" and later was called to illustrate \\"The People of Turin.\\" Specializing in watercolor painting, an exclusive piece of his repertoire, in 1939 he was appointed a professor of watercolors at the Academy of Brera, a chair he left immediately after the war to devote himself full-time to making films. Later he painted landscapes, animals, flowers and many portraits, including those of the Popes Pius XII, John XXIII (1958) and Pope Paul VI (1966). He also produced some windows for the Seminary of Monza, for the parish of Menaggio in Como, and the church of San Simpliciano in Milan.

Name Theia was named for the titaness Theia, who in Greek mythology was the mother of Selene, the goddess of the moon, which parallels the planet Theia's collision with the early Earth that is theorized to have created the Moon. In modern Greek, Theia also means \\"aunt\\". Orbit Theia is thought to have orbited in the L4 or L5 configuration presented by the Earth–Sun system, where it would tend to remain. In that case, it would have grown, potentially to a size comparable to Mars. Gravitational perturbations by Venus could have eventually put it onto a collision course with the early Earth. Collision thumb According to the giant-impact hypothesis, Theia orbited the Sun, nearly along the orbit of the proto-Earth, by staying close to one or the other of the Sun–Earth system's two more stable Lagrangian points ( i.e., either L4 or L5). Theia was eventually perturbed away from that relationship by the gravitational influence of Jupiter and/or Venus, resulting in a collision between Theia and Earth. Computer simulations suggest that Theia was traveling no faster than when it struck Earth at an estimated 45 degree angle. Originally, the hypothesis supposed that Theia had struck Earth with a glancing blow and ejected many pieces of both the proto-Earth and Theia, those pieces either forming one body that became the Moon or forming two moons that eventually merged to form the Moon.\\"Faceoff! The Moon's oddly different sides\\", Astronomy, August 2014, 44–49. Such accounts assumed that if Theia had struck the proto-Earth head-on both planets would have been destroyed, creating a short-lived second asteroid belt between the orbits of Venus and Mars. In contrast, evidence published in January 2016 suggests that the impact was indeed a head-on collision and that Theia's remains can be found in both the Earth and the Moon. Hypotheses From the beginning of modern astronomy, there have been at least four hypotheses for the origin of the Moon: # A single body split into Earth and Moon # The Moon was captured by Earth's gravity (as most of the outer planets' smaller moons were captured) # The Earth and Moon formed at the same time when the protoplanetary disk accreted # The Theia scenario described above. The lunar rock samples retrieved by Apollo astronauts were found to be very similar in composition to Earth's crust, and so were likely removed from Earth in some violent event.

H. Ford (20 May 1808 in London - July 1876 in London), was a South African natural history illustrator of exceptional merit who joined the British Museum in 1837. At first he portrayed animals and produced the plates in Sir Andrew Smith’s Illustrations of the Zoology of South Africa (1838-1847). He was the son of an English farmer in the Cape, James Edward Ford, who was himself a talented miniaturist. Capt. James Edward Ford, one of the 1820 Settlers, was born in England in 1770, and emigrated to South Africa, landing at Port Elizabeth in April 1820. His wife was Frances Stransham 40, and with their 7 children, they were members of Bailie's Party of 256 Settlers on the ship \\"Chapman\\". The area allocated to the Party lay midway between Bathurst and the Great Fish River mouth and was named Cuylerville after Col. Jacob Cuyler. The children were Frances Jane Ford 14, James Samuel Ford 13, George Henry Ford 11, Edward Stransham Ford 9, Adelaide Elizabeth Ford 8, Jane Murray Ford 6, and John Henry Ford 3. Andrew Smith made the acquaintance of the Ford family in 1821 when he was visiting farmers, urging them to provide him with specimens of interest. Young George Ford was suffering from a broken hip inflicted by a cow, an injury which left him permanently crippled, causing Smith to take him back to Cape Town. While convalescing there he was encouraged to paint and draw Smith's specimens. He proved to be so proficient that in 1825 Smith recommended him to the newly founded South African Museum in Cape Town, and later seconded him to the 1834-36 \\"Expedition for Exploring Central Africa\\". A report on this expedition was \\"Illustrations of the zoology of South Africa, consisting chiefly of figures and descriptions of the objects of natural history collected during an expedition into the interior of South Africa, in the years 1834, 1835, and 1836, fitted out by The Cape of Good Hope Association for Exploring Central Africa, together with a summary of African zoology, and an inquiry into the geographical ranges of species in that quarter of the globe\\". When Smith returned to England in 1837, Ford accompanied him and found immediate recognition for the quality of his work. He was employed at the British Museum and worked there with Smith who was finally driven away by the discomfort of the Bloomsbury semi-basement. Ford continued working under John Edward Gray, assistant to the Keeper of Zoology. Ford, because of chronic backache, eventually worked from the Surbiton home of Albert Günther who was to succeed Gray in 1875. George Viner Ellis (1812-1900) succeeded to the Chair of Anatomy at University College London in 1850, and became one of the foremost anatomists of his time. This institution, in its first thirty-five years of existence, published an extraordinary number of anatomical atlases. Ellis and Ford used the relatively new technique of chromolithography for their imperial folio atlas of fifty-eight plates, \\"Illustrations of Dissections in a Series of Original Coloured Plates the Size of Life\\". The plates were done between 1863 and 1867, with from four to seven completed each year. These plates are considered exceptionally clear and accurate, with an aesthetic depiction of the cadavers, printed by the Mintern Bros., and published by James Walton. George Henry Ford was the husband of Emma Ethel Ford and was the father of John Ford, Warren Ford, Quentin Ford, Clive Ford, Mona Ford and 3 others. G. H. Ford is commemorated in the scientific name of a species of Hispaniolan snake, Chilabothrus fordii (Ford's boa).Beolens, Bo; Watkins, Michael; Grayson, Michael (2011).

The footbridge crosses the A249, a major road which runs between Maidstone and Sheerness. The crossing is named after Jade Hobbs, who was killed attempting to cross the road in December 2000 aged eight. Her mother, Caroline, subsequently campaigned for the crossing to be built, and won a Special Award at the 2003 Pride of Britain Awards for her efforts. Background The A249 is a major dual carriageway, connecting the M20 and M2 motorways in Kent. It was improved in the 1960s to be an important link between these two roads, with the expectation that traffic would increase greatly along it. The location of the crossing lies on the Pilgrim's Way, a historic track from Winchester to Canterbury, to the west of Detling village itself. The road junction was built in 1961 as part of the Detling Bypass, which took the A249 away from the village centre. It opened to traffic in the summer of 1962. By 2000, an estimated 30,000 vehicles were using the road daily. Jade Hobbs View of the crossing from one side of the footbridge In 2000, Jade Hobbs was eight years old, and lived with her parents Paul and Caroline and four siblings. They had been complaining about the traffic for some time, and had led a campaign to persuade Kent County Council to install a footbridge. On 16 December, Jade was walking with her grandmother, Margaret Kuwertz, to do some Christmas shopping. Kuwertz had looked across the road, and decided it was safe, but just before they managed to cross the other side, she was hit by an oncoming vehicle. Jade attempted to pull her grandmother to safety, but was also killed by the impact. Caroline Hobbs later recalled \\"Mum must've thought they could get across, and hadn't seen the other car. And they were actually nearly across when the car hit them.\\" Crossing The crossing includes the silhouette of a ballerina. After the accident, Caroline Hobbs insisted that not only did the crossing impact safety, it also affected quality of life as it prevented children from being able to walk to the local school or village hall unaccompanied. Kent County Council installed two speed cameras at the junction in 2001 but refused to build a footbridge on cost grounds. The Hobbs family set up a charity for donations, raising £75,000 towards constructing the footbridge. In March 2001, the council announced that the crossing would be built. It was officially opened by Caroline and Paul Hobbs in August 2002. The crossing includes a ballerina silhouette, based on one of Jade's favourite hobbies. A plaque near the crossing commemorates Jade and other fatal casualties at accidents on the A249. The Hobbs' campaigning towards building the crossing resulted in Caroline winning the Special Award at the 2003 Pride of Britain Awards. Caroline Hobbs continued to run the Jade Charity. In 2007, it donated road safety play equipment to local schools. The charity relies on the goodwill of visitors, principally walkers travelling along the Pilgrim's Way, to leave a donation to help fund the upkeep of the crossing. In 2010 the Hobbs family left the area and moved abroad. In February 2011, the crossing was defaced with anti-Muslim graffiti.

It is intended to cover the additional costs of heating over the winter months. It was first introduced by the Labour government in 1997, and was first announced by Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon Brown in his Pre-Budget Statement of that year. To be eligible for the benefit in a particular year, a person must be born before a specific qualifying date (e.g. 5 April 1954 for payments for the winter 2019-2020), and have lived in the UK for at least one day during the week of 16 to 22 September 2019 - this is called the ‘qualifying week’. Certain categories of people are excluded groups (prisoners, people receiving long-term free hospital care, those with certain immigration issues, and those living in care homes and receiving income-related benefits such as pension credit). Thus for the winter of 2019-2020 the benefit was available to those aged 65 by 5 April 2019. The benefit may also be applicable to those living in Switzerland or the EEA. The amount paid is greater for those aged eighty years and older and is set so that a person living alone (or with people ineligible for the payment) is paid twice as much as a person in a household where more than one person receives the payment. If the weather is particularly cold, a cold weather payment may also be made. In Great Britain, the Social Fund Winter Fuel Payment Regulations 2000 govern the system, under the Social Security Contributions and Benefits Act 1992. In Northern Ireland the Social Fund Winter Fuel Payment Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2000 govern the system. In the winter of 2011-12, the benefit cost the UK Government £2,100,000,000 and was paid out to 12,700,000 people.

The wall painting was created during the late Yuan Dynasty, c. 1271 – 1368 AD. The painting is colored pigments mixed with clay and plaster. It measures 306.5 cm high and 1042 cm in length. This painting is similar to those found in Sanqing Hall of the Yongle Monastery in Shanxi province. The Sanqing Hall paintings are dated by an inscription to 1325 AD. Based on the strong stylistic affinities, this work can also be dated to the Yuan dynasty (AD 1279–1368). Daoist imagery Homage to the Highest Power is a popular theme in Daoist pictorial art. Daoist theology advocates the concept of Dao (the Way), a primeval force which gives form to all things in the universe. Homage to Dao is expected of all regular followers of Dao. Description The wall painting is one of a pair from the Pingyang region of southern Shanxi province. This work was created as decoration for the west wall of a temple hall or worship space. It is symmetrically balanced leading your eye first to the central figures and then fanning out on either side. It shows a procession of heavenly beings moving at a leisurely pace to pay homage to the Supreme Power. The procession is led by a fierce warrior, the Lord of the Southern Dipper (Sagittarius).

It was produced by RBB for Das Erste and was broadcast in the timeslot on Thursdays at 11:15 CET. The show, which was concerned with politics, culture, and social trends, offered a lively blend of documentary and satirical items. Typically it began with a satirical 'report' by Carsten von Ryssen related to a current matter of public concern. The show's essential hipness, which was underlined by Hardenberg's crisp announcements and the visual and thematic backdrop of the city of Berlin, infuses the subsequent documentary pieces with a certain esprit. Thematically, their scope ran from coverage of political and social movements to current trends in underground and popular culture, whereby one piece was usually biographical in nature, setting it off from the more panoramic style of the rest of the show. Less serious segments often echoed the satire of the keynote feature. Regular items included the (usually biweekly) \\"Berlin for Beginners\\" (\\"Berlin für Anfänger\\") and the show's end note, in which Manfred Dumke, an elderly pensioner, shared his curious insights on current affairs with the rest of Germany from the comfort of his own living room. The feature \\"Berlin for Beginners\\" was in fact a vestige from the beginnings of the program in the mid 1990s when Polylux was still called \\"Tip TV\\" and was the televised version of the Berlin city magazine Tip, then already hosted by Hardenberg, but on a regional TV station, FAB. When Tip was taken over in 1997, the new owners didn't want the show, but the ORB was interested in the format, and so it was taken on under the new title of Polylux. In 2000 the ARD adopted Polylux into its late night programming on Das Erste, showing it at 04:00. However the youthful appeal of the program quickly earned it an earlier slot, which was on Mondays at midnight. It was then moved to a slot on Thursdays before it was canceled. Cancellation The RBB announced the cancellation of the show, effective by the end of 2008, on May 21 of the same year. The decision was reasoned with a lack of funding. The last show was aired on 18 December 2008. The show's offshoot web portal Polylog.tv was kept available for about two more years, but eventually the domain became expired and is unavailable as of 2016.

Toronto Star, November 13, 2013. Vermette is of Métis descent and originates from Winnipeg, Manitoba. She was a MFA student in creative writing at the University of British Columbia.\\"Local poet didn't know it\\". Winnipeg Free Press, October 3, 2013. In addition to writing, Vermette advocates for the equality of Aboriginal peoples in Canada, vocalizing her dissatisfaction with the apathy shown towards Indigenous issues by the Canadian government and the Canadian media.  Early life  Katherena Vermette grew up in the North End of Winnipeg, Manitoba, a neighbourhood distinguished by a relatively high population of Indigenous people (approximately 25%), primarily First Nations and Métis people. Winnipeg, a city often singled out for its high rate of reported crimes, garners further negative outsider attention in its North End because of its dense number of reported crimes. In an interview with CBC Radio, Vermette described her childhood as not being \\"picturesque\\", in the usual sense of the word. For Vermette, growing up in the North End of Winnipeg meant that things were not always simple and, from a young age, she bore witness to the kind of injustice and prejudice that young people are typically spared from. An example of this injustice came when a 14-year-old Vermette lost her older brother, the just 18 year-old Donovan, who was missing for six months prior to being found dead. Vermette asserts that the combination of Donovan's young age, the circumstance at his having been at a bar with friends prior to his disappearance, and because he was Cree meant that his disappearance did not get adequate coverage by the media. Vermette cites the general apathy shown by the people of her community and the media surrounding her brother's disappearance as being the factor which instigated her own sense of the unfairness of the discrimination against the Aboriginal populations of Canada by non-Aboriginal Canadians, leading to her desire to activate for change.  Career  Katherena Vermette is known primarily for her poetry, although she is also a writer of prose. From her viewpoint, Vermette's penchant for poetry stems from the fluidity and complexity of it as a medium; it combines singing, storytelling, and even painting, yet is something entirely different.  North End Love Songs  Vermette's first published volume of poetry, North End Love Songs functions as an ode to the place she grew up, Winnipeg's North End, and her intimate perspective on a place that is looked down upon for its high levels of reported crime. In the work, she describes her neighbourhood with respect to nature, highlighting the animals, foliage and rivers that coexist within it. In writing North End Love Songs, Vermette sought to replace the prejudiced perceptions held by people outside of the North End with the beautiful way that she knows her community. The collection depicts a \\"young girl or woman struggling with identity and place,\\" says Vermette. This conflict between a simultaneous deep sense of affection and of defiance to one's place of origin is precisely what constitutes the idea of home, in Vermette's view.  \\"Heart\\"  A poem commissioned by CBC Aboriginal, \\"Heart\\" similarly depicts the North End of Winnipeg from Vermette's personal point of view. Vermette aims to change the narrative from \\"that North End\\", known for being \\"broken\\", \\"tired\\", a \\"lost cause\\", and \\"beaten\\", to the way she knows it; rather, a place that is \\"healing\\", \\"working\\", \\"seeking [for a cause]\\", and \\"rising\\". The poem gets its name for being about the North End which, from Vermette's perspective, is the \\"heart of the Métis nation\\".  The Seven Teachings Stories  Vermette's children's picture book series The Seven Teachings Stories was published by Portage and Main Press in 2015. Illustrated by Irene Kuziw, the collection aims to present the Anishnaabe Teachings of the Seven Grandfathers in a way that is easily digestible for young people. The series depicts Indigenous children in a metropolitan context, fostering a sense of representation for historically and continually marginalized Indigenous groups, among those who they are, and have been, marginalized by. The series comprises seven individual volumes: The Just Right Gift, Singing Sisters, The First Day, Kode's Quest(ion), Amik Loves School, Misaabe's Stories, and What is Truth, Betsy?. The Break Her debut novel The Break was published in 2016, and was a shortlisted finalist for that year's Rogers Writers' Trust Fiction Prize\\"Two debut novelists among this year’s Writers’ Trust nominees\\".

Quill & Quire, November 24, 2017. Film and digital media In 2015, she and Erika MacPherson co-directed the 20-minute National Film Board of Canada documentary This River, about Canadian Indigenous families that have had to search for family members who have disappeared. Partly based on Vermette's own experience, the film received the 2016 Coup de coeur du jury award at Montreal's festival, and premiered in Vermette's hometown of Winnipeg on October 5, at the Winnipeg Art Gallery. It was named best short documentary at the 5th Canadian Screen Awards. Vermette and NFB producer Alicia Smith also created a related Instagram work, What Brings Us Here, a companion piece to The River, which offers portraits of volunteers behind the community-run Winnipeg search teams the Bear Clan and Drag the Red. Smith has stated that it was Vermette's North End Love Songs which helped draw her attention to the perspectives of indigenous youth from the North End and the experience of having missing family members.  Other work  She is a member of the Aboriginal Writers Collective of Manitoba, and edited the anthology xxx ndn: love and lust in ndn country in 2011.\\"Manitoba writers explore Indigenous erotica in self-published book\\". CBC Manitoba, June 27, 2011. In addition to her own publications, her work has also been published in the literary anthology Manitowapow: Aboriginal Writings from the Land of Water.  Accolades  In 2013, Vermette won the Governor General's Literary Award for poetry, for her collection North End Love Songs, an accolade she dubbed a \\"goal\\" for poetry, as well as being \\"completely unexpected\\". In an interview with CBC Radio, Vermette discussed having considered not accepting the award, as a means of protesting the Canadian government’s treatment of the many missing and murdered Aboriginal women at the time, and disagreeing with the government’s policies in general. After consideration, Vermette decided to accept the award because the people who voted for North End Love Songs were a collection of her literary peers, making it a reflection of the Canadian poetry community, rather than the Canadian government. In 2017, Vermette won the Amazon.ca First Novel Award for The Break.\\"Katherena Vermette wins Amazon.ca First Novel Award\\". The Globe and Mail May 25, 2017.

Activism  In addition to writing herself, Vermette also works with young people, ostracized for their circumstances and labelled as being \\"at risk\\". This workshop focuses on utilizing writing as a means of coping with the struggles associated with growing up marginalized because of that which makes one different from the majority. Vermette seeks to promote the development in young people's artistic voice, through the medium of poetry. Vermette has described her writing as motivated by an activist spirit, particularly on First Nations issues.Interview with Katherena Vermette. As It Happens, November 13, 2013.

Language acquisition is an impressive cognitive achievement attained by humans. In the first few years of life, children already demonstrate general knowledge and understanding of basic patterns in their language. They can extend words they hear to novel situations and apply grammatical rules in novel contexts. Although children possess an impressive ability to acquire and comprehend language early in life, they make many errors and mistakes as they enhance their knowledge and understanding of language. Three prominent errors in early word use are overgeneralization, overextension, and underextension. The majority of words that children first learn are often used correctly. However, estimates indicate that up to one-third of the first fifty words that children learn are occasionally misused. Many studies indicate a curvilinear trend in naming errors and mistakes in initial word usage. In other words, early in language acquisition, children rarely make naming errors. However, as vocabulary enhances and language growth accelerates, the frequency of error increases. The amount of error decreases again as vocabulary continues to improve. Scholars debate the underlying developmental causes and reasons for these mistakes. One theory, the semantic feature hypothesis, states that mistakes occur because children acquire the basic features of a word's meaning before learning its more specific aspects. For instance, the child may initially use the word basketball in reference to any round object, but then change its meaning to a round, orange, and grooved ball that bounces. Children may overextend the meaning of basketball to any round object until they learn the more specific aspects of the word's meaning. Other theories suggest that errors in early word use are the result of an inability on the part of the child to retrieve the correct word. Although the child might have accurately comprehended the word at one time, they are unable to actively retrieve the word or its meaning from their rapidly growing vocabulary.  Overregularization (overgeneralization)  Overregularization is defined as the \\"application of a principle of regular change to a word that changes irregularly.\\" Examples of overregularization in verb use include using the word comed instead of came. Examples in noun use include using the word tooths instead of teeth. The error is usually seen after children have learned language rules because children apply learned rules to irregular words. Pertaining to the examples, the child using the word comed may have originally used came correctly. Once the child learned the '-ed' suffix rule that commonly forms the past tense; however, the child applied the rule to a verb whose correct grammatical form is irregular. The same applies to the tooths example, but the language rule is the addition of the suffix '-s' to form the plural noun. Overregularization research led by Daniel Slobin argues against B.F. Skinner's view of language development through reinforcement. It shows that children actively construct words' meanings and forms during the child's own development. Differing views on the causes of overregularization and its extinction have been presented. Gary Marcus et al. published a study in which they monitored the speech of 83 children and recorded the spoken past tense of irregular verbs. They argue that children store irregular verbs in their memory and separately develop a rule for the production of the past tense form of any verb. To correctly use an irregular verb, children must retrieve that verb from their memory and block the rule; however, children's retrieval is often imperfect. They conclude the cause of overregularization with: \\"When retrieval fails, the rule is applied, and overregularization results.\\" Their study's results found overregularization to be rare with a mean of 2.5% of the spoken irregular verbs, to be used for most irregular verbs from the ages of 2 years old until school ages, to be used less often with the irregular verbs that the child's parents speak more often, and to follow a pattern of \\"U-Shaped Development\\" in which the child uses the correct form of the irregular verb before overregularizing it. According to Marcus, overregularization ends when the child develops sufficiently strong memory traces to irregular forms. Michael Maratsos disagrees with Marcus's causal claim. He argues that the overregularized verb form and the correct irregular form compete for usage, as \\"the two forms are both initially acceptable alternatives.\\" The child increasingly chooses the irregular form, beating the overregularized one, because the child only experiences the irregular form. Maratsos argues that because children often use both the irregular and overregularized forms of the same verb, even in the same speech sample, the blocking theory proposed by Marcus proves problematic. If retrieval blocks the rule, it is unlikely that the rule would be 'un-blocked' soon after. He argues it seems more likely that environmental input and learning accounts for the gradual decline in overregularization. Moreover, the competition theory accounts for the highly varied rates of overregularization seen in Roger Brown's longitudinal study of Adam, Abe, and Sarah. Abe had an extremely high rate of overregularization, 24%, compared with Adam's rate of 3.6%, and Sarah's of 7.9%. Maratsos claims Abe was intellectually gifted, \\"likely the best overall learner and retriever of words.\\" If Abe retrieved words well, then having such a high rate of overregularization is incompatible with Marcus's theory, which holds retrieval failure responsible for overregularization. Rather, Abe's bigger vocabulary exposed him to more regular words, resulting in a stronger competition between the irregular and overregularized forms and a higher potential rate of failure.  Overextension  Overextension is an error in early word use in which a child uses a single word to label multiple different things in a manner that is inconsistent with adult usage. There are three types of overextensions. Categorical overinclusions involve using one word within a category to label a closely related referent that falls in the same category. Examples are seen in references to people (e.g. daddy for all men), animals (e.g. dog for horses and other quadrupeds), vehicles (e.g. truck for bus), foods (e.g. apple for oranges), and numerous other categories. Analogical overextensions involve inferring a similarity between a word's standard referent and its labeled referent in the absence of any actual relationship. Inferred similarities are most often perceptual, such as when a child uses ball to refer to all round objects (e.g. the moon). Predicate statements involve an attempt to comment on the relationship between an immediate referent and an absent entity. This is evident when a child uses doll to refer to an empty crib where the doll usually is located. Like overgeneralizations, overextensions are believed to stem from limitations in vocabulary, which are the result of weak knowledge and/or immature retrieval ability. Clark and Clark (1977) have put forth a two-stage account of how overextensions develop. In the first stage, a child focuses on a particular feature of an object and refers to that feature using a single new word. Gradually, the child realizes that the word has a more specific meaning but does not know the other words that are required to be more precise. In the second stage, the child overextends the word, using it as a form of shorthand when referring to things that are similar to the standard referent. For example, the child uses dog to refer to any animal with similar features, namely four legs. After increasing until a certain point, overextensions diminish over time as the child receives corrective feedback. This feedback most often comes from parents and teachers, who help the child revise his or her word meaning boundaries. However, parents can also unintentionally prolong the use of overextensions. Parents often respond to overextensions with acceptance, and the use of joint labeling (e.g. referring to both wolves and dogs as puppies) reinforces overextended language.  Underextension  Underextension, which is roughly the opposite of overextension, occurs when a child acquires a word for a particular thing and fails to extend it to other objects in the same category, using the word in a highly restricted and individualistic way. For example, a child may learn the word flower in connection with a rose but fail to extend its meaning to other types of flowers. Although research more commonly addresses the underextension of nouns, this error can also apply to verbs. For example, a child might underextend the verb sit and only use it with reference to the family dog's sitting but no one else's. Underextension is generally thought to be less common, or perhaps just less noticeable, than overextension, but according to Margaret Harris, recent research shows an increasing number of reports of underextension. According to Harris, there are two different kinds of underextension. The first is \\"context bound\\", in which a child produces a word only in a limited and specific context. An example is when a child only uses the word duck when hitting a toy duck off the bathtub and chuff-chuff only when pushing a toy train. The second type of early underextension involves restricting a word to a particular referent instead of a particular situation. This kind of underextension is not context-bound but contextually flexible, and suggests that children are using words in a genuinely referential way. Harris mentions examples of this type of underextension from her own research, such as the use of the word clock only to refer to wall clocks and light only to refer to ceiling lights with a shade. As is the case with overextension, parents can contribute to a child's prolonged underextension of words. When speaking to their children, parents may not give every instance of a category of objects its correct name, especially in unusual situations, triggering word errors. In a study by Thomas G. White, preschool children ages 3 to 5 did not apply labels (e.g., food) to category instances that were rated as atypical by adults. The study also showed that mothers used superordinate terms much less in atypical instances than typical instances. This suggests that the labels children hear their parents apply may affect underextension. However, as children grow older, their vocabularies grow and instances of underextension decline.

Issues Double jeopardy, Separation of powers, Free speech, Due process, Equal protection, and Abuse of discretion Prior proceedings Brewbaker was charged with simple misdemeanor annoying speech. Under Iowa Court Rule 2.67(6) Brewbaker was only allowed a jury of six members. Upon a guilty verdict Brewbaker was fined $65 in the District Court for Story County Iowa on an annoying speech conviction in November 2009 and placed on one year of probation. Brewbaker applied for discretionary appeal to the Iowa Supreme Court on grounds that the term 'annoying' was void for vagueness, see Coates v. Cincinnati, but the application was denied. Subsequently the Iowa Board of Regents in a public hearing where Brewbaker was not allowed to speak in his defense, upheld a modification to Brewbaker's probation suspending him from State educational services at Iowa State University for the same transaction as the simple misdemeanor. Brewbaker's application for review of agency action to the District Court for Polk County was denied. Subsequent proceedings Brewbaker applied for further review on November 12, 2013 noting Vogel gave a false account of the facts in Kocher to frame it as controlling instead of Dressler where the conviction preceded administrative sanctions. The Iowa Supreme Court denied further review. On March 3, 2014 Iowa Court of Appeals Chief Judge Danielson entered an order for publication.

Dickenson was a patron of literary men. John Bulmer, M.D., dedicated to him his Anthropometamorphosis; or, Man Transformed, 4to, 1653; and the Rev. Josiah Hunter dedicated to him a Sermon on Philip iv. 5, 4to, 1656.

It currently encompasses on its campus and leases an additional to the Loyola University Medical Center. Construction began in 1918 on land donated by the Edward Hines Lumber Company that was originally Speedway Park, a board track racecourse. The building was originally intended to house casualties from World War I, and Hines wanted the building to serve as a hospital after the war. Hines was successful in lobbying the United States Congress to take over the facility as a veterans hospital in 1920. In 2013, of the campus, including the Old Airmail and Postal Service Buildings from the Maywood Air Mail Field, were listed on the National Register of Historic Places as a historic district. History=Speedway Park and early developments Car raced at Speedway Park The history of the property in Hines, Illinois began in 1835, when the land was sold to Frederick Bronson by the United States government. The land was used for farming until 1914, when the Speedway Park Association purchased the lot to develop a race track. The organization built a oval wooden track on the land and held races starting in June 1915. The track was one of the longest board tracks in the United States. The course was host to a number of national and international racing competitions featuring competitors such as Barney Oldfield, Ralph DePalma, Louis Chevrolet, and Dario Resta. The track was initially very successful, attracting as many as 45,000 spectators. However, the entry of the United States into World War I in April 1917 doomed the financial viability of the racetrack. It was one of the first board tracks to close; most board tracks in the United States were closed by the end of the 1930s. Early history The course was purchased in December 1917 by the Edward Hines Lumber Company on behalf of Edward Hines Sr. Once the United States entered World War I, the City of Chicago sought a site for a temporary military hospital. Edward Hines Jr. was killed on the front lines in France in the opening months of American involvement in the war. In his memory, Hines Sr. offered to donate his new property as a potential site of the Chicago facility; it was selected in September 1918. The Field Museum of Natural History was also considered as a location for the facility. However, it was feared that the conversion of the museum to a medical facility would prove too costly. The fact that Hines' hospital was built to be a hospital also played in his favor. Hines intended to build a fireproof building that could house casualties during the war and then operate as a public hospital after the war. Schmidt, Garden and Martin and H. B. Wheelock were awarded the commission to design the facility, and the Shank Company was tasked with its construction. When World War I ended in November 1918, the agreement with Hines was terminated as there was no longer a need to house casualties. The hospital stood partially constructed for the next two years as Hines led an effort to lobby Congress to have the building taken over by the United States Public Health Service. Secretary of the Treasury Carter Glass disapproved of the plan because no official contract was signed between Hines and the federal government. However, an investigation by the United States Department of War found sufficient evidence of a verbal agreement between the two parties. With help from Congressmen Adolph J. Sabath, James Robert Mann, Martin B. Madden, and Carl R. Chindblom, a Senate vote on the matter passed 33 to 27. $3.4 million was appropriated to the project under the condition that Hines provided an additional $1.6 million. The transfer was approved in March 1920 and construction began again. The campus was originally known as U.S. Public Health Service Hospital Number 76, and was popularly referred to as Speedway Hospital or Broadview Hospital. In honor of his contribution to see the facility completed, on October 24, 1921, President Warren G. Harding declared that the facility was to be renamed to honor Hines' son. It was the first American veterans hospital to be named after a person. The first patient was admitted on August 8, 1921. A dedication ceremony was held on November 6, 1921 led by Marshal of France Ferdinand Foch and Senator Medill McCormick. 1920s–1940s expansions The Main Infirmary Building was capable of housing a thousand beds, and by February 1922, was already near capacity. The unique building was only wide, but long so that every room could have sunlight. It was also the largest fireproof hospital in the nation, and featured many state-of-the-art technologies such as an electric call system and an x-ray department. Seven other buildings were erected during initial construction in 1921: the Morgue and Utility Shops; the Recreational and Library Building; the Kitchen, Chapel, and Social Service Building; the Power House; the Subsistence Building; the Garage; and the Supply Depot. The facility was transferred from the Public Health Service to the recently created Veterans Bureau in April 1922. By 1925, the campus saw over 3,100 admissions per year. In May 1928, President Calvin Coolidge approved a $15 million appropriation to improve veterans health facilities, including $1.1 million for Hines. With this money, the hospital was able to renovate its staff quarters into tuberculosis and behavioral health wards. They also built a new administration building and employee housing, thus opening more space in the Main Infirmary Building, increasing its capacity to 1,600. It was also at this point that the hospital grounds were extensively landscaped with a sunken garden, a new street lighting system, a new east entrance, and new drives. The landscaping is attributed to Jens Jensen, although it is uncertain if Jensen's design was ever implemented. On July 26, 1931, the Doughboy Fountain was donated by the Cook County American Legion Auxiliary in honor of World War I veterans. A memorial to Medal of Honor recipient George Dilboy, who was killed in the war, was unveiled in 1942. Hines Hospital became the national leader in surgery for veterans facilities, performing over 14,600 procedures per year by 1935. During World War II, a new eighty-three building complex was built adjacent to the property with a $4.5 million appropriation. Known as the Vaughan General Hospital, it was built on the grounds of the former Maywood Air Mail Field to serve the needs of the Army. The first patient was admitted on August 1, 1944. The new campus was added to the Hines complex after the war in April 1946, increasing the capacity of Hines from 1,600 to 3,253 beds. The new campus also afforded Hines the opportunity to manufacture some of its medical equipment and establish a medical research division. In 1946, Hines partnered with five medical schools to become a training center. 1960s to present In 1962, the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare transferred of the Hines property to the State of Illinois Department of Mental Health so that they could build a new mental health facility. The John J. Madden Clinic took over mental health operations from the hospital, allowing Hines to re-purpose 280 beds to intensive care. Also that year, of the Vaughan campus were leased to Loyola University Chicago Stritch School of Medicine to build a new medical school. The 451-bed Foster G. McGraw Hospital, later known as the Loyola University Medical Center, opened on May 29, 1969. This partnership allowed Hines to have one of the most comprehensive residency programs among veterans hospitals. The Vietnam War brought another influx of injured veterans to Hines. In response, a $32 million, 1,200 bed hospital was built from 1966 to 1970 to replace the Main Infirmary Building. A 120-bed Nursing Home Care Unite was completed in 1982 to treat aging veterans of the two World Wars. By the early 1990s, the complex had sixty-two buildings, including one of five Blind Rehabilitation Centers in the Veterans Affairs network. A fifteen-bedroom Ronald McDonald House was added in 1994. By 1996, the facility had serviced 900,000 patients. The most recent developments are a new Blind Rehabilitation Center and Spinal Cord Injury Center in 2005. Historical recognition The historic value of the campus was recognized in 1980, when the Old Airmail and Postal Service Buildings were determined to be eligible for the National Register of Historic Places by the National Park Service. The buildings may be the oldest mail airport structures in the United States, serving the Postal Service between 1922 and 1927. Charles Lindbergh piloted the maiden air mail flight between Chicago and St. Louis, Missouri on April 15, 1926. Today, the buildings house a garage and an inflammable storage building. Two years later, the VA hospital was also determined eligible for listing, although neither property was listed in the following decades. These two entities were combined into the Edward Hines Jr. Veterans Administration Hospital Historic District, which was listed on October 9, 2013. The district includes twenty-six of the early buildings on campus.

It also functioned as a generic name for overhead projectors in the GDR. The Polylux was produced in the VEB (Volkseigener Betrieb: people’s enterprise) Phylatex-Physikgeräte DDR, in Frankenberg near Chemnitz (then known as Karl-Marx-Stadt). It was, amongst others, widespread in educational institutions in the GDR. After 2004, Polylux was a registered trademark of the company Polytechnik Frankenberg GmbH, which as a successor firm of the original Polylux producer continued to produce the device. Until the Wende in 1989, 27,000 devices were produced on average each year, and were also exported to the Soviet Union. In the year 2004, 6,000 devices were still being produced. In 2006, the enterprise closed down. The word Polylux (from Greek and Latin, meaning \\"much light\\") originates with Erich Schöpe, a physicist and former director of the Polylux manufacturer. Today, the word enjoys cult status as a typical GDR word and is still widespread in everyday language of the East German states. A television show produced by Ostdeutscher Rundfunk Brandenburg (now Rundfunk Berlin- Brandenburg) was named after the Polylux with reference to the \\"enlightening\\" function of the device. The body of the Polylux consisted of plastic and contained a ventilator with delayed shutdown in order to avoid a heat build- up. The light source was a halogen light bulb for a standard line voltage. It contained a switch for two different light intensity levels. Originally, the lenses of the device were made out of glass. In order to reduce the weight, lenses made of plastic were later used. In particular, the fresnel lens with its large surface area, on which transparencies were placed, was made out of plastic.

One of their most visible legacies is the Bahla Fort, a large complex of mud brick buildings on stone foundations which is registered as a UNESCO world heritage site. Background After the early days of Islam, the tribes in the interior of Oman were led by Imams, who held both spiritual and temporal power. The Yahmad branch of Azd tribes gained power in the 9th century. They established a system where the ulama of the Banu Sama, the largest of the Nizari tribes of the interior, would select the Imam. The authority of the Imams declined due to power struggles. During the 11th and 12th centuries Oman was controlled by the Seljuk Empire. They were expelled in 1154, when the Nabhani dynasty came to power. Rule Bahla Fort in 2013 after major restoral work in the 1990s The best quality frankincense, a valuable product in the Middle Ages, comes from Dhofar in the interior of southern Oman. The Banu Nabhan controlled the trade in frankincense on the overland route via Sohar to the Yabrin oasis, and then north to Bahrain, Baghdad and Damascus. Muhammed al-Fallah of the Banu Nabhan emerged as a powerful leader in 1151 and had taken control by 1154. He lived until 1176. The Nabhanis ruled as muluk, or kings, while the Imams were reduced to largely symbolic significance. The Imams lost moral authority since the title came to be treated as the property of the dominant tribe at any time. According to the historian Sirhan bin Said there were no records of Imams from 1153, when Imam Musa bin Abu Ja'afar died, until 1406, when Imam Hubaise bin Muhammad died. The Nabhani made their capital at Bahla. The Bahla Fort is called Hisn Tammah, and is said to take its name from an Iranian ruler of the town before the Islamic period. There are probably some pre-Islamic structural elements, but most of the buildings date from the Nabhani period. Buildings include the Friday Mosque, which probably dates from the 14th century and has an elegantly carved mihrab. The most recent buildings appear to date to the start of the 16th century. The fort testifies to the power of the Nabhani in their heyday. The period is poorly documented. It seems that at times the Nabhani only controlled part of the interior of the country, and at other times also ruled over the coastal lands. Oman suffered from Persian invasions, and at one point the coast was controlled by the Kingdom of Hormuz. The Banu Nabhan were dominant over the other tribes until the end of the 15th century. There are records of personal visits by Nabhani rulers to Ethiopia, Zanzibar, the Lamu Archipelago of what is now Kenya, and Persia. The al-Nabhani dynasty of Pate Island in the Lamu Archipelago claimed descent from the Omani dynasty. Aqueel Bin Nabhan Decline and fall Oman had an elected Imam and a hereditary Nabhani sultan from the 15th century into the 17th century, with the Imams gaining the ascendancy. The Nabhani ruler Suleiman bin Mudhafar was removed by the Imam Muhammad ibn Ismail (1500–29). However, the Nabhanis clung to power in the Bahla region. In 1507 the Portuguese captured the coastal city of Muscat, and gradually extended their control along the coast up to Sohar in the north and down to Sur in the southeast. Omani histories record that the Bahla fort was destroyed in the early 17th century shortly before the Ya'aruba dynasty took control of Oman, although it is possible that parts of the old structure remained and were used as the basis for later construction. In 1624 Nasir bin Murshid of the Ya'aruba took over control of Oman. Later years The Nabahina retained power at the beginning of the Ya'rubi state and they treated Jabal al-akhdar (The Green Mountains located in the interior of Oman) as an emirate. Thus, the Nabahinah transferred their loyalties from the Banu Rawahah to the Banu Riyam at the beginning of the seventeenth century. They became the tamimah of the Banu Riyam and princes of the Jabal al-Akhdar, and survived as such until they were defeated in the war of Jabal Akhdar in 1956. At the time the Sheikh of the Bani Riyam was Suleiman bin Himyar Al-Nabhani, Lord of the Jebel Akhdar-and descendant of the ancient Nabahina dynasty. After the war Suleiman bin Himyar fled to Saudi Arabia where he remained in exile until he returned to Oman on Thursday, 28 November 1996, where he lived his remaining days in Muscat until he died on Thursday, 7 May 1998 - most of his kin remain to this day living in Muscat the capital of Oman. Although the Ya'aruba ruled under the title of Imam, since they originated from the Nabahina kings dynasty they actually continued to rule as kings inheriting the title of Imam through vertical succession, thereby contradicting the Imamate tradition which provides that the Imam must be chosen from amongst the ahl al- hal wal ‘aqd transliterated as \\"those who loosen and bind\\". (This concept evolved during the period of the Khulafa ar-Rashidoon as a mechanism to choose the leader of the Muslims. The ahl al-hal wal ‘aqd are the leading personalities of society who are knowledgeable and have a proven track record of sincerity and sacrifice. They have no personal or class interests. The person who is appointed leader also does not covet such a position but is seen as most suitable for the job.)

He went to school at Edge Grove School and Winchester College, and studied law and French law at the University of Wales. He was awarded a scholarship to the University of Poitiers, where a chance meeting in a local café with the publisher (and early sponsor of Private Eye) Anthony Blond led to a collaboration on Blond's Roman Emperors. His doctoral research on medieval religious and military life, specialising in the Knights Templar and Knights Hospitaller, the two leading military orders of the Crusades was undertaken as a member of New College, Oxford. While conducting his research, he won a research scholarship to the Sorbonne in the history of Byzantium and the Christian Near-East.

The game is a prequel to its 2012 predecessor Sniper Elite V2, and is the third installment in the Sniper Elite series. Sniper Elite III is set around three years prior to the events of V2, following the exploits of Office of Strategic Services officer Karl Fairburne as he participates in the North African conflict during World War II, in which he learns of a secret wonder weapon programmed by the Nazi forces. Gameplay The game retains and builds on the mechanics of Sniper Elite V2. Players go through large battlefield maps based on the North African conflict. The sniper rifle is the player's primary weapon, though additional weapons, including submachine guns and pistols, silenced or not depending on the situation, are available. In addition to hand grenades, the player can deploy tripwire booby traps, land mines and dynamite. Binoculars can be used to tag enemies, displaying their position and movements. The player-character must hold their breath to properly line up the shot. A red icon appears in the scope, marking the projected point of impact. There are weapon parts spread out all over the game, found when looting dead enemies, allowing players to customise their weapons in the pre-deployment menu; the menu also allows equipment loadouts. Stealth mechanics have been reworked. An eye icon squints or opens to denote the player's level of detection by the enemy. Enemy soldiers will also have a circle meter over their heads to indicate alert status. Players are also forced to relocate periodically to prevent detection with a white ghost image to mark their last known position and the enemy will search a wider area. As in the previous game, loud sounds may be used to mask sniper shots. A points system is instituted for actions such as stealth close- combat or sniper kills, with the points accumulating towards promotion to higher ranks. Players can go around the map to collect special reward items such as collectors' cards and unlock sniper nests. Journal pages also provide further backstory into the events of the game. V2s X-Ray kill cam system is retained as well. Where the previous game only shows the body's internal structure at point of impact, the new game expands to visualize the rest of the cardiovascular, skeletal, and muscular systems. The player can still target vehicles, but now has a chance to shoot the engines and disable the vehicle. Multiplayer Multiplayer in Sniper Elite III consists of 5 modes of competitive gameplay; Team deathmatch, Deathmatch, Distance King, No Cross and Capture the flag. There is a large selection of maps to play on with large open environments. Plot In June 1942, during the Battle of Gazala, SOE sniper Karl Fairburne (Tom Clarke-Hill) is sent to assassinate General Franz Vahlen and uncover his top-secret project. He helps British soldiers repel General Erwin Rommel's forces, but ultimately, the port of Tobruk is lost. Fairburne heads to the Gaberoune oasis in Libya to kill several officers and reveal Vahlen's whereabouts. He only finds a document revealing the name of Vahlen's project, Project Seuche (literally meaning plague). The Long Range Desert Group asks for Fairburne's assistance in destroying several Flak 88s in Halfaya Pass. Fairburne's only hope of finding Vahlen is by rescuing a British informant inside Fort Rifugio previously held by the British during Operation Compass. Fairburne successfully infiltrates Fort Rifugio and frees the informant. The man, Brauer, shares intelligence about officers meeting at the Siwa Oasis in Western Egypt. Fairburne, whose sniping has earned him the label Wüstengeist (Desert Ghost) by the Germans, sneaks into the town and finds out that the officers plan to betray Vahlen to Hitler by giving him the general's personal diary in Berlin. Fairburne kills the officer tasked as the courier and steals the book, which details Vahlen's plans to conquer Europe when the Afrika Korps win in North Africa, with his base of operations somewhere in the Kasserine Pass. Fairburne and Brauer infiltrate the base and discover from a secret movie reel that Project Seuche is a supertank codenamed Ratte. Tragically, Brauer is killed by a Tiger tank but Fairburne destroys it in revenge. He buries Brauer and takes a round from Brauer's gun. With the location of the Ratte production facility still unknown, Fairburne joins the LRDG in assaulting the German-controlled Pont du Fahs Airfield and finds a map leading to the facility, which is nestled inside the Mides canyon. He gets inside the complex and prepares satchel charges to collapse the base as well as destroy the Ratte prototype. To trigger the detonation, Fairburne puts an explosive on the Ratte's turret and drops a load of the supertank's massive shells on it. Vahlen is mortally injured trying to escape the hangar and Fairburne takes his Luger, puts Brauer's round in the chamber and kills Vahlen before escaping the base. A voiceover by Fairburne during the end credits reveals that the intelligence he acquired on the Ratte enables the USAAF and the RAF to launch the Battle of the Ruhr. The effect of Operation Chastise on steel production forces the Germans to scrap work on the Ratte. Downloadable content On 21 July 2014, Rebellion Developments announced a new downloadable content (DLC) pack for Sniper Elite III. The DLC pack adds three new missions, one of which the player needs to save Winston Churchill from a German assassination attempt. In the first mission, \\"In Shadows\\", Fairburne must uncover the identity of Churchill's would-be assassins. He does this by sneaking back into the Siwa Oasis in Western Egypt which by this point has been won and lost by the Allies since his last visit. In the process, he learns the identity of the assassins and their leader. In the second mission, \\"Belly of the Beast\\", Fairburne must infiltrate the assassins' base in the Rif mountains in Morocco. Along the way, he uncovers evidence of a dangerous prototype weapon, the plans that describe how the assassination will be carried out, and where it will take place. During the final mission, \\"Confrontation\\", Fairburne must save Churchill from his would-be killers as the Prime Minister heads to the Casablanca Conference. Fairburne must eliminate any and all threats to Churchill including mortars, mines, rocket launchers, tanks, elite German soldiers and a mysterious masked marksman known only as Raubvogel. Other DLCs include new weapon packs. Most of the DLCs were included in the Sniper Elite III Ultimate Edition released in March 2015. (Hunt the Grey Wolf, character and some weapons packs DLC not included.) Reception Sniper Elite III received mixed reviews from critics upon release. Hardcore Gamer Matt Whittaker gave the game a 3/5, writing: \\"Though its stealth-based sniping gameplay can provide some exciting moments, Sniper Elite III is a decidedly mixed bag. Its abysmal narrative, outdated mission design, boring protagonist and weak non-campaign modes overshadow everything that it does well.\\" Tyler Wilde of PC Gamer scored the game a 70/100 and wrote: ”Some of Sniper Elite 3s failures are funny [...] and some of them are frustrating, but its ideas are good and I hope they don't end here. [...] Realistically, I expect we'll have to wait for Sniper Elite 4 for significant improvement.\\" Mikel Reparaz from IGN scored the game an 8.2/10 and wrote: \\"More than just a showcase for slow-motion gore, Sniper Elite III shines for its open-ended approach to stealth.\\" Reparaz disliked the \\"skeletal\\" story and \\"shaky\\" artificial intelligence, but spoke positively of the large levels, \\"enthralling\\" gore, and the freedom given to devise different and diverse tactics. David Roberts from GamesRadar gave the game a 3 out of 5. He too praised the large environments for allowing strategic play, but felt that the Kill-cam, though a cool feature, \\"loses appeal fast\\". Roberts particularly enjoyed the feeling of nailing a perfect shot from a mile away, saying it \\"never gets old\\". Roberts' main problems with the game were concerning an \\"overall lack of polish\\", and the \\"flat narrative\\" and \\"generic objectives\\". \\"Sniper Elite 3 certainly has its share of thrilling moments,\\" Roberts said, \\"whether you’re hunting blissfully unaware soldiers or being tracked by countersnipers in ghillie suits, but there are too many technical and narrative issues to simply ignore.\\" Eurogamer Dan Whitehead wrote in his review: \\"The package as a whole is still very much a rough diamond, but it's a definite improvement over its predecessor. The gruesome kill-cam remains a deliciously wrong thrill and the unifying force that holds the game together, but it's doubtful that it would be enough to paper over the cracks in a fourth game without a major overhaul of the AI and physics code. Even with its flaws, though, Sniper Elite 3 is a solidly enjoyable mid-tier action game. It may not hit the bullseye, but it's getting closer with every shot.\\" Whitehead gave the game a 7/10. Game Informer Tim Turi wrote: \\"I openly admit that I love gory kills and living the hero sniper fantasy, but Sniper Elite III only partially delivers on the latter. If you can't get enough of dramatic, transparent shots of enemies getting shredded by sniper fire, Sniper Elite III has you covered in spades. If you're interested in more motivation beyond the glory of the kill, look elsewhere.\\" Turin scored the game a 6.5/10 and had mixed feeling about the visuals, sound, Kill-cam, and controls. GameSpot Josiah Renaudin gave the game a 6/10. Renaudin disliked the balance between sniping (which he praised) and stealth, opining that the stealth is dull and overstays its welcome. Renaudin called the slow-motion kill-camera \\"devilishly satisfying\\", and praised the colourful environments for being an improvement over the previous games' instalments. Lastly, even though Renaudin thought the story was \\"uninspired\\" and disliked online matchmaking for being \\"broken\\", he too praised the level design for encouraging creativity. Sequel On 7 March 2016, it was confirmed that a sequel, Sniper Elite 4, would be released in 2016 for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. In a blog post dated 10 June 2016, Rebellion co-founders Chris and Jason Kingsley revised the release date to 14 February 2017.

Early life and teaching  Although known for works in Switzerland, Lang grew up in the German state of Württemberg near Frommern. He was the eighth of ten children. In Frommern his father was a pastor and the ministry had been the family's occupation for generations. His father's teachings were highly influential, and from them Heinrich took his understanding of supernatural revelation, and his belief that all people are equal before God. Heinrich and his brothers were taught Latin by their father while preparing for divinity school. Heinrich studied theology in Tübingen, where he was influenced by Ferdinand Christian Baur. In 1840, he graduated from college with honors, continued his education, and began living in a Roman Catholic school where he taught. In 1866, he was promoted and began teaching at a college and living at a monastery. He experienced bouts of melancholy while teaching mathematics, Latin, Greek, and Hebrew, but he said that he was reinvigorated by each new group of students.  Works and ministry  Lang's theology writings got him invited to the Saint Peter Church in Zürich, Switzerland as a pastor, where he served until his death. In 1859, Lang became the editor of the Zeitstimmen für die reformierte Schweiz periodical, which was replaced by Reform in 1872. The Protestáns Society was formed in Hungary in 1860 as a result of Lang's ideas. In 1863, he moved from the bank of Lake Zürich to Meilen. He was invited to the Saint Peter Church in Zürich as a pastor, where Lang served until his death. He died in 1876.

Early career  By 1893 he was a successful businessman in Chicago and earned his first fortune when he obtained a concession to sell soda water soft drinks at the World’s Columbian Exposition. He received the contract by doing a favor for Marshall Field, a member of the Fair’s planning commission. His profit for the summer’s work was $150,000.00. ($3,750,000.00 in 2010). He invested part of that money in Bastedo Tube Company, a pneumatic tube manufacturer whose product is used to deliver messages and money in department stores between floors and departments.EmigrantEntreprenueship.org; Daniel A. Wren and Ronald H. Greenwood, Management Innovators (1988). A sales call in 1895 led to his investment in Sears.  Purchase of Sears  In 1895 Aaron Nusbaum had a meeting with Richard Sears, the co-founder of Sears Roebuck and Company. Nusbaum thought the meeting would involve selling pneumatic tubes to Sears however Richard Sears had other plans. The company was short of cash and Sears offered to sell Nusbaum half of the company for $75,000.00.Gregory D.L. Morris, Financial History, Spring 2007; EmigrantEntreprenueship.org. In 1890 Julius Rosenwald had married Augusta Nusbaum, Aaron’s sister.Sears Archives. Nusbaum asked his brother-in-law if he would be willing to buy a quarter of Sears Roebuck for $37,500.00. Rosenwald agreed and they paid Richard Sears $75,000.00 for one-half interest in Sears Roebuck and Company. The sale took place in 1895EmigrantEntreprenueship.org; Peter M. Aseoli, Julius Rosenwald (2006). and at that time the company was grossing about $800,000.00 a year. By 1900 that figure had grown to $11,000,000.00.Gale Encyclopedia of U.S. Economic History. In 1901 Sears and Rosenwald had a dispute with Nusbaum, bought him out for $1.25 millionEmmet and Jeuck, Catalogues and Counters (1950) pp 47-53 and Nusbaum resigned as Secretary and Treasurer.Encyclopedia.com; Daniel A. Wren and Ronald B. Greenwood, Management Innovators (1988); Gregory D.L. Morris, Financial History, Spring 2007. He was succeeded as Secretary by the Company’s outside lawyer, Albert Henry Loeb of Loeb & Adler (now known as Arnstein & Lehr, LLP) who had prepared the papers for Nusbaum’s departure and had also had structured the original sale to Nusbaum and Rosenwald and the incorporation of Sears in Illinois.Daniel A. Wren and Ronald Greenwood, Management Innovators (1988); EmigrantEntreprenueship.org. The decision to oust Nusbaum was difficult for Rosenwald. Despite repeated attempts by his wife Gussie for reconciliation, Nusbaum never spoke again with his brother-in-law or sister.Julius Rosenwald  Immigrant Entrepreneurship  Later years  After Nusbaum left Sears, he took an extended trip to Europe. On returning, he changed his name to Aaron Norman and his investments added to his wealth.Stephanie Deutsch; You Need a Schoolhouse: Booker T.

The Missal contains a lectionary, a sacramentary and some canonical material (such as a penitential). It was found in Bobbio Abbey in Italy by the Benedictine monk Jean Mabillon between June 4 and June 9 of 1686.Hen and Meens 1. The Missal is the earliest liturgical manuscript surviving from the medieval period. Its specific authorship and provenance is much disputed, though general agreement points to the valley of the Rhône, with Besançon (Mabillon's suggestion) and Vienne given as two popular options. Contents \\"The manuscript is small in format, 180 x 90 mm (130 x 70 mm) with an average of 22 long lines to the page. That is, it is slightly narrower and taller than a modern paperback book. It has the appearance of a chunky (at 300 folios/600 pages) and easily transportable working copy of the crucial mass texts it contains\\".Hen and Meens 22-23. According to E.A. Lowe: \\"The Missal proper is written by one hand, designated as M... the few pages in uncial - the Mass pro principe, written by another hand - are referred to as M2... the pages containing added matter, in two different styles of crude writing, one showing distinct majuscule and the other as distinct minuscule traits, are referred to as A and a\\".Hen and Meens 23.

He cited the collections \\"post nomina\\", \\"ad pacem\\" and the formula of the \\"Contestatio\\" as being characteristic of Gallican Liturgy. He also cited similarities between the Bobbio Missal and the Missale Gothicum/Gallicanum and the Lectionary of Luxeuil. The order of some significant feast days in the Bobbio Missal were also similar to the Gallican tradition; this ruled out the Mozarabic, Ambrosian or Roman traditions. The order of the liturgy in the Bobbio Ambrosian , such as the placement of the scripture readings and the Pax Vobiscum. distinguishes it from the African tradition (here Mabillon quotes St. Augustine to support his deductions).Hen and Meens 9-15. The content of the Missal do not completely match with the contents of the Gothic/Gallican missal. Mabillon explains that liturgy was not uniform in Francia prior to Charlemagne and his reforms. Thus differences between dioceses and even parishes in their liturgy was common. Mabillon dated the Missal to the late 7th century. As proof, he mentions that the name “Bertulfus” was found in the margin of a leaf. That would refer to the Abbot of Bobbio in the mid 7th century.Hen and Meens 9-15. The contents of the Missal listed as collections, readings from the prophets, the apostles and the gospels, contestations of the Mass for the whole year and a penitential. The penitential is particularly of interest to Mabillon, as it increases our understanding of that era.Hen and Meens 9-15. Mabillon states that it is possible the Missal could have come from, and been in use at, Besançon, the location of the Luxeuil Abbey. This is because the Missal includes the mass for St. Sigismund, King of Burgundy. Mabillon states unequivocally that the Missal could not have originated in Bobbio, as it does not refer to or contain any local saints or St. Columbanus and his disciples. In addition, the Missal does not contain monastic materials used at that time in Bobbio by the monks. As the Missal does not contain anything about Columbanus and his disciples, Mabillon’s guesses that St. Columbanus himself may have been involved with the Missal , placing it in the Celtic tradition - but Mabillon does not elaborate on this.Hen and Meens 9-15. The Catholic Encyclopedia (1917) in its entry on the Celtic Rite, lists the Bobbio Missal in its section entitled \\"Manuscript sources - Irish (whether insular or continental)\\".http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03493a.htm Mabillon notes that in the \\"Missa Pro Principe\\" (Mass for the Prince), after the \\"Contestatio\\" in the Canon, the name of the martyr Eugenia is commemorated as well as the other usual saints, this being a unique occurrence. It also happens in the mass for Christmas Eve. This special inclusion of Eugenia could be linked to a province or part of Frankia where a cult of Eugenia was prevalent, but Mabillon knew of no such place.Hen and Meens 13. Mabillon’s title for the manuscript is Sacramentario de Ecclesia Gallicana (Sacramentary of the Gallican Church) - that is, a book about Gallican liturgy. He deemed that more correct than calling it a Gallican Liturgy or a Liturgy from Bobbio, both of which titles refer specifically to books containing only liturgy.Hen and Meens 13. Modern scholarship Many modern scholars consider the Bobbio Missal to be \\"one of the most intriguing liturgical manuscripts from early medieval Francia\\".Hen and Meens 4. The most comprehensive study to date is Yitzhak Hen and Rob Meens’ The Bobbio Missal: liturgy and religious culture in Merovingian Gaul. This book of collected works by international scholars who met in Utrecht in 2001 examines in detail \\"virtually all of the issues that have swirled around the Bobbio missal\\". It was published in 2004, and summarizes the history of scholarship on the manuscript in terms of philology, paleography, Latin spelling and orthography, theology and liturgy amongst other aspects. Rosamond McKitterick suggested that the Missal could have been a gift to a certain priest or bishop, in celebration of his ordination or perhaps a special appointment. She says, \\"the book itself, therefore, may be witness to a complex web of social and pastoral association, and possibly to the relationship between a bishop and his clergy. Such a gift... would most likely have been a working copy, designed for constant reference and use\\".Hen and Meens 51. McKitterick also indicated that the additions to the Missal, which occurred at a later time, may have been added by members of the community in which the book was used, for practical purposes.Hen and Meens 51. McKitterick agrees with Mabillon on the origin of the manuscript in Provençal or somewhere in South-East France, around the late 7th/early 8th century, and that it was not designed for use in a monastic community.Hen and Meens 51. David Ganz reports that the script in the Bobbio Missal is the \\"earliest true minuscule, a script which allowed scribes to save space without sacrificing legibility\\".Hen and Meens 59. Marco Mostert, building on E.A. Lowe’s division of the script into four characteristic styles of writing - M, M2, a and A - asserts that three of these styles were meant to be read aloud: \\"Having considered the punctuation and word spacing of the oldest quires, we have found the conventions of M to be consistent with those of late antique (liturgical) books meant for reading aloud by a native speaker of Latin - even if the consistency of the punctuation may leave something to be desired... M2 follows M’s conventions, as did A. The scribe of a, however, does not seem to have meant his texts to be read aloud (or performed) by anyone but himself\\".Hen and Meens 66. Charles and Roger Wright note that additions were made to the Bobbio Missal - that is, texts were added some time afterward by a subsequent scribe, notably the sermon \\"De Dies Malus\\" and an untitled question/answer dialogue primarily regarding biblical and ecclesiastical history. The somewhat confusing grammatical state of these texts may have been due to the scribe’s intention to utilize them as a basis or template for reading aloud, and thus was not designed to have been grammatically accurate.Hen and Meens 136-139. Yitzak Hen hypothesizes, along with Lowe, that the Bobbio Missal was created by an individual in his private capacity for practical purposes, and that its small size indicates it traveled with its owner: \\"Judging from the script and the manuscript layout, it is well justified to describe the Bobbio Missal as a vade mecum of a Merovingian clergyman...It seems, therefore, safe to conclude that the Bobbio Missal is indeed a vade mecum of a bishop or even a priest, who offered liturgical services to secular, clerical and monastic communities...its unique and practical selections of prayers and benedictions supports this conclusion. A sacramentary like the Bobbio Missal would have been inadequate for the liturgical celebration in a Merovingian episcopal church\\".Hen and Meens 152-53. A facsimile volume of the Bobbio Missal was produced for the Henry Bradshaw Society by E. A. Lowe in 1917 and an edition of the text in 1920.

Fictional biography=Backstory Richard was a sharpshooter in the US Army during World War I. He was badly disfigured during the war, losing his eye, upper jaw and most of the cheekbone on the left side of his face. He has also suffered some throat damage which causes him to speak in a low, muffled voice. Because of his appearance, Harrow wears a tin mask in public that is molded to mirror the intact right side of his face. After the war he returned to Plover, Wisconsin where his twin sister, Emma (Katherine Waterston), cared for him while his wounds healed. Once he was able to care for himself he left to live in Chicago. Season 1 Richard meets fellow veteran Jimmy Darmody (Michael Pitt) in an army hospital in Chicago, and they become fast friends. To prove his loyalty, Richard kills a local gangster who had disfigured a young prostitute with whom Jimmy was close. Jimmy invites Richard to stay with him and his family, and brings him on as muscle in his bootlegging outfit. Richard accompanies Jimmy back to New Jersey, where he becomes a hit man working for Jimmy under Nucky Thompson (Steve Buscemi). After an attempt on Nucky by the D'Alessio brothers, Richard temporarily moves into the Thompson home where he acts as a bodyguard to Nucky, his companion Margaret Schroeder (Kelly Macdonald) and her two small children. At first Margaret and her children are frightened by Richard's appearance, but they eventually warm up to him. After a truce is made between Nucky and Arnold Rothstein to resolve their conflict, Richard, Jimmy and Al Capone are dispatched to assassinate the remaining D'Alessio brothers. Season 2 Richard is now established as the right- hand man on Jimmy's bootlegging crew. Jimmy and Richard have now gone into business with Charlie \\"Lucky\\" Luciano (Vincent Piazza), Meyer Lansky (Anatol Yusef) and Al Capone (Stephen Graham). Richard has also moved into the Darmody household, where he befriends Jimmy's wife Angela (Aleksa Palladino). Angela, a painter, asks Richard if she can do his portrait; he reluctantly agrees. During their session, Richard confides in Angela that he and his sister have not spoken since he left home. Richard then voluntarily removes his mask, and she paints his portrait. Richard ventures out into a secluded forest during a Remembrance Day memorial, intending to commit suicide. As he puts a shotgun in his mouth, a hunter's dog runs off with his tin mask. Richard chases the dog, and finds two hunters sitting around a campfire, who convince him to keep on living. Richard serves as Jimmy's lieutenant throughout a turf war with Nucky, and remains loyal even as they suffer serious financial losses. Richard is devastated when Angela is murdered by Manny Horvitz (William Forsythe) as revenge for an attempt by Jimmy to kill him over a $5,000 debt Jimmy refused to pay him, and begins to wonder if their business is worth the price they pay. To mend fences with Nucky, Richard and Jimmy go to Alderman James Neary (Robert Clohessy), scheduled to testify against Nucky, force him to type a note at gunpoint exonerating Nucky, then Richard shoots him in the head and stages his death as a suicide. When Nucky calls Jimmy and says they have captured Horvitz, both Jimmy and Richard sense a trap, and Richard offers to go along. Jimmy refuses, however, and tells Richard to live a good life. After Jimmy is murdered, Richard moves in with Jimmy's mother Gillian (Gretchen Mol) at her estate. Season 3 One year later, Richard is a permanent resident in Gillian's brothel. Richard now acts as a caretaker at the brothel, and looks after Jimmy's son Tommy. Richard also seeks vengeance on Manny Horvitz, who has now become a partner in Nucky's gang, for Angela's death. On New Year's Eve, Richard waits outside Manny's house, and after killing Manny's driver, shoots Manny in the face with a shotgun as he opens the door to leave. Richard ventures off one evening to a veteran's legion for support and to discuss compensation which has been promised to wounded veterans. It's here that Richard meets Paul Sagorsky (Mark Borkowski), a bitter drunk who lost his son in the war. Richard looks after Paul when he is injured in a bar fight, and meets Paul's daughter Julia (Wrenn Schmidt). He falls in love with her, and they begin a courtship, despite her father's objections. Later in the season, Gillian's brothel is occupied by New York gangster Gyp Rosetti (Bobby Cannavale), who is at war with Nucky. Fearing for Tommy's safety, Richard attempts to remove the boy to Julia's house, but Gillian finds out about the plan and, angered, she has Rosetti's men kick Richard out. After Joe Masseria withdraws his support for Rosetti's campaign against Nucky, his hired goons withdraw from the brothel, giving an opening for Richard to arm himself and methodically kill almost everyone in Rosetti's own gang (save for Rosetti himself, his right-hand Tonino Sandrelli, and two other guards), recovering Tommy, whom he leaves at the Sagorsky home. Richard then flees Atlantic City. Season 4 One year later, Richard makes his way to his childhood home in Wisconsin to visit Emma. Richard returns home to find Emma widowed, pregnant and in debt. During his visit with his sister, Richard finds it difficult to put down the family dog. During this time Richard is tracked down by a former client who had hired Richard previously to carry out an assassination contract that was not honored. They corner Richard in the barn; during the ensuing struggle, Richard kills one of the gangsters, but the other one breaks Richard's hand and nearly kills him. Emma arrives just in time and kills the gangster, saving Richard's life. Richard realizes he is a danger to his sister and decides to go back to Atlantic City. Upon returning to Atlantic City, Richard bumps into Sagorsky, who is dying of cirrhosis of the liver. Richard finds out that Julia is locked in a custody battle with Gillian over Tommy. Richard returns to the Sagorskys' home to help Julia, whom he marries. To provide for his new family, Richard gets a job washing dishes at the Onyx Club, with the help of Nucky. When Gillian is arrested for murder, Richard and Julia see an opportunity to get permanent custody of Tommy. Gillian claims that the body found on her estate was that of her son, Jimmy, and with the body having been cremated, there is no way to prove otherwise. In order to undermine her story, Richard asks Nucky for the location where Jimmy's body is actually buried. Nucky agrees to tell Richard, but for a price: he must eliminate New York gangster Dr. Valentin Narcisse (Jeffrey Wright), who is causing problems for Nucky and his associate Chalky White (Michael K. Williams). As he prepares to shoot Narcisse, he hesitates and his hand shakes, and he accidentally kills White's daughter Maybelle (Christina Jackson) when she unexpectedly steps into the line of fire. Richard is mortally wounded in the ensuing gunfire, but manages to make his way to the Atlantic City Boardwalk, where he dies. His dying visions show him returning to the farm in Wisconsin to meet his entire family, with his face complete and healed.  Interview  Jack Huston was interviewed by Rolling Stone magazine. Huston stated that he was told that his character was going to die on the episode of Harrow's death. Huston stated that it was very appropriate for Harrow, a tragic character, to die tragically. Being honored instead of upset about the ending, Huston claimed that the writers wrote \\"the most unbelievably beautiful ending, and it made so much sense.\\" Glad to have played a longer-than- initially-expected role in Boardwalk Empire, Huston stated that it was the start of his career in acting. Terence Winter said that if Harrow was not fatally wounded after shooting Maybelle, then Harrow would have committed suicide. Huston agrees that Harrow would have done that, for fact of killing Maybelle would be unforgivable in Harrow's mind. Huston stated that at first \\"Richard was a brilliant killer\\"; then he gives up killing, losing confidence; later, he was intuitive and expected himself to err; after shooting Maybelle he hesitates, allowing himself to be shot. Huston posited that Harrow's scrapbook became a reality: he fell in love, married, and had a family. Regarding Harrow's vision at the end of his life, Huston stated \\"In a way he reached heaven in his life.\\" ReferencesExternal links * Richard Harrow at HBO.com * Richard Harrow on IMDb Category:Boardwalk Empire Category:Fictional assassins Category:Fictional gangsters Category:Fictional World War I veterans Category:Television characters introduced in 2010 Category:Fictional characters from Wisconsin Category:Drama television characters Category:Fictional characters with disfigurements Category:Fictional attempted suicides Category:American male characters in television ","title":"Richard Harrow"},{"id":"41072874","text":"Hag ha-Gez or Re´shit ha-Gez was the biblical festival or celebration of the shearing of the sheep. Hag ha-Gez took place once a year, at the beginning of the spring, once the winter cold was gone. Although lacking the liturgical importance of the pilgrim festivals related to the harvest of cereals at the beginning of the agricultural season or to the harvest of grapes and the ingathering of fruits at the end of the period, the shearing of the sheep was, nonetheless, a memorable convivium that brought together people of different localities to enjoy banquets \\"fit for royalty\\". The \\"first fruits of the shearing of the flock\\" were entitlements of the priests, just as it were the first fruits of grain, wine and oil and portions of the animals sacrificed. No specific celebration of the shearing of the sheep takes place in present-day Israel (The attempts at kibbutzim to introduce any new kind of agricultural festival of secular nature haven't succeeded). The possibility exists, however, that Lag BaOmer, a joyful celebration of obscure origin and forgotten meaning, observed since Geonic times in mid-spring and in which highly religious Jews give their three-year-old boys their first haircut, could somehow echo the ancient event.

It is not a chasse-marée but the two types have much in common; the main difference being that here there are shafts for a single horse. In medieval France a chasse-marée was a cart designed to carry fresh fish to inland markets, with a minimum of weight put into construction and provision for harnessing four horses. The medieval French chasse-marée merchants originally catered to the demand for fresh fish in inland markets by carrying fish in pairs of baskets on pack ponies, as far as possible, overnight. However, the distance coverable before the fish deteriorated was limited. Later, where the quality of the road permitted, the range might be extended by the use of charrettes (carts). When designed for this trade, with a minimum of weight put into their construction and provision for harnessing the four horses, these vehicles took the name of chasse-marée. As speed was essential, they were normally hauled by two pairs of horses rather than the single horse which is normal for a cart. The vehicle took the form of two wheels, of a diameter large enough to minimize the slowing effect of bumps in the road. On their axle was mounted an open rectangular frame within which were slung the baskets holding the fish, packed in seaweed. More baskets were stacked above.The picture at bottom left on this web page shows some waiting for the marée at a Norman fish quay in the early twentieth century. The top picture here shows one if full flight when it could sustain 15 kilometres per hour from one posting station to the next. The teams of usually fairly small horses were worked hard and changed at posting stations in the same way as those of mail coaches. Compare the routes for mail coaches and chasse-marées in the bottom two sections of this web page. The coast supplying Paris by road was originally, that which was nearest to its market, around Le Tréport and Saint- Valery-sur-Somme. At its most developed, it extended from Fécamp to Calais including such places as Dieppe, Boulogne-sur-Mer and Étaples. Some horse lovers have been attracted to the idea of driving a version of the chasse- marée carts, as a recreation.R&B; Presse – equestrianism press agency.

The Institute established the FCIP curriculum in the 1950s. During the late 1970s, the program was revised by approving a set of university based subjects for the program. FCIP candidates then took any of these approved courses, which were offered primarily through the continuing education departments of universities. The FCIP Program was re-launched in 2010. The current FCIP program includes six courses, developed at a post-degree level, that are tailored specifically to the Canadian p&c; sector. The Institute developed the current FCIP in collaboration with senior industry executives and academics from business schools The virtual program is designed to provide a comprehensive, insurance- focused understanding of strategic leadership and advanced management techniques, leading to the FCIP designation.

Institute History 1899 – John B. Laidlaw, manager of the Norwich Union Fire Insurance Society in Canada, contacted insurance managers across Canada to create an insurance institute in Canada like the institutes being formed in Great Britain in the late 1870s. Two hundred and thirty industry representatives responded,forming to the Insurance Institute of Toronto. 1900 – The Insurance Institute of Montreal formed. 1920s – The Insurance Institute of British Columbia and the Insurance Institute of Winnipeg were established. 1931 – President of the Insurance Institute of Toronto, W.H. Burgess, first raised the idea of a national institute. 1947 – The Insurance Institute of Toronto became the Insurance Institute of Ontario. 1952 – All institutes joined in association with The Insurance Institute of Canada to establish a uniform standard of insurance education and examinations. The first president of the Insurance Institute, Norman G. Bethune, outlined the following three major objectives for the organization in the President's Address to The First Annual Meeting of the Insurance Institute of Canada: *The standardization of insurance education across Canada, with a uniform syllabus, uniform examinations, and consequently equal standing for all graduates regardless of education. *A sound and equitable basis of company support of Insurance Institute work. *To provide means of insurance education in other parts of Canada where it is needed.

Author  Photo of Pedro Américo (date and photographer unknown). Pedro Américo was born in 1843, in the Paraíba Province of Brazil, more specifically in the now city of Areia, at the time the small town of Brejo d'Areia. Since his youth, he showed a vocation for painting, being ten years old when he participated as a drawer of flora and fauna in an scientific expedition through Northeastern Brazil lead by the French naturalist Louis Jacques Brunet. At approximately 13 years old, he entered the Imperial Academy of Fine Arts, in the city of Rio de Janeiro. His performance at the Academy made him known even to the emperor D. Pedro II, who sponsored a trip to Paris and studies at the École nationale supérieure des Beaux-Arts, where the artist perfected his style, mainly in historical painting. His most famous work, Independence or Death (Portuguese: ), was shown for the first time in the Accademia di Belle Arti di Firenze (\\"academy of fine arts of Florence\\") in 1888-04-08. After going to Brazil, remaining there for a few years, he returned to Florence, where he died in 1905.  Context = Pre-execution agreements  Contrarily to what is speculated, Pedro Américo was not invited to execute the painting dedicated to independence: the artist himself offered to do it. In 1885, according to records made by imperial adviser Joaquim Inácio Ramalho, Américo declared to the commission of works, that he would charge himself with making a historical painting in memory of the glorious act of Prince Regent Pedro I, proclaiming Brazilian independence. Américo's proposal was not immediately accepted, due to a lack of funds and the architecture of the building that would in the future become the Museu Paulista. In December of the same year, the newspaper A Província de São Paulo published an article criticising the government's behaviour, accusing it of giving false hopes to the artist, considered at the time a master of aesthetics. It's believed that those provocations made by the media contributed to a change in the position of the commission responsible for accepting or refusing Américo's proposal. By the end of December 1885, Ramalho writes a letter to Pedro Américo accepting his proposal. In a contract signed in 1886-07-14 between Pedro Américo e Ramalho, at the time president of the Commission of the Monument to the Independence of Brazil, the artist committed himself to painting, accordingly to the description of the documents, a \\"commemorative historical painting of the proclamation of independence by the prince regent D. Pedro in the fields of Ypiranga\\" (Portuguese: . The deadline for the painting of the work would be three years, and Américo would be paid thirty contos de réis, in addition to the six that the artist received when he signed the contract, money destined to the first studies and preparatory activities for the work. Entirely painted in Florence, it was finished a year before due, in 1888.  History  Representation of the painting on the Monument to the Independence of Brazil. The artist Pedro Américo finished the painting in 1888 in Florence, Italy, 66 years after the proclamation of independence. The Brazilian imperial house commissioned the work, due to investments into the construction of the Museu do Ipiranga (presently the Museu Paulista). The goal of the artwork was to emphasize the monarchy.  Controversy  There exists evidence that the painting is not an accurate description of the events on the shores of the Ipiranga Brook.  Plagiarism accusation = Pedro Américo as a copier  Napoleon III at the Battle of Solferino by Jean-Louis-Ernest Meissonier, painting that inspired Independência ou Morte. The painting by Pedro Américo can be compared with other works made by different artists. That resulted in plagiarism accusations to the painter. In his work, Américo creates a dialogue between art history and the traditional battle paintings that emphasised the hero (previously made by his teachers). The process of making the painting was complex. The dialogue with historical paintings was well regarded by the Imperial Academy of Fine Arts, in addition to being a technique used by many artists, without being considered a copy. He intended to develop an image that reminded of those works from the past accordingly to the techniques that were used by those artists. The experience he had 10 years earlier, with his work Batalha do Avaí, that was not well received by critics, classifying it as \\"anti- academical\\" (Portuguese: ), made him study in more depth aesthetic topics and publish the literary work Discurso Sobre o Plágio na Literatura e na Arte (Discourse On Plagiarism in Literature and Art) in 1879, years before beginning Independência ou Morte. The works by French painters Jean-Louis Ernest Meissonier and Horace Vernet were used as sources for Independência ou Morte. Américo studied the works Napoleon III at the Battle of Solferino (1863) and 1807, Friedland (), both by Meissonier and also Bataille de Friedland, 14 juin 1807 (), by Vernet. There are similarities between the paintings: the confrontation between D. Pedro and the soldiers to the right has composition similar to the structure of 1807, Friedland: the concentration of people in both paintings is similar; the elevation of D. Pedro to a higher point in the topography approaches the work of Américo to those of Meissonier. In addition, it can be deduced that Américo wished to portray D. Pedro as a statesman, as can be noticed when analysing the figure of Napoleon in the work of Meissonier. 1807, Friedland, another painting by Meissonier that inspired Independência ou Morte. The historian Lilia Moritz Schwarcz quotes in his book Batalha do Avaí – A Beleza da Barbárie (Battle of Avaí - The Beauty of Barbarism), that the critics of the work by Pedro Américo saw in both A Batalha do Avaí, as in Independência ou Morte, two \\"brazen\\" (Portuguese: ) cases of plagiarism of the painters Andrea Appiani and Ernest Meissonier, respectively. According to the historian, the critics saw in Independência ou Morte, a whole scene copy of 1807, Friedland, painted thirteen years earlier by Meissonier, \\"in which he also portrays Napoleon, a polyvalent figure that serves as a model for Américo to paint both Caxias and D. Pedro I, this one giving the cry of independence at the bank of the Ipiranga\\" (Portuguese: ). Bataille de Friedland, 14 juin 1807, a painting by Horace Vernet that inspired Independência ou Morte. According to the art historian Maraliz de Castro, the work by Américo has major differences from the paintings by Meissonier, saying the Brazilian concerns himself with every detail, searching for a balance between all the elements, with the goal of creating a significant impression of unity, while in Napoleon III at the Battle of Solferino, the Frenchman wished to simulate a instantaneous photography of reality differently from the carefully organised figures in Independência ou Morte. According to Maraliz, another difference is the movement in the painting by Meissonier: the soldiers run frenetically in direction to the viewer; however Américo composes a form in elipsis to make up all the characters of the scene, uniting them to the use of perspective. In the other hand, according to the art historian Cláudia Valladão, these details reaffirm the traditional values of Américo, as however he agreed with the group of theoreticians at the time called \\"idealists\\", his artistic position was directed at a dialogue with the \\"realist\\" tendencies of historical painting, as used by a variety of artists at the time, for example Meissonier. There was also an contemporary accusation of plagiarism published in 1982 by the journalist Elio Gaspari, in his column in the magazine Veja, also refuted by Cláudia Valladão, that comments on the publication: \\"accusing Pedro Américo of plagiarism is not understand the assumptions of his art\\" (Portuguese: .  Inspiration pictures  Pedro Américo used some historical paintings as references to compose the artwork Independência ou Morte. A Proclamação da Independência, by François-René Moreau. Comparing Américo's painting with A Proclamação da Independência by François-René Moreaux, one realizes that the latter includes many more civilians than the Brazilian in his artwork. The characters in Moreaux's painting look at the sky. Consequently, the emperor is portrayed as a figure fulfilling a divine will by proclaiming independence, not as someone with leadership and political abilities, as done by Américo. Retrato de Deodoro da Fonseca, by Henrique Bernardelli, also portrays a proclamation in an idealized manner. In contrast, the works Independência ou Morte and Retrato de Deodoro da Fonseca from the painter Henrique Bernardelli (which represents the officer declaring the end of the monarchy and the beginning of the republic in Brazil) complete one another: both complied to the interests of the 1889 republic and reaffirmed that historical changes in Brazil were marked by heroes and grandiose events. They illustrate independence and are effective in its propaganda, even if they don't question the new Brazilian autonomy with veracity. Furthermore, Bernardelli's painting portrays the event in an epic and idealized manner, as in Pedro Américo's artwork. Deodoro, in reality, was sick and constantly bed- ridden, with a chronic lack of air caused by Arteriosclerosis. Accordingly to reports by the lawyer Francisco Glicério, who participated in the Proclamation of the Republic, the marshal barely had enough strength to put on his uniform. Unlike what is shown in the painting, he was weak and staggering, not being able to stay on top of his horse.  Legacy = Diffusion in didactic books, monuments and digital media  The painting by Pedro Américo appears constantly in Brazilian didactic books, therefore becoming a \\"canonical image\\" (Portuguese: ) in the teaching of history in Brazil. A study with children has shown that in part due to the influence of the illustrations in didactic books, they represented the act of independence inspired by the graphical reference of Independência ou Morte. In the books, the painting is used to illustrate the act of founding the Brazilian nationality, showing that the transition to independence is the result of a cry. That common interpretation, represents the cry of Ipiranga as a direction, in a personalised act and centralised in the monarch. The importance of the work by Pedro Américo, the official portrayal of independence, resulted in it influencing other works, among which the pediment of the Monument to the Independence of Brazil, which emulates the work of Américo. The painting by Pedro Américo is part of the collection available in the project Google Arts & Culture. The work was digitalised as a gigapixel image with Google's Art Camera, to record details in the work that are imperceptible to the naked eye. Independência ou Morte is the largest painting to be digitalised by Google in Brazil.  Influence on painting  The work by Pedro Américo became the reference, sometimes to be deconstructed, of the portrayal of Brazilian Independence. Creating an alternate version to that of the heroism and triumphalism of Dom Pedro, portrayed by Américo, set the tone, for example, for the production of highlighted works in expositions celebrating the Independence Centenary, as (Session of the State Council) , by Georgina de Albuquerque, and (First hearing of Independence Anthem), by Augusto Bracet. In the painting by Albuquerque, the protagonist of the declaration of independence becomes Maria Leopoldina, in a scene where she is shown deliberating with the Council of the Attorneys-general of the Provinces of Brazil the direction to Dom Pedro to end the colonisation of Brazil by Portugal; in the painting by Bracet, Dom Pedro appears as the protagonist of the separation from Portugal, but in a domestic setting and in a jovial attitude, composing the (Independence Anthem).

Random House, New York. . Sackson wrote that he created the game because of his distaste for traditional solitaire games in which a red 9 is placed on a black 10. Besides being popular with modern hobby gamers,Thomson, Neil (2014). Sid Sackson's Bowling Solitaire - A Detailed Review. BoardGameGeek. Retrieved 16 October 2020. Bowling Solitaire has been published as a separate game, and has also been implemented with a digital port.Sohn, Sebastian (2013). Tabletop Tuesdays: A Smarter Solitaire, Play This Thing. Retrieved via Internet Archive 16 October 2020. Rules Setup: Bowling Solitaire uses the Ace through 10 from two suits. From a shuffled pile of these 20 cards, ten cards representing the \\"pins\\" are randomly placed face-up in the same pattern as the pins are arranged for a normal game of ten pin bowling. Three \\"bowling ball\\" piles of face-down cards (five, three, and two cards respectively) are also dealt. Game-play: The top card of all bowling ball piles is turned face up, one of which is selected to \\"bowl\\" at the ten face-up pins. A single pin card can be removed if it matches the number on this ball card. Alternatively two or three pin cards that are adjacent can be removed if the final digit of their total value corresponds to the value of the bowling ball card used. Some restrictions apply (e.g. you can't use the very first ball card played to knock over any pins in the back row; pins knocked over must be adjacent). The next card in the bowling ball pile used is turned face up, and another of the three face-up bowling ball cards is used in the same manner, until no further plays are possible. Scoring: Removing all ten pins in this way counts as a strike, and concludes the frame. If a strike is not achieved, the top cards from all the ball piles are discarded, and play continues by turning over new cards on each of the piles. This action represents using a second bowling ball. Successfully removing all ten pins with these new cards also concludes the frame and counts as a spare. In the event all ten pins are not knocked over with this continued play, and if no further moves are possible, the frame is concluded with the number of pins removed representing the number of pins knocked over. To begin a new frame, the 20 cards are shuffled and the process is repeated. A complete game consists of ten such frames. Scoring otherwise works exactly the same as it does in actual ten pin bowling. Versions  Although Bowling Solitaire was created to be a solitaire game played with a standard deck of playing cards, its popularity led to a version with custom cards.Bowling Solitaire Game Rules, UltraBoardGames.

Retrieved 15 October 2020. It has subsequently been implemented on several websites and programs that implement digital versions of solitaire games. The object of the game is to try to fill as many Pins as possible for each of the ten frames. Rules Setup: Bowling has ten \\"Pin Piles\\". Two \\"Ball Piles\\" located below the deck can contain up to three cards each. The scoring frame is located either above or below the gameplay. Game-play: To begin playing, turn up one card at a time from the deck. The card turned up must be planted on one of the Pin Piles, or placed onto one of the Ball Piles. All the Pin Piles should be filled in order from lowest ranking cards (towards the bottom) to the highest ranking cards (towards the top right). There are only ten Pins, but there are thirteen ranks of cards. The difficult part of this game is anticipating what ranks will not be drawn from the Deck. Here is an example of a possible arrangement: 9 _ Q K 5 _ 7 2 4 A Only a ten or a Jack can be placed onto the empty Pin between the nine and Queen. Only a six can fill the empty space between the five and seven. Place multiple cards of the same rank into the same piles. If a three or an eight is drawn, they must be put in the Ball Pile because it cannot be placed with the Pins. Scoring: Bowling Solitaire is scored the same way regular ten-pin bowling is scored. To get a strike, fill all the Pins before placing a card in the Ball Pile. To receive a spare, fill all Pins before placing cards into the second Ball Pile. Otherwise, points are scored by the amount of spaces filled before both Ball Piles are filled. After both Ball Piles have been filled with three cards each, that round of the game will end. The game consists of ten rounds.

This building was one of the first buildings in Prague built from pre- stressed concrete and brick panels. It was built in less than a year and includes a \\"lighthouse\\" tower topped with symbol of Hussite church, a chalice and a cross. History The Hus' House was built in 1930 using the novel material of pre-stressed concrete. The beginning of that build began with the formation of a committee in 1921 to create this church.History of the Hussite Church, husuvsbor.cz, retrieved 13 November 2013 The land for the building had previously been used for a coaching inn and a blacksmith. The emerging local Hussite group received national recognition in 1923 and their work led to the appointment of Karel Truksta. Truksta was an architect trained in Prague and it was his role to not only make the design but also the specification for builders to quote for the work. Vaclav Nekvasil built the church in less than a year An unusual foundation stone was laid on 29 September 1929, as the stone had an association with the church reformer Jan Hus who had been burnt for his beliefs in 1415. The stone came from Kozí Hrádek castle near Sezimovo Ústí where Hus had preached of his ideas that led to the formation of the Hussite Church. The main contractor was the builder Václav Nekvasil who was told in March 1930 that they needed to complete the build that year. This was achieved on 21 December when the opening was celebrated.Church of Jan Hus Congregation in Vršovice, praha.eu, retrieved 14 November 2013 The design included a theatre that seated almost 300 people with space for an orchestra, dressing rooms and make-up and offices. Other activities in the building include a film club, lectures and other cultural activities. The theatre brings in an income and the multi-function building also included accommodation for pensioners and part of the space is let to the branch of a bank. This income pays for maintaining the building and its columbarium as well as contributing to the wider aims of the church.Husův sbor ve Vršovicích - od Jiráska k neonu, 2009, retrieved 13 November 2012 The building and tower An Alois Jirásek Theatre was based here although Jirásek had died in 1930. The theatre group was so successful that they credit the closing of the nearby theatre in Vinohrady to their success. The company became known for plays and for opera. The theatre closed in the 1960s due to pressures from the communist authorities who were unhappy with a religious body being involved with a theatre. There have been attempts to relaunch the theatre but the city have said that a prospective company would need to find external funding. The design of the tower was a collaboration with Pavel Janák who designed the other nearby Hussite church in Vinohrady.MANA Theatre presents, husiti.cz, retrieved 14 November 2013 It is topped at by a chalice which is a key symbol of the Hussite church as well as a cross.

Rovello bianco was first described growing in the Campanian province of Avellino in 1875 where it was locally known as Greco Muscio. Despite the similarities in synonyms, DNA profiling in the early 21st century has shown that Rovello bianco has no known genetic relationship with the either the white or dark berried Greco grapes or any of the other Italian varieties (such as Maceratino, Grechetto, Pignoletto, Fortana and Erbaluce) that share Greco as a synonym. Like many Italian varieties, the phylloxera epidemic of the late 19th century followed by the political and economic turmoil of the 20th century World Wars saw a dramatic decrease in plantings that almost lead to the variety's extinction. But a collaboration between the Universities of Palermo and Naples Federico II along with the help of a local Taurasi wine grower lead to new plantings of Rovello bianco in 2003. Wine regions Rovello bianco is found almost exclusively in the province of Avellino in Campania. In the communes of Taurasi, Bonito and Mirabella Eclano centenarian old vine plantings of the variety still exist and are used in commercial wine production. Styles Varietal examples of Rovello bianco are sometimes described as having a \\"green citrus fruit\\" note.

It was published on 8 October 2013, by Weidenfeld & Nicolson in the UK and Little, Brown and Company in the US. The book details the early life of Yousafzai, her father's ownership of schools and activism, the rise and fall of the Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan in Swat Valley and the assassination attempt made against Yousafzai, when she was aged 15, following her activism for female education. It has received a positive critical reception and won awards, though it has been banned in many schools in Pakistan. Synopsis Part One covers Malala Yousafzai's life \\"Before the Taliban\\". She describes her childhood home Swat Valley. Named for Malalai of Maiwand, Yousafzai lived with her father Ziauddin, her mother Toor Pekai and two younger brothers Khushal and Atal. Ziauddin's father Rohul Amin was an imam and a teacher. Ziauddin studied a Master's in English at Jehanzeb College. He opened the Khushal School with a partner Naeem, who later left due to financial difficulties. Ziauddin found a new partner Hidayatullah, with whom the school slowly began to make a profit. As Ziauddin began to open more schools, Toor Pekai would bring children in need to live with them and Ziauddin would give free places in his schools to poor children. Yousafzai describes the changing political regimes in Pakistan, the first drone strikes in Pakistan in 2004 following the September 11 attacks. Part Two, \\"The Valley of Death\\", details the rise of the Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan in Swat. In 2006, Fazlullah began a popular \\"Radio Mullah\\" broadcast which initially gave advice on such matters as ritual ablutions and drug abstinence, but progressed into the condemnation of music and dancing, and instruction on women staying in the home. The book also describes the continuing War in North-West Pakistan, and the return of Benazir Bhutto in Pakistan which culminated in her assassination. The Taliban began to commit further murders such as that of Shabana, and Ziauddin Yousafzai continued outspoken activism. During the First Battle of Swat, Malala begins to write a BBC Urdu blog under the pseudonym \\"Gul Mukai\\". Her school is shut down following a Taliban edict in 2009, and her family are forced to move to Shangla for three months. Part Three is entitled \\"Three Bullets,Three Girls\\". By August 2009, the army have fought off the Taliban in Swat, and the Yousafzai family return. Malala's school re-opens, and she visits Islamabad with school friends, meeting with Major General Athar Abbas and giving a public speech. With her father, Yousafzai speaks at many interviews, critical of the Taliban and the army's ineffectiveness. The 2010 Pakistan floods devastate Swat, destroying buildings and leaving many without food, clean water and electricity. In the rest of the country, CIA agent Raymond Davis murders two men and the Americans kill bin Laden, leading to widespread mistrust of American influence in Pakistan by the public. In late 2011, Yousafzai begins to receive prizes for her activism. She travels to Karachi to talk to Geo TV, also visiting the mausoleum of Muhammad Ali Jinnah. Yousafzai receives death threats, which worries her parents. Following the shooting of Zahid Khan in August 2012, Ziauddin expected to be targeted next. Malala also begins to fear an attack on her. She revises hard for her exams, staying up late at night. After her Pakistan Studies paper on 9 October, two men stop her bus and come aboard. One shouts \\"Who is Malala?\\" and shoots three bullets. Part Four is named \\"Between Life and Death\\". One bullet travelled from Yousafzai's left eye to her shoulder, and her friends Shazia and Kainat were also non-fatally injured. Yousafzai's father gave a speech with the Association of Private Schools before rushing to the hospital, while Yousafzai's mother was learning to read and rushed home to pray. Malala was taken by helicopter to the Combined Military Hospital in Peshawar and then airlifted to a military hospital in Rawalpindi. Yousafzai was taken on 15 October to Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham, aboard a United Arab Emirates jet, but her father refused to come as the rest of the family could not travel without passports. Part Five is called \\"A Second Life\\". Yousafzai woke up in Birmingham on 16 October, and spent the following days obsessed with the location of her father, and not being able to afford medical treatment, though the Pakistani government was covering costs. Yousafzai received 8000 cards and many presents. When she awoke, she was confused about all the cards she had received, as there was supposed to be a news blackout in Pakistan so no one would know anything had happened to her or where she was being taken, but someone had seen her being flown out to the UK, and word got around quickly. Her family finally arrived on 25 October. The day her family got to the hospital was also the first day since arriving in Birmingham that she had any access to windows. Malala had not seen the city she was being kept in for 10 days. She underwent surgery on 11 November to repair her facial nerve; in January 2013, she was discharged, and in February she received surgery to get a cochlear implant. Yousafzai lives in Birmingham, though she misses Swat, and plans to continue her activism so she can be known not as \\"the girl who was shot by the Taliban\\" but as \\"the girl who fought for education\\". Reception According to Publishers Weekly, in 2017 the book had sold almost 2 million copies, and there were 750,000 copies of the children's edition in print. In March 2018, The Bookseller reported that 328,000 copies of the book had been sold in the UK, netting over £2.47 million. Accolades *2013 Specsavers National Book Awards, Popular Non-Fiction Book of the Year *2013 Goodreads Choice Awards, Best Memoir & Autobiography *2014 Political Book Awards, Finalist, Political Book of the Year Critical reviews Sayeeda Warsi, writing for The Daily Telegraph, giving the book four stars out of five, wrote \\"Malala has turned a tragedy into something positive\\". Entertainment Weekly gave the book a \\"B+\\", writing \\"Malala's bravely eager voice can seem a little thin here, in I Am Malala, likely thanks to her co-writer, but her powerful message remains undiluted.\\" Metro list the book as one of the \\"20 best non-fiction books of 2013\\", praising that Yousafzai's story is \\"one of idealism and stubborn courage\\". In The Observer, the reviewer Yvonne Roberts praised Lamb for ensuring \\"the teenager's voice is never lost\\", and summarises that \\"this extraordinary schoolgirl's words are a reminder of all that is best in human nature\\". Fatima Bhutto in The Guardian called the book \\"fearless\\" and stated that \\"the haters and conspiracy theorists would do well to read this book\\", though she criticised \\"the stiff, know-it-all voice of a foreign correspondent\\" that is interwoven with Yousafzai's. In The Spectator, the journalist Owen Bennett-Jones describes Yousafzai's story as \\"astonishing\\", and writes that \\"as the story progresses, Malala’s voice definitely cuts through, clear and defiant\\". Marie Arana in The Washington Post called the book \\"riveting\\" and wrote \\"It is difficult to imagine a chronicle of a war more moving, apart from perhaps the diary of Anne Frank.\\" Response in Pakistan The All Pakistan Private School's Federation announced that the book would be banned in its 152,000 member institutions, stating that it disrespected Islam and could have a \\"negative\\" influence. Pakistani investigative editor Ansar Abbasi described her work as \\"providing her critics something 'concrete' to prove her as an 'agent' of the West against Islam and Pakistan\\". Following the book's release, the Pakistani Taliban released a statement threatening to kill Yousafzai, and target bookshops which sell the book. Release details I Am Malala was published on 8 October 2013, by Weidenfeld & Nicolson in the UK and Little, Brown and Company in the US. The book has been translated into more than 40 languages. A children's edition of the memoir was published in 2014 under the title I Am Malala: How One Girl Stood Up for Education and Changed the World. The audio book edition, narrated by Neela Vaswani, won the 2015 Grammy Award for Best Children's Album.

The types of images used include photographs, video, paintings, cartoons, graffiti, and advertising, among others.Elisa Bignante The use of photo-elicitation in field research, EchoGeo. Either the interviewer or the subject may provide the images.Marisol Clark-IbáÑez Framing the Social World With Photo-Elicitation Interviews, American Behavioral Scientist August 2004 vol. 47 no. 12 1507-1527. Objective The main purpose of photo-elicitation interviewing is to record how subjects respond to the images, attributing their social and personal meanings and values. The meanings and emotions elicited may differ from or supplement those obtained through verbal inquiry. Regions of the brain that process visual information are evolutionarily and developmentally older than the parts that process verbal information.Douglas Harper Talking about pictures: a case for photo elicitation, Visual Studies, Vol. 17, No. 1, 2002. Description Visual images can evoke emphatic understanding of how other people experience their world. Photo-elicitation has been used successfully in a range of studies and is common in participatory research with young children and marginalised communities. Photo-Elicitation is unique to the interviewer as well as to the subject. When a photograph is taken, it has meaning to the interviewer, formed in part by the context of the image. To another interviewer, the same photograph may illustrate a similar concept, but two interviewers will never have exactly the same initial reaction to any image. This is an ideal method of qualitative research for those who are naturally visual learners. Also, our brain processes visuals differently from verbal communication. Therefore, photographs may also help to alleviate certain social anxieties that arise when discussing \\"difficult emotional subjects,\\" such as illness, death, poverty, etc. Many still question photo-elicitation as a research method, claiming the photographs taken during social experiments to be better known as art, than as research. But there are certain sub-sets of data that can be produced when the interviewer and subject collaborate to create an image that are hard to capture by other traditional means of data gathering. Without these sub-sets, sometimes even the most important conclusions of research are empty when it comes to human emotion and expression.

South Tower and crane wheel The castles of Dahn (, literally \\"Dahn castle group\\"), near the little town of Dahn in the German state of Rhineland-Palatinate, consist of three rock castles: * Altdahn * Grafendahn * Tanstein  Geography  The so-called Dahner Felsenland area of the Wasgau, the region forming the southern part of the Palatine Forest and the northern part of the Vosges, has a large number of castles and rock formations. For example, northwest of the castles at Dahn is Neudahn Castle and, close to the edge of the town, there are natural rock formations like the Jungfernsprung and the Bride and Groom (Braut und Bräutigam).  History  The three castles were built next to one another, but not at the same time, utilizing five neighbouring rocks on a single ridge situated just under a kilometre east of Dahn. Their construction involved several generations of noble families from Dahn and lasted almost two centuries: Tanstein dates to the early 12th century; Altdahn to the early 13th century and Grafendahn to the late 13th century.  Similar castle groups  A similar arrangement of two or three castles clustered closely together may be found in several places in the south part of neighbouring Alsatian Vosges: the Dreistein at Odilienberg near Obernai, the three castles on the Schlossberg near Reinhardsmunster, the Drei Exen near Eguisheim and the castle group of Haut-Kœnigsbourg/Oedenburg.

In the 2-D case the situation is quite different from the 1-D case, because the multi-dimensional polynomials cannot in general be factored. This means that an arbitrary transfer function cannot generally be manipulated into a form required by a particular implementation. The input-output relationship of a 2-D IIR filter obeys a constant-coefficient linear partial difference equation from which the value of an output sample can be computed using the input samples and previously computed output samples. Because the values of the output samples are fed back, the 2-D filter, like its 1-D counterpart, can be unstable.  Motivation & Applications  Due to the rapid development of information science and computing technology, the theory of digital filters design and application has achieved leap-forward development. We encounter a variety of signals in real-life, such as broadcasting signals, television signals, radar signals, mobile phone signals, navigation signals, radio astronomy signal, biomedical signals, control signals, weather signal, seismic signal, mechanical vibration signal, remote sensing and telemetry signals, etc. Most of these signals are analog signals and just a small portion of them are digital signals. The analog signals are continuous function of the independent variables, which can be one-dimensional, two-dimensional or multidimensional. In most cases, the variable of one-dimensional analog signals are time. After the time sampling and discretization of magnitude, such analog signal will become a one-dimensional digital signal. The resulting digital signal can be represented by a discrete sequence. For example, one common signal is voice signal. An example of a two-dimensional signal is an image. A filter is a system that can transform a signal into another signal. Examples of such transformation include smoothing the signal for noise removal, removing frequency components from a signal and amplifying frequency components for signal enhancement. The design and implementation of filter is an important branch in signal analysis and processing technology. Filters also play a main role in signal acquisition, transmission, processing and exchange.  Problem Statement & Basic Concepts = Digital filters  Digital signal filtering is implementing a digital filter. A digital filter is a system that performs mathematical operations on a sampled, discrete-time signal to reduce or enhance certain aspects of that signal. The input and output signals are all digital signals. This is in contrast to the other major type of electronic filter, the analog filter, which is an electronic circuit operating on a continuous-time analog signal. Actually the basic concept of digital filters and analog filters are the same. The only difference is the types of signals and the methods to filtering. Digital filters can be implemented numerically in software and have the advantages of high processing accuracy, steady system, little volume and light weight. There is no impedance matching in digital filters and digital filters can accomplish some special filtering functions that can’t be accomplished by analog filters. Analog signals can also be processed through digital filters by using Analog to Digital converters.  Two-dimensional digital filters  Two-dimensional filters are used to process two-dimensional digital signals. There is an important difference between the design of 1-D and 2-D digital filter problems. In 1-D case, the design and the implementation of filters can be more easily considered separately. The filter can first be designed and then, through the appropriate manipulations of the transfer function, the coefficients required by a particular network structure can be determined. While in the 2-D case, the design and implementation are more closely related. Since multidimensional polynomials can’t be factored in general. This means that an arbitrary multi- dimensional transfer function can generally not be manipulated into a form required by a particular implementation. If our implementation can realize only factorable transfer functions, our design algorithm must be tailored to design only filters of this class. This has the effect of complicating the design problem and also limiting the number of practical implementations. Digital filters can be categorized into two main types, namely finite impulse response (FIR) and infinite impulse response (IIR). 2-D FIR digital filter is achieved by a non-recursive algorithm structure while 2-D IIR digital filter is achieved by a recursive feedback algorithm structure.T. S. Huang, “Stability of two-dimensional recursive filters,” IEEE Transactions on Audio and Electroacoustics, vol. 20, no. 2, pp. 158–163, 1972.  Existing Approaches = Direct Form Implementations of 2-D IIR Filters  An IIR filter may be implemented in direct form by rearranging its difference equation to express one output sample in terms of the input samples and previously computed output samples.J. S. Lim, Two-Dimensional Signal and Image Processing, Prentice-Hall International, 1990. For a first-quadrant filter, the input signal x\\\\left(n_1,n_2\\\\right) and the output signal y\\\\left(n_1,n_2\\\\right) are related by y\\\\left(n_1,n_2\\\\right)=\\\\sum_{l_1=0}^{L_1-1}\\\\sum_{l_2=0}^{L_2-1}a(l_1,l_2)x(n_1-l_1,n_2-l_2)-\\\\sum_{k_1=0}^{K_1-1}\\\\sum_{k_2=0}^{K_2-1}b(k_1,k_2)y(n_1-k_1,n_2-k_2) Since the response of the filter to an impulse \\\\delta(n_1,n_2) is by definition the impulse response h\\\\left(n_1,n_2\\\\right), we can derive the relationship h\\\\left(n_1,n_2\\\\right)=a(l_1,l_2)-\\\\sum_{k_1=0}^{K_1-1}\\\\sum_{k_2=0}^{K_2-1}b(k_1,k_2)h(n_1-k_1,n_2-k_2) By taking the 2-D z-transform of both sides, we can solve for the system function H\\\\left(z_1,z_2\\\\right), which is given by H_z(z_1,z_2)=\\\\frac{\\\\sum_{l_1=0}^{L_1-1}\\\\sum_{l_2=0}^{L_2-1}a(l_1,l_2)z_1^{-l_1}z_2^{-l_2}}{\\\\sum_{k_1=0}^{K_1-1}\\\\sum_{k_2=0}^{K_2-1}b(k_1,k_2)z_1^{-k_1}z_2^{-k_2}}=\\\\frac{A_z(z_1,z_2)}{B_z(z_1,z_2)} This ratio may be viewed as resulting from the cascade of two filters, an FIR filter with a system function equal toA(z_1,z_2) and an IIR filter with a system function equal to 1/B(z_1,z_2), as shown in the figure below.Dan E. Dudgeon, Russell M. Mersereau, “Multidimensional Digital Signal Processing”, Prentice-Hall Signal Processing Series, , 1983. Representation for the filter with the system function H(z_1,z_2). Adapted from [3].  Parallel Implementations of 2-D IIR Filters  Another method to build up complicated 2-D IIR filters is by the parallel interconnection of subfilters. In this case, the overall transfer function becomes H_z^p(z_1,z_2)=\\\\sum_{i=1}^NH_z^{(i)}(z_1,z_2) Using equation H_z^{(i)}(z_1,z_2)=\\\\frac{A_z^{(i)}(z_1,z_2)}{B_z^{(i)}(z_1,z_2)} and putting the sum in transfer function over a common denominator, we get the expanded form H_z^{p}(z_1,z_2)=\\\\frac{A_z^{p}(z_1,z_2)}{B_z^{p}(z_1,z_2)}=\\\\frac{\\\\sum_{j=1}^N\\\\prod_{i j}A_z^{(j)}(z_1,z_2)B_z^{(j)}(z_1,z_2)}{\\\\prod_{i=1}^NB_z^{(i)}(z_1,z_2)} The parallel form cannot be used to implement an arbitrary 2-D rational system function.M. Ahmadi, “Design of 2-Dimensional recursive digital filters”, Control and Dynamics System, vol. 78, pp. 131-181, 1996. Nevertheless, we can synthesize interesting 2-D IIR filters which can be implemented by a parallel architecture. For example, the parallel form may be advantageous when designing a filter with multiple passband. The parallel implementation can also be useful for implementing a 2-D IIR filter whose impulse response is not confined to a single quadrant, such as a symmetric filter. Parallel interconnection of N simple 2-D IIR filters to form a new 2-D IIR filter. Adapted from [3].  Design of 2-D IIR Filters with Genetic Algorithm  Many design techniques for 2-D IIR digital filters have been reported in the literature([1]-[4]). During the past decade, genetic algorithm has been successfully used to digital filter design. Here we present a method for designing 2-D IIR Filters called GA-Based design method. = Initialization = The figure below shows the proposed GA-Based design flow. Filter coefficients are encoded in their CSD number representation. In the population initialization, chromosomes are generated randomly. Each coefficient has the pre-specified wordlength and maximum number of non-zero digits, which can be set to any desired values.Li Liang, Majid Ahmadi, Maher Sid-Ahmed, “Design of 2-D IIR FIlters with Canonical signed-digit coefficients using genetic algorithm”, Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering, University of Windsor, Canada. GA-based Design Flow chart. Adapted from [5]. = Genetic Operators = Roulette Wheel Selection is used as the reproduction operator. After each crossover operation, the coefficient where the crossover point lies in will be checked upon CSD format. Mutation operation is the simple single bit flip. After mutation, each coefficient in the offspring is checked upon CSD format. = Fitness Evaluation and Replacement Strategy = The fitness evaluation is a two-step process. The first step is to check the stability of each second order section using the stability triangle. Chromosomes failing the check are assigned fitness value 0. Elitist strategy is applied for old generation replacement. After reproduction the best chromosome and the worst chromosome in the offspring are found out. The designed filter has non- separable numerator and separable denominator transfer function.A. Mazinani, M. Ahmadi, M. Shridhar and R. S. Lashkari, “A novel approach to the design of 2-D recursive digital filters”, Journal of the Franklin Institute, Pergamon Press Ltd, vol. 329, no. 1, pp. 127-133, 1992. The number restoration technique is used to ensure that the filter coefficients are represented in the pre-specified CSD format.

It examines the constitutional jurisdiction of the Constitutional Court, the High Court and the Supreme Court of Appeal (and certain other specialist courts), and considers the various rules peculiar to these courts that are relevant to constitutional litigation, such as the admission of an amicus curiae, the duty to raise a constitutional matter as early as possible in the proceedings, and the duty to join the relevant organ of state in a case involving a constitutional issue.  Litigating fundamental rights  The Bill of Rights is \\"the principal source of substantive constraints on public power in the Constitution.\\"Currie and De Waal Handbook 23. The Bill of Rights instructs the state to use the power that the Constitution gives it in ways that do not violate fundamental rights and that promote and fulfil those rights. Should it fail to comply with these instructions, it will act unconstitutionally; its actions or laws will be unlawful and invalid. Although the Constitution as a whole is mostly concerned with state power and with law, there are a number of provisions of the Bill of Rights that place duties on private individuals in certain circumstances. One of the most important principles of South African law is expressed by the maxim ubi ius ubi remedium: Where there is a right, there is a remedy. This means that the existence of a legal rule implies the existence of an authority with the power to grant a remedy if that rule is infringed. A legal rule will be deficient if there is no means of enforcing it, and if no sanction attaches to a breach of that rule. Litigation to enforce directly the Bill of Rights is one way in which breaches of the Bill may be remedied. Direct Bill of Rights litigation is most conveniently analysed as taking place in distinct stages. There is an initial procedural stage, followed by a number of stages in which issues of substance are considered. Initially, a court hearing a Bill-of- Rights case will be concerned with any procedural issues that might arise: * the application of the Bill of Rights to the subject-matter of the litigation; * the justiciability of the issue to be decided (including the standing of the applicant); and * the jurisdiction of the court to grant the relief claimed by the applicant. Often, however, these procedural aspects of the case will be uncontroversial and the court can proceed directly to the substance of the case. The first step in the substantive stage of the litigation involves interpreting the provisions in the Bill of Rights. The court must consider, by reference to the facts of the case, and to the interpretation of the Bill of Rights, whether a right has been violated. If the court does find that a right has been violated, it must then consider whether that violation is a justifiable limitation of the right. Finally, if the court finds that a violation of a right is not a justifiable limitation, it will have to consider the proper remedy to deal with the unconstitutional infringement of a fundamental right. At each distinct stage of the litigation, the court must consider whether the onus of proof is on the applicant or respondent.  Stages  Before a court may proceed to consider the issues of substance raised in human rights litigation, it must first consider a series of preliminary, procedural issues. = Procedural issues  Application and the principle of avoidance  Application of the Bill of Rights concerns the issues of whether and how the Bill of Rights applies in a legal dispute. The first of these issues (whether the Bill of Rights applies) raises four questions: # Who benefits from the Bill of Rights? # Who is bound by the Bill of Rights? # Does the Bill of Rights apply to matters arising before its commencement? # Does the Bill of Rights apply only in the national territory or does it have extraterritorial effect? Answering these questions involves determining the \\"reach\\" or \\"scope\\" of the Bill of Rights. Application is concerned not only with whether the Bill of Rights applies, however, but also with how it applies in a legal dispute. The question here is this: What is the relationship between the Bill of Rights and the principles or rules of ordinary law? Currie and de Waal argue that the two application issues should be resolved in the following way: * The reach of the Bill of Rights (beneficiaries, duties, time and territory) demarcates the types of legal disputes to which the Bill of Rights directly applies. Within this area, the Bill of Rights overrides ordinary law and conduct that is inconsistent with it. In addition, and subject to considerations of justiciability and jurisdiction, the Bill of Rights generates its own set of remedies. This form of application, which is geared towards showing inconsistency between the Bill of Rights and law or conduct, is called the direct application of the Bill of Rights. * At the same time, the Bill of Rights contains a set of values that must be respected whenever the common law or legislation is interpreted, developed or applied. This form of application, which aims at creating harmony between the Bill of Rights and ordinary law, is called the indirect application of the Bill of Rights. When indirectly applied, the Bill of Rights does not override ordinary law; nor does it generate its own remedies. Instead, law is interpreted or developed in a way that makes it conform to the Constitution. The special constitutional rules relating to the procedural issues of standing and the jurisdiction of the courts are also irrelevant to this form of application. Rather, the Bill of Rights respects the procedural rules, the purpose and remedies of ordinary law, but demands the furtherance of its values through the operation of ordinary law.Currie and De Waal 24. Indirect application of the Bill of Rights must be considered before direct application. This is the result of the operation of the principle that constitutional issues should, where possible, be avoided. The principle of avoidance requires a court first to try to resolve a dispute by applying ordinary legal principles, as interpreted or developed with reference to the Bill of Rights, before applying the Bill of Rights directly to the dispute. An important implication of the principle of avoidance is that the special rules in the Bill of Rights relating to the standing of litigants and the jurisdiction of the courts apply only when it is impossible to give effect to the values in the Bill of Rights by applying, interpreting or developing the ordinary law. Similarly, constitutional remedies are only relevant when the Bill of Rights is directly applied to an issue. If it is possible to resolve the dispute through indirect application, ordinary procedural rules and remedies apply to the dispute. However, in order to apply the Bill of Rights indirectly, a court must obviously determine the effect of the provisions of the Bill of Rights. A court cannot interpret or develop the ordinary law with reference to the values contained in the Bill of Rights without knowing what they are. The interpretation of the Bill of Rights and its limitation clause therefore remain important, even when the Bill of Rights is indirectly applied.  Justiciability  In some cases, an applicant may lack standing to seek a remedy. In other cases, the issue may have become moot or academic and therefore not justiciable. An issue may also be non-justiciable because it is not yet ripe for decision by a court. The Bill of Rights contains special rules relating to these issues when it is directly applied. In such cases, it demands a broader approach to standing. In cases of indirect application, the ordinary legal rules apply.  Jurisdiction  In cases of indirect application, the ordinary procedural rules apply. The constitutional jurisdiction of the courts and the procedures that must be observed when the Bill of Rights is directly applied to law or conduct are not simply technical issues, but are of paramount importance for the protection of fundamental rights in practice. It is important to know in which forum to challenge an alleged violation of a right, since not all courts have the same jurisdiction in constitutional matters. If the court does not have the jurisdiction to grant the relief claimed, it must dismiss the application, whatever its merits may be. = Substantive questions = At the substantive stage of Bill-of-Rights litigation, the court is concerned with the substance of the applicant's allegation that a right has been infringed by law, or by the conduct of the other party. The court must assess the merits of this allegation. This assessment primarily involves the interpretation of the provisions of the Constitution in general, and the Bill of Rights in particular.  Interpretation  The court must determine whether or not the Bill of Rights protects a particular interest of the applicant. It must then determine whether or not the law that has been challenged or the conduct of the respondent impairs that interest, thereby trespassing in an area protected by the Bill of Rights.  Limitation  Fundamental rights and freedoms are not absolute: \\"Their boundaries are set by the rights of others and by the legitimate needs of society. Generally, it is recognised that public order, safety, health and democratic values justify the imposition of restrictions on the exercise of fundamental rights.\\"De Waal Constitutional Law 338. In the South African Constitution, a general limitation clause, section 36, sets out specific criteria for the restriction of the fundamental rights in the Bill of Rights. The clause is general because it applies in the same way to all the rights in the Bill of Rights. In this regard the Constitution differs from, for example, the United States Constitution, which does not contain a limitations clause at all. The German Bill of Rights does not have a general limitations clause, but it does contain specific limitations clauses attached to most of the fundamental rights. The court, in determining whether or not a right has been unjustifiably infringed, undertakes what is > essentially a two-stage exercise. First, there is the threshold enquiry > aimed at determining whether or not the enactment in question constitutes a > limitation on one or other guaranteed right. This entails examining (a) the > content and scope of the relevant protected right(s) and (b) the meaning and > effect of the impugned enactment to see whether there is any limitation of > (a) by (b).

If upon such analysis no limitation is found, that is the end > of the matter. The constitutional challenge is dismissed there and then.Ex > Parte Minister of Safety and Security: In Re S v Walters 2002 (4) SA 613 > (CC) para 26. If, however, the court determines that a law, or the conduct of the respondent, impairs a fundamental right, \\"the second stage ensues. This is ordinarily called the limitations exercise.\\"Ex Parte Minister of Safety and Security: In Re S v Walters para 27. It must then consider whether the infringement is nevertheless a justifiable limitation of the right in question: \\"In essence this requires a weighing-up of the nature and importance of the right(s) that are limited together with the extent of the limitation as against the importance and purpose of the limiting enactment.\\"Ex Parte Minister of Safety and Security: In Re S v Walters para 27. Not all laws or conduct that infringe fundamental rights are unconstitutional. Sometimes a law may be a justifiable limitation on a particular fundamental right. This means that, although the law or conduct infringes the right, the infringement (which is called a limitation) is justifiable. While infringing conduct itself cannot validly limit a fundamental right, the challenged conduct may be authorised by law. If the law passes the limitations test, the conduct it authorises will survive a constitutional challenge. The question, ultimately, which falls for determination by this balancing exercise is whether or not a balance can be struck? If not—if, that is, there is no proportionality—the limitation will not be found to be reasonable and justifiable in an open and democratic society. In the case of the death penalty, for example, the purposes served by such a penalty—at least, the purposes as considered by the Constitutional Court in S v Makwanyane—are deterrence,Paras 116-127. prevention.128. and retribution.Paras 129-131/ In serving these purposes, however, the impugned right is obliterated completely; its essential content, according to the Constitutional Court, is negated.Para 194. There is, in other words, no proportionality between means and end. One consequence of the inclusion of a general limitation clause in the Bill of Rights is that the process of considering the limitation of fundamental rights must be distinguished from that of interpretation of the rights. If it is argued that conduct or a provision of the law infringes a right in the Bill of Rights, it will first have to be determined whether that right has in fact been infringed, and thereafter whether the infringement is justified. The question of whether an infringement of a right is a legitimate limitation of that right \\"frequently involves a far more factual enquiry than the question of interpretation.\\"De Waal Constitutional Law 339. Appropriate evidence must be led to justify the limitation of a right in accordance with the criteria laid down in section 36. A court cannot determine in the abstract whether the limitation of a right is \\"reasonable\\" or \\"justifiable in an open and democratic society based on human dignity, equality and freedom.\\" This determination requires \\"evidence, such as sociological or statistical data,\\"De Waal Constitutional Law 339. on the impact that the legislative restriction has on society. = Remedies = Should a court find that a right has been infringed, and that the infringement does not satisfy the test for a valid limitation of a right, the question of the appropriate remedy for the infringement arises. The constitutional remedies are only available when the Bill of Rights is directly applied. In cases of indirect application, ordinary legal remedies are used to give effect to the fundamental values in the Bill of Rights.  Onus  The Constitutional Court has dealt with the issue of onus, or burden of proof, by dividing the substantive stage of human-rights litigation into two further sub-stages: # interpretation; and # limitation. The approach of the court to onus in respect of these stages is set out by Ackermann J in the following extract from Ferreira v Levin NO: > The task of determining whether the provisions of [an] Act are invalid > because they are inconsistent with the guaranteed rights here under > discussion involves two stages, first, an enquiry as to whether there has > been an infringement of the [...] guaranteed right; if so, a further enquiry > as to whether such infringement is justified under [...] the limitation > clause. The task of interpreting the [...] fundamental rights rests, of > course, with the Courts, but it is for the applicants to prove the facts > upon which they rely for the claim of infringement of the particular right > in question. Concerning the second stage, [it] is for the legislature or the > party relying on the legislation to establish this justification [in terms > of the limitation clause], and not for the party challenging it, to show > that it was not justified. This description focuses on the difference in onus relating to the questions of interpretation and limitation. The applicant has to show that an infringement of a right has taken place. This requires the applicant to prove the facts on which he relies. The respondent then has to show that an infringement is a justifiable limitation of the right in terms of section 36. In addition to the applicant's onus at the substantive stage of litigation, the applicant must also show, at the preliminary stage of litigation, * that the Bill of Rights applies to the challenged law or conduct; * that the issue is justiciable; * that he or she has standing; and * that he or she is in the right forum to obtain the desired relief. Only once these issues have been decided in the applicant' s favour, and a violation of the Bill of Rights is found, will the party relying on the validity of the challenged decision or legislation be called upon to justify it in terms of section 36, the limitation clause. The question of who bears the onus when considering the appropriate relief for unconstitutional legislation or conduct is \\"more complicated.\\"Currie and De Waal Handbook 27. When the Bill of Rights is indirectly applied, an ordinary legal remedy is granted, and the ordinary legal rules apply in respect of the burden of proof. When the Bill of Rights is directly applied, the remedy that flows from a finding of inconsistency between the Bill of Rights, on the one hand, and law or conduct, on the other, is invalidation by the court of the offending law or conduct. A party proposing a variation of this form of relief in terms of section 172(l)(b)(i) or (ii) must justify the request. Since section 172 allows a court to limit or suspend the effects of a declaration of invalidity, the respondent will in most cases be called upon to justify such a request. However, a court may also grant relief in addition to the declaration of invalidity, as in the case of an interdict or constitutional damages. In most cases, the applicant will request such relief, and will therefore bear the burden of persuasion.  Summary  The stages through which Bill-of-Rights litigation typically proceeds may be summarised as follows: = Procedural stage = Does the Bill of Rights apply in the dispute between the parties? How does the Bill of Rights apply in the dispute? As for the first question, it must be determined whether the applicant is entitled to claim the benefits of the Bill of Rights. It must also be determined whether the Bill of Rights applies to the conduct of the respondent, in the sense that the respondent has obligations under the Bill of Rights. Finally, it must be determined whether the cause of action arose in the national territory during the period of application of either the interim or 1996 Bill of Rights. As for the second question, indirect application must be considered before direct application. If the Bill of Rights is indirectly applied to the issue, the questions of justiciability, jurisdiction and an appropriate remedy are resolved in terms of ordinary legal rules. If directly applied, special constitutional rules apply. Is the issue to be decided justiciable? Does the applicant in the matter have standing in respect of the particular relief sought? Does the court have jurisdiction to grant the relief claimed? = Substantive stage = If the answer to all three questions is \\"yes,\\" the court is able to move on to the substantive stage. Has the law or conduct of the respondent infringed a fundamental right of the applicant? If so, the court will consider whether the infringement is justifiable. If not, then the application must be dismissed. Is the infringement a justifiable limitation of the right in question according to the criteria set out in section 36? If yes, then the conduct of the respondent is not unconstitutional; the application must be dismissed. If no, then the conduct is unconstitutional, and the question of the appropriate remedy must be canvassed. = Remedies = What remedy is appropriate in this case?  Application of the Bill of Rights  The Bill of Rights applies directly to a legal dispute when * a right of a beneficiary of the Bill of Rights has been infringed by * a person or entity on whom the Bill of Rights has imposed the duty not to infringe the right * during the period of operation of the Bill of Rights * in the national territory. In addition, in instances when the Bill of Rights does not apply directly to a dispute, because one or more of the elements above is not present, it may apply indirectly. This is because all law must be developed, interpreted and applied in a way that conforms to the Bill of Rights. A conceptual distinction, then, must be made between two forms of application of the Bill of Rights: # Indirect application: The Constitution and the Bill of Rights establish an \\"objective normative value system,\\" a set of values that must be respected whenever the common law or legislation is interpreted, developed or applied. This form of application is termed the \\"indirect\\" application of the Bill of Rights. When indirectly applied, the Bill of Rights does not override ordinary law or generate its own remedies. Rather, the Bill of Rights respects the rules and remedies of ordinary law, but demands furtherance of its values mediated through the operation of ordinary law. # Direct application: In disputes in which the Bill of Rights applies as directly applicable law, it overrides ordinary law and any conduct that is inconsistent with it. To the extent that ordinary legal remedies are inadequate or do not give proper effect to the fundamental rights, the Bill of Rights generates its own remedies. The methodology for the conduct of direct- rights litigation is applicable. This distinction was of \\"decisive significance\\" under the interim Constitution.Currie and De Waal Handbook 31. It has \\"comparatively less significance\\" under the 1996 Constitution.Currie and De Waal Handbook 31. This is because of changes made to the jurisdictional and application scheme by the 1996 Constitution. There are nevertheless important consequences that follow from the form of application, and the distinction between direct and indirect application therefore \\"continues to play a role in constitutional litigation.\\"Currie and De Waal Handbook 31. The application of the Bill of Rights has been \\"one of the most troublesome issues in South African constitutional law.\\"Currie and De Waal Handbook 32. The principal reason for the difficulty is that, since 1994, South Africa has had two Constitutions that have treated the issue differently. Much of the relevant jurisprudence, particularly relating to the application of the Bill of Rights to the common law, was decided under the interim Constitution and does not always bear precisely on the altered jurisdictional and application schemes of the 1996 Constitution.  Interim Constitution  The narrowest conception of a bill of rights is that it is a \\"charter of negative liberties.\\" This means that it is intended to protect individuals against state power by listing rights that cannot be violated by the state, either by means of law or through the conduct of state actors. This is the \\"vertical\\" relationship—between individuals and the state. A bill of rights that has solely vertical application will place duties on the state not to violate the rights of individuals. It will not place any similar duties on individuals. According to the Constitutional Court, in Du Plessis v De Klerk, the Bill of Rights in Chapter 3 of the interim Constitution conformed to this traditional model, in so far as it had no direct application to so-called \\"horizontal\\" disputes: that is, to disputes between private litigants governed by the common law. \\"Constitutional rights under Chapter 3,\\" the court held, \\"may be invoked against an organ of government but not by one private litigant against another.\\"Para 49. This was principally because of the absence of the word \\"judiciary\\" in section 7, the application section of the interim Constitution, which provided that the Bill of Rights \\"shall bind all legislative and executive organs of state at all levels of government.\\" The omission meant that the Bill of Rights placed duties to uphold constitutional rights only on the legislative and executive organs of state. Individuals were not directly bound by the Bill of Rights. Nor was the judiciary, which had the task of adjudicating and enforcing the rights and duties of individuals. However, while the interim Bill of Rights did not apply directly to horizontal cases, it did have indirect application. The Bill of Rights applied to \\"all law in force,\\" including all pre- and post-1994 legislation and the uncodified common law (provisions of the common law which had not been incorporated into legislation). Even if individuals were not directly bound by the Bill of Rights, the courts had to interpret legislation, and develop the common law, so that the ordinary law recognised and protected the rights in the Bill of Rights. In Du Plessis v Klerk, the Constitutional Court held that the Bill of Rights in the Interim Constitution \\"may and should have an influence on the development of the common law as it governs relations between individuals.\\"Para 62. This was provided for in section 35(3) of the interim Constitution: \\"In the interpretation of any law and the application and development of the common law and customary law, a court shall have due regard to the spirit, purport and objects of\\" the Bill of Rights. \\"In private litigation,\\" held the court, \\"any litigant may nonetheless contend that a statute (or executive act) relied on by the other party is invalid as being inconsistent with the limitations placed on legislature and executive under Chapter 3.\\"Para 49. Accordingly, \\"as Chapter 3 applies to common law, governmental acts or omissions in reliance on the common law may be attacked by a private litigant as being inconsistent with Chapter 3 in any dispute with an organ of government.\\"Para 49. In Du Plessis, the Constitutional Court also decided a crucial jurisdictional issue. The court's conclusion that the Constitution distinguished between direct and indirect application of the Bill of Rights was bolstered by the close fit between this distinction and the \\"two-track\\" jurisdictional scheme of the interim Constitution, which distinguished between \\"constitutional matters\\" and other matters, the former being the preserve of the Constitutional Court, and the latter the preserve of the Appellate Division. The development of the common law was a non- constitutional matter, and therefore remained within the jurisdiction of the court that had overseen the development of the common law for the past century: the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court. \\"The development of the common law,\\" held the court in Du Plessis, \\"is within the jurisdiction of the Appellate Division, but not of the Constitutional Court.\\"Para 64.  1996 Constitution  With the Du Plessis decision in mind, and concerned that confining the Bill of Rights to direct vertical application amounted to the toleration of private violations of rights, the Constitutional Assembly created a different application and jurisdictional scheme in the 1996 Constitution. To provide for direct horizontal application, two textual changes were made. The first was the addition of the word \\"judiciary\\" in section 8(1), missing from the application provisions of the interim Constitution. The second was the imposition of a duty on individuals, in section 8(2), to uphold the rights of other individuals: \\"A provision of the Bill of Rights binds a natural or a juristic person if, and to the extent that, it is applicable, taking into account the nature of the right and the nature of any duty imposed by the right.\\" The 1996 Constitution also made significant changes to the powers of the courts to enforce the Constitution. The \\"two-track\\" jurisdictional scheme of the interim Constitution was replaced by a unified scheme in which the High Courts, Supreme Court of Appeal and the Constitutional Court shared jurisdiction over constitutional matters. This scheme required revision of the holding in Du Plessis that the application of the Constitution to the common law was a non-constitutional matter. Under the 1996 Constitution, the Constitutional Court held in the Pharmaceutical Manufacturers case, \\"there are not two systems of law, each dealing with the same subject matter, each having similar requirements, each operating in its own field with its own highest court. There is only one system of law. It is shaped by the Constitution which is the supreme law, and all law, including the common law, derives its force from the Constitution and is subject to constitutional control.\\" While clearly envisaging direct horizontal application in applicable cases, the 1996 Bill of Rights also requires the courts to apply the Bill of Rights indirectly, in similar terms to section 35(3) of the interim Constitution. This is section 39(2): \\"When interpreting any legislation, and when developing the common law or customary law, every court, tribunal or forum must promote the spirit, purport and objects of the Bill of Rights.\\" To summarise, the 1996 Constitution, like its predecessor, distinguishes two forms of application of the Bill of Rights: # Direct application entails the imposition of duties by the Bill of Rights on specified actors: A breach of such a duty is a violation of a constitutional right. # Indirect application occurs where there is a provision of ordinary law (legislation, common law or customary law) that mediates between the Bill of Rights and the actors who are subject to that law. The duty of the courts is to ensure that the ordinary law conforms to the values to which the Bill of Rights, by conferring the rights and duties that it does, gives effect. Like its predecessor, the 1996 Constitution provides for direct vertical application of the Bill of Rights but, unlike its predecessor, does not confine itself to this form of direct application. Section 8(2) clearly envisages direct application of the Bill of Rights in the horizontal relationship in certain circumstances.  Direct application  There are four elements that are determinative of the direct application of the Bill of Rights. The first relates to beneficiaries, the second to the duties imposed by the Bill of Rights, the third to time and the fourth to the limited territorial effect of the Bill of Rights. Legal rights are a correlative relationship. If Armand has a legal right to something, this postulates that Theo has a legal duty to Armand to uphold that right. Armand is therefore the beneficiary of the right and Theo is the duty-bearer in respect of the right. The first application issue to confront when considering the reach of the Bill of Rights is to identify the beneficiaries and the duty-bearers of the rights in the Bill of Rights. = Beneficiaries  Natural persons  Most of the rights in the Bill of Rights are for the benefit of \\"everyone.\\" The negative phrase, which is to the same effect, is that a right may be denied to \\"no-one.\\" For example, section 11 provides that \\"everyone has the right to life.\\" Section 13 is phrased negatively but, like section 11, accords the right universally: \\"No one may be subjected to slavery, servitude or forced labour.\\" Rights phrased in this way are accorded to all natural persons within the territory of the Republic. Other rights are accorded to narrower categories of beneficiaries. The political rights in section 19, the citizens' rights in section 20, certain of the freedom-of-movement rights in section 21, and the freedom-of-trade right in section 22, are accorded to \\"every citizen.\\" The right to vote and to stand for political office, in section 19(3), is restricted to \\"every adult citizen.\\" Further examples of restrictions on the category of beneficiaries are the cultural rights contained in section 31, which are for the benefit only of \\"persons belonging to a cultural, religious or linguistic community.\\" The rights contained in section 35 are restricted to arrested, detained and accused persons. The restriction of a right to a particular category of beneficiaries is an attempt to circumscribe the scope of the right. A right accorded only to citizens obviously has a more limited scope of operation than a right accorded universally. The circumscription of rights in this manner \\"does not really concern the application of the rights, but may raise difficult issues of interpretation.\\"Currie and De Waal Handbook 35. The courts will have to interpret the Bill of Rights to determine who is, for example, a \\"detained person,\\" or \\"a worker,\\" or a \\"person belonging to a cultural religious or linguistic community.\\" The activities of persons who are excluded from the scope of a right will not be protected by the right.  Juristic persons  Are the rights accorded to \\"everyone\\" also available for the benefit of juristic persons? In other words, are companies protected by the Bill of Rights? What about state-owned or state-controlled corporations such as Eskom or the SABC? These questions are answered by reference to s 8(4): \\"A juristic person is entitled to the rights in the Bill of Rights to the extent required by the nature of the rights and the nature of that juristic person.\\" In order to decide whether a juristic person is protected, regard must be had to two factors: # the nature of the fundamental right in question; and # the nature of the juristic person. In Ex Parte Chairperson of the Constitutional Assembly: In Re Certification of the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa,1996 (4) SA 744 (CC). an objection was raised that, inconsistently with Constitutional Principle II, the extension of the rights guaranteed by the Bill of Rights to juristic persons would diminish the rights of natural persons. This Constitutional Court rejected the objection in the following terms: > Many \\"universally accepted fundamental rights\\" will be fully recognised only > if afforded to juristic persons as well as natural persons. For example, > freedom of speech, to be given proper effect, must be afforded to the media, > which are often owned or controlled by juristic persons. While it is true > that some rights are not appropriate to enjoyment by juristic persons, the > text of s 8(4) specifically recognises this. The text also recognises that > the nature of a juristic person may be taken into account by a court in > determining whether a particular right is available to such person or > not.Para 57. The nature of some of the fundamental rights prevents them from benefiting juristic persons. The rights to life and physical integrity, and to human dignity, for example, cannot sensibly be applied to juristic persons. A company cannot claim protection of its right to life or human dignity, or its right not to be deprived of liberty or tortured, \\"because these rights protect aspects of human existence that a company does not possess.\\"Currie and De Waal Handbook 36. However, the nature of most of the rights that are likely to be relied on by juristic personsEquality (s 9), privacy (s 14), freedom of expression (s 16), freedom of association (s 18), the right to engage in collective bargaining (s 23(5)), the property right (s 25), the right of access to information (s 32), just administrative action (s 33), access to Court (s 34) and the fair-trial rights (s 35(3). makes them applicable to the protection of juristic persons. However, in the case of rights that stem from the protection of human dignity (such as privacy), the Constitutional Court has indicated, in Investigating Directorate: Serious Economic Offences and Others v Hyundai Motor Distributors (Pty) Ltd In re: Hyundai Motor Distributors (Pty) Ltd v Smit NO,2001 (1) SA 545 (CC). that juristic persons are entitled only to a reduced level of protection compared to natural persons: > Privacy is a right which becomes more intense the closer it moves to the > intimate personal sphere of the life of human beings, and less intense as it > moves away from that core. This understanding of the right flows [...] from > the value placed on human dignity by the Constitution. Juristic persons are > not the bearers of human dignity. Their privacy rights, therefore, can never > be as intense as those of human beings. However, this does not mean that > juristic persons are not protected by the right to privacy. Exclusion of > juristic persons would lead to the possibility of grave violations of > privacy in our society, with serious implications for the conduct of > affairs. The state might, for instance, have free licence to search and > seize material from any non-profit organisation or corporate entity at will. > This would obviously lead to grave disruptions and would undermine the very > fabric of our democratic state. Juristic persons therefore do enjoy the > right to privacy, although not to the same extent as natural persons.Para > 18. It is the second of section 8(4)'s criteria (the nature of the juristic person) that may place greater restrictions on the availability of human rights to juristic persons. \\"It is difficult to see,\\" write Currie and De Waal, > how organs of state exercising core government functions such as Parliament, > a cabinet minister or the police will ever be able to rely on the protection > of the Bill of Rights. Although arguably they are 'juristic persons', the > nature of such organs of state makes them unsuitable to be beneficiaries of > fundamental rights. They are not used by individuals for the collective > exercise of their fundamental rights, but are instead used by the state for > the exercise of its powers.\\"Currie and De Waal Handbook 36-37. However, state-owned corporations, such as the South African Broadcasting Corporation or the Post Office, or entities such as universities, which are set up by the state for the purpose, amongst other things, of realising particular fundamental rights, are differently situated: \\"Clearly a state- owned corporation like the SABC should be able to invoke the right to freedom of speech and the press when it becomes involved in a dispute with the state or even with an individual.\\"Currie and De Waal Handbook 37. In Hoffmann v South African Airways,2001 (1) SA 1 (CC). the Constitutional Court held, > Transnet is a statutory body, under the control of the state, which has > public powers and performs public functions in the public interest. It was > common cause that SAA is a business unit of Transnet. As such, it is an > organ of state and is bound by the provisions of the Bill of Rights in terms > of section 8(1), read with section 239, of the Constitution. It is, > therefore, expressly prohibited from discriminating unfairly. As for private juristic persons, the size or activities of the juristic person are not necessarily decisive. Of greater significance, in the view of Currie and De Waal, is \\"the relationship between the activities of the juristic person and the fundamental rights of the natural persons who stand behind the juristic person.\\"Currie and De Waal Handbook 37. In other words, juristic persons are not in and of themselves worthy of protection; they become so when they are used by natural persons for the collective exercise of their fundamental rights. For example, companies are routinely used by individuals as an entity for conducting business, necessitating the exercise of property rights by companies. As the Constitutional Court put it in First National Bank of SA Limited t/a Wesbank v Commissioner for the South African Revenue Services,2002 (4) SA 768 (CC). It is trite that a company is a legal entity altogether separate and distinct from its members, that its continued existence is independent of the continued existence of its members, and that its assets are its exclusive property. Nevertheless, a shareholder in a company has a financial interest in the dividends paid by the company and in its success or failure because she \\"... is entitled to an aliquot share in the distribution of the surplus assets when the company is wound up\\" No matter how complex the holding structure of a company or groups of companies may be, ultimately—in the vast majority of cases—the holders of shares are natural persons.Para 43. The court also commented on \\"the universal phenomenon\\" that \\"natural persons are increasingly forming companies and purchasing shares in companies for a wide variety of legitimate purposes, including earning a livelihood, making investments and for structuring a pension scheme.\\" The use of companies, the court found, \\"has come to be regarded as indispensable for the conduct of business, whether large or small. It is in today's world difficult to conceive of meaningful business activity without the institution and utilisation of companies.\\"Para 44. The court saw that \\"denying companies entitlement to property rights,\\" even more so than in relation to the right to privacy, would > \\"lead to grave disruptions and would undermine the very fabric of our > democratic State.\\" It would have a disastrous impact on the business world > generally, on creditors of companies and, more especially, on shareholders > in companies. The property rights of natural persons can only be fully and > properly realised if such rights are afforded to companies as well as to > natural persons.Para 45. What section 8(4) envisages is that there should be a link between protecting the activity of the juristic person and protecting the fundamental rights of the natural persons that lie behind it. Much of the debate about the meaning of the guidelines contained in section 8(4)—that is, \\"the nature of the right\\" and \\"the nature of the juristic person\\"—is made \\"irrelevant,\\" write Currie and De Waal, by the courts' approach to standing in constitutional litigation.Currie and De Waal Handbook 37. A person has standing to challenge the constitutionality of laws or conduct, # provided that he alleges that a fundamental right is infringed or threatened; and # provided that he has, in terms of the categories listed in section 38, a sufficient interest in obtaining a remedy. The first enquiry is objective: It is sufficient to show that a right in the Bill of Rights is violated by a law or conduct; it is not necessary to show that a right of the applicant has been violated. This approach allows anyone with a sufficient interest to rely on the objective inconsistency between the Bill of Rights and a law or conduct. For example, it will seldom be necessary for juristic persons to invoke section 8(4), which sometimes extends the protection of the right to the juristic person itself. Laws, and many forms of state and private conduct, inevitably impact on the activities of both natural and juristic persons. Provided that a juristic person has a sufficient interest of its own,s 38 (a). or, if it is an association, a sufficient interest of its members, it may challenge such laws or conduct on the basis of fundamental rights that do not necessarily benefit the juristic person. For example, a law which prohibits the sale of wine on Sunday may be challenged by a company on the basis of the right to freedom of religion, provided that the company has a sufficient interest in the outcome of the litigation. It is not necessary in such a case for the company to show that the right to freedom of religion benefits juristic persons. It is only when a law or conduct impacts solely on the activities of juristic persons that it will not be possible to follow this course of action. Then there can be no objective inconsistency between the Bill of Rights and the law or conduct, unless section 8(4) extends protection of the relevant right to juristic persons. For example, when a special tax on companies is challenged, a person challenging the tax will have to do so on the basis of a right that benefits juristic persons.  Waiver  Waiver may be considered an application issue, and can be accommodated under the consideration of the beneficiaries of the Bill of Rights in that someone who has waived a right has agreed that he will not claim the benefit of it. Although the distinction may be difficult to make in some cases, the waiver of fundamental rights should be distinguished from a decision not to exercise a fundamental right. Where a person chooses not to take part in an assembly, or not to join an association, he cannot later complain about a violation of his rights to freedom of assembly or association. The same applies when an arrested person makes an informed choice to co-operate with the police by making a statement or a confession, or when a person allows the police to search his or her home: \\"Such a person cannot subsequently object at the trial that the introduction of the evidence violates his or her right to remain silent or his or her right to privacy of the home.\\"Currie and De Waal Handbook 38. In principle, the accused may nevertheless object to the use of the evidence if it would render the trial unfair. In the absence, however, of other circumstances—for example, that the accused was improperly persuaded to co-operate—\\"it is difficult to see why the use of the evidence would result in an unfair trial.\\"Currie and De Waal Handbook 38. Waiver is different. One is dealing with waiver when someone undertakes not to exercise a fundamental right in future. For example, a contractual restraint of trade is an undertaking to waive one's right, guaranteed by section 22, to occupational freedom for a period of time. A person may also undertake not to disclose sensitive information, or undertake to vote for a particular political party on election day; he may agree to have his telephone calls recorded and listened to by his or her employer, or to attend religious instruction classes in a private school. These are, respectively, attempts to waive the rights to freedom of expression, to vote, to privacy and to freedom of religion. The question is whether people may be obliged to honour such an undertaking even if they subsequently change their minds. A waiver, write Currie and De Waal, \\"cannot make otherwise unconstitutional laws or conduct constitutional and valid.\\"Currie and De Waal Handbook 38. Section 2 of the Constitution provides that law or conduct inconsistent with the Constitution is invalid. This is an objective consideration: \\"The actions of the beneficiary of the right can have no influence on the invalidity of unconstitutional law or conduct.\\"Currie and De Waal Handbook 39. That is why a person cannot validly undertake to behave unconstitutionally; such an undertaking will have no force and effect. Similarly, a person cannot waive the indirect application of the Bill of Rights. Two people may not undertake, for example, that the law of defamation must be applied in future disputes between them without any reference to the Bill of Rights. The reason for this is that section 39(2) requires the courts to promote the Bill of Rights when developing the common law. Individuals may not prevent the court from fulfilling its constitutional obligations. What individuals may do is to waive the right to exercise a fundamental right. The individual may undertake not to invoke the constitutional invalidity of state or private conduct. Although, \\"from a constitutional point of view, such a waiver is hardly ever decisive of an issue,\\" nonetheless \\"it is also seldom irrelevant.\\"Currie and De Waal Handbook 39. Although waiver is dealt with here as an issue of application, \\"we do not mean to suggest that it must be answered by simply asking whether the individual may exclude him or herself from the 'benefits' of a particular fundamental right in the circumstances of the case.\\"Currie and De Waal Handbook 39. Waiver, and more generally, victim responsibility, may also influence the limitation stage and the remedy that a court will award for breach of the fundamental right. The effect of waiver depends firstly on the nature and purpose of the fundamental right in question. In principle, many of the freedom rights may be waived as long as the undertaking is made clearly and freely, and without the subject's being placed under duress or labouring under a misapprehension: \\"To be enforceable, however, it would have to be a fully informed consent and one clearly showing that the applicant was aware of the exact nature and extent of the rights being waived in consequence of such consent.\\"Mohamed and Another v President of the Republic of South Africa and Others 2001 (2) SACR 66 (CC). For example, the right to occupational freedoms 22. is often waived by employees when concluding a contract of employment. There is also no reason why one cannot waive the right to privacy.s 14. Similarly, one may validly undertake not to demonstrate,s 17. not to join a political party,ss 18, 19. or not to leave the Republic.s 2 1(2). One may also waive many of the procedural rights, such as the right to legal representation or the right of access to court. As far as these rights are concerned, it is not so much the nature of the right that may be decisive, \\"but the length of the period of the waiver, the danger of abuse and the position of the beneficiary.\\"Currie and De Waal Handbook 40. The waiver may not be contrary to some other constitutional principle or otherwise contra bonos mores. In contrast to the freedom rights, the nature of the rights to human dignity,s 10. to life,s 11. and not to be discriminated against,s 9(3)-(4). or the right to a fair trial, does not permit them to be waived: \\"Unlike the freedom rights, these rights cannot be exercised negatively.\\"Currie and De Waal Handbook 40. The right to freedom of expression, for example, can be exercised by keeping quiet, but the right to dignity cannot be exercised by being abused. One cannot therefore assume that the right is exercised when it is waived (as one can, subject to the above considerations, with the freedom rights). Although some rights may not be waived, this does not mean that the fact of waiver then becomes legally irrelevant. Waiver may also be relevant when considering the remedy to be awarded for the violation of a fundamental right. For example, a court would not enforce an undertaking to vote for a particular political party, but it would also probably not grant relief for such a violation of the right to vote, other than to declare the agreement to be invalid. On the other hand, if a person is prevented from voting against his or her will, \\"it may well be appropriate to award damages for the infringement.\\"Currie and De Waal Handbook 40. \\"An interesting illustration\\" of some of the principles discussed above is provided by Garden Cities Inc Association v Northpine Islamic Society. The High Court granted an interdict enforcing a contractual undertaking not to use loud-speaking equipment to broadcast calls to prayer from a suburban mosque. An undertaking not to use any amplification equipment had been given by the respondent in 1986, in the deed of the sale of the land on which the mosque was built. Despite the contract, the respondent started broadcasting amplified calls to prayer through a loudspeaker, and the applicants applied for an interdict to stop it. The argument of the respondent was that enforcing the contract would amount to a violation of the constitutional right to freedom of religion, and that the Constitution did not permit the waiver of a fundamental aspect of one's religion. Conradie J was able to avoid the waiver issue by holding that amplification of the call to prayer had not been shown to be a fundamental precept of the Islamic faith, and that the agreement therefore did not infringe the right to religious freedom. Currie and De Waal, however, argue > that it was not necessary for the court to decide on what constitutes a > \\"fundamental precept\\" of the respondent's religion. If the respondent had > waived its right to practice its religion in this way, it would have made > the decision itself. But it is in any event doubtful that the waiver would > have been binding since it cannot have qualified as having been given in > full knowledge of the freedom that is being surrendered. In Northpine the > undertaking was made in 1986, at a time when there was no constitutionally > protected right to religious freedom. It is therefore not feasible to argue > that a properly informed waiver of rights took place, since the right in > question did not exist at the time. = Direct horizontal and vertical application of the Bill of Rights = Traditionally, a bill of rights confines itself to regulating the \\"vertical\\" relationship between the individual and the state.Currie and De Waal Handbook 41. This is not a relationship of equality. The state is far more powerful than any individual.\\"It has a monopoly on the legitimate use of force within its territory. State authority allows the state to enforce its commands through the criminal law\\" (Currie and De Waal Handbook 41). If not protected by a bill of rights against abuse of the state's powers, the individual would be \\"in an extremely vulnerable position.\\"Currie and De Waal Handbook 41. The 1996 Bill of Rights performs this traditional task of protecting individuals against the state by imposing a duty on all branches of the state to respect its provisions. The 1996 Bill of Rights goes further than is traditional, however. It recognises that \\"private abuse of human rights may be as pernicious as violations perpetrated by the state.\\"Currie and De Waal Handbook 41. For this reason, the Bill of Rights is not confined to protecting individuals against the state. In certain circumstances, the Bill of Rights directly protects individuals against abuses of their rights by other individuals, by providing for the direct horizontal application of the Bill of Rights. The direct application of the duties under the Bill of Rights is governed by section 8. Broadly speaking, section 8(1) deals with direct vertical application. It describes the circumstances in which law and conduct of the state may be challenged for being inconsistent with the Bill of Rights. Section 8(2), on the other hand, deals with direct horizontal application. It sets out the circumstances in which the conduct of private individuals may be attacked for infringing the Bill of Rights. Section 8(3) grants powers to the courts to remedy such infringements. We are concerned at this point with direct application. Recall, though, that the Bill of Rights also applies indirectly on both the vertical and horizontal axes. Indirect application means that, instead of the Bill of Rights' directly imposing duties and conferring rights, rights and duties are instead imposed by the common law or legislation. In turn, the development and interpretation of the common law and legislation is influenced by the Bill of Rights. = Direct vertical application: duties of state actors = Section 8(1) provides that the legislature, the executive, the judiciary and all organs of state are bound by the Bill of Rights. An applicant may therefore challenge the conduct of any of these state institutions as a breach of their duties under the Bill of Rights.  Legislatures  The term \\"legislature\\" refers to the institutions that exercise the legislative authority of the Republic: Parliament, the provincial legislatures and the municipal councils. The primary duty of all of these bodies, and their principal form of conduct, is legislating. The output of the legislative process—legislation of the central, provincial and local governments, as well as any form of delegated legislation—must comply with the Bill of Rights. This is because, in the words of section 8(1), the Bill of Rights \\"applies to all law.\\" As far as conduct of the legislatures other than law-making is concerned, the implication of section 8(1) is that legislatures and their committees and functionaries are bound by the Bill of Rights when they perform non-legislative functions, such as the determination of internal arrangements, proceedings, rules and procedures. In De Lille v Speaker of the National Assembly, the High Court stated: The National Assembly is subject to the supremacy of the Constitution. It is an organ of state and therefore it is bound by the Bill of Rights. All its decisions and acts are subject to the Constitution and the Bill of Rights. Parliament can no longer claim supreme power subject to limitations imposed by the Constitution. It subject in all respects to the provisions of our Constitution [... T]he nature and exercise of parliamentary privilege must be consonant with the Constitution. The exercise of parliamentary privilege which is clearly a constitutional power is not immune from judicial review. If a parliamentary privilege is exercised in breach of a constitutional provision, redress may be sought by an aggrieved party from law courts whose primary function is to protect rights of individuals.  Executive  The Bill of Rights binds the \\"executive [...] and all organs of state.\\" This means that conduct of the executive and organs of state can be tested against any of the provisions of the Bill of Rights, with the exception of section 33, which can only be applied to conduct of the executive and organs of state that amounts to \\"administrative action.\\" Although the executive and organs of state are primarily responsible for executing the law, it must be kept in mind that the Bill of Rights also binds these actors when they make law. All delegated legislation may therefore be directly tested against the Bill of Rights for this reason, and for the reason that the Bill of Rights applies to \\"all law.\\" The \\"executive\\" may be taken to refer to the party-political appointees who collectively head the government, whether at the national or provincial level. At the national level of government, for example, the executive consists of the President, the Deputy President, the Ministers and the Deputy Ministers. On this definition, \\"it is difficult to envisage conduct of the 'executive' that would not also amount to conduct of an 'organ of state' as defined in s 239.\\"Currie and De Waal Handbook 43.  Organs of state  The phrase \\"organ of state\\" is defined in section 239 of the Constitution. In terms of this definition, the conduct of organs of state may be divided into three categories: # conduct of any department of state or administration in the national, provincial or local spheres of government; # conduct of any other functionary or institution exercising a power or performing a function in terms of the Constitution or a provincial constitution; and # conduct of any functionary or institution exercising a public power or performing a public function in terms of any legislation. A court or a judicial officer is specifically excluded from the definition. The first category refers to any department of state or administration in the national, provincial or local spheres of government. When read in context, the implication of this provision is that state departments (or the administration) are bound by the Bill of Rights whether they exercise a power in terms of legislation or act in another capacity. State departments will therefore be bound by the Bill of Rights when, for example, they decide whether to enter into contracts. By providing that the exercise of a power or the performance of a function in terms of the Constitution, or of a provincial constitution, amounts to conduct of an organ of state, section 239 makes it clear that the exercise of constitutional executive powers (previously referred to as \\"prerogative powers\\") may be challenged for consistency with the Bill of Rights. Finally, a functionary or an institution qualifies as an \\"organ of state\\" in terms of s 239 when it exercises a public power or performs a public function in terms of legislation. This provision means, first, that the functionary or the institution must derive powers from a statute or perform a function in terms of a statute (as opposed to merely being incorporated pursuant to a statute, such as all companies and close corporations are). Secondly, it means that the nature of the power or function (and not the nature of the functionary or institution) must be \\"public.\\" The phrase \\"public power\\" is used in section 239 of the Constitution, but it is not defined there. It has gained wide currency in the constitutional jurisprudence, but definition or theorisation of the concept are seldom ventured, \\"because of its difficulty and abstraction.\\"Currie and De Waal Handbook 44. The concept is best understood as occupying similar terrain to the concept of \\"public law.\\" Like public law, which operates in distinction to private law, public power operates \\"in necessary but sometimes fuzzy distinction to an opposite—private power.\\"Currie and De Waal Handbook 44. Currie and De Waal propose the following understanding of public power: > Public power is power with a state-like dimension—either because it derives > from the state or because it does what the state typically does—exercise > power in a general and public-regarding way. The term therefore connotes use > of the state's lawfully derived powers of regulation and compulsion. It is > to be distinguished from exercises of what can be called private power—the > domain of voluntary obligations.  Judiciary  When the members of the judiciary (judges and magistrates) act in a judicial capacity—that is to say, when they adjudicate legal disputes—they are required to conduct themselves in a manner that complies with the Bill of Rights. Some provisions of the Bill of Rights, such as section 35(5), which provides for the exclusion of evidence in certain circumstances, are indeed specifically directed at the conduct of the judiciary when presiding over criminal trials. When members of the judiciary perform administrative actions, they are also bound to comply with the administrative-justice right in section 33. The difficult issue is to determine the extent to which the judiciary is bound when it makes law. Every court decision may be considered to become part of the common law and add to the common law (unless and until it is overturned by a higher court or the legislature). If this is so, \\"it can be argued that no court may give legal effect to private conduct that is inconsistent with the Bill of Rights.\\"Currie and De Waal Handbook 44. This means that, for practical purposes, private persons will then always be bound to the Bill of Rights, because they will be unable to seek the assistance of the courts to enforce their unconstitutional conduct. However, this argument has been rejected by the Constitutional Court, on the basis that it would make section 8(2) and (3) redundant. The 1996 Constitution specifically provides that private individuals are directly bound by the Bill of Rights in some instances, not in every instance. This means, in effect, that common-law rules and principles may only be directly tested against the Bill of Rights in so far as they are relied upon by actors who are directly bound by the Bill of Rights. Whenever such an actor, private or state, is bound, the Bill of Rights becomes directly applicable law which overrides the common law in so far as it is inconsistent with the Bill of Rights. In disputes between private parties regulated by common law, the extent to which the Bill of Rights applies to private conduct therefore determines its reach or direct application to the common law. = Direct horizontal application: duties of private actors  The near- redundancy of direct horizontal application  Like its predecessor, the 1996 Constitution provides for direct vertical application of the Bill of Rights but, unlike its predecessor, is not confined to this form of direct application. Section 8(2) clearly envisages direct application of the Bill of Rights in the horizontal relationship in certain circumstances, and therefore \\"points unequivocally toward a much broader conception of direct application.\\" The 1996 Constitution also still permits, however, in section 39(2) (as the Interim Constitution did in section 35(3)), indirect application of the Bill of Rights in horizontal cases. The presence of section 39(2), as Kentridge AJ stated, \\"prophetically,\\"Currie and De Waal Handbook 45. Note that Kentridge was discussing section 35(3) of the Interim Constitution, section 39(2)'s predecessor. in Du Plessis v De Klerk, \\"makes much of the vertical-horizontal debate irrelevant.\\" Since Du Plessis, the courts have routinely approached the issue of the effect of the Bill of Rights on the common law indirectly. The invitation of section 8(2)—to apply rights directly in horizontal situations—was \\"snubbed.\\"Currie and De Waal Handbook 45. For a while, therefore, direct horizontality, \\"this deliberate innovation in the Constitution,\\" threatened \\"to become a dead letter.\\" As Iain Currie and Johan de Waal observe, \\"Certainly, one attraction of indirect application was that courts did not have to confront the opacity and apparent circularity of s 8 (the Bill of Rights was to be applied to private actors 'where applicable').\\"Currie and De Waal Handbook 45. Their view is that indirect application was and remains preferred to direct application because of the principle of avoidance: \\"In common-law disputes between private parties, a direct application of the Bill of Rights will seldom offer significant advantages for a litigant over an indirect application. In most cases, a litigant will motivate for a change in the common law and it matters little whether a court is persuaded to do so with reference to an argument based on direct or indirect application. The only cases where direct application to the common law seems to make sense is when common-law offences or rules are challenged with the purpose of 'invalidating' them. An indirect application—that is the development of the common law—seems possible in such cases. The only other advantage of a direct application of the Bill of Rights may be found in the generous approach to standing which the courts apply in fundamental rights litigation\\" (45). Another reason for the reluctance of private parties to invoke the Bill of Rights directly is that constitutional remedies for the private violation of fundamental rights are \\"difficult to envisage or unattractive to litigants\\" (Currie and De Waal Handbook 46). When challenging legislation and state conduct, however, \\"constitutional remedies are not unattractive\\" (46). On the contrary, by removing parliamentary sovereignty and replacing it with constitutional supremacy, the Constitution has provided litigants with \\"a completely new basis to challenge legislation and state conduct\\" (46). Moreover, in areas where the South African public law was underdeveloped, the direct application of the Bill of Rights presented a litigant with \\"a useful tool to challenge state conduct\\" (46). Not only has the Bill of Rights and the rest of the Constitution \\"vastly increased the grounds for such a challenge\\" (46), but the remedy flowing from a finding of inconsistency between the Bill of Rights and state conduct is the invalidation of such conduct. \\"This remedy,\\" write Currie and De Waal, \\"will usually be an attractive one for a litigant\\" (46). In contrast, by extending the direct operation of the Bill of Rights to private relations, the 1996 Bill of Rights \\"has not contributed much to the resolution of private legal disputes\\" (46). In most cases, the remedies that apply to such disputes, particularly common- law remedies, \\"appear to be sufficiently flexible to be considered appropriate for a horizontal infringement of the Bill of Rights. It is, in any event, difficult to imagine alternative and more appropriate remedies for these types of infringements\\" (46). Whatever the reasons, indirect horizontality provided the default form of application by which the courts approached the common law. The trouble with this was that, besides rendering section 8(2) of the Constitution \\"irrelevant,\\" the \\"model of indirect application or, if you will indirect horizontality,\\" as Kentridge AJ pointed out in Du Plessis, \\"seems peculiarly appropriate to a judicial system which, as in Germany, separates constitutional jurisdiction from ordinary jurisdiction.\\"Para 60. But, under the 1996 Constitution, and in a deliberate alteration of the position under the interim Constitution, South Africa no longer separates constitutional jurisdiction from ordinary jurisdiction. Moreover, indirect application suggests that there is a body of common law that is \\"conceptually separate from the Constitution, exercising a mediating influence between the actors to whom it applies and the Constitution. This,\\" write Currie and De Waal, \\"is difficult to accommodate\\"Currie and De Waal Handbook 46. in the remodelled constitutional system in which there is \\"only one system of law.\\" The question of direct application was definitively settled by O'Regan J in Khumalo v Holomisa, \\"an extremely significant decision,\\"Currie and De Waal Handbook 46. where she held that \\"the right to freedom of expression is of direct horizontal application\\" to the law of defamation. By implication and in principle, that holding extends to other areas of private law. This case, the Constitutional Court's first use of the direct-horizontality provisions of the 1996 Constitution, > might be read as bringing to end the long reign of indirect application of > the Bill of Rights to the common law. It holds (although admittedly not in > so many words) that the Bill of Rights must be applied directly to the > common law wherever appropriate. It should be directly applied, in other > words, in many (perhaps most) of the horizontal cases that have previously > been treated as indirect application cases (ie, cases involving private > litigants relying on common-law provisions).Currie and De Waal Handbook 46. Khumalo, writes Stu Woolman, \\"committed the Constitutional Court to the proposition that common-law rules—whether challenged in disputes between the state and private parties or in disputes between private parties—were subject to the direct application of the Bill of Rights.\\"Woolman \\"Amazing\\" 768. However, despite Khumalo, indirect horizontal application \\"has proven to be extremely robust and remains the preferred judicial method for dealing with rights claims in the horizontal dimension.\\"Currie and De Waal Handbook 46.In a subsequent decision of the Constitutional Court, Thebus v S 2003 (6) SA 505 (CC), no reference was made to Khumalo or to any of the academic literature on the issue, and \\"the difficult relationship between s 8 and s 39. The court did hint, however, that section 39 (indirect application) was the default mode for considering challenges to the common law\\" (Currie and De Waal Handbook 46).See Woolman's accusations of laziness against the court in Khumalo, in its reliance on 39(2). In its only other encounter with direct horizontality, in Barkhuizen v Napier, the Constitutional Court declined to apply the Bill of Rights directly to a challenge to a time-limitation clause in an insurance contract. An insurance company had rejected an insurance claim on the grounds that, at the time of the accident, the vehicle was being used for business purposes, despite its being insured for private use only. Two years after the rejection of the claim, the insured issued summons against the insurance company for the insured amount. The summons was met with a special plea that a term of the insurance policy required any summons to be served within ninety days of the rejection of the claim. In his replication, the insured argued that the term requiring him to issue a summons within ninety days was a breach of section 34 of the Constitution. This gave the Constitutional Court the opportunity to consider what it termed the \\"proper approach\\" to the determination of constitutional validity of contractual clauses concluded between private parties. The High Court had considered the matter as an instance of direct application of section 34 to the contract, and had held that the impugned term of the contract was in conflict with the right. The clause, it held, was a law of general application, because it was underpinned by the principle of pacta sunt servanda. This analysis permitted the High Court to consider whether the limitation of section 34 by the contract was a justifiable limitation of the right. It was held not to be; the clause was declared invalid. The Constitutional Court expressed \\"grave doubt\\" about this approach, which entailed \\"testing the validity of a contractual term directly against a provision in the Bill of Rights.\\" Instead, the approach ordinarily to be adopted entailed indirect application via the principle that contracts that are contrary to public policy are unenforceable. This principle must be understood to be \\"deeply rooted in our Constitution and the values that underlie it.\\" This meant that > what public policy is and whether a term in a contract is contrary to public > policy is now to be determined by reference to the values that underlie our > constitutional democracy as given expression by the provisions of the Bill > of Rights. Thus a term in a contract that is inimical to the values > enshrined in our Constitution is contrary to public policy and therefore > unenforceable [...]. This approach leaves space for the doctrine of pacta > sunt servanda to operate, but at the same time allows courts to decline to > enforce contractual terms that are in conflict with the constitutional > values even though the parties may have consented to them. The view of Currie and De Waal is that Barkhuizen \\"largely renders s 8(2) nugatory.\\"Currie and De Waal Handbook 47. The Constitution applies to all law and, in the case of the common law (\\"the courts' own law\\"),Thebus para 21. the default approach of the courts is to assess its constitutionality and to develop it where necessary by way of the indirect application methodology set out below. \\"The only remaining reason\\"Currie and De Waal Handbook 47-48. to deploy direct horizontal application would be to take advantage of the holding of the Supreme Court of Appeal in Afrox Healthcare v Strydom, to the effect that courts in direct-application cases are not bound by pre-1994 decisions. See also in this regard Barkhuizen v Napier (See its consideration especially of pacta sunt servanda) and Fraser v ABSA.  How to interpret s 8(2)  The Bill of Rights binds private persons in certain circumstances. According to section 8(2), a provision of the Bill of Rights applies to the conduct of a private person or a juristic person only to the extent that the provision is applicable, taking into account the nature of the right and the nature of any duty imposed by the right. It binds a private or juristic person, in other words, if it is applicable to a private or juristic person. This, it has been noted, is almost tautological. In Khumalo, the Constitutional Court had regard to what it described as the \\"intensity of the constitutional right in question.\\" The meaning of this phrase, which Currie and De Waal regard as \\"opaque,\\" appears in context \\"to have something to do with the scope of the right.\\"Currie and De Waal Handbook 48. The applicants were members of the media (who are expressly identified as bearers of the constitutional right to freedom of expression). The second factor considered by the court was the \\"potential of invasion of that right by persons other than the State.\\" The result was a holding that the right to freedom of expression was horizontally applicable in a defamation case. In the view of Currie and De Waal, these two factors form part of a broader inquiry, consisting of five general considerations that must be kept in mind when interpreting s 8(2): # Section 8(2) states that a \\"provision\\" may apply to private conduct. It does not say that a \\"right\\" may apply to private conduct. Currie and De Waal argue that \\"it is therefore possible, and quite reasonable,\\"Currie and De Waal Handbook 48-49. that some provisions of the Bill of Rights may apply to the conduct of a private person or juristic persons, while other provisions in the same section (and pertaining to the same right) will not apply to such conduct. For example, the right of access to health care servicess 27(1) and (2). \\"probably does not apply directly horizontally.\\" However, the right not to be refused emergency medical treatment (s 27(3)) probably does apply horizontally.Currie and De Waal Handbook 49. Also, the freedom to make political choicess 19(1). and the right to votes 19(3). may be violated by private conduct, but the right to free, fair and regular elections only places duties on the state. # Questions concerning the horizontal application of the Bill of Rights cannot be determined a priori and in the abstract. Although this is not explicitly stated, whether a provision of the Bill of Rights applies horizontally also depends on the nature of the private conduct in question and the circumstances of a particular case. This explains why section 8(2) states that a provision in the Bill of Rights binds a natural or juristic person if, and to the extent that, it is applicable. The extent to which a provision is applicable can only be determined by reference to the context within which it is sought to be relied upon. For example, the right of every arrested person to be informed promptly of the right to remain silent is of a nature that makes it generally inapplicable to private arrests. But there may be circumstances in which the right should apply to private arrests. There is no reason why a private security officer, who knows of the existence of the section-35(1)(a) right, or who may reasonably be expected to know of the right, should not observe it. Conversely, the right to assemble peacefully and unarmed generally applies on the horizontal level. The right to assemble in, for example, shopping malls and on the property of an employer is therefore guaranteed. In some circumstances, however, it may be inappropriate to apply the right horizontally. For example, \\"it is unlikely that the right to assemble can be relied on to justify demonstrations in or in front of someone's private home.\\"Currie and De Waal Handbook 49. However, a resort to context or the circumstances of a particular case \\"should not be used to frustrate the clear intention of the drafters of the 1996 Constitution\\"Currie and De Waal Handbook 49. to extend the direct operation of the provisions of the Bill of Rights to private conduct: \\"It is not permissible to argue, for example, that it is only when private persons find themselves in a position comparable to the powerful state, that s 8(2) binds them to the Bill of Rights.\\"Currie and De Waal Handbook 49. It may be that most private or juristic persons do not have the capacity to infringe human rights in a manner and on a scale comparable to the state, \\"but any interpretation of s 8(2) must avoid relying on such generalisations. The subsection was after all included to overcome the conventional assumption that human rights need only be protected in vertical relationships.\\"Currie and De Waal Handbook 49. # The purpose of a provision is an important consideration in determining whether it is applicable to private conduct or not. For example, the purpose of the right to leave the Republics 21(2). is, in principle, to prevent the state from keeping persons captive in their own country. The right to reside anywhere in the Republics 21(3). is aimed at preventing the state from reintroducing group areas-style legislation that divides the country into racial zones. \\"It follows,\\" write Currie and De Waal, \\"that these rights are not intended to have general horizontal application. On the other hand, the purpose of the right to human dignity does not necessarily demand differentiation between state and private conduct.\\"Currie and De Waal Handbook 50. The right is to protect an individual against assault on his or her dignity from any source, whether private or public. The proper interpretation of a right in terms of its purpose may therefore sometimes result in a right's not being applicable to private conduct, either generally or in a particular situation. # The nature of any duty imposed by the right must be taken into account. This recognises that private or juristic persons are often primarily driven by a concern for themselves. On the other hand, the state is supposed to be motivated by a concern for the well-being of society as a whole: \\"The application of the Bill of Rights to private conduct should not undermine private autonomy to the same extent that it places restrictions on the sovereignty of the government.\\"Currie and De Waal Handbook 50. This consideration is of particular importance when it comes to the imposition of duties which entail the spending of money. Since the conduct of private persons has to be funded from their own pockets, the same duties may not be imposed on them as may be imposed on an organ of state which relies on public funds. For example, a private hospital cannot (unlike a state hospital) be saddled with the duty to provide every child with basic health care services.s 28(l)(c). # In some instances, indications are found in the Bill of Rights itself as to whether a particular right may be applied to private conduct or not. Section 9(4), for example, states that \\"no person\\" may discriminate, directly or indirectly, against anyone on one or more of the grounds listed in section 9(3). Similarly, section 12(1)(c) is explicitly made applicable to the conduct of private and juristic persons. The section states that the right to freedom and security of the person includes the right \\"to be free from all forms of violence from either public or private sources.\\" Subject to the five considerations discussed above, \\"it may be said,\\" write Currie and De Waal,Currie and De Waal Handbook 50. that the nature of citizenship rights,ss 20, 21(3)-(4). the right to just administrative action,s 33. and the rights of detained, arrested and accused persons,s 35. generally preclude them from being directly applied to private conduct. Also, the nature of the positive duties imposed by the right to have legislative and other measures taken to protect the environment,s 24(b). to realise the right to housing,s 26. the right to health care, food, water and social security,s 27. and the right to education,s 29. \\"would usually result in them not being applicable to private conduct.\\"Currie and De Waal Handbook 50. The remaining rights in the Bill of Rights can, depending on the circumstances of a particular case, be applied directly horizontally, so as to impose duties on private individuals to conform their conduct to the Bill of Rights. = Temporal application of the Bill of Rights  Which Constitution applies?  An unconstitutional law becomes invalid at the moment the Constitution comes into effect. This is the effect of the supremacy clause of the Constitution: All law and conduct inconsistent with the Constitution is invalidated by it. When making an order of invalidity, a court simply declares invalid what has already been made invalid by the Constitution. This means that an unconstitutional law in force at the time of commencement of the interim Constitution is invalidated by the interim Constitution with effect from 27 April 1994: \\"If the law is challenged in litigation brought during the period of operation of the 1996 Constitution, the invalidity of the law should be assessed in terms of the interim Constitution.\\"Currie and De Waal Handbook 51. The doctrine described above is known as \\"objective constitutional invalidity.\\" It means that an applicant will always have a choice between the interim and 1996 Constitutions when challenging old-order (pre-1994) laws. In other words, \\"nothing prevents an applicant whose cause of action arose after the commencement of the 1996 Constitution came into force from arguing that an old-order law was invalidated by the interim Constitution.\\"Currie and De Waal Handbook 51. For example, in Prince v President, Cape Law Society, the Constitutional Court held, in litigation brought under the 1996 Constitution, that the requirement in the Supreme Court ActAct 59 of 1959. that eleven judges of appeal sit in cases in which the validity of an Act of Parliament was in question was inconsistent with the interim Constitution. According to the Constitutional Court, the quorum requirement in the Supreme Court Act was in conflict with the interim Constitution, which expressly provided that the Appellate Division lacked jurisdiction to enquire into the constitutional validity of legislation. To the extent that the Supreme Court Act provided that the Appellate Division had jurisdiction to adjudicate the constitutionality of Acts of Parliament, it was invalid. Moreover, it had been invalid since the moment of commencement of the interim Constitution on 27 April 1994. \\"Clearly,\\" write Currie and De Waal, \\"there is no difficulty with the application of the rule in Prince if the interim Constitution and 1996 Constitution contain substantively identical provisions.\\"Currie and De Waal Handbook 51. If law in force at the time of commencement of the interim Constitution violates that Constitution, it is invalid with effect from April 27, 1994, and will remain an invalid violation of the 1996 Constitution, notwithstanding the repeal of the interim Constitution by its successor. Prince, however, confronts the situation of a law invalidated by a provision of the interim Constitution that has no equivalent in its successor. The 1996 Constitution granted the SCA the constitutional jurisdiction that it had been denied under the interim Constitution, including jurisdiction to adjudicate on the constitutional validity of Acts of Parliament. Did this mean that section 12(1)(b) was resuscitated? The Constitutional Court's answer was no: > Once section 12(1)(b) became invalid because of its inconsistency with the > interim Constitution, it could not be validated simply by the fact that > under the Constitution the SCA now has constitutional jurisdiction.

Currie and De Waal criticise this explanation as \\"evasive\\" and \\"far from clear.\\"Currie and De Waal Handbook 51. Despite this, \\"it is probably safe to say that, as a general rule, a law invalidated by the interim Constitution remains invalid after its repeal, notwithstanding any substantive difference that there might be in the provisions of the two Constitutions.\\" This, they argue, is \\"the logical implication\\" of item 2 of Schedule 6 of the 1996 Constitution: \\"All law that was in force when the new Constitution took effect, continues in force.\\" Repeal of the interim Constitution does not deprive it of the legal effect that it had while it was in force. One effect was the automatic invalidation of all inconsistent law. Such law is therefore not in force at the time of the transition to the 1996 Constitution and cannot be resuscitated by it. \\"Where the interim Constitution is more protective than the final,\\" observe Currie and De Waal, \\"the implications of Prince may be significant.\\"Currie and De Waal Handbook 52. For example, an applicant may choose to attack an old-order law for inconsistency with the right to freedom of economic activity,s 26 of the interim Constitution. rather than relying on the narrower right to professional freedom.s 22 of the 1996 Constitution. \\"Logically speaking,\\" Currie and De Waal Handbook 52. the doctrine of objective invalidity means that in the case of old-order legislation, invalidity must first be assessed in terms of the interim Constitution, notwithstanding that the cause of action may have arisen during the operation of the 1996 Constitution. \\"This, however, does not happen in practice.\\"Currie and De Waal Handbook 52. In Ex parte Women's Legal Centre: In re Moise v Greater Germiston Transitional Local Council (Moise II), the court dealt with an application to amend the order that it had made earlier, in Moise v Greater Germiston Transitional Local Council (Moise I). In Moise I, the court had confirmed the declaration of invalidity by a High Court of section 2(1)(a) of the Limitation of Legal Proceedings (Provincial and Local Authorities) Act.Act 94 of 1970. The point made by the applicants in Moise II was that the Limitation Act was pre-constitutional legislation. It was found by the High Court to be a violation of the right of access to court in s 34 of the 1996 Constitution. Section 22 of the interim Constitution also contained a right of access to court in all relevant respects identical to the one in s 34: \\"One would therefore have expected, in the light of the Prince decision, that the subsection had become invalid at the moment of commencement of the interim Constitution.\\" Currie and De Waal Handbook 52-53. The Constitutional Court dismissed the application for an amendment on the basis that the consistency of the Limitation Act with the interim Constitution had not been raised or canvassed in the High Court: \\"Arguably, and if properly raised, a court should consider whether a law should be declared [invalid] with reference to the interim Constitution if it survives a challenge under the 1996 Constitution.\\"Currie and De Waal Handbook 52. The rules and principles stated above apply to the Bill of Rights and not to the other provisions of the Constitution.  The non-retrospectivity rule  Neither the interim nor the 1996 Constitution is retrospective in its operation. A law is retrospective if it states that, at a past date, the law shall be taken to have been that which it was not, so as to invalidate what was previously valid or vice versa. Neither the interim nor the 1996 Constitution reaches backward so as to invalidate actions taken under laws valid at the time, even if those laws were contrary to fundamental rights. The corollary also holds: The Constitution cannot retrospectively validate actions that were unlawful in terms of pre-1994 law. Also, the Constitution does not interfere with rights that vested before it came into force. The rule that the Constitution does not apply retrospectively affects challenges to violations of human rights that occurred before the commencement of the Constitution. Put another way, the rule means that a litigant can only seek constitutional relief for a violation of human rights by conduct that occurred after commencement. As we have seen, the implication of the doctrine of objective constitutional invalidity is that on the date of the Constitution's commencement, laws that are inconsistent with the Constitution cease to have legal effect. But this does not mean that acts performed and things done under such (unconstitutional) laws before the Constitution came into force are also invalid. Since the Constitution does not operate retrospectively, they remain valid. An applicant who complains about such actions will not be allowed to challenge the constitutionality of the enabling laws. The constitutional validity of the enabling law becomes irrelevant since the conduct authorised by the law remains valid. The rule of non-retrospectivity only limits the \\"reach\\" of the Bill of Rights. In other words, it covers only the direct application of the Bill of Rights; it does not prevent the courts from applying the Bill of Rights indirectly to the law when developing the common law or interpreting a statute, even if the dispute arose before the commencement of the Constitution. This is because the post- constitutional development of the common law, or reading down of statutes with reference to the Constitution, does not result in the Constitution's working retroactively. \\"It is sometimes said,\\" the court noted in Du Plessis v De Klerk, \\"that 'judge-made law' is retrospective in its operation.\\"Para 65. Currie and De Waal contend that it is \\"always\\" so.Currie and De Waal Handbook 54. It must be added, however, that the Constitutional Court has not explicitly decided that the rule of non-retrospectivity does not hold for the indirect application of the Bill of Rights. In Du Plessis v De Kierk, the Constitutional Court expressly \\"left open\\"\\"It follows from what I have said above that those are matters which it is for the provincial and local divisions of the Supreme Court to decide as part of their function of applying section 35(3) and developing the common law. I do no more than respectfully draw their attention to the considerations which I have outlined. Whether appeals against judgments on such matters go to the Appellate Division or this Court, need not be decided now and should be left open\\" (Para 66). the question of whether a litigant could rely on section 35(3) of the interim Constitution in respect of a common-law claim which arose prior to the date on which the interim Constitution came into force. Kentridge AJ nevertheless remarked that \\"it may be that a purely prospective operation of a change in the common law will be found to be appropriate when it results from the application of a constitutional enactment which does not itself have retrospective operation.\\"Para 66. However, in Gardener v Whitaker, Kentridge AJ \\"seemed to condone the indirect application of the Bill of Rights to the law of defamation\\" in relation to an alleged defamation that took place before the commencement of the interim Constitution.'04 Similarly, in Key v Attorney- General a search and seizure of documents had been completed before the interim Constitution came into force. This meant that the statutory provisions authorising the search and seizure could not be attacked as violations of the Constitution. Kriegler J nevertheless stated that if the evidence obtained by way of the search and seizure was tendered in criminal proceedings against the applicant, he would be entitled to raise Constitution-based objections to its admissibility. While the non-retrospectivity rule prevented the applicant in Key from challenging the provisions of the Investigation of Serious Economic Offences ActAct 117 of 1991. before or during the trial, a discretion to exclude otherwise admissible evidence could be developed by indirectly applying the Bill of Rights. In Masiya v Director of Public Prosecutions,2007 (8) BCLR 827 (CC). the Constitutional Court accepted that retrospective consequences would ordinarily follow from the development of the common law in terms of section 39(2) of the Constitution. However, it held that, on the exceptional facts at issue—the development of the common-law definition of rape to include anal rape of a woman—the retrospective development would offend the principle of legality. Legality, noted the court, included the principle of foreseeability. The rules of criminal law had to be clear, so that individuals know which conduct is proscribed by law. The definition was accordingly held to apply only to conduct taking place after the judgment.  Application of the Bill of Rights to matters pending at the date of commencement  Court proceedings that commenced prior to the coming into effect of the interim or 1996 Constitutions, but which had not yet been finalised when those Constitutions took effect, are governed by item 17 of Schedule 6, which provides that court proceedings that commenced before the coming into effect of the 1996 Constitution, but after the coming into effect of the interim Constitution, must be decided in terms of the interim Constitution, unless the interests of justice require otherwise. Proceedings that commenced before the coming into effect of the interim Constitution must be dealt with in accordance with the law in force at the time, unless the interests of justice require otherwise. = Territorial application of the Bill of Rights = \\"Though it is obvious,\\" write Currie and De Waal, that the Constitution applies throughout the national territory, \\"it is less obvious whether it has any extraterritorial application.\\"Currie and De Waal Handbook 55. The question was considered by the Constitutional Court in Kaunda v President of the Republic of South Africa. The case arose from an incident in which the applicants, all South African citizens, had been arrested in Zimbabwe on charges that they had plotted to stage a coup in Equatorial Guinea. The applicants sought relief in the form of an order directing the South African government to seek assurances from the governments of Zimbabwe and Equatorial Guinea that the death penalty would not be imposed on the applicants. The basis of the application was a contention that the applicants' constitutional rights to a fair trial, to dignity, life and freedom and security of the person were being infringed in Zimbabwe, and were likely to be infringed if they were extradited to Equatorial Guinea. The state's duty to protect the rights of the applicants (stemming from section 7(2)) required them to be provided with diplomatic protection. This argument, Chaskalson CJ held for the majority of the court, required acceptance of the proposition that \\"the rights nationals have under our Constitution attach to them when they are outside of South Africa, or that the state has an obligation under section 7(2) to 'respect, protect, promote, and fulfil' the rights in the Bill of Rights which extends beyond its borders.\\" According to the court, to the extent that the Constitution provides the framework for the governance of South Africa, it is territorially bound and has no application beyond the borders of the Republic. As for the Bill of Rights, although foreigners are entitled to require the South African state to respect, protect and promote their rights, they lose the benefit of that protection when they leave the national territory. The argument of the applicant, to the effect that section 7(2) places a more extensive obligation on the state to respect, protect and promote the rights of South Africans when they are in foreign countries, was rejected. The bearers of the rights in the Bill of Rights are people in South Africa. The Bill of Rights does not have general application beyond the national territory. Section 7(1) does not deal with standing, but rather with the definition of the class of beneficiaries of the rights in the Bill of Rights. It therefore does not bar a foreign litigant who has a protectable interest in this country from seeking to protect that interest before a South African court.  Indirect application  Indirect application means that the Constitution and the Bill of Rights do not directly bind actors. Instead, the influence of the Bill of Rights is mediated through other law: statutory or common law. In principle, and where possible, a legal dispute should be decided in terms of the existing principles or rules of ordinary law, properly interpreted or developed with reference to the values contained in the Bill of Rights, prior to any direct application of the Bill of Rights to the dispute. When it comes to statutory law, the principle simply means that a court must first attempt to interpret legislation in conformity with the Bill of Rights (indirect application) before considering a declaration that the legislation is in conflict with the Bill of Rights and invalid (direct application). When it comes to the common law, the principle supports the courts' routine practice of developing the common law in conformity with the Bill of Rights (indirect application) in preference to assessing whether the common law is in conflict with the Bill of Rights (direct application). = Indirect application to legislation: the duty to interpret legislation in conformity with the Bill of Rights = Since the Bill of Rights binds all the original and delegated law-making actors, it is always capable of being applied directly to legislation. But, before a court may resort to direct application and to invalidation, it must first consider indirectly applying the Bill of Rights to the statutory provision by interpreting it in such a way as to conform to the Bill of Rights. Section 39(2) places a general duty on every court, tribunal or forum to promote the spirit, purport and objects of the Bill of Rights when interpreting any legislation. Statutory interpretation must positively promote the Bill of Rights and the other provisions of the Constitution, particularly the fundamental values in section 1. \\"This means,\\" according to the Constitutional Court in Investigating Directorate: Serious Economic Offences v Hyundai Motor Distributors (Pty) Ltd In re: Hyundai Motor Distributors (Pty) Ltd v Smit NO,2001 (1) SA 545 (CC). > that all statutes must be interpreted through the prism of the Bill of > Rights. All law-making authority must be exercised in accordance with the > Constitution. The Constitution is located in a history which involves a > transition from a society based on division, injustice and exclusion from > the democratic process to one which respects the dignity of all citizens, > and includes all in the process of governance. As such, the process of > interpreting the Constitution must recognise the context in which we find > ourselves and the Constitution's goal of a society based on democratic > values, social justice and fundamental human rights. This spirit of > transition and transformation characterises the constitutional enterprise as > a whole.Para 21. The court held further that \\"the purport and objects of the Constitution find expression in section 1 which lays out the fundamental values which the Constitution is designed to achieve.\\"Para 22. In other words, the legislature is presumed to have intended to further the values underlying the Bill of Rights by passing legislation that is in accordance with the Bill of Rights, unless the contrary is established. The duty of courts, tribunals or forums to interpret in accordance with the Bill of Rights applies even if a litigant has failed to rely on section 39(2). The duty is therefore extensive, \\"requiring courts to be alert to the normative framework of the Constitution not only when some startling new development of the common law is in issue, but in all cases where the incremental development of [... a common-law] rule is in issue.\\" The general duty to promote the Bill of Rights becomes particularly important when it is possible to avoid an inconsistency between a legislative provision and the Bill of Rights by interpreting the legislation so that it conforms to the Bill of Rights. Under the interim Constitution, such a process of interpretation became known as \\"reading down.\\" According to section 35(2) of the interim Constitution, where legislation was capable of being read in two ways—as a violation of fundamental rights or, if read more restrictively, as not violating rights—the latter reading was to be preferred. Section 35(2) is not repeated in the 1996 Constitution, but the courts and other tribunals are still permitted, and indeed required, to \\"read down\\" by virtue of section 39(2). In any event, section 35(3) of the interim Constitution, which is the predecessor to s 39(2), always encapsulated the notion of reading down without any need for it to be expressly spelled out in the section. In De Lange v Smuts, Ackermann J stated that \\"reading down\\" does > no more than give expression to a sound principle of constitutional > interpretation recognised by other open and democratic societies based on > human dignity, equality and freedom such as, for example, the United States > of America, Canada and Germany, whose constitutions, like our 1996 > Constitution, contain no express provision to such effect. In my view, the > same interpretative approach should be adopted under the 1996 > Constitution.Para 85 \\"Accordingly,\\" wrote Langa DP in Hyundai Motor Distributors, \\"judicial officers must prefer interpretations of legislation that fall within constitutional bounds over those that do not, provided that such an interpretation can be reasonably ascribed to the section.\\"Para 23. The duty to interpret in accordance with the Constitution applies also where two or more interpretations of a legislative provision are possible. The court must prefer the reading of a statute that \\"better\\" promotes the spirit, purport and objects of the Bill of Rights, even if neither interpretation would render the provision unconstitutional.  Methodology  In Govender v Minister of Safety and Security, the Supreme Court of Appeal set out a standard formula for dealing with constitutional challenges to legislation. A judge, magistrate or presiding officer of a tribunal is required * to examine the objects and purport of the Act or the section under consideration; * to examine the ambit and meaning of the rights protected by the Constitution; * to ascertain whether it is reasonably possible to interpret the Act or section under consideration in such a manner that it conforms to the Constitution (by protecting the rights therein protected); * if such interpretation is possible, to give effect to it; and, * if it is not possible, to initiate steps leading to a declaration of constitutional invalidity. This power of interpretation, \\"considerable though it is,\\"Currie and De Waal Handbook 59. is not unconstrained. As the Constitutional Court recognised in Hyundai Motor Distributors, > Limits must [...] be placed on the application of this principle. On the one > hand, it is the duty of a judicial officer to interpret legislation in > conformity with the Constitution so far as this is reasonably possible. On > the other hand, the legislature is under a duty to pass legislation that is > reasonably clear and precise, enabling citizens and officials to understand > what is expected of them. A balance will often have to be struck as to how > this tension is to be resolved when considering the constitutionality of > legislation.\\"Para 24. \\"Taken to its limit,\\" agree Currie and De Waal, > the power to interpret legislation in conformity with the Constitution would > mean that any legislative provision could be made to conform to the > Constitution by a suitably determined exercise of interpretative will. This > would make the powers of the courts to declare legislation invalid > superfluous and would deny the legislatures any significant role in the > interpretation of the Constitution.Currie and De Waal Handbook 59. Therefore, according to the Supreme Court of Appeal, an interpretation of legislation is constrained by the requirement that it must be \\"reasonably possible.\\" The Constitutional Court earlier expressed the same qualification in different words in the Hyundai Motor Distributors case: \\"There will be occasions when a judicial officer will find that the legislation, though open to a meaning which would be unconstitutional, is reasonably capable of being read \\"in conformity with the Constitution\\". Such an interpretation should not, however, be unduly strained.\\"Para 24. In National Coalition for Gay and Lesbian Equality v Minister of Home Affairs, it was said that > There is a clear distinction between interpreting legislation in a way which > \\"promote[s] the spirit, purport and objects of the Bill of Rights\\" as > required by s 39(2) of the Constitution and the process of reading words > into or severing them from a statutory provision which is a remedial measure > under s 172(1)(b), following upon a declaration of constitutional invalidity > under s 172(1)(a) [...]. The first process, being an interpretative one, is > limited to what the text is reasonably capable of meaning. The latter can > only take place after the statutory provision in question, notwithstanding > the application of all legitimate interpretative aids, is found to be > constitutionally invalid.Para 24. \\"It follows,\\" held the court in Hyundai Motor Distributors, \\"that where a legislative provision is reasonably capable of a meaning that places it within constitutional bounds, it should be preserved. Only if this is not possible should one resort to the remedy of reading in or notional severance.\\"Para 26. These qualifications may be taken to mean something along the lines of \\"plausible\\"—the result of the interpretative process must be a reading of the legislation that is defensible using \\"all legitimate interpretive aids,\\" by which is meant the repertoire of justificatory arguments supplied by the law of interpretation of statutes. The process of reaching a plausible, constitutionally-compliant interpretation entails reading legislation purposively and contextually. If the only plausible interpretation of a statutory provision is one that entails an infringement of the Bill of Rights, the court must proceed to consider whether the infringement is justifiable. If is not, it must declare the provision unconstitutional.  Interpretation in conformity is not confined to the restrictive reading of legislation  \\"Reading down\\" should perhaps be avoided as a description of the practice of interpretation in conformity with the Constitution, as it tends to suggest that the practice always entails reading restrictively. But section 39(2) sometimes requires more than simply narrowing the ambit of legislation so as to avoid conflict with rights. A narrow construction of a legislative provision will often have the result of avoiding an alleged conflict between the provision and the Bill of Rights: for example, when discretionary powers conferred are too wide, or when the scope of regulation is over-inclusive, or to restrict the impact of changes to the criminal law. But, on other occasions, the statute may have to be generously interpreted to avoid the conflict: for example, where the constitutional invalidity lies in the lack of any express grant of discretionary power. The point is that, if the statutory provision is genuinely ambiguous or otherwise unclear, the interpretation which best conforms to the Bill of Rights must be chosen. Section 39(2) does not have any bearing on the interpretation of the Constitution or the Bill of Rights; the subsection deals with statutory interpretation only. = Indirect application of the Bill of Rights to disputes governed by the common law  The obligation to develop the common law  As we have seen, legislation is approached by first interpreting it with the Constitution in mind, prior to any direct application of the Constitution (and any finding of unconstitutionality). In the case of the common law, the approach is similar but not identical, the difference lying in the remedial powers of the courts. If impugned legislation is found to limit a right, and if the limitation does not satisfy the justification standard in section 36, the court provides a remedy by declaring the legislation unconstitutional and, where possible, ameliorating the constitutional defect through reading in or notional or actual severance. \\"In that event,\\" according to Moseneke J in S v Thebus, \\"the responsibility and power to address the consequences of the declaration of invalidity resides, not with the courts, but pre-eminently with the legislative authority.\\" The Constitutional Court was unanimous on this issue. In Du Plessis v De Klerk, furthermore, the court noted that \\"the common law, it is often said, is developed on incremental lines. Certainly it has not been developed by the process of 'striking down.'\\"Para 63. But the common law is different. It is the law of the courts and not the legislature: > The superior courts have always had an inherent power to refashion and > develop the common law in order to reflect the changing social, moral and > economic make-up of society. That power is now constitutionally authonsed > and must be exercised within the prescripts and ethos of the Constitution. According to the court, the need to develop the common law under section 39(2) could arise in at least two instances: # The first was when a rule of the common law is inconsistent with a constitutional provision. Repugnancy of this kind would compel an adaptation of the common law to resolve the inconsistency. # The second possibility was that \\"a rule of the common law is not inconsistent with a specific constitutional provision but may fall short of its spirit, purport and objects.\\" If so, \\"the common law must be adapted so that it grows in harmony with the 'objective normative value system' found in the Constitution.\\" In a constitutional challenge of the first type the court must perform a \\"threshold analysis,\\" being whether the rule limits an entrenched right, if the limitation is not reasonable and justifiable, the court itself is obliged to adapt, or develop the common law in order to harmonise it with the constitutional norm. In its earlier decision in Carinichele, the Constitutional Court emphasised that the constitutional obligation to develop the common law is not discretionary, but is rather a \\"general obligation\\" to consider whether the common law is deficient and, if so, to develop it to promote the objectives of the Bill of Rights. The obligation applied in both civil and criminal cases, irrespective of whether or not the parties had requested the court to develop the common law.  The methodology of indirect application to the common law  The indirect application of the Bill of Rights to the common law can take many forms. The first method is to argue for a change in the existing principles of the common law so that the law gives better effect to Bill of Rights. This argument has been made in the areas of defamation and restraint of trade. In restraint of cases the argument that the incidence and content of the onus have to be reformed with reference to the section 22 right to occupational freedom has been less successful. The courts have been less inclined to reform the principles of the law of contract in a similar manner to the development of the law of delict. The second method is to \\"apply\\" the common law with due regard to the Bill of Rights. This method was employed by Davis AJ in Rivett- Carnac v Wiggins. Davis AJ declined to consider the constitutionality of the presumption relating to animus iniuriandi in defamation cases, but \\"clearly took the Bill of Rights into account in reaching the conclusion that the statements made in this particular case were not defamatory.\\"Currie and De Waal Handbook 59. Davis AJ held that the \\"boundary between criticising professional work without reducing such professional's reputation in the eyes of colleagues and the publication of defamatory statements about such a professional must be carefully drawn, particularly in the light of our new constitutional commitments.\\" The third method, which is closely related to the second, is to give constitutionally-informed content to open-ended common-law concepts, such as \\"public policy\\" or \\"contra bonos mores\\" or \\"unlawfulness.\\" This has been held to be the proper approach to Bill of Rights challenges to contractual provisions. Barkhuizen v Napier dealt with a contractual time-bar clause requiring action to be instituted against an insurer within ninety days of the rejection of an insurance claim. The insured contended that this clause infringed his right of access to court in terms of section 34. The approach to be adopted to this contention was to apply a \\"constitutionalised\\" conception of the common-law doctrine of public policy: a conception informed by the values given effect to in the Bill of Rights. The analysis then undertaken by the Constitutional Court in Barkhuizen essentially entailed an application of the test for the validity of legislative time-bar provisions set out in Mohlomi v Minister of Defence: A time-bar provision will unjustifiably limit the right of access to court if it is unreasonably short and if it is inflexible. If it is an unjustifiable limitation of section 34, it will be contrary to public policy and unenforceable. The justifiability of the provision had to be determined in the light of a number of factors, including the bargaining position of the respective parties and their ability to enforce their rights. In Barkhuizen, the court found that the applicant was well- resourced and there was nothing on the facts to explain why no steps had been taken to enforce his rights at the earlier stages. Similarly, the facts did not disclose the extent of the bargaining between the parties prior to the conclusion of the contract. It could not be said, for instance, whether the insured was in a weak bargaining position and could not influence the terms of the contract. Bredenkamp v Standard Bank is an application of the Barkhuizen methodology. The issue was whether the contractual right of a banker to close a client's account was subject to the requirements of fairness. The Supreme Court of Appeal held that the Constitution does not envisage the duty of fairness to apply in all contractual settings. Rather, one must consider the specific circumstances of each case to determine whether a constitutional value is implicated. If not, one cannot complain about an overarching requirement of fairness: \\"If a contract is prima facie contrary to constitutional values, questions of enforcement would not arise. However, enforcement of a prima facie innocent contract may implicate an identified constitutional value. If the value is unjustifiably affected, the term will not be enforced.\\" This means that fairness is not a self-standing requirement against which contractual clauses must be assessed: \\"Fairness is part of a matrix of constitutional values, which inform the interpretation of contracts. Such values are an embodiment of the legal convictions of the community. The autonomy of individuals to freely conclude contracts which are binding upon them is also part of the legal convictions of the community.\\"Currie and De Waal Handbook 63.  Limits on indirect application to the common law  A rule of the common law must be assessed for inconsistency with the Bill of Rights and, if necessary, developed within the \\"matrix of [... the] objective, normative value system\\" established by the Constitution. Courts have far more scope to \\"develop\\" the common law by way of indirect application than they have when they \\"interpret\\" legislation, where they are bound to a reasonable interpretation of the statute. Are there any limits on the power to develop the common law? The first limitation is that, when the common law is developed, it must be done incrementally and on a case by case basis. The development cannot take place in the abstract; the court must apply the law as it is found to be in the case before it. This approach has also found favour when the Bill of Rights is directly applied to the common law. Indeed, it is even more important when the Bill of Rights is directly applied, because the consequences of a direct application differ from those of an indirect application. For example, in Shabalala v Attorney-General, Transvaal, the Constitutional Court was careful, after striking down a common-law rule, to balance the need to provide guidance with the danger of being prescriptive. Such care must also be taken when the Bill of Rights is indirectly applied. \\"Some guidance on the new approach has to be provided,\\" write Currie and De Waal, \\"while room must be left for the courts to develop the principle on a case by case basis.\\"Currie and De Waal Handbook 63.  Stare decisis and indirect application  \\"One of the most important\\"Currie and De Waal Handbook 63. limitations on the power to develop the common law via the indirect application of the Constitution is the doctrine of stare decisis. In Govender v Minister of Safety and Security, reading down was employed to hold that section 49(l)(b) of the Criminal Procedure Act was not unconstitutional. In a subsequent decision, the Transkei High Court, in S v Walters, confronted with the precedent of the SCA decision in Govender, held that it did not have to follow it. Appeal-court decisions on the constitutional validity of legislation, according to Jafta AJP, \\"rank in the same level\\" as High Court decisions. The reason is that both decisions had no force unless confirmed by the Constitutional Court. Since, in the view of Jafta AJP, the SCA's decision on section 49(1)(b) in Govender was clearly wrong, it did not have to be followed by the High Court. The subsection was struck down to the extent that it permitted the use of force to prevent a suspect from fleeing. The High Court's approach to the issue was repudiated by the Constitutional Court in the confirmation proceedings: > The trial court in the instant matter was bound by the interpretation put on > section 49 by the SCA in Govender. The judge was obliged to approach the > case before him on the basis that such interpretation was correct, however > much he may personally have had his misgivings about it. High courts are > obliged to follow legal interpretations of the SCA, whether they relate to > constitutional issues or to other issues, and remain so obliged unless and > until the SCA itself decides otherwise or [... the Constitutional Court] > does so in respect of a constitutional issue. But this holding, Kriegler J emphasised, applied only to the binding effect of decisions of higher tribunals \\"delivered after the advent of the constitutional regime and in compliance with the requirements of section 39 of the Constitution.\\" The extent of application of stare decisis to pre-1994 decisions (if this is what \\"the advent of the constitutional regime\\" means), and to direct applications of the Constitution, was not decided. The subsequent decision of the Supreme Court of Appeal in Afrox v Strydom \\"fills the gap left open by the Constitutional Court.\\"Currie and De Waal Handbook 64. As regards the binding effect of pre-constitutional authority of the appeal court, there are three distinct situations that can arise: # Direct application of the Constitution to the common law: \\"The High Court is convinced that the relevant rule of the common law is in conflict with a provision of the Constitution.\\"Afrox v Strydom para 27, translated by Currie and De Waal Handbook 64. In such situations, pre-Constitutional authority is not binding on a High Court. # Pre-constitutional decisions of the appeal court based on open-ended considerations such as boni mores or public interest: In such situations, the High Court may depart from earlier authority if convinced, taking the values of the Constitution into account, that it no longer reflects the boni mores or the public interest. # The third situation is that of an indirect application of the Constitution to the common law, by way of section 39(2). Even if convinced that the rule must be developed to promote the spirit, purport and objects of the Bill of Rights, a High Court is obliged to follow the authority of pre-constitutional decisions of the appeal court. Currie and De Waal put Afrox and Walters together in the following way: * Post-constitutional decisions of higher courts are binding, whether they are on constitutional issues or not. * Pre-1994 decisions of higher courts on the common law are binding, except in cases of direct conflict with the Constitution or in cases involving the development of open-ended standards such as boni mores. The distinction between direct and indirect application is therefore \\"crucial to the impact of the Afrox decision.\\"Currie and De Waal Handbook 65. Section 39(2), the SCA holds, does not authorise lower courts to depart from higher authority, whether pre- or post-constitutional. The subsection must be read with section 173, recognising the inherent jurisdiction of the High Courts to develop the common law. It is that power which is exercised when the courts develop the common law in accordance with section 39(2). But the power has always been constrained by the doctrine of stare decisis: \\"There is nothing to indicate that the Constitution has changed this.\\"Currie and De Waal Handbook 65. The Afrox and Walters decisions have been strongly criticised. There is, however, \\"a significant omission from the Afrox decision.\\"Currie and De Waal Handbook 65. As we have seen, indirect application in terms of section 39(2) does not involve only development of the common law, but also statutory interpretation, taking the spirit, purport and objects of the Bill of Rights into account. But the SCA in Afrox \\"seems to confine itself to the first type of indirect application only.\\"Currie and De Waal Handbook 65. This may be taken to mean that \\"post-Afrox High Courts still possess the jurisdiction to depart from pre-constitutional statutory interpretations of the AD.\\"Woolman and Brand \\"Is there a Constitution\\" 79. Currie and De Waal argue that \\"a great deal also turns on the distinction between direct and indirect application.\\"Currie and De Waal Handbook 65. Khumalo v Holomisa appears to treat direct horizontal application as a relatively simple and unexceptional process. If so, \\"awkward appeal court precedent can easily be sidestepped. A High Court, by opting for direct application, will be understood to distinguish the case before it from a precedent arising from indirect application.\\"Currie and De Waal Handbook 65. = Manner of application of the Bill of Rights in legal disputes = Under the 1996 Constitution, there is only one system of law. The Constitution applies to all law, informing its interpretation and development by the courts and determining its validity. This means that the parallel systems of \\"constitutional\\" law and \\"non-constitutional\\" law (and \\"constitutional\\" and \\"non-constitutional litigation\\") developed under the interim Constitution are no longer theoretically sustainable. Nevertheless, the distinction between the direct and indirect methods of application of the Constitution to the law has not been abandoned and \\"continues to have some practical significance at least in so far as the common law is concerned.\\"Currie and De Waal Handbook 66.  Jurisdiction  We have seen that, under the interim Constitution, the distinction between direct and indirect application of the Bill of Rights had important jurisdictional implications. The interim Constitution distinguished between constitutional matters and other matters, and provided that the Constitutional Court could hear only the former and the Appellate Division only the latter. In Du Plessis, the Constitutional Court held that indirect application of the Bill of Rights to the common law was not a constitutional matter, and therefore was within Appellate Division jurisdiction. The main task of the Constitutional Court was to test the validity of the law and state conduct against the Constitution. In order to trigger the jurisdiction of the Constitutional Court, it was therefore necessary to show that the Bill of Rights applied directly to the challenged law or conduct. Whenever the Bill of Rights merely applied indirectly to a dispute, the Appellate Division and not the Constitutional Court was primarily responsible. Under the unitary jurisdictional system established by the 1996 Constitution, all superior courts have the power to apply the Constitution directly and indirectly to the common law. This means that the jurisdictional motivation for distinguishing between direct and indirect application no longer holds for common-law disputes. However, since decisions of the High Courts and the Supreme Court of Appeal declaring certain forms of legislation invalid must be confirmed by the Constitutional Court, \\"it remains important for jurisdictional reasons,\\"Currie and De Waal Handbook 66. whether legislation is directly tested against the Bill of Rights, or whether it is merely interpreted with reference to the Bill of Rights.  The purpose and effect of direct application differ from that of indirect application  The purpose of direct application is to determine whether there is, on a proper interpretation of the law and the Bill of Rights, any inconsistency between the two. The purpose of indirect application is to determine whether it is possible to avoid, in the first place, any inconsistency between the law and the Bill of Rights by a proper interpretation of the two. Direct application of the Bill of Rights generates a constitutional remedy, whereas indirect application does not. The reason for this is that direct application is aimed at exposing inconsistency between the Bill of Rights and law or conduct. If there is, the court then declares that law or conduct constitutionally invalid. The effect of such a declaration, according to Ackermann J and Sachs J in Du Plessis, is to restrict the legislature's options in amending the law or enacting a similar law. Much depends of course on the terms of the court's order and its reasoning and the application of the doctrine of stare decisis, but as a general rule direct application rules out certain possibilities as constitutionally impermissible, whereas an indirect application merely proposes a construction of the law that conforms to the Constitution. Although there is, therefore, a difference in principle between direct and indirect application, the problem alluded to by Ackermann J and Sachs J also depends on the extent to which a court is prepared to \\"pronounce on the meaning\\" of the Constitution: \\"Courts generally avoid making extensive pronouncements on what the Constitution demands the common law to be, whether they apply the Bill of Rights directly or indirectly.\\"Currie and De Waal Handbook 67. The preferred approach is to give narrow rulings limited to the facts before the court: \\"Such orders will preserve considerable space for the legislature to reform the common law.\\"Currie and De Waal Handbook 67. Direct application, however, \\"inevitably rules out certain options.\\"Currie and De Waal Handbook 67. When a law or conduct is ruled to be inconsistent with the Constitution, it can no longer form part of the law. The scope of the limitation on the legislature's discretion will therefore depend on the extent of the court's ruling. That said, there is little practical difference between the two forms of application when it comes to the common law. This is because, although notionally methodologically distinct, direct and indirect application of the Bill of Rights end up at the same point: the need to develop rules of the common law in conformity with the Bill of Rights. \\"There are,\\" observe Currie and De Waal, \\"only a few common-law cases where the method of application is likely to make a substantive difference to the result.\\"Currie and De Waal Handbook 66. These are cases in which a plaintiff cannot find a cause of action in the existing common law. Since the common law does not provide a right, it will be necessary to invoke directly a right in the Bill of Rights.  Indirect application must be considered before direct application  In S v Mhlungu, Kentridge AJ stated, > I would lay it down as a general principle that, where it is possible to > decide any case, civil or criminal, without reaching a constitutional issue, > that is the course which should be followed. This statement was subsequently approved by the unanimous court in Zantsi v Council of State, Ciskei. In this case, Chaskalson P referred to the \\"salutary rule\\" which is followed in the United States \\"never to anticipate a question of constitutional law in advance of the necessity of deciding it\\" and \\"never to formulate a rule of constitutional law broader than is required by the precise facts to which it is to be applied.\\" This rule, Chaskalson P added, > allows the law to develop incrementally. In view of the far-reaching > implications attaching to constitutional decisions, it is a rule which > should ordinarily be adhered to by this and all other South African Courts > before whom constitutional issues are raised [.... I]t is not ordinarily > desirable for a Court to give rulings in the abstract on issues which are > not the subject of controversy and are only of academic interest. There are several reasons for observing this \\"salutary rule\\" under the South African Constitution. The first is procedural. The interim Constitution contained complicated provisions governing the referral of a constitutional issue to the Constitutional Court where that issue was beyond the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court. A referral was, for example, necessary whenever the constitutionality of an Act of Parliament was in dispute. The statements in Mhlungu and Zantsi \\"were meant to deter the divisions of the Supreme Court from referring irrelevant issues or issues that were within their jurisdiction to the Constitutional Court.\\"Currie and De Waal Handbook 68. Since the system of referrals has now been replaced by a wider High Court jurisdiction and a system of appeals, this justification should no longer carry the same weight. However, it would be wrong to conclude that the justification did not survive the changes in constitutional jurisdiction brought about by the 1996 Constitution and the abolition of referrals. It remains an important factor when considering applications for direct access to the Constitutional Court and applications for leave to appeal using the \\"leapfrog\\" appeal procedure. It also informs the doctrine of justiciability, particularly the principles that courts should not decide moot cases or cases that are not ripe for judicial resolution. There are also substantive reasons for observing the rule: \\"Courts should avoid making pronouncements on the meaning of the Constitution where it is not necessary to do so, so as to leave space for the legislature to reform the law in accordance with its own interpretation of the Constitution.\\" Currie and De Waal Handbook 69. Lengthy expositions of the Constitution may result in actual or perceived restrictions on the legislature, a \\"constitutional straitjacket\\" which makes it difficult for the legislature to respond to changing circumstances.Currie and De Waal Handbook 69. The courts, and particularly the Constitutional Court, are not the only interpreters of the Constitution. They are, however, its final and authoritative interpreters. Before pronouncing on the meaning of the Constitution, \\"the courts should allow other organs of the government the opportunity to interpret and give effect to the Constitution.\\"Currie and De Waal Handbook 69. Practically, this means that the legislature should be given the opportunity to address an issue before a court decides on it: \\"The legislature and the executive are better equipped to ascertain the needs of society and to respond to those needs.\\"Currie and De Waal Handbook 69. Once such a response finds expression in legislation, courts may then test the legislation against the provisions of the Bill of Rights. Even then, the Constitutional Court (the final court in constitutional matters) often seeks to avoid ruling on the constitutionality of a statutory provision until trial, and appeal-court judges have expressed their views on the effect of the provision and the likely consequences of invalidating it. \\"It is sound judicial policy,\\" write Currie and De Waal, \\"to decide only that which is demanded by the facts of a case and that is necessary for its proper disposition; this allows constitutional jurisprudence to develop incrementally.\\"Currie and De Waal Handbook 69. When applying the Bill of Rights in a legal dispute, the principle of avoidance is \\"of crucial importance.\\"Currie and De Waal Handbook 69. As we have seen, the Bill of Rights always applies in a legal dispute. It is usually capable of direct or indirect application and, in a limited number of cases, of indirect application only. The availability of direct application is qualified by the principle that the Bill of Rights should not be applied directly in a legal dispute unless it is necessary to do so. The principle has \\"a number of important consequences.\\"Currie and De Waal Handbook 69. Even when the Bill of Rights applies directly, a court must apply the provisions of ordinary law to resolve the dispute, especially in so far as the ordinary law is intended to give effect to the rights contained in the Bill of Rights. Many recent statutes, such as the Labour Relations Act 66 of 1995 and the Equality and Administrative Justice Acts are intended to implement the Bill of Rights. They must first be applied, and if necessary interpreted generously to give effect to the Bill of Rights, before a direct application is considered. The same applies to disputes governed by the common law. The ordinary principles of common law must first be applied, and if necessary developed with reference to the Bill of Rights, before a direct application is considered. When the Bill of Rights is directly applied in disputes governed by legislation, conduct must be challenged before law. In other words, the implementation of the statute must be challenged before the provisions of the statute itself. However, \\"to complicate matters further,\\" Currie and De Waal Handbook 70. the principle that constitutional issues should be avoided is not an absolute rule. It does not require that litigants may only directly invoke the Constitution as a last resort. As with many legal principles, its force depends on the circumstances of the case. Where the violation of the Constitution is clear and directly relevant to the matter, and there is no apparent alternative form of ordinary relief, it is not necessary to waste time and effort by seeking a non-constitutional way of resolving a dispute. This will often be the case when the constitutionality of a statutory provision is placed in dispute because, apart from a reading down, there are no other remedies available to a litigant affected by the provision. On the other hand, the principle of avoiding constitutional issues is particularly relevant when the interest of an applicant in the resolution of a constitutional issue is not clear, and where the issue is not ripe for decision, or when it has become academic or moot.

He is the author of Subversives: The FBI's War on Student Radicals, and Reagan's Rise to Power, published in hardback in 2012 by Farrar, Straus and Giroux, and in paperback in 2013 by Picador. Subversives was a New York Times best-seller and won the 2013 Ridenhour Prize for books; PEN Center USA's Literary Award for Research Nonfiction; the National Society of Professional Journalists' Sunshine Award; and the American Book Award from the Before Columbus Foundation. Rosenfeld was a staff reporter for the San Francisco Examiner from 1984 to 2000, and for the San Francisco Chronicle from 2000 to 2009. Since then his articles have appeared in the New York Times, The Los Angeles Times, The San Francisco Chronicle, Harper's Magazine, and other publications. He is a contributor to the Center for Investigative Reporting and the center's Reveal. During the 1980s, Rosenfeld's reports for the San Francisco Examiner revealed that poor medical care in California prisons had led to inmate injuries and costly legal settlements. He also disclosed that California's massive prison construction program suffered from construction flaws, cost overruns, and fire and safety problems. In other articles, Rosenfeld reported alleged links between contra rebels seeking to overthrow the Sandinista government of Nicaragua and a cocaine smuggling ring in the so-called Frogman Case. One story reported that federal prosecutors had returned $36,020 that had been seized as drug funds to one of the Frogman defendants after he claimed it was actually money to support the contras. The articles led to congressional inquiries, and a subsequent report released by the U.S. Department of Justice's Inspector General found that the prosecutors had returned the money at the request of the CIA. According to the Inspector General's report, the prosecutors made no determination as to whether the cash was really contra political money, but sought to eliminate grounds for defense attorneys to ask questions that could reveal the CIA's covert support of the contras. The late journalist Gary Webb cited Rosenfeld as first disclosing this aspect of the contra-cocaine story. In the 1990s, Rosenfeld's series, Anatomy of a Killing, revealed a systemic breakdown in the San Francisco Police Department's investigation into an officer's fatal shooting of a young man in the back. A second series, Shots Fired, uncovered flaws in the department's investigations into several other police shootings of suspects, and showed that the department's failure to fairly investigate police shootings fell hardest on people who were minorities or low-income. The articles prompted the department to re-examine how it investigated officer-involved-shootings and won a Mencken Award from the Free Press Association. Rosenfeld received a 1992 George Polk Award for articles in the Examiner revealing internal Dow Corning Corp. documents that showed the company knowingly marketed defective silicone gel breast implants that leaked inside women and caused them to undergo otherwise avoidable surgeries to remove the implants. The articles led the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to impose a moratorium on the use of implants and adopt rules restricting the use of silicone. The Polk judges said, \\"Rosenfeld's determination to look beyond an obscure verdict and his newspaper's dedication to public service sparked a national debate and prompted reforms that otherwise might not have happened.\\" In 2002, the Chronicle published Rosenfeld's article, The Campus Files, which was based on FBI records showing that the bureau had engaged in unlawful surveillance and harassment of students, professors and administrators at the University of California in the 1960s. The articles led to inquires by U.S. Senator Dianne Feinstein and a response from then-FBI Director Robert Mueller that the FBI's covert activities at UC were \\"wrong and anti-democratic.\\" The Campus Files won several national awards. In Subversives, Rosenfeld expanded his examination of FBI activities at UC during the Cold War, documenting how J. Edgar Hoover's FBI secretly worked to get UC President Clark Kerr fired because bureau officials disagreed with his campus policies; harassed Free Speech Movement leader Mario Savio; and gave personal and political help to Ronald Reagan, who had been a more active FBI informant in Hollywood than previously known. On August 20, 2012, Rosenfeld's report for the Center for Investigative Reporting alleged that Richard Aoki was an FBI informant who had infiltrated chapters of the Communist Party, the Socialist Workers' Party and, nearly from its inception, the Black Panther Party. In response to a FOIA request by Rosenfeld, it was revealed that a November 16, 1967 FBI intelligence report listed Aoki as an informant with the code number \\"T-2\\". FBI agent Burney Threadgill Jr. also said that he worked with Aoki, stating, \\"He was my informant. I developed him.\\" Bibliography *Subversives: The FBI's War on Student Radicals, and Reagan's Rise to Power.

Early life Lotf Ali Khan Zand came to power after a decade of infighting among a succession of violent and inept Zand chiefs following the death in 1779 of the dynasty's founder, Karim Khan Zand. Their failure to agree on a successor and to govern with the same benevolence as Karim Khan eroded public faith in the Zands. An increasing number of local and regional leaders began aligning themselves with the eunuch Agha Mohammad Khan Qajar, who sought to defeat and succeed the Zands. The son of Jafar Khan, Lotf Ali Khan claimed the throne in 1789 upon the death of his father. Jafar Khan had been poisoned by a slave bribed by a rival family member, Sayed Morad Khan Zand. On hearing of his father's murder, Lotf Ali Khan marched to the Zand capital of Shiraz. Sayed Morad Khan was forced to surrender and was executed.  Reign  Lotf Ali Khan Zand with his minister Mirza Hossein Soon after assuming his title, Lotf Ali Khan's principal rival, Agha Mohammad Khan of the Qajar dynasty, marched south to Shiraz. Their two armies met outside of the city in a battle in which Agha Mohammad Khan prevailed, using camels to scare the Zand horses on the battlefield. Despite this defeat, the Zand leader was able to hold Shiraz until the Qajar forces withdrew to Tehran. The following year, 1790, Lotf Ali Khan led his forces against the Governor of Kerman, who had refused to appear in person to acknowledge the Zand leader. This campaign failed due to harsh winter conditions which led to the loss of a large number of men. In 1791, Lotf Ali Khan marched to reestablish his control over Isfahan. He had grown increasingly suspicious of the loyalties of Haji Ibrahim, the kalantar of Shiraz. As a result, he took the kalantar's son with him. Once the Zand army had left the city, Haji Ibrahim had the remaining Zand officers arrested and sent word to his brother, a member of Lotf Ali's army, that the city was now under his control. A mutiny ensued and Lotf Ali and several hundred loyal soldiers fled back to Shiraz, where they found the gates barred against them. Fearing reprisals against their families locked within the gates, most of Lotf Ali's men deserted him. With only a handful of followers remaining, the Zand ruler then fled to Bushehr. Here, too, he encountered a hostile local leader. With the help of a sympathetic governor in the port city of Bandar Rig Lotf Ali Khan managed to raise a small army made up of sympathetic locals. With their help, Lotf Ali defeated an attack from Bushire and Kazerun. The governor of Kazerun was captured and blinded, an impulsive act by Lotf Ali Khan that \\"weakened the sympathy which his youth, his courage, and his misfortunes were so calculated to incite.\\"Malcolm, John, The History of Persia, Vol. II, Part 1,1829 Emboldened, Lotf Ali Khan returned to Shiraz, which Haji Ibrahim had offered to Agha Mohammad Khan. There he defeated an army led by Mostafa Qoli Khan Qajar. Lotf Ali Khan's smaller force also succeeded in repelling the attack of a second Qajar force. At this point, Agha Mohammad Khan himself led 30–40 thousand men against the much smaller Zand army. Battle between Lotf Ali Khan and Agha Mohammad Khan Qajar. In a pivotal battle near Persepolis whose outcome would determine the leadership of the nation, Lotf Ali Khan gained the upper hand over the much larger Qajar army, launching a nighttime raid on the main camp of the Agha Mohammad Khan. As the Qajar soldiers scattered, Lotf Ali assumed Agha Mohammad Khan had fled with them and that the camp was secured. He forbade his men from plundering the camp and withdrew to wait for sunrise. But Agha Mohammad Khan had remained hidden in the royal pavilion. At dawn the call to prayer signaled that the Qajar army had regrouped. Lotf Ali Khan had no choice but to retreat. (An alternate version of this story suggests that Lotf Ali Khan was tricked into waiting until daybreak to enter the enemy camp on advice of a Qajar spy named Mirza Fathollah-e Ardelani.)Busse, Heribert, History of Persia Under Qajar Rule (Translation of Farsnama-ye Naseri by Hasan-e Fasat), , Columbia Univ. Press, 1972, p.33-58 He and his followers fled first to Kerman (1792), but with the Qajars in pursuit they were forced to Tabas. With the aid of a sympathetic governor in Tabas, Lotf Ali attempted without success to retake Shiraz. At this time, the former Zand capital was firmly under the control of Agha Mohammad Khan. In July 1792, the Qajar shah ordered the family and harem of Lotf Ali Khan and other Zand nobles and their families sent to his new capital, Tehran. Repelled in his effort to reclaim Shiraz, Lotf Ali Khan decided to travel east to Kandahar in modern-day Afghanistan to solicit the aid of Timur Shah, but after a few days he learned of Timur Shah's death. Feeling indecisive and depressed Lotf Ali Khan turned back. His spirits were restored by pledges of support from tribal leaders from Bam and Narmashir. Bolstered by an additional 1,000 horsemen Lotf Ali Khan took Kerman in 1794. He held the city for four months against Agha Mohammad Khan and a large army. During this time gold coins were struck in Kerman in tribute to the Zand leader. One of these coins found its way to Agha Mohammad Khan who was so enraged that he sent orders that Fatollah Khan, the son of Lotf Ali who had been taken to Tehran with other Zand nobility, was to be castrated. As the siege of Kerman wore on, some troops became disaffected and ultimately opened the citadel gates to the Qajar army. After a three-hour battle Lotf Ali fled by night to Bam. Agha Mohammad Khan exacted a brutal revenge on the people of Kerman for harboring his enemy. All the male inhabitants were killed or blinded, and a pile was made out of 20,000 detached eyeballs and poured in front of the victorious Qajar leader.Hasan Pir Nia, A.

Captivity and death Miniature portrait of Lotf Ali Khan e Z and 18th century AD National Museum of IranFinally, Lotf Ali Khan was betrayed by the ruler of Bam who feared that his brother had fallen into Qajar hands in Kerman. Lotf Ali Khan was captured soon after, nearby. According to legend, Lotf Ali Khan fought 14 men single-handedly for two full hours before falling. The last of the Zand rulers was finally delivered to Agha Mohammad Khan Qajar, who had long waited to exact revenge on his arch-rival. \\"The page of history would be stained by a recital of the indignities offered to the royal captive...\\" It is reported that Lotf Ali Khan was blinded. Lotf Ali Khan was imprisoned and tortured in Tehran before being choked to death in the late of 1794. Legacy The British writer Sir Harford Jones Brydges knew Lotf Ali, whom he called, \\"the last chivalrous figure among the kings of Persia.\\" Brydges writes sadly of Lotf Ali's death, of his \\"little son\\" who was castrated, his daughters who were forced to marry \\"the scum of the earth\\" and his wife who was dishonoured.Brydges, Harford Jones, An Account of the Transactions of His Majesty's Mission to the Court of Persia in the Years 1807–11, 1834 Accounts of Lotf Ali Khan's personality and behavior depict a person of courage and perseverance who inspired great loyalty among his followers. Had he been able to defeat Agha Mohammad Khan, he might have restored his family's dynasty and its good name. But a fatal mistake in a pivotal battle effectively ended Lotf Ali Khan's ambitions. With his defeat, the 44-year reign of the Zands came to an end and the first chapter in the 131-year Qajar Dynasty was written. His tomb is in Emamzadeh Zeid in the Old Bazaar of Tehran. His portrait is in the Museum of Fine Arts in Sadabad Palace. It is said that Lotf Ali Khan was uniquely handsome and tremendously skillful with the sword. Today one of the main avenues in Shiraz bears Lotf Ali Khan Zand's name. In Shiraz and other cities, streets bear the name of the Zand patriarch Karim Khan. They are the only former rulers of Persia whose names have been preserved in this way in the post-revolutionary period. This is largely due to the fact that Karim Khan Zand never claimed the title of king or shah, but chose simply to declare himself the advocate or regent of the people.

Early life and education  Born in Kadhimiya, Baghdad in 1913, to a religious and a very traditional family. He grew up defying his family's strict no-modern-education policy, where his father wanted him to learn a craft instead of reading books. Nevertheless, Al-Wardi grow up with a disliking for work and a strong liking for books. He managed to finish his elementary and high school and awarded the number one student on the Kingdom of Iraq. He later was appointed as a teacher in many elementary and high schools across Iraq, before winning a scholarship to the American University of Beirut where he received his Bachelor's degree in 1943. He was back to Iraq and was forced to be married by his father's orders. A few years later, he traveled to the United States to attain his Masters and Ph.D. degrees. He earned his Masters degree in 1948 from The University of Texas and his Ph.D. in 1950 from the same university. During that time he used to spend his summers in the United Kingdom learning English in available institutes.  Career  He came back to Iraq to start his career in writing many of his books based on the theory of Ibn Khaldun about Al-Badwa (Nomadic society) vs Al-Hadhara (Civil society).

He was also a member of the keshik.  Career  A member of the Sunud tribe, Chormaqan is mentioned in The Secret History of Mongols many times. He probably participated in the Mongol campaigns in North China and later in the Subutai's and Jebe's famous journey through Caucasus and Russian steppes. He was a quiver bearer, as such often mentioned in sources as \\"Qurchi\\". Appointed by Ögedei in the winter of 1230 to renew the Mongol conquests in Persia, which had languished since Genghis Khan's assault on and near destruction of the Khwarezmid Empire from 1218 to 1223. His army reportedly consisted of from 30.000 to 50.000 men. At the approach of Chormagan and the new Mongol army, the Khwarezmids under Jalal ad-Din were swept away. Further campaigns in the mid-1230s, based from the steppes in Azerbaijan around Tabriz, firmly established the Kingdom of Georgia and Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia as vassals. It is theorized that these moves may have been made to secure communications for the attack westward led by Batu that followed shortly thereafter. Chormaqan also received submission of Qutlugkhanids in Kerman, whose ruler Buraq Hajib sent his son Rukn al-Din Mubarak Khwaja to Ögedei's court. Another local noble who submitted was Salghurid atabeg Abu Bakr b. Sa'd I, who sent his brother or nephew Tahamtan to Karakorum. Isfahan didn't submit to Mongol rule, therefore he had to lay a siege to there in 1236. Upon submission of Georgian and Armenian feudals, he divided Georgia up to 8 tumens and set up Ganja as his powerbase, although some sources state he Ani, Kars and environs. His rule weakened in 1239 on arrival of Chinqai and Korguz to Khorasan, to whom fiscal administrator was transferred by Ögedei. Chormaqan died around 1241 and was replaced by Baiju, his lieutenant.  Family  His wife Altani held considerable amount of influence in ordo, upon whose suggestion Baiju was appointed. His son Shiramun later served under the Il-khans Hulagu and Abaqa.Jackson, Peter (December 15, 1993). Čormāgūn. Encyclopædia Iranica. His daughter Esukan was married to King David VII of Georgia.

He was a member of the South Australian House of Assembly from 1885 until his death in 1891, representing the electorate of Wallaroo. Bews was born near Kirkwall, in the Orkney Islands of Scotland, and went to South Australia with his parents the following year. In 1853, during the gold rush in Victoria, his family removed to that colony, but only to return one year later. Bews' father then engaged in farming operations near Port Elliot, and afterwards near Adelaide. Bews was educated at Allen Martin's school in Port Adelaide then worked as a farmer until he reached the age of majority, when he secured a position as clerk with the Kadina & Wallaroo Railway Company. He subsequently became goods manager, but seven years later (in 1878), when the Government took over the line, he left the service to work for the Kadina and Wallaroo Times. He soon became editor of the newspaper, serving in that position for the rest of his life. He was mayor of the Corporate Town of Wallaroo from 1880 to 1882, besides which he was a member of the Yorke's Peninsula Board of Main Roads and the School Board of Advice. Bews was elected to the South Australian House of Assembly on 16 February 1885, at a by-election following the resignation of Henry Allerdale Grainger; he had previously contested and lost the seat at the 1884 election. Bews was re-elected on 19 March 1887, and at the 1890 election. In August of that year he accepted the office of Minister of Education in Thomas Playford II's Government. Bews, who had been appointed one of the South Australian delegates at the Postal Convention, died in Melbourne whilst en route to Sydney on 24 February 1891.

Adams was a leader of South Carolina Militia forces during the American Revolution and also served in the Continental Army. Adams married Grace Weston, daughter of William Weston, and they had seven children. Adams was instrumental in the successful agricultural development of central part of South Carolina in the 18th century, and was influential in the political structure of the state being centered in Columbia, South Carolina at the time. He was a strong proponent of education, and of military and political service to state and to country, and served in the South Carolina House of Representatives.

(c. 1720 – 19 March 1801irishargentine.org) born Ambrose Bernard O'Higgins (Ambrós Bearnárd Ó hUiginn, in Irish), was an Irish-Spanish colonial administrator and a member of the O'Higgins family. He served the Spanish Empire as captain general (i.e., military governor) of Chile (1788–1796) and viceroy of Peru (1796–1801). Chilean independence leader Bernardo O'Higgins was his son.Stephen Clissold, \\"The O'Higgins of Chile\\" History Today (June 1957) 7#6 pp396-403; father and son. Early life A member of the O'Higgins family, Ambrose was born at his family's ancestral seat in Ballynary, County Sligo, Ireland; the son of Charles O'Higgins and his wife (and kinswoman) Margaret O'Higgins,The National Genealogical Office (Dublin), MS 165. pp. 396–399. who having lost their lands in Sligo migrated and became tenant farmers at Clondoogan near Summerhill in County Meath ca. 1721.Ibañez Vergara, Jorge. Demetrio O'Higgins. Along with other members of his family Ambrose worked in the service of the Rowley-Langford family of Summerhill House. In 1751, O'Higgins arrived at Cádiz, where he dedicated himself to commerce as an employee of the Butler Trading House. As an Irishman and a Catholic, he was able to emigrate legally to Spanish America in 1756. Once there, and for some time, he was an itinerant trader in Venezuela, New Granada, and Peru, but, being investigated by the Inquisition, he moved to La Plata Colony, in present-day Argentina, where he tried some commercial ventures. From there, O'Higgins proposed to open easy communication between Chile and Mendoza by a way over the Andes, and, his proposition being accepted, he was employed to supervise the project.Donoso, Ricardo. (1941) \\"El Marqués de Osorno, Don Ambrosio Higgins\\" (Santiago: University of Chile Press). In Chile About 1760, O'Higgins enrolled in the Spanish Imperial Service as draughtsman and then engineer. He was directly responsible for the establishment of a reliable postal service between La Plata colony and the General Captaincy of Chile. On his first harrowing journey over the Andes mountains separating Argentina and Chile during the winter of 1763–64, O'Higgins conceived the idea of a chain of weatherproof shelters. By 1766, thanks to O'Higgins' efficient execution of this plan, Chile enjoyed all-year overland postal service with Argentina, which had previously been cut off for several months each winter.Clissold, 1957. In 1764, John Garland, another Irish engineer at the service of Spain who was military governor of Valdivia, convinced him to move to the neighbouring, and less established, colony of Chile as his assistant. He was initially commissioned as a junior subaltern in the Spanish army. Following the designs of O'Higgins the mountain huts known as Casuchas del Rey were built in the 1760s to secure communications across the Andes. In 1770 the Governor of Chile appointed him, now in his late forties, captain of a column of cavalry to resist the attacks of the Araucanian Indians, whom he defeated, founding the fort of San Carlos in the south of the province of Arauco. He gained the good-will of the Indians by his humanity and benevolence, and recovered big swathes of territory that had been lost by the Spaniards. He rose quickly in the ranks. On 7 September 1777, the viceroy Manuel de Amat promoted him to colonel. He soon rose to be brigadier, and in 1786 the viceroy Teodoro de Croix appointed him Intendant of Concepción. In 1788, in return for his efforts in South America, King Charles III of Spain created O'Higgins 1st Barón de Ballinar (a title in the peerage of Spain, and not to be confused with the family's existing Gaelic title), and promoted him to major-general. Soon afterward he became Captain General and Governor of Chile. As Governor of Chile As governor of Chile, one of the most troublesome, poor, and remote of Spanish outposts, O'Higgins was extremely active, promoting the construction of a definitive road between the capital Santiago and the port of Valparaíso (part of the layout of which is still in use today), continued the building of the Palacio de la Moneda in Santiago, improved roads, and erected permanent dikes along the banks of the Mapocho river which regularly flooded Santiago. He founded cities including San Ambrosio de Ballenary, now Vallenar (1789); Villa de San Francisco de Borja de Combarbalá, now Combarbalá (1789); Villa San Rafael de Rozas, now Illapel (1789); Santa Rosa de los Andes, now Los Andes (1791); San José de Maipo (1792); Nueva Bilbao, now Constitución (1794); Villa de San Ambrosio de Linares, now Linares (1794), and Villa Reina Luisa del Parral, now Parral (1795). He focused on developing the resources of the country, with an enlightened policy that accomplished much for Spanish interest, but also paved the way for later events in the country's history. He improved communications and trade with other Spanish colonies, based on a growing agricultural base. He abolished the encomienda system whereby natives were forced to work the land for the crown, an act reinforced by royal decree in 1791. He was made lieutenant-general in 1794. Malaspina Expedition In February 1787, the frigate Astrea under the command of Alessandro Malaspina called at Talcahuano, the port of Concepcion, in the course of a commercial circumnavigation of the world on behalf of the Royal Philippines Company. O'Higgins was military governor there at the time, and six months before had recommended that Spain organize an expedition to the Pacific similar to those led by Jean-François de Galaup, comte de Lapérouse and James Cook.Archivo Histórico Nacional (Madrid), Estado, legajo 4289. Also at Archivo Nacional de Chile, Fondo Vicuña Mackenna, vol.304, D, ff. 5–26. Published in Revista chilena de historia y geografía, no.107, 1946, pp.387–401. O'Higgins had made this recommendation following the visit of the Lapérouse expedition to Concepcion in March 1786, and he presumably discussed it with Malaspina while the Astrea was at Concepcion. Following the Astrea's return to Spain, Malaspina produced, in partnership with José de Bustamante, a proposal for an expedition along the lines set out in O'Higgins' memorandum. A short time later, on 14 October 1788, Malaspina was informed of the government's acceptance of his plan. José de Espinoza y Tello, one of the officers of the Malaspina expedition, subsequently confirmed the importance of the information sent by O'Higgins in stimulating the Government to initiate an extensive program of exploration in the Pacific.\\"Noticia de las principales expediciones hechas por nuestras pilotos del Departamiento de San Blas al reconocimiento de la costa noroeste de America, desde el año de 1774 hasta el 1791, extractada de los diarios originales de aquellos navegantes\\", Novo y Colson, Viaje, p.428; cited in Warren L.

At: web.viu.ca The prompt acceptance of O'Higgins's and Malaspina's proposal was also stimulated by news from St. Petersburg of preparations for a Russian expedition (the Mulovsky expedition) to the North Pacific under the command of Grigori I.

Huilliche uprising of 1792 In 1784 the Governor of Chiloé, Francisco Hurtado del Pino, and Ambrosio O'Higgins had been ordered to open a route over Huilliche territory between Maullín and Valdivia. This caused alarm among the Huilliche of the plains of Osorno, who decided to ally with the Huilliche Aillarehues of the Bueno River valley and those around Lake Ranco to the north, and to request intervention by the Governor of Valdivia, Mariano Pusterla. The latter had good relations with the Huilliches of Río Bueno and Ranco because of his support for peaceful contact coupled with a religious mission, and refused to establish any new fort in the territory. On the other hand, the Governor of Chiloé, Francisco Hurtado, supported a hard line against the Huilliches and threatened them with military invasion. In February 1789 the Treaty of Río Bueno was signed between Huilliche chiefs and colonial authorities. This treaty averted invasion from Chiloé, and gave the Huilliches of Osorno support from the Valdivia authorities against raids by the Aillarehue of Quilacahuín. At that point the Huilliches offered to facilitate the new Camino Real and to allow Spaniards to reoccupy Osorno, a city that had been abandoned in 1602. In 1792 O'Higgins rebuilt Osorno, and as a reward was created 1st Marquess of Osorno by King Charles IV in 1796. The treaty also allowed Spaniards to settle and form haciendas north of the Bueno River. However, abuses in this settlement and a fast advance of new haciendas made several chiefs change their minds. The caciques Tangol from Río Bueno, Queipul and Catrihuala decided to form an alliance. The Huilliche Rebellion of 1792 ensued, beginning with the pillaging of haciendas and missions, and with the ultimate aim of attacking Valdivia, which despite being well defended from the north and west, seemed vulnerable to a land attack from the southeast. Despite the limited extent of this rebellion, which never became a real threat to Valdivia, the Spanish authorities responded to it with rigour. Governor O'Higgins chose Captain Tomás de Figueroa to lead the reprisal. Figueroa set fire to Indian houses and croplands near his marching route, and arrested a large number of male Huilliches as suspected rebels. After that, the Spaniards considered it appropriate to enter into a new treaty with the Huilliche leaders, and a conference with this object was held in Las Canoas, in Osorno, in 1793. While in the treaty of Río Bueno the Spanish had been allowed to form haciendas only north of the Bueno River, establishing that watercourse as a de facto frontier, the Spaniards now acquired the right to set up haciendas south of it. Parliaments of 1793 The same year, 1793, a new parliament was held in Negrete on the northern frontier with the aim of ratifying and renewing the older Treaty of Lonquilmo from 1783. Copying older treaties, the King of Spain was confirmed as the sovereign of the Araucanía, while the possession of the land was reserved for the Mapuches, which resulted in a de jure sovereignty of the King of Spain but in a de facto independence of the Mapuche-controlled lands. The treaty celebrations were held from 4 March to 7 March, with many banquets of wine and meat being held for the numerous participants. The whole treaty cost 10.897 pesos, which was, according to Diego Barros Arana, an enormous amount of money, considering the size of Chile's treasury. As Viceroy of Peru Memorial plaque, Lima In 1796, O'Higgins was appointed Viceroy of Peru, comprising present-day Peru and Chile. As Peru was the second richest colony after New Spain (Mexico) in the Spanish empire, the Viceroyship was one of the most prominent posts in all of Spanish America. When war was declared between Britain and Spain in 1797, O'Higgins took active measures for the defense of the coast, strengthening the fortifications of Callao and constructing a fort in Pisco. He projected and constructed a new carriage-road from Lima to Callao, and his principal attention during his short administration was directed to the improvement of means of communication. He died suddenly after a short illness in 1801, and was interred in the Iglesia de San Pablo, now the Jesuit-run Iglesia de San Pedro, Lima. Genealogy Archives in Spain and Ireland show that Ambrose O'Higgins was the son of Charles O'Higgins, of Ballynary, County Sligo (son of Roger O'Higgins, of Ballynary, County Sligo, and wife Margaret Brehan), and wife and cousin Margaret O'Higgins (daughter of William O'Higgins and wife Winnifred O'Fallon). Charles O'Higgins' grandfather, Sean Duff O'Higgins, held the Gaelic territorial title of Tiarna or Lord of Ballinary, and he was married to an O'Conor, daughter of the Royal House of O'Conor of Ballintober Castle, which ruled Ireland until the year 1000. The O'Higgins family were a sept of the O'Neill dynasty who migrated to Sligo in the 12th century.Annals of the Four Masters, Books IV and V. As Gaelic nobles they had owned great expanses of land particularly in the Irish counties of Sligo and Westmeath, but with the expropriations of Catholics by Oliver Cromwell, and the deportation of tenants to County Sligo after the Cromwellian conquest of Ireland ca. 1654, the O'Higgins' lands became smaller and smaller.O’Rorke, T. (1889) \\"The History of Sligo Town and County Vol. II – Conclusion\\" (Dublin: Duffy & Company). Due to this encroachment into their land, the O'Higgins family migrated to Summerhill in County Meath, where they became lowly tenant farmers and worked in the service of the Rowley-Langford family. Their descendants remain in Summerhill however; Bridget O'Higgins who died in 1947 was the last in Summerhill to carry the family name as others had emigrated to the US and migrated to Dublin. The O'Higgins graves are located in The Moy and Agher cemeteries, both within the boundaries of the Roman Catholic parish of Dangan in Summerhill. Descendants Isabel Riquelme Bernardo O'Higgins In 1777, Ambrosio O'Higgins became acquainted with the powerful Riquelme family from Chillán, and fell in love with the daughter, Isabel Riquelme, almost forty years his junior (she was 18 or 19 at the time, while he was 57 years old). He promised marriage, but colonial law forbade marriage between public officials and criolla women without authorization of the crown. To disregard this law was to risk career and position. It is not known why he did not seek permission, but no marriage ensued even when Isabel became pregnant. Isabel gave birth to Ambrosio's only son, Bernardo, in August 1778. Bernardo O'Higgins would later lead Chile to its independence from the Spanish Empire. Two years later, Isabel married Félix Rodríguez with whom she had a daughter, Rosa Rodríguez Riquelme. Though Ambrosio O'Higgins never saw or officially recognised his son as his legal heir, he paid for his education in England and left him a portion of his possessions in Peru and Chile. Bernardo O'Higgins led Chile as Supreme Director from 1818 to 1823 when he was forced to resign and go into exile with his mother, sister and son Demetrio O'Higgins in Peru. Demetrio, who visited his relatives in Summerhill in 1862, had no sons and consequently all his descendants are in the female line. Legacy There are various towns, bays, and other Spanish discoveries in the Americas which were named after his birthplace during his time as Viceroy, such as Vallenar (originally named San Ambrosio de Ballenary, later Hispanicized to Vallenar) in Chile and Vallenar Bay in Alaska.Place Names in Revillagigedo and Gravina Islands: Spanish and Irish heritage of Southeast Alaska See also * Juan Albano Pereira Márquez * Lebian NotesSources * Clissold, Stephen. \\"The O'Higgins of Chile\\" History Today (June 1957) 7#6 pp396-403; father and son. * Barbier, Jacques A. \\"Tradition and Reform in Bourbon Chile: Ambrosio O'Higgins and Public Finances.\\" The Americas 34.3 (1978): 381-399.   * External links * * Category:1720 births Category:1801 deaths Category:18th-century Irish people Category:19th-century Irish people Category:Viceroys of Peru Category:Royal Governors of Chile Category:Irish emigrants to Chile Category:Irish emigrants to Spain Category:Irish military engineers Category:Spanish people of Irish descent Category:Marquesses of Spain Category:Spanish generals Category:Captaincy General of Chile Category:People from County Sligo Category:Irish soldiers in the Spanish Army Category:18th-century military personnel ","title":"Ambrosio O'Higgins, 1st Marquess of Osorno"},{"id":"41074635","text":"The Puffin Foundation, established in 1983, is a non-profit organization that aims to amplify the voices of minorities who may underrepresented due to their race, gender, social philosophy, etc. The foundation achieves this mission of fostering free expression by providing grants and resources to local artists and art organizations. Ultimately, the goal of the Puffin Foundation is to provide people with an understanding that every single person can go out and make change happen.  History  The Puffin Foundation, with more than $14 million in assets split between two independent entities, was seeded with the fortune Perry Rosenstein made in the Allen screw business. He got into the fasteners industry as a salesman. As he made the rounds on his accounts, he found several buyers who wanted diversity in Allen screws. He saw an opening in the market and began making screws in Japan. As an outsider in the industry, he faced stiff competition in the business. That experience has partly informed his interests in providing grants to artists and thinkers who do not usually secure grant money from more traditional foundations. He says he wants to make the fight a fair one. The Puffin Foundation Ltd. received its Certificate of Incorporation of The Foundation as defined in sub-paragraph (a)(5) of Section 402 of the Not-For-Profit Corporation Law and shall be a Type B corporation under Section 201 On January 17, 1983 by the State of New York Department of State. It then received its 501(c)(3) as is a private not- for-profit. Dorothea Violet Rosenstein, nee Cohn 7/4/24--6/6/81, was President and Founder Perry Rosenstein's wife who prior to her death joined group of volunteers to work with the National Audubon's Dr. Stephen Kress to bring 10-14 day old pufflings from Great Island, Newfoundland to Eastern Egg Rock off the coast of Maine. When these young Puffins were ready to fledge, they were banded with the hope they would return in 2-3 years and start a new colony on this island which was once a flourishing colony until 1885 when hunters took the last survivors. The restoration idea was based on the fact that young puffins usually return to breed on the same island where they were hatched. This project was successful. The Puffin Foundation Ltd.'s name was chosen in 1983 in honor and in memoriam of his wife, Dorothea Violet Rosenstein. Unlike Captain Kirk's prime directive to never interfere, Puffin Foundation Ltd. was created with the idea that sometimes you have to interfere to make things right. Through his Teaneck, New Jersey-based foundation, Rosenstein states his mission as to fund \\"as many different areas of expression as possible.\\" Largely, he funds progressive or liberal work. The Bronx-native says that he attended his first protest as a boy atop his father's shoulders. \\"I happen to be one of many people that believes in our country and our democracy,\\" said Rosenstein. \\"I feel that if democracy is threatened, we are all threatened.\\"  Operations  The foundation has two grant cycles per year. The first cycle, which occurs between the months of January and June, typically allocates grant of $1000 to $2500 to individual artists and arts organizations. The second cycle funds media and awards grants to publications that do investigative reporting on issues like labor, the environment, LGBTQ concerns, feminism and women's issues. Over the years, the foundation has continued to broaden its scope. In 1997, the foundation began a project known as the Puffin Cultural Forum, which funds and hosts performances as well as art exhibits at 20 Puffin Way in Teaneck, NJ. For instance, the Puffin Foundation collaborates with The Nation Institute, on an annual human rights award, the Puffin/Nation Prize for Creative Citizenship, which is given to someone who has done distinctive and courageous social justice work. Thus far, the foundation has awarded this honor to Dolores Huerta of the United Farm Workers, Robert Moses of the Algebra Project, the founders of the Innocence Project, and Cecile Richards of Planned Parenthood.  The Puffin  The Puffin, a species whose nesting sites were endangered by encroaching civilization, were encouraged to return to their native habitats through the constructive efforts of a concerned citizenry. The Foundation has adopted the name Puffin as a metaphor for how it perceives its mission, which is to ensure that the arts continue to grow and enrich our lives. In so doing it has joined with other concerned groups and individuals toward achieving that goal.
