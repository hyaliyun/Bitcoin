Pickle was an Eagle Scout and recipient of the Distinguished Eagle Scout Award from the Boy Scouts of America. Pickle attended the public schools in Big Spring and received his Bachelor of Arts from the University of Texas at Austin where he was a member of the 1934 Southwest Conference championship swimming team and the student body president as a senior in 1937. He was also a member of the Friar Society. Pickle was introduced by future governor John Connally to Representative Lyndon Johnson, who served as his political mentor. He assisted the latter in his 1940 election campaign and assisted Lady Bird Johnson in running the Congressional office.

The area of the Nile valley known as Nubia, which lies within the north of present day Sudan, was home to three Kushite kingdoms during antiquity. The first had its capital at Kerma (2500‚Äì1500 BC). The second was centered on Napata (1000‚Äì300 BC). Finally, the last kingdom was centered on Mero√´ (300 BC‚ÄìAD 300). They are built of granite and sandstone. The pyramids were partially demolished by Italian treasure hunter Giuseppe Ferlini in the 1830s. Deeply influenced by the Egyptians, Nubian kings built their own pyramids a thousand years after Egyptian burial methods had changed. In Nubia, pyramids were built for the first time at El Kurru in 751 B.C. The Nubian style pyramids emulated a form of Egyptian private elite family pyramid that was common during the New kingdom. There are twice as many Nubian pyramids still standing today as there are Egyptian ones. The Nubian pyramids are recognized as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Pyramids So far, more than 35 pyramidsCluster of 35 Ancient Pyramids and Graves Discovered in Sudan grouped in five sites were discovered in Sudan. They were constructed in Nubia over a period of a few hundred years to serve as tombs for the kings and queens and wealthy citizens of Napata and Mero√´. The first three sites are located around Napata in Lower Nubia, near the modern town of Karima. The first of these was built at the site of el- Kurru, including the tombs of King Kashta and his son Piye, together with Piye's successors Shabaka, Shabataka, and Tanwetamani. Fourteen pyramids were constructed for their queens, several of whom were renowned warrior queens. This can be compared to approximately 120 much larger pyramids that were constructed in Ancient Egypt over a period of 3000 years. Later Napatan pyramids were sited at Nuri, 10 km north on the opposite bank of the Nile. This necropolis was the burial place of 21 kings and 52 queens and princes including Anlami and Aspelta. The bodies of these kings were placed in huge granite sarcophagi. Aspelta's weighed 15.5 tons, and its lid weighed four tons. The oldest and largest pyramid at Nuri is that of the Napatan king and Twenty-fifth Dynasty pharaoh Taharqa. Wide view of Nubian pyramids, Meroe. Three of these pyramids are reconstructed. Another small group of 9 pyramids is located next to Jebel Barkal itself. The most extensive Nubian pyramid site is at Mero√´, which is located between the fifth and sixth cataracts of the Nile, approximately north of Khartoum. During the Meroitic period, over forty queens and kings were buried there. Between 2009 and 2012 the new group of pyramids was discovered near the village Sedeinga. The physical proportions of Nubian pyramids differ markedly from the Egyptian edifices: they are built of stepped courses of horizontally positioned stone blocks and range approximately in height, but rise from fairly small foundation footprints, resulting in tall, narrow structures inclined at approximately 70¬∞. Most also have offering temple structures abutting their base with unique Kushite characteristics. By comparison, Egyptian pyramids of similar height generally had foundation footprints that were at least five times larger and were inclined at angles between 40-50¬∞. Pyramids of the pyramids of Meroe in 1821 The tombs inside the pyramids of Nubia were plundered in ancient times. Wall reliefs preserved in the tomb chapels reveal that their royal occupants were mummified, covered with jewellery and laid to rest in wooden mummy cases. At the time of their exploration by archaeologists in the 19th and 20th centuries, some pyramids were found to contain the remains of bows, quivers of arrows, archers' thumb rings, horse harnesses, wooden boxes, furniture, pottery, colored glass, metal vessels, and many other artefacts attesting to extensive Meroitic trade with Egypt and the Hellenistic world. A pyramid excavated at Mero√´ included hundreds of heavy items such as large blocks decorated with rock art and 390 stones that comprised the pyramid. A cow buried complete with eye ointment was also unearthed in the area to be flooded by the Mero√´ Dam, as were ringing rocks that were tapped to create a melodic sound. In the 1830s Giuseppe Ferlini came to Meroe seeking treasure and raided and demolished a number of pyramids which had been found ‚Äúin good conditions‚Äù by Fr√©d√©ric Cailliaud just a few years earlier., pp. 416-7 At Wad ban Naqa, he leveled the pyramid N6 of the kandake Amanishakheto starting from the top, and finally found her treasure composed of dozens of gold and silver jewelry pieces. Overall, he is considered responsible for the destruction of over 40 pyramids., pp. 86; 185 Ferlini raided the Meroe pyramids in 1834. Having found the treasure he was looking for, in 1836 Ferlini returned home.Epitaph from his gravestone in the Certosa di Bologna. A year later he wrote a report of his expedition containing a catalog of his findings, which was translated in French and republished in 1838., p. 166 He tried to sell the treasure, but at this time nobody believed that such high quality jewellery could be made in Black Africa. His finds were finally sold in Germany: part of these were purchased by king Ludwig I of Bavaria and are now in the State Museum of Egyptian Art of Munich, while the remaining ‚Äì under suggestions of Karl Richard Lepsius and of Christian Charles Josias von Bunsen ‚Äì was bought by the Egyptian Museum of Berlin where it still is. George Reisner, a Harvard archaeologist, investigated the pyramids at Nuri and mapped more than 80 royal Kushite burials in 1916-1919. Reisner started to explore burial chambers but he found they were flooded by the rising water table. He abandoned further excavation because he thought it was too dangerous, probably because a collapse of a staircase had killed five of his workers. Some of his findings were published in 1955. National Geographic funded explorations from 2015-2019 using underwater scuba diving equipment and remote controlled robots. Pyramids and cemeteries * The royal cemetery at el-Kurru.

During the war he worked as a runner in the hospital his parents worked for. After the German forces had been expelled from P≈Çock, Tadeusz Mazowiecki resumed his education and in 1946 he graduated from \\"Marshal Stanis≈Çaw Ma≈Çachowski\\" Lyceum, the oldest high school in Poland and one of the oldest continuously-operating school in Europe. He then moved to ≈Å√≥d≈∫ and then to Warsaw, where he joined the Law Faculty of the Warsaw University. However, he never graduated and instead devoted himself to activity in various Catholic associations, journals and publishing houses.Friszke, \\"Ko≈Ço pos≈Ç√≥w Znak...\\", p. 606 = Catholic activist = PAX and WTK  Already during his brief stay at the Warsaw University Mazowiecki joined the Caritas Academica charity organisation, he also briefly headed the University Printing Cooperative between 1947 and 1948. In 1946 he also joined Karol Popiel's Labour Party. However, later that year the party was outlawed by the new Stalinist authorities of Soviet-controlled Poland. Almost all other non-communist organisations soon also became a target of state-sponsored repressions. One of the exceptions was the PAX Association, the only large Catholic organisation supported by the Communist authorities - and supporting the authorities in their conflict with the Catholic clergy.Dudek, p. 181 Mazowiecki joined PAX in 1948, initially as one of the leaders of the youth circles. He openly criticised Boles≈Çaw Piasecki's vision of the association and his allegiance to the Communists. He nevertheless rose through the ranks of various journals published by the association. Initially, a journalist in the Dzi≈õ i Jutro weekly, in 1950 he became the deputy editor- in-chief of S≈Çowo Powszechne daily newspaper. In 1952 the conflict between Piasecki and the opposition within the PAX (the so-called Fronda, composed mostly of young intellectuals) led to Mazowiecki being expelled from the daily and relegated to a less prominent role of an editor of newly created ' (Wroc≈Çaw Catholic Weekly, WTK).Dudek, p. 218 Until 1955 he served as the editor-in-chief of that journal, he also remained one of the leaders of the opposition within the association, criticising Piasecki and his associates for their conflicts with the Catholic hierarchy, loyalty to the communist authorities, and lack of democratic procedures within PAX.Dudek, p. 219 For that he was eventually dismissed from the WTK and eventually in 1955 expelled from the association altogether.Dudek, pp. 219 & 222  Involvement in Communist propaganda  Despite criticizing Piasecki, Mazowiecki offered his own support to the Communist authorities, expressed in press articles and other publications. In 1952, he published a pamphlet titled The enemy remains the same (', co-authored with Zygmunt Przetakiewicz, then editor-in-chief of WTK) imputing an alliance between Polish anti-communist resistance movement and Nazi war criminals.Jak Mazowiecki zwalcza≈Ç podziemie, \\"Historia Do Rzeczy\\", issue No. 1/2013 In a press article published in WTK in 1953, Mazowiecki fiercely condemned Czes≈Çaw Kaczmarek, then Bishop of Kielce. Kaczmarek, groundlessly accused by the Communists of being an American and Vatican spy, was later sentenced to 12 years in prison.Katolicy przeciwko ko≈õcio≈Çowi Rzeczpospolita 3 12 2007  Club of Catholic Intelligence and 'Wiƒô≈∫'  Having left PAX, together with a group of his former colleagues Tadeusz Mazowiecki started cooperation with the Tygodnik Powszechny weekly, Po prostu journal and the Crooked Circle Club.Friszke, \\"Opozycja polityczna...\\", p. 186 While these journals were formally dependent on PAX, they were increasingly liberal and independent. Eventually, during the Polish October of 1956 Tadeusz Mazowiecki became one of the founders of the All-Polish Club of Progressive Catholic Intelligentsia, the predecessor of Club of Catholic Intelligentsia (KIK), the first all-national Catholic organisation independent of the Communist authorities in post-war Poland.Friszke, \\"Oaza na Kopernika...\\", p. 39 Until 1963 he served as a board member of KIK.Friszke, \\"Oaza na Kopernika...\\", pp. 297-298 He was also a founding member of the Wiƒô≈∫ Catholic monthly in 1958 and served as its first editor-in-chief.Friszke, \\"Oaza na Kopernika...\\", p. 51Szporer, p. 259 While relatively independent from the Communist authorities, the monthly was also independent from the Catholic hierarchy, which often led to conflicts with both.Friszke, \\"Oaza na Kopernika...\\", p. 89Friszke, \\"Ko≈Ço pos≈Ç√≥w Znak...\\", p. 100 In his texts published in Wiƒô≈∫ Mazowiecki, inspired by Emmanuel Mounier's personalist ideas, sought intellectual dialogue with members of left-leaning lay intelligentsia.Friszke, \\"Oaza na Kopernika...\\", p. 70Friszke, \\"Oaza na Kopernika...\\", p. 86 Mazowiecki was a friend and confidant of Pope John Paul II. = Politician and dissident = One of the lasting effects of W≈Çadys≈Çaw Gomu≈Çka's rise to power during the Polish October 1956 was the dissolution of PAX. A group of former PAX dissenters, the \\"Fronda\\", along with some of the professors of the Catholic University of Lublin approached Gomu≈Çka in 1956. In exchange for their support, Gomu≈Çka accepted the creation of Znak Association along with its publishing house, the only such venture independent from the communist government in contemporary Poland. Moreover, a small group of 12 Catholics associated with the Znak were allowed to run in the Polish legislative election of 1957, among them Tadeusz Mazowiecki. While the 12 members of parliament elected that year were formally independent, they formed the first form of opposition to the rule of the Polish United Workers' Party within the Polish Sejm, dubbed the \\"MP circle of Znak\\" (). Mazowiecki remained a member of the Sejm until 1971, serving his second, third and fourth terms as a member of the Catholic \\"party\\".Ost, p. 219 During his parliamentary career, he was an active member of the Commission on Education and the Commission on Work and Social Matters.Friszke, \\"Ko≈Ço pos≈Ç√≥w...\\", p. 44 As Poland was effectively a one-party state, the role of the token opposition was mostly symbolic. However, some of Mazowiecki's speeches and interpellations made a large impact on the Polish society. Such was the case of his critique of the official curriculum of Polish schools underlining the crucial role of Karl Marx's historical materialism,Friszke, \\"Ko≈Ço pos≈Ç√≥w...\\", pp. 46-47 or his isolated protest against the new Assemblies Act, effectively putting an end even to a theoretical freedom of assembly in Poland.Friszke, \\"Ko≈Ço pos≈Ç√≥w...\\", p. 50 In 1968 he was the only member of parliament to raise the issue of the brutal suppression of the students' demonstrations during the 1968 Polish political crisis.Friszke, \\"Ko≈Ço pos≈Ç√≥w...\\", p. 83 In the aftermath of the bloody quelling of the 1970 protests, in which 42 people were killed by the army and the Citizens' Militia, Tadeusz Mazowiecki unsuccessfully demanded that the matter be investigated in order to find those responsible for the bloodshed.Friszke, \\"Oaza na Kopernika...\\", p. 116 This and similar acts of questioning the actions of the Communist authorities made Mazowiecki one of the unwanted members of parliament and consequently in 1972 the party did not allow him to run for his fifth term.Friszke, \\"Oaza na Kopernika...\\", pp. 128-129 Having left the Sejm, Mazowiecki became the head of Warsaw chapter of the Club of Catholic Intelligentsia and one of the best-known Polish dissidents. In early 1976, soon after the publication of the Letter of 59, Mazowiecki initiated a similar letter to the PUWP signed by most members of the former Znak circle.Friszke, \\"Oaza na Kopernika...\\", pp. 157-159 Although not a member of the Workers' Defence Committee, he supported it on numerous occasions, notably in the aftermath of the June 1976 protests in Radom and Ursus.Friszke, \\"Oaza na Kopernika...\\", p. 179Friszke, \\"Opozycja polityczna...\\", p. 398 An heir to a long tradition of organic work, on 22 January 1978 Tadeusz Mazowiecki, together with other Polish dissidents, including Stefan Amsterdamski, Andrzej Celi≈Ñski and Andrzej Kijowski, became one of the founding members of the Society of Scientific Courses, the predecessor of the Flying University.Friszke, \\"Opozycja polityczna...\\", pp. 501-502 = Solidarity and the fall of Communism = In August 1980, he headed the Board of Experts, that supported the workers from Gda≈Ñsk who were negotiating with the authorities. From 1981, he was the editor-in-chief of the Tygodnik Solidarno≈õƒá weekly magazine.Tagliabue, \\"Solidarity seems on verge...\\", p. 1 After martial law was declared in December 1981 he was arrested and imprisoned in Strzebielnik, then in Jaworz and finally in Dar≈Ç√≥wek. He was one of the last prisoners to be released on 23 December 1982. In 1987, he spent a year abroad, during which he talked to politicians and trade union representatives. Starting in 1988, he held talks in Magdalenka. He firmly believed in the process of taking power from the ruling Polish United Workers' Party through negotiation and thus he played an active role in the Polish Round Table Talks, becoming one of the most important architects of the agreement by which partially free elections were held on 4 June 1989. While the Communists and their satellites were guaranteed a majority in the legislature, Solidarity won all of the contested seats in a historic landslide. The Communists had originally planned for Solidarity to be a junior partner in the ensuing government. However, Solidarity turned the tables on the Communists by persuading the Communists' two satellite parties to switch their support to Solidarity. This would all but force Communist President Wojciech Jaruzelski to appoint a Solidarity member as prime minister, heading the first government in 45 years that was not dominated by Communists. At a meeting on 17 August 1989, Jaruzelski finally agreed to Lech Wa≈Çƒôsa's demand to pick a Solidarity member as the next prime minister. Walesa chose Mazowiecki as Solidarity candidate to lead the coming administration. On 21 August 1989 General Jaruzelski formally appointed Mazowiecki as Prime Minister-designate. On 24 August 1989, he won a vote of confidence in the Sejm. He thus became the first Polish prime minister in 43 years who was not either a Communist or a fellow traveler, as well as the first non-communist Prime Minister of an Eastern European country in over 40 years.Baczy≈Ñska & S≈Çowikowska, p. 1 =Prime Minister= On 13 September 1989 during his parliamentary speech introducing his new cabinet and government program for parliamentary approval, Mazowiecki had a dizzy spell which necessitated a one- hour break in proceedings. However, the government was approved by a vote 402‚Äì0, with 13 abstentions. Mazowiecki's government managed to carry out many fundamental reforms in a short period. The political system was thoroughly changed; a full range of civil freedoms as well as a multi-party system were introduced and the country's emblem and name were changed (from the People's Republic of Poland to the Republic of Poland). On 29 December 1989, the fundamental changes in the Polish Constitution were made. By virtue of these changes, the preamble was deleted, the chapters concerning political and economic forms of government were changed, the chapters concerning trade unions were rewritten and a uniform notion of possession was introduced.Tagliabue, \\"Poles Approve Solidarity-Led Cabinet\\", p. 1 Mazowiecki used enormous popularity and credibility of the Solidarity movement to transform the Polish economy by a set of deep political and economic reforms.Sachs, pp. 44-46 Better known under the name of Balcerowicz Plan after Mazowiecki's minister of finance, Leszek Balcerowicz, the reforms enabled the transformation of Polish economy from centrally-planned shortage economy to modern, free market. The reforms have prepared the ground for measures stopping the hyperinflation, introducing free-market mechanisms and privatisation of state-owned companies, houses and land. The plan resulted in a reduced inflation and budget deficit, while simultaneously increasing Unemployment and worsening the financial situation of the poorest members of society. In 1989, in his first parliamentary speech in Sejm, Mazowiecki talked about a \\"thick line\\" ('): \\"We draw a thick line on what has happened in the past. We will answer for only what we have done to help Poland to rescue her from this crisis from now on\\". Originally, as Mazowiecki explains, it meant non-liability of his government for damages done to the national economy by previous governments.Leszkowicz, p. 1 =Later years= In 1991 Mazowiecki was appointed the United Nations' Special Rapporteur on the Situation of Human Rights in the Territory of the Former Yugoslavia. In 1993 he issued a report on human rights violations in the Former Yugoslavia but two years later Mazowiecki stepped down in protest at what he regarded as the international community's insufficient response to atrocities committed during the Bosnian war, particularly the Srebrenica massacre committed by the Serb army that year.W≈ª, p. 22 T. Mazowiecki with President Bronis≈Çaw Komorowski, former President Aleksander Kwa≈õniewski and Minister of Education Katarzyna Hall A conflict with Lech Wa≈Çƒôsa resulted in the disintegration of Citizens' Parliamentary Club that represented Solidarity camp. The Citizens' Parliamentary Club was divided into Centre Agreement, which supported Wa≈Çƒôsa, and ROAD, which took sides with Mazowiecki. That conflict lead both politicians to compete in presidential election at the end of 1990. Mazowiecki, who during Solidarity times was an advisor to Lech Wa≈Çƒôsa and strike committee in Gda≈Ñsk's shipyard, stood against Wa≈Çƒôsa in election and lost to him. He did not even join the second round (he gained the support of 18.08% of people ‚Äì 2,973,364 votes) and was defeated by Stanis≈Çaw Tymi≈Ñski, a maverick candidate from Canada. In 1991, Mazowiecki became a chairman of Democratic Union (later Freedom Union), and from 1995 he was its honorary president. Together with Jan Maria Rokita, Aleksander Hall and Hanna Suchocka he represented the Christian Democratic wing of the party. Between 1989 and 2001 Mazowiecki was a representative to the Polish Parliament (first from Pozna≈Ñ, later from Krak√≥w). Mazowiecki was a member of parliament in the first, second and third term (a member of Democratic Union), later the Freedom Union. During the National Assembly (1997) he introduced compromise preamble of Polish constitution (previously written by founders of Tygodnik Powszechny weekly), which was accepted by the National Assembly. In November 2002, he left the Freedom Union, .

After several years working as an impromptu assistant to men about to be hanged by Jack Ketch from the Treble Tree in Tyburn, Jack leaves England to become a vagabond in continental Europe. Much of The Baroque Cycle concerns Jack's adventures in (among other ports-of-call) England, France, Germany, Austria, The Barbary Coast, Egypt, India, Japan, the Philippines, and Mexico between the years 1683 and 1714.\\"Pirates! Calculus! Banking! Alchemy!\\", Powell's (April 23, 2004) In its 2004 review of The Confusion, The Guardian called the character of Jack Shaftoe \\"magnificent ... a swashbuckling hero with a foul mouth and few morals.\\"\\"Yo-yos in a Tangle,\\" The Guardian (April 3, 2004) The Village Voice has translated one of the more commonly used fictional sobriquets used to describe Shaftoe, l'emmerdeur, as \\"he who fucks shit up.\\"\\"Fig Newton,\\" The Village Voice (September 14, 2004) Characterization Shaftoe is illiterate, having received no formal education, and slightly mad, having contracted syphilis at a time when it was still untreatable. Nevertheless, he is depicted by Stephenson as a daring, charismatic, clever, and resourceful man. While he's possessed by an almost pathological impulsiveness, denominated by his brother Bob \\"The Imp of the Perverse,\\" Jack also exhibits a surprising capacity for loyalty, mercy, and even, at times, mawkish sentimentality. During the fifty-four years of European history traced by The Baroque Cycle, Jack loves only one woman, Eliza de la Zeur, the rescued harem-slave turned English Duchess/French Countess (though Jack fathers two children in the early 1680s, Danny and Jimmy, by Irishwoman Mary Dolores, who dies shortly thereafter). Jack spends much of the period between 1683 and 1714 either fighting for his life or attempting to earn, from a great distance, the love and respect of Eliza; often these endeavors are concurrent. His late 17th-century/early 18th-century exploits as a street urchin, mercenary soldier, vagabond, errand-boy, merchant, galley- slave, pirate, petty despot, spy, coiner, and terrorist in the employ of King Louis XIV are the subject, in the world of Stephenson's epic, not only of much of the text proper but also of widely popular picaresque novels read by various characters in the story. Shaftoe is a distant ancestor of a number of characters appearing in Stephenson's earlier novel, Cryptonomicon, including Bobby Shaftoe, Douglas MacArthur Shaftoe, and America \\"Amy\\" Shaftoe.

This enzyme is produced by certain species of fungi and insects and displays antibacterial activity when oxygen and glucose are present. Reaction catalyzed by glucose oxidase Glucose oxidase is widely used for the determination of free glucose in body fluids (diagnostics), in vegetal raw material, and in the food industry. It also has many applications in biotechnologies, typically enzyme assays for biochemistry including biosensors in nanotechnologies. It was first isolated by Detlev M√ºller in 1928 from Aspergillus niger.  Function  Glucose oxidase is synthesized in several species of fungi and insects where it is used to produce hydrogen peroxide which in turn kills bacteria. Notatin, extracted from antibacterial cultures of Penicillium notatum, was originally named Penicillin A, but was renamed to avoid confusion with penicillin. Notatin was shown to be identical to Penicillin B and glucose oxidase, enzymes extracted from other molds besides P. notatum; it is now generally known as glucose oxidase. Early experiments showed that notatin exhibits in vitro antibacterial activity (in the presence of glucose) due to hydrogen peroxide formation. In vivo tests showed that notatin was not effective in protecting rodents from Streptococcus haemolyticus, Staphylococcus aureus, or salmonella, and caused severe tissue damage at some doses. Glucose oxidase is also produced by the hypopharyngeal glands of honeybee workers and deposited into honey where it acts as a natural preservative. GOx at the surface of the honey reduces atmospheric O2 to hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), which acts as an antimicrobial barrier.  Structure  Glucose oxidase enzyme powder from Aspergillus niger. GOx is a dimeric protein, the 3D structure of which has been elucidated. The active site where glucose binds is in a deep pocket. The enzyme, like many proteins that act outside of cells, is covered with carbohydrate chains.  Mechanism  At pH 7, glucose exists in solution in cyclic hemiacetal form as 63.6% Œ≤-D-glucopyranose and 36.4% Œ±-D-glucopyranose, the proportion of linear and furanose form being negligible. The glucose oxidase binds specifically to Œ≤-D-glucopyranose and does not act on Œ±-D-glucose. It is able to oxidise all of the glucose in solution because the equilibrium between the Œ± and Œ≤ anomers is driven towards the Œ≤ side as it is consumed in the reaction. Glucose oxidase catalyzes the oxidation of Œ≤-D-glucose into D-glucono-1,5-lactone, which then hydrolyzes to gluconic acid. In order to work as a catalyst, GOx requires a cofactor, flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD). FAD is a common component in biological oxidation-reduction (redox reactions). Redox reactions involve a gain or loss of electrons from a molecule. In the GOx-catalyzed redox reaction, FAD works as the initial electron acceptor and is reduced to FADH2. Then FADH2 is oxidized by the final electron acceptor, molecular oxygen (O2), which can do so because it has a higher reduction potential. O2 is then reduced to hydrogen peroxide (H2O2).  Applications = Glucose monitoring = Glucose oxidase is widely used coupled to peroxidase reaction that visualizes colorimetrically the formed H2O2, for the determination of free glucose in sera or blood plasma for diagnostics, using spectrometric assays manually or with automated procedures, and even point of use rapid assays. Similar assays allows the monitoring of glucose levels in fermentation, bioreactors, and to control glucose in vegetal raw material and food products. In the glucose oxidase assay, the glucose is first oxidized, catalyzed by glucose oxidase, to produce gluconate and hydrogen peroxide. The hydrogen peroxide is then oxidatively coupled with a chromogen to produce a colored compound which may be measured spectroscopically. For example, hydrogen peroxide together with 4 amino-antipyrene (4-AAP) and phenol in the presence of peroxidase yield a red quinoeimine dye that can be measured at 505 nm. The absorbance at 505 nm is proportional to concentration of glucose in the sample. Enzymatic glucose biosensors use an electrode instead of O2 to take up the electrons needed to oxidize glucose and produce an electronic current in proportion to glucose concentration. This is the technology behind the disposable glucose sensor strips used by diabetics to monitor serum glucose levels. = Food preservation = In manufacturing, GOx is used as an additive thanks to its oxidizing effects: it prompts for stronger dough in bakery, replacing oxidants such as bromate. It is also used as a food preservative to help remove oxygen and glucose from food when packaged such as dry egg powder to prevent unwanted browning and undesired taste. = Wound treatment = Wound care products, such as \\"Flaminal Hydro\\" make use of an alginate hydrogel containing glucose oxidase and other components as an oxidation agent.  Clinical trials  A nasal spray from a bag-on-valve device that mixes glucose oxidase with glucose has undergone clinical trials in 2016 for the prevention and treatment of the common cold.

The Eastern Transport Corridor in Auckland, New Zealand, is a transport reserve along a strip of land and water some of which is occupied by housing, commerce, industry and local roads. It runs adjacent to the North Island Main Trunk railway freight and passenger railway line, but is earmarked for major transport intensification to improve links from central Auckland to eastern suburbs such as Pakuranga and Howick. Historically, it was to provide the route for an additional motorway connecting through the isthmus from the east into the Auckland CBD, with an estimated cost of up to $4 billion, but political and local community resistance made the project fail in the 2000s. The NZ Transport Agency designations remain in place as of 2010.  Proposed motorway = Original designs = A strategy study in 2002 stated a need for a new motorway to be built in the corridor (as had been planned decades before) for a variety of reasons including the need to make suburban streets safer and less polluted. In March 2004, Auckland City Mayor John Banks proposed a motorway scheme through Hobson Bay. There was substantial community and political resistance to the scheme, largely due to the cost of the proposal (equivalent to four years of the entire country's transport funding budget) and the impact it would have on a number of established neighbourhoods, as well as areas like Tamaki Drive, the Parnell Baths and several environmentally sensitive areas. However, there were also groups that defended it, citing the projected economic gains, and the benefit it would have on the traffic volumes on Tamaki Drive. Banks proposed to underground large sections of the scheme (earning it the nickname 'tunnelway' amongst some commentators) and proposed to pay for the construction costs at least partly by selling Auckland City's 25% shareholding in Auckland International Airport, and by charging a $5 toll. In 2002, Banks proposed that the Eastern Transport Corridor might link into a harbour tunnel starting north of Parnell, and linking to Ngataringa Bay near Devonport, for an estimated cost of $1 billion. = Revised designs = Many spoke out against the project, including former Auckland City Mayor Christine Fletcher, who argued that the proposed motorway barely featured in the statutory policy documents, that city councillors lacked the necessary information to make informed decisions, and that the intended growth areas of the city would not require the corridor, with a public transport route being preferable. A revised plan published on 25 August 2004 reduced the number of lanes substantially (2-3 lanes + bus lane in each direction depending on the section), reducing the financial and ecological impact. Banks said he hoped the scheme would be acceptable to the opponents of the scheme, even though around 1,200 houses would still have to be demolished or otherwise affected. The Purewa Creek section was to be aligned on an elevated expressway to avoid damage to the environmentally sensitive area, while the motorway would be sunk into trenches in Glen Innes to reduce disruption. Depending on the connection to the CBD, the scheme would have either entered the city on a widened western Tamaki Drive section after crossing Hobson Bay, or gone through a tunnel under Parnell ‚Äì which politicians promised would reduce much of the effects on Parnell residents. However the impacts were still high, and the costs rising (with a worst case estimate of NZ$3.9 billion), and at that point the corridor was fast becoming a political boondoggle. The proposed motorway was one of the principal points of contention in the 2004 local body elections and contributed to the defeat of Banks. It also led to the election of two candidates from the Action Hobson protest group who became councillors primarily on the promise to stop the new motorway. The Auckland City Council transport and urban linkages committee decided on 10 December 2004 to scrap the planned motorway component in favour of improved public transport and increased capacity on existing local roads. However the transport reserve remains in place, allowing for the motorway to be undertaken at some point in the future if it becomes economically and politically feasible. = Public Transport Route = Parts of the Eastern Transport Corridor are currently under development as an Eastern Cycleway. Alternative proposals Based on this strong opposition to a major link through this area of eastern Auckland, the AMETI (Auckland-Manukau Eastern Transport Initiative) project was intended to improve the connections of this area towards the south-east (Manukau City), via less problematic routes. The new roads and public transport links were to serve intensified residential and mixed developments like the Mount Wellington Quarry area.Auckland-Manukau Eastern transport initiative (AMETI) (from the Auckland City Council website) In 2010, it was revealed that the updated AMETI plans now included much stronger bus priority proposals than before. A significant part of AMETI emerged as the Eastern Busway project. Preliminary works for the busway began in 2018.  Legal status  The designations for the Eastern Transport Corridor still exist as of 2020, and is currently held by Auckland Transport.https://unitaryplan.aucklandcouncil.govt.nz/Images/Auckland%20Unitary%20Plan%20Operative/Chapter%20K%20Designations/Auckland%20Transport.pdf Various proposals over the years (such as in 2006, initiated by Action Hobson) did not end in removal, partly because it was argued that the designations were needed for future proofing for the city's growth, and also because other transport links, such as another rail track, or busways, could be needed.

It is linked to the main islands of Venice by two bridges. History The island was the site of a castle from at least the 6th century, and it is from this that the island and the sestiere are named. In the seventh century, it became the seat of the Bishop of Olivolo, later renamed Bishop of Castello. When Castello was merged into the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Venice it remained the seat of that archdiocese until 1807.

MFS was introduced with the original Apple Macintosh computer in January 1984. MFS is notable both for introducing resource forks to allow storage of structured data, and for storing metadata needed to support the graphical user interface of Mac OS. MFS allows file names to be up to 255 characters in length, although Finder does not allow users to create names longer than 63 characters (31 characters in later versions). MFS is called a flat file system because it does not support a hierarchy of directories. Folders exist as a concept on the original MFS-based Macintosh, but work completely differently from the way they do on modern systems. They are visible in Finder windows, but not in the open and save dialog boxes. There is always one empty folder on the volume, and if it is altered in any way (such as by adding or renaming files), a new Empty Folder appears, thus providing a way to create new folders. MFS stores all of the file and directory listing information in a single file. The Finder creates the illusion of folders, by storing all files as pairs of directory handles and file handles. To display the contents of a particular folder, MFS scans the directory for all files in that handle. There is no need to find a separate file containing the directory listing. The Macintosh File System does not support volumes over 20 MB in size, or about 1,400 files. While this is small by today's standards, at the time it seemed very expansive when compared to the Macintosh's 400 KB floppy drive. Apple introduced Hierarchical File System as a replacement for MFS in September 1985. In Mac OS 7.6.1, Apple removed support for writing to MFS volumes, and in Mac OS 8.0 support for MFS volumes was removed altogether. Although macOS has no built-in support for MFS, an example VFS plug-in from Apple called MFSLives provides read-only access to MFS volumes.

He is well known for his songwriting and distinctive voice. Biography Born in Hawaii, Jennings moved with his family to Pittsburgh at an early age. Jennings learned to play guitar at the age of 13, when he began writing songs. Jennings later dropped out of school and moved to Minneapolis to pursue his musical career.Profile, Mason Jennings website], masonjennings.com. Retrieved March 14, 2016. Jennings produced his self-titled debut album in 1997 on an analog four-track in the living room of a rented home, playing all instruments himself. In October 1998, joined by drummer Chris Stock and bassist Robert Skoro, he began a weekly gig at the 400 Bar as the Mason Jennings Band. The two-week gig ended up lasting four months. In April 1999, six months after forming, The Mason Jennings Band was voted by the 1999 \\"Picked to Click Poll\\" conducted by the Minneapolis-St. Paul newspaper, City Pages. Mason began touring nationally and expanded the depth of his sound by inviting saxophonist Chris Thomson to play with them occasionally and replacing Stock with Brazilian jazz drummer Edgar Olivera. Birds Flying Away (2000) revealed his penchant for singing first-person narratives of imaginary rustic characters. Following the release of this album, Noah Levy took over drumming duties from Olivera. In 2002, Jennings released a studio album, Century Spring, and a \\"fans only\\" collection of acoustic songs, Simple Life. Jennings released all three discs ‚Äì and re-released his earlier albums ‚Äì on his homebrew record label, Architect Records. In 2003, Skoro and Levy left the band and were replaced by bassist Chris Morrissey (Bill Mike Band) and drummer Brian McLeod. On February 10, 2004, Jennings released Use Your Voice, which notably included the songs \\"Keepin' It Real,\\" ostensibly written at the request of Shrek 2 producers (but not used in the film), and \\"The Ballad of Paul and Sheila,\\" an acoustic dirge for late Minnesota senator Paul Wellstone. On September 30 of that year, the band released a DVD entitled Use Your Van, which chronicled the recording of Use Your Voice and part of the promotional tour. The DVD was filmed by Andy Grund. On June 17, 2005, Jennings signed with Glacial Pace, a subsidiary of Sony's Epic Records headed by Modest Mouse frontman Isaac Brock. Minnesota's Star Tribune credited Brock with convincing Jennings to sign after Mason Jennings had opened for several Modest Mouse shows in 2004. Jennings had long avoided the major labels, citing desires to maintain creative control and dodge big-label politics. Glacial Pace is now an independent label. Jennings recorded his sixth album, Boneclouds, at Pachyderm Studio in Cannon Falls, MN with producer Noah Georgeson. The album was released on May 16, 2006 by Glacial Pace. Soon thereafter, bassist Chris Morrisey left the band. Accompanying Jennings was new bassist Arabella Kauffmann and Brian McLeod on drums. Jennings sang two Bob Dylan songs which Christian Bale lip-synched in the movie \\"I'm Not There\\" (released in November 2007 in the U.S.): \\"The Times They Are a-Changin'\\" and \\"The Lonesome Death of Hattie Carroll.\\" In early 2008 Jennings signed with Jack Johnson's record label, Brushfire Records. Jennings released In the Ever in May 2008. The title was inspired by his son referring to where he was before he was born as, \\"In the ever\\". Jennings and Johnson met at Gustavus Adolphus College's Earth Jam in 2001 when Jennings was scheduled as Johnson's opening act. Jennings announced at the Elemental Experience Music & Arts Festival in San Diego, California on May 2, 2009, that he would be releasing a new album (later entitled Blood of Man) in summer 2009. He also mentioned that he would have music on the soundtrack for the documentary 180¬∞ South. The documentary was released in March 2010. On September 15, 2009, Blood of Man was released on CD and vinyl format. A free bonus EP titled Independent (containing the tracks \\"Mark My Heart With Ashes\\" and \\"Wide Open Country\\") was distributed with the album at independent record stores. A week before the official CD release, a version of the album containing the exclusive track \\"Waves\\" was made available exclusively on iTunes. The album received a 4 star review in Rolling Stone. In late 2010, Live at First Ave., his first live album ever, was released. In 2010, Jennings released The Flood. This album was made up of songs he had recorded in the 1990s on a cassette tape. Jennings rediscovered these songs and re-recorded them in a stripped down fashion to stay true to their intent. In 2011, he released Minnesota, his first new album of original songs since 2009's Blood of Man. On November 12, 2013, he released Always Been. The first single from the album was \\"Lonely Street\\", followed by \\"Wilderness\\". He released Wild Dark Metal in 2016. He got divorced from Amy Turany. After taking some time off to focus on painting and recovering from depression and agoraphobia he began touring again. He married Josie Jennings in 2018 and released an album of love songs inspired by their relationship on May 11, 2018 called Songs From When We Met. First Avenue Jennings has been honored with a star on the outside mural of the Minneapolis nightclub First Avenue, recognizing performers that have played sold-out shows or have otherwise demonstrated a major contribution to the culture at the iconic venue. Receiving a star \\"might be the most prestigious public honor an artist can receive in Minneapolis,\\" according to journalist Steve Marsh.

It replaced the Hierarchical File System (HFS) as the primary file system of Apple computers with the 1998 release of Mac OS 8.1. HFS+ continued as the primary Mac OS X file system until it was itself replaced with the Apple File System (APFS), released with macOS High Sierra in 2017. HFS+ is also one of the formats used by the iPod digital music player. Compared to its predecessor HFS, also called Mac OS Standard or HFS Standard, HFS Plus supports much larger files (block addresses are 32-bit length instead of 16-bit) and using Unicode (instead of Mac OS Roman or any of several other character sets) for naming items. Like HFS, HFS Plus uses B-trees to store most volume metadata, but unlike most other file systems, HFS Plus supports hard links to directories. HFS Plus permits filenames up to 255 characters in length, and n-forked files similar to NTFS, though until 2005 almost no system software took advantage of forks other than the data fork and resource fork. HFS Plus also uses a full 32-bit allocation mapping table rather than HFS's 16 bits, improving the use of space on large disks.  History  Codenamed Sequoia in development, HFS+ was introduced with the January 19, 1998, release of Mac OS 8.1. With the release of the Mac OS X 10.2.2 update on November 11, 2002, Apple added optional journaling features to HFS Plus for improved data reliability. These features were accessible through the GUI, using the Disk Utility application, in Mac OS X Server, but only accessible through the command line in the standard desktop client. With Mac OS X v10.3, all HFS Plus volumes on all Macs were set to be journaled by default. Within the system, an HFS Plus volume with a journal is identified as HFSJ. Mac OS X 10.3 also introduced another version of HFS Plus called HFSX. HFSX volumes are almost identical to HFS Plus volumes, except that they are never surrounded by the HFS Wrapper that is typical of HFS Plus volumes and they optionally support case sensitivity for file and folder names. HFSX volumes can be recognized by two entries in the Volume Header, a value of HX in the signature field and 5 in the version field. Mac OS X 10.3 also marked Apple's adoption of Unicode 3.2 decomposition, superseding the Unicode 2.1 decomposition used previously. This change caused problems for developers writing software for Mac OS X. Mac OS X 10.3 introduced a number of techniques that are intended to avoid fragmentating files in HFS+. With Mac OS X 10.4, Apple added support for Inline Attribute Data records, something that had been a part of the Mac OS X implementation of HFS Plus since at least 10.0, but always marked as \\"reserved for future use\\". Until the release of Mac OS X Server 10.4, HFS Plus supported only the standard UNIX file system permissions; however, 10.4 introduced support for access control list‚Äìbased file security, which provides a richer mechanism to define file permissions and is also designed to be fully compatible with the file permission models on other platforms such as Microsoft Windows XP and Windows Server 2003. In Mac OS X Leopard 10.5, directory hard-linking was added as a fundamental part of Time Machine. In Mac OS X Snow Leopard 10.6, HFS+ compression was added using Deflate (Zlib). In open source and some other areas this is referred to as AppleFSCompression or decmpfs. Compressed data may be stored in either an extended attribute or the resource fork. When using non-Apple APIs, AppleFSCompression is not always completely transparent. OS X 10.9 introduced two new algorithms, LZVN (libFastCompression), and LZFSE. In Mac OS X Lion 10.7, logical volume encryption (known as FileVault 2) was added to the operating system. This addition to the operating system in no way changed the logical structure of the file system. Apple's logical volume manager is known as Core Storage and its encryption at the volume level can apply to file systems other than HFS Plus. With appropriate hardware, both encryption and decryption should be transparent.  Design  HFS Plus volumes are divided into sectors (called logical blocks in HFS), that are usually 512 bytes in size. These sectors are then grouped together into allocation blocks which can contain one or more sectors; the number of allocation blocks depends on the total size of the volume. HFS Plus uses a larger value to address allocation blocks than HFS, 32 bits rather than 16 bits; this means it can access 4,294,967,296 (= 232) allocation blocks rather than the 65,536 (= 216) allocation blocks available to HFS. When disks were small, this was of little consequence, but as larger-capacity drives became available, it meant that the smallest amount of space that any file could occupy (a single allocation block) became excessively large, wasting significant amounts of space. For example, on a 1 GB disk, the allocation block size under HFS is 16 KB, so even a 1 byte file would take up 16 KB of disk space. HFS Plus's system greatly improves space utilization on larger disks as a result. File and folder names in HFS Plus are also character encoded in UTF-16 and normalized to a form very nearly the same as Unicode Normalization Form D (NFD) (which means that precomposed characters like \\"√•\\" are decomposed in the HFS+ filename and therefore count as two code unitsThere are some minor differences derived from the fact that the HFS Plus format was finalized before Unicode had standardized the NFD format (see \\"Unicode Subtleties\\" for more information) and UTF-16 implies that characters from outside the Basic Multilingual Plane also count as two code units in an HFS+ filename). HFS Plus permits filenames up to 255 UTF-16 code units in length. Formerly, HFS Plus volumes were embedded inside an HFS standard file system. This was phased out by the Tiger transition to Intel Macs, where the HFS Plus file system was not embedded inside a wrapper. The wrapper had been designed for two purposes; it allowed Macintosh computers without HFS Plus support in their ROM to boot HFS Plus volumes and it also was designed to help users transition to HFS Plus by including a minimal HFS volume with a read-only file called Where_have_all_my_files_gone?, explaining to users with versions of Mac OS 8.0 and earlier without HFS Plus, that the volume requires a system with HFS Plus support. The original HFS volume contains a signature and an offset to the embedded HFS Plus volume within its volume header. All allocation blocks in the HFS volume which contain the embedded volume are mapped out of the HFS allocation file as bad blocks. Notable among file systems used for Unix systems, HFS Plus does not support sparse files. There are nine structures that make up a typical HFS Plus volume: # Sectors 0 and 1 of the volume are HFS boot blocks. These are identical to the boot blocks in an HFS volume. They are part of the HFS wrapper. # Sector 2 contains the Volume Header, which is equivalent to the Master Directory Block in an HFS volume. The Volume Header stores a wide variety of data about the volume itself, for example the size of allocation blocks, a timestamp that indicates when the volume was created or the location of other volume structures such as the Catalog File or Extent Overflow File. The Volume Header is always located in the same place. # The Allocation File which keeps track of which allocation blocks are free and which are in use. It is similar to the Volume Bitmap in HFS, in which each allocation block is represented by one bit. A zero means the block is free and a one means the block is in use. The main difference with the HFS Volume Bitmap, is that the Allocation File is stored as a regular file, it does not occupy a special reserved space near the beginning of the volume. The Allocation File can also change size and does not have to be stored contiguously within a volume. # The Catalog File is a B-tree that contains records for all the files and directories stored in the volume. The HFS Plus Catalog File is very similar to the HFS Catalog File, the main differences being records are larger to allow more fields and to allow for those fields to be larger (for example to allow the longer 255-character unicode file names in HFS Plus). A record in the HFS Catalog File is 512 bytes in size, a record in the HFS Plus Catalog File is 4 KB in the classic Mac OS and 8 KB in macOS. Fields in HFS are of fixed size, in HFS Plus the size can vary depending on the actual size of the data they store. # The Extents Overflow File is another B-tree that records the allocation blocks that are allocated to each file as extents. Each file record in the Catalog File is capable of recording eight extents for each fork of a file; once those are used additional extents are recorded in the Extents Overflow File. Bad blocks are also recorded as extents in the Extents Overflow File. The default size of an extent record in the classic Mac OS is 1 KB and 4 KB in macOS. # The Attributes File is a new B-tree in HFS Plus that does not have a corresponding structure in HFS. The Attributes File can store three different types of 4 KB records: Inline Data Attribute records, Fork Data Attribute records and Extension Attribute records. Inline Data Attribute records store small attributes that can fit within the record itself. Fork Data Attribute records contain references to a maximum of eight extents that can hold larger attributes. Extension Attributes are used to extend a Fork Data Attribute record when its eight extent records are already used. # The Startup File is designed for non-Mac OS systems that lack HFS or HFS Plus support. It is similar to the Boot Blocks of an HFS volume. # The second-to-last sector contains the Alternate Volume Header, which is equivalent to the Alternate Master Directory Block of HFS. Note that this is the second-to-last-sector for the disk, not the volume; if the disk is larger than the volume, the AVH will be outside the range of the filesystem. # The last sector in the volume is reserved for use by Apple. It is used during the computer manufacturing process.  Criticisms  HFS Plus lacks several features considered staples of modern file systems like ZFS and NTFS. Data checksums are the most routinely cited missing feature. Additionally, the core of the file system uses case-insensitive NFD Unicode strings, which led Linus Torvalds to say that \\"HFS+ is probably the worst file-system ever.\\" Besides checksumming, features of modern file systems that HFS+ lacks include: * nanosecond timestamps * concurrent access (that is, more than one process can access the filesystem at the same time) * snapshotting * Support for dates beyond February 6, 2040 * sparse file support * a better implementation of hard links (in other filesystems, these are typically multiple directory entries pointing to the same data blocks; hard links in macOS are implemented as small files that are stored in a special hidden directory) HFS Plus was not designed for Unix-like systems, so features such as file system permissions and hard links had to be retrofitted when Apple moved to Mac OS X.  Other operating systems = Linux = The Linux kernel includes the hfsplus module for mounting HFS+ filesystems read-write. HFS+ fsck and mkfs have been ported to Linux and are part of the hfsprogs package. In 2009, these drivers were diagnosed to be corrupting HFS+ drives with a capacity greater than 2 TB. Consequently, Linux distributions such as Debian and Ubuntu also stopped allowing mounting of HFS+ drives or partitions greater than 2 TB. , work is in progress to lift this restriction. Under Linux's current HFS+ driver, journaling must be disabled in order to write data safely onto an HFS+ partition. Provided the partition isn't being used by Apple's Time Machine software, journaling can be disabled under macOS: Using Disk Utility in OS X Yosemite, the user may hold Alt/Option and click \\"Disable Journaling\\" on the File menu, having first selected a mounted partition. An HFS+ partition with journaling enabled may be forcibly mounted with write-access under Linux, but this is unsupported and unwise. A Google Summer of Code project to implement write-support to journaled HFS+ was accepted by the Linux Foundation in 2011 but was not completed at that time and is still a work in progress. Progress and improvements to the HFS+ driver, including some updates to journaling support, are posted on the linux-fsdevel mailing list from time to time. As of July 2011, Paragon Software Group provided kernel drivers that allow full read-write access to HFS+ journaled volumes. The product is a proprietary implementation of HFS+ based on Paragon's proprietary UFSD library. There are both free and paid editions of the driver, and they include a utility for checking and repairing HFS+ volumes. According to the online documentation (free version or the paid edition ), both the free edition and the paid edition currently support Linux kernels from 2.6.36 up to 4.12.x. Ubuntu, Debian, Fedora, OpenSUSE and CentOS are the only Linux distributions officially supported. = Windows = As of May 2012, Apple has only released read-only HFS+ drivers for Windows XP, Windows Vista, and Windows 7 as part of the Boot Camp software in Mac OS X 10.6. This means users on these systems can read data on the HFS+ drive, but not write to them. Microsoft has created an HFS+ driver for the Xbox 360 mainly for the purpose of reading HFS+ formatted iPods. A free and opensource software ‚Äì jHFSplus, based on HFSExplorer and jpfm ‚Äì can be used to mount hfs/hfs+ partitions as read-only virtual folders. A freeware plugin for Total Commander exists, that can read, among others, HFS and HFS+ filesystems. DiskInternals Linux Reader can be used to extract/save folders/files out of HFS and HFS+ Hard Drives/Partitions. A commercial product, MacDrive, is also available for mounting HFS and HFS+ drives, optical discs, and other media in Windows Explorer, and allows both reading and writing to the volume, as well as repairing and formatting Mac disks. A commercial product, Paragon's HFS+ for Windows allows full read and write and disk management from all versions of Windows from Windows XP to Windows Server 2008. = Cross-platform = A free (GPL) alternative is HFSExplorer written by Erik Larsson. HFSExplorer is a Java application for viewing and extracting files from an HFS+ volume (Mac OS Extended) or an HFSX volume (Mac OS Extended, Case-sensitive). The volume can be located either on a physical disk, in various Apple disk image and sparse disk image formats, or a raw file system dump. However, HFSExplorer is a read-only solution; it cannot write to HFS-formatted volumes.

A minor camp, the Warsaw camp is absent from most standard accounts of the Holocaust. Over the course of its operation an estimated 8,000‚Äì9,000 prisoners were held at the camp and performed slave labor. About 4,000 to 5,000 of the prisoners are estimated to have died in the camp, during the death march from the camp, the Warsaw Uprising, and hiding after the uprising. The camp, which has little coverage in mainstream historiography, has been at the center of a conspiracy theory that asserts that a giant gas chamber was built in a tunnel near Warszawa Zachodnia station and that 200,000 mainly non-Jewish Poles were exterminated at the site.  History  Letter from Oswald Pohl to Heinrich Himmler dated 23 July 1943 on creation of KL Warsaw, noting arrival of first 300 prisoners In February 1943, Heinrich Himmler ordered that local Jews should be placed in a camp to help clear the Warsaw ghetto following its demolition. However, fierce fighting during the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising foiled this plan. Following the defeat of the uprising in April, surviving Jews were deported to camps in the vicinity of Lublin, sent to Treblinka extermination camp, or summarily killed. The concentration camp was established in July 1943, but Jewish prisoners were not from Warsaw but rather from other concentration camps in Europe. The camp was located at the Gestapo prison (Gƒôsi√≥wka), which was the only building left intact in the ghetto. By May 1944 the camp became a subcamp of Majdanek concentration camp, and was named \\"Lublin concentration camp‚ÄìWarsaw labor camp\\" (). According to some sources, it came due to deportations of prisoners to other camps as well as the approach of the Soviet army to Warsaw. Historian Bogus≈Çaw Tadeusz Kopka writes, however, that widespread corruption among the camp's personnel forced SS authorities to arrest camp commandant Nikolaus Herbet, transfer whole guard company back to Germany and, consequently, to strip the camp with its independent status. Originally planned to close on 1 August 1944, in light of the Soviet advance the camp was closed in July. In July 1944 most prisoners, some 4,500, were sent on a death march to Kutno (the first organized Nazi death march in the war), walking some 30 kilometers a day with many murdered on the way. From Kutno, they were crammed onto a train (100 men to a boxcar with no food rations) bound to Dachau concentration camp; some 4,000 survived the journey to Dachau. Around 200 of the most exhausted prisoners were killed prior to the march and 300 prisoners volunteered to remain to dismantle the camp. Some 350 Jewish prisoners remained during the August Warsaw Uprising and were liberated on 4 August 1944 by Polish forces. They included dozens of Jews (including 24 women) who were imprisoned in Pawiak and transferred to the camp on 31 July. The vast majority of released Jewish prisoners took part in the uprising, many of them dying during the fighting. Those released were mostly Greek and Hungarian Jews, with some Czechoslovakians and Dutch Jews, who knew very little Polish. Morale among Jewish fighters was hurt by displays of antisemitism, with several former Jewish prisoners in combat units killed by antisemitic Poles, in particular those associated with the National Armed Forces. After the defeat of the uprising, survivors fled or hid in bunkers, there were some 200 Jewish survivors (former prisoners as well as Jews who hid on the \\"Aryan\\" side) when the Soviets entered Warsaw on 17 January 1945. The book \\"The Bunker\\" by Charles Goldstein, a camp inmate, recounts his experiences in the camp and survival. In executions in the ruins of the Warsaw Ghetto (around and in the site of the concentration camp), Kopka estimates that the Germans killed some 20,000 people including camp inmates, Polish Jews caught hiding on the \\"Aryan side\\" of Warsaw, and Polish Political prisoners. Also, the Jews who were hiding in the ruins of the ghetto and were discovered (and subsequently shot) during the demolition works, are counted among the KL Warschau victims.Barbara Engelking, Jacek Leociak: Getto warszawskie. Przewodnik po nieistniejƒÖcym mie≈õcie. Warszawa: Stowarzyszenie Centrum Bada≈Ñ nad Zag≈ÇadƒÖ ≈ªyd√≥w, 2013. . Page 824 The Institute of National Remembrance estimates the number of Poles murdered on site of the camp and executed in its vicinity at 10,000. In the foreword to the Kopka's monograph about Warsaw concentration camp Jan ≈ªaryn wrote: \\"In the years 1943‚Äì1944 in the venue of the camp were murdered ‚Äì as it seems ‚Äì at least 20,000 prisoners, among them around 10,000 Poles\\".  Demolition and salvage  Prisoners were tasked with clearing 2.6 million cubic meters of rubble, in order to convert the former ghetto into a park, and in order to salvage building materials (mainly scrap metal and bricks) for the German war effort. The demolition and salvage work were hard and perilous labor, carried out at a brisk pace with no regard to loss of life of the prisoners. By June 1944, 10 million square meters were demolished, with some 8,105 tons of metal and 34 million bricks salvaged. A couple thousand of Polish civilians, who were paid, also worked alongside the Jewish prisoners, as did dozens of German technicians. German constructions firms operated on contract to carry out salvage: Berlinisches Baugesch√§ft (Berlin), Willy Keymer (Warsaw), Merckle (Ostr√≥w Wielkopolski), Ostdeutscher Tiefbau (Naumburg). The Ostbahn railway company assisted them.  Prisoners  Prisoners of camp with Polish soldiers from Battalion Zo≈õka on 5 August 1944 The first transport of some 300 hundred prisoners came from Buchenwald concentration camp, who were German political prisoners and criminals who would be tasked with day-to-day administration of the camp as kapos. The German kapo prisoners, in particular those imprisoned as criminals, intimidated the Jewish prisoners and acted towards them with cruelty, seeing them as expendable. The prisoners were mainly Jewish males from Auschwitz concentration camp, who were selected on the basis of decent physical condition for hard work and not being Polish. Lack of knowledge of Polish was deemed key by the Germans to prevent escape attempts and limit contact with Polish workers who were also employed, though in the November 1943 transport some 50 Polish Jews were included to meet the 1,000 transport quota. From August through November 1943, four transports of 3,683 Jews were sent to the camp from Auschwitz, many of them Greek Salonikan Jews.Clearing the Ruins of the Ghetto, Yad Vashem In May and June 1944, some 4,000 to 5,000 Hungarian Jews were sent to the camp, to replenish the prisoner workforce that at that point numbered approximately 1,000 and the Germans considered to be depleted. A minor camp, the Warsaw camp is absent from most standard Holocaust accounts. Over the course of its operation an estimated 8,000‚Äì9,000 prisoners were engaged in slave labor, of whom 4,000 to 5,000 are estimated to have died in the camp, during the death march from the camp, the uprising, and hiding after the uprising. Successful escapes were rare, and those caught in the attempt were hanged in front of the assembled prisoner population. Hundreds died due to executions, cruelty, and exhaustion from labor. Following a typhus epidemic which decimated the prisoner population in January through February 1944, only a third of the inmates survived. Survival on the meager rations provided was impossible, and prisoners survived by locating valuables in the rubble and selling them to the Polish civilians who worked alongside them. As such finds became rare late in the camp's operations, many prisoners resorted to extracting gold fillings from their teeth for sale.  German personnel  Multilingual (German, Polish, Hungarian and French) sign at camp fence, reads: \\"Attention! Neutral zone. Shooting without warning!\\" The camp was first commanded by Wilhelm G√∂cke until September 1943, then by Nikolaus Herbet and finally Wilhelm Ruppert who commanded the evacuation in July 1944. The Schutzstaffel (SS) force guarding and operating the camp was approximately the size of a company. The original SS unit was gathered from various other camps, including Trawniki concentration camp and Sachsenhausen concentration camp, and following the attachment to Majdanek in May 1944 they were replaced with SS personnel from Lublin. The SS personnel mainly guarded the perimeter of the camp and were brutally violent towards the Jews, viewing them as enemies of the state. Following the war, eight SS men from the camp were executed for their role in murder; three were sentenced by a Polish court and five by a German court. Walter Wawrzyniak, who was initially sentenced to death in 1950 by an East German court, had his sentence reduced on appeal to a life term. In July 2000, Theodor Szehinskyj, who immigrated to the US, had his US citizenship stripped as a US court found that he had lied in his initial visa application about his SS past.  Executions in ghetto ruins  Ruins of the tenement house at 27 Dzielna Street in former Warsaw Ghetto, near Pawiak prison, this site was used as an execution spot in 1943‚Äì1944 Camp inmates, Polish Jews caught hiding on the \\"Aryan side\\" of Warsaw, Polish political prisoners (Pawiak inmates) and Polish hostages captured during the street roundups were executed in the ruins of the former ghetto (which surrounded the camp) in 1943‚Äì1944. It is impossible to determine the exact number of victims of executions in the ruins, however historian Bogus≈Çaw Tadeusz Kopka estimates that some 20,000 people were executed in the period. These included camp inmates, Polish Jews caught hiding on the \\"Aryan side\\" of Warsaw, and ethnic Poles. The ruins of the ghetto supplanted previous execution sites, which were in the countryside around Warsaw, such as the Kampinos Forest (the site of the Palmiry massacre). Proximity of the Pawiak prison and the isolation of the former ghetto from the rest of the city, made them ‚Äì from the German perspective ‚Äì a far more suitable place for mass killings.W≈Çadys≈Çaw Bartoszewski: Warszawski pier≈õcie≈Ñ ≈õmierci 1939‚Äì1944. Warszawa: Interpress, 1970. Page 256. Individual and mass executions of the hostages and prisoners of Pawiak were conducted in the venue of the camp or in his proximity. Members of KL Warschau personnel, along with the members of other SS and Ordnungspolizei formations in Warsaw, were among the executioners. Furthermore, a special \\"death detachment\\" composed with the Jewish prisoners of the KL Warschau was used to dispose the bodies of the victims. At the beginning bodies were burnt in open air pyres, later, in the camp's crematory.  Postwar  The Red Army entered Warsaw on 17 January 1945. The former Nazi camp was operated by the Soviet NKVD for German prisoners of war, as well as for the soldiers of the Armia Krajowa (the Home Army) loyal to the Polish government-in-exile and other persons suspected of opposing the Soviet occupation. The camp was turned over to the Ministry of Public Security in mid-1945 and most of the German prisoners were released in 1948 and 1949. Subsequently, common criminals and people accused of \\"economic sabotage\\" were imprisoned there and forced to work, mostly in manufacturing of construction materials which were later used for rebuilding of Warsaw. According to Bogus≈Çaw Kopka, 1800 people died in the postwar prisons. The site was closed and demolished in 1956; no element of the Nazi camp was preserved. The fact that the former Nazi camp was taken and run by the communist authorities was the main reason why Chief Commission for the Investigation of German Crimes in Poland ceased its investigation into the Nazi camp in 1947. As of 2007, the site is occupied by a garden square, residential buildings, and the building of the POLIN Museum of the History of Polish Jews. Eight former SS guards were tried, convicted, and executed for crimes committed at the camp by 1950; five of them had been tried by German courts and three by Polish courts. Walter Wawrzyniak was convicted in 1950 for murder of prisoners, but his death sentence was commuted to life imprisonment. In 2000, Theodor Szehinskyj, a former guard who immigrated to the United States, was denaturalized because of his SS service at various concentration camps, including Warsaw. J√ºrgen Stroop's trial in 1950 included significant evidence relating to the concentration camp. Both German and Polish authorities conducted criminal investigations into the camp, which were halted in 1980 and 1996 respectively because of the deaths of many perpetrators and difficulty locating others.  Extermination camp conspiracy theory  Tunnels at Warszawa Zachodnia station, the second tunnel from the left is the supposed site of a giant gas chamber used to exterminate non-Jewish Poles Despite basic research being available on the camp, a legend or conspiracy theory developed in Poland around the camp. This was first advanced by judge and author Maria Trzci≈Ñska in the 1970s and is promoted by Polish nationalists who argue that Poles suffered a Holocaust during World War II, called by some supporters \\"Polocaust\\". The legend/conspiracy theory claims that the camp was much larger, and functioned as an extermination camp for the non-Jewish population of Warsaw, killing 200,000 mainly non-Jewish Poles. The alleged killing used a giant gas chamber supposedly constructed in the tunnel (near Warszawa Zachodnia station). By promoting a theory that the Germans constructed a gas chamber to kill non-Jews, coupled with the killing of as many as 200,000 additional victims of the Warsaw Uprising (for a total of 400,000 non-Jewish victims in Warsaw), supporters of the theory attempt to create a parity between Jewish and non-Jewish Poles which would make the Holocaust less unique. The nationalist daily Nasz Dziennik has promoted this conspiracy theory and the camp as a symbol of Polish martyrdom, advocating introduction of material to school curricula and the construction of a museum. Unlike other concentration camps that are extensively covered in historical literature (e.g. the Auschwitz concentration camp), the Warsaw concentration camp is nearly absent in mainstream historiography, allowing Nasz Dziennik to break ground on a \\"new continent\\". In 2010 the Institute of National Remembrance (IPN) commissioned a report from historian and aerial photography specialist Zygmunt Walkowski. Walkowski states that his report, seven years in the works, thoroughly refutes all aspects of the conspiracy theory; as of 2020 the IPN is yet to publish it, and continues to refer to earlier work by Bogus≈Çaw Kopka.

In 1945‚Äì56 the Gƒôsi√≥wka served as a prison and labor camp, operated first by the Soviet NKVD to imprison Polish resistance fighters of the Home Army and other opponents of Poland's new Stalinist regime, then by the Polish communist secret police.  History  Before the war, Gƒôsi√≥wka was a military prison of the Polish Army on Gƒôsia Street (now Anielewicza Street), near the intersection with Okopowa Street and the Jewish cemetery. Beginning in 1939, after the German occupation of Poland, it became a re-education camp of the German security police (Arbeitserziehungslager der Sicherheitspolizei Warschau). In 1943, the prison was turned into a concentration camp for mostly Jewish inmates from countries other than Poland, Greece and Hungary in particular. The camp, known as the Warsaw concentration camp, housed, over the course of its operation, an estimated 8,000‚Äì9,000 prisoners, who were engaged in slave labour. 4,000 to 5,000 are estimated to have died in the camp, during the death march from the camp, the Warsaw Uprising, and hiding after the uprising.The United States Holocaust Memorial Museum Encyclopedia of Camps and Ghettos, 1933‚Äì1945, Geoffrey P.

It also may refer to German bombing raids during the Warsaw Uprising in 1944. During the course of the war approximately 85% of the city was destroyed due to German mass bombings, heavy artillery fire and a planned demolition campaign.Bombardowania Warszawy z wrze≈õnia 1939 (Bombing of Warsaw in September 1939) Polish Radio, 28 September 2007. Warsaw after German bombardment in September 1939. Siege of Warsaw by Julien Bryan Siege of Warsaw (1939) In 1939, the Luftwaffe opened the German attack on Poland with operation Wasserkante, an air attack on Warsaw on 1 September. This attack by four bomber groups was of limited effectiveness due to low-lying cloud cover and stout Polish resistance by the PZL P.11 fighters of the Pursuit Brigade, which claimed down 16 German aircraft for the loss of 10 of their own. However, heavy losses in Polish fighter aircraft meant that by 6 September the air defense of Warsaw was in the hands of the 40 mm (24 guns), 75 mm (72 guns) anti-aircraft guns and many anti-aircraft machine guns of the Warsaw Defense Command.Olga Tumi≈Ñska, Obrona przeciwlotnicza Warszawy (Air-defence of Warsaw), Institute of National Remembrance As the German Army approached Warsaw on 8 September 1939, 140 Junkers Ju 87 Stukas attacked the portions of the city on the east bank of the Vistula River and other bombers bombed the Polish Army positions in the western suburbs. On 13 September Luftwaffe level and dive bombers caused widespread fires. Further resistance was followed by propaganda leaflet drops. Finally, starting at 0800 on 25 September, Luftwaffe bombers under the command of Major Wolfram Freiherr von Richthofen conducted the largest air raid ever seen by that time, dropping 560 tons of high explosive bombs and 72 tons of incendiary bombs, in coordination with heavy artillery shelling by Army units. The center of Warsaw was badly damaged. Approximately 1,150 sorties were flown by a wide variety of aircraft, including obsolescent Junkers Ju 52/3m bombers, which dropped 13 percent of the incendiary bombs dropped on the day. Only two Ju 52 bombers were lost. Although commonly portrayed as being absolutely decisive, the Black Monday air attack was a mixed success. While the bombing lowered Polish morale, it did not cause the Polish surrender. Smoke from fires and large amounts of dust obscured targets and greatly reduced accuracy. As a result, Luftwaffe bombers dropped a significant amount of their bomb loads on German infantry positions in the northwest suburbs of the city, leading to acrimonious discussions between Luftwaffe and Army commanders. The tonnage dropped combined with only approximate delivery on target and the short duration does not begin to approximate the intensity of attacks major European cities were subsequently to suffer. However, on 26 September three key forts in the city defenses were captured, and the Polish garrison offered its surrender - on 27 September German troops entered the city. By estimates around 20,000 to 25,000 civilians were killed,Polskie Radio (25 Sep 2012) Czarny poniedzia≈Çek http://www.polskieradio.pl/39/156/Artykul/689947,Czarny- poniedzialek-i-630-ton-bombDer Spiegel Wir warden sie ausradieren No. 3 vol. 13, 13 January 2003, p. 123. 40 percent of the buildings in the city were damaged and 10 percent of the buildings destroyed. However, some of the damage was the result of ground artillery fire and not solely caused by aerial bombing‚Äîincluding intense street fighting between German infantry and armor units and Polish infantry and artillery. The September 25 raid had the aim of breaking Polish morale and forcing a surrender. According to the laws of war in 1939, Warsaw was a defended military target and the Luftwaffe raid could be construed as a legitimate military operation. The Siege of Warsaw accounted for 10% destroyed buildings by late-1939.  Warsaw Uprising (1944)  The 1944 uprising in Warsaw broke out despite Germany having air superiority/support. Despite this, the Luftwaffe Air Force conducted numerous strikes against Polish resistance and civilian targets. Warsaw's infrastructure was also heavily damaged by air raids, as desperate street-to- street fighting took place in the destroyed areas. After 63 days of heavy urban fighting, the Luftwaffe's combined efforts with artillery bombardment, and systemic destruction accounted for 85%-90% destroyed buildings by January 1945.

It first aired in the NBC Saturday morning lineup on September 29, 1973, and was written by Margaret Armen,This story was expanded into a novelette by science-fiction author Alan Dean Foster as part of the collection, Star Trek Log Two (1974) (). author of three Original Series episodes.Armen wrote The Original Series episodes \\"The Gamesters of Triskelion\\", \\"The Paradise Syndrome\\" and \\"The Cloud Minders\\" (teleplay only). Set in the 23rd century, the series follows the adventures of Captain James T. Kirk (voiced by William Shatner) and the crew of the Federation starship Enterprise. In this episode, Lt. Uhura (voiced by Nichelle Nichols), Nurse Chapel (voiced by Majel Barrett) and the Enterprise women must take charge of the ship from incapacitated male senior officers and rescue Captain Kirk and his landing party held on an alien world. Plot The Federation starship Enterprise investigates a sector of space where starships have been disappearing every 27.346 years. A compelling musical signal lures the Enterprise to a remote planet in the Taurean system. The music works on the men of the Enterprise, affecting their judgement and causing them to experience euphoric hallucinations. Captain Kirk, First Officer Spock, Chief Medical Officer Dr. McCoy, and Lieutenant Carver beam down to the source of the signals. The inhabitants are a race of beautiful women who want to celebrate their arrival. As they indulge in the entertainments the women offer, they find themselves in a lethargic state and rapidly aging. Headbands locked around their foreheads transmit their life-force to the women, who are growing in strength. On board the Enterprise, Communications Officer Lt. Uhura talks with Nurse Chapel about the men's condition and concludes that she must take command due to the euphoric state of Chief Engineer Scott. Kirk and his party gather enough strength to escape to a spacious garden and hide inside a tall urn. They realize the pace of their loss of strength correlates with the proximity of the women. They decide that Spock should go back alone and attempt to find their communicators and contact the ship, since he has not deteriorated as much as the others. Spock completes his task and orders Uhura to come down with an all-female rescue party. Uhura beams down with Chapel and a female security force. When the native women try to force them to leave, they stun them with their phasers. When Uhura threatens to destroy their temple, the Taurean women explain how they came to be in their current situation; when their people settled on the planet, the planet weakened them, and the women could only survive by draining the men's remaining energy, causing their deaths. The women are now immortal and unaging, but cannot reproduce, and every 27 years must lure males and drain their life forces to stay alive. At Uhura's urging, the Taurean women help them locate the male landing party, who are drowning in the urn due to a rainstorm. The female landing party frees them using their phasers. The aging process is stopped with the removal of the headbands, but they cannot find a treatment to restore their original age. Spock comes up with the idea of using their original transporter patterns from when they first beamed down. Uhura returns to the planet, and witnesses the Taurean leader, Theela, destroying the device that had been luring starships, stating that Uhura should tell Kirk she kept her side of the bargain. Uhura informs them that a ship of women will return to bring them to a habitable world and that the women's bodies should return to normal in a few months. Theela is pleased, preferring a life fully lived to a static immortality. Production In addition to her normal role as Nurse Chapel, Majel Barrett supplies the voice of Theela, the head of the Taurean women, Nichelle Nichols supplies the voice of security officer Lt. Davison in addition to that of Lt. Uhura and James Doohan adds the voice of Lt. Carver to his usual role of Chief Engineer Scott. (Doohan also sings part of an old Welsh folk song, \\"Yr Hufen Melyn\\" (\\"The Yellow Cream\\") as the Enterprise is seen drifting by the planet, in a segment that lasts over half a minute.)

It first aired on NBC on October 20, 1973, and was written by Original Series cast member Walter Koenig. It was the actor's only involvement in the series, as he had not been hired to voice Pavel Chekov in the animated version due to budgetary limitations. With \\"The Infinite Vulcan\\", Koenig became the first member of the Star Trek cast to write an episode for the franchise. As with the rest of the first season, the episode was directed by Hal Sutherland. Set in the 23rd century, the series follows the adventures of Captain James T. Kirk (voiced by William Shatner) and the crew of the Starfleet starship Enterprise. In this episode, the crew visit a planet inhabited by plant-based lifeforms and must save the life of Science Officer Spock (voiced by Leonard Nimoy) after he is abducted by a giant clone of Dr. Stavos Keniclius (voiced by James Doohan). Koenig was hired to write the script after some of his work was passed from Susan Sackett to series creator Gene Roddenberry. Koenig found the writing process for the episode unenjoyable, due to the number of re- writes required. Further additions were made by Roddenberry, including talking vegetables as characters. When the producers offered him a second episode, Koenig turned it down. \\"The Infinite Vulcan\\" received a mixed reception from critics, who suggested that the writing could have been better, but others included it in lists of the best episodes of The Animated Series. Plot While exploring the newly discovered planet Phylos for possible Federation colonization, Lt. Sulu picks up a walking plant, called a Retlaw, and is poisoned by a stinger. The plantlike alien beings who inhabit the planet approach the Enterprise landing party and their leader, Agmar, saves Sulu's life. The Phylosians say they were nearly wiped out by a mild terrestrial disease that was brought to the planet by Dr. Stavos Keniclius, a Terran scientist who survived Earth's Eugenics Wars. A giant clone of Keniclius, named Keniclius Five, kidnaps First Officer Spock. Keniclius has survived through the centuries by periodically transferring his consciousness into a new, more advanced clone body. He believes the galaxy is as war-ravaged as Earth was when he left it. He plans to enforce peace on the galaxy with the aid of a fleet of Phylosian ships and a giant clone of Spock that he's created by transferring Spock's consciousness into it, leaving Spock's original body a mindless shell. The newly awakened Spock Two uses his Vulcan telepathic abilities to mind meld with his original self and save his life. The two Spocks, in concert with Captain James T. Kirk, convince Keniclius that the need for his plan no longer exists. Spock Two and Keniclius Five devote themselves to restoring the Phylosian civilization as Spock One departs with his shipmates. Production Walter Koenig (pictured in 1979) became the first actor in the franchise to write an episode. Walter Koenig joined the main cast of Star Trek: The Original Series during the second season as Pavel Chekov and continued to appear in the series until it was cancelled at the end of season three. Although the remaining main cast of the series were hired as voice actors for Star Trek: The Animated Series, Koenig was not brought in due to financial restraints. He only found out about his omission from the show when Sackett announced it on stage at a Star Trek convention he was attending. His character was replaced by a new animated character voiced by James Doohan. Koenig first became involved with writing a script for The Animated Series after he asked Susan Sackett, Star Trek creator Gene Roddenberry's assistant, to type up some writing he was working on. After reading it through, she thought it was good and passed it to Roddenberry, who agreed and asked Koenig if he was interested in writing for the animated show. He accepted the offer, and started working on a plot involving cloning which was inspired by newspaper articles about the subject, becoming the first actor from Star Trek to write for the franchise. He found the writing process for \\"The Infinite Vulcan\\" \\"unbearable\\". This was due to interference from Roddenberry, resulting in Koenig producing ten drafts of the screenplay, and because of Koenig's frustration in not otherwise being involved in the series. He could not understand why so many redrafts were required, a view shared by story editor/associate producer D.C. Fontana. Roddenberry was keen in particular to make use of the benefits of an animated medium, by including things which could not have been shown on a live-action series. These included \\"talking vegetables\\" as characters, which Koenig said were not his idea but were so silly as to not be worthy of a fight. David Alexander, in his book Star Trek Creator: The Authorised Biography of Gene Roddenberry, suggested that Koenig was hired to write \\"The Infinite Vulcan\\" because Roddenberry felt \\"bad\\" about Koenig's exclusion from the series. Koenig asked to play the part of Dr. Keniclius. Roddenberry and Fontana approved, and the show's producers allowed him to audition, but he said later that he suspected it was \\"a very token gesture\\" and they were not seriously considering him. He included a reference to himself in the episode, as the walking plant is called a Retlaw ‚Äì Walter spelled backwards. This was a reference to aliens in the 1940s comic book Planet Comics who spoke backwards. He later used a similar idea in \\"The Stranger\\", a Land of the Lost episode he wrote, in which Koenig introduced the character Enik. This character was originally called Eneg, backwards for Gene as a reference to Gene Roddenberry. Koenig felt that \\"The Infinite Vulcan\\" turned out \\"OK\\", and had heard a number of opinions on it ranging from it being the best episode of The Animated Series to it being the very worst. He felt overall that it was \\"an interesting take and certainly a little different.\\" Fellow cast member George Takei felt the episode showed that Koenig was \\"enterprising\\". The producers liked the episode so much that they wanted Koenig to write another, but he turned them down. Koenig later explained that he was still upset at the time over not appearing as Chekov in the series. Keniclius later appeared in Kevin Lauderdale's story \\"The Rules of War,\\" which takes place during the Eugenics Wars, in the anthology Strange New Worlds IX. Reception and home media release \\"The Infinite Vulcan\\" was first broadcast on NBC on October 20, 1973. James Van Hise wrote in his book The Man Who Created Star Trek: Gene Roddenberry, that \\"some of the writing on the series\\", specifically that on \\"The Infinite Vulcan\\", \\"left much to be desired\\". In James Rundle's retrospective of the episodes for SciFiNow, he gave \\"The Infinite Vulcan\\" a rating of three out of five. \\"The Infinite Vulcan\\" was included in best of/recommend lists by some reviewers. In Wired magazine's list of episodes of the series to watch after they became available for free on the official Star Trek website, \\"The Infinite Vulcan\\" was included specifically because it was the first episode of the franchise to be written by one of the actors. The episode was included in seventh place of the best episodes of the series by the website Topless Robot, who added that while Keniclius' plan was \\"unclear\\", it had the \\"greatest ending of a cartoon ever.\\" This story was expanded into a novelette by science-fiction author Alan Dean Foster as part of the collection of The Animated Series adapted novelizations and was released as part of Star Trek Log Two, published in September 1974. The other episodes adapted in the same work were \\"The Survivor\\" and \\"The Lorelei Signal\\". \\"The Infinite Vulcan\\" was released on LaserDisc as part of the series set. The first release of Star Trek: The Animated Series on DVD was through fan-made productions. The official DVD release was on November 21, 2006 in the United States, a single release containing all episodes from both seasons of the television show.

It is marketed and produced by Broccoli, which produces games and Anime-related goods. In the game, the player takes the role of a \\"Mindbreaker\\", who can control and unlock the powers of the game characters. The goal is to defeat other Mindbreakers (players) and to grow stronger. The game continues until the player has defeated all of their opponents, or has been stripped of their powers; thus being knocked out of the game. Unlike similar TCG, the player fields game characters instead of spells. They must gain control over each character before it can be used in a game. If a player is unable to control a character properly, it may turn on them. The Aquarian Age franchise now supports a PlayStation game, a comic book, and a TV series; Aquarian Age: Sign for Evolution featuring a musical score by composer Yuki Kajiura. Story As far as the history of humanity is concerned, there has always been war. Conflicts overt and covert, known and secret, battles fought that would influence the histories of future generations. Across centuries, three secret but powerful organizations have fought for control, even as mere mortal forces struggled with their own petty wars and attempts at grandeur. These three forces have worked to shape mankind's destiny with their powers of magery, savagery, and mysticism all the while keeping away from the eyes of those they control. Each force was a counterbalance to the other. Arayashiki represented the mysticism of the Eastern world. WIZ-DOM subsisted on the magicks of the Western world. Finally there were the inhuman Darklore, from which tales of were-beasts and changelings abound. Each faction, however, sought also to duel with the others for control and power. Using both their abilities, and their influence over those they controlled, these forces caused many of the great battles humanity knows as part of its bloodstained history. Today, two millennia since it had begun, these three forces were locked in stalemate. The year 2000 AD, the opening of the 21st Century. The Age of Aquarius which astrologers had long since foretold, had finally arrived. Some believe it to be an age of peace, a new world order. Others proclaim it as the coming of the biblical end times. Whatever truth it would be, the Aquarian Age is the age of great changes, during which the shape of humankind would never be the same. From this generation emerged a new breed of human, one with the ability to influence objects and other people with the mere power of their minds. Calling themselves E.G.O., this group of psionics claimed to represent the new evolution in humankind, a new faction that challenged the existing triumvirate for the power to shape destiny. Another group also emerged; Individuals who have the gift to both empower and control members of the other factions, and using them to fight their battles. This unaligned group's members gained control of agents from the previous groups, just as those factions once did mortal men. These were the Mindbreakers, who were loyal to no one but themselves, and served their own personal agendas. In the midst of this new turmoil was thrown a new and unquantified faction. From the heavens came an alien force of great power, their apparent goal to destroy the human species. Despite this, these aliens have not openly attacked, alternating between study of the four factions and the Mindbreakers, and actively participating in the battles. This mysterious force with no clear goals or purpose, was dubbed Eraser by the other factions due to their terrifying power. During the chaotic period known in Western astrology as the Aquarian Age, the alien ERASER fleet attacks Earth, ravaging cities. However, a counteroffensive is launched. The four factions - ARAYASHIKI, WIZ-DOM, DARKLORE, and E.G.O. - who have previously been fighting each other for control of Earth, join forces to defeat the ERASERS. In the aftermath of the conflict, Earth is placed under the unified rule of the Polestar Empire. However, peace is shattered when the Empire begins to use forbidden magic. These dark powers cause dimensional rifts around the world and once again plunge Earth into chaos and warfare. Anime Aquarian Age was adapted into an animated Japanese television series, Aquarian Age: Sign for Evolution. Factions of the Aquarian Age= Arayashiki = The Arayashiki represent the eastern mages, primarily the onmyouji, who practice magic in theory with the Tao (Yin and Yang). Most of the members of this group seem to primarily represent Japanese mystics, but Chinese (and maybe even Indian) mages are included as well. Although not as widespread as E.G.O., most Arayashiki members are quite commonly found, even ignored, in modern Asian society. Most of their kind occupy Asia as a whole, with particular concentrations in Japan and China (two of the most socio-politically developed nations in the region). Typical Arayashiki skills include the ability to commune with spirits and nature, all inclined towards the Eastern forms of magic (such as onmyoujitsu). Some are even skilled with martial arts of varying types, as well as Eastern (particularly Japanese) archaic weaponry. Common types of Arayashiki are: Miko (Japanese shrine-maidens) and other spiritually-inclined occupations. Many martial arts practitioners of the esoteric bent, especially the infamous Ninja, are also surprisingly common among them as bodyguards and spies. Of particular note is that members of the Ainu indigenous tribes of northern Japan also figure quite strongly with them. The remainder of the Arayashiki consist of spirits, especially those of various Asian mythological figures. The Arayashiki are highly traditionalist, and clash constantly with their direct western opposite, the WIZ-DOM. The name \\"Arayashiki\\" most likely comes from the Japanese word for the Buddhist Yogacharan concept of a store consciousness, the idea that karmic occurrences are \\"stored\\" in the unconscious and affect our karma and perceptions of the world. =WIZ-DOM= The members of WIZ-DOM represent western magery, which includes (but is not limited to) pagan, druidic, and even kabbalistic magic. These will be quite familiar to people in the west, as they go by many terms such as witches, warlocks, wizards, and all other European-influenced symbols of magery. WIZ- DOM members hail from all sects of western magic. Some might even be disguised as clerics of an established religion; although whether they are really part of these religions (WIZ-DOM members have been seen in both Catholic and Protestant denominations), it remains to be seen whether these are genuine alliances or mere cover for their true nature. WIZ-DOM members seem to be rather isolated from most of society. Since their magic is of the western variety, skilled in a wide variety of occult practices. Common WIZ-DOM archetypes include sorceresses, alchemists, priestesses, knights, spirits and ghosts, and artificial beings (such as elementals and golems) created via magic. There are also a lot of scholars, as well as people proficient in fortune-telling techniques and archaic western weaponry. Western magic emphasises control over the magical forces (as opposed to the emphasis on harmony espoused by Eastern magic and shamanism). WIZ-DOM considers the Arayashiki their mortal enemy. They fight for their own ways and their own homelands and care little for anything else. Well, except power, that is. =Darklore= The Darklore faction consists of demihumans and monsters. Under these are the werewolves and other were-creatures, as well as non-humans such as faeries, mermaids and (possibly) elves. Theoretically, they may be the oldest faction among the five, hinting at a pre-human background, but this is still to be confirmed. An extremely varied faction, Darklore is a conglomeration of ancient, forgotten races. Elves, lycanthropes (were- creatures), demons, mermaids, vampires, oni, fairies, even undead. Almost every beast or creature recounted in tales and myths can draw their origin from Darklore sightings. Obviously, only the more human members of Darklore (such as lycanthropes, which change from beast to human at will) can assimilate with human society. Everything but angels and dragons can be lumped under Darklore. Some ancient gods including Ba'al are included as Darklore Typical skills vary widely, depending on race and disposition, but there's a lot of magical power to be found here, usually magic inherent to a given species. The creatures of the Darklore faction want the world that was once theirs back, basically to retake earth from what they see as the human taint. Their principal enemies are the WIZ-DOM and Arayashiki, with whom they have fought for centuries. =E.G.O.= The group E.G.O. is the newest faction to enter the conflict. They claim to be the next level of human evolution, and possess powerful psionic abilities. Also siding with them are androids (artificial humanoids) and cyborgs, the technology of whom might have been taken from Eraser. It's interesting to note that most E.G.O. members appear to be the youngest among those involved in this fight, most of them barely in their late teens yet possessing extensive psionic abilities, among other skills. E.G.O. members are in plain sight and never seen. This is because unlike the isolationist WIZ-DOM or the inhuman Darklore, they are quite sociable, human, and ordinary for the most part. They can be schoolchildren, celebrities, military personnel, teachers, scientists, police, criminals (!), or even menial laborers (waiters/waitresses, maids, etc.). One would never really if the person you're talking to know was part of E.G.O. Assorted androids and cyborgs (presumably taken from Eraser) are also among them, well- hidden. E.G.O. members with occupations tend to be \\"the best in their fields\\" (for instance, scientists on the cutting edge of technology‚Äîor ahead of it). Typical skills and powers include proficiency with modern or even futuristic (probably more Eraser technology) weapons, knowledge of cybernetics, telekinesis and other psychic powers, and genetic enhancements (Eraser/human hybrids, for example). The E.G.O. claim to fight for the next generation, for the future of humanity, and they see themselves as the embodiment of that future. They harass the Erasers frequently, and generally take a dim view of the three \\"old\\" factions, on account of them being outdated. NOTE: The name E.G.O. was originally coined for an all-female group, or \\"Evolutionary Girls Organization\\". With the Juvenile Orion expansion and its all-male additional characters, this just didn't jibe. As of the second series (Aquarian Age Saga II), the group will include both male and female members, and henceforth will be referred to as the \\"Evolutionary Generation Organization\\". =Eraser= The final faction is known as Eraser, the only non-earth based faction. This is the name assigned to them by the other four factions, due to their sheer power. Despite all this power, and their open hostility towards the other four factions, Eraser's true origins are unknown, their actions intermittent, and their motives unclear, save for a claim that it plans to eradicate humanity. All that is known is that they are completely alien to the other factions, and for some reason, has decided to involve itself in their power struggles. Physical descriptions of Eraser vary, but the most notable are the 'Angels', that appear very much like the human interpretation of angels, and their immediate subordinates, a reptiloid race that have been called the 'Dragoons'. They have technology advanced enough that androids, cyborgs, and clones have been manufactured, presumably to act as infiltrators studying the human race and are occasionally involved in the battles. E.G.O. has somehow managed to gain access to some of this technology, which may explain the existence of cyborgs and androids among the E.G.O. as well. Powers and skills among Angel Erasers vary, but they usually rely heavily on advanced science and technology, particularly weapons development. They also seem to possess the power to create \\"miracles\\", such as the ability to stop time. The Dragoon Erasers are much simpler (one may say brutish)--they are an out and out warrior race; when they do use high technology, it's almost always in the form of weapons given to them by the Angels. The androids, cyborgs and clones do whatever the Erasers design them to do, and that covers a wide range of tasks. There have been many references hinting that Eraser possesses a large battlefleet and that this is but one of the many planets they have encountered. It is possible that Eraser is studying the other four factions and the Mindbreakers (especially the latter, due to their unique abilities), but as to what reason, one can only hazard a guess. The Erasers are engaged mostly in fighting the E.G.O. The older factions, occupied with their own battles, take little notice of them; the Erasers pay them little heed in return. But the Erasers wish to destroy humanity, and the E.G.O. - self- proclaimed guardians of humanity's future - have risen up to stop them. Towards the end of the first Aquarian Age Saga, Eraser has been driven off by the four Earthbound Factions and Mindbreakers. It is currently unknown whether they will return at a later date. =Mindbreakers= The Mindbreakers are an interesting new group involved in this battle. They are a group of men and women who have an odd ability; the power to unlock the potential powers of the Arayashiki, WIZ-DOM, Darklore, E.G.O., and even Eraser factions, as well as to somehow gain control of them. They are not a faction like the other five, since each Mindbreaker has his or her own goals and purposes to achieve, as well as methods to achieve them. This often leads Mindbreakers to battle each other. The victor of such a battle gains the loser's power‚Äîthe members of Arayashiki, WIZ-DOM, Darklore, E.G.O. and Eraser previously under the loser's control. Precisely how a Mindbreaker controls one of these factions, much less how they can awaken the new powers within them, is still unknown. Speculation ranges anywhere from advanced psionic powers to emotional attachment. There's no single rule to explain this ability yet, but the presence of a mindbreaker favoring a member of the previously mentioned factions is often enough to tip the balance in a battle. In the Saga II game, the player assumes the role of Mindbreaker, controlling the characters through use of cards. =Polestar Empire= The \\"Empire\\" faction is a group of invaders from another dimension, another Earth with a different history. They are fantasy-inspired characters, such as knights, dragons and the undead. Like Eraser, their ultimate goals are unknown. The Empire faction was introduced in the Saga II series, a 'reboot' of the Aquarian Age card game that integrates the male characters seen in Juvenile Orion with regular Aquarian age gameplay.

Green Bay Packer and Zubaz enthusiasts at the San Diego Boardwalk before the Green Bay Packers and San Diego Chargers game on November 6, 2011.Zubaz (About Us: The Pant, The Myth, The Legend... Zubaz.com) is a brand of shorts and pants that became popular during the early 1990s. History and description In 1988, Bob Truax and Dan Stock began brainstorming a new kind of shorts for the heavy-lifting man.A Brief History of Zubaz Mental Floss. Trex, Ethan. 2011. The pair developed a comfortably baggy pair of shorts with an elastic waistband. Zubaz was registered as a trademark in 1989. Initially, they were marketed as a comfortable, functional pair of shorts for weightlifting. Michael Hegstrand, Joseph Laurinaitis and manager Nick Derella used their professional wrestling personae as The Road Warriors to help popularize the pants in the late 1980s and early 1990s. They hoped to make a pair of shorts that would stretch and expand with the body during a workout. In a short time, the shorts became wildly popular in the United States. The Zubaz company sold $100 million worth of products in 1991 alone. The company slogan was \\"Dare to be Different.\\" Although Zubaz began as a line of shorts, the brand was extended into long pants, caps, shirts, and even diapers. The pants are tapered at the ankle, with the outer part of the leg being longer than the inner part. They have an elastic waistband to allow for greater flexibility and movement. The pants were originally created in a zebra print, but later began to be sold in many other prints. Regardless of the specific design, Zubaz are almost always bright, flashy, and often ostentatious. Zubaz designed the uniforms of several Arena Football League teams in the early 1990s, including the Tampa Bay Storm and the now-defunct New Orleans Night. However, these designs were considered outlandish and were soon replaced. In a 1993 survey in Inside Sports magazine, Zubaz finished third in the voting for \\"Worst Thing to Happen in Sports\\" that year. Ahead of it were the retirement of Michael Jordan and the death of wrestler Dino Bravo. The long pants were the most popular item in the product line. Despite the decline in popularity, fans still sometimes wear Zubaz pants in team colors at professional football games. Zubaz manufactured \\"slider shorts.\\" These shorts had the famous wild patterns at the bottom of the garment while the rest of the garment displayed the name and logo of the sport team and the Zubaz name. The original business went bankrupt in 1996Zubaz pants are back, Her√≥n M√°rquez Estrada, Minneapolis Star Tribune, March 24, 2008. and Truax and Stock bought back the trademark rights. In 2007, Zubaz resurfaced, offering a limited production release of the original classic Zubaz patterns. In 2014 the brand fully resurfaced with a wider selection on its internet storefront. The revived brand opened its first storefront in Fashion Outlets of Niagara Falls, a mall in Niagara Falls, New York, in November 2016; Zubaz chose Western New York as its first brick-and-mortar location because of the brand's particular association with the Buffalo Bills, as fans of the franchise have consistently been one of the brand's most loyal customer bases. In another sign of the resurrection of the Zubaz brand, on July 16, 2008 the Saint Paul Saints independent professional baseball team wore Zubaz pants during their game against the Sioux City Explorers. The bases were also painted in a recognizable Zubaz tiger-striped pattern. On the December 6 edition of professional wrestling TV show, TNA Impact, Christopher Daniels and Kazarian wrestled the main event in pink and black Zubaz pants.

He has received two Guggenheim Fellowships, a MacArthur Fellowship, the Deutsche B√∂rse Photography Prize and the Hasselblad Award.  Early life and education  Robert Hickman Adams was born on May 8, 1937 in Orange, New Jersey to Lois Hickman Adams and Ross Adams. In 1940 the family moved to Madison, New Jersey where his younger sister Carolyn was born. Then in 1947 they moved to Madison, Wisconsin for five years, where he contracted polio at age 12 in 1949 in his back, left arm, and hand but was able to recover. They moved one last time, in 1952, to Wheat Ridge, Colorado, a suburb of Denver, when his father secured a job in Denver. They moved to Colorado partly because of the chronic bronchial problems that he suffered from in Madison, New Jersey around age 5 as an attempt to help alleviate those problems. He continued to suffer from asthma and allergy problems.Blevins, Tim. 'Film & Photography on the Front Range, p. 290. Pikes Peak Library District, 2012. . Accessed September 16, 2015. During his childhood, Adams often accompanied his father on walks and hikes through the woods on Sunday afternoons. He also enjoyed playing baseball in open fields and working with his father on carpentry projects. He was an active Boy Scout, and was also active with the Methodist church that his family attended. He and his father made several raft trips through Dinosaur National Monument, and during his adolescent years he worked at boys' camps at Rocky Mountain National Park in Colorado. He also took trips on pack horses and went mountain climbing. He and his sister began visiting Denver Art Museum. Adams also learned to like reading. In 1955, he hunted for the last time. Adams enrolled in the University of Colorado, Boulder in 1955, and attended it for his first year, but decided to transfer the next year to the University of Redlands in California where he received his B.A. in English in 1959. He continued his graduate studies at the University of Southern California and received his PhD in English in 1965. In 1960 while at Redlands, he met and married Kerstin Mornestam, a Swedish native, who shared the same interest in the arts and nature. Robert and Kerstin spent their first few summers together in Oregon along the coast, where they took long walks on the beach and spent their evenings reading.  Work  In 1963 they moved back to Colorado, and Adams began teaching English at Colorado College in Colorado Springs. In 1963, Adams bought a 35 mm camera and began to take pictures mostly of nature and architecture. He soon read complete sets of Camera Work and Aperture at the Colorado Springs Fine Arts Center. He learned photographic technique from Myron Wood, a professional photographer who lived in Colorado. While finishing his dissertation, he began to photograph in 1964. In 1966, he began to teach only part-time to have more time to photograph. He met John Szarkowski, the curator of photography at the Museum of Modern Art, on a trip to New York City in 1969. The museum later bought four of his prints. In 1970, he began working as a full-time photographer. Critic Sean O'Hagan, writing in The Guardian, said \\"his subject has been the American west: its vastness, its sparse beauty and its ecological fragility. [. . .] What he has photographed constantly ‚Äì in varying shades of grey ‚Äì is what has been lost and what remains\\" and that \\"his work's other great subtext\\" is silence.

It was co-developed by Industrial Light & Magic and Phil Tippett. Stop motion animation can create a disorienting, and distinctive staccato effect, because the animated object is perfectly sharp in every frame, since each frame of the animation was actually shot when the object was perfectly still. Real moving objects in similar scenes of the same movie will have motion blur, because they moved while the shutter of the camera was open. Filmmakers use a variety of techniques to simulate motion blur, such as moving the model slightly during the exposure of each film frame or using a glass plate smeared with petroleum jelly in front of the camera lens to blur the moving areas.  History  In the 1920s, Ladislas Starevich started using this technique by the time he started making films in France. He moved the puppet or the set during the exposure of the frame to create motion blur. Some of this can be seen in films like The Midnight Wedding, Love in Black and White, The Voice of the Nightingale or The Little Parade and more extensively in the battle scene of The Queen of the Butterflies (1924) and The Mascot (1933). Phil Tippett and Industrial Light & Magic later recreated the go motion technique for some shots of the tauntaun creatures and AT-AT walkers in the 1980 Star Wars film The Empire Strikes Back. After that, go motion was used for many other movies: for the dragon in Dragonslayer (1981), the dinosaurs in the prehistoric documentaries Prehistoric Beast (1984)Prehistoric Beast digital restoration, as published on April 6 2011 by the Phil Tippett Studio's official channel in Youtube and Dinosaur! (1985), the harpy sequence in Young Sherlock Holmes (1985),Harry Walton talks about working at ILM, and stop motion animating the Harpy sequence from Young Sherlock Holmes, in this deleted scene from Sense of Scale the lord demon creature in Howard the Duck (1986), the winged demon in The Golden Child (1986), the extraterrestrial living flying machines in Batteries Not Included (1987), the two-headed Eborsisk dragon in Willow (1988), Coneheads (1993). Other minor sequences using go motion appeared in films like the first three Indiana Jones installments (1981‚Äì1989) and E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial (1982) among a few others. In 1993, with the release of Jurassic Park, Tippett Studio abandoned go motion and fully converted its teams and equipment to CG computer- graphics.An insider interview with Phil Tippett The last film using go motion was Coneheads (Jurassic Park was released on June 11, 1993 but Coneheads was released on July 23, 1993). Methods for creating motion blur= Petroleum jelly = This crude but reasonably effective technique involves smearing petroleum jelly (\\"Vaseline\\") on a plate of glass in front of the camera lens, also known as vaselensing, then cleaning and reapplying it after each shot ‚Äî a time-consuming process, but one which creates a blur around the model. This technique was used for the endoskeleton in The Terminator. This process was also employed by Jim Danforth to blur the pterodactyl's wings in Hammer Films' When Dinosaurs Ruled the Earth, and by Randal William Cook on the terror dogs sequence in Ghostbusters. =Bumping the puppet= Gently bumping or flicking the puppet before taking the frame will produce a slight blur; however, care must be taken when doing this that the puppet does not move too much or that one does not bump or move props or set pieces. =Moving the table= Moving the table on which the model is standing while the film is being exposed creates a slight, realistic blur. This technique was developed by Ladislas Starevich: when the characters ran, he moved the set in the opposite direction. This is seen in The Little Parade when the ballerina is chased by the devil. Starevich also used this technique on his films The Eyes of the Dragon, The Magical Clock and The Mascot. Aardman Animations used this for the train chase in The Wrong Trousers and again during the lorry chase in A Close Shave. In both cases the cameras were moved physically during a 1-2 second exposure. The technique was revived for the full-length Wallace & Gromit: The Curse of the Were-Rabbit. =Go motion= The most sophisticated technique was originally developed for the film The Empire Strikes Back and used for some shots of the tauntauns and was later used on films like Dragonslayer and is quite different from traditional stop motion. The model is essentially a rod puppet. The rods are attached to motors which are linked to a computer that can record the movements as the model is traditionally animated. When enough movements have been made, the model is reset to its original position, the camera rolls and the model is moved across the table. Because the model is moving during shots, motion blur is created. A variation of go motion was used in E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial to partially animate the children on their bicycles. Go motion today Go motion was originally planned to be used extensively for the dinosaurs in Jurassic Park, until Steven Spielberg decided to try out the swiftly developing techniques of CG instead. Today, the mechanical method of achieving motion blur using go motion is rarely used, as it is more complicated, slow, and labor-intensive than computer generated effects. However, the motion blurring technique still has potential in real stop motion movies where the puppet's motions are supposed to be somewhat realistic. Many professional visual effects applications now allow for motion blur to be simulated in post production.

A cat hairball A hairball is a small collection of hair or fur formed in the stomach of animals, and uncommonly in humans, that is occasionally vomited up when it becomes too big. Hairballs are primarily a tight elongated cylinder of packed fur, but may include bits of other elements such as swallowed food. Animals with hairballs are sometimes mistaken as having other conditions of the stomach such as lymphosarcoma, tuberculosis, and tumor of the spleen. Cats are especially prone to hairball formation since they groom themselves by licking their fur, and thereby ingest it. Rabbits are also prone to hairballs because they groom themselves in the same fashion as cats, but hairballs are especially dangerous for rabbits because they cannot regurgitate them. Due to the digestive systems of rabbits being very fragile, hairballs in rabbits must be treated immediately or they may cause the animal to stop feeding and ultimately die due to dehydration. Cattle are also known to accumulate hairballs but, as they do not vomit, these are found usually after death and can be quite large. A cat hairball  Clinical significance  A trichobezoar is a bezoar (a mass found trapped in the gastrointestinal system) formed from the ingestion of hair. Trichobezoars are often associated with trichotillomania (compulsive hair pulling). Trichobezoars are rare, but can be fatal if undetected. Surgical intervention is often required.Dehghan A, Moaddab AH, Mozafarpour S. \\"An unusual localization of trichobezoar in the appendix.\\" Turk J Gastroenterol. 2011 Jun;22(3):357-8.  Society and culture  Although uncommon in humans, some hairballs have been reported. These hairballs occur when hair strands collect in the stomach and are unable to be ejected as a result of the friction on the surface of the gastric mucosa. Hairballs are often seen in young girls as a result of trichophagia, trichotillomania, and pica.Hairballs: Myths and Realities behind some Medical Curiosities , National Museum of Health and Medicine, Washington, D.C. In 2003, a 3-year-old girl in Red Deer, Alberta, Canada, had a grapefruit-sized hairball surgically removed from her stomach; in 2006, an 18-year-old woman from Chicago, Illinois, had a hairball surgically removed from her stomach; and in 2014, a 9-pound hairball was removed from the stomach of an 18-year-old in Kyrgyzstan.Dodds, Laurence. \\"Huge 9lb hairball removed from teenage girl's stomach.\\" The Telegraph.

Hairballs can be quite hazardous in humansGirl died from eating her hair, BBC News, 1999-08-20 since hair cannot be digested or passed by the human gastrointestinal system, and (assuming it is identified) even vomiting may be ineffective at removing the hair mass.

JAAS was introduced as an extension library to the Java Platform, Standard Edition 1.3 and was integrated in version 1.4. JAAS has as its main goal the separation of concerns of user authentication so that they may be managed independently. While the former authentication mechanism contained information about where the code originated from and who signed that code, JAAS adds a marker about who runs the code. By extending the verification vectors JAAS extends the security architecture for Java applications that require authentication and authorization modules.  Administration  For the system administrator, JAAS consists of two kinds of configuration file: *\`*.login.conf\`: specifies how to plug vendor-supplied login modules into particular applications *\`*.policy\`: specifies which identities (users or programs) are granted which permissions For example, an application may have this \`login.conf\` file indicating how different authentication mechanisms are to be run to authenticate the user: PetShopApplication { com.sun.security.auth.module.LdapLoginModule sufficient; com.foo.SmartcardLoginModule requisite; com.sun.security.auth.module.UnixLoginModule required debug=true; }  Application interface  For the application developer, JAAS is a standard library that provides: * a representation of identity (Principal) and a set of credentials (Subject) * a login service that will invoke your application callbacks to ask the user things like username and password. It returns a new Subject * a service that tests if a Subject was granted a permission by an administrator.  Security system integration  For the security system integrator, JAAS provides interfaces: * to provide your identity namespace to applications * to attach credentials to threads (Subject) * for developing login modules. Your module invokes callbacks to query the user, checks their response and generates a Subject.  Login Modules  Login modules are primarily concerned with authentication rather than authorization and form a widely used component of JAAS. A login module is required to implement the \`javax.security.auth.spi.LoginModule\` interface, which specifies the following methods: Note: A \`Subject\` is the user that is attempting to log in. *initialize: Code to initialize the login module, usually by storing the parameters passed into appropriate fields of the \`Class\`. *login: Actually check the credentials provided via an \`Object\` that implements the \`javax.security.auth.Callback\` interface (e.g. check against a database). This method could prompt the user for their login and password or it could use details previously obtained. It is important to note here that, if invalid credentials are supplied then a \`javax.security.auth.login.FailedLoginException\` should be thrown (rather than returning false, which indicates that this login module should be ignored, which potentially allows authentication to succeed). *commit: The identity of the subject has been verified, so code in this method sets up the \`Principal\` and \`Groups\` (roles) for the successfully authenticated subject. This method has to be written carefully in enterprise applications as Java EE application servers often expect the relationships between the \`Principal\` and \`Group\` objects to be set up in a certain way. This method should throw a \`javax.security.auth.login.FailedLoginException\` if authentication fails (e.g. a user has specified an incorrect login or password). *abort: Called if the authentication process itself fails. If this method returns false, then this Login Module is ignored. *logout: Code that should be executed upon logout (e.g. could remove the \`Principal\` from the \`Subject\` or could invalidate a web session). Login modules can provide single sign on (SSO) via a particular SSO protocol/framework (e.g. SAML, OpenID, and SPNEGO), can check for the presence of hardware security tokens (e.g. USB token), etc. In an n-tier application, \`LoginModules\` can be present on both the client side and server side. = LoginModule (\`javax.security.auth.spi.LoginModule\`) = Login modules are written by implementing this interface; they contain the actual code for authentication. It can use various mechanisms to authenticate user credentials. The code could retrieve a password from a database and compare it to the password supplied to the module. = LoginContext (\`javax.security.auth.login.LoginContext\`) = The login context is the core of the JAAS framework which kicks off the authentication process by creating a Subject. As the authentication process proceeds, the subject is populated with various principals and credentials for further processing. = Subject (\`javax.security.auth.Subject\`) = A subject represents a single user, entity or system ‚Äìin other words, a client‚Äì requesting authentication. = Principal (\`java.security.Principal\`) = A principal represents the face of a subject. It encapsulates features or properties of a subject. A subject can contain multiple principals. = Credentials = Credentials are nothing but pieces of information regarding the subject in consideration. They might be account numbers, passwords, certificates etc. As the credential represents some important information, the further interfaces might be useful for creating a proper and secure credential ‚Äì \`javax.security.auth.Destroyable\` and \`javax.security.auth.Refreshable\`. Suppose that after the successful authentication of the user you populate the subject with a secret ID (in the form of a credential) with which the subject can execute some critical services, but the credential should be removed after a specific time. In that case, one might want to implement the \`Destroyable\` interface. \`Refreshable\` might be useful if a credential has only a limited timespan in which it is valid.  Form Authentication  Form authentication is another commonly used part of JAAS. In this process the user is typically presented with a web page containing a form asking for a username and password. This data is then submitted via POST to a URL containing the text \`j_security_check\`, e.g. \`www.example.com/j_security_check\` . The credentials are checked on the server side and a session ID is returned to the client via a cookie. This authentication method is flexible in that a Java HTTP client such as Apache HTTP client can be used in place of a web-browser, e.g. in a desktop application, as long as the following standard steps are followed: * Request a protected URL (i.e. secured via a security-constraint element) in \`web.xml\` (where the login-config element has specified an authentication method of \\"FORM\\"). * The server will return a redirect (302) to the security check URL mentioned above along with a cookie containing the session ID (\`JSESSIONID=...\`). * Send the username and password (encoded as form fields) along with the cookie via an HTTP POST to the security check URL. * If authentication is successful, the server will send a 302 back to the original protected URL. * Send a GET request to that URL, passing the session ID cookie (preferably assert that the response contains what you would expect from that original URL). Additional assertions can be added to the above process.

It is used in a number of American Style ballroom dances: rumba, waltz, bronze-level foxtrot. While it can be performed individually, it is usually done with a partner. This is the most common dance step in the waltz. In international standard dance competition, there is a similar step called closed change. In a typical example, the leader begins with the left foot and proceeds as follows. *First half-box: forward-side-together *Second half-box: backwards-side-together Every step is with full weight transfer. Rhythm varies. For example, it is \\"1-2-3, 4-5-6\\" in waltz and \\"slow quick quick, slow quick quick\\" in rumba. In other dances (and in variations) the box may start from the left or right foot, either back or forward, or even sidewise. For example, in the figure of the leader steps (starting with the left foot) \\"left-together-back, right- together-forward\\".  In waltz  The leader starts with his feet closed. On beat 1 he steps forward with his right foot, then he steps to the side with his left foot on 2, closes his right to his left foot on 3; steps back with his left foot on 4, to the side with his right foot on 5, and closes his left to his right foot on 6. During the second and fifth step the foot is supposed to travel along two sides of the box, rather than along its diagonal. The follower also starts with her feet closed.

K≈çichi Mashimo directed Madlax and the soundtrack was composed by Yuki Kajiura. The DVD version was released by ADV Films in North America and the United Kingdom and by Madman Entertainment in Australia and New Zealand. The story revolves around the two young women Margaret and Madlax, who seemingly have little in common and do not know of the other's existence at the beginning. Madlax is a legendary mercenary and assassin in the fictional civil war-torn country of Gazth-Sonika, who cannot remember her past or indeed her real name before twelve years ago, when the war started. The other main character is Margaret Burton, the sole heir of a wealthy aristocratic family in the peaceful European country Nafrece. Twelve years before the story begins, an airliner Margaret and her mother were on crashed over Gazth-Sonika, and its passengers, as well as Margaret's father who led the rescuers, have been missing ever since. Margaret, however, mysteriously traveled back to Nafrece on her own, losing her memories prior to her return; the only thing she recalls is a single word, \\"Madlax\\". With this thread linking the two girls, they both independently start investigating the powerful crime syndicate Enfant after its enigmatic mastermind shows interest in both of them. Madlax was produced as a spiritual successor to the studio's earlier project, Noir, and together with El Cazador de la Bruja, these series constitute a trilogy exploring the \\"girls-with-guns\\" genre. The production of Madlax began in 2002 but it wasn't until Y≈çsuke Kuroda joined the project that the series took its final form. While the critics noted the resulting similarities between Noir and Madlax, they also acknowledged the differences, such as the latter's less episodic and more plot-driven style and, in particular contrast to the predominantly realistic Noir, incorporation of many supernatural elements, which the audience must often interpret without further explanation.  Plot  The first half of the series alternates between the two leads. Madlax is one of the most efficient special ops agents for hire in the war-torn Gazth-Sonika,Galza Lieutenant: \\"What'll be a big deal is when THAT one shows up. ... A super-skilled agent named Ma ...\\" while Margaret Burton is a sleepy, clumsy amnesiac living in Nafrece, a country styled after France. When a \\"picture book\\", presumably given to Margaret by her late father, attracts the attention of international criminal network Enfant, she discovers that the origins of the book lie in Gazth-Sonika. Enfant's top operative, Carrossea Doon, tracks Margaret down but tips off his superiors in the wrong direction, towards Madlax, who has been causing Enfant trouble for some time. Meanwhile, Vanessa Rene, Margaret's former tutor whose parents died because of Gazth-Sonikan war,Vanessa: \\"My father was a diplomat in Nafrece, you see, and at the time that the threat of civil war here was coming to a peak, he was in charge of relations with Gazth-Sonika. Then the civil war broke out, and my parents were detained by the Gazth-Sonika army under suspicion of inciting the war\\". discovers that her current employer, Bookwald Industries, covertly supports the war by supplying both sides with firearms and starts investigating its true cause. Her investigation brings her to Gazth-Sonika, where Madlax is hired as her bodyguard, and together, they uncover data that proves Enfant orchestrated the entire conflict. Enfant eventually intercepts them and they are forced into hiding. Back in Nafrece, Margaret decides to help Vanessa and travels to Gazth-Sonika, accompanied by her devoted and sometimes overprotective maid Elenore Baker and Carrossea Doon. Eventually, Madlax and Margaret meet and embark on a search for Quanzitta Marison, a Gazth-Sonikan mystic who supposedly knows about Margaret's book, Enfant's involvement with it, and Enfant itself. Lady Quanzitta does indeed tell them about Enfant and its plans to plunge the entire world into a total war, starting with Gazth-Sonika. She reveals that Enfant's leader Friday Monday possesses supernatural powers connected to the three ancient books, one of which belongs to Margaret. Margaret uses her own supernatural abilities and that of her book to return her lost memories. Carrossea, who has been aiding Margaret, requests that his memories be restored as well despite warnings not to do so; he discovers that he, in fact, died 12 years ago and held on to life only by sheer force of will to protect Margaret. Carrossea disappears, and Margaret is captured by Monday who intends to use her abilities to advance his own plans. Unable to shoot her father in self-defence, Margaret expelled her wish to survive from herself, creating Madlax, who pulled the trigger for her. Laetitia (originally her doll) was created to seal off the memory of this event, preventing the two from merging. While Margaret and Carrossea perform the ritual, Madlax is attacked by Limelda Jorg, a Gazth-Sonikan sniper who holds a grudge against Madlax ever since she failed to stop an assassination by Madlax earlier in the show. Limelda kills Vanessa while targeting Madlax, sending the latter into clinical depression. Elenore and Lady Quanzitta's servant Nakhl manage to restore Madlax's will to live and persuade her to save Margaret, and the three storm Enfant's headquarters together. During the assault, Elenore is killed and Margaret, now under Monday's control, shoots Madlax. Believing Madlax to be dead, Monday commences a ritual to unleash people's inhibitions and trigger worldwide anarchy; but Margaret's memories return and she snaps out of his mind control. Only now does the audience learn the back-story: back in 1999, Monday drove Margaret's father insane with his powers and she was forced to kill her own father. To escape the horrible truth of her patricide, Margaret split herself into three personae: the \\"memory keeper\\" Laetitia, the sinful Madlax, and the innocent Margaret herself. Margaret then fuses her three personae back together to undo the ritual she previously performed with Monday, saving the world from insanity. Madlax, who should no longer exist after the fusion, appears and guns down Monday. It becomes apparent that Margaret has once again split herself into three, judging that after twelve years, she no longer has the right to make decisions for her other personae. When everything is said and done, Margaret fully releases Madlax so she can live her life freely and also adopts Laetitia as her younger sister so she won't be alone. Madlax ultimately makes peace with Limelda and they travel together.  Themes  Madlax is set against the backdrop of Gazth-Sonikan war and the first episodes contrast the tranquil Nafrece with the war-torn Gazth-Sonika; later, the story moves completely to the combat zone, focusing on the central characters, such as Limelda Jorg, and their suffering. In an interview, the director Mashimo stated that \\"[t]he story is about portraying inner struggles of people, while showing what life is like in this place of madness and this other place of peace\\". Accordingly, the series' title is a portmanteau of two English words, \\"mad\\" and \\"relaxed\\", mirroring the authors' intention to portray the two extremes of human being. Madlax also plays as the story of Margaret Burton's search for her psychological identity. Based on the Mashimo Menu theme titles available to her, Yuki Kajiura has suggested an interpretation that while searching for her memories, Margaret meets the other characters (\\"Gatekeepers\\") one after another and learns about the lifestyles (\\"Gates\\") they represent. In the end, she finds her own \\"Gate\\", which is the new identity that finally replaces the one she lost twelve years ago.  Production = Writing = According to the director K≈çichi Mashimo, he envisioned Noir and Madlax as part of a trilogy exploring the girls-with-guns genre, and soon after the release of the latter, he confirmed having plans to produce the third installment, which would later become El Cazador de la Bruja. In late 2002, Mashimo invited Shigeru Kitayama, the producer of Noir who once came up with its original idea, to discuss a new series entitled Madlax. Kitayama greatly expanded Mashimo's original screenplay plan, but it was not until Y≈çsuke Kuroda was put in charge of the script that the series took its final appearance. It took Kuroda around one year to finish the screenplays for all 26 episodes, during which he was constantly encouraged by Mashimo to add his own original ideas to their initial plan. Kuroda has admitted that at the time he received Mashimo's invitation, he felt frustrated after his first project has been canceled by the publisher, so he decided to make Madlax \\"really extravagant\\", blending as many genres at once as he could. K≈çichi Mashimo, furthermore, admitted that the most unusual plot twists, like Margaret and Madlax's connection to each other, were invented by Kuroda and him while drunk. = Character design = By comparison with Noir, Madlax features a much larger primary cast, including multiple recurring male characters, an element nearly absent in the former. It was not so in the original screenplay draft written by Mashimo and Kitayama: for example, \\"Madlax\\" was Margaret's own nickname and Charlie (Vanessa's colleague at Bookwald Industries) had one of the central roles similar to Speedy's in Avenger. Only the \\"draft\\" characters' names remained of them when Kuroda has rewritten the script. A total of three character designers collaborated on Madlax cast: Satoshi Ohsawa (who also worked on Noir cast) created the central heroines Margaret and Madlax; Minako Shiba drew Friday Monday and Carrossea Doon; and Satoko Miyachi was entrusted with the \\"mysterious\\" characters, Laetitia and Poupee. = Music = As with many of studio Bee Train's other works, the entire Madlax soundtrack was composed by the acclaimed Yuki Kajiura, making it her and K≈çichi Mashimo's fifth project together. In an interview Kajiura recalls having written the score in a hotel high-rise to save studio costs, and that this change in location helped her to explore different styles of music. Kajiura and Yuuka Nanri's duo FictionJunction Yuuka recorded the series' opening and ending themes, and \\"Inside Your Heart\\", respectively, as well as two insert songs: \\"nowhere\\" and \\"I'm here\\". Aside from the opening sequence, \\"Fragments of an Eye\\" is featured in the series itself: at the end of episode 18 and in the episode 24, when Margaret is humming its tune to herself in the flower field. In the insert song \\"nowhere\\", there is a frequently repeated background refrain . It doesn't have any particular meaning but since the song usually plays when Madlax is fighting, \\"Yanmaani\\" has become something of a joke to Japanese fans, claiming that it apparently gives her superpowers.  Media = Television series = Originally, Madlax was broadcast in Japan by TV Tokyo from 5 April to 27 September 2004, from 1:30 to 2:00 a.m. every Tuesday (formally, Monday night). Shortly before the series finished airing, it has been licensed in North America and Europe by ADV Films, which has previously acquired distribution rights for Noir and has long had plans to license its successor, as well. The official English dub has been released in the United States under the trademark MADLAX on a total of seven DVDs from 12 April 2005 to 28 March 2006. A complete collection was released by ADV on 17 July 2007. Madlax has become the first series on which ADV Films' director and producer David Williams tested the technology of distributing promotional materials via P2P network BitTorrent. As of September 1, 2009, all the titles from ADV's catalog, including Madlax, were transferred to AEsir Holdings, with distribution from Section23 Films. The North-American DVD release contains extras available in English only, such the controversial self-parody Conversations with SSS and Sock Puppet Theater, an Easter egg live action about Madlax going after Chris Patton, Badgis' voice actor and an annoying womanizer. On 7 February 2006, the first episode of Madlax aired on Anime Network (which was, like ADV Films, a subsidiary of A.D. Vision at the time). On 4 April, shortly after the last DVD volume has been released, the consequent broadcast was put on halt and until 27 June, only the first 8 episodes were repeated. Since then, the series has been relaunched multiple times.Anime Network program lineup for 27 June, and 7 November 2006, retrieved on 2015-06-01. Madman Entertainment, who previously licensed Noir in its region, has acquired rights for distribution of Madlax in Australia and New Zealand and released it on seven DVD volumes between 20 July 2005 and 26 July 2006. A complete collection was released on 4 April 2007. = Soundtrack = The series' original soundtrack was released on two albums on 21 July and 22 September 2004 by Victor Entertainment. Two singles, Hitomi no Kakera and Inside Your Heart, were published in the same year by FictionJunction Yuuka, each containing an opening/ending theme and one insert song, as well as their respective karaoke versions. = Artbook = MADLAX the Bible is a 95-page artbook that was published in Japan on 21 May 2005 by Hobby Japan. Aside from illustrations and artworks for the series, it contains interviews with its authors and voice actors, as well as diverse additional information about the show in Japanese. The artbook has never been published outside Japan. Since the word \\"Bible\\" is derived from , meaning \\"holy books\\", it is likely that the artbook's title is a reference to the Holy Books that play an important role in the series' plot. = Merchandise = A resin model kit known as \\"Madlax with Guns\\" has been produced, featuring a figurine of Madlax dual wielding her signature SIG P210s. A polystone figurine entitled simply \\"Madlax\\", was launched in August 2007. In Japan, a T-shirt with Madlax logo has been added to the limited edition of the first DVD volume, and the \\"first press\\" of the OST albums came with logotype mousepads. = Light novel = A light novel spin-off of the series, titled , has been published on 1 June 2011 by Hobby Japan. Written by Seiya Fujiwara and illustrated by Shunsuke Tagami (neither of whom had been involved in the production of the original TV series), the book focuses on Elenore Baker as the main character in a setting somewhat different from that of the anime. In this continuity, Elenore is a combat-trained maid traveling across the war-torn Gazth-Sonika, looking for the lost Margaret and, along the way, helping the weary locals with their struggles.  Reception  Madlax was often accused of being secondary and reusing Noir stylistic solutions,Jonathan Clements, Helen McCarthy. The Anime Encyclopedia: A Guide to Japanese Animation Since 1917. Revised and Expanded Edition. ‚Äî Berkeley, CA: Stone Bridge Press, 2006. ‚Äî P. 388. ‚Äî such as the story premise, the two heroines' appearance, and the musical style. Nevertheless, some sources praised the story for being more monolithic and consequent than its predecessor's, owing to all its episodes and subplots being tightly intertwined and held together by the primary plot. The majority of reviewers perceived the early episodes of Madlax as boring and too slow-paced, but some of the same critics later remarked that the prolonged exposition is crucial to the unusual finale of the series, which fully establishes the series' own identity and sets it apart from other works. According to them, after the initial volume, the story gets better and better with every new episode, though some have been dissatisfied with its \\"pseudo- existentialistic\\" ending. Erica Friedman, the president of Yuricon, highly praised Kuroda's script, naming it \\"the best writing that Bee Train has done\\". Professional reviewers welcomed the increased number of sympathetic characters, especially the distinguishable male ones (Friday, Carrossea, Colonel Burton), as opposed to stormtrooper-like operatives of Soldats in Noir, but the female character designs were still said to be much more detailed (to the point of fanservice in the case of Madlax) than the more generic male characters. The high quality of the animation in Madlax was generally acknowledged. On the negative side, the episodes that involve computer use and hacking received criticism for their lack of realism. In terms of soundtrack, Madlax has not become as innovative as Noir, with critics suggesting its OST to be a blend of Noir and .hack//Sign styles. Nevertheless, the reviewers acknowledged its superiority over the majority of contemporary works. The English translation released by ADV Films was praised for preserving most of the series' original stylistic aspects and inviting veteran voice actors for the dub. Reviewers went as far as to suggest that several English voices (especially Mike Kleinhenz's) match the characters better than the Japanese ones. Others, however, criticized the dub, e.g. Carl Kimlinger of Anime News Network in his 2009 review of the series rated the performance as \\"wildly uneven, ranging from good ... to plain amateurish\\", citing \\"delivery issues\\" as main problem of the dub. The initial slow pacing, especially compared to the first episodes of Noir, became a main reason why the audience often dropped watching Madlax before it could present its later story turns which eventually resulted in the moderate success of the series. Among other suggested reasons behind the mediocre popularity of the show were: the market saturation, which resulted from other anime series attempting to repeat the success of Noir since 2001; the expectable disinterest against a \\"Noir remake\\", found among the fans of the first series; the over-the-top action scenes that some felt to be ridiculous; and its unconventional genre, which straddled Madlax uncomfortably between fans of mystical science fiction and those who prefer Noir strict realism.
