The island is offshore from Cheynes Beach and is a protected area managed by the Department of Parks and Wildlife. The island is a World Conservation Union Category IA nature reserve. (A Class A Nature Reserve, No 25869, managed by Parks and Wildlife was created in 1964.) With an area of the island is one of the largest off the South Coast. Composed almost entirely of granite the island rises steeply from the ocean to a maximum height of . The island was isolated around 10,000 years ago by rising sea levels.  Flora  The island contains 104 species of plants. Large stands of peppermint trees (Agonis flexuosa) are found on the sheltered upper slopes of the island, while forested stretches of Rottnest Island teatree (Melaleuca lanceolata) grow on the lower slopes. The Bald Island marlock (Eucalyptus conferruminata) forms dense thickets on parts of the island. More exposed areas are covered by open heath and tussock species, as well as closed shrubby patches mostly comprising Melaleuca microphylla.  Fauna  The island supports a good population of reptiles - four skinks and one gecko. One of the species of skink, Ctenotus labillardieri, has evolved into a distinctive insular race on the island. There are no snakes on the island. Marine mammals such as New Zealand fur seals and Australian sea lions inhabit Bald Island. There are a few mainland mammals including the quokka, and a population of Gilbert's potoroo is also being established. The island forms part of the Two Peoples Bay and Mount Manypeaks Important Bird Area, identified as such by BirdLife International because of its significance in the conservation of several rare and threatened bird species.BirdLife International. (2011). Important Bird Areas factsheet: Two Peoples Bay and Mount Manypeaks. Downloaded from on 18 November 2011. It acts as an important breeding ground for great-winged petrels and little penguins. =Translocations= Due to the island's location and lack of easy landing places on the shoreline, it's in almost pristine condition. The island was chosen in August 2005 as a site for the translocation of a Gilbert's potoroo population from the Two Peoples Bay Nature Reserve. More of the rare species were sent in 2007 to bring the total population to seven. The island was chosen due to its lack of predators such as cats, foxes and snakes. Another endangered species translocated to Bald Island is the noisy scrub-bird. In 1992 five males were taken from the Two Peoples Bay area and taken to Bald Island. In 1993 the area was surveyed to show that at least two had survived. In 1993 another three males and three females have been relocated to Bald Island. The estimated population of calling male birds on Bald Island in 2004 is 59 individuals.

The company was incorporated in 1958 in Parsons, West Virginia as an outgrowth of the local weekly newspaper, the Parsons Advocate. History In 1943, Ken and Faith Reynolds McClain had bought the Parsons Advocate which had been founded in 1896. Mr. McClain was approached around 1957 by West Virginia University professors who feared that early local West Virginia histories would be lost if they were not reprinted. In 1958, the newspaper undertook the reprinting of Alexander Scott Withers‚Äô classic history, Chronicles of Border Warfare, as its first venture in book publishing. When McClain retired in the early 1970s, his son-in-law and daughter, George and Mariwyn Smith, moved to Parsons. George took over the printing company and Mariwyn the newspaper. When George Smith retired in 1997, son Kenneth E. Smith became the third generation to operate the company. In its first 35 years of existence, the MPC produced comprehensive county histories of over 35 West Virginia counties, as well as thousands of other titles. These included the works of West Virginia poet laureate Louise McNeill, folklorists such as Ruth Ann Musick and James Gay Jones, bestselling volumes such as Howard B. Lee‚Äôs Bloodletting in Appalachia and Roy B. Clarkson‚Äôs Tumult on the Mountains, and reprints of classic local histories by W.C. Dodrill, Wills DeHass, Hu Maxwell, and others. Commercial printing was added as a service several years ago. Today, the MPC pursues offset printing, a book binding service, a typesetting service, and magazine and book publishing and printing. Much of their printing services consist of commercial printing such as pamphlets, catalogs, pocket folders, magazines, post cards, brochures, flyers, etc. Although MPC does occasionally still finance historical books or reprints, it is now predominantly a private book publisher. It does not take profits from any of its author's book sales as ‚Äúvanity presses‚Äù do. MPC products may be found on offer throughout the United States. Annual sales for the MPC are in the range of $1 million to $2.5 million.

Hansen became one of the few westerners to walk across the island. He did so largely with the aid of local Penan, who took him away from the rivers, the most used transportation routes in Borneo, to walk through the jungle. The journey started in Marudi in Sarawak, Malaysia, at the northwest coast of the island. When, after an illegal border-crossing, he eventually emerged near the east coast in Kalimantan, Indonesia, the confrontation with western civilisation gave him such a culture shock that he turned around for another crossing of the island. Summary =Preparation= Hansen had spent many years preparing for the journey, through research at the University of California, which also had a complete collection of the Sarawak Museum Journals from 1912 onwards. His aim was to cross the island, following old trade routes, collecting jungle products and medicinal plants of value, and exchanging these and western goods for what he needed. This was based on what he had learned during a visit six years earlier. But when he arrived it turned out he was completely unprepared and his source had not been to the highlands. The reason there were no passport checks there was that it was almost impossible to move through that uninhabited, wild, jungle-clad country. He had also learned Malay, which helped him a lot. There were many languages spoken in Borneo, but it turned out that a version of Malay called 'bahasa pasar' (a lingua franca) was spoken throughout the interior. He flew across Borneo several times to familiarise himself with the landscape. He had also taken along seemingly very detailed British military survey maps. But these turned out to be far too outdated and inaccurate. The few Malay, Indonesian, English and Dutch surveyors who had managed to reach the centre of the island had never agreed on their findings. :Dr A. W. Nieuwenhuis, two associates and 110 porters and bodyguards had preceded me to succeed in crossing the island, but that had been in 1897, and it had taken them a year. Certainly some local people and perhaps even some westerners have crossed the island. There are many stories, but the point of my trip was not to be the first, or the fastest, or the straightest. The challenge was to do it alone, to make myself completely vulnerable, and to be changed by the environment. However, he could only carry enough food for 3 or 4 weeks, and he figured he needed 3 months for the crossing. So he had to take along tradable items to exchange for food and whatever else he would need on the way. =First crossing= For the first eight weeks Hansen made several attempts, going up one river after another, which drained his budget and for which he took along all the wrong trade-items, such as 10 kg of salt, which he ended up giving to a hotel owner, who sympathised with him because he had already seen many westerners try to go so far upriver and failed. In the end, it turned out the best trade item was shotgun shells, of which he took along 250 rounds. These, he gave to his Penan guides. These Penan still used blowpipes, but also had self-made guns, made out of reinforced water pipe, umbrella springs, bicycle inner tubes, metal from flattened oil drums, nails, nuts and bolts and hand-carved hardwood stocks and grips. He gave one shell per day of traveling, which were used instantly and also provided him with the food he couldn't carry. Other good trade items were tobacco and, strangely, beads, the sort of thing one would expect ignorant missionaries to take along. It turned out beads have long been a form of currency in Borneo. When he finally entered the rainforest proper, cool and dark, with his two guides, he would not see the sun for 4 weeks. The only food they took along was rice and tea leaves. His diet consisted of, among other things, bee larvae, rice soup, roasted rattan shoots, boa constrictors, lizards, monkeys, bats and the large animals - pigs and deer. He never got sick. However, some small cuts developed into festering wounds in ten days time and later in the journey he got bitten by a dog and that wound would also cripple him. \\"Falling branches and trees and a fuzzy red caterpillar are the most dangerous things in the jungle.\\" He also had to adapt to a completely different culture. For example, the Penan could understand theft, but rape, mugging, suicide and murder were completely foreign to their way of living. When he asked what would be considered a serious crime in the Penan community, he was told that would be see-hun, meaning being stingy or not to share. He was met with disbelief when he told that in the US there are no laws against stinginess and that hoarding for oneself is even esteemed and rewarded. Measurements were also quite different. For example, he was regularly frustrated by not getting a clear answer to how far a certain destination was. He thought about miles and hours, but they thought in terms of hunting, mood and need. 'Not too far away' could mean a five-day walk through difficult terrain to a friendly village where they could buy tobacco, while 'a long journey' could turn out to be a four-hour walk through in the hated sunlight through flat farmland. So when he surprised his guides by asking where they wanted to go, they decided to go west, to an area where they had never been before, despite the final destination being eastward. When he finally arrived in Long Bia, near the east coast, 137 days after entering the rainforest, he was greeted in a very unfriendly manner by a Mission Aviation Fellowship (MAF) pilot named Ian, and when he checked into a hotel and looked into the mirror he noticed he had \\"a penetrating half-mad look to [his] eyes, a look of such unblinking intensity that immediately [he] realised why Ian hadn't been eager to invite [him] into his house.\\" When he went further downriver, for what he thought would be the last day, he was shocked to see the river all muddy from logging and the bare shores, motorised longboats and locals in western T-shirts. He also worried about how he would deal with the police, having an expired passport and no visa. But the sores on his feet were erupting again and he wanted to go to a hospital. \\"I was exhausted, depressed and half-crippled. The jungle had just spat me out like a piece of old chewing gum. And what were my chances of making it through another 800 miles of jungle in my condition? I could be back in San Francisco in a week, and the temptation to go was great. Get on a plane, I tried to convince myself. Don't be a fool!\\" Yet, just a day from reaching the coast, he decided to turn back. =Second crossing= After taking 10 days to let his wounds heal in Long Bia, he set off for the return trip. Confident that he had learned enough by the first crossing, he decided to test himself by taking a more difficult and uncertain route, through the central Kenyah highlands. Getting there would have to be done by plane, to avoid the notoriously dangerous rapids on the Kayan River. He earned this trip on the MAF plane by repairing it (taking it completely apart), despite having no knowledge of airplanes. What he didn't know was that a rumour was going around about an evil spirit wandering around, and he was regularly taken for this spirit, especially when he entered Dayak villages alone at night. Dayaks never travel through the forest at night, and most certainly not alone, and on top of that his looks fit the description rather too well, which led to some harrowing moments when he had to explain his unlikely appearance at spearpoint. Reception Stranger in the Forest was ranked #50 in National Geographic Adventure's \\"100 Greatest Adventure Books of All Time\\" (2004). It was also included in National Geographic Traveler's \\"Ultimate Travel Library\\" (2008), and the \\"Penguin Travel Library\\" series. The book was reviewed in the New York Times (1988) by Deborah Stead who said \\"Stranger in the Forest is a gracefully written and passionate book that is full of such unexpected delights. It is an account of a strange world made palpable, written with disarming modesty and rare sensitivity.\\" Jack Mathews writing in the Los Angeles Times (1988) criticized Hansen for going native and hunting local wildlife, \\"A few more fascinated visitors like him and the jungles of Borneo won't be quite so fascinating, to Hansen or anyone else.\\" Editions Source: * First edition. *1990 audiobook produced by Recorded Books narrated by Richard Poe. *1994 audiobook produced by Hear A Book narrated by Eric Dawson. *Foreign-language editions include Chinese, Italian, French, Spanish, Dutch.

This website was for use by both individuals and healthcare professionals, and in June 2010, it expanded its services beyond the United States to include the United Kingdom. On April 5, 2019, Microsoft announced that effective November 20, 2019, HealthVault would be closed, any data left in user accounts would be deleted, and any apps dependent on HealthVault for data would also stop working. \\"Microsoft is suggesting users who want to transfer or export their data to another personal health record provider contact Get Real Health (U.S. and international customers) and/or FollowMyHealth (U.S. customers only).\\"  Components  A HealthVault record stored an individual's health information. Access to a record was through a HealthVault account, which may have been authorized to access records for multiple individuals, e.g., so that a parent could manage records for their children, or a child could access their parent's records to help the parent deal with medical issues. Authorization of the account could initially be performed with the use of a Facebook account, Windows Live ID account, or an account from a limited set of other OpenID providers, but on April 6, 2016, Microsoft announced via email to users that Facebook and OpenID sign-in would not be available after 31 May 2016. After this time, when attempting to log in using these methods, a page indicating they were no longer supported was displayed.  Authorization  An individual interacted with their HealthVault record through either the HealthVault website or, more typically, through an app, application, or device that communicated with the HealthVault platform. When an individual first used a HealthVault application, they were asked to authorize the application to access a specific set of data types, and those data types were the only ones the application could use. An individual could also share either their entire health record or selected data with another interested individual, such as a doctor, relative, etc.  Devices  HealthVault Connection Center allowed health and fitness data to be exchanged between selected devices (such as blood pressure monitors, heart rate watches, and the Withings WiFi bodyscale) into an individual's HealthVault record. It was also usable to find and download drivers for medical devices. Additionally, in 2014, Microsoft introduced the Microsoft Band, a fitness band powered by the Microsoft Health service that supported the Microsoft HealthVault for aggregation and integration of various services, such as MyFitnessPal. Medical imaging HealthVault supported storage, viewing, uploading, and downloading, by consumers and third parties, of DICOM based medical imaging. Additionally, a plethora of third party HealthVault medical imaging viewers had been released to connect to HealthVault.  Interoperability  HealthVault supported a number of exchange formats, including industry standards such as the Continuity of Care Document and the Continuity of Care Record. Support for industry standards made it possible to integrate with many personal health record solutions.

He became the first former U.S. Army officer to be captured in Confederate service in 1861 and was killed in action near the end of the war. Early life and career John Pegram was born in Petersburg, Virginia, the oldest son of third generation planter James West Pegram and Virginia Johnson Pegram. His grandfather and namesake, John Pegram, had been a major general, commanding all Virginia forces during the War of 1812. His father, James Pegram, was a prominent attorney, militia brigadier general, and bank president in Richmond. However, in October 1844, James Pegram was killed in a steamboat accident on the Ohio River, leaving a widow, who had to open a girls' school to support her five children. One of John Pegram's younger brothers was the future Confederate artillerist William Ransom Johnson Pegram. His great grandmother's half-brother was North Carolina senator Nathaniel Macon. Pegram was appointed to the United States Military Academy in 1850. He graduated four years later, ranking tenth in his class, which also included future generals J.E.B. Stuart, Stephen D. Lee and Oliver O. Howard. Pegram was commissioned as a second lieutenant and assigned to the dragoons. He served at a variety of garrisons and outposts in the West. In January 1857, he was appointed Assistant Instructor of Cavalry at West Point. Pegram was granted a leave of absence in 1858‚Äì59 to travel to Europe to observe the Austro-Sardinian War. Returning home, he was assigned in 1860 to duty on the frontier in the New Mexico Territory. Civil War In May 1861, when news arrived that his native Virginia had seceded, Pegram resigned his lieutenant's commission and returned home. In early July 1861, he accepted a commission as a lieutenant colonel and was assigned command of the 20th Virginia Infantry. His regiment was part of the brigade of Brig. Gen. Robert S. Garnett and served in western Virginia fighting Union troops under Maj. Gen. George B. McClellan. On July 11, 1861, cut off from Garnett's main body during the Battle of Rich Mountain, Pegram controversially surrendered his entire regiment to the Federals. Thus John Pegram became the first former U.S. Army officer to be captured while in Confederate service.Laidig essay. His men were paroled, but Pegram was imprisoned for six months in Fort Warren in Boston harbor. In January 1862, Pegram was paroled in Baltimore, Maryland, and allowed to travel to Richmond while awaiting a formal exchange for a captive Union officer. There, he met prominent socialite Hetty Cary, who became his fiance√©. When finally exchanged, Pegram was promoted to colonel and became the Chief Engineer of the army of General Pierre G. T. Beauregard and then to Braxton Bragg. Within a short time, he was assigned as Chief of Staff for Maj. Gen. Edmund Kirby Smith and served in the Kentucky Campaign. Pegram was promoted to brigadier general in November 1862 and given command of a cavalry brigade. His performance before the Battle of Stones River in December was criticized by his superiors for failing to provide proper intelligence on enemy movements. In March 1863, he led an ill-fated raid into Kentucky that was defeated at the Battle of Somerset and drew criticism from his subordinate officers, including John Hunt Morgan.Official Records, Series 1, vol 23, Part 1 (Tullahoma Campaign), p. 314. He remained in command, however, and was ordered to report to the Army of Northern Virginia in October after he requested reassignment back to the Eastern Theater. However, before leaving, Pegram and his division fought under Nathan Bedford Forrest at the Battle of Chickamauga. 150px Pegram was given command of a veteran Virginia infantry brigade in the division of Jubal A. Early. In May, Pegram was wounded at the Battle of the Wilderness and went home to recuperate. Returning to field duty that fall, he served with distinction during Early's independent Valley Campaign as a division commander. Following the disastrous Battle of Cedar Creek, Early's survivors, including Pegram, returned to the Army of Northern Virginia in the Petersburg trenches. On January 19, 1865, Pegram married Hetty Cary in a well-attended ceremony in St. Paul's Church in Richmond. Among the celebrants was Confederate President Jefferson Davis and his wife, Varina. Less than three weeks later, Pegram was killed in action during the Battle of Hatcher's Run. His funeral was held in the same church where he had recently been married, with many of the same attendees. His younger brother William would be killed in some of the war's last fighting at the Battle of Five Forks in April. Pegram was buried in Richmond's Hollywood Cemetery. In fiction In MacKinlay Kantor's 1961 alternate history book \\"If the South Had Won the Civil War\\", Pegram appears as one of several prominent people who would have campaigned for the Abolition of Slavery in an independent Confederacy and eventually achieved it by 1885.

The tidewater glacier cycle is the typically centuries-long behavior of tidewater glaciers that consists of recurring periods of advance alternating with rapid retreat and punctuated by periods of stability. During portions of its cycle, a tidewater glacier is relatively insensitive to climate change. Calving rate of tidewater glaciers calving from several tidewater glaciers, Cape York, Greenland While climate is the main factor affecting the behavior of all glaciers, additional factors affect calving (iceberg-producing) tidewater glaciers. These glaciers terminate abruptly at the ocean interface, with large pieces of the glacier fracturing and separating, or calving, from the ice front as icebergs. Climate change causes a shift in the equilibrium line altitude (ELA) of a glacier. This is the imaginary line on a glacier, above which snow accumulates faster than it ablates, and below which, the reverse is the case. This altitude shift, in turn, prompts a retreat or advance of the terminus toward a new steady-state position. However, this change in terminus behavior for calving glaciers is also a function of resulting changes in fjord geometry, and calving rate at the glacier terminus as it changes position. Calving glaciers are different from land terminating glaciers in the variation in velocity along their length. Land terminating glacier velocities decline as the terminus is approached. Calving glaciers accelerate at the terminus. A declining velocity near the terminus slows the glacier response to climate. An accelerating velocity at the front enhances the speed of the glaciers response to climate or glacier dynamic changes. This is observed in Svalbard, Patagonia and Alaska. A calving glacier requires more accumulation area than a land terminating glacier to offset this higher loss from calving. The calving rate is largely controlled by the depth of the water and the glacier velocity at the calving front. The process of calving provides an imbalance in forces at the front of the glaciers, that raises velocity. The depth of the water at the glacier front is a simple measure that allows estimation of calving rate, but is the amount of flotation of the glacier at the front that is the specific physical characteristic that is important. Water depth at the glacier terminus is the key variable in predicting calving of a tidewater glacier. Debris flux and sediment recycling at the glacier grounding-line, particularly rapid in the temperate glaciers of Alaska, can alter this depth, acting as a second- order control on terminus fluctuations. This effect contributes to the insensitivity of a glacier to climate when its terminus is either retreating or advancing in deep water. Austin Post was one of the first to propose that water depth at the calving margin strongly affects the rate of iceberg calving. Glaciers that terminate on a morainal shoal are generally stable, but once a glacier retreats into water that deepens as the ice front recedes, calving rate increases rapidly and results in drastic retreat of the terminus. Using data collected from 13 Alaskan tidewater calving glaciers, Brown et al. (1982) derived the following relationship between calving speed and water depth: V_C = CH_w + D, where V_C is the mean calving speed (m‚ãÖa‚àí1), C is a calving coefficient (27.1¬±2 a‚àí1), H_w is the mean water depth at glacier front (m) and D is a constant (0 m‚ãÖa‚àí1). Pelto and Warren (1991) found a similar calving relationship with tidewater glaciers observed over longer time periods, with slightly reduced calving rate to the mainly summer rates noted by Brown et al. (1982). Calving is an important form of ablation for glaciers that terminate in freshwater, also. Funk and R√∂thlisberger determined a relationship between calving speed and water depth based on analysis of six glaciers that calve into lakes. They found that the same basic calving relationship developed for tidewater calving glaciers was true for freshwater calving glaciers, only the calving coefficients lead to calving rates 10% of that for tidewater glaciers. Tidewater glacier phases Observations of Alaskan tidewater calving glaciers prompted Austin Post to describe the tidewater calving glacier advance/retreat cycle: (1) advancing, (2) stable- extended, (3) drastically retreating, or (4) stable-retracted. The following is a detailed review of the tidewater glacier cycle derived by Post, with numerous cited examples, the cycle is based on observations of temperate tidewater glaciers in Alaska, not outlet glaciers from large ice sheets or polar glaciers. The accumulation area ratio of a glacier, AAR, is the percentage of a glacier that is a snow-covered accumulation zone at the end of the summer melt season. This percentage for large Alaskan glaciers is between 60 and 70 for non-calving glaciers, 70-80 for moderately calving glaciers and up to 90 for very high calving rate glaciers. By using accumulation area ratio (AAR) data for Alaskan tidewater calving glaciers, Pelto (1987) and Viens (1995) produced models showing that climate acts as a first-order control on the advance/retreat cycle of calving glaciers during most of the advance retreat cycle, but there are climate insensitive periods as well. Pelto (1987) examined the terminus behavior of 90 Alaskan glaciers and found that the terminus behavior of all 90 were correctly predicted based on the AAR and calving rate. =Advancing= The Hubbard Glacier If we begin at the stable retracted position at the end of a tidewater glacier cycle the glacier will have a moderate calving rate and a high AAR, above 70. The glacier will build a terminus shoal of sediment further reducing the calving rate. This will improve the glacier mass balance and the glacier can begin to advance due to this change or an increase in ice flux to the terminus due to increasing snowfall or reduced snow melt. As the advance proceeds the terminus shoal will be pushed in front of the glacier and continue to build, keeping the calving rate low. In the case of the most glaciers such as the Taku Glacier the glacier will eventually build a terminus shoal that is above water and calving will essentially cease. This will eliminate this loss of ice from the glacier and the glacier can continue to advance. Taku Glacier and Hubbard Glacier have been in this phase of the cycle. Taku Glacier which has been advancing for 120 years no longer calves. Hubbard Glacier still has a calving front. The glacier will then expand until the AAR is between 60 and 70 and equilibrium of the non-calving glacier is achieved. The glacier is not very sensitive to climate during the advance as its AAR is quite high, when the terminus shoal is limiting calving. =Stable-extended= At the maximum extended position the glacier is once again sensitive to changing climate. Brady Glacier and Baird Glacier are examples of glaciers currently at this point. Brady Glacier has been thinning during the last two decades due to the higher equilibrium line altitudes accompanying warmer conditions in the region, and its secondary termini have begun to retreat. A glacier can remain at this position for sometime, a century at least in the case of Brady Glacier. Usually substantial thinning occurs before retreat from the shoal commences. This allowed the prediction in 1980, by the United States Geological Survey (USGS), of the retreat of the Columbia Glacier from its terminus shoal. The glacier had remained on this shoal throughout the entire 20th century. The USGS was monitoring the glacier due to its proximity to Valdez, Alaska, the port for crude oil export from the Alaskan Pipeline. At some point a decline in mass balance will trigger a retreat from the shoal into deeper water at which point calving will ensue. Based on the recent thinning it is suggested that Brady Glacier is poised to begin retreat. =Drastically retreating= Columbia Glacier in 2004 The calving rate will increase as the glacier retreats from the shoal into the deeper fjord just cleared by the glacier during advance. The water depth initially increases as the glacier retreats from the shoal, causing every more rapid glacier flow, calving and retreat. A glacier is comparatively insensitive to climate during this calving retreat. However, in the case of San Rafael Glacier, Chile, a switch from retreat (1945‚Äì1990) to advance (1990‚Äì1997) was noted. Current examples of this retreat are Columbia Glacier and Guyot Glacier. The most famous recent example of this is the large retreat of Glacier Bay and Icy Bay glaciers in Alaska that occurred rapidly via this process. Muir Glacier retreated 33 km from 1886 to 1968 featuring extensive calving the entire time. It reversed its retreat briefly 1890--1892. In 1968, Muir Glacier was still 27 km long, less than half of its length in 1886. The retreat continued an additional 6.5 km by 2001. Today, the glacier is near the head of its fjord and with minimal calving the glacier may be stable at this retracted position. The best current example is illustrated by the United States Geological Survey study of Columbia Glacier. They noted that the average calving rate from Columbia Glacier increased from 3 km3‚ãÖa‚àí1 in the second half of 1983 to 4 km3‚ãÖa‚àí1 during the first nine months of 1984. This rate was four times greater than that measured at the end of 1977 and increased again in 1985. The glacier flow, i.e., the movement of the ice toward the sea, also increased, it was inadequate to keep pace with the break- up and expulsion of icebergs. The increase in speed instead seemed to just feed the ever faster conveyor to the terminus for iceberg production. This prompted the USGS to predict that the glacier would retreat 32 km before stabilizing. By 2006, it has retreated 16 km. The water remains deep and the calving rate and glacier velocity very high, indicating retreat will continue. At this point, just like having a balloon payment in an adjustable rate mortgage, the glacier has to pay a whole new portion of its balance via icebergs. The glacier accelerates as flow is enhanced by the calving process; this increases the export of icebergs from the glacier. Large calving retreats are initiated by warming conditions causing ice thinning. The resulting retreat to a new equilibrium conditions can be far more extensive than will be regained during the next advance stage. A good example of this is Muir Glacier. Next to Glacier Bay, Icy Bay has had the most extensive retreat. At the beginning of the 20th century, the coastline was nearly straight and the bay non-existent. The entrance of the bay was filled by a tidewater glacier face that calved icebergs directly into the Gulf of Alaska. A century later glacier retreat has opened a multi-armed bay more than 30 miles long. The tidewater glacier has divided into three independent glaciers, Yahtse, Tsaa and Guyot Glacier. Other examples of glaciers currently in the retreat phase are South Sawyer and Sawyer Glaciers in Alaska, retreating 2.1 and 2.3 km respectively from 1961 to 2005. In Patagonia an example of a rapidly retreating glacier is the Jorge Montt Glacier which drains into Baja Jorge Montt in the Pacific Ocean. The glacier's ice thinning, at low elevations, from 1975 to 2000 reached 18 m‚ãÖa‚àí1 at the lowest elevations. The glacier calving front experienced a major retreat of 8.5 km in those 25 years as a result of rapid thinning . =Stable-retracted= At some point the glacier reaches a pinning point where calving is reduced due to a fjord narrowing or shoaling and the glacier's AAR is near 100. This is occurring with LeConte Glacier and Yathse Glacier. Le Conte Glacier currently has an AAR of 90, is at a retracted position and seems likely to be set to advance after building a terminus shoal. The drop in calving rate allows the glacier to reestablish equilibrium. Examples of tidewater glacier behavior =Taku Glacier= The Taku Glacier provides a good example of this cycle. It was at its maximum extent near 1750. At this point it had closed off Taku Inlet. Subsequently, calving retreat commenced. By the time John Muir saw the glacier in 1890, it was near its minimum extent, at a location where the fjord narrowed, with deep water in front. About 1900, its AAR of 90 led to the Taku Glacier onset of advance, at the same time that the remaining Juneau Icefield glaciers continued receding. This advance continued at a rate of 88 m‚ãÖa‚àí1, advancing 5.3 km from the 1900 minimum until 1948, all the while building and then riding up on a substantial outwash plain beneath its calving face. After 1948, the now non-calving Taku Glacier, possessed an AAR only slightly reduced (86 and 63). This drove 1.5 km of further advance at a reduced rate of 37 m‚ãÖa‚àí1. In 1990, the Taku Glacier's AAR was 82 high enough, to prompt Pelto and Miller to conclude that the Taku Glacier would continue to advance for the remaining decade of the 20th century. From 1986 to 2005, the equilibrium line altitude on the glacier rose without a significant terminus shift causing the AAR to decline to about 72. Pelto and Miller concluded that the current reduction in rate of advance is since 1970 is attributable to the laterally expanding terminal lobe as opposed to declining mass balance and that the primary force behind the Taku Glacier's advance since about 1900 is due to positive mass balance. The recent lack of positive mass balance will eventually slow the retreat if it persists. Effects of climate change The size of tidewater glaciers is such that the tidewater glacier cycle is several hundred years in length. A tidewater glacier is not sensitive to climate during the advancing and drastically retreating phases of its cycle. In the same region, disparate terminus responses are observed amongst tidewater calving glaciers, but not land terminating glaciers. This is exemplified by the 17 major glaciers of the Juneau Icefield, 5 have retreated more than 500 m since 1948, 11 more than 1000 m, and one glacier the Taku has advanced. This difference highlights the unique impacts on terminus behavior of the tidewater glacier cycle, which has caused the Taku Glacier to be insensitive to climate change in the last 60 years. Concurrently, in both Patagonia and Alaska, there are tidewater glaciers that have advanced for a considerable period, tidewater glaciers undergoing rapid retreat and stable tidewater glaciers.

Through his family trust Eleonora Sport Ltd he was the owner and chairman of the English club Leeds United. He currently owns Brescia Calcio. Career =Cagliari Calcio= Cellino was the chairman of the Italian association football club Cagliari Calcio. He has served as vice-president for Serie A in the Lega Calcio. During his years as owner of Cagliari Calcio, Cellino was instrumental in the building of their sports centre in Assemini, near Cagliari, named after his father Ercole. Diego L√≥pez was sacked by Cellino as Cagliari manager on 6 April 2014, this being the 36th manager change he went through in 22 years of his tenure at Cagliari Calcio. Cellino earned the nickname Il mangia-allenatori, \\"The Manager Eater\\". Cellino intended to sell Cagliari Calcio, and has said that an agreed sale failed due to the wish of the prospective buyers for him to stay and run the club. He finally sold the club to the Italian entrepreneur Tommaso Giulini in June 2014 after 22 years of ownership. =Leeds United= In January 2014, speculation grew that Leeds would be subject to takeover by Cellino. A delegation representing Cellino was seen at Elland Road, Leeds' stadium, and the Thorp Arch training ground several times, and on 28 January it was reported that Cellino had asked for his associate and former Middlesbrough defender Gianluca Festa to sit in the dugout for Leeds' 1‚Äì1 draw with Ipswich. Cellino had previously tried to buy West Ham United in 2010. On 31 January 2014, it was reported that Brian McDermott had been sacked as manager of the club, with Gianluca Festa speculated in the media as his most likely replacement. The following day reports emerged suggesting Gulf Finance House (GFH) club directors were attempting to reinstate McDermott as manager, saying the Cellino family (the club's prospective new owners) had no authority to dismiss him. On 1 February, McDermott's Elland Road assistant Nigel Gibbs was named as caretaker manager for the club's home derby against Huddersfield Town. Following the game, the club released an official statement stating McDermott had not been dismissed and remained first team manager. After weeks of speculation the club announced, on 7 February 2014, that they had exchanged contracts with Cellino's family consortium Eleonora Sport Ltd. The deal would see the Cellino family acquire 75% ownership of the club, subject to approval from the Football League. The Football League rejected the proposal on 24 March 2014, stating that Cellino failed the owner's test. Cellino exercised his right to appeal the Football Leagues's decision. His appeal was heard on 31 March 2014 by an independent QC and, on 5 April 2014, the decision was overturned as Cellino's recent conviction did not involve conduct that would 'reasonably be considered to be dishonest' based on information available to him at the time. GFH retained a 10 per cent stake in the club, with minority shareholders holding 25 per cent. Cellino later said that had he known that the takeover would not proceed smoothly he would not have bought the club and described the Football League as \\"...really tricky, they made trouble at a time when I couldn't walk away and I submitted myself to a trial, a humiliation...I don't want to be here if the Football League don‚Äôt want me but who are they anyway?...They are acting for what's right, the principles, the ideals. Me, I sort out the f*cking problems at Leeds. I prefer to play by the rules, not to cheat.\\" Cellino has been disparaging of GFH's management of Leeds, saying that \\"...You can see what‚Äôs been happening here ‚Äì it's been done by people who knew they weren't staying. And now I have to clean up the sh*t...GFH made big mistakes but not on purpose. That's why I don‚Äôt go against them for the moment. But the men who were here in GFH's name did a really, really bad job. That's not GFH fault. They trust people they shouldn't.\\" Cellino described the fans of Leeds as \\"...tired of eating sh*t and shutting their mouths. They accept me with enthusiasm and that gives me a lot of responsibility. I'm the richest man in the world with these fans and I can challenge anyone, everyone.\\" Cellino later questioned manager Brian McDermott's decision to take a holiday, proclaiming that Leeds \\"have no manager\\", and asked \\"Who's managing this club?' Brian, where's Brian?\\". It was also revealed that the retain and release list of players would be handled by Cellino and Benito Carbone and not McDermott. Leeds later confirmed Carbone's position at the club in a statement, confirming that he would 'be involved with all football matters, including both the first team and the academy'. On 30 May, Leeds reached a mutual agreement with manager Brian McDermott to end his spell at the club. With Cellino wanting to hire a head coach rather than a manager. On 16 June, McDermott was succeeded as Leeds manager by Dave Hockaday who took up the role in a head coach capacity. On 11 July 2014, Leeds under-18s manager Richard Naylor was made redundant as was Leeds under-16s coach Leigh Bromby. On 3 August 2014, after joining the club in April 2014 sporting consultant Benito Carbone left his job after his relationship with Cellino deteriorated. After a 4‚Äì1 defeat to Watford on 23 August, Cellino had made up his mind to sack head coach Hockaday; however he had a change of heart, deciding to blame himself for the club's poor start to the season. Five days later, he changed his mind again and sacked Hockaday. Assistant Junior Lewis was sacked at the same time, with the duo having been at the club for only 70 days. Cellino aimed to repurchase Leeds' Elland Road stadium in 2014, and expects the club to be in the Premier League, the top tier of English football, by the end of the 2015‚Äì16 season. In September 2014, Cellino appointed Darko Milaniƒç as the new head coach of Leeds on a two-year deal replacing Hockaday, though Milaniƒç was dismissed 32 days later after not winning one of his six games while in charge. In November 2014 Neil Redfearn was confirmed as the new head coach of Leeds, on an initial 12-month contract with the option of a further 12 months, the contract also had a clause that would see Redfearn return to the academy if he was to leave his role as head coach. On 1 December 2014, Cellino was disqualified by the Football League and asked to resign from the club. The Football League took the decision after obtaining documents from an Italian court, where he was found guilty of tax evasion. On 19 January 2015, Cellino's appeal against the Football League's disqualification was rejected, with the appeal committee ruling that his ban would stand. However, Cellino, and the club, were facing another charge which related to the length of time it took Cellino to present The Football League with the court documents in the first place. This was settled in March 2015, and resulted in Cellino having his ban extended until 8 May, 2015, the day after the 2014‚Äì15 season ended, to which Cellino responded by saying that he would return to his president role at the club once the ban expired. On 2 April, during Cellino's ban away from the club, Cellino's sporting director Nicola Salerno mysteriously suspended Steve Thompson, Leeds assistant manager who was credited with lifting Leeds from a place above relegation to 10th in the Football Championship. Leeds had won 6 out of the previous 10 matches. On 9 April 2015, Leeds United's suspended owner, Cellino, informed the press that he believed Salerno had resigned. Cellino, with the approval of the Football League returned to the club, rejoining the board as club chairman and president on 2 May, 2015. On 14 May, 2015, Cellino carried out a press conference unveiling Adam Pearson as the club's Executive Director to work directly alongside Cellino. The press conference included Cellino leaving halfway through for a cigarette break only to return, and for the press conference to run for over an hour, with Cellino refusing to reveal the future of head coach Neil Redfearn. Cellino revealed that he would also sell the club if he felt he was not ready to take the club to the premier league by 2016/17 season. However, on 16 May, with speculation mounting further about Neil Redfearn's future as Leeds United Head Coach, Cellino in an interview with The Mirror proclaimed Redfearn to be 'weak' and 'a baby'. On 20 May, 2015, Uwe R√∂sler was appointed as the head coach of Championship side Leeds United on a two-year deal. On 24 June 2015, it was announced that after Cellino's long time friend Nicola Salerno had helped the club sign Sol Bamba from Palermo that Salerno and the club had agreed a mutual termination of Salerno's contract, with the club stating Leeds United would like to thank Nicola for his efforts over the past year and he will always be welcomed back to Elland Road in the future. On 22 September 2015, Cellino criticized Leeds player Sam Byram, Cellino revealed he was 'deeply offended' and 'hurt' that Byram had not signed a new contract at Leeds United. Yorkshire Evening Post reported that the contract offer from Cellino to Byram was actually a reduction on his existing wage. On 16 October, Cellino advised as a protest to The Football League, about kick off changes for televised games that he would limit Leeds away fan ticket allocated to the bare minimum football league requirement of 2k. The decision was met with anger from Leeds United fans, who advised the reduced allocation was not the way forward for the club's fans. On 20 October, Cellino performed a U-turn on his decision to limit Leeds fans ticket allocation at away games, after heavy criticism from the club's fans. On 19 October, Uwe R√∂sler was sacked after two wins from just 12 games in charge, following a 2‚Äì1 home defeat to Brighton & Hove Albion which left Leeds in 18th place in the Championship. On the same day, he was replaced him as Leeds Head Coach with former Rotherham Manager Steve Evans. Also on 19 October, it was announced by the Football League that Cellino had been disqualified as Leeds United owner for a year, the second time he has been banned by the football League, for an issue regarding Italian Tax Legislation thus failing the Football League's Owners & Directors Test. On 30 October, Cellino revealed he would sell Leeds United to Leeds United Fans Group 'Leeds Fans United', announcing \\"100% I will sell to the fans, if they want to buy it and look after the club. The fans are the only asset the club has.\\" On 2 November, Cellino revealed that he would no longer attend Leeds United matches due to vocal criticism after he attended the club's 2-0 loss against Blackburn Rovers. On 4 November, Cellino announced a dramatic U-turn of his decision to sell the club to Leeds Fans United, and accused the potential buyers of 'fairytales'. With LFU announcing a statement \\"Leeds Fans Utd has just been informed by the lawyers of Massimo Cellino that he no longer wishes to sell to Leeds fans.\\" On 13 November, The Football League announced that Cellino's disqualification ban had been deferred due to Cellino appealing the ban, they announced that should Cellino's appeal fail after the hearing, that the deferral would not change the length of the ban. On 29 December, Cellino banned Sky Sports cameras from entering Elland Road to live broadcast Leeds' game against Derby. However, due to possible sanctions the club could face, the broadcasting team were 'reluctantly' allowed in. With speculation if Evans would be retained as head coach for the 2016‚Äì17 season, on 18 April 2016, Cellino's interview with the Daily Telegraph cast doubt of head coach Steve Evans long term prospects, Cellino advised he felt Evans 'talks too much' and that Evans had to learn to 'shut his mouth'. On 9 May, 2016, Cellino was acquitted 'on appeal' for his tax evasion conviction, after failing to pay VAT on a Range Rover imported from the USA into Italy. Despite being acquitted of tax evasion and the resulting removal of the Football League disqualification, on 13 May, 2016, Cellino revealed in an exclusive interview with The Times that he had regretted buying the club, and that he would now sell the club if he received the right offer. On 23 May, 2016, it was revealed that MK Dons manager Karl Robinson had turned down the opportunity from Cellino to become Leeds United head coach, further casting doubt on current head coach Steve Evans' future at the club. On 27 May, after being turned down by Robinson, Cellino then approached Bristol Rovers manager Darrell Clarke to replace Evans, however he was again rebuffed with Clarke preferring to sign a new deal at Rovers. On 31 May, 2016, Steve Evans and his assistant Paul Raynor were both sacked by Cellino, becoming the sixth manager to be sacked by Cellino in two years. On Evans' sacking Cellino revealed in a club statement that he felt the club 'needed a different approach in order to achieve targets for the new season'. In June 2016, ex-Leeds United-women's forward and former Education & Welfare officer Lucy Ward won a high-profile legal battle against her dismissal from the club in 2015.https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england- leeds-36037672 On 2 June 2016, Garry Monk was appointed the new head coach of Leeds United on a one-year rolling contract, replacing Evans. On 8 September 2016, Cellino's Eleonora Sport Ltd became Leeds United's 100% share owners, after buying the 15% shares of minority owner Gulf Finance House (GFH Capital), thus becoming Leeds United's sole majority shareholder. On 4 January 2017, Andrea Radrizzani purchased a 50 percent stake from Cellino for Leeds United. On 23 May, 2017, Andrea Radrizzani announced the 100% buyout of Leeds United, buying the remaining 50% shares from previous co-owner Massimo Cellino, with Radrizzani taking full ownership of the club. Cellino issued a statement on the club website thanking the fans and said 'if you can survive working with me, you can survive anything'. =Brescia= After leaving Leeds, Cellino returned to Italy and purchased Serie B Side Brescia. On 3 June 2017, Manager Roberto Boscaglia was appointed by Brescia as their head coach for the 2017‚Äì18 Serie B season. However, Cellino replaced him with Pasquale Marino on 12 October 2017, only a few weeks after the club's takeover by Cellino. On 16 January 2018, Cellino then re-hired Roberto Boscaglia as head coach, following Marino's firing. He was however sacked once again on 29 April, leaving Brescia in thirteenth place in the Serie B table. On 29 April 2018, Cellino appointed his 4th manager of the 2017/18 season, by appointing Ivo Pulga as the new head coach after the dismissal of Roberto Boscaglia. Convictions and arrests Cellino was arrested in February 2013 with the mayor of Quartu Sant'Elena, Mauro Contini, and the public works commissioner Stefano Lilliu, for attempted embezzlement and fraudulent misrepresentation following an investigation into the construction of the Stadio Is Arenas. Cellino was held in custody for over two weeks, in a case which remains unresolved. Cellino's arrest warrant called him a man of \\"marked criminal tendencies ... capable of using every kind of deception to achieve his ends\\". Cellino has two prior criminal convictions, for deceiving the Italian Ministry of Agriculture out of ¬£7.5m in 1996 and for false accounting at Cagliari in 2001. Personal life Cellino has a deep suspicion of the number 17, which is considered unlucky in Italian culture. At Cagliari's stadium Cellino had the number 17 removed from seats and replaced with 16b. Cellino also has a dislike for the colour purple, which is also considered unlucky in Italy, see Italian superstitions. On 15 May, 2014, Leeds United retired the number 17 shirt due to superstitious reasons for Cellino. Up until June 2014, the last occupant of the shirt had been Michael Brown. He plays guitar in the cover band Maurillos. On 3 May, 2014, at Leeds United's annual end of season awards, Cellino joined the band The Pigeon Detectives on lead guitar for a cover version of Jimi Hendrix's song \\"Hey Joe\\".https://www.hinckleytimes.net/whats-on/music-nightlife-news/pigeon- detectives-coup-for-nightclub-8329585 Cellino has properties in Leeds and Miami, Florida. Cellino has a wife, Frances, and three children: two sons, Ercole and Edoardo who were directors at Leeds United, and a daughter Eleonora. On 18 April 2020 he tested positive for COVID-19.

The two principal partners were sea captain Edmund Fanning and financier Willet Coles. The firm existed from 1798 to 1815, owning several large mercantile vessels. Sailing from New York City to South America and later the Pacific Ocean, the American vessels would gather and purchase seal skins throughout southern Atlantic and Pacific. These valuable pelts included hides from the South American fur seal. After a successful voyage around Cape Horn and enough animal furs were gathered, the vessels from Fanning & Coles then typically sailed for the Qing Dynasty port of Guangzhou, China. Here valuable Chinese manufactured goods were purchased, which included nankeens and porcelain, in addition to stockpiles of tea commonly valued and sold for $40,000 in profits annually. On the 1798 voyage of the Betsey they caught 100,000 seals which were sold in China. On several voyages they discovered new uncharted islands such as Fanning Island and Palmyra Atoll. Coles and Fanning secured permission President James Madison for an expedition to the Fiji Island to buy rare woods for trade with China. The firm built the 290 ton Tonquin. The firm sold the Tonquin to John Jacob Astor's Pacific Fur Company for $37,000 in 1810. The Tonquin was sent to the Northwest to trade furs. Willett Coles also owned a manhattan rum distillery with his father Stephen Coles. He is listed in 1811 as a founding member of a group that chartered the original Bank of America in NY. Coles was one of the first presidents of the New York City Fire Department (1808). The Coles were descendants of original settler Robert Coles who founded the settlement of Glen Cove, NY. ( originally called Musketa Cove) Sources are the books written by Edmund Fanning on the voyages of the Betsey, national archives of the USA, presidential documents of Jefferson, Monroe and Madison.

Cucumber and muskmelon plants are most susceptible, but squash, pumpkins, and gourds may also become infected. Disease transmission Erwinia tracheiphila is spread between plants by two species of insect vectors, striped cucumber beetles (Acalymma Vittatum) and spotted cucumber beetles (Diabrotica undecimpunctata). The beetles acquire E. tracheiphila by feeding on infected plants, then carry the bacteria in their digestive tracts. The disease may be spread to susceptible plants through feeding wounds, by way of infected mouthparts or frass. The bacteria is capable of overwintering in the gut of its insect vectors. Symptoms and diagnosis Bacterial wilt is a disease of the vascular tissue. When a plant is infected, E. tracheiphila multiplies within the xylem, eventually causing mechanical blockage of the water transport system. The first sign of infection, which appears about five days after acquisition, is the wilting of individual leaves on a single stem. However, the disease will soon spread down the runner and then infect the whole plant, causing it to shrivel and die. There is a diagnostic test for bacterial wilt that can be done in the field. The presence of the E. tracheiphila causes the sap to become a milky color and acquire a sticky consistency. If the stem is cut near the crown and the ends are slowly pulled apart, the sap should form a viscous string. Treatment and prevention Once a plant is infected, there is no way of stopping the spread of the disease. Some cucurbit cultivars are less susceptible than others, so it is beneficial to plant these cultivars. However, since wilt-resistant plants have not yet been developed, the most effective way to prevent the disease is to keep beetle populations at a minimum. While various methods of beetle control have been tested, the most effective preventative measure is to keep beetle populations as low as possible through careful field monitoring and insecticide sprays.

Rural poverty The District Human Development Report for Nadia has provided a CD Block-wise data table for Modified Human Vulnerability Index of the district. Kaliganj CD Block registered 36.35 on the MHPI scale. The CD Block-wise mean MHVI was estimated at 33.92. A total of 8 out of the 17 CD Blocks in Nadia district were found to be severely deprived when measured against the CD Block mean MHVI - Karimpur I and Karimpur II (under Tehatta subdivision), Kaliganj, Nakashipara, Chapra, Krishnanagar I and Nabadwip (under Krishnanagar Sadar subdivision) and Santipur (under Ranaghat subdivision) appear to be backward. As per the Human Development Report 2004 for West Bengal, the rural poverty ratio in Nadia district was 28.35%. The estimate was based on Central Sample data of NSS 55th round 1999-2000. Economy =Livelihood= In Kaliganj CD Block in 2011, amongst the class of total workers, cultivators formed 20.98%, agricultural labourers 47.44%, household industry workers 3.71% and other workers 27.87%. The southern part of Nadia district starting from Krishnanagar I down to Chakdaha and Haringhata has some urban pockets specialising in either manufacturing or service related economic activity and has reflected a comparatively higher concentration of population but the urban population has generally stagnated. Nadia district still has a large chunk of people living in the rural areas. =Infrastructure= There are 105 inhabited villages in Kaliganj CD Block. 100% villages have power supply and 103 villages (98.10%) had drinking water supply. 29 Villages (27.62%) have post offices. 83 villages (79.05%) have telephones (including landlines, public call offices and mobile phones). 57 villages (54.29%) have a pucca approach road and 51 villages (48.70%) have transport communication (includes bus service, rail facility and navigable waterways). Five villages (4.76%) have agricultural credit societies and 12 villages (11.43%) have banks. Although 100% villages in Nadia district had power supply in 2011, a survey in 2007-08 revealed that less than 50% of households had electricity connection. In rural areas of the country, the tube well was for many years considered to be the provider of safe drinking water, but with arsenic contamination of ground water claiming public attention it is no longer so. Piped water supply is still a distant dream. In 2007-08, the availability of piped drinking water in Nadia district was as low as 8.6%, well below the state average of around 20%. =Agriculture= Although the Bargadari Act of 1950 recognised the rights of bargadars to a higher share of crops from the land that they tilled, it was not implemented fully. Large tracts, beyond the prescribed limit of land ceiling, remained with the rich landlords. From 1977 onwards major land reforms took place in West Bengal. Land in excess of land ceiling was acquired and distributed amongst the peasants. Following land reforms land ownership pattern has undergone transformation. In 2013-14, persons engaged in agriculture in Kaliganj CD Block could be classified as follows: bargadars 6.23%, patta (document) holders 8.49%, small farmers (possessing land between 1 and 2 hectares) 7.71%, marginal farmers (possessing land up to 1 hectare) 29.78% and agricultural labourers 47.79%.As the proportion of agricultural labourers is very high, the real wage in the agricultural sector has been a matter of concern. Kaliganj CD Block had 178 fertiliser depots, 25 seed stores and 72 fair price shops in 2013-14. In 2013-14, Kaliganj CD Block produced 25,125 tonnes of Aman paddy, the main winter crop from 9,361 hectares, 32,211 tonnes of Boro paddy (spring crop) from 8,013 hectares, 12,497 tonnes of Aus paddy (summer crop) from 4,787 hectares, 11,028 tonnes of wheat from 2,923 hectares, 152,125 tonnes of jute from 8,428 hectares, 7,731 tonnes of potatoes from 251 hectares and 178,831 tonnes of sugar cane from 1,784 hectares. It also produced pulses and oilseeds. In 2013-14, the total area irrigated in Kaliganj CD Block was 1,446 hectares, out of which 1,004 hectares were irrigated by river lift irrigation and 442 hectares by deep tube wells. =Pith helmets= Since time immemorial Kaliganj was most popular in respect of manufacturing shola hats which was being widely used by government officials, specially the police personnel. With the advent of other varieties of hats which also gained the approval for the use by the government officials the industry was closed. =Banking= In 2013-14, Kaliganj CD Block had offices of 7 commercial banks and 6 gramin banks. Transport Kaliganj CD Block has 4 originating/ terminating bus routes. The Ranaghat-Lalgola branch line was opened in 1905. It passes through this CD Block and there are stations at Plassey, Pagla Chandi and Debagram railway station. NH 14 (old number NH 34) passes through this block. Education In 2013-14, Kaliganj CD Block had 95 primary schools with 6,626 students, 6 middle schools with 866 students, 4 high school with 2,081 students and 13 higher secondary schools with 16,052 students.

Healthcare In 2014, Kaliganj CD Block had 1 rural hospital, 5 primary health centres and 3 private nursing homes with total 120 beds and 10 doctors (excluding private bodies). It had 38 family welfare subcentres. 5,415 patients were treated indoor and 396,495 patients were treated outdoor in the hospitals, health centres and subcentres of the CD Block. Kaliganj Rural Hospital, with 25 beds at Juranpur, is the major government medical facility in the Kaliganj CD block. There are primary health centres at Debagram (with 10 beds), Juranpur (with 10 beds), Matiari (with 6 beds), Mira (with 10 beds) and Panighata (with 20 beds). Kaliganj CD Block is one of the areas of Nadia district where groundwater is affected by high level of arsenic contamination. The WHO guideline for arsenic in drinking water is 10 mg/ litre, and the Indian Standard value is 50 mg/ litre. All the 17 blocks of Nadia district have arsenic contamination above this level. The maximum concentration in Kaliganj CD Block is 1,000 mg/litre.

Lockwood was ordered to Hatteras Inlet 2 February 1862 to take part in combined operations which struck the Confederacy with heavy and costly blows wherever water reached within the North Carolina Sounds. She was with Flag Officer Goldsborough during operations against Roanoke Island 7 February bombarding Confederate positions with deadly effective fire. The next day with eight other ships she cut the chain connecting two vessels which obstructed the channel, thus clearing a passage for the Union ships into Albemarle Sound. This victory and the follow-up operations in the sounds severed Norfolk's main supply lines, secured the North Carolina coast, diverted important strength from the main Confederate Armies, and weakened the South's ability to resist at sea. At the end of the fighting, Captain Alex Murray who commanded Goldborough's second column praised John L. Lockwood for being \\"conspicuously in the foreground throughout the bombardment.\\"  North Carolina coastal operations  With Roanoak Island secure, the fleet moved on to Elizabeth City, North Carolina, to destroy Confederate gunboats and interrupt the South's canal communications to the north of Albemarle Sound. The next major amphibious operation, the attack on Confederate batteries on the Neuse River 13 March, resulted in Union occupation of New Bern, North Carolina, on the 14th. On 23 April, with and , John L. Lockwood, blocked the mouth of the Chesapeake Bay and Albemarle Canal near Elizabeth City, North Carolina, sinking a schooner and other obstructions inside the waterway. She remained in North Carolina's inland waters patrolling the innumerable inlets and streams and assisting Army units ashore until sailing from Hatteras Inlet for repairs at Hampton Roads 3 September 1863. Refitting completed, John L. Lockwood departed Norfolk Navy Yard 8 January 1864 and arrived New Bern 14 January to resume duty in the sounds. She captured sloop Twilight at Elizabeth City, North Carolina. During most of her further service she was stationed at New Bern where after the war she decommissioned 23 May 1865.  Post-war decommissioning and sale  She was towed to Baltimore late in May and thence taken to Washington 27 July. John L. Lockwood was sold at Washington to Mr. Cresset of New York 15 September 1865 and redocumented Henry Smith 3 April 1866. The Army purchased and renamed her Chester A. Arthur 30 June 1876.

She later willed her fortune to be used to establish San Antonio's first museum of modern art, which today bears her name.Burkhalter, Lois Wood. Marion Koogler McNay: A Biography, 1883-1950 (San Antonio: Marion Koogler McNay Art Institute, 1968) Inspired by Modern, Impressionism, and American Art she used her wealthy background to cultivate her eclectic art collection. McNay was able to design her San Antonio home after moving there in 1926. As soon as McNay moved to San Antonio she began buying and commissioning art pieces. The Spanish styled house was able to showcase a diverse amount of paintings including both American and European styled art. McNay favored Art made in the South Western American style. The fortune she inherited was able to fund her art collection which spanned over seven hundred art pieces by 1950, marking the year of her passing. San Antonio allowed McNay to have an expansive estate marking over 23 acres of land. The goal for McNay was to make her museum \\"a place of beauty with the comforts and warmth of a home.\\"  Early life  Marion was born in Ohio to Dr.Marion and Clara Koogler.McNay was their only child and a year after her birth, the family moved to El Dorado, Kansas, where her parents invested and purchased a large tract of pasture land.This land later proved to contain substantial oil reserves, and made the family wealthy. This allowed Marion to attend the University of Kansas from 1900 to 1902 and the Art Institute of Chicago. When her parents retired in Marion, Ohio she made her move back to her home state.The San Antonio mansion she purchased in 1926 after McNay's inheritance was designed by Atlee and Robert Ayres on an acreage called Sunset Hills and was finished in 1929.  Marriages  Marion married her first husband, railway manager and sergeant, Don McNay, in 1917. The marriage only lasted 10 months, ending with Don's death from the Spanish influenza in 1918. She first visited Texas when Don McNay, at the time of being alive, was currently stationed in Laredo during World War 1. In 1926, she moved to San Antonio, Texas where she then married prominent ophthalmologist Donald T. Atkinson who also owned a piece of land north of San Antonio, Texas known as Sunset Hills. Although Marion and Donald were both wealthy, her oil inheritance was not affected during the Great Depression. After her marriage with Donald ended in 1936, she went on to marry (and divorce) four more times, eventually reverted to using the name McNay for the remainder of her life. She briefly married and financially supported artist Victor Higgins in 1937, but the two separated only two years later and divorced in 1940.  Teaching  In 1915, while she was living with her parents, the superintendent of city schools of Marion, Ohio wrote that she \\"is one of the best qualified art teachers I have ever known. She teaches art in a manner that arouses and develops the child's observation and enlarges his aesthetic nature.Biography. \\"Dedicated to the Advancement and the Enjoyment of Modern Art.\\" Teacher Resource Center at the McNay Art Museum. \\" McNay supported the Arts and in 1942, she offered the use of her home to the San Antonio Art Institute which in turn prevented the school's closure. Her friend and collaborator, sculptor Charles Umlauf, said that she \\"always had the sympathy of the artist at hand because she herself was an artist. In the later part of McNay's career she dedicated her time to be a part of the directorship of the San Antonio Art Institute, which eventually closed in 1990, forty years after her death.  Art collection  In 1926, after the death of her father, Marion moved to San Antonio with her mother and married Dr. Donald Atkinson. On his property, she began to construct a Spanish Mediterranean style mansion (she designed some of the tilework and ceiling stencils herself), which was completed in 1927.Marion Koogler McNay , Fine Art Dealers' Association. Accessed 2007-10-08. She also began to accumulate a significant collection of artwork. The first oil painting she purchased was Diego Rivera's Delfina Flores. She collected a large number of French Impressionist and Post-Impressionist works of art, early 20th-century modernists including Picasso, Matisse, and Chagall. She also bought a number of Southwestern santos and retablos. Alongside these works photographs,Native American pottery,sculptures,prints and designs have been added both post-humorously and through her own purchases.  Pueblo Indian patronage  Marion was a significant patron of the arts among the Pueblo Indians of New Mexico, where she made frequent trips. Although raised Presbyterian, McNay converted to Catholicism under the wisdom and teachings of Rev.Peter Baque, the founder of The Missionary Servants of St. Anthony.The organization was given money by McNay as a form of charity work In 1943, Congress proposed a bill providing for the exploration of Pueblo lands with the ultimate goal of building a dam on the Rio Grande. Marion, in conjunction with other conservationists, was instrumental in defeating this proposal. Later McNay requested to be buried next to Rev. Baque in San Antonio after his death in 1938.  Death and legacy  Upon her death, Marion left her art collection of more than 700 works of art, along with the house, the surrounding 23 acres of land, and an endowment, to establish the first Art Museum of Modern Art in Texas. This was the first museum of its kind in San Antonio and the Southwest region of the United States.The museum was named in honor of Marion and has been considered the centerpiece of San Antonio art community and culture. The museum expanded to include galleries of medieval and Renaissance artwork and a larger collection of 20th-century European and American modernist work. A large theatre arts library and gallery were also added, as well as an art reference library and an auditorium. More recently, the McNay Art Museum recently added the Stieren Center, built by internationally renowned architect Jean-Paul Viguier, to display their Modern collection.

Byeon is famous for his precise depictions of animals and people in detailed brushwork. Biography His courtesy name (ja) is Wanbo and pen name (ho) is Hwajae. His birth and death dates are unknown, but was active in the mid 18th century during King Sukjong's (r.1674‚Äì1720) and King Yeongjo's reign (r. 1724‚Äì76). Byeon was praised for his excellent depictions of animals and people. He served as a royal painter of Dohwaseo, the office of painting and then as a hyeongam, a magistrate of a small province. According to the book titled Jinhui sokgo (ÈúáÂΩôÁ∫åÊî∑), Byeon Sangbyeok was especially excellent at depicting cats and chicken, so he gained nicknames like Byeon Goyang (trans. Byeon Cat)Yu, Hong- jun, An Approach through the theory on Art to theory on Painting of Scholars of the Korean Practical Science\\", Sungkyun Journal of East Asian Studies, Vol. 4, No. 1, 2004, p.126 and Byeon Dak (Byeon Rooster). In addition, the book says that Byeon was famous for drawing portraits too, so he was also referred as Guksu (ÂúãÊâã, a first class artisan) of the time, and his portrait works are over 100 pieces. Though, one of his extant portraits, the portrait of Yun Geup, an officer, does not show his excellent skills. He participated in drawing the portraits of King Yeongjo in 1763 and 1773. Works Byeon's representative works include \\"Myojakdo\\" (Painting of Cats and Sparrows) and \\"Gyejado\\" (Painting of a Chicken and Chicks). Myojakdo housed in the National Museum of Korea captures a lively scene of two cats and alarmed sparrows around a tree in detailed brushwork. The depiction of a group of chirping sparrows on twigs are illustrated precisely with very detailed brushstrokes. It is based on his deep affections toward animals and close observations in real life.

On 24 October 1679 Svea Hovr√§tt in Stockholm brought the charges, earlier raised in the court of L√•nghundra H√§radsting.  The trial  = Background = Lisbetha Olsdotter is reported to have been originally from Tysslinge torp in √ñstuna parish in L√•nghundra H√§rad. She married the village tailor Anders Persson and had children with him: during her trial in 1679, it was reported that she had one surviving child of six years old. In 1674, she abandoned her husband because of his adultery and debauched lifestyle, and become a domestic servant to H. Schlangenfeldt in Huvudsta in Stockholm, where she worked for four years. According to court documents, she was originally advised to dress as a man by her colleague, the soldier's widow, Sara, for the purpose of seducing a vivacious widow, referred to by the names Maria or Walborg. After this incident, she left her employ and successfully sought employment as a male servant in the household of the country administrator Jon Persson in Alby in Botkyrka under the name Mats Ersson. In 1678, her employer was visited by a man with the task to enlist soldiers to the king. In parallel, the brother of her employer, the master mariner Erik Persson Arnelii, reportedly discovered her gender and persuaded her to enlist as a soldier by threatening to expose her if she did not. He assisted her in how to enlist, and after having successfully done so, she gave Arnelii some of her salary as in return for his help and silence. She was present in all the military drills and performed all her duties as a soldier. In Easter 1679 she married the maid Kerstin Ersdotter in accordance with all customary traditional ceremonies of the church. After the wedding, however, Kerstin Ersdotter discovered the biological sex of her groom when attempting to have intercourse, and reported Lisbetha Olsdotter to the authorities for fraud. She was arrested on Norrmalm and put on trial on 5 July 1679. = Charges = Olsdotter was put on trial for several charges: *Abandonment of husband and children; *Wearing of male clothing, which was forbidden in the Bible, and the crime of secular fraud by pretending to be a man; *Bigamy, as she married when she already had a husband; *Homosexuality, and having ridiculed the holy act of marriage by marrying someone of the same sex; *Theft, after having received salary as a soldier; *Fraud, for taking a profession she was not capable of performing. = Execution = Olsdotter was judged guilty of the charges under the law of the act of religion from 1655: for having, with full intent, \\"mutilated\\" her gender, \\"mocked God and the Order of God\\", and fooled authorities and her \\"fellow Christians\\" by impersonating a man. She was sentenced to death by decapitation. The woman she had married, Kerstin Ersdotter, claimed that she had been as fooled as every one else and was therefore judged as a victim of the crime rather than an accomplice to it. Sara and Arnelii, who had helped her, were also arrested. The case, however, was so unusual, that the verdict would be confirmed by the highest Royal court in the country first. The Royal court confirmed the verdict on 12 November, and ordered the priests to clarify for her what sin she had committed in the eyes of religion. It was decided by the court, that she would go to her execution dressed as a man, but wear female headgear. She was decapitated on H√∂torget in Stockholm in 1679. From the late 16th century to the early 19th century, there were several known cases in Swedish military history of women dressing and presenting as men, especially in the early 18th century. The most famous case was the one of Ulrika Eleonora St√•lhammar in 1728. An unnamed woman, who served in the Great Northern War, was whipped as a punishment, but continued to wear male clothing until the 1740s, when she was known on the streets of Stockholm as \\"The Rider\\"; Maria Johansdotter, who was put on trial in Stockholm in 1706 for having dressed as a man and served as a parish clerk, was given a sentence of eight days in jail and then set free. Most of the cases did not lead to execution, as in the case of Lisbetha Olsdotter.

He was a cofounder of both the Sociological Art Collective (1974) and the Aesthetics of Communication movement (1983). Forest has taken part in the Biennale of Venice (1976) and the Documenta of Kassel (1977, 1987) and his work has won awards at the Bienal do S√£o Paulo (1973) and the Festival of Electronic Arts of Locarno (1995). In 2004, Forest's archives, including his video works, were added to the collection of the Institut National de l'Audiovisuel of France. A retrospective of his work was held at the Slought Foundation in Philadelphia in 2007. The holder of a state doctorate in the humanities from the Sorbonne (his 1985 thesis committee included Abraham Moles, Frank Popper, and Jean Duvignaud), Forest has also taught on the faculty of the Ecole Nationale Sup√©rieure d'Art, Cergy-Pontoise; the University of Paris, Panth√©on-Sorbonne; and the University of Nice, Sophia-Antipolis. He is the author of numerous books on art, communication, and technology including Pour un art actuel: l‚Äôart √† l‚Äôheure d‚ÄôInternet (1998, For an Art of Today: Art in the Internet Age), Fonctionnements et dysfonctionnements de l‚Äôart contemporain (2000, The Inner Workings and Dysfunctionality of Contemporary Art), and L‚Äô≈ìuvre-syst√®me invisible (2006, The Invisible System Work). Aside from his artworks, which are often imbedded in the mass media and use publicity as a raw material, Forest is well known in France as a fierce critic of the contemporary art establishment‚Äîa critical stance that led him to take the Mus√©e National d'Art Moderne (Centre Georges Pompidou) to court (1994‚Äì97) over its refusal to disclose the purchase prices of recent acquisitions.A complete account is offered in Forest's book Fonctionnement et dysfonctionnements de l'art contemporain. He is also one of the founders of the French F√™te de l‚ÄôInternet, or Internet Fest.For background information on the festival, see Michael F. Leruth, \\"The French F√™te de l‚ÄôInternet,\\" The French Review 73.5(April 2000): 921-942. Beginnings A self-taught artist whose formal education ended after primary school (he was later authorized to present a doctoral thesis under special provisions), Forest worked for fifteen years as a postal service employee, first in Algeria and then in France, before deciding to devote himself exclusively to artistic pursuits. In the early 1960s, he worked as an illustrator for the French newspapers Combat and Les Echos and experimented with the projection of moving and still images on tableaux-√©crans, or screen- paintings. Having received a Sony CV-2400 Portapak video recorder in 1967 as part of a promotional campaign by Sony France, he ranks as one of the first artists in Europe and the world to experiment with video.As far as Europe is concerned, Sony France had three prototypes of this equipment, adapted to European technical norms, at its disposal at about the same time, in 1967. One of these prototypes was given to Fred Forest as part of a promotional campaign by Sony‚Äôs public relations department, which was planning on the equipment‚Äôs commercial distribution in France by the end of 1967. Fred Forest learned of the existence of this equipment from Pierre Schaeffer, who had just returned from a trip to the USA with some examples. See Tom Sherman's account of Forest's role in the beginnings of video art at http://newsgrist.typepad.com/underbelly/2007/01/the_premature_b.html Forest's first experimental video tapes, \\"The Telephone Booth\\" and \\"The Wall of Arles,\\" date from 1967. His first formal exhibition of video art, \\"Interrogation 69,\\" an interactive video installation, took place in May 1969 in the city of Tours. Influenced by the political and cultural ferment of May 68, Situationist critiques of the society of spectacle, Marshall McLuhan's writings, Umberto Eco's concept of the \\"open work,\\" and the avant-garde's proclaimed goal of breaking down the barrier between art and everyday life, Forest stopped producing traditional art objects in 1969 and focused instead on a utopian form of \\"social praxis\\" operating \\"under the cover of art.\\"Forest, Art sociologique vid√©o: 33. Because of its portability, low-fi aesthetic, immediacy, and potential for interactive feedback, video was the tool of choice for such experimental social praxis; however, Forest also became interested in the mass media at an early stage in his career. His first major series of works with the mass media was the \\"Space-Media\\" project of 1972, which included a small \\"parasitic\\" blank square (\\"150 cm2 of Newspaper\\") published in the January 12, 1972 edition of the daily Le Monde, which the readers were encouraged to mail back to Forest, filled in with commentary, creative writing, or artwork of their own. \\"Space-Media\\" was the subject of a major article by the philosopher and new media theorist Vil√©m Flusser, with whom Forest collaborated throughout his career. Sociological Art In 1974, Forest joined forces with Herv√© Fischer and Jean-Paul Th√©not to form the Collectif d‚ÄôArt Sociologique (disbanded in 1979). The members of the Collective were invited to represent France at the 76th Biennale of Venice by Pierre Restany, who became a lifelong friend and supporter of Forest and his work. Forest's video and video-based installation and performance works from this period include \\"Gestures in Work and Social Life\\" (1972‚Äì74), \\"Electronic Investigation of Rue Gu√©n√©gaud\\" (1973), \\"Senior Citizen Video\\" (1973), \\"Video Portrait of a Collector in Real Time\\" (1974), \\"Restany Dines at La Coupole\\" (1974), \\"TV Shock, TV Exchange\\" (1975), \\"Madame Soleil Exhibited in the Flesh\\" (1975), and \\"The Video Family\\" (1976).For additional information on Forest's actions from 1969 to 2003, see Forest, De l'art vid√©o au Net Art. In 1973, Forest was awarded the grand prize in communication at the 12th Bienal do S√£o Paulo for a series of provocative actions that included a mock street demonstration featuring marchers carrying blank placards, interactive experiments in the press, and a multimedia installation with an uncensored telephone call-in center. These actions elicited the attention and displeasure of Brazil's military regime and Forest was detained by the political police, released only after the French Embassy intervened on his behalf.A full account of Forest's actions in Brazil (in Portuguese and French) can be found in Vitoria Daniela Bousso (ed.) and Priscila Arantes (cur.), Circuitos paralelos: retrospectiva Fred Forest, exhibition catalog (S√£o Paulo: Pa√ßo das Artes, 2006). Forest's actions throughout the 1970s and beyond took aim at cultural as well as political power structures. This included the contemporary art establishment, whose perceived lack of imagination, corporatist logic, arcane traditions, star system, and speculative practices he lampooned in works like \\"The Artistic M2\\" (1977). For this project, Forest formed a certified real estate development company and placed ads in the national and international press announcing his plans to sell \\"artistic\\" square-meters of land‚Äîsmall plots of undeveloped land near the Franco-Swiss border. The ads prompted a police real estate fraud investigation and authorities intervened to halt the sale of the first square-meter plot at a public auction alongside a number of contemporary paintings and sculptures. At the last minute, Forest substituted the tiny plot of land with a square-meter piece of common cloth that had been trampled by the auction attendees as they crossed the threshold and this officially \\"non artistic\\" square meter of cloth fetched a usually high price of 6,500 Francs at the auction‚Äîthanks, no doubt, to the publicity Forest's action and the police investigation had attracted. At the auction's conclusion, Pierre Restany publicly declared that Forest's m2 was indeed a bona fide work of art. For actions such as the S√£o Paulo experiments and the \\"Artistic M2\\" operation, Forest can be considered a precursor of such current counter-cultural practices as tactical media, culture jamming, and hacktivism. Aesthetics of Communication Although the social and political concerns first developed within the framework of Sociological Art have remained strong in his work to this day, in the 1980s, Forest became increasingly interested in the \\"immanent realities\\" of electronic and networked communication‚Äîfor instance, issues of space, time, the body, knowledge, and identity. He faulted contemporary art for having largely ignored these means of communication, which had transformed everyday life and added an entirely new dimension to reality: the virtual space of information and communication, which Forest likened to new territory \\"dredged from the void.\\" In order to promote artistic research into the sensory, cognitive, psychological, symbolic, aesthetic, spiritual, and social properties of electronic telecommunications media, Forest and Professor Mario Costa of the University of Salerno formed the International Research Group for the Aesthetics of Communication in 1983.For more information on the Aesthetics of Communication, see the special issue of Leonardo; see also Claudia Gianetti's article \\"Aesthetics and Communicative Context\\" on the Media Art Net website, http://www.mediaartnet.org/themes/aesthetics_of_the_digital/aesthetics_and_communicative%20Context/. They were joined by the media theorist Derrick de Kerckhove, Director of the McLuhan Program in Culture and Technology at the University of Toronto, and a wide array of artists including many of the pioneers of telecommunications and telematic art. Among those affiliated with the group at some point were Robert Adrian X, Roy Ascott, St√©phan Barron, Jean-Pierre Giavonelli, Eric Gidney, Natan Karczmar, Tom Klinkowstein, Mit Mitopoulos, Antoni Muntadas, David Rokeby, Christian Sevette, Norman White, and Horacio Zabala. Forest himself was the author of the group's manifesto, \\"For an Aesthetics of Communication,\\" published in 1985. This important text laid out his vision of the metacommunicational artwork, whose goal is not to convey any particular message or imagery, but to create experimental micro-environments of communication in which certain salient, normally hidden features of the media themselves may be discovered. This usually involves the artist's conception of special media configurations of his own, composed of different elements of existing media deviated from their normal uses. The work is created by the users of system; it emerges from their consciousness-raising interaction with the system and each other. The artist's role is that of an \\"architect of information.\\" Forest's own metacommunicational artworks fall into three broad categories. The first involves media performances that are somewhat like technological versions of the koans that Zen masters ask their students in order to elicit sudden flashes of insight into existence and surrounding reality. In Forest's case, such works often focus on altered perceptual realities of time and space in the media environment. Notable examples include \\"Immediate Intervention\\" (1983), \\"Here and Now\\" (1983), \\"Electronic Blue, In Homage to Yves Klein\\" (1984), \\"Celebration of the Present\\" (1985), and \\"The Broken Vase\\" (1985). Another type of work involves whimsical exercises in telepresence and long-distance agency. Examples include \\"Telephonic Rally\\" (1986) and \\"Telephonic Faucet (1992), in which people contributed to filling a bucket in a Turin exhibition hall by turning on a faucet electronically triggered by their local and long-distance phone calls. Finally, there is a series of ambitious works that present alternative interfaces to the existing media and solicit public participation on a large scale. Examples include \\"The Stock Exchange of the Imaginary\\" (1982), \\"The Press Conference of Babel\\" (1983), \\"Learn to Watch T.V. by Listening to Your Radio\\" (1984), \\"In Search of Julia Margaret Cameron\\" (1986), and \\"Zenaide and Charlotte Take the Media by Storm\\" (1988). \\"The Press Conference of Babel\\" involved a multimedia installation that was also the set and makeshift studio of a pirate radio broadcast of expert analysis and public opinion over the broadcast of a leading French news interview program. As the preceding example suggests, Forest's works of this period were by no means devoid of political implications. Other examples include his installation of LED message boards juxtaposing Bible verses and Gulf War news dispatches (\\"The Electronic Bible and the Gulf War,\\" 1991), his public campaign for the presidency of Bulgarian National Television (\\"For a Utopian and Nervous Television,\\" 1991), and his broadcasting of peace messages into the former Yugoslavia via radio and loudspeakers mounted on towers near the border (\\"The Watchtowers of Peace,\\" 1993). Web Art With its multimedia capabilities, the opportunities it provides to bypass traditional art venues and to take interactive projects directly to a broader public, its rapid and profound impact on contemporary society and culture, and the mythical aura of cyberspace and the virtual, the Internet was naturally appealing to an artist of Forest's interests and practices.For a detailed discussion of the aesthetic significance of the Internet, see Forest, Pour un art actuel. His first work utilizing the Internet, \\"From Casablanca to Locarno,\\" a multimedia public participation redubbing of certain famous scenes from the Humphrey Bogart-Ingrid Bergman classic, was created in 1995. In 1996, Forest's web-based digital work \\"Network-Parcel\\" was sold at a public auction carried live on the Internet‚Äîthe first event of its kind. Forest went on to create a number of important online works including \\"Time Out\\" (1998, for the inaugural F√™te de l‚ÄôInternet), \\"The Time Processing Machine\\" (1998), \\"The Techno-Wedding\\" (1999), \\"The Center of the World\\" (1999), \\"Territorial Outings\\" (2001), \\"Networked Color\\" (2000), \\"Meat: The Territory of the Body and the Networked Body\\" (2002), \\"Memory Pictures\\" (2005), \\"The Digital Street Corner\\" (2005), and \\"Biennale 3000\\" (2006). Many of these works are concerned with developing new anthropological models for a world in which both individual and community have had to deal with the dual effects of dematerialization and deterritorialization, processes accelerated by the new digital technologies of networked communication. Some of the works literally constitute rites of passage. This is certainly true of \\"The Techno-Wedding,\\" a collaborative project of Forest and fellow digital media artist Sophie Lavaud. The work was in fact the real-life wedding of Forest and Lavaud, which was webcast live alongside a virtual reality variant of the ceremony. Another example is to be found in \\"The Center of the World,\\" which offered the public an opportunity to make a physical or telepresent pilgrimage to a shrine-like installation containing a digital relic of the old territorially centered world.For a discussion of these works, see Leruth, \\"From Aesthetics to Liminality.\\" Beginning in 2008, Forest launched a new series of performances in the environment of Second Life. The first in the series, \\"The Experimental Research Center of the Territory\\" (2008) is in continuity with a lifelong exploration of the notion of territory beginning with \\"The Artistic M2\\" (1977) and continuing through \\"The Territory of the M2\\" (1980, a simulated independent state on the grounds of Forest's property in the town of Anserville, near Paris) and \\"The Networked Territory\\" (1996, a hypertext work that Forest considers the Territory's transposition into cyberspace). Each Second Life work is adapted somewhat to the physical location in which it is presented (Nice, Sao Paulo, New York, Beirut, etc.). In addition to staging debates and discussions at a think tank for avatars and offering public access to a mystical disintegrator of trash, some of the Second Life performances center on the philosophical musings and personal confessions of Forest's digital alter ego, Ego Cyberstar. Recent Activities Forest's most recent work continues to demonstrate his critical approach to contemporary art and society as well as his commitment to exploring the anthropological, sensory, and philosophical ramifications of life in media space. Examples include \\"The Traders‚Äô Ball\\" (2010), which examined the implications of the global financial meltdown of 2007-08 through an online performance in Second Life coupled with an installation at the Lab Gallery in New York; \\"Ebb and Flow: The Internet Cave\\" (2011), a multimedia environment in Albi, France, which allowed visitors to encounter their own digital shadows in a cave-like setting reminiscent of Plato‚Äôs famous allegory from The Republic; and an unauthorized protest performance at the site of the Centre Pompidou‚Äôs Video Vintage exhibition in 2012 (Forest had himself bound from head to toe in old Portapak videotape and then invited members of the public to cut him free while he offered his critique of the institutional memory of early video art). In 2012 performance at the MoMA The conversation. In 2013, Forest was treated to his first-ever major retrospective in France: Fred Forest, homme-m√©dia no. 1 (Fred Forest, No. 1 Media Man), held at the Centre des Arts in Enghien-les-Bains, outside Paris. \\"Soir√©e Nomade \\" Fondation Cartier pour l'art contemporain.

Biography  Ruiz was born between 1804 and 1811 in San Antonio, then part of the Viceroyalty of New Spain interior province of Spanish Texas. He was the eldest son of Jos√© Francisco Ruiz and Josefa Hernandez. Ruiz supported the Texian cause during the Texas Revolution, when he was the alcade of San Antonio. General Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna did not trust Ruiz, and when the Mexican army entered San Antonio to begin the siege of the Alamo, Santa Anna placed Ruiz under house arrest. At the conclusion of the battle, Santa Anna ordered Ruiz to identify the bodies of David Crockett, James Bowie, and William Barret Travis and to dispose of the dead.Hopewell (1994), p. 124. He later \\"left one of the most vivid eyewitness accounts of the fall of the Alamo.\\" Ruiz stated that Crockett's body was found on the west side of the garrison, contradicting Susannah Dickinson's claim that he lay between the chapel and the low barracks to the south. He stated that Travis' body was found on a gun carriage on the north wall, with a single bullet wound to the forehead; and that Bowie's body was found in one of the rooms on the south side, on a bed. Account of the Battle of the Alamo The Ruiz account, first translated and published in the 1860 Texas Almanac has been generally well regarded by historians as one of the few from the perspective of a non-combatant observer. Ruiz stated that the Mexican Army advanced against the Alamo in the early morning hours of March 6, 1836, utilizing 4,000 troops, although all did not take part in the assault. According to Ruiz, the Mexican's were repulsed twice, and he commented that the cannon fired from the Alamo resembled a constant thunder. The third wave that attacked the Alamo consisted, according to Ruiz, of 800 Mexican troops, of which only an estimated 130 survived. However, they breached the Alamo walls on this last assault, and were supported by other Mexican units. Ruiz stated that when the Mexicans entered the walls, he and Political Chief Don Ramon Musquiz accompanied Don Carlos de la Garza across the bridge on Commerce Street, so that they might get a better view. However, Mexican Dragoons fired on them, forcing them to withdraw. After a half an hour, Santa Anna sent for Ruiz, and ordered him to join him in the Alamo, to locate and identify the bodies of Travis, Crockett, and Bowie. After locating the bodies and identifying them, Ruiz was instructed to help dispose of the dead Mexican soldiers. It was through the accounts by Ruiz that most historians base the number of confirmed defenders of the Alamo. The number of defenders has varied through history, with some indicating 180, while others indicate they believed the number to have been as high as 250. However, Ruiz stated that the Mexican Army burned 182 defender bodies after the battle. Gregorio Esparza, a Tejano defender, is known to have had his body claimed for proper burial by his two brothers, who received permission from Santa Anna to do so. Taking in accounts of others who claimed that their loved ones of Mexican descent were properly buried, the number of defenders is believed to have been between 182 and 189. Historians have also pondered over the number of troops lost by Santa Anna's forces. Most now agree that the combined Mexican dead and wounded range between 400 and 500. Santa Anna overstated the Alamo defender losses, claiming 600 killed and reported \\"We lost 70 men killed and 300 wounded\\". Ruiz however, claimed that the Mexican Army lost an estimated 1,600 troops during the battle, and was ordered to have those bodies buried or otherwise disposed of. Due to there being insufficient room in the cemetery, Ruiz had many of the bodies thrown into the river. Some have questioned Ruiz estimating the Mexican losses at 1,600, while others have completely dismissed that estimate. In historian Thomas Ricks Lindsey's 2003 book \\"Alamo Traces\\" the author takes exception to Ruiz's inflated casualty numbers and asserts that the 1860 Ruiz account \\"...has been accepted by historians and writers without sufficient examination\\". Lindsey also makes the argument that Francisco Flores and not Francisco Ruiz was the alcade of San Antonio in February 1836 and that neither were present during the siege, having been sent on a mission by Travis and Bowie to transport ammunition, clothing and provisions to the Alamo. Later life From 1837 until 1841, Ruiz served as an alderman in San Antonio. He strongly opposed Texas's annexation to the United States of America and believed that only those who had served during the Texas Revolution should be able to participate in making that decision. After the annexation was complete (late in 1845), Ruiz left San Antonio and lived for several years amongst the Indians. He later returned to the now-U.S. city of San Antonio. After his death on October 18, 1876, he was buried in the Ruiz-Herrera family cemetery in Bexar County.

She is one of two confirmed women to have been decorated for bravery in battle in Sweden before women were allowed into the military in the 20th century.  Biography  Hagberg is believed to have been born in Finner√∂dja. She arrived in Stockholm in 1777, where she married Anders Peter Hagberg (1753‚Äì1816), a soldier of the guard, in 1785. Her husband was called to serve in the war in 1788. She enlisted in the army dressed as a man under the name Petter Hagberg in search for her husband, because she had heard nothing of him since the beginning of the war. =War service= She participated in the Battle of Svensksund (1790) and in the Battle of Vyborg Bay as a marine soldier. At this battle, there was \\"at least one woman in a fighting position\\", and that was Hagberg. She was stationed to serve on the ship Styrbj√∂rn. According to a story, Admiral Kurt von Stedingk once called out for \\"Hagberg\\", and at this call, two soldiers reported to him; one was Hagberg, and the other was her husband. They kept her sex a secret, and this is known from her own words many years later. It was said that several of the soldiers who received medals for bravery in battle after having served in the Swedish army in the wars of 1788‚Äì1790 and the Finnish war of 1808‚Äì1809 were discovered to have been women disguised as men. Hagberg was one of these women. She was not the only woman to have distinguished herself in the war of 1788‚Äì90. A maid from F√§rnebo in V√§stmanland, Anna Maria Engsten, the maid Major P. H. Scharff, distinguished herself at the same occasion in 1790; when the ship she travelled on was evacuated, she refused and stayed on, and singlehandedly steered the ship back to Sweden at night during Russian fire, for which King Gustav III gave her a pension and decorated her with the medal F√∂r tapperhet till sj√∂ss for bravery. Hagberg and Engsten were the only two women confirmed to have received a decoration for bravery at sea; another woman, Elisa Bernerstr√∂m, is confirmed to have received a medal for bravery in battle on land.Cristopher von Warnstedt, Medaljerna f√∂r Tapperhet till Sj√∂ss (1974) Forum navale. 29. (Swedish). A third woman, Dorothea Maria L√∂rsch, wife of officer Thesl√∂f, took command over the ship Armida and directed it back from the battle after the officers of the ship had fallen, and for this, she was given the title of a Captain of the Swedish fleet. Hagberg was later in her service wounded in battle at Bj√∂rk√∂ Sund, and was ordered to go below deck to have her wounds tended to. She was unwilling, but was forced to obey this order, and thus, her gender was revealed. Hagberg was given a military pension of three riksdaler a year, also something which was a very rare thing for a woman to receive. She was recommended for the pension by Carl Olof Cronstedt. =Later life= After the war, Hagberg was given the personal privilege (unusual for a married woman) to trade in food (1793), and she had a spot reserved for her at the square of Oxtorget in Stockholm (1802), which was renewed the last time in 1819. Her husband died in 1816. She had at least two children (at least, these are the only ones confirmed to have reached adulthood); a son born in 1792, and a daughter born in 1797. In 1864, she was mentioned in a reference book about famous Swedish women in history. Here, it was said that; > \\"For about thirty years ago, on the Oxtorget square in Stockholm, one could > see an old woman selling ginger-bread cookies on a stand with a medal of > bravery on her chest. She had been married to a guardsman by the name of - > if this is correct - Hagstr√∂m, and found a life filled with loneliness after > her husband had been called out to serve at the war of 1788. She therefore > had herself enlisted in the navy dressed in the clothes of a man.\\" The name Hagstr√∂m was a misspelling, and it would, counted from 1864, have been forty rather than thirty years ago. In 1828, the life of Brita Hagberg was celebrated in the poem Fruktm√•nglerskan med Tapperhetsmedalj (The fruit seller woman with a medal of bravery) by the female poet Euphrosyne, (Julia Nyberg) who tells the tale of the female soldier, who dresses herself as a man and enlists in the army in search of her husband. Brita Hagberg was not the only woman in Swedish history to have disguised herself as a man to serve as a soldier, but she may be the only one to have received a military pension for military service in an age where women were officially barred from military service, and is as such unique. She died in Stockholm, and was given a military burial, which was probably unique for her time.

It covers about 38,000 square metres and has an estimated 14,000 burial sites. It was established in 1810 by the Bernardine monks of the Church of St. Francis of Assisi, just east of the city center in the U≈æupis district, and is situated on an embankment of the Vilnia river. Its development was a consequence of Tsarist authorities of the Russian Empire prohibiting burying the dead near churches. The residents of Vilnius moved the cemetery to what was then the outskirts of the city. The Columbaria were built on the east and west sides of the cemetery. The cemetery was expanded in 1860. After the Second World War the cemetery was abandoned for the most part and began to deteriorate. It was closed in the 1970s and since then until recently it had remained almost unchanged. Many of the oldest graves had sunk into the ground and became covered in moss. The eastern columbarium had almost entirely disappeared. Restoration and reconstruction of its buildings and monuments, including the western columbarium, began in the late 1990s. Restoration work Beginning in 2005, on the initiative of the Adam Mickiewicz Polish-Lithuanian foundation together with the Council for the Protection of Struggle and Martyrdom Sites (one of the main initiators of the project was Andrzej Przewo≈∫nik, a Polish historian who died in the airplane crash in Smolensk in 2010), conservation work on the cemetery (known in Polish as Cmentarz Bernardy≈Ñski na Zarzeczu) commenced with the aim of restoring the necropolis for 2010, the two hundredth anniversary of the founding. The restoration work was funded by private donors as well as through a joint effort by the Polish and Lithuanian governments. More than a hundred historic tombstones have been renovated, most of them those of Polish and Lithuanian participants of the January Uprising, Home Army soldiers and the past faculty of the Stefan Batory University.

She was decorated for bravery in battle, and was the first and only woman in Sweden awarded the F√∂r tapperhet i f√§lt for bravery in battle on land, while Brita Hagberg and Anna Maria Engsten were decorated for bravery at sea.Cristopher von Warnstedt, Medaljerna f√∂r Tapperhet till Sj√∂ss ( 1974) Forum navale. 29. . Service Elisa Servenius, a maid, met the soldier Bernard Servenius when his regiment was stationed in Stockholm. They fell in love and were married, and when the regiment left for war Elisa disguised herself as a man and enlisted as a soldier in the regiment herself: \\"as she had decided to live and to die with her husband\\". This regiment was either the King's lifeguard (livgardet) or the Queen's regiment (drottningens livregemente). Her husband was believed killed in action at the Battle of Ratan and S√§var, while she herself collected the ammunition of the enemy and gave it to her fellow soldiers during the battle. For this action Gustav Wachtmeister recommended that she be decorated for bravery in battle. During the march to Pite√•, when for the third time she prepared to \\"in her ability serve her country\\", her gender was discovered and she was fired. Elisa Servenius is mentioned in the famous memoirs of the queen, Hedvig Elisabeth Charlotte, who wrote in her diary: Speaking of the latest expedition to V√§sterbotten, I forgot to mention, that an amazon appeared on the battlefield Wachtmeister informed the queen of the case in a report, in which he asked her to provide Servenius with an economic gift, as Servenius was a member of the Queen's own regiment. In the report to the queen, this version was given: Servenius hid in the boat which took the regiment of her husband away. She was discovered, but allowed to remain despite her sex. At Ratan, she marched at her husband's side dressed in a uniform, nursed the wounded, collected the ammunition from the fallen and handed it to her fellow soldiers during the battle. Her husband was reported dead, but she was convinced he was alive and a prisoner, and followed the army to Pite√• in a new regiment. During this expedition, her biological sex was discovered by her new comrades. Officers, who knew her from the earlier expedition, informed admiral Johan af Puke and recommended that she should be spared from further inconvenience. Puke informed himself of her conduct during the battle at Ratan and decided to award her with the medal for bravery in battle. Wachtmeister described Elisa Servenius to the queen as a former kitchen maid, with \\"energetic, expressive eyes, vivid in her ways and appearance, and even intelligent, so much so as one could ask from a person of her class\\", and that she \\"made herself noted with a natural fearlessness before danger\\" When asked, if she was afraid during the firing on the battlefield, she had replied: > Why would I be? I am with my husband, for him I would do anything, and also, > I wish to help the wounded. I ask nothing more than to do it again, if > needed; I do not mind the flying of the bullets the least bit, you will die > someday anyway, this way as well as another. The queen was impressed with her, and commented: Truly a philosophic way of reason from a woman of the people and a proof of wisdom as well as judgment. After the war, it was discovered that her husband had been captured rather than killed in action. He was released from his Russian captivity in 1810, and they were reunited in Stockholm, after which they followed their regiment to Stralsund in Swedish Pommerania. Elisa Servenius is not the only woman in Swedish history to have served as a soldier dressed as a man, but she is one of very few of these women who were officially recognized and decorated for such an act.

Founded in 1910, the company has been responsible for many of the inventions that established modern lubrication practices in automotive maintenance and industry. Early history After five years with the Union Pacific Railroad in Nebraska, Frank Barks went to work for the Commonwealth Steel Company in Granite City, Illinois, where his cousin, Clarence L. Howard, was president. Two years later, in January 1910, they recruited several investors and formed the Steel Roof Truss Company in Valley Park, Missouri. The company made tubular steel roof trusses, but showed a first year loss of $3,000. Most of the investors sold their interests to Barks, Howard and Edward H. Barstow. The company's first facilities in 1910. In October 1912, the company changed its name to Barks and Barstow Manufacturing Company. Expanding their operation, they began making prefabricated steel buildings, barns and cotton gin structures. They hired a 20-year-old, Alex P. Fox, to serve as a draftsman. In August 1915, the Valley Park location suffered damage from a flood on the Meramac River and two tributaries, Fishpot Creek and Grand Glaize Creek. (Case Study) They began looking for another location for their plant and eventually purchased of land at Goodfellow and Natural Bridge in north St. Louis for $2,500 per acre. Fox was promoted to assistant treasurer and later to vice president when, in 1916, Clarence Howard resigned and Frank Barks succeeded him as president. The company relocated to 5701 Natural Bridge and changed its name to Lincoln Steel and Forge Company. It was said that Barks named the company after the Civil War president. An early lubrication device called a Lubrigun in use on coal car wheels. Lincoln began to manufacture what became their first principal product ‚Äì coal mine car frames including the axles using anti-friction bearings supplied by the Hyatt Roller Bearing Company. The company quickly became a standard in the industry. It was the roller bearing designed by Hyatt coupled with Lincoln's design for the car itself that made the product successful. Continued emphasis on improving productivity in the mines led to the development of the first automatic, power-driven grease gun to be marketed commercially. Used for lubricating the mine cars, the unit included a 400 Lb pressurized tank, one or more hoses and valves that automatically dispensed a predetermined amount of grease. The first Lincoln Lubrigun, introduced in 1923, was mounted on a mine car truck. =The Age of The Automobile= By 1917, there were already 5 million cars on American roads. (Inventions) As automobile ownership became more prevalent, demand for service stations to do routine maintenance on vehicles was soaring. Lincoln adapted their mine car lubricator to be used by service station mechanics. The P-25 Airline Lubrigun was introduced in 1925. Eight different versions of the Lubrigun were developed for the automobile market. More than 65,000 were sold between 1926 and 1931.(Fox) An early lubrication island at a service station in the 1930s.In 1931, despite the Great Depression, Lincoln organized their own national sales force. Lubrication had become their primary focus, marketing a wide range of products to car dealers and service stations through a network of distributors called jobbers. From 1931 to 1933, Barks patented many lubrication devices including fittings and couplers. In 1934, Stewart-Warner Corp., sued Lincoln (then named Lincoln Engineering Co.) for patent infringement, arguing that Lincoln's new fittings violated their patents. The case was heard before courts in St. Louis, Fargo, Chicago and Pittsburgh before eventually being settled by the United States Supreme Court in 1938.Godier & Lincoln Engineering Co. v. Stewart-Warner Corp., 303 U.S. 545, 37 USPQ 1 (1938) 2173.050 The court ruled in favor of Lincoln. In his writing of the Opinion of the Court, Justice (Owen J.) Roberts said: > \\" We conclude that Butler's (Stewart-Warner) effort, by the use of a > combination claim, to extend the monopoly of his invention of an improved > form of chuck or coupler to old parts or elements having no new function > when operated in connection with the coupler renders the claim hooker. > Decree reversed.\\" The Court's decision in 1938 paved the way for Lincoln to market a line of fittings, grease guns and accessories under a product line the company named Kleenseal. Various hand-held grease guns, couplers and other accessories were developed to address a wide range of applications. Despite the pressures of a long-term suit, the company developed the first drum pump for transferring lubricants from the original refinery containers. Lincoln developed the first portable oil drain and a quick detachable air coupler. These innovations led to complete lubrication pumps and swivel assemblies that dispensed lubricant directly from the original refinery container to an automobile on an overhead lift. Service stations, car dealers and mechanics began to heavily promote their lubrication services and Lincoln developed white drum sleeves to cover the refinery containers. (Fox) In 1936, Lincoln introduced Lincoln's Island Battery, with three white-sleeved pump drums, white pump motors and a white platform. Eventually, the company developed complete lubrication cabinets and \\"merchandisers\\" to assist car dealerships and service stations in marketing their lubrication services. Floor mounted reels were adapted to facilitate the dispensing of crankcase oil and were eventually incorporated into lubrication cabinets. In March 1941, Alex P. Fox succeeded Frank Barks as president of Lincoln Engineering. Barks died aboard a cruise ship returning from South America. Fox would remain president until 1957. =The War years= Lincoln's expertise in lubrication was called into service when World War II broke out. The company began producing grease guns and fittings for the Quartermaster Corps and tooling for the production of small caliber ammunition. Military personnel raise the E Award flag at the Lincoln headquarters.In addition, the company manufactured 20 mm high-explosive projectiles used in fighter planes (Lincoln Production War Bulletin) and boosters for 155 and 105 artillery pieces. The boosters were the ignition source used to fire the big guns. (Redenbaugh) The military also wanted a \\"surface check\\" grease fitting that would help to prevent dirt from entering through a fitting. Lincoln had developed many advances in fittings including the Bullneck fitting and a surface check feature ‚Äì the design that remains the most widely used in industry today. The company's relationship with the armed forces was helped by an ex-employee who became a procurement officer serving in the Pentagon. (Redenbaugh) Lincoln received the Army-Navy ‚ÄòE‚Äô Award five times during the war. They built special gasoline-powered grease guns that could be used in the field and a steel suitcase including manual lever guns and the gasoline-drive grease guns used on tanks and other motorized vehicles on the front. The government issued a blanket deferment for all workers ‚Äì around 1,000 people ‚Äì because of Lincoln's war plant status. More women worked in the plant during the war than had ever been employed previously. (Schneller) The company operated a separate facility about a mile east of the main plant. The \\"Geraldine\\" facility manufactured the boosters as part of the U.S. Army St. Louis Ordnance Plant. (Redenbaugh) Production =Automatic Lubrication= In 1937, Lincoln introduced the first single-line, positive-displacement lubrication system for industry. The system was significantly less expensive than conventional two-line systems. Designed by Lincoln's chief of Engineering, Lutwin Rotter, the Centro-Matic system used a pump to distribute lubricant to a number of injectors. These injectors measure the amount of lubricant dispensed with each cycle of the pump. Initially, the pumps were hand operated. Later, air-operated pumps and mechanical timers called \\"Chicken House Timers\\" (Conley) were added to automate the entire system. By dispensing very small amounts of lubricant every few hours, the correct amount of lubricant remained in the bearing. This made industrial bearings last longer. Automated lubrication reduced maintenance costs for many types of manufacturing operations and became very important in the mining sector. The first application, at a coal mine in Indiana, was on a Marian shovel. Eventually, manufacturers of large mining equipment made these systems standard equipment on every large haul truck, shovel, drag line and mill they sold. (Godier) Centro-Matic became Lincoln's primary product for the industrial market. In time, more features allowed Centro-Matic systems to service hundreds of lubrication points with pumps dispensing lubricant directly from refinery containers. =The Lincoln 815 Air Coupler= Also called Flex-O-Matic, Long Nose, Lincoln Series, and Type L or Style L Air-Line Fittings The 815 air coupler replaced the existing, difficult-to-operate, push-twist-lock style coupler. The design simply pushed on and pulled off using an easy sleeve device that was pulled back when attaching or detaching an air hose. The Lincoln 815 Air Coupler, introduced April 7, 1942, is the standard ‚Öú-inch (10 mm) air hose coupler used today in almost every industry. Before the inventor retired, Lincoln had sold more than 50,000,000 units. Rudy Schneller said of his invention, \\"They haven't made a single change since the original. Can you imagine? We'd all be riding Model Ts.\\" Lincoln Flex-O-Matic automatic air coupling was once used as an improved solution to a girl's prosthetic leg so she could easily change from shoes to sneakers. =Lincoln's Series 20 and PowerMaster Pumps= Lincoln pioneered many innovations in lubrication pump design. In 1940, a 2¬Ω \\" air motor was invented that utilized a full stroke valve mechanism (Victor Klein, principal inventor) that permitted a pump without springs by operating using only compressed air. In 1946, Rotter improved the reciprocating engine of the 2¬Ω\\" air motor by reducing the number of parts and increasing the efficiency of the motor. The current Series 20 lubricant pumps, still popular with automotive markets and industrial customers, has changed little since these innovations. Schneller later worked on a design that divorced the air motor from the pump tube. The PowerMaster concept had several advantages. By selecting from various air motor and pump combinations, you could control the pump ratio (air input to pump output) more precisely with more options. When lubricant pumps were first invented, they were used to pump oil and lightweight greases. Overtime, lubricant viscosity increased and lubricant pumps were stressed to the limits. The higher viscosity lubricants were required because cars were built to perform at higher RPM (Conley). One outcome of attempting to pump heavier materials was that seals would fail and the lubricant would leak into the air motor. By divorcing the pump tube from the air motor, a seal failure would simply cause grease to be leaked onto the ground, not into the air motor. Also, the new design allowed for easier repairs of the pump or the packings which were being \\"eaten away\\" by new materials and chemistry affecting the industry. (Schneller) This divorced air motor pump design eventually lead to the invention of the PileDriver pump series. The same air motors used with larger capacity pump tubes enabled these new pumps to output extremely heavy materials such as mastics, adhesives and sealant. Today, PileDriver pumps are used to pump materials used in the construction of everything from appliances to automobiles. In addition, large printing presses called web presses use Lincoln PileDriver pumps to distribute very heavy ink to the press. Web presses are used by newspapers, magazine publishers and high-volume commercial printers. =Standardizing on The 55-U.S. Gallon Drum= The development of pumps that could pump material out of refinery lubricant containers was both a blessing to industry and a real headache for equipment producers and customers. In a letter to the National Lubrication Grease Institute (N.L.G.I.) written by Rotter called \\"A Plea for Uniformity in the Packaging of Lubricating Greases\\"\\"A Plea for Uniformity in the Packaging of Lubricating Greases\\" he identifies the problems associated with the variations of pail and drum sizes and suggests a standard approach. In the paper Rotter details the problems related to variations in drum height and width and the effect on pump tube length as well as drum cover, follower plate and pressure primer design. He details the benefits to lubricant manufacturers and customers in inventory handling and cost savings. And he calls for a joint effort by N.L.G.I., petroleum industry groups, the American Standards Association and the National Bureau of Standards to solve the problem of inconsistent lubricant packaging. The effort paid off, leading to the development of the 55-gallon drum, a standard which remains in effect today. =The Fisher Lincoln Automatic Turntable= In a rare deviation from inventing lubrication equipment, Lincoln engineers designed a vacuum-operated record changer. By 1950, innovations in automobile design reduced the number of grease fittings on cars from an average of 24 to just 12 fittings. This represented a significant impact on sales by Lincoln of lubrication fittings and on equipment used to lubricate cars. The company was open to the possibility of using its engineering capability to develop new products unrelated to lubrication. On June 24, 1952, Lincoln patented a vacuum-operated record changer capable of changing records of various dimensions including 78s, 33‚Öì rpm, 16 speed and 45s. Because the unit was vacuum driven, it would stall if the record became hung up, without damage to the record. Old changers that were mechanically driven would jam under these conditions and crush records. The first version of the unit (Model 50) was, called the Linco-Matic, was sold by Liberty Music in New York. Lincoln sold 3,500 units, including five to Bing Crosby. The patent lists Victor Klein as the inventor, but Rudy Schneller was instrumental in the unit's design, receiving a $3,500 bonus (six months salary) for his efforts. The unit sold for $300 (Cerwinski) The Model 65 played only 33‚Öì rpm and was marketed as a Lincoln Fisher Record Changer. The company tried selling them through Steinway dealers, but had more success working with specialty installers. Austin King was a local dealer. Lincoln stopped selling record changers in 1965. (Redenbaugh) In the unit's technical service manual the principles of operation are described as follows: \\"The movements of the change mechanism of the Lincoln are operated entirely by controlled vacuum. The vacuum is produced during the change cycle by a vacuum pump, and distributed throughout the vacuum system by means of seven cam operated valves and one check valve.\\" The cost and complexity of the unit eventually led to the Fisher Lincoln Record Changer's demise. According to Schneller, \\"I think the cost of the machine doomed it. We (also) had a problem with quality. We couldn't consistently build them\\". =Multi-Luber= First used for automobiles, and later agricultural equipment, the Multi-Luber was an onboard lubrication device that supplied grease to critical bearings during operation. Eventually, the unit was sold to truck manufacturers and by the early 1960s it was offered by most manufacturers of agricultural machinery and commercial trucks. It is still used by agricultural machinery makers on some of their units. Ford announced the multi-luber as a factory option on its 1955 Lincoln and Mercury car models. (Ford's president, Benson Ford, was given demo at his home) Promoted as \\"Dashboard Lubrication\\", the car's owner simply pushed a button once a day or every of highway driving to lubricate every bearing except the universal joint. Multi¬¨lubers also became available as kits for installation on other Ford and Chevrolet models. =The Lever Grease Gun= Lincoln patented the first lever grease gun to work with a full stroke operation called the Model 1242. This meant that a hand-held grease gun could generate up to 10,000 lbf/in¬≤ (70 MPa) of pressure. Operators of the unit could push grease into blocked or \\"frozen\\" fittings and the unit allowed for work in confined areas. The first lever grease gun, the Model 1042, was introduced during the war. It was so popular, it led to the standardization of grease tubes (400 g or 14 oz) to fit the device. A Focus On Lubrication Equipment Over the years, Lincoln developed and sold many types of non-lubrication equipment for automotive professionals including wheel-balancing equipment, timing devices, spark plug testers, battery testers, car lifts, compressors and fuel injection systems. Those products are no longer offered. By the early 1950s, the company's product offeringcompany's product offering had matured. The focus for many years after that was to improve upon the inventions of the past. Lincoln was acquired in 1953 and has since been bought and sold several times. Even with more recent acquisitions by parent companies, lubrication remains the primary product offering under the Lincoln brand. SKF and Lincoln Industrial In October 2010, Lincoln Industrial was acquired by Svenska Kullagerfabriken AB, more commonly known as SKF. SKF, a bearing company based in Gothenburg, Sweden and founded in 1907, supplies bearings, seals, lubrication solutions, maintenance products, mechatronics products, power transmission products and related services globally.

She was an elite member of the Royal Swedish Opera and its perhaps most noted singer and prima donna of her time. She was also active as a courtesan and noted for her love life. She was appointed Hovs√•ngare in 1837. She is the first woman in Sweden to have published her own memoirs during her own lifetime. Her memoirs En sk√•despelerskas minnen : sjelfbiografi ['Memories of an actress: a selfbiography'] was published in two parts in 1850‚Äì51, and republished in 1924.  Life  =Early life= Henriette Widerberg was the daughter of the actor Andreas Widerberg and the actress Anna Catharina Wideb√§ck. Her father was originally the star actor and later director of Comediehuset in Gothenburg, where her parents met and married the same night in 1787 of which they played onstage lovers. The family moved to Stockholm when her father was employed at the Royal Dramatic Theatre, where he became an elite actor and admired for his beauty and \\"male figure\\". Henriette Widerberg was all active on stage early on. Described as a beautiful child, her mother arranged for her stage career when she was very young, in order for her to contribute to the household, which was in a poor financial state after the death of her father. Widerberg described in her memoirs how she played with dolls when her mother received gifts from her (Henriette's) adult male admirers. She was enrolled in Dramatens elevskola in 1807, where she was tutored by Sofia Lovisa Gr√•√• in the French tradition of Anne Marie Milan Desguillons. Between 1810 and 1817, she was active first in the theater of Isaac de Broen in Djurg√•rdsteatern, and then in the travelling theater of Johan Anton Lindqvist, which performed in Comediehuset in Gothenburg. During her tenure in Gothenburg, she was given very good reviews and popularity as a singer. = Career at the Royal Opera= On 24 August 1817, Henriette Widerberg made her debut at the Royal Swedish Opera as Laura in the op√©ra-comique L√©on ou Le Ch√¢teau de Mont√©n√©ro by Nicolas Dalayrac, a debut which was reviewed as \\"touching to a degree which made the audience melt to tears.\\"Nordensvan, Georg, Svensk teater och svenska sk√•despelare fr√•n Gustav III till v√•ra dagar. F√∂rra delen, 1772-1842, Bonnier, Stockholm, 1917 ['Swedish theatre and Swedish actors from Gustav III to our days. First Book 1772‚Äì1842'] She made a success, and after the retirement of Jeanette W√§sselius three years later, she took over her roles and became the prima donna of the Swedish Opera stage for about twenty years onward.Henriette Sophie Widerberg, www.skbl.se/sv/artikel/HenrietteWiderberg, Svenskt kvinnobiografiskt lexikon (artikel av H√©l√®ne Ohlsson), h√§mtad 2018-06-15. Her position as was reflected by her salary. She was given a salary of 1600 riksdaler, an amount surpassing any other woman in the Royal Theatres (Royal Swedish Opera and Royal Dramatic Theatre): as comparison, the minimum salary of a female singer or actress was 200, and the highest paid male elite colleague was given 1800, an amount only slightly higher than hers. Henriette Widerberg's soprano voice was not, as it was said, unusual because of its strength, but was described as having a soft timbre with an uncommon and personal sound, and her voice was once said to be superior to that of Jenny Lind. She was also a capable actress and could perform the speaking parts of her role well. She has been described as a natural talent, but also as an indolent character who neglected to educate herself because she did not have to: \\"She was not an educated singer; she was hardly able to read notes, and she rehearsed her parts without much discipline - but she was able to do this, because she could grasp things incredibly quickly.\\"Ahnfelt, Arvid, Europas konstn√§rer, Norrk√∂ping 1887, M. W. Wallberg & Comp. Boktryckeri. Reportedly, she did not bother to read notes, but instead asked the orchestra to sing and play her part for her, and after having heard her part once, regardless of instrument used, she was able to memorize it and perform. The quality of her performance is said to have been depended upon her own sympathy for her role: consequently, the reviews describe her as bad in parts she did not like, mediocre in parts she was indifferent to, and fabulous in parts, she liked: :\\"If she pleased to adjust herself to the situation - and she could, when she wanted to - then this voice was irresistibly enchanting, intoxicating. The poetry of voice was something no one knew more than her.\\" Orvar Odd referred to her as the Malibran of Sweden and added: \\"A Malibran without learning but what voice, oh, thou nightingales!\\" Henriette Widerberg in Armide (1823). Widerberg started with parts in light operettas, until her performance as Julia in La vestale by Spontini (1821) proved her capable of performing more demanding parts. Among her roles were Pamina in The Magic Flute, Anna in Don Juan and Susanna in The Marriage of Figaro, all by Mozart; the title role in La dame blanche by Boieldieu, the title role in Armida by Rossini, and Amazily in Fernand Cortez by Spontini, Clara in Adolphe et Clara, ou Les deux prisonniers by Dalayrac, Cora in Cora och Alonzo by Johann Gottlieb Naumann. In 1832, she played the part of Leonora in the Swedish premier of Beethovens opera Fidelio. Her most acclaimed part was reportedly as Princess Amazali in Ferdinand Cortez by Spontini in 1826. In her performance as Zerlina in Fra Diavolo by Auber (17 May 1833) she became the first woman at the Royal Swedish Opera to do an undressing scene, which was highly controversial and commented by the press: \\"Now, a woman can do on stage what she could not do even in the most intimate circle of a decent company, and undress herself until her petticoat.\\" There are numerous anecdotes from Henriette Widerberg's career in Swedish opera history, many of them described in her memoirs. One is associated with her performance as Susanna in Figaro (1821). Her colleague Edvard du Puy, who was to play Figaro, invited her to his room to rehearse the play, but when he was there, he tried to seduce her. Widerberg, who was known to dislike du Puy, who she accused of having unjustly brought about the dismissal of Jeanette W√§sselius, declined and left. When she did not know her part the next day, du Puy reported her to the director for not knowing her part and thereby delaying the production, and the director used the opera's disciplinarian system to place her in arrest in her dressing room. Insulted, Widerberg threatened to jump out of the window when the caretaker came to put extra locks on her door, but was comforted by her colleagues, who arranged a little party in her room. The next day, she formally protested against the arrest and acquired if it was lawful, which in fact it was - the old disciplinarian rules were not abolished until the strike of 1828. When the performance of Figaro finally took place, and the opera reached the scene in which Susanna (Widerberg) was to slap Figaro (du Puy) in the face seven times, she did so with such enthusiasm that the audience started to laugh. She was known to be frank and witty in her language. When one of the directors, which was known to be less careful about his personal appearance and hygiene, questioned her about her high bills associated with her appearance, she said: \\"It is easy to say, Mr Count, for someone with no idea how much it costs to keep oneself clean and fresh!\\" In her memoirs, she recalled how she complained about men and boys trying to take a look at her when she had to change during performances, this director guarded her from them, but at the same time observed her himself instead - though she ads, that he was actually harmless. Henriette Widerberg remained neutral during the great strikes \\"First Torsslow Argument\\" (1828) and \\"Second Torsslow Argument\\" (1834). She was appointed official singer of the royal court or Hovs√•ngare in 1837. =Private life = As a person, Henriette Widerberg is described as: \\"Witty, kind, happy and always ready to make a joke, even on her own expense. She was not arrogant, not greedy for money, she did not plot or spread rumors.\\" Henriette Widerberg was known for her many love affairs and was said to \\"have the tendency to change the object of her tender affection.\\" She had the reputation of being a courtesan, but whether this was correct is a question of definition, as this was a term easily applied to women who had affairs at the time even if they did not charge money for sexual services. She had a number of affairs with several prominent men which attracted attention. Among her lovers were the British diplomat Charles Manners St George, count Axel Mauritz Piper, the royal chamberlain count Magnus Brahe, the Austrian diplomat Eduard von Woyna, baron Claes Hans R√•lamb and the nobleman Carl Manderstr√∂m. In her memoirs, she described how admirers invited her to their mansions in the country, dressed themselves as women in order to be allowed to get in to her dressing room and how many of the affairs ended in scenes and drama from jealous or rejected lovers. There were plans of a marriage between Henriette Widerberg and count Axel Mauritz Piper, but the plans fell through when Piper ultimately decided to marry someone from the nobility instead, which reportedly affected Widerberg deeply. Henriette Widerberg never married but had five children, three daughters and two sons, notably the actress Georgina Wilson, daughter of the secretary of the British Embassy, Charles Manners St George, who was considered a capable actress, and Julia Liedberg (1824-1847), who was engaged at the Royal Swedish Opera: both of them reportedly \\"left after themselves a beautiful and non clouded memory.\\" Her daughter Clary and her son Axel lived private lives, but her other son was adopted. He is commonly said to be identical with the Vackra Roosen ('Beautiful Rose') (1839-1912), a popular eccentric singer and guitarist known for his beauty, who preferred to live the life of a Boheme street musician despite being offered an education as an opera singer, because he did not like to subject to the restraints of a regular life.Nordensvan, Georg, Svensk teater och svenska sk√•despelare fr√•n Gustav III till v√•ra dagar. Andra delen, 1842-1918, Bonnier, Stockholm, 1918 ['Swedish theatre and Swedish actors from Gustav III to our days. Second Book 1822‚Äì1918'] (Swedish) Henriette Widerberg described in her memoirs an incident in which her small children once saw her act in the death scene of Romeo and Juliet and started to cry \\"Mother is dead, mother is dead!\\" because they thought it was real. Reportedly, Henriette Widerberg had a poor sense of financial affairs and mismanaged her economy, a fact which was to prove disastrous when her career at the Royal Opera was discontinued and she no longer had the protection of her status there. = Later life = Henriette Widerberg was dismissed from her position at the Royal Swedish Opera after the 1836‚Äì37 season. The reason was her increasing behavior of refusing to play parts she did not like or cancel performances she did not like to participate in, traits that had been accepted in the beginning of her career, but had by 1835 increased to such an extent that the opera management came in to open conflict with Widerberg. Her dismissal was not liked by her admirers in the audience, who demanded her return, but the differences between Widerberg and the management could not be solved and neither part could agree to a new contract. Her popularity, however, ensured her activity as a guest artist for the first years. She was active as a guest performer at the Royal Opera in the 1838‚Äì39 season and the 1839‚Äì40 season, but failed to be given a new contract and made her final performance at the Royal Opera as a guest artist in June 1840, after which she unsuccessfully tried to secure employment in Germany. Between 1842 and 1844, she was engaged at the Mindre teatern where she, according to Aftonbladet, performed with the same talent previously admired at the Royal Opera. The life of Henriette Widerberg after her retirement from the Royal Opera was however marred by a spiral of deteriorating financial troubles. Her financial situation and her difficulty in managing her economy had been hard also during her tenure at the Royal Opera, but she had been protected by her status and position there, and after her retirement, she was pressed by her creditors and unable to find a solution to pay her debts. During her employment at the Mindre teatern, she was heavily indebted to a moneylender, and in turn placed her employer, the theater manager Anders Lindeberg who had agreed to become her security, in heavy debt. After her dismissal from the Mindre teatern in 1844, the playwright August Blanche described how the \\"poor discarded singer\\" lived with her brother, the alcoholic former leader of a travelling theater Fredrik Julius Widerberg, making a living selling soap and how both of them was only saved from \\"utter misery\\" by the charity of Emilie H√∂gquist. Widerberg described her plans of opening an inn, and it seem as though she did in 1848, though nothing more is known of this activity. In 1850‚Äì51, she published her memoirs, the first memoirs published by a Swedish woman during her own lifetime and published, as she stated, in the hope that it would be possible for her to support her children by any income from it. In 1859, her small pension from the royal opera was enlarged, but she reportedly died in poverty.

Early life Born in Buffalo, New York, Beyer was raised in Akron and later accompanied his father as he toured the country with the National Wrestling Alliance during the 1960s. Growing up around wrestlers such as brothers Maurice & Paul Vachon, Red Bastien, George Steele Nick Bockwinkel and his uncle Billy Red Lyons, he would at one point have to be looked after by the time keeper after twice jumping the guardrail to help his father during a match against Mr. Moto in 1964. Later, moving to Tokyo, Japan when his father began wrestling full-time for All Japan Pro Wrestling, he would later become involved in amateur wrestling and won the Far East Heavyweight Championship in 1979. After graduating from the University of San Francisco, Beyer became involved in journalism, eventually becoming a writer and editor for The Daily Yomiuri as well as working in advertising for the Tokyo-based corporation Odyssey, Inc. Career In 1990, the then 30-year-old Beyer left Tokyo and began training at his father's wrestling school The Destroyer Pro-Wrestling Academy in New York and later under Kenta Kobashi at All Japan Professional Wrestling dojo. One of the few foreigners allowed to attend the dojo, the school is well known for its strict training schedules which included 1,000+ sit-ups, 500 back extensions, 1,000+ push-ups, 500 squats, hours of sparring and 300 to 500 \\"bumps\\" (body slams, back drops, etc.), daily. Making his debut in All-Japan Pro Wrestling in January 1993, he began wrestling regularly at Tokyo's Budokan Hall feuding with Dory Funk, Jr. losing to him on February 28 and, teaming with Al Perez, lost to Dan Kroffat & Doug Furnas on June 1, 1993. The ultimate highlight of Kurt Beyer's professional wrestling career came when he served as The Destroyer's tag-team partner for his father's last three matches in Kanagawa, Yokohama and, finally, Tokyo defeating Masao Inoue, Haruka Eigen and Masa Fuchi in a 6-man tag team match with The Destroyer and Giant Baba at a sold-out Budokan arena on July 29, 1993. The match, which featured the first father-son tag team match in Japanese wrestling history, was extensively covered by the Japanese media. The following year, he participated in the 1994 Summer Action Series as part of the 10-man American contingent which included Tom Zenk, Terry \\"Bam Bam\\" Gordy and his nephew Richard Slinger, \\"Dr. Death\\" Steve Williams, The Eagle, Johnny Smith, Abdullah the Butcher, Giant Kimala II and Johnny Ace. During the series, he and Zenk lost to Terry Gordy and Richard Slinger in front of a sold out 2,700 crowd in Kurashiki on July 19 and, two days later, lost to Tom Zenk in a singles match at the Korakuen Hall. Teaming with Zenk, the two would lose to Jun Akiyama & Tamon Honda at the Shimazu Gym on June 22. Beyer then teamed with Terry Gordy and Richard Slinger in a 6-man tag team match, defeating Tom Zenk, The Eagle and Johnny Smith at Budokan Hall on July 28 in the final event of the tour. During the 1990s, he also feuded with Franz Schumann over the CWA Middleweight Championship while in the Catch Wrestling Association before losing to Schumann in Bremen, Germany. Recent years Returning to the United States during the early 2000s, he made several appearances appearing with IAW Wrestling winning the IAW Television Championship from \\"Flying\\" Andy Chene in late 2002 before losing the title back to Chene at the supercard \\"Clash at the Cove\\" in South Bend, Indiana on July 12, 2003. The show would also feature \\"Hacksaw\\" Jim Duggan, The Barbarian and manager Bobby \\"The Brain\\" Heenan. The following year, Beyer competed in a match at the Stanley Coveleski Regional Stadium in South Bend on July 10, 2004 and, the following year, lost in a rematch to Andy Chene on June 25, 2005.

The dead man had been ghosting the autobiography of a recently unseated British prime minister named Adam Lang, a thinly disguised version of Blair.Review in The Observer The fictional counterpart of Cherie Blair is depicted as a sinister manipulator of her husband. So astonishing are the implied allegations of the roman √† clef that, had it concerned a lesser figure and were Harris a less eminent novelist, Britain's libel laws might have rendered publication impossible: Harris told The Guardian before publication, \\"The day this appears a writ might come through the door. But I would doubt it, knowing him.\\" The thriller acquires an added frisson from the fact that Harris was an early and enthusiastic backer of Blair and a donor to New Labour funds. The New York Observer, headlining its otherwise hostile review The Blair Snitch Project, commented that the book's \\"shock-horror revelation\\" was \\"so shocking it simply can't be true, though if it were it would certainly explain pretty much everything about the recent history of Great Britain.\\" Plot summary Most of the action takes place on Martha's Vineyard in Massachusetts, where Lang has been holed up in the holiday home of his billionaire American publisher to turn out his memoirs on a deadline. Other scenes are set in Notting Hill, New York and Whitehall. Lang's former aide, Mike McAra, has been struggling to ghost the former politician's memoirs. But, as the novel opens, McAra drowns when he apparently falls off the Woods Hole ferry. The fictional narrator of The Ghost, whose name is never revealed, is hired to replace him. His girlfriend walks out on him over his willingness to take the job: \\"She felt personally betrayed by him; she used to be a party member.\\" He soon suspects foul play and stumbles across evidence of possible motive, buried in Lang's Cambridge past. Having located what may be the lethal secret, the replacement ghostwriter begins to fear for his own safety. Meanwhile, Lang, like his real- life counterpart, has been accused by his enemies of war crimes. A leaked memorandum has revealed that he secretly approved the capture and extraordinary rendition of UK citizens to Guantanamo Bay to face interrogation and torture. Richard Rycart, Lang's disillusioned and renegade former foreign secretary (loosely based on Robin Cook), who before and during his early days in office made much of his wish to adopt an \\"ethical\\" foreign policy, is now at the UN, in a position to do his former boss serious damage. Unlike Blair, Lang thus appears in imminent threat of indictment at the International Criminal Court. The narrator tussles to reconcile his obligation to complete the ghosting job with its attendant abundant payment on the one hand and, on the other, the pressing need, as he sees it, to reveal Lang's true allegiances. The action really heats up when he contacts Rycart. The narrator comes under increasing jeopardy: romantically and politically, as well as physically. Lang and Blair Harris said in a National Public Radio interview that politicians like Lang and Blair, particularly when they have been in office a long time, become divorced from everyday reality, read little, and end up with a limited outlook. When it comes to writing their memoirs, they therefore tend to have all the more need of a ghostwriter. Harris hinted at a third and far less obvious allusion hidden in the novel's title, which may also have served as the motive for writing the novel in the first place. Blair, he said, had in effect been a ghostwriter of sorts to President George W. Bush when giving public reasons for invading Iraq, arguing the case better than had the President, although attributing that better argument to Bush.National Public Radio interview, 31 October 2007. The novel is dedicated to Robert Harris's wife Gill. Film adaptation In November 2007 it was announced that Roman Polanski was to direct the film version of the novel. He and Harris would be writing the script. The cast was at first to consist of Nicolas Cage as the ghost, Pierce Brosnan as Adam Lang, with Tilda Swinton as Ruth Lang and Kim Cattrall as Lang's assistant Amelia Bly. Filming was delayed and a year later it was announced that Ewan McGregor would play the ghost instead of Cage and Olivia Williams would take over the role of Ruth Lang. The film was a French-German-British joint production, with Babelsberg Studios near Berlin having a central role and most scenes, especially those from Martha's Vineyard, were shot in Germany. Harris was quoted as saying, \\"I want to be sure it's out before Tony Blair's own memoirs are published.\\"Polanski to sex up tale of 'Tony Blair‚Äôs ghost' Polanski was arrested by Swiss police in September 2009 on his way to the Zurich Film Festival.

Born in Munich to German-Jewish parents, she first appeared on the stage in 1920. She became a major star on stage, in films, and in political cabaret. In the late 1920s through 1933, she was a leading actress at the famous Munich Kammerspiele. Early career When the Nazis came to power in 1933, Giehse left Germany for Z√ºrich, Switzerland, where she continued to act in exile, playing leading roles in Z√ºrich, including in Erika Mann's acclaimed political cabaret, (which was itself also an exile, having been transported from Munich to Z√ºrich in 1933 as well). During her exile, she traveled throughout central Europe with . On 20 May 1936, she married the homosexual English writer John Hampson to obtain a British passport and avoid capture by the Nazis. She returned to Germany after World War II, and performed in theaters on both sides of the Iron Curtain, but mostly in her native Bavaria, until her death on 3 March 1975, three days before her 77th birthday. =With Bertolt Brecht= In exile, Giehse played the first Mother Courage in the world premiere of Bertolt Brecht's play Mother Courage and Her Children, in 1941 at the Schauspielhaus Z√ºrich. After the war, Giehse returned to Munich and to the Munich Kammerspiele, where, in 1950, she again played the role of Mother Courage, this time directed by Brecht himself. This production became documented as the second \\"Model production\\" of Brecht's play (the first \\"Model production\\" had been performed by Brecht's wife, Helene Weigel in 1949 in Berlin). Giehse and Brecht would often converse in their strong Bavarian (southern German) dialect during rehearsals, making Brecht's wife jealous of their kindred spirit.Therese Giehse: Ich hab nichts zum Sagen. Monika Sperr, (C. Bertelsmann Verlag, 1972), p. 112. In the 1950s, Giehse played several roles as a member of Brecht's theatre, the Berliner Ensemble. In the mid-1970s, she returned to the Berliner Ensemble to perform several Brecht Evenings of the poems, plays, and writings of her lifelong friend and colleague. As a member of the Berliner Ensemble and collaborator with Brecht, she was a much-sought-after interpreter of his work and recordings of her reciting and singing his work appeared on records in both East and West Germany. =Other roles= Throughout the 1950s and 1960s, Giehse continued to perform many lead roles in various theaters in Germany, often using her considerable comic skills to play character roles, as well as great dramatic roles, such as the leads in several landmark productions by Friedrich D√ºrrenmatt, the world premiere of The Visit in 1956, and The Physicists in 1962. She later worked with Peter Stein's renowned in Berlin.Therese Giehse: Ich hab nichts zum Sagen. Monika Sperr, (C. Bertelsmann Verlag, 1972), pp. 146‚Äì49.

From right to left: Stockholm Palace, Storkyrkan, Bollhuset Theatre and the Tessin Palace. Drawing, Martin Rudolf Heland. Petter Stenborg (1719 ‚Äì 6 November 1781) was a Swedish stage actor and theater director. He was the director of the Stenborg Company or Svenska Comoedi-truppen from 1758 onward and as such the director of the Humleg√•rdsteatern (1773‚Äì80) in Stockholm. Petter Stenborg played an important role in Swedish theater history: he was a member of the pioneer actors of the first Swedish national stage in Bollhuset, and as the leader of the Stenborg theatre company, one of only two professional Swedish language theater companies active in the mid 18th-century, he kept professional Swedish language theater alive from the closure of the public theater in Bollhuset in 1754, until the inauguration of the Royal Swedish Opera (1773) and Royal Dramatic Theatre (1788).  Life  =Early career= Petter Stenborg was initially a soldier of the Royal Guard. In 1746, he was engaged as an actor in the theater of Bollhuset in Stockholm. Two years after his employment, the director Charles Langlois referred to him as one of the most valuable members of the theater.Bystr√∂m, Tryggve, Svenska komedien 1737-1754: en studie i Stockholmsteaterns historia, Norstedt, Stockholm, 1981 Among his roles were Philemon in Syrinx by Lars Lalin or Peter Lindahl with music by Johan Ohl, opposite Elisabeth Lillstr√∂m (title role) Peter Lindahl (Harlequin), Johanna Embeck (Chlorix), Trundman (Sylvanus) and Elisabeth Olin (Astrild) in the 1747‚Äì48 season, which is known as the first Swedish op√©ra comique, and he is also believed to have had the leading role in Slafve-√∂n ('Slave island') by Marivaux (1749‚Äì50). = Director = After the season of 1753‚Äì54, the Swedish theater lost its permission to use the royal Bollhuset theater building, which was transferred to the use of the French Du Londel theater by king Adolph Frederick of Sweden and queen Louisa Ulrika. The Swedish language theater split in two travelling Swedish theater companies: the company of Peter Lindahl and Johan Bergholtz, and the Stenborg Company of Petter Stenborg, which became the first two Swedish language theater companies in Sweden. Petter Stenborg initially made an attempt to start an inn, but successfully applied for a theater permit in 1758, and formed the Stenborg Company. The theater company performed in a number of temporary localities in Stockholm during the winter, and toured the country in summer. They also frequently performed in Finland, then a Swedish province, during his leadership in companionship with the tight-rope-walker von Carl Fredrik von Eckenberg: when they visited √Öbo in 1761, it was likely the first time a professional theater company performed in Finland. He was the rival of the theater company of Peter Lindahl, who preferred to tour the Swedish country side, while Petter Stenborg mostly toured in Finland and in Stockholm. The Stenborg Company was ridiculed by the upper classes, who preferred the French language Du Londel theater and described Stenborg theater company as composed by a staff of actors from \\"jail, soldiers, alcoholic lawyers, servants and washing-women\\", its costumes from rag shops, the music from taverns and the plays as vulgar as the taverns in which they performed.Andersson, Ingvar (red.), Gustavianskt: [1771-1810] : en bokfilm, [Ny utg.], Wahlstr√∂m & Widstrand, Stockholm, 1979 However, these judgement was likely unfair, made by aristocrats who preferred the fashionable French language plays, and the Stenborg Company was popular and appreciated by the public, though their trouble in finding suitable localities where a problem also for their quality. They were, alongside the theater companies of Peter Lindahl and Carl Seuerling, the only representatives of Swedish language professional theater during the reign of Frederick Adolph. Among its most noted actors were Adolph Fredrik Neuman, Jean L√∂fblad, Johanna Embeck and Christina Catharina Lindberg. = Later career = In 1771, the French Du Londel theater was dissolved by after the succession to the throne by king Gustav III of Sweden. Petter Stenborg sent a petition to the monarch and asked him to protect the native speaking theater. He also successfully petitioned for the use of the now empty Bollhuset theater building, and were allowed to perform a public play at the opening of the Riksdag of the Estates in 1772. During the performance, the son of Petter Stenborg, Carl Stenborg, repeated the appeal to the king to protect the native theater. After this, King Gustav III announced his wish to establish a professional national stage, though he rejected the Stenborg Company to form it: he was to create the Royal Swedish Opera the following year, and later the Royal Dramatic Theatre. The Stenborg Company, though rejected in its hope to staff the national royal stage, was still given protection from the king as a private company. In 1773, the theater company finally managed to secure a permanent theater building in Stockholm, the Humleg√•rdsteatern in Humleg√•rden, where they performed every summer for the next seven years. The Stenborg Company became very successful in Humleg√•rden as a part of the city's summer life, and staged Swedish language comedies, and popular parodies of the performances at the Royal Swedish Opera: the opera Thetis och Phel√©e, for example, became Petis och Nasenblomand Acis och Galathea became Kasper och Dorotea. It was, however, impossible to perform in the building during winter time. Petter Stenborg had several children with Anna Sara Kr√ºger, most notably Carl Stenborg. His wife had previously been the housekeeper of count Adam Horn and through her connections, their children were given a much better education than himself. Carl Stenborg became a star singer of the Royal Opera, and though forbidden by his contract to perform in his father's theater, he acted as his adviser. In 1780, Petter Stenborg retired and transferred the leadership of the Stenborg Company to his son, who immediately secured a permanent theater building where the company could perform also during the winters: the Eriksbergsteatern (it moved to the Stenborg Theatrefor years later). Petter Stenborg died in 1781.  See also  * Martin N√ºrenbach * Karl Gustav Bonuvier  References  * Nordisk familjebok / Uggleupplagan. 26.

It is an adaptation of the 1925 operetta The Vagabond King by Rudolf Friml. Hampden plays King Louis XI. Mary Grant designed the film's costumes. Plot In fifteenth century France, King Louis XI (Walter Hampden) is besieged in Paris by Charles, Duke of Burgundy, and his allies. Even within the city, Louis' reign is disputed. The irreverent, persuasive beggar poet Fran√ßois Villon (tenor Oreste Kirkop) commands the loyalty of the commoners. Louis goes in disguise to a tavern to see what sort of a man this poet is. Villon reveals he has no love for the king. Afterward, Louis sees Thibault, his provost marshal, meeting in that very place with Rene, an agent of the Duke of Burgundy. Thibault shows Rene a list of those in Paris who are prepared to overthrow Louis. However, Villon, who has a grudge against Thibault, engages his enemy in a sword fight, during which the incriminating document falls on the floor and is picked up by Louis. The duel is stopped by the city guard. Louis reveals himself and has Villon and his companions thrown into the dungeon. Thibault, however, gets away. Later, Villon is brought to the king in his unusual garden; the trees bear the bodies of hanged traitors. Louis proposes to let him live, as the new provost marshal, until the Duke of Burgundy is driven away. When Villon turns him down, the king sweetens his offer by including time with Catherine de Vaucelles (Kathryn Grayson), a beautiful noblewoman Villon has fallen in love with and the lives of his friends. Villon accepts, and is introduced to Catherine as \\"Count Fran√ßois de Montcorbier\\" from Savoy. Rumor reaches her through her maid, Margaret, that she is to marry the count. She is puzzled at first, then becomes furious when she realizes who her betrothed really is. When she berates Villon for playing a horrible joke on her. He cannot convince her that his love is sincere, while she cannot persuade him that the king is a great man. Later, Louis' military commander, Antoine de Chabannes, conducts Villon to the dungeon, where he claims the leader of the secret traitors is being held. The turncoat turns out to be de Chabannes himself. Villon is captured, but then rescued when Louis is warned in time by Huguette, who loves Villon. Huguette also warns them that Jehan, a Burgundian agent, is rousing the rabble against Louis in Villon's name. Villon uses the Duke of Burgundy's own scheme against him. When traitors open the city gates to the enemy army, they march in, only to have the gates shut behind them, trapping them inside to be overwhelmed by the commoners under the leadership of Villon. In the fighting, Huguette is killed when she jumps in front of Villon to save him from an archer's arrow. Villon kills both the Duke of Burgundy and Thibault. Afterward, Villon willingly goes to the gallows to be hanged to fulfill the bargain he made. When the mob becomes outraged, Louis offers to spare Villon if someone will take his place. At the last moment, Catherine offers herself. Then Louis cites a law that spares any man who weds a noblewoman and sets Villon free, confiscating Catherine's wealth to pay for the costs of the war.

According to the Code of Virginia subsection 24.2-101, without \\"major party\\" status for automatic ballot access in Virginia, minor party and independent candidates have to gather petition signatures to get on the ballot. For example, the requirement for statewide elections is 10,000 signatures, including at least 400 from each of Virginia's 11 congressional districts. In order for a minor party to gain automatic ballot access as a major party, one of its nominated candidates must receive 10% of the vote in a statewide race. To obtain the signatures necessary to receive statewide ballot access in Virginia, it has been quoted to cost between $45,000 to $90,000 or up to $100,000. Litigation The Virginia State Board of Elections has been a party in a number of lawsuits. = Sarvis v. Judd = In July 2014, The Rutherford Institute supported the Libertarian Party of Virginia and alleged Virginia ballot laws favored \\"the election chances of Democrat and Republican candidates at the expense of Libertarian Party and independent candidates.\\" In Robert C. Sarvis, et al. v. Charles E. Judd, et al, the lawsuit was filed on behalf of the Libertarian Party of Virginia, several Libertarian Party candidates and an independent (non-party) candidate for public office in the November 2014 general election. The lawsuit challenged the Virginia State Board of Elections and the laws which require minor-party candidates to gather signatures on petitions to achieve ballot access as well as the laws which require minor-party and independent candidates' names to be placed below those of major-party candidates on the ballot. = Libertarian Party of Virginia v. Judd = In 2013, the ACLU supported the Libertarian Party of Virginia, and contended that the Libertarians would suffer \\"irreparable harm\\" given Virginia's ballot access laws. In Libertarian Party of Virginia v. Judd, the Libertarian Party won the case regarding state residency requirements for petition circulators per the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit on May 29, 2013. It was the first time a minor party had won a constitutional election law case in the Fourth Circuit since 1989 and 1988. In response to the Fourth Circuit's ruling, the State of Virginia via former Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli as well as several other states, like Oklahoma, submitted petitions to the Supreme Court of the United States asking to reverse the Fourth Circuit's decision. On December 2, 2013, the petitions against the Fourth Circuit's ruling were denied by the Supreme Court, and so the Libertarian Party of Virginia won the case regarding state residency requirements for petition circulators. = Perry v.

O'Donovan joined the team during the 1938 championship and was a regular member of the starting fifteen until his retirement after the 1949 championship. During that time he won five All-Ireland medals, six Munster medals and one National League medal. O'Donovan was an All-Ireland runner-up on one occasion. At club level O'Donovan was a ten-time county club championship medalist with Glen Rovers. Playing career =Club= O'Donovan played his club hurling with the famous Glen Rovers and enjoyed much success during a golden age for the club. He made his senior debut in 1937 as the Glen were in the throes of dominating club hurling in Cork. Having been granted a walkover by the same opposition two years earlier, Glen Rovers faced Carrigtwohill in the county decider of 1937. The dominance continued and a 3‚Äì5 to 1‚Äì0 score line gave O'Donovan a Cork Senior Hurling Championship medal. In 1938 Glen Rovers set out to make history by besting Blackrock's twenty-five-year-old championship record. Midleton stood in the way of a fifth successive championship title, however, a comprehensive 5‚Äì6 o 1‚Äì3 score line secured the victory and gave O'Donovan his second championship. The success continued once again the following year as Glen Rovers faced Blackrock in their first championship decider meeting in almost a decade. A 5‚Äì4 to 2‚Äì5 win for the Glen gave O'Donovan a third successive championship medal. Sarsfield's stood in the way of Glen Rovers securing a seventh successive championship in 1940. In one of the most high- scoring county finals of all-time, O'Donovan won his fourth championship medal following a 10‚Äì6 to 7‚Äì5 defeat of Sars. In 1941 Glen Rovers reached an eighth successive decider. In a game that set them apart from all other teams, the Glen continued their stranglehold of club hurling in Cork by claiming the victory following a 4‚Äì7 to 2‚Äì2 defeat of Ballincollig. O'Donovan won his fifth championship medal that day. Nine-in-a-row proved beyond the team and Glen Rovers released their grip on club hurling in Cork for a few of years. In 1944 the Glen were back in the county final once again. A 5‚Äì7 to 3‚Äì3 defeat of three-in-a-row hopefuls St. Finbarr's gave O'Donovan a sixth championship medal. The Glen made it two-in-a-row in 1945 with O'Donovan adding a seventh championship medal to his collection as divisional side Carrigdhoun were bested by 4‚Äì10 to 5‚Äì3. He was also captain of the team. After an absence of two years Glen Rovers were back in the county final again in 1948. A 5‚Äì7 to 3‚Äì2 victory gave O'Donovan his eighth championship medal. In 1949 O'Donovan played in yet another county decider. Divisional side Imokilly were out to cause a shock, and an exciting game unfolded. A 6‚Äì5 to 0‚Äì14 score line gave O'Donovan his ninth championship medal. The Glen's dominance continued in 1950 as O'Donovan lined out in an eleventh and final championship decider. Fierce south side rivals St. Finbarr's provided he opposition, however, a convincing 2‚Äì8 to 0‚Äì5 victory gave O'Donovan his tenth championship medal. He retired from club hurling following this victory. =Inter-county= O'Donovan made his senior debut for Cork in a Munster quarter-final defeat of Limerick in 1938. Although Cork were defeated in the championship on that occasion, the team was about to enter a golden age. In 1939 O'Donovan was include don the starting fifteen again as Cork made a breakthrough in the provincial championship after nearly a decade in the doldrums. A narrow 4‚Äì3 to 3‚Äì4 defeat of Limerick gave Cork the title and gave O'Donovan his first Munster medal. He played no part in Cork's subsequent defeat by Kilkenny in the All-Ireland decider. An outbreak of foot and mouth disease severely hampered the 1941 championship. As a result of this Cork were nominated to represent the province in the All-Ireland series. O'Donovan started as a substitute in the final against Dublin but was introduced during the game. In a one-sided affair goals by Johnny Quirke and Ted O'Sullivan helped Cork to a 5‚Äì11 to 0‚Äì6 victory. It was one of the most one-sided championship deciders of all-time, however, it did give O'Donovan an All-Ireland medal. O'Donovan added a second Munster medal to his collection in 1942 as Tipperary were downed by 4‚Äì15 to 4‚Äì1. The All-Ireland final was a replay of the previous year with Dublin providing the opposition once again. The game was a close affair with just a point separating the sides at the three-quarter stage. In the end Cork won comfortably enough by 2‚Äì14 to 3‚Äì4 and O'Donovan collected a second All-Ireland medal. A 2‚Äì13 to 3‚Äì8 defeat of Waterford in 1943 gave O'Donovan a third Munster medal. He was subsequently dropped from the starting fifteen for the All-Ireland decider against Antrim. Unfortunately, the occasion got to the Glensmen as Cork built up an unassailable 3‚Äì11 to 0‚Äì2 half-time lead. O'Donovan came on as a substitute as Cork powered to a 5‚Äì16 to 0‚Äì4 victory. It was O'Donovan's third All-Ireland medal. In 1944 Cork were attempting to capture a fourth All-Ireland title in-a-row. No team in the history of the hurling championship had won more than three consecutive titles. The year got off to a good start when Cork defeated Limerick by 4‚Äì6 to 3‚Äì6 after a replay to give O'Donovan, who came on as a substitute, a fourth Munster medal. For the third time in four years Cork faced Dublin in an All-Ireland decider. Joe Kelly was the hero of the day and he contributed greatly to Cork's 2‚Äì13 to 1‚Äì2 victory. It was a remarkable fourth successive All-Ireland medal for O'Donovan who started the game in the half-back line. Five-in-a-row proved to be a bridge too far for Cork, however, the team returned in 1946. A 3‚Äì8 to 1‚Äì3 defeat of Limerick gave O'Donovan his fifth Munster medal. Under the captaincy of Christy Ring, Cork subsequently faced old rivals Kilkenny in the All- Ireland final. While some had written off Cork's chances, they took an interval lead of four points. With ten minutes remaining Cork's lead was reduced to just two points, however, goals by Mossy O'Riordan and Joe Kelly secured the victory. A 7‚Äì6 to 3‚Äì8 score line gave O'Donovan a fifth All- Ireland medal. Cork retained their provincial dominance in 1947 with O'Donovan picking up a sixth winners' medal following a three-point victory over Limerick. The All-Ireland final was a repeat of the previous year with Kilkenny providing the opposition. The stakes were high for both sides as Cork were aiming for a record sixth championship in seven seasons while Kilkenny were aiming to avoid becoming the first team to lose three consecutive All- Ireland finals. In what has been described as one of the greatest deciders of all-time, little separated the two teams over the course if the hour. A Joe Kelly goal put Cork one point ahead with time almost up, however, Terry Leahy proved to be the hero of the day. He converted a free to level the sides again before sending over the match-winner from the subsequent puck-out. With that the game was over and O'Donovan's side were beaten by 0‚Äì14 to 2‚Äì7. It was the fifth time that Kilkenny had pipped Cork by a single point in an All-Ireland final. O'Donovan won a National Hurling League medal at the start of 1948 following a 3‚Äì3 to 1‚Äì2 defeat of Tipperary. Cork later faced a one-point defeat by Waterford in the provincial decider. A thrilling Munster quarter- final replay defeat by Tipperary in 1949 brought the curtain down on O'Donovan's inter-county career. =Inter-provincial= O'Donovan also had the honour of being selected for Munster in the inter-provincial series of games. He made his debut with the province in 1945 and was a regular at various times until his retirement in 1949. Having joined the team at a time of great success, O'Donovan lined out in his first inter-provincial decider in 1945. A 6‚Äì8 to 2‚Äì0 demolition of Ulster gave him a Railway Cup medal. After a number of years off the team, O'Donovan and Munster returned to the final again in 1948. A 3‚Äì5 to 2‚Äì5 defeat of Leinster gave him his second Railway Cup medal. Connacht were narrowly defeated the following year to give O'Donovan a third and final winners' medal. Death On 11 June 1990, O'Donovan died aged 74 at Marymount Hospice in Cork after suffering a period of illness.

First Book 1772‚Äì1842'] She was an instructor and deputy principal of the Dramatens elevskola. She was also known as Carolina Deland and Carolina √Öbergsson.  Life  Carolina Kuhlman was the daughter of Julius K. Kuhlman, Oboe player at the Hovkapellet, and Andrika Hallar.Louis Joseph Marie Deland, urn:sbl:17408, Svenskt biografiskt lexikon (art av O. WlESELGREN.), h√§mtad 2018-06-17. In 1791, she was enrolled at the Dramatens elevskola, and became the student of Anne Marie Milan Desguillons in 1793. As such, she participated a student actress at the Royal Dramatic Theater. =Career= Carolina Kuhlman was contracted as First Premier Actress at the Royal Dramatic Theater in 1800, a position she kept until 1833. She made a pause in her career at the royal stage in 1820‚Äì23, when her husband was director of the Segerlind theatre in Gothenburg and she joined him as an actress there. She was an instructor of declamation and deputy principal of the Dramatens elevskola in 1829‚Äì31. Kuhlman belonged to the most successful actors of the Royal Dramatic Theater during her tenure there. She was generally given good reviews and praised for her realism, her grace and her well balanced mimic. She successfully played the leading women's roles of soubrette and ingenue for many years, and continued to the category of mere noble after 1823, in which she was also appreciated for her dignity and style. She was however not considered to be very good in tragedies. In 1803, Clas Livijn described her role as Hildegard in Johanna von Montfaucon by Kotzebue: \\"You should see her act! I am completely taken by her person in this ancient costume: the language she spoke, everything draw a portrait of one of the innocent girls of past times [...] Yes, her action was to remarkable, that I doubt anyone in Sweden can be compared to her.\\" In 1819, she and her second spouse acted in the main roles of Romeo and Juliet in its premiere at the royal stage. = Roles = Her most known parts was Emma in Korsfararne (The Crusaders) by Koetzebue, Hildegard in Joahnna av Montfaucon by Kotzebue, Cherubin in The marriage of Figaro, the deaf and mute boy Jules in Abbe del'√âp√©e by Bouilly, Mrs Dorsan in Den ondsinta hustrun, (The Evil Wife) Elvira in Tartuffe. She played Ophelia in Hamlet with her own husband in 1819; this was the first time this play had been performed in Stockholm. She played \\"a French woman \\" in Karavanen (The Caravane) by Gretry and Wilhelm in Musikvurmen (Music Craze) by Grenier (season 1796‚Äì97), Isabella in Den talande tavlan (The speaking painting) by Gretry (1798‚Äì99), Zemire in Panurge p√• lanterne√∂n (Panurge on the lantern island) by Gretry and Cecile in Hemligheten (The Secret) by Soli√© (1799‚Äì1800), Alexandrine in En fj√§rdedels timmes tystnad (A quarter of an hour's silence) (1809‚Äì10), Regina in De l√∂jliga m√∂terna (Redicoulous encounters) by Isouard (1813‚Äì14), Madame Durandi√©re in V√§rldshuset i Bagni√©res (The Inn at Bagnieres) (1817‚Äì18) and Barbara in Oxmenuetten (The Ox-menuette) by Haydn (1825‚Äì26). =Private life= Carolina Kuhlman married the dancer Louis Deland in 1799 and divorced him in 1802. After her divorce, she called herself Mrs Kuhlman. She seems to have made a certain precedence. Divorce became quite accepted among actors after her divorce and it also became common for actresses to follow her example in regard to their name and title after divorce, and retake their birth name, but keep the title of Mrs: something known for example Charlotta Eriksson and Elise Fr√∂sslind. In 1815, she married her lover, the actor Gustav √Öbergsson. Carolina Kuhlman and Gustav √Öbergsson were known to have a relationship for years prior to their marriage. In 1811, she made a study trip to Paris to study the French theater with her lover (likely first time an actress of the Royal Dramatic Theatre made such a trip) which was mentioned by Anders Fredrik Skj√∂ldebrand: \\"An actor of the higher comedy, Mr √Öbergsson, had in the company of his mistress, an excellent actress in her own right, who were later to become his wife, went to Paris to develop himself in his profession\\", and on their return brought with them the play Cendrillon by Nicolo Isouard, the main women's role of which √Öbergsson demanded to be given to Kuhlman.

The school is located in St. Louis, Missouri. CID is affiliated Washington University in St. Louis. History CID was founded in 1914 by Max Aaron Goldstein a renowned ear, nose and throat physician. Dr. Goldstein set out to do what most thought was impossible at the time - teach deaf children to talk. Goldstein built on techniques he had learned at the Vienna Polyclinic in Austria from Victor Urbantschisch related to methods of teaching the deaf how to speak using \\"remnants\\" of hearing. When CID's new school building opened two years later, it had become enormously successful and it auditory-oral methods were groundbreaking. Goldstein's original vision included more than a school. He believed that having physicians, teachers and researchers work side-by-side on issues related to hearing and deafness was essential. He began training teachers of the deaf in 1914. In 1931, that teacher training program affiliated with Washington University in St. Louis, becoming the first deaf education teacher training program in the country to be offered through a college or university. The 1930s also saw the development of a research department that aimed to better understand the anatomy and science of hearing. Under the direction of Hallowell Davis, who came to CID from Harvard University, the research department would go on to become world-renowned for its work related to hearing and deafness, attracting some of the world's top faculty over the next seven decades. Davis' early work there was done during World War II on behalf of the Veterans Administration, developing improved hearing aids for those who had suffered hearing loss in combat.Saxon, Wolfgang. \\"Hallowell Davis, 96, an Explorer Who Charted the Inner Ear, Dies\\", The New York Times, September 10, 1992. Accessed July 18, 2010. This research laid the foundation for what would become the field of audiology. It was in 1947 that CID established one of the country's first two university training programs in audiology, a Ph.D. degree, through its affiliation with Washington University in St. Louis. Within a few months of each other, both CID/Washington University in St. Louis and Northwestern University had enrolled students and officially launched the country's academic training efforts in audiology. Both programs continue today as top-ranked leaders in audiology education. It was also in 1947 that CID added a master's program in deaf education, also the first such program in the country. In September 2003 in the wake of CID's financial difficulties, Washington University in St. Louis acquired the graduate education, clinical, and research divisions, formalizing a longtime connection between the two institutions. These programs are today known as \\"CID at Washington University School of Medicine.\\" .Naudi, Jack. \\"WASHINGTON U. BUYS RESEARCH ARM OF SCHOOL FOR THE DEAF\\", St. Louis Post-Dispatch, September 19, 2003. Accessed July 18, 2010. Clinical and research programs are operated through the Department of Otolaryngology; the graduate education programs are operated through the Program in Audiology and Communication Sciences. The CID school remains a separate, non-profit agency focused on educating children who are deaf and hard of hearing. Campus The CID campus is located between Clayton Avenue and Interstate 64 in St. Louis's Central West End, south of the Washington University Medical School. The westernmost building of the complex is also its oldest, dating to 1928. The institute's original 1916 building was torn down around 2000, when the modern portions of the complex were built. The 1928 building, designed by local architect William B. Ittner, was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2015 as a reminder of the institute's early history.

Called \\"one of the most prolific artists in American indie rock\\", Johnson has also released solo records, and is a member of the bands Monsters of Folk, New Multitudes and Overseas, and has also performed as part of the Undertow Orchestra.  Early life  Johnson was born in Kennett, Missouri. When he was 11 years old, his mother remarried and the family moved to Killeen, Texas. Johnson attended the University of North Texas, where he was involved in Denton's active music scene. He double majored in English and elementary education.  Music career  = Early music = Johnson began playing drums, piano and sang in his church choir at an early age. After moving to Killeen, Texas, from Kennett, Missouri, he was a founding member and drummer for jangle-rock band The Benjamins. They released two cassettes in 1988 and 1989 before Johnson left to attend the University of North Texas. While there, Johnson played in bands such as Polyester, Salt Lick, The Dooms UK, and was a founding member of Baboon. = Funland = On Super Bowl Sunday 1991, Johnson joined Peter Schmidt and Clark Vogeler to form the band Melt, which changed its name to Funland in 1992. Funland signed with Arista Records that year, releasing the EP Sweetness in March 1993. The band toured regularly in the US and released its only full-length album, The Funland Band, on Steve Records in 1995. After five and a half years, Funland disbanded in June 1996. = Centro-matic = Centro-matic began as a four-track cassette project when Johnson returned to college in May 1995. It was the first time he had written and sung songs, and later that year saw the release of the cassette Non- Directional Jetpack Race. A handful of 7-inch releases followed, and Johnson began playing live under the Centro-matic moniker in March 1996 as a solo performance with electric guitar and vocals. In December 1996, Johnson recorded the first Centro-matic full-length album, Redo The Stacks. Johnson played all the instruments except violin (Scott Danbom) and cello (Lindsay Romig), with longtime friend Matt Pence engineering the lo-fi record. In February 1997, Johnson started performing full-band Centro-matic shows with Mark Hedman on bass guitar and Pence on drums. Choosing to keep things informal, the band's first rehearsal was held after its second show. In March 1997, Danbom joined the band on piano, fiddle, bass guitar and vocals. Centro- matic continued to record and tour extensively in the United States and Europe under the same lineup until deciding to disband in 2014. The band released ten albums and five EPs, plus several 7-inch recordings, cassettes and compilation and soundtrack appearances. The band worked with Jeff Powell, Anders Parker and Scott Solter. The full lengths Navigational, B-sides compilation Static vs. The Strings Vol. 1 and All The Falsest Hearts Can Try were recorded at Jay Farrar's studio in Millstadt, Illinois. The band subsequently recorded most of its material at The Echo Lab in Argyle, Texas. = South San Gabriel = With his Centro-matic bandmates, Johnson formed the band South San Gabriel in the spring of 2001. It resulted from Centro-matic wanting to collaborate with and include other musicians while experimenting with a more spacious and atmospheric approach to writing and recording. South San Gabriel has a fluid lineup, with the band performing with anywhere from 3‚Äì10 members. South San Gabriel has released three full-length albums, plus EPs and singles. = Molina and Johnson = Johnson collaborated with songwriter Jason Molina for the joint album Molina and Johnson, released on the Secretly Canadian label in November 2009. They met by chance at the SXSW festival in Austin in 2003 or 2004. They recorded the album over a week and a half in early 2008. Johnson describes Molina as a \\"whirlwind of dedication and activity\\". Another collaboration was discussed but it never came to fruition before Molina's death in 2013. = Undertow Orchestra = Johnson has performed as part of the Undertow Orchestra with David Bazan, Vic Chesnutt and Mark Eitzel. Johnson first met Chestnutt in 1999 in Dallas.Chesnutt was a fan of Eitzel's music, and the two were long-time friends. According to Johnson, Bob Andrews, the manager for the four musicians, had the idea in 2005 to create a band called the Undertow Orchestra from members of the Undertow Music Collective. Johnson said Chesnutt was adamant that the shows not feature any solo performances, with the members working to play each other's songs as backing musicians. = Monsters of Folk = Johnson performed with indie supergroup Monsters of Folk as the drummer on a 2009 tour. The group included Jim James, Conor Oberst, M. Ward and Mike Mogis. The band toured the US and Europe and performed on PBS show Austin City Limits in October 2010. Johnson became an official member of the band during that time. = New Multitudes = From 2009 to 2012, Johnson collaborated with Jay Farrar, Jim James and Anders Parker on the Woody Guthrie archive project New Multitudes. The project involved the four songwriters setting music to Guthrie's unrecorded lyrics, and was recorded in a number of locations. The tribute album was released in 2012 with a short US tour following. = Overseas = Johnson formed the band Overseas in 2009 with David Bazan and Matt and Bubba Kadane. An eponymous album was released in 2013. = Other = As part of Monsters of Folk, Johnson participated in Neil Young's Bridge School Benefit in 2009. At the benefit, Johnson reconnected with former babysitter and family friend Sheryl Crow, who is also from Johnson's hometown.  Painting  An avid baseball fan as a child, Johnson roots for the St. Louis Cardinals. Since 2008 Johnson has produced a number of folk art paintings, mostly centering on the subject of baseball and its history. Commissions from friends eventually led to his work being exhibited in group and solo art shows. = Exhibitions = * April 2009: Cactus Music/The Record Ranch * August 2009: Good Records ‚Äì Joint show with Matt Pence * 2010: IF+D Gallery, Austin, TX ‚Äì Solo show * 2010: Bottletree, Birmingham, AL (2010) ‚Äì Group show with Elliott McPherson * 2010: The Downtown Gallery, Tuscaloosa, AL ‚Äì Group show * 2010: Bergino Gallery, New York, NY ‚Äì Group show * 2011: The Meme Gallery, Denton, TX ‚Äì Solo show * 2011: Lancaster Museum of Art, Lancaster, PA ‚Äì Group show * 2012: Webb Gallery, Waxahachie, TX ‚Äì Group show with Jad Fair, David Fair, Tim Kerr and Dan Phillips * 2012: Team Love Gallery, New Paltz, NY ‚Äì Solo show * 2013: Yard Dog Gallery, Austin, TX ‚Äì Solo show * 2014: Bergino Gallery, New York, NY ‚Äì Solo show * 2014: Cenote, Austin, TX ‚Äì Group show with Jessie Johnson * 2015: Yard Dog Gallery, Austin, TX ‚Äì Solo show * 2015: Pioneer House, Knoxville, TN ‚Äì Solo show * 2016: Neighborhood Gallery, Dallas, TX ‚Äì Group show with Tim Kerr * 2017: Collide, Austin, TX ‚Äì Group show with Mollie Tuggle * 2020: Kessler Theater, Dallas, TX ‚Äì Group show with Bruce Lee Webb and Tim Kerr * 2020: Lenny's, Bloomington, IN ‚Äì Solo show  Personal life  As of 2013, Johnson currently lives in Austin, Texas.

It at the foot of the moor's highest hill, the Dunkery Beacon, and is about one mile south of the A39 road between Porlock and Minehead. Administratively it forms part of the district of Somerset West and Taunton. The parish includes the hamlets of Stoke Pero (Stoche in 1086 Domesday Book) and Horner, as well as the former hamlet of Wilmersham. History The name Luccombe is believed to mean either Lufa's valley or valley where the counting was done. Locumbe in 1086 Domesday book. There is evidence of Iron Age field systems on the top of Great Hill, and the Sweetworthy Iron Age hill fort. At the time of the Domesday Book in 1086 East Luccombe was held by Ralph de Limesy passing by the 13th century to the Luccombe family, and later to the Arundell family. Along with West Luccombe these passed to the Acland family. Luccombe was part of the hundred of Carhampton. In 1944 Sir Richard Acland gave the Holnicote Estate, which includes Luccombe, to the National Trust. In 1944 Luccombe was the subject of a study by Mass-Observation: the only entirely rural project the government- funded social research organisation ever conducted. The results were later published in W.J. Turner's 1947 book, Exmoor Village. The village at the time was reported to comprise 24 cottages, with 51 adults and 23 children living in them. Luccombe used to be the location of the annual St Albans Cathedral Choir Camp, which celebrated its 50th anniversary in 2008. = Horner = Horner is on the eastern bank of Horner Water on which there is a restored, but non- working, water mill and which is crossed by a packhorse bridge, and on the route of the Coleridge Way. Horner possesses two tearooms and a campsite field owned by the Scout Association. Burrowhayes Farm is a nearby campsite that shares its patronage with the tearooms. = Stoke Pero = Stoke Pero was an ancient parish in the hundred of Carhampton. In the Domesday Book it was mentioned as Stoche. It became a civil parish in 1866, but in 1933 the parish was abolished and absorbed into the parish of Luccombe.Vision of Britain website = Wilmersham = Wilmersham (or Wilmotsham) was a small hamlet in Stoke Pero. Governance The parish council has responsibility for local issues, including setting an annual precept (local rate) to cover the council's operating costs and producing annual accounts for public scrutiny. The parish council evaluates local planning applications and works with the local police, district council officers, and neighbourhood watch groups on matters of crime, security, and traffic. The parish council's role also includes initiating projects for the maintenance and repair of parish facilities, as well as consulting with the district council on the maintenance, repair, and improvement of highways, drainage, footpaths, public transport, and street cleaning. Conservation matters (including trees and listed buildings) and environmental issues are also the responsibility of the council. The village falls within the non-metropolitan district of Somerset West and Taunton, which was established on 1 April 2019. It was previously in the district of West Somerset, which was formed on 1 April 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972, and part of Williton Rural District before that. The district council is responsible for local planning and building control, local roads, council housing, environmental health, markets and fairs, refuse collection and recycling, cemeteries and crematoria, leisure services, parks, and tourism. Somerset County Council is responsible for running the largest and most expensive local services such as education, social services, libraries, main roads, public transport, policing and fire services, trading standards, waste disposal and strategic planning. As Luccombe falls within the Exmoor National Park some functions normally administered by district or county councils have, since 1997, fallen under the Exmoor National Park Authority, which is known as a 'single purpose' authority, which aims to \\"conserve and enhance the natural beauty, wildlife and cultural heritage of the National Parks\\" and \\"promote opportunities for the understanding and enjoyment of the special qualities of the Parks by the public\\", including responsibility for the conservation of the historic environment.

She was needed by the Navy to be part of the fleet of ships to prevent blockade runners from entering ports in the Confederacy. Assigned to the North Atlantic Blockade Zouave‚Äîa screw steamer built in 1861 at Albany, New York‚Äîwas purchased by the Navy on 20 December 1861 at New York City and soon thereafter was delivered to the Navy at Hampton Roads, Virginia, for duty in the North Atlantic Blockading Squadron. On 1 February 1862, she was placed in commission, Acting Master Henry Reaney in command‚Äîand assigned the tasks of patrolling the mouth of the James River at night and serving as a tender for frigates and during daylight hours. Encounter with the CSS Virginia Shortly after noon on 8 March, the tug was moored to a wharf at Newport News, Virginia, when the quartermaster spotted some black smoke near the mouth of the Elizabeth River. Zouave got underway and headed across Hampton Roads to investigate. Soon observers on the tug could make out \\"what to all appearances looked like the roof of a very big barn belching forth smoke as from a chimney on fire.\\" After a Confederate flag came in view, the men on Zouave concluded that the strong looking craft was the long expected Southern ironclad CSS Virginia‚Äîthe rebuilt Merrimack‚Äîfinally emerging to challenge the Union blockaders. Zouave then opened up with her 30-pounder Parrott rifle and fired about a half-dozen rounds before she was recalled by a signal hoisted on board Cumberland. By this time, the Union warships in Hampton Roads and batteries at Newport News had also opened fire on the Southern ironclad. When Virginia reached a position abreast of Congress, she fired a broadside into that Union frigate and headed straight for Cumberland. Congress and Zouave attacked by CSS Virginia At this point, Zouave was in between the fire of Virginia, that of her escorts Patrick Henry and Jamestown, and the \\"friendly\\" Union guns based ashore at Newport News and Fort Monroe. She kept firing at the Southern ships until she was signaled by Congress to come alongside. The tug quickly obeyed and began the difficult process of taking the blazing frigate in tow. As Zouave was attempting to pull Congress into shoal water where she might be safe from further attacks, Virginia pulled astern of the retreating Union ships and subjected them to broadside after broadside. When Congress grounded, she hoisted a white flag to indicate her surrender. Congress surrenders, battle-damaged Zouave escapes Zouave cut her towlines; backed up; and, upon pulling free, resumed her firing. Lookouts on the tug thus spotted a signal on Minnesota‚Äîwhich had also grounded but was still in the fight‚Äîasking for assistance. While the tug was heading for that plucky Union blockader, she was hit \\"by a shot which carried away our rudder- post and one of the blades of her propeller wheel.\\" Unable to steer and moving straight toward Virginia, Zouave backed up and used her hawser \\"over our port quarter\\" to keep moving toward . During the passage, arrived on the scene and assisted Zouave to her destination. The battle-damaged tug lay alongside Minnesota throughout the night, ready to assist the Union ships insofar as she was able. The next day, Zouave was upstaged by the newly arrived during that novel ironclad's epic battle with Virginia. On 11 March, she proceeded, in tow, to the Baltimore Navy Yard for repairs. Return to Hampton Roads after repair at Baltimore Zouave returned to Hampton Roads on 3 May 1862. She spent the next six months deployed in Hampton Roads and surrounding waters on guard duty as an armed tug. She also carried out picket and dispatch assignments. On 26 October 1862, Zouave received instructions to hail , then cruising between the Piankatank and York Rivers, Virginia, and ordering her to report to Hampton Roads to prepare for duty in the North Carolina sounds. On 29 October 1862 at Rip Raps, Virginia, after Delaware failed to acknowledge Zouave's recognition signal, Zouave mistakenly fired on Delaware, taking the steamer for a Confederate blockade runner. Returning to Hampton Roads, Zouave and towed monitor to the Washington Navy Yard for repairs on 30 November 1862. On 18 January 1863, Zouave captured the small schooner J. C. MoCabe and six prisoners in the James River; and, on the night of 11 and 12 April 1863, she participated in a reconnaissance of Jamestown Island in the James. She served as part of the Union force capturing the formidable Confederate position at Hill's Point on the Nansemond River, Virginia, on 20 April 1863. This relieved Union army positions near Suffolk, Virginia, of Southern pressure. Zouave steamed to Baltimore, Maryland, for repairs in May 1863. The war, weather, and water take a toll on Zouave Zouave deteriorated steadily during the remaining two years of the war. On 29 February 1864, she was detailed to Atlanta, Georgia, to guard against possible attacks by Confederate torpedo boats. In April 1864, Zouave sailed to Baltimore for repairs. She soon returned to Hampton Roads, only to be ordered to the Norfolk Navy Yard for more repairs on 4 August 1864. Zouave remained in the yard through early December 1864, then was deployed in the James River until the war's end. After a final round of repairs at Norfolk, the tug proceeded to the New York Navy Yard on 1 June 1865. Decommissioning and sale Zouave was decommissioned at New York on 14 June 1865 and was sold at public auction there to M. O. Roberts on 12 July 1865.

She was engaged as an opera singer at the Royal Swedish Opera, and as a stage actress at the Royal Dramatic Theater, between 1787 and 1810. Life =Early life= Inga √Öberg was the daughter of Jonas √Öberg, a footman at the Royal Palace and Fredrika Maria Svahn. It is likely that her paternal grandmother was Beata Sabina Straas, the first professional native stage actress: Straas had been employed as a chambermaid of the royal household prior to her stage career, and after she married Anders √Öberg and retired from the stage, both she and her spouse was employed in the royal household, but it is not confirmed that Jonas √Öberg was their son.

Many later famed Swedish of stage artists of her generation was trained by the French actors of the French Theatre in Bollhuset under Monvel, among them Maria Franck, Lars Hjortsberg, and as such, they also performed as child actors in the productions. =Career at the Royal theatres= Inga √Öberg debuted as an opera singer at the age of fourteen on 31 May 1787 at the Royal Swedish Opera in the role of Yngve in Frigga. Her following performance in Gustav Adolf and Ebba Brahe by King Gustav III of Sweden, she was favorably noted by the King (also the author of the play) and formally engaged at the opera. The same year, she was in parallel engaged as a stage actress at the newly founded Swedish-language Ristell Theatre in Bollhuset. When the Ristell theater was transformed to become the Royal Dramatic Theatre (1788), she became a member of its pioneer generation. It was not uncommon in the late 18th century for stage artists to be employed at both the opera as singers and at the theater as stage actors, providing that they had the ability to perform in both capacities.Georg Nordensvan:Svensk teater och svenska sk√•despelare Fr√•n Gustav III till v√•ra dagar.

(in Swedish) In the first decade of the 19th-century, she was one of few actors of her generation which was not deemed as outdated by the harsh critic Klas Livijn. Her beauty attracted great attention, but was also regarded to have had a negative effect on her career. According to critics, she did have great natural talent, but neglected to develop it fully because she had been told that her beauty would be enough, and therefore never reached her full potential. A contemporary writer stated that Inga √Öberg: \\"... would have become a great singer and an excellent actress, if her unusual beauty and not been an obstacle for her artistic studies, and she had been enticed to regard it as a source of income, richer but in the long term no more secure than art.\\"Georg Nordensvan:Svensk teater och svenska sk√•despelare Fr√•n Gustav III till v√•ra dagar.

Het Bildt once was part of the Middelzee and even until this day land silts up and new lands are being given by the Waddenzee. This dike was the first barrier to protect the Bildt area from the sea. The Nieuwe Bildtdijk that was built in the 17th century made the Oude Bildtijk lose its protective function. Also, the Nieuwe Bildtdijk eventually lost its function when an even higher and stronger dike was thrown up in the 20th century. Nowadays, a narrow road runs over the dike and many houses and farmhouses are situated (mainly on the northern side) along and of this dike. From the year 1546, under the rule of emperor Carl V, it was only allowed to build houses on the northern side of the dikes. Only with approval of the emperor was it allowed to build on the south side. Not more than two houses have been built on the south side, of which only one still exists this day, number 237. This rule was to protect the precious land from housing, so it would be used for farming only. With a distance of 14 kilometers, the Oude Bildtdijk is the longest street of Friesland.

She was bred by Peter J. Moor, chairman of the board of directors of the Thoroughbred Breeders Association of Zimbabwe. With that country in a state of turmoil and near economic collapse following implementation of the government's land reform law that resulted in confiscation and redistribution of horse farms, the granddaughter of Mr. Prospector was sold at the annual Zim Nation yearling auction in Harare for the equivalent of US$30 (thirty dollars). Purchased by a four-man partnership, she was given the name Ipi Tombe which in the Xhosa language (actually: \\"ipi ntombi\\") translates as \\"Where is the girl?\\" Racing in Zimbabwe Conditioned by Zimbabwe's leading trainer, Noelene Peech, Ipi Tombe began her racing career at age three. She made five starts at Borrowdale Park Racecourse in Harare, earning four wins and a second. Her demonstrated abilities were such that her handlers were able to syndicate her to a group of twenty-two South African investors who brought her to race there where stronger competition for higher purse money was available. Racing in South Africa Racing under the syndicate's Sunmark Stable banner, Ipi Tombe joined the stable of trainer Noelene Peech and won four races from five starts in her native Zimbabwe. Showing the potential she did, owners Henk Leyenaar, Stephen Tomlinson and Dave Coleman secured half a share for R250 000, the other half remaining with the Sunmark Syndicate, of which Rob Davenport was the nominee, She was sent across the border to Mike de Kock in South Africa., Ipi Tombe's conditioning was entrusted to Mike De Kock, one of South Africa's leading trainers. She made her debut on 9 March 2002, finishing second in the South African Triple Tiara at Turffontein Racecourse in Johannesburg. She would never lose another race in her career. After her initial defeat, Ipi Tombe then won the South African Oaks, the South African Fillies Guineas, and the Woolavington Stakes but her most important win in 2002 was in the country's most prestigious race, the Durban July Handicap at Greyville Racecourse in Durban. In this Group One race she would be up against the best horses from all over the country, including many older male horses. Ridden by jockey Kevin Shea, Ipi Tombe came from a difficult number eighteen outside post position to put on a powerful stretch drive that made her the first three-year-old filly to win the race in fifty years. Her performances that year earned her South African Champion Three-Year-Old Filly honors. Racing in Dubai Ipi Tombe's performances also brought her to the attention of Barry Irwin, head of the Team Valor racing operation based in Versailles, Kentucky whose business acquires racing stock by selling individual horse partnerships to the public. In August 2002, a deal was struck that resulted in Sunmark Stable retaining a twenty-five percent interest in the horse with Team Valor also holding twenty- five percent and prominent Kentucky breeder WinStar Farm the owner of the remaining fifty percent. Shipped to winter at trainer Mike De Kock stables at Nad Al Sheba Racecourse in Dubai, Ipi Tombe made her 2003 debut in March, winning the Group II Haafhd Jebel Hatta in stakes record time. She then defeated male rivals while capturing the Group One Dubai Duty Free Stakes in track record time. Ipi Tombe's outstanding performances would earn her 2003 Dubai Horse of the Year honors. Racing in the United States Following her success in Dubai, in April 2003 Ipi Tombe was shipped to Churchill Downs in Louisville, Kentucky where her race conditioning was taken over by Elliott Walden.

I've have been bluffed by the way he's adapting to Europe and with his progression all this pasts months. I truly believe that the kid will break through really fast in European football if he continues to be focus and committed like this. Switzerland is being the perfect adaptation championship for Leo.

It is believed that the painting was ordered by Gustaf Mauritz Armfelt, with whom she had a relationship at the time. Beata Charlotta \\"Charlotte\\" Eckerman (1759 ‚Äì 16 January 1790 in Stockholm), was a Swedish opera singer and actress. She was also a very well known courtesan during the Gustavian era, and the official royal mistress of Charles XIII of Sweden from 1779 to 1781.  Life  Charlotte Eckerman was the daughter of Bengt Edvard Eckerman, cavalry captain of the Royal Scanian Husars, and the writer Catharina Ahlgren. Her father was the cousin of Carl Fredrik Ekerman, speaker of the burghers in the Swedish parliament, and her mother was at one point the kammarfru of the queen, Louisa Ulrika of Prussia. In the custody of her father after her parents divorce, she was described as more or less an orphan. She had two brothers and a sister, as well as several halfsiblings by her fathers second marriage and by her mother. She and her sister did not get along with their stepmother, and appears to have moved from home early on.Beata Charlotte Ekerman, urn:sbl:16573, Svenskt biografiskt lexikon (art av Bengt Hildebrand.), h√§mtad 2019-06-15. Her sister Julie Eckerman (1765‚Äì1801) was also a courtesan and the mistress of nobleman count Carl Sparre, governor of Stockholm. =Opera singer= Charlotta Eckerman was engaged at the Stenborg Company in 1774, and as a singer at the Royal Swedish Opera in Bollhuset in Stockholm in 1776‚Äì81. In 1774, she and several other actors of the Stenborg Company was called to Gripsholm Castle by Gustav III, who had recently created the Swedish Royal Opera and was in search of talent. The king discovered that she had a talent for drama, and gave the courtier Maria Aurora Uggla, the star of the nobility's amateur theatre at the royal court, the task to instruct her in the part of Mechtild in the opera Birger jarl by Gyllenborg and Adlerbeth, after the part had been refused by Elisabeth Olin. Charlotte Eckerman made a great success in the part at the Royal Opera in Stockholm, and was called in by the audience: Prince Charles started to shout \\"Miss Uggla! Miss Uggla!\\", after which the audience applauded also Maria Aurora Uggla in her box as well as the author Gyllenborg for having instructed Eckerman in the part. Eckerman was given a contract as a singer at the opera in 1776, and was active there until 1781, during which she was \\"an adored actress and singer\\". After having been judged as unfit for the ballet, she was given a place in the choir. Though her voice was weak, she was described as beautiful and vivid. While described as failed dancer and a mediocre singer, she was considered a well capable actress.Beata Charlotte Ekerman, urn:sbl:16573, Svenskt biografiskt lexikon (art av Bengt Hildebrand.), h√§mtad 2019-06-15. Charlotte Eckerman was, alongside Ulrica Rosenlund, much recommended for her dramatic talent and belonged to the members of staff in the first national Opera, who proved their talent not only as singers, but also as actors in talking parts, the theatrical performances that were sometimes given at the opera before the opening of the royal theatre in 1788. =Royal mistress= Charlotta Eckerman was from 1774 active as a courtesan. In 1779, she was made the official mistress of the king's brother duke Charles, the future Charles XIII of Sweden. Rumour claimed that Charles took Eckerman as a mistress upon the advice of his brother, Prince Frederick Adolf of Sweden, who thought it more polite to Charle's consort than his first choice; countess Maria Sophia Rosenstierna, who was the courtier of his consort. Duke Charles had, in any case, a more unofficial relationship with the ballerina Charlotte Slottsberg, who was however not given any official recognition. The relationship between Charles and Eckerman caused a scandal because of sympathy toward the consort of Charles, Hedvig Elisabeth Charlotte of Holstein-Gottorp, who was very popular. Duke Charles tried to influence king Gustav III to take an official mistress, and Eckerman suggested the French adventurer Madame Monzouve (or de Monzouvre), but the plot does not seem to have succeeded. In 1781, Charles ended the connection. It was rumoured that the relationship ended because of the scandal, but in reality, it was more likely because Charles regarded it as necessary after having become inducted into the Freemasons. However, this does not seem to be correct, as Charles soon entered into another love affair with Fran√ßoise-√âl√©onore Villain. In 1781, Eckerman became involved in a conflict with the king, Gustav III of Sweden. Eckerman was disliked by the king, as it was said, because she did not admire him and because she had a talent for caricaturing the current ideals. When her affair with the king's brother ended and she could no longer count on his protection, the king arranged for her dismissal from the Opera and had her banished from Drottningholm. Furthermore, he ordered Baron Carl Sparre, the governor of the city of Stockholm, to have her arrested and sent to the L√•ngholmens spinnhus. As a reason, he claimed that she had given birth to a child and murdered it in secrecy, and that she had taken part in the spreading of rumours regarding the legitimacy of the heir to the throne. There were at the time many rumors that the crown prince was fathered by the stable master Count Adolf Fredrik Munck af Fulkila on the orders of the king, rumors which were spread by the king's own mother, Louisa Ulrika of Prussia, and increased when Munck were given gifts by the king and the queen. Sparre, who was the lover of Eckerman's sister Julie, was aware of the king's dislike of Eckerman. Sparre investigated the accusations and could find nothing to indicate that she had committed child murder. Charlotte Eckerman denied the accusation that she was to have spread rumours regarding the crown prince's legitimacy, and claimed that it was the king's page, Georg Johan De Besche as the guilty party. De Besche was to have said, that the gift the queen had given to Munck was well worthy of the birth of an heir to the throne. Sparre refused to arrest her, and pointed out that it was against Swedish law for a monarch to threaten the freedom of a citizen without a legal verdict from a court. The whole affair ended in silence. Eckerman was not sent to jail, and the king did not mention it further. Eckerman left the country shortly afterward, possibly banished by the monarch. =Later life= Charlotte Eckerman later lived in Paris in France, where she worked as a courtesan under the name Madame Ahlgren. During this period, she was portrayed by the famous artist Adolf Ulrik Wertm√ºller: the painting was likely ordered by her then admirer Gustaf Mauritz Armfelt. In 1784, Gustaf Mauritz Armfelt arranged a meeting with Gustav III during his official visit to France, during which she was reconciled with the monarch and allowed to return to Sweden. During these years, she made a journey through Italy, which was unusual for a single woman in this period. She returned to Sweden in 1786. Charlotte Eckerman now became active as a spy. She received an allowance from the authorities in exchange for spying on the foreign ambassadors stationed in Stockholm in her capacity of a courtesan. At the time of her death, she was the mistress of the Dutch ambassador to Sweden, baron van der Bork. She died while being magnetized by Anders Sparrman.

Overview The Spirit of Life began as a commission for a memorial to the famous Wall Street financier Spencer Trask (1844‚Äì1909). Trask was a summer resident in Saratoga Springs, New York and a founder of the committee which was charged with renewing the city's reputation as a health resort. The commission for the monument came from George Foster Peabody who was a friend of Trask's. Henry Bacon, who collaborated with French on the Lincoln Memorial, designed the setting for French's statue.Daniel Chester French: The Spirit of Life Audrey Munson was the model for the statue. The statue stands in the heart of Congress Park in Saratoga Springs, New York, on a shallow niche of white marble with a balustraded terrace above and an oblong lagoon, set in marble and surrounded with verdant shrubbery, green lawns, and a wealth of flowers below. The statue is a figure of a winged woman, hands moving high above her head (the African-American model was Hettie Anderson). The figure represents Hygieia, the giver of health, who usually appeared in Greek and Roman art accompanying her father, Asklepios, the god of medicine. She is often shown offering nourishment to a serpent entwined on the staff Asklepios carries. In French's conception, Hygieia holds a shallow bowl aloft and in the other hand clasps a pine bough, a reference to the towering pines on the grounds of the Trasks' estate. The goddess is poised lightly on a rock, and a stream of water pours from its cleft. The pedestal is a sculptured reproduction of the tufaceous deposits seen about the orifice of many of Saratoga's famous springs.Saratoga's Tribut to Spencer Trask; Unveiling of \\"The Spirit of Life,\\" Completing the Memorial to Him, The New York Times, June 27, 1915 Inscription on the statue reads \\"To do good and serve my fellow man.\\"The Spirit of Life The Spirit of Life is one of French's finest \\"active\\" statues. The flow of the angel's robe and the position of her right foot gives a great deal of motion. Several smaller castings of the statue were made and authorized by French; six were made between 1923 and 1931. It is considered a contributing object to the National Historic Landmark District that includes the park and Canfield Casino.

The scalar field map is of the component of magnetic field which is normal to a two-dimensional surface of a volume conductor; this volume conductor contains the currents producing the magnetic field. The resulting vector map, sometimes called \\"an arrowmap\\" roughly mimics those currents under the surface which are parallel to the surface, which produced the field. Therefore, the purpose in performing the transformation is to allow a rough visualization of the underlying, parallel currents. The transformation was proposed by Cohen and Hosaka of the biomagnetism group at MIT, then was used by Hosaka and Cohen to visualize the current sources of the magnetocardiogram. Each arrow is defined as: : \\\\vec{a} = {\\\\partial Bz\\\\over\\\\partial y}\\\\hat{x} - {\\\\partial Bz\\\\over\\\\partial x}\\\\hat{y} where x of the local x, y, z coordinate system is normal to the volume conductor surface, \\\\hat{x} and \\\\hat{y} are unit vectors, and Bz is the normal component of magnetic field.

Plot Out of work but on his honeymoon, Bill Partain, a newspaper reporter, reads about a bank robbery in Sedalia, Missouri pulled off by notorious criminal Tom Ellis and his gang. Having once interviewed Ellis's girlfriend Ruth Childers for a Kansas City, Missouri paper, Partain figures an exclusive interview with Ellis could assure him of landing a new job. Lying to his new wife Irene about where they are going, Bill drives them to a small Ozarks town where he believes Ruth is living. Townspeople are reluctant to help Bill locate her, and deputy Lou Follett warns him that almost everyone in the community is afraid of Ellis. Bill finally finds Ruth, who remembers him favorably. She manages to arrange his being taken to Ellis by a young man named Kermit who is not in the gang, but sometimes works for him. Ellis grants him an interview, boasting of his crimes, to the consternation of gunman Elly Horn, who suddenly shoots both Ellis and Kermit. He also shoots his own gang member, Oren, by mistake. Irene, left behind, is desperate to find her husband, who is now being held by Elly for a ransom of $50,000.

The character first appeared in Sub-Mariner #70 (May 1974). Fictional character biography The Piranha was created as a result of the experiments of Dr. Lemuel Dorcas, having been exposed to remaining radiation from Dorcas's previous work. After devouring Dorcas's deceased assistants and evolving from a normal fish into a humanoid fish, he ordered other fish into the radiation, creating more Men-Fish. Piranha and his Men-Fish traveled to Hydro-Base in the hopes of researching more of Dorcas' work there. They followed Namor and attacked him. During the fight, Piranha was wounded, and his blood attracted his piranhas, which turned on him and devoured him.Sub-Mariner #71 (May, 1974) These piranhas who ate the original Piranha evolved into identical versions of the original, eventually numbering in the hundreds. They later captured Namor and the Thing, forcing them to fight to the death. The two combatants instead managed to crush the underwater stadium they fought in and crushed all the Piranhas.Marvel Two-In-One #28 (June, 1977) The original Piranha eventually regenerated, and joined the Deep Six alongside Nagala, Orka, Sea Urchin, and Tiger Shark while Attuma had seized the throne of Atlantis. Deep Six defended Attuma's throne from the invading Prince Namor and the Defenders twice, but lost to the Defenders the second time.Defenders vol. 2 #7 (September, 2001) After Marvel Zombies 3, the zombie Deadpool's head was teleported to the bottom of the ocean along with the Zombie (Simon Garth). The Deadpool head infected Piranha and all of the Men-Fish with the zombie plague. When the Men-Fish attacked a cruise ship, the new Midnight Sons arrived and destroyed them. As the Midnight Sons explored the ship, the now zombified Piranha attacked them.Marvel Zombies 4 #1 Daimon Hellstrom causes the ship to explode, destroying all the Men-Fish. Piranha's fate is not shown.Marvel Zombies 4 #2 Powers and abilities The Piranha was a normal piranha fish mutated by radiation into a semi-humanoid being with sub-human intelligence. The Piranha had superhuman physicality, teeth that were strong and sharp enough to penetrate Namor's skin,Sub-Mariner #71 (May, 1974) claws that were equally as incisive made deadlier by a sleep-inducing venom they generated and the power to command other fish telepathically.Marvel Two-In-One #28 (June, 1977) Piranha could increase its intellect by consuming the remains of anyone it came across, effectively adding their knowledge, memories and acumen to its own. The creature also boasts a regenerative healing factor powerful enough to physically restore him even from being devoured by his own Men-Fish,Defenders vol. 2 #7 (September, 2001) but was not powerful enough to prevent his reanimation. After being zombified by a necrolized Headpool, Piranha was turned into a zombie with a greatly augmented appetite. On top of the standard ability to spread the zombie plague via physical contact; e.i. biting and scratching as he'd done with his piranha men-fish.Marvel Zombies 4 #1 Piranha gained a parasitic ability to breed and birth schools of zombie men-fish clones of itself as eggs in healthy human hosts, as well as self-spawn without the need of a mating cycle.Marvel Zombies 4 #2 References External links * Category:Characters created by George Tuska Category:Characters created by Marv Wolfman Category:Comics characters introduced in 1974 Category:Marvel Comics supervillains Category:Marvel Comics telepaths ","title":"Piranha (comics)"},{"id":"13631767","text":"Close is a surname, and may refer to: * Close (1817 cricketer), English first- class cricketer whose forename is unknown * Alex Close, Belgian cyclist * Brian Close, English cricketer * Carl B.

It was founded on 14 December 1863 by Marquis Townshend, who was one of the few aristocrats to support the reform movement. It was made up of Radicals and trade union representatives. It was chaired by John Bedford Leno, and its vice-presidents included Edmond Beales, J.A. Nicholay and Captain E. Dresser Rogers who were all to become Reform League officials. Its aims were ambitious and were to: * reduce working hours * promote franchise extension * promote the international fraternity of workers * increase recreational and educational opportunities Townshend obtained rooms at 18 Greek Street to use as the Universal League's headquarters. They were also used as the home of the International Working Men's Association a few months later. Initial efforts concentrated on the right to public assembly and the amendment of the Master and Servant Act but once Gladstone declared his conversion to parliamentary reform the League's efforts were redirected to suffrage. A Universal League Reform Committee was formed to concentrate on manhood suffrage, however Townshend objected to its formation as he feared control was being wrested from his hands. This did not go down too well with the other League members who made plans throughout the autumn and winter of 1864-5 to form a separate Reform League. As a result, the Reform League was inaugurated on the 23 February 1865, leaving the Universal League defunct.  Footnotes  Further reading * F.M.

The site won the Japanese Good Design Award in 2007, and an Honorary Mention of the Digital Communities category at Prix Ars Electronica 2008. Features Users can upload, view, and share video clips. Unlike other video sharing sites, however, comments are overlaid directly onto the video, synced to specific playback times. This feature allows comments to respond directly to events occurring in the video, in sync with the viewer‚Äîcreating a sense of a shared watching experience. Together with Hiroyuki Nishimura serving as director at Niwango until February 2013, Niconico's atmosphere and cultural context are close to 2channel's or Futaba Channel's. Many popular videos on this site have otaku tastes, such as anime, computer games, and pop music. Niconico offers a feature for users (not just the uploader of the video) to tag videos. Each video may have up to eleven tags, of which up to five the uploader may lock. Frequently, this functionality can be used not only as categorization, but also as critical commentary, satire, or other humor related to the video's content. The site is also known for its MAD videos and its medleys of popular songs on the website, most notably Kumikyoku Nico Nico Douga. Niconico also distributed some original net animations, such as Candy Boy, Tentai Senshi Sunred, and Penguin Musume Heart. Other features include: * Mylist: each user may create \\"mylists\\", which function similarly to a list of bookmarks. Users can have up to 25 mylist folders, but the number of videos per folder depends on the user's membership status. A basic account can have 100 videos per folder, while a premium (paid) account has five times that amount (500). Under this limit, a free member can have up to 2,500 mylisted videos, while premium members can mylist up to 12,500 videos. Daily mylist activity is used to compute the default ranking view, although one may also sort by view or comment count. Mylists may be optionally made public and linked to; for example, to make a list of uploader's works (e.g., original songs or gameplay videos). * Uploader comments: the uploader of a video may attach permanent comments to the video. This feature is suitable for some cases as subtitles, lyrics, or corrections. * Nicoscript: by using special commands in the uploader comments, the uploader can add special effects to the video, including voting, automatic transfer to another video, quiz scoring, and other features. History Nobuo Kawakami, the founder and CEO of Niconico The first version of Niconico used YouTube as a video source. When the site grew, YouTube's server infrastructure strained due to increased traffic and bandwidth, forcing YouTube to block access from Niconico. As a result, Niconico ceased operations, but two weeks later, the site relaunched with an on-premises video server. On May 7, 2007, Niconico announced a mobile phone version of the website. Since August 9, 2007, \\"Nico Nico Douga (RC) Mobile\\" has serviced mobile phones of NTT DoCoMo and au. As of October 31, 2011, Niconico has over 23,690,000 registered users, 6,870,000 mobile users and 1,390,000 premium users. Due to the limited server capacity, Niwango limits the number of free users who can access the website at peak times (7 p.m. to 2 a.m.), based on the time of registration. The website is in Japanese, and the majority of the site traffic is from Japan, although approximately four percent is from outside Japan, notably one percent from Taiwan. Niconico launched a Taiwanese version of the site on October 18, 2007. In July 2008, Niconico launched German and Spanish-language versions of the site, followed by an update for the Taiwanese-language version. An English- language version was added on October 17, 2012, superseding the Niconico.com website, with translation functionality allowing users to translate video descriptions into English or Chinese. On April 27, 2012, Nico Nico Douga announced it would be rebranding itself as Niconico. The site also introduced a new \\"Zero\\" update, which improves video resolution, along with various other upgrades. Niconico launched for the Nintendo Switch in Japan on July 13, 2017, and was the Switch's first third-party media app in any market. =Niconico.com = In 2010, a version in English was in the works, and in April 2011, an English-language beta website, Niconico, was launched.

These mechanisms are a major topic of research as of 2007. Neither the light curves nor the early-time spectra of GRBs show resemblance to the radiation emitted by any familiar physical process. Compactness problem It has been known for many years that ejection of matter at relativistic velocities (velocities very close to the speed of light) is a necessary requirement for producing the emission in a gamma-ray burst. GRBs vary on such short timescales (as short as milliseconds) that the size of the emitting region must be very small, or else the time delay due to the finite speed of light would \\"smear\\" the emission out in time, wiping out any short-timescale behavior. At the energies involved in a typical GRB, so much energy crammed into such a small space would make the system opaque to photon-photon pair production, making the burst far less luminous and also giving it a very different spectrum from what is observed. However, if the emitting system is moving towards Earth at relativistic velocities, the burst is compressed in time (as seen by an Earth observer, due to the relativistic Doppler effect) and the emitting region inferred from the finite speed of light becomes much smaller than the true size of the GRB (see relativistic beaming). GRBs and internal shocks A related constraint is imposed by the relative timescales seen in some bursts between the short- timescale variability and the total length of the GRB. Often this variability timescale is far shorter than the total burst length. For example, in bursts as long as 100 seconds, the majority of the energy can be released in short episodes less than 1 second long. If the GRB were due to matter moving towards Earth (as the relativistic motion argument enforces), it is hard to understand why it would release its energy in such brief interludes. The generally accepted explanation for this is that these bursts involve the collision of multiple shells traveling at slightly different velocities; so-called \\"internal shocks\\". The collision of two thin shells flash-heats the matter, converting enormous amounts of kinetic energy into the random motion of particles, greatly amplifying the energy release due to all emission mechanisms. Which physical mechanisms are at play in producing the observed photons is still an area of debate, but the most likely candidates appear to be synchrotron radiation and inverse Compton scattering. As of 2007 there is no theory that has successfully described the spectrum of all gamma-ray bursts (though some theories work for a subset). However, the so-called Band function (named after David Band) has been fairly successful at fitting, empirically, the spectra of most gamma-ray bursts: N(E)= \\\\begin{cases} {E^\\\\alpha \\\\exp \\\\left( { - \\\\frac{E}} \\\\right)}, & \\\\mbox{if }E \\\\le (\\\\alpha - \\\\beta) E_0\\\\mbox\\\\\\\\\\\\ {\\\\left[{\\\\left( {\\\\alpha - \\\\beta } \\\\right)E_0 } \\\\right]^{\\\\left( {\\\\alpha - \\\\beta } \\\\right)} E^\\\\beta \\\\exp \\\\left( {\\\\beta - \\\\alpha } \\\\right)}, & \\\\mbox{if }E > (\\\\alpha - \\\\beta) E_0\\\\mbox\\\\end{cases} A few gamma-ray bursts have shown evidence for an additional, delayed emission component at very high energies (GeV and higher). One theory for this emission invokes inverse Compton scattering. If a GRB progenitor, such as a Wolf-Rayet star, were to explode within a stellar cluster, the resulting shock wave could generate gamma-rays by scattering photons from neighboring stars. About 30% of known galactic Wolf-Rayet stars, are located in dense clusters of O stars with intense ultraviolet radiation fields, and the collapsar model suggests that WR stars are likely GRB progenitors. Therefore, a substantial fraction of GRBs are expected to occur in such clusters. As the relativistic matter ejected from an explosion slows and interacts with ultraviolet-wavelength photons, some photons gain energy, generating gamma-rays. Afterglows and external shocks Gamma-ray-burst Mechanism The GRB itself is very rapid, lasting from less than a second up to a few minutes at most. Once it disappears, it leaves behind a counterpart at longer wavelengths (X-ray, UV, optical, infrared, and radio) known as the afterglow that generally remains detectable for days or longer. In contrast to the GRB emission, the afterglow emission is not believed to be dominated by internal shocks. In general, all the ejected matter has by this time coalesced into a single shell traveling outward into the interstellar medium (or possibly the stellar wind) around the star. At the front of this shell of matter is a shock wave referred to as the \\"external shock\\" as the still relativistically moving matter ploughs into the tenuous interstellar gas or the gas surrounding the star. As the interstellar matter moves across the shock, it is immediately heated to extreme temperatures. (How this happens is still poorly understood as of 2007, since the particle density across the shock wave is too low to create a shock wave comparable to those familiar in dense terrestrial environments ‚Äì the topic of \\"collisionless shocks\\" is still largely hypothesis but seems to accurately describe a number of astrophysical situations. Magnetic fields are probably critically involved.) These particles, now relativistically moving, encounter a strong local magnetic field and are accelerated perpendicular to the magnetic field, causing them to radiate their energy via synchrotron radiation. Synchrotron radiation is well understood, and the afterglow spectrum has been modeled fairly successfully using this template. It is generally dominated by electrons (which move and therefore radiate much faster than protons and other particles) so radiation from other particles is generally ignored. In general, the GRB assumes the form of a power-law with three break points (and therefore four different power-law segments.) The lowest break point, u_a, corresponds to the frequency below which the GRB is opaque to radiation and so the spectrum attains the form Rayleigh-Jeans tail of blackbody radiation. The two other break points, u_m and u_c, are related to the minimum energy acquired by an electron after it crosses the shock wave and the time it takes an electron to radiate most of its energy, respectively. Depending on which of these two frequencies is higher, two different regimes are possible: * Fast cooling ( u_m > u_c) - Shortly after the GRB, the shock wave imparts immense energy to the electrons and the minimum electron Lorentz factor is very high. In this case, the spectrum looks like: F_ u \\\\propto \\\\begin{cases} { u^{2}}, & u< u_a \\\\\\\\\\\\ { u^{1/3}}, & u_a< u< u_c \\\\\\\\\\\\ { u^{-1/2}}, & u_c< u< u_m \\\\\\\\\\\\ { u^{-p/2}}, & u_m< u \\\\end{cases} * Slow cooling ( u_m < u_c) ‚Äì Later after the GRB, the shock wave has slowed down and the minimum electron Lorentz factor is much lower.: F_ u \\\\propto \\\\begin{cases} { u^{2}}, & u< u_a \\\\\\\\\\\\ { u^{1/3}}, & u_a< u< u_m \\\\\\\\\\\\ { u^{-(p-1)/2}}, & u_m< u< u_c \\\\\\\\\\\\ { u^{-p/2}}, & u_c< u \\\\end{cases} The afterglow changes with time. It must fade, obviously, but the spectrum changes as well. For the simplest case of adiabatic expansion into a uniform-density medium, the critical parameters evolve as: u_c \\\\propto t^{1/2} u_m \\\\propto t^{-3/2} F_{ u,max} = const Here F_{ u,max} is the flux at the current peak frequency of the GRB spectrum. (During fast-cooling this is at u_c; during slow-cooling it is at u_m.) Note that because u_m drops faster than u_c, the system eventually switches from fast-cooling to slow-cooling. Different scalings are derived for radiative evolution and for a non-constant-density environment (such as a stellar wind), but share the general power-law behavior observed in this case. Several other known effects can modify the evolution of the afterglow: Reverse shocks and the optical flash  There can be \\"reverse shocks\\", which propagate back into the shocked matter once it begins to encounter the interstellar medium. The twice-shocked material can produce a bright optical/UV flash, which has been seen in a few GRBs, though it appears not to be a common phenomenon. Refreshed shocks and late-time flares There can be \\"refreshed\\" shocks if the central engine continues to release fast-moving matter in small amounts even out to late times, these new shocks will catch up with the external shock to produce something like a late-time internal shock. This explanation has been invoked to explain the frequent flares seen in X-rays and at other wavelengths in many bursts, though some theorists are uncomfortable with the apparent demand that the progenitor (which one would think would be destroyed by the GRB) remains active for very long. Jet effects Gamma-ray burst emission is believed to be released in jets, not spherical shells. Initially the two scenarios are equivalent: the center of the jet is not \\"aware\\" of the jet edge, and due to relativistic beaming we only see a small fraction of the jet. However, as the jet slows down, two things eventually occur (each at about the same time): First, information from the edge of the jet that there is no pressure to the side propagates to its center, and the jet matter can spread laterally. Second, relativistic beaming effects subside, and once Earth observers see the entire jet the widening of the relativistic beam is no longer compensated by the fact that we see a larger emitting region. Once these effects appear the jet fades very rapidly, an effect that is visible as a power-law \\"break\\" in the afterglow light curve. This is the so-called \\"jet break\\" that has been seen in some events and is often cited as evidence for the consensus view of GRBs as jets. Many GRB afterglows do not display jet breaks, especially in the X-ray, but they are more common in the optical light curves. Though as jet breaks generally occur at very late times (~1 day or more) when the afterglow is quite faint, and often undetectable, this is not necessarily surprising. Dust extinction and hydrogen absorption There may be dust along the line of sight from the GRB to Earth, both in the host galaxy and in the Milky Way. If so, the light will be attenuated and reddened and an afterglow spectrum may look very different from that modeled. At very high frequencies (far-ultraviolet and X-ray) interstellar hydrogen gas becomes a significant absorber. In particular, a photon with a wavelength of less than 91 nanometers is energetic enough to completely ionize neutral hydrogen and is absorbed with almost 100% probability even through relatively thin gas clouds. (At much shorter wavelengths the probability of absorption begins to drop again, which is why X-ray afterglows are still detectable.) As a result, observed spectra of very high-redshift GRBs often drop to zero at wavelengths less than that of where this hydrogen ionization threshold (known as the Lyman break) would be in the GRB host's reference frame. Other, less dramatic hydrogen absorption features are also commonly seen in high-z GRBs, such as the Lyman alpha forest.

At this time the medieval walls of the chapel were found to be unsound and had to be rebuilt.Lyte (1907), p. 3 In 1902 the chapel became a museum of the Public Record Office.Darby, Trudi & Bell (2002), pp. 56‚Äì63 By 1997 all records were transferred to a new site in Kew or the Family Records Centre in Islington. =University library= The domed Round Reading Room In 2001 King's College London acquired the building from the Crown Estate and appointed a design team led by Gaunt Francis Architects to oversee the renovation. The renovation took two-years, at a cost of ¬£35m. During the works, two rare painted zinc ceilings from the 1860s (one forms part of the ceiling of the round reading room and another is located above the lobby entrance) and a fine 1901 tessellated floor were discovered. Former president of RIBA, Maxwell Hutchinson commented on the project, \\"I have to say that this is one of the best marriages between an important redundant building and a new use I've come across in a very long time.\\" The library was opened by Queen Elizabeth II in November 2002, and the project received the 2003 City Heritage Award. The library was named after Sir Deryck Maughan, an alumnus of King's, who together with Lady Maughan made a ¬£4m donation towards the new university library. It is the largest new university library in Britain since World War II. The surviving part of the chapel is called the Weston Room, following a donation from the Garfield Weston Foundation, and is used to as an exhibition space for the Foyle Special Collections Library. The Weston Room incorporates many features from the former Rolls Chapel, including stained glass windows, a mosaic floor, and three 16th and 17th century funerary monuments. One is a Renaissance terracotta figure by Pietro Torrigiano of John Yonge (d. 1516), Master of the Rolls and Dean of York, described as the \\"earliest Renaissance monument in England\\". The Tudor roses and a lunette of angels found on the back of the sarcophagus resemble those on Henry VII's monument, also by Torrigiano, located in Westminster Abbey. Another is of Richard Allington (d. 1561), and is probably the work of one of the Curl family, Flemish master masons to the Crown. A third is of Lord Bruce of Kinloss (d. 1616), Master of the Rolls. It depicts him with his daughter, who was married in the Rolls Chapel to the future Earl of Devonshire and his son, who would be created Earl of Elgin. The stained glass windows display the arms of former Master of the Rolls, including those of Henry Prince of Wales, Sir Thomas Egerton, Sir Robert Cecil and Sir Edward Phelips, and date from 1611. Stained glass panels of the coat of arms of George IV dated 1823 were originally placed in the east window of the chapel and were rediscovered during the restoration works in 2002. Their restoration was funded by The Crown Estate to mark the opening of the library.Plaque beneath display. The building has 1,250 networked reader places in a variety of environments including individual study carrels and group study rooms. Holdings The Maughan holds more than 750,000 items including books, journals, CDs, records, DVDs, theses and exam papers. These items cover four of the College's academic schools of study: Arts and Humanities, Law, Natural & Mathematical Sciences and Social Science & Public Policy. This includes the Chartered Institute of Taxation's Tony Arnold Library and the post-1850 collection of Sion College. The library also holds more than 150,000 78rpm records donated by the BBC in 2001 which span a wide range of genres. In addition to the main catalogue the library holds special collections, and archives which contain around 5 million documents in total. =Foyle Special Collections Library= The library is also home to the Foyle Special Collections Library, named in recognition of a grant from the Foyle Foundation, which houses approximately 170,000 printed works, as well as maps, slides, sound recordings and manuscript material. Included among the manuscript material is the Carnegie Collection of British Music, a collection of original signed manuscripts, many of them by notable composers, whose publication was funded by the philanthropist Andrew Carnegie via the Carnegie UK Trust. The collection also contains several volumes of incunabula (works printed before 1501). The collections range in date from the fifteenth century to the present day. In 2007 the library acquired the historical collections of the British Foreign and Commonwealth Office, which includes Britain's 1812 declaration of war on the US, and contains over 60,000 items. The collections include: * HG Adler Collection * Jeremy Adler Collection * Box Collection * The Carnegie Collection of British Music * Cohn Collection * College Collection * De Beer Collection * Early Science Collection * The Foreign and Commonwealth Office Historical Collection * Guy's Hospital Physical Society Collection * Institute for the Study and Treatment of Delinquency Collection * King's College School of Medicine and Dentistry Historical Collection * Miscellaneous Collection * Rainbow Collection * Reginald Ruggles Gates Collection * The Stebbing Collection * St Thomas' Hospital Historical Collection * Wheatstone Collection A view from one of the postgraduate study carrels at the Clock Tower at dusk. =Liddell Hart Centre for Military Archives= Established in 1964, the Liddell Hart Centre for Military Archives (LHCMA) is a leading repository for research into modern defence policy in the United Kingdom. The collections are of national and international importance and were awarded Designated Status by the Museums, Libraries and Archives Council in 2005. The core of the collection comprises the private papers of over 700 senior British military personnel who held office since 1900. Other highlights include the former private library of Captain Sir Basil Liddell Hart, after whom the centre is named. Garden 170px The garden opposite the library was originally owned by Clifford's Inn, and part of the garden was acquired by the Public Record Office in 1912. Following the acquisition of the site by King's a new garden was commissioned. The garden was designed by George Carter and won the Metropolitan Public Gardens Association's London Spade Award in 2003. The design is based on three 'green rooms' designed to complement the original storeroom cells of the building. There is an emphasis on shades of green rather than colour planting, with the use of hornbeam, lime and yew. The garden has two sculptures and a small water feature. One of the sculptures is by Dorothy Brook, and a bronze statue of Confucius, located in the centre 'room', was donated by The Confucian Academy in 2010 to mark the official launch of the Lau China Institute. A series of relief plaques of the continents by Walter Crane are installed on a small brick building now used for storing bicycles. These were formerly on St Dunstan's House situated on Fetter Lane, which was demolished in 1976, and the grounds where the house was situated paved the way for new luxury residential apartments to be built. In fiction The dodecagonal reading room is one of the locations consulted by Robert Langdon and Sophie Neveu in chapters 92 and 95 of the Dan Brown novel, The Da Vinci Code. The library was also used as a filming location for exterior shots of the Tower of London in the 2003 film, Johnny English. Part of the music video of the song Twilight's Chapter Seven from the album Still Fantasy by Taiwanese musician Jay Chou was filmed at the Maughan. The use of the round reading room as a filming location for Dumbledore's Office in the Harry Potter films has been the source of considerable talk and rumour, however, a feature in an edition of the King's Library Newsletter confirms that this is in fact a myth, though the library receives several requests to film each month. Residence The top floor of the Chancery Lane wing of the library building is used a residence for the Principal of King's College London during his term.

In 1920 it also opened branches in Cambridge, Wrexham and Fort William. By 1921 the works, including a second building on the opposite side of Coombe Road, employed about 2,000 men who were referred to it by the Ministry of Labour. New men received six months training, during which they were paid a maintenance allowance by the government, and were then virtually guaranteed employment at a good wage. The factory had a well-equipped clinic to provide ongoing care for the employees, many of whom were amputees or otherwise severely disabled. The business did not do well and closed in 1923, but reopened later the same year. It finally went into receivership in 1924.

It also inhibits biosynthesis and action of those prostaglandins which cause platelet disaggregation, vasodilation and increased capillary permeability. Indications Prophylaxis and control of haemorrhages from small blood vessels, neonatal intraventricular haemorrhage,Martindale, The Complete Drug Reference, 36th edition, page: 1065 Drug-Etamsylate capillary bleeding of different etiology, including: menorrhagia and metrorrhagia without organic pathology, after trans-urethral resection of the prostate, hematemesis, melena, hematuria, epistaxis; secondary bleeding due to thrombocytopenia or thrombocytopathia, hypocoagulation, prevention of periventricular hemorrhages in prematurely born children. Mechanism of action Etamsylate is a haemostatic agent; also promotes angioprotective and proaggregant action. It stimulates thrombopoiesis and their release from bone marrow. Haemostatic action is due to activation of thromboplastin formation on damaged sites of small blood vessels and decrease of PgI2 (Prostacyclin I2) synthesis; it also facilitates platelet aggregation and adhesion, that at last induce decrease and stop of hemorrhage. The precise mechanism of action of etamsylate is unknown. It has been shown to reduce bleeding time and blood loss from wounds. This appears to relate to increased platelet aggregation mediated by a thromboxane A2 or prostaglandin F2a dependent mechanism. It has also been associated with decreased concentrations of 6-oxoprostaglandin F1a, a stable metabolite of prostacyclin. Prostacyclin is a potent vasodilator, and may be implicated in reperfusion; it is also a disaggregator of platelets. Whereas prostaglandins themselves may have a role in regulating cerebral blood flow, etamsylate appears to have no effect on cerebral blood flow. Etamsylate was also thought to stabilise capillaries, reinforcing capillary membranes by polymerising hyaluronic acid. Etamsylate limits capillary bleeding through its action on hyaluronic acid and initial studies showed a reduction in intraventricular haemorrhage.Martindale, The Complete Drug Reference, 36th edition - page 1050 Etamsylate may also have an effect on the microcirculation, encouraging platelet aggregation and vasoconstriction and therefore haemostasis. It also inhibits the effects of the prostaglandin mediated vasodilatation and increased capillary permeability, thereby reducing oedema secondary to capillary leakage. It is also possible that etamsylate would reduce reperfusion haemorrhage in ischaemic areas of the brain, preventing secondary damage. By inhibiting the effects of prostaglandins, etamsylate may exert an effect by closing the patent ductus and thereby increasing cerebral blood flow.

In the second half of the 19th century Poles living under Russian, Prussian and Austrian rule as a result of partitions of Poland, were looking for every opportunity to celebrate important events from the Polish history, reminding them of Poland's past glories. At the time Austria-Hungary had the most liberal policy towards ethnic minorities. The province of Galicia, created from the areas taken over from Poland, with Polish as one of the official languages, was the most obvious location for such celebrations. Lviv, Galicia's capital (now western Ukraine), was chosen for the occasion. The city's Polish population of all ages and classes offered voluntary labour to build the mound. The work was carried out without any prior engineering advice, using locally available materials, including stones from the ruins of High Castle. In 1906 a part of the mound collapsed and had to be rebuilt. There is an observation platform at the top of the mound (altitude 413 m), offering a vantage viewpoint over Lviv.

Merrie Melodies cartoon directed by Friz Freleng. The short was released on March 27, 1937. The title is derived from the cartoon's theme song, written by Charlie Abbott. Plot When the kids fight over a coin for ice cream, J. Field Mouse tells his grandchildren the story of a mouse whose greed and dishonesty became his undoing. Feigning blindness and playing the fiddle, he collects enough money to live an opulent lifestyle. His home, marked by a shabby exterior, turns out to be a mansion where he lives it up with his riches. All the fiddler's luxury is in jeopardy when the tax assessor knocks on the door. The fiddler hurriedly presses a series of buttons to hide his opulence and make his home look like a hovel. He succeeds in confusing the tax assessor to the point that he flees in frustration, but an eavesdropping cat plays on the fiddler's greed and lures him into his jaws by placing a gold coin there. And that, says J. Field Mouse to his grandchildren, was the end of the greedy mouse. One of the grandchildren asked if the greedy mouse got eaten. The grandfather said, \\"Yes, he ate him all up,\\". But one of his grandchildren notices a gold (cat's?) tooth hanging on display and realizes that things weren't quite what they seem.

Agriculture, forestry, recreation, and tourism have been the main activities found within this region. History In 1863, Thomas-L√©andre Brassard settled near the falls of Pine Lake (Lac des Pins) where he built a mill and a manor. Three years later, there were 136 inhabitants. In 1870, the post office opened. By 1883, the Parish of Saint- Michel-des-Saints was officially formed and followed two years later in 1885 by the formation of the parish municipality. The name Saint-Michel-des-Saints, chosen by Ignace Bourget at the suggestion of Father Brassard, honours Michael de Sanctis who lived from 1591 to 1625. In 1929, the dam on the Matawin River was constructed that would result in the formation of the Taureau Reservoir. This reservoir drowned the neighbouring village of Saint-Ignace-du-Lac (founded in 1877) and so that municipality was annexed by Saint-Michel-des- Saints in 1931, thereby increasing its territory by about . In 1979, the Parish Municipality of Saint-Michel-des-Saints and the United Township Municipality of Masson-et-Laviolette (founded in 1914) were merged to form the new Municipality of Saint-Michel-des-Saints. In 2018, a flood occurred in late April and early May.  Geography  Saint-Michel-des-Saints is the largest and northernmost municipality in the Lanaudi√®re region (not considering the unorganized territories). The village itself is located at the northern end of Quebec Route 131 along the Matawin River, near the south-western corner of Taureau Reservoir.

These boats had a long building time, being laid down in 1931 and completed in 1936. They were double hull boats with eight compartments. Their main shortcomings were underpowered machinery, a long diving time and poor seakeeping. Weakness in hull strength had to be remedied by stiffening and weight cutting.

It is located 430 km north of Riyadh, 94.2 km from the Kuwait border, and about 74.3 from the Iraq border. The city lies in the dry valley of the Wadi al-Batin, which is part of the longer valley of the river Wadi al-Rummah (now dry), which leads inland toward Medina and formerly emptied into the Persian Gulf. History In the 1st century after hijrah or 638 CE, Hafar Al-Batin was just a route in the desert that pilgrims passed through traveling to Mecca for Hajj. At that time, there was no water available in this land, so the pilgrims travelled from Iraq to Mecca on a long route without water. During the reign of Uthman (644 - 656 CE), many pilgrims complained about the lack of water, and Abu-Musa al-Asha'ari, a companion of the Islamic prophet Muhammad responded by digging new wells along the route in the Al-Batin valley. The name of Hafar Al-Batin (, \\"the hole of Al-Batin Valley\\") is derived from this. The Saudi Arabia Ministry of Housing announced on August 2020 that they would be including Hafr Al Batin in its program to increase residential ownership by its citizens. The ministry will be providing 759 plots in Hafr Al Batin alone .

When a wearable computer embodies HI > and becomes so technologically advanced that its intelligence matches our > own biological brain, something much more powerful emerges from this synergy > that gives rise to superhuman intelligence within the single ‚Äúcyborg‚Äù > being.\\"The Society of Intelligent Veillance\\", by Kurzweil, Minsky, and Mann, > in Proceedings of the IEEE ISTAS 2013, Toronto, Ontario, Canada, pp13-17. More generally (beyond only wearable computing), HI describes the creation of intelligence that results from a feedback loop between a computational process and a human being, where the human and computer are inextricably intertwined. In the field of human-computer interaction (HCI) it has been common to think of the human and computer as separate entities. HCI emphasizes this separateness by treating the human and computer as different entities that interact. However, HI theory thinks of the wearer and the computer with its associated input and output facilities not as separate entities, but regards the computer as a second brain and its sensory modalities as additional senses, in which synthetic synesthesia merges with the wearer's senses. When a wearable computer functions in a successful embodiment of HI, the computer uses the human's mind and body as one of its peripherals, just as the human uses the computer as a peripheral. This reciprocal relationship is at the heart of HI.

Early career  Born in Berlin, Heinz Waaske started his career as a precision mechanic apprentice at Telefunken in Sickingenstra√üe in Berlin, where he studied from 1939 to 1942. After serving in the German army during World War II, being severely wounded and taken prisoner, he joined Krenzin in Berlin-Kreuzberg. There he encountered camera technology for the first time, and developed a great taste for it. For financial reasons, he could not study engineering. He started designing a 16mm miniature camera in his spare time, and sold the prototype in 1948 for 3.000 Marks.  Work with Wirgin  Edixa Reflex-B Wirgin Wiesbaden 16mm kleinstbild Kamera Edixa 16MB From 1948, Waaske transferred to the Wirgin brothers company in Wiesbaden. He worked as a precision mechanic and soon rose to head of the prototype workshop, to technical designer, and eventually to chief designer. He first improved the medium format 6x9 cameras, allowing cheaper manufacturing procedures. By then a chief designer, he decided to design a mirror reflex camera, which materialised as the Edixa miniature reflex. Wirgin joined the club of the renowned mirror reflex manufacturers. Waaske further designed all the successors to the Edixa, including the Edixamat reflex and the Edixa Electronica. When he designed the Edixa 16, Waaske had to design the shutter himself, as suppliers could not provide sufficiently small mechanisms. The Edixa 16 was a camera using the 16 mm film cartridges by Rollei, a cheaper alternative to the expensive Rollei cameras. Waaske had understood that there was a market for small cameras which would use 135 film rather than the ultra- miniature formats. He made the design in his living room and had Wirgin Musterbau manufacture the parts for the prototype. When Waaske showed the prototype to Wirgin Musterbau, he was told \\"So, you've wasted my time and my equipment for your own projects?\\" Wirgin then left the camera business and the company closed. At the time, the only other camera manufacturers were Leitz and Kodak, who had no interest in hiring Waaske.  Career with Rollei  Rollei 35S Waaske joined Rollei in January 1965, and at first did not mention his attempts for a compact 135 camera. The chief of development, Richard Wei√ü, had him work on the Rolleiflex SL 26. When Waaske showed his pocket camera prototype to Heinrich Peesel, the head of Rollei, he was so enthusiastic about it that he decided the camera should immediately be developed further by Waaske for mass production, but using parts only from Rollei's suppliers.The Rollei 35 story The Rollei 35 was introduced at photokina 1966 and became instantly an international success. Later, Waaske introduced improvements in the loading system of small format reflex cameras which were mass-produced with the Rollei Rolleiflex SL2000F. Waaske's last contribution to Rollei was the Rolleimatic, which was designed to be as easy to use as the Instamatic camera, but use the 135 format, allowing for a better image quality. Waaske resigned his position at Rollei in 1978, before the introduction of the Rolleimatic on the market, in 1980.  Career as independent engineer  From 1978, Waaske had his own technical design office in Braunschweig, working not only on cameras but also, for instance, on loudspeaker systems which went into production with Blaupunkt. His work was characterised by a \\"technical minimalism\\", with small and scarse pieces providing as many functions as possible. Waaske was very inclined towards practical usefulness, and he was very critical of the collection edition of the Rollei 35, with casing made of precious metal. His aim was at providing compact and functional to everybody. He also tartly rejected requests for designing military equipment, arguing that after his experience of the Second World War, he had had enough with war. He died in 1995 in Braunschweig, and a street of the city was named Heinz Waaske Weg in his honour.

Geography The Gulf lies to the east of Massawa, near the midpoint of the Eritrean coast. It is located between the Foro Subregion and the Buri Peninsula of the Ghela'elo Subregion, both in the country's Northern Red Sea region. On the west side of the gulf are two large mountains, Jebel Gedem and Mount Arbalu . Between the two, the Aligede River flows, with the village of Zula on its right bank. The coast of the gulf is fringed with mangroves on either side of the mouth of the river. The egyptologist Henry Salt identified Zula as the ancient archaeological site of Adulis.Bowerson, G.W. Throne of Adulis. Oxford University Press (London), 2013. Near the head of the gulf is the village of Arafali, beside the extinct Dola Volcano . From here, several roads radiate into the surrounding areas. To the east of the gulf lies the Buri Peninsula. This generally low-lying, undulating area is composed of lava flows at the southern end and granite at the north. Fringing reefs border much of this coast. About beyond Arafali is Dolphin Cove, with a low, flat beach, backed by a steep rise to Mount Abdur behind. further on is the narrow Melita Bay with the village of Macanille at its head. Here there are coastal reefs and mangrove swamps. The Gulf of Zula is a deep water bay, formed as part of the complex rifting system that occurred in these parts where three tectonic plates meet. The rift continues inland to the Danakil Depression, a sandy plain lying below sea level. The gulf also marks the territorial division between the Saho people and the Afar people.

Motoring A surviving 1904 \\"English Mechanic\\" car In the May 1899 issue there was an article by T Hyler-White (1871‚Äì1920) on a motor tricycle that could be powered by a 1.75 hp De Dion- Bouton. Following this and starting in January 1900 there appeared a series of 56 further articles entitled \\"A small car and how to build it\\", containing the plans for what was probably the UK's first kit car. The design was based on the Benz Velo, and it was suggested that a Benz engine should be used and to keep down costs various secondhand parts should be used, although some new castings were made available with a machining service if required. Further series of articles appeared with more designs including in 1901 a steam car, in 1902 a steam-3 wheeler, in 1904 a 5 hp twin-cylinder car, in 1909 a single- cylinder engined runabout and finally in 1913 a cyclecar. It is not known how many cars were built following the plans but at least four survive. They are collectively known today as \\"English Mechanics\\" but it is probable that a variety of names was used at the time.

Born in Germany, he emigrated to Philadelphia in 1809 and soon became a member of the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts. Initially influenced by Scotland's David Wilkie, England's William Hogarth and America's Benjamin West, he soon turned to direct observation of life for his genre scenes. He was among the first artists in America to portray free blacks, such as in Black People's Prayer Meeting (1813). Among his still frequently reproduced paintings are Fourth of July, Center Square (1811/12) and Election Day (1815), both filled with lively characterizations of scores of crowd members. Krimmel died in a swimming accident at the age of 35. Among the prominent American artists influenced by Krimmel's work are William Sidney Mount, George Caleb Bingham, and Thomas Eakins. Early work Country Wedding (1820) Johann Ludwig Krimmel was born on May 30, 1786 in the small town of Ebingen in the south German Duchy of W√ºrttemberg. In 1809, Johann Ludwig decided to join his older brother, who had immigrated to Philadelphia. Initially he planned to engage in business with his brother, but soon abandoned this occupation for art. Though he may have had some watercolor lessons in London, Johann Ludwig had no real formal training in art when he reached Philadelphia about November 1, 1809. The 1812 city directory listed Krimmel (who by now had Anglicized his name to John Lewis) as a painter. He began by painting portraits, but, a copy of David Wilkie's Blind Fiddler falling in his way, his attention was turned to humorous subjects. He also painted historical pictures. At that time Philadelphia was the intellectual and cultural center of the United States. Here Krimmel soon joined the first known sketch club in America whose members included Thomas Sully and Rembrandt Peale. His first painting to excite public notice was Pepper-Pot: a Scene in the Philadelphia Market, 1811. The oil depicted a black woman ladling out bowls of her uniquely Philadelphian spicy soup to white customers of various ages, heights and social classes. This genre scene or depiction of contemporary everyday life was soon followed by many more in his sketchbooks and canvases like Blind Man's Buff (1814) and Country Wedding (1814). In all of his known oils, Krimmel included at least one animal (usually a frisky dog) sometimes two or three. Pavel Svinyin, a Russian on a diplomatic mission to Philadelphia between 1811 and 1813, apparently bought roughly 14 sketches from Krimmel and presented them back in Russia along with works from a variety of sources as typical American scenes which he had painted. The pictures in the so-called Svinin Portfolio include Black People's Prayer Meeting, Deck Life on One of Fulton's Steamboats and Morning in Front of Arch Street Meeting House, which showed Quakers in their Sunday best. The Svinin Portfolio is now in the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York. Though formerly thought to be Svinin's own work, the watercolors are now generally attributed to Krimmel. Best known pictures Fourth of July Celebration in Centre Square, Philadelphia (1819) Krimmel's works are still often reproduced in schoolbooks, historical works and magazines. Election Day 1815, perhaps his most famous painting, best illustrates Krimmel's ability to individualize crowd members with humorous observations. Fourth of July Celebration in Centre Square, Philadelphia, 1819 brims with patriotism and a spirit of unity in a neoclassical design. In Quilting Frolic guests and their black fiddler burst in to celebrate the finishing of a quilt before the needlework and clean-up of the room are quite finished. Art historian Guy McElroy has identified this work as one of the first \\"to utilize physiognomical distortions [wide toothy grins and over-sized lips] as a basic element in the depiction of African Americans...\\" The depiction of a mother and daughter trying to persuade the drunken father to come home has caused historians of the temperance movement to praise In an American Inn as the first work of an American artist to illustrate this issue. Krimmel's sketchbooks Krimmel recorded ideas for his pictures in a series of sketchbooks he kept between 1810 and 1821. From late 1816 to 1818, he travelled back to his home region as well as to Vienna and Salzburg, and his sketchbooks are filled with sketches of European landscapes, people, animals, and flowers. His encounters with local artists influenced his style to become more maturely romantic. Some of Krimmel's now lost paintings are known from detailed sketches, such as The Tea Party. Seven of Krimmel's sketchbooks are now in the library at the Winterthur Museum, Garden and Library. They contain approximately 700 separate drawings, ranging from quick pencil sketches to finished watercolor pictures, which have been useful in authenticating unsigned paintings of Krimmel that surface from time to time. Two sketches in his second sketchbook capture a typical Moravian Christmas home celebration and represent what are probably the earliest depictions of a Christmas tree in American art. = Watercolor pictures in the Metropolitan Museum of Art = File:\\"Worldly Folk\\" Questioning Chimney Sweeps and Their Master before Christ Church, Philadelphia MET ap42.95.15.jpg\\"Worldly Folk\\" Questioning Chimney Sweeps and Their Master before Christ Church, Philadelphia File:Black Sawyers Working in front of the Bank of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia MET ap42.95.16.jpgBlack Sawyers Working in front of the Bank of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia File:Winter Scene in Philadelphia‚ÄîThe Bank of the United States in the Background MET DT1803.jpgWinter Scene in Philadelphia‚ÄîThe Bank of the United States in the Background File:Sunday Morning in front of the Arch Street Meeting House, Philadelphia MET APS2369.jpgSunday Morning in front of the Arch Street Meeting House, Philadelphia File:Nightlife in Philadelphia‚Äîan Oyster Barrow in front of the Chestnut Street Theater MET ap42.95.18.jpgNightlife in Philadelphia‚Äîan Oyster Barrow in front of the Chestnut Street Theater File:Members of the City Troop and Other Philadelphia Soldiery MET ap42.95.21.jpgMembers of the City Troop and Other Philadelphia Soldiery File:Exhibition of Indian Tribal Ceremonies at the Olympic Theater, Philadelphia MET DP276570.jpgExhibition of Indian Tribal Ceremonies at the Olympic Theater, Philadelphia File:Merrymaking at a Wayside Inn MET ap42.95.12.jpgMerrymaking at a Wayside Inn Death and legacy On July 15, 1821, Krimmel went swimming near Germantown in a millpond and drowned. He was engaged to be married at the time of his death. Though Krimmel had been a painter only 11 years, his star was definitely on the rise. He had recently been elected President of Association of American Artists. He had also received a prestigious commission for a large historical work, a 6-foot by 9 foot canvas commemorating the landing of William Penn at New Castle, Delaware in October 1682. Though Krimmel's genre scenes found few buyers during his lifetime, engravings of his work made long after his death were widely circulated as prints and magazine illustrations. He is recognized as the most significant American painter to consistently chronicle American life from 1810 to 1821.

It is named after Plegmund, who later became Archbishop of Canterbury, and who is believed to have lived as a hermit nearby. The well is situated on the edge of a low cliff to the east of which is one of the channels of the River Gowy. It is one of two holy wells in west Cheshire. An inscribed sandstone curb was added in 1907 which was dedicated by the Venerable E. Barber, Archdeacon of Chester, on 11 November 1907. The earliest documentary evidence of the well is in a quitclaim dated 1301. A survey of the well was carried out in 1995 which found that it is a square stone-lined pit with two large slabs on either side and two steps down from the southern side beside the road. In the bottom of the well is a ceramic pipe which has been inserted at a later date. At the time of the survey there was water present up to the level of the first step. The cover slabs show some signs of damage but there was no sign of the curbs added in 1907. Looking down the well It is said to have been used for baptisms up to the 20th century. In the 1990s, it was noticed that the hawthorn tree overhanging the well was dressed periodically and during the later 1990s, archaeologists from Chester City Council led local children on a well dressing walk on St Plegmund's feast day (2 August).

This is the second adaptation of the play; the first one was filmed in 1964 by Erast Garin. Leonid Serebrennikov performed the main theme in the film (\\"Nelepo, smeshno, bezrassudno, bezumno, volshebno..\\"). Music by Gennadi Gladkov. Lyrics by Yuli Kim. Plot The protagonist of the film, the Wizard (Oleg Yankovsky), invents a fairy tale to amuse himself and his wife (Irina Kupchenko). The tale's characters come to life, come to his house and set out to live their lives. Many years ago, the Wizard came up with a \\"reverse\\" fairy tale, turning a bear into a human (Aleksandr Abdulov), who would transform back into a bear as soon as a princess falls in love with him and kisses him. Now, the young man returns to the Wizard's house where he meets a beautiful girl (Yevgeniya Simonova), and they immediately fall in love with each other. To his dismay, she turns out to be a princess ‚Äì the Wizard made it so that a king who was just passing by with his daughter and his suite felt a sudden urge to stop by the estate. When the Princess, clueless about the young man's origin, wants to kiss him, he flees in horror. The Princess hurries after him, dressed as a boy. They meet in a tavern called \\"Emilia\\", but the Bear, unable to recognize the Princess, summons her to a duel. However, when the Princess cries out \\"Daddy\\" during the battle, the Bear realizes that she deceived him. In anger, he goes to the innkeeper and begs to be to locked up, as the tavern is covered with snow and it is impossible to get out. The innkeeper gives him the key to a room. He draws his attention to one of the court ladies and recognizes in her his first love Emilia, in whose honor he named the inn. The innkeeper and Emilia decide to help the quarreled lovers. The Princess locks herself in a room on the second floor of the inn and promises to shoot anyone who would come to her. The King orders to draw lots and the lot comes out for the court Minister Administrator (Andrei Mironov). The Administrator comes to the Princess, and a shot rings out ‚Äì leaving behind the Princess, the administrator shoots her, but misses. The Princess angrily decides to marry the first courter and announces the Administrator to be her fiance. The King decides to play a wedding. Desperate, his love taken away from him, the Bear decides to tell all about the princess kiss that would turn him into a beast, but the Princess rejects him. The wedding procession leaves. The Hunter and the Bear remain in the tavern. The Wizard appears and tells the Bear that he was disappointed in his behavior. He calls the Bear a coward. In the opinion of the Wizard the Bear should have kissed the princess. The fact that he didn't do that shows that he does not love the princess so much as to sacrifice his human form. The Bear and the Hunter make an agreement under which, if ever the Bear is to kiss the Princess and to turn into an animal, the Hunter will kill him. Exactly one year passes by. The country is actually ruled by the Administrator instead of the King. The Princess is slowly dying of longing for the Bear. The Wizard intentionally does not let the Bear in the country and into his house, because he thinks that the tale with a sad end has much more to teach people, and stories with a happy ending are just for children. As the Princess feels death coming, the Bear appears in the house of the Wizard. The Hunter is aiming the gun at the Bear. The Bear kisses the princess, but does not turn into a bear, and stays a man. The Wizard explains this paradox to be an ordinary miracle. The characters leave the Wizard's house that turns out to be all scenery. The decorations burn and the Wizard is left alone.

The company was founded in 1926 and it finally ceased to exist on 2 May 2013 when it was merged into E.ON Global Commodities SE (now: Uniper Global Commodities SE). History Ruhrgas AG was founded in 1926 as a natural gas transportation company by Vereinigte Stahlwerke AG and Zeche Mathias Stinnes as Aktiengesellschaft f√ºr Kohleverwertung. The newly founded company took over the distribution of the coal gas produced in the coking plants Vereinigte Stahlwerke AG and Zeche Mathias Stinne. In 1928, Aktiengesellschaft f√ºr Kohleverwertung acquired pipeline network from RWE AG. Consequently, the company was renamed Ruhrgas AG. By the end of the decade, gas supply contracts were signed with Cologne, D√ºsseldorf, Hanover, and Saarbr√ºcken. By 1930, total sales of coal gas by Ruhrgas amounted to , and its pipeline network covered . By 1936, its pipeline network accounted and the company delivered of coal gas from 32 coking plants. Among other industries, it delivered gas to Adam Opel works. In 1938, natural gas was found near Bad Bentheim. In 1939, at the request of the Reich Ministry of Economics requested Ruhrgas to integrate the gas deposit into the existing pipeline network. However, due to the World War II, it was not until 1944 that a pipeline from ad Bentheim to the chemical works in H√ºls was completed. During the World War II a lot of the gas infrastructure was destruction. However, by the end of 1945, the pipeline network was 90% restored. In the 1940s, Ruhrgas in cooperation with Lurgi Gesellschaft f√ºr W√§rmetechnik G.m.b.H. developed the Lurgi‚ÄìRuhrgas process, a process for a low-temperature liquefaction of lignite (brown coal) and oil shale. In 1948, Ruhrgas together with Thyssengas jstarted coal gas export to the Netherlands. By 1965, the Ruhrgas pipeline network was expanded up to and the total sales of gas was , of which 10% was natural gas. In 1970, Ruhrgas signed the first contract to import natural gas from the Soviet Union, becoming the largest natural gas import and distribution company in Germany. In 1971, Ruhrgas started supplying natural gas to Switzerland through the Trans Europa Naturgas Pipeline in cooperation with Snam and Swissgas. In 1973, it signed a contract to buy natural gas from the North Sea Ekofisk field through the Norpipe pipeline. Deliveries from Norway started in 1977. In 1973, Ruhrgas started to buy Soviet gas through East Germany to supply West Berlin. In 1975, Ruhrgas and Gaz de France formed a partnership Mittel-Europ√§ische-Gasleitungsgesellschaft to build the MEGAL pipeline for transportation of Russian natural gas to France and southern Germany. The pipeline was commissioned in 1980. In 1982, it signed a contract with Soyuzgasexport supporting construction of the Urengoy‚ÄìPomary‚ÄìUzhgorod pipeline.Bros et al. (2017), p. 12 At the same year, Ruhrgas joined the consortium to import natural gas from Statfjord field. Deliveries started after commissioning the Statpipe pipeline in 1985. In 1998, Ruhrgas owned a pipeline network of with 26 compressor stations and 12 underground storage facilities. It sold of natural gas. In 1999, the company donated US$3.5 million for restoration of the Amber Room. Ruhrgas was acquired by energy company E.ON in March 2003. On 1 July 2004, the company was renamed accordingly E.ON Ruhrgas. That time, it became the largest foreign shareholder in the Russian gas company Gazprom by 6.5% of shares. These shares were bought back by Gazprom in October 2009 as a result of the asset-swap deal between E.On and Gazprom. As a result of thedeal, E.ON Ruhrgas acquired a 25% stake, minus three ordinary registered shares plus three preference non-voting shares in Severneftegazprom, an operator of the Yuzhno-Russkoye field.Bros et al. (2017), p. 21 In June 2005, E.ON Ruhrgas acquired 51 % of the Romanian gas utility DistriGaz Nord and renamed it E.ON Gaz Rom√¢nia. On 8 September 2005, E.ON Ruhrgas signed an agreement to participate in the Nord Stream project. The pipeline became operational in 2011. By 2008, E.ON Ruhrgas owned of pipelines. In July 2010, E.ON Ruhrgas acquired 15% of the shares in the Trans Adriatic Pipeline project. On 1 September 2010, based on the European Union Third Energy Package, the gas transportation and gas storage operations of E.ON Ruhrgas were transferred to E.ON Gastransport and renamed Open Grid Europe. On 2 May 2013, E.ON Ruhrgas was merged with E.ON Global Commodities SE, now part of Uniper. The name Ruhrgas is still used by Uniper Ruhrgas International GmbH, a subsidiary of Uniper. It was founded as E.ON Ruhrgas International GmbH in 1994, after takeover of Ruhrgas by E.ON on the basis of Ruhrgas international activities.

Background  It is not known when Li Yiyan was born. His family was from Wei Prefecture (È≠èÂ∑û, part of modern Handan, Hebei), but his ancestors were said to be originally from Longxi (Èö¥Ë•ø, in modern Tianshui, Gansu), thus sharing an origin with Tang Dynasty's imperial Li clan, but he was considered sufficiently distant not to be considered an imperial clan member.Compare with New Book of Tang, vol. 131 (biographies of imperial clan members who served as chancellors). His father Li Xuande (ÊùéÁéÑÂæ∑) served as the county magistrate of Yingtao County (Áô≠Èô∂, in modern Xingtai, Hebei). Li Yiyan himself passed the imperial examinations when he was young, and subsequently served as the sheriff of Taiyuan County. At that time, he served under the famed general Li Shiji, who served as the commandant at Bing Prefecture (Âπ∂Â∑û, i.e., Taiyuan). Because of Li Shiji's accomplishments and reputation, the other subordinate officials were all fearful of him and dared not to speak on important matters with him, but Li Yiyan was said to be unafraid of the commandant and was willing to discuss matters of importance. As a result, Li Shiji respected him.As Li Shiji started his stint as commandant at Bing Prefecture sometime between 626 and 629 and was recalled to the capital to serve as minister of defense in 641, these events must have occurred sometime during those years.  During Emperor Gaozong's reign  During the Linde era (of Emperor Gaozong's reign (664-665), Li Yiyan served as the magistrate of Baishui County (ÁôΩÊ∞¥, in modern Weinan, Shaanxi) and was said to be capable as a county magistrate. He was subsequently promoted to be a mid-low-level official at the ministry of justice, and was eventually promoted to the post of Zhongshu Shilang (‰∏≠Êõ∏‰æçÈÉé) -- deputy head of the legislative bureau of government (‰∏≠Êõ∏ÁúÅ, Zhongshu Sheng) -- during the Shangyuan era (674-676). In 675, when Emperor Gaozong, because of his chronic illness (which might have been hypertension), considered making his powerful wife Empress Wu (later known as Wu Zetian) regent plenipotentiary, the chancellor Hao Chujun vehemently opposed, and Li concurred with Hao, eventually leading to Emperor Gaozong abandoning the idea. In 676, Li was given the designation Tong Zhongshu Menxia Sanpin (Âêå‰∏≠Êõ∏ÈñÄ‰∏ã‰∏âÂìÅ), making him a chancellor de facto. In 677, he was also made a member of the staff of Emperor Gaozong's crown prince Li Xian. In 680, when Li Xian offended Empress Wu and was deposed on accusation of treason, Li's fellow chancellor and fellow staff member Zhang Da'an was demoted, but Emperor Gaozong pardoned the rest of the staff and retained them for the new crown prince Li Zhe. The staff, including fellow chancellor Xue Yuanchao, all danced in gratitude (as pursuant to ceremonies of thanksgiving at the time), but Li did not dance but was instead blaming himself for Li Xian's downfall‚Äîand this led to much praise from the people. It was said around the same time that Li's mansion did not have a central bedroom. At that time, his brother Li Yijin (ÊùéÁæ©Áí°) was serving on staff of the prefecture of Qi Prefecture (Â≤êÂ∑û, roughly modern Baoji, Shaanxi), and when Li Yijin heard this, he bought good wood and delivered them to Li Yiyan. On a subsequently occasion, when Li Yijin was visiting the capital, he saw that Li Yiyan had not yet used the wood to build a central bedroom, and he asked Li Yiyan about it. Li Yiyan responded, \\"I feel inadequate as a chancellor, and if I build an impressive bedroom, this would bring disaster on me. How is this loving me?\\" Li Yijin responded, \\"Even when a person becomes a county magistrate or sheriff, he would want to build a new house. My brother, you are honored and powerful, why do you live in a small house to bring shame to your subordinates?\\" Li Yiyan further responded, \\"Not everything should be perfect, and blessings will not be doubled. Since I am an honored official, if I expand my mansion, unless I am fully virtuous, I will bring disaster on myself. It is not that I do not want a new bedroom, but that I am afraid of disaster.\\" He therefore never constructed a new bedroom, and eventually, the wood decayed after rain. In 683, Li Yiyan was moving his parents' tomb, and he asked his maternal uncle to move his maternal ancestors' tombs. When Emperor Gaozong heard this, he angrily remarked, \\"Li Yiyan is leaning on his uncle just because he is honored. This person should not be again in charge of important things!\\" When Li heard this, he became disconcerted, and he requested retirement on account of foot illness, which Emperor Gaozong granted, and Emperor Gaozong further gave him the honorific title Yinqing Guanglu Daifu (ÈäÄÈùíÂÖâÁ•øÂ§ßÂ§´). As Li was about to retire to the vicinity of the eastern capital Luoyang, many officials held a feast in his honor just outside the city gates, and this scene was compared to the grand sendoff that was held for the Han Dynasty officials Shu Guang (ÁñèÂª£) and his nephew Shu Shou (ÁñèÂèó), who retired at the height of their careers.  During Empress Dowager Wu's regency  Emperor Gaozong died in 683, and Empress Wu, as empress dowager, subsequently served as regent over Emperor Zhongzong (Li Zhe), whom she deposed in 684 due to his disobedience to her, and created Emperor Ruizong, both her sons. Early on Emperor Ruizong's Chuigong era (685-689), a recall of Li Yiyan was made, asking him to serve as the prefect of Huai Prefecture (Êá∑Â∑û, roughly modern Jiaozuo, Henan), but Li, knowing that he had previously offended Empress Dowager Wu by opposing her regency, was apprehensive and did not accept the recall. He died in 688.  Notes and references  * Old Book of Tang, vol. 81. * New Book of Tang, vol. 105. * Zizhi Tongjian, vols. 202, 203.

Production, arrangements and keyboards are by Canterbury scene keyboardist Dave Stewart, who also plays guitar, bass and drums. Other players on the album include ex- members of bands Gong, Spooky Tooth and Level 42.  Concept  The title is self-referentially ironic, since progressive rock concept albums are supposed to have \\"heavy concepts\\" but \\"Neil's Heavy Concept Album\\" does not. Also, the front of the album sleeve is a loose parody of The Rolling Stones' Their Satanic Majesties Request album sleeve. The rear parodies the Beatles' Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, with Neil wearing different outfits replacing the images of the four Beatles, and the text \\"A heavy time is guaranteed for all.\\" replacing \\"A splendid time is guaranteed for all.\\" The album followed the success of the Neil single \\"Hole in My Shoe\\" ‚Äî a cover version of Traffic's 1967 hit ‚Äì which reached number 2 in the United Kingdom. The album starts with a spoken apology (\\"Hello Vegetables\\") in which Neil says the album was \\"a hassle to make and there's much too much technology and commercial stuff on it\\". Additional spoken tracks include Neil having a conversation with a potato in a sewer, reciting a poem to his rubber plant Wayne (\\"your roots are in the ground, my roots are in Twickenham\\"), and experiencing a flashback in the track \\"Paranoid Remix\\" which features Beatles- esque backwards noises and voices, and ends with a parody of the last chord from \\"A Day in the Life\\". A parody horror movie commercial, which sees vegetarian Neil being turned into a carnivorous monster after accidentally eating a hamburger leads into the original Planer composition \\"Lentil Nightmare\\", a dark heavy metal number that commences as a pastiche of the eponymous title track of Black Sabbath's debut album Black Sabbath and which subsequently quotes briefly from King Crimson's \\"The Court of the Crimson King\\" and features Planer singing in an uncharacteristic wailing, high falsetto. In the disco/rap number \\"Bad Karma in the UK\\", Neil's mother (played by musician Barbara Gaskin) admonishes him to watch his I Ching, chew his food eleven times, and remember his expectorant. \\"God Save the Queen\\" is performed as a cabaret number by a bad American standup comic who sounds identical to the American \\"comedian\\" Dino, also played by Planer, in The Young Ones episode Bomb. The album was heavily promoted by MTV, who had embraced The Young Ones and served as the sole outlet for the original LP in the US. A television commercial for the album had Neil in character talking about his \\"really beautiful\\" album, displaying a hole in his shoe, and hitting his head on the table he was sitting under.  Track listing  The 1984 cassette version of the album is very similar but features the track \\"Cassette Jam\\" following \\"Cosmic Jam\\" where Neil, realising that the comedy of peanut butter coming around on the LP will not work on the cassette version, redoes the track for cassette and does an impression of the album being tangled on tape and then \\"Brown Sugar\\" where Neil discovers some buskers performing the track by The Rolling Stones, assumes the song is about whole foods and joins in with them. After \\"The Amoeba Song\\", it features two additional tracks: \\"Go Away\\", where Neil tries to explain the album has finished, and the B-side of \\"Hole In My Shoe\\", titled \\"Hurdy Gurdy Mushroom Man\\". There is a title inconsistency on the listing of track 9. The LP lists \\"Paranoid Remix\\" but the vinyl cover has \\"Paranoia Remix\\".

He also published poetry under the pseudonym Adam Drinan.  Biography  Macleod was the son of Scottish parents, and was educated at Rugby School and Balliol College, Oxford. He passed his bar examinations, though never practised as a barrister, preferring a career as an actor, and also had aspirations as a poet. At Rugby he was a close friend of Adrian Stokes, and at Oxford he became a close friend of Graham Greene. From 1927, he was an actor and producer at the experimental Cambridge Festival Theatre. In 1933 he became the theatre's director and lessee. Five of his own plays were staged there, including Overture to Cambridge (1933) and A Woman Turned to Stone (1934). Under Macleod, the theatre became famous throughout Europe for its avant-garde productions, and staging of lesser known works by great playwrights. Macleod staged some of Ezra Pound's Noh plays, and also some Ibsen and Chekhov (his company, The Cambridge Festival Players, was one of the first in the UK to stage Chekhov's play The Seagull). The theatre was forced to close due to financial difficulties in June 1935, and has remained so ever since. He was intermittently involved in theatre production after this, and in 1952 won the Arts Council Silver Medal for his play Leap in September. In 1930, Macleod had his first book of poetry published, The Ecliptic, a highly complex book of verse divided into the signs of the zodiac, which was helped through to publication at Faber and Faber through a recommendation from Ezra Pound, who thought highly of Macleod's abilities as a poet. A long-running correspondence was thus begun between the two poets. Macleod's first book was published alongside W. H. Auden's first book, Poems, and the Poetry (Chicago) editor Morton Dauwen Zabel hailed these two poets as \\"a Dawn in Britain\\" in his editorial.K. Tuma. (1998) Fishing By Obstinate Isles. Evanston, Illinois: Northwestern University Press, pp. 124-125. However, Macleod's next book, Foray of Centaurs, was considered \\"too Greek\\" for publication by Faber and Faber, and although this gained publication in Paris and Chicago, it was never to be published in the UK during Macleod's lifetime. Basil Bunting was an admirer of this early poetry, and claimed Macleod was the most important living British poet in his 'British' edition of Poetry (Chicago). In 1937 he became secretary of Huntingdonshire Divisional Labour Party and stood as a parliamentary candidate, but failed to gain election. In 1938, Macleod became an announcer and newsreader at the BBC, and he began to write and publish poetry under the pseudonym \\"Adam Drinan\\". These poems dealt with the Highland clearances, and described the Scottish landscape in rich detail, using Gaelic assonances. He was one of the first to succeed in rendering the qualities of Gaelic poetry in English. These poems and verse plays won praise from many Scottish writers ‚Äì Naomi Mitchison, Norman MacCaig, Edwin Muir, Compton Mackenzie, George Bruce, Sydney Goodsir Smith, Maurice Lindsay, and many more. Macleod's \\"Drinan\\" poetry was in much demand in both England and Scotland, as well as Ireland and the US. Editors such as Tambimuttu (of Poetry (London)), Maurice Lindsay (Poetry (Scotland)) and John Lehmann (Hogarth Press and New Writing), all requested and published large amounts of his poems in the 1940s. Both \\"Drinan\\" and Macleod are included in Kenneth Rexroth's New British Poets anthology (1949), published for New Directions. The \\"Drinan\\" pseudonym was not publicly revealed until 1953, after which Hugh MacDiarmid commented it was \\"so long one of the best-kept secrets of the contemporary literary world\\".Hugh MacDiarmid. From 'The Poetry of Joseph Macleod' in The Raucle Tongue: Hitherto Uncollected Prose, Volume III, Eds. Angus Calder, Glen Murray and Alan Riach. Manchester: Carcanet Press, p. 312. Adrian Stokes received and dealt with Macleod's 'Drinan' correspondence. Macleod moved to Florence in 1955, where he lived until his death in 1984. His work was re-discovered in the late 1990s, and Cyclic Serial Zeiths From the Flux: The Selected Poems of Joseph Macleod, edited and with an introduction by Andrew Duncan, was published by Waterloo Press in 2008.

First serving Tokugawa Iemitsu as a page, Nobutsuna was renowned for his sagacity. He was named a r≈çj≈´ in 1633. Nobutsuna led the shogunal forces to their final victory over the rebellion at Shimabara. His court title was Izu no Kami, which was the origin of his nickname, . Biography Nobutsuna was born in 1596, the son of ≈åk≈çchi Hisatsuna, a senior retainer of Tokugawa Ieyasu. He was adopted as the heir of his uncle, Matsudaira Masatsuna, in 1601. After being introduced to Hidetada and Ieyasu, he was appointed as page to Ieyasu's grandson Iemitsu. He was greatly admired by Iemitsu, and renowned within the Tokugawa administration for his sagacity. In the early years of his service, he was a hatamoto; he later became a daimyo. In 1623, he received the court title of Izu no Kami. He became daimyo in 1633, receiving the Oshi Domain as his fief. After the failure of Itakura Shigemasa to subdue the rebellion at Shimabara in 1637‚Äì38, Nobutsuna took command of the allied armies laying siege to Hara Castle, bringing the campaign to a successful conclusion. In his later years, he joined senior Tokugawa officials such as Hoshina Masayuki in supporting the underaged 4th sh≈çgun, Ietsuna. In popular culture Nobutsuna is portrayed as one of the two main villains in the manga series Shin Kozure Okami (New Lone Wolf and Cub). His physical appearance in the manga is drawn to make him appear extremely ugly, and even Sh≈çgun Ietsuna calls him \\"as ugly as a toad\\". He is determined to destroy the Satsuma clan partly because he fears that Satsuma will one day become so powerful that it will rise up against the Shogunate but also so that Satsuma's vast wealth will fall into the Shogunate coffers. To that end, he is willing to use any means no matter how despicable, even faking his own death and deliberately disfiguring himself physically in order to impersonate a powerful Satsuma nobleman.

Burman. The film's music director stood his ground as a maestro of classical rhythms on the dholak and raga based melodies. The music of Dastak stood out for its allegiance to the classical traditions of raga-based melodies by its music director Madan Mohan, who managed to get from Lata Mangeshkar, ostensibly her best performance as a playback singer.The Incredibly Sweet Sound - Madan Mohan =Lyrics= The film is known for its poignant lyrics by famous lyricist, Majrooh Sultanpuri, especially in capturing the painful state of the story's female protagonist, Salma -- be it a dramatic statement about the society: \\"Hum hai mataye koocha bazaar ki tarah, Uthti hai har nigaah kharidaar ki tarah\\" or the silent pain of \\"Mai Ri mai ka se Kahoon peer apne jiya ki...\\" =Songs= * \\"Baiyan Na Dharo\\" - Lata Mangeshkar - (based on Raag Charukesi) * \\"Hum Hain Mata-e-koocha-o-bazaar\\" - Lata Mangeshkar * \\"Mai Ri Main Kase Kahoon\\" ‚Äì Lata Mangehskar/Madan Mohan * \\"Tumse Kahoon Ek Baat\\" - Mohammed Rafi References External links Passion for Cinema-Dastak * Dastak, an in-depth study Category:Films featuring a Best Actress National Award-winning performance Category:1970 films Category:Indian films Category:Indian erotic drama films Category:1970s Hindi-language films Category:Indian black-and- white films Category:Films scored by Madan Mohan Category:Indian films based on plays Category:Films featuring a Best Actor National Award-winning performance Category:1970 directorial debut films Category:Films directed by Rajinder Singh Bedi ","title":"Dastak (1970 film)"},{"id":"13632924","text":"Songs Our Daddy Taught Us is the second studio album by close harmony country/rock and roll duo the Everly Brothers, released in 1958.

Opened on 14 July 1924, it was the last street tramway to be built in the UK before the modern era (starting in the late 20th century) and one of the first to shut. It was granted a Light Railway order (under the 1896 Light Railways Act) in 1915, but World War I delayed its opening. A \\"car barn\\" was built at Wombwell, which later became Yorkshire Traction's bus depot, and single deck vehicles were used throughout its nine-year life span. Because of mining in the area the track was laid on wooden sleepers and covered over and was all single track with passing loops, which was the reason for its downfall. When motorbuses started to compete on the same route as the DDLR it was found that because the trams had to wait to pass each other, the bus could complete the journey much quicker and so the electric vehicles had to go. Very few traces of the former DDLR remain now, as the last tram journey reached the end of the line on 30 September 1933, soon to be replaced by the local bus service. The body of a former DDLR car is still in use as a summer house in a garden on the outskirts of Sheffield.

The 2,800 metre pear-shaped turf track consists of several gradient features: it is run uphill from the 2,400 metre mark to the 1,800 metre mark, after which it slopes gently downward for approximately the next 800 metres then uphill again into the nearly flat 500 metre homestretch. A 2,000 metre all-weather \\"Polytrack\\" was constructed inside the existing turf track in 2014 with the first races held in June that year. The track's infield holds the Royal Durban Golf Club's Championship golf course. Greyville Racecourse is host to the prestigious Durban July Handicap and in August, the Greyville Gold Cup, both Group One races that annually draw the best horses from around the country. The history of horse racing in KwaZulu Natal goes back well over 150 years, with the first meeting held in July 1844, close to the site of the present course. Greyville Racecourse celebrated its centenary in 1996, the Durban July was first held in 1897 with only seven horses competing. King George VI, Queen Elizabeth and Princesses Elizabeth and Margaret visited in 1947. Queen Elizabeth II and the Duke of Edinburgh also dropped by in 1995. The track staged South Africa's first-ever Sunday meeting in February 1996 and became the first to race under floodlights. On Thursday 27 June 2019, Hollywoodbets was announced as the naming rights sponsor for both Greyville and Scottsville racecourses in a 3-year deal. The racecourses will now be known as Hollywoodbets Greyville Racecourse and Hollywoodbets Scottsville Racecourse.

However, the Gyata-64 mine has a 300 gram explosive charge compared with the 249 gram charge in a PMN mine. As a result, the Gyata-64 is the most powerful AP blast mine commonly encountered, for which reason it is particularly deadly. To put things in perspective, most anti-personnel blast mines (e.g. the VS-50) contain around 50 grams of explosive, which is enough to destroy all or part of a victim's foot. In marked contrast, the 300 gram charge inside a Gyata-64 mine can easily destroy a victim's entire leg (often requiring amputation high above the knee) in addition to inflicting severe injuries on the adjacent limb, which may also require some form of amputation. The Gyata-64 mine is cylindrical with a plastic body and a black rubber pressure cap. The fuze protrudes from either side of the mine. Although the body is plastic, the fuze itself contains a steel striker and spring, which make it detectable by conventional mine detectors. It is not a blast resistant mine. Hungary ceased production of all antipersonnel mines before 1995 and by 1998 had destroyed its stock pile of 149,686 GYATA-64 mines. Approximately 1,500 were retained for training and research as of 2004. Legacy stockpiles may exist in some foreign countries, in addition to those already planted in existing minefields. Examples have been found in Mozambique, Angola, Lebanon and Yemen. The render safe procedures are the same as those used for the PMN mine.

However, non-network continuum models are also recognized as an important tradition that has provided great insight into spatial economic phenomena; consequently, the journal welcomes with equal enthusiasm submissions based on continuum models.

The film was screened in the Un Certain Regard section at the 1994 Cannes Film Festival. In October, 2007, it was screened at the Pacific Film Archive in Berkeley, California, where Assayas spent a week in residence introducing and discussing his films with the audiences there. He was accompanied by his friend Jean-Michel Frodon, the current director of the journal Cahiers du cin√©ma, of which Assayas was once the director. Assayas said the film is autobiographical, reflecting upon his own teenage years. He went out of his way to cast actors who were not professionals or who, as in the case of male lead Cyprien Fouquet (playing Gilles), had never acted before, although female lead Virginie Ledoyen (playing Christine) had appeared in several films. The film was the result of a commission from French TV, which wanted a 52-minute film but allowed Assayas to make a longer version, after some negotiations. Plot Gilles and Christine are teenagers from unstable homes. When they do some shop-lifting together she is arrested, but he gets away. She escapes from a mental institution and meets him at an abandoned house in the country, where a large group of rebellious teenagers are having a wild, all-night party. American rock music from the period is played prominently and has a very strong effect, especially \\"Me and Bobby McGee,\\" sung by Janis Joplin. Drugs are used, mainly pot and hash. As the party is winding down, Gilles and Christine escape even deeper into the countryside, searching for a commune where artists are said to live without electricity or running water. This is Christine's idea, but Gilles reluctantly goes along. A jolting conclusion shows us that, as Assayas puts it, \\"Gilles' real life has now begun.\\" Cast *Virginie Ledoyen - Christine *Cyprien Fouquet - Gilles *L√°szl√≥ Szab√≥ - Gilles's father *Jean- Pierre Darroussin - Inspector *Jackie Berroyer - Christine's father *Dominique Faysse - Christine's mother *Sma√Øl Mekki - Mourad *Jean-Christophe Bouvet - Professor *Ilona Gy√∂ri - Marie *Ren√©e Amzallag - The nurse *J√©r√¥me Simonin - Vendeur de dynamite *Laetitia Lemerle - Corrine *Alexandra Yonnet - Copine blouson *Caroline Doron - Copine bless√©e *Laetitia Giraud - Christiane References External links  *Cold Water: Dancing on the Ruins an essay by Girish Shambu at the Criterion Collection Category:1994 films Category:French films Category:French-language films Category:1994 drama films Category:Films directed by Olivier Assayas Category:Films with screenplays by Olivier Assayas Category:French drama films ","title":"Cold Water (film)"},{"id":"13633291","text":"Reverend William Frederick Archdall Ellison FRAS (28 April 1864 ‚Äì 31 December 1936) was an Irish clergyman, Hebrew scholar, organist, avid amateur telescope maker, and, from 1918 to 1936, director of Armagh Observatory in Armagh, Northern Ireland. He was the father of Mervyn A. Ellison, the senior professor of the School of Cosmic Physics at Dunsink Observatory from 1958 to 1963. Biography Ellison came from a clerical family, his father Humphrey Eakins Ellison having been Dean of Ferns, County Wexford. He gained a sizarship of classics at Trinity College, Dublin in 1883, became a Scholar of the House in 1886 and graduated in 1887 with junior moderatorships in classics and experimental science. In 1890 he took Holy Orders and moved to England, where he became the Curate of Tudhoe and Monkwearmouth. In 1894 he took his MA and BD degrees and in the following year won the Elrington Theological Prize. In 1899 he returned to Ireland to become secretary of the Sunday School Society, a post which he held for three years before accepting the incumbency of Monart, Enniscorthy, moving in 1908 to become Rector of Fethard-on-Sea with Tintern in Wexford. Ellison had developed an interest in astronomy, having been introduced to practical optics by Dr N. Alcock of Dublin and set up his first observatory at Wexford. He became highly adept at making lenses and mirrors and wrote several books and articles on the subject, including major contributions to the Amateur Telescope Making series, the Journal of the British Astronomical Association, and the weekly newspaper The English Mechanic. His book The Amateur's Telescope (1920) is still considered a standard for telescope-makers and a forerunner of the more extensive series on the same topic by Albert Graham Ingalls. On 2 September 1918 Ellison was appointed Director of the Armagh Observatory. He found the Observatory in a state of disrepair and set about repairing the instruments and the observatory dome. On 3 January 1919 he deeded a telescope of his own to the observatory, an 18 inch reflecting telescope, which is still there. Ellison was a highly regarded planetary and binary star observer. Working with his son Mervyn, he made many measurements of binary stars using the observatory's 10-inch Grubb refractor telescope and even discovered a new one close to Beta Lyrae, and according to Patrick Moore, was one of the few people to have observed an eclipse of Saturn's moon Iapetus by Saturn's outermost (A) ring on 28 February 1919. In 1934 Ellison became Canon and Prebendary of Ballymore, Armagh Cathedral. He died on 31 December 1936, having held the office of Director of the observatory for nearly twenty years.

Biography Born to a textile worker and a housewife in Atlanta, Georgia, Hay attended elementary and high school in Dacula, Georgia, prior to moving to Athens to attend college. Hay graduated from the University of Georgia art school in 1978. She became the singer for Pylon after being auditioned by Michael Lachowski, Randy Bewley, and Curtis Crowe. A few months later Pylon were the opening band for the British group the Gang of Four in New York City, at the club Hurrah, after being brought to the club's attention by Kate Pierson and Fred Schneider of the B-52's. Danny Beard, from Atlanta helped Pylon to record their first single \\"Cool/Dub\\" in 1979 at Stone Mountain Studios in Atlanta, and Pylon began to tour the US. The album Gyrate followed and was released in late 1980. Early career highlights included a performance at Central Park opening for the B-52's, a tour of the UK, opening a few dates for U2 on their first major US tour and the release of the album Chomp. Pylon decided to quit while they were still having fun. They broke up for the first time in 1983 after playing a \\"final\\" show, which was taped for The Athens Show. This was never formally released. In 1986, Hay was filmed for the movie Athens, GA: Inside Out and spoke about her experiences with Pylon. She and Bob Hay were married in 1986. In 1987 they had their first daughter. In 1989, Pylon reformed. Career highlights the second time around included tours with both R.E.M. and the B-52's, performances at SXSW and CMJ. Hits, a compilation of their early material was reissued by DB Records in 1989. Pylon recorded their third album Chain for the Atlanta label Sky Records in 1991. Pylon broke up a second time in 1992.They played several more shows including the South by Southwest Festival in 1990 and 1991, but when guitarist Bewley decided to leave in 1991, the band broke up again. Vanessa Hay became an RN in 1994. In 1993, she and Bob Hay had their second daughter. Randy Bewley approached the other band members about reforming Pylon, just for fun, in 2004. In August, 2004 Pylon played an unannounced show at Little Kings in Athens, Georgia. In 2005, they played a series of dates in Athens and Atlanta, including Athfest and at the Atlanta Heroes awards by the invitation of the B-52's. Jason Gross, Perfect Sound Forever encouraged them to look into reissuing their first album, Gyrate, on CD. Jeff Calder (The Swimming Pool Q's) restored the tapes at Southern Tracks Studios in Atlanta and Rodney Mills remastered them at Rodney Mills Masterhouse in Duluth, Georgia. DFA records in New York approached Pylon about reissuing this material, unaware that Pylon were already working toward this. James Murphy of LCD Soundsystem (band), had been including Pylon's song \\"Danger\\" in his DJ sets for several years and was interested in re‚Äîissuing Pylon's first album Gyrate on his label DFA. Gyrate Plus was reissued on October 16, 2007. A remastered Chomp More was reissued on October 20, 2009. Hay was also a member of the recording project Supercluster (band) who record and sometimes perform in Athens, Georgia along with Jason NeSmith. Other members of this project included Hannah M. Jones, Kay Stanton, Bob Hay, Bill David, John Fernandes, Heather McIntosh, Bryan Poole and Randy Bewley (deceased). Waves, their full-length project, was released on October 6, 2009. A 7-inch vinyl single \\"Gravity / Altitude\\" by Pylon was issued in April 2016 by Chunklet as a part of the Pylon Live project. A double vinyl album was issued on July 25, 2016. This music was recorded at the first final performance on December 1, 1983 at the Mad Hatter in Athens, GA. Vanessa performed with Pylon Reenactment Society at both release events along with Swimming Pool Q's and members of Love Tractor. Since 2014, Hay has fronted the Pylon Reenactment Society, a Pylon tribute act featuring members of more recent Athens bands like the Glands and Casper & the Cookies. In a 2016 Portland Mercury interview, Hays said, \\"It's been inspirational, if that's the right word, to be able to play this music again. I really don't want people to forget Pylon. These are different people and we are re-enacting this experience, so it's not exactly Pylon, but it's fresh and done in the same spirit\\". In October 2017, Pylon Reenactment Society self-released an EP initially recorded on December 11,2016 for broadcast in Los Angeles, California for DJ Michael Stock's KXLU show \\"Part Time Punks,\\" called \\"Part Time Punks Session.\\" In March 2018, Hay was named one of the ‚Äú25 Best Frontwomen of All Time‚Äù by Paste Magazine Discography =Pylon= * Cool/Dub 7\\" single (Caution Records 1980) * Gyrate LP (DB Records, Armageddon 1980) * Pylon !!

Construction Ordered from AG Vulcan on 22 April 1914 as part of the 1914 construction programme of high-seas torpedo-boats (with a half-flotilla of 6 ordered from Germaniawerft and a second half-flotilla from Vulcan), she was launched from AG Vulcan's Stettin, (now Szczecin in Poland) on 23 December 1914 and commissioned on 31 October 1915. The \\"V\\" in V46 denoted the shipbuilder who constructed her. V46 was long overall and at the waterline, with a beam of and a draught of . Displacement was normal and deep load. Three oil-fired water-tube boilers fed steam to 2 sets of AEG-Vulcan steam turbines rated at , driving two propeller shafts via F√∂ttinger hydraulic couplings giving a speed of . of fuel oil was carried, giving a range of at and at . Armament originally consisted of three 8.8 cm SK L/45 naval guns in single mounts, together with six 50 cm (19.7 in) torpedo tubes with two fixed single tubes forward and 2 twin mounts aft. Up to 24 mines could be carried. The ship had a complement of 87 officers and men. Service V46 was assigned to the Sixth Torpedo Boat Flotilla, Twelfth Half-Flotilla, of the High Seas Fleet of the Imperial German Navy when she participated in the Battle of Jutland. The 12th Half Flotilla attempted a torpedo attack against the battlecruisers of the British 3rd Battlecruiser Squadron at about 19:00 CET (i.e. 18:00 GMT), but while fired two torpedoes and and both fired a single torpedo, V46 did not fire any torpedoes in this engagement, as she was avoiding two torpedoes from the British destroyer and one from S50 which was running in circles. None of the torpedoes from this attack, or one immediately afterwards from the 9th Flotilla, hit their targets. Later that evening, the 12th Half Flotilla was sent to the rear of the retiring German fleet, in order to carry out night torpedo attacks on the British fleet. They were fired on by the 2nd Light Cruiser Squadron at about 21:52 CET and turned away, with S50 being damaged by a British shell. V46 and V69 later returned to their search for the British battleships, but although they spotted flashes of the night battles, they encountered no British ships. In January 1917, the 6th Flotilla was transferred to Flanders to reinforce the German torpedo boat forces based in the Belgian ports. The Flotilla set out from Helgoland for Flanders on 22 January, but decoding of German radio signals by Room 40 warned the British of the German intentions, and the Harwich Force of cruisers and destroyers sent to intercept the German torpedo boats. During the night of 22‚Äì23 January, the 6th Flotilla encountered three British light cruisers (, and ). In a confused engagement, V69 was hit by a shell and collided with , with both badly damaged, although both survived the encounter, while S50 lost contact with the remainder of the flotilla and, after an encounter with a separate group of British destroyers in which was sunk, returned to Germany. The remaining eight ships of the flotilla reached Zeebrugge unharmed on 23 January. On the night of 25/26 February, the Flanders-based torpedo boats launched a three-pronged attack against Allied shipping in the English Channel and the Dover Barrage. Six ships of the 6th Flotilla, including V46 were to attack the Dover Barrage, while other torpedo boats were to attack shipping on The Downs and off the mouth of the River Maas. The 6th Flotilla ran into the British destroyer which was patrolling the Barrage. While the German ships attacked Laverock with heavy gunfire and torpedoes (one of which hit the British destroyer but failed to explode), the British destroyer only received light damage, and the 6th Flotilla turned back for Zeebrugge, with the drifters of the Dover Barrage unharmed. The Flanders-based flotillas attacked again on the night of 17/18 March. Seven torpedo boats of the 6th Flotilla (, , , , , V45 and V46) were to attack the Dover Barrage north of the Sandettie Bank, with five torpedo boats of the 1st Zeebrugge Half-Flotilla attacking south of the Sandettie Bank, and four ships of the 2nd Zeebrugge Half-Flotilla operating against the Downs. The 6th Flotilla met the British destroyer on crossing the Dover Barrage. Paragon challenged the German torpedo boats, which replied with gunfire and torpedoes, Paragon being struck by torpedoes from S49 and G46 and sunk. The 12th Half- Flotilla (including V46) became separated from the rest of the 6th Flotilla and therefore returned to base, while the remaining three ships of the flotilla continued on, torpedoing and badly damaging the destroyer before returning to base, while a merchant ship was sunk by the 2nd Zeebrugge Half- Flotilla east of the Downs. The 6th Flotilla returned to Germany on 29 March 1917. In October 1917, Germany launched Operation Albion, an invasion of islands in the West Estonian archipelago to secure the left flank of the German Army following the German capture of Riga. The Germans assembled a powerful naval force to support the operation, reinforced by forces detached from the High Seas Fleet, including the 6th Torpedo Boat Flotilla. V46 carried out operations in Tagga Bay in support of Operation Albion on 14 October. After the end of hostilities, V46 was interned at Scapa Flow. Attempts to scuttle her with the rest of the German fleet were unsuccessful. She was transferred to France in 1920 and scrapped in 1924.

He was rewarded with greater lands around Karatsu, forming a dominion of 123,000 koku. In 1598, he abandoned his original castle of Nagoya Castle, and started work on a new castle at Karatsu, using many materials from the old one, from 1602-1608. The Tokugawa shogunate ordered neighboring tozama domains to contribute to its construction, and they did so primarily by excavating its network of moats. In 1637, in part due to his failure, to suppress the Shimabara rebellion, his lands were confiscated by the Shogunate. He was responsible for part of the overtaxation and mismanagement of local government which instigated the Shimabara Rebellion shortly after his death.

Originated by Patsy Pease in July 1984, she is most recognizable for the role. Her initial run lasted until March 1990, but she returned from twice from 1991 to 1992, with Anne Marie Howard portraying Kim in the interims. Ariana Chase played the role from December 1992 to June 1993 . Pease returned to the role in 1994, and continued to make appearances until 2016. Casey Wallace played Kimberly in flashback sequences in 1992. Creation =Casting= Patsy Pease originated the role of Shawn and Caroline Brady's eldest daughter on July 24, 1984, remaining until her first departure on March 12, 1990, when Anne Marie Howard stepped in temporarily from March 13 to August 13, 1990, and again briefly from July 17 to August 14, 1991. Pease returned for a couple stints from December 21, 1991 to January 22, 1992, and July 14 to December 22, 1992, until Ariana Chase took over full-time from December 29, 1992, to June 25, 1993. Pease again returned to the role of Kim (and has remained the character's only portrayer since) with stints lasting from June 28 to July 4, 1994, November 1 to 15, 1996, April 16 to 30, 1997, October 28, 1997, to September 23, 1998, May 30 to June 3, 2002, November 20, 2003, to January 16, 2004, February 27 and 28, 2008, June 24 to July 5, 2010, November 18 to 20, 2013, December 2014, and May 22 to 29, 2015. Casey Wallace appeared as the character for newly created flashbacks in 1992. =Storylines= The second-born child of Shawn and Caroline Brady, Kimberly returned to Salem in 1984 after leaving five years earlier for reasons that were unclear to the rest of the Brady clan. It was revealed that Kim had been working in Europe as a high class prostitute and sometimes photographer after fleeing Salem to escape years of sexual abuse by her uncle, Eric (Shawn's brother). Shane Donovan was assigned by the ISA to spy on Kimberly as she had incidentally taken photographs of Stefano DiMera's secret island in the Caribbean. Shane invited Kim to go to England to Donovan Manor where they declared their love for one another, during which time, Kim began to experience attacks of temporary blindness. While in England, they were shocked to find Shane's supposedly dead wife, Emma, alive. She had been brainwashed by the Dragon to kill Bo and Hope. Return to Salem alone to get on with her life, Kimberly soon goes blind. Shane and Emma arrive in Salem, and Shane is shocked to learn Kim is blind. He once again declares his love for her, but Kim backs away from the now-married Shane. Victor Kiriakis befriends Kimberly, though Caroline does not approve as she is afraid that Victor has ulterior motives. Kimberly receives news from Neil Curtis that the disease that caused her blindness is in remission. Still being blind however, Neil explains the cause is now emotional. Devastating Kimberly, Victor uses this to his advantage, inviting Kim to live with him which greatly angers Shane, as he is now investigating Victor for the ISA. Once Kim regains her eyesight, she realises Victor is heavily involved in crime and agrees to help Shane bring him down, resuming their relationship. In 1985, Kimberly came into possession of a roll of film that contained some prints to the location of a treasure that Victor, and Stefano Dimera were after, which again would come into play years down the road. In Miami Bo, Hope, Kim, and Shane were all out to destroy Victor's plan. Shane had been imprisoned by Victor, but Kimberly slept with Victor in order to spare Shane's life. Shane escaped, and managed to free Bo and Hope who were trapped with an explosive that was meant to kill them. Later Victor Kiriakis, Savannah Wilder, and Steve Johnson were arrested for their crime. They were all freed when Victor blackmailed Larry Welch into taking the fall for everything. Victor knew Larry killed Megan and used it against him. In 1986 Kimberly hid the fact that she thought her child was Victor's. It was also at this time that Kim discovered that her mother Caroline Brady had an affair with Victor years earlier and thought that Victor may be her biological father. However it was later revealed that Bo was Victor's son. One day Shane heard Kimberly talking about her fears and quickly broke off their engagement. Later when tests were done to determine the father, Emma Donovan Marshall switched the results, so everyone believed that Victor was the father. During a trip to West Virginia, in hopes of reuniting, Kimberly went into labor in a remote cabin in the woods. Shane delivered the baby, and he pledged his love for Kimberly and the child. They planned to marry even though they believed Victor was Andrew's father. The news infuriated Emma, who tricked Kimberly into signing adoption papers.

For a beam with an applied weight w(x) , taking downward to be positive, the internal shear force is given by taking the negative integral of the weight: : V(x) = -\\\\int w(x)\\\\, dx The internal moment M(x) is the integral of the internal shear: : M(x) = \\\\int V(x)\\\\, dx = -\\\\int \\\\left[\\\\int w(x)\\\\, dx \\\\right] dx The angle of rotation from the horizontal, \\\\theta, is the integral of the internal moment divided by the product of the Young's modulus and the area moment of inertia: : \\\\theta (x) = \\\\frac{1}{EI} \\\\int M(x)\\\\, dx Integrating the angle of rotation obtains the vertical displacement u : : u (x) = \\\\int \\\\theta (x)\\\\, dx Integrating Each time an integration is carried out, a constant of integration needs to be obtained. These constants are determined by using either the forces at supports, or at free ends. : For internal shear and moment, the constants can be found by analyzing the beam's free body diagram. : For rotation and displacement, the constants are found using conditions dependent on the type of supports. For a cantilever beam, the fixed support has zero rotation and zero displacement. For a beam supported by a pin and roller, both the supports have zero displacement. Sample calculations kN per meter load over a 15m length. Take the beam shown at right supported by a fixed pin at the left and a roller at the right. There are no applied moments, the weight is a constant 10 kN, and - due to symmetry - each support applies a 75 kN vertical force to the beam. Taking x as the distance from the pin, : w(x)= 10~\\\\textrm{kN}/\\\\textrm{m} Integrating, : V(x)= -\\\\int w(x)\\\\, dx=-10x+C_1 (\\\\textrm{kN}) where C_1 represents the applied loads. For these calculations, the only load having an effect on the beam is the 75 kN load applied by the pin, applied at x=0, giving : V(x)=-10x+75 (\\\\textrm{kN}) Integrating the internal shear, : M(x)= \\\\int V(x)\\\\, dx=-5x^2 + 75x (\\\\textrm{kN} \\\\cdot \\\\textrm{m}) where, because there is no applied moment, C_2 =0. Assuming an EI value of 1 kN\\\\cdotm\\\\cdotm (for simplicity, real EI values for structural members such as steel are normally greater by powers of ten) : \\\\theta (x)= \\\\int \\\\frac{M(x)}{EI}\\\\, dx= -\\\\frac{5}{3} x^3 + \\\\frac{75}{2} x^2 + C_3(\\\\textrm{m}/\\\\textrm{m})* and : u (x) = \\\\int \\\\theta (x)\\\\, dx = -\\\\frac{5}{12} x^4 + \\\\frac{75}{6} x^3 + C_3 x + C_4 (\\\\textrm{m}) Because of the vertical supports at each end of the beam, the displacement ( u) at x = 0 and x = 15m is zero. Substituting (x = 0, ŒΩ(0) = 0) and (x = 15m, ŒΩ(15m) = 0), we can solve for constants C_3=-1406.25 and C_4=0, yielding : \\\\theta (x)= \\\\int \\\\frac{M(x)}{EI}\\\\, dx= -\\\\frac{5}{3} x^3 + \\\\frac{75}{2} x^2 -1406.25(\\\\textrm{m}/\\\\textrm{m}) and : u (x) = \\\\int \\\\theta (x)\\\\, dx = -\\\\frac{5}{12} x^4 + \\\\frac{75}{6} x^3 -1406.25x (\\\\textrm{m}) For the given EI value, the maximum displacement, at x=7.5m, is approximately 500 times the length of the beam. For a more realistic situation, such as a uniform load of 1 kN and an EI value of 5,000 kN¬∑m¬≤, the displacement would be approximately 1 cm. *Note that for the rotation \\\\theta the units are meters divided by meters (or any other units of length which reduce to unity).

It features the rebel priest John Ball, who was accused of being a Lollard. He is famed for his question \\"When Adam delved and Eve span, who was then the gentleman?\\"Froissart, although unsympathetic to the rebels, gives a detailed, albeit imaginary (see Dobson, R.B. The Peasants' Revolt of 1381, (Macmillan, 2nd ed, p. 369)), account of Ball's preaching. * Et, se venons tout d'un p√®re et d'une mere, Adam et Eve, en quoi poent il dire ne monstrer que il sont mieux signeur que nous, fors parce que il nous font gaaignier et labourer ce que il despendent? Il sont vestu de velours et de camocas four√©s de vair et de gris, et nous sommes vesti de povres draps. Il ont les vins, les espisses et les bons pains, et nous avons le soille, le retrait et le paille, et buvons l'aige. Ils ont le sejour et les biaux manoirs, et nous avons le paine et le travail, et le pleue et le vent as camps, et faut que de nous viengne et de nostre labeur ce dont il tiennent les estas. ** If we all spring from a single father and mother, Adam and Eve, how can they claim or prove that they are lords more than us, except by making us produce and grow the wealth which they spend? They are clad in velvet and camlet lined with squirrel and ermine, while we go dressed in coarse cloth. They have the wines, the spices and the good bread: we have the rye, the husks and the straw, and we drink water. They have shelter and ease in their fine manors, and we have hardship and toil, the wind and the rain in the fields. And from us must come, from our labour, the things which keep them in luxury Book 2, p. 212. Froissart. q:Jean Froissart  Depiction of the Middle Ages  Morris draws on Froissart for information on the fourteenth century, but has a different attitude towards the revolting peasants from the chronicler who, Sir Walter Scott once remarked, had \\"marvelous little sympathy\\" for the \\"villain churls.\\"Claverhouse, in Walter Scott's Old Mortality (1816), ch. 35. Morris was also aware of interpretations of the Peasants' Revolt as representing a socialist tradition. In 1884 he had written an article in which he stated that \\"we need make no mistake about the cause for which Wat Tyler and his worthier associate John Ball fell; they were fighting against the fleecing then in fashion, viz.; serfdom or villeinage, which was already beginning to wane before the advance of the industrial gilds.\\" The novel describes a dream and time travel encounter between the medieval and modern worlds, thus contrasting the ethics of medieval and contemporary culture. A time-traveller tells Ball of the decline of feudalism and the rise of the Industrial Revolution. Ball realizes that in the nineteenth century his hopes for an egalitarian society have yet to be fulfilled. When Ball asks why his dreams of an egalitarian society have not come to pass, the narrator replies, \\"Now I tell thee that in the days to come poor men shall be able to become lords and masters and do-nothings; and oft will it be seen that they shall do so; and it shall be even for that cause that their eyes shall be blinded to the robbing of themselves by others, because they shall hope in their souls that they may each live to rob others: and this shall be the very safeguard of all rule and law in those days.‚Äù A parallel can be drawn with the novel's close contemporary‚ÄîA Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court (1889) by Mark Twain. Unlike Twain's novel, which depicted early-Medieval England as a violent and chaotic Dark Age, Morris depicts the Middle Ages in a positive light, seeing it as a golden, if brief, period when peasants were prosperous and happy and guilds protected workers from exploitation. This positive portrayal of the Medieval period is a recurring theme in Morris' literary and artistic oeuvre, from the largely pastoral and craftsman based economies of the prose romances, to his similar dream vision of Britain's utopian future, News from Nowhere (1889).Bull, M (2005) Thinking Medieval: An Introduction to the Study of the Middle Ages London:Palgrave Publication history The story was originally published in serial format in the socialist weekly The Commonweal, November 13, 1886 - January 22, 1887.

He was Consul in 251 BC and 247 BC, Pontifex Maximus in 243 BC and Dictator in 224 BC. He defeated the Carthaginian general Hasdrubal at the celebrated Battle of Panormus, a turning point of the First Punic War which led to Roman domination of Sicily. In that battle, after which he received the Honours of the Triumph, he defeated thirteen enemy generals and captured one hundred and twenty elephants, some of which he exhibited to the Roman people. In this battle, so decisive for Rome, the Carthaginian advantage was subdued by luring the enemy to terrain where staked ditches had been dug. This, coupled with the element of surprise and a quick counter-attack, allowed the Roman infantry to rout the attacking Carthaginians. While Metellus was Pontifex Maximus, a fire destroyed the Temple of Vesta and threatened to destroy the Palladium and other sacred objects. Lucius Caecilius Metellus, without hesitating, threw himself amidst the flames and reappeared with the tutelary symbol of the first Rome. However, his eyes were badly injured by the intense heat and he went blind, for which the Senate granted him the privilege of going by chariot to the Curia. In memory of that noble achievement of their ancestor, the Caecilii started to mint the image of Pallas on their consular coins.

In the 1960s, he helped organize faculty at a number of New York City-area colleges and universities into labor unions. He co-founded the Professional Staff Congress, a union of faculty at the City University of New York (CUNY) which now represents more than 20,000 faculty and staff members at the university. Early life Kugler was born on June 13, 1917, to Philip and Anna (Senitzer) Kugler. He and his sister were raised in a liberal Jewish home in Brooklyn, New York City, New York. He graduated with a bachelor's degree from City College in 1938.Hevesi, \\"Israel Kugler, Union Official Who Led Strike at St. John‚Äôs, Dies at 90,\\" New York Times, October 8, 2007. He took an active interest in socialist and Jewish politics, often spending entire days in \\"the counterpart of a floating crap game‚Äîonly our dice were political arguments on all issues affecting the world.\\"Quoted in Sorin, Irving Howe: A Life of Passionate Dissent, 2005, p. 18. He served in the United States Navy during World War II and returned to school to earn a doctorate in sociology at New York University.Dunbar, A Brother Like Me: A Memoir, 1995. Kugler married the former Helen Barkan in 1941. They had two children, Daniel and Philip.Phil Kugler is, as of 2007, the long-time director of organizing and field services at the American Federation of Teachers. Union career Kugler became a professor of social science at New York City Community College, where he earned a reputation as a skilled classroom educator. He also became heavily involved in labor politics in the city, and supported organizing drives for many unions. Kugler joined the United Federation of College Teachers (UFCT), Local 1460 of the American Federation of Teachers (AFT). Kugler eventually was elected president of the union, which had been founded in 1935.Wagner, \\"Local 1460,\\" Higher Education Quarterly, December 1964. Kugler was a leader among a group of AFT delegates who sought to force the national union to end its practice of chartering segregated locals. The union had amended its constitution in 1953 to bar segregated locals, but had done little to enforce the provision. In 1954, Kugler and others demanded that the union suspend the charters of locals that barred black teachers from membership. Although a resolution passed, president Carl J. Megel and other national union officers argued that the resolution and constitution provision did not \\"require\\" suspension. The following year, Kugler led the anti-segregation forces in yet another resolution battle, which led to passage of a policy which unequivocably required ejection of locals which discriminated on the basis of race. A number of locals in the Deep South withdrew from the union rather than be suspended, including Local 89 in Atlanta (the first AFT local where 100 percent of the teachers in the bargaining unit had joined the local). In all, the AFT lost close to 5 percent of its membership.Eaton, The American Federation of Teachers, 1916-1961: A History of the Movement, 1975; Currivan, \\"Teachers Clash on Bias in Union,\\" New York Times, August 21, 1954; Currivan, \\"A.F.L. Teachers Ban Racial Curbs,\\" August 20, 1955. =St. John's University strike= Kugler led a strike at St. John's University in 1966, which led to the establishment of the AFT as a leader in the unionization of faculty and staff in higher education. In the fall of 1965, 31 faculty members at St. John's University were dismissed without due process or any hearing. Both the American Association of University Professors (AAUP) and the UFCT claimed the university had violated the professors' academic freedom. St. John's, the two groups said, demanded that the faculty restrict their teaching to a narrow, dogmatic approach to Thomism and required faculty to submit all articles and books to the administration for clearance before seeking publication. The Rev. Joseph T. Cahill, president of St. John's, said the teachers had used their classrooms for propaganda purposes.\\"Strife at St. John's,\\" Time, December 31, 1965.Currivan, \\"St. John's Hints Faculty Conduct Led to Ousters,\\" New York Times, December 23, 1965. Kugler pushed for a more radical response to the dispute, calling for a strike to begin in January 1966 and widening the dispute to include pay and benefits (faculty pay was the lowest of the ten largest Catholic universities in the U.S.) The strike at St. John's began on January 4, 1966. The union pushed for mediation and arbitration in December 1965, but the university refused to submit to either. Using tactics pioneered by Albert Shanker to win collective bargaining rights for New York City public school teachers, Kugler pushed for local and state government officials to get involved in the dispute. Only a minority of St. John's faculty walked out, forcing the university to close some but not a majority of classes. During the next two years, Kugler challenged the university's accreditation before the Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools twice. But that body only warned the university and took no further action. The union raised $250,000 from the Workmen's Circle and other organizations to support the striking faculty. Kugler took professors' case to the Vatican and sought an individual audience with Pope Paul VI, whose encyclicals on workers' rights were repeatedly cited by the union. But the pope refused him an audience.\\"Featherman File,\\" The Forward, March 27, 1998. In the early spring of 1967, as the strike threatened to widen to other Catholic universities in the country and state legislators opened hearings on the labor dispute, the university agreed to arbitration. The strike ended in June 1967. The union did not win recognition at St. John's, and in 1970 arbitrators ruled that the university had not acted improperly.Currivan, \\"St. John's Strike on Jan. 3 Called By Teacher Union,\\" New York Times, December 18, 1965; Currivan, \\"St. John's Gets Mediation Offer,\\" New York Times, December 24, 1965; Currivan, \\"St. John's Bars Mediation By City,\\" New York Times, December 28, 1965; Grutzner, \\"Mayor Offers Aid on St. Johns,\\" New York Times, January 4, 1966; Currivan, \\"St. John's Opens Despite Its Strike,\\" New York Times, January 5, 1966; Currivan, \\"St. John's Warns 25 Absentees to Return to Job or Face Action,\\" New York Times, January 6, 1966; Dallos, \\"St. John's Calls Boycott Failure,\\" New York Times, January 11, 1966; Gansberg, \\"St. John's Strike Closes Classes, But 2 Sides Disagree on Number,\\" New York Times, February 15, 1966; Dallos, \\"St. John's to Keep Its Accreditation But Gets Warning,\\" New York Times, May 1, 1966; Kaplan, \\"Faculty Strikers Suing St. John's,\\" New York Times, June 2, 1966; Dallos, \\"Teachers Protest at St. John's Commencement,\\" New York Times, June 13, 1966; Currivan, \\"St. John's Reopening Today With Faculty Strikers Resuming Picket Line,\\" New York Times, September 19, 1966; Currivan, \\"St. John's Warned Its Accreditation May Be Revoked,\\" New York Times, December 2, 1966; \\"New Impasse Stalls Plans to Arbitrate St. John's Dispute,\\" New York Times, April 6, 1967; Morris, \\"Catholic U.

Kugler later wrote a well-regarded article about the strike, \\"The 1966 Strike at St. John's University: A Memoir,\\" which was published in Labor's Heritage in 1997. =Formation of the PSC= Although the strike was a failure in that it did not win reinstatement for the faculty, the strike established the AFT as the pre-eminent union organizing American higher education faculty. Kugler quickly turned the UFCT's attention to other colleges and universities in the New York City area. In the next few years, under his leadership the union organized locals at the Fashion Institute of Technology (FIT), Nassau Community College and Westchester Community College. In 1967, faculty at FIT bargained a signed collective bargaining agreement‚Äîthe first time a public higher education union in the state signed a contract. FIT's contract was only the second public higher education contract in the whole country.Polishook, \\"Collective Bargaining and the City University of New York,\\" Journal of Higher Education, May 1970. In 1967, Kugler began pushing for the UFCT to organize the faculty at CUNY. Backed by the AFT and the newly formed (and politically powerful) United Federation of Teachers, UFCT not only won an agreement for a union election but won the December 6, 1968, election in the face of a determined challenge from the AAUP. The union won a second election (this time for non-tenured faculty) nine days later, and a signed contract nine months later.Farber, \\"City U.

CUNY promptly attempted to break the contract by firing 100 untenured faculty members in December 1969. Kugler responded with aggressive picketing which forced the university to rescind its actions.Handler, \\"100 of Staff Ousted In Pact Violation, City U. Union Says,\\" New York Times, December 27, 1969; *Handler, \\"Union to Picket City U. Branches Over Dismissal of Lecturers,\\" New York Times, May 12, 1970. In 1972, Kugler merged the UFCT with its long-time rival, the Legislative Conference of the City University. Kugler and Dr. Belle Zeller, president of the Legislative Conference, agreed to form a new organization affiliated with the AFT, the Professional Staff Congress (PSC). CUNY challenged the right of the PSC to represent its faculty, forcing the PSC into yet another election. The PSC won this second election on June 7, 1972. After a year of negotiations and a threatened strike, CUNY consented to a three-year collective bargaining agreement.Buder, \\"Faculty Members at City University Pick Single Bargaining Agent,\\" New York Times, June 8, 1972; Peterson, \\"City U. Proposes 1-Year Pact,\\" New York Times, June 1, 1973; \\"Staff Unit Votes to Strike City U,\\" New York Times, July 8, 1973. As of 2007, the PSC represented more than 20,000 faculty and staff members at CUNY. Kugler was elected Deputy Vice President of the PSC after its formation, but retired in the late 1970s.

History Deportivo de la Sala Calvet was founded in 1906. The club's first ever president was Luis Cornide. Records indicate that the team consisted of Salvador Foj√≥n, Venancio Deus, Juan Long, √Ångel Rodr√≠guez, Manuel √Ålvarez, Daniel Aler, Paco Mart√≠nez, F√©lix de Paz, Virgilio Rodr√≠guez, Juan Manuel L√≥pez, and Mart√≠nez Urioste. On 11 May 1907, civil governor Luis Moyano passed the proper statute and regulations on the formation of the club. One and a half years later, King Alfonso XIII of Spain conceded the mark of royalty to the club while he also accepted the role of honorary president of the now called Real Club Deportivo de La Coru√±a. At the same time, Deportivo's first home pitch at Corral√≥n de la Gaiteira would become obsolete, and they moved to a stadium now called Viejo Riazor. =The first decades= Because of the success of the Spain national team at the 1920 Antwerp Summer Olympics, football exploded throughout Spain. This eventually led to the establishment of a national tournament which would end the regional championships. This form had existed throughout the country's numerous provinces. With football becoming part of the city, Deportivo began to take part in many friendly exhibitions within and out of Galicia until 1928, when the \\"Liga\\" was born. However, Depor failed to qualify for the Primera Divisi√≥n season 1928/1929. Instead they started playing in the Segunda Divisi√≥n, where they eventually finished eighth in a division consisting of ten clubs. The other nine were Alav√©s, Sevilla, Celta, Valencia, Betis, Iberia, Oviedo, Gij√≥n, and R√°cing de Madrid. In 1932, while still playing in the second division, Deportivo managed to eliminate Real Madrid from the Copa del Rey tournament. This was a big achievement because the club from the capital became Liga champions that season. For Deportivo this was only a hint of better things to come. =1941-1945: First period in the Primera Divisi√≥n= In a year when the Second World War was going on in the rest of Europe and the world, and Francisco Franco was dictator in Spain, Deportivo finally managed to achieve promotion to the Primera Divisi√≥n for the first time in its history. It took place after the season 1940/1941 when Murcia was defeated 2‚Äì1 in a match for promotion. The legendary Deportivo team of that day consisted of Acu√±a, Novo, Pedrito, Muntan√©, Molaza, Reboredo, Breijo, Guimerans, El√≠cegui, Chacho, and Chao. They were led by coach Hilario Marrero and each player earned 2,000 pesetas (not even ‚Ç¨20) each for this achievement. This amount even had to be collected through public donations or other subscriptions because of the weak economic state of the club at that time. The team finished fourth in the first year at the highest level (1941/1942), and there was a decision to build a new home. 1944 was the year of the inauguration of the new Riazor, but the team encountered problems playing football at the highest level. This led to the first ever relegation from the Primera Divisi√≥n in 1945. =1950: Close to first title= The team went up, down, and up again until they reached their best achievement in the first 44 years of existence: second place in the season 1949/1950. Back then Chaver G√≥mez was president of the club and Scopelli was coach. Deportivo lost the Spanish title to Atl√©tico de Madrid after the Galicians only were able to take one point from Athletic Bilbao in the San Mam√©s Stadium on the final day of the season. In those years the club was expanding to an \\"overseas\\" level as the team incorporated two Argentine players: Corcuera and Oswaldo. They would become part of an attacking line consisting of them and Franco, Moll, and Tino; four South American players and one \\"Coru√±√©s\\" and they became known as the Orquesta Canaro. This attacking force achieved that Deportivo started their \\"Golden Decade\\" and stayed in the highest division until 1957. For the club this was an exceptional period and legendary personnel such as Argentine coach Helenio Herrera, Pah√≠√±o, and Spain's future European Footballer of the Year, Luis Su√°rez, featured at the club in this lustrous decade. =1962-1973: Ups and downs= Ups and Downs. Hopes and disillusionment. After their \\"Golden Decade\\" the club came into an uncertain period, this despite the presence of some great players. From the world-renowned forward line Orquesta Canaro to the quick fleeing stay of Luis Su√°rez, Amancio, Reija, Veloso, and Jaime Blanco. All of whom were products of Deportivo's rich youth system at that time. But the poor financial health of the club had as its consequence that they couldn't keep these jewels and most of them left to economically more powerful clubs. It caused the notorious period of \\"ups and downs\\" for the Galician club as they experienced relegation in 1963, 1965, 1967, 1970 and 1973. It was a time of being too good for the lower leagues but not capable of surviving in the Primera Divisi√≥n. It was a good time though compared to what came after it. =1973-1991: Troubles in the lower leagues= Deportivo encountered the most problematic years of its existence after the relegation in 1973. The club found itself trapped between the Segunda B Divisi√≥n and even the Tercera Divisi√≥n and the relegation from the highest level left a tremendous mark on the social and sporting reputation of the club. This was stressed even more due to the constant rise in debt of the already economically troubled club. Not even Luis Su√°rez, as coach of Deportivo during the season 1978/1979, could turn the tide. The 1980s were a prolongation of the uncertainties and despair within La Coru√±a, and the everlasting obsession of returning to the Primera Divisi√≥n grew each year. But after one disappointment after the other, the frustration grew as Deportivo saw themselves locked in the Segunda Divisi√≥n. They were even close to dropping one level when in May, 1988 a goal of Vicente in extra time in the last match of the season against Racing de Santander saved Deportivo from yet another step backwards and a possible end of the club, because of the economic difficulties. It had been a narrow escape, but Deportivo had just survived... It was worth the pain and waiting as slowly the succession of dreadful events came to a halt. The administration of the club was completely restructured with the objective of healing it economically while finding a sense of sportive stability. In 1988, a historic assembly took place at the Colegio de Los Salesianos, where Augusto C√©sar Lendoiro was elected president of the club. Fans, players and the directing staff all came together to place Deportivo back to where it belonged: A club for all coru√±eses. But the situation of the club was not very encouraging back then. The debt had grown until 600 million pesetas (about ‚Ç¨4 million) while the social \\"implantation\\" of the club was very weak. Simply put: there was no proper future installed nor prepared for the sportive aspect of the club. The number one priority of the directors was to remove the debts and to find economical assurance. There was a popular theme to this called \\"walk or explode\\", which later would be referred to as a \\"miracle\\" once the club was able to support itself again. The season 1988/1989, the first under Lendoiro, began with local coach Arsenio Iglesias on the bench and with practically the same squad which barely had escaped relegation during the previous season. But the team, with the addition of Brazilian Raudnei, managed to complete a great Copa del Rey campaign yet once again failed to gain promotion to the Primera Divisi√≥n. Nevertheless, for the first time in many years the club was able to deal with its financial difficulties and actually to reach a surplus in their balance. With few new signings, and still wary of any possible monetary dangers to the club, the 1989/1990 season was somewhat of a turning point. The team was more motivated than ever and with the debut of players like Martin Lasarte and Sab√≠n Bilbao, and with the eastern-bloc players Sredojevic, Batrovic and Stojanov, the Galician club managed to reach a preliminary two-leg encounter with Tenerife for a place at the highest level. But despite a draw in the first leg on the Canary Islands, the fans of Deportivo faced another disappointment as in the return leg in Riazor the island club obtained the ticket to the Primera Divisi√≥n. However, Deportivo president Lendoiro insisted that with everyone's support the club would finally ascend to the highest level. The financial management was in safe hands, a surplus in gains still existed and the amount of club members (socios) continued to grow to 17,500. This was how the season 1990/1991 was approached. Josu, Alb√≠stegui, Stojadinovic, Kanatlarovski, M√∫jika, Villa, Albis, Uralde and later Djukic were some of the names added to the squad and the target was clear: reaching the Primera Divisi√≥n. Once again the dying seconds of the season would decide the fate of Deportivo. But after having missed 18 years of football in the Primera Divisi√≥n, Deportivo defeated Murcia in play-off matches and finally achieved promotion. All of La Coru√±a and Galicia were soaked in joy and the blanquiazul world would then start to move beyond its borders, as fans all across the nation were to join the Deportivo cause. =1991-1993: The Birth of 'Superdepor'= Arsenio Iglesias was the S√∫per D√©por coach. 1991/1992: Survival at the final moment The 1991/1992 season is often considered as one of transition. A mix of veterans and younger players with the likes of Claudio, Ribera, L√≥pez-Rekarte, Canales, Lia√±o, Kirov and Kiriakov formed the team guided by coach Marco Antonio Boronat, and Deportivo looked on their way to safety after an impressive 5‚Äì2 win in March, 1992 against Sporting de Gij√≥n with three goals by Uralde. However, after a disappointing 2‚Äì2 home draw in April against Burgos after leading 2‚Äì0 at Riazor, relegation had come so close that Boronat was replaced by Arsenio Iglesias. In the end Deportivo were one point short of reaching a safe place and finishing as number seventeen in the Liga caused going through play-off matches for the third time in a row. In 1990 the club had missed promotion in these matches but in 1991 they finally achieved it. In 1992 the status of Primera Divisi√≥n team was secured against Betis and this was celebrated by the fans of Deportivo as if the team had won the Liga. The lineup most frequently used during that campaign was: Lia√±o - Sabin Bilbao, Alb√≠stegui, Djukic, Lasarte, L√≥pez-Rekarte/Mariano Hoyas - Fran, Kanatlarovski, Kiriakov, Jos√© Ram√≥n - Claudio. 1992/1993: Deportivo surprise Spain Javier Manjar√≠n. When the 1992/1993 season started, Deportivo had become an Anonymous Society (S.A.D.). This is a common factor for clubs in Spain, as each club is their own independent institution. Fans and shareholders got to own a part of the club and have their own say. This was truly a showing of the message: \\"a club for all coru√±eses\\". The consolidation of the team had as its consequence new important signings, as 1992 was the year when internationally recognized figures were introduced to Deportivo. Brazilian internationals Mauro Silva (24) and Bebeto (28) were the first to arrive. They were joined by Spanish players Aldana, Juanito, Nando, Jos√© Ram√≥n and Serna. Lendoiro and his staff made it clear: Avoiding relegation was not the objective anymore. Deportivo were after more. About 30,000 fans showed up at Riazor to witness the presentation for the new season, a campaign that would become historic. The foundations of SuperDepor were put in place and the echoes of \\"Madrid, Barcelona, here we are!\\" (words spoken by president Lendoiro after the promotion in 1991) were shouted by all deportivistas. The team won its first five matches, including a sensational 3‚Äì2 win against Real Madrid after trailing 0‚Äì2. Bebeto scored two goals in this match and continued scoring all season long. He finished the season with 29 goals scored, becoming the 1992-93 Pichichi Trophy winner. The season 1993/1994 will for always be underlined in the history of the club. Not only for the first ever presence in a European tournament, but also for the dramatic loss of the Liga during the final seconds of the season. The squad was reinforced with well recognized footballers like Donato, Manjar√≠n, Paco, Elduayen, Voro, Pedro Riesco and Alfredo and everybody was just hoping that the previous campaign would be continued. This happened because early December the team conquered the first place in the Liga, had beaten Real Madrid 4‚Äì0, and were playing the third round of the UEFA Cup against Eintracht Frankfurt. The Germans proved to be too strong though after Deportivo had beaten Danish club Aalborg and taken their first scalp of a reputated club by eliminating Aston Villa F.C.. With Arsenio Iglesias still at the helm, the team now had the chance to focus on the Liga. And from 4 December on the team stayed on top of the Primera Divisi√≥n. The goals of Bebeto and Claudio that season brought Deportivo to the final matchday as a serious title contender. A win at home against Valencia would have been enough, no matter what rivals Barcelona would do. At half-time the score in Riazor was still 0-0 but Sevilla were leading 1‚Äì2 in Barcelona. The season would finish dramatically though as with twenty minutes to go, Barcelona striker Romario shot his club in front and now Deportivo were obliged to win themselves. In injury-time the team were rewarded a penalty-kick after defender Nando had been fouled. As Bebeto had missed one in the previous weeks and Donato had been taken off, defender Djukic stepped forward but missed the opportunity. Barcelona snatched the title away from Deportivo based on a superior goal average as both clubs were drawn on points. Lia√±o won his second Trofeo Zamora that campaign as he only leaked 18 goals during the season. There were no serious rivals for him because the defences of Barcelona, Sevilla and Racing were closest with 42 goals. In fact, the seriousness of Deportivo at the back had been an important factor in their conquest with players like Nando, Djukic, Ribera, Voro and L√≥pez-Rekarte. In 27 of the 38 Liga matches that campaign a clean sheet was held including the final six. The players most frequently used that campaign were: Lia√±o - Nando, Voro, Djukic, Ribera, L√≥pez-Rekarte - Fran, Mauro Silva, Donato - Bebeto, Claudio =1994/1995: First ever trophy= The campaign after it, 1994/1995, would in fact become known for its consistency. In December 1994 the team occupied the second place in the Liga and only lost their first match on day eleven. In the UEFA Cup the team had kicked out Rosenborg (Norway) and Tirol Innsbruk (Austria) and now had to challenge Borussia Dortmund. A 1‚Äì0 home win, thanks to a Bebeto goal, was not enough though as a dramatic extra-time in Germany indicated the end of Deportivo in the tournament. For the second time in a row the team could focus on the domestic competitions, including the Copa del Rey. But in March 1995 the team dropped down to fourth position in the Liga after a 0‚Äì1 home loss against Atl√©tico de Madrid. Still, the team bounced back and stayed unbeaten in the next nine matches and approached leaders Real Madrid when the match between both teams arrived in the Bernab√©u. Deportivo did well and a goal of Bebeto caused a 1‚Äì1 score near the end, but a final strike of Zamorano was enough to give the home team the title. Deportivo achieved an honourable end to the season by scoring 13 goals in the final two matches (including a 2‚Äì8 win at Albacete) and finishing second. For the third time in their history the club qualified for European football and the Galicians had finished among the best three for a third consecutive time. But it was time for a prize. The team had been close to winning two Ligas, and did well in Europe, but finally were crowned on 27 June 1995. It was the final of the Copa del Rey, which had to be postponed three days earlier because of heavy rain. On that day Manjar√≠n had given Deportivo a 0‚Äì1 lead while Mijatovic had equalized the match. Seconds after the restart it was Alfredo who scored the 2-1 for Deportivo and the team hung on to this lead to win their first ever trophy. The players most frequently used that campaign were: Lia√±o - Nando, Ribera, Djukic, Voro, L√≥pez-Rekarte - Fran, Donato, Aldana - Manjar√≠n, Bebeto 1995-1998: More difficult times The team had given coach Arsenio Iglesias a fine goodbye from Riazor when on 10 June 1995 it scored five goals against Logro√±√©s (5-0). O zorro de Arteixo (‚ÄúThe Fox from Arteixo‚Äù) left the club of his life, after giving them their first ever trophy in 19, and was replaced by Welshman John Benjamin Toshack. The expectations were now higher than ever because the club had been performing well for three Liga campaigns in a row, won a Copa del Rey and played six rounds of UEFA Cup football. A very experienced Deportivo squad, with most players around their thirties, had to finish the job. =1995‚Äì1996= Deportivo were among the title favourites because of playmaker Fran, World Champions Mauro Silva and Bebeto, Zamora-winning goalkeeper Lia√±o, talented Manjar√≠n and Paco, veterans Djukic and Donato at the back and World Cup participant Voro accompanying them in the Galician squad. Besides, new coach John Toshack had won a Copa with Real Sociedad, the Liga with Real Madrid and was known for his capability to do most with limited means. Winning the Teresa Herrera tournament that summer of 1995, after the last victory had been in 1969, also indicated that the club had grown. The qualities of the squad were immediately shown when in August 1995 the team won the Supercopa 1995 5‚Äì1 on aggregate against Real Madrid. The second prize won was a fact. The 3‚Äì0 home win in Riazor against the giants was marvelous, but winning 1‚Äì2 in Madrid didn't completely satisfy Toshack. He made a remarkable comment by saying that ‚Äúmy players should feel ashamed about this title because of the way we played here‚Äù. A difficult relationship with the club and its players was born. But the season 1995‚Äì1996 did not go as expected. Veterans like Beguiristain (31), a personal addition by Toshack but criticized by the supporters, and Mart√≠n-V√°zquez (29) were added to the squad while two youngsters were signed in Radchenko (24) and Milovanovic (22). Deportivo confirmed their status as title favorites by winning 3‚Äì0 against Valencia in the first match of the season. But then things became more complicated. The team suffered a humiliating defeat at Compostela (4-0), later at home against Racing de Santander (2-3) and away to Real Sociedad (2-1) and Atl√©tico de Madrid (1-0). These three defeats in a row was the worst series of the club for many years. In October 1995 the team were 12th in the domestic league but still showed glimpses of their class: in the Cup Winners‚Äô Cup, Apoel Nicosia was crushed 8‚Äì0 in Riazor with three goals by Bebeto. And the Brazilian magician incredibly scored all five goals in the home win against Albacete (5-0). But it was exactly Bebeto who wasn't amused when Toshack took him off during a hard-fought victory against Sporting Gij√≥n (1-0). Bebeto insulted Toshack's mother, and another row was born. Later Bebeto threatened by leaving Deportivo if he was substituted again. The atmosphere didn't change much when Deportivo stumbled towards December. A match in Bilbao was lost 1‚Äì0 in the final minutes and Deportivo hadn't scored a Liga goal for more than 4.5 matches. Toshack said that ‚Äúmy squad is quite old and needs to be changed a lot to be able to think about the future‚Äù. The only positive aspect of these weeks was the 4‚Äì0 on aggregate elimination of Trabzonspor in the Cup Winners‚Äô Cup. Neither did much change during the remainder of the season. On occasions, the team was inspired, like surrounding the change of year when three matches were won in a row: 6‚Äì0 at Rayo Vallecano, followed by a 3‚Äì0 home win against Real Madrid (all goals scored by Bebeto) and a 2‚Äì0 victory at Real Oviedo. Deportivo climbed five positions in the table. In January for the first time in many years a point was taken away from Barcelona (1-1) and another remarkable away win was achieved, this time at Salamanca (5-0). According to Toshack, ‚ÄúDeportivo have been the best Spanish team in January. Some may have equaled us, but certainly haven‚Äôt done better‚Äù. But that month also saw the exit of the Copa del Rey-holders at Tenerife and giving away a 0‚Äì1 lead at Valencia (2-1 loss). Deportivo finished the month as eighth in Spain. In February, Toshack's team only took two points out of a possible twelve and were tenth at the end of March 1996. What sparkled some light on that campaign were the performances in Europe as in March 1996 Spanish neighbours, and winners of the year before, Zaragoza were kicked out by Deportivo. Youngster David Fern√°ndez gave the Galicians a 1‚Äì0 home win while a goal of Bebeto in the away match proved to be enough to secure the pass (1-1). That month, Toshack accused his squad of having ‚Äúa lack of ambition, not being hungry enough. This team lacks some bastards‚Äù. In April, a late and undeserved home defeat against Paris-Saint Germain (0-1) spoiled the European campaign and the team couldn't fix it in Paris (1-0 defeat). The team wasn't prepared yet for European success. But three wins and one draw in the Liga that April seemed to save Depor's season. Since the home win against Albacete, on 1 October 1995, the best qualification would be a sixth place on 29 April 1996. It wasn't to be though, because the Galicians only took one point out of the final twelve and suffered a terrible 0‚Äì4 home defeat against Real Oviedo. The crowd was fed up with Toshack. ‚ÄúDepor s√≠, Toshack no‚Äù was heard in Riazor. Half a year later, Toshack said about this season's squad that ‚Äúit was the worst group of players I‚Äôve seen in 20 years. I couldn‚Äôt identify myself with the identity of those people. They were settled, burned out and there wasn‚Äôt a future nor youth. I needed all my 18 years of experience as a coach to survive‚Äù. The players most frequently used that campaign were: Lia√±o - Nando/Villarroya, Paco, Djukic, Voro, L√≥pez-Rekarte - Fran, Donato, Aldana/Alfredo - Manjar√≠n, Bebeto =1996/1997: Rivaldo's year= Rivaldo. The performances of the campaign before indicated that the season 1996/1997 would be decisive for the way Deportivo would go. Striker Bebeto (32) announced in 1996 that his time at Deportivo was over and he returned to Brazil after four impressive seasons at the Galician club. As the end of the generation was near of the players who had brought Deportivo to the top of Spain, there were doubts what the near future would bring. Good news came from a 7-year television contract which Deportivo signed with Canal+ and earned the club around ‚Ç¨135 million. The new age of financing a club through television, merchandising and other publicity acts was beginning to make a serious mark on Deportivo too. Many Spanish clubs signed lucrative deals and some began to call the Primera Divisi√≥n the Liga de las Estrellas because the arrival of players like Ronaldo (FC Barcelona) and Roberto Carlos (Real Madrid). Deportivo president Lendoiro had understood well from the last campaign that the squad needed changes. And during the summer of 1996, Toshack got the squad change he wished. Deportivo invested wisely in players like Songo'o, Kouba, Naybet, Armando, Bonnissel, Martins and Madar while veterans like Aldana, Lia√±o, Bebeto, L√≥pez-Rekarte and Villarroya left the club. The fact that Deportivo were growing, also financially, resulted in the biggest signing ever the club made that summer by acquiring Brazilian midfielder Rivaldo (24). He was supposed to replace star player Bebeto and cost the club about ‚Ç¨7,4 million. So, Deportivo had bought their first ‚Äòstar‚Äô and this had a big influence on its confidence. But had the relationship between Toshack and his squad never been a good one, his partnership with president Lendoiro got more difficult and the Riazor crowd never were very fond of the Welsh coach. When the club decided that the 1996 pre-season would be held outside of La Coru√±a, Toshack said that ‚Äúinstead of signing players for so much money, Lendoiro should have constructed training facilities‚Äù. Without having qualified for European football, all eyes were set on the Liga where Deportivo would have their best start of a season ever. At the end of the year 1996, Deportivo were still unbeaten and, together with FC Barcelona, at just two points of leaders Real Madrid. Only during the first three matchdays were situated out of the first five. The new defence was like in old times and only leaked eight goals in seventeen matches, while playmakers Martins (six goals) and Rivaldo (seven goals) made the difference. Not that the team was playing spectacular football. It was effective. Seven victories were obtained with one goal difference and seven matches were drawn. Toshack received a financial punishment by the Spanish FA for remarks he made about the referee of the match against Real Madrid. The Welsh coach also criticized his own club in an interview with Don Bal√≥n. He called Deportivo ‚Äúa club without a solid base, something like a castle in the air. To reach the level of the big clubs, there‚Äôs still a mountain of work to do. Deportivo is under construction and it‚Äôs important that this is made clear‚Äù. At the end of the year, Toshack had a row with midfielder Mart√≠n-V√°zquez after he took the player off minutes after bringing him on at Sevilla. About Depor's supporters, Toshack said: ‚ÄúThey always seem to have devaluated my work. But now things are changing, thanks to our good Liga position‚Äù. Deportivo had been unbeaten for seventeen consecutive Liga matches, a record by far in its history. The expectations were high when on 4 January 1997 FC Barcelona visited Riazor. In the weeks before, Lendoiro took the total investment for that season to ‚Ç¨31 million by signing goalkeeper Nuno, Benfica's H√©lder, midfielder Fl√°vio Concei√ß√£o (by beating Real Madrid on the transfer market) and striker Renaldo. But the magic had disappeared. Pizzi's late goal earned Barcelona three points (0-1) and on the day after Toshack announced that, at the end of the season, he wouldn't continue at Deportivo. This declaration might have been influenced by some paintings which were visible at the stadium, like ‚ÄúToshack Go Home‚Äù and ‚ÄúToshack, bastard‚Äù. That month Deportivo threw away their title chances by taking just three points out of a possible fifteen. A Copa exit against Sevilla was avoided on penalties. The match at Real Madrid could have been a turn-around with Deportivo leading twice, but losing in the end (3-2). Depor's Copa exit at Espanyol and the 2‚Äì2 home draw against arch-rivals Celta were too much. The gap with Real Madrid had grown to fifteen points in less than two months and the Galicians were threatened by Real Sociedad and Atl√©tico de Madrid for the European places. Toshack himself was openly flirting with Newcastle United. With the results not covering him anymore, his bad relationship with the squad (Fl√°vio Concei√ß√£o also had a row with him) and his almost catastrophic cooperation with Lendoiro, Toshack resigned. His relationship with the Riazor crowd was terrible. Two weeks after he had announced his departure, he had infuriated them during the home match against Bilbao. When Martins scored Depor's second goal (2-1) just before the break, he turned towards the crowd and shouted: ‚ÄúNow you will be applauding, hijos de puta‚Ä¶‚Äù. But that wasn't all, as Naybet made an obscene gesture and Rivaldo looked like wanting to throw his shirt at him. After the Copa match against Sevilla there was another such an incident. Earlier, Toshack was asked if there was a divorce between him and the crowd. ‚ÄúA divorce? To be divorced one first has to be married. And that never existed between me and the crowd. For a part of them, I‚Äôm responsible for all. But a moment arrives when I consider it to be enough‚Äù. Assistant coach Jos√© Manuel Corral was in charge when the team drew 0‚Äì0 against Atl√©tico and didn't win for a seventh consecutive time. This match was the only one of Deportivo since its promotion to the Primera Divisi√≥n in 1991 that was played outside of Riazor, but in Santiago de Compostela. After an earlier home draw with Tenerife (0-0, with Madar receiving a red card), referee Jap√≥n Sevilla was hit with a coin coming from the Riazor crowd. The Comit√© de Competici√≥n of the Spanish FA (RFEF) punished Deportivo with the closure of Riazor for one match, which was confirmed by the Comit√© de Apelaci√≥n of the RFEF and the Comit√© Espa√±ol de Disciplina Deportiva of the Consejo Superior de Deportes. But Deportivo didn't accept and went to ordinary justice: the Tribunal Superior de Justicia de Madrid. This is against FIFA rules and the club was threatened with punishment (like suspension from international football) if it would continue. In the end, Deportivo retreated. After the departure of Toshack, the arrival of Brazilian coach Carlos Alberto Silva brought new life into the team and Deportivo stayed unbeaten for eighth matches including six consecutive victories. It were the months of Rivaldo as he scored 12 goals between 19 February 1997 and 3 May 1997. These goals were not enough though to put Deportivo back into the fight for the title because too much points had been wasted in the previous months while Real Madrid and Barcelona didn't fail. The team experienced a low in their performances when it won just one out of the final six matches, just enough to secure the third place. But the good thing was that it earned them a ticket for the next UEFA Cup tournament and restored some pride in the team. Rivaldo had scored 21 goals that campaign while another new signing, Songo'o, won the Trofeo Zamora. The players most frequently used that campaign were: Songo'o - Nando, Djukic/H√©lder, Naybet, Armando - Rivaldo, Mauro Silva, Martins, Donato - Manjar√≠n, Renaldo =1997/1998: Disastrous season despite investments= So Deportivo signed players like Rivaldo and Fl√°vio Concei√ß√£o, and the experiences had been excellent. This caused the club to spend about ‚Ç¨14 million for the season 1997/1998> on two new Brazilian players: Djalminha (26) and Luiz√£o (21). Other new signings were Moroccan striker Bassir, Spanish defender Ramis and Nigerian goalkeeper Rufai. Now the team could line-up an impressive line consisting of Mauro Silva, Fl√°vio Concei√ß√£o, Rivaldo, Djalminha and Luiz√£o and other teams noticed it too. The Galicians impressed during the pre-season and after the fine previous campaign once again started to look like serious title contenders. What nobody expected though was that Barcelona reached deep in their pockets to take away star player Rivaldo from them. Hours before the transfer dead-line would pass, Barcelona paid the buy- out clause of more than ‚Ç¨25 million and snatched away the most important player of the team. Together with the departure of Miroslav Djukic, who had been the defensive chief for seven years, the team missed vital players and never proved to be in balance. Added to this fact that the squad became called the \\"United Nations\\" because it would include 15 foreign players that campaign. All combined this didn't work out. On 15 October 1997 the home match against Valladolid was lost (1-3) while two weeks earlier Auxerre had proved to be too strong in the first round of the UEFA Cup tournament. Coach Silva was sacked and once again Jos√© Manuel Corral took over. This didn't help much as the team experienced the Liga like a wounded boxer and never passed place number eleven. In fact, after a 1‚Äì0 defeat at Valencia the relegation places came dangerously close and Lendoiro decided to act. He signed two strikers from South-America in Abreu and 'Manteca' Mart√≠nez as these two men should lift Deportivo in the standings. Abreu scored the winning goal on his debut against Sporting de Gij√≥n (2-1) and scored a total of three goals in three weeks. After winning 3‚Äì1 against Barcelona and a 0‚Äì1 win at Racing de Santander the team had climbed six places in the table. But that proved to be it for this campaign as Abreu appeared to be lacking discipline while 'Manteca' Mart√≠nez didn't score a single goal. The team moved between places eleven and fourteen, suffered an embarrassing 2‚Äì6 home defeat against neighbours Compostela, and eventually finished on position number twelve. Djalminha had been doing fine that season although the rest of the squad couldn't keep up. Winning the Trofeo Zamora was out of the question as the team even scored less (44 goals) than it had leaked (46 goals). In fact, the team suffered a helpless exit from the Copa del Rey tournament against Segunda Divisi√≥n club Alav√©s and were lucky to escape more relegation problems. But despite these problems Deportivo remained strong on the financial front. The players most frequently used that campaign were: Songo'o - Bonnissel, Naybet, Paco, Armando - Fran, Fl√°vio Concei√ßao, Mauro Silva, Hadji, Djalminha - Bassir/Abreu 1998-2000: Irureta builds Liga winning team After having played two disappointing seasons out of the last three, president Lendoiro was looking for the final piece of the puzzle. The Riazor stadium had experienced new improvements and the squad consisted of quality players like Martins, Fl√°vio Concei√ß√£o, Djalminha, Donato, Fran, Mauro Silva and Naybet. Nevertheless, the disappointing performances proved that something was wrong and Lendoiro looked to neighbours Celta de Vigo for a solution. Their coach, Javier Irureta, had achieved excellent performances with them and only near the end of the season dropped from the first three spots by finishing sixth. Lendoiro convinced Irureta of the possibilities at Deportivo and the Basque coach agreed to step in. A new era at the club was born. =1998/1999: New confidence= New signings were made for the season 1998/1999 in taking Romero, Manuel Pablo, Sch√ºrrer, Ziani, Pauleta and 'Turu' Flores and the team impressed during the Teresa Herrera tournament by defeating Atl√©tico de Madrid and Lazio Roma. But the new project needed time and fortunately Irureta was given it. Under severe criticism the team occupied Liga place number twelve after losing 1‚Äì2 at home against Racing de Santander on 10 January 1999 and were close to a Copa exit against Segunda Divisi√≥n club Sporting de Gij√≥n. But as Rivaldo had been the saviour two years earlier when the team struggled, now 'Turu' Flores appeared as the new star. The Argentine forward had produced just three Liga goals until Deportivo started an impressive series of matches. The team survived the Copa round against Sporting de Gij√≥n, kicked out favourites Celta (after an heroic display in Vigo (0-1) with a long list of injured players) and Mallorca from the tournament and in the Liga lost just one match out of the next eleven. There were wins against Real Madrid (4-0) and Celta de Vigo (2-1) and 'Turu' Flores produced 13 goals between 17 January 1999 and 25 April 1999. After a 1‚Äì2 win at Mallorca the team even occupied the third position in the Liga and looked to be heading towards Champions League qualification. But in the end Deportivo came two points short of finishing fourth and had to settle for position number six. Five days earlier it had let escape a perfect opportunity to play the Copa del Rey final, but Atl√©tico de Madrid proved to be too strong. Nevertheless, Deportivo were back in Europe and had found another quality striker in 'Turu' Flores. The players most frequently used that campaign were: Songo'o - Romero, Naybet, Sch√ºrrer, Armando - Fran, Fl√°vio Concei√ßao, Mauro Silva, Hadji, Djalminha - 'Turu' Flores = 1999/2000: Depor win Liga = Javier Irureta. Djalminha. Despite the good performances of the previous campaign, nobody at Deportivo would have experienced in a dream like the season 1999/2000 evolved. In 1998 the club had just avoided relegation and already were delighted with the sixth place one year later. Their biggest signing in the summer of 1999 proved to be Roy Makaay as Deportivo spent about ‚Ç¨8,6 million on him. Also C√©sar Mart√≠n, V√≠ctor S√°nchez and Jokanovic joined Deportivo that period. Together with experienced players like Songo‚Äôo, Naybet, Donato, Fran and Mauro Silva they would form a remarkable consistent team. The team started the season well with a 4‚Äì1 victory against Alav√©s, with a hat-trick of Makaay, but found themselves on place number seven after a disappointing home defeat against Numancia (0-2) on 26 September 1999. Four days later the team narrowly escaped a UEFA Cup exit against little Stabaek but then an excellent period arrived. The team won seven Liga matches in a row, among which against Barcelona (2-1), Atl√©tico de Madrid (1-3) and Celta de Vigo (1-0). On 21 November 1999 it earned them the first Liga spot after an impressive 5‚Äì2 home victory against Sevilla. Deportivo would stretch their lead to eighth points, survived a Copa round against M√°laga and eliminated Montpellier and Panathinaikos from the UEFA Cup tournament. Deportivo were back at the top. But it seemed the team couldn't handle the pressure really well as only one point was taken out of the next twelve including a dramatic 0‚Äì3 home defeat against Racing de Santander. The gap with Zaragoza was narrowed to just two points and favourites Barcelona were at four. Besides, the team suffered a Copa exit against Segunda Divisi√≥n club Osasuna Pamplona. Nevertheless, the next weeks would produce just enough points to secure the first position. There was a fantastic 5‚Äì2 home win against Real Madrid although Arsenal proved to be too strong in the UEFA Cup tournament. On matchday 29 the team suffered a 2‚Äì1 defeat in the Nou Camp and Barcelona were now at just two points. The victory of Deportivo at Sevilla (1-3) in the next away match might have been crucial as it prevented Barcelona from taking over the first spot. The final seven Liga matches were like a thriller. Every week there was the doubt whether the team could hung on to its small lead in the Liga. But 8 goals of Makaay in the final months brought his total to 22 Liga goals and were decisive for the title challenge. The team took just two points out of a possible nine before the final matchday of the season arrived. Espanyol were the opponent and this time Deportivo didn't let escape a golden opportunity to win the Liga title. During this match the team never bothered about the score in the Nou Camp and soon were 2-0 up against the smaller Catalan team thanks to goals of Donato and Makaay. Therefore, on 19 May 2000 the first Liga title was won in the 94-year history of the club. Deportivo also qualified, for the first time in its existence, for Champions League football. La Coru√±a exploded with joy and over 200,000 Galicians raced on to the streets. A massive celebration that lasted for infinite hours. The competition had been tight and fascinating this year, with Valencia and Real Madrid disputing an all-Spanish Champions League final, a modest Alav√©s becoming the revelation of the season and with the relegation of three giants: Sevilla, Atl√©tico de Madrid and Betis Sevilla. The players most frequently used that campaign were: Songo'o - Romero, Naybet, Donato, Manuel Pablo - Fran, Mauro Silva, Fl√°vio Concei√ßao, V√≠ctor S√°nchez, Djalminha - Makaay 2000-2004: 'Eurodepor' joins European 'Big Boys' Euro D√©por players like Scaloni, Djalminha, Manuel Pablo, Diego Trist√°n, Noureddine Naybet, Amavisca, Jorge Andrade and Albert Luque after a veterans match. The year 2000 resembled 1995 as in both years Deportivo won a trophy. Also, in both years the Supercopa was won as in 2000 Deportivo conquered it against Copa del Rey winners Espanyol. The Galicians could add a fourth trophy to its cabinet but were after more. There was movement in the squad because the departure of midfielder Fl√°vio Conceic√£o to Real Madrid (for more than ‚Ç¨26 million) and Pauleta (more than ‚Ç¨5 million) allowed the team to sign the Atl√©tico trio of Molina, Capdevila and Valer√≥n, midfielders Duscher, Emerson and C√©sar Sampaio and strikers Pandiani and Trist√°n. The fact that six of them still are in the Deportivo squad today indicate that the team did some good business that summer. President Lendoiro knew that for winning matches (and money) in the Champions League the team needed a quality boost. =2000/2001: Depor impress Europe= Winning the Teresa Herrera tournament in 1998 might have broken the curse that the team always plays awful seasons after winning it. But Deportivo beat Lazio during the final and started the season 2000/2001 exceptionally well. Until November 4, 2000 just one match was lost (3-0 at Real Madrid) and Deportivo took their first ever point in the Champions League (and their first goal scored by Naybet) by drawing 1‚Äì1 at Panathinaikos. This was followed by their first win against Hamburger SV (2-1) and an indication that the team was capable to get results at the highest level: a 0‚Äì0 draw in Delle Alpi against Juventus. The team encountered no problems surviving their first Champions League group and finished first while they achieved their first ever away win after an impressive 1‚Äì3 victory at Paris-Saint Germain in the second group phase. On 2 December 2000 the team also conquered the first Liga spot after beating Espanyol (0-2). But after it the first serious setbacks of the campaign arrived. Deportivo lost 0‚Äì1 at home against AC Milan, were kicked out of the Copa del Rey by Segunda Divisi√≥n club Tenerife and took just four out of a possible twelve Liga points. Fortunately things changed round again and on 27 February 2001 the team achieved a 2‚Äì3 in Nou Camp for the first time in its history while one week later it completely outplayed Real Madrid in Riazor. Deportivo wasted numerous chances to score in this match though while the visitors were presented a penalty gift by the referee, meaning the match only finished 2-2. It was a decisive blow for the Liga options of Deportivo as the team would stay at the second position until the end of the campaign. In Europe things had become complicated after a 1‚Äì0 loss at Galatasaray. It obliged Deportivo to win both their home matches against the Turkish team and Paris-Saint Germain, and the Galicians overcame their first hurdle by winning 2‚Äì0 against Galatasaray. But Paris-Saint Germain took a shocking 0‚Äì3 lead just after the break of their match until Deportivo started an amazing come-back. Substitute Pandiani scored three goals while Trist√°n added one, culminating in a sensational 4‚Äì3 victory. On 13 March 2001 the team finished off AC Milan in their own stadium through an amazing penalty kick of Djalminha. For the first time in its history Deportivo were among the final eighth in the most important European tournament. The Quarter Finals proved to be the end though of the fairy tale as a 2‚Äì0 home win against Leeds United wasn't enough to overcome the 3‚Äì0 defeat of the first leg. Nevertheless, Europe had become to know Deportivo and the team had given a good impression. The final matches of the season confirmed the second place of Deportivo in the Liga and made Diego Trist√°n scoring 19 Liga goals in his first season. The team had defended their title in the best possible way, with much dignity and resistance, and the future looked bright. The players most frequently used that campaign were: Molina - Romero, Naybet, Donato, Manuel Pablo - Fran, Mauro Silva, Emerson, V√≠ctor S√°nchez, Valer√≥n - Trist√°n/Makaay =2001/2002: Copa win at the Bernabeu= Diego Trist√°n scored a goal in Copa final. During the season 2001/2002 the team simply continued its impressive performances of the previous two campaigns. The squad had experienced radical changes during the previous summers and Spanish players started covering most places. In 2001 the only spectacular transfer was the one of midfielder Sergio who cost the club a small fortune (almost ‚Ç¨18 million). Other additions, like Djorovic, Amavisca and H√©ctor, only indicated that the squad already was competent enough to approach the new campaign. This season showed Europe that the previous European performances of the team weren't just lucky ones. On 25 September 2001 the team won their first ever match against a big European club as Manchester United were beaten 2‚Äì1 in Riazor thanks to late goals of Pandiani and Naybet. The participation of Deportivo in Europe had been in danger after the 0‚Äì1 score and the previous 2‚Äì2 home draw against Olympiakos Piraeus. On 17 October 2001 the team repeated its trick by winning 2‚Äì3 at Old Trafford thanks to two goals of Trist√°n and one from Sergio. It allowed the team during matchday five to qualify for the next round and to stay unbeaten in the tournament in the final match. In the Liga things went smooth too as Deportivo occupied the first position from 13 October 2001 until 1 December 2001. Deportivo would finish the year 2001 as Liga leaders after a 2‚Äì0 home win against Betis and added another English scalp to its total after beating Arsenal 2‚Äì0 in Riazor. However, a 3-0 beating at Bayer Leverkusen indicated that a pass from the second group was all but secured yet. As usual, the Liga performances at the start of the new year crumbled down and Deportivo even dropped to the seventh place after losing 3‚Äì0 at Valladolid. They again occupied this place on 16 February 2002 after losing 3‚Äì2 at Barcelona. But the thing this season was that the Liga was more equal than ever. After matchday 26 Liga leaders Valencia had 44 points while eighth placed Alav√©s had 39. In between were placed Real Madrid, Barcelona, Celta de Vigo, Betis Sevilla and Athl√©tic de Bilbao. Luckily, Deportivo regained their form and showed class against Italian Champions League participants Juventus. Molina saved the team from defeat in the group away match by stopping a penalty kick of Del Piero. But the Italians had no chance in Riazor and were beaten 2‚Äì0. Best day that season proved to be 6 March 2002. Without making much noise Deportivo had reached the final of the Copa del Rey tournament after beating clubs like Marino, Leonesa, Valladolid and Figueres. It earned them a place in the final against highly motivated Real Madrid, to be played on their exact 100th birthday in the Bernab√©u stadium. But despite all indicated to a Real Madrid home win, the Galicians stayed calm, took a shocking early lead through Sergio and added a second one just before the break thanks to Diego Trist√°n. The team could have finished it off in the second half but saw Real Madrid desperately fighting itself back into the match. In the end this didn't prove to be enough and Deportivo added their second Copa del Rey to its cabinet (1-2). Winning the cup tournament already made the season a successful one, but the team wanted more. Six days later Arsenal encountered Spanish fury in their own stadium and had absolutely no chance (0-2). It earned Deportivo much respect in Europe and qualification for the Quarter Finals for a second time in a row. But the Quarter Finals once again proved to be the end station. And for the second time it was an English club eliminating Deportivo. The team had no options at all during the Riazor encounter with Manchester United (0-2) and miracles stayed away in the return leg (3-2). It left the team frustrated because it was capable of doing more. The good thing was that all focus could be aimed at the Liga and the team approached the top match against Valencia on matchday 35 being placed just two points behind them and one after Real Madrid. The options were over though after a Duscher own goal gave the home team the advantage and the boost to win the Liga title. Fortunately, Deportivo secured the second Liga position on the final day of the season after a 3‚Äì0 win against Real Madrid. Diego Trist√°n finished as Pichichi of the Liga with 21 goals while Valer√≥n had found his place in the team. Once again the future looked bright. The players most frequently used that campaign were: Molina - Romero, Naybet, Donato/C√©sar Mart√≠n, Lionel Scaloni - Fran/Amavisca, Mauro Silva, Sergio, Valer√≥n, V√≠ctor S√°nchez - Trist√°n/Makaay =2002/2003: Makaay's final season= Roy Makaay. In 2002 the club made three big signings in getting Jorge Andrade (24), Albert Luque (24) and 'Toro' Acu√±a (30). It cost the club ‚Ç¨38 million, the sale of 'Turu' Flores and a loan out of Walter Pandiani to Mallorca but indicated that the club wanted to grow even more. And the fairy tale just continued during the season 2002/2003. A third Supercopa was added to the growing list of prizes after beating champions Valencia twice in August 2002 (3-0 and 0-1). Although the Liga started with a disappointing 2‚Äì4 home defeat against Betis Sevilla, and a serious injury of Jorge Andrade, soon another historic chapter would be written. It was on 18 September 2002 when a hat-trick of Roy Makaay earned Deportivo a 2‚Äì3 win at Bayern Munich. The first ever Spanish win in Munich and no European team had produced three goals in the Olympic stadium in the years before. But three days later influential midfielder Valer√≥n, who had been vital in the conquest of Munich, was seriously injured after a nasty challenge of Valladolid defender Pe√±a. Suddenly the team had lost its reference and wandered helplessly against Milan in Riazor (0-4). It would be a difficult period as Liga matches against Racing de Santander (0-2) and Villarreal (3-1) were lost while a 3‚Äì1 home win against Lens was equalized by the French club in their own stadium. Deportivo had dropped to ninth place in the domestic league but were relieved by two strikes of Makaay at Rayo Vallecano (1-2). The Dutch striker produced twelve goals including these in the first two months of the season and three days later added another one in a crucial match. On 29 October 2002 the team desperately needed a victory at home against Bayern Munich and achieved one thanks to a late goal of Makaay. Two weeks later a narrow 1‚Äì2 away win against already qualified AC Milan was enough to earn Deportivo another place in the second round of the Champions League. But it had been a narrow escape. The team was plagued with injuries and suspensions and Irureta never could use the players he wanted. On 7 December 2002 the team occupied a disappointing eighth position after a 1‚Äì1 draw at lowly Recreativo de Huelva. In the Liga this was to be the turning point, but in Europe things got very complicated. The team gave away a 2‚Äì0 home lead against Juventus (2-2) and were helpless at Manchester United (2-0 loss). Not until the end of February would there come an option to fix this, and until then the team could concentrate on the Liga and Copa. The next three Liga matches were won against M√°laga (1-0), Valencia (0-1) and Celta de Vigo (3-0) and it permitted the team to occupy the third position on 4 January 2003 at still seven points of surprising leaders Real Sociedad. When the next Champions League match against Basel arrived on 19 February, the team had taken ten out of a possible eighteen Liga points and survived Copa rounds against Alicante and Murcia. But Mallorca had beaten Deportivo 2‚Äì3 in Riazor in the Semifinal of this tournament while Basel added salt to their wounds by inflicting a shocking 1‚Äì0 defeat in Switzerland. Now Deportivo were wounded, but not dead. In Europe it revived by a narrow 1‚Äì0 home win against Basel although it couldn't hang on to a 1‚Äì2 lead at Juventus. The Italians scored a dramatic injury-time winner and it was the end of Deportivo in Europe. For the first time in three campaigns the team didn't survive the second group phase. But once again the team could aim its focus on the domestic Liga. Seven days before the European exit at Juventus the team was eliminated from the Copa del Rey tournament at Mallorca (1-1). But in the Liga the return of Valer√≥n and Molina, who had been out with cancer, provided a much needed boost. The team achieved seven wins in eight Liga matches, among which victories against Alav√©s (6-0), Real Sociedad (2-1) and Barcelona (2-4). The win against the Basque team lifted Deportivo to the second place at just three points of Liga leaders Real Madrid. Although the team was slaughtered 3‚Äì0 at Mallorca, victories against Recreativo (5-0, with the Liga debut of Dani Mallo) and M√°laga (0-2) gave the team the first Liga spot on 10 May 2003. Real Sociedad had equal points while Real Madrid followed at just one point. One will never know what happened then, but Deportivo failed to take this unique opportunity. It lost its next match at home to Valencia (1-2) while one week later neighbours Celta de Vigo inflicted final damage by winning (3-0). As had been the case during the whole of the season, the team proved to be too irregular in its performances. Losing 3‚Äì0, twice, in the final weeks of the Liga and being defeated at home is something that cannot be afforded. But it happened and in the end the team finished third, behind Real Sociedad and at six points of champions Real Madrid. A look back to this season reveals that, once again, Deportivo finished among the top clubs in Spain. Winning a tournament might be influenced by luck and specific moments, but over 38 matches it's time for regular performances. Since 2000 the team has finished among the first three clubs in Spain and in 2003 the third place was a good achievement after a difficult season. Roy Makaay was crowned European topscorer after having produced 29 Liga goals, 9 in the Champions League and 1 in the Copa del Rey. In August 2003 it earned him a much discussed ‚Ç¨19 million transfer to Bayern Munich. The fact that there had been so many injuries means it's not possible to indicate a team consisting of the most frequently used players. After the departure of topscorer Roy Makaay many assumed this was the beginning of the end for Deportivo, also because the summer of 2003 was the least active one considering new signings since the return to the Primera Divisi√≥n in 1991. The goalkeeping section was reinforced with the return of Jacques Songo'o and the ‚Ç¨2.5 million signing of Mun√∫a. But the only fieldplayer to arrive those months was Pedro Munitis, who came on a free transfer from Real Madrid. =2003/2004: Final four in Europe= Walter Pandiani. Besides, at the start of the season 2003/2004 Deportivo were obligated to play pre-round European matches for the first time in their history. And the club had to cope with a tough Champions League pre-round draw as Rosenborg were attached to the Galicians. And a tough task it became because after 180 minutes of football just one goal was scored between the two sides. Luckily it concerned Albert Luque's goal in Riazor (1-0) after a 0‚Äì0 draw in Norway. For the fifth time in a row Deportivo had qualified for the Champions League, a great achievement in Spanish (and European) football. But before the first European match was to be played there were three matches in the Primera Divisi√≥n. The start of the team was perfect as all of them were won, including two difficult away matches. The first match of the season was broken up near its end when Walter Pandiani scored the only goal at newly promoted Real Zaragoza (0-1). The midweek home match against Athl√©tic de Bilbao was a simple prey (2-0) and ten days later another important victory was achieved at Sevilla (1-2). So Deportivo had a perfect score after three matches and led the standings with two points over Real Madrid, Barcelona and Valencia. Besides, Walter Pandiani had scored three goals in three matches and promised to become important this season while the defence looked tight. The scoring drift of Pandiani, who had returned from a loan spell at Mallorca, was amazing as he scored eight matches in a row. After his three goals during the start of the Spanish season he earned Deportivo a point in Greece against AEK Athens (1-1) during the first match of the Champions League group. He scored another (from the spot) against PSV Eindhoven during a 2-0 European home victory and scored two more (against Albacete and Osasuna Pamplona). But while the home match against little Albacete didn't cause problems (3-0), Deportivo lost its first match of the season at Osasuna (3-2) after a 3‚Äì0 score. Valencia took over the lead in the Primera Divisi√≥n and the Galicians took a step back to earth. But October proved to be an excellent month as three out of four Liga matches were won, Deportivo survived in the Copa del Rey and achieved its second European victory. The Liga wins obtained in Riazor were against Atl√©tico de Madrid (5-1) and Valencia (2-1) while a serious team achieved a brilliant 0‚Äì2 victory at the Nou Camp. It was the third win of Deportivo in this stadium out of the last four encounters and the poor Catalans suffered. After the win against Valencia the Galicians led the Primera Divisi√≥n again and the team looked stable. A line-up filled with many reserves achieved a late Copa victory at regional rivals Compostela, but this match was overshadowed by the violent death of Deportivo supporter Manuel R√≠os Su√°rez. In Europe the team remained unbeaten as an important victory was achieved at home against AS Monaco (1-0). A goal of Diego Trist√°n was enough to give the Galicians seven points after three matches although this time luck was on Deportivo's side. The team suffered against the French side and were fortunate to keep the points at home, something which didn't happen against Mallorca on 29 October. Deportivo lost its first home match that season (0-2) and saw the gap being narrowed to just one point. November didn't prove to be as successful as October as the team lost its steam. The four Liga matches that month only delivered five points and Deportivo dropped to the third place behind Valencia and Real Madrid. There were 0-0 draws at Murcia and Betis Sevilla while the team even lost its home match against Villarreal (0-1). The only domestical highlight that month was a 2‚Äì1 victory against Real Sociedad after being 0-1 down. This match was played just three days after Deportivo suffered the worst humiliation in their history: an 8‚Äì3 defeat at AS Monaco. Despite a great goal of Diego Trist√°n, which even was crowned Eurosports's Goal of the Year, the team looked completely lost. During the break Molina was left behind sick in the dressing room and within minutes his replacement, Mun√∫a, leaked several goals. Fortunately this mistake was made up during the 3‚Äì0 home win against AEK Athens that same months. The end of 2004 saw Deportivo achieving 'normal' results. The best what happened that month was the qualification for the next round of the Champions League. The final match of the group was played at PSV Eindhoven and Deportivo looked out with the score being 2‚Äì0. But Albert Luque scored a vital goal after which the Dutch side needed to score at least two more. This task wasn't fulfilled and the match finished 3‚Äì2, enough to qualify on goaldifference. Deportivo also survived in another tournament as little Gimn√†stic de Tarragona were beaten 1‚Äì2. But the Liga title slipped away that month, also because some crucial decisions during the match at Real Madrid (2-1). A goal of Albert Luque was falsely cancelled because of offside while moments later Ronaldo scored 1-0 when clearly having advantage of an offside position. A brave Deportivo side kept on pressing and scored the equalizer through Pandiani, before Ra√∫l scored the winner near the end. In the other three matches that month the team stayed unbeaten (home wins against M√°laga and Espanyol and a 1‚Äì1 draw at Valladolid), meaning that Deportivo entered 2005 as third in the Liga and alive in Europe. Because the Champions League only was to restart at the end of February, the focus in the first weeks lay on the domestic competitions. Things went wrong in the Copa del Rey when Atl√©tico scored a crucial away goal in Riazor (1-1) after a goalless draw in Madrid. But the Liga brought a lot of good news as Deportivo took none less than eighteen points out of a possible twenty-four those weeks. The 0‚Äì5 win at Celta de Vigo, with a hat-trick of V√≠ctor S√°nchez, already has become a classical one while Real Zaragoza were slaughtered in Riazor (4-1). Valuable were the points taken at Albacete (0-2) and Atl√©tico de Madrid (0-0) while Deportivo secured six points in Riazor against Sevilla (1-0) and Osasuna (2-0). Only Racing de Santander (1-1) spoiled the party those weeks in La Coru√±a while the match at Athl√©tic de Bilbao was lost (1-0). In Europe the restart of Deportivo was magnificent as Juventus were completely outplayed in Riazor. But only Albert Luque found the net (1-0) and this promised the return to become tense. But before this match in Turin was played the team threw away its options in the Liga. First there was a 2‚Äì3 loss at home against Barcelona, after a 0‚Äì3 score, and one week later the defeat at Valencia was heavy but unnecessary (3-0). Fortunately the team survived in Europe as an early goal of Walter Pandiani gave Deportivo their first ever victory at Juventus (0-1). After the elimination of the losing finalist of 2003 the winner of that edition was drawn to the club: AC Milan. The focus on the European matches caused Deportivo to lose another domestic match, the second that season against Mallorca (4-2). With all eyes set on the visit to the San Siro the home match against Murcia was just narrowly won (1-0). But the focus seemed to pay off as the start against the Italians was magnificent thanks to an early goal of Walter Pandiani. However, surrounding the break the match was thrown away with four goals leaked in the space of barely ten minutes (4-1). But again Real Sociedad proved to be the ideal partner to recover as 1-2 was achieved in the Liga although one week later two points were wasted at home against Betis Sevilla (2-2). The match of 7 April 2004 against AC Milan will forever be written in the history books as Riazor almost exploded out of joy when the Italians were sent home with a 4‚Äì0 defeat. Pandiani, Valer√≥n and Albert Luque gave the Galicians three goals before the break they only could have dreamed of and substitute Fran finished the job. For the first time in the history of the Champions League a team bounced back from a three-goal difference in the first leg and Deportivo secured their first ever place in the Semifinals of the Champions League. However, those matches became a major deception for the team. On 21 April the match at FC Porto finished 0‚Äì0 with a ridiculous red card for ex-Porto defender Jorge Andrade. Two weeks later his replacement, C√©sar Mart√≠n, caused a penalty kick and that goal couldn't be matched by a helpless Deportivo (0-1). Mourinho's Porto went on to win the Champions League that year, and Deportivo only had the Liga left to end the season in a successful way. The only motivation remaining was to finish third as the fourth place was already assured. Deportivo had taken eight points out of a possible twelve in the weeks before the Porto match and eliminated Real Madrid from the title race after a 2‚Äì0 win in Riazor. But the European exit against Porto was difficult to handle and Deportivo threw away their match at Espanyol (2-0). Nevertheless, for the fifth season in a row the team finished among the first three in Spain after beating Celta (3-0) and Racing de Santander (0-1). The team finished six points behind champions Valencia but ended just one point away from Barcelona. However, Real Madrid dropped down to fourth place and overall the domestic campaign had been successful for the Galicians. Meanwhile, the European achievements had been incredible. The players most frequently used that campaign were: Molina - Capdevila, Naybet, Jorge Andrade, Manuel Pablo - Luque, Mauro Silva, Sergio, Valer√≥n, V√≠ctor S√°nchez - Trist√°n/Pandiani 2004 - 2006: Stepping out of the elite =2004/2005: Final season of Irureta, Fran and Mauro Silva= Depor's future looked promising when the summer of 2004 arrived. The European season had shown the team's enormous possibilities and Deportivo finished reasonably close to Liga champions Valencia. Despite the departure of Donato and Makaay one year earlier, the ageing of several squad players, and the financial difficulties, all surrounding Deportivo were hopeful. At the start of May coach Irureta and president Lendoiro agreed on another contract for the Basque coach. It would be his seventh season at the Galician club. Not many will have foreseen it would be his last. Every team needs refreshments now and then, even if the results are satisfying. Irureta knew that well and had been asking for them in 2003. And this time the situation was similar. But he didn't get any. At least not for immediate use. Promising Las Palmas stars Rub√©n and Momo arrived. But no one expected them to immediately occupy headlines at a team having reached the final four in Europe. Both players would be loaned out to Albacete and Irureta stayed empty handed. In fact, president Lendoiro kept on trying to make the club's situation more healthier by releasing several players. Legends like Naybet (after 8 seasons) and Djalminha (after 7 seasons) left the club. So did a well-earning defender like Djorovic. Other players finally saying goodbye to Deportivo were Songo‚Äôo, Jaime, Jos√© Manuel, Amavisca, Fernando, Iv√°n P√©rez and Abreu. New players did not arrive, despite a summer full of rumours about Maniche, D‚ÄôAlessandro, Caneira, Pablo Ib√°√±ez, Mascherano, Eto‚Äôo and Saviola. Deportivo started the pre-round Champions League matches early at Shelbourne (0-0) without new additions. Luque's appearance in this match ended speculations about his possible Barcelona move. But something definitely had changed. Looking back it was too difficult for the squad to be fully motivated. They knew a unique chance to write history had been lost because of the elimination by Porto months earlier. Combined with the absence of fresh blood and diminishing authority of Irureta, the season would become a disaster. Added was the complaint filled by Fran against the club because of financial differences. One of the few good news topics those weeks were the Teresa Herrera wins against Sporting Lisbon and Atl√©tico de Madrid. After an hour in the return match against Shelbourne (3-0), V√≠ctor S√°nchez finally scored a Galician goal and Depor secured their place in the tournament. Four days later Walter Pandiani earned Deportivo a late Liga point in the first domestic match of the season at Espanyol (1-1). But then the situation went downhill. First there was the humiliation of August 31 when Deportivo couldn't even add unknown Murcia midfielder Acciari to the squad because of financial problems. Some days later there was a nasty training incident when Pandiani and Luque had a row. The Uruguayan striker scored his second goal of the season at home against Osasuna, but the Basques added three and shocked Riazor (1-3). Three days later the team dominated the Champions League home match against Olympiakos Piraeus but couldn't score (0-0). A come-back from 1-0 down at Atl√©tic de Bilbao was achieved by goals from Pandiani and Luque (in injury- time). But both matches couldn't hide the mounting problems. These culminated in a humiliating 1‚Äì5 defeat against Valencia on 22 September, a late draw in Riazor against Betis (1-1) and a European defeat without options at AS Monaco (2-0). After this disastrous start of the season, the worst under Irureta, in October the team restored some pride. After 49 years the team achieved a 0‚Äì1 win at the Santiago Bernab√©u against Real Madrid, the highlight of the season. Luque's fantastic goal that night was followed by a 2‚Äì1 win at home against Getafe. Deportivo were now placed eighth in the Liga and the situation looked to change. But scoring goals remained a problem. The team survived a siege at Liverpool (0-0) and earned a late point at M√°laga (1-1). Against little Cerceda (0-2) a place in the next round of the Copa del Rey was secured, but the team was out of ammunition in the next matches. The draw in Riazor against Albacete (0-0) was a poor result, but the defeat against Liverpool (0-1) was the end of the European dreams. With Mauro Silva being out injured during many weeks of his final season, it was veteran Fran who tried to lift injury- plagued Deportivo with a goal at Barcelona. Days before he had announced his retirement at the end of the season. But it was an effort in vain because the match at the Nou Camp was lost (2-1) and three days later Elche eliminated Deportivo from the Copa del Rey (1-0). The team bounced back with wins against Levante (1-0) and a stunning one at shining Villarreal (0-2). The team had with that moved up to fifth place in the Spanish league due to the head-to- head rule, but never during this season would the team be placed higher. The end of the Champions League was humiliating with a 1‚Äì0 defeat at Olympiakos Piraeus and a 0‚Äì5 score against Monaco in Riazor. Deportivo became the first team in the history of the Champions League not to have scored a single goal in the first group phase. The first newspaper reports appeared about ‚Äòthe end of a cycle‚Äô and the board announced no signings would be made this season after the European exit. The surrounding three Liga matches all finished 2-2: the team threw away a 2‚Äì0 lead against Real Sociedad, earned a late draw at Racing de Santander and saw how Baptista earned Sevilla a late point in Riazor. The year ended with more drama after defeats at Atl√©tico (1-0) and at home against Real Zaragoza (2-3). After seventeen Liga matches Deportivo were now situated at place thirteen at twenty points of leaders FC Barcelona. How things can change in just six months. The year 2005 started with rumours about Del Bosque or Caparr√≥s replacing Irureta at the end of the season. Deportivo threw away a lead twice at Mallorca (2-2) and did the same in Riazor against bottom-placed Numancia (1-1). Then Walter Pandiani rebelled. The Uruguayan striker called Deportivo ‚Äúa sinking ship‚Äù and accused coach Javier Irureta of ‚Äúwashing his hands in innocence‚Äù. The team responded by defeating Espanyol 4-1 and earning a hard-fought point at Osasuna (1-1). But Pandiani had played his final minutes at the club. He was loaned out to Birmingham City for the remainder of the season and the Galicians added Fabrizio Coloccini to the squad, followed by a deal with Juli√°n de Guzm√°n some days later. The Hannover midfielder would join Deportivo on a free transfer that summer. In the Liga, the only competition left, the Galicians worked on their restoration. Deportivo had a narrow escape at home against Athl√©tic (1-1) but achieved an important win at 2004 champions Valencia (1-2); a sweet revenge for the humiliating September defeat in Riazor. But the ninth place of this moment would not be improved until the final day of the season. After some fresh bullets from Pandiani out of England, who kept on criticizing Irureta, the 2‚Äì0 defeat at Betis Sevilla was a setback. But this was quickly overcome with a home win against Real Madrid (2-0). In March the Galicians earned a point at Getafe (1-1) and won their matches against M√°laga (1-0) and Albacete (0-1). At just one point of a UEFA cup spot, confidence seemed to be back when FC Barcelona visited Riazor on March 19. Although the Catalans played almost the entire second half with ten men after M√°rquez was sent off, Giuly's early goal sealed Depor's faith (0-1). These points were retaken with a 0‚Äì1 win at Levante. But the home match against Champions League contenders Villarreal on 10 April proved to be fatal. Deportivo wasted a lead when Arzo scored the equalizer with only some minutes remaining, after full Galician domination. Deportivo remained at ninth position, at five points of a Champions League spot. All hopes of reaching the Champions League now were gone, and a UEFA Cup spot didn't seem to be the best motivation. The only positive note from the 1‚Äì0 defeat at Real Sociedad was the debut of young striker Xisco. On 24 April even these European hopes were over after a shocking 1‚Äì4 home defeat against Racing de Santander, and the possibility of playing Intertoto Cup became Depor's only realistic way to play European football. It led to an article in Depor's official newspaper stating that Irureta would not be in charge of Deportivo during the next season. Sevilla inflicted Depor's third consecutive defeat (2-0). Some pride was restored with a 2‚Äì0 home win against Atl√©tico, with Pedro Munitis being very lively and Xisco starting his first Liga match. It was Xisco who scored two goals at Zaragoza (2-2) one week later, but the team threw away the lead. The final match of Mauro Silva and Fran in Riazor, and wearing the shirt of Deportivo, ended in another poor result: a 0‚Äì3 home defeat against relegation-troubled Mallorca. It led to accusations of Levante of ‚ÄòDepor throwing away the match‚Äô, with the accusations specifically aimed at defender Romero. But these words were taken back quickly after the realisation set in that Deportivo simply weren't motivated anymore during the final weeks of the season. On 29 May 2005 the nightmare season ended with a 1‚Äì1 draw at already relegated Numancia. Their defender Juanpa scored Depor's goal, just enough to see the Galicians finish eighth and to qualify for Intertoto football. Deportivo finished the season with just 51 points; 20 points less compared to the previous season. It was the worst season under Irureta and the team just avoided doing worse than during the season 1997/1998. That season, the worst of the team since 1992, Deportivo ended with 49 points. The players most frequently used that campaign were: Molina/Mun√∫a - Romero, Jorge Andrade, C√©sar Mart√≠n/Coloccini, Manuel Pablo - Luque, Valer√≥n, Sergio, Lionel Scaloni/Duscher, Munitis/V√≠ctor S√°nchez - Trist√°n/Pandiani =2005/2006: Caparr√≥s and the 'Transition Year'= Joaqu√≠n Caparr√≥s. In the summer of 2005, much had changed compared to the year before. Depor had missed out on European football for the first time since 1998 and two other pillars (after players like Naybet, Djalminha, Donato and Makaay in the two years before) of the period since 1992 left the club: Mauro Silva and Fran. Combined with the arrival in early June 2005 of new coach Joaqu√≠n Caparr√≥s (from Sevilla), who is known for his capacity to work with youngsters, the biggest reconstruction since 1998 took place. Other coaches who were named as possible successors were Javier Aguirre, Ernesto Valverde, V√≠ctor Mu√±oz, Vicente Del Bosque, Jose Antonio Camacho, Luis Fern√°ndez, Bernd Schuster and Marcelo Bielsa. Deportivo had experienced some difficult seasons since 1992, like the ones of 1995/1996 and 1997/1998, but never two in a row until 2005. Besides, in those other seasons it always had qualified for European football and only in 1999 didn't finish among the first three. So, Caparr√≥s was going to fight against history, and maybe too much expectations. It's not known what kind of agreements Caparr√≥s made with Lendoiro about the squad composition or transfer policy. But like Irureta, the Andalucian coach would have to do with limited means. Not only Mauro Silva and Fran had left Deportivo; other established names like Walter Pandiani (early August) and Albert Luque (at the end of August) would follow. Pandiani was rejected by Caparr√≥s and Luque was sold for much-needed income. As usual, many names were related to the Galician club that summer although not the bigger ones as before; Nakamura, Javi Fuego, Tomasson, Dorashoo, Fernando Baiano, Saha, Uche, Riki, Fatih Tekke, Viduka, Carlton Cole and Marcus Bent were some of the mentioned players. But in the end, only midfielder Juli√°n de Guzm√°n and defender Juanma arrived on free transfers while near the end of the transfer season unknown striker Taborda was added to the squad. Again, the squad of Deportivo was considered to have lost qualities. But Caparr√≥s took up the challenge and aimed at taking the maximum out of the players available. That included getting experienced ones like Trist√°n (who was aiming at the World Cup 2006), V√≠ctor S√°nchez and Coloccini, for example, back to their level of previous years. His plans also included to get the team hungry again and to have some talented players in the first squad. Precisely his ability to get youngsters at Primera level was one of the main reasons why Caparr√≥s was signed by Deportivo. The financial problems of the club left it with no much choice than to start using younger players. Lendoiro explained it like this: ‚ÄúWith some bargains and one or two good signings we built Superdepor of Arsenio (Iglesias). Later we made a big (financial) effort signing good players and we created the successful team of Irureta. Now it's time for the third part: to continue playing among the elite with players coming from Deportivo B‚Äù. The season started quite early as for the first time Intertoto matches were on the schedule, a sideway to qualification for the UEFA Cup tournament. In the first two rounds, clubs like Buducnost (4-2 on aggregate) and Slaven (4-0 on aggregate) were beaten. Impressive were two wins against Newcastle United: both matches finished 2‚Äì1. Just one more scalp now was needed to achieve qualification: the one of Olympique Marseille. After a 2‚Äì0 win in Riazor the teams were level 1‚Äì1 in France with just 25 minutes remaining. When Marseille scored their second goal and Capdevila was sent off, the team broke down and eventually surrendered with just two minutes remaining. This match finished 5‚Äì1, although during the whole of the tournament Deportivo have given a positive impression. Striker Rub√©n scored four goals, defender Jorge Andrade three while youngsters Xisco and Iv√°n Carril also found the net. Although midfielder Duscher was discarded initially by Caparr√≥s, his fine performances during the pre-season made him an important player again. The optimistic mood was confirmed by Deportivo winning their sixth consecutive Teresa Herrera tournament (with Nacional and Pe√±arol as other contenders) on 15 August 2005. Rumours were spreading that Deportivo could already offer Caparr√≥s an extension to his contract which was running for just one year until 30 June 2006. The optimistic mood and early preparations were repaid during the month of September, when the team stayed unbeaten in five Liga minutes and were fifth at three points of surprising leaders Celta de Vigo. Depor started by winning at Mallorca (0-1), an opponent which always had been so difficult in the Irureta-years. Caparr√≥s‚Äô plans of using younger players were immediately revealed with the starting places of Rub√©n Castro (24) and Ivan Carril (21) combined with the second half entries of Senel (21) and Momo (23). Capdevila's injury-time strike earned the Galicians three points in their home match with Atl√©tico de Madrid (1-0). In a tense match at Valencia (2-2), Depor showed to have a mature team capable of achieving a result at a difficult stadium. The draw against Betis in Riazor (1-1) might have been somewhat disappointing, but the team finished the start of the season without a defeat after the third away match. Like against Betis, the team came back from behind against Zaragoza (1-1). Trist√°n's header at La Romareda was already his third Liga goal of the season (after his penalty against Betis and his cool finish at Valencia). Remarkable in these matches was the important part one Argentine played (Duscher) and the absence of another, even captain of the squad: Lionel Scaloni. October started very difficult to Caparr√≥s‚Äô men. On 2 October the home match against Osasuna was lost (0-1), but included the Liga debut of young playmaker Iago, and thirteen days later the team was 1-3 down at home against strong FC Barcelona just after the break. Goals of Munitis and Rub√©n Castro still earned the Galicians a deserved draw after an intensive fight, but the team couldn't repeat this when on 23 October it was 2-0 down at Real Sociedad after just twenty-four minutes. These results left Deportivo being twelfth, closer to the relegation spots (at four points) as to the first spot surprisingly occupied by Getafe (at seven points). Jorge Andrade limped off injured in the Barcelona match and would be out for a month. To the contrary, Scaloni had returned to the team in the match at Anoeta and also started the next four when Deportivo turned things around again. At home against Real Madrid (third in the table, but without Zidane, Ronaldo and Baptista) the unbeaten run against them since 1991 continued because of goals by the new signings: two by defender Juanma and one from De Guzm√°n. Four days later another team from the Spanish capital, second- placed Getafe, were beaten 1-0 thanks to a Trist√°n goal. The match at M√°laga finished 1-1 because of a great equalizer of Valer√≥n. Fourteen days after it another away match, at Racing de Santander, resulted in a 3‚Äì0 win and Deportivo occupying sixth place. Still, after the good results at on-third of the season, there were some unhappy faces in Depor's squad. Duscher and Scaloni remained having a somewhat difficult relationship with Caparr√≥s. Duscher kept being related to foreign clubs. Scaloni openly defended the players whose contracts were going to run out in 2006 or 2007 and asked for negotiations. C√©sar and Juanma supported him. Lendoiro responded by saying that he didn't expect players to concern themselves with ‚Äúmanagerial aspects of the club‚Äù. Meanwhile, Trist√°n's game kept being unconvincing after the difficulties he had in the final seasons under Irureta. He scored four goals in the first twelve Liga matches, including one penalty, but on the pitch still wasn't the leader Caparr√≥s wanted him to be. In the C√°diz match several weeks later, he was criticized by the Riazor crowd from the first minute even after having scored the only goal of the match. Finally, the smooth game of the earlier years had disappeared. Deportivo now more aimed at a physical game and scored a lot of their goals out of standard plays. On 27 November 2005 the classy team of Villarreal had outplayed Deportivo in Riazor (0-2). But the home stadium of Deportivo had lost to be the fortress it was once. For the first time in many years, Deportivo were more self-convinced playing away from home than in La Coru√±a itself. This probably had to do with the style it was handling: waiting for opponents to make mistakes instead of being more creative themselves. That tactic proved to be a success in the next three matches: away to Sevilla and Celta and home to newly promoted C√°diz. In Sevilla, the referee booked a total of twelve players and gave red cards to two Sevilla players. Effective Deportivo took advantage of by scoring two goals (0-2). One week later, the team again didn't play impressive but secured three important points at home against C√°diz (1-0) thanks to, as mentioned earlier, a goal of Diego Trist√°n. When the Christmas break approached, there was overall satisfaction though about the way Deportivo was evolving. One of the highlights of the season will have been the away match with Celta de Vigo (seventh placed) on 17 December 2005. In the days before, Caparr√≥s extended his contract for two more years to 2008 and Deportivo signed talented striker Javier Arizmendi from Atl√©tico de Madrid (taking Momo's place). It became an excellent week when during the Galician derby Deportivo quickly took control. After initial pressure from the home side, Celta's goalkeeper Pinto was sent off and Diego Trist√°n converted the following penalty kick. Goals of Valer√≥n and Capdevila before the break clinically finished off Celta to make the final score 0‚Äì3. Deportivo now shared third Liga spot with Real Madrid, Villarreal and Valencia. It seemed as the glory days of the Irureta-era were returning. Considering the loss of many important players in the previous two-and-a-half years, that meant an enormous achievement. But it wasn't supposed to be like that. Still in 2005, Deportivo lost another home match, this time against Espanyol (1-2) who played almost all of the second half with ten men. At least Trist√°n's late goal gave him a total of eight and made him the best Spanish striker after Valencia's David Villa, which could mean a boost to the striker. Besides, young striker Xisco was used for the first time by Caparr√≥s. Depor's Copa del Rey home match against Osasuna (3-0), who were second placed in the Liga, was impressive, but one has to keep in mind that the team from Navarra missed many several key players, rotated others and had their share of chances. In the Liga there was another away victory for the effective Galicians: 1‚Äì2 at Athl√©tic de Bilbao. It was now 7 January 2006, with Deportivo higher placed in the Liga than Real Madrid, Villarreal and Sevilla and very well alive in the Copa del Rey. The pass to the next round was sealed after a minimal defeat in Pamplona (1-2). The next opponent would be arch- rivals Valencia and in the Liga there was a good opportunity to take points in Riazor from relegation-troubled Alav√©s and Mallorca. The future looked good. However, in January the season became more difficult. With Capdevila, Jorge Andrade and Munitis suspended, and Valer√≥n rested, Alav√©s took three points from Riazor by winning 0‚Äì2, including a goal of their striker Bodoipo (who would join Deportivo after this season). The team didn't needed much motivation when Valencia played in Riazor for the Copa del Rey, and a late penalty kick of Sergio decided the match in Depor's favour (1-0). It confirmed Depor's image as a tough, result-orientated team, which was at its best when opponents were assumed to be superior. But the other side of the mirror was confirmed once more in the Liga home match against troubled Mallorca. The score sheet during the break, with Valer√≥n and Trist√°n on it, reminded of the old days. But just ten minutes after the restart, Mallorca were level again and took a point away from Riazor (2-2). The Galicians had only been able to win four out of eleven matches in Riazor, and again their game was unconvincing. What might have decided the rest of the season was the major knee injury playmaker Valer√≥n suffered near the end of this match. He would be out for the rest of the season 2005/2006 and this eliminated even more creative qualities of the team. The slip of Deportivo in the Liga table towards sixth spot was followed by the always tense (Copa) match at Mestalla against Valencia where the Galicians defended their 1‚Äì0 win from the first match. The start of the match resembled much the Supercopa confrontation between the two sides in August 2002 when Deportivo defended a 3‚Äì0 lead and a hyper-motivated saw Ayala being sent-off in the initial phase after elbowing Depor's striker Makaay. This time Marchena found Arizmendi as his target and the home side were down to ten men. Their players and supporters got even more heated up, but still Valencia scored the first goal of the match near the break. However, quickly after it one of the referee's assistants was hit with a coin coming from the crowd and the match was suspended for that night. Another chapter in the rivalry between Deportivo and Valencia, dating back to 1994, had opened. The RFEF, the Spanish, rather quickly decided that the match had to be continued, in an empty Mestalla, where it had stopped. But Deportivo president Lendoiro appealed to that decision at the Consejo Superior de Deportes (CSD). That same week strong rumours appeared about a move of V√≠ctor S√°nchez, who hadn't finished a Liga match until then, to Liverpool FC. It was a choice for Deportivo to still get some money now, because V√≠ctor's contract was going to run out a few months later (like the contracts of Molina and C√©sar Mart√≠n), or to use the winger for the final part of the season. In the Liga itself, a win at Atl√©tico was Depor's aim to make it five in a row in away matches (which would mean a record in Depor's history). Until then it had been a weird season with Deportivo only taking fifteen points out of eleven home matches but eighteen points out of nine away matches. However, one way or the other, the Galicians were heading towards qualification for European football and had a good chance of reaching the next phase in the Copa del Rey. At Atl√©tico, the team came back from behind twice after a terrible first half, but ten minutes before the end of the match still capitulated (3-2). That week, V√≠ctor S√°nchez even already had his personal terms agreed with Liverpool when near the transfer market deadline the deal was off. Shocking news was the loan out of Lionel Scaloni, at the club since January 1998, to English side West Ham United. He was replaced with a loan deal concerning Sevilla winger Francisco Gallardo. In court, the CSD rejected Depor's appeal and so did an ordinary justice court, meaning that the match would be continued on 1 February 2006. Again, this reminded on an earlier match against Valencia as in 1995 the final of the Copa del Rey had to be continued several days later after heavy rain. But in the end all worked out well when in this restarted match, youngster Senel was pushed to the ground with twenty minutes remaining and Vict√≥r S√°nchez, who almost had worn the red and white of Liverpool, sentenced the Copa round from the spot (1-1). Valencia had their revenge three days later when Deportivo suffered their second Liga defeat in a row and their fifth in total in Riazor (0-1). Villa's goal gave Valencia the lead when history of the days before seemed to repeat itself: V√≠ctor S√°nchez had a chance from the penalty shot to equalize. The winger missed though, and also missed the retry which the referee had ordered, meaning that Deportivo slipped away to eighth spot in the Liga. From the transfer market it was rumoured that Deportivo already had agreed terms with M√°laga midfielder Juan Rodr√≠guez and defender Lopo (Espanyol). They would join Deportivo on a free transfer in June. Precisely the Catalans were Depor's opponents in the next Copa round, starting at the Montjuic. After four minutes Rub√©n's penalty kick gave Depor the lead and the team seemed to be heading towards the final of the Copa del Rey. But after the break Espanyol equalized from the spot and suddenly the Galicians were down to ten men when Coloccini was sent off. The team hung on the draw when near the end it was Walter Pandiani, back in Spain after his spell at Birmingham City, gave the home side the victory (2-1). Now the season of Deportivo was becoming more difficult and the team had to react at Betis Sevilla. Although the home side dominated that match, Rub√©n's goal near the end earned Depor three valuable points. Despite this result, there remained unrest in the squad and striker Diego Trist√°n had a row with Caparr√≥s. He had scored just one goal in the past eleven matches (Copa included) and still had failed to impress. Caparr√≥s had been making many changes in his line-ups until that moment, and the team had even more troubles being creative with the absence of Valer√≥n; many goals kept coming out of standard plays. Usually, good results are always the best medicine for a team facing difficulties. But again the team couldn't win at home: this time against Zaragoza (1-1), thanks to fine saves of Molina, with another sending-off of Coloccini. On 26 February 2006, the team was eight again in the Liga and had to travel to Pamplona to meet fourth-placed Osasuna. The team were 1-0 down when during the break Diego Trist√°n entered the match. After the break, it was Sergio who equalized and the Andalucian striker earned Deportivo another away win (2-1). But it remained a season of ups and downs, of highlights and drama; of optimism and pessimism, of losing ‚Äòeasy‚Äô matches and winning unexpectedly. For example, Deportivo did pretty well at the Nou Camp and were leading with two goals against one after half an hour. Another away victory, this time against the mighty Liga leaders and with it a return to the European spots, looked possible. However, after ninety minutes the score-board reflected a 3‚Äì2 loss and defender Jorge Andrade was diagnosed to be out for the rest of the season, including the World Cup 2006. One week later, seventeenth-placed Real Sociedad looked to be the ideal candidate for Deportivo to achieve their first home win of the year 2006 against. But again there was only frustration after ninety minutes: 0‚Äì1. Three days later the balsam of the season, the Copa del Rey, was restarted again with the Semifinal second leg against Espanyol. It was the final blow to Depor's aspirations as once again the team lacked being creative enough upfront against Lotina's men: 0-0. It was 15 March 2007: the team now was out of the Copa del Rey, ninth in the Liga and had to finish the season without Valer√≥n and Jorge Andrade. The season existed of small episodes of positive and negative results. After the next four Liga matches there would be some renewed optimism, although the team performance kept being unconvincing. Getafe had the best of their home match against Deportivo, but the Galicians left their stadium with three points (1-2). Against relegation-troubled M√°laga at home, the team were down until V√≠ctor S√°nchez scored two goals out of free- kicks (2-1). After these two hard-fought wins, Deportivo were back in the race for European football at sixth spot. At the Bernab√©u it's no shame for a team as Deportivo to lose, but the Galicians were disastrous and left the pitch with a hopeless 4‚Äì0 final score; the biggest loss at the Bernab√©u since Depor's return to the elite. However, Deportivo kept bouncing way and back and secured their second consecutive home win against Racing de Santander (2-0). The team was still knocking on the door of European football and kept all options intact. It wasn't to be though. First, news reports appeared about Caparr√≥s having arguments with club president Lendoiro with the coach threatening to leave in June. Caparr√≥s was still unhappy that when the season started he still had to work with an overcrowded squad, leaving not much space for youngsters in this season. Also, the fact that he didn't was consulted on Scaloni's loan move had hurt the coach. More important, it looked likely that Molina and V√≠ctor S√°nchez were going to leave Deportivo within three months (both were out of contract) because of their high salaries. The same was said about Duscher (only one year of contract left) and Jorge Andrade. Also, Caparr√≥s wasn't completely happy with the way daily business was run at Depor's training centre at Abegondo concerning the youth teams. Finally, Caparr√≥s had been expecting creative winger Mark Gonz√°lez of Liverpool but in the end this deal collapsed because of minimal financial differences. Now, with Deportivo being unimpressive and troubled in the Liga, the bubble started to burst. It led to a press conference where the full board of Deportivo responded to the situation. After it winger V√≠ctor S√°nchez gave his version of his possible contract renewal and blamed the club. It cannot be made clear what influence all this had on the performances of the team. But within the space of five weeks, the final part of the season, it threw away all options of European football by winning just one match. A point at Villarreal (1-1) is always useful (although the Galicians threw away a lead). At home against Sevilla, the 0‚Äì0 draw was reasonable because Deportivo had half their squad out injured or sick. Both concerned direct rivals though: Sevilla, Deportivo and Villarreal now occupied places six to eight with last two mentioned teams being subscribed for Intertoto football (Spain had only one place available). In C√°diz two vital points were lost when the home side scored a late equalizer against nine players of Deportivo (De Guzm√°n and Manuel Pablo were sent off). On 30 April 2006 it was going to be all or nothing against Celta de Vigo. The regional rivals occupied the first UEFA Cup spot, at five points of Deportivo, and sixth-placed Sevilla were at just one point. History gave the home side courage because Celta hadn't won in Riazor for twelve years. But it became a very painful night in La Coru√±a. The home side needed the three points, and after Celta's goal after thirty-four minutes knew that scoring two goals had been very difficult this season. Frustration is the word best used for the final part of the match when Deportivo simply didn't seem capable of turning the match around. First, Coloccini was sent off once more. After it, Celta scored their second goal and in the end celebrated their win in front of faces full of disbelief. UEFA Cup football now was four points away, but at least Intertoto rival Villarreal was two points below Deportivo. Four days later nothing changed in the table after Deportivo defeated Espanyol at the Montjuic (1-2). It was close call though because the relegation-troubled home side were 1-0 up with fifteen minutes remaining, when substitute Iv√°n Carril first equalized himself and near the end provided Trist√°n a perfect cross to sentence the match. It was Depor's ninth away win in a season, a record. With two matches against other relegation-troubled clubs remaining, at least Intertoto football now seemed secured. Especially after Deportivo were leading 1‚Äì0 against Bilbao with twenty minutes remaining. But at the end of this match, Bilbao was celebrating like Celta had done one week earlier (1-2). It was a painful final home match of the season which reflected the poor home record of the team. Now there was another bomb burst. Disappointed about this result, Caparr√≥s said on local radio: \\"I don't know if I have the drive to lead a new project at Deportivo.\\" A phrase that has been understood as his desire for leaving the club. But on the next day he changed his declarations. The Sevillan coach assured that he still has ‚Äúthe illusion to direct the club\\" and also mentioned that he sees himself ‚Äúdirecting Deportivo during the pre- season\\". Osasuna, who knew that their coach Javier Aguirre was going to Atl√©tico de Madrid, openly flirted with the coach, but at a press conference president Lendoiro warned them to stay away. It looked like the season was already over, but the team still had to defend their lead (reduced to one point) over Villarreal for Spain's Intertoto spot at Alav√©s, who themselves desperately needed to win to avoid relegation. So it became another interesting night. But after an hour, Deportivo were in trouble because Villarreal we‚Äôre leading 2‚Äì0 at home against Racing de Santander meaning that the Galicians needed to win their match. That task became impossible when with twelve minutes remaining, Alav√©s‚Äô striker Bodipo scored his second goal against Depor that season and at that moment kept his side in the Primera Divisi√≥n (1-0). After it, Deportivo were powerless and knew that the season were over. But Alav√©s too ended with a deception, when Espanyol saved themselves in injury-time against Real Sociedad and Alav√©s still were relegated. The season had been a long and suffering one, when on 14 May 2006 it was over. Like in 1994, Deportivo finished disappointingly. But compared to twelve years before, when a last-minute penalty-miss of Djukic made Deportivo losing the Liga title but still sharing first place, the future now looked more difficult. It's debatable whether the season was a success or a failure. Probably it was something between. On the bright side: Deportivo had equalled the year before but with less qualities. Away from home the team achieved marvellous results. A handful of younger players had entered the team. A player liked Pedro Munitis was excellent and so was Duscher, who didn't seem to count anymore one year before. A positive surprise also was Juanma; he started twenty-two Liga matches and even scored four goals. Andr√©s Guardado played for Deportivo between 2007 and 2012. 2006 onwards: Deterioration and relegation During the second half of the decade the squad weakened and Deportivo became a mid-table team.

The Three Vajras correspond to the trikaya and therefore also have correspondences to the Three Roots and other refuge formulas of Tibetan Buddhism. The Three Vajras are viewed in twilight language as a form of the Three Jewels, which imply purity of action, speech and thought. The Three Vajras are often mentioned in Vajrayana discourse, particularly in relation to samaya, the vows undertaken between a practitioner and their guru during empowerment. The term is also used during Anuttarayoga Tantra practice. In Tendai and Shingon Buddhism of Japan, they are known as the . Nomenclature, orthography and etymology The Three Vajras is an English rendering of gsang ba gsum (Tibetan); which has variously been rendered as: Three Secrets, Three Mysteries, Three Seats, Three Doors and Three Gateways. Another Tibetan orthography that explicitly mentions Vajra (Tibetan: rdo-rje) is: rdo rje gsang ba gsum. The full Tibetan title may be rendered into English as 'the three secrets of the noble ones' (Tibetan: phags pa'i gsang ba gsum) which are: body (Tibetan: lus and sku); voice/speech (Tibetan: gsung) and mind (Tibetan: thugs).

The concept of the Three Vajras serves in the twilight language to convey polysemic meanings, aiding the practitioner to conflate and unify the mindstream of the i·π£·π≠adevatƒÅ, the guru and the sƒÅdhaka in order for the practitioner to experience their own Buddha-nature. Speaking for the Nyingma tradition, Tulku Urgyen Rinpoche perceives an identity and relationship between Buddha-nature, dharmadhatu, dharmakƒÅya, rigpa and the Three Vajras: Robert Beer (2003: p. 186) states: The bƒ´ja corresponding to the Three Vajras are: a white om (enlightened body), a red ah (enlightened speech) and a blue hum (enlightened mind). Simmer-Brown (2001: p. 334) asserts that: This explicates the semiotic rationale for the nomenclature of the somatic discipline called trul khor.

He was Professor of Aerial Photographic Studies at the University of Cambridge from 1973 to 1980. Early life Kenneth St Joseph was born in Cookley, Worcestershire, on and attended school at Bromsgrove. He studied geology at Cambridge University and graduated in 1934. He was appointed as a lecturer in geology at Cambridge in 1937 after completing his post graduate degree. During the Second World War he served as an intelligence analyst with the RAF looking at photographs of bombing operations to judge their effectiveness. Aerial photography As a school boy, St Joseph had been interested in Roman Britain and, in the 1930s, he was able to exploit a family connection to take part in an excavation at Hadrian's Wall where he met O G S Crawford. From this meeting, St Joseph developed an interest in aerial photography.Stephen L. Dyson, In pursuit of ancient pasts: a history of classical archaeology in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries(Yale University Press, 2006) St Joseph's subsequent war time experience convinced him that aerial photography had a potentially vital role in discovering and analyzing archaeological sites. In 1948, he was appointed curator (and subsequently, director) of aerial photography at Cambridge University. Initially, he was able to persuade the RAF to take photographs for him without charge. When the RAF became unwilling to continue this programme, the university authorities hired an aircraft. In 1965, they bought a Cessna Skymaster 337http://www.cambridgeairport.me.uk/MA_News.html and employed a pilot, allowing for a systematic and extensive programme of aerial archaeology. This aircraft remained in use for forty years. Numerous new and important sites were discovered as a result of these surveys including Mucking, which was photographed on 16 June 1959.Clark, A. 1993. Excavations at Mucking, Volume 1: The Site Atlas (English Heritage Archaeological Report 20) This discovery resulted in a major excavation lasting 13 years. His interest in Roman Britain continued, and the aerial survey work discovered more than 200 previously unknown Roman forts. Some of the results of these photographic surveys were published in a series of books, the first of which - Monastic sites from the air - included text annotating the photos from David Knowles, Professor of Medieval History, who had been an influential supporter of St Joseph's appointment. The collection is now housed in the Cambridge University Unit for Landscape Modelling which is the new name for the Aerial Photography unit. Academic career St Joseph was appointed as a lecturer in Natural Sciences at Selwyn College, Cambridge, in 1939 and held this post until 1962. He was a tutor from 1945 and librarian from 1946. Between 1974 and 1980 he was Vice-Master. He was appointed curator in Aerial Photography by the University in 1948 and Director from 1962 to 1980. From 1973 to 1980, St Joseph was Professor of Aerial Photographic Studies (a personal chair) at the University of Cambridge.\\"Professors\\", Alumni Cantabrigienses Online Database. Retrieved 15 September 2019. In 1982 he was awarded with an honorary doctorate degree of the University of Amsterdam. He was a member of the Council for British Archaeology for 50 years from 1944.

It has been designated as a Site of Special Scientific Interest and a Local Nature Reserve. It is stewarded by the Coventry and District Natural History and Scientific Society. It is a mixed deciduous and coniferous woodland covering , with examples of Norway Spruce, European Larch and Hazel coppice, together with Sycamore, Oak, Spruce, Birch, Chestnut, Ash and Pine. There are specially-built paths suitable for people with disabilities (660 m). These have metal tap rails for people with visual impairment. From 1930, Coventry Corporation established the wood as a Nature Reserve and it had a regular forester assigned to it. Rides were kept clear and the removal of waste was carried out by horse and cart rather than by tractor or lorry. During the Second World War, large areas of scrub and conifers were cleared to reduce the risk of fire from air-raids. During the cyclonic gale of March 1947, five acres (2 ha) of mature spruce were uprooted. These were replaced with young trees over several years, and helped to alter the ecological balance of the reserve. The wood received SSSI status in 1952. The status was renewed in 1986 under the Wildlife and Countryside Act of 1981. The site is an example of semi-natural woodland, and one of the last remaining in the County. The ground cover includes bramble and bracken, with wavy hair-grass, creeping soft-grass, honeysuckle, and great wood-rush. Typical woodland plants include wood-sorrel, primrose and bluebells. In the wetter areas woodmillet and remote sedge are found. A pools near the north edge supports bog mosses, marsh cinquefoil, and cyperus sedge. A small mire is rich with mosses and has some clumps of bottle sedge and white sedge. Uncommon fungi on the site include Clavaria rosea, the first time it has been recorded in the county.

The encirclement campaign was met by the Communists' Counter-encirclement campaign at Hunan-Jiangxi Soviet (), also called Counter-encirclement campaign at Hunan-Jiangxi Revolutionary Base (ÊπòËµ£Èù©ÂëΩÊ†πÊçÆÂú∞ÂèçÂõ¥Ââø). The Hunan-Jiangxi Soviet successfully defended itself against the Nationalist attacks from January 29 to March 24, 1931. First stage In December 1930 the communist 16th Army stationed at the Hunan-Hubei-Jiangxi Soviet launched a preemptive strike against the Nationalist forces and annihilated an entire Nationalist regiment in Tongcheng (ÈÄöÂüé), Hubei - just before the Nationalists could begin the first attack of their encirclement campaign against Hunan-Hubei-Jiangxi Soviet. The Nationalists had to withdraw temporarily to regroup. Reinforcement troops from other regions came to the Soviet area to avenge the defeat at Tongcheng, leaving these other regions vulnerable to Communist attacks. The Hunan-Jiangxi Soviet decided to aid the Hunan-Hubei-Jiangxi Soviet by striking the government in two fronts, in the west and in the southeast of Hunan. From January 29 through February 9, 1931, the Eastern Hunan Chinese Red Army Independent Division succeeded in taking regions including Ling (ÈÖÉ) County, the town of Zixing and the town of Yongxing (Ê∞∏ÂÖ¥), and three Nationalist local security regiments guarding these towns and completely destroyed along with a regiment of the Nationalist 57th Brigade sent to reinforce these regions. In early February, 1931, the Red 7th Army was forced to abandon its bases in Guangxi and traveled northward. The Independent Division of the Hunan-Jiangxi Soviet was tasked to link up with the 7th Army. So united, the force returned to Lotus Flower (Lianhua, Ëé≤Ëä±) county. Capitalizing on their victory, the communists expanded their force and the Independent Division was renamed as the Southeastern Hunan Independent Division. With a new 2nd Regiment established, the division comprised three regiments, totaling more than 1500 troops. Both Communist offensives in Hunan were successful. In addition to obtaining more land, weaponry, money and supplies, the Hunan-Jiangxi Soviet force also linked up with the Red 7th Army at the province's border with Guangdong. The Nationalists were forced to redeploy their troops to face these new, more urgent threats; as a result the planned offensives against the Hunan-Hubei-Jiangxi Soviet went awry. Order of battle Kuomintang order of battle: (35,000 total): First stage: *Ling (ÈÖÉ) County Security Regiment *Zixing Security Regiment *Yongxing (Ê∞∏ÂÖ¥) Security Regiment *A regiment of the nationalist 57th Brigade Second stage: *5th Route Army commanded by Wang Jingyu (ÁéãÈáëÈí∞) **28th Division commanded by Gong Bingpan (ÂÖ¨ÁßâËó©) **43rd Division commanded by Guo Huazong (ÈÉ≠ÂçéÂÆó) **47th Division commanded by Shangguan Yunxiang (‰∏äÂÆò‰∫ëÁõ∏) **54th Division commanded by Hao Mengling **77th Division commanded by Luo Lin (ÁΩóÈúñ) Communist order of battle (1,500 total): First stage: *Eastern Hunan Chinese Red Army Independent Division **1st Regiment **2nd Regiment Second stage: *Southeastern Hunan Independent Division **1st Regiment **2nd Regiment **3rd Regiment Second stage In March, 1931, nationalists were mobilized for the planned second encirclement campaign against Jiangxi Soviet. The nationalist 5th Route Army deployed was en route to Jiangxi Soviet, and was tasked to first destroy the Hunan-Jiangxi Soviet on its way when the situation permitted. The nationalist 5th Route Army begun their push toward Ji'an, Jishui (ÂêâÊ∞¥), and Eternal Abundance (Ê∞∏‰∏∞) from Pingxiang, Jiangxi and Yichun, Jiangxi. The communist high command of the 1st Front Army of the Chinese Red Army of the Jiangxi Soviet ordered the local communist force of the Hunan-Jiangxi Soviet to launch a preemptive strike against the nationalist 5th Route Army in order to delay its deployment against the Jiangxi Soviet. The communist Southeastern Huan Independent Division guarding the Hunan- Jiangxi Soviet deployed its 1st Regiment and the 2nd Regiment to strike Pingxiang, Jiangxi and Yichun, Jiangxi, and its 3rd Regiment was ordered to southeastern Hunan to join up with the Chinese Red Army 7th Army from Guangxi, which by then had reached the border region of Guangdong and Hunan provinces. The communist preemptive surprise attack had successfully disrupted and halted the nationalist encirclement campaign against the Hunan-Jiangxi, and also slowed the nationalist 5th Route Army in its deployment against the Jiangxi Soviet. On March 14, 1931, the 3rd Regiment of the communist Southeastern Huan Independent Division successfully linked up with the vanguard of the Chinese Red Army 7th Army in the region of Shiduwei (ÂçÅÈÉΩÂú©) in Bi (ÈÑô) County and begun their return journey. On March 24, 1931, the communists ambushed and destroyed an entire regiment of the nationalist 19th Division, and this last battle of the encirclement campaign forced the nationalists to stop their offensives completely to withdraw and regroup. Meantime, the communists did the same by returning to Lotus Flower (Lianhua, Ëé≤Ëä±) county. The communist Southeastern Hunan Independent Division and the 58th Regiment of the Chinese Red Army 7th Army subsequently moved eastward to the region to the east of Eternal Sun (Yongyang, Ê∞∏Èò≥), and joined the 175th Regiment of the Chinese Red Army 20th Army in the local region. Reprieve Although the Nationalist 5th Route Army was ready later for another round of offensives after resting and regrouping, the nationalist high command had a different idea. The nationalist high command reasoned that its 5th Route Army was better deployed for another siege of the central communist base area instead of further encirclement of the Hunan-Jiangxi Soviet. This was because if the central leadership in the Jiangxi-Fujian Soviet was destroyed, the smaller Hunan-Jiangxi Soviet was estimated as not being able to last for long; thus, it was not worth wasting the valuable troops to be tied down on smaller local communist bases. Accordingly, the Nationalist 5th Route Army was ordered away to complete its deployment for its original purpose against their main target, and the Hunan- Jiangxi Soviet was left alone for the time being. Evacuation The Southeastern Hunan Independent Division, by 1934 renamed the Sixth Army Group, were ordered to evacuate the Soviet in August of that year and to march to the Hunan-Hubei-Sichuan-Guizhou Soviet recently established by He Long's Second Army Group. They reached the refuge in October and united there to form the Second Red Front Army. Thus the encirclement campaign against Hunan-Jiangxi Soviet is linked to the encirclement campaign against the Hunan-Hubei-Sichuan- Guizhou Soviet.

It is perpetuated by parliamentarians through their rhetoric that ignore real-word situations (e.g. class struggle). The term, which was cited as a malady, is said to confine adherents to an imaginary world, keeping them from the knowledge and realities of the external world.  Concept  The term parliamentary cretinism was originally coined by Karl Marx in chapter five of his Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Bonaparte, published in 1852 following Louis Napoleon's coup d'√©tat in France. Marx and Engels considered this a fatal delusion for the socialist movement, believing it would only waste time and allow reactionary forces to grow stronger. Marx, particularly, held the view that parliaments are indirectly representing the interests of classes but resolve problems superficially, with its politics ideologically displaced and abstracted from social conditions. This means, for Marx, that parliamentary cretinism creates an imaginary world without sense, memory, and understanding of the real world. This condition perpetuates parliamentarism by defending it against the proletariat through the destruction of the Parliament itself to reinforce the executive branch.

Woodman was a canon of the diocese of St Andrews, and as such was locally made Prior of Pittenweem on the death of the previous prior, James Kennedy, Bishop of St Andrews; however, he was opposed by one Walter Monypenny, while the new bishop, Patrick Graham, desired the position for himself.Watt & Shead, Heads of Religious Houses, p. 146. Woodman had lost litigation for this post to Monypenny by 17 September 1466, and possession to the bishop, though Woodman was still claiming this priory as late as 1477 when he became Bishop of Ross.Watt & Shead, Heads of Religious Houses, pp. 146-7. Some time after November 1465, he was collated as Prior of Restenneth by Bishop Patrick Graham, which involved him in unsuccessful litigation against the sitting prior James Dunmain.Watt & Shead, Heads of Religious Houses, p. 184. In 1468, while still litigating with Dunmain in the papal curia, he was provided as Abbot of Jedburgh.Watt & Shead, Heads of Religious Houses, pp. 119, 184. The death of the previous abbot Andrew Bolton led the Bishop of Glasgow to try to imposed Robert Turnbull as abbot, but it was Woodman who secured papal provision.Watt & Shead, Heads of Religious Houses, p. 119. Woodman was provided to the bishopric of Ross sometime before 20 August 1476, but after 22 July. He occurs as Bishop-elect on 17 August 1477, and on 16 October made a payment to the papacy of 321 gold florins through Nicholas de Rabatis and Rayner de Ricolis.Dowden, Bishops, p. 220; Watt, Fasti Ecclesiae, p. 269. He occurs again as Bishop-elect of Ross (though unnamed) on 4 May 1478.Watt, Fasti Ecclesiae, p. 269. Woodman was in the archdiocese of York in 1480, allegedly acting as a suffragan, though this may be doubtful. We have no knowledge of his consecration, and his successor William Elphinstone was provided to the (now vacant) bishopric of Ross on 3 August 1481 following the death of Woodman, though it is not possible to date Woodman's death more narrowly than either 1480 or 1481.

When he joined the Oda, Oda Nobunaga rewarded him with the fief of Tango. His son, Hosokawa Tadaoki, went on to become one of the Oda clan's senior generals. Life After the Incident at Honn≈ç-ji in 1582 Fujitaka refused to join Akechi Mitsuhide for the Battle of Yamazaki despite the fact that his son, Hosokawa Tadaoki, was married to Akechi's daughter, Hosokawa Gracia. Fujitaka shaved his head in the Buddhist tonsure, changed his name to the priestly \\"Y≈´sai\\", and delegated his status as daimy≈ç to Tadaoki. However, he remained an active force in politics as a cultural advisor, under both Toyotomi Hideyoshi and Tokugawa Ieyasu. Hideyoshi granted Fujitaka a retirement estate worth 3,000 koku in Yamashiro Province in 1586, and added another 3,000 koku in 1595. Ishida Mitsunari had asked Fujitaka to join the Western Army, but Fujitaka refused due to one of Ishida's schemes which resulted in Gracia's and his granddaughter's death. As a general in the Eastern Army, he garrisoned Tanabe Castle with around 500 soldiers. When Tanabe Castle was besieged by the Western Army, the general commanding the siege had great respect for Fujitaka. Because of this, the attack lacked the usual spirit involved in a samurai siege: the attackers amused themselves by shooting the walls with cannons loaded only with gunpowder. Fujitaka laid down arms only after an imperial decree from Emperor Go-Y≈çzei. However, this was 19 days before Sekigahara, and neither he nor his attackers were able to join the battle. Fujitaka was buried in Kyoto, but has a second grave in Kumamoto, where his grandson Tadatoshi ruled.

Group norms are typically enforced to facilitate group survival, to make group member behaviour predictable, to help avoid embarrassing interpersonal interactions, or to clarify distinctive aspects of the group‚Äôs identity. Counterproductive norms exist despite the fact that they cause opposite outcomes of the intended prosocial functions. Group norms are informal rules and standards that guide and regulate the behaviour of a group‚Äôs members. These norms may be implicit or explicit and are intended to provide information on appropriate behaviour for group members in particular social situations. Thus, counterproductive norms instead illicit inappropriate behaviour from group members. Group norms are not predetermined but rather arise out of social interactions. These norms can have powerful influence over group behaviour. Norms may arise due to critical events in a group‚Äôs history that established a precedent, as a result of primacy (the first emergent behaviour that sets group expectations), or from carry-over behaviours from past situations. Groups establish these norms based on specific group values and goals and may establish sanctions in response to deviation from these norms. Such sanctions are typically applied in the form of social exclusion or disapproval. Counterproductive norms also typically consist of these attributes but the intention behind their activation is usually not prosocial and is instead opposite to their original function. Mechanisms of counterproductive norms =Social proof= Counterproductive norms manifest in part because of the principle of social proof. Social proof is what happens when we learn what is correct by referring to the views of others. This is especially true in unclear or ambiguous situations. When people infer the appropriate behavior from the descriptive norm, they are looking to the behaviors of others to try and figure out the most effective course of action. This might be a cognitive ‚Äúshort-cut\\" to determining most effective action, as the functional perspective of normative production might suggest. Counterproductive norms can be created by looking to the behavior of others. =Normative influence= Both descriptive norms and injunctive norms are used in normative communications. If used incorrectly, they can create counter productive norms. Descriptive norms describe what constitutes a normal behavior in a given context. They are often referred to as the ‚Äúis\\" norms, because they depict things as they actually are. Injunctive norms describe whether a given action is considered acceptable. They are called the ‚Äúought\\" norms\\" because they constitute what should be. The descriptive norm is very powerful. The way that communications are phrased actually has a big impact on the effectiveness of the message. If that phrasing is used incorrectly, it follows that a counterproductive norm can develop. =Norm transmission= Norms may only exist in the context of a group. In other words, social norms do not exist with an independent individual. Norms may be transmitted deliberately by group members instructing others members on acceptable behaviour. They may also be transmitted passively through observation of others and their behaviours which are deemed acceptable by the group. Counterproductive norms are perpetuated by the same mechanisms but differ from group norms in terms of their outcomes. Theoretical perspectives Two different perspectives give explanations for the formation and existence of group norms and counterproductive group norms. The Societal-Value Perspective suggests that norms are arbitrary rules that exist as a result of cultural value or reinforcement. This theory states that a norm‚Äôs power depends on the value it represents to the culture. Social norms evolve out of behaviours that repeatedly occur and are reinforced. Thus, the strength of norms and counterproductive norms depend on various group dynamics. Because they evolve out of social interaction, one factor of norm strength is the available opportunities for group members to communicate. The strongest norms are those that are important to the group. As well, strength depends on the cohesiveness and unity of the group. The Functional Perspective suggests that norms exist to enhance survival potential by curtailing dysfunctional behaviours while encouraging socially proactive ones. Unlike the Societal-Value perspective, the Functional perspective states that norms are not arbitrary. Instead, they are meant to balance the needs of the individual with the goals of the group of social control and harmony. Thus, norms exist to serve a purpose of survival. However, counterproductive norms work in opposition to socially proactive functions and therefore, cannot be adequately explained by this theory. Both the societal-value perspective and the functional perspective theories can be integrated to describe the fact that individuals experience pressure to communicate effectively with others within a cultural belief system with behaviour patterns that are relevant and informative, in the form of customs and traditions fulfill overarching needs based on the local social culture and physical environment. Examples of counterproductive behaviors =Industrial behavior= Much research has been done regarding counterproductive work behaviours. These behaviours include things such as theft, sabotage, workplace violence and aggression, incivility, revenge and service sabotage that are willfully committed with the intention of harming an organization or its members. Some research suggests that these counterproductive behaviours are enacted when individuals or groups feel maltreated or as if they do not have legitimate options to protest. Possible antecedents of counterproductive norms include personality variables, organizational culture, control systems and injustice. Personality variables refer to individual attributes such as integrity. In fact, results on integrity tests have been shown to be correlated to counterproductive work behaviors. Organizational culture includes both the behavior of people within an organization and the meaning placed on these behaviors. An increased perception of the level of organizational acceptance for sexual harassment being correlated to actual reports of unwanted sexual coercion is an example of organizational culture influence on counterproductive workplace behavior. Control systems are physical or procedural entities that aim to reduce counterproductive behaviors or increase the penalties for engaging in these behaviors in the workplace. Sophisticated security systems are typically put in place with the intention of preventing counterproductive workplace behaviors but may be used in some situations as a means of committing sabotage (e.g. by falsifying records). Injustice in the work environment consists of perceived inequity as well as various other ideas within the concept of organizational justice. Organizational justice is composed of the concepts of distributive justice, which refers to equitable allocation of resources, and procedural justice, which refers to how these decisions are made and their perceived fairness. Feelings of injustice and frustration have been linked to various counterproductive behaviors such as sabotage, time-wasting, interpersonal aggression, job apathy, and other anti-social behaviors. =Environmental messaging= Iron Eyes Cody PSA One example of counterproductive norms are the Iron Eyes Cody Keep America Beautiful public service announcements. Cialdini (2003) argues that while the ad makers convey an injunctive norm about environmentalism, they contrasted this by portraying littering as a descriptive norm. While they did have a lot of success and have been recognized as some of the best PSAs of all time, Cialdini argues that they could have been more effective, had they conveyed different descriptive norms. Petrified wood Example A study by Cialdini and colleagues tested whether signs conveying different norms had an effect on the rate of theft of petrified wood in a national forest. They used one sign with a descriptive norm and one with an injunctive norm. The descriptive norm ‚Äúnormalized\\" the behavior of theft, and as a result, raised the amount of theft. The injunctive norm was more effective at reducing theft, and lowered it from the baseline. The study gives us some empirical evidence that when messaging uses normative influence incorrectly, it can create or maintain a counterproductive norm.

Life and career After completing her education, Dane went to Switzerland to work as a French tutor, but returned home after a year. She studied art in London and Germany. After the First World War, she taught at a girls' school and began writing. She took the pseudonym \\"Clemence Dane\\" from the church, St Clement Danes on the Strand, London. Her first novel, Regiment of Women, written in 1917, was a study of life in a girls' school.Michael Cox and Jack Adrian, The Oxford Book of Historical Stories. Oxford;Oxford University Press, 1994. (p.436). In 1919 she wrote Legend, the story of a group of acquaintances who debate the meaning of a dead friend's life and work. Dane's 1921 play, A Bill of Divorcement, tells the story of a daughter who cares for her deranged father and faces the fact that his mental illness may be hereditary. The smash hit play was adapted for the screen three times, using the same title as the play: a silent film in 1922, a 1932 film starring Katharine Hepburn and John Barrymore, and a 1940 film starring Maureen O‚ÄôHara and Adolphe Menjou. Dane began writing screenplays as well as novels. She co-wrote the screenplay for Anna Karenina, starring Greta Garbo. The pinnacle of Dane's success was winning an Academy Award with Anthony Pelissier for the film Vacation from Marriage, released in the United Kingdom as Perfect Strangers, starring Robert Donat and Deborah Kerr as a married couple transformed by their experiences in the Second World War.

Dane's 1931 novel Broome Stages followed the fortunes of an acting family from the time of Queen Anne to the present. Broome Stages became a surprise bestseller. Dane and Helen de Guerry Simpson wrote three detective novels featuring their creation, Sir John Saumarez. Both were members of the Detection Club. The first novel, Enter Sir John, was filmed by Alfred Hitchcock in 1930 as Murder!. Dane contributed to the Club's serials The Scoop and The Floating Admiral. Dane's The Arrogant History of White Ben (1939) is a dystopian novel set in a politically unstable near future.Jenny Hartley, \\"Clothes and Uniform and the Theatre of Fascism: Clemence Dane and Virginia Woolf\\" in Angela Smith (ed.), Gender and warfare in the twentieth century: textual representations. Manchester University Press, 2004 (p. 97). Dane's last play, Eighty in the Shade (1959) was written for and starred her friend, Dame Sybil Thorndike. Dane is believed to be the template for the character Madame Arcati, the eccentric medium in her friend No√´l Coward's play, Blithe Spirit. The National Portrait Gallery contains two works by Dane, both of Coward. One is an oil painting and the other is a bronze bust. The gallery also contains a portrait of Dane by Frederic Yates. According to Arthur Marshall, she was famous for her indecent, though entirely innocent, remarks. \\"The physical side of life had passed her by, together with the words, slang and otherwise, that accompany it. Time and again she settled for an unfortunate word or phrase. Inviting No√´l Coward to lunch during the war, when food was difficult, she boomed encouragement down the telephone; 'Do come! I've got such a lovely cock.' ('I do wish you'd call it a hen', Noel answered). To use correctly, in a literary sense, the words 'erection', 'tool' and 'spunk' was second nature to her. When wishing to describe herself as being full of life and creative energy, she chose, not really very wisely, the word 'randy'.\\"Arthur Marshall, Life's Rich Pageant p 103-104 In 1955, Dane edited the Novels of Tomorrow series for publisher Michael Joseph.

One can use a songbook. Common genres are folk songs, patriotic songs, hymns and drinking songs. Children across the world usually sing nursery rhymes together. Sing-along can be based on unison singing, or on singing in harmony (different parts). Among animals Group vocalizing is known in several animal species. For example, a lion pride and a pack of wolves are known to vocalize together (supposedly to defend their territory), although some scholars do not characterize their vocalizations as \\"singing\\". Gibbons sing in family groups (couples sing together, sometimes with their offspring). Various species of birds also sing in duets and choruses, particularly in the tropics. In human pre-history Singing in groups is one of the universal features of human musical cultures, and group singing has been often suggested as the primary form of the early human musical activity.Merker, Bjorn. 2000. ‚ÄúSynchronous chorusing and human origins.‚Äù In The origins of music. Edited by Nils Wallin, Bjorn Merker and Steven Brown, pp. 315-328. Cambridge, Massachusetts: MIT. It has been suggested that human group singing was primarily promoting the cohesiveness within human groups,John Blacking. 1973. How musical is Man?

Origins of Human Choral Singing, Intelligence, Language and Speech. Logos Forms of group singing In human societies, group singing can be limited to certain sexes, ages, and social groups. Group singing can be also different in the actual sound, for example, singing in unison or octaves, accompanied or a capella or singing in harmony (in different parts, like canon). Informal group singing can be accompanied by body movements, stomping, or clapping. Organized, regularly scheduled sing- along sessions are held in both cities and rural areas, often referred to as \\"song circles\\" and sometimes organized by formal groups or organizations. Sometimes individual musicians will share their own songs with the group, but more often an individual will request a song that the whole group will sing together.

History Kampala Kids League (KKL) was founded by Trevor Dudley in 1998 to help boys and girls aged 4‚Äì14 in the capital city of Uganda to improve their lives through sport. Schools in the city were coming under pressure at that time to improve academic results and sports were being excluded. New schools were also being built without playing fields. Children in Uganda therefore needed the opportunity to play team sports. Since then over 16,000 boys and girls from over 160 different Schools, Orphanages and Street Children's organisations have successfully completed over 50 different seasons of Football, Basketball, Baseball and Mini Cricket activity. Over 2,000 adult volunteers have been trained as coaches and administrators and over 150 different local corporate sponsors have supported the leagues. In 2003 Trevor Dudley was awarded a fellowship from Ashoka Foundation for creating significant social change in Kampala. He was awarded an MBE in the New Years Honours of 2008 for services to children's sport and health education in Uganda. Between 2001-2009 KKL prepared a youth soccer squad to travel to Europe and this popular team have won 21 International soccer tournaments, including becoming 6 times Gothia Cup World Youth Cup champions, Norway Cup winners, 8 time Tivoli Cup winners, 3 times winners of Football Festival Denmark, and lifting Haarlem Cup Holland, Pitea Summer Games and Storsjocupen tournaments in Sweden. This league is now one of the most successful of its kind in Africa. Talented young Ugandans from KKL are now represented in the ranks of the Ugandan Cranes National Football Team and some are being offered places in Academies in Europe. Dorian Viktor Klonaridis has recently joined Lille FC. In 2005 the KKL Mini Cricket programme was awarded the International Cricket Council's (ICC) Best Junior Cricket Initiative Award in Africa. KKL relies on corporate funding to support its innovative social sports programmes and is always looking to attract new supporters to expand activities. Following the success of KKL, The Kids League (Uganda) (TKL) was set up in 2004 as a non profit to help boys and girls aged 8‚Äì15 at grassroots level throughout Uganda improve their lives using sport. In 2010 Trevor officially retired and his son, Mark Dudley took over the organisation. Royal visit In November 2007, KKL was honoured with a visit by the Prince of Wales during the CHOGM conference taking place that year in Uganda. It was the first visit of the Prince of Wales to Uganda. Prince Charles visited the offices of KKL and met all the staff and 20 boys and girls representing programmes that KKL and TKL had established. Prince Charles lifted one of the Gothia Cup trophies and took penalties against one of the boys much to the delight of the waiting photographers.

She served the Union cause from 1862 until the end of war in 1865. It was named for General Gideon Pillow.  Captured and transferred to the Mississippi Squadron  General Pillow (Gunboat No. 20) was originally Confederate steamer B. M. Moore and served the South as a gunboat until she was captured on the Hatchee River, Tennessee, by 9 June 1862. She was transferred to the Union Navy by the War Department; and after outfitting and repairs at Cairo, Illinois., General Pillow departed Cairo 23 August for duty with the Mississippi Squadron, Lt. LeRoy Fitch in command.  Operations along the Tennessee and Cumberland  General Pillow became part of the light draft squadron on the Tennessee River and the Cumberland River, and for the next several months convoyed troop transports and fought guerrillas on the riverbanks. February 1863 saw her again at Cairo guarding mortar ships and ammunition barges, in addition to making occasional visits to Mound City, Illinois, and the mouth of the Tennessee River. She continued this duty until July 1865 when she was turned over to the Commandant of the Naval Station, Mound City, for disposal.  End-of-war decommissioning and sale  General Pillow was sold at Mound City 26 November 1865 to Wetzel and Hallerburg.

He specialized in cynical, wise-cracking (and often tipsy) characters, and his rapid-fire delivery enlivened many comedies and crime thrillers in the 1930s and 1940s. Biography Though he appeared in numerous silent films, such as Wings and Beggars of Life, his career didn't really take off until sound arrived. Arguably his best-known film role was the annoying bus passenger Oscar Shapeley, who tries to pick up Claudette Colbert in the Oscar-winning comedy It Happened One Night (1934), quickly followed by one of his best performances as the boozy press agent Owen O'Malley in Howard Hawks' Twentieth Century. (Six years later, he co-starred as one of the reporters in another Hawks classic, His Girl Friday.) In 1937, Paramount teamed him with Lynne Overman as a pair of laconic private eyes in two B comedy-mysteries, Murder Goes to College and Partners in Crime. From 1950 to 1954, Karns played the title role in the popular DuMont Television Network series Rocky King, Inside Detective. His son, character actor Todd Karns, also appeared in that series. From 1959 to 1962, Karns was cast as Captain (then Admiral) Walter Shafer in seventy- three of the ninety-five episodes of the CBS military sitcom/drama series, Hennesey, starring Jackie Cooper in the title role of a United States Navy physician, and Abby Dalton as nurse Martha Hale. His final film was another Hawks comedy, Man's Favorite Sport?, in 1964.

In addition to founding a grammar school, the Jesuits founded a Jesuit College with an accompanying library. By 1645 the library was housed in a special hall, it had a librarian and rules were established regarding the preservation and lending of books. In 1669 the Jesuit College acquired the status of an Academy by the Charter of King Leopold I and became Academia Zagrabiensis. The library and its holdings were moved into an old building of the abandoned Dominican monastery in today‚Äôs 5 St. Catherine‚Äôs Square in the Old Town of Zagreb. The Jesuit order was disbanded in 1773. The College continued with its provisional activities until 1776, when the library became part of the Royal Zagreb Academy of Sciences (Regia Academia Zagrabiensis) as an academy of law, philosophy and theology. The following year the library received a bequest containing historical material from the clergyman Adam Baltazar Krƒçeliƒá, with a stipulation that this material be made available to the wider public. As a result of legal deposit regulations introduced in 1816 bearing on the University of Pest, the library's national importance began to increase. Such legal deposit regulations were extended to the whole territory of Croatia and Slavonia in 1837. Antun Kukuljeviƒá, politician and the founder of the Croatian educational system, changed the name of the library to the Latin name, Nationalis Academica Bibliotheca, highlighting the dual nature of the library‚Äôs educational and national functions, which it has jointly developed since then and symbolically preserved in its name to this day. The Franz Josef I Royal University in Zagreb was founded in 1874, and the Academy library (Bibliotheca Regiae Academiae Zagrabiensis) became part of the University and changed its name to University Library, increasing its significance and role in higher education. In 1913 the library with its approximately 110,000 volumes moved from the building of the present-day Rector‚Äôs Office into an impressive Art Nouveau edifice located in 21 Marko Maruliƒá Square, the first building built specifically for the purposes of the library. As it was designed to house 500,000 volumes, its premises soon become inadequate for the library‚Äôs 2,500,000 volumes ‚Äì books, journals, newspapers and the particularly valuable items of the library‚Äôs special collections. A new library building, the Pantheon of the Croatian Book, was commissioned: its foundation stone was laid in 1988 and the building opened on 28 May 1995 as part of the celebration of the fifth anniversary of Croatia‚Äôs independence. This modern edifice was designed by Croatian architects Velimir Neidhardt, Marijan Hr≈æiƒá, Zvonimir Krznariƒá and Davor Mance.

The organization was founded in 1986. As of 2008, the National Arbitration Forum administered over 200,000 cases a year, most of which were consumer debt collection cases. In 2009, the National Arbitration Forum ceased administration of new consumer arbitrations as part of a consent decree with the Attorney General of Minnesota Lori Swanson concerning the NAF's ties with debt collection firms. The company maintains a panel of over 1,600 arbitrators and mediators who are attorneys and former judges located across the United States and in 35 countries around the world.National Arbitration Forum : Locations Panelists arbitrate and mediate the disputes. The company is an \\"approved\\"ICANN dispute resolution service provider of ICANN domain name disputes and has handled more than 7,600 cases.Domain Mangazine  History  The NAF was founded in 1986 as a subsidiary of another company, Equilaw, which subsequently went bankrupt in 1994. NAF survived the bankruptcy and appears to have grown rapidly in recent years.Citizen.org The NAF and Lawyers Associated Worldwide (LAW) work together on an international level.Lawyers world wide The National Arbitration Forum is located in Minneapolis, Minnesota. = Domain name disputes = An approved domain name dispute program provider for ICANN, the NAF has administered over 10,000 domain name disputes since 1999.Domains The number of domain name disputes administered is on the rise, up 143 cases from 2006 to 2007. The NAF deals predominantly with registered domain names that are abused by parties who have no legitimate rights to them. Some of the famous trademarks involved in NAF domain name dispute resolutions include Los Angeles Angels, Disney, Hershey's Kisses, Jimmy Buffett, and Univision, most recently Bill Clinton.DN Forum  Controversy  Consumer advocacy groups and attorneys frequently claim that the National Arbitration Forum is the most biased against consumers of the major arbitration organizations. In its June 16, 2008 cover story, Business Week published an in-depth look at credit collection arbitrations at NAF. The story describes how NAF markets itself to collection lawyers and then works with them in ways that raise questions about its impartiality.Business Week = Public Citizen study = In 2007, non- profit consumer advocacy group Public Citizen criticized the National Arbitration Forum, including its fee schedule and alleged bias. According to a July 2008 Navigant analysis of the Public Citizen data,Institute for Legal Reform 26,665 arbitrations out of a total of 33,948 arbitrations were either heard or dismissed (i.e. excluding settlements). According to the analysis, of these 26,665 arbitrations, consumer parties were reported to have prevailed outright or had the case against them dismissed in 8,558 cases (32.1%). In an additional 4,376 cases (16.4%), the arbitrator did not award the full amount demanded by the business. In March 2010,Domain Name Dispute Stats Reveal Concern Over Panelist Appointment a study of the National Arbitration Forum's record of panelist appointments for domain name disputes was published.Dnattorney.com web site It raised concern that a small handful of the NAF's roster panelists were appointed to hear disproportionately many cases. In one instance, a single panelist was appointed to hear 949 cases, or about 10% of all NAF domain name dispute cases ever heard. In August 2012, the study was updated and it showed a continued concentration of panellists appointments wherein seven NAF-selected panelists were appointed to hear nearly half of all cases.DNattorney.com Domain Name Dispute Study, August, 2012 Legislation and lawsuits against NAF = City of San Francisco lawsuit = In March 2008, the City of San Francisco filed a lawsuit against the National Arbitration Forum on behalf of its citizens, accusing the arbitrator of unfairly favoring credit card companies in disputes with their customers. The city alleged that the NAF was practicing unethically and wrongly with such specific concerns as ignoring evidence, inflating awards and declining hearing requests by consumers. The lawsuit said that between January 2003 and March 2007, consumers won 0.2% of the 18,075 arbitration cases in California that were not dropped, settled or otherwise dismissed. = Businessweek's allegations of bias = In June 2008, Businessweek made broad claims of NAF's bias in favor of consumer creditors and hidden conflict of interest. According to the article, NAF markets itself to consumer credit providers, collection agencies and law firms.Businessweek\`\`, 5 June 2008, =Ex-employee lawsuit= In April 2009 an ex-employee filed suit against NAF \\"for employment discrimination, deceptive trade practices and consumer fraud.\\" The suit said that \\"During the course of plaintiff‚Äôs employment at defendants, she witnessed fraudulent and corrupt practices in the administration of arbitration cases.\\"Counterpunch, 20 July 2009, Judicial Apartheid: Heralded by the Supreme Court as Fair, Vast Private Judicial System Exposed as Fraud = Minnesota Attorney General lawsuit= On July 14, 2009, the Minnesota Attorney General Lori Swanson brought a lawsuit against the National Arbitration Forum for consumer fraud, deceptive trade and false statements in advertising. Key to their complaint was allegations that the NAF had deliberately hidden its ties to the businesses it represented and actively encouraged their naming as mandatory arbitrators in contracts. The National Arbitration Forum countered that its arbitrators were independent practitioners, which ensured that its arbitration was impartial. However, citing legal costs, the National Arbitration Forum agreed the week after the filing to stop accepting consumer debt collection cases for arbitration. According to the Minnesota Attorney General, the National Arbitration Forum‚Äôs settlement with the State of Minnesota required the company to stop handling current consumer arbitrations and to not process or administer new consumer arbitrations after July 24, 2009. For years, National Arbitration Forum (‚ÄúNAF‚Äù) falsely held itself out as an independent provider of neutral arbitration services in consumer debt matters, unaffiliated with any person or entities within or outside the collection industry. However, NAF has been investigated by Minnesota local and state prosecutors for working alongside Mann Bracken authorizing illegitimate arbitration awards against consumers, deceiving the courts and the public. Both NAF and Mann Bracken concealed their relationship and the financial relationship with their common group owner known as Accretive.

He moved back to Workington in 2006 after apparently refusing to take his last two rides for Edinburgh during rain soaked meeting against Rye House Rockets on 7 July 2006, before riding for Stoke Potters in 2007. In September 2007, Harrison decided to retire from speedway after being affected by the serious injuries suffered by team-mate Garry Stead. This followed a poor run of form when he had already decided to stop riding that season, saying, \\"I just haven't got going at all and I feel I have been letting too many people down\\" said the Australian. You are a danger to yourself and others when your head is not right and it's best that I stand down now before anything else happens.\\" However, in early 2008 the King's Lynn Stars signed Harrison for the 2008 season. He rode for Glasgow Tigers and Birmingham Brummies in 2009, and rode for Workington Comets between 2010 and 2012. He quit the Comets in June 2012 due to family and work commitments, but towards the end of 2012 signed for the Comets again to ride in 2013.\\"Rusty Harrison Quits Workington Comets Speedway Team\\", Times & Star, 2 July 2012, retrieved 2012-07-02\\"Comets Hero Rusty Agrees Stunning Speedway Return\\", Times & Star, 7 December 2012.

Since 31 December 2012, it is part of the municipality Kyffh√§userland. In the area of Hachelbich has been recently discovered a Roman marching camp of the first century AD: the Hachelbich Roman castrum. This castrum -discovered in 2009- is the first Roman military camp found in Central Germany (Thuringia) and was deep inside the short-lived Roman province of GermaniaRoms Legionen f√ºhrten auch in Th√ºringen Krieg (in German) Castrum History The castrum was discovered in 2009. Excavations have taken place in the years 2010 and 2014‚Äì2015, demonstrating that it was built by the Romans. The wood discovered in the walls showed a construction period ranging from 50 BC to 125 AD: it was the time when Augustus wanted to annex to his Roman empire the short-lived province of Germania. However some academics (like Jones Brian) believe the castrum was used (or re-used) by emperor Domitian. The most significant military contribution of this emperor was the development of the Limes Germanicus, which encompassed a vast network of roads, forts and watchtowers constructed along the Rhine river to defend the Empire. Around 82 AD, he ordered an attack on the Chatti.Jones (1992), p. 128 For this purpose, a new legion was founded, Legio I Minervia, which constructed some 75 kilometres (46 mi) of roads through Chatti territory in central Germania to uncover the enemy's hiding places inside Magna GermaniaJones (1992), p. 130. In these years Domitian should have used the Hachelbich marching camp. Although little information survives of the battles fought, enough early victories were apparently achieved for Domitian to be back in Rome by the end of 83 AD, where he celebrated an elaborate triumph and conferred upon himself the title of Germanicus.Jones (1992), p. 129 Exposition of 2015 findings in the Hachelbich castrum In 2016 the archaeologists announced that they estimate the castrum size to be at least 23 hectares and probably 40 hectaresHow big was the marching camp in Hachelbich? in: Th√ºringer Allgemeine, 2 February 2016. The archaeologists estimate the castrum had the size needed for at least one Roman legion (with about 5,000 legionaries) together with auxiliary troops: a total of about 8,000 to 9,000 men could have used it. Some objects belonging to the legionaries have been found in the excavationsPhotos of the Roman marching camp and of some objects found inside. But they give no precise clue about the legion stationed or what emperor used the castrum: some researchers think that it could have been related to the third century Battle at the Harzhorn. Indeed Maximinus Thrax (the first Roman \\"soldier-emperor\\" who reigned briefly from 235 to 238 AD) was personally involved in operations against the Germanic tribes in the recently discovered battle site at Harzhorn and he raided the area around Hachelbich.

Content The first two discs comprise promotional films, from \\"Maybe I'm Amazed\\" (1970) to \\"Fine Line\\" (2005). Additional features include a documentary about his recent album Chaos and Creation in the Backyard (Creating Chaos at Abbey Road), a film about the Band on the Run album and a feature-length audio commentary from McCartney himself.

The live footage is also complemented by an optional commentary by McCartney. Other features includes his appearance at Live Aid in 1985, the Super Bowl XXXIX Halftime Show and interviews with Melvyn Bragg and Michael Parkinson.

History In the tithing rolls of Hersfeld Abbey which date from between 881 and 899, M√∂nchpfiffel is listed as the tithable place Bablide in Friesenfeld. Nikolausrieth in the area of the Golden Aue (Golden Meadow) was first mentioned in the year 1226 as Novale St. Nicolai in a document from Walkenried. J.M. Schamelius listed in his monastery directory of 1733 a convent as having been founded here in 1236 and as 'ruined' after the Reformation. M√∂nchspfiffel is a historical monastery property which was a branch of the Cistercian Walkenried Abbey. From 1920 to 1945 it belonged to the free state Thuringia. After the war and until 1991 it was a Volkseigenes Gut and Landwirtschaftliche Produktionsgenossenschaft, a type of collectivized farm in East Germany. In 1995 it was sold to Raiffeisen-Agil Warengenossenschaft, an agricultural cooperative. A notable point is that each of the constituent villages were until 2008 in different church provinces of the Evangelical Church. Nikolausrieth belonged to church province of Saxony while M√∂nchpfiffel belonged to the Thuringian. Since 2009 the two belong to the merged Evangelical Church in Central Germany.

In addition to producing its journal African Affairs (, formerly Journal of the African Society), the Society runs programmes in business, politics, the arts and education. It is a not-for-profit membership organisation based in London. History The establishment of the society in 1901 grew out of the travels of Mary Kingsley, an English writer and explorer who travelled to Africa several times in the 1890s and greatly influenced European study of the African continent. In 1893, she travelled to Luanda, Angola, where she lived with the indigenous peoples to learn their customs. In 1895 she returned to study cannibal tribes, travelled up the Ogoou√© River collecting specimens of previously undiscovered fish, and became the first European to climb Mount Cameroon. Upon her return to England, Kingsley upset many people, particularly the Church of England: she criticized missionaries, and supported many traditional aspects of African life, most controversially the practice of polygamy. Kingsley wrote that a \\"black man is no more an undeveloped white man than a rabbit is an undeveloped hare\\". She died of typhoid in South Africa in June 1900, and the African Society was formed to commemorate and continue Kingsley's work. It received a Royal charter in 1935, becoming the Royal African Society (RAS). Its current Royal Patron is Prince William, Duke of Cambridge. Its journal, originally Journal of the African Society, now African Affairs, has been in continuous publication since 1902. It is a peer-reviewed academic journal of political, economic and social science. The society administers the African Studies Association of the UK (est. 1963) which organises a biennial African studies conference, and provides the secretariat for the All-party parliamentary group (APPG) for Africa. In 2002, the society appointed Richard Dowden as its first Executive Director and began a significant expansion of its activities (see below). He was succeeded in 2017 by Dr Nicholas Westcott. Activities In addition to its journal and its support for the APPG for Africa, the society organises regular meetings on current African issues, including a series on African \\"Economies to Watch\\", and occasional major conferences. In 2009, the RAS, with the International African Institute (IAI) launched the African Arguments Book Series, published by Zed Books. This was followed by an online platform called African Arguments, which provides a forum for African journalism and analysis on current social, political, economic and cultural matters in Africa.\\"About\\" African Arguments. Cultural initiatives In 2008, the RAS supported the launch of a London African Film Festival, in co-operation with Africa at the Pictures, and subsequently established the annual festival \\"Film Africa\\".Film Africa. In 2012, the RAS established an annual literature festival called \\"Africa Writes\\".\\"A History\\", Royal African Society.Africa Writes. Having grown significantly, these festivals are now held in alternate years.

He also coached for seven U.S. Olympic swim teams. He was inducted into the International Swimming Hall of Fame in 1977 as an Honor Coach.Haines's entry from the ISHOF website; retrieved 2010-07-21. Early life Haines was born in Huntington, Indiana, and became interested in swimming after joining the local YMCA, where he won two YMCA championships. After moving to California, he founded the Santa Clara Swim Club in 1950. Haines attended college at San Jose State University. It started out as a thirteen-member swim club located in the old Santa Clara High School. This club soon became a training ground for competitive swimmers from all over the United States. He coached for twenty-three years, leaving Santa Clara in 1973. During his stay at Santa Clara, he coached 26 future Olympians, including Mark Spitz, Don Schollander and Claudia Kolb. Olympics In 1960, Haines was selected to coach at the 1960 Summer Olympics, and seven of his swimmers from Santa Clara also qualified, including 1960 gold medalists Chris von Saltza, Lynn Burke, George Harrison, and Paul Hait; the first class also included Donna de Varona and Steve Clark, who would win gold at the 1964 Olympics. In the 1960s, multi-gold medalists Don Schollander and Mark Spitz joined Santa Clara to train with Haines prior to their success at the 1964, 1968, and 1972 Olympics. College swimming From 1974 to 1978, Haines coached the UCLA men's swimming team. In 1982, Haines became the women's swimming coach at Stanford University, coaching the team to an NCAA championship in 1983 as well as two second-places finishes and two third-place finishes. Legacy He left Santa Clara in 1973, and retired from coaching swimming in 1988. In 2001, Haines was going to have a grand reunion with some of the club's former champion swimmers. However, the reunion was postponed because he suffered a stroke, which incapacitated him for the rest of his life. He died in a nursing home in Carmichael, California on May 1, 2006. He was married for 60 years to June Carter Haines, and the couple had five children. A bronze statue of Haines now stands next to the Olympic-size pool at the Santa Clara Swim Center.

It sits on the Continental Divide on the border between Jefferson County and Silver Bow County, six miles south-southeast of Butte in Beaverhead-Deerlodge National Forest at an elevation of . The pass carries Interstate 90 across the Continental Divide and is the highest point on the 3,020 mi (4,861 km) highway. The pass was discovered by Edwin Harrison McHenry, a civil engineer working for the Northern Pacific Railway, who was tasked with locating a route for the NP from the main line near Logan, Montana through to Butte. The line over the pass from Logan to Garrison, Montana via Butte became the Rocky Mountain Division, Second and Fourth Subdivisions, built in 1889. This was Northern Pacific's scenic transcontinental passenger train route used by the famous North Coast Limited and its Amtrak successor, the North Coast Hiawatha, which was discontinued in 1979. The line over the pass is currently owned by BNSF Railway. It has been inactive since 1983, as its grades and curvature are poorly suited to freight trains, which (now operated by Montana Rail Link) utilize the former Northern Pacific's easier route via Helena. It is unlikely that the rail line over the pass will ever be used again, but BNSF has resisted tearing out the line because the original lease with the Northern Pacific and the US Forest Service requires that the grade be returned to its original status, a very costly process. When Interstate 90 was built, the state of Montana used Homestake Pass to cross the Continental Divide, thereby providing an easier alternative to the US Route 10 route over the Divide at Pipestone Pass. A trail running race currently takes place annually on the Continental Divide Trail between Homestake Pass and Pipestone Pass. Hosted by Butte's Piss and Moan Running Club, the Wulfman CDT 14k is held on the Saturday closest to the Summer solstice.

Victoria and Anatolia are mentioned (without Audax) in the Roman Martyrology under the date of 10 July.Martyrologium Romanum (Libreria Editrice Vaticana, 2001 ) Anatolia was first mentioned in the De Laude Sanctorum composed in 396 by Victrice (Victricius), bishop of Rouen (330-409). Anatolia and Victoria are mentioned together in the Martyrologium Hieronymianum under 10 July: VI idus iulii in Savinis Anatholiae Victoriae; Victoria is also mentioned alone under 19 December: In Savinis civitate Tribulana Victoriae. The two saints appear in the mosaics of Basilica of Sant'Apollinare Nuovo, at Ravenna, between Saints Paulina and Christina. A Passio SS. Anatoliae et Audacis et S. Victoriae of the 6th or seventh century, which added the name of Audax, was mentioned by Aldhelm (died 709) and Bede (died 735), who list the saints in their martyrologies. Caesar Baronius lists Anatolia and Audax under 9 July and Victoria under 23 December. Legend Their legend recounts that, in the time of the Emperor Decius, Anatolia and Victoria were sisters whose marriage was arranged to two noble, non-Christian Roman men. They resisted matrimony and their prospective grooms denounced them as Christians. They received permission to imprison the women on their estates and convince them to renounce their faith. Anatolia's suitor, Titus Aurelius, gave up, and handed her back to the authorities. Victoria‚Äôs suitor, Eugenius, was more persistent, but also ended up returning her to the authorities. Deaths Victoria‚Äôs legend states that she was stabbed through the heart in 250 AD at Trebula Mutuesca (today Monteleone Sabino). An elaboration on her legend states that her murderer was immediately struck with leprosy, and died six days later. Anatolia was killed, also in 250 AD, at \\"Thora\\" (identified with present-day Sant'Anatolia di Borgorose). Her legend states that she was at first locked up with a poisonous snake. The snake refused to bite her, and a soldier named Audax was sent into her cell to kill her. The snake attacked him instead, but Anatolia saved him from the snake. Impressed by her example, he converted to Christianity and was martyred by the sword with her. Spread of cult The Abbey of Farfa. Due to the translation of their relics, their cult spread across Italy. Some relics of Saint Victoria were transferred in 827 by Abbot Peter of Farfa from the Abbey to Mount Matenano in the Picene area (roughly the south of Le Marche) because the Abbey was besieged by \\"Saracens\\". The town of Santa Vittoria in Matenano is named after her. Ratfredus, a later Abbot of Farfa, brought the body from Farfa to Santa Vittoria in Matenano on 20 June 931. The bodies of Anatolia and Audax were transferred by Abbot Leo to Subiaco around 950. At an unknown date, a scapula of Anatolia was translated to the present-day Sant'Anatolia di Borgorose and an arm of the saint was translated to the present-day Esanatoglia. The bodies of Anatolia and Audax still rest at Subiaco in the basilica of Santa Scholastica, under the altar of the sacrament. her feast day was actually 9 July. A simulacrum and other relics of Saint Victoria are currently on display at the Santa Maria della Vittoria church in Rome. St Mary's Cathedral, Kilkenny, Ireland also claims to hold St Victoria's body, preserved in wax, along with a chalice containing some of her blood. These were supposedely sent to Kilkenny in 1845 by Pope Gregory XVI.

It consists of the settlements of Friedrichslohra, Gro√üwenden, Kleinwenden, as well as M√ºnchenlohra with its former convent basilica St. Gangulphus and castle Lohra with its accompanying manor (Amt Lohra), all of which were united in 1950. Geography Castle Lohra overlooks the gap between the D√ºn and Hainleite ridges, being situated on the northwesternmost spur of the latter. Historically, it guarded an important connection between M√ºhlhausen and the Halle-Kassel trade route in the Wipper valley, whose current incarnation is the Bundesautobahn 38. It was also a strategically important vantage point overlooking the plains between Hainleite and Harz. History The double chapel at castle Lohra, consisting of two separate prayer rooms on the upper and lower floor The site of castle Lohra had presumably already been fortified in Germanic times, being named after a possible nearby sanctuary to the goddess Lare. The complex was extended by the counts of Lare in the 11th and 12th centuries who constructed the largest castle in the southwestern foothills of the Harz mountains. The castle had varying owners until the 17th century, belonging to the counts of Lare, Beichlingen and Hohnstein. After the extinction of the latter family in 1593, the castle was to be inherited by the counts of Stolberg and Schwarzburg due to an arrangement between these families and the Hohnsteins, but was forcibly taken by the duke of Braunschweig. During the Thirty Years War, control of the castle changed several times. At the time of the Peace of Westphalia, it was occupied by the Swedes, but given to the electors of Brandenburg. In later times, the castle had lost its military significance and served as an agricultural domain in Prussia, the German Empire and the German Democratic Republic until 1977. Today, it is held by a non-profit organisation which rents the residential quarters to tourist groups and oversees the conservation and restoration of the castle. A special architectural feature is the double chapel, containing a chapel for public services on the lower floor and an additional oratory for private worship of the ruling family on the upper floor. The basilica of Saint Gangulphus in M√ºnchenlohra, northeastern view The names of Gro√üwenden and Kleinwenden point to originally Wendish settlements. M√ºnchenlohra was originally the domain of the convent of St. Gangulphus, centered on the Romanesque basilica constructed in the 12th century. The convent harboured Benedictine and Augustine nuns until it was dissolved and secularized in the aftermath of the Protestant Reformation in 1546. Initial restoration of the basilica was undertaken by the Prussian state in the 19th century and is further maintained until the present day. Friedrichslohra was a settlement initiated under the reign of Frederick II of Prussia. In the 18th and 19th century, several projects for the forced sedentarization of local Sinti were undertaken, including a short-lived forced labour and education house.

Early and family life Born in Litchfield, New York, Underwood graduated from Hamilton College in 1832, and was a founding member of Alpha Delta Phi. Underwood traveled to what was then western Virginia after graduation and taught children of the Jackson family in Clarksburg for two years. He then returned to New York to read law and began a private legal practice, which he continued in New York and Virginia from 1839 to 1856. On October 21, 1839, in Fauquier County, Virginia, Underwood married Maria Gloria Jackson, one of his former pupils. She was a granddaughter of Edward B. Jackson (whose brother John G. Jackson and great- nephew John Jay Jackson Jr. were also federal judges); her cousin (on both sides) Stonewall Jackson became a distinguished Confederate general. The Underwoods farmed in Herkimer County, New York, for about a decade. They had two daughters and a son, Edward J. Underwood (1842‚Äì1907), before moving to Clarke County, Virginia, near Maria's family.Patricia Hickin, \\"John C. Underwood and the Antislavery Movement in Virginia, 1847-60,\\" The Virginia Magazine of History and Biography, Vol. 73, No. 2 (Apr., 1965), p. 157. Politics and abolition Underwood had been a Whig, but as that party was disintegrating, he joined the Liberty Party in the 1840s because of his anti- slavery views. He unsuccessfully ran for United States Representative and then district attorney in 1847. He joined the Free Soil Party in 1848 and in the following year moved with his young family back to Virginia. Underwood hoped that successful operation of a dairy farm and cheesemaking factory in adjoining Clarke and Fauquier counties would show the superiority of using free, rather than slave, labor. When the Republican Party was being formed, Underwood became one of its first supporters in Virginia, and in 1856 he traveled to the party's convention in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, where John C. Fremont was nominated for United States President.Richard G. Lowe, \\"The Republican Party in Antebellum Virginia, 1856‚Äì1860,\\" Virginia Magazine of History and Biography 81 (1973): 259‚Äì279. Underwood's vigorous campaign for Fremont, the Republican Party, and abolitionism led to his receiving death threats, so in 1857 he temporarily left Virginia for New York and wrote of his persecution in an account published in The New York Times.\\"Proscription in Virginia, Letter from John C. Underwood,\\" New York Times, Jan or Feb. 6, 1857 Underwood became Secretary of the Emigrant Aid and Homestead Society (which he incorporated with Massachusetts congressman Eli Thayer) from 1856 to 1861. He worked to encourage the migration of Republicans and European emigrants to the Ohio Valley counties of Virginia. (These counties would become West Virginia when Virginia seceded from the Union in 1861.) His efforts met with little success and then vanished completely in October 1859 in the aftermath of John Brown's raid on Harper's Ferry, when the Black Horse Cavalry searched and confiscated the Underwoods' Virginia property by order of Governor Henry A. Wise. Only Maria and the children lived there at the time; Underwood had been permitted to return only temporarily to settle his affairs after giving his pro-Fremont speech.Little Falls Journal and Courier clipping at p. 267 of Vol. II of John C. Underwood papers in the Library of Congress. The Wheeling Daily Intelligencer, which Underwood supported financially, became the most influential Republican paper in any major slaveholding state. In 1860, Underwood was a delegate to the Republican Convention in Chicago, Illinois that selected Abraham Lincoln as its candidate. He campaigned for Lincoln in border states, and on October 17, 1860, made possibly the only speech in favor of that Republican candidate in Virginia, in Bellton, (now West Virginia). The New York Tribune published that endorsement speech, which extolled the superiority of free over slave labor, about a week later. Proposed diplomatic post In 1861, although the Senate approved Underwood's appointment to the position of United States Consul at Callao, Peru, Underwood declined the post, accepting instead the office of fifth auditor in the United States Department of the Treasury, a position in which he served from 1861 to 1864, under Treasury secretary Salmon P. Chase. He lived in Alexandria, Virginia, and Washington, D.C., for the rest of his life. Federal judicial service Underwood received a recess appointment from President Abraham Lincoln on March 27, 1863, to a seat on the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia vacated by Judge James Dandridge Halyburton. He was nominated to the same position by President Lincoln on January 5, 1864. He was confirmed by the United States Senate on January 25, 1864, and received his commission the same day. Underwood was reassigned by operation of law to the United States District Court for the District of Virginia on June 11, 1864, to a new seat authorized by 13 Stat. 124. Underwood was reassigned by operation of law to the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia on February 3, 1871, to a new seat authorized by 16 Stat. 403. His service terminated on December 7, 1873, due to his death. =Judicial tenure= In this position, in May 1866, Underwood presided over the grand jury that indicted Confederate president Jefferson Davis for treason, and later denied him bail because he was in the custody of military authorities. Later, however, Underwood allowed Davis's Northern supporters to post a $100,000 bond, and released him from custody in May 1867 (after delivering a long and vituperative speech). Underwood also presided over a grand jury in Norfolk that indicted Confederate General Robert E. Lee on June 7, 1865, but General Ulysses Grant and other federal government officials ignored the indictment as contrary to the surrender terms at Appomattox Courthouse. Salmon P. Chase, who by that time had become Chief Justice of the United States Supreme Court, reportedly worried that after Underwood had testified before Congress (the Joint Committee on Reconstruction) about being able to pack a jury, he was incapable of conducting politically sensitive trials of the former Confederate leaders. Other government officials apparently concurred, and failed to press the prosecutions. Early in the American Civil War, Underwood affirmed the right of the United States government to confiscate wartime enemy property under the Confiscation Act of 1862. His strong views on confiscation policy (what some called \\"retributive justice\\") put him at odds with the Supreme Court by 1869, and generated intense controversy in Virginia.Daniel W. Hamilton, \\"A New Right to Property: Civil War Confiscation in the Reconstruction Supreme Court,\\" Journal of Supreme Court History, Vol. 29, No. 3 (2004), pp. 270-274. Underwood's court confiscated more Confederate property than any other in the nation. Although Congress had stated its intention that confiscation only punish supporters of the rebellion and not their heirs, Underwood sought to eliminate the slaveholding class. In 1869, the United States Supreme Court ruled in Bigelow v. Forrest,76 U.S. 339; 9 Wall. 339 (1869) rejecting Judge Underwood's interpretation that the law only required that the confiscation and sale be completed during the lifetime of the former rebel. In 1870, in McVeigh v. United States,78 U.S. 259, 11 Wall 259 (1870) the same Supreme Court held that the federal legal proceeding had to prove that the owner supported the rebellion (the judge's declaration that such occurred was not enough) and that the contesting property owner could appear through counsel and a writ, although physically behind rebel lines in Richmond at the time the confiscation began. Then the Virginia Court of Appeals in Underwood v. McVeigh,23 Gratt. 409, 418, 64 Va. 409, 418 overturned the transaction in which Underwood's wife Maria, through attorney Samuel F. Beach, had bought McVeigh's property. In 1865, Underwood was elected to replace retiring United States Senator John S. Carlile by the rump Virginia legislature in session at Alexandria, but was not admitted to his seat (nor was his colleague Joseph Segar), since many Senators did not want to set a precedent for allowing premature reentry of Confederate states into the Union. Because Underwood had not resigned from the bench in contemplation of that service, his lifetime federal judicial tenure continued. The Virginia House of Delegates requested in February 1866 that Underwood relinquish that federal commission after his testimony against former Confederates before the federal Joint Committee on Reconstruction the previous month, but he refused. Underwood continued his highly critical and public remarks against former Confederates and their sympathizers, who had regained power in the state, and in favor of African American suffrage. He published a letter that he wrote to Thomas Bayne, a prominent African American politician in Norfolk, in October 1865, in which he endorsed full African American citizenship and suffrage. The previous year, Underwood had criticized Virginia laws that prohibited African Americans from testifying in court. In December 1866, the Union League of Norfolk petitioned Congress to replace Virginia's military governor Francis H. Pierpont with Underwood. In May 1867 Underwood was responsible for recruiting a jury of 12 African-American and 12 Anglo-American men in preparation for the abortive trial for treason of Jefferson Davis. Davis' best defense was that he had renounced his United States citizenship and thus could not commit treason against the United States. Trial for major crimes such as treason at the time required two judges, both the United States District Judge for the geographic area (Davis was held at Fort Monroe in Virginia) and the United States Supreme Court justice responsible for that circuit. Former abolitionist and United States Treasury secretary Salmon P. Chase had become Chief Justice of the United States Supreme Court in 1864, and thus responsible for the 4th Circuit, which included Virginia. In part because of his presidential ambitions (and movement toward the Democratic Party), Chase tried to avoid the trial, including by simply not showing up. When the 14th Amendment to the United States Constitution passed in 1868, Chase invited Davis' lawyer to a private conference and explained his theory that Section 3 of the new Amendment prohibited further punishment of former Confederates. When Davis' lawyer repeated this in open court, Chase dismissed the case against Davis, over Underwood's objection, and the government chose not to appeal the dismissal to the United States Supreme Court. Davis thus became a free man. Underwood Constitutional Convention Underwood also served as one of 5 delegates from Henrico County (Richmond, although he did not live in either the city or county), at the Virginia Constitutional Convention of 1868, the first legislative body in the Commonwealth's history to include African-American delegates (20 served). Fellow delegates elected him their president and James W. Hunnicutt of Fredericksburg as chairman of the suffrage committee.Allen W. Moger, Virginia: Bourbonism toByrd: 1870-1925 (Charlottesville: University of Virginia Press, 1968) p. 6 At the convention (held December 3, 1867, through April 17, 1868), Judge Underwood dominated the convention. Some were uncomfortable with his conduct as de facto political boss of Virginia, especially his seeming sale of political offices in exchange for political contributions to the local Republican party. Furthermore, Underwood and later the convention proposed to give the right to vote to black citizens as well as women, and he also advocated that schools be open to all regardless of color. Many whites detested Negro suffrage, and in a three day meeting in December 1868 in Richmond, formed the Conservative Party of Virginia to oppose the new Constitution being drafted by the Underwood Convention. Alexander H.H. Stuart of Staunton became their leader, assisted by a nine-man central committee (all from Richmond) and a 35-member Executive Committee.Moger pp. 7-8 Nonetheless, the convention ultimately did its work and passed what became the first Virginia constitution to grant suffrage to all males older than 21. It also established (and funded) universal public education, and provided for judges to be elected by the General Assembly rather than directly by voters. Moreover, it reorganized Virginia's county government to resemble that of New England townships, with more elected officials and voting by ballot rather than voice. However, the convention's proposed continuation of restrictions on voting rights of Confederate veterans proved extremely controversial, especially since Virginia's voters would elect a Governor, legislators and other state officials in 1869 if military rule ended. The radical Republicans selected former New Yorker Henry H. Wells as their gubernatorial candidate and the Conservatives nominated Robert E. Withers (both of whom later withdrew). Occupying General John M. Schofield cooperated with Stuart and William Mahone and issued an order delaying the constitution's ratification vote, fearing the effects of such white disenfranchisement.Moger p. 8 After a Committee of Nine (Virginia's Conservative political leaders), as well as Conservative Republicans Gilbert C. Walker of Norfolk and Franklin Stearns of Richmond negotiated with President Grant and influential Congressmen, it was separately voted upon and excluded from the eventually adopted state constitution, which voters adopted by referendum on July 9, 1869 by a 210,585 to 9,136 margin. This allowed Virginians to abandon the rump constitution of 1864, and elect a legislature including some African-American delegates by year's end. Ultimately, Conservative Gilbert C. Walker was elected to a full term, defeating, and Radical Republican Wells (who lost the popular vote). The provisional governor then resigned, allowing Walker's appointment as provisional governor until his elected term began. The constitution's passage also allowed Virginia to once again send congressmen and senators to serve on the federal level. This constitution (which remained in effect for three decades, until disenfranchisement of black voters in 1902) is often referred to as the \\"Underwood Constitution.\\" At the Convention, Underwood was almost alone in promoting women's suffrage. On May 6, 1870, he and Maria were among those helping Richmond resident Anna Whitehead Bodeker organize the short- lived Virginia State Woman Suffrage Association. Maria Underwood received an invitation to the Seneca Falls organizing convention, which occurred only a few months after her husband's death.Underwood file at Library of Congress; also includes correspondence from Elizabeth Cady Stanton. Final years Judge Underwood continued to promote rights of African Americans through his judicial office, but was again overruled by the Chief Justice Chase (as Circuit Justice) in Cesar Griffin's Case, in which he had freed a black man who was sentenced for assault in Rockbridge County by a local judge who was a former delegate to the Confederate General Assembly. Furthermore, in Robert Stevens v. Richmond, Fredericksburg, and Potomac Railroad, Judge Underwood charged the jury that racial segregation on railroad cars barbaric. President Grant nominated former Confederate and unsuccessful candidate for Virginia governor, Robert William Hughes as his successor. Unlike Judge Underwood, Hughes failed to protect the rights of African Americans in the developing Jim Crow legal culture. Death and legacy Underwood Family Grave Underwood died in 1873 of a seizure in Washington, D.C., where he spent the winter months. He is buried in the Congressional Cemetery in Washington, D.C., as are his wife, son Edward, daughter Alice and her husband (Alexander Cameron Hunt, former Territorial Governor of Colorado replaced by President Grant after his inauguration). Harriet Beecher Stowe published a eulogy of Underwood in the Christian Union on January 7, 1874, and the Washington Evening Star on December 8 and Washington New National Era and Citizen on December 18, 1873 also published favorable obituary notices. However, many Virginia newspapers condemned him and Readjuster leader William Mahone, making their names the most reviled in the state for decades. Despite his residence and business in Clarke County well before the Civil War, he was labelled a carpetbagger. After her husband's death, Maria Underwood never again set foot in Virginia, but resided at 1446 Rhode Island Avenue in the District of Columbia during her final years, and attended the Methodist church of Rev. Nailor. The gravestone is inscribed, \\"Nor ever shall he be in praise by wise and good forsaken Named softly, as the household name of one whom God has taken\\" and on the reverse \\"A quiet bed harbored where none can be misled wronged or distrest, and surely here it may be said that such are blest.\\"[sic] The Constitution which Underwood helped draft and considered his legacy was amended in November 1872 (with its usery clause stricken), and again in 1874 (capitation tax imposed), 1876 (office and electoral qualifications changed), 1882 (capitation tax stricken) and 1894 (criminal trial changes).William H.

Now a museum open to the general public, this house was built 1861-65 as part of the model farm that eventually became Iowa State. It was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1964 for its association with agriculturist and teacher Seaman A. Knapp and with U.S. Secretary of Agriculture James Wilson, both of whom lived here while teaching at Iowa State.Blanche Higgins Schroer and Ray H. Mattison (May 1975) , National Park Service. Description and history The Farm House is located near the center of the Iowa State campus, on the west side of Farmhouse Lane. It is a three-story structure, built primarily out of brick, and set on a stone foundation. The brick walls, fashioned out of locally sourced clay, were clad in limestone stucco in 1909 because they were crumbling. The interior is largely reflective of a major remodeling conducted about the same time. In 1972 the university undertook a major restoration of the building to restore it to its c. 1910 appearance. The land for what became Iowa State was donated by Story County farmers in 1858 and 1859, and the farm was developed over the following five years, slowed by the ongoing American Civil War. Iowa Agricultural College opened on the farm in 1869. In 1880 Seaman Knapp was appointed farm superintendent and professor of practical and experimental agriculture. Knapp would later become influential in the promotion of modern rice-growing practices in the American South. In 1891 James Wilson moved into the house, which he would occupy until 1897, when he is offered the post of United States Secretary of Agriculture, a post he would hold for thirteen years. The house was occupied for much of the first half of the 20th century by Professor Charles F. Curtiss, under whose tenure the house's major alterations were made. In 1948 the house was converted into a dormitory for women, and its plant was updated again. In 1970 Dean Floyd Andre, whose family occupied it since 1950, moved out. Andre's lobbying to preserve the building from demolition succeeded, and it was opened as the Farm House Museum in 1976.

Early proprietary implementations might also run a simple SIP infrastructure, too. The GSM Association calls it \\"Video Share\\". The peer-to- peer video sharing functionality is defined by the Phase 1 of the GSMA Video Share service. For a more detailed description of the full GSMA Video Share service, please see the Wikipedia entry for Video Share. The most basic form is typically connected to a classical circuit-switched (CS) telephone call. While talking on the CS line the speaker can start in parallel a multimedia IMS session. The session is normally a video stream, with audio being optional (since there is an audio session already open on the CS domain). It is also possible to share photos or files. Actually, P2P video sharing does not require a full IMS implementation. It could work with a pure IETF Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) infrastructure and simple HTTP Digest authentication. However, mobile operators may want to use it without username/password provisioning and the related frauds problems. One possible solution is the Early IMS Authentication method. In the future USIM/ISIM based authentication could be introduced, too. So the IMS adds up extra security and management features that are normally required by a mobile operator by default.  Early implementation by Nokia  The early Nokia implementation requires the manual setting of an attribute in the phone book. When the video session is triggered (by simply pulling down the back-side camera cover on a 6680), the video sharing client looks up the destination URI based on the MSISDN number of the B party of the current open CS voice call. The video sharing is possible only if this number has a valid entry in the phone book and a valid URI for the SIP call. However, this method is not really scalable, since the user has to enter very complex strings into the phone book manually. Because this service does not involve any application server, it is difficult to make a good business model for it. Usually, the first commercial services were based on the idea that video sharing will increase the length of the voice sessions, and the resulting increased revenue would be enough to cover the costs of the video sharing service.  History  The P2P video sharing was introduced in 2004 by Nokia. Two major operators started commercial implementations: \\"Turbo Call\\" http://www.tim.it/consumer/c366/i56102/o683_684/servizio.do Service description at TIM (in Italian) from Telecom Italia Mobile (TIM) in Italy and Telecomunica√ß√µes M√≥veis Nacionais, SA (TMN) in Portugal. The first handsets to support P2P video sharing were the Nokia 6630 and 6680. The 6680 is especially suited for turning on the video sharing by having a slider on top of the back- side camera. Later the Nokia N70 was added to the commercially supported handsets.  Popularity  TIM Italy reported about 10% penetration (based on the potentially available customers with appropriate handsets).

The anti-nuclear movement in the United States consists of more than 80 anti-nuclear groups that oppose nuclear power, nuclear weapons, and/or uranium mining. These have included the Abalone Alliance, Clamshell Alliance, Committee for Nuclear Responsibility, Nevada Desert Experience, Nuclear Information and Resource Service, Physicians for Social Responsibility, Plowshares Movement, Women Strike for Peace, and Women's International League for Peace and Freedom. The anti-nuclear movement has delayed construction or halted commitments to build some new nuclear plants, and has pressured the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to enforce and strengthen the safety regulations for nuclear power plants.Jerry Brown and Rinaldo Brutoco (1997). Profiles in Power: The Anti- nuclear movement and the Dawn of the Solar Age, p. 198. Anti-nuclear protests reached a peak in the 1970s and 1980s and grew out of the environmental movement.Herbert P. Kitschelt. Political Opportunity and Political Protest: Anti-Nuclear Movements in Four Democracies British Journal of Political Science, Vol. 16, No. 1, 1986, p. 62. Campaigns that captured national public attention involved the Calvert Cliffs Nuclear Power Plant, Seabrook Station Nuclear Power Plant (by the Clamshell Alliance), Diablo Canyon Power Plant, Shoreham Nuclear Power Plant, and Three Mile Island.Giugni, Marco (2004). Social Protest and Policy Change: Ecology, Antinuclear, and Peace Movements p. 44. Beginning in the 1980s, many anti-nuclear power activists began shifting their interest, by joining the rapidly growing Nuclear Freeze campaign, and the primary concern about nuclear hazards in the US changed from the problems of nuclear power plants to the prospects of nuclear war. On June 3, 1981, the White House Peace Vigil began and has continued day and night ever since, thanks to William Thomas (activist) and a small band of stalwart antinuclear activists who launched the \\"Proposition One Campaign for a Nuclear-Free Future\\" voter initiative in 1993 which led to a bill that has been introduced into the House of Representatives every session by Eleanor Holmes Norton. On June 12, 1982, one million people demonstrated in New York City's Central Park against nuclear weapons and for an end to the cold war arms race. It was the largest anti-nuclear protest and the largest political demonstration in American history.Jonathan Schell. The Spirit of June 12 The Nation, July 2, 2007.1982 ‚Äì a million people march in New York City International Day of Nuclear Disarmament protests were held on June 20, 1983, at 50 sites across the United States. There were many Nevada Desert Experience protests and peace camps at the Nevada Test Site during the 1980s and 1990s. More recent campaigning by anti-nuclear groups has related to several nuclear power plants including the Enrico Fermi Nuclear Power Plant,Fermi 3 opposition takes legal action to block new nuclear reactor Indian Point Energy Center, Oyster Creek Nuclear Generating Station,Oyster Creek's time is up, residents tell board Examiner, June 28, 2007.

Emergence of the movement =Emergence of the anti-nuclear weapons movement= Map of major U.S. nuclear weapons infrastructure sites during the Cold War and into the present. Places with grayed-out names are no longer functioning and are in various stages of environmental remediation. Women Strike for Peace during the Cuban Missile Crisis in 1962. On November 1, 1961, at the height of the Cold War, about 50,000 women brought together by Women Strike for Peace marched in 60 cities in the United States to demonstrate against nuclear weapons. It was the largest national women's peace protest of the 20th century. This view of downtown Las Vegas shows a mushroom cloud in the background. Scenes such as this were typical during the 1950s. From 1951 to 1962 the government conducted 100 atmospheric tests at the nearby Nevada Test Site. The nuclear debate initially was about nuclear weapons policy, and began within the scientific community. Scientific concern about the adverse health effects arising from atmospheric nuclear weapons testing first emerged in 1954.Wolfgang Rudig (1990). Anti-nuclear Movements: A World Survey of Opposition to Nuclear Energy, Longman, p. 55. Professional associations such as the Federation of Atomic Scientists and the Pugwash Conference on Science and World Affairs were involved. The National Committee for a Sane Nuclear Policy was formed in November 1957, and surveys showed rising public uneasiness about the nuclear arms race‚Äîespecially atmospheric nuclear weapons tests that sent radioactive fallout around the globe.Lawrence S. Wittner. Preserving the Golden Rule as a Piece of Anti-Nuclear History History News Network, 8 February 2010. In 1962, Linus Pauling won the Nobel Peace Prize for his work to stop the atmospheric testing of nuclear weapons, and the \\"Ban the Bomb\\" movement spread throughout the United States.Jerry Brown and Rinaldo Brutoco (1997). Profiles in Power: The Anti-nuclear Movement and the Dawn of the Solar Age, Twayne Publishers, pp. 191‚Äì192. Between 1945 and 1992, the United States maintained a program of vigorous nuclear weapons testing. A total of 1,054 nuclear tests and two nuclear attacks were conducted, with over 900 of them at the Nevada Test Site, and ten on miscellaneous sites in the United States (Alaska, Colorado, Mississippi, and New Mexico).Carey Sublette, Gallery of U.S. Nuclear Tests Until November 1962, the vast majority of the U.S. tests were above-ground; after the acceptance of the Partial Test Ban Treaty all testing was relegated underground, in order to prevent the dispersion of nuclear fallout. The U.S. program of atmospheric nuclear testing exposed some people to the hazards of fallout. Since the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act of 1990, more than $1.38 billion in compensation has been approved. The money is going to people who took part in the tests, notably at the Nevada Test Site, and to others exposed to the radiation.What governments offer to victims of nuclear tests The Associated Press, March 24, 2009. =Emergence of the anti-nuclear power movement= President Jimmy Carter leaving Three Mile Island for Middletown, Pennsylvania, April 1, 1979 Unexpectedly high costs in the nuclear weapons program, along with competition with the Soviet Union and a desire to spread democracy through the world, created \\"...pressure on federal officials to develop a civilian nuclear power industry that could help justify the government's considerable expenditures.\\"John Byrne and Steven M. Hoffman (1996). Governing the Atom: The Politics of Risk, Transaction Publishers, p. 136. The Atomic Energy Act of 1954 encouraged private corporations to build nuclear reactors and a significant learning phase followed with many early partial core meltdowns and accidents at experimental reactors and research facilities. This led to the introduction of the Price-Anderson Act in 1957, which was, \\"...an implicit admission that nuclear power provided risks that producers were unwilling to assume without federal backing.\\"Benjamin K. Sovacool. The costs of failure: A preliminary assessment of major energy accidents, 1907‚Äì2007, Energy Policy 36 (2008), p. 1808. The Price-Anderson Act \\"...shields nuclear utilities, vendors and suppliers against liability claims in the event of a catastrophic accident by imposing an upper limit on private sector liability.\\" Without such protection, private companies were unwilling to become involved. No other technology in the history of American industry has enjoyed such continuing blanket protection. The first U.S. reactor to face public opposition was Fermi 1 in 1957. It was built approximately 30 miles from Detroit and there was opposition from the United Auto Workers Union.Michael D. Mehta (2005). Risky business: nuclear power and public protest in Canada Lexington Books, p. 35. Pacific Gas & Electric planned to build the first commercially viable nuclear power plant in the US at Bodega Bay, north of San Francisco. The proposal was controversial and conflict with local citizens began in 1958.Paula Garb. Review of Critical Masses, Journal of Political Ecology, Vol 6, 1999. The proposed plant site was close to the San Andreas fault and the region's environmentally sensitive fishing and dairy industries. The Sierra Club became actively involved in the controversy.Thomas Raymond Wellock (1998). Critical Masses: Opposition to Nuclear Power in California, 1958‚Äì1978, The University of Wisconsin Press, pp. 27‚Äì28. The conflict ended in 1964, with the forced abandonment of plans for the Bodega Bay power plant. Historian Thomas Wellock traces the birth of the anti-nuclear movement in the United States to the controversy over Bodega Bay. Attempts to build a nuclear power plant in Malibu were similar to those at Bodega Bay and were also abandoned. A small military test reactor exploded at the Stationary Low-Power Reactor Number One in Idaho Falls in January 1961, causing 3 fatalities. This was caused by a combination of dangerous reactor design plus either sabotage, operator error by experienced operators. A further partial meltdown at the Enrico Fermi Nuclear Generating Station in Michigan in 1966. In his 1963 book Change, Hope and the Bomb, David E. Lilienthal criticized nuclear developments, particularly the nuclear industry's failure to address the nuclear waste question. He argued that it would be \\"...particularly irresponsible to go ahead with the construction of full scale nuclear power plants without a safe method of nuclear waste disposal having been demonstrated.\\" However, Lilienthal stopped short of a blanket rejection of nuclear power. His view was that a more cautious approach was necessary.Wolfgang Rudig (1990). Anti-nuclear Movements: A World Survey of Opposition to Nuclear Energy, Longman, p. 61. Samuel Walker, in his book Three Mile Island: A Nuclear Crisis in Historical Perspective, explains that the growth of the nuclear industry in the U.S. occurred as the environmental movement was being formed. Environmentalists saw the advantages of nuclear power in reducing air pollution, but became critical of nuclear technology on other grounds. The view that nuclear power was better for the environment than conventional fuels was partially undermined in the late 1960s when major controversy erupted over the effects of waste heat from nuclear plants on water quality. The nuclear industry \\"...gradually and reluctantly took action to reduce thermal pollution by building cooling towers or ponds for plants on inland waterways.\\"Walker, J. Samuel (2004). Three Mile Island: A Nuclear Crisis in Historical Perspective (Berkeley: University of California Press), p. 10. Several scientists, including John Gofman and Arthur Tamplin, challenged the prevailing view that the small amounts of radioactivity released by nuclear power plants during normal operation were not a problem. They argued \\"...that the routine releases were a severe threat to public health and could cause tens of thousands of deaths from cancer each year.\\" Exchange of views about radiation risks caused uneasiness about nuclear power, especially among those unable to evaluate the conflicting claims. The large size of nuclear plants ordered during the late 1960s raised new safety questions and created fears of a severe reactor accident that would send large quantities of radioactivity into the environment. In the early 1970s, a highly contentious debate over the performance of emergency core cooling systems in nuclear plants, designed to prevent a core meltdown that could lead to the \\"China syndrome\\", received coverage in the popular media and technical journals.Walker, J. Samuel (2004). Three Mile Island: A Nuclear Crisis in Historical Perspective (Berkeley: University of California Press), pp. 10‚Äì11.Wolfgang Rudig (1990). Anti-nuclear Movements: A World Survey of Opposition to Nuclear Energy, Longman, pp. 66‚Äì67. The emergency core cooling systems controversy opened up whether the AECs first priority was promotion of the nuclear industry or protection of public health and safety.John Byrne and Steven M. Hoffman (1996). Governing the Atom: The Politics of Risk, Transaction Publishers, p. 144. By the early 1970s, anti-nuclear activity had increased dramatically in conjunction with concerns about nuclear safety and criticisms of a policy-making process that allowed little voice for these concerns. Initially scattered and organized at the local level, opposition to nuclear power became a national movement by the mid-1970s when such groups as the Sierra Club, Friends of the Earth, Natural Resources Defense Council, Union of Concerned Scientists, and Critical Mass became involved.John Byrne and Steven M. Hoffman (1996). Governing the Atom: The Politics of Risk, Transaction Publishers, p. 205. With the rise of environmentalism in the 1970s, the anti-nuclear movement grew substantially: > In 1975‚Äì76, ballot initiatives to control or halt the growth of nuclear > power were introduced in eight western states. Although they enjoyed little > success at the polls, the controls they sought to impose were sometimes > adopted in part by state legislature, most notably in California. > Interventions in plant licensing proceedings increased, often focusing on > technical issues related to safety. This widespread popular ferment kept the > issue before the public and contributed to growing public skepticism about > nuclear power. Another major area of ongoing concern was nuclear waste management. The absence of a working waste management facility became an important issue by the mid-1970s: > In 1976, the California Energy Commission announced that it would not > approve any more nuclear plants unless the utilities could specify fuel and > waste disposal costs, an impossible task without decision on reprocessing, > spent fuel storage and waste disposal. By the late 1970s, over thirty states > had passed legislation regulating various activities associated with nuclear > waste.John Byrne and Steven M. Hoffman (1996). Governing the Atom: The > Politics of Risk, Transaction Publishers, p. 219. Many technologies and materials associated with the creation of a nuclear power program have a dual-use capability, in that they can be used to make nuclear weapons if a country chooses to do so. In 1975 over 2,000 prominent scientists signed a Declaration on Nuclear Power, prepared by the Union of Concerned Scientists, warning of the dangers of nuclear proliferation and urging the President and Congress to suspend the exportation of nuclear power to other countries, and reduce domestic construction until major problems were resolved. Theodore Taylor, a former nuclear weapons designer, explained, \\"...the ease with which nuclear bombs could be manufactured if fissionable material was available.\\" In 1976, four nuclear engineers -three from GE and one from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission- resigned, stating that nuclear power was not as safe as their superiors were claiming.Jim Falk (1982). Global Fission: The Battle Over Nuclear Power, Oxford University Press, p. 95. These men were engineers who had spent most of their working life building reactors, and their defection galvanized anti-nuclear groups across the country.The San Jose Three TIME, Feb. 16, 1976. They testified to the Joint Committee on Atomic Energy that: > the cumulative effect of all design defects and deficiencies in the design, > construction and operations of nuclear power plants makes a nuclear power > plant accident, in our opinion, a certain event. The only question is when, > and where.Mark Hertsgaard (1983). Nuclear Inc. The Men and Money Behind > Nuclear Energy, Pantheon Books, New York, p. 72. These issues, together with a series of other environmental, technical, and public health questions, made nuclear power the source of acute controversy. Public support, which was strong in the early 1960s, had been shaken. Forbes, in the September 1975 issue, reported that \\"the anti-nuclear coalition has been remarkably successful ... [and] has certainly slowed the expansion of nuclear power.\\" By the mid-1970s anti-nuclear activism, fueled by dissenting experts, had moved beyond local protests and politics to gain a wider appeal and influence. Although it lacked a single coordinating organization, and did not have uniform goals, it emerged as a movement sharply focused on opposing nuclear power, and the movement's efforts gained a great deal of national attention. On March 28, 1979, equipment failures and operator error contributed to loss of coolant and a partial core meltdown at the Three Mile Island Nuclear Power Plant in Pennsylvania. The World Nuclear Association has stated that cleanup of the damaged nuclear reactor system at TMI-2 took nearly 12 years and cost approximately US $973 million.World Nuclear Association. Three Mile Island Accident January 2010. Benjamin K. Sovacool, in his 2007 preliminary assessment of major energy accidents, estimated that the TMI accident caused a total of $2.4 billion in property damages.Benjamin K. Sovacool. The costs of failure: A preliminary assessment of major energy accidents, 1907‚Äì2007, Energy Policy 36 (2008), p. 1807. The health effects of the Three Mile Island accident are widely, but not universally, agreed to be very low level.Mangano, Joseph (2004). Three Mile Island: Health study meltdown, Bulletin of the atomic scientists, 60(5), pp. 31 -35. The accident triggered protests around the world.Mark Hertsgaard (1983). Nuclear Inc. The Men and Money Behind Nuclear Energy, Pantheon Books, New York, p. 95 & 97. The 1979 Three Mile Island accident inspired Perrow's book Normal Accidents, where a nuclear accident occurs, resulting from an unanticipated interaction of multiple failures in a complex system. TMI was an example of a normal accident because it was \\"...unexpected, incomprehensible, uncontrollable and unavoidable.\\"Perrow, C. (1982), 'The President's Commission and the Normal Accident', in Sils, D., Wolf, C. and Shelanski, V. (Eds), Accident at Three Mile Island: The Human Dimensions, Westview, Boulder, pp.173‚Äì184. > Perrow concluded that the failure at Three Mile Island was a consequence of > the system's immense complexity. Such modern high-risk systems, he realized, > were prone to failures however well they were managed. It was inevitable > that they would eventually suffer what he termed a 'normal accident'. > Therefore, he suggested, we might do better to contemplate a radical > redesign, or if that was not possible, to abandon such technology entirely. Nuclear power plants are a complex energy system.Storm van Leeuwen, Jan (2008). Nuclear power ‚Äì the energy balanceWolfgang Rudig (1990). Anti-nuclear Movements: A World Survey of Opposition to Nuclear Energy, Longman, p. 53 & p. 61. and opponents of nuclear power have criticized the sophistication and complexity of the technology. Helen Caldicott has said: \\"...in essence, a nuclear reactor is just a very sophisticated and dangerous way to boil water ‚Äì analogous to cutting a pound of butter with a chain saw.\\"Helen Caldicott (2006). Nuclear power is not the answer to global warming or anything else, Melbourne University Press, , p.xvii These critics of nuclear power advocate the use of energy conservation, efficient energy use, and appropriate renewable energy technologies to create our energy future.Southern Alliance for Clean Energy (undated). Why Nuclear is Risky Amory Lovins, from the Rocky Mountain Institute, has argued that centralized electricity systems with giant power plants are becoming obsolete. In their place are emerging \\"distributed resources\\"‚Äîsmaller, decentralized electricity supply sources (including efficiency) that are cheaper, cleaner, less risky, more flexible, and quicker to deploy. Such technologies are often called \\"soft energy technologies\\" and Lovins viewed their impacts as more gentle, pleasant, and manageable than hard energy technologies such as nuclear power.Amory B. Lovins (1977). Soft Energy Paths: Toward a Durable Peace, Penguin Books. Nuclear energy systems have a long stay time. The completion of the sequence of activities related to one commercial nuclear power station, from the start of construction through the safe disposal of its last radioactive waste, may take 100‚Äì150 years. =Emergence of the anti-uranium movement= The Church Rock uranium mill tailings dam breach. A 20-foot breach in the tailings dam formed around 5:30 am on the morning of July 16, 1979. Uranium mining is the process of extraction of uranium ore from the ground. A prominent use of uranium from mining is as fuel for nuclear power plants. After mining uranium ores, they are normally processed by grinding the ore materials to a uniform particle size and then treating the ore to extract the uranium by chemical leaching. The milling process commonly yields dry powder-form material consisting of natural uranium, \\"yellowcake\\", which is sold on the uranium market as U3O8, and uranium mining can use large amounts of water. The Church Rock uranium mill spill occurred in New Mexico on July 16, 1979, when United Nuclear Corporation's Church Rock uranium mill tailings disposal pond breached its dam. Over 1,000 tons of solid radioactive mill waste and 93 million gallons of acidic, radioactive tailings solution flowed into the Puerco River, and contaminants traveled downstream to Navajo County, Arizona and onto the Navajo Nation. The accident released more radioactivity than the Three Mile Island accident that occurred four months earlier and was the largest release of radioactive material in U.S. history.US Congress, House Committee on Interior and Insular Affairs, Subcommittee on Energy and the Environment. Mill Tailings Dam Break at Church Rock, New Mexico, 96th Cong, 1st Sess (October 22, 1979):19‚Äì24. Groundwater near the spill was contaminated and the Puerco rendered unusable by local residents, who were not immediately aware of the toxic danger. Despite efforts made in cleaning up uranium sites, significant problems stemming from the legacy of uranium development still exist today on the Navajo Nation and in the states of Utah, Colorado, New Mexico, and Arizona. Hundreds of abandoned mines have not been cleaned up and present environmental and health risks in many communities. The Environmental Protection Agency estimates that there are 4000 mines with documented uranium production, and another 15,000 locations with uranium occurrences in 14 western states,U.S. EPA, Radiation Protection, \\"Uranium Mining Waste\\" 30 August 2012 Web.4 December 2012, http://www.epa.gov/radiation/tenorm/uranium.html most found in the Four Corners area and Wyoming.Uranium Mining and Extraction Processes in the United States Figure 2.1.

Anti-uranium activists in the US include: Thomas Banyacya, Manuel Pino and Floyd Red Crow Westerman. Specific groups Anti-nuclear organizations oppose nuclear power, nuclear weapons, and/or uranium mining. More than eighty anti-nuclear groups operate, or have operated, in the United States. These include: *Abalone Alliance *Arms Control Association *Bailly Alliance *Beyond Nuclear *Clamshell Alliance *Committee for Nuclear Responsibility *Corporate Accountability International *Council for a Livable World *Critical Mass *Friends of the Earth *Greenpeace USA *Mothers for Peace *Musicians United for Safe Energy *NAU Against Uranium *Nevada Desert Experience *No Nukes group *Nuclear Age Peace Foundation *Nuclear Control Institute *Nuclear Information and Resource Service *Peace Action *Physicians for Social Responsibility *Plowshares Movement *Public Citizen *The Seneca Women's Encampment for a Future of Peace and Justice *Shad Alliance *Sierra Club *Three Mile Island Alert *Women Strike for Peace Logo of the Nuclear Information and Resource Service Members of Nevada Desert Experience hold a prayer vigil during the Easter period of 1982 at the entrance to the Nevada Test Site. Some of the most influential groups in the anti-nuclear movement have had some members who were elite scientists, including Nobel Laureates Linus Pauling and Hermann Joseph Muller. In the United States, these scientists have belonged primarily to three groups: the Union of Concerned Scientists, the Federation of American Scientists, and the Committee for Nuclear Responsibility.Jerome Price (1982). The Anti-nuclear Movement, Twayne Publishers, p. 65. Many American religious organizations have a long record of opposing nuclear weapons. Rejecting the development and use of nuclear weapons is \\"...one of the most widely shared convictions across faith traditions\\". In the 1980s religious groups organized large anti-nuclear protests involving hundreds of thousands of people, and specific groups involved included the Southern Baptist Convention, and the Episcopal Church. The Protestant, Catholic, and Jewish communities published explicitly anti-nuclear statements, and in 2000 Muslims also began to take a stance against nuclear weaponry.Susan Brooks Thistlethwaite. Let‚Äôs Take Religious Nuclear Opposition to the Next Level Center for American Progress, April 12, 2010. The platform adopted by the delegates of the Green Party (United States) at their annual Green Congress May 26‚Äì28, 2000, reflecting the majority views of the membership, included the creation of self-reproducing, renewable energy systems and use of federal investments, purchasing, mandates, and incentives to shut down nuclear power plants and phase out fossil fuels.Green Party USA (undated). The Greens/Green Party USA Recent campaigning by anti-nuclear groups has related to several nuclear power plants including the Enrico Fermi Nuclear Power Plant, Indian Point Energy Center, Oyster Creek Nuclear Generating Station, Pilgrim Nuclear Generating Station, Salem Nuclear Power Plant, and Vermont Yankee Nuclear Power Plant. There have also been campaigns relating to the Y-12 Nuclear Weapons Plant, the Idaho National Laboratory, proposed Yucca Mountain nuclear waste repository, the Hanford Site, the Nevada Test Site, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, and transportation of nuclear waste from the Los Alamos National Laboratory. Anti-nuclear protests Anti- nuclear protest in Boston, 1977 Anti-nuclear protest at Harrisburg in 1979, following the Three Mile Island accident White House Peace Vigil, the longest running peace vigil in US history, started by Thomas in 1981. U.S. and USSR/Russian nuclear weapons stockpiles, 1945‚Äì2005. Y-12 nuclear weapons plant entrance On November 1, 1961, at the height of the Cold War, about 50,000 women brought together by Women Strike for Peace marched in 60 cities in the United States to demonstrate against nuclear weapons. It was the largest national women's peace protest of the 20th century. There were many anti- nuclear protests in the United States which captured national public attention during the 1970s and 1980s. These included the well-known Clamshell Alliance protests at Seabrook Station Nuclear Power Plant and the Abalone Alliance protests at Diablo Canyon Nuclear Power Plant, where thousands of protesters were arrested. Other large protests followed the 1979 Three Mile Island accident. A large anti-nuclear demonstration was held in May 1979 in Washington, D.C., when 65,000 people including the Governor of California, attended a march and rally against nuclear power.Giugni, Marco (2004). Social Protest and Policy Change: Ecology, Antinuclear, and Peace Movements p. 45. In New York City on September 23, 1979, almost 200,000 people attended a protest against nuclear power. Anti-nuclear power protests preceded the shutdown of the Shoreham, Yankee Rowe, Millstone I, Rancho Seco, Maine Yankee, and about a dozen other nuclear power plants.Williams, Estha. Nuke Fight Nears Decisive Moment Valley Advocate, August 28, 2008. On June 3, 1981, Thomas launched the White House Peace Vigil in Washington, D.C. He was later joined on the vigil by anti-nuclear activists Concepcion Picciotto and Ellen Benjamin. On June 6, 1982, a crowd of 85,000 gathers at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, CA for \\"Peace Sunday: We Have a Dream\\" a rally and concert in support of the United Nations Special Session on Nuclear Disarmament. Performers include Joan Baez, Bob Dylan, Stevie Wonder and Crosby, Stills & Nash. On June 12, 1982, one million people demonstrated in New York City's Central Park against nuclear weapons and for an end to the cold war arms race. It was the largest anti-nuclear protest and the largest political demonstration in American history. International Day of Nuclear Disarmament protests were held on June 20, 1983, at 50 sites across the United States.Harvey Klehr. Far Left of Center: The American Radical Left Today Transaction Publishers, 1988, p. 150.1,400 Anti- nuclear protesters arrested Miami Herald, June 21, 1983. In 1986, hundreds of people walked from Los Angeles to Washington, D.C. in the Great Peace March for Global Nuclear Disarmament.Hundreds of Marchers Hit Washington in Finale of Nationwaide Peace March Gainesville Sun, November 16, 1986. There were many Nevada Desert Experience protests and peace camps at the Nevada Test Site during the 1980s and 1990s.Robert Lindsey. 438 Protesters are Arrested at Nevada Nuclear Test Site The New York Times, February 6, 1987.493 Arrested at Nevada Nuclear Test Site The New York Times, April 20, 1992. In the 1980s, when fewer nuclear power plants remained in the construction and licensing pipeline, and interest in energy policy as a national issue declined, many anti-nuclear activists switched their focus to nuclear weapons and the arms race.John Byrne and Steven M. Hoffman (1996). Governing the Atom: The Politics of Risk, Transaction Publishers, pp. 144‚Äì145. There has also been an institutionalization of the anti-nuclear movement, where the anti-nuclear movement carried its contests into less visible, and more specialized institutional areas, such as regulatory and licensing hearings, and legal challenges.Jerry Brown and Rinaldo Brutoco (1997). Profiles in Power: The Anti-nuclear movement and the Dawn of the Solar Age, pp. 195‚Äì199. At the state level, anti-nuclear groups were also successful in placing several anti- nuclear referendums on the ballot.Herbert P. Kitschelt.

Also in 2008 and 2009, there have been protests about several proposed nuclear reactors.Protest against nuclear reactor Chicago Tribune, October 16, 2008. People with anti- nuclear views =Al Gore= Former vice president Al Gore says he is not anti-nuclear, but has stated that the \\"...cost of the present generation of reactors is nearly prohibitive.\\" In his 2009 book, Our Choice, Gore argues that nuclear power was once \\"expected to provide virtually unlimited supplies of low-cost electricity\\", but the reality is that it has been \\"...an energy source in crisis for the last 30 years.\\" Worldwide growth in nuclear power has slowed in recent years, with no new reactors and an \\"actual decline in global capacity and output in 2008.\\" In the United States, \\"...no nuclear power plants ordered after 1972 have been built to completion.\\"Al Gore (2009). Our Choice, Bloomsbury, p. 152. > Of the 253 nuclear power reactors originally ordered in the United States > from 1953 to 2008, 48 percent were canceled, 11 percent were prematurely > shut down, 14 percent experienced at least a one-year-or-more outage, and 27 > percent are operating without having a year-plus outage. Thus, only about > one fourth of those ordered, or about half of those completed, are still > operating and have proved relatively reliable.Al Gore (2009). Our Choice, p. > 157. =Amory Lovins= In his 2005 book Winning the Oil Endgame, Amory Lovins praises nuclear power engineers, but is critical of the nuclear industry: > No vendor has made money selling power reactors. This is the greatest > failure of any enterprise in the industrial history of the world. We don't > mean that as a criticism of nuclear power's practitioners, on whose skill > and devotion we all continue to depend; the impressive operational > improvements in U.S. power reactors in recent years deserve great credit. It > is simply how technologies and markets evolved, despite the best intentions > and immense effort.

The range of competitors will only > continue to expand more and their costs to fall faster than any nuclear > technology can match.Lovins, Amory (2005). Winning the Oil Endgame p. 259. In 1988, Lovins argued that improving energy efficiency can simultaneously ameliorate greenhouse warming, reduce acid rain and air pollution, save money, and avoid the problems of nuclear power. Given the urgency of abating global warming, Lovins stated that we cannot afford to invest in nuclear power when those same dollars put into efficiency would displace far more carbon dioxide.Rocky Mountain Institute (1988). E88-31, Global Warming In \\"Nuclear Power: Climate Fix or Folly,\\" published in 2010, Lovins argued that expanded nuclear power \\"...does not represent a cost-effective solution to global warming and that investors would shun it were it not for generous government subsidies lubricated by intensive lobbying efforts.\\" =Joseph Romm= Joseph Romm contends that nuclear power generates about 20 percent of all U.S. electricity, and is a low-carbon source of around-the-clock power, which has received renewed interest in recent years.Romm, Joe (2008). The Self-Limiting Future of Nuclear Power p. 1. Yet, Romm says, nuclear power's \\"own myriad limitations will constrain its growth, especially in the near term\\", and the limitations include: *\\"Prohibitively high, and escalating, capital costs *Production bottlenecks in key components needed to build plants *Very long construction times *Concerns about uranium supplies and importation issues *Unresolved problems with availability and security of radioactive waste storage, which has a 100,000 year shelf life *Large-scale water use and contamination amid shortages *High electricity prices from new plants\\". =Randall Forsberg= Randall Forsberg (n√©e Watson, 1943‚Äì2007) became interested in arms control issues while working at the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute in the late 1960s and early 1970s. In 1974, she returned to the United States, and became a graduate student in international studies at Massachusetts Institute of Technology. In 1979, Forsberg wrote Call to Halt the Arms Race, which later was the manifesto of the Nuclear Weapons Freeze Campaign. The document advocated a bilateral halt to the testing, production, deployment and delivery of nuclear weapons. Forsberg was awarded a doctorate in 1980 and she started the Institute for Defense and Disarmament Studies, which became an important resource for the peace movement and anti- nuclear weapons movement. In 1983 Forsberg was awarded a MacArthur Foundation genius grant. In 2005 she became Spitzer Professorship in Political Science at the City College of New York, and died of cancer in 2007 when she was 64 years old. =Christopher Flavin= Many advocates of nuclear power argue that, given the urgency of doing something about climate change quickly, it must be pursued. Christopher Flavin, however, contends that speedy implementation is not one of nuclear power's strong points:Worldwatch Institute (2008). Building a Low-Carbon Economy in State of the World 2008, p. 81. > Planning, licensing, and constructing even a single nuclear plant typically > takes a decade or more, and plants frequently fail to meet completion > deadlines. Due to the dearth of orders in recent decades, the world > currently has very limited capacity to manufacture many of the critical > components of nuclear plants.

Given the urgency of the climate problem, Flavin emphasizes the rapid commercialization of renewable energy and efficient energy use: > Improved energy productivity and renewable energy are both available in > abundance‚Äîand new policies and technologies are rapidly making them more > economically competitive with fossil fuels. In combination, these energy > options represent the most robust alternative to the current energy system, > capable of providing the diverse array of energy services that a modern > economy requires.

Nuclear power regains support The Washington Post, November 24, 2009. Patrick Moore, one of the initial founders of Greenpeace, said in a 2008 interview that, \\"It wasn't until after I'd left Greenpeace and the climate change issue started coming to the forefront that I started rethinking energy policy in general and realized that I had been incorrect in my analysis of nuclear as being some kind of evil plot.\\" Bernard Cohen, Professor Emeritus of Physics at the University of Pittsburgh, calculates that nuclear power is many times safer than any other form of power generation. Critics of the movement point to independent studies showing the capital costs of renewable energy sources are higher than those from nuclear power.http://www.iea.org/Textbase/npsum/ElecCostSUM.pdf Critics argue that the amount of waste generated by nuclear power is very small, as all the high- level nuclear waste from 50+ years of operation of the world's nuclear reactors would fit into a single football field to the depth of five feet. Furthermore, U.S. coal power plants presently create nearly a million tons of low-level radioactive waste per day and therefore release more total radioactivity than the nation's nuclear plants,Hvistendahl, Mara. \\"Coal Ash Is More Radioactive than Nuclear Waste: Scientific American\\", Scientific American, Nature America, Inc., 13 Dec. 2007. Web. 18 Mar. 2011. due to the uranium and thorium found naturally within the coal. Nuclear proponents also point out that cost and the quantity of waste figures for the operation of nuclear power plants are commonly derived from nuclear reactors built using second generation designs, dating from the 1960s. Advanced reactor designs are estimated to be even cheaper to operate and generate less than 1% the amount of waste of current designs, like Integral Fast Reactors or Pebble Bed Reactors. It is because of these facts that proponents argue that nuclear fission power is the safest means currently available to entirely replace the use of fossil fuels, and pro-nuclear environmentalists argue that a combination of both nuclear energy and renewable energy would be the fastest, safest, and cheapest way forward. In 2007 Gwyneth Cravens outlined the message of her newest book, Power to Save the World: The Truth About Nuclear Energy. It argues for nuclear power as a safe energy source and an essential preventive of global warming. Pandora's Promise is a 2013 documentary film, directed by Robert Stone. It presents an argument that nuclear energy, typically feared by environmentalists, is in fact the only feasible way of meeting humanity's growing need for energy while also addressing the serious problem of climate change. The movie features several notable individuals (some of whom were once vehemently opposed to nuclear power, but who now speak in support of it), including: Stewart Brand, Gwyneth Cravens, Mark Lynas, Richard Rhodes and Michael Shellenberger. Anti-nuclear advocate Helen Caldicott appears briefly. As of 2014, the U.S. nuclear industry has begun a new lobbying effort, hiring three former senators‚ÄîEvan Bayh, a Democrat; Judd Gregg, a Republican; and Spencer Abraham, a Republican‚Äîas well as William M. Daley, a former staffer to President Obama. The initiative is called Nuclear Matters, and it has begun a newspaper advertising campaign. Recent developments As of early 2010, anti-nuclear groups such as Physicians for Social Responsibility, NukeFree.org, and NIRS were actively fighting federal loan guarantees for new nuclear plant construction. In February 2010, several groups coordinated a national call-in day to Congress to attempt to stop $54 billion in federal loan guarantees for new nuclear plants. However, the first such loan guarantee of $8.3 billion was offered to Southern Company that same month. In January 2010, about 175 anti-nuclear activists participated in a 126-mile walk in an effort to block the re-licensing of Vermont Yankee Nuclear Power Plant.Anti-nuclear protesters reach capitol Rutland Herald, January 14, 2010. In February 2010, numerous anti-nuclear activists and private citizens gathered in Montpelier, to be at hand as the Vermont Senate voted 26 to 4 against the \\"Public Good\\" certificate needed for continued operation of Vermont Yankee past 2012. In April 2010 a dozen environmental groups (including Friends of the Earth, South Carolina's Sierra Club, Nuclear Watch South, the Southern Alliance for Clean Energy, Georgia Women's Action for New Directions) stated that the proposed AP1000 reactor containment design is \\"...inherently less safe than current reactors.\\" Arnold Gundersen, a nuclear engineer, authored a 32-page report arguing that the new AP1000 reactors will be vulnerable to leaks caused by corrosion holes. There are plans to construct the Westinghouse AP1000 reactors at seven sites across the southeast, including Plant Vogtle in Burke County, Georgia.Rob Pavey. Groups say new Vogtle reactors need study Augusta Chronicle, April 21, 2010. In October 2010, Michael Mariotte, executive director of the Nuclear Information and Resource Service anti-nuclear group, predicted that the U.S. nuclear industry will not experience a nuclear renaissance, for the most simple of reasons: \\"nuclear reactors make no economic sense\\". The economic slump has driven down electricity demand and the price of competing energy sources, and Congress has failed to pass climate change legislation, making nuclear economics very difficult.Matthew L. Wald. Sluggish Economy Curtails Prospects for Building Nuclear Reactors, The New York Times, October 10, 2010. Governor-elect Peter Shumlin is a prominent opponent of the Vermont Yankee Nuclear Power Plant and two days after Shumlin was elected in November 2010, Entergy put the plant up for sale.Wald, Matthew L. (November 4, 2010). Vermont Nuclear Plant Up for Sale The New York Times. =Post-Fukushima= Following the 2011 Japanese Fukushima nuclear disaster, authorities shut down the nation's 54 nuclear power plants. As of 2013, the Fukushima site remains highly radioactive, with some 160,000 evacuees still living in temporary housing, and some land will be unfarmable for centuries. The difficult cleanup job will take 40 or more years, and cost tens of billions of dollars. Following the 2011 Japanese nuclear accidents, activists who were involved in the movement's emergence (such as Graham Nash and Paul Gunter), suggest that Japan's nuclear crisis may rekindle an anti-nuclear protest movement in the United States. The aim, they say, is \\"...not just to block the Obama administration's push for new nuclear construction, but to convince Americans that existing plants pose dangers.\\" In March 2011, 600 people gathered for a weekend protest outside the Vermont Yankee plant. The demonstration was held to show support for the thousands of Japanese people who are endangered by possible radiation from the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster. In April 2011, Rochelle Becker, executive director of the Alliance for Nuclear Responsibility said that the United States should review its nuclear accident liability limits, in the light of the economic impacts of the Fukushima disaster. The New England region has a long history of anti-nuclear activism and 75 people held a State House rally on April 6, 2011, to \\"protest the region's aging nuclear plants and the increasing stockpile of radioactive spent fuel rods at them.\\" The protest was held shortly before a State House hearing where legislators were scheduled to hear representatives of the region's three nuclear plants ‚Äì Pilgrim in Plymouth, Vermont Yankee in Vernon, and Seabrook in New Hampshire‚Äîtalk about the safety of their reactors in the light of the Japanese nuclear crisis. Vermont Yankee and Pilgrim have reactor designs similar to the crippled Japanese nuclear plants. As of April 2011, a total of 45 groups and individuals from across the nation are formally asking the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) to immediately suspend all licensing and other activities at 21 proposed nuclear reactor projects in 15 states until the NRC completes a thorough post- Fukushima reactor crisis examination. The petitioners also are asking the NRC to supplement its own investigation by establishing an independent commission comparable to that set up in the wake of the serious, though less severe, 1979 Three Mile Island accident. The petitioners include Public Citizen, Southern Alliance for Clean Energy, and San Luis Obispo Mothers for Peace. Thirty two years after the No Nukes concert in New York, on August 7, 2011, a Musicians United for Safe Energy benefit concert was held Mountain View, California, to raise money for MUSE and for Japanese tsunami/nuclear disaster relief. The show was powered off-grid and artists included Jackson Browne, Bonnie Raitt, John Hall, Graham Nash, David Crosby, Stephen Stills, Kitaro, Jason Mraz, Sweet Honey and the Rock, the Doobie Brothers, Tom Morello, and Jonathan Wilson. In February 2012, the United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission approved the construction of two additional reactors at the Vogtle Electric Generating Plant, the first reactors to be approved in over 30 years since the Three Mile Island accident, but NRC Chairman Gregory Jaczko cast a dissenting vote citing safety concerns stemming from Japan's 2011 Fukushima nuclear disaster, and saying \\"I cannot support issuing this license as if Fukushima never happened\\". One week after Southern received the license to begin major construction on the two new reactors, a dozen environmental and anti-nuclear groups are suing to stop the Plant Vogtle expansion project, saying \\"public safety and environmental problems since Japan's Fukushima Daiichi nuclear reactor accident have not been taken into account\\". The nuclear reactors to be built at Vogtle are new AP1000 third generation reactors, which are said to have safety improvements over older power reactors. However, John Ma, a senior structural engineer at the NRC, is concerned that some parts of the AP1000 steel skin are so brittle that the \\"impact energy\\" from a plane strike or storm driven projectile could shatter the wall. Edwin Lyman, a senior staff scientist at the Union of Concerned Scientists, is concerned about the strength of the steel containment vessel and the concrete shield building around the AP1000. Arnold Gundersen, a nuclear engineer commissioned by several anti-nuclear groups, released a report which explored a hazard associated with the possible rusting through of the steel liner of the containment structure.Matthew L. Wald. Critics Challenge Safety of New Reactor Design The New York Times, April 22, 2010. In March 2012, activists protested at San Onofre Nuclear Generating Station to mark the one-year anniversary of the nuclear meltdowns in Fukushima, Japan. Around 200 people rallied in San Onofre State Beach to listen to several speakers, including two Japanese residents who lived through the Fukushima meltdowns. Residents Organizing for Safe Environment and several other anti-nuclear energy organizations, organized the event and about 100 activists came in from San Diego. As of March 2012, 23 aging nuclear power plants continue to operate, including some similar in design to those that melted down in Fukushima, such as Vermont Yankee, and Indian Point 2 just 24 miles north of New York City. Vermont Yankee has reached the end of its projected lifetime operation but, despite strong local opposition, the NRC favored extending its license; however, on August 27, 2013, Entergy (VT Yankee's owner) announced it was decommissioning the plant and that \\"The station is expected to cease power production after its current fuel cycle and move to safe shutdown in the fourth quarter of 2014.\\" On March 22, 2012, \\"more than 1,000 people marched to the plant in protest, and about 130 engaging in civil disobedience were arrested\\". According to a 2012 Pew Research Center poll, 44 percent of Americans favor and 49 percent oppose the promotion of increased use of nuclear power, while 69 percent favor increasing federal funding for research on wind power, solar power, and hydrogen energy technology. In 2013, four aging, uncompetitive, reactors were permanently closed: San Onofre 2 and 3 in California, Crystal River 3 in Florida, and Kewaunee in Wisconsin. Vermont Yankee will close in 2014. New York State is seeking to close Indian Point Energy Center, in Buchanan, 30 miles from New York City. With reference to the pro-nuclear film Pandora's Promise, economics professor, John Quiggin, comments that it presents the environmental rationale for nuclear power, but that reviving nuclear power debates is a distraction, and the main problem with the nuclear option is that it is not economically viable. Quiggin says that we need more efficient energy use and more renewable energy commercialization.

Donaghadee is probably best known for its lighthouse and harbour. There has been a haven for ships at Donaghadee (locally known colloquially as the 'Dee') for centuries, and there has also existed a harbour since at least the 17th century.  Construction  Viscount Montgomery's harbour (1626; improved 1640), superseding what had hitherto been probably only a small jetty, was built and maintained as a result of the Royal Warrant of 1616 which limited travel between the Ards and the Rhins of Galloway to this port, and that at Portpatrick also owned by Montgomery. It was described by Harris in 1744 as 'a curving quay about long and wide built of uncemented stones'. It ran from the shore at the north end of the Parade in a broad arc, bent against the open sea, towards the southern end of the present north pier. Much patched and decrepit, the quay was virtually rebuilt, though along the original line, between 1775 and 1785 by the landlord, Daniel Delacherois, probably with the help of John Smeaton, the distinguished civil engineer who had apparently made earlier more elaborate plans for extending the harbour, and who had just rebuilt Portpatrick harbour. The old quay remained until after the completion of the new harbour, and then, despite its continued favour by local fishermen, was removed for local wall building about 1833. (It appears in the 1832 drawing but not on the first O.S. map of 1834). The foundation stone of the new harbour was laid by the Marquis of Downshire on 1 August 1821. The initial plans and surveys for this ambitious undertaking had been made by John Rennie Senior, the celebrated engineer whose works included Waterloo, Southwark and London Bridges over the Thames. However, he died within two months of beginning the work, and was succeeded by his son, John, later Sir John Rennie. He had as his resident engineer a fellow Scot, the seasoned marine builder, David Logan, who had assisted Robert Stevenson at the Bell Rock Lighthouse (1807‚Äì1810). The new harbour had to have greater depth to accommodate steam packets. Rock blasted from the sea bed, within the harbour area and further south in what became known as the Quarry Hole at Meetinghouse Point, was used to form the outer slopes of the two piers; but the inner faces were built of limestone from the Moelfre quarries of Anglesea. This 'Anglesea marble' lends itself to the finest ashlar dressing and the new piers remain a triumph of stone carving. The flights of steps display special skill in the deep diagonal binding of each solid step, providing a typically robust engineer's response to the wear of seaboots and waves alike. The harbour consists of two independent piers running north-westwards out to sea; parallel nearer the shore, they converge at the outer ends to form a harbour mouth wide. At low tide, the water in the harbour is fifteen feet deep.

Calka was awarded the Grand Prix de Rome in 1950. He was a professor at the √âcole nationale sup√©rieure des beaux-arts de Paris (ENSBA)-(National School of Fine Arts in Paris). He was a winner of a prize from the French architecture academy. During his lifetime two of his works achieved worldwide renown. The first, made of stone, is in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia and is ten metres high, a statue of the Lion of Judah, ordered by the Emperor Haile Selassie, who saw this as an opportunity to give a view of Africa entering modern times in 1955. This sculpture, easily identified by its silhouette, became a cultural symbol of Afrocentrism. His second piece is a molded plastic desk, the \\"Boomerang Desk\\" ‚Äì based on a polished stone and designed at the end of the sixties ‚Äì as a limited edition. This piece of furniture was the forerunner of the objects designed during the rest of the following decade. It has been presented in numerous publications and exhibitions. During his lifetime Calka created over fifty monumental pieces of work of all types, most created in his Paris workshop on Rue Raffet. His involvement in public art and the urban space led the sculptor to contribute to several architectural projects, fifteen of which were completed.  Biography  Lion of Judah Calka was raised in Lille, in northern France. He initially studied Engineering, but was attracted to Art, and entered the Lille School of Fine Arts at age 16, where he remained for three years. The director of the school at that time was Robert Mallet-Stevens, who noted Calka's ability, and gave him his first commission: a huge bas-relief for the press pavilion at the Lille Social Progress expo in 1939. Calka passed the Paris Fine Arts School's competitive examination. In 1942, after the Allies had retaken North Africa, he decided to join the Free French Forces of General Charles de Gaulle. He clandestinely crossed the Pyrenees and enlisted (Evad√©s de France, Miranda's camp). He remained in the military from 1942 to 1945, being demobilized at Speyer near the end of 1945. Calka returned to the study of sculpture at the Paris Fine-Arts school, under professors Marcel Gimond and Alfred Janniot. He won the Premier Grand Prix de Rome in 1950, which provided him the opportunity to work in the Villa M√©dicis for four years. While there he studied Urbanism. In 1954 Calka received his first large urban-art commission: he completed a stone Lion of Judah in front of the National Theater (Henri Chomette, architect) in Addis Ababa. The radical modernity of this sculpture was endorsed by Emperor Haile Selassie himself. Back in France, he worked with urbanist Robert Auzelle, completing several pieces for him such as a giant sculpture for Clamart cemetery (1957) (published in National Geographic) and a large sculpture for Joncherolle cemetery (1974) (published in \\"Concrete Quarterly\\" ‚Äì July/September 1977). Calka completed 47 works of Public Art, including sculptures, bas-reliefs, and polychromatic works. In 2004, a large metal bas-relief for the Church St Jean l'Evang√©liste of Dole which covers one wall of the building was completed from his designs. Calka was named \\"Patrimoine du XX si√®cle\\" by the Ministry of Culture (26 March 2007). Influence on Modern Art Boomerang Desk By the end of the 1960s Calka was deeply immersed in design, working with new materials (plastic and fiberglass). Of his work two results are of special note: the Boomerang Desk, and a monumental version, the PDG. An example of this desk sold for $480,000 at a 2008 art auction held by Christie's in New York City. Calka is considered a pioneer in the use of these new materials.L'utopie du tout Plastique, 1960‚Äì1973 / Philippe Decelle, Diane Hennebert, et Pierre Loze Other Calka works which have often been exhibited include \\"Les Ann√©es Pop\\"- Georges Pompidou Center, \\"Tomorrow-Now\\" ‚Äì Art Modern Museum Grand-Duc Jean, Luxembourg, etc. Calka has worked on several architecture projects: *Exp√©rimental chalet made of wood and fiberglass; Gerard Grandval architect, Rousseau engineer ‚Äì (La Plagne, 1970) *The H√¥tel de r√©gion of St Denis de la R√©union with Marc Van Nuwenborg (groupeIV) Architect -(La Reunion, 1985) *Cemetery of the city of Le Port ‚Äì (La Reunion, 1990) ; *Several education buildings in USA with Barry Svigals architect.

Dobson was born in Bradford to Scottish parents and around 1920 moved to London.  Family  Dobson was born in Bradford, Yorkshire, the second son of the Scottish portrait painter Henry John Dobson (1858‚Äì1928) and Jeannie Charlotte Hannah Cowan. Henry John Dobson was from St. John's Town of Dalry in Galloway and had painted, in 1893, the Labour leader James Keir Hardie. David's middle name which he used professionally derives from his mother's maiden name. His grandfather, Thomas Dobson, was a wool merchant in the town of Kirkcudbright. It is said in the family that there was a Dobson wool mill in Dalry, owned and run by Thomas. Henry John did not maintain the family tradition of running the family wool business, and instead became an artist. Family legend has it that Thomas Dobson disowned his son. Henry John's whole life would be marked by financial difficulties. The oldest child of the Dobson family was Thomas Stanley Dobson, born in 1892 and named after his grandfather. He was known as Stanley Dobson, and became an actor. To make ends meet, Stanley also worked for an art dealer in London. The only sister was Louisa Rankin Dobson (b. 1896), known as Louie. She had an intense family bond with her brothers, but mainly with her younger brother and fourth child, Henry Raeburn Dobson (1901‚Äì1985), for whom she cared lifelong. He was named after the eighteenth- century Scottish portrait painter, Sir Henry Raeburn (1756‚Äì1823), whom his father admired hugely. Henry Raeburn Dobson became a leading society portrait painter in Edinburgh and Brussels.  Life and work  Although he painted some fine portraits of well known men, like Earl Attlee, Earl Beatty and Harold Wilson, Dobson also portrayed \\"fashionable London ladies\\". Dobson was married to Phyllis Bowyer, who was the brains behind his financial success. She made Dobson one of London's leading society portrait painters. She herself sat for the photographer Alexander Bassano, the resulting portrait now being at the National Portrait Gallery, London. Dobson started his career in Scotland. He was educated at George Watson's College in Edinburgh and studied art in Edinburgh, London and Paris. In 1918 he was using his father's studio at Dalry. Around 1920 he moved to London and from then on he worked and resided mainly in London. Occasionally, he would work in and around Glasgow. He is said to have rented Kenmure Castle, in New Galloway, Kirkcudbrightshire, in the 1930s and 1940s to entertain and paint fashionable sitters. His older brother Thomas Stanley ran the castle as a hotel in the 1950s. Dobson mainly worked in oils but also painted some fine water-colour scenes. He painted in the tradition of the academic nineteenth century with mostly a rather darker colour scheme, while his brother Henry, influenced by the Modernist movement in Edinburgh, painted more colourful portraits. During World War I, Dobson was commissioned by the Royal Air Force section of the Imperial War Museum to paint portraits of three recipients of the Victoria Cross. Dobson painted portraits of Lt. Col. L.W. Brabazon Rees, Sgt Mottershead and Flight Lt. A.W. Beauchamps-Proctor. Dobson first exhibited at Royal Academy when aged only nineteen and began showing at the Royal Scottish Academy four years later. Dobson's works were also exhibited at the Royal Society of Arts, Royal Watercolour Society, Royal Society of Portrait Painters, Royal Society of British Artists, Royal Cambrian Academy, Fine Art Society and at the Walker Art Gallery in Liverpool.

His first full-time professional job was with the Jay McShann Orchestra where he became a featured performer. It was during this time that his vocal talents began to be recognized. He won fame as a \\"blues shouter\\", a singer whose voice was powerful enough, without microphone amplification, for an auditorium‚Äîeven with big bandaccompaniment. He also occasionally performed on trombone. In 1954, after five years with Jay McShann, Miller joined the Fletcher Henderson Reunion Orchestra. He became a popular performer in renowned jazz venues such as Birdland in New York, the Cotton Club in Chicago, and Detroit's Flame Showbar. It was with the Henderson Orchestra that \\"Big\\" did his first recording and it was in this period that his career really began to take off. He recorded for Savoy Records early in his career, including with The Five Pennies as backing musicians. His jazz activities also included work with Count Basie and Duke Ellington. As a vocalist, Miller first rose to national prominence at the 1958 Newport Jazz Festival where he appeared with a group led by trombonist Bob Brookmeyer. This led to a New York session with Brookmeyer's ensemble that was released on a well-reviewed LP, The Kansas City Sound, which has since been re-released on CD.\\"Kansas City Sound\\", Blue Sounds. After performing with John Hendricks's revue, The Evolution of the Blues, Miller signed with Columbia Records and released several full-length albums, including Big Miller Sings, Twists, Shouts and Preaches (1962).Vladimir, Bogdanov.

In the 1970s Miller toured with Big Joe Turner. Miller found himself stranded in Vancouver when one of his tours ran out of money. He travelled around Western Canada and in 1970 settled in Edmonton, Alberta.Eugene Chadbourne, [ Big Miller] at Allmusic. He became a Canadian citizen in 1973 and lived there for the rest of his life, working with local musician Tommy Banks, and covering \\"Big Yellow Taxi\\" with the song's composer, Saskatchewan-born Joni Mitchell. Miller played a major role in the growth of the Edmonton Jazz Society, which began in the late 1970s, and taught at the Banff Centre for Fine Arts. Miller helped to organize Edmonton's Jazz City Festival. He was the subject of a 1980 documentary \\"Big and the Blues\\", produced through the National Film Board of Canada. He had a short side career as an actor, appearing in Big Meat Eater (1982), A Name for Evil (1973), and a cameo in the comedy It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World. \\"Big\\" Miller died in 1992 in Edmonton at the age of 69, of a heart attack.Oliver, Myrna. \\"Clarence Miller; Singer With Jazz Groups\\", Los Angeles Times, June 11, 1992 Awards *1979 Juno Award ‚Äì Best Jazz album: Jazz Canada Montreux 1978 (Tommy Banks Big Band with Guest Big Miller) Legacy Tributes to Miller include a piano solo piece by Jay McShann entitled \\"Big Miller's Blues\\", and a track by the Canadian band Shuffle Demons called \\"Never Be the Same: Big Miller Blues\\".

His work centred on the Mi'kmaq people of Maritime Canada and he was the first to record the legend of Glooscap. Life Silas Rand was born in the community of Brooklyn Street about six miles west of Kentville, Nova Scotia in the Township of Cornwallis. He was a son of bricklayer Silas Rand and his wife Deborah Tupper. Though largely uneducated, his father taught the younger Rand to read and later sent him to school, which he attended until the age of 11. He then took up bricklaying with his father. At age nineteen, Rand was introduced to English grammar and he began the study of languages. By age 21, he began teaching grammar. At 23, he entered Horton Academy (part of Acadia University) to study Latin but he left the school a month later, learning Latin grammar at home while he worked as a bricklayer. In 1833 he underwent a religious conversion. He was baptized and decided to devote his life to God. In 1834 he was ordained a Baptist minister. He took a position in Liverpool, Nova Scotia where he met Jane Elizabeth McNutt, whom he married in 1838. The couple had twelve children. Rand was later a pastor in Windsor, Nova Scotia and Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island. In 1846 he was offered an opportunity to travel to Burma as a missionary, but he elected instead to work among the Mi'kmaq. He obtained the support of the Protestant evangelicals of Halifax and in 1849 helped found the Micmac Missionary Society, a full-time Mi'kmaq mission. Basing his work in Hantsport, Nova Scotia, where he lived from 1853 until his death, he travelled widely among Mi'kmaq communities, spreading the faith, learning the language, and recording examples of the Mi'kmaq oral tradition. He was poorly funded in his work, and had to resort to colportage, or begging to sustain his mission. By 1864 he decided to rely on unsolicited donations, trusting in faith to provide, and was thus expelled from the Society, which was dissolved, in 1870. After a long period of disagreement with the Baptist church, he eventually returned to the church in 1885. He died at Hantsport in 1889. Linguist Rand mastered many languages including Mi'kmaq, Maliseet, Mohawk, French, Italian, German, Spanish, Latin and modern Greek. In Maliseet he publisheded some Bible Selections in 1863 and the Gospel of John in 1870. In Mi'kmaq he produced the whole New Testament and the Old Testament books of Genesis, Exodus and Psalms. He compiled a Mi'kmaq dictionary and collected numerous legends, and through his published work, was the first to introduce the stories of Glooscap to the wider world. He also kept a diary. The diary was written primarily in Latin; it has not yet been translated or studied. Honours Late in his life, Rand's work with the Mi'kmaq was recognized with honorary degrees from Queen's University (L.L.D., 1886); Acadia College (D.D, 1886); and King's College (D.C.L.).

It is the oldest high school in the Peoria Unified School District and opened in 1919; its original building Old Main was constructed in 1922, renovated in 2014, and named a Historic Place in 2019. The school enrolls around 1,500 students, 10% of which participate in the school's Advanced Placement program. There are over 40 clubs on campus, as well as a strong athletics program.  History  Peoria High School was originally located in the back of a general store/post office combination and taught by a single teacher in 1919, but after a railroad was built in the city, a new building opened in 1922, enrolling 50 students. At its opening, the school, built in the Spanish Colonial Revival style, was the largest structure in town and contained period luxuries such as indoor plumbing. In the next few decades, the school was the only Arizonan high school to continue allowing Japanese American students to attend during World War II, while in 1962, it was the first in the area to allow African American students to participate in sports. The main building, Old Main, closed in 2008 for renovations, which would begin in 2012 and end in 2014, adding modernized classrooms, labs, and spaces, as well as a student lounge. After its reopening, the building also housed the district's non-traditional high school, the Peoria Flex Academy. The district's Medicine, Engineering, and Technology (MET) Academy shares the space with the Center, though the District acquired the Arizona Challenger Space Center building in 2017 with plans to move the Academy into the Space Center; by 2019, the District's board members voted to repurpose the center into an Arts Center where students from any high school may take specialized art classes. In 2019, Old Main was named to the National Register of Historic Places.  Enrollment  The school currently enrolls around 1,500 students, consisting of 51% male and 49% female students. The majority of students are Hispanic, with 55%, while 30% are White, 8% are Black, 3% are multiracial, 2% are Asian, 1% are Native American, and 0.3% are Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander. 70% of the students are minorities. 56% of the students are economically disadvantaged, a metric calculated from the number of students receiving free or reduced price lunches.  Academics  Peoria High School offers various academic tracks: basic, honors, and Advanced Placement (AP). The basic track allows a wide variety of classes with no added weight in GPA. The honors program offers a somewhat harder work load, countered by a weighting the grade point average differently. The Advanced Placement (AP) program offers college credit with the same grade weighting as an honors class. All students may take a mixture of basic, honors and AP if they wish. 10% of students participate in the AP program. Peoria High School's graduation rate is around 94%.

By discussing the various literary trends that were around in Russia between the revolutions of 1905 and 1917 Trotsky analyzed the concrete forces in society, both progressive as well as reactionary, that helped shape the consciousness of writers at the time. In the book, Trotsky also explained that since the dawn of civilization art had always borne the stamp of the ruling class and was primarily a vehicle that expressed its tastes and its sensibilities. Nonetheless, he went on to argue against the seemingly obvious conclusion that after a proletarian revolution the proletariat as a ruling class should, therefore, strive to create its own proletarian art as many at the time thought. To illustrate this he points out that the bourgeoisie as a class had time and resources to form its own culture way before the bourgeois revolutions in Europe in the 19th century while the proletariat by its position in society is deprived not only of culture but primarily the material means to attain it. Therefore, unlike previous revolutions in history the proletariat takes power not to install itself as a ruling class forever and hence create its own distinct culture but to create a society in which the existence of classes is materially impossible. Therefore, the task of the proletariat in power with respect to art after seeing to the more pressing needs of daily life (one must not forget Russia was a war-torn backward country) is to assimilate all the cultural achievements of the past and lay the foundations for a truly classless and human culture and art in the future. Trotsky's conviction of the heights human beings can reach once the fetters of oppression are thrown asunder is illustrated by the following quote from the book: Footnotes  Literature  * –ë–æ—Ä–µ–≤ –Æ. –≠—Å—Ç–µ—Ç–∏–∫–∞ –¢—Ä–æ—Ü–∫–æ–≥–æ (in Russian) // –õ–∏—Ç–µ—Ä–∞—Ç—É—Ä–∞ –∏ —Ä–µ–≤–æ–ª—é—Ü–∏—è / –õ. –¢—Ä–æ—Ü–∫–∏–π. ‚Äî –ø–µ—á–∞—Ç–∞–µ—Ç—Å—è –ø–æ –∏–∑–¥. 1923 –≥. ‚Äî –ú.: –ü–æ–ª–∏—Ç–∏–∑–¥–∞—Ç, 1991. ‚Äî 399 —Å. ‚Äî . * Thatcher I.

The purpose of feeding a TMR diet is that each cow can consume the required level of nutrients in each bite. A cow's ration should include good quality forages, a balance of grains and proteins, vitamins and minerals. By using a TMR diet, the operations can be divided into groups such as having at least three milk production groups, and one dry cow group. By being able to manage the TMR daily it provides healthy cows, increases in milk production and reproduction. The key to formulating TMR is maximized dry matter intake, which should be consistent with production and breed.  Advantages  The dairy farmer has more control over the feeding program. * Increased in milk production * Increased in reproduction activity * Healthy cows * Reduce the work load of feeding cows thus save in labor cost * gives you more of an ability to control the feed giving to certain cows *All forages, grains, protein supplements, minerals and vitamins are thoroughly mixed. Therefore, the cow can do very little sorting for individual ration ingredients. *Completely blended feeds, coupled with grouping the cows, permits greater flexibility in feeding exact amounts of nutrients (energy, protein, etc.) to more accurately feed cows for their particular stage of lactation and level of milk yield. *Grain mixtures can be liberally fed to grouped high producers without overfeeding the late-lactation or lower- producing cows, resulting in more efficient use of feeds.  Disadvantages  Cows should be grouped by production levels. *Grouping cows is not feasible in small herds (less than 50 cows). *Grouping cows is not easy if the cowshed cannot handle various numbers of cows in each group *If not grouped according to production, cows in late lactation are likely to get too fat. * Special equipment is needed. *The equipment must have the capability to thoroughly blend the feed ingredients. *The mixer-wagon, preferably mobile, must be capable of accurately weighing each ingredient.  Management  Cows generally sort through long particles in search of finer particles. This behaviour can cause problems such as subacute ruminal acidosis. Not only does it cause rumen problems, it also causes an effect on their NDF intake. The sorted diet contains more fermentable carbohydrates and less fiber thus not only creates problems for the cow's health but also wastes money and time for the provider. Therefore it is essential to have a balanced TMR diet. This can be achieved by harvesting the forage properly before ensiling. thus the silage and haylage should be chopped 3/8-3/4 in length. Forage that is too fine or too course should be avoided due to the cow's ability to sort. The number of groups of animals to be part of a TMR diet depend on existing herd size, the layout of barn, and loafing areas. typically a barn will have high, medium and low production lactating cows, far off and close up dry cows, and pre-breeding and post-breeding heifers. These groups are essential has some (such as first lactation cows) don't do well in overcrowded feed areas. When working with two or three groups it is easier as you can feed the low costing forage to the low group and the high quality forage to the higher group in which can obtain or increase the overall health and performance of cows. For dry cows this system can minimize metabolic and nutritional disorders in calving and post-partpartum period. A pre-breeding and post-breeding system is essential for heifers to ensure proper growth and development. It is important for pre-breeding heifers to have an energy- and protein-dense diet while post-breeding lack the ability to consume high forage diets.  Summary  Dairy cows eating a TMR *Complete rations feature the blended approach; all forages, concentrates, protein supplements, minerals and vitamins are mixed and offered as a single feed. *Complete-ration systems can save labour and reduce overall feeding costs. *It is extremely important to keep the mixture exactly the same day after day and to make big changes gradually. *Early detection of problems with the ration system is possible by observing the bulk tank milk level after each milking. *Forage analysis is necessary and should include dry matter, crude protein, acid detergent fiber, neutral detergent fiber, calcium and phosphorus. *TMR can be used effectively by many dairy farmers, but it is not a substitute for good management. In fact, the intensity of management may be increased. Most of all, management skills and competency of the dairy farmer are critical to make this system work effectively.Using a Total Mixed Ration for Dairy Cows References Category:Intensive farming Category:Cattle Category:Dairy farming ","title":"Total mixed ration"},{"id":"13635378","text":"Klek () is a village along the Adriatic Sea in southern Dalmatia, Croatia.

It sits on the Continental Divide in Silver Bow County, Montana, 10 miles south of Butte, Montana in Beaverhead-Deerlodge National Forest at an elevation of 6,453 ft (1,967 m). The Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul and Pacific Railroad (commonly known as the Milwaukee Road) used the pass for its crossing of the Continental Divide on its mainline between Chicago, Illinois and the Pacific Northwest. The line was built as part of the Milwaukee Road's Pacific Extension, which was completed in 1909. The railroad line cut under the pass via the 2,290 ft Pipestone Pass Tunnel at an elevation of 6,347 ft (1,935 m). The line was electrified in 1915 and served the Milwaukee Road's premium transcontinental passenger train, the Olympian (later the Olympian Hiawatha). A poor competitive position against the rival Burlington Northern Railroad and substantial losses caused the Milwaukee Road to abandon the line in 1980. Pipestone Pass was also used (without a tunnel) as the Continental Divide crossing for U.S. Highway 10, dating from 1926. This road is now designated as Montana Highway 2 and known locally as \\"The Harding Way\\", the name being coined in honor of President Warren G. Harding on the occasion of his visit to Butte.

He opened one of the first automobile dealerships in the United States, and participated in the early development of a number of early automobile companies, including the Cadillac Automobile Company and the E-M-F Company, in which the \\"M\\" stands for his name. Early life William Metzger was born in Peru, IL, in 1868.Robert Szudarek The first century of the Detroit Auto Show p.265. Society of Automotive Engineers Inc, Pennsylvania; at Google Books At the age of 10 he moved to Detroit with his father; he graduated from Detroit High School in 1885. He immediately got a job at Hudson & Symington furniture (owned by J. L. Hudson).The E-M-F Company: The Story of Automotive Pioneers Barney Everitt, William Metzger, and Walter Flanders by Anthony J Yanik, pub Society of Automotive Engineers, SAE (2001) , Viewable at Google Books As a young man, Metzger became enamored of bicycle riding, becoming the first vice president of Detroit's Wheelman's Club and finishing a number of 100-mile bicycle rides. Soon his hobby became his business: in 1891, Metzger joined Stanley B Huber to open Huber & Metzger, a bicycle shop located in the center of downtown Detroit. The store soon became one of the largest in the country, and dealt directly with suppliers in England. Automobiles and Cadillac In 1895, Metzger attended the world's first automobile show in London.Obituary from Time Magazine Impressed with what he saw, he went on to visit the factories of Gottlieb Daimler and Karl Benz, then the leading automobile manufacturers in the world (albeit with less than 200 each). He returned to Detroit convinced of the automobile's future, and immediately sold his share in Huber & Metzger. Metzger built the first U. S. automobile retail showroom, which opened 7 June, 1897, selling Waverley electric cars. The following year, Metzger added steamers, then gasoline- powered cars built by various companies. In 1899, Metzger started selling automobiles built by Oldsmobile; in June, Metzger sold the first automobile built by the company. Oldsmobile produced 4 1897 models, so Metzger couldn't have sold the first Oldsmobile unless it was one of the 1897 models. In 1899, Metzger helped organize the Detroit Auto Show, only the second of its kind. The next year, he helped stage the New York Auto Show in New York's Madison Square Garden. He was promoter & organizer of the first auto race in Detroit in 1901, at the Detroit Driving Club, a premier harness race track. It was an all-day affair, with over 8,000 spectators, and many races for different classes of cars, starting with a parade from downtown to the track. This was the race where Henry Ford beat Alexander Winton, a top racer and manufacturer of cars from Cleveland, with the Sweepstakes car, that was the prototype for Cadillac. A year later, in October 1902, he promoted a five-mile race, known as the Manufacturers' Challenge Cup, which was a planned Ford-Winton rematch. Despite a strong challenge from Winton, Barney Oldfield easily won with Ford‚Äôs 999, taking the $200 prize. It set a speed record at the Detroit Driving Club track, in Grosse Pointe Township, and went on to tour America, and score many other victories. Subsequent to this, Ford was finally able to draw in the backers to start his 3rd company, the modern day Ford Motor Company. In 1900, he organized the Northern Motor Car Co. Two years later, Metzger was one of the people who organized the Cadillac Motor Car Co. In 1903, with only three cars produced, Metzger took orders for 2700 cars at the New York Auto Show.E-M-F History The 1903 production of Cadillacs outstripped every other manufacture in the US save Oldsmobile. In 1905, Cadillac reorganized, merging with Leland & Faulconer; Metzger obtained 3000 shares of the merged company. Metzger stayed at Cadillac as sales manager until 1908, but was looking for new challenges. E-M-F In that year, Metzger acquired controlling interest in the Northern Automobile Co, and Northern merged with the Wayne Automobile Company, controlled by Byron Everitt and Walter E. Flanders, to form E-M-F (Everitt-Metzger-Flanders) Company. The company arranged for Studebaker to market their cars. In 1909, EMF-Studebaker produced almost 8000 cars, making it the fifth largest auto maker in the US. However, although E-M-F was growing (it would produce 26,000 automobiles in 1911, second only to Ford), Metzger was unhappy with the partnership with Studebaker. In mid-1909, Metzger left the company, taking Byron Everitt and a $362,500 settlement with him. With the money, Metzger and Everitt began the Metzger Motor Car Co, producing a car (called the Everitt) that was substantially similar to E-M-F's model. Metzger again used his sales skills, and the first year's production of 2500 Everitts were pre-sold before the first one rolled off the assembly line. With Everitt and Metzger gone, things were unsettled at E-M-F. Despite strong sales, infighting was rampant, and in 1912 Walter Flanders left, joining Metzger and Everitt. The three partners, together again, recapitalized their firm, renaming it the Flanders Motor Company. However, the new company was strapped for cash, and began failing almost immediately. In late 1912, Flanders financially juggled the company, selling Flanders to the United States Motor Company, and heading the new company. Metzger and Everitt, however, took their profits from the sale and left. Later years After the dissolution of Flanders, Metzger founded Columbia Motors as their vice president from 1917 to 1924. He also became affiliated with numerous other automotive companies including Wills Sainte Claire and Federal Motor Truck Co. He also was appointed to the executive committee of the American Automobile Association and was elected president of the Detroit Board of Fire Commissioners. In 1921, Everitt, Metzger, and Flanders reunited once again to produce the Rickenbacker (in partnership with Eddie Rickenbacker). However, the company never really got off the ground. Profits were low or nonexistent, and the company was dealt a blow by the death of Walter Flanders in an automobile accident in 1923. The company limped along for a few years, but in 1926 Rickenbacker, disgusted with the constant bickering, resigned. Other company officers left, and Rickenbacker Motors closed for good in 1927.Rickenbacker Club of America In the late 1920s, Metzger turned to aircraft. He had been a good friend of the Wright brothers, and felt the US needed more airplane manufacturing. In 1926, he helped Edward Stinson form the Stinson Aircraft Company. The next year, he organized the first All-American Aircraft Show in Detroit. In 1929, he organized the Cadillac Aircraft Co. The company built technically superior aircraft, but the onset of the Great Depression hurt the company. As the Great Depression started, William Metzger's health began to decline. He was incapacitated for four years and succumbed to heart attack on April 11, 1933.

Fern√≥s moved to Austin, Texas at age 17 to enroll in art school at the University of Texas at Austin. At the age of 18 he started the \\"SoftMen Show\\" above an alternative clothing store in Austin, Texas in the well-known music area known as Sixth Street. In 1994, Fern√≥s created a successful Public-access television cable TV how entitled \\"El Chow De Faustina,\\" which featured Fern√≥s in drag interviewing artists and musicians from the local area.Fern√≥s, Fausto. \\"VIDEO: El Chow de Faustina ‚Äì Pilot Episode ‚Äì How to Apply Makeup.\\" Feast of Fun October 25, 2011.

By 2005, Fern√≥s‚Äîwhose friend, video artist Kerthy Fix described as \\"a celebrity waiting for the technology to catch up with [him]\\"‚Äîand Felion aspired to take the show a step further by creating a cable access show; but at the same time, podcasting burst onto the scene with the promise of video podcasting in the near future. Taking a chance on the up-and-coming technology, they decided to embrace the new medium. In 2007, the website was overhauled and two new podcasts were added: \\"Show Me Now,\\" a video podcast; and \\"Mini Bites,\\" which featured short skits and sound bites that users could download and use as cellular phone ringtones. The original audio podcast was named \\"Gay Fun Show\\" to distinguish itself from the other, newer shows. In addition, a Community Forum was started which allowed listeners to create personal profiles and share stories and information with each other. In 2008, the video podcast was re-launched and renamed \\"Video Player,\\" which coincided with the launch of the Feast of Fools YouTube channel and another re-design of the main website. In 2009, the name of the show was changed to \\"Feast of Fun\\" to better reflect the show's content, which focuses on odd news stories, food and drink recipes, music, comedy and irreverent humor. The show intends to include both gay and straight community members who are open to GLBT-related subjects and topics. Also in 2009, a complete redesign of the website introduced new features, including \\"Fresh,\\" which gives listeners the ability to contribute stories, photos and original articles freely; and \\"What's Hot,\\" a summary of the most popular podcasts, topics and stories. In July, 2010, Feast of Fun featured interviews with a series of \\"Legendary Divas of Comedy\\": Cassandra Peterson, Carole Cook, Mink Stole and Carol Channing. In 2011, Feast of Fun converted to a subscriber-based system, called \\"Feast of Fun Plus+\\".

Putnam ‚Äì was acquired by the Union Navy during the first year of the American Civil War and outfitted as a gunboat and assigned to the Union blockade of the Confederate States of America. She also served as a tugboat and as a ship's tender when so required. A ship with two names The Navy purchased William G. Putnam, a wooden-hulled tug built in 1857 at Brooklyn, New York, on 24 July 1861 at New York City and renamed the vessel General Putnam soon thereafter. The vessel's name later returned to William G. Putnam while in the service of the U.S. Navy. Civil War service =Assigned to the Atlantic Blockading Squadron= On 13 September 1861, with Acting Master William J. Hotchkiss in command, William G. Putnam departed New York, bound for Washington, D.C., and arrived at the Washington Navy Yard three days later. On the night of the 17th, she headed down river to join the Potomac Flotilla but the next day was ordered to join the Atlantic Blockading Squadron at Old Point Comfort, Virginia, where she arrived on 23 September. Within a few days, the armed tug began operating off the North Carolina coast where her initial duty was to reconnoiter Ocracoke Inlet. She also patrolled off Hatteras Inlet and assisted in the sinking of three stone-laden schooners in an attempt to help tighten the blockade by impeding navigation and obstructing the inlets in the area. On 29 October 1861, the Navy Department divided the Atlantic Blockading Squadron into the North and South commands, and allocated William G. Putnam to the newly established North Atlantic Blockading Squadron. The vessel continued to operate primarily in the waters of North Carolina. =Capture of Roanoke Island= In February 1862, the tug took part in the expedition which captured Roanoke Island, North Carolina. On the 6th, the day before the battle began, the side-wheel gunboats and USS William G. Putnam steamed a mile or so ahead of the main force to reconnoiter and discovered fifteen steamers and ten sailing vessels close inshore between Pork Point and Weir's Point, above the marshes of Croatan Sound. The following day, the Union warships pressed their attack while the Union Army landed some 10,000 troops on Roanoke Island. William G. Putnam fired on a Confederate shore battery in an engagement that lasted all afternoon. The next morning, she resumed firing in company with and other Federal warships as they started to pass a cluster of vessels which had been sunk as obstructions. Although running aground at one point during the fight and suffering a hit on the hurricane deck, William G. Putnam emerged with no casualties from the heavy shelling by enemy guns. =Raising the Stars and Stripes over Cobb Point Battery= On the 10th, Ceres ran aground off Elizabeth City, North Carolina, during the battle of Elizabeth City, and William G. Putnam pulled her free. In addition, the armed tug attempted to put out a fire that raged in the Confederate armed schooner Black Warrior nearby. The blaze proved to be beyond control, but the Union gunboat did manage to pick up a man from the water as he swam from the burning ship. In the operation, Union warships captured the CSS Ellis; obstructed the passage to the Albemarle and Chesapeake Canal; and raised the stars and stripes over Cobb Point battery. Over the ensuing days William G. Putnam conducted daily reconnaissance in Currituck Sound and missions in the Albemarle & Chesapeake Canal. For the next six months, the gunboat carried detachments of Army troops and equipment on missions to search out and destroy rebel supply boats. While stationed at Plymouth or New Berne, the ship operated in the Pasquotank and Chowan rivers and the creeks of Dingaderry, Rochahock, and Seems. =Ordered to maintain a \\"strict and vigorous\\" blockade= Needing repairs, William G. Putnam, sailed for Hampton Roads and arrived there on 22 October with intelligence data for Rear Admiral Samuel P. Lee. On 6 November, the gunboat received orders to remain in Virginia waters and to maintain a > strict and vigorous\\" blockade of the western shore of the Chesapeake Bay > between Fortress Monroe and the south side of the Piankatank River. Proceeding to Yorktown, Virginia, the tug joined a small flotilla operating with the Army in an attempt to take Mathews Court House up the East River. Ordered to capture or destroy all Confederate vessels that could be used to run the Union blockade, William G. Putnam carried out her assignment until the successful completion of the campaign against Mathews Court House on 23 November 1862. =Repaired at Baltimore and returned to service= Subsequently, serving as guard vessel in the York River and off neighboring coasts, the tug cooperated with the Union Army in landing troops on expeditions up to West Point, Virginia, and enforced the blockade by patrolling the region until 15 January 1863. At that point her boilers broke down, and she was unable to move. Nevertheless, William G. Putnam remained on active service in those waters, stationed so as to enfilade Gloucester Point, until towed to Baltimore, Maryland, to receive a new boiler and rifle screening. The latter included iron plates placed around the forecastle, quarter deck, and wheelhouse. She returned to her station in June 1863, helping to blockade Chesapeake Bay and its tributaries. =The ship's master is shot dead= While operating in the Piankatank River on blockade duties on 17 August, William G. Putnam and the ex-ferryboats and sighted a schooner, a canoe, and a launch running the blockade. Men from the steamers manned two cutters, two boats, and a gig and gave chase but soon encountered heavy sniper fire from Confederate soldiers and guerrillas in the woods. William G. Putnam's commanding officer, Acting Master Hotchkiss fell mortally wounded in the first enemy volley, and the boats withdrew while returning fire. Acting Ensign William Jennings assumed command of William G. Putnam and the ship shelled the woods for about four miles as she dropped down river. Subsequently, towed to Yorktown, Virginia, William G. Putnam was stationed at the mouth of Queen's Creek, where she formed an indispensable part of the defense of Yorktown while Major General Foster erected a citadel there. By that time, the gunboat, with an \\"overweight boiler,\\" had become less useful for blockade duty; but she found profitable employment dragging for torpedoes (mines) near Yorktown. Acting Master Hugh H. Savage took command of the armed tug off Newport News, Virginia, on 16 November 1863 and proceeded up the Nansemond River in early December, where she later captured a large boat and destroyed a canoe used by Confederate forces in the area for running mail across the river. William G. Putnam remained on picket duty off the mouth of the Nansemond River to intercept blockade runners until 15 December, when she returned to Newport News. =Covering the landing of Union Army troops= In February and March 1864, she patrolled the Back River and the Poquoson River and joined an expedition on 8 March to head up the Mattaponi River, convoying Army transports. The armed tug covered the landing of General Kilpatrick's troops at Sheppard's Landing, two miles above West Point, before proceeding to the mouth of the Rappahannock River and ascending to a point five miles below Urbanna, Virginia. On 13 March, William G. Putnam returned to Yorktown and later resumed her patrols on the Back and Poquoson rivers. From mid-April 1864, William G. Putnam operated in joint Army-Navy operations in the James and Nansemond rivers, covering the landings of troops. She moved ahead of Union Army transports, dragging for torpedoes (mines) from Harrison's Bar to one mile above Bermuda Hundred, clearing a channel for the landing of troops at City Point and at Bermuda Hundred. She then operated with Brigadier General Charles K. Graham's gunboats, supporting the occupation of Fort Powhatan and Wilson's Wharf. William G. Putnam accompanied Army gunboats up the Appomattox River and anchored at Gilliam's Bar. She reconnoitered the river below the bar and, by order of Brigadier General Graham, towing the U.S. Army gunboat Charles Chamberlain down the channel. Informed that Confederate pickets had advanced in force as far as Gilliam's Bar, the Union flotilla retreated on 11 May to Point of Rocks and shelled the nearby woods. During the action, William G. Putnam discovered the Confederate battery at Fort Clifton, opened fire on enemy guns and soon obtained the range. The enemy battery replied, but a shell from the gunboat's 24-pdr. howitzer exploded in the embrasure of their rifled gun, causing the Confederate gunners to break and run. After that action, the Union steamer returned down river and engaged in further combat operations on the Appomattox River almost daily into June, remaining on guard against surprise attacks. Union forces repeated the attack upon Fort Clifton on 9 and 10 June, silencing the enemy battery. On 28 July 1864, Rear Admiral Lee assigned William G. Putnam to a division under the command of Captain Melancton Smith operating on the James River. The gunboat also served on the Appomattox River and in Mobjack Bay until March 1865, when she returned to Yorktown. Detached from the North Atlantic Blockading Squadron on 18 March 1865, she patrolled the Rappahannock and St. Mary's rivers. Post-war activity After the collapse of the Confederacy in April, the armed tug was ordered to the Washington Navy Yard with twenty-three other vessels from her division. William G. Putnam arrived there on 14 May and was decommissioned on 2 June 1865. The US Treasury Department bought her at auction for use by the Lighthouse Board, and as the tender General Putnam she was assigned to the 3rd Lighthouse District. Rammed and sunk after being assigned to the 2nd Lighthouse District, she was raised and repaired at a cost of $4,738 at Wilmington, Delaware. Reassigned to the 3rd Lighthouse District, her name was shortened to simply Putnam in September 1869. She was rebuilt and lengthened to 135 feet in 1877 prior to being transferred back to the 2nd Lighthouse District. Overhauled in New York in August 1880, Putnam rebuilt yet again in 1889 for $18,500. The Lighthouse Board transferred her to the 7th Lighthouse District in March 1891, based out of Key West, Florida. She was taken out of service in 1891 and sold in 1893 for $1,825. She then entered the merchant service as the SS Putnam, operating until 1896.

The railways were already considered to be Common Carriers and thus subject to the Carriers Act of 1830, but the 1854 Act placed additional obligations on the railways due to their monopoly status. Each railway company was now required to take all trade offered and to set and publish the same levels of fares to all in respect of any particular service. The Act marked a milestone in English law and has also served as the foundation of similar legislation in the United States. It is one of the Railway and Canal Traffic Acts 1854 to 1894.The Short Titles Act 1896, section 2(1) and Schedule 2  Historical context  The introduction of the railways from the 1830s onwards led to new possibilities for the transport of goods which previously had not been commonly carried at all. This led to the courts affording a certain degree of latitude to railway carriers, permitting them to make agreements for the purpose of protecting themselves against the new risks and dangers of carriage inherent to the goods they were transporting. It was not long before the railway companies were exploiting this new freedom, taking advantage of their dominance of the transport sector to impose stringent and often oppressive terms of business which limited their exposure to risk. The courts felt compelled to give effect to these agreements to which the parties to the contract had deliberately agreed unless there was evidence of fraud or illegality. As Sir Alexander Cockburn told the House of Lords in 1863: The 1854 Act therefore sought to put an end to this practice and reverse the jurisprudence in favour of railway operators, returning to the pre-railway age position where the courts were in the habit of construing contracts between individuals and carriers to the disadvantage of the latter. The Act was promoted by Edward Cardwell, the President of the Board of Trade and chairman of the Select committee responsible for the examination of the various amalgamation bills passing through Parliament. The Committee recommended that \\"Parliament should secure freedom and economy of transit from one end of the kingdom to the other and should compel railway companies to give the public the full advantage of convenient interchange from one railway system to another\\", and so came about the Railway and Canal Act 1854.  Main provisions  = Receiving and forwarding traffic without delay = An obligation was placed on railway and canal companies \\"to afford all reasonable facilities for the receiving and forwarding, and delivering of traffic\\" without delay to and from their railways and canals. This provision sought to put an end to the practice whereby an operator, taking advantage of the monopoly it enjoyed over the provision of services within its area, did not deal with all customers in a uniform manner, perhaps favouring some to the disadvantage of others. In a case decided in 1910, the Court of Appeal rejected a claim by Spillers that the Great Western Railway had breached this obligation when it refused to transport Spillers' loaded grain vans. According to Lord Justice Kennedy, the railway was only obliged to transport \\"merchandise\\", this being the only possible interpretation of \\"traffic\\". = No undue preference or prejudice = Railways and canal companies had to publish and set the same fares for any particular service, they could not discriminate between passengers or goods transporters by giving or offering \\"any undue or unreasonable preference or advantage\\" in respect of the services provided or, conversely, suffer prejudice by comparison with other users. = Continuous and unobstructed services = Transport services were to be provided \\"at all times\\" and without any \\"obstruction\\" to passengers or goods. This reinforced the idea that the railways and canals formed a special and important category of business services which were to be made freely available and, insofar as possible, permanently available. = Liability for loss and damage = Section 7 of the Act imposed liability on an operator for loss or injury to \\"horses, cattle or other animals\\", or to any \\"articles, goods or things\\" in the course of their carriage by the operator as a result of his \\"neglect or default\\". Where the operator had attempted to limit or exclude his liability for such loss in the contract for carriage, the exclusion clause would only operate where it was \\"just and reasonable\\". It would fall to the judge trying a case under the 1854 Act to determine whether the clause was just and reasonable. The damages recoverable from the operator were capped at ¬£50 for each horse, ¬£15 for any cattle per head and ¬£2 for each sheep or pig. It was however open to the customer to ask for the level of compensation to be raised by paying the excess of the increased amount. Although this provision prevented routine exclusions of liability for gross negligence, misconduct or fraud by operators, it did not disturb the protection afforded by section 1 of the Carriers Act 1830 (limitation of liability for the loss of certain goods above ¬£10), or abridge the right to contact out of strict liability. This provision is one of the first attempts by Parliament to introduce legislative controls on unfair terms in contracts. It requires the court trying the case to decide whether the clause in question is \\"just and reasonable\\". There followed a flurry of cases on the question of what exactly constituted just and reasonable and from there developed the so-called doctrine of the \\"fair alternative\\". The definitive judgment on the question was delivered by Justice Blackburn in Peek v The North Staffordshire Railway Company (1863) where he said that: In other words, a clause purporting to limit a railway company's liability would be considered invalid unless the customer was offered an inducement to agree to the clause in the shape of, for example, a reduction in the cost of freight. = Remedies for breach of the Act = Violation of the Act was a civil and not criminal matter and proceedings could be brought before the Court of Common Pleas (England and Wales), Her Majesty's Superior Courts (Ireland) or the Court of Session (Scotland). The court could issue an injunction (interdict in Scotland) and could order the payment of a fine not exceeding ¬£200.  Legacy  Sir William Hodges, a contemporary railway law commentator, welcomed the Parliament's attempt to regulate the carrying of freight and passengers on railways. He believed that \\"[t]he necessity of a supervision of some kind over the traffic on our railways has long been acknowledged and it was felt that it would be an intolerable abuse if the Queens' subjects were deprived (by the railways) of the protection which the crown formerly afforded them when travelling over the ancient highways. Moreover, it may be assumed that the need for rigorous control and supervision is even more necessary than formerly when before the railways there could be no monopoly of the means of conveyance.\\"Hodges, W., A treatise on the law of railways, railway companies, and railway investments;. with an appendix of statutes, forms, etc., Sixth Edition, Sweet, London, 1876. The 1854 Act proved, however, to be ineffectual in dealing with the problems posed by dominant railway companies. The requirement that clauses limiting liability should be just and reasonable was taken by the courts to mean that as long as the contract was made in a just and reasonable way, the result would be regarded as just and reasonable. To reach an agreement which would be considered as \\"just and reasonable\\", a carrier had just to offer a customer the option of purchasing insurance for negligence at a reduced cost. If the customer proceeded without this cover, he had no grounds for challenging the agreement. Judges considered that the availability of a fairly priced alternative to limited liability gave adequate protection against coercion on the part of the carrier. A Royal Commission was established in 1865 to investigate the charges imposed by the railway industry. This was followed up by another Select Committee inquiry led by Lord Carlingford, President of the Board of Trade, which proposed the creation of a \\"Railway and Canal Commission\\" to oversee the rail industry. The Committee noted that the Board of Trade was not \\"sufficiently judicial\\" to carry out this task, that the courts were insufficiently informed about the workings of the industry and that a Parliamentary Committee did not have the necessary permanence. The result was the Railway and Canal Traffic Act 1873 which created the Court of the Railway and Canal Commission to enforce the 1854 Act.  Repeal  The Act was repealed by Section 29 of the Transport Act 1962.

Aero Union P-3A Orion taking off from Fox Field, Lancaster, California The U.S. Forest Service airtanker scandal involved a scheme, called the Historical Aircraft Exchange Program, in which the agency would acquire retired U.S. Air Force C-130A transport aircraft and U.S. Navy P-3 anti-submarine patrol aircraft, ostensibly for use as firefighting airtankers, but which ended up with the planes' ownership being transferred illegally to private companies and the aircraft themselves being used for other purposes or even sold for a profit. The controversy resulted in two of the involved principals being sentenced to prison and a number of civil lawsuits. Background The U.S. Forest Service (USFS) had traditionally relied on contracting with private companies to provide large airtankers for fighting forest fires, the majority of which had been retired World War II and Korean War-era transports, bombers, and maritime patrol aircraft. Such aircraft were relatively inexpensive to obtain and could carry the large loads of fire retardant needed to make their use effective. In the 1980s, the bulk of the airtanker fleet consisted of C-119 Flying Boxcars which had been obtained from the military. After concerns about safety, the aging C-119s were grounded in 1987. Because the available airtanker fleet was substantially diminished, the Forest Service needed to obtain additional aircraft for firefighting operations.USA vs Fuchs, 218 F.3d 957 U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals, Appeal 9810173, filed July 6, 2000 Exchange scheme In December 1987, the director of Fire and Aviation Management for the USFS instructed Fred Fuchs, Deputy Director of Fire and Aviation, to request that the Department of Defense cooperate with civilian contractors in a plan to obtain surplus military transport aircraft stored at Davis-Monthan Air Force Base in Tucson, Arizona, which could be converted to airtankers. Besides replacing the grounded C-119s, this program was intended to modernize the tanker fleet to all-turbine aircraft.NTSB accident brief LAX02GA201 for N130HP At the time, Roy D. Reagan was a private aircraft broker representing Hemet Valley Flying Service, one of the Forest Service's contractors, and an operator of C-119s. At a meeting on December 23, 1987, attended by both Fuchs and Reagan, the Air Force was presented with the idea of transferring retired U.S. Air Force C-130As to the National Museum of the United States Air Force, which would then exchange the C-130As with Hemet Valley's grounded C-119s, since the latter aircraft could be considered \\"historic\\" aircraft. However, at a subsequent meeting with representatives of the Air Force Museum, Air Force officials reacted negatively to the idea of such an exchange. Fuchs and Reagan then met with representatives of the General Services Administration (GSA) who suggested that the exchanges be conducted without going through the Air Force Museum, and instead have the Forest Service become directly involved. In this version of the plan, the Air Force would declare that the aircraft were \\"excess property\\" and transfer them to GSA, who could then legally make the planes available to other government agencies, but with the provision that any agencies receiving them would be required to retain ownership. This plan was agreed upon, and Fuchs was given responsibility for coordinating the exchange program for the Forest Service. He did not, however, discuss the plan with the Forest Service's Office of General Counsel. The letter authorizing the program on behalf of the Forest Service stated that it complied with various provisions of the federal regulations, when in actuality it did not.The exchange agreements were supposedly made under authority of 41 CFR S 101-46.203; however, they were not authorized by that regulation, as the C-119s were not \\"historical items\\" as defined by 41 CFR S 101-46.001-4, and the C-130As and P-3s that were part of the program were obtained by the Forest Service solely for the purpose of exchange, a violation of 41 CFR S 101-46.202(b)(6). In addition, Fuchs provided bills of sale to the contractors, transferring actual ownership of the planes to the companies, in violation of the applicable regulations, as well as the provisions laid down by the GSA. Further, Fuchs told his USFS superiors that the transfer of ownership had been approved by the GSA when in fact it had not. In the ensuing criminal trial, three Air Force generals testified that they were not aware that the government would be losing title to the aircraft; if they had, they said, they would not have approved the program. Initially, four airtanker operators were represented by Reagan and participated in the exchange program: Hemet Valley Flying Service, Aero Union, TBM, Inc., and Hawkins and Powers. Because only a select number of contractors were provided aircraft, and because the program was not publicized nor were the contracts and aircraft put up for bid, accusations of favoritism followed. UH-19B at the Milestones of Flight Museum, Fox Field, Lancaster, California. This helicopter had been operated by T&G; Aviation under contract to the USFS hauling firefighters and performing bucket water drops. In 1989 it was exchanged for a C-130A. T&G; Aviation of Chandler, Arizona became aware of the program from one of its competitors (T&G; was operating eight older Douglas DC-7s at the time). Concerned that this gave its competitors an unfair advantage in obtaining Forest Service firefighting contracts, T&G; officials contacted Fuchs, who told them that no more aircraft were available. The company then contacted several congressmen for assistance, and eventually received three C-130s.International Air Response v. USA, U.S. Court of Federal Claims, No. 00-428C, June 1, 2001 In exchange, T&G; provided a DC-7B to the Pima Air & Space Museum, an SNB-5 to Planes of Fame and a UH-19B to the Milestones of Flight museum at Fox Field. The aircraft, ultimately 22 C-130As and six P-3s, ended up being distributed to six contractors. Twelve of the C-130s came from the \\"ready-reserve national air fleet\\" stored at Davis-Monthan Air Force Base in Tucson, Arizona, and 16 were retired from Air Force Reserve units and delivered to Pinal Airpark in Marana, Arizona, where they were processed out and transferred through the exchange program. As part of the deal, since Reagan acted as broker on behalf of the companies, he was paid a commission by them in the form of ownership of four of the C-130As, which he subsequently sold for personal profit. The contractors paid nothing for the aircraft, but agreed to perform the conversions and install the fire retardant dispersal equipment at their own cost. The operators then had to competitively bid for the contract at a low enough price to be awarded a year-long contract for fire suppression missions. Investigations and accusations =USDA and Forest Service= In 1989, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA, the parent department of the Forest Service) began to look at the exchange program, which was quietly terminated in January 1990, after the Assistant General Counsel of the USDA concluded that the USFS did not have authority to conduct the program. In 1993, Forest Service Chief Dale Robertson testified before a House subcommittee, stating, \\"This has been poorly managed by the Forest Service.\\" Fuchs was demoted in the Forest Service, and retired in 1996. =Gary Eitel= Gary Eitel, a pilot, aviation consultant and aircraft broker, found out about the program and contacted the Forest Service in 1991 to try to obtain C-130s for his clients, who had not been in on the initial deal. He was told by the agency that there were no more aircraft available, and that only three planes had been involved. Suspecting that he was not being told the truth, Eitel began his own investigation, obtaining documentation on the program through the Freedom of Information Act. Eitel took on the role of whistleblower, and reported his findings in testimony before several congressional subcommittee hearings. =Other federal investigations= As a result of Eitel's personal investigations, he filed several \\"hotline\\" complaints to the USDA and the Office of the U.S. Inspector General (OIG), leading to the initiation of a number of investigations. In 1992, the OIG determined that the USFS did not have the authority to make the aircraft exchanges. Federal auditors determined that most of the C-130s given to the contractors were not being used for firefighting, and that the C-119s which were traded in were essentially \\"junk\\". Between ten and eleven (depending on the source) of the C-130s were never even converted into airtankers. Agriculture Undersecretary Jim Lyons told the Los Angeles Times that some of the agency's actions were \\"clearly illegal\\" and \\"may have been criminal.\\" On March 3, 1994, the Department of Defense's assistant inspector general for criminal investigative policy and oversight asked the Justice Department (DoJ) to investigate the Forest Service and the program. In 1995, GSA auditors determined that the U.S. had lost money on the deal, based on comparisons of aircraft values. Besides these agency investigations, several congressional hearings were held to ferret out the facts of the convoluted program. According to one newspaper, there were \\"nine years of investigations involving more than a half-dozen federal agencies, at least three congressional inquiries, work by more than two dozen attorneys generating millions of dollars in fees and at least 12 state and federal trials.\\" =Values= Numerous accusations have related to the value of both the vintage airtankers that were being retired, and that of the surplus military aircraft being provided to the contractors. According to an investigation by the Los Angeles Times, some of the planes being traded in were of no historical significance and, due to their age, were only worth scrap value, as little as $10,000 per aircraft. The Forest Service contends, though, that 28 of the trade-ins ended up in museums across the country. On the other side of the deal, the surplus aircraft were also valued at scrap prices by the Forest Service for the purposes of the exchange, as little as $15,000 each. The Forest Service later put the value of each plane at between $750,000 and $1.5 million. The Inspector General, however, reported in 1992 that the aircraft were actually worth about $2.4 million each, with a resulting price tag of $67 million for the aircraft which were given to the contractors. The Forest Service has argued that if the aircraft had been actually sold to contractors for their full value, the U.S. tax payers ultimately would have footed the bill in terms of higher airtanker contract costs. The contractors paid for the costs of the conversions, about $500,000 per aircraft, and once they received the planes, they found that the program did not have provisions for providing spare parts to keep the fleet flying, and some of the surplus transports had costly turbine engines which had reached their life limits, and were therefore worthless and had to be replaced. =Firefighting deficiencies= One aspect which several investigations brought to the fore was the impact on firefighting efforts. An investigation into the July 1994 South Canyon fire in Colorado, which killed 14 firefighters, concluded that \\"Air support was inadequate for implementing strategies and tactics.\\" Eitel has alleged that the reason for inadequate air support was that the aircraft from the exchange program which should have been available to fire managers were instead doing non-fire related work, some of it secret, around the world. =Grand jury= As a result of the DoJ investigation, six years after the termination of the exchange program by the USDA, a grand jury indicted Fuchs and Reagan, charging each with one count of conspiracy and one count of converting U.S. property to the use of another. Besides the actual counts the two were charged with, the grand jury specified ten illegal or improper \\"overt acts\\" that the two defendants committed, including: *Misrepresenting Reagan's employment status (implying he was a representative of the Forest Service) to both the U.S. Air Force and the Navy *Misrepresenting the manner in which the government-owned aircraft were going to be provided to the private operators *Fuchs received flight time and a resulting upgrade to his personal pilot's license in the aircraft being exchanged *Fuchs altered one of the exchange agreements, adding the serial numbers of aircraft already delivered. =Congressional solution= In 1996, Congress passed the Wildfire Suppression Aircraft Act, which gave the DoD authority to sell excess military aircraft to airtanker contractors. Criminal cases After a trial in U.S. District Court in Tucson, Arizona which lasted five weeks, both were convicted in 1997 of the conspiracy charge, but were found \\"not guilty\\" on the conversion charge. Fuchs was sentenced to 2 years in prison, while Reagan was sentenced to 2¬Ω years, with both also receiving an additional three years of probation. There were no fines levied. The men began serving their sentences on May 4, 1998. The two appealed their sentences, although, in an unusual move for such a case, their prison sentences were not stayed pending appeal. In July, 2000, the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals, in a 2-to-1 decision, overturned the convictions on the grounds that the original trial jury was improperly instructed regarding the possible implications of the statute of limitations on some of the conspiracy- related activities. With the reversal, the two defendants were released from prison, after serving 20 months. Federal prosecutors elected not to retry the two. Civil cases =Repossession suits= Eventually, a Forest Service contracting officer determined that the exchanges had been illegal, and on December 1, 1998, the Forest Service asserted ownership of the aircraft and ruled that the aircraft must be returned.International Air Response v. USA, U.S. Court of Federal Claims, No. 00-428C, March 12, 2007 \\"The original exchange agreements for the transfer of aircraft are void because we didn't have the authority to conduct an exchange. I have been working to resolve concerns about the air tanker program raised in the OIG audit and issued the letter asserting aircraft ownership on behalf of the Agency,\\" stated Ron Hooper, staff assistant to the Forest Service Deputy Chief for Business Operations, the contracting officer who made the determination of ownership, and who would later testify to that effect in court. In letters sent to the operators, the Forest Service also said that they were prepared to return the titles of the historical aircraft then in museums, many of which were no longer flyable. The airtanker operators sued and eventually prevailed against this ruling. The assertion of ownership ruling allowed for continued operation of eleven of the aircraft which were scheduled to be used under the 1999 National Air Tanker Contract (five other operable aircraft were in the possession of companies who either were unsuccessful in their bid for the contract, or simply chose not to bid; the aircraft, the USFS stated, must still be maintained and used only for firefighting purposes). In response, several of the companies filed suit to prevent this.See also Aero Union Corp. v. United States, 47 Fed. Cl. 677 (2000) and Pacific Harbor Capital, Inc. v. United States Dep‚Äôt of Agriculture, 845 F. Supp. 1 (D.D.C. 1993). Years of legal wrangling ensued, until March, 2007 when the matter finally went to trial in the U.S. Court of Federal Claims, which ruled for International Air Response, the successor to T&G; Aviation. The Government had required the return of the three C-130As provided to T&G; or a payment of US$2.4 million plus interest, and the court invalidated this request based on existing law (40 USC 54440 USC 544 states, \\"A deed, bill of sale, lease, or other instrument executed by or on behalf of an executive agency purporting to transfer title or other interest in surplus property under this chapter is conclusive evidence of compliance with the provisions of this chapter concerning title or other interest of a bona fide grantee or transferee for value and without notice of lack of compliance.\\") which states that if a Bill of Sale is provided, that is evidence that the transaction meets all regulatory requirements. In thus ruling, the court determined that despite the transactions being illegal from the Forest Service's perspective, the purchasers could not be held liable for the agency's improper activities. Similarly, Pacific Harbor Capital received a summary judgment regarding ownership of two of the C-130As, since bills of sale that could be traced back to those issued by Fuchs had been executed. Even though it was illegal for the USFS to issue such bills, the court ruled that such action did not nullify good-faith purchases on the part of the contractors.Pacific Harbor Capital, Inc. v. USDA, 845 F. Supp. 1 (D.D.C. 1993) =Eitel qui tam= In 1994, Gary Eitel filed a qui tam civil lawsuitUnited States ex rel. Eitel v. Reagan, 898 F. Supp. 734 (D. Or. 1995) on behalf of the Federal government against Reagan, the six airtanker operators, and a number of other defendants, which alleged fraud and the unjust gain of enrichment through the exchange program. Due to federal law, Fuchs is immune from being named in such a civil suit. Initially, the U.S. government declined to join the suit. In a qui tam suit, a private citizen may file suit on behalf of and as an agent for the U.S. Government against entities accused of defrauding the government. While the plaintiff must pay for the legal expenses out of his own pocket (in 1998 Eitel estimated that the suit had cost him $3 million), he is entitled to receive 15% to 30% of the money which the government recovers should he prevail in court. Potential penalties were estimated to run as high as US$500 million. Among the issues raised in court by the suit are \\"whether some aerial firefighters were unjustly enriched, if the U.S. Justice Department and Forest Service covered up CIA and drug cartel links to some of the planes, whether the planes should remain in private hands, if the list of defendants should grow or dwindle, and who is telling the truth.\\" The suit was originally filed in U.S. District Court in Oregon (because that was where Reagan was living at the time), and that court ended up dismissing the action. Eitel appealed to the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals, which, in 1997, reinstated the case and allowed the Justice Department to join Eitel as a plaintiff in the suit. At this time, the case was also transferred to District Court in Arizona. Eitel and the Justice Department, however, disagreed over the allegations of CIA involvement, and whether that should be a factor in the suit. The DoJ filed motions in 1998 to drop several of the defendants, provoking a sharp disagreement between Eitel and the Department, and resulting in Eitel's accusation that the DoJ was covering up covert activities and evidence. One of the defendants named in the suit was Riverside County, California County Supervisor Jim Venable, who was also the President of the original recipient, Hemet Valley Flying Service, which received seven of the C-130s. Eitel filed a separate civil suit, which was later combined into his whistleblower action, against the DoJ, USDA and the GSA for an out-of-court settlement between the government and Aero Union and TBM. These two contractors had received aircraft which the government had retained title of, and instead of maintaining the planes, they dismantled them for parts, netting $750,000 in proceeds. Aircraft disposition In the original intent of the exchange program, the C-130s were supposed to stay under U.S. agency control, and were supposed to only be used by the contractors for firefighting purposes within U.S borders. However, not only were the titles of the aircraft transferred out of federal and into private control, but the aircraft were used for a lot more than firefighting. Some of the aircraft were simply sold on the open market (with one being sold to a South African fish-hauling operation), others underwent convoluted title transfers that masked their ownership, and Federal auditors found that a number of the C-130s had been dismantled and their parts sold on the open market. Reagan received title to four of the aircraft as his \\"commission\\", which he then sold for $1.1 million. During the criminal case, both trial and appellate, it was noted that proceeds from these sales were not declared by Reagan on his income taxes, which the court stated as being evidence that he knew the transactions were illegal. Two of the aircraft, operated by T&G;, were found to be hauling cargo in Kuwait at the end of the Gulf War. This discovery played a big part in prompting some of the investigations, and resulted in the Forest Service and the FAA insisting that the planes be returned to the U.S. =Exchanged aircraft= Some of the older aircraft that initiated the replacement scandal are now in museums; a DC-7B to the Pima Air & Space Museum in Tucson, Arizona, an SNB-5 to the Planes of Fame museum, and a UH-19B and C-119C to the Milestones of Flight museum at Fox Field. =Drug trafficking seizure= There have been at least two drug trafficking incidents involving C-130s from T&G; Aviation, one of the original five contractors in the exchange program. In 1990 - 1991, T&G; leased a C-130A to the Panamanian airline Trans Latin Air, which was indicted in 1994 in a Chicago federal court as one of the aviation companies used by the Cali Cartel of Colombia. Luis Carlos Herrera Lizcano, a Colombian aviation executive that was involved with Trans Latin Air, was sentenced in 1995 to five years in a Florida federal prison. The C-130A, and one other were then sold by T&G; in 1993 to Aero Postal de Mexico for US$3.6 million. In October 1997, one of those two aircraft was again in the spotlight when Mexican federal officials seized it as a drug hauler. Mexican investigators had linked Aero Postal de Mexico's owner, Jesus Villegas Covallos, to Ram√≥n Arellano F√©lix of the Tijuana Cartel. Because of the size and visibility of the C-130, officials doubted that the aircraft was used to bring drugs into the U.S., but was ideal for transporting the contraband \\"either within the interior of Mexico or from South or Central America.\\" T&G; subsequently filed for bankruptcy, and its assets were taken over by International Air Response. =CIA-use allegations= The alleged covert use of some of the C-130s by operators under contract with the CIA naturally received a fair amount of media attention.For example, see the highly sensationalized and speculative account presented by FromTheWilderness Publications The source of the CIA allegation was whistleblower Gary Eitel, who began to suspect \\"criminal wrongdoing\\" and that he had \\"inadvertently stepped into a covert CIA operation\\" during his investigation. He came to believe that the exchange program, in part, was a way to funnel military aircraft into the hands of private companies who contracted their services to the CIA, using the Forest Service as an innocuous middle-man for the transfer. After his investigation, Assistant Inspector General James Ebbitt testified that he found no evidence of CIA involvement in the program. Congressman Charles Rose, after hearing Eitel's testimony, went on record saying that he was suspicious, stating, \\"This situation stinks to high heaven.\\" Both the CIA and the Forest Service have vehemently denied CIA involvement in the exchange program. Ultimately, all of the CIA allegations link back to Eitel's claims, and other than his persistent testimony in hearings and later in court, no evidence has been produced corroborating a CIA link to the aircraft. The Justice Department has also denied any link, with Assistant U.S. Attorney Claire Lefkowitz on record as stating \\"We've never found any evidence of CIA involvement.\\" Reagan attempted to use a CIA connection to motion for a new trial, alleging that one of the prosecution witnesses was a CIA operative who himself was under a criminal investigation. In rejecting the motion, U.S. District Judge William Browning stated, \\"The allegation that the CIA was involved is at best illusory. While it is titillating, it's not brought out by any evidence on the record.\\" =Crashes and fleet grounding= Three of the C-130s ended up crashing, two in California (1994 and 2002) when their wings separated in flight due to structural failure, and one in France in 2000 for as-yet-undetermined reasons. The France crash involved one of T&G;'s C-130s. As a direct result of these accidents, in 2004 the entire fleet of C-130A airtankers was permanently grounded by the Forest Service due to safety concerns. The P-3As, all of which were operated by Aero Union, were also initially grounded, but were later returned to the air after it was determined that they could be operated safely, and they remained in service until they were grounded in 2011.

Following deregulation in 1986, bus operations commenced. The livery of white, orange and brown was adopted after the purchase of some former Greater Manchester Passenger Transport Executive Leyland National buses. The original fleet livery was off-white with prussian blue relief. The first service buses were East Lancs bodied Leyland Leopards. These were used on works services from around 1983 and moving onto bus services in 1986. Further Leyland Leopards once operated by Midland Red North were added to the fleet in 1987, but Leyland Nationals eventually became the standard bus type. At one stage three Eastern Coach Works bodied Bristol RE buses were operated. In the early days of bus service operation around 1987 coaches would sometimes be used on bus services, for example AEC Reliances and Bristol LHSs. It operated services in Walsall, Cannock and Brownhills.

History One of its early seats was a small building on Gold Street that was demolished during the 1960s. The final incarnation of the school was on Windmill Avenue, to the east of the town north of Wicksteed Park. Up to 1964, the school had shared a purpose-built premises on Bowling Green Road (A6003) with its girls' equivalent - Kettering High School. After the move to Windmill Avenue (A6098), the Bowling Green Road building was taken over by Kettering Borough Council as its headquarters office, a function it still performs. =Comprehensive= In later years the Windmill Avenue buildings housed Kettering Boys School, with many of the same teachers as the Grammar School but no longer selective, and now part of the area's Comprehensive education system. It operated on two sites - a lower and upper school. The Kettering High School became Kettering School for Girls on Lewis Road (near Wicksteed Park). =Further education college= The Windmill Avenue site has been occupied by Tresham College of Further and Higher Education, (Kettering Campus), since 1993. The former Grammar School buildings were knocked down in 2007 to make way for the Tresham's new block. Space research In the 1960s, Geoffrey Perry, head of the school Physics department experimented with using satellite signals and the Doppler effect as an aid to teaching. The activity soon grew into regular monitoring of Soviet launched satellites and expanded into an international collaboration that became known as the Kettering Group. The group was headed by Geoffrey Perry, who by then had become Head of Science Teaching. On the technical front Geoff was partnered by the head of the Chemistry department, Derek Slater - a Radio Amateur, G3FOZ.Cytringainian Farewell, Kettering Grammar/Boys School (1577‚Äì1993) Work of the group involved tracking satellites with radios, and eavesdropping on communications to cosmonauts, as well as analysing orbits in an attempt to identify different subsets. In 1966, the fledgling group discovered the location of a new secret Soviet launch station in north Russia, Plesetsk, before the American military or intelligence services had released details. In 1957 Aviation Week magazine revealed that the U.S. had been tracking Russian missile launches from advanced long-range radar units in Turkey. The article caused a furore, with President Dwight D. Eisenhower's special assistant for National Security Affairs, Robert Cutler, referring to the article as \\"treasonable\\". It turned out that the story started out with Geoffrey Perry and his students. Perry had passed along to a writer at the magazine that a radar in Turkey was doing important space intel tracking, so the writer dug deeper into the story. Unfortunately, this account is complete fiction, given that the school's first attempt at satellite tracking was in 1962, and it was not until 1964 that the Satellite Tracking Group started to publish any of its findings. In 1966 the project went international when Swedish student Sven Grahn contacted the group with a recording of the signals from Kosmos 104. The same year it discovered Soviet launches from Plesetsk Cosmodrome, officially unacknowledged until 1983. In 1969, a group used simple radio equipment to monitor the Apollo 11 mission and calculated its orbits. According to the group, in December 1972 a member \\"pick[ed] up Apollo 17 on its way to the Moon\\". In 1973 the group tracked Skylab and in July 1975, the team calculated that the Soyuz - Apollo link up would take place 140 miles over Bognor Regis on 17 July 1975 and that the space craft would be traveling at five miles per second. In 1978 the group predicted the crash of Kosmos 954 spacecraft, before it was confirmed by other agencies. In May 1985, Geoffrey Perry talked about the project in the Radio 4 programme The Kettering Project. In March 1987, Channel 4 featured the Group in the programme Sputniks, Bleeps & Mr Perry. Pictures of the school's space tracking team, originally published in The Times newspaper, would later find their way onto record covers of The Wonder Stuff for their album, Construction for the Modern Idiot.

Main Research Contributions  = Recursive Equilibrium Theory = He is probably best known for his contributions to Recursive Competitive theory, an equilibrium concept widely used in modern dynamic macroeconomics, which he developed jointly with Edward C. Prescott. = Determinants of the Equity Premium = Another strand of his research focuses on understanding the determinants of the ‚Äòequity premium‚Äô, the return earned by a diversified portfolio of stocks (such as the S&P; 500) in excess of that earned by a risk free security such as a Treasury Bill. In 1979 he and Edward C. Prescott observed that the real equity premium over the past 90 years in the US was 6.18%, an order of magnitude larger than that could be rationalized by neo-classical economic theory. They termed this regularity the ‚ÄòEquity Premium Puzzle‚Äô. Attempts to resolve the puzzle have become a major research impetus in both finance and macroeconomics over the past thirty years.

Career Zambrowski was born into a Jewish family in Warsaw. He was a member of the Communist Party of Poland (1928‚Äì1938) and of the Central Committee of the Communist Association of Polish Youth (1930‚Äì1938). During World War II in the Soviet Union, he was one of the main organisers and leaders of the Union of Polish Patriots (ZPP) from 1943 and of the Central Bureau Communists of Poland (CBKP) in 1944. He was the head of the Political and Educational Leadership of the First Polish Army (1944‚Äì1945). From 1944, Zambrowski was a member and one of the leaders of the Polish Workers' Party (PPR) and then, from 1948 to 1968, of the Polish United Workers' Party (PZPR). He was in the PZPR's Central Committee (1948‚Äì1964) and held the office of the secretary of the Central Committee (1948‚Äì1954 and 1956‚Äì1963). He was in the PZPR's Politburo from 1948 to 1963. In 1956, he was a leader of the faction in the PZPR known as Pu≈Çawianie.

The strike began after 31 faculty members were dismissed in the fall of 1965 without due process, dismissals which some felt were a violation of the professors' academic freedom. The strike ended without any reinstatements, but led to the widespread unionization of public college faculty in the New York City area. Cause of the strike In the fall of 1965, 31 faculty members at St. John's University were dismissed without due process or any hearing. Both the American Association of University Professors (AAUP) and the United Federation of College Teachers (UFCT) claimed the university had violated the professors' academic freedom. St. John's, the two groups said, demanded that the faculty restrict their teaching to a narrow, dogmatic approach to Thomism and required faculty to submit all articles and books to the administration for clearance before seeking publication. The Rev. Joseph T. Cahill, president of St. John's, said the teachers had used their classrooms for propaganda purposes.\\"Strife at St. John's,\\" Time, December 31, 1965.Currivan, \\"St. John's Hints Faculty Conduct Led to Ousters,\\" New York Times, December 23, 1965. The president of the UFCT, Israel Kugler, pushed for a more radical response to the dispute. The AAUP refused to engage in a strike, and largely withdrew from the dispute when faculty appeared to support Kugler. Kugler called for a strike to begin in January 1966, and widened the dispute to include pay and benefits (faculty pay was the lowest of the 10 largest Catholic universities in the U.S. The strike begins The strike at St. John's started on January 4, 1966. The union pushed for mediation and arbitration in December 1965, but the university refused to submit to either. Using tactics pioneered by Albert Shanker to win collective bargaining rights for New York City public school teachers, Kugler pushed for local and state government officials to get involved in the dispute. Only a minority of St. John's faculty walked out, forcing the university to close some but not a majority of classes.Currivan, \\"St. John's Strike on Jan. 3 Called By Teacher Union,\\" New York Times, December 18, 1965; Currivan, \\"St. John's Gets Mediation Offer,\\" New York Times, December 24, 1965; Currivan, \\"St. John's Bars Mediation By City,\\" New York Times, December 28, 1965; Grutzner, \\"Mayor Offers Aid on St. Johns,\\" New York Times, January 4, 1966; Currivan, \\"St. John's Opens Despite Its Strike,\\" New York Times, January 5, 1966; Currivan, \\"St. John's Warns 25 Absentees to Return to Job or Face Action,\\" New York Times, January 6, 1966; Dallos, \\"St. John's Calls Boycott Failure,\\" New York Times, January 11, 1966; Gansberg, \\"St. John's Strike Closes Classes, But 2 Sides Disagree on Number,\\" New York Times, February 15, 1966. During the next two years, Kugler challenged the university's accreditation before the Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools twice. But that body only warned the university and took no further action.Dallos, \\"St. John's to Keep Its Accreditation But Gets Warning,\\" New York Times, May 1, 1966; Currivan, \\"St. John's Warned Its Accreditation May Be Revoked,\\" New York Times, December 2, 1966; Currivan, \\"St. John's Retains Its Accreditation,\\" New York Times, May 4, 1968. The union raised $250,000 from the Workmen's Circle and other organizations to support the striking faculty. Kugler took professors' case to the Vatican and sought an individual audience with Pope Paul VI, whose encyclicals on workers' rights were repeatedly cited by the union. But the pope refused him an audience.\\"Featherman File,\\" The Forward, March 27, 1998. Other tactics were tried as well. Some faculty sued the university for fraud for including their names in the 1966 catalog of classes.Kaplan, \\"Faculty Strikers Suing St. John's,\\" New York Times, June 2, 1966; Currivan, \\"$100,000 Sought in St. John's Case,\\" New York Times, October 12, 1969.

The strike ends In the early spring of 1967, as the strike threatened to widen to other Catholic universities in the country and state legislators opened hearings on the labor dispute, the university agreed to arbitration.Morris, \\"Catholic U. Classes Stopped as Protest Spreads in Faculty,\\" New York Times, April 21, 1967; Johnston, \\"Legislative Panel Will Investigate Sale by L.I.U. and Dismissals at St. John's,\\" New York Times, October 10, 1967. The strike ended in June 1967. The union did not win recognition at St. John's, and in 1970 arbitrators ruled that the university had not acted improperly.\\"New Impasse Stalls Plans to Arbitrate St. John's Dispute,\\" New York Times, April 6, 1967; Gansberg, \\"St. John's Dispute to Be Arbitrated,\\" New York Times, June 20, 1967; Malcolm, \\"Arbitrators Absolve St. John's of Teachers' Antiunion Charge,\\" New York Times, January 28, 1970. Assessment and outcomes Although the strike was a failure in that it did not win reinstatement for the faculty, the strike established the AFT as the pre-eminent union organizing American higher education faculty. Kugler quickly turned the UFCT's attention to other colleges and universities in the New York City area. In the next few years, under his leadership the union organized locals at the Fashion Institute of Technology (FIT), Nassau Community College and Westchester Community College.Hevesi, \\"Israel Kugler, Union Official Who Led Strike at St. John‚Äôs, Dies at 90,\\" New York Times, October 8, 2007. In 1967, Kugler began pushing for the UFCT to organize the faculty at CUNY. Backed by the AFT and the newly formed (and politically powerful) United Federation of Teachers, UFCT not only won an agreement for a union election but won the December 6, 1968, election in the face of a determined challenge from the AAUP. The union won a second election (this time for non-tenured faculty) nine days later, and a signed contract nine months later.Polishook, \\"Collective Bargaining and the City University of New York,\\" Journal of Higher Education, May 1970.Farber, \\"City U.

In 1972, Kugler merged the UFCT with its long-time rival, the Legislative Conference of the City University. The two groups formed a new organization affiliated with the AFT, the Professional Staff Congress (PSC). As of 2007, the PSC represented more than 20,000 faculty and staff members at CUNY. Kugler later wrote a well- regarded article about the strike, \\"The 1966 Strike at St. John's University: A Memoir,\\" which was published in Labor's Heritage in 1997.

He was responsible for the construction of their first hotel, the Corinthia Palace in Attard, Malta. Pisani has led the Corinthia Group from a one-hotel company to a diversified group. His business interests vary from equity participation, management, development and ownership of property and industrial catering, all on an international scale.  Early life  Pisani was born and raised in an upper-middle-class family in Malta; the second of four brothers and two sisters. His father Paul owned stakes in a matchbox factory and a flour mill in Malta, amongst various other property interests. Pisani started working in his father's business at sixteen years of age. Pisani's father died prematurely soon after acquiring one of the most prestigious villas in Malta as his private residence. Pisani subsequently hired out the property for wedding receptions, (including his own), and this led to the opening of an 80-seat restaurant in December 1962. After Malta gained independence in 1964 and with the tourism industry flourishing, they opened a 40-room hotel, which was later expanded to 156 rooms. Pisani was educated at St. Edward's College, Malta.  Honours  In December 2001, Pisani was appointed an Officer to the Maltese National Order of Merit. Personal life Pisani is married to his second wife, Maria, and lives on Malta. His youngest daughter, Rebecca, manages the spa at the Corinthia Palace Hotel, San Anton, Malta. His other daughter, Alexandra, works for Corinthia Hotels. His son, Marcus also works for Corinthia Hotels.

She travelled to London in 1932 and became the first black woman to be employed by the BBC during World War II. In 1942 she became producer of the programme Calling the West Indies, turning it into Caribbean Voices, which became an important forum for Caribbean literary work.  Early years (1905‚Äì1932)  Una Marson was born on 6 February 1905, in Santa Cruz, Jamaica, in the parish of St Elizabeth. She was the youngest of six children of Rev. Solomon Isaac Marson (1858‚Äì1916), a Baptist parson, and his wife Ada Wilhelmina Mullins (1863‚Äì1922).DeCaires Narain, Denise, \\"Marson, Una Maud Victoria\\", Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004. Una had a middle-class upbringing and was very close to her father, who influenced some of her fatherlike characters in her later works. As a child before going to school she was an avid reader of available literature, which at the time was mostly English classical literature. At the age of 10, Marson was enrolled in Hampton High, a girl's boarding school in Jamaica of which her father was on the board of trustees. However, that same year, Rev. Isaac died, leaving the family with financial problems, so they moved to Kingston. Una finished school at Hampton High, but did not go on to a college education. After leaving Hampton, she found work in Kingston as a volunteer social worker and used the secretarial skills, such as stenography, she had learned in school. In 1926, Marson was appointed assistant editor of the Jamaican political journal Jamaica Critic. Her years there taught her journalism skills as well as influencing her political and social opinions and inspired her to create her own publication. In fact, in 1928, she became Jamaica's first female editor and publisher of her own magazine, The Cosmopolitan. The Cosmopolitan featured articles on feminist topics, local social issues and workers' rights and was aimed at a young, middle-class Jamaican audience. Marson's articles encouraged women to join the work force and to become politically active. The magazine also featured Jamaican poetry and literature from Marson's fellow members of the Jamaican Poetry League, started by J. E. Clare McFarlane. In 1930, Marson published her first collection of poems, entitled Tropic Reveries, that dealt with love and nature with elements of feminism. It won the Musgrave Medal from the Institute of Jamaica. Her poems about love are somewhat misunderstood by friends and critics, as there is no evidence of a romantic relationship in Marson's life, although love continued to be a common topic in her work. In 1931, due to financial difficulties, The Cosmopolitan ceased publication, which led her to begin publishing more poetry and plays. In 1931, she published another collection of poetry, entitled Heights and Depths, which also dealt with love and social issues. Also in 1931, she wrote her first play, At What a Price, about a Jamaican girl who moves from the country into the city of Kingston to work as a stenographer and falls in love with her white male boss. The play opened in Jamaica and later London to critical acclaim. In 1932, she decided to go to London to find a broader audience for her work and to experience life outside of Jamaica.Jarrett-Macauley, Delia, The Life of Una Marson, Manchester University Press, 1998.  London years (1932‚Äì36)  When she first arrived in the UK in 1932, she stayed in Peckham, south-east London, at the home of Harold Moody, who the year before had founded civil-rights organisation The League of Coloured Peoples.Motune, Vic, \\"The BBC's Forgotten Black Female Star\\", The Voice, 10 March 2019. From 1932 to 1945, Marson moved back and forth between London and Jamaica. She continued to contribute to politics, but now instead of focusing on writing for magazines, she wrote for newspapers and her own literary works in order to get her political ideas across. In these years, Marson kept writing to advocate feminism, but one of her new emphases was on the race issue in England. Marson first moved to London in 1932. The racism and sexism she met there \\"transformed both her life and her poetry\\"; The voice in her poetry became more focused on the identity of black women in England.Waters, Erika J., Una Marson, 204. In this period then, Marson not only continued to write about women's roles in society, but also put into the mix the issues faced by black people who lived in England. In July 1933, she wrote a poem called \\"Nigger\\" that would appear in the League of Coloured Peoples' journal, The Keys which she worked on in an editorial capacity and became Editor for in 1935; one of Marson's more forceful poems addressing racism in England, \\"Nigger\\" only saw light seven years later when it was published in 1940. Outside of her writing at that time, Marson was in the London branch of the International Alliance of Women, a global feminist organization. By 1935, she was involved with the International Alliance of Women based in Istanbul.  Jamaica (1936‚Äì38)  Marson returned to Jamaica in 1936, where one of her goals was to promote national literature. One step she took in achieving this goal was to help create the Kingston Readers and Writers Club, as well as the Kingston Drama Club. She also founded the Jamaica Save the Children Fund, an organization that raised funds to give the poorer children money to get a basic education. In promoting Jamaican literature, Marson published Moth and the Star in 1937. Many poems in that volume demonstrate how despite the media's portrayal that black women have inferior beauty when compared to the whites, black women should still be confident in their own physical beauty. This theme is seen in \\"Cinema Eyes\\", \\"Little Brown Girl\\", \\"Black is Fancy\\" and \\"Kinky Hair Blues\\".\\"Una Marson\\" in Margaret Busby, Daughters of Africa, London: Cape, 1992, p. 221. However, Marson herself was affected by the stereotype of superior white beauty; Marson herself, her biographer tells us, within months of her arrival in Britain \\"stopped straightening her hair and went natural\\".Jenkins, Lee M., The Language of Caribbean Poetry (2004), 138. Going along with her feminist principles, Marson worked with Louise Bennett to create another play called London Calling, which was about a woman who moved to London to further her education. However, the woman later became homesick and returned to Jamaica. This play shows how the main character is a \\"strong heroine\\" for being able to \\"force herself to return to London\\" in order to finish her education there. Also in the feminist vein, Marson wrote Public Opinion, contributing to the feminist column. Marson's third play, Pocomania, is about a woman named Stella who is looking for an exciting life. Critics suggest that this play is significant because it demonstrates how an \\"Afro-religious cult\\" affects middle-class women.Banham, Hill, Woodyard, The Cambridge Guide to African and Caribbean Theatre, 212. Pocomania is also one of Marson's most important works because she was able to put the essence of Jamaican culture into it. Critics such as Ivy Baxter said that \\"Pocomania was a break in tradition because it talked about a cult from the country\\", and, as such, it represented a turning point in what was acceptable on the stage.Waters, Una Marson, 206. In 1937, Marson wrote a poem called \\"Quashie comes to London\\", which is the perspective of England in a Caribbean narrative. In Caribbean dialect, quashie means gullible or unsophisticated. Although initially impressed, Quashie becomes disgusted with England because there is not enough good food there. The poem shows how, although England has good things to offer, it is Jamaican culture that Quashie misses, and therefore Marson implies that England is supposed to be \\"the temporary venue for entertainment\\".Donnell, Alison, and Sarah Lawson Welsh, The Routledge Reader in Caribbean Literature (1996), 120. The poem shows how it was possible for a writer to implement Caribbean dialect in a poem, and it is this usage of local dialect that situates Quashie's perspective of England as a Caribbean perspective.  London years (1938‚Äì45)  Marson returned to London in 1938 to continue work on the Jamaican Save the Children project that she started in Jamaica, and also to be on the staff of the Jamaican Standard. In March 1940 Marson published an article entitled \\"We Want Books - But Do We Encourage Our Writers?\\"Donnell and Welsh, The Routledge Reader in Caribbean Literature, 185‚Äì186. in Public Opinion, a political weekly, in an effort to spur Caribbean nationalism through literature. In 1941, she was hired by the BBC Empire Service to work on the programme Calling the West Indies, in which World War II soldiers would have their messages read on the radio to their families,\\"About us\\", BBC Caribbean, 31 March 2011 (archived).\\"West Indies Calling (1944)\\", BFI. YouTube. becoming the producer of the programme by 1942. During the same year, Marson turned the programme into Caribbean Voices, as a forum in which Caribbean literary work was read over the radio. More than two hundred authors appeared on Caribbean Voices, including V. S. Naipaul, Samuel Selvon, George Lamming and Derek Walcott. Through this show, Marson met people such as J. E. Clare McFarlane, Vic Reid, Andrew Salkey, Langston Hughes, James Weldon Johnson, Jomo Kenyatta, Haile Selassie, Marcus Garvey, Amy Garvey, Nancy Cunard, Sylvia Pankhurst, Winifred Holtby, Paul Robeson, John Masefield, Louis MacNeice, T. S. Eliot, Tambimuttu and George Orwell.De Caires, Brendan, \\"Windrush moderns\\", Archive, Caribbean Review of Books, November 2015. The latter helped Marson edit the programme before she turned it into Caribbean Voices. She also established a firm friendship with Mary Treadgold, who eventually took over her role when Marson returned to Jamaica. However, \\"despite these experiences and personal connections, there is a strong sense, in Marson's poetry and in Jarrett-Macauley's biography [The Life of Una Marson], that Marson remained something of an isolated and marginal figure\\".Narain, Denise deCaires, Contemporary Caribbean Women's Poetry (2002), 3. Nevertheless, Marson's radio show, Caribbean Voices, subsequently produced by Henry Swanzy,Nanton, Philip, and Anne Walmsley, \\"Henry Swanzy\\", The Guardian, 20 March 2004. was described by Kamau Brathwaite as \\"the single most important literary catalyst for Caribbean creative writing in English\\". Since on radio the poems could only be appreciated orally, Caribbean Voices helped to influence later Caribbean poetry in having a more spoken form; as Laurence Breiner notes, through the medium of radio \\"much West Indian poetry was heard rather than seen\\".Jenkins, The Language of Caribbean Poetry (2004), 127.  Life after World War II (1945‚Äì65)  Details of Marson's life are limited, and those pertaining to her personal and professional life post-1945 are particularly hard to come by. In 1945, she published a poetry collection entitled Towards the Stars. This marked a shift in the focus of her poetry: while she once wrote about female sadness over lost love, poems from Towards the Stars were much more focused on the independent woman.Jenkins, \\"Penelope's Web: Una Marson, Lorna Goodison, M. NourbeSe Philip\\", 139. Her efforts outside of her writing seem to work in collaboration with these sentiments, though conflicting stories offer little concrete evidence about what she exactly did. Sources differ in outlining Marson's personal life during this time period. Author Erika J. Waters states that Marson was a secretary for the Pioneer Press, a publishing company in Jamaica for Jamaican authors. This source believes that she then moved in the 1950s to Washington, DC, where she met and married a dentist named Peter Staples. The two allegedly divorced, allowing Marson to travel to England, Israel, then back to Jamaica, where she died aged 60 in 1965, following a heart attack.Waters, \\"Una Marson\\", Dictionary of Literary Biography, vol. 157: Caribbean and Black African Writers, third series, 207. Another source, written by Lee M. Jenkins, offers a very different take on Marson's personal life and says that Marson was sent to a mental hospital following a breakdown during the years 1946‚Äì49. After being released, Marson founded the Pioneer Press. This source claims that she went in the 1950s to the US, where she had another breakdown and was admitted to St. Elizabeth's Asylum. Following this, Marson returned to Jamaica, where she rallied against Rastafarian discrimination. She then went to Israel for a women's conference, an experience that she discussed in her last BBC radio broadcast for Woman's Hour.Jenkins, 128‚Äì29. The conflicting details regarding Marson's personal life show that there is very little information available about her. For example, Water's article quotes Marson's criticisms of Porgy and Bess, yet provides no citation for this work. In combination with this is the limited record of her writings during this time period. Many of her works were left unpublished or circulated only in Jamaica.Rosenberg, Leah, \\"The Pitfalls of Feminist Nationalism and the Career of Una Marson\\" (2007), 160. Most of these writings are only available in the Institute of Jamaica in Kingston, as a special collection at the National Library of Jamaica. Given these constraints, it is difficult to understand the whole of Marson's accomplishments during the final period of her life.  Criticism and influences  Critics have both praised and dismissed Marson's poetry. She has been criticized for mimicking European style, such as Romantic and Georgian poetics. For example, Marson's poem \\"If\\" parodies the style of Kipling's original poem of the same title.Umoren, Imaobong D., \\"‚ÄòThis is the Age of Woman‚Äô: Black Feminism and Black Internationalism in the Works of Una Marson, 1928-1938\\", History of Women in the Americas 1:1, April 2013 (50‚Äì73), p. 61. Denise deCaires Narain has suggested that Marson was overlooked because poetry concerning the condition and status of females was not important to audiences at the time the works were produced.Narain, Contemporary Caribbean Women's Poetry: Making Style, 2002. Other critics, by contrast, praised Marson for her modern style. Some, such as Narain, even suggest that her mimicking challenged conventional poetry of the time in an effort to criticize European poets. Regardless, Marson was active in the West Indian writing community during that period. Her involvement with Caribbean Voices was important to publicising Caribbean literature internationally, as well as spurring nationalism within the Caribbean islands that she represented.

A forkball specialist, Gray started his professional career in 1984 in the Phillies' minor league system, pitching for two years before joining the Cincinnati organization. In 1986, he posted a 14‚Äì2 record with a 2.35 ERA and 15 saves for Double-A Vermont, and in 1988, he went 8‚Äì5 with five saves and a 1.97 in 42 appearances for Triple-A Nashville, gaining promotion to the Reds during midseason. He recorded a 3.86 ERA in five games and did not have a decision, returning to Triple-A the next year. Then, he rejoined Philadelphia before the 1990 season. At the end of the 1990 spring training, Gray was told by the Phillies that he had not made the club; they asked him to go to Double-A Reading. Gray rejected the offer and signed with Triple-A Pawtucket, arriving to the Boston Red Sox during the midseason to become a significant contributor to the American League division winners. Gray collected nine saves, but seven of them came in seven chances from August 19 through September 10 as he filled in for injured closer Jeff Reardon. On July 30, 1991, Gray was preparing to go out onto the field for his daily routine. He never made it, as his right side went numb, and he suffered what was diagnosed as a kind of stroke (CVA), ending what had been a brilliant season. One of the best middle relievers of the league at this time, he allowed only 39 hits in 61 ‚Öî innings as he had a 2.34 ERA. On the other hand, opposing batters hit a .181 average against him (LH .200, RH .161), the best of any reliever, outside of Bryan Harvey. He also went down in July and still finished third in the league with 19 holds. Gray missed the rest of the 1991 and 1992 seasons while recuperating from the stroke. He attempted to return to baseball over the following two seasons,http://vault.sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1138774/index.htm but had lost a lot of velocity on his fastballGrossman, Leigh, The Red Sox Fan's Handbook, 2004, p.146. and was never able to return to the majors. Gray later returned to the game as a pitching coach. As of 2003, he was the pitching coach for the Gulf Coast League Reds. He is also co-owner of Beef O'Brady's Restaurant in Sarasota, Florida along with former Red Sox teammate Jody Reed. In a three-season career, Gray posted a 4‚Äì7 record with a 3.33 ERA and 10 saves in 96 appearances, including a 3.31 strikeout-to-walk ratio (96-to-29) in 121 ‚Öî innings of work.

Common Purpose UK is a subsidiary of Common Purpose. Founded in 1989 by Julia Middleton, its aim are to develop leaders who cross boundaries so they can solve complex problems in work and in society. Adirupa Sengupta was appointed as Group CEO in 2019. As of 2015 Common Purpose ran local programmes for leaders in cities across the world, and its global programmes bring together leaders from over 100 countries across six continents. As of 2019, 85,000 leaders worldwide have taken part in Common Purpose programmes. Activities =Courses= Common Purpose has run a range of leadership development courses which it claims offer participants the inspiration, knowledge and connections to help them become more active and engaged in society. These courses ran in 11 countries worldwide as of 2010, and seek to build organizational capacity by increasing the number of individuals who are actively involved in shaping the future of the area in which they work and who subscribe to Common Purposes's values. The courses were conducted under the Chatham House Rule to encourage free discussion amongst participants. This has caused some people to voice suspicions that the organisation has a hidden agenda. =Participants= Common Purpose works with a wide range of organisations and individuals across business, public, voluntary and political sectors. As of 2019, 85,000 leaders have taken part in Common Purpose programmes. =Education and young people= Your Turn was a leadership programme for Year 9 students that was conducted in 2010 in five regions throughout the UK, and challenged young people to think in new ways about their area and their world. CHANGEit was a 2010 collaboration between Common Purpose and Deutsche Bank. It has been designed to recognise the achievements and ambitions of young people between the ages of 11 and 18 who want to speak out and create positive change. =Senior executives= What Next? was a 2010 course run by leadership development organisation Common Purpose and the Said Business School to help redundant executives identify opportunities to continue to use the experience they have accumulated during their careers. =Leadership campaigns= In July 2009 Common Purpose was commissioned by the Government Equalities Office to conduct an online survey of individuals in leadership positions, and produce a report entitled \\"Diversity of Representation in Public Appointments\\". Subsequently, Common Purpose and the Government Equalities Office set up The About Time Public Leaders Courses, designed to support the government‚Äôs aim to increase the diversity of public-body board members and the pool of talented individuals ready to take up public appointments. The schemes were formally launched in January 2010. In January 2010, Common Purpose Chief Executive, Julia Middleton, published interviews with 12 leaders from the private, public and voluntary sectors, including Sir David Bell and Dame Suzi Leather about the qualities needed for good leadership in challenging times. =Projects= In July 2008 Common Purpose introduced a project in Bangalore, India, which took 50 people from different sectors, e.g. IT and banking, and encouraged them to share local and international knowledge in order to solve problems associated with trading in a recession. It has also run projects in Germany, to highlight the importance of having good facilities for the disabled.  Press coverage  In May 2008 the Yorkshire Post revealed that Common Purpose had been granted free office space at the Department for Children, Schools and Families in Sheffield in 1997. A DCSF spokeswoman said the free office accommodation had been given in line with the policy of the then Education Secretary David Blunkett, a Sheffield MP, who had wanted to build better links with the local community. But Philip Davies, Conservative MP for Shipley, criticised the relationship between Government and Common Purpose as well as the fact it did not put the content of its training in the public domain. In January 2009 Third Sector magazine reported that Common Purpose was to face no further action from the Information Commissioner's Office. The announcement came following the ICO‚Äôs ruling in October 2008 that the charity was unlikely to have complied with the provisions in the Data Protection Act on processing personal data when it compiled a list containing the personal details of people who had made what it (CP) contended were \\"vexatious\\" requests under the Freedom of Information Act 2000 relating to its dealings with public authorities. Leveson Inquiry controversy A number of UK national newspapers ran stories implying that Common Purpose had exerted improper influence over the Leveson Inquiry, in the days preceding publication of its report. These stories centred on the role of Inquiry member Sir David Bell, who was both a trustee of Common Purpose, and had set up the Media Standards Trust (a lobbying group which presented evidence to the Inquiry) together with Julia Middleton. Moreover, the Media Standards Trust set up and provided funding for the lobbying group Hacked Off, which also presented evidence to the Inquiry. Bell resigned from the Media Standards Trust when he was appointed a member of the Inquiry. On 25 November, The Daily Telegraph too published a comment piece on CPUK, noting that the Rotherham Director of Children's Services, Joyce Thacker, heavily criticised in the Rotherham child sexual exploitation scandal, was a member of CPUK, and noting that Common Purpose had been described as \\"[a] secretive Fabian organisation [‚Ä¶ that] has been described as a Left-wing version of the Freemasons.\\" Writing in The Guardian, Roy Greenslade described the Mail coverage of Common Purpose in general, and the central focus on Sir David Bell in particular, as \\"a classic example of conspiracist innuendo\\" and went on that \\"through a series of leaps of logic and phoney 'revelations' of Bell's publicly acknowledged positions, the articles persistently insinuate that he has been up to no good.\\" This opinion was shared in an article in the New Statesman by Peter Wilby. Also in The Guardian, Michael White acknowledged that, \\"anti-establishment bodies should be as much fair game for accountability as those of the old establishment\\", but said: \\"I couldn't help thinking as I read it that the analysis itself is a bit of a conspiracy. Delete 'Common Purpose' throughout and insert 'Jew', 'Etonian' or 'Freemason' and you'd rightly feel uneasy.\\" References Further reading *Move outside your comfort zone - Guardian.co.uk *\\"I'm very good with a hatchet\\" - Guardian.co.uk *The Wealth of Experience The Guardian, 16 April 2008 (Article by Julia Middleton) *Be yourself ‚Äì but know who you are meant to be The Financial Times, 17 March 2008 (Comments by Julia Middleton) *Networking  Generation Y recognise the benefits Personnel Today 'Work Clinic' (Research by Common Purpose and comments by Julia Middleton) External links  Category:Charities based in London Category:Personal development Category:Organizations established in 1989 Category:1989 establishments in the United Kingdom Category:Private companies limited by guarantee of England ","title":"Common Purpose UK"},{"id":"13635974","text":"Protestants comprise less than 1% of the population of Qatar.

Transgenic animals have been obtained using SMGT, but the efficiency of this technique is low. Low efficiency is mainly due to low uptake of exogenous DNA by the spermatozoa, reducing the chances of fertilizing the oocytes with transfected spermatozoa.2 In order to successfully produce transgenic animals by SMGT, the spermatozoa must attach the exogenous DNA into the head and these transfected spermatozoa must maintain their functionality to fertilize the oocyte.2 Genetically modified animals produced by SMGT are useful for research in biomedical, agricultural, and veterinary fields of study. SMGT could also be useful in generating animals as models for human diseases or lead to future discoveries relating to human gene therapy. Sperm-Mediated Gene Transfer Mechanism The method for SMGT uses the sperm cell, a natural vector of genetic material, to transport exogenous DNA. The exogenous DNA molecules bind to the cell membrane of the head of the sperm cell. This binding and internalization of the DNA is not a random event. The exogenous DNA interacts with the DNA-binding proteins (DBPs) that are present on the surface of the sperm cell.3 Spermatozoa are naturally protected against the intrusion of exogenous DNA molecules by an inhibitory factor present in mammals‚Äô seminal fluid. This factor blocks the binding of sperm cells and exogenous DNA because in the presence of the inhibitory factor, DBPs lose their ability to bind to exogenous DNA. In the absence of this inhibitory factor, DBPs on sperm cells are able to interact with DNA and can then translocate the DNA into the cell. Therefore, the seminal fluid must be removed from the sperm samples by extensive washing immediately after ejaculation.3 After the DNA is internalized, the exogenous DNA must be integrated into the genome. There are various mechanisms suggested for DNA integration, including integrating DNA at oocyte activation, at nucleus decondensation, or at the formation of the pronuclei, but all of these suggested mechanisms imply that the integration of DNA happens after the penetration of the sperm cell into the oocyte.3 Sperm-Mediated Gene Transfer Controversy Sperm-mediated gene transfer is considered controversial because despite the successes, it has not yet become established as a reliable form of genetic manipulation. Skepticism arises based on the assumption that evolutionary chaos could arise if sperm cells could act as vectors for exogenous DNA.4 Reasonable assumption tells us that because reproductive tracts contain free DNA molecules, sperm cells should be highly resistant to the risk of picking up exogenous DNA molecules. SMGT has been demonstrated experimentally and followed the assumption that nature has barriers against SMGT. These barriers are not always absolute and could explain the inconsistent experimental outcomes of SMGT.4 If there are natural barriers against SMGT, then the successes may only represent unusual cases in which the barriers failed. Two barriers have been identified; the inhibitory factor in seminal fluid that prevents binding to foreign DNA molecules and a sperm endogenous nuclease activity that is triggered upon interaction of sperm cells with foreign DNA molecules.4 These protections give reason to believe that unintentional interactions between sperm and exogenous genetic sequences is kept to a minimal. These barriers allow for protection against the threat that every fertilization event could become a potentially mutagenic one.4 Applications of Sperm-Mediated Gene Transfer = Animal Transgenesis = Transgenic animals have been produced successfully using gene transfer techniques such as sperm-mediated gene transfer. Though this production has been successful, the efficiency of the process is low. Low efficiency of SMGT in the production of transgenic animals is mainly due to poor uptake of the exogenous DNA by the sperm cells, thus reducing the number of fertilized oocytes with transfected spermatozoa.5 From 1989 to 2004, there were over 30 claims for the production of viable transgenic animals using SMGT, but only about 25 percent of these demonstrated a transmission of the transgenes beyond the F0 generation.4 This transmission is required in order to claim usable animal transgenesis. According to previous studies, numerous animal species, including mammals, birds, insects, and fish, have been found susceptible to SMGT techniques, thus indicating that SMGT has broad applicability across a wide variety of Metazoan species.4 Currently, despite the low frequency of transmission of transgenes, the frequency of phenotype modifications and overall animal transgenesis has been as high as 80 percent in some experiments.4 = Gene Therapy = The potential use of sperm-mediated gene transfer for embryo somatic gene therapy is a possibility for future research. Embryo somatic gene therapy would be advantageous because there seems to be an inverse correlation between the age of the patient and the effectiveness of gene therapy. Therefore, the possibility of gene therapy treatment before irreversible damage occurs would be ideal.4 A majority of the experiments that report successful SMGT provide evidence of post-fertilization transfer and maintenance of transgenes.6 SMGT has potential advantages of being a simple and cost-effective method of gene therapy, especially in contrast with pronuclear microinjection, another transgenic technique. Nevertheless, despite some successes and its potential utility, SMGT is not yet established as a reliable form of genetic modification.6 References 1\\\\. Lavitrano M, Giovannoni R, Cerrito MG. 2013.

English translation: See also: ‚Ä¶ Changing from Schwarzschild to Lema√Ætre coordinates removes the coordinate singularity at the Schwarzschild radius.  Equations  The original Schwarzschild coordinate expression of the Schwarzschild metric, in natural units (), is given as :ds^2=\\\\left(1-{r_s\\\\over r}\\\\right)dt^2-{dr^2\\\\over 1-{r_s\\\\over r}} - r^2\\\\left(d\\\\theta^2+\\\\sin^2\\\\theta d\\\\phi^2\\\\right) \\\\;, where :ds^2 is the invariant interval; :r_s=2M is the Schwarzschild radius; :M is the mass of the central body; :t, r, \\\\theta, \\\\phi are the Schwarzschild coordinates (which asymptotically turn into the flat spherical coordinates); :c is the speed of light; :and G is the gravitational constant. This metric has a coordinate singularity at the Schwarzschild radius r=r_s. Georges Lema√Ætre was the first to show that this is not a real physical singularity but simply a manifestation of the fact that the static Schwarzschild coordinates cannot be realized with material bodies inside the Schwarzschild radius. Indeed, inside the Schwarzschild radius everything falls towards the centre and it is impossible for a physical body to keep a constant radius. A transformation of the Schwarzschild coordinate system from \\\\\\\\{t,r\\\\\\\\} to the new coordinates \\\\\\\\{\\\\tau,\\\\rho\\\\\\\\}, : \\\\begin{align} d\\\\tau = dt + \\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{r_{s}}{r}}\\\\,\\\\left(1-\\\\frac{r_{s}}{r}\\\\right)^{-1}dr~\\\\\\\\\\\\ d\\\\rho = dt + \\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{r}{r_{s}}}\\\\,\\\\left(1-\\\\frac{r_{s}}{r}\\\\right)^{-1}dr~ \\\\end{align} (the numerator and denominator are switched inside the square-roots), leads to the Lema√Ætre coordinate expression of the metric, : ds^{2} = d\\\\tau^{2} - \\\\frac{r_{s}}{r} d\\\\rho^{2} \\\\- r^{2}(d\\\\theta^{2} +\\\\sin^{2}\\\\theta d\\\\phi^{2}) where : r=\\\\left[\\\\frac{3}{2}(\\\\rho-\\\\tau)\\\\right]^{2/3}r_{s}^{1/3} \\\\;. The trajectories with œÅ constant are timelike geodesics with œÑ the proper time along these geodesics. They represent the motion of freely falling particles which start out with zero velocity at infinity. At any point their speed is just equal to the escape velocity from that point. In Lema√Ætre coordinates there is no singularity at the Schwarzschild radius, which instead corresponds to the point \\\\frac{3}{2}(\\\\rho-\\\\tau)=r_s. However, there remains a genuine gravitational singularity at the center, where \\\\rho-\\\\tau=0, which cannot be removed by a coordinate change. The Lema√Ætre coordinate system is synchronous, that is, the global time coordinate of the metric defines the proper time of co-moving observers.

These business routes connect I-94 to the downtown business districts of neighboring cities. These eight routes are all business loops which bear the Business Loop I-94 (BL I-94) designation. These loops are former routings of I-94's two predecessors in Michigan: US Highway 12 (US 12) or US 25\\\\. The westernmost BL I-94 runs through the twin cities of Benton Harbor and St. Joseph along the former routing of US 12 and US 31/US 33 that now includes a section of the Lake Michigan Circle Tour in the state. The loops in Kalamazoo, Battle Creek, Marshall, Albion, and Jackson were also formerly segments of US 12 which were later designated as separate version of Business US Highway 12 (Bus. US 12) through their respective cities before becoming BL I-94s in 1960. The route of the business loop through Ann Arbor was previously US 12 and then later M-14 before receiving its current moniker. The BL I-94 through Port Huron was previously US 25 and then Business US Highway 25 (Bus. US 25). Benton Harbor‚ÄìSt. Joseph Business Loop Interstate 94 (BL I-94) is a state trunkline highway and business loop that runs from I-94 through the downtowns of Benton Harbor and St. Joseph. The highway begins at exit 23 on I-94 in Lincoln Township where it runs along Lakeshore Drive, passing through the community of Shoreham. This section of the loop has five lanes (two in each direction with a center turn lane) before it drops a lane in each direction south of Shoreham, and it is part of the Lake Michigan Circle Tour (LMCT). BL I-94 briefly runs concurrently with M-63 along Main Street in downtown St. Joseph. This section widens to a four-lane divided street. BL I-94 separates from M-63 on the one-way pairing of Ship Street (eastbound) and Port Street (westbound) for three blocks before crossing the St. Joseph River to Benton Harbor; the LMCT concurrency ends at this point. From there it follows the five-laned Main Street through downtown Benton Harbor through roundabouts at Riverview Drive and 5th Street. At the latter roundabout, the roadway narrows back to three lanes. The easternmost leg of the loop, from Urbandale Avenue easterly to the eastern terminus at exit 33 on I-94 in Benton Township, is a four-lane, limited-access, divided highway; it features an unusual intersection with Crystal Avenue which is a diamond interchange built at-grade. The highway through the downtowns of Benton Harbor and St. Joseph was a part of US 12 when the United States Numbered Highway System was created in late 1926. US 31 was also routed concurrently through the area. The US 33 designation was later added to US 31 from the state line northward to US 12 in St. Joseph in 1937. On November 2, 1960, the I-94/US 12 freeway opened around the Benton Harbor‚ÄìSt. Joseph area, and the former route of US 12 through downtown was renumbered BL I-94. By the next year, US 33 was extended along BL I-94/US 31, and the eastern end of BL I-94 was converted to a divided highway. In 1962, US 31 was rerouted out of downtown Benton Harbor and St. Joseph to follow a new freeway east of Benton Harbor, removing it from BL I-94/US 33. When the business route was first constructed, it had half of a bridgeless diamond interchange each at Crystal and Euclid avenues, with the intent of building overpasses for both crossroads at a later date. Due to a high number of accidents at these two roads, construction on the current configuration began in 1966. Also as first constructed, the interchanges at each end of the route only consisted of two ramps; a third ramp was added to the eastern end before the highway opened, and the interchange at the western end was converted to a full interchange in 1979. A new pair of bridges over the St. Joseph River and adjacent Morrison Channel opened in part in 1976 and in full in 1977, replacing bridges built in 1909 and 1911, and were named and dedicated the following month. A planned relocation south of St. Joseph, proposed as late as 1979, was never built. US 33 was truncated in 1986, removing it from BL I-94 and replacing it with M-63 the following year when signage was updated. The Great Lakes Circle Tours were approved by the Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT) and its counterparts in Minnesota, Ontario and Wisconsin. In 2016, the section of the business loop concurrent with M-63 was dedicated as part of the West Michigan Pike Pure Michigan Byway. The interchange at the eastern terminus is planned to be rebuilt as part of the completion of the St. Joseph Valley Parkway (US 31 relocation). Major intersections Kalamazoo Business Spur Interstate 94 (BS I-94) is a state trunkline highway that forms a business spur for from near downtown Kalamazoo to the I-94 freeway. The western terminus is on the far-eastern edge of the city, where BS I-94 intersects the western end of M-96. BS I-94 follows Amvets Memorial Parkway, a four-lane expressway to its eastern terminus at I-94's exit 81. On December 7, 1959, the I-94/US 12 freeway opened on the south side of Kalamazoo. When US 12 was shifted to follow the new freeway, the former route through downtown Kalamazoo was redesignated Business US Highway 12 (Bus. US 12). The next year, it was renumbered Business Loop I-94 (BL I-94). In 1963, the US 131 freeway opened on the west side of Kalamazoo. Along with the creation of Bus. US 131 along a portion of the BL I-94 routing, BL I-94 was rerouted along the US 131 freeway on the west end back to I-94. The section of Stadium Drive west of US 131 and the 9th Street routing was removed from BL I-94. Kalamazoo and the newly built Michikal avenues were transferred to state jurisdiction in 1965. Afterards, Kalamazoo and Michigan avenues were used as a pair of one-way streets downtown. Kalamazoo and Michikal were then signed as westbound BL I-94 from Stadium Drive to Michigan Avenue while Main Street and Michigan Avenue continued to serve eastbound traffic. The City of Kalamazoo accepted jurisdiction of the trunklines within the city's downtown from MDOT in January 2019; and several highway changes were made as a result. BL I-94 was removed from the US 131 freeway and Stadium Drive, although a section of the latter has been retained by the state as an unsigned highway. The rest of the BL I-94 routing along Stadium Drive, Main Street, Michigan and Kalamazoo Avenues and King Highway was turned over to city control and removed from the state highway system. A short section of King Highway west of the M-96 junction was retained by the state as an unsigned highway, leaving the section of BL I-94 from M-96 east to I-94 as a signed highway, albeit renamed to BS I-94 to reflect the fact that it no longer reconnects to I-94 on both ends. Major intersections Battle Creek Business Loop Interstate 94 (BL I-94) is a state trunkline highway serving as a business loop from I-94 through downtown Battle Creek. The highway begins at exit 92 on I-94 near the Kalamazoo‚ÄìCalhoun county line. BL I-94 runs concurrently along M-37 northwesterly from the freeway on the two-lane Columbia Avenue on the eastern edge of Fort Custer. At an intersection south of the W.K. Kellogg Airport, BL I-94/M-37 turns easterly to run on the southern side of the airport. At the airport's southeaster corner, the business loop intersects M-96 and turns northward, merging onto M-96. BL I-94/M-37/M-96 follows Helmer Road on the eastern edge of the airport to Dickman Road. At Dickman, M-37 turns westerly and BL I-94 turns easterly on a road that is four lanes wide with a center turn lane. From there, the business loop follows West Dickman Road along a four-lane divided highway (except between 24th and 20th streets) through a residential area on the northern side of Battle Creek. Dickman Road turns southeasterly as a five-lane undivided highway through downtown Battle Creek, parallel to a curve in the Kalamazoo River near its confluence with the Battle Creek River. BL I-94 skirts the edge of downtown by turning southward and then eastward to cross the Kalamazoo River. On the eastern side of the river, the business loop intersects I-194/M-66. East of the freeway interchange, Dickman Road narrows to three lanes and ends at Main Street. BL I-94 turns northwesterly along Main Street, northeasterly along Hamblin Avenue and then southeasterly on Michigan Avenue on the eastern side of downtown. BL I-94 follows the three-lane Michigan Avenue, narrowing to two lanes east of Porter Street. BL I-94 rejoins M-96 at an intersection with Columbia Avenue in Emmett Township near the Kalamazoo River. BL I-94/M-96 (Michigan Avenue) runs concurrently as a three-lane roadway through Emmett Township. The center turn lane drops southeast of Wattles Road, and the business loop continues to its eastern terminus at exit 104 on I-94. In late 1940, a southerly bypass of downtown Battle Creek opened. U.S. Highway 12 (US 12) was rerouted out of downtown to follow Columbia Avenue. The former route was redesignated Business US Highway 12 (Bus. US 12). In 1958 or 1959, a section of the route of Bus. US 12 was split onto a one-way pairing of streets through downtown Battle Creek. On December 7, 1959, the southern I-94/US 12 bypass of Battle Creek was dedicated and opened to traffic. The former routing of US 12 along Columbia Avenue was turned over to local control and the route of Bus. US 12 was extended via Michigan Avenue easterly and M-78 (Capitol Avenue) southerly to connect to the new freeway. Later the next year, this business loop was redesignated BL I-94. When the first segment of I-194 opened in 1961, BL I-94/M-78 was rerouted to follow the freeway. In 1964, the western end of the business loop was realigned to follow Dickman Road west to Fort Custer and south along Skyline Drive to I-94. The next year, as I-194 was completed and M-78 was replaced by an extended M-66, BL I-94 was rerouted through the downtown area. From Dickman Road, BL I-94 followed I-194/M-66 north to the end of the freeway at Hamblin Avenue and turned along Hamblin to Michigan Avenue via Jay Street. A minor realignment in 1970 shifted the connection between Hamblin and Michigan avenues. The one-way setup through downtown was removed in 1984. M-96 and M-37 were extended in 2000, running concurrently between Skyline Drive and the Helmer Road intersections. M-89 replaced part of M-37 but did not follow the latter's routing to I-194/M-66 near downtown. Then in 2008, BL I-94 was removed from the northern segment of I-194/M-66 freeway and rerouted to follow Dickman Road to Main Street back to Hamblin Avenue. To expand the blast radius for ammunitions testing at Fort Custer, MDOT rerouted the business loop and M-37 to run along the southern and eastern edges of the airport instead of following roads on the opposite sides. This change was completed in 2015. Major intersections Marshall Business Loop Interstate 94 (BL I-94) is a state trunkline highway serving as a business loop from the I-94 freeway through downtown Marshall. The highway begins at a cloverleaf interchange in Marshall Township between I-94 and I-69, exit 108 on the former and exit 38 for the latter. The business loop turns southward running concurrently with I-69. At the interchange with M-96 about south, BL I-94 departs the fourl-lane freeway to follow Michigan Avenue northeasterly along a four-lane divided highway. Near the city limits, the highway intersects M-227 and then turns due east along a four-lane undivided street. Within the city limits, Michigan Avenue is a Pure Michigan Byway named Marshall's Territorial Road. The western half of Michigan Avenue in the city is mostly a residential neighborhood. The intersection with Kalamazoo Avenue is a roundabout around the Brooks Memorial Fountain. East of Kalamazoo Avenue, Michigan Avenue passes through the middle of downtown Marshall. East of downtown, Michigan Avenue once again passes through residential neighborhoods, narrowing to three lanes. The street angles northeasterly at the intersection with Gordon Street. At the intersection with the two-lane Partello Road in Marengo Township, BL I-94 turns northerly off Michigan Avenue past several businesses to its eastern terminus at I-94's exit 112. The first business loop in Marshall was a Business US Highway 12 (Bus. US 12) that was designated in 1960 after the I-94/US 12 freeway was completed north of the city. It followed US 27 (Kalamazoo Avenue) to Michigan Avenue. From there, Bus. US 12 followed the current routing of BL I-94 along Michigan Avenue and Partello Road. The business route was redesignated as BL I -94 in late 1961. The section of BL I-94 along US 27 (Kalamazoo Avenue) became Bus. US 27 with the completion of the I-69/US 27 freeway bypass in 1967. BL I-94 was rerouted and cosigned with Bus. US 27 along Michigan Avenue and the new freeway on the west end. The concurrency with Bus. US 27 was removed in 1972. On January 11, 2001. BL I-94 inside the city of Marshall was designated as a Michigan Heritage Route (now called a Pure Michigan Byway). Major intersections Albion Business Loop Interstate 94 (BL I-94) is a state trunkline highway serving as a business loop from the I-94 freeway through downtown Albion. The highway begins at exit 121 on I-94. The access from westbound I-94 is through a right-in/right-out connection on the north side of the freeway to C Drive North. State maintenance starts at the end of those ramps to C Drive North and runs to Eaton Avenue where the business loop turns southward to cross the freeway. The northern end of the business loop on Easton Avenue has five lanes (two in each direction with a center turn lane) running through a commercial area next to the freeway and continues with four lanes through residential neighborhoods southward to an intersection with M-199 (Austin Avenue). BL I-94 turns southeasterly along four-lane Austin Avenue for two blocks and then southward onto four-lane Superior Street. About five blocks farther south in downtown Albion, BL I-94 intersects M-99. The two highways turn eastward running concurrently along four-lane Michigan Avenue out of downtown. East of downtown, BL I-94/M-99 passes through residential areas and turns northeasterly at the intersection with Clark Street, narrowing to two lanes. The more rural section of Michigan Avenue carrying the business loop crosses into Parma Township in Jackson County. At exit 124 on I-94, BL I-94 ends and M-99 continues northward. The I-94/US 12 freeway in opened in Calhoun County in 1960. At this time, Eaton Avenue was transferred to state control, and the rest of the former route of US 12 through Albion was redesignated Business US Highway 12 (Bus. US 12). Later that year, Bus. US 12 was redesignated BL I-94. Major intersections Jackson Business Loop Interstate 94 (BL I-94) is a state trunkline highway that serves as a business loop from the I-94 freeway through downtown Jackson. The western end is at exit 138 on I-94 west of Jackson in Blackman Township. This interchange is also the eastern terminus of M-60 and the two run concurrently southward along a section of four-lane freeway west of the Jackson County Airport. BL I-94/M-50 form a wrong-way concurrency; eastbound BL I-94 is also westbound M-60. Less than a mile (1.6 km) south of I-94, BL I-94 turns eastward onto the two-lane Michigan Avenue running south of the airport. East of Laurence Avenue, the street widens to include a center turn lane. The business loop then passes the Westwood Mall southeast of the airport and west of downtown; west of the mall, Michigan Avenue drops the center turn lane and widens to four lanes. At an intersection with West Avenue, BL I-94 merges with Business U.S. Highway 127 (Bus. US 127) and M-50. On the western edge of downtown Jackson, traffic follows a one-way pairing of three-lane streets that form a loop around the center of the business district. The southern half carrying BL I-94 east/Bus. US 127 south/M-50 east follows Washington Avenue, and the northern half follows Louis Glick Highway. East of downtown, Cooper Street rejoins the two sides of the loop. South of the loop, Cooper Street carries Bus. US 127 south/M-50 east and north of the loop, it carries M-106. BL I-94 departs the loop north of the Grand River crossing near the Amtrak train station on the five-lane Michigan Avenue. The business loop continues northeasterly through the east side of Jackson in a commercial area. East of Page Avenue, the center turn lane drops and returns east of Dettman Road. BL I-94 crosses US 127 in Leoni Township. East of that freeway, it follows two-lane Ann Arbor Road past the campus of East Jackson High School. The highway turns more northerly through a rural section of Jackson County. It is bounded by fields interspersed with some businesses. Ann Arbor Road turns eastward to run parallel to the south side of I-94 near Gilletts Lake. A connector, Sargent Road, intersects Ann Arbor Road to tie the business loop northward into an interchange with I-94 at exit 145. The US 12 bypass of Jackson was partially completed in late 1951 or early 1952. US 12 turned south along US 127 (Lansing Road) at the end of the freeway to connect back to the existing routing of US 12 through the west end of town. The former routing along Ann Arbor Road and Michigan Avenue into downtown to US 12/US 127/M-50/M-60 became Business US Highway 12 (Bus. US 12) at this time. The bypass of Jackson was extended west to Parma in 1953. BUS US 12 was rerouted along US 127/M-50/M-60 on West Avenue to connect back to US 12. The last routing change to Bus. US 12 with the opening of the M-60 bypass of Jackson by the middle of 1961. Bus. US 12 was extended westward along Michigan Avenue to the new freeway west of town in Blackman Township and northerly to a new western terminus at I-94/US 12. The business loop was redesignated BL I-94 in late 1960. In 1964, several changes were made to the business routes in downtown Jackson. Eastbound BL I-94 traffic was shifted off Michigan Avenue along Blackstone Street to Washington Avenue, and from there it ran along Washington to Francis Street and back to Michigan Avenue. The westbound traffic was shifted north at Mechanic Street to Pearl Street, continuing until turning south at Blackstone back to Michigan Avenue. The eastern end was updated further in 1968 to use Louis Glick Highway to connect to the northern half of the loop around downtown to Michigan Avenue. A set of connector streets on the western side of the downtown loop opened in November 1969 to streamline the flow of traffic further resulting in the last changes to the BL I-94 routing in Jackson. Eastbound traffic was redirected to the connector on Michigan Avenue just east of Third Street. This connector curved south then east to Washington Avenue near First Street. Louis Glick Highway was extended west from Blackstone curving south to merge into Michigan. In 2012, the eastern terminus of the business route was shifted easterly to follow Ann Arbor and Sargent roads to exit 145 on I-94; as a result, the former partial interchange between I-94 and Ann Arbor Road which formerly served as the business route's eastern terminus was obliterated. Major intersections Ann Arbor Business Loop Interstate 94 (BL I-94) is a business loop running from the I-94 freeway through downtown Ann Arbor. It starts at exit 172 on I-94 near on the western side of the city and follows four-lane Jackson Road easterly through a residential area and under I-94 before passing through a commercial area next to Veterans Memorial Park. East of the park, the business loop runs east-northeasterly along Jackson Road through residential areas to a Y-intersection with Dexter Road and Huron Street. BL I-94 follows the four- lane Huron Street eastward into downtown Ann Arbor. At the intersection with Main Street, Business US Highway 23 (Bus. US 23) turns onto Huron Street, and the two designations run concurrently, adding a center turn lane to Huron Street for a few blocks. The business loop passes to the north of University of Michigan's Central Campus and then turns southward through it on the five- lane Washtenaw Avenue. near Forest Avenue at the edge of campus, BL I-94/Bus. US 23 turns southeasterly through residential neighborhoods and drops the center turn lane again. At the intersection with Stadium Boulevard, Washtenaw Avenue turns more easterly, adds a center turn lane again and crosses County Farm Park. East of the park, BL I-94/Bus. US 23 runs through a commercial area out to US 23\\\\. At exit 37 on US 23, Bus. US 23 ends and BL I-94 turns southward along US 23\\\\. The business loop follows the four-lane freeway southward through a residential area on the edge of Ann Arbor and ends at exit 180 on I-94. Washtenaw Avenue facing east The business loop follows the former routing of US 12\\\\. This routing was first designated as M-14 in 1956 when US 12 was moved to a freeway bypass to the south of town. I-94 was first designated by the middle of 1960 along the US 12 freeway, and a new BL I-94 designation was created by the middle of the next year. BL I-94 followed M-14 from the Jackson Road interchange to Main Street along Jackson Road and Huron Street. At Main Street, BL I-94 turned along US 23 on Huron Street, Washtenaw Avenue and Carpenter Road back to I-94/US 12. The US 23 freeway was finished on November 2, 1962. BL I-94 was rerouted on the east end to follow the new US 23 freeway, returning the Carpenter Road alignment to local control. Bus. US 23 replaced US 23 along Huron Street and Washtenaw Avenue in the city of Ann Arbor at this time. A new M-14 freeway opened on November 16, 1965, removing the M-14 concurrency from the routing. Major intersections Port Huron Business Loop Interstate 94 (BL I-94) is an business loop serving the cities of Marysville and Port Huron. It starts southwest of Marysville near St. Clair County International Airport at exit 266 on I-94. The highway runs northeasterly along five-lane Gratiot Avenue past several businesses near the exit. BL I-94 enters Marysville and passes through the city's downtown area. On the eastern side of the city, the business loop turns northward along the four-lane divided Gratiot Boulevard near the St. Clair River. The intersection where the business loop turns is also the northern terminus of M-29. North of Ravenswood Road, BL I-94 splits into the one-way pairing of two-lane Military Street (northbound) and Electric Avenue (southbound). This area is mostly residential running along the river. Electric Avenue merges back into Military Street, which widens to four lanes, near Beard Street. At the intersections with Oak Street (eastbound) and Griswold Street (eastbound), BL I-69 merges in from those two one-way streets. BL I-69/BL I-94 continues northward along Military Street through downtown Port Huron. The business loop crosses the Black River near its mouth. North of the river. the business loop follows Huron Avenue through the northern side of downtown Port Huron. At the intersection with Glenwood Avenue, BL I-69/BL I-94 turns northwesterly onto Pine Grove Avenue through a residential area on the northern side of the city. The street has five lanes (two in each direction plus a center turn lane). The business loop passes under I-94/I-69 at the toll and customs plazas for the Blue Water Bridge. There is a partial interchange to connect the business loop to and from the eastbound direction of the freeway and the toll plaza. North of the freeway crossing, the business loop intersects the southern end of M-25 and turns westward onto Hancock Street for two blocks. Then it turns southward along a connector freeway to terminate at an interchange with westbound I-94/I-69. Before the completion of the freeways in the Port Huron area, the route of the business loop was part of US Highway 25 (US 25). After the freeway was completed in the area, the former route was redesignated Business US 25 (Bus. US 25) in 1964. The US 25 designation was decommissioned in 1973, and the former Bus. US 25 through the area was designated as part of an extended M-25. In 1986, the BL I-94 designation was created, and the former BS I-69 was extended with it through downtown Port Huron. At the same time, M-25 was truncated to end on the north side of Port Huron.

He has also been involved in several other music projects such as Strictly American and Dodd Ferrelle and the Tinfoil Stars. Career In early 1979, Crowe and his friend Bill Tabor sat and listened to Michael Lachowski and Randy Bewley play the same riff over and over in their practice space which was below his apartment in downtown Athens-the original 40 Watt Club-named for a single bulb on a wire that hung overhead. Crowe went downstairs and knocked on their door and offered his services as a drummer. He had played drums since he was a little boy and one of his dreams was to someday play in a band. The sound of the band came together after he joined and Vanessa Briscoe Hay came aboard as the vocalist. Pylon played several parties and caught the attention of the B-52's who helped them obtain a booking in New York City which was the major goal of the band at the time. After opening for the Gang of Four on their first two United States tour dates, Pylon was able to keep returning to play dates in the northeastern United States and began to record for DB Records in Atlanta, Georgia. They opened for the B-52's in Central Park, toured England in late 1980 and released their first album Gyrate. Crowe came up with the idea, after seeing some of the clubs that existed in the Northeast, that it was possible to open your own club without too much effort or money, so with the help of his friend Paul Scales, the 40 Watt Club opened in downtown Athens above Yudy's Subs in what had been something called the \\"Crow's nest\\". The club proved to be very popular and the floor had to be reinforced with portable beams for all the heavy dancing taking place overhead. Pylon recorded another album and two singles and broke up in 1983 after touring with U2 for a few of the dates on their first American tour. Pylon was becoming too much like a business for some of the members' tastes, so it was agreed to break up and they did. Crowe married and settled down and finished school. Athens, GA inside/out was released and there seemed to be more interest in Pylon than ever. Pylon reformed, but this time with more business-like practices in place. They recorded another album and toured with R.E.M. and the B-52's. They had a manager. But Pylon broke up again. Crowe and his wife went on to have two children and he began to work in the film/TV industry as a construction coordinator. He has worked on films like Blue Crush, where he was responsible for \\"the rock\\", Cool Runnings and more recently, the first season of Lost, We are Marshall and Californication. He is now divorced, but maintains an amiable relationship with his former wife and children. Pylon reformed for fun from 2005 to 2009. DFA Records reissued Gyrate on CD, Pylon's first album with bonus tracks, and called it Gyrate Plus.

The film centers on a female meteorologist who gains superpowers and is later inducted into the \\"Justice League\\", while the city of New Metro is held for ransom by a terrorist armed with a weather control device. The film is interjected with mock-interviews of members of the Justice League, speaking about life as a superhero in the past tense, preceding the events of the film. Plot The protagonist, Tori Olafsdotter, is a meteorologist working at the Eno Meteorological Institute who will later become Ice. The city of New Metro is faced with a tornado controlled by a terrorist calling himself the Weatherman. The Flash dissipates the tornado using his super speed while the other members of the JLA use their powers to save civilians. Tori stumbles upon a hidden device in the lab where she works. While investigating its use, she spills water on it and it strikes her with strange blue electricity. She is unharmed and leaves the lab for home freezing everything she touches. En route she sees a man drowning; when she attempts to rescue him, the water freezes around her. The JLA, believing her to be the Weatherman, abduct and interrogate her. They release her and Tori believes it was all simply a bad dream. The JLA suspect that Tori's timid colleague Arliss Hopke is The Weatherman. New Metro is attacked again, this time by golf ball-sized hailstones, but Fire melts them all. The JLA infiltrate a party at the Eno Meteorological Institute looking for evidence that Arliss Hopke is The Weatherman. Tori however discovers that it is her boss, Dr. Eno, who is The Weatherman. Tori takes this knowledge to the JLA and they in turn take her to their secret command center, an alien spacecraft hidden underwater. The JLA's leader J'onn J'onzz introduces himself to Tori and the other members of the League reveal their secret identities. Tori discovers that The Atom is a man with whom she has been flirting. The JLA attempt to train Tori to hone her freezing powers without much success. Martin Walters, a young man who has been pursuing B.B. DaCosta romantically, watches a news broadcast about the JLA and sees that Fire is wearing earrings that he gave B.B. as a gift. Martin tells B.B. that he knows her secret identity. B.B. secretly alerts the JLA, and J'onn takes the shape of Fire and appears before Martin and B.B. \\"Fire\\" claims that B.B. is a close friend who lent \\"her\\" the earrings. Martin is embarrassed by his \\"mistake\\", and B.B. gently terminates his romantic interest in her, although she assures him that he's a nice guy and that he will find true love someday. The Weatherman demands $20 million or he will engulf New Metro in a tidal wave. He attacks the Watchtower using a heat ray. The JLA escape and devise a plan to stop the Weatherman, leaving Tori behind. They are unsuccessful, but Tori stops it by freezing the tidal wave solid. The other heroes apologize for leaving Tori behind, and offer her membership again, including a costume and the codename \\"Ice\\". Tori forgives them and agrees to their offer. Meanwhile, the Weatherman plans his escape from prison.

Living by the Word. The Christian Century. Chicago: Sep 4, 2007. Vol. 124, (18) pg. 18-19. or museum, has in collaboration and empowerment within online communities. Specifically, it pertains to the use of blogs, wiki and online social networking platforms by organizations to cultivate relationships with an online community that then can provide feedback and direction for the organization's interest. The organization 'trusts' and uses that input in its management. One of the first appearances of the notion of radical trust appears in an info graphic outlining the base principles of web 2.0 in Tim O'Reilly's weblog post \\"What is Web 2.0\\" . Radical Trust is listed as the guiding example of trusting the validity of consumer generated media. This concept is considered to be an underlying assumption of Library 2.0. The adoption of radical trust by a library would require its management let go of some of its control over the library and building an organization without an end result in mind. (Harris, 2006). The direction a library would take would be based on input provided by people through online communities. These changes in the organization may merely be anecdotal in nature, making this method of organization management dramatically distinct from data-based or evidence based management. In marketing, Collin Douma further describes the notion of radical trust in the article \\"Radical Trust\\" August 28, 2006 Marketing Magazine (Canada) as a key mindset required for marketers and advertisers to enter the social media marketing space. Conventional marketing dictates and maintains control of messages to cause the greatest persuasion in consumer decisions. Given the proliferation of peer-to-peer consumer reviews and other social media platforms that enable consumer generated media, marketing agencies can no longer control the skew of that information. Marketers who are creating and participating in online platforms to facilitate conversation are radically trusting the consumer to build the brand based on the experience that is most relevant to them.
