Main Components  In the special drive system developed by the captioned joint-venture project, the basic power source is a liquid-cooled proton exchange membrane fuel cell (Proton‚Äôs ‚ÄúPM Basic A 50‚Äù fuel-cell system). Lead- gel batteries and ultracapacitors are the additional power sources.  Modes of Operation  Like other fuel cell powered vehicle, the proton exchange membrane fuel cell in this drive system uses hydrogen to produce electric power to motor. When the vehicle is stationary, the proton exchange membrane fuel cell recharges both the lead-gel batteries and the ultracapacitors. During peak energy requirements the lead-gel batteries and ultracapacitors provide additional electric power, in parallel to the proton exchange membrane fuel cell, to the motor. During braking, energy, the regenerative braking energy, is captured in the lead-gel batteries and the ultracapacitors.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1974. History The nation began to focus on good roads at the start of the 20th century. Arkansas did not yet have a state highway commission and instead left the task of building and maintaining good roads to individual road districts, which consisted of area farmers and residents without central leadership and in many cases engineering experience. One district, Jefferson County Road Improvement District No. 4, decided to construct a concrete road from Pine Bluff, Arkansas, north to the Pine Bluff ‚Äì Little Rock wagon road at the Jefferson County line. Dollarway pavement The roadway was paved in wide concrete slabs, poured in a 1-2¬Ω-5 mixture. The concrete was topped with a layer of coal tar about 1/16 inch thick. At the edges were 45 degree slopes, which means only of the width was level, with the slopes acting as curbs. Further out from the center was of gravel and of earthwork. The gravel shoulder allowed vehicles to continue on the road without stopping for oncoming traffic, which was common at the time. During the construction of the Toronto-Hamilton Highway, a steam shovel was used to remove two miles of Dollarway pavement. The Ann Arbor City Engineer wrote in 1917 about the durability of Dollarway construction. > As I said before, after the completion of the first pavement, the people > were very enthusiastic about this type of pavement. It continued to grow in > favor in 1910 and 1911 ; then the tide commenced slowly to turn. It became > evident to all that it was necessary to recarpet the concrete every two or > three years, in some cases, varying with traffic conditions, even every > year. Those who owned automobiles did not like the throwing up of the tar > and sand on the under side of the fenders. In some places, where the > carpeting peeled off. the concrete commenced to ravel, and sections, varying > in size, had to be cut out and replaced with better material. It was then > realized that reducing the first cost to a minimum had caused a heavy burden > of maintenance and repair. These pavements must be kept carpeted to preserve > the concrete underneath as long as possible. Tradition holds that the road was called Dollarway because it cost one dollar per linear foot to construct. The final cost was closer to $1.36 per foot. In July 1913, Little Rock, Arkansas contractors Shelby and Bateman were chosen to construct the approximately 23-mile road. Construction began in November 1913, and the road was finished in October 1914. The Dollarway Road was the longest continuous concrete pavement in the United States when complete. Today The original 1974 National Register listing boundary placed the Dollarway within a park near Redfield. In 1999 the listing was enlarged to add a portion of the Dollarway still used today as Reynolds Road. This segment also contains two original Dollarway concrete bridges.

Richard Strauss in 1886 Background =Original title and dedication= The work's original title was Scherzo in D minor, and it was written for Hans von B√ºlow, who had appointed Strauss assistant conductor of the Meiningen Orchestra.Madison Symphony Orchestra Program Notes However, von B√ºlow considered it a \\"complicated piece of nonsense\\" and refused to learn it. He said the piano part was \\"Lisztian\\" and \\"unplayable\\", particularly for a pianist with a small handspan (Strauss says that von B√ºlow could barely reach an octave). Strauss rehearsed the work with the Meiningen Orchestra, conducting and playing the solo part himself, but then set it aside. He wrote to von B√ºlow: \\"[G]iven an outstanding (!) pianist, and a first-rate (!) conductor, perhaps the whole thing will not turn out to be the unalloyed nonsense I took it for after the first rehearsal. After the first run-through, I was totally discouraged.\\" =Renaming, rededication and premiere= In 1889, Strauss became acquainted with Eugen d'Albert, who liked the work, although he suggested some cuts and changes to the piano part. Strauss rededicated the revised work to d'Albert, who premiered it under its new title Burleske, at a convention of the General German Music AssociationSan Francisco Symphony at Eisenach on 21 June 1890, in the same concert as the premiere of Strauss's Death and Transfiguration. The word \\"Burleske\\" translates as \\"farce\\"Midi Classics or \\"mockery\\". =Reaction= Von B√ºlow was still not impressed. In a letter to Johannes Brahms in January 1891, he wrote: \\"Strauss's Burleske decidedly has some genius in it, but in other respects it is horrifying.\\"Naxos Despite this, he conducted the work that month in Berlin, with Eugen d'Albert as soloist. Strauss was offered a handsome sum by a publisher for the rights to the work, but he was still not convinced of its merits, so he declined. He was no doubt influenced in his own opinion of the work by von B√ºlow's opinion of it. A quarter of a century later he wrote about von B√ºlow: \\"For anyone who ever heard him play Beethoven or conduct Wagner, who attended one of his piano lessons or observed him in orchestra rehearsal, he inevitably became the model of all the shining virtues of a performing artist, and his touching sympathy for me, his influence on the development of my artistic abilities, were the decisive factors in my career.\\" Publication However, in 1894, Strauss agreed to publication of the Burleske, although it took him a long time to regard it with great favour. It eventually became one of his favourite works, and he programmed it in his last concert in London with the Philharmonia Orchestra in September 1947, along with Don Juan, the Symphonia Domestica and the waltzes from Der Rosenkavalier. Strauss never allocated an opus number to the work, but the opus number 11 has often come to be associated with it, although Strauss gave that number to his Horn Concerto No. 1 in E. It appears as number 85 in the catalogue by Erich Herrmann Mueller von Asow, and number 145 in that by Franz Trenner (see List of compositions by Richard Strauss#Other works). Other premieres The first performance of the Burleske in the United States was by Heinrich Gebhard with the Boston Symphony Orchestra, under Wilhelm Gericke, in April 1903. The first performance in Australia was by Vera Bradford in 1937, with the Melbourne Symphony Orchestra conducted by Georg Schn√©evoigt. Schn√©evoigt considered the piano part manageable only by a male pianist, and demanded Vera Bradford be replaced; but she stood her ground and gave a celebrated performance. Structure and scoring The piece starts with a theme introduced on timpani and answered by the orchestra. The piano then enters in a state of high excitement. A second, more lyrical Brahmsian theme emerges, followed by waltz-like measures not unlike the waltzes from Der Rosenkavalier. The work ends quietly, again on the timpani. It takes about 20 minutes to perform. The piece is scored for piano solo and an orchestra of piccolo, 2 flutes, 2 oboes, 2 clarinets in B-flat, 2 bassoons, 4 horns (2 in F, 2 in D), 2 trumpets, timpani, and strings., published by Steingr√§ber Verlaug, Leipzig; Bowerman & Co, London; Edw.

Procentrioles are generally assembled canonically in association with pre-existing centrioles that are loosely connected to each other. The environment suitable for procentriole formation is provided by the base of each centriole. Procentrioles assemble perpendicular to existing centrioles. A cylindrical structure with a diameter around 130 nm forms at the onset of assembly. Free microtubules elongate the initial cylindrical structure of procentrioles to form centrioles. An alternative way of procentriole assembly has also been discovered. Instead of forming in the vicinity of pre-exisintg centrioles, this ‚Äúde novo‚Äù pathway is activated during ciliogenesis, in which many procentrioles are synthesized in a single cell from electron-dense areas of the cytoplasm. This discovery was made through observation after removing the pre-existing centrioles using laser microbeam. However, studies indicate that procentriole assembly via the canonical pathway is more stable for proliferating cells.

Society would then be directed by a hereditary aristocracy composed of descendants from the Crusaders, the heroes of the Revolution, the great criminals, the financial and industrial magnates\\" (p. 360). Carrel proposed that: > We must single out the children who are endowed with high potentialities, > and develop them as completely as possible. And in this manner give to the > nation a non-hereditary aristocracy. Such children may be found in all > classes of society, although distinguished men appear more frequently in > distinguished families than in others. The descendants of the founders of > American civilization may still possess the ancestral qualities. These > qualities are generally hidden under the cloak of degeneration. But this > degeneration is often superficial. It comes chiefly from education, > idleness, lack of responsibility and moral discipline. The sons of very rich > men, like those of criminals, should be removed while still infants from > their natural surroundings. Thus separated from their family, they could > manifest their hereditary strength. In the aristocratic families of Europe > there are also individuals of great vitality. The issue of the Crusaders is > by no means extinct. The laws of genetics indicate the probability that the > legendary audacity and love of adventure can appear again in the lineage of > the feudal lords. It is possible also that the offspring of the great > criminals who had imagination, courage, and judgment, of the heroes of the > French or Russian Revolutions, of the high-handed business men who live > among us, might be excellent building stones for an enterprising minority. > As we know, criminality is not hereditary if not united with feeble- > mindedness or other mental or cerebral defects. High potentialities are > rarely encountered in the sons of honest, intelligent, hard-working men who > have had ill luck in their careers, who have failed in business or have > muddled along all their lives in inferior positions. Or among peasants > living on the same spot for centuries. However, from such people sometimes > spring artists, poets, adventurers, saints. A brilliantly gifted and well- > known New York family came from peasants who cultivated their farm in the > south of France from the time of Charlemagne to that of Napoleon. Eugenics Carrel endorsed voluntary positive eugenics. He wrote: > We have mentioned that natural selection has not played its part for a long > while. That many inferior individuals have been conserved through the > efforts of hygiene and medicine. But we cannot prevent the reproduction of > the weak when they are neither insane nor criminal. Or destroy sickly or > defective children as we do the weaklings in a litter of puppies. The only > way to obviate the disastrous predominance of the weak is to develop the > strong. Our efforts to render normal the unfit are evidently useless. We > should, then, turn our attention toward promoting the optimum growth of the > fit. By making the strong still stronger, we could effectively help the > weak; For the herd always profits by the ideas and inventions of the elite. > Instead of leveling organic and mental inequalities, we should amplify them > and construct greater men. He continued: > The progress of the strong depends on the conditions of their development > and the possibility left to parents of transmitting to their offspring the > qualities which they have acquired in the course of their existence. Modern > society must, therefore, allow to all a certain stability of life, a home, a > garden, some friends.

Carrel advocated euthanasia for the criminally insane, and the death penalty for dangerous criminals. He specifically advocated the use of gasses. > \\"(t)he conditioning of petty criminals with the whip, or some more > scientific procedure, followed by a short stay in hospital, would probably > suffice to insure order. Those who have murdered, robbed while armed with > automatic pistol or machine gun, kidnapped children, despoiled the poor of > their savings, misled the public in important matters, should be humanely > and economically disposed of in small euthanasic institutions supplied with > proper gasses. A similar treatment could be advantageously applied to the > insane, guilty of criminal acts.\\" His endorsement of this idea began in the mid-1930s, prior to the actual implementation of Nazi euthanasia policies in 1939 (Aktion T4). In the 1936 German introduction of his book, at the publisher's request, he added the following praise of the Nazi regime which did not appear in the editions in other languages: > \\"(t)he German government has taken energetic measures against the > propagation of the defective, the mentally diseased, and the criminal. The > ideal solution would be the suppression of each of these individuals as soon > as he has proven himself to be dangerous.\\"As quoted by Andr√©s Horacio > Reggiani: God's eugenicist.

He was a member of the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) and a former member of its National Executive. Life and career Vishwas was born on 10 February 1970 in a middle class family in the town of Pilkhuwa in Uttar Pradesh, where he studied at Lala Ganga Sahay School. His father, Chandra Pal Sharma, was a lecturer at R.S.S. Degree College in Pilkhuwa and his mother, Rama Sharma, was a housewife. Vishwas is the youngest child and has four brothers and a sister. He studied at the Rajputana Regiment Inter College and then joined Motilal Nehru Regional Engineering College because his father wanted him to become an engineer. However, engineering did not interest Vishwas and he left it to study Hindi literature, in which he subsequently earned a PhD. It was while studying for his PhD that Vishwas changed his name from Viswas Kumar Sharma to Kumar Vishwas, to maintain an identity separate from his caste. In 1994, he became a lecturer in Rajasthan, then taught Hindi literature at Lala Lajpat Rai College. In 2012, he joined the newly-formed AAP as a volunteer worker. Vishwas hosts a comedy show called KV Sammelan on the Aaj Tak television channel that first premiered on 29 September 2018. He is married to Manju Sharma, with whom he has two daughters. =As a poet= Vishwas routinely gives performances in which he demonstrates his poetry and love for Hindi, Urdu and Sanskrit literature. He incorporates his comments on topical issues relating to India. He has participated in poetry recitations and functions abroad including the US, Dubai, Oman, Singapore and Japan. =Anti-corruption movement and politics= Vishwas has known Arvind Kejriwal since 2005 and joined the India Against Corruption movement led by Anna Hazare. Thereafter, as the movement faded and morphed into what is today known as the AAP, led by Kejriwal, he was asked to become a member of its national executive. He contested the 2014 Lok Sabha election as an AAP candidate from Amethi, but lost to then incumbent Rahul Gandhi, securing only 25,000 votes. Media Vishwas has been a guest judge on the Indian Idol television show and a guest on Zee TV's talent hunt show Sa Re Ga Ma Pa Li'l Champs. He wrote the songs \\"De De Jagah\\" for the 2018 Hindi film Parmanu: The Story of Pokhran and \\"Veer Bhagat Singh\\". Vishwas was a guest in 1 July 2017 episode of The Kapil Sharma Show along with Rahat Indori and Shabinaji. He was a guest again on 21 September 2019 episode of The Kapil Sharma Show along with Manoj Bajpai and Pankaj Tripathi. He also presented Tarpan, a musical poetry series, where he would recite poems of famous historical poets, against a background of music. =Controversies= A sting operation was carried out by a tabloid media portal called \\"Media Sarkar\\" ahead of the 2013 Delhi Assembly elections that claimed that some AAP members, including Vishwas and Shazia Ilmi, had raised illegal cash donations. The AAP accused the portal of slandering the leaders of the party. Mediasarkar.com and AAP filed cross complaints against each other. The police promised action after a thorough investigation. As elections approached, a doctored video clip from a Kavi sammelan went viral in which he was shown making alleged derogatory remarks about Imam Hussain and Hindu deities and nurses from Kerala. As a result, various cases were registered against him. Vishwas responded that the clippings were doctored and later apologised for his remarks, saying it was not his intention to hurt anyone's sentiments or feelings. In 2016, Vishwas was accused by a campaign volunteer of molestation and making \\"sexually coloured\\" remarks. The courts ordered a FIR to be registered because of the complaint but an investigation by Delhi Police found no significant evidence to substantiate it. In July 2017, Vishwas was accused of copyright infringement by Amitabh Bachchan in relation to a posting on YouTube of a poem by his father Harivansh Rai Bachchan. The video was taken down and a compensation of Rs. 32 was paid. This was around the same time that he was embroiled in a dispute within the AAP, which he had threatened to quit. On 23 March 2019, Vishwas was served with a legal notice by Amritsar based advocate, NPS Hira, for allegedly cracking jokes on the Sikh community in a demeaning manner in a programme organized at NIT ground Faridabad on 15 March 2019. Hira also warned Vishwas of criminal complaint if he fails to visit Sri Akal Takht Sahib and apologize.

Despite its appearance, it is not a plant; it is a heterokont. Giant kelp is common along the coast of the eastern Pacific Ocean, from Baja California north to southeast Alaska, and is also found in the southern oceans near South America, South Africa, Australia, and New Zealand. Individual algae may grow to more than long at a rate of as much as per day. Giant kelp grows in dense stands known as kelp forests, which are home to many marine animals that depend on the algae for food or shelter. The primary commercial product obtained from giant kelp is alginate, but humans also harvest this species on a limited basis for use directly as food, as it is rich in iodine, potassium, and other minerals. It can be used in cooking in many of the ways other sea vegetables are used, and particularly serves to add flavor to bean dishes. Description M. pyrifera is the largest of all algae. The stage of the life cycle that is usually seen is the sporophyte, which is perennial and individuals persist for many years. Individuals may grow to up to long or more. The kelp often grows even longer than the distance from the bottom to the surface as it will grow in a diagonal direction due to the ocean current pushing against the kelp.Hoek et al. 1995, p. 201 The stalks arise from a holdfast and branch three or four times from near the base. Blades develop at irregular intervals along the stipe, with a single pneumatocyst (gas bladder) at the base of each blade.Kain 1991 A related and similar-looking, but smaller species, M. integrifolia, grows to only to long. It is found on intertidal rocks or shallow subtidal rocks along the Pacific coast of North America (British Columbia to California) and South America.Abbott & Hollenberg 1976AlgaeBase: Species: Macrocystis integrifolia In New Zealand M. pyrifera is found in the subtidal zone of southern North Island, the South Island, Chatham, Stewart, Bounty, Antipodes, Auckland and Campbell Islands. The species can be found on rock and on sheltered open coasts. Growth Juvenile Macrocystis pyrifera, Whaler's Cove (Point Lobos State Reserve) M. pyrifera is one of the fastest-growing organisms on Earth.Fenner, Bob The Brown AlgaeWhite & Plaskett 1982, page 8 They can grow at a rate of a day to reach over long in one growing season.Cribb 1953Davis 1991, p. 21 Juvenile giant kelp grow directly upon their parent female gametophyte. To establish itself, a young kelp produces one or two primary blades, and begins a rudimentary holdfast, which serves to anchor the plant to the rocky bottom. As the kelp grows, additional blades develop from the growing tip, while the holdfast enlarges and may entirely cover the rock to which it is attached. Growth occurs with lengthening of the stipe (central stalk), and splitting of the blades. At the growing tip is a single blade, at the base of which develop small gas bladders along one side. As the bladders and stipe grow, small tears develop in the attached blade. Once the tears have completed, each bladder supports a single separate blade along the stipe, with the bladders and their blades attached at irregular intervals.Mondragon & Mondragon 2003Prescott 1968, pp.226-227 Ecology M. pyrifera is found in North America (Alaska to California), South America, South Africa, New Zealand, and southern Australia.AlgaeBase: Species: Macrocystis pyrifera It thrives in cooler waters where the ocean water temperature remains below . The species is also found near Tristan da Cunha in the Mid-South Atlantic Ocean. Where the bottom is rocky and affords places for it to anchor, giant kelp forms extensive kelp beds with large \\"floating canopies\\". When present in large numbers, giant kelp forms kelp forests that are home to many marine species that depend upon the kelp directly for food and shelter, or indirectly as a hunting ground for prey. Both the large size of the kelp and the large number of individuals significantly alter the availability of light, the flow of ocean currents, and the chemistry of the ocean water in the area where they grow.Lobban & Harrison, p. 158 In high-density populations, giant kelp individuals compete with other individuals of the species for space and resources. Giant kelp may also compete with Pterygophora californica in these circumstances.Reed 1990Reed et al. 1991 Where surface waters are poor in nutrients, nitrogen in the form of amino acids is translocated up the stipe through sieve elements that very much resemble the phloem of vascular plants.Lobban & Harrison, pp. 151-153Hoek et al. 1995, p. 204 Translocation of nutrients along the stipe may be as rapid as per hour. Most translocation occurs to move carbon-rich photosynthate, and typically transfers material from mature regions to actively growing regions where the machinery of photosynthesis is not yet fully in place. Translocation also moves nutrients downward from light-exposed surface fronds to sporophylls (reproductive fronds) at the base of the kelp, where there is little light and thus little photosynthesis to produce food.  Aquaculture  M. pyrifera has been utilized for many years as a food source;Abbott 1996Gutierrez et al. 2006 it also contains many compounds such as iodine, potassium, other minerals vitamins and carbohydrates and thus has also been used as a dietary supplement.Bushing 2000Connor 1989, p. 58 In the beginning of the 20th century California kelp beds were harvested as a source for soda ash.Abbott 1996Neushul 1987Druehl et al. 1988 With commercial interest increasing significantly during the 1970s and the 1980s this was primarily due to the production of alginates, and also for biomass production for animal feed due to the energy crisis during that period.Neushul 1987Druehl et al. 1988Gerard 1987 However the commercial production of M. pyrifera never became reality. With the end of the energy crisis and the decline in prices of alginates, the research into farming Macrocystis also declined. The demand for M. pyrifera is increasing due to the newfound uses of these plants such as fertilizers, cultivation for bioremediation purposes, abalone and sea urchin feed.Buschmann et al. 2006 There is current research going into utilizing M. pyrifera as feed for other aquaculture species such as shrimps.Cruz et al. 2009 Recently, M. pyrifera has been examined as a possible feedstock for conversion into ethanol for biofuel use.Wargacki et al. 2012  Conservation  In recent years, the kelp forests have decreased dramatically throughout Japan, Chile, Korea, Australia and North America. Harvesting of kelp as a food source and other uses may be the least concerning aspect to its depletion. The natural phenomena El Ni√±o cycles warm, tropical water from the South Pacific to Northern waters. This has been known to kill off M. pyrifera, due to its need for cold waters it would usually find in the North Pacific Ocean. In California, El Ni√±o also brought along a population bloom of purple sea urchins which feed on the giant kelp. By the late 2000s most of the onshore giant kelp in California was practically nonexistent. Off the coast of Tasmania, kelp forests have been significantly affected by several factors including warming waters, shifting of the East Australian current, and invasion of long-spine sea urchins. Locals have noticed significant effects on the population of abalone; a food source for the aboriginal peoples for thousands of years. These changes have also affected the oyster farming industry. By saving oysters that have survived disease outbreaks, they have been able to continue their way of life. Scientists and conservationists are continuously looking into ways to restore the once heavily populated M. pyrifera to its original state. Methods include artificial reefs, reducing numbers of purple sea urchins in overpopulated areas, and planting roots along the ocean floor.

Helped by the French guitar player Eddy Santacreu, bassist Matt Hunter, rhythm guitarist Luke Cuerten and Chris Brown on drums, they formed the band Koritni in 2006. Mixing 70's hard rock and American sleaze rock, the band doesn't hide its preferences for bands such as Aerosmith, Guns N'Roses, Van Halen or AC/DC. In 2007, Koritni released their first full-length album Lady Luck, praised by the press, Lady Luck was mixed by Mike Fraser (AC/DC, Aerosmith and Van Halen). Following the release of the album, the band undertook a European tour. Early 2009, the band released their second album, Game of Fools, again mixed by Mike Fraser, the album is still in a hard rock vein that made them successful. Koritni is considered with bands like Airbourne or The Answer as the rebirth of hard rock.

History The Prize was inaugurated in Bordeaux in 1984 by French lawyer Bertrand Favreau, to recognise lawyers of any Bar or nationality whose work furthered the defence of human rights, the supremacy of law, or resistant to intolerance and racism. The prize is awarded after consultation with international NGOs and humanitarian organizations. It commemorates the memory of the French lawyer, Ludovic Trarieux (1840‚Äì1904), who in the midst of the Dreyfus Affair, in France, in 1898, founded the Ligue des droits de l'homme (LDH), \\"Human Rights League\\"). The first prize was awarded, on 29 March 1985, to South African leader Nelson Mandela, during his imprisonment. His daughter, Zenani Mandela Dlamini, received the award on Mandela's behalf on 27 April 1985. It was the first award given to Mandela in France, and the first internationally to have been awarded to him by lawyers. Since 2003 the Prize has been awarded jointly by several institutions: the Human Rights Institute of The Bar of Bordeaux, the Human Rights Institute of the Bar of Paris, the Human Rights Institute of The Bar of Brussels, l'Unione forense per la tutela dei diritti dell'uomo (from Rome), the Bar of Amsterdam, Geneva and Luxemburg, the Berlin Bar Association, the Union Internationale des Avocats (UIA) and the European Bar Human Rights Institute (IDHAE), an organization representing human rights lawyers across Europe. During the last decades, the Prize was presented by Robert Badinter (1998), Guy Canivet (2002), Dean Spielmann (2006), Emma Bonino (2008), Viviane Reding (2011, etc. The 17th Ludovic Trarieux International Human Rights Prize 2012 was awarded to Muharrem Erbey (Turkey, in jail since December 2009, and presented to his wife, Bur√ßin Erbey, in Berlin by German minister of Justice Sabine Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger on 30 November 2012.

His previous research specialized in human genetics and evolutionary genetics, especially human sex chromosome evolution and the genetic basis that underlies the evolutionary expansion of the human brain. Lahn's current research interests include stem cell biology and epigenetics.Lahn's Lab Website  Biography  Bruce Lahn is a Chinese-born American scientist. He currently works at the University of Chicago. In the past he has studied human genetics and evolutionary genetics. His main objective with previous studies was to study the evolution of human sex chromosomes and the underlying basis for the growth of the human brain. Lahn is currently doing a wide spread of stem cell research as well as working with epigenetics. Lahn's previous research has led to the hypothesis that the Neanderthals contributed to evolution of the human brain's size. Lahn is currently working to contribute a better understanding of the widespread use of stem cells to the science world.  Research interests  Lahn has quite a few study interests, including, Human Genetics, Evolutionary Genetics, stem cell biology, and epigenetics. Human Genetics is the study of the inheritance patterns passed from parents to offspring in humans. Human Evolutionary Genetics is the study of how one genome is different from another which leads to evolutionary developments. Stem Cell Biology is the study of cells capable of evolving into any of the different specialized cells. Epigenetics is the study of changes within an organism due to a change in the gene expression itself rather than a change in the genetic code.  Contributions to science  His research on the microcephaly-associated gene, MCPH1, led to the hypothesis that an archaic Homo sapiens lineage such as the Neanderthals might have contributed to the recent development of the human brain.Could interbreeding between humans and Neanderthals have led to an enhanced human brain? Howard Hughes Medical Institute, November 6, 2006 His research also suggested that newly arisen variants of two brain size genes, ASPM and MCPH1, might have been favored by positive natural selection in recent human history.Lahn‚Äôs analysis of genes indicates human brain continues to evolve This research provoked controversy due to the finding that the positively selected variants of these genes had spread to higher frequencies in some parts of the world than in others (for ASPM, it is higher in Europe and surrounding regions than other parts of the world; for MCPH1, it is higher outside sub-Saharan Africa than inside).Scientist's Study Of Brain Genes Sparks a Backlash. June 16, 2006. Wall Street Journal. Accessed 2015-04-07. He has advocated the moral position that human genetic diversity should be embraced and celebrated as among humanity's great assets. Lahn has many different studies with stem cells that he is currently working on. They range anywhere from looking at if the suicide gene can be modified with stem cells, to looking at stem cells as a potential source to treat testicular dysfunctions.

In this capacity, he was regarded as de facto the second most powerful member of the cabinet, but lost political influence by 2018. He also served as Mayor of H√≥dmez≈ëv√°s√°rhely from 2002 to 2012.  Career  He started his career as a law apprentice at city council of H√≥dmez≈ëv√°s√°rhely at 1995. He was personal secretary at the Hungarian Parliament at 1999. He joined Fidesz in 2000. He became both a Parliament representative and mayor of H√≥dmez≈ëv√°s√°rhely at 2002, following the death of his mentor Andr√°s Rapcs√°k. In 2002, he became a member of the Christian Democratic People's Party (KDNP) too. He became leader of the Fidesz parliamentary group after the 2010 election, succeeding Tibor Navracsics in this position. L√°z√°r was appointed Secretary of State of Prime Minister's Office on 2 June 2012, as a result he resigned from the office of mayor of H√≥dmez≈ëv√°s√°rhely. He was replaced by Antal Rog√°n as head of the Fidesz parliamentary group on that day. L√°z√°r was elected one of the four vice- presidents of Fidesz in September 2013, replacing Mih√°ly Varga. He held that party office until December 2015. L√°z√°r was promoted to Minister of the Prime Minister's Office following the 2014 parliamentary election. On 27 July 2020 he was elected President of the Hungarian Tennis Association. Controversy On 18 November 2010 J√°nos L√°z√°r criticized strongly the former President of the Constitutional Court of Hungary, L√°szl√≥ S√≥lyom in an interview published in N√©pszabads√°g In March 2011 In the recording posted on the Internet, L√°z√°r as mayor of H√≥dmez≈ëv√°s√°rhely could be heard telling the city council in 2008 that \\"those people who have nothing are worth just that\\". Addressing a press conference, L√°z√°r said, '\\"I would like to apologise to Hungary for my ambiguous and misunderstood statement. I would like to apologise to all who feel hurt by that\\". He said that his remark had not referred to the poor but to those who were unsuccessful in their profession but embarked on a political career merely with the purpose of making a livelihood and for financial gains. L√°z√°r also said the remarks were parts of a longer speech and out of their original context. The three opposition parties slammed the senior Fidesz official for his remarks. L√°z√°r sued the journals, which had claimed that he used these words in connection with the poor. The verdict of the Court of the city of Eger found that L√°z√°r was right, and the record was manipulated. On 12 May 2014, a Hungarian news website \\"origo\\" published an article about his travels on the Hungarian government's budget, which led L√°z√°r to pay back 2 million forints to the state budget.

He was one of the foremost scholars in the field of Austronesian linguistics, publishing extensively on the reconstruction of Proto-Austronesian phonology and on subgrouping within the language family, the latter principally by means of lexicostatistics. The youngest son of a rabbi and his wife who had immigrated from Kiev, Ukraine, \\"Iz\\" (as he was known to friends) grew up speaking Yiddish at home and studying Hebrew at Gratz College in preparation for rabbinical training. However, during the course of earning a B.A. in 1933, an M.A. in 1934, and a Ph.D. in 1939 at the University of Pennsylvania, his interests shifted to comparative linguistics. After completing a dissertation on \\"The Sanskrit indeclinables of the Hindu grammarians and lexicographers\\" he planned to specialize in Slavic languages, but the needs of the U.S. Army during World War II drew him into languages in the Pacific Theater of Operations. He learned Malay well enough to teach it to troops headed for the Southwest Pacific and to produce a 2-volume pedagogical text, Spoken Malay (1943). After the war, he did fieldwork on two more genetically and typologically disparate Austronesian languages, Chuukese (rendered as \\"Trukese\\" at that time) and Yapese, as a member of the Tri-Institutional Coordinated Investigation of Micronesian Anthropology sponsored by Yale University, the University of Hawaii, and the Bernice P. Bishop Museum. Out of this came his A Sketch of Trukese grammar (1965). At the same time, he began applying his comparative method to revise and elaborate phonological reconstructions that had earlier been published by Otto Dempwolff (1934-38). A series of articles such as \\"The Malayo-Polynesian word for ‚Äòtwo‚Äô\\" (1947), \\"The Tagalog reflexes of Malayo- Polynesian D\\" (1947), \\"Proto-Malayo-Polynesian *Z\\" (1951), and \\"Dempwolff‚Äôs *R\\" (1953), eventually culminated in a monograph, The Proto-Malayo-Polynesian laryngeals (1953). His application of the same methods to his own new data from Chuukese led to a monograph On the history of the Trukese vowels (1949), which brilliantly demonstrated how the nine vowels of Chuukese had derived quite regularly from the four-vowel system Dempwolff had reconstructed for Proto-Austronesian.

It is named after the German astronomer Johannes Franz Hartmann (1865‚Äì1936), who developed it around 1900.  Theory and practice  Every part of a mirror or lens produces the same image as the whole optical element. The light is focused in the focal point. The light rays, however, go through different points of a plane before or behind the focus. This phenomenon can be used when focusing a telescope. The Hartmann mask is a simple opaque mask containing two or three holes. (This device is called a Hartmann mask if it has multiple holes, or a Scheiner disk if it has two holes.http://www.astropix.com/HTML/I_ASTROP/FOCUS/METHODS.HTM#HM) The mask covers the aperture of the telescope. When the apparatus is out of focus, multiple images can be seen if the telescope is pointed towards a bright light source (Moon, bright star). Adjusting the focuser, the images can be made to overlap, forming a single bright, clear picture. The mask may also be used to check the figure of a mirror, as the holes in the mask should all produce the same image.

History In early 1978, producer Norman Lear felt his long-running comedy Maude was getting stale, so he decided to enliven things by moving the show to Washington, D.C., and making the title character a congresswoman. After two episodes in this new setting, star Beatrice Arthur decided not to continue, and the show abruptly left the air. Lear, however, still believed in the concept and filmed a new pilot titled Onward and Upward, with essentially the same script and cast‚Äîexcept with John Amos (as a black former professional football star running for the United States Congress) replacing Arthur. Creative differences between Amos (who had co-starred in Lear's Good Times) and the producers led to the actor bowing out; the show was renamed Mr. Dooley and finally Mr. Dugan. Cleavon Little (best known as the sheriff in the classic movie comedy Blazing Saddles) was hired as the title character, a fledgling black congressman. The supporting cast remained the same. Mr Dugan was seen in newspaper TV listings nationwide just a few days before it was pulled by CBSMr. Dugan had been scheduled for a March 11, 1979, premiere, and was heavily promoted by CBS, complete with ads and listings in TV Guide and other publications. However, a special screening for real black members of Congress proved to be an unmitigated disaster, as several members of the Congressional Black Caucus criticized the show. The sitcom was especially galling for freshman Congressman William Gray III, who, like the fictional Dugan, was a former football star who represented a district in Philadelphia: \\"The impact would be disastrous, showing a congressman who was a silly, incompetent man ruled by his staff.\\" Lear subsequently pulled the plug on Mr. Dugan, saying, \\"we have not yet totally fulfilled our intention for the series.\\" The concept was eventually reworked again into the short-lived series, Hanging In, which aired on CBS in the summer of 1979.

Sharpe joined Manchester United from Torquay United as a youngster in 1988, playing for the club up until 1996. He won a total of eight caps for England, but his later career failed to live up to its potential after leaving Manchester United in his mid-twenties. Sharpe moved to Leeds United in 1996, but persistent knee injuries kept him from making an impact on the squad, and he was loaned to Sampdoria at the start of the 1998‚Äì99 season. Another loan to Bradford City in March 1999 turned into a permanent deal at the end of the season. He stayed at Bradford for three seasons, but he gradually slipped down the league ladder, eventually moving to Iceland to play for Grindav√≠k in 2003. He retired from professional football in 2003, but achieved renewed fame after a number of reality television appearances. He briefly returned to football in 2004, playing for Garforth Town, but his return was short-lived. Club career =Torquay United= Sharpe, who was born in Halesowen, Worcestershire, was an Aston Villa supporter, but began his career at Torquay United. He played 14 times for the Gulls in the 1987-88 season as they achieved a secure finish in the Football League Fourth Division, and didn't turn 17 until just after the season's end. He was soon the radar of First and Second Division clubs and was sold to Manchester United in June 1988 for ¬£200,000, a record fee at the time for a YTS player. =Manchester United= Sharpe made his debut for Manchester United on 24 September 1988 in a 2‚Äì0 win over West Ham United in the Football League First Division, aged 17. His first team chances increased in November with the departure of the club's first choice left winger Jesper Olsen, and were further enhanced when new signing Ralph Milne performed inconsistently. Sharpe ended the 1988‚Äì89 season with 22 league appearances to his name, although he failed to score and United finished a disappointing 11th in the league a year after finishing second. He played 30 games in all competitions that season, and was on the shortlist for the PFA Young Player of the Year award, which was won by Arsenal winger Paul Merson. The following season, Sharpe found the net for the first time in a United shirt, scoring in the 5‚Äì1 home win over Millwall on 16 September 1989. He managed 18 appearances in the league that season (and 20 in all competitions), but failed to make the squad for the FA Cup final which United won 1‚Äì0 against Crystal Palace in a replay after drawing 3‚Äì3 in the first match. Alex Ferguson had chosen new signing Danny Wallace as his first choice left winger for the 1989‚Äì90 season. He played a key part in United's success in the European Cup Winners' Cup in 1990‚Äì91 scoring with a left-foot shot into the top corner in the home leg of the semi-final against Legia Warsaw (1‚Äì1). He also famously scored a hat-trick against Arsenal at Highbury in the League Cup fourth round on 28 November 1990, a match which United won 6‚Äì2. Sharpe himself cites this as one of the best memories in his footballing career. He was now United's first choice left winger ahead of Danny Wallace, although a new rival for the left wing position was emerging in the shape of highly promising 17-year-old Ryan Giggs. Having established himself as a left winger, Sharpe earned a call up to the England squad just before his 20th birthday, although he was unable to replace John Barnes as first choice left winger. He was then out of the game for long periods of time through injury and illness (he suffered from viral meningitis in the autumn of 1992) and when his fitness recovered, the form of Ryan Giggs meant he had normally to play out of position at left back (by now the preferred position for Denis Irwin) or on the right wing, competing for a place with Andrei Kanchelskis who had arrived in March 1991. His first team opportunities were limited by injury and by the form of Giggs in the 1991-92 season, although he did appear as a substitute in the Football League Cup final victory over Nottingham Forest. He did play in enough games to collect a Premier League title medal for the 1992‚Äì93 season, and added another in 1993‚Äì94 with 30 appearances (four as a substitute), and scoring nine league goals (11 in all competitions). He scored both of United's goals in their fourth league game of the season on 23 August 1993 as they beat Aston Villa 2‚Äì1 at Villa Park, following with an early goal in the 3‚Äì1 win at Southampton in the next game. He managed another double on 22 March 1994 in a 2‚Äì2 league draw at Arsenal, and came on as a substitute in the FA Cup final against Chelsea. United won the double of the Premier League title and FA Cup that season. Sharpe is well remembered for his memorable goal against Barcelona during the 2‚Äì2 draw in the 1994‚Äì1995 Champions League season's group stage, when he spectacularly back-heeled a cross from Roy Keane into the corner of the net. He also got an assist in this game, crossing for Mark Hughes, who headed the first goal of the game. 1994‚Äì95 was a difficult season for United, with many players out for significant periods due to injury. Sharpe was one of them, as he missed a string of mid season games due to a fractured ankle, though he had more opportunities to play on the left wing as Ryan Giggs missed a quarter of the campaign due to injuries. He also made a number of appearances as left-back as the regular player in that position, Denis Irwin, spent most of the campaign playing on the right side of defence left vacant by a long absence by Paul Parker, though Irwin was back at left-back towards the end of the season following the emergence of right-back Gary Neville. United ended the season without a major trophy, finishing second to Blackburn Rovers in the Premier League as they failed to manage anything better than a 1‚Äì1 draw at West Ham on the final day of the season, and losing 1‚Äì0 to Everton in the FA Cup final. By the start of the 1995‚Äì96, Andrei Kanchelskis had been sold to Everton and it seemed possible that Sharpe could establish himself as United's right winger ‚Äì particularly when he scored twice for United in their 3‚Äì2 win over Everton on 9 September 1995. With Ryan Giggs returning to fitness on the left wing, and Denis Irwin returning to left back following the emergence of Gary Neville as the club's regular right back, the right hand side of midfield seemed Sharpe's best opportunity of regular first team action. However, 20-year-old David Beckham made the first team breakthrough that season and left Sharpe facing a fresh battle for a regular place in the first team, though he was selected in the squad for all but eight competitive games that season, during which United became the first English team to win the double twice. He still took to the field in 31 out of 38 Premier League games, scoring four goals. His first goal of the season came at Blackburn Rovers on 28 August, as a relatively strong United side recorded their third successive league win after being beaten by Aston Villa on the opening day. In their next game at Everton on 9 September, Sharpe scored twice as United achieved an impressive 3‚Äì2 win. His next (and final) league goal for United came on 10 February 1996 when he scored the only goal of the game against Blackburn Rovers, as United kept up the pressure on leaders Newcastle who had been 10 points ahead at Christmas. Sharpe also managed two FA Cup goals that season, the winner against Manchester City in the fifth round at Old Trafford on 18 February, and the second in the last minute of a 2‚Äì0 home win over Southampton in the quarter finals on 11 March. He was selected as a substitute in the 1‚Äì0 FA Cup final win over Liverpool on 11 May, but did not come onto the pitch, though he still picked up his second FA Cup winner's medal, which was ultimately the last major trophy of his career just before his 25th birthday. In total he played 265 games for Manchester United over eight years, scoring 36 goals and winning a total of seven major trophies. =Leeds United= After eight years at Old Trafford, he became Leeds United's joint record signing on 10 August 1996 when they paid ¬£4.5million for his services, making him the last signing by manager Howard Wilkinson, who was sacked the following month to be succeeded by George Graham. Again his time at Leeds was beset by further injuries. He made 26 Premiership appearances in 1996‚Äì97, scoring five goals, but a pre-season knee injury ruled him out for the entire 1997‚Äì98 season and he was unable to regain his place in the team on recovery. In the autumn of 1998, Graham's successor David O'Leary loaned Sharpe to Italian Serie A strugglers Sampdoria, where he played under English head coach David Platt, but soon fell out of favour and in the New Year he returned to England. =Bradford City= He signed on loan for Bradford City in March 1999 and he helped in securing the club's promotion to the Premiership after 77 years outside the top division. He joined Bradford in a ¬£250,000 deal during the summer and helped preserve the club's Premiership status in 1999‚Äì2000. =Portsmouth= In 2000‚Äì01, Sharpe lost his place in the Bradford team and just before Christmas went on loan to Division One Portsmouth. He played 17 matches. He returned to Bradford during the 2001‚Äì02 season but when his contract expired at the end of the season he was given a free transfer. =Exeter City= Following a brief trial stay with Grimsby Town in the summer of 2002 he was snubbed a contract with the Mariners and he eventually signed for Exeter City. During his time at Exeter he scored once against Hull City. This would prove to be Sharpe's final spell in English senior football at the age of 31. =Grindavik= He then moved to Grindav√≠k in Iceland. In June 2003 he announced his retirement from professional football at the age of 32. Just before this, he was rumoured to be on the verge of taking over as player- manager at Bury in Division Three. =Garforth Town= In February 2004, Sharpe made a brief return to football in the Kidderminster Sunday League with Hoobrook Crown before signing for Northern Counties East Premier League side Garforth Town the following summer. International career Sharpe was capped eight times by England between 1991 and 1993.

By the mid-1990s, these players, some of whom had become known as Spice Boys, had become icons in football already, in an era when football stars had become idols on par with rock stars and pop stars.url=\\"\\" Sharpe was known for his lifestyle off the pitch as much as he had on it at the time, though these endorsement deals quieted down after he left Manchester United in 1996. Lee was engaged to model Emma Padfield for 9 'months before she split with him and dated Lee Bowyer. Since 2009, Sharpe has been involved with global football charity, Ambassadors in Sport. His first involvement came after a trip to South Africa and an unscheduled invite to visit an AIS Hope Academy in a South African Prison. Since then he has been involved at different levels with AIS, including Cycle for Hope, a 6-month cycle through Africa which Sharpe was involved in publicity and also took part in the last leg. Television career Sharpe has also developed a career in reality television. He appeared as a competitor in the 2005, ITV television show Celebrity Wrestling, under the name \\"Sharpe Shooter\\". He is also known though for appearing in Celebrity Love Island. During his time on the Island Sharpe courted the attentions of many of the show's ladies, most notably TV presenter Jayne Middlemiss, who confessed to \\"never having felt like this before about someone\\", but Sharpe eventually dated Abi Titmuss. In 2007 Sharpe appeared as a contestant in ITV's Dancing on Ice. He was eliminated from the competition on 3 March 2007. He was to also appear in ITV's popular TV soap Coronation Street as an extra in the fictional pub \\"The Rovers Return\\" as a working class taxi driver from Manchester. Sharpe, alongside former Bucks Fizz singer Cheryl Baker, currently fronts a London Underground advertising campaign for Nourkrin, a baldness treatment. He is billed as \\"Of Celebrity Love Island fame!\\" In 2008, Sharpe starred in Dec's team on Ant versus Dec, on Saturday Night Takeaway ITV1. Sharpe also starred as the celebrity 'hider' in an episode of the CBBC show Hider in the House. He also appeared in the 2008 television series Superstars on Channel Five. In August 2009, he appeared in the RT√â One celebrity boxing series, Charity Lords of the Ring. Media career After retirement in 2004 and 2006, Sharpe became a football pundit for ESPN Star in Singapore in Asia, and together with Les Ferdinand, is a celebrity host on the game show \\"Kickoff\\" where he is known as \\"Sharpey\\". Sharpe was previously a pundit on BBC's Match of the Day 2 and Football Focus, and during the 2006 World Cup presented a cup blog from Germany with video clips and photos for Yahoo. Sharpe appeared in one episode of the footballing drama Dream Team. Sharpe was one of the football pundits hired by Abu Dhabi Sports Channel, for their exclusive coverage of the Premier League.

Life He was son of Thomas Creighton and Margaret Stuart, who claimed kinship with the ancient Lords of Ruthven, and was born at Dunkeld, Perthshire. He was educated at Westminster, and in 1613 was elected to Trinity College, Cambridge. He proceeded M.A. in 1621, and on 27 February 1622 was one of the opponents in a disputation held before the Spanish ambassador, Don Carlos Coloma. In 1625 he was made Regius Professor of Greek, and on 27 February 1627 succeeded his friend, George Herbert, as public orator of the university, holding both these offices until 1639. In 1628 he was incorporated M.A. at Oxford. On 18 March 1631 he was installed prebendary in the cathedral of Lincoln, and on 17 December of the following year he was made canon residentiary of Wells, holding also a living in Somerset, and the treasurership of Wells Cathedral, to which he was appointed by Archbishop George Abbot during the vacancy of the see. In 1637 he held the deanery of St. Burians in Cornwall, and in 1642 was vicar of Greenwich. At the outbreak of the First English Civil War he retired to Oxford, where he was made D.D. and acted as the king's chaplain, later holding the same office under Charles II. On the fall of Oxford he escaped into Cornwall in disguise and embarked for the continent. He was a member of the court of Charles II in his exile, and John Evelyn (who attests to his learning) heard him preach at St. Germain on 12 August 1649, and subsequently at the Restoration at the Chapel Royal, St. Paul's Cathedral and an 'extravagant' sermon given before the House of Commons on 27 April 1663 at St. Margaret's, Westminster. During his exile the king appointed him Dean of Wells. On entering on this office at the Restoration he found the deanery in the hands of Cornelius Burges, who refused to surrender it. Creighton brought a legal action of ejectment to obtain possession of it. He helped restore the cathedral from the dilapidated state into which it had fallen, partly by mischief done in 1642 and partly by neglect. On 22 June 1663 Creighton took the oaths for his naturalization in England. On 25 May 1670 he was elected bishop of Bath and Wells and consecrated 19 June following. He died on 21 November 1672, and was buried in St. John's Chapel in his cathedral. His marble tomb and effigy had been prepared by himself at great expense. Works Creighton published Vera Historia Unionis inter Graecos et Latinos sive Concilii Florentini exactissima narratio, a translation into Latin from the Greek of Sgoropulos, the Hague, 1660, with a long preface; this was answered by the Jesuit Leo Allatius In R. Creygtoni apparatum versionem et notas, Rome, 1674 (earlier editions of both these works must have appeared), and to this Creighton made a reply, ultimately enhancing his reputation more in continental Europe than in Great Britain. Family Lectern given to Wells Cathedral by Robert Creighton on his appointment as Dean of Wells in 1660 Some time after 1639, when he was still fellow of Trinity, he married Frances, daughter of William Walrond, who survived until 30 October 1683. By her he had a son Robert Creighton, who was also a court preacher (less effective than his father according to Evelyn).

These were built by Sir Thomas Theophilus Metcalfe, 4th Baronet (1795‚Äì1853), a Civil Servant, when he was the Governor General‚Äôs last British Resident (Agent) at the Mughal Court of Emperor Bahadur Shah Zafar II. The first house near the Civil Lines, called the ‚Äòtown house‚Äô, was built in 1835 in colonial style, near the present day Inter State Bus Terminal (ISBT). He resided there till his death in 1853. It was badly damaged during the 1857 Indian War of Independence (well known as the Uprising). It was repaired subsequently. His son Sir Theophilus Metcalfe (who was deeply involved during British counter offensive to the Uprising) inherited it. The house exchanged hands several times before it finally came under the possession of the Government of India. Between 1920 and 1926, it also remained the seat of the Council of State of the Central Legislative Assembly, which eventually paved way for the present Rajya Sabha, till the inauguration of the Parliament House in New Delhi. It now houses the highly secured offices and residences of the Defence Scientific Information & Documentation Centre (DESIDOC) and Defence Terrain Research Laboratory (DTRL), and many other divisions of the Defence Research & Development Organisation (DRDO). It is out of limits for visitors and photography.Addresses The second Metcalfe House, known as ‚Äòthe retreat‚Äô or ‚ÄòDilkhusha‚Äô, was also built by Sir Thomas Theophilus Metcalfe as a country house in Mehrauli in South Delhi in Qutb Complex. 'Dilkhusha' in Urdu language means \\"Delight of the Heart\\". He refurbished the 16th century Mughal tomb of Quli Khan in true English style as a pleasure retreat by surrounding it with many rest houses, follies and gardens. He used to lease out his retreat as a guest house to honeymooning couples, as it provided an idyllic view of the Qutub Minar with its surrounding structures. An inscription at site (photo of plaque in the gallery) testifies that Metcalfe rented out this house to honeymooning couples. The town house Metcalfe built his town house, close to the Yamuna River on its right bank, on the old Metcalfe road, now rechristened as Mahatma Gandhi Road, in the heart of the Old Delhi. It was also known as ‚ÄòJahan Numa‚Äô meaning \\"World Showing\\". The workers who built this mansion and attendants at Metcalfe's house called it \\"Matka Kothi\\", ('Metcalfe' pronounced as \\"Matka\\" and ‚ÄòKothi‚Äô means \\"House\\" in Hindi language) a corrupted version; for them the name ‚ÄòMetcalfe House‚Äô was a tongue twister. Built as a huge palatial house in European style (colonial style), it had Indian adaptations of high ceiling and small windows and doors to suit local climatic conditions. It was built as a counter to the Mughal Emperor‚Äôs Red Fort Palace close by. It was built as a double storied mansion with a large but an impressive fa√ßade (that is stated to have been substantially changed in 1913). It had creative underground passageways, one of which was used as a billiards room (pictured). The mansion was surrounded by well manicured garden of cypress tree lined pathways, flowerbeds, orange groves, roads and a swimming pool. The doors of the regal building were festooned with mistletoe and holly. Different views of Metcalfe‚Äôs palatial town house. Pictures from the album Reminiscences of Imperial Delhi compiled and presented by Metcalfe to his daughter Emily The wide verandah, encircling the main building on all sides, was supported on impressive stone columns. Inventive underground rooms called the tykhanas were used for cool comforts during the summer season and for playing billiards. A library with 25,000 books and a Napoleon gallery with relics of Napoleon were part of the displays in the large building, apart from beautiful oil paintings and rosewood Georgian furniture. However, during the Uprising of 1857, there was extensive damage to the buildings, all the documents and displays. It is said that Metcalfe had bought the land for building his town house from Gujjars and the same Gujjars ransacked and damaged it during the Upraising in 1857. Theophilus Metcalfe, son of Sir Thomas Metcalfe (died 1853), named as the \\"One-eyed Metcalfe\\" due to his monocle, was the city magistrate during the Uprising. He was accused of vengeful destruction of the city and reprisals against its residents, particularly Muslims. During the days of its glory, the town house was famous for the high society social gatherings held in its premises. Extravagant Christmas and New Year parties were held here. An album titled 'Reminiscences of Imperial Delhi‚Äô, which had 89 folios with about 130 paintings (a few pictured here) of the Mughal and pre-Mughal period monuments, was compiled by Metacalfe with a transcript written by him to his daughter Emily. In this transcript, he piognantly describes the house and the happy incidents that occurred there. It is better quoted in his own words than paraphrased (the photos also show the manuscript). > In this once happy home you all passed your earliest infancy. With exception > to Emy and Charley all were born here- and all but Charley have received the > initiatory right [sic] of baptism by which Ye were made member of Christ > Children of God and inheritors by promise of the Kingdom of Heaven. To your > father it has been endeared by many years of more‚Ä¶ An unusual tale recounted is of a lavish Christmas Eve party in 1895 held at this house in which a mysterious Englishman was murdered in the antechamber and simultaneously a fire also broke out that destroyed Metcalfe‚Äôs Testimonials. The murder and reasons for the fire are shrouded in mystery. The house was rebuilt in 1913 with Gothic arches but can now be glimpsed from outside only, since it is occupied by the Defense establishment of the DRDO.Delhi city guide, by Eicher Goodearth Limited, Delhi Tourism. Published by Eicher Goodearth Limited, 1998. . Page 220. The Retreat or Dilkhusha Dilkhusha, the Metcalfe House in Qutb Complex built by Metcalfe as a retreat -A Painting from his Folio published in 1843 Metcalfe's summer retreat 'Dilkhusha' as on date in ruins with Qutub Minar in the picture The second house in Mehrauli was initially a tomb of Muhammad Quli Khan, brother of Adham Khan, a general and foster brother of Emperor Akbar. The octagonal Mughal tomb built in the 17th century was bought by Metcalfe and remodeled in the style of European residences with extensive gardens and follies for use as a pleasure resort during the monsoon season. He called it the ‚ÄòDilkhusha‚Äô (also see under External link of the album showing two pictures of Dilkusha as it existed when built). It was spread over a sprawling area, which is now enclosed in a specially developed park called the ‚ÄòQutub Archaeological Village‚Äô. The purpose in building this place was stated to be that Metcalfe wanted to keep a watch on Emperor Bahadur Shah II who also had his Zafar Mahal palace in Mehrauli to spend his summer time. The complex was a pleasant place with several controlled streamlets of water, which led to a tank (now called the Metcalfe‚Äôs Boathouse and Dovecote). The tank was dated to the Lodi Dynasty period. This was refurbished by Metcalfe for use, for boating and swimming. Steps built from the boathouse lead to his Dilkhusha. With a retinue of servants, the immaculately kept place was stated to be an ideal setting for honeymooning couples. He also built, in \\"pseudo Mughal\\" style, a Chhatri (kiosk) or a folly with a dome and arches, and few other follies known as Garhganjs (in the form of a spiral and square stepped ziggurats). All of the above can be seen in the Archaeological Park (a special enclosure created recently), which has strategically placed signages showing directions to the various heritage monuments. This village was created by the Indian National Trust for Art and Cultural Heritage (INTACH), south of the Qutub Minar(see External Link on page 6 for the Map of the Archaeological Village). The retreat had been built like a citadel with the folly (also called the only landlocked light house) in the Indo-Persian baradari style. The folly was built opposite to the remodelleld tomb of Quli Khan, surrounded by a sprawling garden. The central hall of the tomb was converted into a dining hall. Two wings were added as annexes, out of which ruins of only one is seen now. He also converted some of the old buildings around the tomb into guesthouse, staff quarters and stables. It is also recorded that Metcalfe, the fastidious person that he was, spent lot of time at this place during his 40 years of life in Delhi. He loved this retreat and had a set of rooms made for use as a study and also lodgings for his daughter Emily to stay with him, while his wife and son lived in the formal town house in the old city. Thomas‚Äôs fondness for this place is reflected in his own words: > The ruins of grandeur that extend for miles on every side fill it with > serious reflection,‚Äù he wrote. ‚ÄúThe palaces crumbling into dust... the > myriads of vast mausoleums, every one of which was intended to convey to > futurity the deathless fame of its cold inhabitant, and all of which are now > passed by, unknown and unnoticed. These things cannot be looked at with > indifference. During recent restoration works carried out on the tomb, some remains of Hindu temples have been found, though the date of building the tomb is as yet unclear.

Background Ranfurly was the eldest son of Thomas Knox, 1st Viscount Northland, and the Hon. Anne, daughter of John Vesey, 1st Baron Knapton. Political career Ranfurly was elected a member of the Irish House of Commons for Carlingford in 1776, a seat he held until 1783, and then represented Dungannon between 1783 and 1790 and Tyrone between 1790 and 1798. He was also a member of the British House of Commons for County Tyrone from 1806 to 1812. In 1818 he succeeded his father in the viscountcy of Northland, but, as this was an Irish peerage it did not entitle him to a seat in the House of Lords. However, in 1826 he was created Baron Ranfurly, of Ramphorlie in the County of Renfrew, in the Peerage of the United Kingdom, which entitled him and his successors to a seat in the upper chamber of parliament. In 1831 he was further honoured when he was made Earl of Ranfurly in the Peerage of Ireland. Family Lord Ranfurly married the Honourable Diana Jane, daughter of Edmund Pery, 1st Viscount Pery, in 1785. Their second son the Honourable Edmund Knox (1787‚Äì1867) was an Admiral in the Royal Navy. Lady Ranfurly died in November 1839. Lord Ranfurly only survived her by a few months and died in April 1840, aged 85. He was succeeded in his titles by his eldest son, Thomas. His brothers included bishops William Knox and Edmund Knox, George Knox , and Archdeacon Charles Knox.

Before the paper described the KTR, it had been widely accepted in paleontology that new families of dinosaurs evolved during Mid to Late Cretaceous, including the euhadrosaurs, neoceratopsians, ankylosaurids, pachycephalosaurs, carcharodontosaurines, troodontids, dromaeosaurs, and ornithomimosaurs. However, the authors of the paper have suggested that the apparent \\"new diversification\\" of dinosaurs during this time is due to sampling biases in the fossil record, and better preserved fossils in Cretaceous age sediments than in earlier Triassic or Jurassic sediments. A comprehensive molecular study of evolution of mammals at the taxonomic level of family also showed important diversification during the KTR. Similarly, bee pollinator diversification strongly correlates with angiosperm flower appearance and specialization during the same era.

By far, the largest island in the Detroit River is Grosse Ile. The following is a description of islands in the Detroit River. The Detroit River is a river in the Great Lakes system, and it flows for from Lake St. Clair south to Lake Erie. The river serves as a major shipping channel, jointly controlled by the United States and Canada, and is a major component of the Canada‚ÄìUnited States border. Ownership and control of the islands varies by their geographic location along the river. The majority of islands are on the American side of the river, which are all under the jurisdiction of Wayne County in Michigan. The Canadian islands are part of Essex County in Ontario. There are no islands in the Detroit River that are divided by the international border. Most of the islands are very small and uninhabited, and many of these islands around the southern portion of the river serve as wildlife refuges as part of the Detroit River International Wildlife Refuge. The largest and most populous island is Grosse Ile at roughly 9.0 sq mi (23.3 km¬≤) and a population of around 10,000. Most of the islands in the Detroit River are around and closely connected to Grosse Ile. The Michigan city of Gibraltar is also located on several islands in the southern portion of the river. Some of the islands have also been geologically modified throughout the industrialization of the area. For example, Michigan's Stony Island and Canada's Crystal Island have been largely formed from dredged sediments for a deep shipping lane, and Zug Island and Elizabeth Park (Slocum's Island) are artificial islands, as they were once part of the mainland. Michigan =Belle Isle= Downtown Detroit, looking west from Belle Isle. Belle Isle () is a 1.53 sq mi (3.97 km¬≤) island in the northern portion of the Detroit River about one mile (1.6 km) east of Downtown Detroit and one mile (1.6 km) west of Lake St. Clair. It is the northernmost island in the river ‚Äî just barely extending further north than the easternmost island, Peche Island. The whole island is part of Belle Isle Park, except for two small secondary islands leased in 100-year increments in agreement respectively with the privately owned Detroit Yacht Club and to the Detroit Boat Club, the oldest rowing club in North America. It is the largest urban island park in the United States and the third largest island in the river after Grosse Ile and Fighting Island. It is managed by the state of Michigan and is connected to the mainland by the MacArthur Bridge. The entire island itself is listed on the National Register of Historic Places as a historic district. =Calf Island= Calf Island () is a 7-acre (2.83 ha) island just west of Swan Island and Grosse Ile. The island is uninhabited, except for small number of herons. In 2002, Calf Island became part of the Detroit River International Wildlife Refuge. =Celeron Island= Celeron Island () is an 81-acre (33 ha) island located about 0.25 miles (0.4 km) east of Horse Island in the southern portion of the Detroit River near Lake Erie. While Celeron Island is closer to Gibraltar, Michigan, the island is administered by Grosse Ile Township to the north and is the southernmost of all islands in that township. Uninhabited, Celeron Island is technically four closely connected islands. Celeron Island was named for Pierre Joseph C√©loron de Blainville. =Edmond Island= Edmond Island () is a 35-acre (14 ha) island within the city limits of Gibraltar, Michigan. It is one of the main islands of Gibraltar and is densely populated with one main circular road. There is one bridge to the island, and the island is only about 20 feet (6 m) from the mainland. Cherry Island of the Lake Erie Metropark is just south of Edmond Island, although by technical definition, Cherry Island is not an island since its connected to the mainland. =Elba Island= Elba Island () is a narrow 224 acre (91 ha) island just off the east coast of southern Grosse Ile. It is one of the four populated islands at the southern tip of Grosse Ile, and the few houses on this island are very affluent and expensive. =Elizabeth Park= Elizabeth Park () is a 162-acre (65 ha) park located on the shores of the Detroit River in Trenton, Michigan, directly north of the Wayne County Bridge. Elizabeth Park was the first county park established in the state and was part of the former Monguagon Township. While the general area is referred to simply as Elizabeth Park, the island itself is sometimes referred to as \\"Slocum's Island\\" after the original owners, who donated the land to the county in 1919. Slocum's Island itself is much larger than the area belonging to Elizabeth Park, but that name has fallen into disuse. A small portion of the park is on the mainland, but most of it was cut off from the mainland by a small canal. The northern portion of the island belongs to Elizabeth Park, while the portion south of the Wayne County Bridge is occupied by the large Trenton Channel Power Plant. The Battle of Maguaga during the War of 1812 took place in the area. =Fox Island= Fox Island () is a very small 1.6 acre (6.5 ha) island about 1,000 feet (305 m) off the east coast of Elba Island near the southern tip of Grosse Ile. The island, which is a private island administered by Grosse Ile Township, is wooded and uninhabited. =Grassy Island= Grassy Island () is a 72-acre (29 ha) island located just north of Grosse Ile and west of Fighting Island. The closest city to the island is Wyandotte, Michigan. Originally, the island was much smaller, but it served as a disposal facility for millions of cubic yards of sediments that were dredged from the expanding of the River Rouge. Grassy Island is uninhabited and is part of the Detroit River International Wildlife Refuge. Grassy Island should not be confused with another island on the exact opposite side of the river named Grass Island, which part of Ontario. =Grosse Ile= Grosse Ile () , colloquially referred to as the \\"Big Island\\" or the \\"Main Island\\" to distinguish it from the township as a whole, is by far the largest island in the Detroit River at approximately 9.0 sq mi (23.3 km¬≤). While Grosse Ile Township consists of 12 individual islands, the largest of these island is commonly known simply as Grosse Ile. Grosse Ile itself is divided by the narrow Thorofare Channel, but the two segments are geologically the same island. The majority of islands in the Detroit River are within close proximity of Grosse Ile and are administered by the township. There are several small bridges connecting the populated islands on the southern tip, but only Grosse Ile connects to the mainland by the Wayne County Bridge in the middle of the island and the Grosse Ile Toll Bridge on the northern end. The Grosse Ile Municipal Airport is located on the southern end of the island. The township as a whole is one of the most affluent and safest in the state. =Humbug Island= Humbug Island () is an elongated 32 acre (13 ha) island located about 500 feet (152 m) from the mainland just northwest of Calf Island and west of Grosse Ile. The island, which is administered by the city of Trenton, is wooded and uninhabited. It is part of the much larger Humbug Marsh, which was incorporated into the Detroit River International Wildlife Refuge in 2004. =Hickory Island= Hickory Island () is a 132-acre (53 ha) island off the southern tip of Grosse Ile. Hickory Island is the southernmost of the inhabited islands of Grosse Ile Township, in which only the uninhabited Celeron Island is further south. Hickory Island can only be accessed by traveling through Meso Island, and both islands are part of a gated community. It is more densely populated than Meso Island, and the two are separated by a narrow 20 foot (6.1 m) boating channel. =Horse Island= Horse Island () is an elongated 38 acre (15 ha) island. It is the easternmost island of Gibraltar, Michigan, located about 1,200 feet (366 m) west of Celeron Island. Horse Island is connected to the rest of Gibraltar by a 50-foot (15 m) bridge. The island is densely populated and has one road ending in a cul-de-sac. =Mamajuda Island= Mamajuda Island () , sometimes identified as Mama Juda Island, is located just east of the northern tip of Grosse Ile (Hennepin Point) and about 500 feet (152 m) west of the Canada‚ÄìUnited States border. The island is part of Grosse Ile Township. It is the smallest of all charted islands in the Detroit River. The former 30 acre (12 ha) island has since been lost due to erosion. Only a very small portion of it, consisting of a few boulders, appears above water during times of low water levels. The island and its surrounding waters were incorporated into the Detroit River International Wildlife Refuge at its inception in 2001. =Meso Island= Meso Island (), sometimes charted inaccurately as Meso Isle or Mesco Island, is a 121-acre (49 ha) island located about 200 feet (61 m) off the southeastern tip of Grosse Ile. It is one of the four inhabited islands off the southern coast of Grosse Ile and is the least populated of those islands. Meso Island is separated by a very narrow 20 foot (6.1 m) channel from Hickory Island to the south, and the two belong to the same very affluent gated community. Meso Island is also located about 1,000 feet (305 m) west of Sugar Island. =Mud Island= Mud Island, as seen from Ecorse, MichiganMud Island () is a small, uninhabited 18.5 acre (7.5 ha) island about 250 feet (76 m) off the coast of Ecorse, Michigan, and about 0.75 miles (1.21 km) west of the northern tip of Canada's Fighting Island. The island was donated to the Detroit River International Wildlife Refuge by the National Steel Corporation. Mud Island is currently the northernmost island in the refuge. =Powder House Island= Powder House Island (), historically referred to as Dynamite Island, is the second-smallest named island in the Detroit River at approximately 0.2 acres (812 m¬≤). The island is fairly remote and is about one-third mile (.53 km) east of the small Fox Island. Powder House Island is located almost in the center of the Detroit River but is far more visible to boats than Mamajuda Island. Like Fox Island, Powder House Island is uninhabited, privately owned, and administered by Grosse Ile Township. =Round Island= Round Island () is a 172-acre (70 ha) island off the southern coast of Grosse Ile. It is one of the five islands surrounding the southern coast of Grosse Ile, but it is the only of the five that is uninhabited. Round Island was once connected to Grosse Ile but is now separated by a 50-foot (15 m) channel used primarily for docked boats. =Stony Island= Stony Island Stony Island () is an approximately 100 acre (40 ha) island located about 0.25 mi (0.4 km) east of the center of Grosse Ile. Stony Island's odd shape and stony composition came from the millions of cubic yards of sediment that were dredged out of the middle of the Detroit River to provide a deep shipping lane for large freighters. Stony Island is uninhabited and sparsely vegetated. Because the entire border separating Michigan and Ontario is water, this shipping lane is the narrowest width of water separating the two at any point along the international border. Stony Island is 500 feet (152 m) away from Ontario's Crystal Island. =Sturgeons Bar= Sturgeons Bar () is a very small, uninhabited 9.0 acre (36,400 m¬≤) bar located about 300 feet (91.4 m) off the west coast of Rockwood at the southern end of the Detroit River on Lake Erie. Sturgeons Bar is off the coast of the Lake Erie Metropark and is technically the southernmost island in the Detroit River. The island is part of the Detroit River International Wildlife Refuge. =Sugar Island= Sugar Island () is a 30-acre (12 ha) island located about 800 feet (244 m) off the east coast of Meso Island. The island is administered by Grosse Ile Township but is uninhabited. In the early part of the 20th century, Sugar Island housed a resort park and had a ferry service to provide transportation to and from the island‚Äî most notably the ill-fated Tashmoo steamboat. The park was eventually torn down, and the island today is still privately owned but has no structures. =Swan Island= Swan Island () is a 58-acre (23 ha) island located off the southwestern tip of Grosse Ile. It is one of the four inhabited islands off the southern coast of Grosse Ile, and Swan Island is the smallest. Swan Island is separated from Grosse Ile by an artificial 75 foot (22.8 m) canal and is connected by one bridge. =Zug Island= Zug Island () is a 0.93 sq mi (2.4 km¬≤) island located in the city of River Rouge, Michigan at the mouth of the River Rouge leading into the Detroit River. The island was created when the River Rouge was diverted from its natural course to provide a better shipping lane. Zug Island is heavily and densely industrialized, and public access is prohibited for security reasons. Because of its highly pollutant nature, Zug Island has a far-reaching environmental impact on the surrounding area. Zug Island has been chartered as the northernmost possible extension of the Detroit River International Wildlife Refuge, although it is not formally part of the current refuge. Ontario =Bois Blanc Island= Bois Blanc Island (), popularly known as Boblo Island, is a 272-acre (110 ha) island and is the southernmost Canadian island in the Detroit River ‚Äî directly across the river from the southern end of Grosse Ile. The island is administered by Amherstburg, Ontario. Bois Blanc Island was home to the Boblo Island Amusement Park from 1898 to 1993, and, today, the island is home to a small community. There are no bridges to the mainland, and transportation to and from the island is provided by private ferry. =Crystal Island= Crystal Island () is an uninhabited 92 acre (37 ha) island about 500 feet (152 m) directly across the international boundary from Michigan's Stony Island. Crystal Island is administered by Amherstburg. Like Stony Island, Crystal Island's odd shape came from the millions of cubic yards of sediment that were dredged out of the middle of the Detroit River to provide a deep shipping lane for large freighters. The island's odd shape created a pristine bay (known as Crystal Bay) that is unusually clear ‚Äî hence the island's name ‚Äî compared to the surrounding river waters due to the current keeping out pollution. =Fighting Island= Fighting Island () is the largest Canadian island in the Detroit River at 2.34 sq mi (6.06 km¬≤) and the second largest after Grosse Ile. Administered by La Salle, Ontario, Fighting Island is located off the northeast tip of Grosse Ile on the other side of the international boundary. The island is uninhabited, mostly barren, and is used as a refuge by a number of different species. Fighting Island was once used as an industrial dumping ground but since been cleaned up. Fighting Island is a prospective area that may be included into the Detroit River International Wildlife Refuge. =Grass Island= Grass Island () is an extremely elongated and narrow 47 acre (19 ha) island located between Fighting Island and mainland Ontario. It is uninhabited, and despite its name, it is quite wooded. Administered by La Salle, Grass Island is sometimes incorrectly named Grassy Island, which is an American island on the exact opposite side of the river. Grass Island's unusual shape is due to the fact that it is just the northern end of a much larger underwater shoal. =Peche Island= Peche Island () is an 86-acre (35 ha) island and is the easternmost of all islands in the Detroit River. The American owned Belle Isle is the northernmost island with Peche Island being the easternmost due to the river's sudden bend. It is one mile (1.61 km) east of Belle Isle. Peche Island is the first island in the river, as it sits at the beginning of the river on Lake St. Clair. The island is fairly large and uninhabited, but unlike Belle Isle, Peche Island is wooded and unused. The city of Windsor, which had jurisdiction over the island, has continually debated on what to do with the island. =Turkey Island= Turkey Island () is a 39-acre (16 ha) island just off the southeastern tip of Fighting Island and directly across from the northern tip of Grosse Ile. The island is densely wooded and uninhabited. The island is administered by La Salle and is a prospective inclusion in the Detroit River International Wildlife Refuge. Ths island is privately owned with 35 Ac of water rights surrounding it. Trespassing violations have recently been handed out as there is no access or hunting permitted.

The house is listed on the Inner West Council local government heritage list. Description and history Highroyd was built by John Young, a builder who migrated from England in 1855 and worked in the state of Victoria for some time before settling in Sydney in 1866. Young was responsible for building a number of heritage buildings in Sydney, including St Mary's Cathedral and St Francis Xavier's War Memorial Church in .The Heritage of Australia, Macmillan Company, 1981, p.2/48 In 1877 he bought a parcel of land near Rozelle Bay, in the area now known as Annandale. His dream was to create a prestige suburb that would rival other exclusive residential areas in Sydney. The main street in this new area, Johnston Street, was intended to be \\"the finest street in the colony.\\"Sunday Telegraph, 24 May 2009, p.85 On the west side of Johnston Street he built a group of eight large, idiosyncratic houses. At the head of this group was The Abbey, a sandstone Gothic mansion loosely modelled on a Scottish manor. It has been described as being \\"among that special breed of Free Gothic landmark buildings which once seen are not easily forgotten.\\" The Abbey was intended to be a home for Young and his wife, but in fact they never lived there. Their home was a house called Kentville, near Rozelle Bay, which has since been demolished. Next in line after The Abbey was Oybin, then Rozelle, Greba, Hockindon, Highroyd, Kenilworth and lastly Claremont. Highroyd and Hockindon were built for Young's daughters. They are designed in an identical style, the only difference being that Highroyd has a spire and Hockindon does not. Along with Kenilworth, they are popularly known as the \\"witches houses\\" because the spires are thought to resemble witches' hats. Apart from their distinctive design, the houses were also notable for their use of reinforced concrete, which was an innovation at the time.The Heritage of Australia, p.78 With the depression of the 1890s, Annandale was subdivided and its character began to change, putting paid to Young's dream of a prestige suburb. It was the beginning of a long period of decline for Young's distinctive houses. The witches houses were divided into flats; Rozelle and Claremont were demolished and replaced with blocks of home units. Restoration Highroyd was sold in 1988 for $700,000. Architect David Springett began to work for them on the restoration of the house, which involved undoing a great deal of damage and defacement that had accumulated over the years. So-called \\"hippies\\" had painted murals on the walls and covered the cedar staircase with a thick coat of green paint. Scraping the paint off the stairs was in itself a major job which took six months. The wrought iron balconies at the front of the house had been enclosed by previous owners to create more room; wrought iron for their restoration had to be made especially for the purpose. Gargoyles had to be made to decorate the spire; sculptor Hugh Reedman was commissioned for the job and produced four gargoyles that had to be lowered into position by crane.

Volume 2 by Sir John Gardner Wilkinson The walls of Starigrad are 262m above sea level. The approach and gateway into Starigrad was protected by a bastion () and a barbican (). The fortress or Fortica was built during the Croatian‚ÄìOttoman wars as a primary defence against the Ottoman Empire. The precipitous fortification is sited on a ridge above the town Omi≈°. In the event of attack, its purpose was to provide refuge for local people and be a stronghold where they could retreat to and resist the Turks. As the stone fort's defensive strength is derived from the elevation at which it was built, it is a rudimentary defensive structure. A two-storey square tower stands at its highest point, serving as both a lookout post and keep. A simple bastion stands at the opposite end of the fort to cover the approach path and the ridge line. It has an outer barbican to defend the fort's narrow entrance gateway and the gorge below the fort. The walls, which are about thick, are made from locally quarried limestone. They enclose an inner bailey that is separated into two distinct levels by the difference in the site's natural rock height. Access between the levels is via a small stone stairway that was once protected by a stone wall and gateway. In event of attack, the fortification's design permits the defenders to fall back to higher ground as each level falls.

He played as an inside left. Career Capel played football for a works team, Gosling's, in Manchester, and for Droylsden, before joining Manchester City in 1941, He made his competitive debut on 4 January 1947 in a 1‚Äì0 win in the Football League Second Division away at Chesterfield. Bob Brocklebank signed him for Chesterfield in October 1947. He scored on his league debut for the club, finished his first season as the club's leading scorer with 16 despite joining well after the start of the season, and in something under two seasons scored a total of 27 league goals from 62 appearances. In the 1949 close season Brocklebank signed him for a second time, taking him to First Division club Birmingham City for a fee of ¬£10,000. Capel, described as a \\"powerful, bustling player\\", failed to settle at Birmingham, and moved to Nottingham Forest a few months later. He and Wally Ardron formed \\"a lethal striking partnership\\" which contributed to Forest, under the management of Billy Walker, winning the Third Division South title in the 1950‚Äì51 season.

In the 1954 close season, Capel joined Coventry City, for whom he scored 19 goals from 34 league matches in the Third Division South, and finished off his league career with a few months at Third Division North club Halifax Town, thus completing the set of playing in all four divisions of the Football League.

He is an honorary member of the British Society for Immunology.  Public affairs  Lachmann's helped produce the Royal Society's first report on GM crops in 1998. The report, Genetically Modified Plants for Food Use, outlined the benefits of GM plants in agriculture, medicine, food quality and safety, nutrition and health, especially in alleviating food shortage in third-world countries. This caused him to be regarded as a controversial figure by the anti-GM food lobby. In 1999, he tried to persuade the editor of The Lancet not to publish √Årp√°d Pusztai's research on the adverse effects of GM potatoes on rats on the grounds that it was not sound science. The Lancet's editor, Richard Horton, said he received a \\"very aggressive\\" phone call calling him \\"immoral\\" and threatening that if he published the paper it would \\"have implications for his personal position\\" as editor. Lachmann said that he made the call but denied that he threatened Horton and said the call was to \\"discuss his error of judgment\\" in publishing the Pusztai letter and to discuss the \\"moral difficulties about publishing bad science\\".Laurie Flynn and Michael Sean Gillard for The Guardian, 31 October 1999 Pro-GM scientist \\"threatened editor\\" Lachmann's own account of GMOs and the Pusztai affair can be found in Panic Nation (2005). Lachmann remains a proponent of the defence of reason and scepticism in scientific academia also on other topics that extend from vaccine scares to stem cell technology and to alternative medicine. He is also a bee keeper and this interest has led to an interest in the evolution of group behaviour in both bees and humans and the role of religious prescription as the building blocks of cultural evolution.

In the distant past, people traded through the area using the indigenous boat through a near extinct river presently known as Bagi Jora. The traders, called Boitaras, settled in the area. Therefore, this habitation came to be known as Bada Boitara which gradually began to be mispronounced as Badabetara, the present name.

Kitterman was a former United States Navy chief petty officer. He had worked in Iraq since the US invasion in 2003, for Kellogg, Brown and Root and other firms. He was the president of his own construction firm Janus Construction, based in Houston. CNN reported on June 7, 2009 that Kitterman had been bound, blindfolded and gagged, prior to being stabbed. Suspects Five men were arrested on June 5, 2009 at the barracks and office of security firm Corporate Training Unlimited (CTU). One of the arrested men was Donald Feeney Jr., a former Delta Force soldier and the founder of CTU. Also arrested were Donald Feeney III, one of Feeney's sons, two members of CTU, Micah Milligan and Mark Bridges, and an insect exterminator named Jason Jones who was spending the night on his way to Camp Taji. The Washington Post reported that the five suspects were arrested by Iraqi authorities following a tip from the FBI. The Associated Press reported that the five men were arrested during a raid on the Corporate Training Unlimited's offices and barracks because their weapons permits had expired. Iraqi officials suspected that two of the men were involved in the murder. Later, CNN quoted officials at the US Embassy who stated the five men were not suspected of the murder and that all five had alibis. Sarah Smith, a spokesperson with CTU, acknowledged that Feeney and his colleagues knew Kitterman, and respected him: One of the proclamations of America's administrator of Iraq, Paul Bremer, was that American contractors would be immune from prosecution in Iraqi courts. This proclamation remained in effect until the Iraqi legislature countermanded it in 2008. =Release= Three of the contractors were later released on June 11 due to lack of evidence. Milligan and Jones, who were held longer by the FBI, were released in July. Two Iraqis testified in the ICCC (Iraqi Central Criminal Court) said that Kitterman's murder was committed by another American who himself was killed not long afterward. Larry Eugene Young, a CTU employee, was killed by mortar fire in the Green Zone on the same day as Kitterman's murder.Contractor Casualties See also *Kirk von Ackermann *Ryan G.

Development and designations The Waco closed cabin biplanes, initially known as the C (for Cabin) series were all unequal span, staggered single bay biplanes. They were fabric covered, the wings having a wooden structure and the control surfaces and fuselage constructed from metal frames. The wings were braced with outward splayed N form interplane struts plus a strut connecting the centre section rear spar to the bottom of the forward interplane strut, following Waco's standard practice. They had a fixed tailwheel undercarriage, which could be partially or completely faired. There was seating for 4/5 including the pilot. Most were powered by 7 cylinder radial engines of different makes. When Waco released its slightly larger custom cabin series, those original Cabin series aircraft it continued to produce were redesignated as 'Waco Standard Cabin series', with the final designation letter changing from C to C-S to S. For instance in 1935 the YKC became the YKC-S, then the YKS-6 in 1936. All three were indistinguishable from each other.Brandley. 1981http://aerofiles.com/wacodata.html Aerofiles 'That Waco Coding System' Waco used numeric suffixes like -7 to indicate a subvariant introduced in 1937 and so on. The standard cabin can be subdivided again into three groups, early examples having a boat-tail skylight (QDC, OEC & UEC), mid series aircraft with a faired skylight (CJC, UIC, UKC, YKC) or late examples with no skylight (DJC-S, HKS, ZKS, UKC-S UKS-7, VKS-7, YKC-S, YKS-6 & 7, ZKS-6 & 7). All of the types built under the C-S and S designators lacked a skylight though the skylight could be faired over on earlier aircraft. Later types were also slightly longer than earlier models. From about 1937, all S series aircraft had wings lacking leading and trailing edge cutouts. Externally, the S series differed from the Custom or later C series in continuing with early C series features such as ailerons on both wings, linked by a prominent strut, and square edged rear side windows. Like most Waco aircraft, the S series were available with many different engines (identified by the first letter of the type designation). Operational history The S series proved to be popular with both commercial and private pilots and over 50 were still airworthy in 2001, including examples of the CPTP VKS-7F version. During the Second World War several S series aircraft were impressed by the USAAF as the UC-72K or UC-72M and used as Liaison, executive light transport and instrument refresher training aircraft.Simpson, 2001, p. 575 Only a handful remain airworthy in this century.

The American Nuclear Society concluded that average local radiation exposure was equivalent to a chest X-ray, and maximum local exposure equivalent to less than a year's background radiation. The U.S. BEIR report on the Biological Effects of Ionizing Radiation states that \\"[t]he collective dose equivalent resulting from the radioactivity released in the Three Mile Island accident was so low that the estimated number of excess cancer cases to be expected, if any were to occur, would be negligible and undetectable.\\" A variety of epidemiology studies have concluded that the accident has had no observable long term health effects.R. J. Levin (2008), \\"Incidence of thyroid cancer in residents surrounding the three-mile island nuclear facility\\", Laryngoscope 118 (4), pp. 618‚Äì628 \\"These findings, however, do not provide a causal link to the TMI accident.\\" One dissenting study is \\"A reevaluation of cancer incidence near the Three Mile Island nuclear plant\\" by Dr. Steven Wing of the University of North Carolina. In this study, Dr. Wing and his colleagues argue that earlier findings had \\"logical and methodological problems\\" and conclude that \\"cancer incidence, specifically lung cancer and leukemia, increased following the TMI accident in areas estimated to have been in the pathway of radioactive plumes than in other areas.\\" Other dissenting opinions can be found in the Radiation and Public Health Project, whose leader, Joseph Mangano, has questioned the safety of nuclear power since 1985.Mangano, Joseph (2004), \\"Three Mile Island: Health study meltdown\\", Bulletin of the atomic scientists, 60(5), pp.31-35 Initial investigations In the aftermath of the accident, the investigations focused on the amounts of radioactivity released by the accident. According to the American Nuclear Society, using the official radioactivity emission figures, \\"The average radiation dose to people living within ten miles of the plant was eight millirem, and no more than 100 millirem to any single individual. Eight millirem is about equal to a chest X-ray, and 100 millirem is about a third of the average background level of radiation received by US residents in a year.\\". To put this dose into context, while the average background radiation in the US is about 360 millirem per year, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission regulates all workers' of any US nuclear power plant exposure to radiation to a total of 5000 millirem per year. Based on these low emission figures, early scientific publications on the health effects of the fallout estimated one or two additional cancer deaths in the 10-mile area around TMI. =Local resident reports= The official figures are too low to account for the acute health effects reported by some local residents and documented in two books;Katagiri Mitsuru and Aileen M. Smith (1989), Three Mile Island: The People's Testament - based on interviews with 250 residents between 1979 and 1988.Robert Del Tredici (1982) The People of Three Mile Island, Random House, Inc. such health effects require exposure to at least 100,000 millirems (100 rems) to the whole body - 1000 times more than the official estimates.GPU Utilities 91986), \\"Radiation And Health Effects: A Report on the TMI-2 Accident and Related Health Studies\\" The reported health effects are consistent with high doses of radiation, and comparable to the experiences of cancer patients undergoing radio-therapy,.Sue Sturgis (2009) \\"FOOLING WITH DISASTER? Startling revelations about Three Mile Island disaster raise doubts over nuclear plant safety\\" , Facing South: Online Magazine of the Institute for Southern Studies, April 2009 but have many other potential causes. The effects included \\"metallic taste, erythema, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, hair loss, deaths of pets and farm and wild animals, and damage to plants.\\"Wing, Steven (2003) \\"Objectivity and Ethics in Environmental Health Science\\", Environmental Health Perspectives Volume 111, Number 14, November 2003 Some local statistics showed dramatic one-year changes among the most vulnerable: \\"In Dauphin County, where the Three Mile Island plant is located, the 1979 death rate among infants under one year represented a 28 percent increase over that of 1978, and among infants under one month, the death rate increased by 54 percent.\\" Physicist Ernest Sternglass, a specialist in low-level radiation, noted these statistics in the 1981 edition of his book Secret Fallout: low-level radiation from Hiroshima to Three-Mile Island. In their final 1981 report, however, the Pennsylvania Department of Health, examining death rates within the 10-mile area around TMI for the 6 months after the accident, said that the TMI-2 accident did not cause local deaths of infants or fetuses.Walker, p234 Scientific work continued in the 1980s, but focused heavily on the mental health effects due to stress, as the Kemeny Commission had concluded that this was the sole public health effect. A 1984 survey by a local psychologist of 450 local residents, documenting acute radiation health effects (as well as 19 cancers 1980-84 amongst the residents against an expected 2.6), ultimately led the TMI Public Health Fund reviewing the dataMoholdt B. Summary of acute symptoms by TMI area residents during accident. In:Proceedings of the workshop on Three Mile Island dosimetry. Philadelphia:Academy of Natural Sciences, 1985. and supporting a comprehensive epidemiological study by a team at Columbia University. Columbia epidemiological study In 1990-1 a Columbia University team, led by Maureen Hatch, carried out the first epidemiological study on local death rates before and after the accident, for the period 1975-1985, for the 10-mile area around TMI. Assigning fallout impact based on winds on the morning of March 28, 1979, the study found no link between fallout and cancer risk. The study found that cancer rates near the Three Mile Island plant peaked in 1982-3, but their mathematical model did not account for the observed increase in cancer rates, since they argued that latency periods for cancer are much longer than three years. From 1975 to 1979 there were 1,722 reported cases of cancer, and between 1981 and 1985 there were 2,831, signifying a 64 percent increase after the meltdown. The study concludes that stress may have been a factor (though no specific biological mechanism was identified), and speculated that changes in cancer screening were more important. =Wing review= Subsequently, lawyers for 2000 residents asked epidemiologist Stephen Wing of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, a specialist in nuclear radiation exposure, to re- examine the Columbia study. Wing was reluctant to get involved, later writing that \\"allegations of high radiation doses at TMI were considered by mainstream radiation scientists to be a product of radiation phobia or efforts to extort money from a blameless industry.\\" Wing later noted that in order to obtain the relevant data, the Columbia study had to submit to what Wing called \\"a manipulation of research\\" in the form of a court order which prohibited \\"upper limit or worst case estimates of releases of radioactivity or population doses... [unless] such estimates would lead to a mathematical projection of less than 0.01 health effects.\\" Wing found cancer rates raised within a 10-mile radius two years after the accident by 0.034% +/- 0.013%, 0.103% +/- 0.035%, and 0.139% +/- 0.073% for all cancer, lung cancer, and leukemia, respectively. An exchange of published responses between Wing and the Columbia team followed. Wing later noted a range of studies showing latency periods for cancer from radiation exposure between 1 and 5 years due to immune system suppression. Latencies between 1 and 9 years have been studied in a variety of contexts ranging from the Hiroshima survivors and the fallout from Chernobyl to therapeutic radiation; a 5-10 year latency is most common.Mangano, Joseph (2006), \\"A short latency between radiation exposure from nuclear plants and cancer in young children\\", International journal of health services, vol:36 iss:1 pg:113-135 Further studies On the recommendation of the Columbia team, the TMI Public Health Fund followed up its work with a longitudinal study. The 2000-3 University of Pittsburgh study; compared post-TMI death rates in different parts of the local area, again using the wind direction on the morning of 28 March to assign fallout impact, even though, according to Joseph Mangano in the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, the areas of lowest fallout by this criterion had the highest mortality rates. In contrast to the Columbia study, which estimated exposure in 69 areas, the Pittsburgh study drew on the TMI Population Registry, compiled by the Pennsylvania Department of Health. This was based on radiation exposure information on 93% of the population living within five miles of the nuclear plant - nearly 36,000 people, gathered in door-to-door surveys shortly after the accident.Holzman (2003), \\"Cancer and three mile island\\", Environmental health perspectives, vol:111 iss:3 pg:A166 -A167 The study found slight increases in cancer and mortality rates but \\"no consistent evidence\\" of causation by TMI. Wing et al. criticized the Pittsburgh study for making the same assumption as Columbia: that the official statistics on low doses of radiation were correct - leading to a study \\"in which the null hypothesis cannot be rejected due to a priori assumptions.\\"Wing, S. and Richardson, D. (2000), \\"Collision of Evidence and Assumptions: TMI D√©j√† View\\", Environmental Health Perspectives, 108(12), December 2000 Hatch et al. noted that their assumption had been backed up by dosimeter data, though Wing et al. noted the incompleteness of this data, particularly for releases early on. In 2005 R. William Field, an epidemiologist at the University of Iowa, who first described radioactive contamination of the wild food chain from the accident suggested that some of the increased cancer rates noted around TMI were related to the area's very high levels of natural radon, noting that according to a 1994 EPA study, the Pennsylvania counties around TMI have the highest regional screening radon concentrations in the 38 states surveyed.R. W. Field (2005), \\"Three Mile Island epidemiologic radiation dose assessment revisited: 25 years after the accident\\", Radiation Protection Dosimetry 113 (2), pp. 214-217 The factor had also been considered by the Pittsburgh study and by the Columbia team, which had noted that \\"rates of childhood leukemia in the Three Mile Island area are low compared with national and regional rates.\\" A 2006 study on the standard mortality rate in children in 34 counties downwind of TMI found an increase in the rate (for cancers other than leukemia) from 0.83 (1979‚Äì83) to 1.17 (1984‚Äì88), meaning a rise from below the national average to above it. A paper in 2008 studying thyroid cancer in the region found rates as expected in the county in which the reactor is located, and significantly higher than expected rates in two neighboring counties beginning in 1990 and 1995 respectively. The research notes that \\"These findings, however, do not provide a causal link to the TMI accident.\\"RJ Levin (2008), \\"Incidence of thyroid cancer in residents surrounding the three mile island nuclear facility\\", Laryngoscope 118 (4), pp. 618-628 According to Joseph Mangano (who is a member of The Radiation and Public Health Project, an organization with little credibility amongst epidemiologists,) three large gaps in the literature include: no study has focused on infant mortality data, or on data from outside the 10-mile zone, or on radioisotopes other than iodine, krypton, and xenon.

Acting as an underground barrier impermeable to water, it controls the groundwater flow in an aquifer and raises the water table. Introduction Although the total amount of water on Earth is generally assumed to have remained virtually constant, the rapid growth in population, together with the extension of irrigated agriculture and industrial development, are putting stress on the quality and quantity aspects of natural system. Several institutions have experimented with the use of subsurface dykes to conserve water in water- scarce areas. The ideal location for a dyke is a well defined, wide, greatly sloping valley with a narrow outlet having limited thickness of loose soil or porous rock on the top with massive or impervious rock below. A subsurface dyke has many advantages. It does not require additional surface reservoir, there is no loss of agricultural land, there is minimum evaporation loss since the storage is subsurface, there is no siltation and loss of reservoir capacity, the cost of maintenance is negligible, and it is relatively environment-friendly. One such example was a recent sub-surface dyke constructed in India. For more information about this project, see Krishi Vigyan Kendra Kannur.

Background Stafford was the son of George Stafford- Jerningham, 8th Baron Stafford, and Frances Henrietta Sulyarde, daughter of Edward Sulyarde of Haughley Park. His father had succeeded as seventh Baronet of Costessey in 1809. After his mother's death in 1832, his father married Elizabeth Caton, second daughter Richard Caton and Mary Carroll Caton (a daughter of Charles Carroll of Carrollton). In 1821, Henry was admitted to Magdalene College, Cambridge. In 1824, his father managed to obtain a reversal of the attainder of the barony of Stafford (the attainder had been imposed on his ancestor William Howard, 1st Viscount Stafford and 1st Baron Stafford in 1680).

The event sparked outrage from North Carolina Governor Zebulon B. Vance and Solicitor Augustus Merrimon (the latter of whom investigated the event), and was published in numerous newspapers in northern states and as far away as Europe. While the massacre destroyed the military career and reputation of Lieutenant-Colonel James A. Keith, the adjunct commander who ordered the executions, he was never brought to justice for the incident.Manly Wellman, The Kingdom of Madison (Chapel Hill, N.C.: University of North Carolina Press, 1973), pp. 83-84. Background The events leading up to the massacre began in January 1863 when an armed band of Madison County Unionists ransacked salt stores in Marshall and looted the home of Confederate Colonel Lawrence Allen, commander of the 64th North Carolina Regiment who was away from home, guarding stockpiles of salt elsewhere. During the war salt was a precious resource. Brigadier General W.G.M. Davis reported on February 2, \\"I think the attack on Marshall was gotten up to obtain salt, for want of which there is great suffering in the mountains. Plunder of other property followed as a matter of course.\\" This elicited a response from General William Davis, stationed at nearby Warm Springs (now Hot Springs), who dispatched the 64th under Lieutenant-Colonel Keith (Allen was ill at the time) to the Shelton Laurel Valley to pursue the looters (Keith, like much of the 64th, was a native of Madison County). By this point in the war the 64th North Carolina Regiment had lost nearly two thirds of their original force from combat and desertion. In the skirmish that followed, 12 of the looters were killed and several were captured. Upon hearing of the events, Governor Vance (who grew up in nearby Weaverville) sent orders not to harm the captured Unionists and dispatched Solicitor Merrimon to monitor the situation. Massacre In spite of the governor's orders, Keith, believing a rumor that the Unionist force was much larger than in reality, began frantically combing the valley for Union supporters. For Keith, being a native of Marshall made this issue personal. Keith's troops moved on Shelton Laurel from two directions. While Keith led his column down from the high crest at the top of the valley, Colonel Allen brought his men up the opposite end of the valley. Hidden locals fired on Allen's men with occasional gunfire. In the returning fire Allen's soldiers killed 8 men. Once the soldiers reached the home of Bill Shelton they encountered over 50 riflemen. The ensuing combat left six of the defenders dead. While Allen and his troops awaited Colonel Keith's column, news was received that Allen's 6-year-old son Romulus had died of scarlet fever. Upon his return to Marshall, Allen discovered that his 4-year-old daughter Margaret was dying. Allen was quick to blame the looters who had ransacked his house previously. The next day he buried his children and returned immediately to Shelton Laurel. With Allen, fueled by grief and the desire for vengeance, reunited with Keith, the two realized that the locals were unlikely to volunteer information. Keith rounded up several Shelton Laurel women and began torturing them in hopes of forcing them to give up their sons' and husbands' whereabouts. They hanged and whipped Mrs. Unus Riddle, a woman of 85. They hanged Mary and Sarah Shelton by their necks until they were nearly dead. The Memphis Bulletin reports: \\"Old Mrs. Sallie Moore, seventy years of age, was whipped with hickory rods till the blood ran in streams down her back to the ground. ‚Ä¶ Martha White, an idiotic girl, was beaten and tied by the neck all day to a tree.\\" The soldiers burnt homes and slaughtered livestock. After several days of rounding up alleged supporters, Keith began marching the captives toward East Tennessee, which at the time was occupied by a substantial Confederate army. However, after two of the captives escaped, Keith ordered the remaining 13 captives into the woods, and had 5 of them shot execution style.William Trotter, Bushwhackers! The Mountains (John F. Blair Publishers, 1991), pp. 224-232. Their bodies were dumped into a nearby trench. Among the executed were three boys, ages 13, 14, and 17. Joe Woods, an elderly man of 60, said \\"\\"For God's sake, men, you are not going to shoot us? If you are going to murder us, give us at least time to pray.\\" Keith responded, \\"There's no time for praying.\\" The soldier hesitated before shooting the horrified captives, prompting Keith to bellow, \\"Fire or you will take their place!\\" The soldiers fired and 4 men were killed instantly, one required a second shot. The next 5 men were made to kneel and after the shots were fired again one man remained still alive. It was 13-year-old David Shelton who clutched the legs of an officer and begged \\"You have killed my old father and three brothers, you have shot me in both arms. ‚Ä¶ I forgive you all this ‚Äî I can get well. ‚Ä¶ Let me go home to my mother and sisters.\\" David Shelton was shot 8 more times. Attorney General Augustus S. Merrimon, stunned by the incident, reported it to Governor Vance shortly thereafter. He wrote \\"I learned that all this was done by order of Lieut. Col. James A. Keith. I know not what you intend doing with the guilty parties, but I suggest they are all guilty of murder. ‚Ä¶ Such savage and barbarous cruelty is without parallel in the State, and I hope in every other.\\" The governor wrote that the affair was \\"shocking and outrageous in the extreme,\\" and ordered a full investigation. Family members of the slain (mostly Sheltons) discovered that the bodies were being eaten by wilds pigs and moved the bodies to a new cemetery east of the massacre site. They swore revenge against the perpetrators. Keith was ultimately tried for the massacre in civilian court after the war. After spending 2 years in jail awaiting trial, he escaped just days before a state supreme court decision would have provided him with vindication. He was never apprehended, and after two years the state dropped its prosecution.Paludan, Philip S. 1981. Victims: A True Story of the Civil War. Knoxville, TN: The University of Tennessee Press. p. 144. Colonel Allen, who was not officially in command, but heavily involved in the tragedy was given 6 months suspension by the Army. Five widows of murdered men from Shelton Laurel petitioned congress for pensions. Their petition died in committee. A North Carolina Highway Historical marker recalling the massacre stands in the vicinity of the massacre site at the modern intersection of state highways 208 and 212. The graves of the slain are in a cemetery just off Highway 212, further up the valley.North Carolina Highway History Marker Program: Madison County, Marker P-71 Popular culture Massacre at Shelton Laurel, a short film written and directed by Jay Stone, was shot in the fall of 2001 in Rutherfordton, North Carolina.

North Carolina Visions: Season 12 Featured Films. Events of the Shelton Laurel massacre are described in The World Made Straight, by Ron Rash, a fiction book about western North Carolina during the 1970s.Southern Writers: The World Made Straight. The novel was developed into a film by the same title, released in 2015. Charles Frazier, the author of Cold Mountain, studied the Shelton Laurel massacre in depth during research for the book and paralleled many of the events therein. During the massacre one soldiers tied a woman to a tree while her baby was disrobed and left exposed to the snow unless she gave up information. Frazier recreates this scene in Cold Mountain when Sara encounters Federal soldiers. When the Confederates initially raided the Laurel Valley they arrested fifteen men, two escaped, and thirteen were executed in the woods. Of the executed, the youngest was 13 and the oldest was sixty-six. In Cold Mountain, Frazier recreates the horror, \\"\\"A captive boy, not much older than twelve, fell to his knees and commenced crying. An old man, grey headed, said, \\"You can't mean to kill us\\". When the soldiers were forced to execute the elderly and children at Shelton Laurel many of them initially refused and were threatened with death by their superiors. Frazier's Cold Mountain details one soldier's opinion on the matter, \\"I didn't sign on to kill grandpaws and little boys.\\" After the horrific events at Shelton Laurel family members discovered the shallow grave of their relatives was being exhumed and eaten by wild hogs. When Inman awakens in the novel he discovers \\"feral hogs descended from the woods, drawn by the tang of the air. They plowed at the ground with their snouts and dug out arms and feet\\". When the captors at Shelton Laurel captured Henry and George Grooms they asked Henry to play a tune on his fiddle before his execution. He played \\"Bonaparte's Retreat\\". Before Stobrod is executed in Cold Mountain, Teague asks him to play a song. Strobrod plays \\"a piece slightly reminiscent of Bonaparte's Retreat\\". Many of the guards had a difficult time executing Mitchell Caldwell because he was mentally handicapped and would not stop smiling. The soldiers forced Mitchell to cover his face with his hat because they could not shoot anyone with a grin on their face. When the soldiers execute the simpleton Pangle, in Cold Mountain, one soldier says \\"I can't shoot a man grinning at me‚Ä¶ Take your hat off\\" and \\"Hold it over your face\\".

His family later moved to Galway where he attended Col√°iste Iogn√°id (Ignatius College). Upon completing school, he moved to Germany where he worked in a factory, earning enough money to support his further travels. He cycled south through Europe and the Balkans, and later spent time in Athens, Greece There, he attended the British School at Athens. He returned to Ireland the following year. He enrolled at University College Dublin, where he studied Archaeology and Classical Civilization, graduating with a BA degree with honours in 1981. Casey also pursued his new interest in flying. Career After graduation, Casey was employed for a year at the Museum of London, where he worked on a television documentary about Inishark, a small island near the coast of Galway. During this period, he participated in archaeological excavations in Galway. Later, he worked on his Master's degree, combining his background in archaeology with his interest in flying and aerial photography. His research, using aerial archeology, revealed that many Irish coastal ring forts and other archeological sites in the counties of Clare, Galway, Mayo and Sligo, previously unknown, were not included on the Ordnance Survey Maps of Ireland. Casey had a commercial pilot's license and managed a light aircraft maintenance company, Shoreline Aviation in Knock, Ireland. He also worked as a consulting archaeologist, conducting aerial and terrestrial archeological surveys for infrastructure projects. Personal life Casey was an avid pilot. He lived in Salthill, Galway with his family. In 2008, Casey died from injuries sustained from a plane crash in Kilmovee, County Mayo. He is survived by his son, Tim, and his extended family.

She first studied pathogens afflicting peanuts and later the fungus Phialophora.  Biography  Marie Beatrice Schwarz was born on 12 July 1898 in Batavia in the Dutch East Indies (present-day Jakarta, Indonesia). She studied at the Utrecht University in the Netherlands, where she was Johanna Westerdijk's first PhD student. During her studies in 1922, she discovered the causal fungus of Dutch elm disease.Promotion data at the University of Utrecht (Dutch) Schwarz spent most of her early professional life studying pathogens afflicting the groundnut Arachis hypogaea at the agricultural research station in Bogor.

When the East Indies were invaded by the Japanese army in 1942, Schwarz and her husband were interned in separate camps, her husband dying soon afterwards. After liberation, Schwarz and her two sons returned to the Netherlands, where she joined the Centraal Bureau voor Schimmelcultures (Central Bureau for Fungus Cultures) in Baarn, studying various fungi and writing a monograph on the genus Epicoccum. After her second retirement, she continued to study the genus Phialophora despite her rapidly failing health.

Historic photos of life aboard the Booya . Retrieved on 9 June 2009. As operations against the enemy began in the island and ocean areas northward from Australia in 1942, amphibious communications became necessary, the SWPA chief signal officer, General Spencer B. Akin, created a small fleet that served as relay ships from forward areas to headquarters, however their function and number soon expanded, when they took aboard the forward command post communications facilities as the Army's CP fleet. The small communications ships, part of the U.S. Army's Small Ships Section of Australian acquired vessels known officially as the \\"catboat flotilla,\\" proved so useful in amphibious actions that Army elements in SWPA operations continually competed to obtain their services. The first Australian vessels acquired by General Akin to be converted during the first half of 1943 by Australian firms into communications ships were the Harold (S-58, CS-3), an auxiliary ketch, and the Argosy Lemal (S-6), an auxiliary schooner.These initial ships would be joined by the U.S. sailing ships Volador and Geoanna. From Milne Bay, the vessels then, served at Port Moresby, at Woodlark, and in the Lae-Salamaua area through mid-1943. A graphic account of some of the vicissitudes of the Argosy Lemal and its mixed crew came from S/Sgt. Arthur B. Dunning, Headquarters Company, 60th Signal Battalion. He and six other enlisted men of that unit were ordered aboard her on 9 September 1943, at Oro Bay, New Guinea, to handle Army radio traffic. The commander of the ship reported to naval authorities, not to General Akin. After six months' service along the New Guinea coast, the skipper was removed for incompetence. His replacement was no better. Among other things, he obeyed to the letter Navy's order forbidding the use of unshielded radio receivers at sea. Since the Signal Corps receivers aboard the ship were unshielded and thus liable to radiate sufficiently to alert nearby enemy listeners, the men were forbidden to switch them on in order to hear orders from Army headquarters ashore. As a consequence, during a trip in the spring of 1944 from Milne Bay to Cairns, Australia (on naval orders), the crew failed to hear frantic Signal Corps radio messages to the Argosy Lemal ordering her to return at once to Milne Bay to make ready for a forthcoming Army operation. On the way to Australia the skipper, after a series of mishaps attributable to bad navigation, grounded the Argosy hard on a reef. Most of the crew already desperately ill of tropical diseases, now had additional worries. The radio antennas were swept away along with the ship's rigging, and help could not be requested until the Signal Corps men strung up a makeshift antenna. Weak with fevers and in a ship on the verge of foundering, they pumped away at the water rising in the hold and wondered why rescue was delayed till they learned that the position of the ship that the skipper had given them to broadcast was ninety miles off their true position. As they threw excess cargo overboard, \\"some of the guys,\\" recorded Dunning, \\"were all for jettisoning our skipper for getting us into all of this mess.\\" Much later, too late for the need the Signal Corps had for the ship, the Argosy Lemal was rescued and towed to Port Moresby for repairs to the vessel and medical attention to the crew, many of whom were by then, according to Dunning, \\"psycho-neurotic.\\" Besides Dunning, a radio operator, there were T/4 Jack Stanton, also a radio operator; T/Sgt. Harold Wooten, the senior non- commissioned officer; T/4 Finch and T/5 Burtness, maintenance men; and T/5 Ingram and Pfc. Devlin, code and message center clerks. Dunning described the Argosy as a 3-mast sailing vessel with a 110-horsepower auxiliary diesel engine. \\"She was the sixth vessel,\\" he wrote, \\"to be taken over by the Small Ships Section of the U.S. Army, her primary purpose was handling [radio] traffic between forward areas and the main USASOS headquarters.\\" History 1949-1974 After the war, she was purchased by the Middle East Trading Company in 1949 and renamed Ametco (acronym for Australian Middle East Trading Co). The Ametco sank at Low Wooded Island off the Queensland coast, but was salvaged in poor condition, and taken to Melbourne for repairs. She was purchased in 1952 by shipping company MB Crouch & Co Limited, who renamed her Clair Crouch, after the owner's daughter. The Clair Crouch traded around the Australian coast until 1958 when she was converted to carry sulphuric acid between Port Pirie and Port Lincoln in South Australia. In 1964, she was sold to the Mornington Island Fishing Company and renamed Booya. She was used as a mother ship and fuel supply vessel for the Northern prawn fleets, but became laid up in 1965/66 until she was sold again in 1968 (some sources say 1971) to the Denham Island Transport Company, trading cargo mainly between Dili and Darwin. On the evening of 24 December 1974, Booya was moored near Fort Hill wharf with four crew and one guest on board. As Cyclone Tracy approached Darwin, she ‚Äì and all other vessels ‚Äì were ordered off the wharves and instructed to find safe anchorage.Cyclone Tracy and the Schooner Booya (2006).

Characters have attributes (such as wisdom, strength and constitution), skills (such as pick-pocketing and various languages) and hit points. The game is viewed from first-person perspective. The game world includes an overworld split by a mountain range, and eight dungeons. It also offered the player the opportunity to continue their characters from previous games such as Phantasie I, Phantasie III, The Bard's Tale and The Bard's Tale II: The Destiny Knight, although Faerghail does not take place in the same fictional world as these games. Reception Peter Olafson of Computer Gaming World in 1991 described the game as \\"a Bard's Tale cousin with a horde of bells and whistles\\". The magazine praised the Amiga version's graphics and audio, but criticized the lengthy load times, poor play balance when starting with new characters, and errors in the translation. The magazine's Scorpia was much more negative, describing the game as a \\"German import that should never have crossed the Atlantic\\". She criticized the IBM PC version's graphics, documentation, and combat as \\"poor\\" and \\"absurd\\", and \\"a mediocre effort at best\\".

While hiking in the woods the children find many strange runes along the trails. They bump into a Goblin puppet show and startle the children. Here they meet Mitch the Goblin who was once friends with their parents when they were their parents' age. Mitch takes them to the outskirts of the Goblin City but before they're inside there is an air raid attack by Fairie forces. The Fairies are not acting of their free will. There is a battle and the Goblin forces manage to hold off the attack. Down in the city Mitch introduces the children to his parents who tell him the truth about their parents' nemesis Galomar and the books of magic that he wants to control. Mitch's father tells them that inside Galomar's castle they can find maps that give the location of the remaining books of magic. The castle is guarded by two Jiangshi brothers or Chinese vampires. The children navigate underground to break into the castle through sewers and tunnels. Here they encounter monsters who are guards, the Kappa and the Red Cherufe. Mitch explains to the children that many monsters thrive on rule sets. The key to beating the Kappa is to bow a deep bow of respect that he must return and then spill the water in his head. With the Red Cherufe, they must play soothing music on the violin to put him to sleep as they pass. Inside the castle the children find the maps of magic as well as magical rings. They also find a slug named Neal who is an old friend of Mitch the Goblin. Inside the castle the Chinese vampires are awakened and they chase the children who narrowly escape. With the maps in hand the children set out on a Goblin Zeppelin to beat Galomar to the books and to finish their parents' work.

Relief above a window at Ferdinand Bolstraat 49 depicting Ferdinand Bol, after whom the street is named original Heineken brewery at the northern end of the street The Ferdinand Bolstraat is a street in Amsterdam, named after the artist Ferdinand Bol in 1872.  Description  The Ferdinand Bolstraat has traditionally been, and continues to be, primarily a shopping street. It is a major artery of the neighbourhood De Pijp. The street is an extension of the Vijzelstraat which runs south from Muntplein square in the centre of Amsterdam. The street runs more or less north‚Äìsouth from the park and traffic circle Weteringplantsoen to the Amstelkanaal canal and Churchilllaan boulevard. From there, the street continues southward as the Scheldestraat towards Europaplein square, where the RAI convention centre is located. The Ferdinand Bolstraat intersects with Albert Cuypstraat, where the popular daily street market Albert Cuyp Market is located. It also intersects the Ceintuurbaan, a traffic artery running roughly west‚Äìeast from Boerenwetering canal to the Amstel river. Well-known buildings include the original Heineken brewery (now home to the Heineken Experience) at the northern end of the street and the five-star, 23-floor Okura Hotel, a 78 metres tall building which, when completed in 1971, was the second-tallest in the city of Amsterdam. De Pijp metro station, a station of the North/South Line of the Amsterdam Metro, has an entrance on Ferdinand Bolstraat. Because the street is quite narrow, the station's platforms were not built adjacent to one another but one below the other. Tram line 24 runs through the Ferdinand Bolstraat.  History  In 1875, a bridge replaced the ferry over the Singelgracht canal, connecting the Ferdinand Bolstraat to the city centre. After part of the municipality of Nieuwer-Amstel was annexed by Amsterdam in 1896, the street was gradually extended further south, towards the Amstelkanaal canal. In the 1960s, the city government planned to demolish the street and replace it with a broad boulevard. However, these plans were abandoned after protests from local activists, such as the politician Jan Schaefer. After the RAI convention centre moved from its original location on Ferdinand Bolstraat to the current complex on Europaplein in the 1960s, and the RAI building was demolished in 1976, there were plans to replace it with an opera house, as Berlage had intended. However, these plans were also abandoned after protests from local residents, and the Stopera (a combined opera house and city hall) was built instead at a different location in Amsterdam. In 2008 the council of the borough of Oud-Zuid decided that the southern section of Ferdinand Bolstraat, between Albert Cuypstraat and Ceintuurbaan, will remain a car-free pedestrian area even after completion of the metro station (expected in 2017). No decision has been made yet on the northern section of the street. In 2017 a 140-metre section of the tramline which serves the street, between Saenredamstraat and Quellijnstraat, was made single-track.  Trivia  FEBO, a well-known chain of fast-food restaurants in the Netherlands, was named after the Ferdinand Bolstraat. The chain started in 1941 as a bakery called Maison FEBO. However, this bakery was not actually located on Ferdinand Bolstraat, although it was originally intended to be located there.

Among the finest example of La Tene Celtic stone art in Europe, the stone was set on Turoe hill (Cnoc Temhro).

His work has received local and national interest - especially since the construction of the M6 motorway (Ireland) through many of the sites - yet received little endorsement from professional historians and archaeologists.

Life He was son of Baldwin Collins, fellow and vice-provost of Eton College. He was born at Eton on 5 August 1576, and studied for nine years in Eton School. In 1591 he was elected to a scholarship at King's College, Cambridge, where he graduated B.A. 1595-6, M.A. 1599, B.D. 1606. He became chaplain to Archbishop Richard Bancroft and to his successor, Archbishop George Abbot. Collins obtained the rectory of Fen Ditton in Cambridgeshire, and held also the sinecure rectory of Milton in the same county. He was created D.D. at the Cambridge commencement, 3 March 1613, when he was selected by John Richardson (translator), the Regius Professor of Divinity, to answer upon three questions in a divinity act held in St. Mary's Church before Charles, Prince of Wales, and Frederick V, Elector Palatine. On the death of William Smith he was elected Provost of King's College in April 1615, and about the same time he was appointed one of the king's chaplains. On 22 October 1617 he was elected Regius Professor of Divinity, at Cambridge. To this chair James I annexed, as endowment, the rectory of Somersham in Huntingdonshire Collins is said to have lectured for 34 years, twice a week, constantly covering fresh material. He maintained a constant correspondence with Sir Henry Wotton during his embassy at Venice, and Wotton presented to King's College a portrait of Paolo Sarpi. In 1628 the fellows of King's, in a petition to John Williams, the Bishop of Lincoln, charged the provost with bribery, simony, and other matters; but Williams found the charges groundless, and attributed the dissatisfaction to Collins's biting wit. Commemorative plaque to Samuel Collins in King's College Chapel. At the time of the First English Civil War he was royalist, and in 1643 Edward Montagu, 2nd Earl of Manchester and other commissioners ejected him from the rectory of Fen Ditton. On 9 January 1645 he was deprived of the provostship of King's College by order of parliament, in a visitation of the university by the Earl of Manchester. It appears that he was allowed to retain the sinecure rectory of Milton, and his Regius chair, but the living of Somersham was taken from it. Benjamin Whichcote who succeeded him as Provost found him a stipend. In 1646, on the death of Thomas Howell, Bishop of Bristol, the see was offered to Collins, but he declined it. He lived a retired life in a house in St. Radegund's Lane, opposite Jesus College, Cambridge. There he died on 16 September 1651, at the age of seventy-five. He was buried in the same grave with Robert Hacumblen, in King's College Chapel. A mural monument with a Latin inscription was erected there. He left several sons including John who was a scholar and MP. Works His works are: *A Sermon [on 1 Tim. vi. 3-5] preached at Paules Crosse 1 Nov. 1607, London, 1607, 1608; dedicated to Archbishop Bancroft. *Increpatio Andreae Eudaemono-Johannis Jesuitae, de infami Parallelo, et renovata assertio Torturae Torti [Cardinal Bellarmin], pro clarissimo domino atque antistito Eliensi [Lancelot Andrewes], auctore S.

It is in reply to the treatise of Thomas Fitzherbert, published in 1603 under the initials F.T., and entitled a Confutation of certain Absurdities in Lancelot Andrews's Answer to Bellarmine's Apology.

It is based on the 1911 novel of the same title by Hugh Walpole. Walpole based the novel on his experiences as a teacher at Epsom College, but shifted the school's setting to the Cornish coast. Plot The comfortable but lonely world of a middle-aged schoolmaster, \\"Pompo\\" Perrin, is upset when a new colleague arrives and proves popular with the boys, if impatient with petty school norms. The school, part of an isolated cliffside community in Cornwall, is a minor private one run by a headmaster who is somewhat sadistic and threatening towards his staff. Perrin's frustration deepens as Traill, the younger man, who has seen action in the war and is more worldly and confident, begins a relationship with an attractive school nurse, with whom Perrin has for some time been enamoured. Perrin feels himself increasingly undermined and humiliated at work, and losing his connection to his pupils. He slides into resentment and depression. He develops fantasies of violence against his perceived enemy, leading to a tragic conclusion.BFI.org Cast * Marius Goring as Vincent Perrin * David Farrar as David Traill * Greta Gynt as Isobel Lester * Raymond Huntley as Moy- Thompson * Edward Chapman as Birkland * Mary Jerrold as Mrs. Perrin * Ralph Truman as Comber * Finlay Currie as Sir Joshua Varley * Maurice Jones as Clinton * Lloyd Pearson as Dormer * May MacDonald as Mrs. Dormer * Viola Lyel as Mrs. Comber * Pat Nye as Matron References External links Category:1948 films Category:1948 drama films Category:British films Category:British black-and-white films Category:British drama films Category:English-language films Category:Films about educators Category:Films based on British novels Category:Films directed by Lawrence Huntington Category:Films set in Cornwall Category:Two Cities Films films ","title":"Mr. Perrin and Mr. Traill"},{"id":"23168074","text":"Ambalam is a small village in Nanguneri taluk, Tirunelveli District, Tamil Nadu, India.

Plot There was no way for Avedon Hammond (Yancy Butler) to foresee the impending crisis. As command pilot of the I/P/T transport ship Armstrong, a space-weary NASA discard now used routinely in sub-orbital transport runs, the attractive, highly proficient pilot has her hands full. Upon entering the ship to prepare for liftoff, she's chagrined to find that her flight has been reassigned to another command pilot, Cooper Wayne (Bruce Payne), a daredevil she knows all too well‚Äîas an ex-lover from whom she just had to walk away. Avedon is further annoyed to find that the flight is another \\"mystery run,\\" no paperwork, no flight plan, and a handful of passengers on what should be a cargo carrier. The eclectic riffraff of passengers includes Lazarus (Salvator Xuereb), a two-bit hustler; Dr. Shephard (Robin Sachs), a skilled former micro-surgeon now addicted to his own self-prescribed medications; Cade (David Stratton), an edgy young man obsessed with finding the wife who deserted him; and Sarra (Juliet Landau), a flawlessly beautiful young woman with a mysterious past. About the only \\"stand-up guy\\" aboard is chief engineer Mick 'Clean' McClean (Stanley Kamel), a technical genius who's called upon regularly to repair just about every system on board the tired ship. After takeoff, two booster rockets become obstructed and the Avedon is forced to crash land in a desolate, uncharted region of the South Asian desert wracked by seismic tremors. While trying to recover tridymite to fabricate new flight data circuit boards, the crew stumbles upon an underground military depository for advanced biological weapons. One of the passengers gets infected by the weapons and turns into a zombie with murderous proclivities. Avedon and Cooper attempt to protect the other passengers and get the plane repaired and to safety as soon as is possible.http://www.100percentent.com/ravager.htm Cast *Bruce Payne as Cooper Wayne *Yancy Butler as Avedon Hammond *Juliet Landau as Sarra *Stanley Kamel as Clean *Robin Sachs as Dr. Shepard *Salvator Xuereb as Lazarus *Stuart Cornfeld as Doctor *Momo Yashima as Nurse *Diane Pershing as Des (voice) Reception The film has a score of 5.6 out of 10 on IMDb.https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0119984/ The Radio Times described the film as 'Outbreak meets Alien and stated that it was 'a competently made and acted science-fiction thriller'.http://www.radiotimes.com/servlet_film/com.icl.beeb.rtfilms.client.simpleSearchServlet?frn=13518&searchTypeSelect;=5 John Stanley stated that the interactions between Butler's character and Payne's and Landau's characters \\"provide more substance than usual\\".

He attained the rank of major general and served as Adjutant General of the United States Army from 1933 to 1935.  Early life  James Fuller McKinley was born in San Francisco, California on February 22, 1880, a son of James McKinley and Eliza Howe (Fuller) McKinley. McKinley's relations included William McKinley, his father's brother. In 1898, he graduated from Canton High School in Canton, Ohio. Start of career On June 24, 1898, he enlisted for service in the Volunteers during the Spanish- American War and became a private in Company I, 8th Ohio Infantry Regiment. McKinley enlisted at the same time as his first cousin, John Dewalt Barber. William McKinley was serving as president, and some friends suggested he appoint his nephews as officers, but they preferred to enlist so they would not be accused of receiving special treatment. The unit arrived in Siboney, Cuba on July 11, 1898, performed garrison duties, and departed in August after suffering several non-combat losses due to tropical diseases. McKinley was mustered out on November 21, 1898. After being discharged, McKinley applied for a commission in the Regular Army, which he received on February 6, 1899. Appointed a second lieutenant of cavalry, he was assigned to the 6th Cavalry Regiment and served in the Philippines, including detached duty as aide-de- camp to General Samuel Baldwin Marks Young. While in the Philippines, he was promoted to first lieutenant in the 11th Cavalry, but continued to serve as Young's aide. While serving in the Philippines, McKinley took part in battles at Cullenbeng and Aligangan, for which he received Silver Star citations that were later converted to awards of the Silver Star medal. In 1901, Young returned to the United States, and McKinley continued to serve as his aide. When Young traveled to Europe to attend Imperial German Army maneuvers in 1903, McKinley went with him. In 1903, McKinley requested to return to the Philippines. He participated in several engagements in the Sulu Archipelago, and received commendations from Generals Hugh L. Scott and Leonard Wood. McKinley left the Philippines in 1906, and was promoted to captain before being assigned to duty in Cuba. He returned to the United States in 1909 and was assigned to duty with the 11th Cavalry at Fort Oglethorpe, Georgia. In 1910, McKinley was selected for attendance at the Army School of the Line, from which he graduated in 1911. From 1911 to 1916, McKinley served with the 11th Cavalry and was assigned as the regimental adjutant. World War I In July 1917, he was promoted to major. In August, he was promoted to temporary lieutenant colonel in the National Army as the military began to expand its ranks for World War I. Assigned to the 351st Infantry Regiment at Camp Dodge, Iowa, he served until July 1918. McKinley left Camp Dodge when he was promoted to temporary colonel and appointed to command the 62nd Infantry Regiment at Camp Fremont, California. Later in 1918, McKinley was assigned as an inspector general. He carried out reviews of Army units organizing and training at Camp Mills, New York and Camp Lee, Virginia before receiving appointment as inspector general for the district based at Columbus Barracks, Ohio. Later career McKinley at the time of his promotion to brigadier general in 1929 McKinley reverted to his prewar rank of major in early 1920, and was assigned as district inspector general in charge of Reserve Officers' Training Corps affairs. He was promoted to lieutenant colonel on July 1 and in September 1920 he was assigned as a district inspector general for the Fourth Corps Area with duty at Charleston Ordnance Depot, South Carolina and Fort McPherson, Georgia. On May 9, 1921, McKinley was promoted to colonel. From 1922 to 1924, McKinley was adjutant of the 1st Cavalry Division at Fort Bliss, Texas. On March 14, 1923, he transferred to the Adjutant General's Department. From 1924 to 1927, he was adjutant of the Eighth Corps Area, based at Fort Sam Houston, Texas. From 1927 to 1929, McKinley was adjutant of the Panama Canal Department. In 1919, McKinley was promoted to brigadier general and assigned as Assistant Adjutant General of the Army. He was promoted to major general on June 1, 1933, and succeeded Charles H. Bridges as Adjutant General of the Army. McKinley served as the Adjutant General until retiring on October 31, 1935, and was succeeded by Edgar Thomas Conley. Later life After retiring, McKinley was president of the Fort Sam Houston National Bank. He died at his home in Terrell Hills, Texas on January 17, 1941. McKinley was buried at Fort Sam Houston National Cemetery. Family In 1912, McKinley married Margaret Disoway (1890-1979). They were the parents of three children -- Margaret (1913-1989), William (1916-1957), and James (1918-2001). Margaret McKinley was the wife of Army general John Cogswell Oakes.

Her werewolf paranormal romance series started with Heart of the Wolf which Publishers Weekly named as one of their Best Books of the Year, 2008.PW's Best Books of the Year She is also the author of the jaguar shifter series, Heart of the Jaguar which started in 2012 with the novel Savage Hunger and the cougar shifter series, Heart of Cougar which is self-published.  Biography  A Distinguished Military Graduate, DMG, of West Texas State University, she was one of the first graduates of the United States Army Reserve Officer Training Corp two-year program, member of the military honor society, Scabbard and Blade, and retired as a Lieutenant Colonel from the USAR. She is a graduate of Monmouth University's MBA program and was featured in their Alumni magazine. She has written for a number of genealogy magazines for both the United States and Canada, short romances for confessionals, and articles for a teen magazine. Heart of the Wolf received the 2008 Fall N.O.R. Reader Choice Awards for Best Paranormal Romance. The urban fantasy series shows a contemporary world where humans who shape shift into wolves are so realistically portrayed, Publishers Weekly had this to say about Heart of the Wolf, \\"The vulpine couple's chemistry crackles off the page, but the real strength of the book lies in Spear's depiction of pack power dynamics, as well as in the details of human‚àíwolf interaction. Her wolf world feels at once palpable and even plausible.\\" And from Romantic Times, \\"A solidly crafted werewolf story, this tale centers on pack problems in a refreshingly straightforward way. The characters are well drawn and believable, which makes the contemporary plotline of this story of love and life among the lupus garou seem, well, realistic.\\" When interviewed, Spear talks about what influenced her to write such a realistic werewolf world: \\"For my wolf tales, Jack London‚Äôs Call of the Wild and White Fang helped influence my love of wolves and of their survival instincts, just like humans‚Äô instincts to survive. I also was influenced by the way he told part of the story from the humans‚Äô perspective and the wolves‚Äô. Ironically, I hadn‚Äôt read them since I was a teen, but only vaguely recalled this about his works as I began Heart of the Wolf. Yet they still influenced my desire to make the werewolf world as close to the real world as possible.\\" Bibliography =Wolf Shifters (lupus garous)= =Silver Town= Silver Brothers #Destiny of the

","title":"Terry Spear"},{"id":"23168250","text":"The military history of Ireland comprises thousands of years of armed actions in the territory encompassing the island of Ireland. Early history The Battle of Clontarf in 1014 saw a large force of Vikings and their Irish allies defeated by the forces of the High King of Ireland. Ireland was never invaded by the Roman Empire, and the island remained a warring collection of separate kingdoms throughout its early history. Although it is known that the Romans traded with the Irish kingdoms, historically it was thought that the Romans never established a military presence in Ireland. In recent times the find of ruins of a possibly Roman fort in Drumanagh near Dublin has questioned this belief. In the 5th century, Irish tribes known to the Romans as the Scoti invaded northern Britain, displacing the native Picts and establishing the kingdom of D√°l Riata. As this kingdom expanded in size and influence, the name of the tribe was applied to all its subjects ‚Äì hence the modern terms Scot, Scottish and Scotland. The English annal writer, Bede, wrote how the Scoti harassed the Romano-British in piratical and border raids. The Vikings pillaged monasteries on Ireland's west coast in 795, and then spread out to cover the rest of the coastline. The north and east of the island were most affected. During the first 40 years, the raids were conducted by small, mobile Viking groups. From 830 on, the groups consisted of large fleets of Viking ships. From 840, the Vikings began establishing permanent bases at the coasts. Dublin was the most significant settlement in the long term. The Irish became accustomed to the Viking presence and culture and in many cases became allies, with intermarriage common throughout Ireland. A major Irish battle involving Vikings was fought at the Battle of Clontarf in 1014, in which a large force of Vikings and their Irish allies were defeated by the gathered Irish forces of Brian Boru, then the High King of Ireland along with a small contingent of Viking defectors. After this date Viking activity was sporadic with various Kings and nobles attempting to extend their power base. In 1099, Magnus Barefoot, the King of Norway, and his Viking army had successfully campaigned alongside their Irish allies against opposing Irish warbands. On his return his force was ambushed and killed on the north coast of Ireland. Norman era The Marriage of Strongbow and Aoife by Daniel Maclise, depicts the Norman invasion of Ireland, and the marriage of the Anglo-Norman lord Strongbow to the Irish princess Aoife. A century after the Norman invasion and conquest of England, the Anglo-Normans would turn their attention to Ireland. Anglo-Norman barons settled in Ireland from the 12th century, initially to support Irish regional kings such as Dermot MacMurrough the King of Leinster. During this period several Norman lords became so entrenched in Irish culture that they became known as Hiberno-Normans. A large swath of Ireland became a nominal feudal possession of the Anglo-Norman King of England and his various nobles, this period was marked by centuries of intermittent warfare caused by shifting alliances between Irish nobles and the Anglo-Norman barons. Kingdom of Ireland In 1542 the Kingdom of Ireland was established to replace the older Lordship. A major attempt at reform was begun with the intention to establish effective royal control over the whole island. This partly took the form of a surrender and regrant policy towards the leading Gaelic leaders. Attempts at legal reform were also accompanied by military interventions by the Royal Irish Army, a standing force, in a succession of brutal conflicts with the various Gaelic leaders, starting with Silken Thomas's rebellion, followed by the Desmond Wars and Nine Years' War. Afterwards, the new Army was tasked with defending Ireland from Continental invasions. The Battle of the Boyne was fought during thet Williamite War in Ireland, a conflict fought between Jacobites and Williamite forces. In the 16th century, relations between the Irish and English were complicated by religious and political differences. The differences rose to a peak during the 17th century with the Irish Confederate Wars and the resulting 1649‚Äì53 Cromwellian conquest of Ireland and partial colonisation. After the Williamite war in Ireland ended in 1691, the resulting Treaty of Limerick ensured Catholic Irish civil and religious freedoms. However, with the ongoing wars of England against the Catholic power of France and the Papacy's open support for the ousted King James II, suspicion of Irish Catholic loyalty resulted in a series of penal laws being enacted, within a few years of the signing, to ensure the removal from power of the Roman Catholic majority. Many Catholics continued to support a Jacobite restoration, and served in the armies of France and Spain committed to the Jacobite claimants. This process became known as the Flight of the Wild Geese. Irishmen in the British Army Irishmen fought in the British Army in large numbers throughout its history. Professor Richard Holmes calculates that at the time of the American Revolutionary War, sixteen percent of the rank and file and thirty-one percent of the commissioned officers were Irishmen.Holmes, p.54 Several Irish regiments gained special distinction for their bravery and discipline in the Napoleonic wars, such as the southern 88th (Connaught Rangers) and the northern 27th (Inniskilling) both of whom would go on to acquire long and distinguished service records. Despite conscription not being extended to Ireland in the First World War, over 200,000 Catholic and Protestant Irishmen volunteered to serve in the British Army.Irish Regiments in the World Wars A former member of the Irish Yeomanry (centre) who defected to the United Irishmen in the Irish Rebellion of 1798. Irishmen fought in the British military in large numbers, some of whom would later use their training to fight for Irish independence. Some Irishmen who served in the British Army would later use the training provided to fight for Irish independence. The United Irishmen encouraged members to join the army and the 1798 rebellion saw many instances of desertion from the militia, sometimes on the field of battle. Michael Dwyer's guerilla band was largely made up of deserters from the militia and the Irish Republican Brotherhood had many cells in the British Army waiting to take part in the planned Fenian Rising. Many IRA members during the Easter Rising and War of Independence were veterans, including some of the leaders, such as James Connolly and Tom Barry and in 1920 the Connaught Rangers mutinied in protest against reports of against British atrocities in Ireland which led to the execution of James Daly, the last execution for mutiny in the British army. Republic of Ireland/Northern Ireland Until 1922 secret societies, popular risings and guerrilla warfare came in sporadic outbreaks in attempts to end the 1801 union of Ireland and Great Britain. Between 1919‚Äì1922 the War of Independence brought the negotiation of the Anglo-Irish Treaty and the majority of Ireland seceded from the United Kingdom to form an independent state, which immediately fell into a civil war between opposing republican factions. The northern portion of the country would form Northern Ireland becoming an autonomous part of the United Kingdom. After the Irish Free State gained a new constitution in 1937, the now fully sovereign nation was steered towards neutrality in the event of any war involving the United Kingdom. This neutrality continued throughout the Second World War, a period known in Ireland as The Emergency while Northern Ireland was exempted from conscription. Despite this many Irishmen from the both parts volunteered to serve in the British army during the war. In total over 100,000 Irishmen served in roughly equal numbers from north and south of the Irish border. Five Irishmen were awarded the Victoria Cross for their efforts during the war. Markers spelling out \\"EIRE\\" were erected during World War II to alert belligerent aircraft that they were in neutral Ireland. The Republic of Ireland continued the policy of neutrality after the war and declined to become a member of NATO, although it has taken part in over 30 United Nations peacekeeping missions. In Northern Ireland, paramilitary groups and terrorism emerged again in the 1970s, after a relative peace for almost 50 years. A peace process in the mid-1990s ended in a cease-fire and a declaration that \\"the war is over\\". Irish people have also served prominently in the Spanish, French and United States military. Amongst them, the founders of the US Navy, John Barry, and Argentine Navy, William Brown. After coordinated terrorist attacks killed more than 130 people in France in November 2015, the French government invoked a mutual defence clause of the Treaty of Lisbon, asking for military assistance from the European Union. The Irish government agreed to deploy peacekeeping troops to Mali in order to free up French troops stationed there for deployment elsewhere.

History The first windmill in Ardeley parish was built at some time between 1192 and 1222, in which year its existence is first documented. A windmill was stated to be \\"in ruins\\" in 1374 and another is mentioned in 1576, when it was sold to William Crane, and it is believed to have remained in his family for some 200 years. No windmill is shown on John Seller's map dated 1676 or Herman Moll's map dated 1700. Despite the omission from the latter map, tree-ring counts on the Mainpost show that the tree was felled in the spring of 1679,\\"Dendrochronological Analysis of Timbers from Cromer Windmill Hertfordshire\\". - ARCUS 394 May 1998, Ian Tyers, ARCUS Dendrochronology, University of Sheffield. and a partially cut-away date on another timber reads 1681. In 1719, Matthew Crane was the miller. In 1773, John Pearman of Luffenhall inherited the mill from his uncle, John Crane. Pearman sold the mill to Thomas Pearman in 1800. In 1822 the mill passed to William Munt, who worked the mill until his death in 1837, when the mill passed to his widow Edith, who worked it until 1856 when her son David took over. A local resident reported having found the mill one morning in the 1860s \\"lying a shattered mass of timber across the road\\". Although there is no actual record of this it is supported by dendrochronology dating of the east-west crosstree to 1840-85. If this timber failed in a westerly wind the mill would indeed have fallen across the road. In 1869 David Munt sold the remains of the mill for ¬£600 to William Boorman in 1869, who already had a blacksmith's business in Cromer village. Boorman did not just rebuild the mill, he modernised it by fitting single-shuttered patent sails, and it is believed that he was also responsible for the significant amount of ironwork in the machinery, and for the fantail and roundhouse.Bonwick, Luke (1999). - \\"Cromer Windmill History and Guide\\". Hertfordshire Building Preservation Trust. He died in 1877 leaving the mill to his widow Emily. She ran the mill until 1888, when her son Ebenezer took over. A steam engine was being used as auxiliary power by this time, driving a set of stones at the mill house down the hill to the village. The mill was sold to Samuel Woollatt in the 1890s, but Ebenezer continued to work it until 1898, when Joseph Ponder Scowen bought it. During this period double-shuttered sails replaced the single ones, but it is not known which miller did this. In 1914 local carpenters Clem Reed and his father replaced those sails with a set of the current unique type. When a new long stock was imported from Sweden, the journey through Buntingford was not without difficulty as the stock went through a cottage window at one point. The steam engine had been replaced by an oil engine by 1919, which worked a pair of millstones on a hurst frame outside the roundhouse. Scowen worked the mill until his death in 1920. The mill was worked by Joseph Ponder Scowen's widow Marian for a couple of years, and in 1922 Richard Hull took the mill. Hull worked the mill until 1930, apparently using the oil engine after 1923, since the fantail had blown off by 1926 and one of the sails had been blown off by July 1929. The other three sails had been taken down by 1932 and the mill became derelict. In 1938, organised by Captain Berry, a group of people who were concerned not to lose a major piece of local history re-boarded and painted the buck. Without this there would be no windmill in Hertfordshire today. During the war Ardeley Home Guard used the mill as an observation post, and cut a hole in the roof to spot enemy aircraft and parachutists. Despite this the buck survived intact otherwise, but by 1964 it was becoming dangerous and was threatened with demolition. In 1966 members of the fledgling Hertfordshire Building Preservation Trust launched an appeal, and raised ¬£4000 to enable a first phase of restoration to take place between 1967 and 1969. The mill was given to the Trust in 1967 by the owner George Turner of Cottered,Smith, Arthur c. (1986). - \\"Windmills in Hertfordshire\\". Stevenage Museum Publications. and the Trust determined to restore it to the condition in which it last worked. J. A. Elliott Ltd of Bishops Stortford rebuilt the roofs of the mill and roundhouse and re-boarded the buck. New stocks and sail frames (not of last working type), and a new tail ladder and skeleton fantail were made by E. Hole and Sons, the Burgess Hill millwrights. Further major structural repairs constituted Phase 2 in 1979/80. These were carried out by Millwrights International Ltd, and included work to prevent infestation by Death Watch beetles. and removal of sails and brakewheel. By 1989, thanks to a report by English Heritage, funds became available for Phase 3. At this point there was an unrealised proposal to use a helicopter to move the mill to a new site near Letchworth, where it could be rebuilt and put to work. In 1990, Phase 3 work carried out by Dorothea Restorations Ltd of Bristol included a new weather beam, rebuilding and fitting the brake wheel and making and fitting replicas of the last working sail stocks and frames. On 8 May 1991 the mill was opened to the public for the first time. Phase 4 in 1998 involved replacement of the meal beam; reconstruction of the bin floor; making and fitting of sail shutters, striking gear and stone furniture, and restoration of the internal machinery. This work was carried out by The Chiltern Partnership, funded by the Heritage Lottery Fund and English Heritage and returned the mill to virtually full working order. The mill was officially reopened on 21 June 1998 by Richard Whitmore Description Cromer Windmill is a post mill with a single storey roundhouse. The trestle, entirely made of oak, is enclosed by the roundhouse. The main post is square at its lower end, and diameter at the crown tree. It is long. The crosstrees, long. are carried on four brick piers of about height. The four quarterbars are each long. The body measures by in plan, and is in height. The mill is high overall. It is winded by a fantail mounted on the ladder. The four Patent sails are of unique configuration, with one-piece shutters spanning the full width of both leading and driving sides of the sails. Each sail is long and wide, spanning . They are carried on a cast iron windshaft which replaced an earlier wooden one. The windshaft carries a wooden clasp arm brake wheel with 72 cogs. The brake wheel drives a cast iron wallower with 18 teeth, carried at the top of the cast iron upright shaft. At the lower end, the cast iron great spur wheel with 64 wooden cogs drives the two pairs of underdrift millstones located in the breast of the mill via cast iron stone nuts with 32 teeth.

At club level, he played in the Allsvenskan for Hammarby IF and √ñrebro SK, in the Football League for Birmingham City, and in the Danish Superliga for AaB. Club career Sahlin was born in Falun. He began his football career with Nyn√§shamns IF, and later played for Division 3 club V√§sterhaninge IF while also playing bandy at elite level. Sahlin came late into top-class football: he was nearly 28 years of age when, after lengthy negotiations, he joined Allsvenskan club Hammarby IF in February 1995. His debut was eventful: after 11 minutes 3 seconds, he scored the first goal of the 1995 Allsvenskan season, and in the 44th minute he received his second yellow card. He finished the season with 12 league goals and another 3 in the Swedish Cup, but his club were relegated. In November 1995, Sahlin made his international debut for Sweden, after which he went to England to join Division One (second-tier) club Birmingham City on loan. He made his debut in the Football League on 26 November 1995 in a 2‚Äì2 draw at home to Leicester City, coming on as a 74th-minute substitute for fellow debutant Danny Hill. This was the only first-team game that Sahlin played for Birmingham, and he returned to Sweden in December. Sahlin returned to the Allsvenskan with √ñrebro SK. In 1997 his 14 goals earned him a share in the league top scorer's crown, together with Christer Mattiasson of Elfsborg and Mats Lilienberg of Halmstad, and the following season his 10 goals made him √ñrebro's leading scorer. In his last game for √ñSK, Sahlin scored in the 89th minute to confirm a 4‚Äì2 win and take his club second in the table. In his three seasons with the club he scored 40 goals from 64 appearances in all competitions. Sahlin signed a three-year contract with Danish Superliga club AaB. In July 1998, he made his debut, opening the scoring in the 39th minute in a 4‚Äì0 defeat of AGF Aarhus. He picked up a few injuries, including a minor ankle injury which required surgery. While in hospital, Sahlin suffered a staphylococcal infection in the operated area, which despite lengthy recuperative treatment forced his retirement. He played only six games for AaB, and scored twice. International career On 15 November 1995, Sahlin made his international debut for Sweden: he came on as an 83rd-minute substitute to replace J√∂rgen Pettersson in a UEFA Euro 1996 qualifying match against Turkey which finished as a 2‚Äì2 draw. His first start for his country came on 22 February 1996, when he played the first half of the Carlsberg Cup final against Japan in Hong Kong. His third and last international appearance came in a friendly away against Lithuania in August 1997.

The burghers demanded similar privileges to those held by the nobles (szlachta). Their demands included the right to buy and own land estates, the right to be represented in the Polish parliament (Sejm) and reforms to the urban law.The Third of May Constitution The procession influenced the Great Sejm to create a Commission for the Cities (Deputacja w sprawie miast).

Eventually, the burghers' cause succeeded and the belated urban reform in the Commonwealth took place with the passage of the Free Royal Cities Act on 18 April 1791, which became a notable amendment to the Constitution of May 3.

Psimolofou rests at a height of 340 meters above sea level and it is surrounded by a number of perfectly flat hills and it is only 500 meters away from Padiaos river. Psimolofou was established as a small village since the 12th century AD. The Old village in the center has narrow streets and very old houses made of soil and hay blocks called plynths () Psimolofou () derived its name from a small hill nearby which resembles a bread (). However, most probably the name has been derived from the nearby hill - tall hill (). According to Jean Richard in a paper written in Melanges d'Archeologie et d'Histoire, Psimolophou was one of Cyprus's main centres for tanning, the craft practiced by Jewish tanners from the 14th century until the second half of the 20th century. Psimolofou has approximately 2000 residents and it has been growing steadily since the 19th century where records were kept. Up until the 1970s, most of the inhabitants were involved with agriculture - growing fruits and vegetables. Today, very few inhabitants are still farmers. Most of the residents now hold jobs or have businesses in Nicosia. Psimolofou is a fast expanding residential area very near to the city but with cooler climate especially in the summer with only detached and some semi detached houses. Psimolofou has public elementary and primary schools. The church of Psimolofou is dedicated to Panayia Katholoki which was built in the 19th century over the ruins of an older church that was destroyed by fire. It is beautifully decorated with wall paintings. Two of them from the earlier building and the rest in the very recent years. There are two other churches, a ruined one from the medieval ages and modern one built in the late 20th century. There bank with ATM, a well sized supermarket, a hardware store, a car tyres shop, 3 traditional Cyprus coffee shops and a 24-hour 365 days convenience store. Near Psimolofou at , there is a mediumwave broadcasting station transmitting on 963 kHz the 1st programme and on 603 kHz the third programme with 100 Kilowatt.

The School began life with just 15 students and in a single schoolhouse. Student numbers grew rapidly, and at one point the School rented premises at 13 campuses in the Basel region. By 1995, ISB had become an IB World School, offering the Diploma Programme (DP) of the IB. By 1999, the School became a not-for-profit company, known as the International School of the Basel Region AG. That year it broadened its scope to include the IB Middle Years Programme (MYP). In 2002, Reinach - the first of ISB‚Äôs three current campuses ‚Äì was opened. In the same year, ISB began to offer the IB Primary Years Programme (PYP). In 2007, the purpose-built campus at Aesch opened to accommodate the Junior School. Since 2012, students in the early years of the MYP have attended the campus at Fiechten. In the 35 years since its inception, ISB has grown exponentially and today educates over 1400 students representing approximately 60 nationalities. .

Bonville's father died before Bonville reached adulthood. As a result, he grew up in the household of his grandfather and namesake, who was a prominent member of the Devon gentry. Both Bonville's father and grandfather had been successful in politics and land acquisition, and when Bonville came of age, he gained control of a large estate. He augmented this further by a series of lawsuits against his stepfather, Richard Stucley. Bonville undertook royal service, which then meant fighting in France in the later years of the Hundred Years' War. In 1415, he joined the English invasion of France in the retinue of Thomas, Duke of Clarence, Henry V's brother, and fought in the Agincourt campaign. Throughout his life, Bonville was despatched on further operations in France, but increasingly events in the southwest of England took up more of his time and energy, as he became involved in a feud with his powerful neighbour Thomas Courtenay, Earl of Devon. In 1437, King Henry VI granted Bonville the profitable office of steward of the Duchy of Cornwall. This had traditionally been a hereditary office of the earls of Devon, and the Earl was enraged at its loss. The dispute soon descended into violence, and Bonville and Courtenay ravaged each other's properties. The situation was exacerbated in 1442 when the Crown appointed Courtenay to effectively the same stewardship it had appointed Bonville, which inflamed the situation even more. The feud between them continued intermittently for the next decade. Generally, Henry and his government failed to intervene between the two parties; when it did, its efforts were ineffectual. On one occasion Bonville was persuaded to undertake further service in France‚Äîprimarily to get Bonville out of the region‚Äîbut the mission was poorly funded, a military failure, and when Bonville returned the feud reignited. In 1453, King Henry became ill and entered a catatonic state for eighteen months, heightening the political factionalism that had riven his reign. Bonville generally seems to have remained loyal to the king, although his guiding motivation was to support whoever would aid him in his struggle against Courtenay. Their feud was part of a broader breakdown in law and order which eventually evolved into the Wars of the Roses in 1455. Bonville seems to have managed to avoid implication in the variable swings in political fortune which followed until 1460. At this point, he threw in his lot with the rebellious Richard, Duke of York. His new allegiance brought him little profit; his son was killed alongside York at the Battle of Wakefield in December 1460, while Bonville himself took part in the Second Battle of St Albans two months later on the losing side; with the new Earl of Devon watching, he was beheaded on 18 February 1461.  Background and early life  The Bonvilles were one of the major gentry families of late-fourteenth-century Devon, often working in close co-operation with their neighbours. The most important of these were the Courtenay earls of Devon. Bonville's grandfather had been a retainer of the 11th Earl, Edward. The historian Christine Carpenter comments, on the family's social position, that they were of sufficiently \\"landed and official status to be regarded as what might be termed 'super-knights'\\"; she echoed the medievalist K. B. McFarlane, who had previously described the family as \\"a powerful and respected element in Devon...there was no need for them to stand in dread of the great, for they were not small themselves\\". Very little of the original medieval manor house remains of Bonville's birthplace; the section shown here is from the late fourteenth century. William Bonville was born on either 12 or 31 August 1392 or 1393 in Shute, Devon, to John Bonville (d. 1396) and Elizabeth Fitzroger (c. 1370‚Äìc. 1414). William Bonville's grandfather was his namesake Sir William Bonville, who had been member of Parliament for Somerset and Devon on multiple occasions and has been described by a historian as one of \\"the most prominent west-country gentry in the late fourteenth century\\". On hearing of the birth of his grandson, a contemporary reports, Sir William \\"raised his hands to heaven and praised God\\". Along with the Abbot of Newenham, he stood godparent to the young William. The younger William was heir to both his father and grandfather; the latter‚Äîwho had married twice‚Äîhad substantially expanded the family patrimony. He has been described by the scholar Ralph Griffiths as a \\"capable, energetic and well-connected man\\". Bonville's father died when his son was four, and young William probably grew up in his grandfather's household. Grandfather Bonville died in 1408, while Bonville was still legally a minor. As was customary, King Henry IV took both Bonville's wardship and marriage into his own hands. This was valuable royal patronage, which the King granted firstly to Sir John Tiptoft, and then to Edward, Duke of York. Bonville had a younger brother, Thomas, who, by the time William came of age, had already married a cousin of Robert, Baron Poynings. This connection to the Poynings family, the historian J. S. Roskell has suggested, was instrumental in Bonville's own marriage. = Marriages and children = Bonville married twice. In 1414 he married Margaret Grey, daughter of Reginald, Baron Grey of Ruthin. Lord Grey promised to pay 200 marks to Bonville on the wedding day, and Bonville likewise contracted to settle estates to the value of ¬£100 on himself and his wife, jointly. Grey also paid another 200 marks in instalments over the following four years. Sometime between April 1426 and October 1427‚Äîwhen Bonville received a papal dispensation to marry again‚ÄîMargaret Grey died. Bonville made his next marriage to Elizabeth Courtenay, widow of John, Baron Harington. Elizabeth was the daughter of Bonville's grandfather's local associate, Edward Earl of Devon. The couple required a dispensation to marry because Elizabeth was already a godmother to one of Bonville's daughters; in the eyes of the church, this placed her within a prohibited degree of consanguinity. Elizabeth was already well connected‚Äîher brother-in-law was Lord Harington, and the Earl of Devon her nephew‚Äîand this marriage greatly increased Bonville's links to the peerage. Bonville's son and heir by Margaret, also named William, married Lord Harington's only daughter Elizabeth around 1443. Two of Bonville's daughters‚ÄîMargaret and Philippa‚Äîmarried William Courtenay and William Grenville respectively; they were both scions of cadet branches of the Courtenay family. Bonville's third daughter, Elizabeth, married an important Midlands landowner, Sir William Tailboys by November 1446. These marriages further enhanced Bonville's aristocratic and political connections. Bonville had an illegitimate son, John, by Isabel Kirkby. John married Alice Denys and was endowed in 1453. On Bonville's death, he bequeathed John a \\"substantial\\" property. He died in 1499. = Estates and wealth = Bonville's father and grandfather had both had successful careers. As such, when Bonville came of age in 1414 he inherited an income of approximately ¬£900 per annum; for context, the historian Martin Cherry says this was \\"a figure not far short of that enjoyed by the fifteenth-century earls of Devon themselves\\". His lands‚Äîcomprising 18 manors‚Äîwere situated all over England, although concentrated in Devon, particularly around Shute in the southeast of the county, and Somerset. These lands encompassed his grandfather's patrimony, with manors in Devon, Somerset, Dorset and Wiltshire. The Fitzroger estates were mainly in Leicestershire, the East Midlands, and the southeast of England in Kent and Sussex. Owing to the deaths of their husbands in 1396 and 1408 respectively, Bonville's mother and grandmother each held a third of his inheritance in dower. His mother had remarried in 1397, to Richard Stucley, an important Essex landowner. In 1410 she granted Stucley a life-interest in her inheritance, with remainder to their children. On her death in April 1414 Stucley thereby gained Devon lands worth around ¬£105 per annum as well as Wiltshire manors of the Bonville estate, including the valuable manor of Chewton. Stucley based his claim on the tradition of courtesy. On reaching his legal majority, Bonville sued his stepfather for his maternal inheritance. This struggle took over six years, but he succeeded in establishing his rights to the estates by 1422. Bonville's grandmother survived until 1426; by then Bonville had also inherited substantial estates from other relatives, including a cousin and an aunt. These brought him the manors of Yelverton and Mudford Sock, and as a result, says the History of Parliament, \\"without doubt Bonville ranked among the very wealthiest landowners of the West Country\\".  Political career and royal service  left Bonville undertook royal service in France in 1415, and joined Henry V's Agincourt campaign, travelling in the retinue of the King's brother, Thomas, Duke of Clarence. While in Normandy, sometime before his seventeenth birthday, Bonville was knighted. In 1421, Bonville acted as one of the Duke of Clarence's executors following the latter's death at the Battle of Baug√©. Roskell suggests that Bonville must have been greatly trusted by Clarence‚Äîat the time of his death, heir presumptive to the English throne‚Äîbecause the Duke had borrowed money from Bonville. Bonville had returned to England before May, when he attended parliament at Westminster. Henry V died in France in August 1422 leaving his six-month-old son Henry as his heir, and his surviving brothers, John, Duke of Bedford and Humphrey, Duke of Gloucester as the baby King's regents. The war in France continued in spite of Henry VI's youth, and Bonville returned in 1423 in Gloucester's army. Bonville fought in the campaign to regain Le Crotoy, bringing with him a retinue of ten men-at-arms and 30 archers. On his return to England, much of Bonville's time was occupied with the administration of his estates. Extensive as they were, there was occasional friction‚Äîsome of it violent‚Äîwith his neighbours. In 1427 he was engaged in a bitter feud with Sir Thomas Brooke, whom Bonville‚Äîdescribed as a \\"thrusting and able man\\"‚Äîaccused of unilaterally enclosing parkland in Axmouth and obstructing roads that Bonville's tenants needed to use. The matter went to the arbitration of Bonville's godfather, the Abbot of Newenham, who found against Brooke, who had to pay all Bonville's legal costs and reverse his enclosure. By now, Bonville was also a royal official, having been appointed Sheriff of Devon in 1423, although he received few other commissions in the county before 1430. From then on he was regularly occupied with his duties as a royal official in the region: he was a justice of the peace for Devon from July 1431, for Somerset from March 1435, and for Cornwall from November 1438. Other commissions included local inquiries into necromancy, piracy, extortion, desertion (from the Earl of Warwick's fleet in 1438), felonies, smuggling, and concealment of treasure. In 1437 King Henry VI's minority ended, and he began his personal rule. Bonville was appointed to the King's Council, being described as a \\"King's knight\\". He was zealous in combating piracy off the Cornish coast, to such an extent that in 1454 the Duke of Burgundy made an official complaint to the English government about the treatment meted out to Burgundian shipping in the area. In 1440 Bonville, with Sir Philip Courtenay‚Äîa close friend of Bonville's‚Äîcommanded a small fleet of thirty galleys to patrol the Channel. They saw little action; the occasional encounters with the enemy did not necessarily go in their favour, as on one occasion rival Portuguese merchants captured two ships from Bonville's fleet. = Feud with the Earl of Devon =  1437‚Äì1440  In 1437, Bonville was appointed Steward of the county of Cornwall for life, for which he received a salary of 40 marks yearly. This immediately made him an enemy of the young Earl of Devon, Thomas Courtenay; Courtenay's wealth was already reduced by his mother's dower, and so granting Bonville the stewardship was not only a blow to the regional hegemony the Courtenays traditionally enjoyed but reduced the earl's income further. The stewardship was a significant source of patronage to whoever held it in its own right. During the Earl's minority, Courtenay influence in Devon waned and shifted towards the county's upper gentry (\\"among whom Bonville was pre-eminent\\", argues Cherry). The historian Hannes Kleineke has argued that the minority created a power vacuum in the county which the regional gentry, such as Bonville, had helped fill. This enabled them to find new areas of profit in the absence of traditional Courtenay patronage. Bonville's (and other local gentry's) pre-eminence in Devon was found to be almost unassailable by the Earl, who wished to regain the regional authority that his ancestors had held. This friction between Bonville and Courtenay soon turned violent. The grant of the stewardship has been described by Carpenter as \\"the immediate catalyst for the Courtenay‚ÄìBonville feud, which had been threatening for some time\\". It was one of many internecine and familial feuds within the English noble families in the second half of Henry VI's reign. It was further exacerbated, in 1440, by what the Griffiths calls \\"a serious blunder\\" by the crown‚Äîa contemporary council minute described the grant as causing \\"grete trouble\\". Courtenay‚Äîin what Griffiths describes as \\"imprudent treatment\\" by the crown‚Äîwas granted the office of steward of the Duchy of Cornwall. This, Cherry says, was \\"a post so similar to that held by Bonville as to be hardly distinguishable from it,\\" and disrupted an already fragile balance of power in the region. Violence between Bonville and Courtenay broke out soon after and \\"divers and many men [were] hurte\\". In November 1442 both men were summoned before the King's Council to explain themselves. Bonville attended in person and was bound over. Courtenay, says Griffiths, \\"disdainfully made his excuses\\". Bonville antagonised Courtenay by going out of his way to recruit men to his retinue who had traditionally been retained by the Earl. An arbitration took place; or, at least, a decision was imposed upon them, even if an \\"unworkable\\" one, according to the historian John Watts. Bonville was by now fifty years old and had not been abroad for nearly 20 years, but in 1443 the council‚Äîprobably hoping another stint in France would \\"divert his ample energies from the West Country\\"‚Äîappointed him seneschal of Gascony. He was not the government's only option for the post: his own retainer Sir Philip Chetwynd had been governing Guyenne since the previous November. The council intended that Courtenay should also help relieve Avranches, although in the event he did not do so. Accompanied by Sir John Popham‚Äîa \\"reliable and experienced\\" soldier‚ÄîBonville sailed in March the following year. He had indentured to provide 20 men-at-arms and 600 archers as an advance-guard to a larger expeditionary force. King Henry presented him with a personal gift of ¬£100 towards his campaign expenses. Yet it is almost certain that their fleet did not leave Plymouth for many more months. Griffiths has suggested that by now, \\"the time had passed when a modest-sized army like Bonville's would do\\". Its size had been limited by the fact that the vast majority of the men raised by the Crown were despatched to Normandy, which was considered more important. At least one ship and men (possibly amounting to a third of his army) and materiel was lost en route. Bonville focussed on assaulting the harbour, fleet and town of La Rochelle itself (French chroniclers referred to Bonville as a corsair). His campaign achieved little, and Bonville himself was seriously injured in a skirmish.  1440‚Äì1453  The western entrance of Powderham Castle, as shown in 2010; Bonville attempted to lift Courtenay's siege here on multiple occasions. Bonville was absent from England for slightly over two years and returned in April 1445. During his absence, Courtenay had become increasingly powerful in Devon. The King, though, was revealing himself to be a weak-willed monarch, unwilling‚Äîor unable‚Äîto impose the King's peace in the southwest, or, for that matter, elsewhere. Henry was under the influence of his favourite, William de la Pole, Duke of Suffolk, and Suffolk's government could not afford to alienate the Earl of Devon. Conversely, Suffolk was still an attractive ally for Bonville against the Earl, as Bonville's Lincolnshire associate and later son-in-law, Tailboys, was closely linked with Suffolk. Suffolk's policy was one of trying to keep both Bonville and Courtenay happy. Bonville's newly-acquired political proximity to Suffolk brought benefits. In 1444 Bonville joined the duke's retinue to France, where Bonville played a central role in the betrothal ceremony between King Henry and his bride-to-be, Margaret of Anjou. By a writ of 10 March the following year Bonville was elevated to the peerage. This was both in recognition of his successes in France‚Äîit had been a \\"turbulent period\\" in Gascony‚Äîbut also a reflection of the esteem Suffolk held him in. As Baron Bonville of Chewton; he was summoned to every parliament until the end of his life as Willelmo Bonville domino Bonville et de Chuton. In 1446 Bonville suppressed a revolt in Somerset, in which Wells Cathedral was attacked by \\"insurgents against the peace of the Church and the King\\". Bonville's association with Suffolk was not to last. In early 1450, the duke was impeached in the House of Lords and exiled as a result. Suffolk was subsequently murdered en route to the continent. Roskell notes that, although Bonville is known to have attended this parliament, it remains unknown what position he took‚Äîif he took any‚Äîon Suffolk's impeachment. One of the most powerful critics of Suffolk's government had been Richard, Duke of York, and the Earl of Devon soon allied himself with the duke as a means of furthering his position in the West Country. Courtenay saw his newly- reinforced position as sufficiently secure to allow him to reignite the feud with Bonville, who in Taunton was recruiting men to his banner at sixpence a day. To this end he launched a series of raids onto Bonville properties, which culminated in Courtenay's besieging of Bonville's Taunton Castle with a force of over 5,000 men‚Äîa crisis that the contemporary chronicler William Worcester described as \\"maxima perturbatio\\". Fighting alongside Courtenay was Edward Brooke, Lord Cobham, son of the Thomas Brooke whom Bonville had feuded with over a decade previously. Courtenay's alliance with York was not as strong as the Earl believed, and when York arrived in Devon to restore order, he promptly cast both Bonville and Courtenay, with many of their retainers, into prison for a month. Bonville was forced to put Taunton Castle into the duke's custody. This particular phase of the feud was suspended by the holding of a loveday (dies amoris) between Bonville and Courtenay at Colcombe in 1451. This was an important enough political event for it to warrant the attendance of Richard, Lord Rivers and his wife Jacquetta, Lady Rivers as the King's representatives. The Earl of Devon's continuing alliance with York brought Courtenay further problems in 1452. By then, York felt excluded from the government as the King had a new favourite, Edmund, Duke of Somerset. In February that year York rebelled and marched on London with a large force. He faced the King's army at Blackheath, southeast of London. Courtenay stood alongside him. Somerset and much of the rest of the nobility faced York and Courtenay down: they surrendered without a fight. Bonville had raised a body of men to join the King's army, and subsequently profited from Courtenay's disfavour with the King. The historian A. J. Pollard suggests that Bonville was given \\"a free hand\\" in the region as a result of York's and Devon's eclipse and according to Cherry, this allowed Bonville to become the predominant figure in county politics. He was commissioned to oversee the arrest and prosecution of the Earl of Devon's men after Blackheath, and the following year King Henry demonstrated the esteem Bonville stood in when, during Henry's royal progress through the southwest, he stayed at Bonville's caput of Shute. Bonville received further offices and responsibilities. He was confirmed as steward of the Duchy of Cornwall, reappointed seneschal of Gascony and also made lieutenant of Aquitaine. Bonville has been described by historians connected to The Gascon Rolls Project as being \\"an excellent choice for lieutenant\\" and received the constableship of Exeter Castle. He also received grants of lands and estates in South Teign, the castle, borough and manor of Lydford, the conservancy of the River Exe, and forestry rights in Dartmoor, making him, wrote the historian Bertram Wolffe, \\"exalted in the west country\\". Bonville never took up his seneschalcy as what remained of England's territorial possessions in France were lost at the Battle of Castillon in July 1453. King Henry‚Äînow in Exeter‚Äîappointed Bonville to a large commission of oyer and terminer to investigate sympathy for York's rebellion in the area, and the King made him a gift of ¬£50. = Henry's illness and Yorkist government = Map of the location of the Clyst engagement, 1455In August 1453, King Henry suffered a period of illness and mental collapse during which he was unable to respond to people or stimulus. He was, therefore, unable to carry out his royal duties. The Lancastrian regime, already weakened by factionalism, was paralysed, and the national political scene became increasingly tense. Bonville attended a council at Westminster in early 1454. This, a Paston correspondent reported, was only after he had \\"maken all the puissance they can and may to come hider [to Westminster] with theym\\". It was rumoured that Bonville was planning to join up with other lords‚Äîthose of Beaumont, Poynings, Clifford and Egremont‚Äîand march on London itself, although in the event this did not occur. Everyone, including Bonville, was preparing for war on a national scale. The House of Lords eventually appointed the Duke of York as protector of the realm during the King's incapacitation, and York appointed Salisbury chancellor. Although Courtenay was nominally York's ally, the Earl did not see any major benefits from this relationship. (York's other allies, argues John Watts, the Nevilles, received York's assistance in their on-going feud with the Percies in Yorkshire.) Bonville experienced no lessening of his position during the protectorate; indeed, he had committed flagrant acts of piracy against foreign shipping off the southwest coast, which went unpunished. The most prominent victims of Bonville's actions were the Duke of Burgundy's merchants; Burgundy was England's ally on the continent, a position which Bonville's ships endangered. = Battle of St Albans and Bonville's ascendancy = In early 1455 King Henry made a sudden recovery. York and Salisbury were removed from their positions in government and retired to their estates. National politics, already heavily partisan, was tense. The King summoned a great council to be held in Leicester in May. Several chroniclers of the day suggest that Somerset was poisoning the King's mind against York. He and the Nevilles may have feared imminent arrest. In any case, they reacted swiftly and with violence. They ambushed the King's small army at the First Battle of St Albans on the 22nd in a pre-emptive strike. Courtenay fought for the King and was wounded. Bonville may also have been sympathetic to the royal cause, as one of his pursuivants was used as a messenger by the King's councillors. He did not join the royal army, however. Michael Hicks has suggested that both Bonville and Courtenay were more interested in prosecuting their own feud than the national one. King Henry had been captured by the Yorkists after the battle: once again they controlled the government. Although clearly unwilling to turn against his King at this point, Bonville did attend the Yorkist parliament of September 1455, where he voted in favour of the Duke of York's appointment as protector. Bonville was appointed to the parliamentary committee set up to improve naval defence. He also used his local influence to ensure that the vacant Bishopric of Exeter was reserved for the Earl of Salisbury's youngest son, George Neville, and in November Bonville received a general pardon. In the southwest, Bonville and his ally, James Butler, Earl of Wiltshire (also at this time very close to the court) were recruiting heavily. They caused a proclamation \\"to be cryed at Taunton in Somersetshire that every man that is likely and wole go with theym and serve theym shalle have vjd. [sixpence] every day as long as he abideth with theym\\". Bonville's dominance in the southwest forced the Earl of Devon to respond drastically, and at the end of April 1454 Devon brought an armed force of hundreds of men into Exeter in a planned ambush. The plan failed, but Bonville was prevented from carrying out his duty as a collector of a royal loan. Although in the following June both Bonville and Courtenay were instructed by the King to keep the peace‚Äîand each bound over for ¬£4,000 to do so‚Äîthey appear to have continued their war of attrition. Such was the \\"anarchic state of affairs\\" in Devon following St Albans that the Michaelmas term judicial sessions that were due to be held in Exeter had to be cancelled. Courtenay went on to terrorise the county with his army and ransacked Bonville's houses. This culminated on 23 October 1455 with what has been described as the \\"most notorious private crime of the century\\", when Courtenay's son‚Äîalso Thomas‚Äîand a small force of men attacked and brutally murdered one of Bonville's close councillors, the prominent local lawyer Nicholas Radford. Carpenter comments: \\"there were other enormities, principally directed against Lord Bonville. Nothing was done\\". = Bonville's challenge and Courtenay's ascendancy = Radford's murder marked the beginning of a brief campaign‚Äîa \\"range war\\"‚Äîbetween the two sides, even more violent than had gone before; which, says Griffiths, turned the region \\"periodically into a private jousting-field\\". Edmund Lacey, the Bishop of Exeter, complained that his tenants \\"dared not occupy the land\\". Bonville retaliated against Courtenay by looting the Earl's Colcombe manor; says the historian John Gillingham, \\"on both sides houses were pllaged, cattle driven off, and plenty of plunder taken\\". Determined to \\"bring Devon [Courtenay] out into the open on as equal terms as possible\\", says the historian Michael Hicks, and believing himself to have the \\"backing of God, the law, and the commonweal\\", on 22 November 1455 Bonville challenged Courtenay to a duel, albeit for both men to be accompanied by their retainers. He may also have been attempting to draw the Earl out of the city of Exeter, which Courtenay had been occupying for over a fortnight, or to distract him from his siege of Powderham Castle, which Bonville had already twice attempted unsuccessfully to lift. Courtenay had no choice but to take up Bonville's challenge, which openly informed the Earl that \\"all due salutacions of friendlihode [were now] laide aparte\\". On 15 December the two sides met in battle near Clyst St Mary, to the east of Exeter. \\"Moche people wer sleyn\\": Although the engagement appears to have been somewhat inconclusive, if anyone lost, it was Bonville, who managed to escape alive, although, suggests Hicks, dishonoured, as he had been the challenger. Two days later, Courtenay attacked Bonville's Shute residence, pillaging it thoroughly and carrying away much booty. Courtenay continued his campaign against Bonville for two months. Neither party had sufficient military or political weight to crush their opponent, and, \\"nasty as they were, there was little danger of the fights spreading geographically\\". Outside the region, the national political situation had become increasingly fraught with tension, and the Bonville‚ÄìCourtenay feud soon became just one battlefield in the broader one of the civil war. The Earl was subsequently imprisoned, although only for a short period, and died in 1458 with neither the feud resolved or Bonville beaten. Bonville was made a Knight of the Garter the same year.  Wars of the Roses  escutcheon on easternmost of north aisle piers in St Clement's Church, Powderham, showing the arms of Courtenay of Powderham impaling Bonville. These are the arms of Sir William Courtenay (d. 1485), husband of Margaret, daughter of William, Lord Bonville Courtenay, by his actions at St Albans, had earned the support of Henry's powerful Queen, Margaret, who was by now implacably opposed to the Yorkist party. His son Thomas, who inherited the earldom, married the Queen's cousin, Marie de Maine, and in 1458 Bonville's grandson married Katherine Neville, daughter of the powerful northern magnate Richard Neville, Earl of Salisbury. The modern historians Roskell and Woodger in the History of Parliament suggest that throughout this period Bonville managed to conceal any sympathy for the Duke of York and remained \\"outwardly loyal to Henry VI\\". The historian Charles Ross has described Bonville during this period as \\"a veteran servant of the House of Lancaster, who had been promoted to his peerage by King Henry VI [and who] clung to the court he had always served\\". He swore to uphold the rights of young Edward, Prince of Wales against the Yorkists at the 1459 Parliament, and in early 1460 he was commissioned to raise an army in the southwest. Within a few months, say Roskell and Woodger, Bonville \\"revealed his true colours\\" and fought for the Yorkists at the Battle of Northampton in June 1460. Here the victorious Yorkists again captured King Henry, and Bonville was put in charge of his safe-keeping. Bonville attended the parliament of November that year which passed the Act of Accord. This act effectively granted York the throne on Henry's death, and thus disinherited the Prince of Wales. Margaret and her nobles withdrew to the north, where they gathered an army and began to pillage the Yorkist lords' estates there. York and the Earl of Salisbury, with their smaller army, marched north the following month; Bonville remained in London. Bonville's son William marched with York, and died with him at the Battle of Wakefield, where the Yorkist army went down to a crushing defeat by the Lancastrian army on 30 December 1460. = Second Battle of St Albans = The Lancastrians proceeded to march south; Salisbury's son, Richard, Earl of Warwick, had been left in charge of the King in London. Bonville, who had been in the southwest raising an army, returned to London. Warwick, Bonville and other lords left the capital on 12 February 1461 with an army to intercept the Queen's force before the latter could reach the city gates. They encountered each other at the Second Battle of St Albans on 17 February 1461. Bonville‚Äîalong with Sir Thomas Kyriell‚Äîwas placed in charge of the King, whom the Yorkists had brought with them as the \\"nominal\\" head of their army (said the early 20th-century historian C. L. Scofield). They were responsible for Henry's protection during the battle. This, suggests Ross, may indicate that even at this late stage Bonville was still primarily motivated by a wish to protect the King he had served since youth. Warwick's force was rapidly isolated by the swift-moving Lancastrian army, and Warwick fled, leaving the field‚Äîand King‚Äîto the victorious Lancastrians. Bonville and Kyriell were also captured. The following day they were summoned before the Queen and Prince Edward, and it is possible that both had been promised a pardon by the King. However, in the presence of the Earl of Devon‚Äîand probably at his instigation‚Äîthe two were tried for treason. The result was a foregone conclusion. Prince Edward \\"was jugge ys own selfe\\", and sentenced them to death. Both men were beheaded the same day; the executions were met with what the historian David Grummitt has described as the \\"general condemnation\\" of contemporaries. Bonville's death extinguished the male line of the Bonville family of Chute, and, says Pollard, settled the Bonville-Courtenay \\"blood feud\\" for good.  Aftermath  Bonville's household was almost immediately dissolved, although some of his staff remained with his widow. He had left no will when he died. His estates and wealth were effectively divided three ways: between his widow; his brother; and his illegitimate son. As both Bonville's legitimate sons had predeceased him, his estates and titles passed to his one- year-old great-granddaughter Cecily suo jure. She later married Thomas Grey, Marquess of Dorset. A portion of the patrimony had been entailed in the male line by Bonville's grandfather, and these lands descended to his younger brother, Thomas, and then Thomas' son. Much of Bonville's retinue entered the employment of Humphrey Stafford and Bonville's old ally Sir Philip Courtenay of Powderham. Bonville's and Courtenay's deaths prolonged the power vacuum in Devon, and, says the historian Malcolm Mercer, \\"a dominant source of authority in the area remained elusive thereafter\\". Although executed for treason, Bonville escaped attainder due to the victory a few weeks later of Edward of York‚Äîson of Richard of York‚Äîat the Battle of Towton on 29 March 1461. The Lancastrian army was destroyed: Queen Margaret escaped to Scotland, Henry went on the run in the north, and Edward claimed the throne as King Edward IV. Following the battle, the Earl of Devon was captured and beheaded at York. Edward IV's cousin and chancellor, Archbishop of York George Neville, later called Bonville a \\"strenuous cavalier\\", and the 1461 attainder of ex-King Henry referred to Bonville's \\"prowesse of knyghthode\\". In recognition of the contribution that Bonville and his family had made to the House of York, Edward granted Bonville's widow Elizabeth a large dower. She died 18 October 1471 having never remarried.

Opened in 2011, it is owned by Sarpy County and is the home of the Omaha Storm Chasers (formerly Royals) of the Pacific Coast League, and USL League One soccer club Union Omaha. The club moved from Rosenblatt Stadium in south Omaha (in Douglas County) into Werner Park on December 17, 2010. The ballpark cost $36 million to construct and is located near 126th Street and Highway 370, less than west of Papillion in unincorporated Sarpy County. Since 2013, the Omaha Mavericks have used the venue for some home college baseball games. History From 1969 through 2010, the Omaha Royals (Golden Spikes from 1999 to 2001) played at Rosenblatt Stadium. Every year, the Royals had to go on an extended two-week road trip in late May or early June for the NCAA's College World Series. The Royals were also hobbled by Rosenblatt's size; at 23,000 seats in its final configuration, it was far too large for a Triple-A team; it had 5,000 more seats than the next-largest stadium, Buffalo's Coca-Cola Field. In hopes of providing a more intimate setting, capacity was reduced to around 8,500 for Royals games. When the city of Omaha announced plans to build a new ballpark in downtown Omaha for the CWS, TD Ameritrade Park, original plans called for it to be reduced to around 12,000 for Royals games. However, the Royals opted instead to build their own park elsewhere with a smaller seating capacity. The separate parks allow the Storm Chasers to play at home during the CWS. Groundbreaking took place August 12, 2009, and on November 11, 2010, the Storm Chasers announced they had reached an agreement with Omaha-based transportation company and longtime sponsor Werner Enterprises for the ballpark's naming rights. Per club policy, terms of the deal were not disclosed. The stadium's first event was a rivalry high school game on April 11, 2011, between Papillion's two high schools, Papillion South and Papillion-LaVista; the South Titans won, 2‚Äì0, over the Monarchs. The Storm Chasers opened the ballpark five days later on April 16 with a 2‚Äì1 victory over the Nashville Sounds, as top prospect Eric Hosmer went 3-for-3 in the victory. A statue of hometown pitching legend Bob Gibson was unveiled outside the park entrance in 2013. A pitch clock at Werner Park in 2015 In July 2015, the Storm Chasers hosted the Triple-A All-Star Game and Home Run Derby, the first time the events had been held in Omaha. The Derby, which was won by the Norfolk Tides' Dariel √Ålvarez, was held on July 13. The All-Star Game was held two days later on July 15. The Storm Chasers were represented at the game by Cheslor Cuthbert, Louis Coleman, and John Lamb as well as trainer Dave Innicca and manager Brian Poldberg, who skippered the PCL team. The IL All-Stars defeated the PCL All-Stars, 4‚Äì3. The field is aligned northeast (home plate to center field) at an approximate elevation of above sea level; Rosenblatt Stadium had a similar alignment and elevation.

He served as Vice-President of Zambia 2003-04 under Levy Mwanawasa.  Early life and career  Mumba grew up with his parents and 11 brothers and sisters in Chinsali, in a religious home. His father Sunday Mumba was a teacher and pastor at the United Church of Zambia. He was baptised as a member of the UCZ by Rev. Paul Mushindo. Mumba had his primary education at Chinsali Basic School. After getting very good grades at his Grade 7 examination, he was selected to go to one of the two best schools in the country, Hilcrest Technical High School. Whilst there, he joined the Zambia Cadet Cooperative Force (ZCCF) and rose to the rank of Provincial Commandant for Southern Province. He then went to the Zambia National Service for one-year compulsory training. Here he had hoped to become a full military man, but he changed his mind, left, and went to work in the mines on the Copperbelt province. There, he decided to join the Pentecostal Movement and joined Maranathan Church where he became a church elder under Bishop Sky Banda at age 19. The following year, in 1980, he left and founded Victory Bible Church and Victory Ministries International. In 1997, he founded the National Christian Coalition, a Christian political movement. It was registered as a political party in 1998. It participated in the 2001 Zambia general election, where Mumba emerged as 5th out of over 11 candidates. He was Zambia's High Commissioner to Canada from 2009 until 2011. On 25 May 2012, Mumba was elected as President of the Movement for Multiparty Democracy (MMD) political party, which had been in opposition since its defeat in the 2011 presidential election. He defeated rival Felix Mutati along with several other candidates.

Literature *In The Phantom of the Opera by Gaston Leroux, Erik appears at the masquerade dressed as the Red Death. *Jack London's novella The Scarlet Plague (1912) was inspired in part by Poe's story.Hammond, J. R. An Edgar Allan Poe Companion: A Guide to the Short Stories, Romances and Essays. London: The Macmillan Press Ltd, 1981: 78. In the book, much of humanity has been wiped out by a disease sometimes referred to as \\"Red Death\\". *Stephen King's novel The Shining contains several allusions to the story. For example, the line \\"and the red death held sway over all\\" seems to reference the final line of Poe's story. It is alluded to more directly in volume six of his \\"Dark Tower\\" series. *In Tom Wolfe's novel The Bonfire of the Vanities, this story is referenced in a speech given at a socialite's party by an elderly British poet and house guest, rumored to be afflicted with AIDS. *In the 374th issue of the comic book series \\"Journey Into Mystery\\" this story is quoted and referenced while Thor is burning bodies of dead mutants as a way to honor them after learning that he has been banished from Hel and could never die. *In Neil Gaiman's 1996 novel Neverwhere, a minor character briefly mentions the story \\"The Masque of the Red Death\\" when describing a fancy event at a museum. *Death in Terry Pratchett's Discworld novels references the story a couple of times; in Maskerade (which pastiches Phantom of the Opera, see below), he wears a Red Death costume at the book's climax. In The Light Fantastic, Death consoles himself after being summoned from an enjoyable party, noting that it was going to go downhill at midnight - as that's when everyone would have expected him to take his mask off. *The Chuck Palahniuk novel Haunted begins with a quote from \\"The Masque of the Red Death\\". Also, several of the rooms are colored with themes that reflect the story. *In the Dan Simmons novel The Terror, an elaborate Carnivale and masque is staged outdoors by the crew of two ice- locked ships. The crew builds a series of multi-colored compartments for the event out on the ice using the ships' rigging and different colored paints. A crew member thinks of this idea from incompletely remembering a story by Poe he read in a magazine. *The last chapter of Valerio Evangelisti's novel Il corpo e il sangue di Eymerich (The Body and the Blood of Eymerich) shares the story's title and retells its plot almost literally in the context of the book. *The second installment of the limited comic series Rocket Raccoon, \\"The Masque of the Red Breath\\", featured an insidious red cloud, the Red Breath, which attacked a masquerade and \\"erased\\" its victims from existence. * The Red Death is seen in Bradbury's \\"Usher Two,\\" one of the stories in \\"The Martian Chronicles.\\" *White Wolf's trilogy Masquerade of the Red Death is named and has some elements based on this story. *Masque of the Red Death ‚Äî an erotic, science-fiction \\"decadent\\" re-telling of the original Poe story first in webcomic format, followed by graphic novel publication, by Wendy Pini * In Tom Clancy's 2002 novel Red Rabbit, the CIA formulates a long-term plan to destabilize Communism in the Soviet Union and hasten the end of the Cold War, codenamed \\"Masque of the Red Death\\". * Cory Doctorow's 2019 novella collection Radicalized includes a story titled \\"Masque of the Red Death\\". Doctorow's story, like Poe's, follows a group of wealthy people attempting to survive a cataclysm by sealing themselves away in an isolated fortress, with disastrous results. Stage and screen *A horror film called The Masque of the Red Death was shot in 1964 by Roger Corman. It incorporates a sub-plot based on another Poe tale, \\"Hop-Frog.\\" The film stars Vincent Price, Hazel Court, Jane Asher and Patrick Magee. The film had a 1989 remake starring Adrian Paul. *In Gaston Leroux's novel The Phantom of the Opera, Erik, the Phantom, attends a ball dressed as the Red Death with the inscription \\"Je suis la Mort Rouge qui passe!\\" (\\"I am the Red Death that passes\\") embroidered on his cloak in gold. The Red Death costume shows up in both the 1925 version, 1986 musical and 2004 film of the same name, though the 1925 movie and stage production are somewhat more accurate regarding his appearance, as he bears a large feathered hat and lengthy cloak as described in the novel (although both stage and screen costume bear skull masks). Neither appearance, however, shows the inscription. The 1987 animated film also shows the Red Death scene. In the 1989 film, starring Robert Englund, Erik is also dressed as the Red Death. On the cover of Sam Siciliano's The Angel of the Opera, Erik is dressed as the Red Death. thumb180pxrightThe Phantom of the Opera dressed as the Red Death in the 1925 film. *The 1992 film Batman Returns directed by Tim Burton features a character dressed as the Red Death in the same fashion as the 1925 Phantom of the Opera at a masquerade ball. * The 2001 animated/live-action comedy Osmosis Jones features a scarlet fever virus called Thrax, who claims to be the Red Death, as the main villain.

The electronics division of the Atomic Energy Research Establishment at Harwell, UK built the Harwell Dekatron Computer in 1951, which was an automatic calculator where the decimal arithmetic and memory were electronic, although other functions were performed by relays. By 1953, it was evident that this did not meet AERE's computing needs, and AERE director Sir John Cockcroft encouraged them to design and build a computer using transistors throughout. E. H. Cooke-Yarborough based the design around a 64-kilobyte (65,536 bytes) magnetic drum memory store with multiple moving heads that had been designed at the National Physical Laboratory, UK. By 1953 his team had transistor circuits operating to read and write on a smaller magnetic drum from the Royal Radar Establishment. The machine used a low clock speed of only 58 kHz to avoid having to use any valves to generate the clock waveforms. This slow speed was partially offset by the ability to add together eight numbers concurrently. The resulting machine was called CADET (Transistor Electronic Digital Automatic Computer ‚Äì backward). It first ran a simple test program in February 1955. CADET used 324 point-contact transistors provided by the UK company Standard Telephones and Cables, which were the only ones available in sufficient quantity when the project started; 76 junction transistors were used for the first stage amplifiers for data read from the drum, since point-contact transistors were too noisy. CADET was built from a few standardised designs of circuit boards which never got mounted into the planned desktop unit, so it was left in its breadboard form. From August 1956 CADET was offering a regular computing service, during which it often executed continuous computing runs of 80 hours or more. Cooke-Yarborough described CADET as being \\"probably the second fully transistorised computer in the world to put to use\\", second to an unnamed IBM machine. Both the Manchester University Transistor Computer and the Bell Laboratories TRADIC were demonstrated incorporating transistors before CADET was operational, although both required some thermionic valves to supply their faster clock power, so they were not fully transistorised. In April 1955 IBM announced the IBM 608 transistor calculator, which they claim was \\"the first all solid-state computing machine commercially marketed\\"IBM Archives, 1955 and \\"the first completely transistorized computer available for commercial installation\\",IBM Archives: IBM 608 calculator and which may have been demonstrated in October 1954, before the CADET. By 1956, Brian Flowers, head of the theoretical physics division at AERE, was convinced that the CADET provided insufficient computing power for the needs of his numerical analysts and ordered a Ferranti Mercury computer. In 1958, Mercury number 4 became operational at AERE to accompany the CADET for another two years before the CADET was retired after four years' operation.

In the U.S. state of Georgia it travels from the Florida state line southeast of Lake Park to the Tennessee state line south of East Ridge, Tennessee. Within the state, US 41 is paralleled by Interstate 75 (I-75) all the way from Florida to Tennessee, and I-75 has largely supplanted US 41 as a major highway. Due to this, the majority of the highway is not part of the National Highway System. Like all other United States highways and Interstate Highways in Georgia, US 41 always carries a state route number: * State Route 7 (SR 7) from the Florida state line to the junction with Ball Street (US 341/SR 11 Bus.) in Perry and once again from the northern terminus of US 341 near Barnesville to US 19 / State Route 3 (Zebulon Road / Martin Luther King Jr. Parkway) / US 19 Bus. north / US 41 Bus. north / SR 155 north (Zebulon Road) south of Griffin * SR 11 Bus. from US 341 to the junction with SR 11 (Perry Parkway) entirely within Perry. * SR 11 from Perry Parkway (SR 11) in Perry to the junction with Broadway (US 41 Bus. / US 129 / SR 11 / SR 49) in Macon. * SR 247 from Broadway (US 41 Bus. / US 129 / SR 11 / SR 49) to Vineville Avenue US 41 Bus. / SR 19 entirely within Macon. * SR 19 from Macon to the intersection with SR 18 in Forsyth. * SR 18 from Forsyth to the intersection with SR 36 in Barnesville * SR 3 from south of Griffin to the Tennessee state line. Route description =Southern Georgia= US 41 looking north into Georgia from across the border with Florida US 41 enters Georgia paired with a concurrency with SR 7 southeast of Valdosta. South of the border between the states, US 41 shares a concurrency with unsigned Florida State Road 25; however that route ends upon entering Georgia. Upon entering Georgia, US 41 / SR 7 briefly pass through the southeastern corner of Echols County. The highway enters Lowndes County while heading towards Valdosta, the county seat of Lowndes. The first municipality the highway meets in southern Georgia is Lake Park. In the city, US 41 shares a brief concurrency with SR 376\\\\. To the north-northeast of Lake Park is the next town US 41 / SR 7 passes through, Dasher. Approaching Valdosta from the southeast, the highway, turns onto a bypass of the city, while business routes travel directly through the center of Valdosta. Along the bypass, US 41 / SR 7 crosses SR 94, US 84, US 221, SR 38, SR 31, and SR 125 before meeting back up with their business routes on the northwestern side of the city. North of Valdosta US 41 and SR 7 are shifted from their originally routing onto I-75 at exit 22 where the routes runs concurrently with the Interstate Highway for just under seven miles until exit 29 to the city of Hahira. At the exit US 41 / SR 7 continues north along their original path. This was done so trucks couldn't use the former routing of US 41 to bypass the Georgia weigh station on I-75. The stretch of roadway that carried US 41 until 1982 is now marked as a \\"county maintained\\" road and has a weight limit of 56,000 pounds. After leaving the interstate, the routes run concurrently with SR 122 eastward to the center of Hahira. Upon reaching the old routing of US 41 (Church Street), US 41 / SR 7 and depart from SR 122, once again heading north. After passing through Hahira, US 41 / SR 7 continue heading north through Cook County where the highway passes through the communities Cecil, Adel, Sparks, and Lenox. The only major intersection along US 41 in Cook County is with SR 37 / SR 76 (Fourth Street) in Adel. North along the path of the highway from Cook County is Tift County. Just south of the seat of Tift County, Tifton, US 41 / SR 7 meet the Tifton I-75 Business Route (Southwell Boulevard). The business route leaves Southwell Boulevard upon intersecting with US 41, beginning a northbound concurrency with the route through Tifton. I-75 Bus. / US 41 / SR 7 then pick up SR 125 heading north as the routes make their way into the city. In Tifton, the highway crosses the concurrency of US 82 / US 319 / SR 35 / SR 520 (East 5th Street). Two blocks north of US 82 / US 319, I-75 Bus. / US 41 / SR 7 / SR 125 veer sharply to the northeast at East First Street, then crosses a pair of railroad tracks. At 12th Street, all three routes make a sharp turn to the west while SR 125 branches off in the opposite direction, headed towards Irwinville. I-75 Bus. / US 41 / SR 7 runs west along 12th Street until it encounters Forrest Avenue and the route takes a sharp curve to the north that ends at Moore Street. Just north of Tifton and once again heading north, the routes meet exit 64 of I-75, this is the northern terminus of I-75 Bus., but US 41 / SR 7 proceed north, passing just to the east of Abraham Baldwin Agricultural College. After leaving Tifton, US 41 / SR 7 serves primarily as a secondary parallel route to I-75 through Turner, Crisp, and Dooly counties. =Macon and Warner Robins metro area= As US 41 / SR 7 approaches Macon from the south it enters Houston County, part of the Warner Robins metro area. South of the county seat of Houston County, Perry, US 41 continues its role as parallel to I-75. Upon entering the city limits of Perry the highway joins SR 127 and SR 224 (Golden Isles Parkway) just before an interchange with I-75 (exit 135) near the Georgia National Fairgrounds and Agricenter. After this interchange, the highway has comes to an intersection that provides access to the fairgrounds. At this intersection a spur of SR 7 travels to the fairgrounds, US 41 / SR 7 travel northeast into the center of Perry carrying SR 127 as well, while SR 224 continues east along the Golden Isles Parkway. In the center of Perry, the highway has an intersection with US 341 (Ball Street). At the intersection, SR 7 leaves US 41 travelling north along US 341 while SR 11 Bus joins US 41 heading north. Just a few blocks north of the intersection with US 341 the routes take a turn onto Macon Street now heading north. A block after that, SR 127 leaves the concurrency, heading northeast towards Kathleen. The last junction within the city limits of Perry is with a bypass of US 341 Byp. (Perry Parkway). At this intersection, SR 11 Bus terminates, SR 11 joins US 41 travelling north, and SR 11 Conn. begins, travelling with US 341 Byp. west of US 41 towards I-75 and Fort Valley. Proceeding north US 41 / SR 11 travels along the county line between Houston and Peach counties just west of Warner Robins. The highway passes then passes in and out of the irregular city limits of Warner Robins, to the west of the center of the city and Robins Air Force Base, Georgia's largest industrial complex. North of Warner Robins the highway turns northeast onto SR 49 where it joins the US 41 / SR 11 concurrency. Passing Middle Georgia Regional Airport, the highway turns north before an interchange where routes join with US 129 and SR 247 (Hawkinsville Road) and continue north into Macon. Three miles north of that interchange the highways part ways, with US 129 / US 41 Bus. north / SR 11 / SR 49 (Broadway) continuing northeast and US 41 / SR 247 (Pio Nono Avenue) turning to the northwest. A mile north of there, the highway has another interchange with I-75 which carries the Fall Line Freeway through this part of Macon. After this interchange with I-75 US 41 does not have a direct connection to I-75 until the highways are well into the southern suburbs of Atlanta. Another two miles further into Macon, US 41 / SR 247 intersects US 80 and SR 22 (Eisenhower Parkway). Next is an intersection with SR 74, which provides access to Mercer University to the west of US 41\\\\. As US 41 now travels north away from the center of the city, Pio Nono Avenue ends at an intersection with US 41 Bus. south / SR 19 (Vineville Avenue). Here US 41 Bus. ends, US 41 turns onto Vineville Avenue where it joins SR 19 heading northwest, while SR 247 leaves the concurrency continuing north. Travelling out of Macon and Bibb County and into Monroe County, US 41 / SR 19 meets I-475 just south of its northern end at I-75. From here, US 41 / SR 19 closely parallel I-75 to Forsyth. In Forsyth, SR 19 ends at a junction with SR 18 (Harold G Clarke Parkway). Harold G Clarke Parkway ends at the junction and SR 18 joins US 41 as the highway proceeds to the center of Forsyth. In Forsyth, the highway meets SR 42 / SR 83\\\\. SR 42 crosses US 41 while SR 83 has a brief concurrency with the highway within Forsyth. US 41 / SR 18 / SR 83 travel in a westerly path through the city before SR 83 eventually departs the concurrency travelling south. US 41 / SR 18 continue out of Forsyth travelling roughly to the west-northwest out of Monroe County into Lamar County and the southern limits of the Atlanta metropolitan area. =Southern suburbs of Atlanta= Hampton at the western terminus of SR 20 In the seat of Lamar County, Barnesville, US 41 briefly turns to the southwest to meet US 341 at its northern terminus. Here SR 7 joins US 41 again. Proceeding northwest around Barnesville the concurrency is joined by SR 36\\\\. Now turning to the north on the west side of Barnesville, SR 18 leaves the concurrency heading west towards Zebulon. US 41 / SR 7 / SR 36 continues north as a limited-access highway. To the north of the Barnesville city limits, SR 36 leaves the concurrency travelling northeast towards Jackson. US 41 / SR 7 curves to the northwest, leaving Lamar County and briefly passing through the northeast corner of Pike County before entering Spalding County. Upon entering Spalding County, US 41 joins US 19 and SR 3\\\\. At this junction, SR 7 meets its northern end, SR 155 meets its southern end alongside business routes of US 19 and US 41\\\\. The concurrency of US 19 / US 41 / SR 3 then proceeds north to the west side of Griffin where it bypasses the center of the city as limited-access highway. In Griffin US 19 / US 41 / SR 3 has interchanges with SR 362, SR 16, and SR 92\\\\. At the interchange with SR 92, the limited-access section of the highway ends. SR 92 begins a brief concurrency with US 19 / US 41 / SR 3, but it ends just half a mile to the north of its beginning. SR 92 leaves the concurrency, heading west. US 19 / US 41 / SR 3 then proceeds through the western tip of Henry County, traveling through Hampton where it is named Bear Creek Boulevard. In Henry County, Bear Creek Boulevard intersects first with SR 20, then passes by the Atlanta Motor Speedway and shortly after has an intersection with SR 81\\\\. US 19 / US 41 / SR 3 continues north to Clayton County where it is known as Tara Boulevard. In Clayton County, the highway enters the densely commercial and residential southern suburbs of Atlanta. Its first major intersection upon entering the county is with McDonough Road (former SR 3) in Lovejoy. Proceeding north, Tara Boulevard intersects SR 54 in the county seat, Jonesboro, here the Tara Boulevard shares a brief concurrency with SR 54\\\\. This concurrency ends when the highway meets SR 138, SR 54 leaves the concurrency to join SR 138 headed east towards the center of Jonesboro. North of Jonesboro, Tara Boulevard merges directly into I-75 while US 19 / US 41 / SR 3 veers to the north-northeast forming the remainder of a full interchange with the interstate highway. From this point northward US 19 / US 41 / SR 3 is known as Old Dixie Highway. Old Dixie Highway continues north through Clayton County, passing through Forest Park. North of Forest Park, the concurrency, now called Old Dixie Road has an interchange with the southern side of Atlanta's interstate loop, Interstate 285. =Atlanta= Entering the city limits of Atlanta, the highway now takes the name Central Avenue. Just inside the city limits, US 19 / US 41 / SR 3 has another interchange with I-75. Central Avenue briefly leaves Atlanta's city limits and enters the city of Hapeville. In Hapeville, the highway serves the northeastern part of Hartsfield‚ÄìJackson Atlanta International Airport, passing near the headquarters of Delta Air Lines. Before leaving Hapeville, US 19 / US 41 / SR 3 turns north off of Central Avenue onto Dogwood Drive. Upon reentering the city limits of Atlanta the concurrency takes the name Metropolitan Parkway as it continues directly north. Metropolitan Parkway has a partial interchange with I-85 with access only to northbound traffic and from southbound traffic. Metropolitan Parkway then passes beneath the Arthur B. Langford Jr. Parkway without direct access to it or the nearby Downtown Connector. Two blocks south of I-20 the highways name changes once more as it travels into Downtown Atlanta where it is known as Northside Drive. The route travels beneath I-20 without any direct access to the interstate. Within Downtown Atlanta, US 19 / US 41 / SR 3 runs along Northside Drive where it is joined by US 29 / Georgia Connecting Route 3 (Chapel Street Southwest). From there, US 19/ US 29/ US 41 / SR 3 runs north and then curves northeast after passing beneath SR 14 / SR 154 (Peters Street), then straight north again between Nelson Street Southwest and Markham Street Southwest. Here the routes run along the west side of the Mercedes-Benz Stadium next door to the Georgia World Congress Center. As the highway enters Midtown Atlanta, US 29 leaves the concurrency with US 19 / US 41 just to the west of the Georgia Tech campus, and turns northwest onto US 78 / US 278 / SR 8, which leaves US 19/41 heading west. The highway briefly curves northeast as it passes over some Norfolk Southern Railway lines, then turns north again at a partial interchange with Tech Parkway Northwest. Leaving the vicinity of Georgia Tech, it splits from US 19/SR 9 at an intersection with 14th Street Northeast. US 41 / SR 3 continues north along Northside Drive along the western edge of Atlantic Station towards Buckhead. Upon entering Buckhead, US 41 / SR 3 has an interchange with I-75, just north of the Brookwood Split. Continuing directly north, Northside Drive crosses over Peachtree Creek. Just over a mile north of the river crossing, US 41 / SR 3 leaves Northside Drive, heading northwest towards Marietta. This section of the highway between Northside Drive and Cobb County is called Northside Parkway. Northside Parkway travels directly towards I-75 where it has another interchange with the interstate. Directly paralleling I-75, Northside Parkway meets West Paces Ferry Road NW. The aforementioned interchange with I-75 serves as an entrance point to that road as well as Northside Parkway. Continuing north along the interstate, US 41 / SR 3 has another interchange with it, this one also provides access to Mt. Paran Road NW. After the interchange, Northside Drive veers to the northwest slightly further away from I-75. It then crosses over the Chattahoochee River into Cobb County, leaving the city of Atlanta. =Northern Atlanta suburbs to Tennessee= Kennesaw as seen from Kennesaw Mountain Upon entering the Cobb County the route is known as Cobb Parkway. Major points as the route enters in Cobb County are Cumberland Mall, an interchange with I-285, SunTrust Park, and Dobbins Air Reserve Base. US 41 continues to parallel I-75 as the highways head northwest towards Chattanooga. Heading northwest through Marietta and Kennesaw, the highway leaves the Atlanta area and enters Bartow County, through Emerson, Cartersville and Adairsville, and on into Gordon County.

History A stone Dixie Highway marker along US 41 in Houston County US 41 within Georgia was originally built as the western routing of the Dixie Highway. The western route of the Dixie Highway as designated in 1916, followed present-day US 41 south from the Tennessee border through Atlanta and Macon south to Echeconnee, Georgia. The section that would become US 41 from Echeconnee south through Perry and Valdosta to the border with Florida was paved beginning in 1919 and was later designated as a part of the Dixie Highway in 1924. In 1926, the western route of the Dixie Highway following the newer Perry and Valdosta route was officially designated as US 41\\\\. By October 1929, the majority of US 41 was paved in Georgia. The only sections that were not paved at that point were between Fort Oglethorpe and Ringgold, and another on the south side of Calhoun. US 41 served as the main north‚Äìsouth route through Georgia from its establishment all the way through the 1950s. After the conclusion of World War II, bypasses were built around the center of many towns and cities along the route, including Acworth, Adairsville, Cartersville, Emerson, Kennesaw, and Marietta. This caused businesses to vacate the central districts of those municipalities in favor of frontage along the newer routing of the highway. Upon the completion of I-75 in Georgia in 1977, US 41 was supplanted as the state's primary north‚Äìsouth highway. During the early morning hours of March 2, 2007, the Bluffton University bus crash occurred at the US 41 (Northside Drive) overpass on I-75 when a bus carrying the Bluffton University baseball team crashed, killing seven passengers. The bus traveled up an HOV exit ramp and overturned after failing to slow down to negotiate the turn. Flipping over 270¬∞, the bus dropped onto I-75 below, landing on its left side and hitting a pickup truck. The accident caused the National Transportation Safety Board to recommend such HOV exits to be more adequately marked. Major intersections In popular culture US 41 is mentioned in The Allman Brothers Band's song, Ramblin' Man written by Dickey Betts. Band members Duane Allman, Gregg Allman, and Berry Oakley are buried near the highway in Rose Hill Cemetery in Macon, Georgia.

It begins at the Tennessee state line, east of Lakeview, Georgia (and in East Ridge, Tennessee), where the roadway continues concurrent with US-41/SR-8 toward Chattanooga. It ends at the South Carolina state line, where US 76 continues toward Anderson. In Georgia, the highway travels within portions of Catoosa, Whitfield, Murray, Gilmer, Fannin, Union, Towns, and Rabun counties. It travels through North Georgia and connects Ringgold, Dalton, Chatsworth, Ellijay, Blue Ridge, Blairsville, and Clayton. Most of the highway is part of the Lookout Mountain Scenic Highway, a highway that travels through northern Georgia and through the Chattahoochee-Oconee National Forest. Route description US 76 traverses the northern part of the state and passes through the Chattahoochee-Oconee National Forest and Georgia's most mountainous region. US 76 passes through Catoosa, Whitfield, Murray, Gilmer, Fannin, Union, Towns, and Rabun counties. The following portions of US 76 in Georgia are part of the National Highway System, a system of routes determined to be the most important for the nation's economy, mobility, and defense: *From I-75 southeast of Ringgold to about Tunnel Hill *From I-75 in the northwestern part of Dalton to the eastern end of the US 23/US 441 concurrency in Clayton. This includes the entire length of SR 282, which is completely concurrent with US 76 from an intersection with US 411/SR 61 and the southern terminus of Smyrna‚ÄìRamhurst Road East in Ramhurst to an intersection with SR 5/SR 515 and the northern terminus of First Avenue in East Ellijay. History =1920s= The road that would eventually be designated as US 76 was established at least as early as 1919 as part of SR 3 from the Tennessee state line to Dalton, and SR 2 from Dalton to Clayton, and possibly farther to the east. Georgia's 1921 state map didn't show the Chatsworth‚ÄìBlairsville segment of SR 2\\\\. However, it did show SR 2 on a proposed path from Clayton to Pine Mountain. It also showed SR 65 proposed along the current path of SR 28 from Pine Mountain to the South Carolina state line. By the end of 1926, SR 2 was paved from Blue Ridge to a point about halfway between there and Blairsville. Also, the proposed section, east of Clayton, was removed from the map =1930s= By the beginning of 1932, SR 3 was paved from the Tennessee state line to Dalton. US 41 was established along this segment. SR 2 was paved from Blairsville to Hiawassee. SR 2 was built from Chatsworth to Ellijay. SR 5 was designated along the Ellijay‚ÄìBlue Ridge segment. In January, SR 2/SR 5 were paved from about Cherry Log to Blue Ridge. By August, SR 2 was built from Clayton to the South Carolina state line on its current alignment. By January 1935, US 76 was designated along SR 2 from Chatsworth to Blairsville and from just east of Hiawassee to Clayton. It is unclear if US 76 was designated between Blairsville and the Hiawassee area or east of Clayton. Between July and October, US 76/SR 2/SR 5 were paved from Ellijay to Cherry Log. By October 1936, US 76/SR 2 were paved from Dalton to Chatsworth. At the end of the year, there were two small sections of US 76/SR 2 just west of Blairsville and just west of Clayton, that were paved. By the middle of January 1938, a very small section, in the vicinity of Lake Burton, was paved. The middle of the next year had the section of US 76/SR 2 from the Fanning‚ÄìUnion county line to Blairsville was paved. Later that year, a small section of US 76/SR 2, from just east of Lake Burton to Clayton, was paved. =1940s= In the beginning of 1940, the paved section near Lake Burton was expanded slightly. By October, US 76/SR 2 were paved from east of the location of the current SR 197 intersection to Clayton. At the end of the year, US 76/SR 2 were paved from Hiawassee to the approximate location of where the Appalachian Trail crosses the highway today. In 1946, US 76 was designated along SR 2 from Dalton to Chatsworth. By the middle of 1948, SR 2 was paved from Clayton to about halfway between there and the South Carolina state line. The beginning of the next year found US 76 was designated along the section of SR 3 from Ringgold to Dalton. SR 2 was moved to an alignment near the Tennessee state line, traveling through modern-day Varnell and Crandall. SR 52 took its place between Dalton and Ellijay (it already was concurrent with SR 3 from the Ringgold area to Dalton and SR 5 from Ellijay to Blue Ridge). The entire section of US 76/SR 52, from Chatsworth to Ellijay, was paved. =1950s to 1980s= US Route 76 in Whitfield County, Georgia By the end of 1950, US 76/SR 2 were paved from Hiawassee to just east of the Towns‚ÄìRabun county line. Also, SR 2 was paved from Clayton to the South Carolina state line. By the middle of 1954, the entire length of roadway, from Tennessee to South Carolina, was paved. 1957 found SR 282 built along the current path of US 76, but only from the Murray‚ÄìGilmer county line to Ellijay. By 1966, US 76 was designated along US 41/SR 3 from Tennessee to Dalton. In 1969, SR 282 was extended west to an intersection with US 411/SR 61 southeast of Ramhurst. In 1971, US 76/SR 52 were rerouted west of Chatsworth. Before, they bypassed Spring Place. Northwest of the town, they were routed south into town and entered Chatsworth farther south than it previously did. The former route was redesignated as SR 52 Connector. In 1981, US 76 was rerouted between Chatsworth and Ellijay. In Chatsworth, US 76 turned south-southeast, along US 411/SR 61\\\\. In Ramhurst, it turned east onto a slightly re-routed SR 282 and followed that route to Ellijay. In 1987, US 76/SR 2 between Hemp and Blairsville was routed on a farther-north, and more direct, path. In 1989, SR 515 was signed along US 76 from East Ellijay to northeast of Young Harris, as it is today. Major intersections Special routes =Ringgold truck route= U.S. Route 76 Truck (US 76 Truck) is a short truck detour around a low railroad bridge in Ringgold, which is also concurrent with US 41 Truck for its entire length, which is only approximately . The highway begins at an intersection with US 41/US 76/SR 2/SR 3/SR 151 (Nashville Street) in downtown Ringgold. At this intersection, they begin a concurrency with SR 151, which ends a concurrency with the main highways. US 41 Truck, US 76 Truck, and SR 151 travel to the north-northeast on Tennessee Street. They pass the Ringgold City Hall and turn right, off of SR 151 and onto High Street. They travel to the east-southeast and cross over some railroad tracks of CSX. At an intersection with SR 151 Spur (Evitt Street), they turn right onto that highway. The three highways travel to the south-southwest and curve to the southeast. At Kittle Street, they curve back to the south-southwest. After passing the Catoosa County Fire Department building, they reach their terminus, another intersection with US 41/US 76/SR 2/SR 3\\\\. At this intersection, SR 151 Spur also ends.

The highway, along with US 72, is a major route for travel between Memphis and Chattanooga. Route description Map showing the route of US 64 in downtown Memphis. US 64 enters Tennessee on the Memphis-Arkansas Bridge in Memphis. The route shares the bridge with Interstate 55 (I-55) and US 61, US 70, and US 79. The route traverses several streets in Memphis before becoming a rural divided highway in eastern Shelby County. The highway runs directly to the east through the county seats of Tennessee's most southern counties including Oakland, Somerville, Whiteville, Bolivar, Selmer, Adamsville, Savannah, Waynesboro, and Lawrenceburg, the largest on the route between Memphis and I-65. The route then interchanges with I-65, and runs through Fayetteville, Winchester, and comes to an interchange with I-24 near Pelham. The route unofficially runs concurrent with I-24 across Monteagle Mountain, the stretch across the Cumberland Plateau, often cited as one of the most hazardous stretches of highway in the United States and splits at exit 152 near Kimball where it then enters Jasper, becoming concurrent with US 41, of which it crosses Nickajack Lake, part of the Tennessee River to Chattanooga. The route then becomes concurrent with US 11 and runs to Cleveland, where it splits and runs along US 74 into Polk County to the North Carolina state line. The section beginning in Cleveland and continuing into North Carolina is part of Corridor K of the Appalachian Development Highway System. The easternmost portion of the highway along the Ocoee River is the Ocoee Scenic Byway, a winding, two-lane road through the Ocoee River gorge. The steep terrain around the highway is subject to rockslides. This is one of the only sections of US 64 in Tennessee that is still two lanes. Ocoee Scenic Byway = Bypass route = A bypass route exists for the route in Cleveland. The east‚Äìwest route is part of a beltway around the business district known as APD-40, and stretches from I-75 to a cloverleaf interchange with US 64 and SR 60. SR 60 makes up the remainder of the route. Part of the route is controlled access, and an interchange with US 11/64 is located approximately a mile from the western terminus. History The route between Cleveland and the eastern end of the Ocoee Scenic Byway follows the route of the Old Copper Road, a wagon trail dating back to the 1830s used for transporting copper from the mines in the Copper Basin to Cleveland and Chattanooga. The route originally continued westward from downtown Cleveland, crossing the Tennessee River at a ferry in Hamilton County, through Soddy-Daisy and across the Cumberland Plateau, and joined where the concurrency splits from US 41 (now part of Interstate 24) near Pelham. This designation was removed in 1940 after the Chickamauga Dam went into operation, flooding much of the original route, and the route was moved to its present concurrency with US 11 and 41. Much of this original route no longer exists even as county maintained road. The Tennessee Department of Transportation (TDOT) has plans to restore this route with a new four lane highway and toll bridge across the Tennessee River, providing Clevelanders with a more convenient access to Nashville. The Ocoee Scenic Byway was the first National Forest Scenic Byway in the nation, designated on July 22, 1988 by the United States Forest Service (USFS). TDOT plans to remove the designation of US 64 from the Ocoee Scenic Byway, and build a new four lane route, due to the high volumes of commercial traffic passing through the area. Multiple methods have been proposed, including a route on the south side over the river and existing route, a route over nearby Little Frog Mountain, and a tunnel. In 1986, TDOT began preparations to widen the entire segment of US 64 between Memphis and Pelham to four lanes, a distance of about , or about 70% of the length of the route in Tennessee. The final project, in Hardin County, was completed in the fall of 2017. In November 2009, a massive rock slide closed the Ocoee Scenic Byway for several months. This was reportedly the largest rockslide in the area's history. Junction list State Route 40 State Route 40 (SR 40) runs as a secret, or hidden designation for US 64/US 74 from downtown Cleveland, in Bradley County to the North Carolina state line near Ducktown, in Polk County. SR 40 was also a former designation for part of APD-40, which is the origin of part of the common name of that route. State Route 433 State Route 433 (SR 433) is the unsigned designation for US 64‚Äôs southern and eastern bypass of the cities of Winchester and Decherd in Franklin County, Tennessee. The entire route is a four-lane divided highway (which is known locally as Veterans Memorial Drive), with interchanges at SR 16 (1st Avenue/Rowe Gap Road), US 41A (S College Street/Cowan Highway), and SR 50 (Nissan Powertrain Drive).

In World War II it became common practice for the submarines of the Royal Navy to fly the Jolly Roger on completion of a successful combat mission where some action had taken place, but as an indicator of bravado and stealth rather than of lawlessness. The Jolly Roger is now the emblem of the Royal Navy Submarine Service.

In Chile, during the independence battles, a paramilitary guerrilla group against the royal Spanish army composed mainly by bandits and civilians, called Los h√∫sares de la muerte (The Death Hussars) wore a Skull with two crossed femurs on the neck of their jackets. In the Estonian War of Independence the skull and crossbones were symbols of Kuperjanov's Partisan Battalion. The badge is still used in the Estonian Army by the Kuperjanov Battalion, for example 2007 in Iraq.overview (in Estonian) Though not employing a black uniform, the skull and crossbones has been used by a succession of lancer regiments in the British Army. The Queen's Royal Lancers continue to use the skull and crossbones in their emblem, inherited from its use by the 17th Light Dragoons - a unit raised in 1759 following General Wolfe's death at Quebec, with an emblem of a death's head and the words 'Or Glory' in commemoration of him.http://www.qrl.uk.com/h_home.html The cap badge was later used by the 17th/21st Lancers and its present-day successor, the Queen's Royal Lancers who are still nicknamed the 'Death or Glory Boys'.Joost H√∏lscher (Author, Illustrator): Death's Head, The History of the Military Skull & Crossbones Badge (The History of Uniform). 1st edition: √âditions Chamerelle 2013, .

The village is named after the Mosfilo, a variety of White Hawthorn making a delicious jelly, which grows abundantly in the region. It is essentially a large rural community with pine-covered hills on either side of a valley at an altitude of about 250 m a.s.l. The population is about 1500 (2009) because of an influx of both Cypriot and foreign residents over the past few years. Communications are easy with motorway connections to Nicosia (25 minutes) and Limassol (40 minutes) and an ordinary road to Larnaca and Larnaca airport (20 minutes). Historically, the earliest references are to the Ayia Thekla monastery, currently under the Archbishopric and run by an order of nuns. It has a source reputed for curing skin diseases. It was reputedly founded by Saint Helena. The old Ayia Marina church is probably 16th century, with a new one dedicated to the same saint. There is also a chapel commemorating the victims of the Helios air crash in Greece, two of whom were respected inhabitants of the village, owning a supermarket. For a village of its size, it is richly dotted with a wide variety of retail commerces, public establishments and a restaurant noted for traditional food at reasonable prices. Mosfiloti also houses a unique museum: \\"The temple of Michel Platini\\", dedicated to the famous french football player.

The DC-6 was carrying 55 passengers and 5 crew members from San Francisco, California. The DC-6 landed with no injuries to any of its 60 occupants, while both occupants of the two- person Swift died when their aircraft impacted the ground. History The two-seat, single-engine Temco Swift aircraft was a Model GC 1B, serial number 3558, manufactured on May 24, 1948. It was occupied by pilot Paul Brower, who owned the aircraft, and passenger Don Walker, both of Denton, Texas. Brower, who was 19 years old, had logged a total of 250 flight hours, but had been granted his private pilot license only 3 days earlier. Both Brower and Walker were employees of Central Airlines at Love Field, and Brower had been commuting to work in his airplane almost daily for the past few months. (Historical Aviation Accidents, 1952, Swift and American Airlines) American Airlines Flight 910, a four-engine DC-6 propliner, departed San Francisco for Dallas at 23:05 on June 27, and made three scheduled stops on its way to Dallas‚ÄìLove Field. On board was a flight crew of three, Captain G. H. Woolweaver, First Officer James R. Poe, Flight Engineer John Barrett, and a cabin crew of two flight attendants, Arlene Siebert and Anita Schmidt. 55 passengers were on board for the final segment of the flight from El Paso to Dallas. At 06:56 of the following morning, the Swift aircraft departed Denton, Texas on a VFR flight for Dallas‚ÄìLove Field, and as it neared its destination the pilot contacted Love tower for landing instructions, requesting a \\"straight-in\\" approach. Flight 910 had canceled its IFR clearance earlier, flying VFR during its final flight segment, and received landing clearance for Runway 13. The First Officer, seated on the right, was flying the aircraft, and was guiding it down the ILS glidepath and localizer, while maintaining visual contact with the ground. The crew could hear the tower give instructions to a light aircraft nearby. Collision At an altitude of 400 feet above ground level, First Officer Poe suddenly spotted the Swift under the fuselage of the DC-6 but was unable to take evasive action, and the two aircraft collided. The airliner's flight crew continued the approach and landed without incident; the DC-6 was almost completely unscathed except for some minor damage to a fuselage-mounted radio antenna and the No. 4 propeller. Capt. Woolweaver never clearly saw the other airplane and was unsure what had happened until the airliner had landed and he was able to talk to people who had witnessed the collision. Witnesses aboard the DC-6 saw the Swift fly into the No. 4 propeller, the outermost propeller on the right wing. The collision severed most of the left wing of the Swift, threw the small plane over the fuselage of the DC-6, thus damaging the airliner's antenna, and sent the craft spiraling into a northwest Dallas street. A nearby resident, Leo Zeock, heard the crash from inside his home and ran to render aid, but he found Brower and Walker already dead. The wreck subsequently caught fire and had to be extinguished by Dallas firefighters; however, the blaze was attributed to leaking avgas ignited by a cigarette discarded by a spectator, not to the crash itself. Investigation The accident was investigated by the Civil Aeronautics Board, which issued its final report on March 3, 1953. The CAB primarily attributed the crash to the failure of the Swift's pilot to exercise proper caution during his landing approach. The Swift's pilot radioed the Love tower to request a straight-in approach, but he did so much closer to the airport than recommended by flight regulations, he did not state his position, heading, or speed, and he failed to establish two-way communication to obtain a landing clearance. If a pilot could not establish clear contact with the tower, visual flight rules stated that he should only continue the approach with extreme caution under the assumption that conflicting air traffic was in the area. Instead, he continued the straight-in approach as if he had been properly cleared to land. Due to the lack of communication with the Swift, controllers were unaware of the proximity of the two aircraft until the Swift was spotted from the tower, leaving inadequate time to warn the airliner's crew of the situation. The Swift's initial position was below, behind, and to the right of the DC-6, so the Swift's pilot should have easily been able to see the large DC-6 overhead and to his left. From the viewpoint of the DC-6 flight crew, the Swift may have been in a blind spot created by the DC-6 nose structure; if not, the small silver-grey plane would be hard to see silhouetted against the ground. A contributing factor was \\"errors in judgment\\" on the part of a Love Field controller who initially instructed the Swift's pilot to turn into the path of the DC-6 upon spotting the second aircraft. The controller, who was relying on his vision to sequence aircraft for landing, initially misidentified the Swift as a larger Beechcraft Bonanza. This caused an error in depth perception, as he concluded that there was a larger aircraft behind the DC-6 rather than a smaller aircraft on a collision course. He rapidly realized his error and retracted his instruction, telling the Swift's pilot to turn away, but the small plane did not initiate a turn until seconds before the collision. Investigators discovered corroded wiring between the Swift's radio and antenna, which could explain the poor communication with the pilot. However, the radio was reportedly operating properly the day before the crash.

Biography He was the eldest son of Sir William Cookes, 1st Baronet, of Norgrove Court, Worcestershire, and his second wife, Mercy, n√©e Dinely. He began his studies at Pembroke College, Oxford in June 1667, going on to Lincoln's Inn in June 1669. Following the death of his father, he succeeded to the baronetcy in July 1672, His seat was Bentley Pauncefote at Tardebigge, Worcestershire. Both of Cookes's marriages were without issue. He died on 8 June 1701 and was buried next to his first wife in Tardebigge church on 10 June. Legacy Mural monument to Sir Thomas Cookes, 2nd Baronet and his first wife Mary Windsor, St Bartholomew's Church, Tardebigge In 1693 Cookes endowed Bromsgrove School. In his will, he then left ¬£10,000 in trust to endow a new college at the University of Oxford, or to add to an existing foundation there. Priority for acceptance should be for students from Bromsgrove School, Feckenham, and his relatives. Negotiations had begun in Cookes's lifetime, with Thomas Tenison prompting him in 1698. With the prospect of endowment for an Oxford college, Benjamin Woodroffe, Principal of Gloucester Hall, had earlier gained a charter of incorporation and laid down statutes for the new college; but Cookes did not like its terms. James Butler, 2nd Duke of Ormonde as Oxford's Chancellor made clear to Cookes in early 1700 that he favoured Balliol College as recipient; and Roger Mander the Vice-Chancellor moved to implement Ormonde's wish. John Baron, Balliol's Master, made representations for the endowment. Both parties dealt directly with Cookes and preached sermons on charity in Feckenham church (Baron in 1699, Woodroffe in 1700), as well as producing printed arguments in 1702. The will was proved on 9 July 1701, but the interpretation and execution of his intentions regarding the gift to Oxford took time to settle. It was initially decided that Magdalen Hall should be the recipient, but on 31 October 1712 the Lord Keeper, Simon Harcourt, 1st Viscount Harcourt, decreed in the Court of Chancery that Cookes's wishes were that the money, now totalling ¬£15,000, should go to Gloucester Hall. The trustees agreed to this on 16 November 1713 and Gloucester Hall was incorporated as Worcester College on 29 July 1714. Cookes left a fee-simple estate of some ¬£3000 per annum and, including the ¬£10,000 earmarked for the Oxford college, a personal estate of ¬£40,000. Norgrove Hall was left to his nephew Thomas Winford on condition that he adopted the additional surname of Cookes. Family On 28 August 1672 Cookes married Mary Windsor, the daughter of Thomas Hickman-Windsor, 1st Earl of Plymouth, and niece of George Savile, 1st Marquess of Halifax. She died on 3 January 1695, and on 6 December 1695 he married Lucy Whalley.

The AccorHotels Arena, colloquially known as Bercy in Paris, is located on the park's northern edge. Components =Gardens= The park consists of three gardens designed by architects Bernard Huet, Madeleine Ferrand, Jean-Pierre Feugas and Bernard Leroy, assisted by landscapers Ian Le Caisne and Philippe Raguin between 1993 and 1997: *The \\"Romantic Garden\\", which includes fishponds and dunes; *The \\"Flowerbeds\\", dedicated to plant life; *\\"The Meadows\\", an area of open lawns shaded by tall trees. In the northeast of the park stands the Cin√©math√®que Fran√ßaise (the former American Center) designed by Frank Gehry; on the raised terraces are the 21 sculptures of Rachid Khimoune's \\"Children of the World\\" installation, created in 2001 to honour children's rights. The park is linked directly to the Fran√ßois Mitterrand site of the Biblioth√®que nationale de France by the Simone de Beauvoir footbridge over the Seine. The area used to be an important location for Paris wine warehouses; some remains of the industry can still be seen in the park. The Mus√©e des Arts Forains is also located here. = Skatepark = Bercy Skatepark is the second biggest in Paris covering an area of 800 square metres. It is covered and it has several ramps. Graffiti is written in spray paint on the walls and the ramps. Children, families, rollerbladers, skateboarders and BMXers visit the park.

Agia is the Greek word for \\"Saint\\" .The village is named after Saint Varvara or Saint Barbara. The village is located 22 km south from Nicosia and is at an altitude of 311 meters. The village is known for its many cultivated and barren pieces of land. The hosts the Church of Agia Varvara, the Chapel of Agia Paraskevi, Chapel of Agios Nektarios and the Chapel of Holy Cross.  Economy  Residents of the village work primarily in agriculture and cultivate crops such as wheat, barley, and olives. Many residents commute to Nicosia to work as government employees, craftsmen and factory workers. The main product of cultivation is barley. The cultivation of barley is one of the main occupations. The systematic cultivation of yeast was recently initiated since viticulture used to be their primary occupation. However, that was unprofitable and vineyards were replaced with barley or olive trees. Many plots of land were rented to professional farmers for the cultivation of barley. The cultivation of olive trees is limited in the village, as it mostly serves domestic needs. Many of the inhabitants produce oil for their own use. Phytorio (nursery garden) is a small mountain, where pine trees, cypresses and brigalows were planted. This area belongs to the Forest Department. The community council plans to construct a community park next to it. This park will include a playground, a playing field and a kiosk. During spring, blossoming almond trees add a pleasant note to the plain. History Earlier a village named Agios Georgeos (or Saint George) occupied this area. Around 1400 CE, the village church was burned down, leaving only the icon of Agia Varvara intact. The villagers rebuilt the Church near the previous one and dedicated it to Agia Varvara, renaming the village in the process. Historic caverns are found in the region, and it is believed that the larger catacombs were made by the first Christians.Agia Varvara website During the time of the Kingdom of Cyprus, between 1192 and 1489, it was a fief, after which it came under Turkish rule, and 15-20 Turkish families settled in the village along with residents of Nisou.

In 2002, at the age of 28, he became the youngest chef in history to be awarded three stars by the Michelin Guide.  Biography  Massimiliano (Max) Alajmo is a part of the fifth generation of the Alajmo family self-employed as chefs and restaurateurs. After attending hotel management school, Max furthered his culinary education in the kitchens of Alfredo Chiocchetti of Ja Navalge in Moena, Marc Veyrat of Auberge de l‚ÄôEridan in Veyrier-du-Lac, and Michel Gu√©rard of Les Pr√®s d‚ÄôEugenie in Eug√©nie-les-Bains. In 1993, he began working at Le Calandre in Sarmeola di Rubano (Padua) together with his mother, chef Rita Chimetto, who had earned the restaurant its first Michelin star the previous year. On March 13, 1994, he was appointed executive chef of Le Calandre; the restaurant was awarded a second star in the Michelin Guide 1997 and on November 27, 2002 it received its third, making Max, at 28, the youngest chef ever to obtain the recognition. In 2006, the Alajmo brothers self-published their first cookbook, entitled ‚ÄúIn.gredienti‚Äù, which won Best Cookbook in the World at the 2007 Gourmand International World Cookbook Awards. In 2008, Max worked with master perfumer Lorenzo Dante Ferro, studying the sense of smell as it relates to the dining experience. After more than a year of research, Max launched a line of pure essential oil sprays, Le Essenze, to be used as ‚Äútaste accelerators‚Äù. In early 2010, the Alajmo brothers remodeled the dining room of Le Calandre, using Max's culinary philosophy as their guide. They selected the materials to redecorate the dining room with the same focus and dedication that Max uses when sourcing ingredients. The remodel of the dining room also led to the creation of Alajmo Design, a line of objects (glasses, tableware, cutlery) designed by the Alajmo brothers and produced by renowned Italian craftsmen. In January 2011, the Alajmo family took over Gran Caff√® & Ristorante Quadri, located in St. Mark's Square, Venice and after the Caff√® Stern https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caff√®_Stern Wikipedia (Fr) in the Passage des Panoramas. Since February 2013, Max has been a member of the board of directors and professor at the Master della Cucina Italiana, a culinary school developed to shape a new generation of chefs whose training goes beyond technique. Currently, Max is the chef of Le Calandre and oversees the kitchens of his other restaurants, Quadri and La Montecchia, and the bistros Il Calandrino, abc Quadri and abc Montecchia. In addition, he is actively involved with Il Gusto per la Ricerca, a non-profit association founded by the Alajmo brothers in 2004, in order to collect funds in support of research to fight childhood illness. In June 2020, he and other chefs, as well as architects, Nobel laureates in Economics and leaders of international organizations, signed the appeal in favour of the purple economy (‚ÄúTowards a cultural renaissance of the economy‚Äù), published in the Corriere della Sera, El Pa√≠s and Le Monde.

As the country's first Vice President, Kamanga served for three years before Kenneth Kaunda changed him to serve in a different cabinet post. Thus, he was posted to Minister of Foreign Affairs in 1967, and then became Minister of Rural Development in 1969. He served in the Ministry of Agriculture as well. In 1983 Kamanga was appointed to the Central Committee in charge of Rural Development. RCK also served as Member of the Central Committee in charge of Legal & Political Affairs, before his retirement in 1990.  Retirement from politics and death  He retired from politics in 1991 before the political defeat of UNIP to the Movement for Multiparty Democracy (MMD). He left/retired with a few other colleagues who opted not to fight. Kamanga later died on 20 September at his Makeni home in 1996. In October 2014, the extended Kamanga family wrote a letter to the Zambian Government asking them to rename the Chipata District hospital after Ruben Kamanga, saying that he deserves to have something in his name for how influential he was during the fight for independence. Please note the sensational headline from the newspaper. Family did not and has never begged. Todate there have been more than five different requests from society with the latest by Mr. Ben Phiri in late 2019.

This article adopts the term \\"meet-irreducible\\" in order to distinguish between the several types being discussed. Meet-irreducible rings play an important part in commutative algebra, and directly irreducible and subdirectly irreducible rings play a role in the general theory of structure for rings. Subdirectly irreducible algebras have also found use in number theory. This article follows the convention that rings have multiplicative identity, but are not necessarily commutative. Definitions The terms \\"meet-reducible\\", \\"directly reducible\\" and \\"subdirectly reducible\\" are used when a ring is not meet-irreducible, or not directly irreducible, or not subdirectly irreducible, respectively. The following conditions are equivalent for a commutative ring R: * R is meet- irreducible; * the zero ideal in R is irreducible, i.e. the intersection of two non-zero ideals of A always is non-zero. The following conditions are equivalent for a commutative ring R: * R possesses exactly one minimal prime ideal (this prime ideal may be the zero ideal); * the spectrum of R is irreducible. The following conditions are equivalent for a ring R: * R is directly irreducible; * R has no central idempotents except for 0 and 1. The following conditions are equivalent for a ring R: * R is subdirectly irreducible; * when R is written as a subdirect product of rings, then one of the projections of R onto a ring in the subdirect product is an isomorphism; * The intersection of all nonzero ideals of R is nonzero. Examples and properties If R is subdirectly irreducible or meet-irreducible, then it is also directly irreducible, but the converses are not true. * All integral domains are meet-irreducible and subdirectly irreducible. In fact, a commutative ring is a domain if and only if it is both meet-irreducible and reduced. * The quotient ring Z/(4Z) is a ring which has all three senses of irreducibility, but it is not a domain. Its only proper ideal is (2Z)/(4Z), which is maximal, hence prime. The ideal is also minimal. * The direct product of two nonzero rings is never directly irreducible, and hence is never meet- irreducible or subdirectly irreducible. For example, in Z √ó Z the intersection of the non-zero ideals {0} √ó Z and Z √ó {0} is equal to the zero ideal {0} √ó {0}. * Commutative directly irreducible rings are connected rings; that is, their only idempotent elements are 0 and 1\\\\.

He was a charter member of the Louisiana Legislative Black Caucus, which was established in 1977.Louisiana Legislative Black Caucus history page. Background Born in Shreveport, young Jackson labored during summers picking cotton and baling hay on the farm of his maternal grandfather, Sam Beaner. He also worked at the family-owned Beaner's Grocery and the Phillips 66 service station on Line Avenue, operated by his father, Alphonse Jackson, Sr. (1907-1983). Upon his graduation from the historically black Central High School in Shreveport, he entered Southern University in Baton Rouge, another historically black institution, at which he was initiated into Alpha Phi Alpha fraternity. Drafted into the United States Army, he was among the military personnel deployed to Hiroshima and Nagasaki to engage in cleanup from the atomic bombs dropped in 1945. After his military service, Jackson returned to Southern University to obtain in 1951 his Bachelor of Arts in social studies. Thereafter, he attended New York University, from which he acquired in 1961 a Master of Arts degree in secondary education administration. Jackson began teaching in the early 1950s in the Caddo Parish schools and was soon named a principal, first at his alma mater, Central High School, and then at predominantly white Judson Elementary School. In 1960, Jackson was recognized as the Caddo Parish \\"Educator of the Year\\". In 1962, the Louisiana Education Association cited him for citizenship and civil rights leadership. He was active in the statewide teachers' organization and worked to merge the Louisiana Education Association with the former white Louisiana Teachers Association. He was a field representative for the National Education Association. Political career Jackson was appointed to the ten-member Biracial Committee to Desegregate Schools in Caddo Parish and was one of three who met with U.S. President Richard M. Nixon to determine ways to integrate Louisiana schools. Prior to and during his legislative service, Jackson worked in consort with black dentist Louis Pendleton and white school board leader Don W. Williamson of Shreveport to finalize desegregation plans. In 1972, as a freshman legislator, Jackson was elected as a delegate to the Louisiana Constitutional Convention of 1973. He was the chairman of the Committee on Bill of Rights and Elections. In 1973, Jackson was named Shreveport's \\"Man of the Year\\". Jackson worked with the Louisiana Education Association to investigate complaints filed by parents, teachers, and school personnel regarding violations of civil rights. For several years he directed legal defense efforts for professional educators in Louisiana and coordinated the Head Start program. He was a long-term member of the NAACP. In 1979, Jackson worked for the election of his fellow Democrat Louis Lambert, a Louisiana Public Service Commissioner from Baton Rouge, as governor in the general election against Republican David C. Treen. When Treen spoke before the legislature for the first time in April 1980, Representative Jackson was critical of what he called remarks \\"so vague and brief that he left me with far more questions than he answered.\\"Shreveport Journal, April 22, 1980, p. 1 As a legislator, Jackson opposed the Louisiana Balanced Treatment Act regarding the teaching of creation science and evolution in Louisiana public schools. The law was written by a Shreveport colleague, State Senator Bill P. Keith, also a Democrat. It was struck down in 1987 by the United States Supreme Court in the decision Edwards v. Aguillard. After he left the legislature, Jackson became the president of a public relations firm, Jackson, Nicholson and Associates, through which he coordinated political campaigns and planned marketing programs. Jackson's second wife, the former Glenda Hurst, is the daughter of Norbert Hurst of New Roads who was formerly married to the late James R. Archie, I. The couple married in 1993 and resided in Baton Rouge, where Jackson died in a hospice at the age of eighty-seven two days before Christmas 2014. There are two Jackson daughters from his first marriage to Rubye H. Jackson of Shreveport, Lydia Patrice Jackson and Angela Eileen Jackson. He acquired a stepdaughter, Andrea A. Archie of Atlanta, Georgia, from the second marriage. Lydia Jackson formerly represented District 39 in Caddo Parish in the Louisiana State Senate from 2004 to 2012, when she was unseated by her predecessor in the office, fellow African-American Democrat Gregory Tarver, a Shreveport businessman. Tarver had defeated Bill Keith for the same seat in 1983, when African Americans became the majority of voters in the district. In the elections of 2011, Tarver returned to reclaim the seat from Lydia Jackson. When he lived in Shreveport, Jackson was affiliated with the Zion Baptist Church. After services on December 27, 2014 at Shiloh Missionary Baptist Church in Baton Rouge, Jackson was interred at Southern Memorial Gardens at 301 Blount Road in Baton Rouge. Alphonse Jackson, Jr., is the eponym of the Alphonse Jackson Early Childhood Center in Shreveport.Alphonse Jackson School on Greatschools.net.The Shreveport Times in 2000 named Jackson as one of the one hundred most influential people of northwest Louisiana.

The symbol was adopted, for various reasons, by many sporting teams, clubs and societies in both America and Europe. Adoption by societies The skull and crossbones motif was used by many American college fraternities, sororities and secret societies founded in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. The most well- known example of this usage is the Skull and Bones society, a secret society at Yale University which derives its very name from the symbol. Other well- known college fraternal organizations which use the skull and bones in some capacity in their public symbols include, but are not limited to: Delta Sigma Pi, Kappa Sigma, Sigma Phi Epsilon, Phi Kappa Sigma, Tau Kappa Epsilon, Chi Psi and Zeta Beta Tau Fraternities and Sigma Sigma Sigma, Chi Omega, and Kappa Delta Sororities. Other fraternal groups also use the skull and crossbones in their symbolism or in their secret fraternal rituals. These groups include the Knights of Columbus, the Royal Black Institution, Apprentice Boys of Derry as well as the Knights Templar degree of Freemasonry. In fraternal usage, the skull and crossbones ‚Äì along with full skeletons and the skull alone ‚Äì are a very common motif due to their common association with death. The significance of these symbols varies from group to group. For some, they are a symbolic reminder of mortality. For others, the symbol has a religious reference (as with the Masonic Knights Templar, for which the skull and bones symbolize Golgotha, the place of Jesus' crucifixion). Another common fraternal use is one of warning wherein the skull and crossbones symbolize a dire warning against betraying the group's secrets and/or failing to keep one's oath. Adoption by sporting teams Barbarians team that faced Exeter, April 1891 In sports, the symbol was first adopted in the 1870s and was popular across many football sports in Great Britain and is still widely used by modern sports teams. The earliest teams to adopt the skull and crossbones were rugby union teams of the time. Although some coastal teams adopted an association with pirates in their team name, most teams used the symbol simply as a form of rebellion and its connotation with danger. The first Cardiff RFC team adopted a white skull and crossbones on the teams black strip in 1876, but this was changed the next season after pressure from the players' parents. The symbol was also used by the invitational touring rugby team the Barbarians, but this was dropped for the black and white hoops by the late 1890s. In Ireland the University College Cork, has used the skull and crossbones laid over the University badge for many of its sporting teams, most notably the College rugby team. Although there is dispute to the origin of the adoption of the badge, it is believed that the University's past connection as a medical school may have been the reason for its use.UCC Rugby :: Club History uccrugby.ie The University College even references the skull and crossbones in their College Victory Cry. The Skull and crossbones on a St Pauli supporters flag. Poole Pirates Speedway Team in the United Kingdom have the Skull and Crossbones as their team badge. The logo of the Blackshirts, the starting defensive unit for the Nebraska Cornhuskers football team, is a Skull and Crossbones with the skull wearing the team helmet. Additionally, the players and fans often celebrate by \\"throwing the bones\\", where they cross the forearms in the air, in a 'X', imitating the logo. FC St. Pauli supporters adopted the Skull and Crossbones as an unofficial symbol of the club. The athletic teams of East Carolina University, nicknamed Pirates, use a modified skull and crossbones flag as their symbol. (The skull wears a purple tricornered hat.)

Its area belongs to the comuni of Calangianus, Tempio Pausania, Berchidda and Oschiri, in the province of Olbia-Tempio. History left The name could derive from the Latin Limes Balares (\\"Boundary of the Balares\\"), given it by the Romans as it marked the frontier with the territory still in the hands of the Balares, a late Nuragic tribe. Mount Limbara was put to fire in 1936 and its woods made of cork oaks were replaced with pines, after a work of reforestation. After the World War II were planted forests of giant sequoias, too. On the top of the massif was located a NATO U.S. Air Force Communications Relay Station and a Carabinieri's barrack.

He is the Chair in Complexity Science, Full Professor at the Department of Mathematics and Statistics, and a member of the Institute of Complex Systems of the University of Strathclyde, Glasgow, United Kingdom. He is known by his contributions in different disciplines including chemistry, and the mathematics and physics of Complex Systems. Birth and education Estrada was born in the city of Sancti Spiritus, in the central region of Cuba. Since the age of 11 he studied in a school which specialized in exact sciences. He later studied for a technical degree as an analytical chemist in a technological institute in Havana. At the age of 28 he presented his first scientific paper in an international congress together with his mentor, Dr. Jose F. Fernandez-Bertran. The paper was about the detection of polyatomic anions in matrices of NaCl using infrared spectroscopy. Between 1985 and 1990, he studied chemical sciences at the Central University of Las Villas in Santa Clara, Cuba, where he obtained his degree in only 4 of the 5 years established for the program. In the first years after graduation, Estrada investigated the synthesis and spectroscopic characterization of new organic molecules with biological activity. This research introduced him to the world of computational chemistry due to the requirement of using efficient methods to design biologically active molecules. In 1997, he obtained his Ph.D in Chemistry under the direction of Prof. Luis A. Montero Cabrera on the topic of \\"Graph Theory Applied to Molecular Design\\". By this time, Estrada had published 8 scientific papers in major chemistry journals. Academic career After completing his Ph.D., Estrada spent some time as post-doctoral research at the University of Valencia, Spain working with Prof. Jorge Galvez and at the Lisa-Meitner Institute for Computational Quantum Chemistry, Hebrew University of Jerusalem with Prof. David Avnir. In 2000, he officially emigrated to Spain where he obtained a fellowship at the University of Santiago de Compostela. Between 2002 and 2003, Estrada worked as a scientist at the Safety and Environmental Assurance Centre, Unilever in Colworth, U.K. He then obtained a position as \\"Ramon y Cajal\\" researcher at the University of Santiago de Compostela, Spain. Since 2008, Estrada occupies the newly created Chair in Complexity Science at the University of Strathclyde and has published more than 160 papers, 10 book Chapters and 2 books. He is a Cuban and Spanish citizen, resident in Scotland, U.K. Research and achievements Estrada has been a major contributor in the area of study of complex network, where he has developed several approaches to investigate the structure and dynamics of such systems. An index introduced by him in 1999 to characterise the degree of folding of proteins, and then generalised to the study of complex networks in 2005, has eventually become the Estrada index of a graph or network, and it is the subject of intensive research in mathematics and other fields. Estrada is also known in the field of spectral graph theory where he has introduced several approaches to characterise the organizational architecture of complex networks, such as the \\"subgraph centrality\\", \\"communicability\\", \\"spectral scaling\\", \\"golden spectral graphs\\", etc. Estrada is also known in the area of Mathematical Chemistry, in particular to the development and use of molecular descriptors based on the use of Graph Theory. He is known for the introduction of several approaches in this field, such as the Topological Sub-Structural Molecular Design (TOPS-MODE) approach, and the generalization of topological indices. In 2007, Estrada received the prize as Outstanding Scientist from the International Academy of Mathematical Chemistry. The prize recognizes his valuable contributions in developing and applying graph theory to solve problems in many interdisciplinary areas, such as chemistry, physics, biology, ecology and technology.

History Kensington School was established in 1830 in union with the Corporation of King's College London for the purpose \\"of providing an efficient course of education for youth, comprising religious and moral instruction in conformity with the principles of the Established Church, the Greek, Latin and Modern languages anc literature, History, Geography, Mathematics and such other branches of knowledge and such accomplishments as it may be practicable and advantageous to introduce.\\" It was intended to create a first-grade institution in connection with the Church of England. The Vicar of Kensington was the President the Bishop of London was the Patron. The school opened on 24 January 1831 with twenty pupils. The proprietors had taken a house on a short tenure in Kensington Square, the intention being that if after a trial period of two years the school was a success they would either take a lease or go elsewhere. The school quickly established itself. The system of education to be adopted was prepared a few days before the school opened in 1831 by the Rev. T. S. Evans, the first headmaster. Approximately one third of the boys' time was to be devoted to the study of Latin and Greek, slightly more time to religious instruction, history, mathematics and arithmetic, and slightly less to French, geography and writing. The monitorial system of teaching was employed, whereby the masters taught only the monitors who in turn passed on the instruction they had received to their schoolfellows. By the time the school was about to take possession of the new schoolroom in January 1834, this system was abandoned in favour of the boys being divided into six separate classes. These classes were all held in the one large room, until 1837, when two new classrooms were added to the existing building. In 1838 the school acquired the next-door house at No. 26 and in 1845 another two classrooms were built on top of the original schoolroom. In 1834, dancing and drawing were introduced. The school had immediately established an annual award of an exhibition at the Universities of the value of ¬£50 a year for three years. Additionally it awarded an Indian cadetship, said to have formed the greatest attraction for pupils. In 1841 the school provided special courses to prepare boys for the East India Company's colleges at Haileybury and Addiscombe. As a result, Hindustani, military drawing, fortification, drill and fencing were all gradually introduced. A cadetship was created in 1842 by Sir Henry Willock, a Director of the East India Company, who was also one of the Directors of the School. The cadetship was an annual appointment to Addiscombe. This was to be \\"for the youth at Kensington School who may surpass his fellow students in merit and learning\\". The award lasted for nineteen years and not only attracted boys to the school but also directed school studies towards preparation for military life. In 1845, when the number of pupils had reached 130, of whom 85 were boarders, the directors decided to buy No. 28 Kensington Square and use it as a boarding house, in order to relieve pressure on the headmaster's own house. However, only a part of No. 28 was used in this way, the rest being let to the second master at ¬£70 per annum, while his former residence at No. 26 was added to the headmaster's house. In 1849, gas-lighting was installed in the lower rooms at Nos. 26 and 27 and later the school library was in No. 26. More classrooms were built in the back garden of No. 28 in 1853. By 1857, Kensington School held a high position, due to the success of its scholars at the Universities and more especially to the number of boys trained for the military services. It is said that the curriculum of Kensington School supplied a want which the public schools had not yet attempted to meet in that, prior to the mid- nineteenth century, the study of classics was supreme in the public schools, with mathematics, modern languages and science but only tolerated. Although this changed in the latter half of the century, Kensington were already satisfying the requirements of parents and giving also what the Universities and military examiners wanted. Records suggest that by 1857, despite the school's enhanced academic reputation, the headmaster of the time had allowed general discipline in the school to relax, so deeply immersed was he in the study of oriental literature. The indiscipline was not confined to pupils. The second master was allowed to keep as boarders private pupils who did not belong to the school. The formidable Haig Brown joined the school in 1857 instilling a sense of discipline once again and he remained at Kensington till 1863. His departure for Charterhouse was perhaps one of the causes which led eventually to the collapse of Kensington School. It is possible that, had he remained there, his powerful influence might have induced the Directors to oppose the Bill presented in Parliament by the Metropolitan Railway Company for powers to appropriate the playground, and they might thus have obtained sufficient compensation to enable them to remove the school elsewhere. The loss of the playground in 1865 was the chief cause of the final disbandment of the school. A much smaller playground was made in the back garden of No. 25, taken on lease in about 1864 and sub-let as a boarding house to one of the assistant masters. By 1869, there were only 45 pupils left, and the school had accumulated debts of over ¬£2,000. In July 1869, therefore, the proprietors voted to close it down and sold the school buildings to the Rev. Charles Tabor Ackland, one of the assistant masters. His intention to open an Endowed Grammar School did not take place until 1873. In the meantime Ackland assumed the headmastership and carried on the school on his own responsibility as the Kensington Foundation Grammar School, formally established under this name in July 1873. Under Ackland's headship the school flourished and within ten years of re-opening it had 130 pupils. In 1881, Ackland resigned and soon numbers began to fall off, particularly after the opening in 1884 of St. Paul's School in Hammersmith, only one-and-a-quarter miles from Kensington Square. In 1890 the headmaster tried to close the school but the trustees would not allow this, and it struggled on for a few more years until in 1896, When there were only ten or twelve pupils, it did finally close. The trustees, who by then had let all five houses fronting the square to private tenants, still hoped to use the back premises for educational work, and their scheme for the Kensington School of Science and Art received the approval of the Charity Commissioners in 1898 but was abandoned when the trustees found themselves unable to pay off the mortgage debt on the property. Sport The school was also famous for its athletic attainments and for the zeal with which all games, especially cricket and football, were pursued. It contributed more than one captain to the Cambridge and Oxford University elevens, and was the first school in England to institute a public \\"sports\\" day. The sports were known to fashionable London as the \\"Kensington Races.\\" At the time of the school's inception in 1830, football had yet to find a uniform code of play, and neither Association or Rugby football had yet been formalised. The style of football that had become increasingly popular since its inception at Rugby School was not adopted by the Proprietary School. They tended towards the dribbling game, represented to an extent by Eton's code and which would be set down formally in Cambridge rules in 1848. However, even the apparent acceptance of these rule sets for these two variations in the game did not avert controversy over the rules by which teams should play. With the exception of a rationalised and uniform football culture that was emerging in Sheffield in the 1850s, across the United Kingdom from club to club and school to school there was little agreement over the elements of a football game, be that the time it should take to play, the number of players in a side, or indeed whether running with the ball was illegal or not. Teams had to agree on rules before a match, or had to agree to play the code of each team for one half of the match each. In order to allow matches to take place without such constraints and problems, a number of captains and representatives from various London clubs met at Freemasons' Tavern in Lincoln's Inn Fields on 26 October 1863. Kensington School was one of the twelve teams represented, and thus became a founder member of the Football Association. Buildings The school was established at No. 31 Kensington Square in 1831Kensington Square and environs: Individual houses (west side and Derry Street), Survey of London: volume 42: Kensington Square to Earl's Court (1986), pp. 29-40.British History online The proprietors had taken that house on a short tenure and within a year of opening the number of pupils had doubled and the schoolroom had had to be enlarged. The proprietors nevertheless decided against taking a lease of No. 31, due to the potential ¬£600 ‚Äòsubstantial repairs‚Äô, and in June 1833 purchased the freehold of No. 27. This was an old house that had stood empty for some years and the proprietors planned to rebuild it. At the same time two-and-a-half acres of ground was leased behind the house, previously William Cobbett's nursery, for use as a playground. No. 27. had always been the largest house on the west side of the square and was the second to be erected on the site and dated from 1833‚Äì4, especially built for the school. The original house was built in the mid-1690s by the woodmonger John Kemp. Later occupants included the Marquis du Court 1700‚Äì1, ‚ÄòLady Illey‚Äô 1722, and Stephen Ashby (c. 1732‚Äì52), benefactor of St. Bartholomews Hospital, Christ's Hospital and Bethlehem Hospital. The rebuilding of No. 27 was carried out by George Todd of Chelsea in 1833‚Äì4 at a cost of some ¬£3,500, the architect was William Crake of Notting Hill, \\"a gentleman of professional eminence and skill\\", although William was a builder and it is likely his relation John was the architect. The new school was in two parts: a front building, on the site of the old house, known as School House, intended as the headmaster's residence, but it also contained other facilities such as a dining-room for the boys and bedrooms and a dormitory for boarders. A separate schoolroom was behind. The school was four storeys high with an austere brick fronth. Certain original elements were kept, such as the staircase above the ground floor. The walls were originally painted ‚Äòlight Tea-Green‚Äô, the skirting a shade darker and the cornices lighter: the colour of the ceiling was to be either ‚Äòa reflection of the wall‚Äô or cream ‚Äòas may be designed best to Harmonise the General Appearance of the Room, Observing that the prevailing color of the furniture is Red‚Äô. The boys' bedrooms were on the top floor. The first and second floors were evidently occupied by the headmaster, to whom the house was let for ¬£80 a year. The schoolroom was housed in a free-standing single-storey building at the back of the main house from which it was separated by a paved playground covered by a corrugated-iron roof, known as the ‚Äòtectum‚Äô. A passageway through the basement storey of No. 27 gave direct access to the playground and schoolroom from Kensington Square. West of the schoolroom was the large open playground. In 1838 the proprietors acquired the next-door house at No. 26, where two more classrooms were erected in the back garden. At the same time the ‚Äòtectum‚Äô was extended behind No. 26. with the house itself was leased to the school's second master for ¬£65 a year. In 1845 another two classrooms were built on top of the original schoolroom. In 1881, the year of Ackland's resignation, the trustees spent ¬£3,650 on building works at the school enlarging classrooms and building fives courts behind Nos. 28 and 29, and other various alterations. The alterations at the three houses were partly intended to prepare them for letting to private tenants as the school contracted. In 1898 the whole site was then offered for sale at auction but failed to attract a buyer, and in 1900 the trustees agreed to sell it to Derry and Toms for ¬£20,500 but this was superseded when the Crown, which had been negotiating to buy the free hold of various properties occupied by Derry and Toms, agreed to buy the freehold of the Grammar School site and let it to Derry's on a lease expiring in 1949. Although Nos. 28 and 29 Kensington Square continued to be occupied by private tenants, the other three houses in the square were used to provide accommodation for Derry and Toms' staff, and the back premises were converted for use as workshops. The only survival from the days of the school is the ‚Äòcottage‚Äô behind No. 28, known as 27a, which is the ‚Äònew building‚Äô of 1846. Headmasters *Rev. T. S.

In 2011 it had a population of 1,552.  Etymology  Leipalingis is located in the ancient lands of Baltic tribe Yotvingians, so the name contains Yotwingian form of word liepa - leipa (linden). History Martynas Knakfusas 1.5 km south of Leipalingis is ƒåerniauskas mound, 2 km southwest - Druskininkiai mound. In the western part of Leipalingis, to the west of Seira river right bank is archeological Leipalingis cemetery. Therefore, the area, which was destroyed by crusaders before the second half of the 13th century, could have a defensive meaning. The Leipalingis Manor is first mentioned in 1503, the town itself, later known for some time as Lepunikai - in 1516. From the sixteenth century Leipalingis belonged to orthodox Sapieha family, who in 1520 built an orthodox church. Later they became Catholics and built the first catholic church. After Sapiehas, Leipalingis belonged to Masalskiai and from the end of the 18th century - to Plateriai families. During 1654-1667 war the town was burned down. In 1818-1950 it became a district of the municipality. Next to the Leipalingis Manor operated an iron foundry. At the end of the 19th century, Leipalingis became an important junction between the roads connecting Seinai with Seirijai and Merkinƒó. Around 1817 a parish school was established, and in 1906 a library. On 9 September 1941, on the orders of the Nazi occupation authorities, 155 people belonging to a local Jewish community were executed. The town suffered greatly during the Second World War.

Biography  Born of Algerian immigrant parents, Sihem Habchi followed a course of study in secondary school and university that primarily involved linguistics and multimedia. She obtained a specialized degree in the field of multimedia at the Pierre-et- Marie-Curie University in Paris, in 2001. After having taught French abroad to an audience predominately made up of women undergoing rehabilitation, she launched into multimedia production and oriented her research toward educational methods and multimedia directed at children.  Political activism and Ni Putes Ni Soumises  In March 2003, like thousands of French women and men, she joined the women‚Äôs March for equality and against the ghetto. For five weeks, through 23 cities, and under the deliberately provocative slogan ‚ÄúNeither Whores nor Submissives,‚Äù five women and two men called for public attention and action regarding the condition of girls in poor neighbourhoods. The March commenced symbolically in Vitry-sur-Seine where the young Sohanne, victim of misogynism, was burned alive in a dumpster in a Balzac city neighbourhood. This first march obtained its objective: to break the silence, as evident of the more than 30,000 people who turned out to march behind the ‚ÄúNi Putes Ni Soumises‚Äù banner, until the annual International Women's Day, 8 March 2003. Sihem Habchi told her story and that of the myriad women with whom she had grown up. All, like her, had known constant discrimination which victimized young boys and girls. It was for these many reasons, as well as due to a great desire to set off change in society, that Sihem Habchi joined Fadela Amara and her team in April 2003. She was one of 14 ‚ÄúMariannes of Today‚Äù, displayed on the face of the National Assembly from 12 July to 31 August 2003. This exposition was highly symbolic in terms of identification with republican values. The natural and frank portraits of young ‚Äúblack, white, and North African‚Äù women paid homage to Marianne, the rebellious French heroine devoted to equality and fraternity. = Directorship of Ni Putes Ni Soumises = Sihem Habchi offered her talents to the creation of the Guide to Respect, sold today to 100,000 copies throughout France (a European version is currently under way), as the march allowed for the collection of thousands of stories of girls and boys in pain. In September 2003, Sihem Habchi took the position of vice-president of the Ni Putes Ni Soumises movement. She was responsible for the Multimedia Department, for networking and international relations. In February and March 2004, during the national debate over secularism, she participated in the ‚ÄúTour de France Republicain‚Äù to move the focus of the debate beyond the spheres of politics, media, and academia. She led over 100 public meetings before audiences of close to 1,000 persons, often at risk to verbal and physical threats. In October 2004, the Ni Putes Ni Soumises movement received women from all over the world (Saudi Arabia, Germany, the Netherlands, the United States, Morocco, Algeria‚Ä¶) who came to argue for the necessity of solidarity at the hour of growing religious fundamentalism and patriarchal regimes looking to suppress the emancipation of women. Her role as vice-president, charged with dealing with international relations, allowed for the creation of NPNS committees in Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and Belgium. During her participation in numerous international conferences she stressed the dangers of religious shifts, cultural relativism and communitarianism. On International Women‚Äôs Day, 8 March 2005, NPNS collaborated with a number of grassroots associations and personalities to launch a call ‚ÄúFor a new feminism‚Äù which emphasized the necessity to promote equality, secularism (la laicit√©) and diversity to ensure the emancipation of all individuals. This collective also denounced communitarianism linked with any sort of particular cultural belief which, in the name of the ‚Äúrelative‚Äù liberty of choice, led to subjection and imprisonment. In 2006, Sihem Habchi participated in the development of the House of ‚ÄúMixit√©‚Äù (diversity), inaugurated 8 March 2006, in the presence of ex-French President Jacques Chirac. In 2007, thanks to her actions in New York as vice-president of Ni Putes Ni Soumises, the movement was granted consultative status to the United Nations, which made it a privileged representative on the international scene. = President of the movement = On 23 June 2007, Habchi was elected president of the movement by the National Council of Ni Putes Ni Soumises. She replaced Fadela Amara, who was nominated to the Secretary of State under the Minister Fillon II administration. Sihem Habchi left soon after for Pakistan to support the ex-minister Nilofar Bakhtiar, who had been threatened with a fatwa. Since 2007, Sihem Habchi has not ceased to defend women victims of obscurantism throughout the world: she has met with Ayaan Hirsi Ali, Naeema Moghul, Nawal Saadawi, Taslima Nasrin, and many others. On 24 November 2008, Habchi addressed a letter to Nicolas Sarkozy, current French president, to demand he commit to the national cause to end violence against women. To solidify this demand, Ni Putes Ni Soumises initiated a collective of associations. In October 2011, 8 out of the 9 employees of Ni Putes Ni Soumises went on strike to protest against what they called Sihem's Habchi \\"tyrannical\\" and \\"despotic\\" behaviour; they also accused her of using the movement's money for her personal use.Scandale √† Ni Putes Ni Soumises ?, Le Nouvel Observateur, 21 October 2011.

His second wife (name unknown) had at least three sons that changed the spelling of the last name from Kr√∂ger to Kreuger but with the same pronunciation (eu like in the French word fleur): *Peter Kreuger became a clerk in the Swedish Navy in Karlskrona. *Sven Kreuger continued his fathers business with the bakery in Kalmar. *Anders Kreuger (1720‚Äì1778), started a workshop in Kalmar in 1746 and worked also in the real estate business. He married Maria Bodecker.  Anders Kreuger (1720-1778)  Anders Kreuger och Maria Bodecker had several children, and at least two sons: *Johan Fredrik Kre√ºger (1753‚Äì1823) worked within the customs administration and moved from Kalmar to Porvoo in Finland. *Peter Kreuger (1758‚Äì1807), married Ulrika √Öbrandt.

In the first marriage he got a son, the Navy officer Johan Henrik Kre√ºger (1782‚Äì1858) that in the end of his career, 1857 was appointed admiral for the Swedish Navy. He was also known for diplomatic skills, particular in negotiations with foreign states regarding reducing customs charges for Swedish goods. He was also an inventor of marine related equipment. At the world exhibition in London (1851) and in Paris (1855) he was awarded for his new anemometer (measuring wind speed), that eventually was used for more than 30 years along the Swedish coast. His anemometer did not work with the principle of transferring a rotating shaft to a wind scale but a static wind force to a scale that proved to be very reliable and accurate.Kreuger's anemometer.

The letter has not been published. Around 1911‚Äì1912 Ernst and his brother Fredrik Kreuger encountered financial problems with their companies in Kalmar. This was the time when Ernst son Ivar Kreuger entered the match business. Ivar was advised by his banker Oscar Rydbeck to turn the factories into a stock corporation in order to raise more capital. This was the starting point for the reformation of the entire Swedish match manufacturing industry as well as the largest match companies in Norway and Finland and finally in 1917 Ivar Kreuger founded the Swedish Match by merging with the largest match company at time in Scandinavia, J√∂nk√∂ping match industry, that had been established in many countries all around the world for many years. This new group then covered the entire Scandinavian match industry and the road laid open for the worldwide expansion.

A Spanish expeditionary force under Mat√≠as de G√°lvez, the Captain General of Spanish Guatemala, gained control of the British-held island after bombarding its main defences. The British garrison surrendered the next day. The Spanish evacuated the captured soldiers, 135 civilians and 300 slaves, and destroyed their settlement, which they claimed had been used as a base for piracy and privateering. The assault was part of a larger plan by G√°lvez to eliminate British influence in Central America. Although he met with temporary successes, the British were able to maintain a colonial presence in the area. Background Following the entry of Spain into the American War of Independence in 1779, both Spain and Great Britain contested territories in Central America. Although most of the territory was part of the Spanish Captaincy General of Guatemala, the British had established logging rights on the southern coast of the Yucatan Peninsula (present-day Belize), and had established informal settlements (lacking formal colonial authority) on the Mosquito Coast of present-day Honduras and Nicaragua. Guatemalan Governor Mat√≠as de G√°lvez had moved quickly when the declaration of war arrived, seizing St. George's Caye, one of the principal British island settlements off the Yucatan coast.Ch√°vez, p. 152 Many of the British fled that occupation to the island of Roat√°n, another British-controlled island about off the Honduran coast.Bolland, p. 31 British commander Edward Marcus Despard used Roat√°n as a base for guerilla-style operations to extend and maintain British influence on the Mosquito Coast, and for privateering operations against Spanish shipping.Oman, p. 5 (Sources do not indicate whether Despard was present on Roat√°n at the time of the Spanish attack; if he was, he was probably not captured, since he continued to be active in the area. Stephens suggests that he was on Jamaica at the time.)Oman, p. 6 Map of the Bay of Honduras; Roat√°n is shown in red G√°lvez, who had been ordered by King Charles to \\"dislocate the English from their hidden settlements on the Gulf of Honduras\\",Ch√°vez, p. 151 began planning offensive operations against the British mainland settlements as early as 1780, after the British abandoned their failed expedition into Nicaragua. He raised as many as 15,000 militia, and received financial and logistical support from many parts of the Spanish colonial empire in the Americas. For logistical and diplomatic reasons, no operations were launched until after the American victory at Yorktown in October 1781. The British loss opened the possibility that the British would be able to deploy troops to Central America to better defend the area.Floyd, pp. 154‚Äì155 G√°lvez' plans called for assaults on the British presence in the Bay Islands (principally Roat√°n), followed by a sweep along the coast to eliminate the British from the mainland. Troops from central Guatemala were staged in early 1782 at Trujillo for the assault on Roat√°n, while additional forces moved overland from Nicaragua, Honduras, and Salvador toward the principal British settlement of Black River.Floyd, p. 155 G√°lvez arrived at Trujillo on March 8 to organise the assault on Roat√°n. Leaving a force of 600 at Trujillo to further harass the British and their partisan allies, he embarked another 600 troops onto transports, and sailed for Roat√°n on March 12, escorted by three frigates (Santa Matilde, the Santa Cecilia, and the Antiope) and a number of smaller armed naval vessels,Ch√°vez, pp. 162‚Äì163 under the command of Commodore Enrique Macdonell.Marley, p. 342 The British residents of Roat√°n were aware of the ongoing Spanish military activities. The main settlement, New Port Royal, was defended by Forts Dalling and Despard, which mounted 20 guns. The island's white non-slave population was however quite small. In 1781 they appealed to the British commander at Bluefields for support, but he was only able to send additional weapons, which did not add significantly to the island's defenses.Floyd, p. 157 Battle Guatemalan Governor Mat√≠as de G√°lvez Enrique MacDonell The Spanish fleet arrived off Roat√°n at 6 am on March 13, and after its defenders fired several ineffectual cannon shots, the Santa Maltilda and the other ships anchored out of range. At 8 am G√°lvez sent his second-in- command on the 'Santa Matilda' Enrique MacDonell, who spoke English, in to request the surrender of the island's defenders. The defenders asked for six hours to consider their options, which G√°lvez granted. After that time had elapsed MacDonell came back with word that the defenders refused to surrender and were prepared to stand their ground 'to the death'. The Spanish were not surprised as their sailors had noticed the English appeared to be preparing defenses during grace period. An Immediate attack was not possible due to high winds and rough seas, so G√°lvez then held council of his eleven officers, and a plan of attack was formulated.Ch√°vez, p. 163 At about 10:15 am on March 16, Spanish guns opened up against Forts Dalling and Despard, which guarded the mouth of New Port Royal's harbour. By 1:00 pm the British guns there had been silenced, and Major General Gabriel Herbias began landing troops. After the two forts were secured, the Spanish warships entered the harbour and began raking the town with cannon fire, while British artillery fired back from positions in the hills above the town. This exchange continued until sunset, at which point the British defenders capitulated. The Spanish had two killed and four wounded in the battle, while only two slaves were wounded on the other side. Aftermath Terms of surrender were agreed the next day. G√°lvez and his men remained on the island for several days, collecting weapons, rounding up slaves that had run away, destroying all the buildings and agriculture on the island, as well as burning many of the ships in the harbour, which they assumed to be used in smuggling and other illicit trade. The Spanish left the island on March 23, carrying as prisoners of war 81 British soldiers, 300 slaves, and 135 British civilians.Ch√°vez, p. 164 The prisoners were sent to Havana, where the slaves were auctioned off and the others held until they could be exchanged. G√°lvez was able to only temporarily partially eliminate British influences in the area. He followed up his success at Roat√°n with the capture of Black River in early April, but any attempt to advance further bogged down. James Lawrie, the commander at Black River, and Edward Marcus Despard successfully recaptured Black River, and were able to hold it until the end of the war.Ch√°vez, p. 165 References   Further reading *A Spanish account of the battle Category:Conflicts in 1782 Roatan Roatan Roatan Category:History of Honduras Battle Roatan ","title":"Battle of Roat√°n"},{"id":"23169750","text":"OhridVillage of Ohrid at Guide-Bulgaria.com (, also transliterated as Okhrid) is a village (—Å–µ–ª–æ) in northwestern Bulgaria, located in the Boychinovtsi municipality () of the Montana Province ().

Due to the frequent raids and pillaging of Teutonic Order, Yotvingians abandoned the lands and Seirijai became a wilderness. From 1383 to 1398 Seirijai was in the State of the Teutonic Order. After the defeat of Teutonic Order in the Battle of Grunwald and the Treaty of Melno (1422), the land became populated again and started to grow economically. Since 16th century Serijai were known as a proprietary land of a ruler. King of Poland and Grand Duke of Lithuania Sigismund I the Old donated Seirijai to Jurgis Radvila, and later it became a possession of Radvila family. Jurgis Radvila built a Catholic church in 1537. Already in 1564 the church was given to Calvinists, since many in Radvila family converted to Calvinism. The tensions between Catholics and Calvinists lasted up to 1655 the Thirteen Years' War with Russia. Seirijai town was devastated and Calvinists retreated. During the World War II almost all Seirijai was bombed by German army.

Legal education in India is offered at different levels by the traditional universities and the specialised law universities and schools only after completion of an undergraduate degree or as an integrated degree. Legal Education in India is regulated by the Bar Council of India, a statutory body established under the section 4 of advocates Act 1961. Any institution departing legal education in India must be approved by the Bar Council of India.  History  During the shift from Mughal legal system, the advocates under that regimen, ‚Äúvakils‚Äù, too followed suit, though they mostly continued their earlier role as client representatives. The doors of the newly created Supreme Courts were barred to Indian practitioners as right of audience was limited to members of English, Irish and Scottish professional bodies. Subsequent rules and statutes culminating in the Legal Practitioners Act of 1846 which opened up the profession regardless of nationality or religion. In India, legal education has been traditionally offered as a three years graduate degree. However the structure has been changed since 1987. Law degrees in India are granted and conferred in terms of the Advocates Act, 1961, which is a law passed by the Parliament both on the aspect of legal education and also regulation of conduct of legal profession. Under the Act, the Bar Council of India is the supreme regulatory body to regulate the legal profession in India and also to ensure the compliance of the laws and maintenance of professional standards by the legal profession in the country. To this regard, the Bar Council of India prescribes the minimum curriculum required to be taught in order for an institution to be eligible for the grant of a law degree. The Bar Council also carries on a period supervision of the institutions conferring the degree and evaluates their teaching methodology and curriculum and having determined that the institution meets the required standards, recognizes the institution and the degree conferred by it. Traditionally the degrees that were conferred carried the title of LL.B. (Bachelor of Laws) or B.L. (Bachelor of Law). The eligibility requirement for these degrees was that the applicant already have a Bachelor's degree in any subject from a recognized institution. Thereafter the LL.B. / B.L. course was for three years, upon the successful completion of which the applicant was granted either degree. However upon the suggestion by the Law Commission of India and also given the prevailing cry for reform the Bar Council of India instituted upon an experiment in terms of establishing specialized law universities solely devoted to legal education and thus to raise the academic standards of legal profession in India. This decision was taken somewhere in 1985 and thereafter the first law University in India was set up in Bangalore which was named as the National Law School of India University (popularly 'NLS'). These law universities were meant to offer a multi-disciplinary and integrated approach to legal education. It was therefore for the first time that a law degree other than LL.B. or B.L. was granted in India. NLS offered a five years law course upon the successful completion of which an integrated degree with the title of \\"B.A.,LL.B. (Honours)\\" would be granted. Thereafter other law universities were set up, all offering five years integrated law degree with different nomenclature. The next in line was National Law Institute University set up in Bhopal in 1997. It was followed by NALSAR university of law set up in 1998. The National Law University, Jodhpur offered for the first time in 2001 the integrated law degree of \\"B.B.A, LL.B. (Honours)\\" which was preceded by the West Bengal National University of Juridical Sciences offering the \\"B.Sc., LL.B. (Honours)\\" degree. KIIT Law School, Bhubaneswar became the first law school in India in 2007 to start integrated law in three different streams and honours specialisation; i.e. BA/BBA/B.Sc. LLB (Honours). However, despite these specialized law universities, the traditional three year degree continues to be offered in India by other institutions and are equally recognized as eligible qualifications for practicing law in India. Another essential difference that remains is that while the eligibility qualification for the three year law degree is that the applicant must already be a holder of a Bachelor's degree, for being eligible for the five years integrated law degree, the applicant must have successfully completed Class XII from a recognized Boards of Education in India. Both the holders of the three year degree and of the five year integrated degree are eligible for enrollment with the Bar Council of India upon the fulfillment of eligibility conditions and upon enrollment, may appear before any court in India. The University Grants Commission approved one-year LLM courses in India on 6 September 2012 and the guideline for the same was notified in January, 2013.‚ÄúWe have an immense problem with the faculty, especially with more than 900 plus law schools all over the country, we suffer for want of faculty. The curriculum needs to be regulated and we will have to gradually upscale and upgrade,‚Äù confessed erstwhile law minister, Veerappa Moily.  Academic degrees  In India, a student can pursue a legal course only after completing an undergraduate course in any discipline. However, following the national law school model, one can study law as an integrated course of five years after passing the senior secondary examination. *Bachelor of Laws (LL.B.) - The LL.B. is the most common law degree offered and conferred by Indian universities which has a duration of three years. Almost all law universities follow a standard LL.B. curriculum, wherein students are exposed to the required bar subjects. * Integrated undergraduate degrees - B.A. LL.B., B.Sc. LL.B., BBA. LLB., B.Com. LL.B. These degrees are mostly offered in the autonomous law schools having a duration of five years. *Master of Laws (LL.M.) - The LL.M. is most common postgraduate law degree which has a duration of one/two years. *Master of Business Law *Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) *Integrated MBL-LLM/ MBA-LLM. -Generally a three years double degree integrated course with specialisation in business law.  Admission  As of 2012, admission to LLB and LLM in most of the autonomous law schools in India is based on performance in Common Law Admission Test (CLAT). However, the National Law University, Delhi and the private autonomous law schools conduct their own admission tests. The other entrance exams available for admission to law courses in India include AILET, LSAT, BVP CET and IPU, AUAT and AMU Law entrance exams among others. In most of the traditional universities, the admission is done on the basis of an admission test to the constituent law college or a common admission test for its affiliated colleges. Some traditional universities and affiliated colleges also admits students on the basis of merit in the preceding examination.

The origin of this dance is a matter of dispute between Peru and Bolivia, because both nations celebrate the Diablada with similar music, songs, and clothing. The Diablada pune√±a is part of an Andean theatrical repertoire that began during the Spanish colonization of South America in order to teach the local natives the precepts of Christian faith and history of the Spanish Empire. The Diablada causes a reform in the thinking of the indigenous altiplano cultures as missionaries from Spain, instilled the paradigm of good and evil, which is how the costumes of angels and demons became associated with the dance. According to Diego Gonz√°les Holgu√≠n, the missionaries taught the natives a representation of the seven deadly sins and the triumph of the angels over the demons. In Puno, this is a special dance which was recovered from the past along with the Diablada in Oruro. History In 1577, the Jesuits settled in Juli, Puno. During festivities, they performed theatre plays, comedies and actos sacramentales. The Juli Jesuits taught the natives a song-dance about the seven capital sins and how the angels beat the demons, in order to indoctrinate the locals.

It was the first facility of its kind in the world, and was a precursor of the Odeillo Solar Furnace. It provides a thermal power of 50 kW.  History  The French chemist F√©lix Trombe and his team made an initial demonstration of a mirror of DCA in Meudon in 1946 to show the possibility of reaching high temperatures very quickly using highly concentrated sunlight. The goal was to melt ore and extract very pure substances to make new and more effective refractory materials. In order to do further experiments, the first solar furnace was built in Mont-Louis in the Pyr√©n√©es-Orientales in 1949.  Development and cooperation  The Mont-Louis Solar Furnace is engaged in a process of technology transfer to the countries of the south; the city of Safi in Morocco is participating in this process. The aim is to install in villages, solar ovens that will cook pots, plates for eating bread, building materials, and melt any metal to make pots or tools.  Education  The centre gives demonstrations of its work. A guide takes visitors to the heart of the facility to explain the operation and use of the solar furnace. Applications of simple scientific and educational experiments complement the visit, for example: the concentration of the solar rays to produce temperatures between 2000 ¬∞C and 3500 ¬∞C, the ignition of wood, melting of metal, and ceramic cooking. The visit concludes with an overview of technologies that use solar energy: solar thermal, solar forge, solar cells, solar cookers.http://www.capcir-pyrenees.com/articles.asp?id=5506  See also  *Odeillo References External links * Mont-Louis Solar Furnace * History of the Solar Furnace (in French) * Cooperation with Morocco Category:Energy infrastructure completed in 1949 Category:Buildings and structures in Pyr√©n√©es-Orientales Category:Energy development Category:Solar power stations in France Category:Tourist attractions in Pyr√©n√©es-Orientales Category:Monuments historiques of Pyr√©n√©es-Orientales ","title":"Mont-Louis Solar Furnace"},{"id":"23170000","text":"Thomas, 1st Baron Southwell of Castle Mattress (Balthasar Denner) Thomas Southwell, 1st Baron Southwell PC (Ire) (1665 ‚Äì 4 August 1720), known as Sir Thomas Southwell, 2nd Baronet from 1681 to 1717, was an Irish peer and politician.

The book is credited with popularizing the political culture sub-field and is considered to be the first systematic study in this field. Synopsis In the text Almond and Verba examine the democratic systems in five countries, the United States, Germany, Mexico, Italy, and the United Kingdom. They interviewed about a thousand individuals in each country on their views of government and political life. As they define it, the \\"civic culture\\" (singular) is \\"based on communication and persuasion, a culture of consensus and diversity, a culture that [permits] change but [moderates] it\\" (Almond and Verba 1963, 8). They identify three political structures: participant, subject, and parochial. They consider political culture to be the element that connects individual attitudes with the overall political system structure. Almond and Verba considered the Italian emphasis on the family as the driving main force for society as \\"amoral\\" (in the words of Edward Banfield (The Moral Basis of a Backward Society, 1958), or \\"exclusive\\", and believed that such a culture would impede the culture's potential for developing a \\"sense of community and civic culture,\\" which they saw as a necessary background for \\"effective democracy\\". Reception and criticisms Seymour Lipset wrote in The Democratic Century that Almond and Verba \\"did argue persuasively that the extent of civic culture could be predicted by structural and historical factors\\" but that there was also \\"strong evidence that some aspects of the civic culture were powerfully associated with education levels, across national borders\\". The Civic Culture was criticized for having an \\"Anglo- American bias\\", with the authors stating that only the United Kingdom and the United States possessed the capability for long term democratic stabilization. Critics also expressed skepticism over the accuracy of depicting a culture based upon individual interviews and that the approach was \\"ethnocentric and more prescriptive than objective and empirical\\".

Before monks of the Order of Saint Basil the Great arrived to the town in 1749, it was known as Padubysys (literally: near Dubysa). The Basilian Fathers established a parish school in 1773. After 20 years, the school had 192 students and was reorganized into six-year school. The monastery and school was closed by the Tsarist authorities after the failed uprising in 1830. The town church was transformed into an Eastern Orthodox one. After Lithuania regained independence in 1919, the church was reformed back to a Catholic one. Before World War II, the Jewish community of the village had 130 members. All of them were murdered in a mass execution perpetrated by an einsatzgruppen of Germans and Lithuanian nationalists in 1941.http://www.yahadmap.org/#village/bazilionai-scaron- iauliai- lithuania.683http://www.yadvashem.org/yv/he/research/ghettos_encyclopedia/ghetto_details.asp?cid=127 References External links * Website of Bazilionai community Category:Towns in Lithuania Category:Towns in ≈†iauliai County Category:Shavelsky Uyezd Category:Holocaust locations in Lithuania ","title":"Bazilionai"},{"id":"23170156","text":"Wendlebury is a village and civil parish about southwest of Bicester and about from Junction 9 of the M40. A stream flows through the centre of the village, parallel with the main street. The 2011 Census recorded the parish's population as 421. The toponym is derived from Old English, meaning the burh of a Saxon named W√¶ndel. Manor Before the Norman conquest of England in the 11th century one Asgar held the manor. After the Conquest, William the Conqueror granted Wendlebury to Geoffrey de Mandeville. The manor remained with his heirs, including his grandson of the same name whom King Stephen made 1st Earl of Essex in about 1140. The de Mandeville lineage became extinct upon the death of William FitzGeoffrey de Mandeville, 3rd Earl of Essex, in 1227, and its manors including Wendlebury passed to Humphrey de Bohun, 2nd Earl of Hereford, in 1236. Henry III made Humphrey Earl of Essex in 1239. Wendlebury remained with the Earls of Hereford and Essex until the death of Humphrey de Bohun, 7th Earl of Hereford, in 1373. The manor of Wendlebury then consisted of two knight's fees. After the 7th Earl's death the manor was divided, with one fee passing to the Earl's elder daughter Eleanor de Bohun, wife of Thomas of Woodstock, 1st Duke of Gloucester. There is no known record to indicate whether the other fee passed to Eleanor's younger sister Mary de Bohun, wife of Henry Bolingbroke. Eleanor's half of Wendlebury seems to have passed to Thomas and Eleanor's daughter Anne of Gloucester, for in 1403 it belonged to Anne's second husband Edmund Stafford, 5th Earl of Stafford. There is no known record of the overlordship of Wendlebury after 1403, so it seems to have lapsed. At the time of the Hundred Rolls in 1279, Thame Abbey held five virgates of land at Wendlebury. The abbey seems to have disposed of this land before 1317, as an inventory of its estates at that time makes no mention of Wendlebury. Rewley Abbey was founded in 1281 and by 1293 held at Wendlebury eight virgates of arable land plus of meadow. Rewley retained this minor estate until the Dissolution of the Monasteries in the 16th centuries, when it passed to Thomas Pope of Wroxton Abbey. The present manor house was built in the 17th century and remodelled in the 18th century. Parish church St, Giles' nave and north transept, seen from the northwest The earliest known record of the Church of England parish church of Saint Giles is from early in the 13th century. It was cruciform until 1639, when the south transept was found to be so unsafe that it was demolished. In 1757 the remainder of the building was found unsafe and in March 1761 everything but the belltower was demolished. By September that year a new nave, chancel and two transepts had been completed, incorporating from the old church general building materials, early Decorated Gothic windows from about 1300 and a Perpendicular Gothic doorway. The foundations continued to give trouble and in 1901‚Äì02 the medieval tower and 18th-century south transept were demolished. At the same time the architect John Oldrid Scott restored the remainder of the building, renewing the roof and installing new seating. The tower had three bells: two cast in the 16th century and the third in 1695. Since the demolition of the tower these have stood in the west end of the nave. The west gable of the nave now has a bell-cot with one bell. St Giles' is now part of the Benefice of Akeman, along with the parishes of Bletchingdon, Chesterton, Hampton Gay, Kirtlington, Middleton Stoney and Weston-on-the-Green. The Old Rectory was built in 1840, replacing an earlier house that had existed by 1634. Social and economic history The Red Lion public house Wendlebury has one public house, the Red Lion. It was built in the 17th century and seems to have been trading as an inn by 1732. In 1790 a farmer from Merton started a brewery in the village but the business failed and in 1809 was put up for sale. A Bicester brewer bought it in 1820. An open field system of farming continued in the parish until 1801, when its common lands were enclosed by Act of Parliament. of land were enclosed, of which were awarded to the lord of the manor, Thomas Coker. Rev. George Dupuis, who was rector from 1789‚Äì1839, farmed Wendlebury's of glebe himself. When Wendlebury was enclosed the tithes were commuted for of land. This gave Dupuis more space in which to exercise improved farming techniques, including a seven-year crop rotation. A National School was opened in 1850 and new school buildings for it were completed in 1863. In 1927 it was reorganised as a junior school, with pupils of secondary school age thereafter going to Bicester. It became a controlled school in 1952. The Oxford to Bletchley railway, completed in 1851 as part of the Buckinghamshire Railway, passes through the parish. The London and North Western Railway took over the Buckinghamshire Railway in 1879 and opened southeast of the village in 1905. The Railways Act 1921 made the LNWR part of the new London, Midland and Scottish Railway, which closed Wendlebury Halt in 1926. A new line between Oxford, Bicester Village and London Marylebone has been opened and offers an excellent service. The line's nearest station to Wendlebury is now Bicester Village, away.

British computer scientist, Junade Ali, defined the Database-as-IPC Anti-Pattern as using a database to \\"schedule jobs or queue up tasks to be completed\\", noting that this anti-pattern centres around using a database for temporary messages instead of persistent data. Controversy The issue arises if there is a performance issue, and if additional systems (and servers) can be justified. In terms of performance, recent advancements in database systems provide more efficient mechanisms for signaling and messaging, and database systems also support memory (non-persisted) tables.

The book was published in 2007 by Amulet Books. It follows the story of Fell, a wolf who left his pack after the events of The Sight. Plot summary The book starts with a pack of grey wolves walking through the snowy regions of Transylvania. One of the pups looks up at a hill and can see an outline of a black wolf. She tells her father, the Dragga, that it might be Fell, the ghost wolf that humans and Varg fear. Because, while Larka has become respected and loved among the Varg for the part she played in the death of Morgra, Fell became feared among them, and that he is a loner, which is unnatural to other Varg. Lost in his grief and guilt over the death of his sister, Larka, Fell rejects the gift of the Sight, and becomes a Kerl, which is the wolf name for a loner. The pack keeps the thoughts of curses out of their heads, and Fell watches them leave. He then goes to a pool and looks into it. His dead sister, Larka, appears to him, and she shows him a picture of a girl with a tattoo in the shape of an eagle on her arm. Larka then tells Fell to find and protect the girl. The girl who Fell saw is Alina Sculcavant, who is growing up in the care of Malduk, a shepherd whom rescued her from the snows. He forces her to dress as a boy and work hard for him. The other villagers believe Alina to be a changeling, and fear her for it. One day Alina finds a parchment that holds the true secret of her past, but Malduk and his wife, Ranna, who have tried to hide it from her for years, find out. They murder a villager and frame Alina, so that she is forced to flee into the mountains to discover who she truly is. Later Alina and Fell get trapped inside an ice cavern. While they are there, they discover that they can mentally communicate using the Sight, and Fell eventually decides to accompany Alina on her journey due to his vision of Larka. On their journey, Alina goes to find a man mentioned to her by Ivan, who was one of her few friends in Moldov. She eventually finds the man,a blacksmith named Lescu. Alina stays with Lescu and his son, Catalin, for a time, during which Lescu teaches Alina to use a sword and Fell spends some time out in the forest, where he meets his adopted brother, Kar, and a she- wolf named Tarlar. Later soldiers attack the house, killing Lescu. Catalin is forced to travel with Alina and Fell. Alina finds out that she has a real family and that the Lady Romana is her real mother and the supposedly dead Lord Dragomir is her real father. However, Alina doesn't know that her father was murdered secretly by his best friend, Vladeran. Vladeran then had Alina taken away to be killed because she was the true heir to the throne, but Alina and her soldier escort befell an accident. The soldier was killed but Alina survived, and that was when Malduk found her. Meanwhile, Vladeran took over as Lord of Castelu and married Dragomir's wife, the Lady Romana. Vladeran and Romana now have a seven-year-old son, Elu.  Characters in Fell  This is a list of characters in the novel.  Humans  Alina, or \\"Alin\\"‚Äîher male alias‚Äîwas found by Malduk in the snow when she was around eight years old with a dead soldier and his horse, also dead. At the beginning of Fell, Alina is fifteen, hiding the fact that she is female by keeping her red hair short and by binding her chest. Alina is an avid storyteller, and her stories usually consist of tales about goblins, Baba Yaga, and fairies‚Äîanything to take her mind from what Malduk and Ranna put her through. Over the years, though, Alina had gotten quite good at storytelling and likes telling stories for their own sake, and enjoys telling stories to others such as Mia. She lives with Malduk, Ranna, and their niece Mia. Because of a \\"magic potion\\" given to Alina by Malduk, she has developed amnesia and only in dreams can remember pieces of what happened to her before she was lost in the snow. Alina flees her home when Ranna frames her for murder. Malduk - old shepherd who, because of his injured back, makes his wife and Alina do a lot of the work around his home. Malduk took Alina in after finding her in the snow, and constantly hangs the idea that Alina owes him for it over her head. He is a superstitious, often cruel man who hardly gives Alina anything to eat aside from bread and a \\"potion\\" that he claims will keep the goblins away from Alina, who is said to be a Changeling. A tsinga, or witch/gypsy, gave Malduk the mixture that in reality gave Alina amnesia. This was to ensure that the topic of where Alina came from would not come up, since the girl was already under suspicion because of her strange origins and red hair. Alina's red hair is mentioned in the book, and the villagers of Moldov seem to think that she's a Saxon. Malduk makes Alina do more work than even a boy is expected to do, and both he and his wife Ranna treat her cruelly. Malduk, while pursuing Alina with a band of villagers, is killed by Fell when the wolf moves to protect Alina. Ranna - Malduk's wife, and a person who is even more cruel than her husband, who actually is somewhat afraid of his wife because of her temperament. Unlike Malduk, Ranna has no reservations about things such as killing‚Äîapparently Malduk would have killed Alina had he not been so superstitious, and had he not felt some affection very deep down for the girl. When Alina is accused of murdering Bogdan, who was another shepherd of Moldov, Ranna (who really murdered Bogdan using Alina's knife) pretends to be hurt by Alina's supposed act, saying she \\"loved him [her] so.\\" Mia - The niece of Malduk and Ranna. Mia was taken in by her aunt and uncle after her parents died of a sickness. Mia hates the way that her uncle and aunt treat Alina, and her, but does not speak out about it. She does however do secret things for Alina, like bring her food, and find a key to Malduk's locked chest‚Äîa chest that had something important to revealing Alina's past inside it. Mia takes risks to do anything she can for Alina, who she admires, and the girl makes up for the ill treatment her aunt and uncle give. Mia loves hearing stories about goblins and fairies from Alina. She playfully believes that since Alina is a goblin child she can use magic to put a spell on her aunt and uncle to make them nicer. After Malduk is killed by Fell, it is discovered that Ranna has fled Moldov with Mia. Ivan - A kind old man of Moldov who is also a close friend of Alina's. He suspected a long time ago that 'Alin' was really a young woman when she did not go through the same changes as the other boys in the village. He did not tell this to Alina until after she had fled Moldov to avoid being accused of a murder she didn't commit. Ivan is one of the few who believes in Alina's innocence, and he assists Alina in her escape by giving her his walking stick and a bag with provisions. He dies after being tortured by Malduk. Although Malduk states that Ivan had a heart attack when he \\"questioned\\" him, Alina sees through this. Lescu - A swordsmith who lives in Baba Yaga's valley with his son, Catalin. Lescu's wife died previous to the events of Fell, and he has raised Catalin alone, and knows that his son is a little lonely from growing up without a mother. When Alina reaches the valley of Baba Yaga, Lescu lets her stay in a spare room in his home. Lescu was friends with Ivan, and lets Alina live in his house when she mentions that Ivan told her to find him. Some time after Alina has been living in his house, she requests that Lescu teach her to be a warrior, because she wants to be able to face anyone that comes after her. At first Lescu refuses, which creates a rift between him and Alina, but he realizes that Alina does need to be able to defend herself so he teaches her. He forges a sword for her, and on the day he finishes it, he is killed by Vladeran's soldiers when they discover Alina is living with him. Catalin - Lescu's son, a young man around Alina's age. His mother died when he was young, so he has grown up without a mother and according to Lescu is lonely because of it. Catalin is interested in Alina when he first meets her, and he begins to feel attracted to her, and Alina does as well. He distances himself from her a few times in the book because he learns that she has been travelling with Fell, who he thinks is the devil in wolf form. Catalin also feels distanced from Alina because she is learning arts that he believes only men should learn. He makes up with her later, however, after she and Fell are caught in an ambush by the remaining soldiers of Vladeran that escaped from his house after killing Lescu. He travels with her to the village of the Helgra to find out more about them and to help Alina learn more about Vladeran and Castelu. Lord Vladeran - The ruler of Castelu, cousin and ally of Draculea. It's said that he's allied with Draculea to bring down King Stefan Cel Mare. Vladeran is Alina's step-father, who married Alina's mother Lady Romana after her father supposedly died. He cast out Alina after his baby son was taken by wolves (this event happened in The Sight). In addition to calling Alina a traitor and throwing her out, at one point Vladeran contemplates murdering his seven-year-old son, Elu. Vladeran learned dark magic and gained the ability to talk to the dead‚Äînamely, Morgra, Fell's deceased aunt who had the Sight and put a 'curse' on him and his family when they refused to let her travel with them. Vladeran and Morgra torment Fell using the Sight and the dark arts Vladeran learned. Lady Romana - Alina and Elu's mother. At one point, Romana hated Alina because she lost Elu. Later, however, it is revealed that Romana has realized her mistake of blaming Alina. She was the one who helped Alina escape from Castelu prison after Vladeran had captured the fifteen-year-old girl, and asked for her daughter's forgiveness for not seeing the truth of what Vladeran was doing. Elu - Alina's baby brother, and Lord Vladeran and Lady Romana's seven-year-old son. He was taken from his bed by wolves in The Sight when Alina was just eight years old. Alina had been instructed to watch her brother overnight, but got hungry and went to the kitchen for food, only to come back into and discover that her brother was gone. Elu, named Bran by the wolves, possessed The Sight and had a little strip of 'fur' on his stomach that made the wolves view him as a marked one. The wolves kept Elu/Bran for a while, and a short time after Larka gave the Vision to her brother, Fell took the infant human back to his home. Elu, having been so young, naturally does not remember any of what happened, and likely no one told him that he was taken away by wolves. Lord Dragomir - Lady Romana's previous husband, Alina's father, and Elu's step-father, or so it could be assumed since Elu's birth father Vladeran was killed by Fell. Vladeran and Dragomir were close friends, but Vladeran betrayed him. Before a battle, Vladeran deliberately damaged Lord Dragomir's saddle so that he fell off his horse and was supposedly killed. Vladeran received a prophecy from Morgra that he \\"could only be killed if her [Alina's] father is in sight of these very halls\\", but thought that he never could be since he'd seen Lord Dragomir die. Bogdan - A villager of Moldov that Ranna murdered with Alina's knife. Ranna and Malduk dislike him, believing that he has eyes on their land, Alina (who he calls a warlock), and Ranna herself for a wife. Ranna framed Alina for murdering Bogdan so the villagers would turn against and kill the young girl in retribution. It seems Ranna did this so she and Malduk could be rid of Bogdan, and Alina in one go without actually killing the girl themselves‚Äîif they did, they believed Mia would figure it out, since she was close to Alina. Barbat - A villager of Moldov who was one of the men who found Bogdan's body with Alina's knife in his back. The Wolves  Fell - The black-furred wolf once was tricked by Morgra, his aunt, into believing that he was the evil wolf, Wolfbane. Thanks to his sister Larka, though, he was snapped out of this. Fell still goes against Morgra even though she died several years ago. Fell feels guilt for his sister's death and became a Kerl (a wolf with no pack) because of the guilt. He also feels that since he was once Wolfbane, he is afraid of harming his family, and so stays away from them. He wonders about the Sight, and wonders what he should do. Several times he asks himself if he is in the light, or the dark. Ottol, a beaver, puts the same question past him, but tells Fell that he enjoys the sunlight like most creatures even if he chooses the darkness. By the end of the book Fell knows that he had finally left the darkness and can escape the shadows of the past to become a true wild wolf, and start a new life with Tarlar. Kar - Fell's adopted brother, a gray wolf. His parents were killed in The Sight, but Skop saved him and took him to join Huttser's pack. Kar always acted a little more like a Sikla (Omega) wolf than he should, but still has moments of bravery. He finds Fell later when he was travelling with Tarlar as they tried to keep away from Jalgan. Kar asked Fell to join up with them and fight Jalgan, but Fell still has reservations about re-joining his pack. Tarlar - A female gray wolf who Fell first met while she was travelling with Kar. She and her younger brother, Kenkur, were once part of Jalgan's pack, and Jalgan saw Tarlar as his mate. Tarlar didn't see fault with Jalgan and ignored her younger brother when he tried to warn her that Jalgan was no good. Kenkur was challenged by Jalgan, who called him \\"a Sikla and a traitor\\", before killing him. Then Tarlar left, but Jalgan still saw her as his mate. Tarlar, however, does not want him and begins to fall in love with Fell, who also begins to love her in return. Jalgan - Leader of the Vengerid, a pack of Draggas and Drappas who fight just for the purpose of fighting. Jalgan is a huge, strong grey wolf, with a stripe of silver down his back. Jalgan challenges Fell's parents, and eventually kills Fell's father, Huttser. Fell takes his revenge and kills Jalgan. Larka - Fell's sister who sadly met a tragic end in first book re-appears as a spirit to warn Fell that he must help a human girl to save the certainty of life and balance of the wild.

Work The oeuvre of Houben's architecture is wide-ranging and includes projects such as universities, libraries, theatres, residential areas, museums and hotels. Houben combines the disciplines of architecture, urban planning and landscape architecture. According to her biography on her firm's website, she \\"bases her work on precise analysis coupled with an intuition built over three decades [by interweaving] social, technical, playful and human aspects of space-making together in order to create a unique solution to each architectural challenge.\\" Francine strives to design architecture that appeals \\"to all the senses\\" and states that \\"[architecture] is never a (purely) intellectual, conceptual or a visual consideration alone. Architecture is about combining all of the individual elements into a single concept. In the end, what counts is the arrangement of form and emotion. Architecture should touch all the senses.\\" Houben focuses on designing wholesome buildings that cover a large variety of project programs. Her practice is particularly known for the design of libraries. The library at the Delft University of Technology, completed in 1997, led to the Library of Birmingham in 2013,Birmingham City Council, and the current refurbishment of the Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial Library in Washington, D.C.DC Public Library and the New York Public Library Midtown renovation (Mid-Manhattan Library and the Stephen A.

CIMA works to improve the development of independent media worldwide while working to strengthen the support for such development. The center works to improve the effectiveness of existing media development efforts by conducting research and bringing together a broad range of experts to share their experiences. CIMA's mission is based on the conviction that free and independent media play an indispensable role in developing sustainable democracies around the world. History The authorization to start CIMA was first introduced in the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 in order to create an establishment of a media network that would ensure the promotion of freedom of the press and freedom of the media worldwide, respect journalistic identity, and ensure that widely accepted standards for professional and ethical journalistic and editorial practices are employed when assessing international media. This media network, later established as CIMA, was aimed to provide an effective forum to convene a broad range of individuals, organizations, and governmental participants involved in journalistic activities and the development of free and independent media. The Secretary of State authorizes grants for the such funding of a media network through the National Endowment for Democracy to manage a free and independent media network. This media network was proposed as the Center for International Media Assistance in a proposal by the National Endowment for Democracy to the Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor‚Äîthe United States Department of State's largest single funder of independent media. Since the founding of the National Endowment for Democracy, media has played an important role in promoting democracy for the National Endowment for Democracy, with around $14 million annually going to support media development.Organization Donors In 2006, CIMA was founded as an initiative of the National Endowment for Democracy with encouragement from Congress and a grant from the State Department's Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor. Activities By focusing on effectiveness, sustainability, innovation, and funding, these four cross-cutting issues in media development encompass CIMA's efforts to improve the quality and capacity of the media sector.About CIMA CIMA approaches its mission through three main activities: reports, events, and catalyst activities. In order to remain a neutral platform and avoid competition with existing media development organizations, CIMA does not give grants or any other form of funding. The center strives to build a foundation of knowledge for media development donors, implementors, and civil society actors on the best practices and solutions for improving media systems. Reports CIMA's reports provide a knowledge base on a variety of topics in media assistance. The goal of these reports is to provide policymakers, as well as donors and practitioners, with practical information on the importance of free media to the development of a society. These reports fall into three basic categories: research reports,CIMA Research Reports working group reports,CIMA Working Group Reports and event reports.CIMA Event Reports =Empowering Independent Media= CIMA's inaugural 2008 report Empowering Independent Media: U.S. Efforts to Foster Free and Independent Media Around the World was a first-of-its-kind look at the media development field as a whole. This comprehensive report provides an in-depth assessment of U.S. international media development efforts, both public and private, and calls on future efforts to be more long-term, comprehensive, and need-driven. Recommending a more holistic approach, the report looks at the international media development field from a number of perspectives: funding, professional development, education, the legal-enabling environment, economic sustainability, media literacy, new media, and monitoring and evaluation. According to the report, media assistance is increasingly being regarded as a fundamental building block in developing democratic states. These efforts can help countries make democratic transitions, spur economic growth, improve government accountability, conduct public health campaigns, increase education and literacy levels, and empower women and minorities. The report's recommendations include: establishing media development as its own sector of international assistance rather than only as a part of other development efforts as is the current trend; taking longer-term approaches to projects; engaging the local media community more in project design and implementation; improving journalists‚Äô professional skills and ethical standards; providing greater support to improve the legal-enabling environment; emphasizing media literacy; building stronger media management skills; integrating new technology; refining monitoring and evaluation methods; improving coordination among donors and implementers; and integrating communication for development strategies in overall media assistance efforts. On May 2, 2007, CIMA hosted its inaugural event to launch the report. The event was held at the U.S. Capitol building to celebrate World Press Freedom Day with honorary co-hosts of the Congressional Caucus for Freedom of the Press.Empowering Independent Media Events Raising the visibility of international media development and improving its effectiveness are core goals of the center. CIMA works to improve understanding of how free and independent media matter by hosting discussions and panels in addition to convening working groups and publishing reports.CIMA Events These events are generally open to the public and range from panel discussions on topics such as new media or the status of media in a specific country to roundtable discussions featuring implementers, donors, academics, and government representatives to offer commentary on critical issues in the field. CIMA also organizes working groups, which are not open to the public, but instead invite a range of experts on an issue to have a substantive discussion and share their knowledge. The center also regularly holds events to launch its reports as well as relevant reports published by other organizations. These events are usually held in the Washington, DC area, but occasionally can be hosted abroad. Key issue areas for the events focus on effectiveness, sustainability, innovation and funding in different geographical regions. Previous discussion topics range from foreign aid, philanthropy and change in media systems to Internet governance and the future of news.Internet Governance CIMA Event Recaps of these events can be found on CIMA's blog along with other commentaries on media development issues. Catalyst Activities When CIMA recognizes a need in the media assistance field, it works to fill that gap. Toward this end, CIMA developed an online bibliographic database of media assistance resources. With over 900 books, articles, reports, and manuals, this database serves as an important resource for anyone interested in media development issues. In order for these resources to be comprehensive, CIMA compiles data on media systems in Africa, Asia, Europe and Eurasia, Latin America and the Caribbean, and Middle East and North Africa.CIMA Regions CIMA's legal environment working group also noted the need for a centralized resource for media lawyers around the world. Following up on this idea, CIMA worked with the Annenberg School for Communication at the University of Pennsylvania to launch a Web site called Global Media Law. This site serves as a networking and information resource for anyone interested in media law issues around the world.

The pump motor is attached to the vertical shaft at the top of the tube outside and above the drum and the pumping element is located at the end of the shaft inside the drum.

The coalition failed to earn a second European Parliament seat by 0.01%, or a few hundred votes at the expense of NDSV. * In the 2009 Bulgarian parliamentary election, the coalition won 6,8% of the popular vote and 15 of 240 seats * The October 2011 presidential elections were a disaster for the coalition. Their candidate, Rumen Hristov, secured only 1.95% of the popular vote. Strong rifts emerged in the coalition as the SDS and the DSB failed to reach a consensus on candidates for the municipal elections - also held in October.  Dissolution  On 15 May 2012 the Union of Democratic Forces National Council voted 49-34 to leave the Blue Coalition and stand alone in the next parliamentary elections. This move came after negotiations between the two major powers of the coalition, SDS and DSB, concluded that the coalition must be dissolved.

He is a former Delta Force team leader who chose to retire from the US Army in lieu of a Courts Martial after auditors discovered several false claims on travel vouchers. He received an honorable discharge. Repatriating American children CTU focused for some time on recovering children who had been kidnapped into foreign countries, generally kidnapped by the children's fathers who were foreign nationals married to American women. Children kidnapped into countries that were signatories of the Hague Treaty could be helped by the US State Department, but the State Department could take no action in non-signatory countries and warned mothers against \\"hostile recoveries\\" by CTU or other Americans. Feeney told Playboy, \\"Our operations are scams. 95 percent brains. We cannot use weapons or fake documents in foreign countries. If I do, it's federal time.\\" =Cathy Mahone= In 1988, a mother named Cathy Mahone hired CTU to recover her daughter from Jordan. CTU successfully recovered the child and secreted her into Israel, and the story became the inspiration for the TV movie Desperate Rescue: The Cathy Mahone Story, which led to more publicity and business for the company. The US State Department apologized to Jordan after the mission.https://www.upi.com/Archives/1989/03/05/Businessmen-rescue-kids-in- foreign-country/7077605077200/ =1992 attempt in Iceland= In 1992, CTU was retained on behalf of two American citizens, Fred Pittman and Brian Grayson, seeking to locate and repatriate their respective daughters. The girls' Icelandic mother, Erna Eyjolfsdottir (Erna Pittman Grayson) had taken them to Iceland in violation of Florida court orders. CTU's mission ended unsuccessfully, with the two daughters remaining in Iceland and Feeney and CTU employee Brian Grayson being arrested, tried and convicted of kidnapping in an Icelandic court. Feeney was sentenced to serve two years in prison. The event was the subject of an NBC Dateline story titled, \\"Rambo Goes to Reyjavik.\\" Unhappy with their portrayal, CTU unsuccessfully sued NBC for defamation.Id.

The Washington Post reported that the five suspects were arrested by Iraqi authorities following a tip from the FBI., and the AP reported they were arrested during the raid on the Corporate Training Unlimited's offices and barracks because their weapons permits had expired. Iraqi officials initially suspected that two of the men were involved in the murder. Later, CNN quoted officials at the US Embassy who stated the five men were not suspected of the murder. CNN reported that \\"a source close to the suspect\\" said that all five had alibis. Three of the contractors were later released on June 11 due to lack of evidence. Milligan and Jones, who were held longer by the FBI, were released in July.

Background Wajima was bred by Bull Hancock's renowned Claiborne Farm of Paris, Kentucky. He was out of the French mare Iskra, a daughter of Le Haar, the Leading sire in France in 1963. Wajima was a son of one of America's greatest sires, Bold Ruler. Sold as a yearling for a then-record $600,000 ($ million inflation adjusted), he was purchased by a four-man syndicate comprising James Welch of Alexandria, Louisiana, James A. Scully of Lexington, Kentucky, Harold I. Snyder of Dover, Ohio, and leading Japanese breeder Zenya Yoshida. The partners named the colt after Japanese sumo wrestler Wajima Hiroshi. They raced him under their nom de course, East-West Stable. Wajima was conditioned for racing by trainer Stephen A. DiMauro, Racing career =1974: two-year-old season= Wajima made four starts at age two in 1974, winning twice. His best result in an important stakes race was a second to L'Enjoleur in track record time in the November 3rd running of the Grade 1 Laurel Futurity. =1975: three-year-old season= As a three-year-old in 1975, Wajima suffered leg problems at the beginning of the year and did not run in the U.S. Triple Crown series. He made his first start in June, finishing second in both the Saranac Stakes and the Dwyer Handicap. He got his first stakes race win on July 19, 1975, setting a track record for a mile and an eighth in winning the Marylander Handicap at Bowie Race Track. Wajima then won four more important stakes races in a row, next taking the Monmouth Handicap and the Travers Stakes. He next defeated that year's Kentucky Derby winner, Foolish Pleasure, plus the 1974 American Horse of the Year, Forego, and future Hall of Fame inductee Ancient Title to win the Governor Stakes at Belmont Park.https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=VjIMAAAAIBAJ&sjid;=fF8DAAAAIBAJ&pg;=4991,719728&dq;=east+west+stables September 2, 1975 In the most important race of his career, on September 13 Wajima defeated Forego again in winning the 1¬º mile Marlboro Cup at Belmont Park, which prompted a New York Times article titled Wajima Now Rated A $600,000 Bargain. In late September 1975, Wajima was syndicated for a world- record price of $7.2 million ($ million inflation adjusted). Organized by Leslie Combs II, the syndicate was made up of 36 shares of $200,000 each with the four members of the East-West Stables retaining 21 of the 36 shares. Other share purchasers in the syndicate included prominent American and international breeders such as Cardiff Stud Farm, John C. Mabee, Aaron U. Jones, George R. Gardiner, Robert Sangster, and Bertram & Diana Firestone. After he finished second in the September 27, 1975, Woodward Stakes and in the October 25 Jockey Club Gold Cup, in early November Wajima's owners announced his retirement from racing. At year's end, he was voted the Eclipse Award as the 1975 American Champion Three-Year-Old Male Horse. Stud record Wajima was sent to stand at stud at Leslie Combs II's Spendthrift Farm in Lexington, Kentucky. His progeny met with modest racing success. From his seventeen crops, he sired twenty-six stakes winners, including four graded winners, the best of which was Key to the Moon, a winner of the Queen's Plate in Canada and stakes races in the United States, who was voted the 1984 Canadian Champion Three-Year-Old Male Horse. In 1987, Wajima was moved to Stone Farm in Paris, Kentucky, where he was pensioned in 1992. He died on August 27, 2001, of old age and was buried at Stone Farm.

The island attracts a small number of visitors each year, mainly game fishermen and bird enthusiasts. Geography Rubondo Island is located in the south- western corner of Lake Victoria, Tanzania. Rubondo Island is about west of Mwanza. The main island, Rubondo (2o 18‚Äô S, 31o 50‚Äô E) is 237 km2 in size. The island protects another 11 islets, none much larger than 2 km2.Briggs, P. (2006). Tanzania. Bradt Travel Guide 5th edition. Pages 231-239. These 10 islands form the Rubondo Island National Park covering an area of . Lake Victoria is 1,134 metres above sea level. The highest point on Rubondo is the Masa Hills in the far south, at an elevation of 1,486m (350m above the level of the lake). The main island measures 28 km from north to south and is 3-10 km wide. Rubondo Island is on a rift in the lake. Rubondo essentially consists of a partially submerged rift of four volcanically formed hills, linked by three flatter isthmuses. The island has no rivers and the soil is volcanic. The habitat is mixed evergreen and semideciduous forest, which covers about 80% of the island‚Äôs surface area with common species including Croton sylvaticus, Drypetes gerrardii, and Lecaniodiscus fraxinifolius, and often with a dense understory of lianas, or woody vines.Moscovice, L.R., Issa, M.H., Petrzelkova, K.J., Keuler, N.S., Snowdon, C.T., Huffman, M.A. (2007). \\"Fruit Availability, Chimpanzee Diet, and Grouping Patters on Rubondo Island, Tanzania.\\" American Journal of Primatology, volume 69: 1-16. The forest is interspersed with patches of open grassland and, all but restricted to the Lukaya area, acacia woodland. The eastern lakeshore is characterised by rocky areas and sandy beaches whilst the western shore supports extensive papyrus swamps, lined with date palms. Climate There is a bimodal rainfall distribution, with peaks in December and April-May during the October-May rainy season. The annual temperature is 19-26 0C.Matsumoto-Oda, A. (2000). \\"Chimpanzees in the Rubondo Island National Park, Tanzania.\\" Pan Africa News 7 (2). History Welcome to Rubondo Island National Park Rubondo Island became a game reserve in 1965, to provide a sanctuary for animals. Rubondo Island was gazetted as a national park in 1977. Today Rubondo is uninhabited. Consequently, 80% of the island remains forested today. The 400 ‚Äúfisher folk‚Äù of the Zinza tribe, who lived on the island and maintained banana plantations, were resettled on neighbouring islands and onto the mainland by the government in the late 1960s. As a rule the court passed sentences of six weeks imprisonment for unauthorised landings on the island and six months for attempted poaching. Fauna Crocodile on Rubondo Over a four-year period (1966-1969) Professor Bernhard Grzimek of the Frankfurt Zoological Society (FZS) released 17 chimpanzees in four cohorts onto Rubondo Island. The first cohort of chimpanzees arrived in Dar es Salaam aboard the German African Line‚Äôs steamship Eibe Oldendorff on 17 June 1966 (Standard Newspaper Tanzania, 1966). The animals had no rehabilitation or pre-release training. The chimpanzees were all wild-born and purportedly of West African descent, although there are no records of specific country of origin for the majority of released individuals. The founder chimpanzees had spent varying periods, from 3.5 months to 9 years, in captivity in European zoos or circuses before their release. The chimpanzees after one year were able to find and eat wild foods and construct nests for sleeping, and have now reverted to an unhabituated state characteristic of wild chimpanzees. From 16 founders the population has now grown to around 40 individuals (estimate based on nest counts). In addition to chimpanzees, seven other species were introduced to the island: Roan antelope (Hippotragus equinus) and rhinoceros (Diceros bicornis) both now extinct, Suni antelope (Neotragus moschatus), elephants (Loxodonta africana), twelve giraffes (Giraffa camelopardalis), 20 black-and- white colobus monkeys (Colobus guereza), and grey parrots (Psittacus erithacus) confiscated from illegal trade. Chimpanzee research and Tourism In 2012-2014 a research group from University College London undertook a study of the Rubondo chimpanzees. Since 2015 to the present day Tanzania national park managers have been running a habituation project. The habituation process, which is overseen by TANAPA park managers is still on going. As a tourist it is still not possible to see the chimpanzees as of 2020. You are better of visiting the famous site of Mahale and Gombe National Parks in Tanzania if you want to see chimpanzees. Common native fauna include the vervet monkey (Chlorocebus aethiops), sitatunga (Tragelaphus spekei), hippopotamus, genet and bushbuck (Tragelaphus scriptus). Transport The Rubondo Airstrip lounge Rubondo Island can be reached by park boat from two different locations. One option is the boat from Kasenda, a small village near Muganza in Chato District. The other option is the boat from Nkome in Geita District. By airplane, Rubondo Airstrip can be reached with Auric Air or Coastal Aviation. Accommodation on the island includes the beautiful park bandas which are located close to the HQ office. The price to stay in these beautiful bandas (chalet) overlooking the waters of Lake Victoria is $45 per night self-catering.
