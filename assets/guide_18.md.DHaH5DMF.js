He was the commander of 22 brigade based in Trincomalee at the time of his death and played a pivotal role in the government’s counter terrorism offensive in the district.Lucky aspired for 'Carpet of Peace' Major General Wijayaratne was the senior most Sri Lankan military officer to die from a terrorist attack up to that time.War on terror revisited Early life and career Lucky Wijayaratne was born on 30 October 1944 to a well respected family in Galle and his father was a reputed ayurvedic physician in the area.Hudson River and Vanni: the Common Factor He was educated at Mahinda College, Galle, where he was a member of the school Cadet Corps. After finishing the school education he opted for the military service on 26 March 1964, after joining the Sri Lanka Army as a Cadet Officer in the Sri Lanka Military Academy. After completing the initial training successfully he was proceeded to the Pakistan Military Academy for advanced training. He followed many military courses, both in Sri Lanka and overseas and his high performance levels at those military training centres earned him a scholarship for postgraduate studies (MSc.) in Strategic Warfare at Aberdeen University in Scotland. During his military career, he began to perform well since the early days he joined as a commissioned officer in the Sri Lanka Light Infantry. After he was promoted to the rank of Lieutenant Colonel on 20 July 1985, he had the opportunity to serve as the Commandant of Infantry Training School at Minneriya, Staff Officer-I at Joint Operations Headquarters, Coordinating Officer for Uva, Matara and Trincomalee, Commanding Officer, 1 SLLI, etc. Lucky Wijayaratne was an officer who believed in strict discipline, commitment and dedication to achieve success in all assignments he was entrusted. He was well endowed with a keen foresight which helped him to pre-empt many possible impending enemy attacks with the operations he carefully planned and carried out in the battlefield, specially against the LTTE. Death The Tamil Tigers always felt the heat of his strong presence in the east and treated him as threat to their activities in the Eastern province. Although they could not take his life several times as planned, one of the deadly landmine blasts of the LTTE finished the life of the valiant battle-hardened army officer Lakshman Wijayaratne on 18 December 1990, while he was serving as the Area Commander of the 22 Brigade in Trincomalee. Major General Lakshman Wijayaratne, Police Superintendent Richard Wijesekara and six army soldiers were killed, when the vehicle they traveled was hit by a LTTE land mine at Morayaya along Trincomalee-Anuradhapura road.Dark memories on 18 December They were returning from a refugee camp near Horowupatana in Tricomalee, where they had met with refugees to ask them to return to their villages after LTTE had been driven out of the area. Awards Major General Lakshman Wijayaratne was awarded with several medals and decorations by the government of Sri Lanka and Sri Lanka Army, including Rana Wickrama Padakkama (RWP), Rana Sura Padakkama (RSP), Vadamarachchi Operation Medal, Purna Bhumi Medal and President’s Medal to commemorate his valuable dedication and service to the country.Major General Wijayaratne’s Death Anniversary Falls Today See also *Eelam War I *Eelam War II ReferencesExternal links *LuckyWijayaratne.org Category:1944 births Category:1990 deaths Category:Sri Lankan major generals Category:Alumni of Mahinda College Category:Alumni of the University of Aberdeen Category:People from Galle Category:Sri Lankan military personnel killed in action Category:Assassinated military personnel Category:Assassinated Sri Lankan people Category:People killed during the Sri Lankan Civil War Category:Landmine victims Category:Sinhalese military personnel ","title":"Lucky Wijayaratne"},{"id":"41038856","text":"Seyyedabad (, also Romanized as Seyyedābād) is a village in Sorkhkola Rural District, in the Central District of Savadkuh County, Mazandaran Province, Iran.

Composers Most of the Cologne School composers had studied in Cologne during the 1960s with Vinko Globokar, Mauricio Kagel, Karlheinz Stockhausen, or Bernd Alois Zimmermann, at either the Kölner Hochschule für Musik und Tanz, the , or at the Kölner Kurse für Neue Musik, organised by Prof. Hugo Wolfram Schmidt at the Rheinische Musikhochschule between 1963 and 1968 (; ; ). There is some disagreement about how to define the school and who its central figures are. One of the earliest writers on the Cologne School observed that a large proportion are foreigners, and chose to focus on seven non-German composers as representative: Ladislav Kupkovič from Slovakia, Péter Eötvös from Hungary, from Bulgaria, Daniel Chorzempa and John McGuire, both from the United States, Mesías Maiguashca from Ecuador, and Clarence Barlow from India . Seventeen years later, another writer identifies Barlow and three other composers, Gerald Barry (Ireland), Kevin Volans (South Africa), and Walter Zimmermann (Germany) as the central figures in the first wave of the group, and sees Stockhausen, Kagel, the Hochschule, and the Westdeutscher Rundfunk (through its electronic music studio, new-music concert series, commissioning of new music, and its commitment to innovative programme-making both in TV and radio) as the key agents that produced this group. According to this view, later important arrivals included Chris Newman, Claude Vivier, and John McGuire, but their approaches were in many ways at odds with the aesthetic of the earlier group . Performers One performer particularly associated with the Cologne School is the pianist . Organisations Several institutions founded in Cologne in the late 1960s and 1970s are associated with the Cologne-School composers. These include the Gruppe 8 (, , York Höller, , , Rolf Riehm, , and Bojidar Dimov), founded in early 1969 and disbanded in August 1972 , Feedback Studio (Johannes Fritsch, David C.

At the time of purchase Douglas Elliman had 10% of the New York City brokerage market and managed 15,000 apartments.

Howard and his father Paul did not inform Seymour about the transaction indicating that they were not required to do so as their side of the family had an aggregate 60% ownership of the partnership (20% by Paul Milstein and 10% with each of Paul's children). This led to a deterioration of the relationship between the two elder brothers, eventually leading to litigation and the unwinding of their long business partnership.

Milstein's interest in fostering continued investigations in this emerging field, and his family's tradition of support for organizations dedicated to patient care and scientific research, motivated him and his wife Vivian to establish The Milstein Awards in 1988, two years after interferon was first approved for the treatment of hairy cell leukemia. The Seymour & Vivian Milstein Award for Excellence in Interferon and Cytokine Research, commonly known as The Milstein Award, recognizes individuals who have made exceptional contributions to interferon and cytokine research, either in a basic or applied field. Many of these achievements have led to the advancement of human health. Milstein's son Philip continues to support this award, along with The Milstein Young Investigator Awards, which recognize the work of individuals who have made an impact on interferon and cytokine research early in their careers, and The Milstein Travel Awards, which give those who may not otherwise be able to attend the Annual Meeting of the ICIS an opportunity to share the most current interferon and cytokine knowledge with peers around from the world.

New York: Little, Brown and Company Rushin is an American journalist, novelist, and sportswriter for Sports Illustrated magazine. Rushin was named the 2005 National Sportswriter of the Year by the National Sportscasters and Sportswriters Association, and is a four-time finalist for the National Magazine Award. Book summary Chapter 1. The Baseball Grenade. Rushin discusses the link between the military and baseball and describes how the military endeavored to design a hand grenade shaped like a baseball which they believed would give American soldiers a natural advantage over the enemy because of the soldier's prowess in throwing balls. In this chapter he also discusses various stunts performed in the 20th century such as catching baseball dropped from planes.Rushin, pages 19-49 Chapter 2. Stairway to Heaven. Focused on baseball bats, Chapter 2 follows the history of bats and bat manufacturers from the game's earliest days to the development of the aluminum bat. The relationship between players and their bats is highlighted and the book includes several photos of players kissing their bats.Rushin, pages 50-72 Chapter 3. The Lost City of Francisco Grande. Developed at a cost of $4.5 million by San Francisco Giants owner Horace Stoneham, Francisco Grande was built adjacent to Casa Grande, Arizona as the spring training home for the Giants. The facility, opened in 1961, boasted a private airstrip, an 18-hole golf course, and five baseball fields as well as player rooms, training and administrative offices for the team. Rushin notes that many of Francisco Grande's buildings were decorated with baseball memorabilia such as bats, balls, and gloves and he then continues the chapter with a discussion of the development of baseball gloves. The chapter concludes with an overview of how the catcher's position changed over time and how the development and use of the hinged catcher's glove revolutionized the sport by allowing catchers such as Johnny Bench to catch one-handed.Rushin, pages 73-108 Chapter 4. The Men in the Gray Flannel Suits. The history of uniforms, stirrup socks and caps are the subject of this chapter. Using numbers on uniforms to identify players as well as stenciling their names on the backs of jerseys is also discussed.Rushin, pages 109-138 Chapter 5. The Beanproof Cap of Foulproof Taylor. Chapter 5 begins by describing challenges fielders face when looking for a fly ball in the sun. To see better, as well as to protect their eyes, players began wearing sun glasses in the early 1900s. Protecting a players eyes, however was of secondary importance to protecting a player's head which could only be accomplished by a hardened shell worn under, over or in the place of a cap. One of the early inventors of protective headgear was James Philip Leo Taylor, a British immigrant and inventor, who after suffering a groin injury, developed one of the first protective cups designed to protect male genitalia. Taylor's version of a protective cap never became popular nor did he ever achieve fame or wealth as a result of his other safety inventions, but eventually, and mainly as the result of devastating accidents, safety gear was worn by all baseball players.Rushin, pages 139-187 Chapter 6. The Decrepit Urinals of Ebbets Field. The consumption of beer by patrons drove the need for large and smartly designed ball park bathroom facilities that could quickly and safely drain the urine of thousands of fans. Some designs were well engineered, others such as those found at Ebbets Field, were not.Rushin, pages 188-218 Chapter 7. \\"The Redhots Warmed with Mustard Saved Many a Life.\\" Hot dogs, peanuts, popcorn and other ball park foods are discussed in chapter 7 as well as the rise of concessionaires who not only sold food and drink to fans, but over the years greatly enriched owners by selling souvenirs and clothing.Rushin, pages 219-250 Chapter 8. Row C, section 42, Seats 3 and 4 at the Polo Grounds. Bullets and baseball are the theme of chapter 8. A stray bullet fired from Coogan's Bluff as an Independence day prank in New York City accidentally killed a fan at the city's Polo Grounds on July 4, 1950. Exactly 35 years later, another bullet struck a fan, this time in Yankee Stadium. Rushin pieces the story together by recounting how a New York city police officer was shot in 1877 and given an award for valor that featured the letters \\"N\\" and \\"Y\\" superimposed on each other. The New York City police chief at the time was Bill Devery who later became the New York Yankees owner and adopted the design for the team. Featured on Yankees caps, the design has become one of the most recognized designs in the world.Rushin, pages 251-262 Chapter 9. Recessional. Rushin ends the book was a review of music in ballparks and the journey taken from organists to contemporary rock and relates the journey to the one he has taken growing up in the United States.Rushin, pages 252-288 Reviews As of November, 2013 the book had not been widely reviewed in national media outlets, however the notable reviewers who had reviewed the book praised it for Rushin's approach to the subject matter as well as for his entertaining prose.Dickson, Paul (November 8, 2013) \\"Baseball history as told through bats, balls and hot dogs\\" The Wall Street Journal.

She continued until 1909, when the Egyptian Mail Company deemed her unprofitable and dry-docked her in Marseille to be offered for sale. In 1910 the Canadian Northern Steamship Company of Toronto bought the ship and renamed her Royal George. She then did passenger service in the North Atlantic commencing on 26 May 1910 with the Avonmouth – Quebec City – Montreal route. She ran aground on 6 November 1912 attempting to put in at Quebec, but was salvaged and after repairs returned to service on 17 June 1913. World War I service The Royal George was taken over by the Canadian military when the First World War began, and sailed on 3 October 1914 from Gaspé Bay, Quebec for Plymouth, England with the Canadian Expeditionary Force. In 1915 she served in the Gallipoli campaign, and through the remainder of the war served as a UK troop ship. Royal George was returned at the end of the war to Cunard Line, which in 1916 had bought the entire fleet of Canadian Northern Steamships. Post-War service Royal George resumed passenger service on 10 February 1919, first between Liverpool, Halifax, Nova Scotia and New York, and later between Southampton, Halifax and New York. After nine voyages with the Cunard Line, she was retired in 1920 and used as a depot ship at Cherbourg Harbour in France to process emigrants, before finally being scrapped in 1922 at Wilhelmshaven, Germany.

John Bramley-Moore, 1845 portrait Life The youngest son of Thomas Moore, he was born in Leeds, and assumed his additional name of Bramley in 1841. As a young man he went out to Brazil to engage in commerce, and lived for several years at Rio de Janeiro, where in 1828 he entertained the officers of the exploring ships HMS Beagle and HMS Adventure. On his return to England in 1835 he settled at Liverpool as a merchant. In 1841 Bramley-Moore was elected by Liverpool town council as an alderman,Aldermanic Elections an office which he held for 24 years.Aldermanic ElectionsAldermanic ElectionsAldermanic Elections In 1841 he became a member of the dock committee (afterwards called the dock board), and in the following year was appointed chairman. He worked for the 1846 arrangement with the Earl of Derby, by which two miles of the foreshore of the River Mersey, from the borough boundary to Bootle, became available for the construction of docks. After the opening of the Albert Dock by Prince Albert in 1846 he was offered a knighthood, which he declined. Five other docks were opened on 4 August 1848, one of them receiving the name of Bramley-Moore Dock. Remaining contemporary sign for South Bramley-Moore Dock Bramley-Moore was elected Lord Mayor of Liverpool in November 1848, and during his year of office originated a fancy fair and bazaar by which money was raised for the local hospitals. In politics he was a Conservative, and was returned to Parliament in 1854 as Member for Maldon. He lost his seat in 1859, but then represented Lincoln from 1862 to 1865. He was an unsuccessful candidate for Kingston upon Hull in 1852, for Liverpool in 1853, and Lymington in 1859. For many years Bramley-Moore was chairman of the Brazilian chamber of commerce in Liverpool, and lobbied the government to reduce the duties on coffee and sugar. In 1863 he made a speech in parliament on the subject of the relations of England with Brazil, for which he was decorated with the Order of the Rose by the Emperor Pedro II of Brazil. Some years before his retirement from business Bramley-Moore went to live at Gerrard's Cross, Buckinghamshire, where he built a free reading-room. He died at Brighton on 19 November 1886, aged 86, and was buried at St. Michael's-in-the-Hamlet, Toxteth Park, Liverpool. Family Moore married in 1830 Seraphina Hibernia, daughter of William Pennell, British consul-general for Brazil, and left two sons, the Rev.

They are medium-sized ghost crabs reaching carapace width of . They can vary in coloration from pinkish to dark grey. They are one of only two ghost crab species found in the eastern Atlantic (the other being the tufted ghost crabs). However, African ghost crabs can easily be distinguished from tufted ghost crabs by the absence of long tufts of hair on the tip of their eyestalks. Taxonomy Ocypode africana was first described by the Dutch biologist Johannes Govertus de Man in 1881. It is classified under the genus Ocypode of the ghost crab subfamily Ocypodinae in the family Ocypodidae. The specific name is from Latin africana (\\"African\\"). They are commonly known as the \\"African ghost crab\\" in English, ocypode africain in French, and capuco africano in Spanish. Description African ghost crabs are medium-sized ghost crabs with deep bodies, reaching a maximum carapace width of . The rear part of the carapace is slightly narrower than the front, but it is more or less squarish in shape. The dorsal surface of the carapace is slightly convex. It is densely covered with small low bumps (tubercles), giving it a granular texture. The outer half of the upper edges of the eye socket curve distinctly inward, with the outer angles broadly triangular and directed forward. Their eyestalks are large and elongated, with the cornea occupying most of the bottom surface. But they do not possess the tuft of hair at the tip as in the tufted ghost crabs. Neither do they exhibit exophthalmy, the elongation (style) of the tip exhibited by some other members of the genus. Like other ghost crabs, one of the claw appendages (chelipeds, the first pereiopod pair) of gulf ghost crabs is much bigger than the other. The palm of the larger cheliped is broad with a granular texture on the upper surface and finely serrated on the bottom edge. The inner surface of the palm features stridulating (sound-producing) ridges, which is important for identifying different species within the subfamily Ocypodinae. In gulf ghost crabs, the stridulating ridge is short and composed of a row of 11 to 13 tubercles, spaced more distantly and with striae (thin lines) on the upper half. The smaller cheliped tapers towards a pointed end. The dactyl (tipmost part) of the walking legs lack the dense hair characteristic of tufted ghost crabs. The first gonopod (appendages modified into sexual organs) of the male is crooked sideways with a bulging tip. A thumb-like palp is present. The covering (operculum) of the female genital opening protrudes at the middle with strong rims on the sides. Ecology Like other ghost crabs dig deep burrows on sandy beaches, almost always one individual per burrow. They can dig about five inches into the sand in 15 minutes. Their burrows usually have a supplementary tunnel leading upwards from the main tunnel. This is usually used as a temporary refuge when escaping from danger. This may also prevent the crab from drowning when high tide inundates the burrow. They are generalist scavengers and predators of small animals, usually feeding on decaying plant debris and animal remains. They are primarily nocturnal, but they may emerge during the day. They are capable of morphological color change, being pinkish in hue during the morning hours and a darker grey in the afternoon or during rainy days. The behavior of African ghost crabs and tufted ghost crabs are distinctive from that of other crabs found in the same region. African ghost crabs usually forage for food in the moist sand just above the breaking waves. At the slightest sign of danger (even when the intruder sighted is still more than away), they race in a zigzagging path back to their burrows to hide. As such they are very difficult to catch. However, they can usually be found about deep if their burrows are dug up. When captured, they may assume an inert pose but will revive and race away to find hiding places when the opportunity arises. When their burrows are destroyed, African ghost crabs may mill about confusedly, attempt to enter other burrows (though they are usually evicted immediately by the owner after a brief fight), or disappear into the sea. Distribution African ghost crabs are native to the eastern Atlantic coast of western Africa, from Mauritania to Namibia. They are sympatric with the tufted ghost crab (Ocypode cursor), but are easily distinguishable, as they do not possess the tufts of hair on the tip of the eyestalks that characterize the latter. Their burrows are usually found in the same beaches as tufted ghost crabs. However, they commonly dig their burrows further up from the sea than tufted ghost crabs. Economic importance African ghost crabs are edible, but are too small to be eaten in the usual way. Like tufted ghost crabs, they can be cooked in a crab soup known as potage au tourlourou, but they are rarely caught for human consumption. Conservation The number and density of ghost crab burrows are regarded as valuable ecological indicators for quickly assessing the impact of human disturbance on beach habitats. A 2011 study discovered that the density and number of African ghost crab burrows tend to be higher and with larger diameter burrows in moderately disturbed beaches in comparison to highly disturbed areas (characterized by the presence of seawalls, foot traffic, and inorganic pollutants).

It is one of the two perennial species in the genus Zea. The other perennial, Z. diploperennis, is the sister taxon of Z. perennis. Those two species also form a clade with Z. luxurians. Together, the three species make up the Luxuriantes section in the genus Zea.Doebley, J. (1990). Molecular Systematics of Zea (Gramineae). Maydica, (35), 143–150. Z. perennis is the sole tetraploid in the genus and fertile hybrids with diploid Zea species are rare. Ribosomal ITS evidence suggested introgression between Z. perennis and Z. mays that must have come from either crossing the ploidy barrier or been from the diploid ancestral pool. Z. perennis is generally considered to be an autotetraploid from some ancestral population of Z. diploperennis.Buckler, E. S., & Holtsford, T. P. (1996). Zea systematics: ribosomal ITS evidence. Molecular biology and evolution, 13(4), 612–22. Due to the economic importance of maize, significant scientific interest exists in using the genes of the other Zea species for crop improvement. Z. perennis is of particular interest because of the potential for maize to become a perennial crop. However, difficulty in using genes from Z. perennis in Z. mays mays for crop improvement has occurred because the genes used often contain unwanted teosinte traits. Z. perennis is tropical and not winter hardy, which has led to problems in using its genes to make a perennial form of maize.Jackson, W., & Kirschenmann, F. (2009). A 50-Year Farm Bill.

EWPL traverses through the Indian states of Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Karnataka, Maharashtra and Gujarat. EWPL has been authorized as a common carrier pipeline. The East West Gas Pipeline supplies Natural gas to RIL's vast petrochemical complex at Gujarat and delivers gas to numerous customers via branch line connections along its length. The pipeline system features multiple compressor stations, numerous metering facilities at branch take-offs and an advanced control and communications network. The project is the first and largest privately owned cross-country pipeline in India and the backbone of India's burgeoning natural gas grid. Gas source The current gas source for EWPL is KG-D6 gas block located in Krishna Godavari Basin, 30 to 50 km offshore of the east coast of India. RIL has set up an Onshore Terminal at Gadimoga near Kakinada. System configuration EWPL is a uniform diameter (API 5L Grade X-70) pipeline across the entire trunk length of around 1375 km with wall thicknesses 17.2, 20.7 and 25.4 mm depending on the code requirement. The pipeline is 3LPE (three layer polyethylene) coated; internally epoxy lined, helically spiral submerged arc welded (for 17.2 mm) and longitudinal submerged arc welded (for 20.7 mm and 25.4 mm). Impressed current cathodic protection system has been provided to supplement the coating system for protection against external corrosion. Maximum Allowable Operating Pressure (MAOP) of the pipeline is 98.0 bar(g).Crossing India’s Narmada River using HDD — Pipelines International — The international pipeline magazine Gas price Recently, Indian government fixed the natural gas price at producer end (on shore point) as US on net calorific value (NCV) basis compared to earlier price of $4.2 per million BTU on gross calorific value basis. However the enhanced price would be applicable only after compensating the shortfall gas in the previous years. The earlier price of $4.2 per million BTU on gross calorific value (GCV) basis is calculated already at maximum price cap of Brent crude of $60 per barrel (159 liters) under the applicable formula linking the price of gas per million BTU (GP) to the price of oil: GP = 2.5 + (OP – 25) ^0.15 where OP is the annual average Brent crude price for the previous FY, with a cap of $60 per barrel and a floor of $25 per barrel. As the annual Brent price has always been above $60 since 2007, the revised gas price at $5.61 during the year 2014 is in excess of the applicable price by nearly 20%.

She bore the surname Yuan (), originally Tuoba. Yuan was the only child of Emperor Xiaoming (r. 515–528), born to his concubine Consort Pan. Soon after her birth, her grandmother the Empress Dowager Hu, who was also Xiaoming's regent, falsely declared that she was a boy and ordered a general pardon. Emperor Xiaoming died soon afterwards. On 1 April 528, Empress Dowager Hu installed the infant on the throne for a matter of hours before replacing her with Yuan Zhao the next day. Xiaoming's daughter was not recognised as an emperor (huangdi) by later generations. No further information about her is available. Birth Empress Dowager Hu (d. 528), known posthumously as Empress Dowager Ling, was originally one of Emperor Xuanwu's (483–515, r. 499–515) consorts; she gave birth to his only living heir Yuan Xu (510–528). Following Xuanwu's death, Yuan Xu ascended the throne as Emperor Xiaoming, and Hu was honoured as Consort Dowager, and soon Empress Dowager. Because Emperor Xiaoming was still young, she became his regent. To exert her power as the highest ruler of Northern Wei, she addressed herself as Zhen (), a first-person pronoun reserved for use by the emperor after the Qin dynasty. Officials addressed her as Bixia (), an honorific used when addressing the emperor directly.Book of Wei, vol. 13, \\"Biographies of Empresses\\" (後改令稱詔，羣臣上書曰陛下，自稱曰朕). When Emperor Xiaoming grew up, however, his mother refused to hand authority over to him. She successfully eliminated many of her opponents, including favourites of the emperor.Book of Wei, vol. 13, \\"Biographies of Empresses\\" (太后自以行不修，惧宗室所嫌，于是内为朋党，防蔽耳目，肃宗所亲幸者，太后多以事害焉). The ancient Chinese historians who wrote the official history of the Northern Wei portrayed her as promiscuous.Book of Wei, vol. 13, \\"Biographies of Empresses\\" (时太后得志，逼幸清河王怿，淫乱肆情，为天下所恶). Both her lifestyle and her ruling style elicited widespread dissatisfaction among officials and from her son. Emperor Xiaoming gathered the people to oppose her and executed her lover Yuan Yi (元怿) in 520,Book of Wei, vol. 22 (正光元年七月，叉與劉騰逼肅宗於顯陽殿，閉靈太后於後宮，囚懌於門下省，誣懌罪狀，遂害之，時年三十四。) causing deep hatred from his mother.Book of Wei, vol. 13, \\"Biographies of Empresses\\" (时太后得志，逼幸清河王怿，淫乱肆情，为天下所恶...于禁中杀怿...胡氏多免黜...母子之间，嫌隙屡起). After several failed attempts to overthrow the empress dowager, Xiaoming secretly ordered General Erzhu Rong to send troops to the capital Luoyang to coerce her into handing over the authority.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 152 (密诏荣举兵内向，欲以胁太后). When she learned about the plot, she discussed strategies with the officials who supported her.Book of Wei, vol. 13, \\"Biographies of Empresses\\" (郑俨虑祸，乃与太后计...). As these events were occurring, on 12 February 528, Consort Pan, one of Emperor Xiaoming's nine concubines, gave birth to a daughter.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 152 (乙丑，魏潘嫔生女，胡太后诈言皇子).Book of Wei, vol. 9, \\"Basic Annals of Suzong IX\\" (乙丑...皇女生，祕言皇子). Empress Dowager Hu falsely declared that the child was a son; she issued an edict the following day, ordering a general pardon and changing the emperor's reign title from Xiaochang (孝昌) to Wutai (武泰).Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 152 (丙寅，大赦，改元武泰).Book of Wei, vol. 13, \\"Biographies of Empresses\\" (母子之间，嫌隙屡起。郑俨虑祸，乃与太后计，因潘充华生女，太后诈以为男，便大赦改年). Accession and dethronement On 31 March 528, Emperor Xiaoming suddenly died in Xianyang Palace (显阳殿). The following day (1 April 528), Empress Dowager Hu declared the 50-day-old baby girl Yuan the new emperor, while she herself continued to be regent.Book of Wei – Biographies of Empresses – Biography of Empress Ling (太后乃奉潘嫔女言太子即位). She ordered another general pardon. As the year of Emperor Xiaoming's reign had not ended, the era name was not changed and the name \\"Wutai\\" remained in use. Empress Dowager Hu continued to be effectively in power. Just a few hours later, Empress Dowager Hu issued an edictBook of Wei – Basic Annals of SuzongHistory of the Northern Dynasties – Basic Annals of Wei IV – Basic Annals of Suzong, Emperor Xiaoming to dethrone the infant Emperor and declared that Yuan was a girl. She placed Yuan Zhaoson of the deceased Yuan Baohui (元宝晖), Prince of Lintaoon the throne instead.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 152 (潘充华本实生女，故临洮王宝晖世子钊，体自高祖，宜膺大宝。百官文武加二阶，宿卫加三阶). Yuan Zhao ascended the throne on 2 April 528, the day after Empress Dowager Hu issued the edict.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 152 (甲寅，太后立皇女为帝...乙卯，钊即位). As he was too young to rule, Yuan Zhao was made a puppet emperor under Empress Dowager Hu.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 152 (钊始生三岁，太后欲久专政，故贪其幼而立之). The series of events involving her son's death and the installation of the infant girl and the three-year-old Yuan Zhao on the throne occurred to ensure the continuation of her regency. Outcome Because Empress Dowager Hu replaced the emperor in an unbridled manner, General Erzhu Rong sent in troops to overthrow her, stating that she had deceived Heaven as well as the Imperial Court by letting the infant girl succeed to the throne.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 152 (又以皇女为储两，虚行赦宥。上欺天地，下惑朝野). Erzhu Rong made Yuan Ziyou (507–531) emperor. Not long after, Erzhu Rong sent troops to occupy the capital Luoyang, and Empress Dowager Hu and Yuan Zhao were held captive. They were delivered to his camp at Heyin (河阴). Empress Dowager Hu begged him for mercy, but he refused and had her and Yuan Zhao drowned in the Yellow River.Book of Wei, vol. 13, \\"Biographies of Empresses\\" (荣遣骑拘送太后及幼主于河阴。太后对荣多所陈说，荣拂衣而起。太后及幼主并沉于河). Erzhu later killed thousands of Han Chinese officials and their families who had served at the Northern Wei court during her regency. This massacre is known as the Heyin Incident (河阴之变). Erzhu Rong became the highest authority of the empire. From that time on, political power fell into the hands of powerful ministers and warlords. Gao Huan and Yuwen Tai were generals during the Erzhu Rong era who respectively controlled Eastern Wei and Western Wei following the split of the dynasty, while Erzhu controlled the northern part of the empire. This division eventually led to the downfall of the dynasty. For the acts she committed during her regency, Empress Dowager Hu was discredited and became infamous in history for causing the downfall of the dynasty.\\"灵后妇人专制。\\" History of the Northern Dynasties – Biographies of Imperial Consorts Controversy Yuan's status as an emperor (huangdi) remains controversial and is not recognised by many. Official historical records have never listed her as a legitimate sovereign because she was a puppet under Empress Dowager Hu and reigned for less than a day. She was also an impostor for the throne as a boy. Hence, Wu Zetian remains as the first and only recognised female huangdi in Chinese history.Was Wu Zetian China's only female huangdi? () of the appendix of Collections of Wu Zetian by Luo Yuanzhen (罗元贞), Shanxi People's Press, 1987, cited from the Historical Knowledge () magazine, 1985 Issue 5, Chengdu, China Researcher Cheng Yang (成扬) believes that the fact that Yuan was the \\"first female in history to ascend the imperial throne\\" cannot be denied despite it being a plot by Empress Dowager Hu. According to Cheng, Wu Zetian was not the only female huangdi, but the only one to have reigned over the empire. Luo Yuanzhen (罗元贞), another researcher on Wu, thinks that modern historians should not acknowledge Yuan's title as Huangdi as ancient Chinese historians did not.

Gakutei is best known for his kyōka poetry and surimono works. Biography Gakutei was born in Osaka around 1786, though his exact year of birth is somewhat unclear. He was the illegitimate son of the samurai known as Hirata who served under the Tokugawa shogunate. Gakutei's mother later married into the Yashima clan, explaining the artist's name. For some time, he worked in Osaka, focusing chiefly on woodblock prints called surimono in addition to book illustrations. Most of what is known about Gakutei has been surmised from the subjects and context of his work. Works Gakutei is noted for the quality in his wood printing works and for his general contributions to the body of ukiyo-e artwork. Specifically, critics have noted his technical prowess and precision, his skill in embossing, and that his specialization in surimono exceeded that of his teacher, Hokkei. Some of his work included a set of five woodblock prints featuring young women performing gagaku, a traditional kind of court music from the Heian period. Each woman plays an instrument: a reed called a shō, a woodwind called a ryūteki, a koto, a stringed instrument called a biwa, and a drum called a tsuri-daiko. Gakutei also illustrated an entire book called the related to the translated Chinese novel Suikoden. Gakutei also created landscapes and seascapes for books, which are rare pieces amongst Hokusai's pupils. Gakutei is also known for his prolific writing; he wrote many humorous poems called kyōka and used them in his artwork and prints. Additionally, he was responsible for a Japanese translation of Journey to the West, for which he also completed illustrations.

Anne’s Hospital () is a hospital located in Sainte-Anne-de-Bellevue, Quebec, Canada. It primarily serves veterans of the Canadian Forces and is specialized in long-term and geriatric care. It also treats younger veterans for operational stress injuries and posttraumatic stress disorder. The Hospital has 446 beds in private rooms, and underwent an extensive renovation in 2009. History Ste. Anne's Hospital was founded in 1917 in response to the many wounded Canadian veterans returning from World War I. It was built on land leased from McGill University on its Macdonald Campus, in close proximity to major rail lines and roads. In 1950, Veterans Affairs Canada purchased the hospital's grounds, which contained two dozen buildings, from McGill. Construction for a new hospital began in 1968, in order to replace the original buildings that were intended for temporary use. The new hospital, which is 14 storeys tall, was built so that it could be converted into a general hospital if required. The new hospital accepted its first patients in 1971. In order to comply with provincial standards for long-term care facilities, renovations were undertaken in 2003, which resulted in the construction of a thermal power plant and electrical substation, as well as a new building, the 116-bed Remembrance Pavilion to accommodate patients with cognitive impairment. The Main Pavilion was renovated from 2007 to 2009, and dormitories were converted into 446 private rooms. It is the last remaining hospital operated by Veterans Affairs Canada. On April 27, 2012, Veterans Affairs Canada and the Government of Quebec signed an agreement to transfer the hospital to provincial jurisdiction. On June 14, 2013, it was announced that Ste. Anne's Hospital would become geriatrics centre, and would be an autonomous entity reporting to the Montreal Health and Social Services Agency. ReferencesExternal links *Ste.

Life Born in London on 8 October 1824, he was the only son of William Caldwell Brandram. He was educated at Merchant Taylors' School, King's College School, and Trinity College, Oxford, where he graduated B.A. in 1846, and M.A. three years later. At university he was best known as an athlete, and also founded the initial Oxford Dramatic Society with Frank Talfourd. They performed typically at the Henley Regatta; Brandram danced in Talfourd's Macbeth Travestie in 1847.James Granville Adderley, The Fight for the Drama at Oxford (1888), pp. 6–7; archive.org. After leaving Oxford Brandram became a student at Lincoln's Inn, and was called to the bar on 22 November 1850. He practised as a barrister till 1876, when for financial reasons he took work as a professional reciter, and became a popular performer. He had amateur experience to build on with the Canterbury Old Stagers and the Windsor Strollers, and had played with Albert Richard Smith and Edmund Yates among others. He gave whole or almost complete plays of Shakespeare, or Sheridan. Brandram's theories on the brisk speaking of Shakespearian dramatic verse were influential on William Poel. While Brandram himself may be called a \\"forgotten eccentric\\", Poel was grateful enough to have raised funds for him, and his style of elocution formed part of Poel's drive to Shakespeare productions that were plainer and less self- consciously \\"poetic\\". Brandram died at 6 Bentinck Street, Cavendish Square, London, on 7 November 1892. He was buried three days later in Richmond cemetery. Works In 1881 Brandram published Selected Plays of Shakspeare, abridged for the use of the Young; it reached a fourth edition in 1892. Some passages were printed in full, joined by short narratives. In 1885 appeared Brandram's Speaker: a Set of Pieces in Prose and Verse suitable for Recitation, with an Introductory Essay on Elocution. It was reprinted (without the essay) in 1893, and in the same year he issued a further volume of Selections from Shakespeare.

Independent experts and medical reports verified the accounts of the victims to be credible and legitimate. Victim accounts Harrowing accounts of the victims appear throughout the documentary. One victim, Nandini stated that, she was picked up from her home earlier this year, driven blindfolded in a van and repeatedly raped by a succession of men in military and civilian clothing. Dr Alison Callaway, a doctor who is an expert witness for the UK courts and who had investigated over 200 cases of alleged torture from Sri Lanka in the last five years, concluded the physical and psychological evidence corroborated her story of recent rape and torture. Another victim Ravi who was detained for 4 years under the Government's 'rehabilitation' program, claimed that he was beaten, suffocated and abused severely while in the military's custody. Siva, who has papers to prove when and where he was held by the Government, also was subjected to such intense torture and abuse before he could move out of the country.

Most of them were Christians, including Maronites, Melkites, and Eastern Orthodox. Some immigrants were Sunni Muslims and Shia Muslims. Some Druze also immigrated. A February 6, 1900 article in the Detroit Free Press stated that \\"Detroit's Colony of Syrians\\" included 75-100 people, mostly Lebanese Maronites.Shryock and Abraham, \\"On Margins and Mainstreams,\\" p. 18-19. The Lebanese worked as peddlers and shopkeepers. Henry Ford's factories had 555 Syrian employees, including many recently-arrived Muslims, by 1916. 9,000 Arabic-speakers were among the residents of Detroit in 1930. Of them, 6,000 were Syrians. The remainder included Assyrians, Yemenis, and Palestinians. Immigrants from the Levant were originally labeled as being from the Ottoman Province of Syria. After 1920 the Ottoman Empire collapsed and European colonial administrators divided the areas in the Levant into Lebanon, Palestine, and Syria. Therefore immigrants into the Detroit began to be classified as Lebanese, Palestinians, and Syrians. Immigration from Iraq started in the beginning of the 20th century, and immigration from Yemen and the Arabian peninsula began in the early 20th century. A peak immigration of Iraqis occurred from 1927 to 1950, and a peak immigration of Yemenis and those from the Peninsula occurred from 1912 to 1925.

Demographics of Arabs Since their immigration to the United States in the 1870s, the Arab population has been continuously increasing. This increase can be observed in data collected by The American Community Survey and U.S Census Bureau. To determine this amount, surveys are sent out asking each individual to identify his or her \\"ancestry or ethnic origin.\\" This phrase is defined by the U.S Census Bureau as ethnic origin, descent, roots, heritage or place of person's or ancestor's birth. The U.S Census Bureau considers individuals who reported being one of the following ethnic origins as an Arab: Algerian, Bahraini, Egyptian, Emirati, Iraqi, Jordanian, Kuwaiti, Lebanese, Libyan, Moroccan, Omani, Palestinian, Qatari, Saudi Arabian, Syrian, Tunisian, and Yemeni. With the aforementioned criteria, it was estimated that 850,000 people with Arab ancestry (0.35 percent of the total population) lived in the United States in 1990. In 2004, 1.2 million (0.42 percent of the total population) resided in the U.S. The 2006–2010 ACS 5-year estimates show that an estimated 1.5 million people (0.5 percent of the total population) with Arab ancestry were living in the United States, representing a 76.0 percent increase since 1990. Currently, the ten states with the largest Arab populations are California, Michigan, New York, Florida, Texas, New Jersey, Illinois, Ohio, Massachusetts, and Pennsylvania, respectively. These populations are generally concentrated in metropolitan areas. Arab American communities are generally tight-knit, as they value family, tradition, and economic achievement. Earlier immigrants worked as peddlers and in factories. More recent immigrants, however, have taken up roles in all parts of society, including public leadership positions. These increasingly professional roles have helped establish a majority of the populations in bustling cities. Consequently, their increasing role in high- level positions has helped raise the median income of Arab American households to $56,433 compared to the $51,914 for all households in the United States. Economy of Arabs Many Lebanese own and operate stores, restaurants, shops, and other major businesses, they were historically known for this. Religion of Arabs The Islamic Center of America (Arabic: المركز الإسلامي في اميركا‎[1]) is a mosque located in Dearborn, Michigan. Although the institution dates back to 1963, [2] the Center's current mosque opened in 2005. It is the largest mosque in North America[3][4] and the oldest Shia mosque in the United States.[5] With its large Shia Arab population (consisting mostly of Lebanese), Dearborn is often called the \\"heart of Shiism\\" in the United States.

Sally Howell, author of \\"Competing for Muslims: New Strategies for Urban Renewal in Detroit\\", wrote that the mosque \\"has been credited\\" by public officials and area Muslims \\"with having turned around one of Detroit's roughest neighborhoods at the height of the crack cocaine epidemic of the 1980s, making its streets safe, revitalizing a dormant housing market, attracting new business to the area, and laying the foundation for an ethnically mixed, highly visible Muslim population in Detroit and Hamtramck.\\"Howell, p. 209. Chaldo-Assyrian Americans By 2004 the Metro Detroit area was home to the largest Assyrian diaspora community in the world. Most Assyrians originate from northern Iraq, although some originate from Iran, Syria, and Turkey. Assyrians in Detroit work as businesspersons, grocers, owners of liquor stores, and professionals. Most of the Assyrians in Detroit are of the Chaldean subgroup. According to the US census of 2007 there were 32,322 Chaldean/Assyrian/Syriac persons in the Wayne, Macomb, Oakland, and Washtenaw four-county region of Michigan. The publication \\"Arab, Chaldean, and Middle Eastern Children and Families in the Tri-County Area\\" of the From a Child's Perspective: Detroit Metropolitan Census 2000 Fact Sheets Series states that \\"Many Chaldeans believe they have a unique ethnic identity other than Arab and wish not to be considered part of the Arab population.

However, The majority of the Chaldo-Assyrian population settled in Metro Detroit in the late 1960s. The Chaldeans settled in this area because of job availability in the automobile industry, the presence of a Maronite Christian community, which Assyrians had much similarity with in terms of liturgy and church doctrine, and a pre-existing community in Detroit and nearby Windsor, Ontario. Typically newly arrived Assyrians initially worked in small family-owned stores which older Assyrian groups setup.Henrich and Henrich, p. 81.Levin, Doron P. \\"WEST BLOOMFIELD JOURNAL; Jews and Ethnic Iraqis: A Neighborhood's Story.\\" The New York Times.

The stores became larger, becoming large convenience stores. Once the socioeconomic standing of the Assyrians improved, older groups moved to the suburbs. During the first wave they settled Oak Park and Southfield, and during the second wave they moved to Birmingham, Bloomfield Hills, Farmington Hills, and West Bloomfield Township.

The hypothesis draws on some medieval sources such as the Khazar Correspondence, according to which at some point in the 8th–9th centuries, the ruling elite of the Khazars was said by Judah Halevi and Abraham ibn Daud to have converted to Rabbinic Judaism. The scope of the conversion within the Khazar Khanate remains uncertain, but the evidence used to tie the Ashkenazi communities to the Khazars is meager and subject to conflicting interpretations. Genetic studies on Jews have found no substantive evidence of a Khazar origin among Ashkenazi Jews, but have found evidence they have mixed Near Eastern/Mediterranean and Southern European origins. The hypothesis has had a complex history within academia. While most contemporary scholars dismiss it, the hypothesis has often been argued in the past, and still finds occasional defenders of its plausibility. In the late 19th century, Ernest Renan and other scholars speculated that the Ashkenazi Jews of Europe originated among Turkic refugees who had migrated from the collapsed Khazarian Khanate westward into Europe, and exchanged their native Khazar language for Yiddish while continuing to practice Judaism. Though intermittently evoked by several scholars since that time, the Khazar- Ashkenazi hypothesis came to the attention of a much wider public with the publication of Arthur Koestler's The Thirteenth Tribe in 1976. It has been revived recently by Eran Elhaik, who in 2012 conducted a study aiming to vindicate it. Despite skepticism, he and his collaborators reformulated the concept in 2016 by developing a novel method of genetic analysis, buttressing its results with the fringe linguistic theories of the linguist Paul Wexler.Batya Ungar-Sargon 'The Mystery of the Origins of Yiddish Will Never Be Solved,' Tablet 23 June 2014 The hypothesis has been used at times by anti- Zionists to challenge the idea that Jews have ties to ancient Israel, and it has also played some role in anti-Semitic theories. History=1806–1918 Some sources attribute to the Ukrainian Rabbi Isaac Baer Levinsohn (1788–1860) the first reference of a connection between the Ashkenazi Jews and the Khazars.Lawrence J. Epstein, Converts to Judaism: Stories from Biblical Times to Today, Rowman & Littlefield, 2015 p.72 Levinsohn also recorded that the tradition of their forefathers was that Ashkenazi Jews had earlier spoken Russian before acquiring Yiddish.Bernard Spolsky, The Languages of the Jews;A Sociolinguistic History, Cambridge University Press 2014 p.297 n.3.Shlomo Sand, The Invention of the Jewish People, Verso p.243. The hypothesis was advanced in 1808 by Johann Ewers,Vom Ursprung des Russischen Staats, . 1808 in the context of an early controversy over the foundations of the Russian state, which pitted scholars espousing a Norman origin for the Varangians against those who argued that these founders of the Kievan Rus' were Slavic and indigenous. Ewers proposed the idea that the Viking/Varangian founders were in fact Khazars.Alexander Vucinich, Science in Russian Culture: A History to 1860, Stanford University Press, vol.1 1963 p.213.Birgit Scholz, Von der Chronistik zur modernen Geschichtswissenschaft: die Warägerfrage in der russischen, deutschen und schwedischen Historiographie, Otto Harrassowitz Verlag, 2000 pp.13-14.Vilhelm ThomsenVilhelm Ludvig Peter Thomsen, The Relations Between Ancient Russia and Scandinavia, and the Origin of the Russian State: Three Lectures Delivered at the Taylor Institution. Oxford, in May, 1876, Cambridge University Press, reprint 2010 p.16. The Russian historian Nikolay Karamzin advanced the claim, asserting that considerable numbers of Khazars had left Khazaria for Kievan Rus' in the time of Vladimir I (980–1015).Jits van Straten, The Origin of Ashkenazi Jewry:The Controversy Unravelled, Walter de Gruyter 2011 pp.2-3. The German Orientalist Karl Neumann suggested as early as 1847 that the migration of Khazars might have contributed to the formation of the core population of the Jews of Eastern Europe, without however specifying whether he was referring to Judaizing Turks or ethnic Jewish residents of Khazaria.Mikhail Kizilov, 'National Inventions:The Imperial Emancipation of the Karaites from Jewishness,' in Roland Cvetkovski, Alexis Hofmeister (eds.),An Empire of Others: Creating Ethnographic Knowledge in Imperial Russia and the USSR, Central European University Press, 2014 pp.369-393 p.399, citing Karl Neumann, Die Völker des südlichen Russlands in ihrer geschichtlichen Entwicklung, (1847) 2nd ed. Teubner 1855 pp.125-6:'Die Chasaren verschwinden nun als gebietende Horde aus der Geschichte, aber ihr Name hat sich, wie bekannt, in den Ländern und an den Meeren, wo sie ehemals herrschten, noch Jahrhunderte lang und zum Theil bis auf den heutigen Tag erhalten. Auch ist ja die Masse des Volkes von dem Jaik bis zur Donau immerdar dieselbe geblieben; es haben die Chasaren nur die Herrschaft verloren, welche auf andere Türken überging, auf Petschenegen, Usen und Komanen. Reste dieses Volkes, namentlich der zum Mosaismus sich bekennenden Abtheilung, sind die Karaim im südlichen Russland und den ehemaligen polnischen Ländern, welche türkisch sprechen undauch in Körpergestalt und Gesichtszügen den Türken gleichen. Von der Krim aus mögen auch zuerst die Juden, welche, wie wir wissen, so zahlreich waren im Reiche der Chasaren, nach Russland und Polen gewandert sein.' Subsequently, Abraham Eliyahu Harkavi suggested in 1869 that there might be a link between the Khazars and European Jews.: Abraham Harkavy, O iazike evreev, zhivshikh v drevnee vremia na Rusi i o slavianskikh slovakh, vstrechaiuschikhsia u evreiskikh pisatelei, St. Petersburg. Three years later, however, in 1872, a Crimean Karaite, Abraham Firkovich, alternatively proclaimed that the members of his Turkic-speaking sect were descended from Turkic converts to Judaism.. This hypothesis, that the descendants of Khazar converts to Judaism formed a major proportion of Ashkenazim, was first proposed to a Western public by Ernest Renan in 1883.: Ernest Renan, \\"Judaism as a Race and as Religion.\\" Delivered on 27 January 1883.. In a lecture delivered in Paris before the Cercle du Saint-Simon on 27 January 1883, Renan argued that conversion played a significant role in the formation of the Jewish people, stating that: > This conversion of the kingdom of the Khazars has a considerable importance > regarding the origin of those Jews who dwell in the countries along the > Danube and southern Russia. These regions enclose great masses of Jewish > populations which have in all probability nothing or almost nothing that is > anthropologically Jewish in them.:Cette conversion du royaume des Khozars a > une importance considérable dans la question de l’origine des juifs qui > habitent les pays danubiens et le midi de la Russie. Ces régions renferment > de grandes masses de populations juives qui n’ont probablement rien ou > presque rien d’ethnographiquement juif.' The lively discussions of this thesis in the 19th century in Eastern Europe diminished as fears that both Russian nationalism and Jewish Ashkenazi identity might be compromised by it led to a suppression of research. Renan's thesis found an echo soon after, in 1885, when Isidore Loeb, a rabbi, historian and secretary of the Alliance Israélite Universelle, in arguing for the cause of Jewish emancipation, challenged the notion that nations were based on races, and the Jews therefore could be excluded as alien. To the contrary, he argued, they were no different from other peoples and nations, all of which arose from miscegenation: the Jews were no exception, and one could assume, he added, that many German and Russian Jews descended from the Khazars.Isidore Loeb ‘Reflections on the Jews,’ in Mitchell Bryan Hart (ed.) Jews and Race: Writings on Identity and Difference, 1880-1940, UPNE, 2011 pp.12-20 p.17. Cf. Isidore Loeb, Réflexions sur les Juifs,' Revue des Études Juives, 27 (1893) pp.1-31). This was published posthumously. Occasional suggestions emerged that there was a small Khazar component in East European Jews in works by Joseph Jacobs (1886), Anatole Leroy-Beaulieu (1893),, Israël chez les nations (1893):Eng.Israel Among the Nations (1895). Maksymilian Ernest Gumplowicz,. In the book Początki religii żydowskiej w Polsce, Warsaw: E. Wende i S-ka, 1903. and by the Russian-Jewish anthropologist Samuel Weissenberg.. Goldstein writes: ‘The theory that Eastern European Jews descended from the Khazars was originally proposed by . .Samuel Weissenberg in an attempt to show that Jews were deeply rooted on Russian soil and that the cradle of Jewish civilization was the Caucasus’. Weissenberg’s book Die Südrussischen Juden, was published in 1895. Leroy-Beaulieu, a critic of anti- Semitism who perhaps drew on Renan, queried whether or not thousands of Polish and Russian Jews might have their origins traced back to the \\"old nomads of the steppes.\\" In 1909 Hugo von Kutschera developed the notion into a book- length study,. Die Chasaren; historische Studie, A. Holzhauen, Vienna 1909. 2nd ed., 1910. arguing that Khazars formed the foundational core of the modern Ashkenazi.. Maurice Fishberg introduced the notion to an American audience in 1911 in his book, The Jews: A Study of Race and Environment.. Maurice Fishberg, The Jews: A Study of Race and Environment. When at the Versailles Peace Conference, a Jewish Zionist called Palestine the land of the Jewish people's ancestors, Joseph Reinach, a French Jewish member of parliament who was opposed to Zionism, dismissed the idea, arguing that Jews descended from Israelites were a tiny minority. In his view, conversion had played a major role in the expansion of the Jewish people, and, in addition, he claimed, the majority of \\"Russian, Polish and Galician Jews descend from the Khazars, a Tatar people from the south of Russia who converted to Judaism en masse at the time of Charlemagne.\\"John Quigley, Palestine and Israel: A Challenge to Justice, Duke University Press, 1990 p.71 Interwar years, 1918–1939 The idea was also taken up by the Polish-Jewish economic historian and General Zionist Yitzhak Schipper in 1918,. Schipper’s first monograph on this was published in the Almanach Žydowski (Vienna) in 1918, While in the Warsaw ghetto before falling victim to the Holocaust at Majdanek, Schipper (1884-1943) was working on the Khazar hypothesis.. by scholarly anthropologists, such as Roland B. Dixon (1923), and by writers like H. G. Wells (1921) who used it to argue that \\"The main part of Jewry never was in Judea\\",:\\"There were Arab tribes who were Jews in the time of Muhammad, and a Turkic people who were mainly Jews in South Russia in the ninth century. Judaism is indeed the reconstructed political ideal of many shattered peoples- mainly semitic. As a result of these coalescences and assimilations, almost everywhere in the towns throughout the Roman Empire, and far beyond it in the east, Jewish communities traded and flourished, and were kept in touch through the Bible, and through a religious and educational organization. The main part of Jewry never was in Judea and had never come out of Judea.\\". a thesis that was to have a political echo in later opinion.: Pasha Glubb held that Russian Jews ‘have considerably less Middle Eastern blood, consisting largely of pagan Slav proselytes or of Khazar Turks.’ For Glubb, they were not 'descendants of the Judeans . .The Arabs of Palestine are probably more closely related to the Judeans (genetically) than are modern Russian or German Jews'. . 'Of course, an anti-Zionist (as well as an anti-Semitic) point is being made here: The Palestinians have a greater political right to Palestine than the Jews do, as they, not the modern-day Jews, are the true descendants of the land's Jewish inhabitants/owners'.Roland Burrage Dixon The Racial History of Man, 1923; H. G. Wells, The Outline of History (1921) In 1931 Sigmund Freud wrote to Max Eitingon that the sculptor Oscar Nemon, for whom he was sitting, showed the lineaments of a \\"Slavic Eastern Jew, Khazar or Kalmuck or something like that\\".. In 1932, Samuel Krauss ventured the theory that the biblical Ashkenaz referred to northern Asia Minor, and he identified it with the Khazars, a position immediately disputed by Jacob Mann.. This interwar period consolidated also a belief, originally developed by the Russian Orientalists V.V. Grigor’iev and V.D. Smirnov, that the East European congregations of the Karaite sect of Judaism were descendants of Turkic Khazars.Mikhail Kizilov, The Sons of Scripture: The Karaites in Poland and Lithuania in the Twentieth Century, Walter de Gruyter 2015 pp.109ff., p.450. The idea of a Khazarian origin of the Karaites was then adopted as their official viewpoint.Barry Dov Walfish (ed.), Библиография Караитика: Аннотированная Библиография Караимов И Караимизма, BRILL, 2011 p.146. Seraja Szapszal (1873–1961), from 1927, the ḥakham of the Polish-Lithuanian Karaite community had begun to implement a thorough-going reform policy of dejudaizing Karaite culture and traditions and transforming along Turkic lines. As a secular Jew and orientalist he was influenced by Atatürk's reforms, and his policy was dictated by several considerations: Jews were suffering from harassment in public and private in Eastern Europe; he wished to forestall the threat he had intuited was imminent in both Fascism and Nazism, which were beginning to gain a foothold; he was passionate about the Karaites' language, Karaim, and its Turkish tradition, and somewhat insouciant of the Judaic heritage of his people. In 1934 Corrado Gini, a distinguished statistician, interested also in demography and anthropology, with close ties to the fascist elite, led an expedition in August–October 1934 to survey the Karaites. He concluded that Karaites were ethnically mixed, predominantly Chuvash which he mistook to be Finno-Ugric descendants of the Tauro-Cimmerians who at one point had been absorbed into the Khazars who for Gini however were not Turkic. A further conclusion was that the Ashkenazi arose from ‘Turko-Tatar converts to Judaism.’Mikhail Kizilov, The Karaites of Galicia: An Ethnoreligious Minority Among the Ashkenazim, the Turks, and the Slavs, 1772-1945, BRILL, 2009 pp.266,269-271,277ff.282, 335.Riccardo Calimani, Storia degli ebrei italiani, vol.3, Mondadori 2015 p.583. Though the Khazar-Karaite theory is unsubstantiated by any historical evidence, - the early Karaite literature speaks of Khazars as mamzerim, 'bastards' or 'strangers' within Judaism - this myth served a political purpose, of taking that community out of the stranglehold of anti-Semitic regulations and prejudices directed generally against Jews in Eastern Europe. 1939–1945 In 1943, Abraham N. Polak (sometimes referred to as Poliak), later professor of the history of the Middle Ages at Tel Aviv University, published a Hebrew monograph in which he concluded that the East European Jews came from Khazaria.. 'Poliak sought the origins of Eastern European Jewry in Khazaria'..First written as an article in 1941, then as a monograph (1943), it was twice revised in 1944, and 1951 as Kazariyah: Toldot mamlacha yehudit be'Eropa (Khazaria: History of a Jewish Kingdom in Europe) Mosad Bialik, Tel Aviv, 1951. In Nazi Germany, unlike most race theorists in Germany down to his time Hans F. K. Günther argued that the Jews were not a pure race, although he nevertheless considered them to be highly inbred. He argued that the Ashkenazi were a mix of Near Eastern, Oriental, East Baltic, Eastern, Inner-Asian, Nordic, Hamite, and Negro peoples and separate from the Sephardim. Günther believed that the conversion of the Khazars, whom he took to have been a Near Eastern race constituted a further external element in the racial makeup of the Ashkenazi Jews, strengthening its Near Eastern component. Günther's theorizing about racial consequences flowing from the conversion of the Khazars was embraced by Gerhard Kittel. The Karaite claim not to be ethnic Jews, but descendants of the Khazars, was eventually accepted by the Nazis who exempted them, unlike the Crimean Krymchaks with whom they had historic ties, from the policy of genocidal extermination on these grounds.Steven Bayme Understanding Jewish History: Texts and Commentaries, KTAV Publishers 1997 p.148.Raul Hilberg, The Destruction of the European Jews, (1961) New Viewpoints 1973 p.241. 1946–1949 In debates leading up to the UN plan in 1947 to partition Palestine into Jewish and Arab states, the British politicians John Hope Simpson and Edward Spears, intent on denying Zionism that part of its claim that drew on biblical arguments, asserted that Jewish immigrants to Mandatory Palestine were the descendants of pagan converts and not of the Israelites. The approach was one shared by both gentile and Jewish anti-Zionists. Rory Miller claims that their denial of a lineal descent from Israelites drew on the Khazar theory. In anti-Zionist argumentation delivered at the UN during 1947 Faris al-Khoury and Jamal Al- Husseini used the theory to oppose the creation of a Jewish state on racial and historic grounds. Cecil Hourani claimed that the Arab leaders had been convinced of the value of the argument by Benjamin H. Freedman. Internal British documents seem to support the claim. It would later play a role in Arab anti-Zionist polemics, taking on an antisemitic edge,:\\"Arab anti-Semitism might have been expected to be free from the idea of racial odium, since Jews and Arabs are both regarded by race theory as Semites, but the odium is directed, not against the Semitic race, but against the Jews as a historical group. The main idea is that the Jews, racially, are a mongrel community, most of them being not Semites, but of Khazar and European origin.\\" This essay was translated from Harkabi Hebrew text 'Arab Antisemitism' in Shmuel Ettinger, Continuity and Discontinuity in Antisemitism, (Hebrew) 1968 (p.50). though Bernard Lewis, noted in 1987 that serious Arab scholars had dropped it, remarked that it only occasionally emerged in Arab political polemics. 1950–1976 D.M. Dunlop, writing in 1954, thought very little evidence backed what he regarded as a mere assumption, and argued that the Ashkenazi- Khazar descent hypothesis went far beyond what \\"our imperfect records\\" permit.:'.' Léon Poliakov, while assuming the Jews of Western Europe resulted from a \\"panmixia\\" in the first millennium, asserted in 1955 that it was widely assumed that Europe's Eastern Jews descended from a mixture of Khazarian and German Jews.:'As for the Jews of Eastern Europe (Poles, Russians, etc.,) it has always been assumed that they descended from an amalgamation of Jews of Khazar stock from southern Russia and German Jews (the latter having imposed their superior culture).' Polak's work found some support from Salo Wittmayer Baron and Ben-Zion Dinur,. Sand cites Salo Wittmayer Baron,:'before and after the Mongol upheaval the Khazars sent many offshoots into the unsubdued Slavonic lands, helping ultimately to build up the great Jewish center of Eastern Europe'; and Ben-Zion Dinur, Yisrael ba-gola 5 vols., 3rd ed.

(OCLC:492532282) vol.1 p.2,5:'The Russian conquests did not destroy the Khazar kingdom entirely, but they broke it up and diminished it And this kingdom, which had absorbed Jewish immigration and refugees from many exiles, must itself have become a diaspora mother, the mother of one of the greatest of the diasporas (Em-galuyot, em akhat hagaluyot hagdolot)-of Israel in Russia, Lithuania and Poland.':’Salo Baron, who incorrectly viewed them as Finno-Ugrians, believed that the Khazars \\"sent many offshoots into the unsubdued Slavonic lands, helping ultimately to build up the great Jewish centers of eastern Europe’ but was dismissed by Bernard Weinryb as a fiction (1962).:’dismissed. . .rather airily’. In 1957 Salo Wittmayer Baron, called by his biographer an \\"architect of Jewish history\\",. devoted a large part of a chapter in his Social and Religious History of the Jews to the Khazarian Jewish state, and the impact he believed that community exercised on the formation of East European Jewries in his Social and Religious History of the Jews (1957).. The scarcity of direct Jewish testimonies did not disconcert Baron: this was to be expected since medieval Jews were \\"generally inarticulate outside their main centers of learning\\".. The Khazarian turn to Judaism was, he judged, the \\"largest and last mass conversion\\", involving both the royal house and large sectors of the population. Jews migrated there to flee the recurrent intolerance against Jews and the geopolitical upheavals of the region's chronic wars, which often proved devastating to northern Asia Minor, between Byzantium, Sassanid Persia, and the Abbasid and Ummayad Caliphates.. For Baron, the fact of Jewish Khazaria played a lively role in stirring up among Western Jews an image of \\"red Jews\\", and among Jews in Islamic countries a beacon of hope. After the dissolution of Khazaria, Baron sees a diaspora drifting both north into Russia, Poland and the Ukraine, and westwards into Pannonia and the Balkans. where their cultivated presence both established Jewish communities and paved the way, ironically, for the Slavonic conversion to Christianity.. By the 11th and 12th centuries, these Eastern Jews make their first appearance in the Jewish literature of France and Germany. Maimonides, bemoaning the neglect of learning in the East, laid his hopes for the perpetuation of Jewish learning in the young struggling communities of Europe but would, Baron concludes, have been surprised to find that within centuries precisely in Eastern Europe would arise thriving communities that were to assume leadership of the Jewish people itself. 1976-2019Koestler, The Thirteenth Tribe and contemporary views The Khazar-Ashkenazi hypothesis came to the attention of a much wider public with the publication of Arthur Koestler's The Thirteenth Tribe, which made sweeping claims for a Khazar legacy among the Ashkenazi in 1976. Koestler's work was both positively and negatively reviewed. Israel's ambassador to Britain branded the book \\"an anti-Semitic action financed by the Palestinians\\", while Bernard Lewis claimed that the idea was not supported by any evidence whatsoever, and had been \\"abandoned by all serious scholars\\".:'Some limit this denial to European Jews and make use of the theory that the Jews of Europe are not of Israelite descent at all but are the offspring of a tribe of Central Asian Turks converted to Judaism, called the Khazars. This theory, first put forward by an Austrian anthropologist in the early years of this century, is supported by no evidence whatsoever. It has long since been abandoned by all serious scholars in the field, including those in Arab countries, where Khazar theory is little used except in occasional political polemics.' Assertions of this kind has been challenged by Paul Wexler who also notes that the arguments on this issue are riven by contrasting ideological investments: \\"Most writers who have supported the Ashkenazi-Khazar hypothesis have not argued their claims in a convincing manner ... The opponents of the Khazar-Ashkenazi nexus are no less guilty of empty polemics and unconvincing arguments.\\"(p.537). Raphael Patai, however, registered some support for the idea that Khazar remnants had played a role in the growth of Eastern European Jewish communities,: \\"it is assumed by all historians that those Jewish Khazars who survived the last fateful decades sought and found refuge in the bosom of Jewish communities in the Christian countries to the west, and especially in Russia and Poland, on the one hand, and in the Muslim countries to the east and the south, on the other. Some historians and anthropologists go so far as to consider the modern Jews of East Europe, and more particularly of Poland, the descendants of the medieval Khazars.\\" and several amateur researchers, such as Boris Altschüler (1994) and Kevin Alan Brook, kept the thesis in the public eye. Brook's views evolved as new data became available: in the first edition of his book (1999), he contended that about one-fourth of Ashkenazic ancestry may trace back to the Khazars, whereas in the second edition (2006) he regarded the Khazar contribution as \\"small\\" and in the third edition (2018) he argued against any Khazar contribution. Koestler argued that the Khazar theory would mitigate European racially based antisemitism.: \\"Every prayer and ritual observance proclaims membership of an ancient race, which automatically separates the Jew from the racial and historic past of the people in whose midst he lives. It sets the Jew apart and invites his being set apart. It automatically creates physical and cultural ghettoes.\\" In 2007, Peter Golden suggested that at least some of the Ashkenazi Jews of Hungary in particular (along with some Hungarians) might have inherited a minority of their ancestry from Khazar remnants that migrated west.Golden, Peter B. \\"The Conversion of the Khazars to Judaism.\\" The World of the Khazars: New Perspectives. Brill, 2007. p. 150. The theory has been used to counter the concept of Jewish nationhood.. It has been revived recently in a variety of approaches, from linguistics (Paul Wexler). to historiography (Shlomo Sand). and population genetics (Eran Elhaik).. In broad academic perspective, both the idea that the Khazars converted en masse to Judaism, and the suggestion that they emigrated to form the core population of Ashkenazi Jewry, remain highly polemical issues.. In June 2014, Shaul Stampfer published a paper challenging the Khazar hypothesis as ungrounded in sources contemporary with the Khazar period, stating: \\"Such a conversion, even though it’s a wonderful story, never happened\\".Shaul Stampfer, \\"Did the Khazars Convert to Judaism?,\\" Jewish Social Studies: History, Culture, Society 19 (3) pp.1–72 Genetics and the Khazar theory Before modern DNA population genetics entered the field, Raphael Patai described the Khazars in racial terms as being a Turkic people with some Mongoloid admixture. After major advances in DNA sequence analysis and computing technology in the late 20th and early 21st century, a plethora of genetic research on Jewish and other human populations has been conducted worldwide. The Yiddish scholar Alexander Beider regards genetic studies as often offering contradictory information, further complicated by the fact that some researchers' work is influenced by personal views.Alexander Beider, Origins of Yiddish Dialects, Oxford University Press, 2015 p.553:’Unfortunately, genetic studies on Ashkenazi Jews, numerous since the 1990s, often provide contradictory information. Related methodological issues are huge: no access to the genetic pool of populations who lived centuries before us, the possibility of the genetic variation related to national selection, etc. To these objective problems one should add striking subjective elements: for certain authors, the way they proceed in their investigation and their interpretation of obtained results are clearly skewed by their political and/or religious feelings.' According to Martin B. Richards, presently available genetic studies, including his own study on Ashkenazi maternal lineages, all refute the Khazar theory. The claim that Ashkenazis as a whole take their origin from Khazars has been widely criticized as there is no direct evidence to support it.Melissa Hogenboom, 'European link to Jewish maternal ancestry BBC News, 9 October 2013. Using four Jewish groups, one being Ashkenazi, Kopelman et al found no evidence for the Khazar theory. While the consensus in genetic research is that the world's Jewish populations (including the Ashkenazim) share substantial genetic ancestry derived from a common Ancient Middle Eastern founder population, and that Ashkenazi Jews have no genetic ancestry attributable to Khazars, at least one study authored in this period diverges from the majority view in favor of the Khazar theory. Counter-evidence exists to the Khazar hypothesis claiming that the male lineages of Ashkenazi Jews originate from an ancient (2000 BCE - 700 BCE) population of the Middle East who spread to Europe. DNA studies of Ashkenazi Jews conclude that their male lineages were founded by ancestors from the Middle East, that they share this paternal ancestry with Sephardic Jewish populations, and that they bear their strongest resemblance to the peoples of the Fertile Crescent. Some evidence suggests a close relationship of Jewish patrilineages (including those of the Ashkenazi, Sephardi, Iraqi and Moroccan Jews) with those of the Samaritans, with some lineages sharing a common ancestry projected to the time of the Assyrian conquest of the kingdom of Israel. , Hum Mutat 24:248–260, 2004. A study of Ashkenazi mitochondrial DNA by a team led by Martin B. Richards of the University of Huddersfield found no maternal lineages attributable to the Caucasus. Richards summarized the findings on the female line as such: Nebel study In 2001 Nebel et al., summarizing studies that reported a low-level European gene flow contributing to Ashkenazi paternal gene pool, suggested this influence might be reflected in the Eu 19 chromosomes common in Eastern Europe, or otherwise, that Ashkenazim with this component might descend from Khazars, an hypothesis the authors found \\"attractive\\".Almut Nebel, Dvora Filon, Bernd Brinkmann, Partha P. Majumder, Marina Faerman, and Ariella Oppenheim. \\" 'The Y Chromosome Pool of Jews as Part of the Genetic Landscape of the Middle East.' The American Journal of Human Genetics 69:5 (November 2001): 1095-1112. They hypothesized that these chromosomes could reflect low-level gene flow from surrounding Eastern European populations, or, alternatively, that both the Ashkenazi Jews with R1a1a (R-M17), and to a much greater extent Eastern European populations in general, might partly be descendants of Khazars. They concluded \\"However, if the R1a1a (R-M17) chromosomes in Ashkenazi Jews do indeed represent the vestiges of the mysterious Khazars then, according to our data, this contribution was limited to either a single founder or a few closely related men, and does not exceed ~12% of the present-day Ashkenazim.\\". Behar et al.studies In 2003 Behar, remarking on the high frequency haplogroup R1a1 NRYs in that former Khazar sphere of influence and noting Paul Wexler's theory of relexification, raised the possibility that the Khazar theory might offer an attractive source for a small component of eastern Ashkenazic paternal lineages. In 2008 David Goldstein asserted that a Khazar connection \\"now seems to me plausible, if not likely\\". A 2013 study by Rootsi, Behar et al. of Ashkenazi Levites (who comprise 4% of the Jewish male population) found a high frequency of haplogroup R1a-M582 among them (64.9% of Ashkenazi Levites) pointing to a founding event and paternal ancestor common to half of them. Since R1a shows high frequency in Eastern Europe generally, it was thought possible, that the evidence might indicate the founder was a non-Jewish European. Testing the 3 hypotheses of a European, a Near Eastern or a Khazarian origin, their data excluded both the European and Khazarian origin of a Levite founder since they found no evidence of R1a-M582 Y-chromosomes was found in either group, other than singletons, while it occurs with significant frequency in Near Eastern regions Iranian Kerman, Iranian Azeri, the Kurds from Cilician Anatolia and Kazakhstan, and among Ashkenazi and non-Ashkenazi Jews. R1a-M582 was not detected among data from Iraqi, Bedouins, Druze and Palestinians sampled in Israel.Rootsi, Behar et al., 'Phylogenetic applications of whole Y-chromosome sequences and the Near Eastern origin of Ashkenazi Levites,' Natures Communications 17 December 2013 Faerman (2008) states that \\"External low-level gene flow of possible Eastern European origin has been shown in Ashkenazim but no evidence of a hypothetical Khazars' contribution to the Ashkenazi gene pool has ever been found.\\". A 2017 study by Behar, concentrating on the Ashkenazi Levites (themselves about where the proportion reaches 50%), while signalling that there's a \\"rich variation of haplogroup R1a outside of Europe which is phylogenetically separate from the typically European R1a branches\\", precises that the particular R1a-Y2619 sub- clade testifies for a local origin, and that the \\"Middle Eastern origin of the Ashkenazi Levite lineage based on what was previously a relatively limited number of reported samples, can now be considered firmly validated.\\" Elhaik et al. studies Eran Elhaik has argued, in two separate papers, the first in 2012 and the latest (2016) co-authored by Wexler, that his genetic analysis strengthens the Khazar hypothesis. Of the 2012 study Elhaik wrote: :\\"Strong evidence for the Khazarian hypothesis is the clustering of European Jews with the populations that in his opinion resided on opposite ends of ancient Khazaria: Armenians, Georgians, and Azerbaijani Jews. Because Caucasus populations remained relatively isolated in the Caucasus region and because there are no records of Caucasus populations mass-migrating to Eastern and Central Europe prior to the fall of Khazaria (Balanovsky et al. 2011), these findings imply a shared origin for European Jews and Caucasus populations.\\" In the 2016 study Das, Elhaik, Wexler et al. argued that the first Ashkenazi populations to speak the Yiddish language came from areas near four villages in Eastern Turkey along the Silk Road whose names derived from the word \\"Ashkenaz,\\" rather than from Germanic lands as is the general consensus in scholarship. Elhaik and Wexler proposed a variant for the canonical Khazarian hypothesis, proposing that Iranians, Greeks, Turks, and Slavs converted to Judaism in Anatolia prior to migrating to Khazaria where a small-scale conversion had already occurred. The historian Bernard Spolsky commenting on Elhaik's earlier study wrote. “Recently, Elhaik (2013) claims to have found evidence supporting the Khazarian origin of Ashkenazim, but the whole issue of genetic evidence remains uncertain.”. In 2018, Elhaik stated that the Ashkenazi maternal line is European and that only 3% of Ashkenazi DNA shows links with the Eastern Mediterranean/Middle East, a 'minuscule' amount comparable to the proportion of Neanderthal genes in modern European populations. For Elhaik, the vehicle by which unique Asiatic variations on Ashkenazi Y-chromosomes occurred, with Haplogroup Q-L275,Oleg Balanovsky, Vladimir Gurianov, Valery Zaporozhchenko, et al., Phylogeography of human Y-chromosome haplogroup Q3-L275 from an academic/citizen science collaboration BMC Evolutionary Biology 2017 17 (Suppl 1):18:'One of these branches, Haplogroup Q-L275, was acquired by a population ancestral to Ashkenazi Jews and grew within this population during the 1st millennium AD, reaching up to 5% in present day Ashkenazi. . . In Europe there are at least two branches: one in Dutch and Germans, and another in Ashkenazi Jews. These branches split from a common root 3000+/-700 years ago (Table 2, Additional file 2: Table S1): before the Jewish migration into Europe in Roman times [46]. Further screening in both Europe and the Levant is needed to determine whether the ancestors of the Ashkenazi acquired this lineage from the Levantine homeland or from the European host populations.' was the Ashina ruling clan of the Göktürks, who converted to Judaism and established the Khazar empire. 'Ashkenazic Jews’ mysterious origins unravelled by scientists thanks to ancient DNA,' The Conversation 5 September 5, 2018 =Criticism of the Elhaik studies= Elhaik's 2012 study proved highly controversial. Several noted geneticists, among them Marcus Feldman, Harry Ostrer, and Michael Hammer have maintained — and the view has gained widespread support among scientists — that the worldwide Jewish population is related and shares common roots in the Middle East, Feldman stated Elhaik's statistical analysis would not pass muster with most scientists; Hammer affirmed it was an outlier minority view without scientific support. Elhaik in reply described the group as ‘liars’ and ‘frauds’, noting Ostrer would not share genetic data that might be used ‘to defame the Jewish people’. Elhaik's PhD supervisor Dan Graur, likewise dismissed them as a ‘clique’, and said Elhaik is ‘combative’ which is what science itself is.Rita Rubin, ‘Jews a Race’ Genetic Theory Comes Under Fierce Attack by DNA Expert,' The Forward 7 May 2013 Elhaik's 2012 study was specifically criticized for its use of Armenians and Azerbaijani Jews as proxies for Khazars and for using Bedouin and Jordanian Hashemites as a proxy for the Ancient Israelites. The former decision was criticized because Armenians were assumed to have a monolithic Caucasian ancestry, when as an Anatolian people (rather than Turkic) they contain many genetically Middle Eastern elements. Azerbaijani Jews are also assumed for the purposes of the study to have Khazarian ancestry, when Mountain Jews are actually descended from Persian Jews. The decision to cast Bedouin/Hashemites as \\"proto-Jews\\" was especially seen as political in nature, considering that both have origins in Arab tribes from the Arabian Peninsula rather than from the Ancient Israelites, while the descent of the Jews from the Israelites is largely accepted.Terra Incognita: Return of the Khazar MythNo Evidence of Genome Wide Khazar Origin of Modern Jews The study was also criticized as interpreting information selectively—The study found far more genetic similarity between the Druze and Ashkenazim than the Ashkenazim and Armenians, but Elhaik rejected this as indicating a common Semitic origin, instead interpreting it as evidence of Druze having Turkic origins when they are known to come from Syria. Geneticists conducting studies in Jewish genetics have challenged Elhaik's methods in his first paper. Michael Hammer called Elhaik's premise \\"unrealistic,\\" calling Elhaik and other Khazarian hypothesis proponents \\"outlier folks… who have a minority view that’s not supported scientifically. I think the arguments they make are pretty weak and stretching what we know.\\" Marcus Feldman, director of Stanford University's Morrison Institute for Population and Resource Studies, echoes Hammer. \\"If you take all of the careful genetic population analysis that has been done over the last 15 years… there’s no doubt about the common Middle Eastern origin,\\" he said. He added that Elhaik's first paper \\"is sort of a one-off.\\" Elhaik's statistical analysis would not pass muster with most contemporary scholars, Feldman said: \\"He appears to be applying the statistics in a way that gives him different results from what everybody else has obtained from essentially similar data.\\" Rita Rubin, 'Jews a Race' Genetic Theory Comes Under Fierce Attack by DNA Expert,'. The Forward, 7 May 2013. Das, Elhaik and Wexler's 2016 study was challenged by two prominent scholars of Jewish demography from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. Shaul Stampfer, a professor of Soviet and East European Jewry, deemed it “basically nonsense.” Sergio DellaPergola, the primary demographer of the Jewish people at the university, called it a \\"falsification\\", criticizing its methodology, using a small population size and selectively removing population groups that refuted the findings they wanted, namely other Jewish groups such as the Italkim and Sephardic Jews, to whom Ashkenazi Jews are closely related genetically. “Serious research would have factored in the glaring genetic similarity between Sephardim and Ashkenazim, which mean Polish Jews are more genetically similar to Iraqi Jews than to a non-Jewish Pole.” The Yiddish scholar Marion Aptroot states \\"Seen from the standpoint of the humanities, certain aspects of the article by Das et al. fall short of established standards.\\" Elhaik replied that “studying the DNA of non-Ashkenazic Jews would not change the DNA of Ashkenazic Jews nor the predicted origin of their DNA.'.Prominent scholars blast theory tracing Ashkenazi Jews to Turkey Recently, a study by a team of biologists and linguists, led by Pavel Flegontov, a specialist in genomics, published a response to Das, Elhaik and Wexler's 2016 study, criticizing their methodology and conclusions. They argue that GPS works to allow inferences for the origins of modern populations with an unadmixed genome, but not for tracing ancestries back 1,000 years ago. In their view, the paper tried to fit Wexler's 'marginal and unsupported interpretation' of Yiddish into a model that only permits valid deductions for recent unadmixed populations. They also criticized the linguistic aspect of the study on the grounds that \\"all methods of historical linguistics concur that Yiddish is a Germanic language, with no reliable evidence for Slavic, Iranian, or Turkic substrata.\\" They further describe the purported \\"Slavo-Iranian confederation\\" as \\"a historically meaningless term invented by the authors under review.\\" Alexander Beider also takes issue with Elhaik's findings on linguistic grounds, similarly arguing that Yiddish onomastics lacks traces of a Turkic component. He concludes that theories of a Khazar connection are either speculative or simply wrong and \\"cannot be taken seriously.\\" Antisemitism=United Kingdom and United States Maurice Fishberg and Roland B. Dixon's works were later exploited in racist and religious polemical literature, by advocates of British Israelism, in both Britain and the United States.. Particularly after the publication of Burton J. Hendrick ‘s The Jews in America (1923). it began to enjoy a vogue among advocates of immigration restrictions in the 1920s; racial theorists:'Although the Khazar theory gets surprisingly little attention in scholarly histories of anti-Semitism, it has been an influential theme among American anti-Semites since the immigration restrictionists of the 1920s,'.. like Lothrop Stoddard; antisemitic conspiracy theorists like the Ku Klux Klan’s Hiram Wesley Evans; and anti-communist polemicists like John O. Beaty; . In 1938, Ezra Pound, then strongly identifying with the Fascist regime of Benito Mussolini, sent a query to fellow poet Louis Zukofsky concerning the Khazars after someone had written to him claiming that the ancient Jews had died out and that modern Jews were of Khazar descent. He returned to the issue in 1955, apparently influenced by a book called Facts are Facts, which pushed the Jewish-Khazar descent theory, and which for Pound had dug up \\"a few savoury morsels\\"., citing letterd of 10 July 1938 and 24/25 September 1955. Ahearn speculates that Pound may have thought:'If there were no such people as Jews, then the problem of indiscriminate anti-Semitism would disappear. On could focus one’s attention on usurers of whatever description.' The booklet in question, by a Roman Catholic convert from Rabbinic Judaism Benjamin H. Freedman was an anti- Semitic tirade written to David Goldstein after the latter had converted to Catholicism.. John O. Beaty was an antisemitic, McCarthyite professor of Old English at SMU, author of The Iron Curtain over America (Dallas 1952). According to him, \\"the Khazar Jews were responsible for all of America's – and the world's ills,\\" beginning with World War I. The book had little impact until the former Wall Street broker and oil tycoon J. Russell Maguire promoted it. A similar position was adopted by Wilmot Robertson, whose views influenced David Duke.. His Dispossessed Majority (1972) The British author Douglas Reed has also been influential. In his work the Ashkenazi are false Jews, descendants of the Khazars. A number of different variants of the theory came to be exploited by the Christian Identity movement.. The Christian Identity movement, which took shape from the 1940s to the 1970s, had its roots in British Israelism which had been planted on American evangelical soil in the late 19th century..'The formative period of Christian Identity could roughly be said to be the three decades between 1940 and 1970. Through missionaries like Wesley Swift, Bertrand Comparet and William Potter Gale, it took on a white racialist, anti-Semitic, anti-Communist and far-right conservative political outlook. Combined with the teachings of early disciples Richard G. Butler, Colonel Jack Mohr and James K. Warner, a distinctly racist theology was gradually formed. Whites were said to be the Adamic people, created in His likeness. A notion of a pre-earthly existence is found in an important substratum, teaching that whites either had a spiritual or extraterrestrial pre-existence. Blacks were either pre-Adamic soulless creatures or represented fallen, evil spirits, but they were not the chief target of fear and hatred. This position was reserved for Jews. The latent anti-Semitism found in British-Israelism rose to prominence. Jews were, at best, reduced to mongrelized imposters, not infrequently identified with Eurasian Khazars without any legitimate claim to a closeness with God, and at worst denounced as the offspring of Satan.' By the 1960s the Khazar ancestry theory was an article of faith in the Christian Identity movement. The Christian Identity movement has associated two verses from the New Testament, Revelation 2:9 and 3:9 with the Khazars. Jeffrey Kaplan calls these two passages the corner stone of Identity theology. He also reports that Christian Identity literature makes selective references to the Babylonian Talmud, while the works of Francis Parker Yockey and Arthur Koestler work are raised almost to the status of Holy Writ. Soviet Union and Russia The theory was prominent in Soviet antisemitism, gaining a place in Soviet historiography. The theory influenced Soviet historians including Boris Rybakov, Mikhail Artamonov and Lev Gumilyov and was used to support soviet political theory. Artamonov argued that the Khazars had played an important role in the development of Rus’. Rybakov disputed this view, instead regarding the Khazar state as parasitic. Official Soviet views on the Khazars hardened after December 1951 when Pravda published a critical review of Artamonov's work under the pen name P. Ivanov. Rybakov for his part denied that he was Ivanov. It has been speculated that Ivanov was in fact Stalin. In Ivanov's review the Khazars were regarded as parasites and enemies. Ivanov's views became the certified Soviet position. Lev Gumilyov's theory of ethnogenesis draws heavily on the Khazars theory. For Gumilyov ethnicity was defined by stereotypical behavior which was linked to adaption to the terrain. Jews, he regarded as a parasitic, international urban class. The Jews had dominated the Khazars creating a chimera, subjecting Rus’ to the \\"Khazar Yoke.\\" Since the 1970s the term Khazars has entered the Russian nationalist lexicon, it is used as a euphemism for Jews.. Vadim V. Kozhinov theorized that the Khazar Yoke was more dangerous to Rus´ than the Tatar Yoke. The Khazars were imagined as a persistent danger to Rus’. After the dissolution of the Soviet Union the theory maintained a role in Russian antisemitism. Contemporary Russian anti-Semites continue to perpetuate the Khazar myth. Gumilyov and his students work remain popular in Russia. “Khazars” and “ethnic chimera” have become preferred terms for antisemitic Russian chauvinists. Cults Aum Shinrikyo is a Japanese doomsday cult. The cult was active in Japan and Russia, with an estimated 10,000 and 30,000 followers respectively. The group's Manual of Fear used the Protocols of the Elders of Zion in addition to other antisemitic material. The manual claimed that the Jews are really Khazars intent on world domination. The Khazar theory has also become part of the Ascended Masters theology. Hatonn, an extraterrestrial, transmits messages including the complete text of The Protocols of the Elders of Zion. He identifies the authors of The Protocols as Khazars and speaks of false Zionist Jews who have usurped and controlled the true Jews.

The Australian tubeworm is an invasive species that dominates and alters habitats, reduces water quality, depletes resources, and causes biofouling. Taxonomy Ficopomatus enigmaticus is classified in the genus Ficopomatus in the family Serpulidae. They are polychaetes belonging to the order Canalipalpata, the bristle-footed or fan-head worms.Canalipalpata. BBC Nature Wildlife. The species was first described by the French zoologist Pierre Fauvel in 1923 as Mercierella enigmatica. Description Australian tubeworms are usually about long, and up to at times. On the front end are up to 20 branching gill plumes, which are gray, green, or brown in color. The worms secrete a calcareous tube around themselves, which reaches up to long by wide. The tubes are white and turn brown with age. They are flared at the opening and has flaring rings along their lengths. The mouth can be sealed with a spiny covering (the operculum). Australian tubeworms always live colonially, with many tubes growing together to form small clusters or large reefs. The aggregations are very dense. There can be up to 180,000 worms per square meter of reef, with the tube openings just about a millimeter apart. The tubes stick together with layers of tiny crystals. The tubes may weave together, and as new worms settle on the outer surface, the reef becomes a solid mass.Aliani, S., et al. (1995). Scanning electron microscope observations on the tube of the reef-forming serpulid Ficopomatus enigmaticus (Fauvel) (Annelida, Polychaeta). Italian Journal of Zoology 62(4), 363-67. Reefs of worms can be over long. When the invasion of Lake of Tunis in Tunisia was at its most severe, the total reef mass of the lagoon was thought to contain about 540,000 tons of carbonate.Dittmann, S., et al. Habitat requirements, distribution and colonisation of the tubeworm Ficopomatus enigmaticus in the Lower Lakes and Coorong. Report for the South Australian Murray-Darling Basin Natural Resources Management Board, Adelaide. November, 2009. In shallow water, a reef can be circular in shape as new worms settle along the outer edges. Neighboring reefs may join together to make platforms. In a current, the reef can be elongated. Biology Australian tubeworms are generally found in temperate and subtropical climates. They live in waters up to deep in habitat types such as estuaries and lagoons. They can tolerate a wide range of salinities, and can be found in marine and hypersaline environments, However, they are most common in brackish water. They are sensitive to wave action, and reefs usually grow in protected areas with slow-moving or stagnant water. The larvae are trochophores that drift with the zooplankton and settle onto the substrate after 20 to 25 days. They may build their tubes on established reefs or on beds of rock or shells, rocky or woody debris, reefs of other animals such as oysters, beds of vegetation, structures such as docks, piers, and marinas, or objects such as pilings and boats. On the coast of South Africa, Australian tubeworms have been observed growing on the aquatic plant Potamogeton pectinatus.Davies, B. R., et al. (1989). The filtration activity of a serpulid polychaete population (Ficopomatus enigmaticus (Fauvel) and its effects on water quality in a coastal marina. Estuarine, Coastal and Shelf Science 29(6), 613-20. In Argentina, the larvae settle on shells such as those of the sea snail Adelomelon brasiliana and the clams Mactra isabelleana and Tagelus plebeius. In the Black Sea the reefs are associated with barnacles of the genus Balanus, caridean shrimp of the genus Palaemon, mud crabs of the genus Xantho, amphipods of the genus Orchestia, and isopods of the genus Sphaeroma.Habitat: Pontic Ficopomatus enigmaticus reefs. European Environment Agency, EU. Some tubeworm reefs also have colonies of bryozoans built into them. They are filter feeders, gathering zooplankton, phytoplankton, and detritus particles from the water and transporting them to their mouths with the cilia on their gill plumes. During their larval stage, they feed on phytoplankton. They reproduce sexually, releasing eggs and sperm into the water during spawning. They are iteroparous, able to produce more than one batch of offspring. They are also protandric hermaphrodites, changing sex from males to females. The older, larger worms in a colony are generally female. Their lifespan is 4 to 8 years. As an invasive species A colony in a lagoon in Italy The Australian tubeworm is a fast-growing, aggressive species that acts as an ecosystem engineer, having drastic effects on many aspects of their environment. The worms alter the ecosystem physically, chemically, and biologically. The bulky reefs formed by large colonies of Australian tubeworms impede the movement of water, allowing sediment to build up around them.Schwindt, E., et al. (2001). Invasion of a reef-builder polychaete: direct and indirect impacts on the native benthic community structure. Biological Invasions 3, 137-49. They decrease the aesthetic value of natural lagoons, encrust the hulls of ships, clog the intakes of power plants, pose a hazard to people engaging in water recreation, and block mechanical structures such as locks. They are important biofouling organisms, forming heavy crusts on any suitable surface. Unclogging of pipes and cleaning of boats and harbor structures is costly. Australian tubeworms easily dominate ecosystems and outcompete native fauna when colonies deplete nutrients with large-scale filter feeding. They can also survive in polluted and eutrophic, low-oxygen waters that other organisms cannot tolerate as well. They can provide surfaces for the growth of other introduced species, such as the hydrozoan Cordylophora caspia and the barnacle Balanus improvisus. They can also facilitate the overgrowth of algae. In sewage-polluted waters they can thrive on the organic particles, creating large colonies that become covered in algae, further decreasing the water quality. They are known to form colonies on the shells of living animals, such as turtles, molluscs, and crabs. Some of the effects of the tubeworm are initially positive. Their efficient filter feeding clears the water of particles, increasing oxygen. They increase species richness and animal abundance by providing shelter and improved water quality. The microfauna increase. Larger populations of life forms attract detritivores. Reefs are used as resting spots by birds such as swans. Positive effects of the worm can be outweighed by their dominance of the ecosystem. As they feed, they can deplete resources, and by doing so they have been known to replace native species in the habitat. They shelter and support other introduced species. Even when they benefit native species, the outcome can be detrimental. For example, in Argentina the reefs are inhabited by the omnivorous native crab Cyrtograpsus angulatus, which forms dense populations once established. They then prey heavily on many other species. They also increase turbidity and alter the substrate with their burrowing activity. Australian tubeworms are introduced to new habitat when they are transported on ship hulls, in ballasts, and on shells. Management options are mainly limited to the prevention of new introductions. Methods include deoxygenating ballast water to kill larvae and simply scraping the tubes off of ships and other surfaces.

Situated about east of Derby and about north of Looma in the Kimberley region, it is between the Meda and Lennard Rivers. The country is well timbered with open grassy plains. A neighbouring property is Kimberley Downs Station. The property occupies an area of and supports a herd of approximately 25,000 Brahman cattle. It is owned by the Jumbuck Pastoral Company and has been managed by Troy Haslet since 2015. The property was established prior to 1883; a station employee, Henry Thomas Best, died on Meda that year. By 1885 the property was owned by Messrs Marmion and Co. and was hit by severe flooding. Over 1,300 sheep were lost from the property during a cyclone that swept through the area. In 1891 shearing produced 100 bales of wool. Record flooding hit the area in 1894 following a cyclone. The station manager reported to Marmion that another 1,300 sheep had been lost from the property. Fifteen Aborigines and an estimated 20,000 sheep were drowned during the floods, which left miles of country underwater. Meda was placed on the market for auction in 1897 and advertised as occupying an area of and being stocked with 8,900 sheep and 9 horses. It sold at the reserve price of £5,000 to William Silas Pearse. The following year all of the stock was sold off from the property; a total of 6,400 sheep were advertised for sale. Stock and horses in yards at Meda Station in 1915 The property was acquired by the Emanuel brothers after 1897; the Emanuels were in business with Pearse and together they owned some of leases in the Kimberley. In 1908 all of the squatters were under fire as being part of a \\"meat ring\\", a virtual monopoly of the meat trade in Western Australia. Meda experienced a heavy rainfall event in 1914 with of rain recorded in one fall. Widespread flooding followed with miles of fencing being washed away at Meda. The following year the property was carrying approximately 33,000 head of cattle. In 1943 the station manager, Gordon Harold Smith, was killed at Meda while mustering cattle. His horse fell and Smith received fatal injuries as a result. Heavy rainfall was again recorded in 1945 with another downpour, which arrived shortly after a dry spell. In the 1970s approximately from the station were excised by the Lands Department of Western Australia. The land was to be regenerated following land degradation from overstocking. In 1978 the Institute of Ecotechnics acquired the lease known as Birdwood Downs, commencing land care work and offering tourist accommodation shortly afterward.

The wasp is native to Central and South America. It is a very large yellow and brown paper wasp that establishes small colonies which build nests under the eaves of buildings or suspended from branches. The colonies are founded by solitary queens. Not all nests have a female with developed ovaries. Foraging adults bring nectar and macerated prey back to the nest to feed to the developing larvae which are individually housed in separate cells in the nest. It has mandibles with teeth. Taxonomy In 1768 the HMS Endeavour left Plymouth on the first voyage of James Cook, reaching the harbour of Rio de Janeiro a few months later, in November. Here one of the passengers, the wealthy naturalist Joseph Banks, procured a female specimen of giant wasp, which made its way around the world to eventually arrive in England in 1771. Meanwhile, the Dane Johan Christian Fabricius had travelled to Uppsala University in 1762 to study under the celebrated Carolus Linnæus, and upon returning to Denmark two years later began to work on his first publication, the Systema Entomologiæ, in which he attempted to list all known species of insects (which included spiders, crabs and other arthropods at the time) according to the new Linnaean system. By 1770 he had been appointed professor at the University of Copenhagen, and when in 1773 the University of Kiel (now German) had been ceded to Denmark, he was soon appointed professor there. By 1771 Fabricius began making yearly summer trips to London to study the collections that Banks and others had made in foreign lands, where he was able to study Banks' Brazilian specimen of wasp at Banks' London residence. In 1775 the 832 pages of the Systema Entomologiæ were finally published, and in this Polistes carnifex was scientifically described for the first time under the name Vespa carnifex, using Banks' specimen as holotype. This specimen is now stored at the Natural History Museum, London. In 1802 Pierre André Latreille created the genus Polistes, and in 1804 Fabricius moved this species from Vespa to the new genus. The authority citation of the species has erroneously been attributed to Henri Louis Frédéric de Saussure, who wrote some of the most important books on the subject of wasps. In 1853 de Saussure recognised that numerous taxa which had been described by others were synonyms of this species, and synonymised P. onerata, P. rufipennis, P. transverso-strigata and P. valida with P. carnifex. He also synonymised P. chlorostoma and P. major to it, although both are now recognised as valid species. Supergeneric classification The genus Polistes is the largest genus in the family Vespidae and the only genus in the tribe Polistini.Jackson, Morgan. (2012-10-26). Taxonomic adventures in the world of paper wasps (Polistes, Vespidae). [Web log comment]. It is classified in the Polistinae, the paper wasps. Subgeneric classification Owain Richards in 1973, and again in 1978, classified P. carnifex in a monotypic subgenus he named Onerarius. In a 1996 morphological study of most of the genus Polistes, James Michael Carpenter found this subgenus to cause the subgenus Aphanilopterus to be paraphyletic, and therefore synonymised Onerarius with the subgenus Aphanilopterus. However, by 2018 he no longer followed his own taxonomic interpretation and continued to use Richards' Onerarius. In 1857 de Saussure was the first to attempt to organise the American Polistes species, doing so on the basis of the form of the abdomen -either conical, with the first segment broad, and tapering to a compressed last segment, with a conical and somewhat elongated metathorax; or with the abdomen oval-shaped, the first segment ampulliform (shaped like a flask) and the metathorax more flat and its end less elongated. He placed P. carnifex in a third group with characteristics in between these two, together with P. aurifer and a new species he described from Nuevo México (a Mexican territory which had recently been conquered and annexed by the USA and at the time included everything in between modern California to east Texas), P. comanchus. Among the species of Polistes which occur in Pará, Adolpho Ducke groups it with P. canadensis, P. goeldii and P. versicolor, based on the morphology of the mesopleuron. One of the hypothesized phylogenetic trees puts P. carnifex most closely related to P. major and more distantly related to the following species: P. apachus, P. aurifer, P. bellicosus, P. carolina, P. metricus, P. poeyi ssp. haitiensis and P. perplexus. However, there has not been a consensus with regard to the phylogeny of P. carnifex so no one phylogenetic tree can be termed correct. Subspecies The following three subspecies are accepted: *Polistes carnifex ssp. carnifex - found in eastern Brazil, Costa Rica, Mexico and the USA. *Polistes carnifex ssp. boliviensis Bequaert, 1936 - found in Colombia, Peru and Bolivia. *Polistes carnifex ssp. rufipennis (Latreille, 1833) - found in Honduras, Panama and Venezuela. Polistes carnifex ssp. carnifex - in situ feeding in Mazatlán, Sinaloa, Mexico The holotype of P. carnifex ssp. boliviensis was collected by José Steinbach somewhere in Santa Cruz Department, Bolivia. It and three paratypes from Bolivia and Peru are stored in the Museum of Comparative Zoology, Harvard University. P. carnifex ssp. rufipennis was originally described as P. rufipennis by Pierre André Latreille from a collection made by Alexander von Humboldt and Aimé Bonpland during their celebrated journey of scientific exploration to the Americas. The single female specimen (the holotype) was collected somewhere in Venezuela. It was synonymised with this species by de Saussure in 1853. See the section \\"Description\\" below for more on this subspecies. Etymology The etymology of the specific epithet carnifex is from the Latin language, where it means an 'executioner' or a 'hangman', with the implied meanings of 'tormentor' or 'murderer', with the word used as an insult in the sense of 'scoundrel', 'villain' or 'rascal'. The Latin word carnis, meaning 'meat', combined with the genitive plural suffix -fex, derived from the word facio, and meaning '-maker' (among a number of similar concepts), together give 'flesh-maker'. (Carnifex : Butcher) Common names In Paraguay, in the Guaraní language, it is usually known as kava mainomby, less commonly as kava sa'yju or kava alazán. This last name is shared by other species of wasp in Paraguay. In English kava mainomby translates as 'hummingbird wasp', which is in reference to its great size. In 2018, YouTube personality Coyote Peterson popularized the name \\"executioner wasp\\" for this creature,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HyHZsa79LU \\"STUNG by an EXECUTIONER WASP!\\" - Nathaniel \\"Coyote\\" Peterson / Brave Wilderness on YouTube a translation of its scientific name he took from an online resourcehttps://www.americaninsects.net/hy/polistes-carnifex.html American Insects - Polistes carnifex (Executioner wasp). Description Polistes carnifex - in situ in Belize Polistes carnifex is the largest Neotropical wasp in the genus Polistes with a body length up to three centimetres. The normal size is 24-27mm, with a possible maximum of 33mm. Despite its size, it is a relatively non-aggressive insect. It is colored yellow with some brown stripes, these are partially blackish. The antennae are yellow with a darkened base. The head is yellow, the crown of the head being black and ending with reddish-brown stripes. The maxillae are reddish-brown, outlined in black. The thorax is yellow, the dorsal part black, but with a quartet of dark reddish- brown spots. The pronotum is totally or almost totally colored yellow. The abdomen is yellow, the second segment (tergite) darkened at the base. The wings are reddish-brown, or yellowish reddish-brown, and the feet are dark- colored. It can be grouped with a number of species which can be distinguished from other species within the genus Polistes by their lacking of a groove on the underside of its head called the epicnemial sulcus. P. carnifex can be distinguished among this group of wasps by its wide cheek plates. Also the first tergite is very compact, dorsally convex, and elevated vertically compared to the constriction where the abdomen is inserted into the thorax. Furthermore, the eyes do not touch the clypeus. Lastly, this is a very large wasp, with individuals always longer than 20mm. The first gastral segment (sternite) is less broad than long. Ducke states that the nests, with their relatively long and strong central petiole, are characteristic for the species, at least among the species in the genus of which the nest was known in his time. P. carnifex ssp. rufipennis appears to differ from the nominate type by the body and wings being colored a tan brown, almost chestnut. Latreille describes it as such, with the antennas and the last quarter of the tarsi being more yellowish. It is yellow above the jaws, the posterior (back) edge of the first segment of the thorax, the very end of the thorax, the area beyond the second scutellum, the posterior edges of the first three rings (tergites + sternites) of the abdomen and the entirety of the following ring, this yellow being in the form of bands on the front rings, and forming two large, united patches which extend laterally to the extreme end of the thorax. A part of the inferior and anterior sides, the outline of the scutellum, and the square segment above that which Latreille calls the \\"second scutellum\\" are a similar color, but fainter. The abdomen and wings are glossy. The length of the body of the creature is 26mm.  Mandibles  As a member of the order Hymenoptera, Polistes carnifex has mandibles, which may be used to obtain wood fibers, build nests, or capture and macerate prey.Murtfeldt, Mary, E. (1891). Outlines of Entomology: Prepared for the use of farmers and horticulturists. Kirkwood, MO: Mary E. Murtfeldt. The mandibles of P. carnifex are short. Yet, they are markedly wide at their base, with a length to basal width ratio of approximately 2:1. An external basal area stretches \\"from the basal margin ... to a point situated about half-way the mandible's length.\\" P. carnifex also have teeth. \\"A convex distal posterior area ... is continuous with the posterior-most apical tooth and stays adjacent to a distal media area\\". This area is convex in P. carnifex. In P. carnifex, the third tooth's anterior edge is elongated, compared to in other species. Genitals Like most insects, the genitals of this species are very characteristic. The male wasp has a paramere that is two and a half times as long as wide at the middle, with the parameral spine about 1/6th of the length, and a shallow groove at its side. This spine is covered in very long and dense bristles and pointed apically. The paramere lobe is well developed and rounded, the lower part of the paramere is narrow, about 2/3 the width at the middle part. It has a slender aedeagus, with about 27 teeth distributed from the end to beginning of the expansion in the middle part of the aedeagus. The penis valve is weakly dilated, with a central entrance and a weakly bi-lobed appearance (the valve being a little more than 1/3 of the length of apical part of the aedeagus). The expansion of the middle part of the aedeagus is well developed and has a pointed apex. The lateral apodeme of the aedeagus is directed forward with a weak central projection and shorter than the rounded ventral process (projection), while the inferior (lower) portion of the aedeagus is weakly curved -appearing almost straight from the side. The digitus is slender, with a well-developed apical process which is about one and a half times longer than the base of the digitus and the same width from the base to the end. This end (apex) is pointed. The digitus has a band of obvious punctation around its base, and an anteroventral lobe that is short with a rounded end, and is covered in easily rubbed off (evanescent) bristles. The cuspis is slender, with an apex which is pointed and tapers abruptly, and covered in long and sparse bristles, with more bristles found at the edges of the sides, and with short bristles on the lower part. The punctation on the cuspis is only found on the lateral lobe. Similar species In Paraguay, according to the identification key provided by Bolívar Rafael Garcete-Barrett, the most similar species are P. cavapyta, which has a completely yellow head and is banded with a rusty orange color, P. lanio, which has extensive black coloration on the mesosoma (~thorax) and back of the metasoma (~abdomen), P. canadensis, which has a red metasoma except some black in the sutures between the plates of the exoskeleton. The much smaller P. major is the only species in Paraguay with a similar color pattern. In Nicaragua, according to the key provided by Jean-Michel Maes, it is best distinguished from the most similar species of the region, P. major, by its wide cheek plates, and the male genitals of both species are furthermore very characteristic. In Brazil, Ducke compares it to P. claripennis, which has a similar coloration, but with a more pale yellow. This species is much smaller and lacks the wide cheeks of P. carnifex. According to Joseph Charles Bequaert in 1936, many of the specimens labelled as P. carnifex in collections are P. major, these two species being commonly confused. All published records from Cuba and Hispaniola are P. major. See for example the description by William J. Fox of a specimen collected on San Esteban Island in the Gulf of California, Mexico. Distribution Polistes carnifex is native to Central and South America; its range extends from Arizona and southern Texas to Misiones Province in northern Argentina. In 1907 Ducke stated the species occurred in the Greater Antilles, but according to Bequaert in 1936, the species does not occur in the United States nor the Greater Antilles. In 1940 he was proven wrong however, when the first specimen from the United States was collected in Arizona by John J. duBois, this record first being published in 1955. In Brazil it has been found in the states of Rio de Janeiro, Pará and Paraná. In Mexico it has been recorded in the states of Baja California, Jalisco, Morelos, Nayarit, Oaxaca, Sinaloa, Sonora, Veracruz and Yucatan, as well as Mexico City. In Paraguay it is found in the departments of Alto Paraná, Canindeyú, Paraguarí and San Pedro. Bequaert states the species is not common anywhere. Ducke also states it is infrequently seen in Pará, Brazil. Ecology=Habitat The species is found in coastal, humid, and open areas, such as in evergreen tropical forests. In tropical zones like Paraguay, Brazil and Argentina it is found in extensive wooded habitats without heavy rains. Behavior Before the 1970s little was known of the biology or behavior of Polistes carnifex. P. carnifex is a species of paper wasp, thus, like other members of the subfamily Polistinae, it is an eusocial wasp. =Nests= The nest is founded by a solitary queen which builds first cell and then further cells from macerated pulpy material. To create a colony, the queen enlarges a cell by introducing a ball of recently macerated pulp on her own. Using her mandibles, the queen loads the ball while holding the sides of the wall being constructed with her foretarsi. While completing this task, the queen moves her antennae in circles about her head, touching the parallel-lying opposite wall. The antennae-wall contact allows the queen to construct straight sides on the inner wall. She lays eggs and feeds the larvae, feeding them nectar and macerated prey. The female workers that emerge from the first cells then assist with the further building and development of the colony, and can themselves mate and lay eggs. Polistes carnifex nest collected in Brazil in 1967 by William Donald Hamilton and stored at the Natural History Museum, London Polistes carnifex is a social species and the nests consist of a number of horizontal papery cells in which the young are reared. The nests are built from wood pulp which the wasps chew into a plaster. In a study in Costa Rica, nests were found hanging from branches of various species of low thorny trees near an ephemeral swamp. Nests have been seen under the eaves of buildings.de Roux, Juan Manuel (26 August 2012) at iNaturalist.org (2020). iNaturalist Research-grade Observations. Occurrence dataset https://doi.org/10.15468/ab3s5x accessed via GBIF.org on 2020-01-11. https://www.gbif.org/occurrence/1913162534 The nests are hanging and open-faced, supported by a single Petiole in the centre which is strengthened by a tough gelatinous material. Of the six nests measured by Corn, the maximum size for a nest of P. carnifex was approximately 9 cm in diameter. One nest in which one emergence at minimum occurred had an average length of 27.8 mm. Nests range in the adult population from 4 to 13 individuals. In one nest studied, there were 28 cells and this number remained constant for the duration of the observation (17 days). There was only one cell observed as being enlarged, which was on the periphery. =Reproduction= Of six nests examined in 1972 not all nests contained a female with \\"well-developed ovaries\\". =Feeding= Polistes carnifex feeding on Cissus sp. in situ in Mazatlán, Sinaloa, Mexico The English naturalist Thomas Belt observed how a Polistes carnifex wasp which had found a large caterpillar, chewed it up and made half of it into a macerated ball. Picking this up, it hovered for a few seconds and then circled several times round the place among the dense foliage where the other half of the caterpillar lay. It then flew off but returned a couple of minutes later and quickly located the correct hole among the leaves. Making its way in among the foliage, it could not at first find the exact leaf on which the caterpillar lay. After several fruitless hunts interspersed with short circling flights, it finally located the dismembered prey and flew off with its trophy. Belt marvelled that the insect could use a mental process so similar to that a human might have used to remember the specific location of its prey. In Colombia, twenty-nine foraging wasps were observed returning to a particular nest with twenty-five loads of nectar, three loads of macerated prey and one of nest-building pulp. When a foraging wasp arrived, the highest ranking wasp present demanded food and then both fed the larvae. Each wasp pushed its head into a cell, drummed on the cell walls with its antennae and then deposited the food. The drumming noise could be heard a meter away by the researcher, and may have alerted the larvae to the presence of food. Interactions within the speciesWorker policing= As a member of the order hymenoptera, Polistes carnifex is subject to worker policing. While the diploid female workers do not mate, they are able to lay unfertilized eggs that will develop into haploid males. The relatedness of a worker to her offspring is r=0.5, and her relatedness to the queen's sons is r=0.25. Similarly, the queen's relatedness to her own offspring is r=0.5, whereas the queen's relatedness to her workers' sons is r=0.25, thus the queen prefers to bear her own sons. The other workers are more closely related to the queen's offspring than to their sisters' offspring. The consequences of these differences is as follows: queens try to suppress the production of eggs by workers and workers have an incentive to suppress other workers from producing eggs. This phenomenon is known as \\"worker policing\\".Davies, Nicholas, B., Krebs, John, R., and West, Stuart, A. (2012). Chapter 13: Altruism and Conflict in the Social Insects, An Introduction to Behavioral Ecology (360–393). West Sussex, U.K.: Blackwell Science Ltd. =Territorial behavior= In Costa Rica, male Polistes carnifex congregate on the top of ridges where they maintain territories. The males chase away other conspecific males from these territories which consist of groups of trees and shrubs with no nests. It is suggested that females only mate with males occupying such territories. Interactions with other species Nests (hanging from low branches on thorny trees near a swamp) were sometimes found within about a meter of nests of a Polybia species and occasionally in similar close proximity to a Mischocyttarus nest. Polybia and Mischocyttarus are often associated in the same area; however, Polistes carnifex only occasionally was found in proximity. The association of P. carnifex with other species of social wasps has not been reported outside of Costa Rica. Some trees bore several nests of different wasp species while many other similar trees bore none, which suggests that there is a non-random distribution. The species P. major appears to be a Batesian mimic of this species. = Parasites = In a study of six nests of Polistes carnifex, in three cells there was an additional egg instead of the usual one, but these eggs appeared to be of P. carnifex. The author of this study found no evidence of parasitism, however, the wasps are indeed parasitized by strepsipteran insects in the genus Xenos. These obligate parasites infect the developing wasp larvae in the nest and are present within the abdomens of female wasps when they hatch out. Here they remain until they thrust through the cuticle and pupate (males) or release infective first-instar larvae onto flowers (females). These larvae are transported back to their nests by foraging wasps.  Sting  Although not a particularly aggressive wasp species, it has garnered a reputation in many Latin American countries for its potent sting. YouTube personality and wildlife educator Nathaniel \\"Coyote\\" Peterson, who has deliberately exposed himself to a variety of stinging insects for entertainment and educational purposes, was stung and declared the wasp’s sting to be the most painful one he had ever taken, more painful than that of the bullet ant or the Asian giant hornet. Peterson also said the sting can cause tissue necrosis around the site of the sting, saying, “My arm was swollen for days, and eventually a small hole rotted in my arm from the venom at the sting site.\\" Conservation The IUCN has not evaluated this species' conservation status. It has been recorded as present in the following protected areas: *Shipstern Conservation & Management Area, Belize.

Compiled by George Ebow Bonney, 2011, InstantPublisher.com, .\\"Captain James Tachie-Menson Music\\" , Tabbica.  Early life  Captain Tachie-Menson was born on 4 April 1928 in Cape Coast, Ghana. He completed his secondary education at Adisadel College in Cape Coast, and later proceeded to Liverpool, England, in 1951 under a programme initiated by the Gold Coast Railway and Harbor Authority for the training of Africans to become pilots and tug- masters.  Maritime career = Elder Dempster  Captain Tachie-Menson served in the British Merchant Navy from 1951 to 1960, on board various ships in the fleet of the Liverpool-based shipping company, Elder Dempster Lines, while simultaneously pursuing prescribed courses and maritime studies at the Liverpool Nautical College (now Maritime Academy at Liverpool John Moores University). He completed his four-year training as a Cadet on Elder Dempster's motor ship Macgregor Laird, and was quickly promoted through all the Navigational officer grades, from the rank of Third Mate to that of Chief Officer, on board various ships in Elder Dempster's fleet, including the Royal Mail and passenger liners, Accra, Apapa and MV Aureol, sailing regularly between Liverpool and the West Coast of Africa.  Master Mariner/Captain qualification  In 1960, Tachie-Menson acquired the British Board of Trade Certificate of Competency as Master Mariner, the qualification required for sailing as a captain on British ships as well as other commercial liners, giving him the distinction of being the first African south of the Sahara to be qualified to command a ship operating on international/trans-ocean voyages.Ghana Who’s Who, Bartels Publications (Ghana) Limited, 1972.  Black Star Line  Captain Tachie-Menson returned home to Ghana in 1960 on Elder Dempster’s passenger liner, Aureol. Later that year, in response to an urgent call on him by the chairman and the board of directors of Ghana’s rapidly expanding national shipping company, Black Star Line, which Dr. Kwame Nkrumah, the first President of Ghana, had formed soon after Ghana gained its independence from the United Kingdom, Captain Tachie-Menson joined the company. Shortly thereafter, he was appointed as captain of the S.S. Tano River, one of the four ships owned and operated by Black Star Line at the time, thereby becoming not only the first black African to ever be appointed to command a merchant navy ship, but also the first Ghanaian to become a Master Mariner and captain of a foreign-going vessel.West Africa, West Africa Publishing Company Limited, 1995, p. 1746.Shipbuilding and Shipping Record, Vol. 96, 1960, p. 166.Amissah, G.

Captain Tachie-Menson continued his career as a captain with the Black Star Line's Fleet for several years, trailblazing several voyages across the Atlantic Ocean and through the Baltic and North Seas on the Tano River and subsequently the Nasia River.Ghana Year Book, Graphic Corporation, 1962, p. 72.Ghana Today, Vol. 6, 1962. It was in his capacity as captain of these two ships that Tachie-Menson first gained recognition and reverence in the North American continent, especially by notable civil rights activists in the US.Nelson, Vonda Micheaux, No Crystal Stair: A Documentary Novel of the Life and Work of Lewis Michaux, Carolrhoda Books (first edn, 1 February 2012), pp. 98–99. ; .\\"'Captain of Ghana Ship Sees Sights During Brief Call Here'\\", The Bermuda Recorder, 8 July 1961. The Captain would later serve as chief superintendent of Black Star Line's marine office in London and, following his return to Ghana in the 1970s, became the managing director and CEO of Black Star Line.  Maritime organizations  Throughout his maritime career, Captain Tachie-Menson represented Ghana at several international maritime conferences, including the International Maritime Consultative Organization (IMCO) Loadline Conference of 1966, at which he proposed the extension of the Tropical Zone to incorporate the Canary Islands. That proposal, which was unanimously adopted, benefited the international maritime industry immensely by allowing ships to obtain maximum fuel in the Canary Islands, which in turn enabled them to travel further to ports in and beyond South Africa. Captain Tachie-Menson also served for approximately five years, as Chairman of the Association of African National Shipping Lines, was a leading member of the America-West Africa Freight Conference, and Principal of the United Kingdom- West Africa Lines Conference (UKWAL).  Presentation to Queen Elizabeth II  Notably, in July 1977, he was one of three shipping executives (from Ghana, Nigeria and the United Kingdom) who, with their wives, were presented to Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II at a special maritime ceremony in England during the celebration of the Queen’s Silver Jubilee Anniversary on the British throne.Oladitan, Oladipo, The Patriarch and the Crown, 1995, p. 118, , 9789783322806.  Nigerian National Shipping Line and Grundstad Maritime  In 1980, as a result of political instability in his native country, Ghana, Captain Tachie-Menson returned to England and back to sea as captain on various vessels initially in the fleet of the Nigerian National Shipping Line, and subsequently with the fleet of Grundstad Maritime Overseas, Inc., a company founded by his longtime friend and shipping colleague, Oddmund Grundstad. In this latter capacity, Captain Tachie-Menson commanded various vessels, including oil tankers that sailed through the Suez Canal, the Red Sea, the Indian Ocean, and the Persian Gulf, as well as ports on the coasts of East Africa, the Arabian Peninsula, South Africa, the United Kingdom, Spain, Turkey, the United States, South America, Yugoslavia and Algeria.  Crown Cruise Line  In 1984, when Grundstad decided to enter the Cruise Line market in the United States, he called upon his close friend Captain Tachie- Menson to head up the operations. Tachie-Menson moved to the United States, where he served first as Director of Operations for the newly formed Crown Cruise Line in the Port of San Diego in California, and, subsequently, as Port Captain, General Manager and Vice-President of the cruise line when it moved to the Port of Palm Beach in Florida.Crown Cruise Line#cite ref-1 There, he oversaw operations of the company’s cruise ships: Viking Princess, Crown Del Mar, Crown Monarch, Crown Jewel, and Crown Dynasty. He worked in this capacity until his retirement in the mid-1990s.  Musical compositions  In addition to his accomplishments in the maritime industry, Captain Tachie-Menson was also a renowned musician, composer, conductor, editor, arranger and producer of choral music. His original compositions, a number of which were written while he was at sea, are established hymns in many churches in Ghana, and have also been sung by choirs in the United Kingdom and the United States.Songs From Land & Sea, The Captain’s Book of Anthems; compiled by Prof. George E. Bonney, 2009 & 2011, InstantPublisher.com, (2009); (2011) His notable musical compositions include \\"Where is our God in whom we trust?\\", \\"The New Born Prince of Peace\\", \\"Afrehyia-Pa\\", and \\"He is still our God\\" (\\"Leonora\\"). The tune from another of his original works, \\"Willevlutt\\", has become the preferred tune for singing the hymn \\"Hark, hark my soul\\" in Ghanaian churches and by Ghanaian choirs in various parts of the world. His compositions while living in the United States include an Opus Magnum, \\"How Lovely is Thy Dwelling\\", which he was invited to compose in commemoration of the 25th anniversary of Reverend Canon Kerry Robb as Rector of St. Mark’s Episcopal Church in Palm Beach Gardens, where the Captain and his wife were members of the choir. Besides composing music, Captain Tachie-Menson, a staunch Anglican/Episcopalian, also served as organist and choirmaster at various Anglican churches in Accra, Takoradi and Tema, most prominently at St. Barnabas Church in Osu.  Personal  Captain Tachie-Menson lived in Jupiter, Florida, in the United States with his wife of 48 years, Veronica Tachie- Menson (née Hayford), until his death on 9 February 2014.\\"Captain James Hackman (J.H.)

She was the mother of Uttar, Uttara, Shveta, and Shankha. She had a younger brother named Kichaka and a brother-in-law named Sahtanika. Sudeshna was the daughter of Suta king Kekaya, and the queen Malavi. She had 106 brothers. In modern terminology the name has a meaning of well-born. Role in the Mahabhartha During the Pandavas' 13th year of exile, Sudeshna unknowingly plays host to the Pandavas and Draupadi. Draupadi poses as her maid, Sairandhri. Sudeshna is looking out her room window one day, and sees Draupadi wandering in the market. Stunned at her beauty, Sudeshna inquires afterwards. Draupadi poses as Sairandhri, saying that she is a former lady-in-waiting from Indraprastha, now without a job after the Pandvas had lost their kingdom. Suspicious of her story, since Sairandhri looks and carries herself like royalty, Sudeshna chastises herself for being so paranoid and hires Sairandhri. Sairandhri proves to be a loyal and efficient handmaiden. Sudeshna on the throne (left) is greeted by Draupadi and other ladies-in-waiting Kichaka notices Sairandhri and is overcome by her beauty and inquires Sudeshna about her. Sudeshna conveys Kichaka's interest to Sairandhri. Sairandhri rebukes Kichaka, telling her that she is already married to a Gandarva who would kill any man who touched her. Unable to deny her older brother, and wary of the king's warnings to not displease their city's top commander-in-chief, Sudeshna introduces Kichaka to Sairandhri. She does this by asking Sairandhri to fetch wine from Kichaka's house; she refuses to heed Sairandhri's warnings yet again. The moment Sairandhri arrives, Kichaka tries to molest her. Sairandhri looks to Sudeshna for aid, but the queen is silent. Later, when Kichaka dies under mysterious circumstances (actually killed by Bhima), Sudeshna becomes terrified and begs Sairandhri for forgiveness. Having seen her words come true, Sudeshna recognizes that Sairandhri is no ordinary woman. Believing that Sairandhri's words will become truthful, Sudeshna counsels her husband against punishing Sairandhri for Kichaka's death. When the Susarma and the Trigartas attack Matsya, Sudeshna sees her husband and the army off. Later, when the Kauravas attack from the other direction, she attempts to organize the city defenses only to find that few soldiers have remained. Her young son, Uttar, brags that he will single-handedly defeat the Kauravas, and gets ready to ride out. Knowing her son will be killed, Sudeshna tries to talk him down. Sairandhri chimes in that Uttar should take Brihannala (actually Arjuna in disguise) as his charioteer, saying that if Uttar did so, no harm would come to him. Uttar attempts to decline, not wanting to have his chariot in the hands of a woman. However, Sudeshna overrules him saying that if Sairandhri said it, it must be true. Thus, when Uttar faces the Kauravas, it is Arjuna who actually defeats all of them and prevents Uttar from dying and Matsya from falling. After the skirmish, the Pandavas reveal themselves. Sudeshna is horrified that Draupadi endured such treatment under her roof. However, Draupadi and the Pandavas quickly forgive them, thanking the royal pair for giving them shelter. Uttara is married to Arjuna's son, Abhimanyu. Virat immediately pledges to support the Pandavas' cause to regain their kingdom, and his army as well as Sudeshna's children fight with the Pandavas in the Kurukshetra war. On the first day, Sudeshna suffers loss her son killed. By the war's end, her husband, her children, and the entire Matsya army is wiped out in a Pandava victory. However, her grandson, Parikshit, becomes the new heir of a reunified Hastinapur. Sudeshna is present for Parikshit's birth. She is one of the ones who implores Krishna to work his magic and save her grandson (as he was stillborn).C.

In the film, Connie is portrayed by Talia Shire, the sister of the director Francis Ford Coppola. Shire was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress for her portrayal of Connie Corleone in The Godfather Part II.  The Godfather  Born in 1922, Connie is the youngest child and only daughter of Mafia don Vito Corleone and his wife Carmela. She is the sister of Sonny, Fredo and Michael Corleone. In 1945, she marries Sonny's friend Carlo Rizzi. Vito disapproves the match, and only agrees to the marriage on condition they have a traditional Sicilian wedding. Puzo characterizes Carlo as \\"a punk sore at the world\\", and his angry behavior is exacerbated by the Corleone family shunting him aside after marrying into the family. He physically abuses and cheats on Connie. On their wedding night, he blackens Connie's eye when she refuses to give up the bridal purse containing thousands of dollars in cash wedding gifts. Connie complains about Carlo's abuse to her family. Her brothers despise Carlo for mistreating their sister; Sonny is particularly enraged. Vito refuses to intervene and he strictly forbids anyone in the family from retaliating against Carlo. Connie is hurt and confused by this seeming indifference. Vito, however, is concerned, but feels powerless; Italian tradition forbids interfering in another person's marriage, and Vito worries his son-in-law will be unable to discharge his \\"duties as a husband\\" if he fears the family. Vito instead has Carlo secretly watched. This perceived inaction only emboldens Carlo to become more abusive. Sonny obeys his father's command not to interfere until he visits Connie and finds her sobbing and battered. Sonny severely beats Carlo in the street, threatening to kill him if he hurts Connie again. Rival mob boss Emilio Barzini recruits Carlo in a plot to murder Sonny. Carlo arranges for his mistress to call the apartment to provoke a fight with Connie. After Carlo severely beats Connie, she hysterically phones the Corleone compound. An enraged Sonny drives off alone to Connie's apartment, his bodyguards following in a separate car. At the causeway toll booth, Sonny is ambushed and killed by Barzini's Tommy gun-wielding men. Michael returns from Sicily and assumes Sonny's place as Vito's heir apparent. Following Vito's death, Michael becomes the new Don and avenges Sonny's murder by having Carlo garroted by caporegime Peter Clemenza, one part of a wave of murders orchestrated by Vito and Michael to eliminate their enemies. Connie, hysterical after Carlo's death, blames Michael, denouncing him in front of his wife, Kay. In the novel, Connie quickly recovers from Carlo's demise, apparently relieved to be rid of an abusive, philandering husband. Days later, she apologizes to Michael for her outburst and assures Kay that Michael is blameless. Kay initially believes both Connie and Michael, but later learns her husband did have Carlo killed, along with the other Mafia heads.  The Godfather Part II  In The Godfather Part II, set three years later, Connie is still angry at Michael, and has several meaningless affairs just to spite him. On the day of Michael's son Anthony's First Communion, she shows up at Michael's house and asks for money so she can marry Merle Johnson, a man Michael disapproves of. Michael refuses, and Connie storms off. At the end of the film, Connie returns for her mother's funeral and makes peace with Michael. She intercedes on Fredo's behalf after Michael disowns him for conspiring with Corleone rival Hyman Roth, pleading with Michael to forgive him. Michael publicly appears to forgive Fredo, but later has him killed. Connie later says that Fredo had drowned, feigning ignorance of the truth. After Michael and Kay divorce, Connie helps care for Michael's children. In a flashback at the end of the film, it is revealed that Sonny introduced her to Carlo in 1941 during Vito's birthday party.  The Godfather Part III  In The Godfather Part III, set 20 years later, Connie has become one of Michael's closest advisors. She encourages Michael to bring Sonny's illegitimate son Vincent Mancini into the Corleone family and support him in his feud with Joey Zasa. When Michael suffers a diabetic stroke following an attempt on his life, Connie and Michael's assassin Al Neri give Vincent the approval to kill Zasa, who was complicit in the attack. Michael is furious that she gave an order behind his back, but she maintains that it was necessary to strike fear into his enemies. Connie travels with the Corleone family to Palermo, Sicily to watch Anthony's operatic debut. She tells Vincent to prepare a counterattack if Michael is killed. She then stands at Michael's side when he retires and names Vincent his successor. She attends the opera, along with the entire Corleone family. On discovering that her godfather Don Altobello is the mastermind of the plot against their family, she kills him by giving him a gift of poisoned cannoli. Connie is distraught when her niece Mary is killed by an assassin who intended to kill Michael.  Character  Connie is Vito's only daughter and has been described as his favorite child, next to Michael. Connie attempts to have her family accept Carlo in the first film, and was, at least initially, devastated by his murder, despite the abuse he inflicted. Talia Shire described her character as \\"'a pain-in-the-ass, whiny person' in the shadow of all-powerful men.\\"  In other media  Connie appears as a supporting character in Mark Winegardner's sequel novels The Godfather Returns and The Godfather's Revenge.

Francis Talfourd Life He was the eldest son of Thomas Noon Talfourd, by his wife Rachel, eldest daughter of John Towill Rutt. He was educated at Eton College from 1841 to 1845, on 15 May in which year he matriculated from Christ Church, Oxford. At Oxford he, along with William Kirkpatrick Riland Bedford and several others, founded the Oxford Dramatic Amateurs. Talfourd was called to the bar at the Middle Temple on 17 November 1852, and occasionally went on the circuit. Talfourd died at Mentone on 9 March 1862, in his thirty-fourth year. Works Talfourd was known as the writer of a series of burlesques and extravaganzas. His first piece, Macbeth Travestie, was originally produced during the Henley Regatta on 17 June 1847, and then went to the Strand Theatre on 10 January 1848, and the Olympic Theatre on 25 April 1853. His light, ephemeral pieces were popular. They included: * Alcestis, the original Strong-minded Woman, a burlesque brought out on 4 July 1850; * The Rule of Three, a comedietta, 20 December 1858; * Tell and the Strike of the Cantons, 26 December 1859, an extravaganza, in which Marie Wilton played Albert, and Patty Oliver was Lisetta. These were at the Strand Theatre. At the Olympic he brought out Ganem, the Slave of Love, on 31 May 1852, and Shylock, or the Merchant of Venice preserved, on 4 July 1853, with Thomas Frederick Robson giving a tragi-comic representation of Shylock. For the Haymarket Theatre he wrote Pluto and Proserpine on 5 April 1858, and Electra, in a new Electric Light, on 25 April 1859, in which Maria Ternan was seen as Orestes. On 26 December 1854 he brought out at the St. James's Abou Hassan, or the Hunt after Happiness, in which John Laurence Toole made one of his early appearances. With Henry James Byron he collaborated in bringing out his last piece, The Miller and his Men, at the Strand Theatre on 9 April 1860. Family Talfourd married, on 5 November 1861, Frances Louisa Morgan, second daughter of Josiah Towne, a solicitor of Margate. Talfourd was an uncle of the archaeologist Talfourd Ely (1838–1923).

It was released by Young, Gifted & Broke on 1 May 2012. The album draws mainly from the genre of New Zealand hip hop, but is also jazz-influenced. Home Brew was promoted by a 48-hour-long release party and a six-show tour of New Zealand cities. The album was lauded by critics, and won the New Zealand Music Award for Best Urban/Hip Hop Album. It debuted top of the New Zealand Albums Chart. Content Home Brew is a New Zealand hip hop album with heavy jazz influences. It features keyboard instruments, horns, saxophones, guitars and bass. It is divided into two discs: Light and Dark. Light embraces welfare fraud (\\"Benefit\\"), alcoholism (\\"Alcoholic\\") and using datura as a recreational drug (\\"Datura/White Flowers\\"). \\"Basketball Court\\" and \\"Radio\\" are about nostalgia and memories. Dark includes \\"State of Mind\\", on which band member Tom Scott reflects on his father's time in prison, and \\"The Truth is Ugly\\", where he discusses his shortcomings in past romantic relationships. \\"Listen to Us\\" criticises the government. Thirty-three songs were recorded for the album; twenty-one made the final cut. Release and promotion Home Brew was released in New Zealand and Australia by the independent record label Young, Gifted & Broke on 1 May 2012. A 48-hour-long launch party titled Home Brew Speakeasy was held from 5 May to 7 May at Shooters Saloon in Kingsland, Auckland; tickets included a copy of the album. In July 2013, Home Brew toured New Zealand on the Home Brew Speakeasy Tour. They performed one show each in Auckland, Hamilton, Wellington, Queenstown, Dunedin and Christchurch. Prior to the album's release, music videos were released for the tracks \\"Listen to Us\\" and \\"Yellow Snot Funk\\". Reception Writing for The Dominion Post, Luke Appleby praised the album's beats, instrumentation and lyrical honesty, and gave it five out of five stars. Lydia Jenkin of The New Zealand Herald rated Home Brew four and a half stars out of five. John Hayden from the Otago Daily Times picked Home Brew as one of the top albums of 2012. At the 2012 New Zealand Music Awards, Home Brew was nominated in the categories of Album of the Year, Best Group, Breakthrough Artist of the Year and Best Urban/Hip Hop Album; it won the Urban/Hip Hop Award. Home Brew did not receive much promotion from airplay or television screening due to the profanities contained within the lyrics. However, the album debuted at number one on the New Zealand Albums Chart—the first New Zealand hip hop album to do so since Scribe's The Crusader (2003)— due to high digital pre-ordering. The album remained on the albums chart for fifteen weeks.

Tenticospirifer has a relatively narrow hingeline and an inflated and thick shell in common with two of the oldest species known, C. verneuiliformis and C. aperturatus.

Route  The section between Dortmund Central Station and Dortmund-Horde part of the railway route Dortmund-Soest, is double track and electrified and classified as a mainline railway. The northern part of the Ardey Railway between Dortmund-Horde and Schwerte is a double-track and non-electrified main line. Its maximum speed is 90 km/h. The southern section between Schwerte and Iserlohn is a single-track non-electrified branch line, with a passing loop at Kalthof. Most of this section can be run at 100 km/h. The Letmathe–Fröndenberg railway has been closed between Iserlohn and Menden and there is currently no connection between the Ardey Railway and the line to Letmathe in Iserlohn. Iserlohn is therefore formally not a Bahnhof (station, which under German regulations must have at least one set of points) but instead a Haltepunkt (halt) on two lines. However, the Zweckverband SPNV Ruhr-Lippe (association for the promotion of public transport in Ruhr-Lippe, ZRL) intends to build a connection between the two lines, including points, which would restore its status as a station.  History  After Iserlohn had been connected by rail to Letmathe in 1864, the chamber of commerce and industry campaigned in 1882 for the construction of a railway to the north towards Schwerte. Against resistance mainly from businessmen in the Lenne valley, who advocated lines from Letmathe to Schwerte or from Iserlohn to Altena, especially the then owner of the nickel plants in Iserlohn and Schwerte, Dr Theodor Fleitmann. He supported the construction of a railway through the valley of the Elsebach. The district (Landkreis), however, decided that the line should be built along the Baarbach to promote industry in Sümmern, Kalthof and Hennen. After the death of Fleitmann in 1904, the construction started in 1907 and it was completed a year later. Money provided in Fleitmann’s will for the construction of a railway was not used because it had been earmarked for the route favoured by him. The construction of the railway was relatively expensive; 200,000 cubic metres of limestone were blasted just for a cutting in Iserlohn, where numerous fossils were found. Several embankments and bridges had to be built on the course of the line. The recently completed bridge over the Ruhr were severely damaged in a flood in February 1909 and had to be replaced. Overall, the line between Schwerte and Iserlohn had to overcome a height difference of 130 m. The construction cost 6 million marks, covering, among other things, the erection of 39 engineering structures and the moving of about one million m3 of earth. (Iserlohn local section) The opening ceremony took place on 30 September 1910, coinciding with the last stagecoach ride from Schwerte to Iserlohn, the day after scheduled traffic commenced. The other part of the line from Schwerte to Dortmund-Horde was opened two years later in October 2012 for freight operations and in January 1913 for passenger operations. In contrast to the first section, this line was built for its full length as double track. In addition to the crossing loop at Kalthof, there was also a crossing loop at Ergste until 1981. Therefore, it had a second platform, traces of which can still be seen. There is no freight traffic on the line any more. Sidings are still present in Kalthof (for Kettenwerk Thiele) and Hennen for the occasional transport of RWE transformers to the substation in Sümmern. In the 1990s and the early 2000s, services were provided by class 624 railcars. In 2002, DB Regio NRW won the contract for the so-called Sauerland Net (; apart from this line, it also includes the Dortmund-Sauerland-Express, the Volmetal-Bahn and the Hönnetal-Bahn) and thus has the right to operate the line for another 12 years from the timetable change in December 2004, using Alstom Coradia LINT 41 (class 648) railcars. Passenger demand on the Dortmund-Horde–Schwerte section rose from about 3,000 to about 4,500 passengers between 1997 and 2008. Also on the Schwerte–Iserlohn section there has been passenger growth of about 50% to about 1,600 passengers a day.Zweckverband Ruhr Lippe, meeting 65 Services Iserlohn state railway station The Regionalbahn service RB 53 (Ardey-Bahn) operates *daily every hour between Dortmund and Iserlohn and *from Monday to Friday every 30 minutes during the peak hour between Dortmund and Schwerte, connecting to Iserlohn. The average speed is highly directional. So trains to Dortmund from Iserlohn have an average speed of only 44 km/h, while trains from Dortmund to Iserlohn average 51 km/h. This is partly due to the out-dated signalling in Kalthof, which does not allow the simultaneous entry and exit of trains, meaning that trains to Dortmund have to wait seven minutes for the oncoming trains, and also to the coupling of trains in Schwerte (also taking seven minutes). In the opposite direction the uncoupling of trains in Schwerte takes just three minutes and no specific period is required for stopping at Kalthof. Shortening of the travel time to Dortmund is planned. Rail services from Ardey are operated by DB Regio NRW, using LINT 41 diesel railcars in single or double traction, which are capable of operating at 120 km/h. Coupling/uncoupling is usually carried out in Schwerte. Occasionally LINT 27 (class 640) or class 628 DMUs are used.  Future  The following upgrades to the line are proposed: *In Iserlohn, a set of points is to be installed to reconnect the line to the line to the railway to Letmathe. * the signalling in Kalthof will be modernised so that simultaneous entrances to the station are possible, allowing the running time to be reduced by up to seven minutes (possibly by 2015). *In Schwerte the passing track will be adapted so that passing trains can run faster. *Consideration is being given to having additional peak-hour trains skip some of the intermediate stations between Dortmund and Iserlohn. Thus, these trains would take just 35 to 38 minutes on the Dortmund–Iserlohn route. *There is a long-term plan to extend the provision of services at 30-minute intervals all day from the Dortmund–Schwerte section to the Schwerte–Iserlohn section.  Notable  It is interesting that the line does not have a single level crossing, but instead many overpasses and underpasses were built for even the smallest dirt roads, including single-lane tracks on high embankments.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1991, and is now the Presque Isle County Historical Museum. History Carl Bradley and W. F. White at Calcite in 1919 This house was constructed in 1914 by George J. Radka, a local contractor and the owner of a planing mill. Radka died unexpectedly at the end of 1914, and in 1915 the house was sold to J. L. Marsters, general superintendent of the Michigan Limestone and Chemical Company. Later that year, Marsters sold the house to his boss, Carl D. Bradley, a shipping magnate and president of Michigan Limestone and Chemical. Bradley made extensive revisions to the home, enlarging it considerably. While living there, he launched Michigan Limestone and Chemical Company from a small-scale quarry into a national producer of limestone. Bradley was also heavily involved in the business and social life of Rogers City, serving on the boards of the Presque Isle County Savings Bank and of Rogers City Light and Power, helping found the Westminster Presbyterian Church, and serving on the School Board. Bradley lived in the house until 1928, when he died unexpectedly during a vacation to Pasadena, California. After Bradley's death and in accordance with his contract, Michigan Limestone purchased the house from his widow. Bradley's successor as president, John G. Munson, lived there from 1928 to 1939. When Munson moved along to a higher position in U.S. Steel, Michigan limestone's parent company, the house passed to his successor Irvin L. Clymer, who lived here until 1950. When Clymer was likewise promoted, U.S. Steel's northern district manager Joseph Valentin occupied the house until his retirement in 1957. After Valentin's retirement, Michigan Limestone allowed the county to use the house as the Presque Isle District Library. The library moved into the building in 1957 and occupied it until 1980. The company then deeded the house to the Presque Isle County Historical Museum, who moved in in 1981. The building is still used as a museum. Description The Radka–Bradley House is a 1-1/2 story frame house with a side-gable roof covered with green shingles on a foundation covered with rounded cobblestones. A shed dormer runs across the front, and a single-story glassed in porch covers the entrance. Side porches are located at each end of the house. The roof rafters extend to the exterior of the house, and end in scalloped lower surfaces. The house has seven bedrooms, four baths, and three sun porches.

Events leading up to the disappearance Evans had been away during the week of her disappearance near the coast at Rhuddlan with her husband Richard, who was renovating the couple's holiday bungalow. She returned to Llangollen on Wednesday, 13 June. Day of the disappearance On Saturday, 16 June 1990, Trevaline opened her shop, Attic Antiques on Church Street, at the usual time of 9:30am. She had parked her dark blue Ford Escort estate 200 yards away. During the morning, approximately 25 friends and customers had called in and according to the friends who visited, Evans appeared relaxed, happy and had made plans to go out that night. The weather that day was sunny according to the police and the town centre described as busy. At about 12:40pm, Evans left a note on the front door of her shop, saying she would be \\"back in two minutes\\". A smartly dressed man was reportedly seen talking to her in the shop shortly before she left the note. This man was never traced. It is known that she bought an apple and a banana and was seen crossing nearby Castle Street. As a banana skin was found in a dustbin in the shop after this time, it is thought she must have returned there. However, this has never been confirmed. Evans’s handbag, car keys and jacket, along with fruit and flowers that she had intended to take home were left behind in the shop. Her car remained parked where it had been left. The last confirmed sighting of Evans was near her home on Market Street at 2:30pm. There were two more suspected sightings, both unconfirmed. At 2:35pm a woman matching her description was seen walking out of town along the A5 towards Corwen, beside the riverside park. At 3:45pm, there was another sighting, this time of a woman walking into Park Avenue from the direction of the River Dee. Investigation Every household in Llangollen, as well as scores of people from further afield, were interviewed. More than 1,500 names were checked and about 700 cars were eliminated from the inquiry. Searches of the River Dee, the canal, mine shafts and caves in the Llangollen area were carried out, no trace was found. An artist's impression of a man in a blazer apparently seen in her company was drawn up and circulated during the investigation in 1990. In January 2001, the case was reopened by police in the hope new forensic techniques would suggest fresh evidence. Trevaline's husband Richard was arrested in June 2001 but later released without charge. Police also ruled out an artist's impression of a man allegedly seen with Trevaline shortly before her disappearance as no longer accurate. Subsequent Events The case was re-examined in 2010 on the 20th anniversary of Evans's disappearance. In September 2011 it was reported that police were looking into a possible connection between Trevaline's disappearance and a convicted serial killer named Robin Ligus.

Since 1991 she has lived for long periods with her husband, German Illera, in the rainforests of the Republic of Congo, conducting research and becoming increasingly involved in gorilla conservation. She estimated that 5,000 gorillas died from Ebola in Gabon and the Republic of Congo. Career Bermejo grew up in Madrid. She began her career as a child psychologist and later as a primatologist. Sometimes known as the \\"Dian Fossey of the Congo\\", she currently works for the Programme for Conservation and Rational Utilization of Forest Ecosystems in Central Africa (ECOFAC), a European Union-sponsored program that establishes a regional framework for conserving rainforests in central Africa. She is also a member of the faculty in the Animal Biology Department in the University of Barcelona in Spain. Primate research Western Lowland Gorilla (male) Bermejo first visited Africa in 1986, at the age of 22, to study chimpanzees in Senegal. Then she went to the Lilungu (Ikela) region in Zaire (now the Democratic Republic of the Congo) to study bonobos with a colleague from Barcelona, Jordi Sabater Pi. They began work in 1988 and were forced by war conditions to end it in 1990. Conservationists feared that the bonobos had not survived the war, but a population of bonobos was found in the area in 2005. While in Barcelona, Bermejo met and married German Ilera, a Spaniard who started as a law student and then became a videographer and naturalist. In 1991, the two started studying gorillas in an area that later became the Lossi Sanctuary. They were the first people to habituate western lowland gorillas to human presence. A prerequisite to studying them, habituation requires daily visits over about three years. By 2002, they had identified 10 social groups in a population of 143. Her work was described in a National Geographic video of 2001. Between October 2002 and January 2003, at the same time that humans in nearby villages were beginning to die from the Zaire strain of the Ebola virus disease (ZEBOV), 130 of the 143 gorillas died. The researchers monitored seven more social groups, and found that 91 of 95 gorillas died between October 2003 and January 2004. Extrapolating from these results, they estimated that in a area around the Lossi Sanctuary, about 5000 gorillas died. Because of the high mortality rate, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) listed the western lowland gorilla as Critically Endangered, one step away from Extinct in the Wild. Initially, opinions were divided on whether ZEBOV was the cause of the deaths, and if so whether the disease was spread via a reservoir in other species (for example, bats or birds) or by gorilla-to- gorilla transmission. Out of twelve carcasses that Bermejo and her group examined, nine tested positive for Ebola. By the lag time between deaths in neighboring social groups, they were able to show that the disease mainly spread from social group to social group. Based on these results, other scientists have argued for a vaccination campaign to protect other gorillas. Bermejo has continued to study gorillas after the Ebola outbreak. In 2009, she found a concentration of them near Odzala National Park. Six social groups have been found, two of which are habituated. Among the foci of the study are the impact of Ebola and interactions with other species (chimpanzees and humans). Eco-tourism and conservation After the loss of gorillas to Ebola, Bermejo began to create community projects to help both the gorillas and the people in nearby villages. With support from Sabine Plattner African Charities, development of the nearby village Mbomo has begun, with plans for a community center, Internet and educational enrichment. Odzala Discovery Camps: Ngaga Camp is the research site of Bermejo and Illera and their home, has become a destination for safaris run by Congo Conservation Company. The gorilla tours through a Marantaceae (arrowroot) forest are led by trackers who work for Bermejo.

He was mortally wounded on the first day of the Battle of Gettysburg. He died in a field hospital three days later. Early life Mahler was born in Baden, Baden-Württemberg, Germany, on August 1, 1826. He was involved with the uprising of 1848–1849, and was a comrade of future Union General Carl Schurz during this period. Mahler was captured and was condemned to death for his part. However, he managed to escape. He came to the United States in 1851 at 24 years of age. He arrived in New York on the SS Charlemagne on August 20 of that year. Mahler married Jennie M. (March 26, 1832 – March 29, 1918) from Massachusetts. Civil War service In August 1861, following the outbreak of the American Civil War, Mahler assisted Philadelphia liquor merchant Henry Bohlen to recruit and organize a regiment. This unit would eventually be designated the 75th Pennsylvania Infantry. Mahler was named lieutenant colonel. When Colonel Henry Bohlen was promoted to brigadier general, on July 20, 1862, Mahler received his commission as colonel and took command of the 75th Pennsylvania Infantry. Mahler was wounded while leading the regiment on the second day at the Second Battle of Bull Run. At the Battle of Chancellorsville, the 75th Pennsylvania Infantry was one of the first units subjected to General \\"Stonewall\\" Jackson's flank attack, and was routed along with the rest of the 11th Corps. Death at Gettysburg During the Battle of Gettysburg, the 75th Pennsylvania Infantry was heavily engaged on the first day (July 1, 1863), in open fields north of town. The men of this unit, having advanced a considerable distance after passing through the town, held ground just east of the Carlisle Road. The fighting intensified with the collapse of other regiments forming the Union line, and the 75th Pennsylvania Infantry was exposed to a murderous fire, that rapidly depleted the ranks. Mahler was wounded in the leg at the same time that his horse was shot out from under him. He managed to extricate himself from under the animal and, although crippled, continued to direct the troops under his command. However, as the regiment began to fall back, having been outflanked by the Confederates, Mahler received a mortal gunshot wound. Lieutenant T. Albert Steiger, at considerable risk to his own life, went to Mahler's assistance. Mahler was carried from the field with General Carl Schurz clasping his hand and weeping. Mahler's brother, Lieutenant Louis Mahler, a member of the same regiment, was also killed during this same firefight. However, it is unclear whether Mahler was aware of his brother's death. Mahler died in a field hospital at Gettysburg on the morning of July 4, 1863. He was 37 years old. Mahler is buried in Section B, Lot 263 of Mount Peace Cemetery in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.

Definition  A fiber functor (or fibre functor) is a loose concept which has multiple definitions depending on the formalism considered. One of the main initial motivations for fiber functors comes from Topos theory. Recall a topos is the category of sheaves over a site. If a site is just a single object, as with a point, then the topos of the point is equivalent to the category of sets, \\\\mathfrak{Set}. If we have the topos of sheaves on a topological space X, denoted \\\\mathfrak{T}(X), then to give a point a in X is equivalent to defining adjoint functors > a^*:\\\\mathfrak{T}(X)\\\\leftrightarrows \\\\mathfrak{Set}:a_* The functor a^* sends a sheaf \\\\mathfrak{F} on X to its fiber over the point a; that is, its stalk.  From covering spaces  Consider the category of covering spaces over a topological space X, denoted \\\\mathfrak{Cov}(X). Then, from a point x \\\\in X there is a fiber functor > \\\\text{Fib}_x: \\\\mathfrak{Cov}(X) \\\\to \\\\mathfrak{Set} sending a covering space \\\\pi:Y \\\\to X to the fiber \\\\pi^{-1}(x). This functor has automorphisms coming from \\\\pi_1(X,x) since the fundamental group acts on covering spaces on a topological space X. In particular, it acts on the set \\\\pi^{-1}(x) \\\\subset Y. In fact, the only automorphisms of \\\\text{Fib}_x come from \\\\pi_1(X,x). = With etale topologies = There is algebraic analogue of covering spaces coming from the Étale topology on a connected scheme S. The underlying site consists of finite etale covers, which are finiteWhich is required to ensure the etale map X \\\\to S is surjective, otherwise open subschemes of S could be included. flat surjective morphisms X \\\\to S such that the fiber over every geometryic point s \\\\in S is the spectrum of a finite etale \\\\kappa(s)-algebra. For a fixed geometric point \\\\overline{s}:\\\\text{Spec}(\\\\Omega) \\\\to S, consider the geometric fiber X\\\\times_S\\\\text{Spec}(\\\\Omega) and let \\\\text{Fib}_{\\\\overline{s}}(X) be the underlying set of \\\\Omega-points. Then, > \\\\text{Fib}_{\\\\overline{s}}: \\\\mathfrak{Fet}_S \\\\to \\\\mathfrak{Sets} is a fiber functor where \\\\mathfrak{Fet}_S is the topos from the finite etale topology on S. In fact, it is a theorem of Grothendieck the automorphisms of \\\\text{Fib}_{\\\\overline{s}} form a Profinite group, denoted \\\\pi_1(S,\\\\overline{s}), and induce a continuous group action on these finite fiber sets, giving an equivalence between covers and the finite sets with such actions.  From Tannakian categories  Another class of fiber functors come from cohomological realizations of motives in algebraic geometry. For example, the De Rham cohomology functor H_{dR} sends a motive M(X) to its underlying de-Rham cohomology groups H_{dR}^*(X).

Description The first chapter tells of Maroosia and Vanya who live in a hut of pine logs in the forest with their grandfather, the forester Old Peter. Their father and mother are both dead, and they can hardly remember them. Twenty stories told by Old Peter to the children follow, including The Fool of the World and the Flying Ship. Ransome says in a Note at the beginning that \\"The stories in this book are those that Russian peasants tell their children and each other\\", and that it was written for \\"English children who play in deep lanes with wild roses above them in the high hedges, or by the small singing becks that dance down the grey fells at home\\". Ransome had gone to Russia in 1913, to learn the language, and to escape from his first marriage. The book's introductory note says Vergezha, 1915. He had gone to Vergezha on the river Volkhov as a guest of Harold Williams and his wife Ariadna; to stay in her family home. Ransome says in his autobiography that the English listeners \\"know nothing of the world that in Russia listeners and storytellers take for granted\\". So rather than direct translation (as William Ralston Shedden-Ralston did in his 1873 Russian Folk Tales; which he read in 1913) he read all the variants of the story, and rewrote them with Old Peter, Vanya and Maroosia rather than the Ogre, the Elf and the Imp. Publication was delayed, and he thought that the publishers did not expect to sell more than the initial 2000. But by 1956 more than 24,000 copies had been sold plus another 25,000 in cheaper editions and also several American editions, both piratical and legitimate Hugh Brogan says that it was Ransome's \\"first indubitable literary success. It has never been out of print. Arthur Ransome's apprenticeship was over\\". Re-print Old Peter's Russian Tales was re-published by the Arthur Ransome Trust in December, 2016. together with The War of the Birds and the Beasts (re-named The Battle of the Birds and the Beasts at Hugh Brogan's suggestion), thereby creating the first combined edition of Arthur Ransome's Russian folk tales. The new edition includes a new introduction by Hugh Lupton, Arthur Ransome's great-nephew, whose own career as a professional story-teller owes much to Arthur Ransome's Russian folk- tales.

Bønnerup Strand is a fishing village, sprawling inland from the harbour. It is situated at the large shallow Bay of Aalborg in the Kattegat sea. The beach and coast east and west of Bønnerup Strand is broad, sandy, very shallow and considered child friendly. It attracts people and tourists for recreational activities in the summer. The surrounding area (simply called Bønnerup) has a large concentration of summer houses and rentals, with many situated in the hills overlooking the beach.  History  The village of Bønnerup strand is only a little more than a hundred years old, initiated when 4-5 families settled here as fishermen. The town has sprawled inland since then. Some of the original old houses are still around and a large part of the inhabitants are descendants of the first settling families. The oldest building in Bønnerup was the mill of Treå Mølle. It was mentioned as early as 1348 and served as a grain mill for local farmers in the area. The original mill burned to the ground in 1859, but was rebuilt in 1860. In 1892, the milling was discontinued and the buildings were rebuilt to house a bakery and ordinary residence. Strandhuset (lit.:The Beach-house) at the beach, was built in 1776 by the landlord of nearby Meilgård Castle. There is some doubt of its original function, but in the Napoleonic Wars it found use as a gunpowder magazine, serving the adjacent battery of Treå Mølle Batterie. Since then, the house has been known as Krudthuset by the locals. from 1845 to around 1890 the house served as poorhouse and home for the disabled. It later served as a shop and a guesthouse. The coastal military battery of Treå Mølle Batterie, at the mouth of the Treå stream was the only battery in all of Djursland, actually involved in combat during the Napoleonic Wars. Apart from Krudthuset, some later trenches and lookouts from World War II, can also be seen here.  The harbour  The harbour (Danish: Bønnerup Havn) is the only large harbour on the coast of Northern Djursland. It has been modernized and expanded in recent decades and includes a marina since 1999 and a marine wind farm of 7 turbines since 1997. Commercial fishing still plays an important part of the harbour and the early morning fish markets supply fresh seafood to traders from afar, as well as locals and random tourists. The local fishing association is currently the largest sponsor in Bønnerup Strand.

Surroundings and local attractions Activities at the beach. The beach is broad, sandy and the water is very shallow. Apart from the easy access to the sea, Bønnerup Strand is situated near woodlands and natural sites. There are several bicycle roads and hiking trails around Bønnerup Strand. Nordjurs Municipality has recently finished a bicycle road from the harbour front to the east along the coast. The road leads through a beautiful nature reserve presenting woodlands and wetlands with reed beds to the small coastal village of Gjerrild Nordstrand. Here the road turns south inland past Sostrup Castle and the nunnery of Sostrup Kloster in the village of Gjerrild. This first part of the trail also forms part of the national cycling route 5, known as Østkystruten (lit.:the east-coast-route). From Gjerrild the cycling road leads northwest through the forest of Emmedsbo and back to the marina at Bønnerup Strand. At Bønnerup Strand, there is also a gravelled coastal route leading west to the small coastal village of Fjellerup, the old Meilgård Castle in the southwest and back. A map of cycling and hiking trails in the area. The international long distance North Sea Trail for hiking, passes through Bønnerup Strand and further west towards Fjellerup.

They have applications in the fields of computational fluid dynamics (CFD), geography, designing and many more places where numerical solutions to the partial differential equations (PDEs) are required. Numerical grid generation is the crucial initial step involved in computing numerical solutions to the equations that describe a physical process. The accuracy of the solution depends upon the quality of the grid generated. A well-constructed grid can improve the quality of solution whereas, deviations from the numerical solution can be observed with a poorly constructed grid. Techniques for creating the cell forms the basis of grid generation. Various methods for the grid generation are discussed below. Algebraic methods  Nozzle Geometry Computational Mesh in Physical Space The grid generation by algebraic methods is based on mathematical interpolation function. It is done by using known functions in one, two or three dimensions taking arbitrary shaped regions. The computational domain might not be rectangular, but for the sake of simplicity, the domain is taken to be rectangular. The main advantage of the methods is that they provide explicit control of physical grid shape and spacing. The simplest procedure that may be used to produce boundary fitted computational mesh is the normalization transformation. For a nozzle, with the describing function y = x^2 the grid can easily be generated using uniform division in y-direction with equally spaced increments in x-direction, which are described by : \\\\xi=x \\\\, : \\\\eta = \\\\frac{y}{y_\\\\max} \\\\, where y_\\\\max denotes the y-coordinate of the nozzle wall. For given values of (\\\\xi, \\\\eta), the values of (x, y) can be easily recovered. Differential equation methods  Like algebraic methods, differential equation methods are also used to generate grids. The advantage of using the partial differential equations (PDEs) is that the solution of grid generating equations can be exploited to generate the mesh. Grid construction can be done using all three classes of partial differential equations. Elliptic schemes Elliptic PDEs generally have very smooth solutions leading to smooth contours. Using its smoothness as an advantage Laplace's equations can preferably be used because the Jacobian found out to be positive as a result of maximum principle for harmonic functions. After extensive work done by Crowley (1962) and Winslow (1966) on PDEs by transforming physical domain into computational plane while mapping using Poisson’s equation, Thompson et al. (1974) have worked extensively on elliptic PDEs to generate grids. In Poisson grid generators, the mapping is accomplished by marking the desired grid points (x,y) on the boundary of the physical domain, with the interior point distribution determined through the solution of equations written below : \\\\xi_{xx} + \\\\xi_{yy} = P(\\\\xi, \\\\eta) : \\\\eta_{xx} + \\\\eta_{yy} = Q(\\\\xi, \\\\eta) where, (\\\\xi,\\\\eta) are the co-ordinates in the computational domain, while P and Q are responsible for point spacing within D. Transforming above equations in computational space yields a set of two elliptic PDEs of the form, : \\\\alpha x_{\\\\xi\\\\xi} -2\\\\beta x_{\\\\xi\\\\eta} + \\\\gamma x_{\\\\eta\\\\eta} = -I^2 (Px_\\\\xi + Qx_\\\\eta) : \\\\alpha y_{\\\\xi\\\\xi} -2\\\\beta y_{\\\\xi\\\\eta} + \\\\gamma y_{\\\\eta\\\\eta} = -I^2 (Py_\\\\xi + Qy_\\\\eta) where : \\\\begin{align} \\\\alpha & = x^2_\\\\eta + y^2_\\\\eta \\\\ \\\\beta & = x_\\\\eta x_\\\\xi + y_\\\\xi y_\\\\eta \\\\ \\\\gamma & = x^2_\\\\xi + y^2_\\\\xi \\\\ I & = \\\\frac{\\\\delta(x, y)}{\\\\delta(\\\\xi, \\\\eta)} = y_\\\\eta x_\\\\xi - y_\\\\xi x_\\\\eta \\\\end{align} These systems of equations are solved in the computational plane on uniformly spaced grid which provides us with the (x,y) co-ordinates of each point in physical space. The advantage of using elliptic PDEs is the solution linked to them is smooth and the resulting grid is smooth. But, specification of P and Q becomes a difficult task thus adding it to its disadvantages. Moreover, the grid has to be computed after each time step which adds up to computational time. Hyperbolic schemes This grid generation scheme is generally applicable to problems with open domains consistent with the type of PDE describing the physical problem. The advantage associated with hyperbolic PDEs is that the governing equations need to be solved only once for generating grid. The initial point distribution along with the approximate boundary conditions forms the required input and the solution is the then marched outward. Steger and Sorenson (1980) proposed a volume orthogonality method that uses Hyperbolic PDEs for mesh generation. For a 2-D problem, Considering computational space to be given by \\\\Delta\\\\xi = \\\\Delta\\\\eta = 1 , the inverse of the Jacobian is given by, : x_\\\\xi y_\\\\eta - x_\\\\eta y_\\\\xi = I where I represents the area in physical space for a given area in computational space. The second equation links the orthogonality of grid lines at the boundary in physical space which can be written as : d\\\\xi = 0 = \\\\xi_x \\\\, dx + \\\\xi_y \\\\, dy. For \\\\xi and \\\\eta surfaces to be perpendicular the equation becomes : x_\\\\xi x_\\\\eta + y_\\\\xi y_\\\\eta = 0. The problem associated with such system of equations is the specification of I. Poor selection of I may lead to shock and discontinuous propagation of this information throughout the mesh. While mesh being orthogonal is generated very rapidly which comes out as an advantage with this method. Parabolic schemes The solving technique is similar to that of hyperbolic PDEs by advancing the solution away from the initial data surface satisfying the boundary conditions at the end. Nakamura (1982) and Edwards (1985) developed the basic ideas for parabolic grid generation. The idea uses either of Laplace or the Poisson's equation and especially treating the parts which controls elliptic behavior. The initial values are given as the coordinates of the point along the surface \\\\eta = 0 and the advancing the solutions to the outer surface of the object satisfying the boundary conditions along \\\\xi edges. The control of the grid spacing has not been suggested till now. Nakamura and Edwards, grid control was accomplished using non uniform spacing. The parabolic grid generation shows an advantage over the hyperbolic grid generation that, no shocks or discontinuities occur and the grid is relatively smooth. The specifications of initial values and selection of step size to control the grid points is however time consuming, but these techniques can be effective when familiarity and experience is gained. Variational methods This method includes a technique that minimizes grid smoothness, orthogonality and volume variation. This method forms mathematical platform to solve grid generation problems. In this method an alternative grid is generated by a new mesh after each iteration and computing the grid speed using backward difference method. This technique is a powerful one with a disadvantage that effort is required to solve the equations related to grid. Further work needed to be done to minimize the integrals that will reduce the CPU time. Unstructured grid generation See also Mesh generation. The main importance of this scheme is that it provides a method that will generate the grid automatically. Using this method, grids are segmented into blocks according to the surface of the element and a structure is provided to ensure appropriate connectivity. To interpret the data flow solver is used. When an unstructured scheme is employed, the main interest is to fulfill the demand of the user and a grid generator is used to accomplish this task. The information storage in structured scheme is cell to cell instead of grid to grid and hence the more memory space is needed. Due to random cell location, the solver efficiency in unstructured is less as compared to the structured scheme. Some points are needed to be kept in mind at the time of grid construction. The grid point with high resolution creates difficulty for both structured and unstructured. For example, in case of boundary layer, structured scheme produces elongated grid in the direction of flow. On the other hand unstructured grids require a higher cell density in the boundary layer because the cell needs to be as equilateral as possible to avoid errors. Connectivity information We must identify what information is required to identify the cell and all the neighbors of the cell in the computational mesh. We can choose to locate the arbitrary points anywhere we want for the unstructured grid. A point insertion scheme is used to insert the points independently and the cell connectivity is determined. This suggests that the point be identified as they are inserted. Logic for establishing new connectivity is determined once the points are inserted. Data that form grid point that identifies grid cell are needed. As each cell is formed it is numbered and the points are sorted. In addition the neighbor cell information is needed. Adaptive grid A problem in solving partial differential equations using previous methods is that the grid is constructed and the points are distributed in the physical domain before details of the solution is known. So the grid may or may not be the best for the given problem. Adaptive methods are used to improve the accuracy of the solutions. The adaptive method is referred to as ‘h’ method if mesh refinement is used, ‘r’ method if the number of grid point is fixed and not redistributed and ‘p’ if the order of solution scheme is increased in finite-element theory. The multi dimensional problems using the equidistribution scheme can be accomplished in several ways. The simplest to understand are the Poisson Grid Generators with control function based on the equidistribution of the weight function with the diffusion set as a multiple of desired cell volume. The equidistribution scheme can also be applied to the unstructured problem. The problem is the connectivity hampers if mesh point movement is very large. Steady flow and the time-accurate flow calculation can be solved through this adaptive method. The grid is refined and after a predetermined number of iteration in order to adapt it in a steady flow problem. The grid will stop adjusting to the changes once the solution converges. In time accurate case coupling of the partial differential equations of the physical problem and those describing the grid movement is required.

Also known as ‘Donor Cell’ Differencing Scheme, the convected value of property \\\\phi at the cell face is adopted from the upstream node. It can be described by Steady convection-diffusion partial Differential Equation:H.K Versteeg & W. Malalasekera (1995).

Assessment ConservativenessH.K Versteeg & W. Malalasekera . An introduction to Computational Fluid Dynamics.Chapter:5.Page 118(5.6.1.1). The upwind differencing scheme formulation is conservative. BoundednessH.K Versteeg & W. Malalasekera . An introduction to Computational Fluid Dynamics.Chapter:5.Page 118 (5.6.1.2). As the coefficients of the discretised equation are always positive hence satisfying the requirements for boundedness and also the coefficient matrix is diagonally dominant therefore no irregularities occur in the solution. Fig 4: Accuracy and false deviation variation with the grid size TransportivenessH. K. Versteeg & W. Malalasekera (1995). An Introduction to Computational Fluid Dynamics, Chapter 5, page 118. (5.6.1.3) Transportiveness is built into the formulation as the scheme already accounts for the flow direction. Accuracy Based on the backward differencing formula, the accuracy is only first order on the basis of the Taylor series truncation error. It gives error when flow is not aligned with grid lines. Distribution of transported properties become marked giving diffusion-like appearance, called as the false diffusion. Refinement of grid serves in overcoming the issue of false diffusion. With decrease in the grid size, false diffusion decrease thus increasing the accuracy.

It was built by the British shipyard of Armstrong Mitchell and Co, being launched in 1895 and completing in 1896. Buenos Aires continued in use until 1932. Construction In February 1893, Armstrong and Mitchell laid down a protected cruiser (Yard No. 612) at its Elswick, Newcastle upon Tyne shipyard as a stock ship (i.e. without an order from a customer).Brooke 1999, p. 82. The ship soon found a buyer, with Argentina, involved in dispute with Chile over the border between the two nations in Patagonia, purchasing the ship on 27 November 1893, and named it Buenos Aires.Chesneau and Kolesnik 1979, p. 401.

Buenos Airess hull had an overall length of , and a length between perpendiculars of . It had a beam of and a draught of . Like Blanco Encalada, Buenos Aires had a flush deck layout, and its hull was wood and copper sheathed to reduce fouling. The ship displaced .Brooke 1999, pp. 81–82.Chesneau and Kolesnik 1979, pp. 403, 412. The ship was powered by two 4-cylinder triple-expansion steam engines fed by eight horizontal return tube boilers and driving two propeller shafts. This machinery was designed to give with natural draught and under forced draught, but managed to generate under natural draught during trials. The ship's main armament consisted of two 8 inch (203 mm) /45 calibre guns (compared to the 40 calibre guns fitted to Blanco Encalada), mounted fore and aft behind shields on the ship's centreline. These guns could fire or shells at a velocity of and respectively at a rate of fire of up to four rounds per gun per minute.Brassey 1897, p. 384. Secondary armament consisted of a mixed battery of four 6 inch (152 mm) /45 calibre and six 4.7 inch (120 mm) /45 calibre quick-firing guns, (compared to the ten 6 inch /40 calibre guns mounted on Blanco Encalada) which could fire and shells at a rate of 7 rounds per minute and 10 rounds per minute respectively. Tertiary armament consisted of sixteen three-pounder (47 mm) guns, while six QF 1-pounder pom-pom automatic guns were mounted on the ship's fighting tops. Five 18 inch torpedo tubes were fitted, one fixed in the box and four on the ship's broadside.The Engineer 31 July 1896, p. 106. As a protected cruiser, the ship's main protective armour was a sloping armoured deck of steel, with thickness of between and , with the ship's conning tower protected by armour and the gunshields thick. Operational history After arriving in Argentina, Buenos Aires joined the 1st Division of the fleet. The ship settled into a routine of naval exercises, interspersed with use as a survey ship. In 1906, the ship returned to the United Kingdom for refurbishment of its armament, while in 1911, it again returned to Britain to participate in the Fleet review at Spithead to celebrate the coronation of King George V. In 1926, Buenos Aires transported a four-man Spanish Air Force crew which included Major Ramón Franco and copilot/navigator Captain Julio Ruiz de Alda Miqueleiz from Argentina to a hero′s welcome in Spain. Between 22 January and 10 February 1926, the aviators had made a seven-stop, 6,300-mile (10,145-kilometer) flight of just under 51 hours from Spain to Buenos Aires in the Dornier Do J Wal (\\"Whale\\") flying boat Plus Ultra (\\"Farther Still\\").O'Connor, Derek, \\"The Other Franco,\\" Aviation History, January 2018, p. 58.

Seven Sweethearts generated legal trouble seven years later.

They include an English-lyric (\\"There is a Dreamboat on High\\") version of a berceuse (Wiegenlied/lullaby), long attributed (and in the film) to Mozart but in fact composed by Friedrich Fleischmann (Schlafe, mein Prinzchen, schlaf ein, 1799) or Bernhard Flies. Interestingly, a scene where a pianist-lodger plays a melody intended to lull the father/hotelier to sleep features Rock-a-bye Baby, derived from the often-retexted English ballad Lillibullero, itself derived from the quickstep section of a march by Henry Purcell.

The six-character drama revolves around a conflict between two couples, with the women considering the men cowards for not wanting to join the Defenders of the Homeland and the men afraid of how the women will react to them having secretly joined. Despite warnings from the women's mother and father, the men prepare to leave for their training, with their partner's blessings. Written during the Japanese occupation of the Dutch East Indies (now Indonesia), while Pane was an employee of the Cultural Centre in Jakarta, Kami, Perempuan is similar to contemporary plays owing to its openly pro-Japanese message and emphasis on everyday issues experienced by average people. Discussions of the play have found it to be pro-Japanese propaganda, suggesting that men should join the military to please their women, though it has also been suggested that the play is in fact a warning against accepting the Defenders of the Homeland as being for Indonesia. Kami, Perempuan was performed numerous times in 1943, and its script has been compiled in a book. Plot Mahmud is sitting in his living room, lost in thought, as a newspaper hangs upside-down in his hands. His wife, Aminah, enters, and asks him what he is doing. When he answers that he is reading the newspaper, Aminah turns it right-side up and ridicules him. After she again interrupts him, Mahmud leaves the home. Aminah's parents come in soon afterwards and ask where Mahmud has gone, to which she replies \\"out\\". Their discussion is interrupted when Aminah's younger sister Sri comes in, upset, and tells them that she has just broken up with her fiancé, Supono. Upon questioning her, the family learns that Pono had likewise been pushed to join the recently established Pembela Tanah Air (PETA; Protectors of the Homeland), and refused; Sri had broken off their engagement rather than marry a coward, saying that if she were a man she would have certainly joined. Aminah implies that Mahmud has likewise refused to join. Sri is left in the living room as Aminah and their mother go to tend to Aminah's child, while their father goes to read the newspaper. Mahmud comes in, and quietly asks Sri to help him. He reveals that he had registered to join PETA several weeks prior and was to leave for training that very night, but was unsure of how Aminah would accept it. Sri tells him that she will ask her sister and has Mahmud hide in a wardrobe. After she leaves the room, Supono and Aminah enter from other doors. Supono, unknown to him, is in a similar situation to Mahmud, and Aminah convinces him to hide beneath a table as she asks Sri. The sisters meet in the living room and discuss how they would feel if each of their partners were – hypothetically – to leave for PETA training. Sri insults Supono's bravery, saying that he would never do it; Aminah feels the same about Mahmud. Ultimately the sisters decide to answer together, both expressing approval. Hearing this, Mahmud and Supono leave their hiding places and shout \\"Live, Srikandi of Indonesia!\\" The four are excited, and Sri and Supono prepare for a quick wedding. Aminah and Sri's parents, however, are frightened upon hearing that the men will join PETA.

Before the Japanese occupation of the Dutch East Indies had begun in 1942, Pane had made a name for himself in helping to establish the magazine Poedjangga Baroe in 1933 and with his novel Belenggu (Shackles; 1940). His first stage play, Lukisan Masa (Portrait of the Times), had been performed and published in May 1937. By 1942 Pane was one of the most prominent playwrights in Java, together with El Hakim (pseud. Aboe Hanifah) and Usmar Ismail. Their works often dealt with politics, a sense of nationalism, and the influence of one's environment—particularly tradition, ethics, and religion. As with Kami, Perempuan, these works were oriented around everyday events and featured average people, as opposed to the earlier stories based in mythology and telling of gods and goddesses. After the Cultural Centre (in Indonesian, ; in Japanese, ) opened in Jakarta on 1 April 1943, Pane served as the head of its literature desk. This office was tasked with the establishment of a pro- Japanese and pro-Greater Asia culture. Numerous stage plays were written which promoted these ideals of the Empire of Japan, including Rd Ariffien's Ratoe Asia and various works by Hinatsu Eitaro and D. Suradji. Kami, Perempuan premiered in 1943 in Jakarta. It received multiple performances that year, some in Jakarta, some in other parts of Java. In 1950 Pane included Kami, Perempuan in his book Djinak-Djinak Merpati dengan Tjerita2 Sandiwara Lain, a collection of his stage plays. For this publication Pane removed a scene in which two neighbours came to visit the family, which included further conversation. Pane considered this scene to be anti-climactic, whereas without it the play's title became more appropriate. Another, smaller, change to the play was the removal of the names of Japan's enemies during World War II. Themes Indonesian literary critic Boen Sri Oemarjati finds Kami, Perempuan to be a romance which also shows the strength and virility of the Indonesian people. She concludes, however, that it is a work of propaganda, summarising its message as \\"Women with the spirit of Srikandi want their husbands to be as strong and virile as their own hearts\\", and to do so they must join PETA. M. Yoesoef of the University of Indonesia likewise categorises the play as propaganda vehicle, emphasising the theme of women willing to surrender their lovers to PETA, for the good of the nation. Chris Woodrich of Gadjah Mada University, meanwhile, argues that the play is a veiled warning against considering PETA as a nationalistic. Considering Pane's position at the Cultural Bureau, Woodrich suggests that Pane would have been aware of the Japanese occupation government's ultimate goal for PETA: to help defend the Indonesian archipelago against the Allies if necessary, a message which had to be conveyed implicitly owing to Pane's own position and the Japanese occupation government's strict censorship. Woodrich points to Aminah's father, a former employee of the Dutch colonial government, and suggests that the character's protests about joining PETA, seemingly in order to promote the safety and comfort of home, are actually based on an understanding of the colonial mindset and the accompanying manipulation; in-text, these protests can only be conveyed in implicit terms owing to the father's fear of the Japanese government.

The population of older parents who have children with a learning disability is growing and many of their children are likely to outlive them. In many cases the caring role can span up to seven decades, ending only with their death. Governments and other service providers cannot ignore the pressing needs of this population and their parent and sibling carers. In most countries, family carers provide inexpensive care for a person with a learning disability and other disabilities. This trend is set to continue in England. Demographic changes and the health needs of these two growing populations must be considered against government policy constraints and limited in-home and external care options in order to avoid a crisis. The consequences of not supporting these family carers will to lead to crisis management, increase in distress and care giving burdens, and increased spending on unsuitable crisis placements. Housing and financial guidance are issues for caregivers.  Future plan  A future plan is a structured plan for a carer’s relative who has a learning disability covering all aspects of well-being of that person. Clarifying and sharing the future plan for the relative is very important. A clear written statement of the carer’s future plan enables key people to understand the relative’s perspective. It allows others to understand what is involved and provides new opportunities for the family to contribute to the plan. Plans are often not put in place as a result of denial by parents or carers of their own mortality and of the fact that they won’t be able to help. Carers have referred to a lack of support and guidance and are reluctant to ask for help.  Housing = United Kingdom  It is uncomfortable for family carers to explore out-of-home placements (housing) and support (or personal care) options for their relative with learning disabilities. Research has shown that older parents or sibling carers want their relative to stay within their own home either with family or professional support, or move into a home of a sibling. Residential care is a lesser preferred option. Housing and support in Northern Ireland can be either provided separately by different organisations or offered together by the same organisation. Such services were provided by Health & Social Care Trusts, although recently there are a number of alternative providers (i.e. Mencap, Positive Futures, PRAXIS, APEX and Trinity Housing). These offer people with learning disabilities different living and support arrangements. The majority of people with learning disabilities in Northern Ireland and the United Kingdom live with their family. Family carers have limited knowledge about the different housing options that are available. Potential housing options in Northern Ireland include supported living, residential care, nursing home accommodation, adult placements and intentional community.  Funding = United Kingdom  Disability Living Allowance (DLA) is paid at different rates depending on how a disability affects someone. Disability Living Allowance is in two parts: the care component and the mobility component. Attendance Allowance is, in 2013, paid weekly at two different rates. It depends on the level of help required. Extra Pension Credit or Housing Benefit is also available. Incapacity Benefit, which has been replaced by Employment and Support Allowance, is money for people who cannot work because they are sick or disabled. Independent Living Fund (ILF) provides money to help disabled people live an independent life in the community rather than in residential care. There are different methods to fund housing and support options (in Northern Ireland). Direct payments from social services are payments made to the family carer or the person with the learning disability to buy care services. Direct payments give the family carer money instead of social care services. Carers have a greater choice and control over the life of a person with a learning disability, and are able to make decisions about how care is delivered.  Emergency plans  Emergency plans are for any period when the caregiver is unable to care for their charge for a short- period of time. Family carers want to continue caring for as long as possible and also want to engage in emergency and future planning. Educational programmes have been developed to help ageing parents prepare future plans. Without plans and supports in place, individuals with learning disabilities may be placed in inappropriate settings, or in unexpected care provided by other family members.

It was released on June 10, 2014. It was nominated for the Goodreads Choice Award for science fiction. Plot With an alien invasion in progress in China, humanity is divided on how to defend itself. The Chinese government is determined to go it alone, despite suffering catastrophic losses. Captain Wit O'Toole of the Mobile Operations Police (MOP) and Mazer Rackham have managed to destroy one of the three alien landers, but because they achieved the first significant human victory of the war without official approval and using a nuclear warhead obtained without authorization, they are in the custody of Chinese General Sima. During the invasion, Mazer Rackham saves Bingwen, a very intelligent eight-year-old Chinese boy who now comes up with a clever ploy to get them released: he spreads word over the internet that they were acting under Sima's orders and gives Sima full credit. Meanwhile, Victor Delgado and Imala Bootstamp drift to the alien mothership in a ship disguised to avoid being destroyed. Victor manages to enter and explore the vessel. They survive a failed drone attack on the alien ship and, after getting away again, confront Lem Jukes, whom they suspect of involvement in the attack. Actually, it was launched by Lem's father, Ukko. Lem tried to stop or delay it. Based on what he has learned, Victor devises a plan to capture it, and reluctantly accepts Lem's help in carrying it out. The MOPs, including Wit and Mazer, are recruited to become the rest of Victor's boarding party. Despite Victor's objections, Imala volunteers as well. When the Formics detect the intruders, all of their forces on Earth leave to go to their ship's defense. Lem leads a force to hold them off, resulting in a fierce space battle. Aboard the Mothership, Wit has to sacrifice his life, exposing himself to quickly lethal levels of radiation, but Victor's plan succeeds, and the ship is captured intact. However, Victor's cousin, Edimar, backtracks the path of the alien ship and discovers that it was only a scout ship; the real Mothership is reconfiguring itself into a battle fleet that will arrive in about five years.

Background In September 2000, Les Entreprises Camvrac Inc. was granted a line of credit of $277,000 by the Caisse populaire du Bon Conseil in Notre-Dame-du-Bon-Conseil, Quebec, and in return it made a term deposit of $200,000 which was neither negotiable nor transferable during the line's term. In the event of default, it was agreed that there would be compensation between the credit agreement and the term deposit. In November 2000, Camvrac defaulted on the credit agreement and later made an assignment in bankruptcy. As it had failed to remit source deductions with respect to income taxes and employment insurance premiums, which are subject to a deemed trust under the Income Tax Act (Canada) and the Employment Insurance Act, the Crown gave the Caisse notice to pay the amount owing to the Crown from the proceeds of the deposit. The Caisse challenged the recovery process, contending that its obligation applied only to the \\"proceeds from\\" the property subject to the trust, and that in reality it had not received any \\"proceeds from\\" the term deposit certificate. The courts below Mme Prothonotary Tabib of the Federal Court of Canada, at first instance, held that the term deposit constituted a benefit to the Caisse, and by extension the \\"proceeds from a property\\" must be construed as including any set-off or benefit received in exchange or in consideration of the property. As she observed: The judgment was sustained at a full trial in the Federal Court by Pinard J, and subsequently at the Federal Court of Appeal in a ruling by Létourneau JA. The Caisse appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada. At the SCC The appeal was dismissed in a 5-2 ruling. Rothstein J wrote the ruling for the majority, and Deschamps J delivered a detailed dissent. Majority ruling The primary issue was identified as to whether the Crown was the beneficial owner of Camvrac's term deposit to the extent of its liability to the Crown, under the deemed trust provisions of the Acts. Rothstein J held that it was:SCC, par. 817 :* s. 227(4.1) of the ITA declares that a deemed trust operates notwithstanding any \\"security interest\\" that may exist in property held by a taxpayer or a secured creditor :* s. 224(1.3) provides for an expansive definition of a \\"security interest\\" :* similar provisions exist in the EIA :* they are effective because \\"[f]or particular purposes Parliament can and does create its own lexicon,\\" and it is open to Parliament to define a term in an area of its own legislative competence :* the current statutory régime was introduced to oust the previous patchwork of federal and provincial rules identified in Royal Bank of Canada v. Sparrow Electric Corp. He further held that the right of compensation under ss. 16721673 of the Civil Code of Quebec (analogous to the concept of set-off in the common-law provinces) can fall within the scope of a \\"security interest\\" as defined, but not in every case: In the case at hand he held that it was: Dissent Deschamps J, in her analysis, held that the concept of \\"security interest\\" was not as broad as was expressed by Rothstein J:SCC, par. 7882 :* the English and French definitions (\\"security interest\\" and \\"garantie\\") were not identical in scope, with the French definition being less precise :* it is therefore important that the two versions be read together and that the meaning of the terms be harmonized :* under the Interpretation Act (Canada), the law of the province is the relevant source :* absent an express provision to the contrary, federal legislation must be interpreted in a manner consistent with the concepts and institutions of the legal system of the province in which it is to be applied In that regard, the following observations can be made in how this should be applied in Quebec:SCC, par. 92105 :* the common law concept of security interest therefore corresponds, in civil law terms, not to a personal right, but to a real right :* in the CCQ, the concept of real right includes forms of security that have been consolidated in the concept of the hypothec :* the provisions relating to compensation fall within the CCQ's chapter on the extinction of obligations, and not in that relating to hypothecs :* since compensation has not been included in the list of examples of what constitutes a \\"security interest\\" under the ITA, the Caisse's right can constitute a security interest only if it entails a real right :* the automatic extinction of mutual debts is an effect of compensation, but it does not constitute the enforcement of a real right in the property in question :* the scope of the English term \\"security interest\\" is better expressed in French by the term \\"sûreté\\" She would have allowed the appeal, and remanded the case back to the trial judge, as compensation cannot be considered to be a \\"security interest\\": the Caisse's contractual right may be set up against the Crown, because the Crown cannot have more rights than Camvrac itself had. In response to Deschamps J's dissent, Rothstein J stated the following:SCC, par. 3455 :* mutual obligations must exist for compensation to be an effective remedy :* a contract containing a right to set-off can also confer on a creditor an interest in a debtor's property :* while compensation does not appear grouped with hypothecs in the CCQ, the issue is not whether compensation is a security interest: the list is non‑exhaustive, and so long as an agreement confers on a creditor an interest in property that secures the payment or performance of an obligation through compensation, the agreement will constitute a \\"security interest\\" within the meaning of s. 224(1.3) ITA :* an agreement that provides for security together with a right of set-off to realize on that security is not expressly excluded in any of the common law provincial personal property security statutes: what is required by them is a decision about whether a particular contract or agreement in a given case functions as a security interest. :* at both civil and common law, a claim, like a deposit, may be charged with a real right or become the subject of a creditor's interest in property :* even if the obligation to maintain and the right to retain are residual and apply only after the five-year term of the deposit has expired, they are nonetheless encumbrances that could affect Camvrac's use of its property :* the right of retention, the obligation to maintain and Camvrac's pledge not to hypothecate or use its term deposit as security in favour of anyone besides the Caisse were three of a series of encumbrances that created the Caisse's interest in or right over Camvrac's property to ensure that compensation would be an effective remedy. Impact The SCC ruling has proved to be controversial. Many legal scholars and commentators preferred Deschamps J's reasoning to that of Rothstein J's. As the ITA's definition of \\"security interest\\" is quite similar to that embodied in the various provincial Personal Property Security Acts, lenders may be exposed to attack, not just from the Canada Revenue Agency but also from trustees in bankruptcy, and secured creditors from their depositors, if security interests are not perfected by registration in the common law provinces, or published as a movable hypothec without delivery in Quebec. This decision has the potential to have a significant impact on insolvency practice across Canada. By increasing personal liability, it widens the scope of liability where not only financial institutions, but all persons both dealing with tax debtors and receiving payments while a deemed trust exists, may be liable. Cash collateral agreements commonly rely on what has been called a \\"triple cocktail\\" of set- off, security interest and \\"flawed asset\\". In effect, Caisse Populaire stands for the proposition that the first and third element of the \\"triple cocktail\\" automatically combine to form the second, even though the lender may regard them as conceptually distinct. Derivative agreements such as those embodied in International Swaps and Derivatives Association contracts may also fall within the scope of the decision. Unlike in the United States, Canadian security interests in cash deposits are not perfected by control, as is allowed under Article 9 of the US Uniform Commercial Code. Registration is the only option, which can expose a counterparty to the risk of subordination to prior registered interests. It has been argued, however, that in the case of title transfers of securities (or cash in a securities account), provincial Securities Transfer Actssuch as Ontario's Securities Transfer Act, 2006 (SO 2006, c.8) or other laws similar to UCC's Article 8 would ensure that the collateral taker should be perfected by control. Lenders have been advised to take several steps to minimize the risk of exposure in such situations: #Agreements should be carefully drafted, and lenders should be fully aware of the overall nature of the arrangement between the parties. #Borrowers should be required to give appropriate representations, covenants and warranties regarding payments that, where unpaid, would result in the Crown obtaining \\"super priority.\\" #Lenders may want to require that borrowers use third-party payroll services to ensure that wages and remittances are paid on a timely basis, as well as having the option to audit such payrolls.

Career In 1983, Douady was appointed to the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS). He was affiliated with Ecole Polytechnique (1983–87), Ecole Normale Supérieure (1987–95), the Courant Institute at New York University (1995–97), Ecole Normale Supérieure of Cachan (1997–2001), and a former visiting professor at New York University Polytechnic Institute.http://mbfasorbonne.univ-paris1.fr/staff/douadyraphael.html In 2001, he founded Riskdata, a private software company, remaining with them until 2011 since when he has been affiliated to Paris 1 Pantheon-Sorbonne University. In 1994, he created and animated the Bachelier Seminar of mathematical finance at Institut Henri Poincaré in Paris. He is also the co- founder, with Marco Avellaneda, of the Seminar of Mathematical Finance held at the Courant Institute of Mathematical Science, New York University. He has advised financial institutions including Société Générale, National Westminster Bank, Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce and Citibank. In 1999, along with Ingmar Adlerberg, a computer scientist from the French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation (INRIA) and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), Douady co-founded Riskdata, a company producing risk management software that helps buy-side financial institutions leading a proactive risk management and complying with financial regulations. He continues to be involved as their research director. In 2013, Douady was appointed as academic director of the Laboratory of Excellence on Financial Regulation (Labex refi),See http://www.labex-refi.com where his role was to supervise approximately sixty researchers on the inter-relations between financial regulations, the financial system and the real economy, and to advise governments and regulators on these issues. In 2015, he was appointed Frey Familyhttp://commcgi.cc.stonybrook.edu/am2/publish/General_University_News_2/Frey_Family_Foundation_Establishes_1_5M_Endowed_Chair_In_Quantitative_Finance_At_Stony_Brook_University.shtml endowed chair professor of quantitative finance at State University of New York in Stony Brook University. His role is to lead the graduate program in quantitative finance, initially created by Robert J. Frey. Notable research Douady worked on the Kolmogorov–Arnold–Moser (KAM) theorem on the existence of invariant tori in Hamiltonian systems. In his PhD thesis he proved the equivalence of KAM theory for Hamiltonian systems and for symplectomorphisms, opening the gate to discrete KAM theory.See He contributed to the theory of outer billiards, providing a full proof of a result announced earlier by J. Moser. Douady is the author of a seminal article in 1988 on Arnold diffusion, where he proved a long-standing conjecture of Vladimir Arnold on the existence of topologically unstable elliptic orbits of Hamiltonian systems in dimensions greater than or equal to 6.See Arnold’s Problems, problem 1963-1, Springer, 2004 http://www.lavoisier.fr/livre/notice.asp?ouvrage=2294531 In 1999, he established with Jean-Christophe Yoccoz a theory of automorphic measures of circle diffeomorphisms, a basis for differentiating the rotation number function. Since 1994, Douady has conducted research in the field of mathematical finance, statistics and economics. He established a generalization of Heath–Jarrow–Morton interest rate model, where the yield curve is represented as a random field. With Monique Jeanblanc, he created a rating-based credit derivatives model that introduced the notion of “rating surface”. In collaboration with Albert Shiryaev and Marc Yor he co-authored a theory of Brownian motions downfalls. Douady has concentrated research on financial instabilities, nonlinearities and systemic risk. He developed a statistical theory, called “polymodels” to compute an anticyclical risk indicator, the “Stress VaR”, a more extended version of the Basel III stress tests. Inspired by Minsky’s financial instability hypothesis, he proposed a Market Instability Indicator based on the first Lyapunov exponent of flows of funds evolution. In collaboration with Nassim Nicholas Taleb he developed the mathematical foundations of “fragility/antifragility” theory.

In a time before regulated championship titles, St. John used the press to proclaim himself as heavyweight champion of Wales after beating John O'Brien, a fighter he spent his early career building a rivalry against. Despite a high-profile defeat to O'Brien in 1894, St. John continued to fight, but a disastrous contest in which as a cornerman a boxer died at an unsanctioned match saw his career put in jeopardy. A successful period as a sparring partner for Australian champion Peter Jackson revived his career. After joining the British Army, he was posted to South Africa where he fought in the Second Boer World and died in heroic circumstances at the Battle of Belmont. Boxing career St. John was born David Jones in Resolven near Neath in 1871.Davies (2011), p.386 He was extremely tall for his time, being 6 foot 3 inches. A coal miner by occupation, St. John supplemented his wage through illegal boxing matches and fighting at local fairgrounds. At the age of 19 he travelled to a fairground in Neath where Cardiff based boxer John O'Brien was fighting at a booth. O'Brien, who was recognised as the Welsh heavyweight champion, had been fighting all day and foolishly agreed to accept St. John when he challenged him to a fight. The fight ended in defeat for O'Brien and caused a rift between the two fighters which continued throughout their careers.Davies (2011), pp.388-391 Not long after the meeting with O'Brien the two men travelled to London where they spent some time at Bob Habbajim's Boxing School, though a lack of credible opponents led to St. John returning to Wales. With the increasing popularity of gloved boxing, St John was able to engage in more legal fights, and a fight was arranged between him and Tom James of Aberaman at the Drill Hall in Merthyr Tydfil. St. John weighed in at 14 stone 8 pounds, an advantage of 20 pounds over his opponent as well as being three inches taller. As the fight started it was noticed that both men were out of condition, and at the end of the first round both were out of breath. It took until the fourth round for St. John to take advantage landing with a heavy blow to knock his opponent out.Davies (2011), pp.391-392 With O'Brien suffering from ill-health and James already beaten, St. John laid claim to the title of Welsh heavyweight champion. This infuriated O'Brien who made it known in the local press that he would challenge St. John to settle the matter. In truth O'Brien was in no condition to face St. John, but his main intention was to publicly challenge his claim.Davies (2011), p.395 St. John looked for a new opponent, but with little success. Instead a rematch with James was arranged. At first there was interest for the fight to be held at the Kennington Club in London, but the time table suggested did not favour St. John and the bout was arranged for the People's Park in Pontypridd. A large crowd turned out to watch the fight, which saw both men in far better condition than their first encounter. The fight ended in the sixth with St. John the victor, despite being pushed hard by James in the second and third rounds.Davies (2011), pp.397-398 In early 1894, O'Brien challenged St.John to stake up £50 to face each other, which was finally agreed to but a venue was yet to be decided. In the buildup to the match the two men met in the ring, but as seconds in a fight between Sam Butcher and Pawdy McCarthy. St. John was in Butcher's corner, and his friend's victory over McCarthy further rankled O'Brien.Davies (2011), p.401 Eventually interest was shown by the National Sporting Club in London which offered a purse of £50 to host the contest between St. John and O'Brien. The two met on 23 April 1894 and both men had trained tirelessly for the occasion. Despite giving away height and weight to St. John, O'Brien's boxing ability was decisive to the result as he put St. John down in both the second and third rounds. The fight ended in the fifth with O'Brien victorious.Davies (2011), pp.402-408 After the fight St. John tried to force a rematch with O'Brien and also put out challenges to some of England's best fighters, including Jem Smith, but none were accepted. With challengers thin on the ground St. John joined the British Army. During authorised leave, St. John was asked to take up the position of cornerman in a fight at a slaughterhouse in Aberdare between David Rees and Thomas Robert Edwards. The fight ended in tragedy when Rees was knocked out of the ring cracking his head on the stone floor. As the crowd fled, St. John remained behind in an attempt to revive the stricken Rees, but the fighter died before medical assistance arrived. Although St. John was cleared of any wrongdoing it cast a shadow over his career.Davies (2011), pp.409-410 His boxing career was saved when a call came out for a sparring partner for Australian heavyweight champion Peter Jackson who had recently arrived in London. St. John's name was mentioned and he travelled to London where he and Jackson struck up a strong relationship. His time spent with Jackson resulting in the improvement of St John's boxing skills and observers noted the St. John appeared more fluid when he brought Jackson to Pontypridd in an exhibition match. With St. John's career saved he continued to look for further fights in Wales. He fought James at least one more time, when the two met in Samuel's Saloon in Neath. St. John is reported to have been in poor shape going into the contest and James' superior fighting style put him in charge as the fight came to the end of its six-round distance. When the referee called the contest a draw, there was dissent from large portions of the crowd. Military history and death In September 1896, St. John joined the Grenadier Guards. In 1897 he was arrested for being absent without leave after leaving his post in London to fight in Cardiff. St. John was reported as being happy with life in the armed forces, he just found the restrictions connected with the job, limiting. In 1898, after time spent serving in Gibraltar, St. John was posted on a Nile Expedition. This led to him seeing action at the Battle of Omdurman in Sudan.Davies (2011), p.419 With the outbreak of the Second Boer War, St John was part of the 3rd Grenadier Guards sent to South Africa. On 23 November 1899, the 3rd Grenadier Guards were involved in the Battle of Belmont, and St John was amongst the troops pinned down at the base of Mount Belmont by Boer snipers on higher ground. When the decision was made to charge the position, St. John was at the forefront of his troop and engaged in hand-to-hand combat with the enemy. Reports vary widely, but it is stated that he killed between four and twelve combatants with his bayonet before his weapon became stuck in an enemy. On trying to retrieve his weapon he was shot in the temple and killed.

Because the attempt to create a Cisrhenian Republic foundered, the territories west of the Rhine were reorganized into several départements among the French first republic. After the allied victory over Napoleon in 1814 these territories were provisionally administered by the Central Administrative Departement (Zentralverwaltungsdepartement). The Sarre province and the district of Landau in der Pfalz previously French before the Napoleonic Wars were under the definitive act of the congress of Vienna ceded to the members of the coalition. The recent annexations done under the first republic were restituted. From these territories the Bavarian Circle of the Rhine (Rheinkreis) and the Hessian province of Rhenish Hesse (Rheinhessen) were formed in 1816. The regions to the north went to Prussia and were initially part of the two provinces of Jülich-Cleves-Berg and the Grand Duchy of the Lower Rhine, from which the Rhine Province emerged in 1822. The southern left Rhine territories, which had for centuries been under imperial rule in the Holy Roman Empire had been seized by France, mostly in the 17th century, were annexed to the new German empire in 1871, following France's defeat in the Franco-Prussian War. The region was consolidated as the Imperial Territory of Alsace-Lorraine for a period of 48 years (1871-1919), before being restituted to France in the wake of the First World War.  French Revolution By the late autumn of 1794 the French Revolution Army had occupied the left bank of the Rhine. The formal legal annexation of the territories was prepared at the preliminaries of Leoben (1797) and concluded at the treaties of Camp Formio (1797) and Lunéville (1801). At the Peace of Basel in 1795, the whole of the left bank of the Rhine was taken by France. The population was about 1.6 million in numerous small states. In 1806, the Rhenish princes all joined the Confederation of the Rhine, a puppet of Napoleon. France took direct control of the Rhineland until 1814 and radically and permanently liberalized the government, society and economy. The coalition of France's enemies made repeated efforts to retake the region, but France repelled all the attempts.T. C. W. Blanning, The French Revolution in Germany: Occupation and Resistance in the Rhineland 1792-1802 (1983) The French swept away centuries worth of outmoded restrictions and introduced unprecedented levels of efficiency. The chaos and barriers in a land divided and subdivided among many different petty principalities gave way to a rational, simplified, centralized system controlled by Paris and run by Napoleon's relatives. The most important impact came from the abolition of all feudal privileges and historic taxes, the introduction of legal reforms of the Napoleonic Code, and the reorganization of the judicial and local administrative systems. The economic integration of the Rhineland with France increased prosperity, especially in industrial production, while business accelerated with the new efficiency and lowered trade barriers. The Jews were liberated from the ghetto. There was limited resistance; most Germans welcomed the new regime, especially the urban elites, but one sore point was the hostility of the French officials toward the Roman Catholic Church, the choice of most of the residents.Hajo Holborn, A History of Modern Germany, 1648-1840 (1964) pp 386-87 The reforms were permanent. Decades later workers and peasants in the Rhineland often appealed to Jacobinism to oppose unpopular government programs, while the intelligentsia demanded the maintenance of the Napoleonic Code (which remained in effect for a century).Michael Rowe, \\"Between Empire and Home Town: Napoleonic Rule on the Rhine, 1799-1814,\\" Historical Journal (1999) 42#2 pp. 643-674 in JSTORMichael Rowe, From Reich to state: the Rhineland in the revolutionary age, 1780-1830 (2003)  Administrative structure  In 1798 the administration of the region was reorganized along French lines and it was divided into départements. The French Directory charged the Alsatian, François-Joseph Rudler, with this task and appointed him as the \\"General Ruling Commissar of All Conquered Lands between the Meuse and the Rhine and the Rhine and the Moselle\\". Rudler had hitherto been the judge at the Court of Cassation in Paris. His division of the region into four départements lasted until the end of the French period and consisted of: * Département de la Roer, Rur-Département (capital: Aachen), * Département de la Sarre, Saardépartement (capital: Trier), * Département de Rhin-et-Moselle, Département Rhein-Mosel (capital: Koblenz), * Département du Mont-Tonnerre, Département Donnersberg (capital: Mainz). An area in the South Palatinate was allocated to the: * Département Bas-Rhin (capital: Strasbourg).  Political changes  In addition to the centralization of the administration along French lines the rest of French law was introduced. That included the lifting of all estates-based privileges, the creation of egalitarianism, the establishment of a new judicial order and the introduction of the Napoleonic code. Ecclesiastical estates were secularised. Bound up with that was a fundamental restructuring of the land ownership and economic relationships. The primary beneficiaries were the ordinary citizens. Less successful was the area of educational politics. Instead of a reform of the universities, the French administration established specialist high schools. Criticism came from church-influenced counties as well as, during the Napoleonic period, from former German Jacobins. Whilst the former complained about secularisation, the later protested about the suppression of freedom. Resentment over military conscription was common throughout the population.Max Braubach: Von der französischen Revolution bis zum Wiener Kongress. Munich, 1974 pp.88f.  Linguistic relics of the French period  During the French period many French dialect words entered everyday speech, such as Plümo (feather bed), Filou, Monnie (money), Drottewaar (pavement). In Koblenz the term Schängel appeared, derived from the French Christian name Jean and (apparently pejoratively) referred to the French-fathered children of German mothers.

He held office as Chief Baron of the Irish Exchequer and Chief Justice of the Irish Common Pleas. After the change of the English royal dynasty in 1485 his loyalty to the Tudors was deeply suspect, and he was involved in two attempts to put a pretender on the English throne. On each occasion he was disgraced, fined and removed from office; yet he had sufficient political influence to ensure his return to favour and high office. He is principally remembered as the builder of the impressive Dunsoghly Castle, at Finglas, which still exists. He should not be confused with his uncle, Sir Thomas Fitz-Christopher Plunket.Ball, F. Elrington The Judges in Ireland 1221–1921 London John Murray 1926 Vol.1 p.186 Family He was born in County Meath, the only son of Sir Robert Plunket, who served briefly as Lord Chief Justice of Ireland in 1447, and his wife Genet Finglas.Ball 1926 p.186 Sir Robert was the fourth of the seven sons of Sir Christopher Plunket, who married the Cusack heiress , and was created 1st Baron Killeen in about 1426. Thomas was \\"bred to the law\\": his uncle Thomas was also Lord Chief Justice, and his extended family produced six senior judges over four generations. Career By 1480 Thomas had become a very wealthy man. He held extensive lands in County Dublin at Castleknock, Cabra and Finglas. It has been suggested that his father began the building of the main family residence, Dunsoghly Castle, at Finglas, but the weight of the evidence points to Thomas as the builder. Dunsoghly today is one of the few fifteenth-century Irish castles to remain intact, and the only one whose original timber roof survives.Ball, F. Elrington History of the Parishes of Dublin Vol.6 University Press Dublin 1920 p.65 Dunsoghly Castle Dunsoghly Castle He was appointed Chief Baron of the Exchequer in 1480 and Chief Justice of the Common Pleas two years later.Ball 1926 p.186 Lambert Simnel Lambert Simnel in Ireland In 1487 a priest called Richard Simon (or Symonds) appeared in Ireland with a young boy called Lambert Simnel, who due to a striking physical resemblance was able to impersonate Edward Plantagenet, 17th Earl of Warwick. As the nephew and direct male heir of the last two Yorkist Kings, the real Earl of Warwick (who was actually a prisoner in the Tower of London), had a much stronger claim to the English Crown than did Henry VII, who had only a remote claim to the Crown through his mother as the heir in the female line of John of Gaunt. The Anglo-Irish nobility were in general strongly Yorkist in sympathy, and they probably also saw the conflict as a chance to strengthen their own power at the Crown's expense. Gerald FitzGerald, 8th Earl of Kildare, the dominant magnate in Ireland, declared for Simnel, who was crowned King Edward VI in Christchurch Cathedral, Dublin. Ball remarks that most of the Irish judiciary followed Kildare \\"like sheep\\";Ball 1926 p.106 but Plunket played an active role in rallying support for Simnel, and as a result he was regarded by the Crown afterwards with particular mistrust.Ball 1926 p.186 Simnel, with about 4500 Irish troops, invaded England, but his army was crushed by the royal army at the Battle of Stoke Field. Henry VII was merciful in victory: Simnel was taken into the royal household as a kitchen boy, and later promoted to falconer, while Kildare and most of his fellow nobles were given a royal pardon. Aftermath of the Simnel rebellion The general pardon did not extend to Plunket, or to Sir James Keating, Prior of the Order of St John of Jerusalem at Kilmainham, since these two men. were regarded as \\"the prime instigators\\" of the rebellion.Voyage of Sir Richard Edgcumbe into Ireland in the Year 1488, printed by Harris Hibernica Dublin 1747 p.29 Sir Richard Edgcumbe, who was sent to Ireland in 1488 to accept the submission of the Irish nobles, refused, despite Kildare's pleas, to take oaths of homage or fealty from Plunket or Keating, \\"who were specially noted among the other chief causes of the Rebellion\\". Eventually, with great reluctance, Edgcumbe was persuaded to pardon Plunket, but he refused to pardon Keating, who was removed from office and died in poverty.Harris p.29 Plunket retained office, but he was never fully trusted again. Perkin Warbeck Perkin Warbeck In 1491 a second pretender to the English Crown, Perkin Warbeck, appeared in Ireland: he claimed to be Richard of Shrewsbury, younger son of King Edward IV of England. He received far less support than Simnel, (Kildare, prudently, refused to back him) but a small rising took place in which Plunket was implicated. He was removed from office and fined for \\"diverse seditions and transgressions\\" but not imprisoned.Ball 1920 p.64 His removal was part of a general purge of Kildare's supporters among the Irish judiciary: although Kildare had not made the mistake of supporting Warbeck, his loyalty was still deeply suspect. Warbeck reappeared in Ireland in 1495, but it is not known if Plunket had any further dealings with him. Last years In 1498, rather surprisingly, Plunket regained office as Chief Justice, probably at the request of Kildare, who had now been restored to Royal favour. In his last years on the Bench he held office jointly with Richard Delahide, who had married his granddaughter Jenet. He retired in 1515 and died in 1519.Ball 1926 p.186 An inventory of his possessions, taken in connection with the fine imposed on him in 1491, and which refers among many other items to \\"gilt salt cellars\\" and \\"coconut cups\\", confirms his great wealth. He was a noted benefactor of Christchurch Cathedral, presenting it with gifts of gold, silver and vestments, and assigning to the Cathedral Chapter his lands at Cabra subject to a life interest for himself and his second wife Helen.Ball 1920 p.65 Marriage and Children He married firstly Janet Finglas, and secondly Helen Strangwick.

He belonged to the royal Katur dynasty, which ruled the state from 1571 to 1969, until the Princely State of Chitral was merged to form District Chitral of the Provincially Administered Tribal Areas, Malakand Division, North West Frontier Province, Pakistan. His rule saw Chitral experience an extensive period of unwonted peace. He introduced widespread and far-reaching changes and administrative reforms. Shuja ul-Mulk rendered important services to the British Empire during the Third Anglo-Afghan War. He was invested as a Companion of the Most Eminent Order of the Indian Empire (CIE) by the British in 1903, and Knight Commander of the Most Eminent Order of the Indian Empire (KCIE) in 1919. He was granted a personal gun salute of 11 guns and the title of His Highness. Early life Mehtar Shuja ul-Mulk was born into the ruling family of Chitral in 1881. He was the second youngest son of Aman ul-Mulk, the ‘Great’ Mehtar of Chitral, who ruled the state from 1857 to 1892, during which the state reached its territorial peak.Ghufran, Mirza Tareekh-e-Chitral Shuja ul-Mulk’s mother was a princess, the daughter of the Khan of Asmar. Political turmoil and provisional recognition The Chitral Fort from across the river with its towers visible (1895). When Mehtar Aman ul-Mulk died in 1892, a long war of succession broke out between his sons, with Umra Khan of Jandol and Sher Afzul in the background, which lasted three years. During his father's life-time, Nizam ul-Mulk was the acknowledged heir to the throne. However Afzal ul-Mulk happened to be at Chitral on the momentous date while Nizam was absent and in Yasin. Afzal promptly seized all the arms and treasure in the fort of Chitral, and proclaimed himself Mehtar, and then proceeded to murder his brothers whom he saw as potential contenders to the throne. Meanwhile, he also addressed letters to the Viceroy of India and to the British Foreign Secretary, announcing the death of his father, and his own accession to the Mehtarship, with the consent of the people and of his brothers. However, after a reign of just a few months he was killed by his uncle Sher Afzul, who coming up stealthily from Kabul, attacked the fort by night and slew him. During this period Nizam ul-Mulk had been the guest of the British at Gilgit, and induced the belief amongst the Chitralis that his bid for sovereignty was backed by the force of British arms. Once Nizam returned from Gilgit he succeeded in ousting Sher Afzul who once again fled to Kabul. Nizam is believed to be an agreeable man, cultivated with many European tastes, but that was hardly helpful for his cause. Nizam ul-Mulk was murdered on 1 January 1895, while on a hunting tour, by his ungrateful brother, Amir ul-Mulk, whose life he had spared. The stimulated Amir, sent a deputation to Lieutenant Bertrand Gurdon, then Resident Political Officer in Chitral, asking to be recognised as Mehtar, but was told that the orders of the British Government must be awaited. On 8 January 1895, 50 men of the 14th Sikhs marched down from Mastuj to join Gurdon in Chitral. On 1 February the British Agent arrived from Gilgit over the Shandur Pass, with an escort commanded by then Captain Townshend of Central India Horse, composed of 280 men of the 4th Kashmir Rifles i.e. Imperial Service Troops and 33 men of the 14th Sikhs under Lieutenant Harley. Their purpose was to give support to Gurdon, prevent blood spill from engulfing the British officers in Chitral and impede falling of the Mehtarship into hostile hands. Characteristically there were no cannons, with the advancing group, had there been, there would have been no subsequent siege. However hearing that Umra Khan had taken Kila Drosh, been joined by Sher Afzul, was in complicity with Amir and inching towards Chitral, Sir George Scott Robertson moved the British forces into the Chitral fort out of necessity. Shuja ul-Mulk at age 12 appeared intelligent, took keen interest in all matters of state and was said to have a natural kingliness of manner, with a sedative gravity. Thus at a durbar on 2 March 1895, Sir George declared that subject to the approval of the Government of India, Shuja ul-Mulk was recognised as Mehtar. Shuja's fate, thereon, was tied to that of the few British officers around him. Captain Townshend for whom he seemed to have real affection was made responsible for his personal safety and security. Shuja ul- Mulk was nicknamed by the British troops, ‘Sugar and Milk’. The enemy strength was computed to be around 1200 men. On 4 March the enemy closed in around the fort and the siege began, with the Chitralies compelled to join Sher Afzul for well-founded fear of their families. Inside the fort the British considered the stocks, put everyone on half ration and calculated that they could hold out for two and a half months or about the middle of June.  Siege of Chitral and accession  The Chitral Fort (1895) The narrative of the events in Chitral traveled far and wide, and obligated an intervention to maintain British prestige and restore morale. The British met in Calcutta and resolved to break the siege by military force. For the relief of the besieged, the 1st Division of Field Army under Major General Sir Robert Low, with General Bindon Blood as his Chief of Staff was mobilized. In the meantime news reached the Government of India of the misfortune which befell the team of Captain Ross & Lieutenant Jones and the detachment of Lieutenant Edward and Fowler. Thus increasing the urgency to act and necessitated the involvement of Colonel James Graves Kelly, commanding the 32nd Sikh Pioneers Gilgit to march to the relief from the north. The Division under Sir Robert Low consisting of 15,000 troops, assembled into three infantry brigades and with some 30,000 mules, horses and camels had by this time marched over the Malakand Pass into Swat and Dir. They were met by heavy resistance and engaged into fighting by the local tribesmen, but were on their way to Chitral. At the same time, with 400 soldiers from the 32nd Sikh Pioneers and a 2 gun section of No.1 Kashmir Mountain Battery. And a 1,000 levies used as porters, Colonel Kelly marched over the 12,000 feet Shandur Pass in freezing cold temperature and deep snow. On 18 April 1895 the column reached Koghazi where Colonel Kelly received a letter from Sir George who was then in Chitral, informing him that the besieging force of Sher Afzul and Umra Khan had withdrawn and the siege of Chitral fort had ended. The advance of Kelly’s column with the more distant threat of Sir Robert Low's relieving force from the South had forced the abandonment of the siege. On 20 April 1895 Colonel Kelly's column marched into Chitral. In the light of information that the situation in Chitral had normalised General Robert Low, halted the full advance and ordered then Brigadier General Gatacre to press on with a small column over the Lowari Pass to Chitral. On 15 May 1895 General Gatacre reached Chitral, with Sir Robert Low joining him the next day. Shuja presented Sir Robert and officers of the 2nd Battalion of the IV Gorkha Rifles with a cannon gun left over by Sher Afzul. In the meantime Shuja ul-Mulk was permanently installed as the Mehtar of Chitral, at a darbar held at the Chitral Fort on 2 September 1895.  The issue of retention  Following the relief of Chitral and coronation of Shuja ul-Mulk as Mehtar, the question of future policy confronted the Government of India. Two alternatives presented themselves: either the British could, \\"abandon the attempt to keep up an effective control over Chitral or they could put a sufficient garrison there\\". As far as Shuja was concerned, a sudden pull out by the British would create a power vacuum and set the stage for further belligerence in the state of which he had just assumed rulership. It would also, undoubtedly place his life in great jeopardy. Military experts were divided as to the aptness of each course. Lord Roberts lent his support to the advocates of retention. Arrayed against him were formidable military authorities, such as Sir Donald Stewart, Sir Neville Chamberlain, Sir John Adye, Sir Charles Gough and Lord Chelmsford. In hindsight the danger of an attack upon India from Russia in 1895 were infinitesimal. The Viceroy's Executive Council decided unanimously that to maintain British influence in Chitral was \\"a matter of first importance\\". On 13 June 1895, however, Lord Rosebery's Cabinet replied firmly that no military force or British agent should be kept at Chitral, that Chitral should not be fortified and that no road should be made between Peshawar and Chitral. They repudiated the forward policy which had been consistently followed since 1876. But in the nick of time the Liberal Government fell and Lord Salisbury's Cabinet reversed their decision. Thus the retention of Chitral was sanctioned and the road which that sanction necessitated was completed. Chitral was to be a part sovereign state, her internal affairs were left entirely in the hands of Mehtar Shuja ul-Mulk and his advisers. The Government of India was to conduct and have control over all foreign relations. However the areas of Mastuj and Laspur were taken away and placed under independent governors by the British. A British garrison was installed at Chitral consisting of two Indian infantry regiments, a company of Sapper and Miners from the Indian Army Corps of Engineers and a battery of mountain artillery. Garrisons of local levies numbering 200 in all and armed with Snider–Enfield rifles were installed in detachment's across Lower Chitral. It was promised that Shuja ul-Mulk as Mehtar would received a monthly subsidy of 1,000 Indian rupees and an annual payment of 8,000 rupees to compensate him for the loss of the 2 districts. One of Shuja's first act as Mehtar was to announce a general amnesty for all, who had taken part in the rebellion.  Powers as Mehtar  Mehtar Shuja ul-Mulk reigned under a Council of Regency until he came of age and was invested with full ruling powers. His powers as Mehtar, in theory at least were most despotic, as Lord Curzon had noted in his diary. As Mehtar, he was supreme in judicial, legislative as well as in executive authority.  Formation of Chitral Scouts (1903)  On the invitation of the British, Shuja ul-Mulk in 1903, collaborated to create the Chitral Scouts, a native force which could serve in the defence of the land. Initially the force consisted of 1,000 men serving under two British officers, however with the passage of time the strength increased manifolds. The scouts served as local cragsmen, guarding passes and deterring outsiders. In contrast to the State Bodyguards the Chitral Scouts received extensive training and better quality weapons.  Formalisation of State Bodyguard Force (1909)  Since the time of Aman ul-Mulk an informal para-military force existed. In 1909 the force was formalised and came to consist of 6 companies, each with 110 men, thus the State Bodyguard Force came into being. Shuja ul-Mulk as Mehtar was to be the Chief Commander of the force. With the passage of time the force grew so as to include as many as 40 companies consisting of over 4,000 strong men. The force played a vital role in the defence of Chitral during the Anglo-Afghan War of 1919.  Legal Reforms  For centuries the seat of the Mehtar was at the helm of the judicial system. According to Colonel John Biddulph \\"The administration of justice was practically the will of the ruler, though nominally the precepts of the Shariyat are observed\\". Nonetheless it would be wrong to assume that all disputes were resolved through executive fiat or were the result of the Mehtar flaunting his prerogative. The vast majority of cases were resolved under Islamic or customary law. Until the death of Aman ul-Mulk in 1892, there existed no department of justice. Civil disputes were resolved by the Mehtar after consultation with his aids in open court. Whereas criminal matter were ordinarily decided by a jury of Muslim theologians. Judicial Council In 1909, as part of an effort to reorganise the judicial system, the Judicial Council, locally known as the Kausal was established by Shuja ul-Mulk. Composed of up to 10 notables at a time, the body heard both civil and criminal petitions. Case were by and large decided in light of customary law and executive precedents. Sub-committees of the Judicial Council were set-up at local level from where an appeal would lie to the principal seat and ultimately the Mehtar. It was not necessary for a petitioner to navigate the cumbersome judicial hierarchy, as the Mehtar could be petitioned directly in appropriate cases. Mizan-e-Shariah The same year Shuja established the Mizan-e-Shariah (‘Scales of the Shariah’), a body that would try cases which were to be decided under Islamic law. The Chief Justice of this court was known as the Qazi-ul-Quza and was assisted by 4 or 5 reputable theologians, all appointed by the Mehtar. As a convention Shuja made it a point not to disagree with the Mizan or the Judicail Councils verdicts except in extraordinary circumstances. In such cases the documentation would be returned to the respective court for reconsideration. Prior to these reforms no documentation of civil or criminal cases were maintained. Whereas following them both the courts accepted written petitions and maintained a record of the same. In 1915 stamped paper was introduced and thereafter a documentation of all judicial proceedings was maintained.  Re-integration of Mastuj and Laspur  Following his accession to the throne the District of Mastuj and Laspur had been taken away from Chitral and placed under independent British Governors. Shuja was determined from his very accession to get them back as he justifiably considered them part of Chitral. During his visit in 1899 to India he took up his plea with Viceroy Lord Curzon and persisted in his demand until the Government handed over Mastuj and Laspur to him under an agreement on 13 May 1914.  Efforts to reclaim Yasin  After the control of Mastuj and Laspur reverted to Shuja ul-Mulk, he supplicated the British authorities to hand over the areas of Yasin to him, as Yasin was a part of Chitral during the reign of Aman ul-Mulk and had later been disjoined. However Maharaja Ranbir Singh of Kashmir the successor of Gulab Singh was adamantly opposed to the idea and wished for Yasin to remain as a buffer between his dominion and the Mehtars territory. British administrators considered the Maharajas reservations perfectly justifiable. Shuja ul-Mulk’s requests after having been given the fullest of considerations could not be acceded to as acknowledging his reversionary interest in these districts could potentially lead to conflict between Chitral and Kashmir.  Third Anglo-Afghan War (1919)  The Mehtar of Chitral Sir Shuja ul-Mulk and the Chief Commissioner of the North West Frontier Province Sir George Roos-Keppel at Peshawar (1919). In 1919 Amanullah Khan the Emir of Afghanistan broke off his relations with British and declared war. India was attacked at different fronts including Chitral. Shuja ul-Mulk received an offer to switch sides on 8 May 1919, however he rejected the offer and kept his side of the pact with the British intact. The Chitral Scouts and Chitral State Bodyguards under the command of Nasir ul-Mulk fought valiantly and immobilised the Afghan attack. Shuja ul-Mulk was Knighted in 1919 by being invested as a Knight Commander of the Most Eminent Order of the Indian Empire (KCIE). A year later he was granted the title of His Highness and entitled to a personal salute of 11 guns. The Government of India presented him with 2,000 .303 Lee–Enfield rifles and a large stock of ammunition in recognition of his loyalty. A further consignment of 300 rifles were presented to him in 1925, with almost 700 more in 1927. In 1929 he received two cannons as gift from the British. Reign (1895-1936) Mehtar Shuja ul-Mulk reigned under a Council of Regency until he came of age and was invested with full ruling powers. He ruled for 41 years, during which Chitral enjoyed an unprecedented period of internal peace. He visited various parts of India and met a number of fellow rulers. In the winter of 1899-1900, Shuja ul- Mulk in company of the Chief of the Gilgit Agency visited the Viceroy of India at Calcutta. It was the first of a series of visits which immensely enlarged his mental horizon. In May 1902, the Mehtar was present at the Vice-Regal Durbar at Peshawar. He was invited to the Delhi Durbar and attended the Coronation Durbar at Delhi in 1903 where he was invested as a Companion of the Most Eminent Order of the Indian Empire (C.I.E). In 1903 the Commander-in- Chief of India Lord Kitchener who was making a personal inspection of India's mountain frontiers, in the company of General Hubert Hamilton and Sir William Birdwood visited Chitral. Shuja ul-Mulk extended to them a very warm reception. Upon the former's suggestion the Mehtar commissioned the laying of a telegraphy line between Chitral and Gilgit. During the cold weather of 1904-1905 he visited India again and the following year he met His Royal Highness the Prince of Wales George Frederick Albert (later George V) at a garden party at Government House Peshawar. He paid an informal visit to Simla in September 1907 for ten days and was granted an interview with His Excellency Lord Minto. Shuja ul-Mulk attended His Majesty the King Emperors Durbar at Delhi in 1911 and received there the Delhi Durbar Medal. In 1911 Shuja ordered Mirza Muhammad Ghufran to write a book documenting the history of Chitral for which he received considerable tracts of land in different parts of the state. The Tarikh-i-Chitral was written in Persian, compiled and finalized in 1921. It is a landmark work for the history of Chitral and the Hindu Kush region. In May 1918 Sir George Roos-Keppel visited Chitral in an effort to rally support of the Mehtar should war breakout on the frontier. In so visiting, Sir George Keppel became the first Chief Commissioner of the North-West Frontier Province to do so. He was received with great hospitality and returned much enthralled by the Mehtar's assurances. In 1919, in recognition of his loyalty and services during the recently concluded Third Anglo-Afghan War, Shuja ul-Mulk was granted a personal salute of 11-guns, along with a Knighthood by being appointed Knight Commander of the Most Eminent Order of the Indian Empire, with the title of His Highness following in 1920. The salute and title were made permanent and hereditary to his successors in 1932. In 1921 Shuja ul-Mulk visited India and met the Prince of Wales Edward Patrick David (later Edward VII) on the latters visit to Ajmer that November. He spent two days at the Viceregal Lodge Delhi, as the guest of Viceroy Lord Reading. He went on to visit Indore, Bombay before arriving at Jammu where he was received at a formal Durbar by the Maharaja of Kashmir Pratap Singh and treated as a state guest. In 1923 Lord Rawlinson the Commander-in-Chief of India while undertaking a trip to the northern outposts of India visited Chitral as a state guest of the Mehtar. In 1923-1924, Shuja ul-Mulk went on a pilgrimage to Arabia where he visited Mecca and offered the Hajj. The trip commenced in November 1923, with Shuja leaving Chitral and visiting en route Peshawar, Delhi and Bombay. Embarking at Bombay, he proceeded to Basra, Baghdad, Jerusalem, Jeddah, Mecca and Medina. At Medina he remained the guest of King Hussein. He returned to Chitral in August 1924. That year Field Marshal Sir William Birdwood visited Chitral and was entertained as a state guest of the Mehtar. The same year, Islamia College's student elected body (the Khyber Union), granted honorary life-membership to Shuja ul-Mulk. Shuja was on friendly terms with Sir Sahibzada Abdul Qayyum who had previously served as Assistant Political Agent in Chitral. Upon encouragement from the latter Shuja had made a contribution of Rs 20,000 towards the setting up of the institution, with encouragement from the latter, he began participating in the growth of the institution. When time permitted he presided over meetings of the Trustees of Islamia College. Shuja was elected President of the Islamia College Management Body and visited the institution in that capacity in 1928 and 1931. In 1926 Shuja ul-Mulk attended the Vice Regal Durbar at Peshawar. He visited India again in 1928 with his visit lasting from 8 October to 1 December that year. During this visit he was accompanied by the Assistant Political Agent Chitral. Shuja began his tour by visiting Swat where he was entertained as a guest of the Wali at Saidu. He proceeded to Peshawar where he remained a guest of Sir Norman Bolton before embarking for Rampur upon the invitation of His Highness the Nawab of Rampur Sir Hamid Ali Khan. Shuja also visited the Prince of Wales Royal Indian Military College at Dehradun where he enrolled his younger sons for private education. At Delhi he was accorded an interview with Viceroy Lord Irwin. In November 1931, he visited India again and held a meeting with Viceroy Freeman Thomas, the Marquess of Willingdon regarding the Government of Indias policy towards the North West Frontiers. Upon return to Peshawar he stayed a considerable time in the city holding talks with Sir Ralph Griffith before returning to Chitral via air on 27 April 1932.  Reforms  Following his accession Shuja ul-Mulk, guided by his mother and the Commissioned Indian Officers, began introducing widespread and comprehensive reforms.  Land Records  From 1898, Shuja ul-Mulk with assistance from the British, reorganized the state’s finance machinery. For the first time, the record of all lands and land owners along with the rate at which they were liable to pay revenue to the state was documented in a register. The documentation ensured that tax evasion did not go unnoticed by the state. The register also contained details of state lands allotted to tenant farmers for sharecropping.  Minerals  Much interest was shown by Shuja in exploiting the mineral resources of the state. He employed entire families to pan the Chitral river for gold dust, the cash generated went to the state coffers. Other minerals extracted included orpiment, silver, lead, antimony, crystallised quartz, iron ore, copper and potassium nitrate. The mineral exports, particularly exports of orpiment to China, proved lucrative and turned in a handsome profit. By 1914, export of orpiment fetched an average of 20,000 Kabulis.  Octori  In the summers, when snow cleared over the Dorah Pass and Lowari Pass, goods of various kind were brought over these passes to Chitral. Traders carting merchandise into and out of the Chitral, as well as those in transit, were historically required to pay a tax known as octroi. The collection of octori was regulated. By 1919, octori was fetching the state earnings of almost 4,000 Indian rupees annually. This increased in subsequent years and between 1932 and 1936, for instance, the average annual income from octroi stood at 19,680 rupees. State officials collecting the tax were required to issue printed receipts to merchants, this measure disallowed corruption.  Slavery  Towards the end of the 19th century, young, attractive man and women could be bought and sold for about 300 Kabulis, whereas children could fetch anything from 100 to 300 Kabulis. The practice of slave trade had declined in the 1880s, Amir Abdur Rahman Khan of Afghanistan during his reign (1878-1901), had banned slavery and closed down the slave market in Kabul Province. However, in British India the slave trade legally continued until 1895 before it was banned by the British colonial administration.  Fines  Chitral during the reign of Shuja ul-Mulk, as his predecessors, was by and large a law- abiding society, crime rate was meager. Fines collected went to the aggrieved person or family and were meant to serve as compensation.Shuja decreed that a certain portion of the fines collected would go to the exchequer.  Ushr  The concept of ushr (tithe) had subsisted, in certain pockets of Chitral, for some time. After consulting state theologians, Shuja ul-Mulk in 1910 took the concept to scale and imposed ushr on a variety of agrarian produce. This new tax was fervidly resisted, particularly in the Ismaili majority Mastuj region. Nevertheless, it was forcibly imposed throughout Chitral by 1918. The grains collected went into state granaries, with the revenue department keeping a record of what had been accumulated. State officials, including the Bodyguard Force received grains from the ushr stock.The records of 1928 reveal that 6,610 maunds of stocks lay in state granaries that year. Following the Siege of Chitral there was permanent British military presence in Chitral. Naturally the forces needed food supplies and initially these were sent over the Lowari Pass. It was soon realised that the cost of conveyance was too exorbitant. Eventually, the British authorities in 1902, awarded the Mehtar the contract to supply the troops. With the passage of time this arrangement earned the state a substantial income which, between 1932 and 1936, averaged 218,800 Rupees annually.  Narcotics  In the 19th century traffic in narcotics was not state regulated. In 1902 a warehouse was established at Boroghil. A fraction of the cannabis and opium shipments were consumed in Chitral with the bulk being sold in markets as far afield as Kabul, Peshawar, Lahore and Bombay. By 1928 the Mehtar was earning 30,000 Rupees annually from the narcotics trade. In later years, cannabis and opium were locally cultivated in Chitral and thus the local produce further added to state revenue.  Timber  Timber trade with Afghanistan had begun in the 19th century. Since the Mehtar enjoyed de facto rights over all forests of Chitral, the revenue generated accrued to the treasury. During the reign of Aman ul-Mulk the trade was at its flourishing best and sometimes earned the state up to 40,000 Kabulis annually. Aware of the value of timber, Shuja ul-Mulk established a Forestry Department in 1908. The department regulated not only the timber trade but also introduced measures to control the use of timber locally, including the imposition of a tax on firewood. Trade in timber continued under Shuja ul-Mulk. However it came to a complete halt following the Anglo-Afghan War of 1919, with sales plummeting. This situation persisted for rest of Shuja's reign.  Markets and shops  To cater to the growing market Shuja ul-Mulk ordered the building of new shops and caravanserais. Officer were appointed to regulate the supply of goods and prices. The new shops built in Chitral, Lot Kuh and Drosh brought in plenty of revenue for the state.  Tailor house  Until the 20th century, the Mehtars wardrobe contained local dress, made from local fabric only. This gradually changed with Shuja ul-Mulk who in 1914 employed no less than 12 tailors, setting up a tailoring house which would import fabric and prepare dresses for the Mehtar and the royal household. In addition to a tailoring house, Shuja set up a state laundry, near the Chitral Fort. It handled the wear of the royal family and the uniforms of the State Bodyguards.  Education  Education received greater official patronage under Shuja ul-Mulk. Chitral, Drosh, Drasun, Lot Kuh, Mastuj and Shagram saw the establishment of elementary school for boys. Religion and Persian literature were the main subjects being taught here. The state provide grain and other finances to these educational institutes. Shuja ul-Mulk also sent his sons to far off places such as Peshawar, Aligarh and Dehradun to receive modern education.  Healthcare  Rampant epidemics and ailments such as hepatitis, cholera, typhoid and tuberculosis claimed a multitude of lives in Chitral each year. Shuja's rule saw the establishment a hospital in Chitral and another in Drosh. In these hospitals the services of qualified doctors, paramedics and pharmaceutical medicines could be availed.  Telegraph and Telephone  The prospect of setting up a telegraphy line between Chitral and headquarters of neighbouring Gilgit was discussed in 1892, during the life of Aman ul-Mulk. Following the Chitral Expedition an experimental telegraph line was installed over the Lowari. In 1903, during the reign of Shuja ul-Mulk, Chitral and Gilgit were connected via telegraph. In the next year or so telegraph and telephone were set up across the breath of the state connecting all headquarters. Thus the telephone became an integral part of the state machinery in conducting the affairs of the state. It is said that Shuja spent his early evenings on the telephone relaying and relieving messages from distant administrative units of the state to keep himself abreast. To operate and repair the machinery, technicians were called in from India.  Postal service  After 1892, the British began to improve communications within Chitral and in 1895 a regular postal service was launched. Thereafter, state correspondence became a daily routine.  Levy Company  Shuja ul-Mulk also organised a small force known as the Levy Company, consisting of barely over a hundred men, the forces sole responsibility was to protect state postal service. Although small the task the force performed was invaluable for the state.  Irregulars  Aware that the task of guarding the border with Afghanistan was too herculean even for the two regular state forces i.e. Chitral Scouts & Chitral State Bodyguards, Shuja ul-Mulk armed the villagers of Urtsun, Ashurait, Domel, Langurbat and Arnawai with rifles and ammunition to patrol and guard the southern forested border of Chitral. This Irregular force known as the Ashurait-Domelnisar Company unlike the other two state forces received local training, however owing to their special knowledge of the locality were best equipped to deal with intruders.  Intelligence service  Until the reign of Shuja ul-Mulk the only means of flushing out criminals was the concept of collective responsibility. The carrot and stick diplomacy was deployed, whereby citizens on the one end were offered incentives and on the other coerced with sanctions into revealing the identity of criminals. This concept endured in the days of Shuja but was supplemented with a Secret Intelligence Service. The service had its informants in almost each village who would report to the capital. It is believed that the step lowered crime rate.  Routine  Shuja ul-Mulk's typical day as Mehtar would commence with the rising sun and offering of morning prayers. Breakfast would soon follow, traditionally a few selected nobles would be invited to this exclusive gathering. Following breakfast, he would attend to matters of state. Important mail would be drawn to the Mehtar's attention early in the day. Shuja would dictate a reply, which his secretary would jolt down to prepare a draft. The draft would be shown to him the following morning and might be approved, reworded or redrafted where after only, Shuja would affix his signature. However some letters were handled quite differently with the letters being read out aloud in open court to elicit the opinion of notables and tribal chiefs prior to preparing a response. In the morning hours of the day, time was reserved for individual petitioners. Citizens of every class irrespective of gender or status were permitted audience with their ruler. Those who could not plead their case in the morning could do so later in the afternoon. In spite of his immense supremacy Shuja was remarkably accessible. Shuja ul-Mulk would spend a good part of his early evenings on the telephone, relaying and receiving messages from various parts of the state, to keep himself abreast of local developments, after which he would attend the Mahraka. Conforming to generation old tradition, Shuja ul-Mulk would have his afternoon and evening meals at a gathering attended by nobles and elders called the Mahraka. It was considered highly coveted for anyone to be invited to this congregation, which the Mehtar would preside over. The Mahrakah was a decorous event, where meals would be followed by prolonged discussions on serious state matters.  Hobbies and interests  A love of sport, characteristic of the peoples of the Hindu Kush, was shared by the Mehtar. Shooting, falconry, polo, chess, and listening to singing accompanied on the sitar, all came within the ambit of his relaxations. Falconry was his favorite sport, and he was very proud of the unrivaled skill of his falconers.  Marriage of States  Shuja ul-Mulk was empathetic to the idea of inter-state and royal intermarriages, for strategic and political purposes. His sister was married to Miangul Abdul Khaliq, the grandfather of the Wali of Swat. She acted as de facto ruler of Swat for many years after the death of her husband. Another one of his sisters was married to the Nawab of Dir. His daughter was married to Naqibzada Pir Sayyid Jamal ud-din Al-Gilani, a direct descendant of Abdul Qadir Gilani, patronym of the Qadiriyya order. His granddaughter was married to Nawab Muhammad Said Khan, the Nawab of Amb.  Controversy  For several centuries, the heterogeneous society of Sunnis, Shia Ismailis and the Kalash had lived together in harmony without any overt hostilities. However tension arose between Shuja ul-Mulk and his Ismaili subjects. In 1910, Shuja imposed statewide ushur tax, which was most bellicosely opposed by the Ismaili community. In 1917, the community launched a movement to resist the tax, which was remorselessly put down in Mastuj with state brutality. Bulbul Shah, the religious figure at the forefront of the movement was exiled and forced to migrate to Afghanistan. Upshot of all this was the cultivation of mistrust amongst the Ismaili community who regarding themselves as having been persecuted and felt inclined to resolve disputes within the community without involving state authorities, much to the Mehtar's annoyance. This generated reciprocal skepticism in Shuja who suspected the Ismaili leaders of spying on him on behalf of Gilgit and Badakhshan. In 1923, the misgivings were further fueled when an Ismaili missionary from India by the name of Sabz Ali travelled to Chitral and instructed the community to continue to have its disputes resolved under the community’s own auspices. Perceiving this as an omen of insurrection Shuja gave the orders to forcibly convert Ismailis to Sunnis, thus leading to even wider unrest. The Mehtar had completely misjudged the situation and was treading down a muddy path. Eventually the British authorities intervened and persuaded Shuja to put a halt to the persecution. An inquiry was conducted under Major Hopkinson, which submitted a detailed report. Reconciliation was brought about between Shuja and leaders of the Ismaili community by the efforts of the Political Agent Malakand Agency. In 1926, Shuja at the behest of the British declared an amnesty for all Ismailis, the matter was laid to rest. While it is true that following his pilgrimage to Mecca in 1923-1924, Shuja became more religious. It is hard to conceive his intentions in persecuting the Ismailis as being religiously motivated given the paradox that at that time other religious communities such as the Kalash, Sikh and Hindues resided in Chitral as well. Sikhs and Hindus, had and were allowed to retain, their monopoly in trade and commerce. And there are no reported incidents of state persecution directed against them. Describing him in 1937, Bertrand Gurdon wrote,\\"Shuja ul-Mulk was a devout Sunni, and made the pilgrimage to Mecca in 1924, but bigotry and fanaticism found little place in his character.\\" Titles and Honours Order of the Indian Empire *His Highness *Knight Commander of the Most Eminent Order of the Indian Empire (KCIE) *Companion of the Most Eminent Order of the Indian Empire (CIE) *11 gun salute *Hon.

On 16–18 July 1914, he flew Australia's first air mail and air freight flight, from Melbourne to Sydney. During his time in Australia he also gave many aerial displays, was the first person to fly a seaplane in Australia, and was an early user of Ham Common, now RAAF Base Richmond. Early life Ernest François Guillaux was born 24 January 1883 in Montoire, France. His father was a wheelwright, and he also worked in this trade; he married Héloïse Anne-Marie Langot, a farmer's daughter, in 1901. Little more is known about him until 1912, when he became well known as a pilot, using the name ‘Maurice’. Nelson Eustis, famous philatelist and amateur historian, made contact in 1964 with a son, Bernard, then about 62 years old. Career in France On 19 February 1912, he obtained his pilot's licence, no 749. He became the chief pilot for the firm Caudron de Croty (Somme). From April onwards, he participated in many aviation displays. He was often able to fly in weather that was too severe for other pilots, but did crash on 29 April when his aircraft was caught by a strong wind gust at a display at Montoire. He flew, with a passenger, to England after this. On his return, in August 1912 he became chief pilot for the Clément-Bayard organisation, flying its all-metal monoplanes made in their factory at Levallois-Perret. From time to time, he held various records, for example at Étampes, on 11 February 1913, when he flew 410 km in 4 hours 10 minutes with a passenger. He also gained his military flying licence at about this time.Researches of M André Mihel, Municipal Counsellor for Tourism, Culture and Heritage at Montoire The Pommery Cup was awarded, twice a year, to the airman who flew the greatest distance, measured in a straight line, in one day. On 28 April Guillaux secured the prize by flying from Biarritz to Kollum in the Netherlands, a distance of 1 253 kilomètres.Flight 7 June 1913 p 629 His main rival was Brindejonc des Moulinais. In the next competition for the cup, Guillaux had an irregularity in his record-keeping, and as a result was suspended from competition for ten years.Flight 15 November 1913 page 1258 He then purchased a Bleriot XI aircraft, especially prepared for aerobatics, known as a ‘looper’ in which he performed during December and January.Flight magazine, January 31, 1914, page 124 With four companions, listed on the passenger manifest as Messrs Rupeausseu, Maistre, Cominos and du Coque, he then departed on a world tour.Eustis, H N, Fifty Years of Australian Airmails, first published 16 July 1964, limited reprint 2013 by Aviation Historical Society of Australia, , page 3 Arrival in Australia The party arrived in Sydney early in April, and spent the first fortnight assembling the Bleriot. His first flying display was given at Victoria Park, Zetland, Sydney, on 19 April 1914,The Sydney Morning Herald, Tuesday 21 April 1914, page 7 followed by a display at Newcastle on 25 April.Evening News (Sydney), Saturday 25 April 1914, page 1 He was immediately received in the highest circles of Australian society, being officially welcomed to Sydney by the Lord Mayor on 28 April.The Sydney Morning Herald, Monday 4 May 1914, page 9 During May and June he also performed in Melbourne, in regional centres such as Wagga Wagga, Albury, Bendigo, Ballarat, Geelong, and Bathurst and in Adelaide. These displays were hugely successful: hundreds of thousands of people paid to see him fly.Parnell, P and Boughton, N, Flypast, AGPS, Canberra, 1988, page 11 He was received at Government House, Melbourne, and actually landed and took off from its grounds.The Register (Adelaide), Friday 29 May 1914, page 8 Seaplane flights Lebbeus Hordern, a member of the wealthy family which owned the Sydney department store Anthony Horderns, imported a Maurice Farman 'hydro- aeroplane' in 1914. It was the first seaplane in Australia. Its 70-horsepower Renault engine enabled a maximum speed of 60 miles-per-hour. Wingspan was about 57 feet, 17.3 metres, it was about 35 feet, 10.6 metres long, and weighed about 1680 pounds, 760 Kilograms. It could carry ‘two seventeen-stone passengers’ or three passengers of lesser weight. Lebbeus Hordern enlisted the services of Guillaux and his team to assemble and test fly the aircraft, and on May 8, 1914, Maurice Guillaux flew the Farman for the first time.The Sydney Morning Herald , Saturday 9 May 1914, page 23 Over the next few days he made many flights carrying passengers including the owner of the aircraft and Miss Louise Carbasse, then a 19-year-old Australian actress. After the war, she became a well-known Hollywood actress under the name of Louise Lovely.http://tlweb.latrobe.edu.au/humanities/screeningthepast/22/early- cinema-aviation.html On 22 May Guillaux and Lebbeus Hordern announced their intention to fly the seaplane from Sydney to Melbourne, but this flight was never attempted. Guillaux also announced his intention to remain permanently in Australia, making his home in Sydney. He had purchased some more aircraft that would arrive in about three months.The West Australian (Perth), Saturday 23 May 1914, page 11 Melbourne-Sydney mail flight On May 13 the American aviator 'Wizard' Stone announced plans to fly mail from Melbourne to Sydney, with a flight date proposed 'on or about' 23 May. This was delayed until June 6, but on June 1 Stone crashed in Rockhampton, Queensland, while racing against an automobile. He was injured and his aircraft was badly damaged. Guillaux took over the air mail project. He took off on his journey from Flemington showgrounds, Melbourne at 9:12 am on 16 July 1914, and landed in fields at Seymour and Wangaratta before entering New South Wales, reaching Albury racecourse at 12 50 pm. Here he had lunch with compatriot Alderman Frere before flying on to Wagga Wagga and then to Harden at 4 06 pm. Trying to fly on, he was forced back by bad weather, In one day he had flown about 575 kilometres, giving aerobatic displays over each town to entertain the huge crowds that greeted him at every stop. On 17 July he was again forced to return to Harden because of weather, but on 18 July he was able to move on to Goulburn. This was a freezing winter morning, for which Goulburn is infamous, and when he landed he rushed to the beacon fire to thaw out. He flew on, missing a planned landing at Moss Vale, but landing just behind the main street of Liverpool. After lunch with the locals, he took off in time to arrive at Moore Park, in central Sydney, by 2 50 pm. Here he was received by a huge crowd, including the Governor-General. A band played the Marseillaise and he handed over his cargo. There were 1785 postcards and special messages such as those from the Governor and the French Consul in Victoria to their counterparts in New South Wales. A packet of Liptons Tea and some OT lemon cordial were also carried; this was Australia's first air freight. This was, at the time, the longest air mail flight anywhere in the world.Eustis, H N, Fifty Years of Australian Airmails, first published 16 July 1964, limited reprint 2013 by Aviation Historical Society of Australia, , pages 5–15 After the air mail flight The flight created a sensation.

He and Lebbeus Hordern had intended to expand their fleet and establish a major base here, but the outbreak of war had interrupted all their plans.

In 2004, Noël Mamère, the mayor of Bègles in the suburbs of Bordeaux, disobeyed French law and conducted the first gay marriage as an act of defiance. The Mayor and the gay couple were subsequently sued; Caroline Mécary defended them. The marriage was annulled despite their efforts but they managed to successfully raise the question of gay marriage. In 2010, along with SOS Homophobie and APGL (Association des parents et futurs parents gays et lesbiens) she represented a lesbian couple before the French constitutional court (which decides if any law is constitutional and in conformity with French law). The couple wished to get married, but under French law they had no legal right to marriage. Their appeal was rejected on 28 January 2011, and the court pointed out that only the French Assembly could rewrite or change the law. Overseas adoption and recognition of adoption on French territory In July 2010, a bi-national lesbian couple (French-American) was represented by Caroline Mécary because their child had been conceived through artificial insemination in the U.S., and under American law, the French partner had adopted the child. However, the French partner was not recognized as the legal parent under French law. After a long legal battle, she won the test case for all gay parents who have children overseas. In February 2011 she won a similar case; this time of a gay couple who had adopted their children under British and Canadian law. However, since they were not married it challenged a 1966 law which allowed joint legal adoption only by married couples Political commitments In 2008, Caroline Mécary was elected as the president of the Copernic Foundation, a left-wing think tank. Since 2011 she has co-chaired the Foundation with Pierre Khalfa. In March 2010, she stood for election and was elected to the regional council of the greater Paris area. She is a permanent member of the council and in charge of the commissions on Environment, Agriculture and Energy, youth, Metropolitan policy and security. As an elected member of the Greater Paris area, she is also a member of the association which manages regional funds for contemporary and modern art. In 2012, she endorsed Anne Hidalgo's candidacy for Mayor of Paris.

The film was selected as the Venezuelan entry for the Best Foreign Language Film at the 57th Academy Awards, but was not accepted as a nominee.Margaret Herrick Library, Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences Plot A young man, Cruz Salmerón Acosta, from the impoverished village of Manicaure, Araya, rejects the dictatorship of Juan Vicente Gómez. Despite fighting for his ideals, he achieves nothing, returning to Manicaure with few opportunities. He ultimately dies alone of leprosy. Cast * Franklin Vírgüez as Cruz Elías Salmerón Acosta *Doris Wells as Asunción León Costa *Alicia Plaza as Consuelo *Elba Escobar as Ana Dolores Ramos *Hilda Vera as Cruz' mother  Production  The film was scored by Juan Carlos Núñez, and includes a cameo by film critic Rodolfo Izaguirre playing a priest. It was one of the first films to receive funding from FONCINE.  Analysis  At the Sofía en el cine film website, the film is said to go against traditional modern (particularly American) movie narratives which typically show that destiny is both achievable and aligns with the desires and ideals of the hero. To defy expectations, the film shows Cruz' failure to achieve what he really wants. Sofía en el cine also suggests that the film frames this to suggest that the individual can be brought down by their environment, that misery of nation creates misery of its people even as they try to escape it. The name of the film is analyzed by Alexis Correia, examining the symbolism through the film that the idea of a house of water relates to; Correia proposes that first, it refers to being in the womb, then a life of false appearances, and then the house where Cruz dies alone. Correia also suggests that water, as vital to life, is not present in the 'house' of Manicaure, which is experiencing drought. Response Alexis Correia looks at the characterization of Cruz, suggesting it is mostly enabled by the dialogue written by Tomás Eloy Martínez and actor Franklin Vírgüez' \\"timeless\\" appearance; in the film, Cruz cares more about ideals than his art or youthfulness, which Correia believes is captured by the actor and multiple memorable lines. Correia also praises the cinematography, some of which he compares to Eisenstein.

They are a small community of mainly students as well as some secondary migrants, most of whom arrived after the start of the civil war in Somalia in the early 1990s. Demographics The Somali community in Pakistan is very small, comprising around 2,500 immigrants as of late 2012. It comprised 4,000 to 8,000 migrants only a few months earlier, but steadily shrunk in size as Somali immigrants effected a secondary migration to other countries. The majority of Somalis are students pursuing education in various universities across the country. Besides the majority students, 535 refugees and 37 asylum- seekers were at the time also legally registered with the UNHCR in Islamabad. Almost half of them arrived during the height of Somalia's Islamist insurgency between 2006 and 2009. 10 percent were young children and teenagers, and two percent were born in Pakistan. They formed the largest refugee group in Pakistan after Afghans. Most Somalis in Pakistan are concentrated in major urban centers like Islamabad and Karachi. A few hundred live in Lahore. Islamabad's G-10 sector is home to several Somali businesses and residents, and is known as \\"Somali Street\\". Community The Somali community in Pakistan mainly consists of students, as well as some secondary migrants who arrived after the civil war in Somalia broke out in the early 1990s. They are generally a young, educated community, supported by their parents who are based in the Middle East. Others receive remittances directly from relatives in Somalia. The secondary migrants moved to Pakistan with the ultimate aim of emigrating to North America, Europe and Australia. As of mid-2012, most of the former were legally registered with the UNHCR in Islamabad. The agency offered skills-training programs in English, primary education courses, as well as provisions to cover basic amenities and living expenses. Members of the community sought to improve the quality and consistency of these services by raising their concerns with the relevant authorities. Additionally, the UNHCR issued Proof of Registration (POR) Cards to the secondary migrants in conjunction with NADRA. Others wielded a National Aliens Registration Authority (NARA) Card. A section of the younger generation among this group was born and raised in Pakistan. The expiration of the POR Cards in December 2012 saw a more expedited movement of the transient migrants from Pakistan to other countries. Somali pupils in Pakistan mostly study engineering, medicine and pharmacy. They typically return to Somalia after having completed their studies due to a lack of employment opportunities for migrants in Pakistan, as well as a desire to contribute to the post-conflict reconstruction process in their home country. Others have moved on to other nations, drawn by the possibility of better work options. Somali students pursue higher studies in Pakistan due to entry restrictions and the higher cost of education in the Western world. They often do so through the auspices of the local Somalia embassy. The embassy provides scholarship opportunities to the pupils, particularly those in the field of engineering. Students studying medicine pay tuition costs ranging from $1,500 to $3,000 for a five-year term. A third tier of Somali pupils arrived through individuals and private offices, like many other foreigners. These parties specialize in visa requirements, processing them for a small fee. Additionally, other Somali students and foreigners in general travel to Pakistan for Tabligh purposes. They mainly migrate for da'wah and receiving religious instruction. Most such students attend local Islamic universities or seminaries with free tuition or low instruction fees. Organizations Somalis in Pakistan are diplomatically represented by the Somalia embassy in Islamabad. Various Somali-run organizations also serve the community. Among these are the Somali Students Union and the Somali Forum.

Today.com August 17, 2015Film examines Psychology of Brotherhood. MSNBC.com August 17, 2015 Plot The film opens to a seemingly domestic scene involving Mat (Josh Lucas), his girlfriend Andrea (Lucy Owen) and her son from a previous relationship. After a fiery breakup with his girlfriend, Mat is seen wandering the streets of New York with apparently nowhere to go. Meanwhile, Alan (Stephen Plunkett) and his girlfriend Farrah (Mickey Sumner) are caught up in conversation in the aftermath of an ill-fated sexual encounter, preparing for a house party in their small Harlem brownstone apartment. The guests include friends of Farrah from her job working at a New York modern dance company as well as Alan's co-workers from his job as a legal aid lawyer. In the midst of the party, as Farrah tends to guests, she spots Mat seated in the living room and Alan and Mat make eye contact linking the two seemingly separate story lines. At the party, Alan informs Mat that he is about to leave the next morning with Farrah for a vacation to Quebec, where he intends to propose to his girlfriend. Later in the evening, Earl (Austin Pendleton), a friend of Mat and Alan's father, arrives at the party escorted by a significantly younger, attractive Korean filmmaker. Earl regales the party guests with stories of his adventures in the late 1970s along with Mat and Alan's father including a threesome sexual encounter. The party winds down early the next morning and Farrah awakens to realize that she and Alan are late for their flight. As Alan and Farrah hurry to the airport, Mat awakens in the empty apartment. Expecting his brother to be gone for two weeks, Mat settles into the apartment making himself at home. Mat explores his new surroundings venturing briefly out into the neighborhood before retreating to his brother's apartment. After injuring his foot on the broken shards of a jar he had dropped earlier, summons his girlfriend Andrea and the two apparently reconcile as she tends to his injury. Andrea, who has been displaced from her apartment as a result of a bed bug infestation brings her son Ronnie (Cory Nichols) to Alan's apartment and the three of them set up house. Mat and Ronnie locate an abandoned television (Alan had previously not had a television in the apartment) on the street and set it up in the apartment shortly before Alan's apartment begins experiencing intermittent power outages. Alan returns from his vacation alone and much earlier than expected to find his brother and several other guests sleeping in his apartment. Rather than confronting his unexpected guests, Alan passively accepts the presence of the unwanted guests. After Ronnie goes to stay with his father, Mat, Andrea and Alan spend a tumultuous evening together. The next day while walking through Riverside Park, Alan breaks down and confides in Andrea that Farrah had left him during their vacation and he had not been able to propose. Alan also reveals that he is very sad and angry although these attributes are often repressed. Mat grows frustrated by the deepening bond between Alan and Andrea and provokes a confrontation with Andrea that results in her angrily leaving the apartment. Alan restrains Mat who wants to continue berating Andrea as she leaves the apartment. Later that evening, Alan ventures downtown where he wanders through the Feast of San Gennaro. On his way to meet Mat at a bar with some old friends, Alan gets involved in a fight with three rowdy men on the street. Alan arrives at the bar with a noticeable bruise on his face. The evening descends into drunken and drug-fueled debauchery. Mat and Alan traipse through St. Nicholas Park, stumbling on a film crew producing what appears to be a 19th-century period piece. The two brothers harass a member of the crew and steal his walkie-talkie before finally making it back to the apartment. Beginning to sober, Alan wonders aloud whether Farrah will return. The next morning Mat and Alan begin to reach their respective boiling points. Unable to open a locked bathroom door, the brothers begin stabbing at the door with a kitchen knife before turning their aggression on each other. Alan various problems overflow and he briefly sees a visage of his infirmed father before confronting Mat. As Mat and Alan's confrontation is about the come to a head, the door to the apartment opens and Farrah returns. As she talks to Alan, Mat leaves the apartment seemingly without any destination. The film closes and we see that Alan and Farrah are continuing to live together several months later however their interactions appear icy and distant. The film ends with the various characters never having fully resolved the myriad issues in their complex lives that had seemed to be promised by the title of the film.

The film was shot on location in Montreal and Toronto, and is perhaps best remembered for its climax atop CN Tower, in which stuntman Dar Robinson (doubling for Plummer) makes the 700-foot jump in freefall, protected only by a hidden parachute. The film underwent a lengthy and troubled post-production period. Originally filmed in 1979 as a comedic thriller in the vein of North by Northwest, the film was shelved for two years during which extensive reshoots took place. The film was given a limited release in Europe in 1982. Due to negative critical and audience reception concerning its convoluted plot and poor pacing, the film was heavily re-edited by North American distributor New World Pictures, removing much of the comedy and replacing John Addison's original score with one by Christopher Young. This version was released in theaters in 1984, and provided the basis for future home video releases. Plot Lewis Kinney is an accountant who goes to work for a wealthy family, the Hatchers. James Hatcher has embezzled $10 million from the mafia and the CIA, and now they are both seeking him. Kinney falls for James' sister Lise and is pursued by two bumbling henchman, Centino and Falco. He eventually outwits them.

It was originally to star Richard Harris and Katherine Ross. Ross was replaced by Beverly D'Angelo. Filming started 30 July 1979. The movie was financed by Canadian money, raised under tax concessions which led to the Canadian film boom at the time. The movie was reportedly so bad that another $2 million was spent on re-editing. Proposed Follow Up Harris and Plummer were to appear in another Canadian film, The Burning Book but only $3 million of the $7 million budget could be raised.

Brakey was born in Cleveland, Ohio and grew up in the greater suburb of Shaker Heights, Ohio before attending Ohio University, where he studied theater performance. After college he moved to New York City and worked as a professional actor starring in one Coconut Water commercial. A supporter of Congressman Ron Paul, Brakey took a job on his 2012 presidential campaign and moved to Maine. Brakey was elected to the state Senate for District 20 in 2014; the district includes Auburn, New Gloucester, Poland, Minot, and Mechanic Falls. He was reelected in 2016. Brakey served as chairman of the Senate Health and Human Services Committee. Brakey was Maine State Director for the 2012 Ron Paul presidential campaign; he led Ron Paul's supporters to win a majority of Maine delegate seats to the 2012 Republican National Convention and won key seats on the Maine Republican State Committee and National Committee. After working for Paul's 2012 presidential campaign,Katy Steinmetz, The Maine Moment: Loyal Paul Delegates Leave the Floor, Time (August 28, 2012). Brakey led Defense of Liberty PAC, a libertarian political action committee in Maine. Brakey was the Republican nominee for U.S. Senate in 2018, losing to incumbent Senator Angus King with 35% of the vote in a 3-way race.  Ron Paul 2012 presidential campaign  Brakey served as the Maine State Director for the 2012 Ron Paul presidential campaign during the events of the 2012 Maine Republican Convention, in which Ron Paul supporters elected a majority of Maine delegates to the Republican National Convention and took over many key positions in the Maine Republican Party. Bill Nemitz of the Portland Press Herald called this event \\"the most successful political coup in recent Maine history.\\"  Defense of Liberty PAC  In June 2012, Brakey founded the Defense of Liberty PAC, a libertarian political action committee in Maine. In 2013, the group assigned grades to lawmakers based on their votes on bills they supported (such as legislation to make it legal for Maine residents to carry concealed firearms without a permit) and on bills they opposed (such as legislation to increase the minimum wage). The group designated 10 Republican legislators as \\"Honor Roll\\" members for positions aligned with the group, and deemed 21 Democratic legislators and independent Representative Joseph E. Brooks \\"constitutional threats\\" for positions opposed to the group.  2014 Maine State Senate campaign  Brakey announced his campaign for Maine State Senate in July 2013. His campaign chairman was former State Senator Lois Snowe-Mello. In January 2014, Brakey visited Bitcoin Center NYC to raise money and became \\"the first candidate in his state to accept campaign donations in bitcoins.\\"  Vita CoCo commercial  In August 2013, during his campaign for the state Senate, Brakey gained attention for a commercial he acted in for Vita CoCo coconut water several years earlier. The commercial featured men dancing in Brazilian bathing suits. Attention to this commercial began when Mike Hein (a former employee of the Maine Christian Civic League) sent video of the commercial to major news outlets in Maine, as well as to Eric Brakey's pastors at East Auburn Baptist Church. In his message, Hein describes Brakey as \\"dancing around in his underwear in his bedroom, as though he were demon-possessed.\\" Brakey responded, \\"That's my background, and I'm still doing a lot of acting. I'm an actor, and when I was working professionally in New York City this was a real fun, wonderful opportunity doing a commercial for a national brand.\\" At the time of the controversy, Brakey noted that he was working as an actor with the Lewiston/Auburn Community Little Theatre in an upcoming production of Monty Python's Spamalot, also a comedic piece. Maine political commentator Matthew Gagnon wrote that the incident boosted Brakey's State Senate campaign by providing \\"free publicity\\" and \\"an opportunity to show his personality and good nature to the voters.\\" State Senate tenure (2014–2018)=Organizational ratings The American Conservative Union ranked Brakey's voting record as the most conservative in the Maine Senate in 2015http://acuratings.conservative.org/wp- content/uploads/sites/5/2016/04/Maine_2015_web.pdf 2016,http://acuratings.conservative.org/wp- content/uploads/sites/5/2016/08/Maine_2016_web.pdf and 2017.http://acuratings.conservative.org/wp- content/uploads/sites/5/2017/07/Maine_2017_web.pdf Gun laws In 2015, Brakey sponsored legislation that eliminated Maine's requirement to obtain a permit to carry a concealed firearm \\"for legal gun owners who are age 21 or older, and for all military servicemen or servicewomen over 18 years old.\\"Mario Moretto & Nick McCrea, LePage signs bill to remove permit mandate for concealed guns, Bangor Daily News (July 8, 2015). The legislation won broad bipartisan support in the House and Senate and was signed into law by Governor Paul LePage. The legislation was supported by the National Rifle Association (NRA) and the Maine State Police, and opposed by Everytown for Gun Safety, the Maine Chiefs of Police Association, and the Maine Sheriffs' Association.  Welfare reform  In 2016, as Senate Chairman for the Health and Human Services Committee, Brakey negotiated welfare reform legislation, which banned the use of Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) funds on purchases of tobacco, liquor, gambling materials, lottery tickets, bail, firearms, vacations, adult entertainment, and tattoos. To enforce this prohibition, penalties for making prohibited welfare purchases include required restitution for intentional violations and suspensions of benefits ranging from up to three months on the first offense and up to 24 months of suspended benefits on third and subsequent offenses.  Right to try  Brakey, as chair for the Health and Human Services Committee, was the lead Senate sponsor of state \\"right to try\\" legislation in 2016, which guarantees terminally ill patients the right to use investigational drugs, treatments and medical devices that have not yet been approved by the Food and Drug Administration. The legislation passed the Maine House and Senate and Governor Paul LePage signed the legislation into law on March 30, 2016, making Maine the 25th state in the nation (and the first in New England) to pass right-to- try legislation. Fiscal policy  Brakey was the sole \\"no\\" vote in the Senate against the creation of the Maine Capital Investment Fund; in floor speeches, he opposed the fund, which directed public funds for a loan program to incentivize large, out-of-state businesses to relocate to Maine. Brakey has sponsored legislation to eliminate Maine's business income tax, while also eliminating 47 state tax credits or exemptions enjoyed by a number of industries. Brakey referred to these credits and exemptions as \\"carve-outs\\" and \\"corporate welfare\\"; the measure was opposed by the Maine State Chamber of Commerce.  Cannabis  In 2015, Brakey sponsored legislation to repeal state restrictions on patient access to medical marijuana in hospital and nursing home settings. Brakey also supports the legalization of marijuana for adult use.GOP state senator Eric Brakey kicks off underdog 2018 bid to unseat Angus King, Bangor Daily News (April 3, 2017).

Health care Brakey has opposed Medicaid expansion in the Maine Senate, questioning the future \\"solvency of the federal government.\\" In 2017, Brakey sponsored legislation to increase access to birth control by making it easier for persons with \\"an outdated birth control prescription to get the medication as long as certain conditions are met.\\" He \\"declined to say whether he would support allowing women who may become eligible under any expansion of Medicaid in Maine to have access to reproductive health services including abortions.\\"Scott Thistle, Republican bristles at Democrats' attack ads in key Auburn-area Maine Senate contest, Sun Journal (October 28, 2014). This issue has been a contentious one among Maine state legislators, dividing conservative Republicans and Democrats. Civil asset forfeiture Brakey is an opponent of civil asset forfeiture, saying that \\"The idea that the government can take property from you without trial or due process of law and that you might never be charged or convicted flies in the face of everything this country stands for.\\" He introduced legislation that would have required the owner of a property to be convicted of a crime before the government can forfeit that property; the bill did not pass. Criminal justice In 2015, Brakey introduced legislation to eliminate cash bail in Maine and replace it with a risk-assessment system that would allow defendants not determined to be a flight risk to be released pending trial. Brakey said that such a policy would save taxpayer funds and protect the civil liberties of defendants; Brakey noted that \\"about 69 percent of the inmates in Maine jails are those who have yet to go to trial and are unable to post bail.\\" Brakey has also sponsored legislation to allow the expungement of certain non-violent criminal records five years after the completion of the sentence, citing legislation signed into law by Kentucky Governor Matt Bevin as his model. 2016 presidential election Brakey initially declined to say who he voted for in the 2016 presidential election, saying only that he did not vote for Hillary Clinton.Michael Shepherd, So, who is this young Republican who wants to unseat Angus King?, Bangor Daily News (April 4, 2017) In April 2018, however, Brakey tweeted saying he \\"proudly voted for Donald Trump and the foreign policy he advocated.\\"  2016 Republican National Platform  At the 2016 Republican National Convention in Cleveland, Ohio, Brakey represented Maine on the National Platform Committee. Brakey sponsored several amendments to the platform that were successfully adopted, including a measure that declared support for \\"Right To Try\\" legislation, which would allow terminally ill patients to try investigational medicines not approved by the FDA, as well as measures supporting an audit of the Pentagon, the abolishment of the IRS and development of thorium nuclear power. Brakey also sponsored several amendments that were voted down, including a measure that would have declared support for medical marijuana, and another measure that would have condemned U.S. military intervention in Libya and called the \\"deposing of secular dictators in the Middle East\\" a \\"failed policy\\" that should be ended.  2018 U.S. Senate campaign  In April 2017, Brakey announced his intention to run for U.S. Senate in 2018 against incumbent independent Senator Angus King, who caucuses with the Democrats in the Senate. During the campaign, Brakey sought to appeal to both Trump supporters and to libertarians.Patt Wight, Republican Eric Brakey Courts Trump Supporters, Libertarians In Attempt To Unseat Angus King, Maine Public Radio (October 10, 2018).

Design and development Nicola Romeo was a 20th-century industrialist, remembered mostly through the Alfa-Romeo marque. In the early 1930s his aircraft were manufactured by Meridionali / IMAM - Industrie Meccaniche e Aeronautiche Meridonali, the aeronautical branch of Officine Ferroviarie Meridionali () in Naples; the Ro.35 was constructed by the Officine Mecchaniche Romeo (Mechanical Workshops Romeo). The Ro.35 was a cantilever high-wing monoplane with the wing mounted on top of the fuselage without dihedral. The one piece wing was built around a single spar and was plywood skinned forward of the spar forming a torsion-resistant D-box. The rest was fabric-covered. In plan the wing was straight-tapered and had rounded tips. The Ro.35 had a simple rectangular cross-section, wooden framed fuselage, skinned with plywood forward and fabric aft. At the nose the sides curved around but the upper and lower surfaces did not meet, giving the Roma a square nosed side view. The open cockpit was set into the wing leading edge, the pilot protected by a small windscreen. Its rear fuselage tapered in plan to the tail, where a short, narrow fin supported a very curved, tall rudder. The tailplane was mounted on the fuselage at the foot of the fin. It too was narrow and with its elevator was straight-tapered and round tipped. The horizontal surfaces were fabric-covered; all the control surfaces were unbalanced. The curved lower rudder edge left clearance for elevator movement. The glider was unusual in having the option of a fixed, narrow track wheeled undercarriage, with a steel axle passing through the lower fuselage. This could be discarded in favour of a more conventional skid. There was a small tail skid for use with either option. The Ro.35 first flew in 1933 and the sole example was used by the Naples gliding club, operating from Capodichino. It also visited Poggio Renatico near Bologna.

He, along with the Italian mountaineer Walter Bonatti, are also known for having survived a night at the highest open bivouac - - on K2 in 1954. Nanga Parbat (1953) Ice Axe used by Amir Mehdi, during 1954's K2 ascent In July 1953 a German-Austrian team went for expedition to Nanga Parbat. The expedition was organized by the half-brother of Willy Merkl, Karl Herrligkoffer from Munich, while the expedition leader was Peter Aschenbrenner from Innsbruck, who had participated in the 1932 and 1934 attempts. Hermann Buhl, one of team member made it to the top and became first person to reach the summit. He was assisted by two high altitude porters from Hunza, Amir Mehdi and Haji Baig. They later helped Buhl during his descent, when he was caught by frostbite and lost his crampon. K2 (1954) During the Italian expedition, he and Walter Bonatti were stranded by Achille Compagnoni and Lino Lacedelli, who wanted to prevent Bonatti from reaching the summit, and were forced to huddle on an ice ledge overnight at , the highest ever open bivouac at the time. As Mehdi was wearing standard army boots, he lost all his toes to frostbite and spent 8 months in hospital recovering from the ordeal. It was later revealed that Compagnoni had deliberately moved the camp because he wanted to prevent Bonatti and Mehdi from joining the summit bid. Compagnoni apparently feared that Bonatti, who was younger and fitter, was going to steal the limelight, perhaps by climbing without supplemental oxygen. Compagnoni intended for Mehdi and Bonatti to see that the bivouac tent was out of reach, and return to a lower camp, but night fell, and Mehdi was in no condition to climb back down, so the two had to dig into snow for shelter. Unlike his Italian colleagues, Mehdi hadn't been given proper high-altitude snow boots. He was wearing regular army boots - according to some reports, they were two sizes too small for him. He developed severe frostbite, and was unable to walk by the time he reached base camp. He had to be carried on a stretcher to a hospital in the town of Skardu, where he was given first aid, and transferred from there to a military hospital in Rawalpindi. Doctors had no choice but to amputate all his toes to prevent gangrene from spreading. He was not released from the hospital until eight months later. When he finally returned home to his village in Hunza, Mehdi put away his ice axe and told his family he never wanted to see it again.  Life and career  Mehdi left mountaineering after the K2 attempt. The Italian government claimed it awarded him a pension, but his son denied this. Amir served briefly as a government servant of Pakistan, before living out the rest of his modest life in his hometown Hassanabad. Mehdi died of old-age in 1999, in Hunza.  Awards and titles  * The Italian government awarded him the rank of cavaliere. * Mehdi also received Italian civilian medal, Al Valor Civile. * Mehdi was given the title of 'Hunza Tiger' for the services rendered during the ascent of Nanga Parbat in 1953.

Externally, only the Brick Gothic church porch is of later date, being added in the 16th century. Internally, the church received brick vaults in the 15th century, of which those in the choir are decorated with frescos by an unknown medieval master, depicting (among other motifs) the Coat of arms of Sweden and that of Jakob Ulvsson and Sten Sture the Elder. Several medieval furnishings have been preserved in the church. The oldest is the baptismal font, dating from the late 12th century and thus pre-dating the church itself. It was probably made on Gotland by the master stonemason sometimes referred to as Master Semi-Byzantios. The altarpiece of the church dates from the 1470s. In addition, there are several wooden sculptures of saints housed in the church, including depictions of Mary and Saint Olaf. The triumphal cross dates from circa 1500. The church has a rich collection of church silver, the oldest object dating from the 14th century and including a wine chalice donated to the church by the congregation in gratitude for the peace with Russia in 1721.

Sited in the parish of Cluny, it is south of Monymusk and north of Sauchen in Aberdeenshire, north-east Scotland. Owned by three separate branches of Gordon families over the centuries, it was used to shelter Jacobite rebels in the mid-18th century. Extensive additions were made in 1820 to the design of architect John Smith when it was in the ownership of Colonel John Gordon. Two wings of the castle and the adjoining private chapel were destroyed by fire in 1926, but the damage was restored. It is a Category A listed building and has been used as a film setting. The grounds are included on the Inventory of Gardens and Designed Landscapes in Scotland. it remains privately owned by the Baron of Cluny who has employed craftsmen to complete extensive renovations. It is not open to the public but corporate events are hosted there and weddings are held in the chapel. History On an unknown date prior to 1325 King Robert the Bruce granted the lands of Cluny (Gaelic meaning meadow or \\"meadows interspersed with rising grounds\\") to his sister Mary's husband, Alexander Fraser. The lands passed down through the family, via Adam Gordon of Huntly and the Earls of Huntly, to John Gordon, a younger son of the 3rd Earl. His son Sir Thomas Gordon (d. 1607) built the castle to replace an earlier house or peel tower. The lands were inherited by his son, Alexander Gordon, who became the fourth laird of Cluny. By 1636 the cost of building the castle combined with other financial difficulties caused ownership of the lands to be transferred. The castle had various owners, probably creditors, until 1680, when it became the property of Robert Gordon, of the Gordonstoun branch of the family. It remained in the hands of this family until the mid-18th century. The Gordons of Cluny were implicated in the Jacobite Rising of 1745, and had also incurred debts. This resulted in the castle passing to a third branch of the Gordon family around 1753, although the exact date is unknown. The new proprietor John Gordon (1695–1769) was of obscure origins. He was an Edinburgh merchant as well as a factor to Cosmo Gordon, 3rd Duke of Gordon. John Gordon's son was also named Cosmo Gordon (1736–1800) and he inherited the estate on his father's death in 1769. He was a politician and co-founder of the Royal Society of Edinburgh. He did some work at the castle, although records give no indication of what was involved. Plans for a re-design were commissioned from Robert Adam in 1790 and from his business partner and younger brother James in 1793, though this work was never carried out. Pre-deceased by his wife, Mary Baillie, Cosmo Gordon died without issue in 1800 and was succeeded by his brother Charles, described by architectural historian H. Gordon Slade as \\"eccentric and excessively penurious\\". When Charles died on 8 May 1814, various bequests were made to his children; his eldest son John, later an army colonel and a member of Parliament, inherited Cluny and the remainder of the properties plus £30,000. No money had been spent on the estate during the years it was owned by Charles Gordon. South Lodge, Cluny Castle It was under the ownership of Colonel Gordon that extensive additions were made to the castle, commencing around 1820. He had previously inherited the estates of his uncle, a merchant in West India, and the Colonel continued to extend his fortune, purchasing additional lands including North and South Uist, Benbecula and Barra. The Colonel died in 1858; a description included in his obituaries was \\"the richest commoner in the northern part of the kingdom.\\" In The Times dated 23 July 1858, his assets were estimated at between £2–3 million and it stated he was \\"without doubt the richest commoner in Scotland.\\" He was unmarried but had four illegitimate children; all bar his eldest son John (c.1820–1878) pre-deceased him. Despite a series of litigations lasting 20 years, in 1858 the estates were inherited by his natural son John, who became an Aberdeenshire Militia captain from 29 March 1852. The captain continued the castle renovations and improved the general policies by additions of artificial lakes and woodland. Captain Gordon also died without issue in 1878. Emily Pringle, his second wife, married Sir Reginald Cathcart becoming Lady Cathcart. The estates were overseen by a trust set up by Colonel Gordon (the Cluny Trust). In September 1926 a fire started near the kitchen causing extensive damage to two wings of the castle and destroying the private chapel. After Lady Cathcart's death in 1932, the estate passed to Captain Gordon's cousin, Charles Arthur Linzee. He adopted the name Linzee Gordon to comply with a stipulation made by Colonel Gordon in a codicil added to his will on 21 June 1852. In an earlier legal document dated 5 October 1835 the Colonel had declared that he wished his illegitimate children to inherit but he did not intend to marry to facilitate it. The codicil ensured the family name was continued by mandating that any heirs to the estates \\"shall be bound and obliged constantly to bear, use and retain the surname of 'Gordon' and arms and designation of 'Gordon of Cluny' in all time after their succession to, or obtaining possession of, my said lands and estates, as their proper surname, arms and designation.\\" Historic Scotland listed the castle as a Category A listed building in April 1971. Architecture Cluny Castle pictured in 1966 Construction of the original Z-plan castle was completed in 1604; there is a commemorative stone inscribed \\"Thom. Gordon a Cluny miles me fecit 1604\\". The Master Mason Ian (John) Bell (Bel) is attributed with the construction of the original Cluny Castle and nearby Castle Fraser. MacGibbon and Ross attributed Cluny to a date earlier than 1604 and suggested it was similar in design to Claypotts Castle and would date from about the same time. The Aberdeen City Architect, John Smith was commissioned to undertake an extensive re-design of the castle in the 1820s. Completion of the construction work spanned several years and meant the castle was unsuitable for residential use until 1832. It took until the early 1840s for the work to be finished. The old castle was cocooned in granite so it blended with the new extensions and its first floor hall became the principal dining room. A clone of the old castle was built towards the east and the two were conjoined by a new building housing the entrance hall, main stairway and gallery corridor. The drawing room and morning room were on the first floor of the replica wing. The ground fell away at the rear of the buildings and an extra basement level was added there. Circular towers, arched windows with hood moulds and crenellated parapets above bold corbelling were all incorporated into the design. The pre-existing tower on the west elevation was considerably heightened by the addition of a further tall square tower above it. Significant parts of the castle were gutted by fire in September 1926. The main house was not damaged but two wings and the chapel were consumed by flames. Restoration work was promptly undertaken – a report in the Aberdeen Journal estimated repairs would be between £60,000 to £70,000. The chapel was re-constructed to resemble its former state and some re-modelling of the courtyard wings was carried out. The later extensions were initially described by architectural historian H. Gordon Slade in 1978 as \\"the most shocking mis- use of architectural effort and granite in the north east of Scotland.\\" However, in 1981, he amended his opinion stating: \\"The architectural qualities of the castle as John Smith redesigned it become much more apparent and impressive as one becomes better acquainted with them, and – once regret at the loss of the old Cluny is set aside – it is possible to accord the new Cluny the approbation that it merits.\\" A respected archaeologist, Ian Shepherd, characterised it \\"As fantastical a baronial pile as can be found in eastern Scotland\\". Twenty-first century Cluny Castle with the Gordon arms The castle remains privately owned and was inherited by the current Baron of Cluny, Cosmo Linzee Gordon, when he reached 18 years of age in 2010. In August 2019 Cosmo Linzee Gordon married Bronya Woodes Rogers of Dess, Aberdeenshire and held their wedding within the castle grounds. Some scenes for the film The Queen, starring Helen Mirren, were recorded at the castle. It is not open to the public although some corporate events and conferences are catered for. In addition, it can be used as a wedding venue with the ceremony taking place in the private chapel, which can seat up to 100 guests. Overnight accommodation is available for the main guests at weddings. From 2006, the policies were listed on the Inventory of Gardens and Designed Landscapes in Scotland by Historic Scotland. It is assessed as outstanding in the work of art category and receives a high rating in the horticultural, arboricultural and silvicultural categories due to the Wellingtonia trees planted in the 19th century. During 2016, renovations were undertaken: the chapel was repainted; the roof and ceiling above the main staircases in the castle were replaced; and drainage systems overhauled. Refurbishment work is ongoing but the majority of the restoration has been completed. The renovations have all been funded by the family estate.

This operates from the defunct Ghana Airways McDonnell Douglas DC-10, which had been in operation as a passenger jet between 1983 and 2005. The restaurant serves staple Ghanaian dishes. The restaurant has been well received locally. Description La Tante DC10 Restaurant is a restaurant located inside a converted McDonnell Douglas DC-10 formerly used by the defunct Ghana Airways. Formerly flying 380 passengers, it has been converted into a 118-seat restaurant with large numbers of the seats removed in order to provide adequate space for patrons and for the installation of dining tables. An annex was attached to the right side of the fuselage to accommodate the kitchen. The airplane itself has been moved to Airport City Accra, a suburb of Accra near to Kotoka International Airport and opposite Marina Mall Accra, with people entering and exiting the plane/restaurant via a covered staircase from ground level. They enter through the former first class seating area, which has been converted into a waiting area. Separate bathrooms have been installed for male and female diners and the restaurant is air-conditioned throughout. Menu The restaurant serves Ghanaian cuisine. These include staples such as spiced tilapia, served with banku, a type of maize-based porridge. Other dishes include Jollof rice with chicken, and \\"red red\\" black-eyed pea stew with fish. While the prices at La Tante DC10 Restaurant are higher than those normally seen in the local area, the restaurant prices itself lower than the upmarket restaurants elsewhere in Accra. History The DC-10 in 2002 at Düsseldorf Airport The DC-10 used as the restaurant was formerly owned and operated by Ghana Airways on routes between Ghana and both Europe and the United States. Ghana Airways ordered a DC-10-30 in 1976, with it arriving on 24 February 1983. During July 1985, it was used to fly United Nations troops in and out of Beirut, Lebanon. In January the following year the plane was used under contract from Caribbean Airlines to fly passengers from Europe to the Caribbean twice weekly. In June 2002, the plane was impounded at London Heathrow Airport, United Kingdom, following unpaid debts of £4 million owned by the national carrier to parts supplier AJ Walters Aviation, causing services between Accra, the UK and Italy to be temporarily suspended. The airline went bankrupt in 2005. Following this, the plane was abandoned and left at Kotaka Airport; over the course of the following years, various parts were sold for scrap, including the three engines. At the time it was purchased by the wife of the Togolese Minister in 2011, there had been preparations to salvage the plane for its aluminium. The plane was converted and re-opened as a restaurant on 11 November 2013 as a public-private partnership between the Ghana Airport Company Limited and Vindira Company Limited. It is the first time that a plane based restaurant has opened in Africa. Reception The restaurant has proved popular with diners; manager Indira Shiyam explained in an interview with BBC News in 2014 that \\"At first, people wanted to have a feel of restaurant in a plane but surprisingly they keep coming\\". Some of the diners eat in the restaurant because they have never been inside a plane before, while others were curious about eating in a plane based restaurant. Patrick Smith visited the restaurant in 2016; his review was later published in Business Insider. He said it was cheap and good, but not exceptional. He criticised the \\"lack of context\\" given to the restaurant, as he would have enjoyed seeing photos of the plane when it was in use as a passenger jet.

Henry Leigh Murray Early life Murray was born in Sloane Street, London, 19 October 1820, with the surname Wilson. While a clerk in a merchant's office he made a start on amateur acting, in a small theatre in Catherine Street, Strand, his first appearance being about 1838 as Buckingham in King Richard III. Other Shakespearean parts followed, and on 2 December 1839, under Hooper, manager of the York circuit, he made his professional debut at Kingston upon Hull, playing Ludovico in Othello. On 17 September 1840, as Leigh (perhaps to avoid confusion with his manager) he appeared at the Adelphi Theatre, Edinburgh, under William Henry Murray, as Lieutenant Morton in The Middy Ashore by William Bayle Bernard. Occasionally visiting other Scottish towns, he remained in Edinburgh, at the Theatre Royal or the Adelphi, till the spring of 1845. Among the characters he played were Dr. Caius, Jan Dousterswyvel in The Lost Ship by William Thompson Townsend, Hotspur, and Mark Antony as his farewell to the Edinburgh stage. The London stage Murray's first appearance in London took place at the Princess's Theatre under J. M. Maddox on 19 April 1845, as Sir Thomas Clifford in The Hunchback by Sheridan Knowles, with Lester Wallack in the lead, Charlotte Cushman as Julia and Walter Lacy playing Lord Tinsel. He played Bassanio, Orlando, and Leonardo Gonzaga, and was the original Herman Lindorf in James Kenney's Infatuation, and Malcolm Young in James White's King of the Commons. He was also Icilius to William Charles Macready's Virginius, in the Virgilius of Knowles, and De Mauprat to his Richelieu, in the Richelieu of Bulwer Lytton. With Macready, Murray went, in the autumn of 1846, to the Surrey Theatre, where he played secondary characters in Shakespeare and Loveless in The Relapse. On the recommendation of Charles Dickens he was chosen at the Lyceum Theatre to play Alfred Heathfield in Albert Richard Smith's adaptation of The Battle of Life. At the Lyceum he remained under the Keeley and the Mathews managements. His Marquis de Volange in the Pride of the Market (James Robinson Planché) won recognition. In Dublin in 1848 Murray supported Helen Faucit.Playing Romeo, Jaffier, Biron, Leonatus, Beverley, Claude Melnotte, Charles Surface, and other roles. Leaving the Lyceum for the Olympic Theatre, he became stage-manager under Joachim Hayward Stocqueler, and then under Spicer and Davidson. There he played character parts in pieces then in vogue, such as Time Tries All (John Courtney), and His First Champagne (William Leman Rede). In the theatricals given during 1848 and 1849 at Windsor Castle he played Lorenzo in the Merchant of Venice, Laertes, Octavius in Julius Caesar, and Gustavus in Charles XII (James Robinson Planché). Murray accompanied William Farren, whose stage-manager he became, to the Strand Theatre, and back to the Olympic.He played at the Strand Joseph Surface, Falkland, Harry Dornton, Mr. Oakly, and other parts. His original characters at this time included Herbert Clavering in Patronage, Fouché in Secret Service (James Robinson Planché), Captain Wagstaff in Hearts are Trumps (Mark Lemon), Count Tristan in King Rene's Daughter, the Comte de Saxe in an adaptation of Adrienne Lecouvreur (Eugene Scribe and Ernest Legouvé), Stephen Plum in All that glitters is not Gold (John Maddison Morton), and others. He supported Gustavus Vaughan Brooke as Iago, and Wellborn in A New Way to pay Old Debts. Murray accompanied Benjamin Webster to the Adelphi Theatre, where on 1 April 1853 he played in Mark Lemon's farce Mr. Webster at the Adelphi, and made an impression, 10 October 1853, in Webster's Discarded Son, the first of many adaptations of Un Fils de Famille (Bayard and De Bieville). On 20 March 1854 he was Sir Gervase Rokewode in Two Loves and a Life, by Tom Taylor and Charles Reade, and on 31 May was first Raphael Duchatelet in the Marble Heart, Charles Selby's adaptation of Les Filles de Marbre (Théodore Barrière and Lambert- Thiboust). In September he left the Adelphi, and the next year was at Sadler's Wells Theatre. On 4 November 1856 Murray reappeared at the Adelphi as Sir Walter Raeburn in the Border Marriage (Un Mariage à l'Arquebuse, by Léon Guillard). On 8 March 1858 he was, at Drury Lane Theatre, the first M. Bernard in Stirling Coyne's Love Knot. As John Mildmay in Still Waters run deep (Tom Taylor) he reappeared at the Lyceum on 7 August 1859, and played subsequently M. Tourbillon in To Parents and Guardians (Tom Taylor), and Claude Melnotte (in The Lady of Lyons by Bulwer Lytton). On 9 November he enacted at St James's Theatre the original Harrington in James Kenney's London Pride, or Living for Appearances. Later life A benefit was given for Murray at Drury Lane on 27 June 1865, when he was in failing health. Representations were given by various London actors, Murray and his wife delivering a duologue written by Shirley Brooks. Murray died 17 January 1870 and was buried in Brompton cemetery. He was a member of the Garrick Club. Family Murray married in 1841 Elizabeth Lee, a member of the Edinburgh company, and the second daughter of Henry Lee; she later appeared as Mrs. Elizabeth Leigh Murray, and died in 1892. Murray's younger brother, Gaston Murray (1826–1889), real name Garstin Parker Wilson, first appeared in London at the Lyceum on 2 March 1855 as Tom Saville in Used Up, played in various theatres, and tried some of his brother's parts. He died 8 August 1889. His wife, Mary Frances, known as Mrs. Gaston Murray, daughter of Henry Hughes, of the Adelphi Theatre, also acted. On 24 May 1889, at the opening of the Garrick Theatre, she was the original Mrs. Stonehay in Arthur Pinero's The Profligate. She died on 15 January 1891.

Setting This area includes the southern half of Michigan's Lower Peninsula, and much of Indiana and Ohio. It also extends through the southern half of Southwest Ontario from Windsor to Toronto and into Pennsylvania and New York on the southern rims of lakes Erie and Ontario. This region is characterized by warm-to-hot summers and mild-to- cold, snowy winters. Flora This ecoregion is associated with the temperate deciduous forest to the south and thus contained a variety of habitats including freshwater marshes, dunes, bogs, fens, and hardwood and conifer swamps. Fauna The Southern Great Lakes forests were very rich in wildlife. Birds include cardinals, downy woodpecker, wood duck and eastern screech owl. Large mammals including American black bear (Ursus americanus), moose (Alces alces), and gray wolf (Canis lupus) have been removed from this ecoregion and remaining mammals include white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus), coyote (Canis latrans), snowshoe hare (Lepus americanus), eastern chipmunk (Tamias striatus), American red squirrel (Tamiasciurus hudsonicus) and eastern gray squirrel (Sciurus carolinensis).

History On 11–13 June 2004 in Omsk the first founding congress was held with the initiative of Vadim Sidorov (Harun ar- Rusi). Abu Talib (Anatoliy Stepchenko) from Omsk, who converted to Islam in 1990, was elected as a chairman. In 2005 the Russian Muslims’ communities of Saint-Petersburg and Rostov-on-Don also merged with THE NORM. The members of the Organization created the Cultural-educational center “Proponents of Tradition and Unity”, which aimed to increase Dawah among ethnic Russians and interactions with other ethnic-national Muslim communities. There was a shift from acute controversy to cooperation with the former priest of Russian Orthodox Church, now well-known Islamic scholar Vyacheslav Polosin. At the same time the interactions with Geydar Dzhemal, whom the opponents of the Organization were usually referring as the founder of the NORM, were stopped. In 2006 in the next congress of the NORM it was decided that Shias cannot be members of the Organization and it was offered to all Shia members to accept Orthodox Islam or to leave the Organization. No exceptions were made even for some executives of the NORM.«Russian Muslims» break off with Shiism in the favor of Sunnism (in Russian) It was decided to transfer the infrastructure of the Cultural-educational center “Proponents of Tradition and Unity”, to Azerbaijani Sunni community. In 2007 there was the first contact between the NORM and Murabitun World Movement and its leader Abdalqadir as-Sufi. The representatives of the NORM visited Cape Town. In 2007 Russian Muslims’ community of Kirov also entered to the Organization. Until 2008 the NORM was the proponent of the Salafi theology. In 2008 it was decided to shift to the classical Ashari School of Theology and Maliki madhab. The contacts with the Murabitun World Movement were widened. The leaders of the German and Spanish Muslim communities visited Moscow. Some changes were made in the Articles of association of the Organization — individual membership to the NORM changed to the collective membership. In 2010 the delegation of the NORM took part in the Musamma (annual conference) of the Abdalqadir as-Sufi’s students in Cape Town, also held Shura (Conference) there. Some changes were made in the National Council of the NORM. In 2011 the Organization became an international NGO. All activity in the previous format was stopped. Some communities, leaders and members of the NORM took part in Russian Islamic Movement. In 2012 communities of the NORM in Moscow and Saint-Petersburg actively took part in Russian opposition protests. Despite the effort of some opponents to link the activity of the NORM to the extremist activity of some newly converted Russian Muslims, the National Organization of Russian Muslims, its leaders and members have never been accused of extremism, never been sued or wanted for such allegations. NORM positions itself as a base for creation of a new sub-ethnic group — Russian Muslims.

Buoyancy force is based on the basic principle of pressure variation with depth, since pressure increases with depth. Hence buoyancy force arises as pressure on the bottom surface of the immersed object is greater than that at the top. Flow problems in buildings were studied since 700 B.C. Recent advancements in CFD and CAE have led to comprehensive calculation of buoyancy flows and flows in buildings. Calculation of buoyant flows and flow inside buildings Since there is natural driven ventilation resulting from the difference in temperature inside the buildings hence flows inside buildings fall under buoyancy force category. The momentum equation in the direction of gravity should be modeled for buoyant forces resulting from buoyancy.H.K Versteeg & W. Malalasekera (1995). An introduction to Computational Fluid Dynamics. Chapter:10. Retrieved 11 November 2013. Hence the momentum equation is given by ∂ρv/∂t + V.∇(ρv)= -g((ρ-ρ°) - ∇P+μ∇2v + Sv In the above equation -g((ρ-ρ°) is the buoyancy term, where ρ° is the reference density. On discretizing the above equation several instabilities are obtained during the solution process. Hence we use a transient approach as several relaxations are often required in obtaining a steady state solution. When applied to turbulent flows some additional modifications are to be applied to the calculation of buoyant flows. Hence an additional term is added, as recommended by Rodi(1978) in the k equation of the k- ε model is used below in modelling turbulent buoyant flows. Therefore, the k-equations takes the formH.K Versteeg & W. Malalasekera (1995). An introduction to Computational Fluid Dynamics. Chapter:3.

As C3 is close to unity in vertical buoyant shear layers and close zero in horizontal shear layers hence a single value of C3 cannot be used as Rf. Rf = - Gl/2(G+B) Where, Gl = Buoyancy production in lateral energy component. If we consider the horizontal shear layer where the lateral flow velocity component is in the direction of gravity, the production of buoyancy is given as Gl = 2B If we consider the vertical shear layer then the direction of gravity and the lateral component are normal to each other. Hence Gl = 0. Therefore, we obtain Rf = - B/(B+G) \\\\------------ For horizontal layers Rf = 0 \\\\------------- For vertical layers Finally in a given flow if vertical shear stresses are dominant then we can set Rf equal to zero and take C3 = 0.8. Uses Buoyancy flow calculation and force calculations are used in successfully predicting the effect of various natural calamities upon buildings, ships, aircraft and other commercial and non-commercial vehicles. They are also used in locating a prominent location for placing the exhaust chimney for the large scale industries. Also the shape of the chimney is obtained keeping in mind the above calculations. They are also used in planning of buildings in coastal area such that the structure is able to sustain floods and strong currents that arise at the coast.

He was the eldest son of Muhammad ibn Rustam Dushmanziyar. He was defeated by Tughril in 1051 and became his vassal. Faramurz later died after 1063, probably in the 1070s.  Reign = Independent rule  In 1037, Muhammad ibn Rustam strengthened the defenses of Isfahan to protect it from the plundering Turkmen nomads from Khorasan. In 1041, after the defeat of the Ghaznavids by the Seljuqs at the battle of Dandanaqan, the Seljuqs became neighbors with the Kakuyids. After defeating the Ghaznavids, their leader, Tughril, made Ray the capital of his kingdom. Four years later, Faramurz succeeded his father, Muhammad, in Isfahan, while Muhammad's younger son Garshasp I took power in Hamadan as a vassal king of his brother. The third son of Muhammad, Abu Harb, however, rebelled against his older brother and called upon help from the Buyids of Fars. The rebel brother was, however, defeated by Faramurz. Relations with Faramurz and Tughril had high importance. It seems that Faramurz was present with the Seljuqs at the battle of Dandanaqan against the Ghaznavids. When Faramurz ascended to the Kakuyid throne, Tughril secured his allegiance by sending a tribute of payment to Faramurz. However, neither Faramurz nor his brother Garshasp I were willing to turn to the side of Seljuqs. In 1044, Faramurz conquered a few cities in Kirman from the Buyid Abu Kalijar, but he shortly made a counter-attack against him, reconquering parts of Kirman and capturing Abarquh. The next year, the Dailamites and Kurds of Jibal made a stand together to resist the advance of the Turkmens from Khorasan. The following year Tughril arrived to Isfahan. Faramurz then submitted himself to the Seljuqs. Around 1045–46, after Tughril's return to Khorasan, Faramurz declared himself independent of Seljuq rule, and submitted to the Buyids, forcing Tughril to return to Isfahan, where he defeated the Kakuyids, and made Faramurz his vassal once again. In 1050, Tughril laid siege to Isfahan. The people of Isfahan defended the city bravely against the Seljuqs but after a year they finally surrendered. The walls of Isfahan were razed, and Tughril then made the city his capital.  Seljuq suzerainty  Faramurz was then appointed as the ruler Yazd and Abarkuh in compensation for the loss of Isfahan. Both of these towns which he controlled, had already been under Kakuyid control. Although he lost almost all power, Faramurz was highly respected at the Seljuq court, where he was awarded with the title of \\"Shams al-Mulk\\" (Sun of royalty) twice in 1061 and 1063. During this period, he was part of the Seljuq delegation to Baghdad, where he went with the Seljuq vizier Al-Kunduri and Tughril himself to organize the wedding of the Seljuq king with the daughter of Abbasid Caliph Al-Qa'im. After that, nothing more is known about Faramurz, and he probably died soon after. He was succeeded by his son Ali ibn Faramurz, who later married one of Chaghri Beg's daughters.

Estimates of body length for the holotype are approximately in length, making Xinjiangtitan one of the longest sauropods known. In 2016 Gregory S. Paul gave a length of 30 meters (100 feet) and a weight of 40 tonnes (44 short tons). In 2020 Molina-Perez and Larramendi gave a lower estimation of 27 meters (88.6 ft) and 25 tonnes (27.5 short tons), with a total height of 17 meters (56 ft) making it one of the tallest known dinosaurs. Discovery Xinjiangtitan was first described and named by Wu Wen-hao, Zhou Chang-fu, Oliver Wings, Toru Sekiha and Dong Zhiming in 2013 and the type species is Xinjiangtitan shanshanesis. The generic name is derived from Xinjiang where the bones were discovered in 2012, and from titan, giant in Greek mythology. The specific name, shanshanesis, is derived from an alternative name for the county where it was found, Shanshan, named after the ancient Shanshan Kingdom. The specific name is occasionally misspelled as \\"shanshanensis\\" or \\"shashaensis\\", which are invalid spellings even though the correct form would indeed have been \\"shanshanensis\\" rather than shanshanesis, as the Latin suffix \\"-ensis\\" meaning \\"from\\", was used to create the name. Xinjiangtitan is known solely from the holotype SSV12001, a partial but, apart from some erosion, well preserved in situ postcranial skeleton including the first two caudal vertebrae, all cervical vertebrae, and all dorsal (12) and sacral vertebrae (5), as well as several cervical, dorsal and sacral ribs, a partial left leg (including the femur, tibia, fibula and a metatarsal), left and right pubic bones and right ischium. While in the describing paper it was said to be from the Qigu Formation, this is incorrect, and it is actually in layers belonging to the Qiketai Formation. Description 262x262px Xinjiangtitan was diagnosed based on the following traits: the presence of a ventral keel on the penultimate cervical centrum that forms a small semicircular process under the distal articular facet; both cervical vertebrae are relatively elongated; the sacricostal yoke excepts the first sacral rib; and an extremely robust femur. The series of dorsal vertebrae has a length of 372 centimetres. The thighbone is 165 centimetres long, and the tibia is 98 cm. Xinjiangtitan (gray) compared to selected giant sauropods Phylogeny Among sauropods, a phylogenetic analysis places Xinjiangtitan as the sister taxon of Mamenchisaurus, the only other mamenchisaurid included. Xinjiangtitan shares several derived characters with diplodocids, including prominent ambiens process of pubis, relatively short hind limb and fourth trochanter on the femur that is caudomedially developed.

It was collected in 1980 by James Malcolm from a locality along the Seaboard Coast Line Railroad in Charleston County in the vicinity of the Dorchester Road overpass. A second specimen assigned to the species, Science Museum of Minnesota P90.38.8, consists of a cranium discovered in October 1990 by Bruce Erickson near the Wando Terminal. Both specimens were found in the Goose Creek Limestone, of middle Pliocene age. The type specimen comes from the upper part of the formation, which is approximately 3.6 to 3.5 million years old. The exact stratigraphy of the second specimen is uncertain, and it may be anywhere from 3.9 to 3.5 million years old.

Fixation (2013) On November 10, 2013, while sitting naked on the stone pavement in front of Lenin's Mausoleum on the Red Square, Moscow, Pavlensky hammered a large nail through his scrotum, affixing it to the stone pavement. His action coincided with the annual Russian Police Day. Pavlensky said the work represents \\"apathy [and] political indifference\\". When the police arrived, they covered him with a blanket and later arrested him. \\"A naked artist, looking at his testicles nailed to the cobblestone is a metaphor of apathy, political indifference, and fatalism of Russian society,\\" declared Pavlensky in his statement to the media. Freedom (2014) On February 23, 2014, Pavlensky organized an action called Freedom in support of Maidan and the 2014 Ukrainian revolution. The artist and his friends built an imitation barricade on Tripartite Bridge in Saint Petersburg, burned tires, and beat drums. The action was interrupted by Saint Petersburg police who arrested Pavlensky and his colleagues. On February 25, 2014, Dzerzhinsky Criminal Court stopped the administrative case against Pavlensky on the accusations of hooliganism, and released them from prison. An investigation into Pavlensky's alleged violation of the regulations on political meetings continued. He was charged with vandalism due to the tire burning. Segregation (2014) Segregation: Pavlensky moments after self-harming. Moscow, October 2014. On October 19, 2014, Pavlensky cut off his earlobe with a chef's knife while sitting naked on the roof of the infamous Serbsky Center to protest political abuse of psychiatry in Russia. Threat (2015) Pavlensky came to the first entrance of the Lubyanka Building, which is the headquarters of the Russian Federal Security Service, on November 9, 2015 at 1:15 a.m. Moscow time, doused the front door with gasoline, and set fire to it with a cigarette lighter. The doors of the building were partially burnt. Pavlensky stood and waited to be arrested, was detained after 30 seconds without resistance, and was charged with debauchery. A few hours after the action, a video appeared on the Internet with an explanation of the meaning of the burning. The action is called \\"Lubyanka's burning door\\" according to Pavlensky, and it references filmmaker Oleg Sentsov's incarceration. The criminal case against Pavlensky was opened on November 9, 2015 under the \\"vandalism\\" section of Article 214 of the Russian criminal code. On November 10, 2015 in the Tagansky district court, in support of Oleg Sentsov, Pavlensky declared: \\"I want my action to be reclassified to terrorism.\\" He was held in a psychiatric ward for a few weeks, and spent seven months in prison waiting for his trial. According to gallerist Marat Gelman, the action shows Pavlensky's \\"obvious symbolism\\". \\"The Lubyanka door is the gate of hell, the entrance into the world of absolute evil. And against the backdrop of hellfire is a lonely artist, waiting to be captured ... Pavlensky's figure at the door of the FSB in flames - very important symbol for today's Russia, both political and artistic.\\" On 8 June 2016, the Moscow criminal court declared Pavlensky guilty of vandalism and sentenced him to a fine of 500,000 rubles, which Pavlensky did not pay. On 13 August 2016, Pavlensky gave a lecture in Odessa, Ukraine which ended with the inebriated Ukrainian journalist and screenwriter Vladimir Nestrenko instigating a fight that ended with his stabbing one of two security guards who tried to subdue him. The second of the two security guards suffered a fatal heart attack after the incident. Lighting (2017) On 16 October 2017, in his first action outside of Russia, Pavlensky was arrested in Paris after setting fire to the street-level windows of an office of the Bank of France, located on the Place de la Bastille in Paris. He was charged with property damage, together with his partner Oksana Shalygina. He was initially detained in a psychiatric unit, until a judge ordered him to be placed in pretrial detention at Fleury-Mérogis Prison. Pavlensky went on two hunger strikes while imprisoned. On 10 January 2019, Pavlensky was sentenced to three years in prison; his pre-trial detention was counted as time served and the remaining two years were suspended. Shalygina was sentenced to two years in prison, of which 16 months were spent on probation. In addition, the convicts are obliged to pay the Bank of France €18,678 as compensation for material damage and €3,000 for moral damage. According to the newspaper Le Matin, Pavlensky in response shouted in Russian \\"Never!\\".  Pornopolitics (2020)  In 2020, Pavlensky innovated with a new action called \\"pornopolitics\\" for which he launched a website presented as \\"the first political porn platform\\". This action aims to expose the lies of civil servants, politicians, representatives of power who \\"impose puritanism on society while despising it\\" . On February 12, the artist published intimate videos and sexually connoted messages sent by the deputy and Paris mayoral candidate Benjamin Griveaux to a woman. Pavlensky explained that this material demonstrates \\"the hypocrisy\\" of the candidate who campaigned by putting forward \\"traditional family values\\" . Benjamin Griveaux then withdrew from the mayoral elections . Pornopolitique.com was taken offline three days after the event. . Pavlensky was arrested and placed in police custody with his partner Alexandra De Taddeo who was the recipient of the sexually explicit content , .  Group art exhibitions  In 2012, Pavlensky participated in the alumni and students art exhibition Oculus Two organized by the Pro Arte Foundation. In 2013, in front of the State Hermitage Museum in Saint Petersburg, he organized a street art exhibition titled Ghosts of Identity, which came as a project of his Political Propaganda periodical.

Controversies = Sexual assault allegations  In the beginning of 2017, Pavlensky received asylum in France, after he fled Russia with his partner Oksana Shalygina and their children amid allegations of sexual assault against the couple. Media in Russia reported that a young actress from Moscow theatre Teatr.doc, Anastasia Slonina, had accused Pavlensky and Shalygina of sexually assaulting her and then threatening her. Pavlensky denied the allegations and said the investigation was politically motivated; similarities have been noted with the accusations against Russian historian Yury A. Dmitriev. The couple moved from Russia to France in response.  Invasion of privacy  In February 2020, Benjamin Griveaux, a former government minister, lodged a legal complaint following the release of videos of him performing a sex act on himself. Petr Pavlensky and his girlfriend are suspected of invasion of privacy and “broadcasting images of a sexual nature without the permission of the person involved”. Pavlensky allegedly admitted to releasing the video on his website, saying he wanted to expose the minister's “hypocrisy”. Pavlenski was arrested on 14 February 2020 for stabbing two people in a Paris flat during a New Year's Eve party. The police were looking for him since then.  Awards  He was awarded the Václav Havel Prize for Creative Dissent in 2016. The Prize was later withdrawn after Pavlensky announced his intention to dedicate it (and its monetary award) to an insurgent group and then explicitly endorsed the use of violence as a valid method to combat government oppression. Pavlensky was also nominated for Russia's \\"Innovation\\" art prize in 2016, but was later barred by the National Centre for Contemporary Art on the grounds that he had broken the law, prompting four members of the jury to leave in protest.

It was included in Frost's third collection of poetry Mountain Interval, which was published in 1916. Consisting of 59 lines, it is one of Robert Frost's most anthologized poems. Along with other poems that deal with rural landscape and wildlife, it shows Frost as a nature poet. Background Frost's writing of this poem was inspired by another similar poem \\"Swinging on a Birch-tree\\" by American poet Lucy Larcom and his own experience of swinging birch trees at his childhood. Frost once said \\"it was almost sacrilegious climbing a birch tree till it bent, till it gave and swooped to the ground, but that's what boys did in those days\\". Written in 1913–1914, \\"Birches\\" first appeared in Atlantic Monthly in the August issue of 1915 and was later collected in Frost's third book Mountain Interval (1916).The Robert Frost Encyclopedia Text Birches Summary When the speaker (the poet himself) sees a row of bent birches in contrast to straight trees, he likes to think that some boy has been swinging them. He then realizes that it was not a boy, rather the ice storms that had bent the birches. On a winter morning, freezing rain covers the branches with ice, which then cracks and falls to the snow-covered ground. The sunlight refracts on the ice crystals, making a brilliant display. When the truth strikes the speaker, he still prefers his imagination of a boy swinging and bending the birches. The speaker says he also was a swinger of birches when he was a boy and wishes to be so now. When he becomes weary of this world, and life becomes confused, he would like to go toward heaven by climbing a birch tree and then coming back again, because earth is the right place for love. Analysis This poem is written in blank verse, with a particular emphasis on the \\"sound of sense\\". For example, when Frost describes the cracking of the ice on the branches, his selections of syllables create a visceral sense of the action taking place: \\"Soon the sun's warmth makes them shed crystal shells / Shattering and avalanching on the snow crust — / Such heaps of broken glass to sweep away...\\" Originally, this poem was called \\"Swinging Birches\\", a title that perhaps provides a more accurate depiction of the subject. In writing this poem, Frost was inspired by his childhood experience with swinging on birches, which was a popular game for children in rural areas of New England during the time. Frost's own children were avid \\"birch swingers\\", as demonstrated by a selection from his daughter Lesley’s journal: \\"On the way home, i climbed up a high birch and came down with it and i stopped in the air about three feet and pap cout me.\\" In the poem, the act of swinging on birches is presented as a way to escape the hard rationality or \\"Truth\\" of the adult world, if only for a moment. As the boy climbs up the tree, he is climbing toward \\"heaven\\" and a place where his imagination can be free. The narrator explains that climbing a birch is an opportunity to \\"get away from earth awhile / And then come back to it and begin over.\\" A swinger is still grounded in the earth through the roots of the tree as he climbs, but he is able to reach beyond his normal life on the earth and reach for a higher plane of existence. Frost highlights the narrator's regret that he can no longer find this peace of mind from swinging on birches. Because he is an adult, he is unable to leave his responsibilities behind and climb toward heaven until he can start fresh on the earth. In fact, the narrator is not even able to enjoy the imagined view of a boy swinging in the birches. In the fourth line of the poem, he is forced to acknowledge the \\"Truth\\" of the birches: the bends are caused by winter storms, not by a boy swinging on them. Significantly, the narrator's desire to escape from the rational world is inconclusive. He wants to escape as a boy climbing toward heaven, but he also wants to return to the earth: both \\"going and coming back\\". The freedom of imagination is appealing and wondrous, but the narrator still cannot avoid returning to \\"Truth\\" and his responsibilities on the ground; the escape is only a temporary one. The poem is full of ambiguity and it has got a very aesthetic sense to it. Overview Written in conversational language, the poem constantly moves between imagination and fact, from reverie to reflection. In the opening, the speaker employs an explanation for how the birch trees were bent. He is pleased to think that some boys were swinging them when he is suddenly reminded that it is actually the ice-storm that bends the trees. Thus, the poem makes some shift of thought in its description. An abrupt shift occurs when the speaker yearns to leave this earth because of its confusion and make a heaven-ward journey. But the speaker does not want to die by leaving earth forever. He wants to come back to this earth, because to the speaker, the earth is, though not perfect, a better place for going on. The speaker is not one who is ready to wait for the promise of afterlife. The love expressed here is for life and himself. This shows Frost's agnostic side where heaven is a fragile concept to him.Deirdre J. Fagan (2007), p. 43 This becomes clear when he says, \\"the inner dome of heaven had fallen.\\" Rich metaphoric thinking and imagery abound in the poem, where Frost presents some sharp descriptions of natural phenomena. Form The poem is written in blank verse. The language is conversational (use of first person \\"I\\" and second person \\"You\\".)

Astrid Lindgren wrote the lyrics and Georg Riedel composed the music. The song's three verses were performed by Lena Wisborg (as Ida) in the 1973 film Emil and the Piglet. \\"Idas sommarvisa\\" has three verses, and is often sung during graduations, where it has been seen as a popular non- religious alternative to \\"Den blomstertid nu kommer\\" and \\"I denna ljuva sommartid\\".

He has a degree in Civil Engineering from the University of Newcastle. Before entering politics, he ran his own construction company, which built John Hunter Hospital. In 2008 he won the Hunter Business Chamber 2008 Business Person of the Year, and in 2009 he won the City of Newcastle Medal. McCloy campaigned for the removal the rail line through the centre of Newcastle and, despite being nominally an independent, supported Liberal candidates in the Council ward elections. Polling day in 2012 was marked by controversy when the running mate of an opposing candidate switched sides to support McCloy. In 2012, McCloy met the then Opposition Leader (and future Prime Minister of Australia) Tony Abbott to discuss the future of the Newcastle CBD. In 2013, he held a joint press conference with Abbott and Newcastle victims of the Bali bombings in support of Abbott's proposed legislation to assist victims of terrorism overseas. McCloy opposed rainbow crossings in support of Gay rights, referring to them as \\"nonsense\\", and used council resources to remove them, despite claims they did not breach any laws. After Lake Macquarie and Cessnock councils expressed support for the rainbow crossings, McCloy attacked Cessnock as a \\"bloody mess\\" and threatened to arrange for Lake Macquarie City Council chambers to be \\"chalked with half a ton of chalk\\". McCloy appeared at a hearing of the Independent Commission Against Corruption 14 August 2014 relating to Operation Spicer, an investigation into allegations of corrupt conduct in relation to the 2011 elections in New South Wales. He was recalled to give further evidence on Friday 12 September 2014.. Tim Owen, the Liberal member for Newcastle, and Andrew Cornwell, the Liberal member for Charlestown, each admitted accepting amounts of $10,000 from McCloy. As a result, both Owen and Cornwell resigned from parliament on 12 August 2014. On 17 August 2014, McCloy resigned as Lord Mayor of Newcastle, effective immediately. He said his resignation was due to ongoing controversy over his appearance before the Independent Commission Against Corruption, which he said \\"may effect [sic] the proper functioning\\" of Newcastle City Council. In 2015, McCloy's attempts to overturn part of a New South Wales Act of Parliament, enacted to prevent developers from making political donations, were rejected by the High Court of Australia. The case was significant in Australian constitutional law, as it clarified the extent to which the Constitution of Australia provides an implied freedom of political communication, and expanded on the proportionality test developed in Lange v Australian Broadcasting Corporation.. Corruption findings by Independent Commission Against Corruption In 2016, The NSW Independent Commission Against Corruption released a report on their investigation codenamed Operation Spicer. Operation Spicer was an 'Investigation into NSW Liberal Party Electoral Funding for the 2011 State Election Campaign and Other Matters'. In 2011, Jeff McCloy, as a property developer, was a banned donor, to parties and candidates in state elections as state governments have jurisdiction over land appropriations etc. in Australia. McCloy not only made political donations, he made so many large cash payments to Members of Parliament that he referred to himself in the Independent Commission Against Corruption hearings as a 'Walking ATM'. The NSW Independent Commission Against Corruption sought to prove that Jeff McCloy intentionally made covert payments to state government election candidates and that McCloy was aware that his donations were illegal because of his 'developer' status. It was reported by the Sydney Morning Herald that Cardiff vet Andrew Cornwell was in the middle of an operation on a dog when he was summoned outside by McCloy. McCloy handed Cornwell $10,000 in cash, cash that was later used to fund Cornwell's state parliament election campaign. On 30 August 2016, the Newcastle Herald reported that MCloy called Independent Commission Against Corruption 'A $20m waste of time'. 47% of Fairfax's online respondents agreed with McCloy's view. McCloy described the factual findings against him as 'a parking fine, a speeding fine'. Correlation between the corruption findings and McCloy Group developments Listed in the 'Principal Factual Findings made by the NSW Independent Commission Against Corruption in regards to Operation Spicer are the below references to Jeff McCloy. Finding Reference Group 1: Regarding The Seat of Port Stephens Quote page 22 of the commission's report: \\"In 2007, Craig Baumann, the NSW Liberal Party candidate for the seat of Port Stephens, entered into an arrangement with Mr McCloy and Mr (Hilton) Grugeon to disguise from the Election Funding Authority the fact that companies associated with Mr McCloy and Mr Grugeon had donated $79,684 towards Mr Baumann’s 2007 NSW election campaign.\\" Finding Reference Group 1 Correlation with Development: Craig Baumann held the seat of Port Stephens in the NSW Parliament from 2007 to 2015. McCloy Group has developments within the Port Stephens state seat areas including The Bower (Medowie, NSW) and Potter's Lane (Raymond Terrace, NSW) Finding Reference Group 2: Regarding The State Seat of Newcastle Quote page 20 of the commission's report: \\"In about February 2011, Jeffrey McCloy gave Hugh Thomson $10,000 in cash as a political donation to fund Mr Owen’s 2011 election campaign for the seat of Newcastle with the intention of evading the Election Funding Act laws relating to the ban on the making of political donations by property developers and the applicable cap on political donations. Quote page 21 of the commission's report: \\"Mr (Mike) Gallacher was responsible for proposing to Mr McCloy and Mr (Hilton) Grugeon an arrangement whereby each of them would contribute to the payment of Luke Grant for his work on Mr Owen’s 2011 election campaign. He did so with the intention that the Election Funding Act laws in relation to the prohibition on political donations from property developers and the requirements for the disclosure of political donations to the Election Funding Authority would be evaded...\\" Quote page 21 of the commission's report: Mr Owen, Mr Thompson, Mr Grugeon and Mr McCloy were parties to an arrangement whereby payments totalling $19,875 made to Mr Grant for his work on Mr Owen’s 2011 election campaign were falsely attributed to services allegedly provided to companies operated by Mr McCloy and Mr Grugeon. Finding Reference Group 2 Correlation with Development: Part a Jeff McCloy and McCloy Group has ongoing commercial development concerns within the Newcastle State seat locality, including 'City Exchange' and 'Telstra Civic'. Both sites will benefit significantly from the highly controversial Newcastle Transport Interchange and Light Rail due for completion in 2019, a major infrastructure project implemented by the NSW Liberal state government. Finding Reference Group 2 Correlation with Development: Part b McCloy Group's 'City Exchange' is tenanted by a gym owned by Wests Group. Wests Group are a not-for-profit gambling entity that, according to its 2017 Annual Report', made $143m in revenue in the year ending January 2017. As a group whose business interests are primarily involved in gambling, Wests Group are an illegal donor to political candidates in NSW, and as Lord Mayor of Newcastle and proprietor of McCloy group, incomes from Wests Group to Jeff McCloy or McCloy Group are considered indirect political donations.  Other Hunter Street property concerns  Relative to the highly controversial Newcastle Interchange, McCloy bought the Blackwoods property at Hannell St, Wickham in December 2006, the former Hunter Water headquarters at 591 Hunter Street in October 2007 (since subdivided, with the 591-address property sold and the 593-601 address retaining its heritage exterior), and a half shareholding of 356 Hunter Street in 2009. 591 Hunter Street and 356 Hunter Street are multi-block buildings that are on the Light Rail route, planned for completion in 2019. The Newcastle Herald reported that in late 2007, McCloy bought the former Toymasters building at 615 Hunter Street, which was sold by McCloy in 2009. As of December 2017, 615 Hunter Street is tenanted by the NSW Department of Family and Community Services. The address 615 Hunter Street Newcastle West is on the Light Rail route. Also in late 2007, McCloy bought 'the former Churchills building' at 633 Hunter Street Newcastle West, which he sold in February 2015. In 2008, McCloy bought The Lucky Country Hotel, now known as The Lucky, which was one of only two of his Hunter Street purchases that saw development under his tenure. Over a ten year spending spree which included Hunter Street properties plus other holdings (a commercial property in Brown Street, a stately 'town' home in Church Street and Bolton Street's 'Legacy House' (now demolished and replaced with apartments) McCloy claims to have suffered $15.7 million in losses.

In 1941 it came to the aid of Hollywood Independent Church, a Japanese-American congregation, by safeguarding the church's property and homes of its members after they were sent to internment camps. All of the ministers in Mount Hollywood's history have been pacifists. The church's altar has a wooden cross made from camphor wood off of a tree in the yard of a church that had been bombed in Hiroshima. The cross is inscribed with \\"He is our peace.\\" The Rev. Anne Cohen was installed as the church's pastor on Nov. 3, 2013.

The center was established in Efrat in 2008 by Rabbi Dr. Shlomo Riskin, who has been described as \\"the most prominent rabbinic spokesperson to Christian Zionists\\". CJCUC partners with major Christian interfaith organizations such as Christians United for Israel and the International Christian Embassy Jerusalem. Since Riskin's retirement as president of Ohr Torah Stone in 2018, the overseeing of all CJCUC activities has been turned over to David Nekrutman who has served as the center's chief director since its inception.  History  The ideological groundwork, which led to the eventual establishment of CJCUC in 2008, began to take shape almost 50 years beforehand. In 1964, Rabbi Joseph B. Soloveitchik, the teacher and mentor of CJCUC's Chancellor and Founder, Shlomo Riskin, published an essay entitled \\"Confrontation\\"Confrontation, Tradition 6:2 p5-9, 1964. Reprinted in \\"A Treasury of Tradition\\", Hebrew Publishing Co, NY, 1967. – in which he expounded his views on interfaith dialogue and carefully drew out guidelines which permitted such a dialogue and, in the view of Riskin, not only permitted it but rendered it necessary. At around the same time, fundamental ideological shifts were forming within the ranks of the Catholic Church, and a year after Soloveitchik's essay was published, The Holy See issued Nostra aetate, the Declaration on the Relation of the Church with Non-Christian Religions. Nostra aetate absolved the Jews from the crucifixion of Jesus, and admitted that religious antisemitism had a significant role in laying the foundation for the atrocities perpetrated against the Jewish people. Riskin's academic plunge into Jewish–Christian relations began in the early 1960s when he attended seminars, held by Professor David Flusser, about the Christian Gospels at The Hebrew University of Jerusalem. As an Orthodox Jew, he could pinpoint the parallels for Jesus' teachings within the Hebrew scripture.Shabat HaGadol – translated from Hebrew – page 15 After settling in Efrat, Riskin began to engage with the Christian world. Most of the Christian visitors to Efrat, those who came to hear and learn, were Evangelicals. He formed relations with Rev. Robert Stearns of Eagles' Wings and with Pastor John Hagee.Shabat HaGadol – translated from Hebrew – page 18 Since Riskin's retirement as president of Ohr Torah Stone institutions in 2018, the overseeing of all CJCUC activities has been turned over to David Nekrutman who has served as the center's chief director since its inception.  Activities = Hebraic Bible Study  Rabbi Shlomo Riskin, and CJCUC Executive Director, David Nekrutman, meet with Pope Francis in Rome, Italy, 26 October 2016 Rabbi Shlomo Riskin, CJCUC Chancellor, Rabbi Kenneth Brander, CJCUC Executive Director, David Nekrutman, Pastor John Hagee and Rabbi Aryeh Scheinberg with Israeli Deputy Foreign Minister, Tzipi Hotovely, at an event held in honor of Rabbi Aryeh Scheinberg at the Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs, 11 November 2018 COGIC Bishop of Israel, Glenn Plummer, and First Lady Pauline Plummer handing out Food Care Packages as part of the center's \\"Blessing Bethlehem\\" initiative to help the persecuted Christian community living in Bethlehem, 24 July 2019 CJCUC Executive Director, David Nekrutman, Former Associate Director, Pesach Wolicki, and staff aiding the community of Halamish in an international relief effort carried out by the center, after a series of arson attacks throughout Israel the week before left many homeless, 30 November 2016. CJCUC hosts Christian groups from all over the world for all-day seminars, which include tours of biblical sites such as nearby Jerusalem, the Path of the Patriarchs and the Herodian wells. Among the subjects that the seminar series includes are Jewish–Christian Relations; the Theology of Biblical Holidays; Covenant and Mission; The Ten Commandments; Satan, Evil and Free Will; Judaism and the Ministry of Jesus; and Human Life Created in the Image of God. The center runs educational seminars for students and faculty of Catholic and Protestant seminaries in the United States, Canada, and Europe. It has appointed North American and European directors to coordinate relations with religious leaders on these continents. CJCUC has established a Theological Think Tank, the Institute for Theological Inquiry (ITI),\\"CJCUC Announces the Publication of Covenant & Hope\\" – standardnewswire.com – 10 August 2012 headed by Rabbi Eugene Korn and Dr. Robert Jenson of the Witherspoon Institute, which consists of international scholars and theologians whose tasks are to clarify areas of Jewish and Christian theological agreement and disagreement,Covenant and Hope – Christian and Jewish Reflections – Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing Co. – July 2012 – as well as identify areas of fruitful cooperation. The topics focus on past and present Jewish–Christian Relations, Covenant, Salvation, Biblical Hermeneutics, Religion and Violence, Ethical Monotheism, and Messianism. In May 2011, CJCUC facilitated and sponsored a Yale University student group consisting of Orthodox Jewish and Evangelical Christians to learn the fundamentals of Jewish–Christian relations. In March 2012, CJCUC took Latin American priests and rabbis to learn the fundamentals of Jewish-Catholic relations in the backdrop of the Holy Land. In June 2012, CJCUC partnered with Christians United for Israel to bring 30 Evangelical pastors from the U.S. to learn the fundamentals of Jewish–Christian relations. In February 2013, CJCUC co-sponsored the visit of more than 160 pastors to Israel through the Christians United for Israel organization. In January 2015, CJCUC founder, Rabbi Shlomo Riskin along with CJCUC's Executive Director, David Nekrutman, addressed a group of 400 pastors and rabbis at a symposium held in Broward County, Florida. In February 2015, on a visit to Oklahoma, Rabbi Riskin unveiled plans for historic high school curricula, being worked on in a joint effort with the government of Israel, detailing advancements in Jewish–Christian relations. In July 2016, CJCUC announced that it was moving its center of operations from Efrat to the Bible Lands Museum in Jerusalem. CJCUC has received funds from Israel's Hertog family, Paul Singer Foundation, Zion's Gate International Foundation, Ministry of Justice, and John Hagee Ministries.  Day to Praise  In October 2014, Riskin became the first Orthodox rabbi to invite Christian visitors to Israel to participate in a \\"praise rally\\" with Jewish interfaith leaders at the Center's headquarters during the holiday of Sukkot. For Sukkot 2012, he hosted a seminar for Christian visitors. In March 2015, he launched the Day to Praise global initiative calling out to Christians worldwide to join him in reciting Hallel (Psalms 113–118) to praise God on Yom Ha'atzmaut (Israel's Independence Day). Later that year, in 2015, during the festival of Sukkot, CJCUC, together with its founder, Rabbi Shlomo Riskin, the chief rabbi of Efrat, hosted an interfaith event in Efrat in which 200 Christians and Jews came together to sing the praises of God in unity. Riskin said that \\"the prayer event will help usher in the Messianic Age.\\"  Blessing Bethlehem  CJCUC created the first food voucher program to help financially disadvantaged Christian Arabs living in the Land. In September 2016, the center launched the \\"Blessing Bethlehem\\" fundraising initiative at the LifeLight Festival in Sioux Falls, South Dakota in and effort to create a food giveaway program for persecuted Christians in Bethlehem and the surrounding area.  Social activism  In October 2013, CJCUC Executive Director, David Nekrutman published a controversial appeal for funds from Jews to support the purchase of a permanent site for the Christian-Arab church of Pastor Steven Khoury. In May 2014, CJCUC sponsored an interfaith Latin American clergy mission that visited the Ziv Medical Center in Safed, Israel, donating supplies to wounded Syrian civil war refugees. In a September 2015 piece for The Times of Israel, Executive Director, David Nekrutman appealed to the Israeli Ministry of Education in regards to budget cuts and equal funding for Christian Schools in Israel citing these budget cuts as \\"collateral damage\\" of internal political issues and stating that these issues \\"should never oppress minority populations\\". Later, together with The Pave the Way Foundation (PTWF) and the Galilee Center for Studies in Jewish-Christian Relations (CSJCR), CJCUC initiated an international campaign urging the Israeli Prime Minister and Education Ministry to Save Christian Education.  Accomplishments  CJCUC accomplishments include: * In January 2012, CJCUC received the honorary title of Goodwill Ambassador for Jewish–Christian Relations from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. In his letter, the prime minister writes: \\"I believe you are uniquely suited to be an Ambassador of Goodwill for the State of Israel to strengthen relations between Jews and Christians throughout the world. I know that you will continue to promote understanding between Jews and Christians in a spirit of mutual respect that will enable both to work together to better mankind.\\" * CJCUC is on the official body between the Holy See and the Jewish people via IJCIC. In January 2011, Riskin had an audience with Pope Benedict XVI, and in June 2013, CJCUC's Academic Director Rabbi Eugene Korn, along with other members of the organized Jewish establishment, met with Pope Francis. * CJCUC's Executive Director, David Nekrutman, was accepted into the Oral Roberts University online Graduate Theology program, the first Orthodox Jew to do so. In 2011 Nekrutman spoke to Korean Christians at a pro-Israel rally held in Seoul. Nekrutman was the first Orthodox Jew to speak at the Church of God in Christ (COGIC) conference and discuss the importance of visiting Israel. In April 2012, he was the main speaker at CUFI's first international event in Nairobi where over 1,500 Africans attended to support Israel.  Orthodox Rabbinic Statement on Christianity  On 3 December 2015, CJCUC spearheaded a petition of orthodox rabbis from around the world calling for increased partnership between Jews and Christians. The unprecedented statement, entitled \\"To Do the Will of Our Father in Heaven: Toward a Partnership between Jews and Christians\\", was initially signed by over 25 prominent Orthodox rabbis in Israel, United States, and Europe, and now has over 60 signatories. The statement cites traditional opinions by past rabbinic authorities to justify partnership with Christians and religious appreciation of Christianity. In May 2017, the statement was approbated by Rabbi Abraham Skorka of Argentina and Cardinal Christoph Schönborn Archbishop of Vienna.

From the beginning of the colonization of Sainte-Thècle (from 1867), the area around the lake was used for forestry and agriculture. By the mid- 20th Century, the resort has grown intensely. Today, this lake is renowned for its recreo-touristic attractions and activities.  Toponymy  Bank of place names of Commission de toponymie du Québec (Geographical Names Board of Quebec) has 293 names using the term \\"Croche\\".[Commission de toponymie du Québec (Geographical Names Board of Quebec) - Bank of place names - Topographical research conducted on November 9, 2013] In the nineteenth Century, the term \\"Croche\\" has been widely adopted for naming rivers, lakes, streams and roads, during the exploration and colonization of the territories. In Quebec, a large number of homonyms \\"Lac Croche\\" create some confusion. As a result, many names \\"Lac Croche\\" are gradually replaced by more distinctive names. The name \\"Lac Croche\\" was officially registered on December 5, 1968, at the Bank of place names of the Commission de toponymie du Québec  Geography  Croche Lake in Sainte-Thècle is part of a series of lakes in lines in the north-south axis between Hervey- Jonction and Saint-Tite: lac en coeur (Heart Lake), lac des tounes, Croche Lake, lac-aux-chicots (snags lake), lac à la peinture (painting lake), lac Trottier, lac à la perchaude (perch lake) and former lake Kapibouska (formed by a widening of the Rivière des Envies). Due to a geological fracture of bark land, Lac-aux-chicots et lac Croche are located at the foot of a long cliff more or less regular (located on the east side of the chain of lakes). With a length of 3.9 km (including a strait 0.4 km between the mouth and \\"rue Du Pont\\" (street of the bridge), the shape of Lake Croche in Sainte-Thècle is particularly long. The northern part of the lake (the largest in area) looks like a big cucumber slightly misshapen, with a length of 2.4 km and a maximum width of 0.32 km. A pass (approximately 0.53 km in length with a few hooks and berries), connects the northern and southern part of the lake. The connotation \\"Croche\\" is more applicable to this narrow pass. The southern part of the lake (with a length of 0.45 km and a width of 0.35 km) has the shape of a boot with the tip pointing towards the mouth of the lac, on the west side. At the center of this part, the municipality has a giant illuminated fountain. The \\"Lac en Coeur\\" (Heart Lake) at northwest of the hamlet of Hervey-Jonction is the head lake of the \\"Rivière en Coeur\\" (Heart river) that descends to the south through the \\"Lac des Tounes\\" (Lake of Tunes) (with a length of 0,2 km). Lake outlet of \\"Lac des tounes\\" (called \\"Heart River\\") flows from the north into the \\"Lac Croche\\". The mouth of Lake Croche (south-west) drains into a stream that connects the outlet of the \\"Lac-aux-Chicots\\" where Clement Saint-Amand had operated a sawmill at Saint–Michel-South row. The latter discharge flows into the Rivière des Envies. St. Jean Optismist Park that was built on the south-east of the lake, in the heart of the village of Sainte-Thècle, is a popular attraction for residents and visitors, especially in summer. It has a beautiful beach, picnic tables, activity areas for children and a variety of accommodations for the organization of public events. The designated Laurent Naud waterfront promenade from the \\"rue du Pont\\" (street of the bridge) goes up to the Saint-Jean Optimist Park. From this promenade, visitors can contemplate the beauty of the lake.  History  The colonization of the territory of Sainte-Thècle, located in the Lordship of Sainte-Anne-de-la- Pérade began by clearing lots of Rang Saint -Michel, which borders the west side of the \\"Lac aux chicots\\"and \\"Lake Croche\\". At the beginning of the settlement, a first rudimentary road links the \\"rang des Pointes\\" (row of spikes) Saint-Tite to forest land (further north) which was recently opened to settlement. Before the construction of roads and bridges over the culverts, ice roads on Lake Croche and \\"Lac-aux-Chicots\\" (lake of snags) and allow the families of settlers to move to winter Saint-Tite, the main business center of the region, or still to logging camps until Missionary Lake. In summer, the settlers used small boats or barges. This chain lake is bordered on the east side by Rang Saint-Pierre, which is colonized soon after Rang Saint -Michel and Saint-Joseph. Lac Croche served including for the floating logs headed to sawmill of Theophile Magnan and his son Napoleon Magnan, built at the mouth of Lake Croche, near the dam.René Veillette, The Journal Dynamic May 9, 1973, p. 2 column on the history of Sainte-Thècle - \\"The steamer father Christophe\\", stressing that the steamer was used to transport timber to the sawmillGaétan Veillette Journal, Le dynamique, April 3, 1974, p. 4 column on the History of Sainte-Thècle - Le moulin de Théophile Magnan (Mills of Théophile Magnan) Covered bridge of Lake Croche, connecting Rang Saint-Michel North and Du Pont Street in the lower village, was demolished in July 1955 to be replaced by the current bridge. At the coldest peak of the winter, ice on the lake was cut by men on Lake Croche with handed saw in order to fill the coolers of village or rows residents. They lifted the ice with hooks ice. A public warehouse for ice was located at the edge of the lake, near the Tessier street.Gaétan Veillette, Journal Dynamique, November 5, 1975, p. 10, column on the history of Sainte- Thècle – \\"Les glacières du lac Croche\\" (Coolers of Lake Croche)  See also  * Sainte-Thècle * Rivière des Envies * Lordship of Sainte-Anne-de-la-Pérade * Mekinac Regional County Municipality * Batiscanie * Tawachiche River * Tawachiche West River * Batiscan River * Lake Traverse (Mékinac) * Lac des Chicots (Sainte-Thècle)  References  External links  * Municipality of Sainte-Thècle: * Mékinac Regional County Municipality : Category:Lakes of Mauricie Category:Mékinac Regional County Municipality ","title":"Croche Lake (Sainte-Thècle)"},{"id":"41042835","text":"Harry Murray was an Australian VC recipient.

Bata had operated shops in the Netherlands since 1922, and chose to locate in Best because land and labour were cheaply available. It also had good transport links, being at the junction of the Wilhelmina Canal with the Beatrix Canal and close to a railway. The factory it built there in 1933 was an exact copy of the headquarters in Zlín.[Christina Lubinski, Jeffrey Fear, Paloma Fernández Pérez : Family Multinationals: Entrepreneurship, Governance, and Pathways to Internationalization, Routledge, 18 july 2013] At that time, Bata already had 28 shoe shops in the country, and this number grew to 150 in 1961. Many Bata shops had their own shoe repair and pedicure departments. The factory made ladies', men's, children's and sports shoes. So that the employees could live near the factory, Bata built a town of 130 homes, separated from the centre of Best by the canal, along with schools, medical services and a hairdressers'. Bata built other such villages wherever it had factories. Bata promoted order and cleanliness. Thus, the houses in the village have flat roofs, as attics would only encourage people to store clutter. The workers were not allowed to wear clogs, as Bata produced suitable footwear. The emphasis on hygiene can be seen as paternalistic but resulted in a level of welfare that was far ahead of its time. The company also established sports clubs, a theatre, a brass band and a volunteer fire brigade.Guido de Vries, op.cit. From the 1960s shoe production was moved to low-wage countries and Batadorp was sold to the municipality of Best. The network of shops - even the factory shop - had closed by 1996. The original buildings of Batadorp are now an industrial heritage site. However, production continues at a reduced level. It now belongs to the Bata Protective division which was created in 1970 and makes speciality shoes. In 2008 about 160 employees produced 900,000 pairs of safety shoes and 1 million pairs of safety socks. The headquarters of the global division is located there.M.

It describes a world in which the sky undergoes a transformation that prevents people from seeing the stars, giving them instead a view of the other side of the world, as if the Earth had been turned inside out. Accompanying this transformation are increased reports of UFO activity and the appearance of large circles of black glass at thousands of locations across the planet. Once the panic dies down, people resume their normal lives. Meanwhile, a shadowy government agency begins experiments using \\"quantum intrusions\\" to travel to other worlds. Plot summary Cornell Novak grows up with his father, a UFO investigator, who travels frequently to investigate reports of lights in the sky, alien abductions, and the continuing appearances of circles of black glass at random locations, including Central Park in New York City. Cornell's mother disappeared when he was four, an event that his father says was alien abduction. They live in a slightly seedy suburban cul- de-sac with fortunately tolerant neighbors, who turn a blind eye to Cornell's father's unwillingness to carry out the usual suburban chores. One night when Cornell is about 11 years old, he is out looking at the night sky when the stars disappear and are replaced by a view of the daylight side of the Earth. It quickly becomes apparent that the entire planet has a similar view. Politicians and scientists rush to control the situation, assuring people that the effect is some kind of illusion, since spacecraft in orbit are unaffected and can still see the stars and planets normally. However one Russian mathematician proposes an alternative theory. According to this, the entire universe was restructured by other intelligences long ago. The infinite universe that was previously visible is only one way of looking at spacetime. Other ways exist that see the universe as a connected set of structures that enclose each planet. At some point the observation of the sky by the inhabitants of each planet causes the view of infinity to \\"evert\\", replacing one view of the universe with another equally valid one. Cornell grows up to become a drifter of sorts. He moves from job to job, city to city. His father becomes moderately famous for a while during the period after the sky eversion. Cornell signs up for a pharmaceutical testing program to earn some money, but quickly realizes it is a cover for something else. He is recruited by the \\"CEA\\" or Cosmic Event Agency to travel to other worlds through \\"quantum intrusions\\". These act like portals with one special property. Anybody passing through to the other side is transformed into a copy of the closest matching species on the other side. No artifacts of any kind can be carried through. In effect, only the mind travels to the other world and back. Cornell befriends a woman called Porsche Neal, a former professional basketball player. She is part of an expedition to a world referred to as \\"High Desert\\". In that world, the major intelligent species appears to consist of individuals with seven separate bodies: six mobile bipeds with limbs and a single limbless sphere containing the brain that controls the other bodies telepathically. The bipeds drag the brain around using its long hair. Humans have to learn to deal with senses that give them six different views of the world simultaneously. Some go mad in the process. In High Desert no actual members of the native species have been encountered. The team from Earth is kept busy constructing buildings using stone age technology, since there are no metals for them to use. They are also trying to construct bridges across the canyons that confine them to a high plateau, moving towards a place where their telepathic senses tell them there is some kind alien habitation. The work is dangerous and occasionally claims the life of one or more of an individual's selves, and sometimes even the brain. Porsche and Cornell become close and fall in love. At the same time, Logan, the expedition leader, is becoming erratic. Eventually he falls under the influence of the telepathic presence they all feel. It consists of a giant brain that controls thousands of bodies in a city in the lowlands. All the expedition are transported to the city where the brain intends to absorb them. However Porsche is able to communicate with the brain and persuade it to let a few of them return to prevent others coming to the world. They are allowed just enough bodies to drag their brains back to the portal, many kilometers away. At this point Cornell confesses his suspicions to Porsche. She is not just another explorer from Earth, but originally came from another planet altogether using a portal. Porsche admits that this is true. Her people wander from world to world gaining knowledge of different cultures. She joined the project to locate others with the talent to use the portals. The glass disks represent portals to safe worlds, but they can only be opened by equipment that her people know how to make. The portals used by the CEA are not safe, but can be opened by the brute force of the equipment that the CEA has made. The CEA has been growing rich and influential by exploiting technological knowledge found on other worlds, but is becoming aware that others like Porsche know how to use the portals. The knowledge of the portals is being kept secret, which makes it dangerous for Porsche's people to reveal themselves. Porsche and Cornell manage to get themselves discharged from the project after the High Desert debacle. The casualties are covered up by staging a plane crash at sea. Cornell seeks out his father, from whom he has been estranged since he discovered that his mother simply left, and had not been abducted as his father claimed. His father is living on some land he bought that has one of the glass disks on it. Cornell tries to tell him about the intrusions, but finds he has been conditioned to be unable to do this. However Porsche can reveal the truth about the glass disk. Placing a few innocent-looking tools on the disk activates it. Standing on the center Cornell can look up and see all the other disks as points of light across the world. Sequel This novel is followed by Beneath the Gated Sky, in which Porsche and Cornell have to deal with the CEA and other alien visitors who do not simply explore other worlds, but try to disrupt their societies so they can take over.

Marion Mitchell-Wilson served as its Executive Director from its inception until 2012 when she stepped down due to health reasons. Cati Porter, acclaimed Riverside poet and editor, became Executive Director of the Inlandia Institute after Mitchell-Wilson's departure. History The Inlandia Institute began as a result of the anthology Inlandia: A Literary Journey Through California's Inland Empire published by Heyday Books in 2006. The positive response to the book - which provided the Inland Empire its first cohesive literary identity by bringing together in one literary endeavor a selection of the diverse communities that comprise the region - made it clear that there was a demand for more literary content from and about the Inland Empire. Shortly after the publication of the anthology, Malcolm Margolin, founder and owner of Heyday Books, began receiving numerous requests for more literary content produced by area residents. After a book launch event in Palm Desert, Margolin and Mitchell-Wilson met with Riverside Public Library director Barbara Custen to discuss ways to build upon the success of the book. It was Custen who coined the term \\"Inlandia Institute\\". The City of Riverside and Heyday Books entered into a Memorandum of Understanding to establish the Inlandia Institute in August 2007. The Institute incorporated as an independent non-profit organization in 2009, at which point it moved out of the Riverside Public Library to its current space in downtown Riverside.

In 1873, two Cape gauge saddle-tank locomotives with a 0-4-0 wheel arrangement were placed in construction service by Mac Donald & Company, contractors to the Port Elizabeth and Uitenhage Railway Company. When the contract was completed in 1875, the railway and the locomotives were taken over by the Midland System of the Cape Government Railways. A third locomotive, built to the same design, was delivered to the Western System in Cape Town in 1874. These were the first Cape gauge locomotives to enter service in South Africa.Pioneer, Little Bess & Mliss Cape railways expansion When the control of railways in the Cape of Good Hope was taken over by the Colonial Government on 1 January 1873 and the Cape Government Railways (CGR) was established with the object of railways expansion, a Select Committee was appointed to study the question of track gauge. The choice which had to be made was between the existing Standard gauge of and the narrower gauge of , which would effect savings of up to one-third on construction cost.Soul of A Railway - System 1 – Part 1: Cape Town prior to the Second World War (Accessed on 26 November 2016) The CGR Chief Railway Engineer William George Brounger was opposed to the adoption of a narrower gauge on the grounds that, while initial cost would be less, operating costs would be higher. The narrow gauge had been proposed by civil engineer R. Thomas Hall, Superintendent of the narrow gauge Redruth and Chacewater Railway in Cornwall, who was involved in the construction, beginning in 1869, of the Namaqualand Railway which was being built to that gauge between Port Nolloth and O'okiep for the Cape Copper Mining Company. The committee, with a three- to-one vote, settled on a compromise between the two recommended gauges and the Cape gauge came into existence in Southern Africa. Manufacturer The first three locomotives for the new Cape gauge lines were built by Manning Wardle & Company in 1873 and 1874. The first two, ex works on 12 March and 3 May 1873 respectively, were delivered in 1873 to Mac Donald & Company, contractors to the Port Elizabeth and Uitenhage Railway Company in Port Elizabeth. The contractors named them Pioneer and Little Bess respectively. (Accessed on 18 August 2016) The third locomotive, ex works on 6 February 1874, was delivered to the Western System in Cape Town in 1874 and was numbered W46 in the Western's number range. Johnston link-and-pin coupler From the arrival of the first railway locomotive in South Africa, the Cape Town Railway & Dock 0-4-0T of 1859, all railway rolling stock had been equipped with buffers-and-chain coupling, variations of which are still in use in the United Kingdom and Europe.Espitalier, T.J.; Day, W.A.J. (1943). The Locomotive in South Africa - A Brief History of Railway Development. Chapter I - The Period of the 4 ft. 8½ in. Gauge. South African Railways and Harbours Magazine, June 1943. pp. 437-440. Johnston link-and-pin coupler These locomotives of 1873 introduced the bell-shaped Johnston link-and-pin coupler, commonly known as a bell link-and-pin coupler, which was to become the standard coupler on Cape gauge rolling stock in the Cape of Good Hope, the Colony of Natal and the Zuid-Afrikaansche Republiek. In South Africa, all new Cape gauge locomotives and rolling stock acquired between 1873 and 1927 were equipped with these or similar couplers.Suid-Afrikaanse Vervoerdienste (South African Transport Services) (1983). Passassierswa- en Trokhandboek (Passenger Carriage and Truck Manual), Vol 1, Hoofstukke 1-15 (Chapters 1-15). South African Transport Services, 1983. Chapter 13. Cape Midland System By 1872, Port Elizabeth already possessed extensive Standard gauge trackage between the harbour and Swartkops, but trains were still animal-hauled. Work by contractors Mac Donald's on railway expansion from Port Elizabeth into the interior commenced in June 1872. The two locomotives which were delivered to them in 1873 were utilised as construction engines. The first train ran as far as Sydenham in October 1873, and of railway was completed by 1874. When the two new lines were opened in 1875, northwestward to Uitenhage and northward from Swartkops to Barkly Bridge, the lines and the construction locomotives were taken over by the CGR and the locomotives were numbered M1 and M2 for the Midland System. These two locomotives, together with a smaller engine named Mliss which joined them on construction work in 1874, are considered the pioneers of locomotives over the greater part of the Midland System. Cape Western System By 1874, when the third of the first three locomotives, no. W46, was delivered to the Western System, construction work was proceeding in two directions from Wellington. New Cape gauge track was being laid deeper into the interior towards Worcester, while track dual-gauging was being undertaken back from Wellington towards Cape Town.

The Wonder was one of the best horses of his generation in France at two, three and four years of age: his wins included the Prix de Condé, Critérium de Saint-Cloud, Prix Greffulhe, Prix d'Ispahan, Prix Edmond Blanc and Prix Jacques Le Marois. In 1983 he was transferred to the United States where he won the San Bernardino Handicap, Century Handicap and Californian Stakes. He was then retired to stud where he had moderate success as a sire of winners. Background The Wonder was a \\"tall, lengthy\\" dark brown horse with no white markings bred in France by Alain du Breil, the president of the Societe de Steeple-Chases, the governing body of French jump racing. He was the only horse of any consequence sired by Wittgenstein, a Florida-bred stallion who won the Critérium de Maisons-Laffitte in 1973. The Wonder was the first foal of The Lark, the only Thoroughbred mare owned by du Breil. She later produced the Badener Sprint-Cup winner Areias. The Wonder originally raced in the colours of du Breil's wife and was trained by Jacques de Chevigny. Racing career=1980: two-year-old season After finishing fourth in a race over 1100 metres on his racecourse debut, The Wonder won a race over 1400m at Évry Racecourse and the Prix des Foals at Deauville Racecourse in August. The colt was then moved up in class and distance for the Group Three Prix Saint-Roman over 1800m at Longchamp Racecourse on 4 October. Ridden by Alain Lequeux he finished strongly to finish third of the eight runners, beaten a neck and a head by Mariacho and Arc d'Or. Two weeks later, The Wonder was moved up to 2000m for the Group Three Prix de Condé on soft ground at Longchamp. Ridden by Yves Saint-Martin he was in fifth place 150m from the finish but produced a strong late run on the inside to take the lead in the final strides and won by a neck from Ledmir. The Wonder ended his first season in the Critérium de Saint-Cloud (then a Group Two race) on 17 November in which he was ridden by Alfred Gibert. Starting the 2.2/1 second favourite he took the lead 300m from the finish and won by a length from Mont Pelion. In their annual Racehorses of 1980, the independent Timeform organisation described The Wonder as a \\"stayer\\", who would require \\"at least a mile and a quarter\\" to show his best form. 1981: three-year-old season On his three-year-old debut, The Wonder finished second to No Lute in the Prix Greffulhe over 2100m at Longchamp, but was awarded the race after the winner's post-race urine test showed traces of Nandrolone, an anabolic steroid. No Lute was cleared to run in the Prix Lupin on 17 May and beat The Wonder by three lengths. The Wonder moved up in distance to contest the Prix du Jockey Club over 2400m at Chantilly Racecourse on 7 June. Ridden by Lester Piggott he faded in the closing stages and finished tenth of the twelve runners behind Bikala. On 4 July, The Wonder was matched against older horses for the first time in the Group One Prix d'Ispahan over 1900m at Longchamp. Ridden by Lequeux, he started a 13/1 outsider in a field which included the Poule d'Essai des Poulains winner Recitation, the Poule d'Essai des Pouliches winner Aryenne, the Prix Jean Prat winner Cresta Rider, the Prix du Jockey Club runner-up Akarad and the improving ex-Italian-trained Northjet. The Wonder produced an impressive performance to record his first success at the highest level, winning by two lengths from Northjet, with Cresta Rider three-quarters of a length away in third. The Wonder then contested France's two most important weight-for-age mile races, the Prix Jacques Le Marois at Deauville and the Prix du Moulin at Longchamp. In the former race, he finished fifth in an exceptionally strong field behind Northjet, To-Agori-Mou, Kings Lake and Hilal. In the latter race he finished third beaten one and a half lengths and a nose by Northjet and Hilal. On his final appearance of the season The Wonder was sent to England to contest the Champion Stakes at Newmarket Racecourse on 17 October. Ridden by Gibert, he started at odds of 9/1 despite reports that he had been performing poorly in training. He finished sixth of the sixteen runners behind Vayrann, ahead of many good horses including Master Willie, Madam Gay and Kirtling. 1982: four-year-old season In 1982, The Wonder entered the ownership of the Marquese de Moratalla, who was best known as an owner of steeplechasers such as The Fellow. He began his season in March when he was an easy winner of the Group Three Prix Edmond Blanc over 1600m at Saint-Cloud against moderate opposition. He finished fourth in his next two races including the Lockinge Stakes in England and then finished second to Al Nasr in both the Prix Dollar and the Prix d'Ispahan. In July he again failed to reproduce his best form in Britain, finishing unplaced behind On The House in the Sussex Stakes at Goodwood Racecourse. On 15 August, The Wonder was ridden for the first time by the Irish jockey Pat Eddery in the Group One Prix Jacques Le Marois at Deauville. He started at odds of 6.2/1 in a field which included Green Forest, Zino, Melyno (Poule d'Essai des Poulains), Noalcoholic (Prix Messidor) and Exclusive Order (Prix Maurice de Gheest). Eddery held up the colt in the early stages before producing a strong run to take the lead in the last 200m and won by three-quarters of a length from Green Forest, with Zino a further three-quarters of a length back in third. In September, The Wonder finished second to Green Forest in the Prix du Moulin at Longchamp and on his final appearance he finished second to the Irish-trained three-year-old Pas de Seul in the 1400m Prix de la Forêt in October. In the latter race Eddery was criticised for making his challenge too early, and there was some speculation that he had mistakenly timed his run for the first winning post rather than the second. In late 1982, The Wonder was being advertised as a breeding stallion for 1983, standing at the Haras de Clarbec, but a change of plan saw him sent to continue his racing career in the United States, where he was trained by Charles Whittingham. 1983: five-year-old season The Wonder was based at Santa Anita Park, in the early part of 1983, and opened his American career with a three and a half length win in an allowance race on 27 February. A week later he was moved up in class and carried top weight of 124 pounds the Grade I Santa Anita Handicap on dirt, but finished thirteenth behind Bates Motel. On 17 April The Wonder recorded his first major success in the United States when he won the nine furlong San Bernardino Handicap, beating Konewah and the Strub Stakes winner Swing Till Dawn. The horse then moved to Hollywood Park Racetrack and won the Grade I Century Handicap on Turf on 7 May, ridden by Bill Shoemaker. A month later at the same course, The Wonder contested the Grade I Californian Stakes. He was in last place, more than fifteen lengths behind the leaders in the early stages, but produced a strong late run to win by a nose from Prince Spellbound with Poley in third place. The Wonder's winning run came to an end when he finished seventh, as the 11-10 favourite, behind John Henry in the American Handicap on 4 July. The horse returned to form in August to finish second to Bates Motel in the San Diego Handicap, but then finished unplaced behind Tolomeo in the Budweiser Million later that month. On his final racecourse appearance he finished sixth behind Bel Bolide in the Carleton F. Burke Handicap at Santa Anita in October. Assessment In 1980, the independent Timeform organisation gave The Wonder a rating of 123, eleven pounds below their top-rated two-year-old Storm Bird. In the official International Classification he was rated nine pounds behind Storm Bird. In 1981, Timeform gave the colt a peak annual rating of 129, eleven pounds below Shergar: he was rated the ninth-best European three-year- old in the International Classification. In 1982 he was rated 127 by Timeform and was rated the eighth-best older horse in Europe in the International Classification. Stud record The Wonder stood as a breeding stallion in the United States and France with mixed result. The best of his flat race runners was A Magicman, a German-trained colt whose wins included the Prix de la Forêt, Prix de la Porte Maillot, Ostermann-Pokal, Oettingen-Rennen and Grosse Europa-Meile. The Wonder sired several winners over jumps including Wonder Man who won thirteen races including the Henry VIII Novices' Chase. His last recorded foal was born in 1999. Pedigree The Wonder was inbred 3 x 4 to Nasrullah, meaning that this stallion appears in both the third and fourth generations of his pedigree.

Cheyenne is home to a campus with 45,000 square feet of data center space, as well as administrative and technical support offices. The company has additional data center locations in Washington, Colorado, Oregon, Georgia, Texas, New Jersey, and New York, with sales and marketing offices in Laramie and in Denver, Colorado. As of 2019, the company also operates an IT consulting focused office in Toronto, Ontario.  History  In 2007, three friends hatched the idea for a data center powered exclusively by renewable energy over coffee and soon after began the process of retrofitting a former office building to provision 3000 square feet of colocation space. By March 2012, Green House Data had doubled the footprint in the Cheyenne location, added cloud hosting products, and expanded its footprint to the west coast. In December 2013, an east coast expansion was announced, and by August 2013, the company had broken ground on a new facility in Cheyenne. The second Cheyenne location officially opened on July 30, 2014. In September 2014, 1547 Critical Systems Realty and Green House Data announced that the company would be an anchor tenant in a redevelopment at 1 Ramland Road in Orangeburg, New York. In April 2015, the company acquired FiberCloud, a Seattle, Washington-based provider of colocation, cloud hosting, and other data center services. With this acquisition, Green House Data added three data centers in Washington state, as well as nearly 20 employees and several hundred customers. In April 2017, the company acquired Cirracore, a cloud-focused infrastructure provider based in Atlanta, Georgia. In November 2017, the company acquired Ajubeo, a cloud hosting service provider based in Denver. Green House Data announced a merger via acquisition of Infront Consulting Group in May 2018, expanding operations to Toronto and Las Vegas, as well as other satellite sites, while adding over 30 IT consulting staff focusing on Microsoft Azure, cloud automation, and IT consulting. Emerging Markets The company is part of a new surge in data center construction in the Cheyenne region and across the Rocky Mountains. Cheyenne has been ranked as a top 5 location for data centers, with Microsoft, Echostar, and the National Center for Atmospheric Research all operating facilities in the city. In addition, Green House Data's most facility in Orangeburg represents entry into the Rockland County market, which is just beginning to emerge as a new data center cluster. It is home to facilities operated by both Bloomberg L.P. and Verizon. Everett and Bellingham, Washington represent markets on the I-5 Corridor have been historically underserved.  Sustainable energy  As a whole, the data center industry has been highly criticized for heavy electrical use, and in recent years has actively tried to reduce power consumption by improving facility design and increasing server virtualization. As a key element of their business model, Green House Data purchases renewable energy credits, or RECs, for wind power and documents purchases with the EPA's Green Power Partnership. In 2013, Green House Data was part of EPA's \\"Leadership Club\\" for sustainable power purchases. A common measure for data center power consumption is Power usage effectiveness, often abbreviated PUE. Beginning in 2014, Green House Data was the first company to participate in WyoRECs, the first renewable energy credit program based out of Wyoming. In April 2015, Green House Data joined the EPA's Top 30 Tech & Telecom list of the largest green power users, retiring over 8 million kilowatt-hours (kWh) of green power annually. By 2017, the company moved up 5 places on the list, retiring 20,270,000 kWhs. NPR's All Things Considered called Green House Data's energy efficiency an \\"obsession.\\"  Compliance  In July 2011, the company's cloud and colocation facilities achieved SSAE 16 Type II Compliance. Additionally, in 2012, Green House Data achieved HIPAA IT compliance.  Data Centers  Green House Data operates a total of seven data center facilities in five geographic regions.

Predecessor The bridges were conceived as part of the Innerbelt Freeway rebuild to replace the 1959 Innerbelt Bridge, and the schedule of the project to build them was accelerated due to the deteriorating condition of the Innerbelt Bridge.

It opened to Ontario Street ramp traffic on November 9, 2013, had opened to other ramp traffic and I-90 westbound mainline traffic by November 17, and opened to eastbound traffic, which used the westbound bridge until the completion of the eastbound bridge, on November 23. The bridge was dedicated to George Voinovich during the ribbon-cutting ceremony on November 8, 2013. Eastbound bridge The eastbound bridge was built in the former location of the Innerbelt Bridge.

In August 2014, Rushton was interviewed by CNN about online advertising fraud moving away from bot fraud, in which a series of fake computers simulate a sentient being watching ads, to a type of fraud involving a genuine audience watching low-quality impressions, which are converted into premium inventory, with the fraudulent impressions sold to large advertisers.

It first aired on the Fox network in the United States on April 13, 2014. It was written by J. Stewart Burns and directed by Bob Anderson. The episode is a sequel to \\"Future-Drama\\" and a continuation of \\"Holidays of Future Passed\\", set 30 years from the present. In this futuristic installment, Bart goes to a clinic to rid himself of his feelings for his ex-wife Jenda (who is now dating a xenomorph-like alien named Jerry), Lisa must choose whether or not to cure her zombie husband Milhouse after he gets bitten by a homeless zombie, and Marge (after putting up with years of Homer dying and being cloned back to life by Professor Frink) loads Homer onto a flatscreen monitor and throws him out of the house. Plot Marge wakes to find Homer atop of the kitchen table in nothing but his underwear, and gives him advice on his health. Just when Homer seems to be taking Marge's words to heart, he marches upstairs to tell his wife that he will take his health seriously only to fall down the stairs and die. At his funeral, Professor Frink announces that he has made a clone of Homer, and Marge warns Homer to take this second chance seriously. After thirty years of clones dying, Frink cannot bring Homer back, but has stored his memory in a flash drive, which he plugs into a television screen. When Marge realizes that her husband is just a face on a screen, she is fed up with him, and gives the flash drive to Bart, so that Homer can reside with him until she can figure out a way to get used to him in his current form. Bart shows Homer his new digs, an abandoned classroom at Springfield Elementary. As soon as a glum Bart sends his two sons to his ex-wife Jenda's house, he needs advice more than ever now, but Homer is of no use when the monitor freezes. Working at a dinosaur amusement park, Bart laments that he misses his children. Elsewhere at Lisa's zombie soup kitchen, her husband Milhouse is attacked by a zombie. Unable to move on from his ex, Bart sees a targeted billboard telling him to move on using shock therapy that makes him forget. After the procedure, Bart visits Marge, who claims to not miss Homer that much, but in an attempt to initiate a conversation between her and Homer, he sees she does miss Homer. Homer returns to normal when Bart starts to get back into the dating scene, and sleeps with one woman after another, including Lisa's former teacher, Miss Hoover. At Bart's apartment, Homer gets a new lease of life in a robot suit. Bart's sons visit him and ask him to help Jenda out with her depression. She shows up in tears, telling Bart that after she bought a shedding tank for Jerry, her alien boyfriend, he humiliated her and broke up with her for someone else. Bart comforts her by mentioning he is trying to get his life on track and her crying is a reminder of what he lost. Jenda is impressed by Bart's newfound maturity and invites him to dinner. It goes well and the two decide to patch up their relationship again. However, the two later fall into their bad habits of not paying attention to each other that destroyed their marriage the first time, and become unsure whether to continue working things out. Meanwhile, Lisa and zombie Milhouse are attacked by bullies, and Lisa actually finds it attractive that Milhouse fights them off. She does not want him cured and is stalked by Dr. Hibbert who is not happy about her decision. Bart and Lisa both go to Moe's to deal with their respective marital problems, where Marge tells them to stick through. She then electrocutes herself to death in order to live in the flash drive with Homer. Milhouse is cured and Bart moves on from Jenda, discovering that she has started seeing Jerry again. Bart then finds himself back in the therapist's chair, and learns that what he experienced was just a neural implant. Bart and Lisa visit Marge and find out that she and Homer have finally gotten back together, and she gave him a new robot body and personality. Bart recommends Lisa try moving on if things do not work out with her and Milhouse, but Lisa points out that Milhouse is still a zombie and there is no cure, much to her own affection, and Santa's Little Helper (who is now a hybrid of him and the family cat, Snowball) is seen talking. Reception Dennis Perkins of The A.V. Club gave the episode a C, saying \\"Things are even worse for The Simpsons after tonight's sequel, 'Days Of Future Future,' where Burns returns to the (it seems) inevitable sci-fi future of the series and limits the show's world even more. Losing much of the heart of its predecessor in favor of the sort of ill-conceived and contradictory character arcs the latter, scattershot Simpsons has become notorious for, 'Days Of Future Future' reveals a series willing to shrug off what it still could be. Instead, this future Simpsons world seems just a playground for writers to use up whatever Futurama jokes they had left over.\\" Tony Sokol of Den of Geek gave the episode four out of five stars, saying \\"The Simpsonss 'Days of Future Future' is a laugh every 2.5 seconds, allowing for wind resistance. A very worth entry into what will someday be an even longer running longest running show that has ever walked slowly up a flight of stairs. I absolutely love Jerry, Bart's future ex-wife's new soon to be ex-Alien lover. Nelson's mom still has to strip at the age of 87 because there is no more retirement. Even with 99 Democrats in the Senate, because the Republican still knows how to get things his way. Of course Ralph Wiggum will be the new chief of police, he is a chip off the old cop. Santa's Little Hybrid is an unnatural progression that Cosmo does not teach about.\\" Teresa Lopez of TV Fanatic gave the episode four out of five stars, saying \\"I always love The Simpsons episodes that show the possible futures of Bart, Lisa, Maggie, Homer and Marge. And this week was no exception. Even though the future episodes are not technically canon (I mean, who can say what will really happen in their future?), I liked that this one attempted some continuity.

In addition there were Zoroastrians living in Oudlajan. Many famous Iranian politicians such as Qavam family, Mostofi Family, Nasiroldoleh, Seyyed Hassan Modarres lived in Oudlajan. The houses with many rooms around a yard (with a small pool in the middle) were called Ghamar khanoom houses. A Mosque in Oudlajan Oudlajan was the wealthiest neighborhood in the Ghajar era and kept its status until the Pahlavi era. However with the big changes in Iranian society in 1340 AH it gradually lost its status. The biggest obstacle to Oudlajan today is the expansion of the Bazar neighborhood. This trend has changed Oudlajan from a wealthy neighborhood into a storage area for Bazar and many old houses were turned into places for addicts.  Etymology  The name Oudlajan in the historic Tati language means the 'place for dividing the water'. Some believe that Oudlajan means 'Abdullah Jan' (Dear Abdullah) in a Jewish dialect.

It is named after John Mynook Pavaloff, a half-Russian/half-native Alaskan, who found gold in the river's valley in 1894. Geography Minook Creek empties into the Yukon River just east of Rampart. It is about long. Near its mouth, it is a shallow stream wide. It flows in a northerly direction through a deep valley whose width varies from a few hundred feet to about a half mile. The creek receives a number of large tributaries from the east— Hunter, Little Minook, Little Minook Junior, Hoosier, Florida, Chapman—and a number of others. From the west, it receives Montana, Ruby, Slate, and Granite creeks and a few small tributaries. Granite Creek, about from the Yukon, is the largest western tributary. Just below the mouth of Slate Creek the Minook spreads into a number of branches in a wide gravel flat. This flat, which is typical of many Alaskan streams, is probably due to a change in the grade of the creek. The stream here is unable to carry the gravels of the swifter water above, and so spreads them upon the flat. Here are found the so-called \\"winter glaciers,\\" which sometimes last through the short summers. In 1904, a quarter or half acre of ice still remained when the September frosts occurred. This ice owes its origin to the fact that the channel which carries the water is greatly contracted by freezing in the fall. The resulting hydrostatic pressure cracks the ice and the water overflows and freezes. This process is repeated until a considerable thickness of ice is accumulated. The valley is V-shaped in cross section, and the eastern slope is often benched, while the western is more abrupt and has remnants of benches at but few places. Five well-marked benches rise at irregular intervals above the floor between Little Minook Junior Creek and Hoosier Creek, the highest of which is about . Important gravels cover the highest one, which lies on the east side of the Minook and extends from Hunter Creek to about above Florida Creek. A small remnant of the same bench is found on the north side of the mouth of Montana Creek and another on the north side of the mouth of Ruby Creek. Other remnants are found on the north side of the mouth of Chapman Creek and at a point about above the Chapman on the same side of Minook Creek. The last two benches show no gravel. On the west side of the creek but few remnants of benches are found. One, about high, extends to a little above the mouth of Hunter Creek, and is probably an extension of a corresponding bench on the south side of the Yukon. It seems probable that all of the benches of Minook Creek may be more or less closely correlated with the benches of the Yukon. In the vicinity of the mouth of Slate Creek is a bench cut in the upturned slates and thin-bedded quartzites to a depth of and covered by of gravel and a foot or more of muck. No gravel has yet been found upon the benches of intermediate height, but further investigation may show its presence. In its upper course the creek flows somewhat north of east for about , and here the topography of its valley is altogether different from that of the lower part. The north side is a long, gentle slope with a greater rise in the upper part, while the south side is steep and the stream flows near its base. The asymmetry of this part of the valley is repeated in Eureka, Pioneer, Hutlina, Omega, New York, California, and many other creeks of the region whose valleys lie in parallel or nearly parallel directions. The rocks in the upper part of the valley are mostly closely folded slates and limestones. Garnetiferous schists occur at Ruby Creek, and greenstones form the bed rock of the lower valley except near the mouth, where they are partly covered by the Kenai rocks. The alluvials of the valley are approximately thick and consist of soil mixed with much vegetal matter, peaty soil, and gravel, with much angular debris at the foot of many of the hillsides. In the middle part of the valley, they consist of about of muck and the same thickness of gravel. The muck thickens toward the sides while the bed rock remains about level.

They were descendants of Haj Ebrahim Khan Kalantar. Many sources such as British secret documents and Nasser Al Din Shah QajarOutcaste (RLE Iran D): Jewish Life in Southern Iran, Lawrence Loeb, p. 32, 2012. himself believed that the family was Jewish. The family was so powerful with wealth and political power that it was often said in Shiraz \\"Before Reza Shah, Qavams were Shah here.\\"Modern Iran Dialectics, By Michael E. Bonine Nikki R. Keddie, SUNY Press, 1981, page 293. The surname Ghavam is borrowed from honorific title Ghavam-al-saltaneh from Qajar court which means pillar or continuation of Kingdom. Ebrahim Kalantar Shiraz was the first influential member of the family. Qavam house in Shiraz built in the 19th century.  Early years  Ghavam family trace their ancestry back to Hajj Ghavam ol Din a 14th-century Vizier, and a contemporary of Hafez who is also mentioned in his poems. Local tradition always portray family as Jewish and this claim was confirmed in secret British memoirs of 1890s called Who's Who in Iran.Modern Iran Dialectics, By Michael E. Bonine Nikki R. Keddie, SUNY Press, 1981, page 292. The first member of family to reach political influence was Hajj Ebrahim Kalantar Shirazi. He was a Vizier and Kalantar of Fars in Zand government and his decision to betray Lotf Ali Khan Zand was instrumental in ending Zand dynasty and bringing Qajars to the throne. Naser al-Din Shah Qajar Qajar famously addressed him when he met with the representatives of Alliance Israelite Universelle in Paris by saying However Fath Ali Shah Qajar did not trust Hajj Ebrahim and had him executed in 1801. His fourth son, Ali Akbar Khan, was very young and ill and was spared from Shah's revenge. He later returned to Shiraz and gained influence. He became the Kalantar of Fars by Fath Ali Shah in 1812. He was later awarded the title Qavam ol Mulk (Pillar of kingdom) in 1830 which became family's last name. In 1864 he became the administrator of Imam Reza shrine at Mashhad. Hajj Ali Akbar Khan was survived by his fourth son Ali Mohammad Khan who also inherited the title Ghavam ol Mulk. In total five members of the family held that title until it was abolished by Reza Shah in the 1930s. Ebrahim Khan, Ghavam ol Mulk V was exiled by Reza Shah to Tehran. Fath Ali Khan, Saheb Divan, another son of first Ghavam went to Tehran in 1830 and married a daughter of Fath Ali Shah and became influential in government. He became governor of many provinces. Nasir ol Mulk another son Ali Akbar Khan remained in Fars and served as governor of Bushehr, Lar and Bandar Abbas.Modern Iran Dialectics, By Michael E. Bonine Nikki R. Keddie, SUNY Press, 1981, page 293. Thus there are three major branches of the Qavam family: *Ghavams, who are in Tehran and are sons and daughters of Ebrahim Ghavam *Ghavams, who are descendants of Nasir ol Mulk * Saheb Divanis, who are descendants of Saheb Divan from Shiraz The British did enjoy the loyalty of Ghavam family in Fars. Ahmad Ghavam, son of Ghavam Shiraz was an influential intermediary between the British and Reza Shah. He was often shuttled back and forth between the palace and the British embassy.The Rise and Fall of the Pahlavi Dynasty: Memoirs of Former General Hussein Fardust, Motilal Banarsidass Publ., 1997, page 144. General Hussein Fardoust wrote in his memoirs that British staff often spent weekends in Ghavam's house and they were treated like members of his family. Ghavam's emissaries were often in movement between Shiraz, Tehran and the British embassy but for important decisions Ghavam himself often came to Tehran to meet with the British. For example, in August 1941 when Reza Shah was showing pro-Nazi views, Ghavam met with Sir Reader Bullard to decide the fate of the Shah. The decision to depose Reza Shah of the throne and put his son in place was made with the influence and the approval of the Ghavam.The Rise and Fall of the Pahlavi Dynasty: Memoirs of Former General Hussein Fardust, Motilal Banarsidass Publ, 1998, page 20. Ebrahim Ghavam although exiled remained powerful and his son Ali Qavam married Princess Ashraf Pahlavi. However this marriage was forced upon Ashraf by Reza Shah in order to gain the favor of the British. When Iran was invaded by the allies, Ghavam tried to distance himself from the Pahlavi's. Their son Prince Shahram Pahlavi Nia was the grandson of both Reza Shah Pahlavi and Ebrahim Ghavam. Ali Ghavam later divorced Ashraf Pahlavi and married a sister of Asadollad Alam.Modern Iran Dialectics, By Michael E. Bonine Nikki R. Keddie, SUNY Press, 1981, page 293.

The house sits on a hill toward the northern end of Mulberry Island, overlooking the James River. It was built ca. 1725 as a one- and-a-half-story frame dwelling with brick chimneys and later underwent two major renovations. During the first renovation, in 1730, the walls were bricked in and a shed room and porch tower were added. During the second, in 1893, the house was raised to a full two stories. In 1918 the house and its surrounding land were acquired by the U.S. government for the establishment of an army post. By the late twentieth century, the Matthew Jones House had fallen into grave disrepair. In 1993 it was preserved and rehabilitated by the National Park Service in cooperation with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. Today it serves as an architectural museum. At times in the past the Matthew Jones House was also known as the \\"Brick House\\" for its construction, and the nearby creek, now known as Milstead Creek, was once called Brick House Creek. It is frequently stated in popular histories of the area and on the Matthew Jones House roadside historical marker that the plantation was once known as \\"Bourbon\\". Period I (ca. 1725) The Matthew Jones House, named after its original owner, was built around 1725 as a -story frame house with brick chimneys. The house in its earliest form was earthfast – rather than the house standing on a foundation, its main structural posts extended into the ground. The original form of the house was a two-room hall and parlor style dwelling,Graham, Willie, William J. Davis, Donald W. Linebaugh, Leslie McFaden, and Vanessa Patrick 1991 A Preservation Plan for the Matthew Jones House, Fort Eustis, Virginia.

An exterior brick kitchen was built in 1727.Graham, Willie, William J. Davis, Donald W. Linebaugh, Leslie McFaden, and Vanessa Patrick 1991 A Preservation Plan for the Matthew Jones House, Fort Eustis, Virginia. William and Mary Center for Archaeological Research, Williamsburg, Virginia. Submitted to Telemarc, Inc., Vienna, Virginia. p. 44 Period II (1730) Matthew Jones died in 1728 and left his house to his son Scervant, who was a minor at the time. Scervant's guardian, John Jones, embarked on improvements to the house which had probably been planned by Matthew before his death. The exterior walls of the house were rebuilt in brick, though several beams from the earlier framing were retained as part of the roof framing and have survived to this day.Fort Eustis Cultural Resources 2014 The Matthew Jones House. Pamphlet produced by Fort Eustis Cultural Resources, pp.11-13 The house also acquired a cellar at this time and was no longer earthfast, but rather had a brick foundation. The foundation was laid in English bond, while brickwork in the rest of the house was laid using Flemish bond. Several decorative elements are present in the brickwork: the headers of the bricks are glazed, and rubbed bricks were used around the windows and at the corners of the building. Southeast elevation of the Matthew Jones House, showing the Period II porch tower and shed room additions. Two additions were made to the house at this time: a shed room at the back of the building and a two-story porch tower at the front. The shed room provided additional sleeping or storage space, while the new tower entry provided a measure of control over who had access to the interior, private spaces of the house. In the second quarter of the eighteenth century, central passages were becoming commonly used for this purpose.Graham, Willie, William J. Davis, Donald W. Linebaugh, Leslie McFaden, and Vanessa Patrick 1991 A Preservation Plan for the Matthew Jones House, Fort Eustis, Virginia. William and Mary Center for Archaeological Research, Williamsburg, Virginia. Submitted to Telemarc, Inc., Vienna, Virginia. p. 42 The Joneses likely built the porch tower, a more old-fashioned architectural feature, rather than a central passage because there was not enough space within the existing plan of the house to insert a passage without making the size of the rooms to either side inconveniently small.Graham, Willie, William J.

American Institute of Dendrochronology, Blacksburg, Virginia. Period III (1893) The Matthew Jones House underwent extensive remodeling in 1893. At that time the exterior kitchen was demolished and its bricks used to raise the house to a full two stories. Bricks with the inscription \\"Matthew Jones 1727,\\" which had formerly been part of the kitchen, were placed on the façade at the base of the new second story. In contrast with the original brickwork, the bricks of the new addition were laid in seven-course American bond. The outline of the original roof is still visible at each end of the building, more steeply pitched than the current roof. To accommodate the new, higher roofline, the original chimneys were heightened by adding twin stacks to the top of each. The windows were replaced, and a second door was cut into the east wall of the house, which eventually led to a frame addition which was built sometime between 1893 and the 1910s. This addition was present when photographs were taken in the 1930s but has since been demolished.Graham, Willie, William J. Davis, Donald W.

The Matthew Jones House on Fort Eustis In 1918 the U.S. government purchased Mulberry Island and the surrounding land in order to establish an army post known as Camp Eustis, now Fort Eustis. The Matthew Jones House was among the properties acquired at this time. The Army used the building as post housing for several decades. After World War II, the house was abandoned and sat vacant for years. Interior view of the Matthew Jones House, showing an exposed Period I beam. In 1940, a project to measure and record the Matthew Jones House was undertaken as part of the Historic American Buildings Survey (HABS). Drawings of all four elevations and floor plans of the first and second floors and of the cellar were produced, and ten photographs of the exterior were taken. A HABS inventory form was completed in 1959.Graham, Willie, William J. Davis, Donald W.

By the late twentieth century, the house was noticeably deteriorating. Members of the Fort Eustis Historical and Archaeological Association took notice and urged the Army to take steps to preserve it. In 1993, personnel from the National Park Service's Williamsport Preservation Training Center (WPTC), using funding provided by the Norfolk office of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, undertook a project to halt the decline of the house. The primary objective of this project was the stabilization and preservation of the building, with a secondary goal of providing the opportunity for visitors to see the building techniques that were used in the past. In order to facilitate this second objective, it was decided to leave the interior of the building in a state of \\"semi-ruin,\\" with architectural elements exposed. All Period I and II elements were left intact, while Period III elements were repaired if possible or replaced, and twentieth-century features were removed. The exterior of the house was restored to its Period III appearance.Robinson, Chris 199- Matthew Jones House Preservation/Rehabilitation Project.

Ebrahim Kalantar Shirazi (), also known as Hajji Ebrahim () and E'temad al-Dawla (), was an influential Iranian politician in the Zand and Qajar era.  Biography  He was the third son of Mohammad Hashem, who was a descendant of the Hashemian family, an originally Jewish family which could trace its lineage back to Qewam al-Din Hasan, a 14th-century Iranian who served as the minister of the Muzaffarids.EBRĀHĪM KALĀNTAR ŠĪRĀZĪ, Abbas Amanat, Encyclopaedia Iranica In 1747, Ebrahim's father, Mohammad Hashem, was punished by Nader Shah, losing his one eyeball. After Nader Shah's death, Iran fell into a civil war, which the Zand Karim Khan Zand emerged victorious in. Ebrahim Khan became very influential in Zand era and became the Kalantar of Fars. His biggest influence came in the end of Zand dynasty when he decided to cooperate with Agha Mohammad Khan Qajar and hand over Shiraz to him. When Lotfali Khan came back to Shiraz, Ebrahim Khan did not let him inside and helped bring the Qajar dynasty to power. He was further instrumental in the crowning of Fath-Ali Shah Qajar and he kept his political power. However, the Shah later became wary of him and had him arrested. Thus, in 1801, he was arrested and sent to Taleghan. A month later he was blinded by the order of the Shah and his tongue was cut off and he was killed. His properties were seized for the benefit of the Shah and Mirza Mohammad Shafie Asefoldoleh replaced him. Naser al-Din Shah Qajar famously addressed Adolphe Crémieux the head of Alliance Israélite Universelle in Paris with these words: His descendants formed the Qavam family in Shiraz which remain influential. Ali Qavam, who married Reza Shah's daughter and was the first husband of Ashraf Pahlavi, was one of his descendants.

Batak cuisine is the cuisine and cooking traditions of Batak ethnic groups, predominantly found in North Sumatra region, Indonesia. Batak cuisine is part of Indonesian cuisine, and compared to other Sumatran cuisine traditions, it is more indigenously preserved. One characteristic of Batak cuisine is its preference to andaliman (Zanthoxylum acanthopodium) as the main spice. That is why andaliman in Indonesia sometimes dubbed as \\"Batak pepper\\". Batak people are majority Christian — unlike neighboring Muslim-majority ethnic groups such as Aceh and Minang — Christian Batak people are not restricted to Islamic halal dietary law. Many of the Batak's popular meals are made of pork as well as dishes made from unusual ingredients, such as dog meat or blood, however there are also halal batak dishes, mostly chicken and freshwater fishes. Batak culinary centers are located in towns of Batak highlands, such as the town of Kabanjahe and Berastagi in Tanah Karo area. While some towns around the Lake Toba offers freshwater fish dishes such as carp arsik. The North Sumatran capital of Medan is also a Batak cuisine hotspot where numerous of Lapo (Batak eating establishments) can be found, yet the city is also a culinary center of halal Malay Deli as well as Chinese Indonesian cuisines. Outside its traditional lands in North Sumatra, Batak cuisine can also be found in Lapo in Jakarta, as well as most of the Indonesian major cities. History Cooking traditions in many parts of Sumatra often demonstrates foreign culinary influences; such as Minang, Malay and Aceh cuisines featuring typical curry- like dishes heavily influenced by Indian and Arabic cuisines. Batak cuisine however, retain its indigenous Austronesian cooking traditions; such as cooking meats (especially pork) along with its blood. Similar dish can also be found in Filipino cuisine, such as dinuguan. However, since many tribes of the archipelago have converted to Islam, the non-halal dishes such as those using pork, dog meat, or blood, has been abandoned, and now only survive in non- Muslim areas, such as Batak lands. Spices and flavourings Andaliman known in Indonesia as \\"Batak pepper\\" Regional differences between Batak and Acehnese culinary influences, among others, are characterized by the choice of spices; curry leaves or andaliman. Coastal Acehnese people using curry leaves (Murraya koenigii) as the main spice, while the Batak people prefer andaliman. Regions that use andaliman as main spices starting from the Gayo highlands in Central Aceh continue to the southeast up to Berastagi in Tanah Karo in North Sumatra. The most widely used spice in Batak cuisine is andaliman and batak onion (chives), they are commonly used for all types of arsik. The most common Batak spicy sauce is called arsik — it is a Batak sauce made from the mixture of andaliman, turmeric, garlic and candlenut. There are many unique spices used in Batak cuisine recipes. Sambal Tuktuk for example use a mixture of andaliman and other spices. Other spices commonly used in Batak cuisine includes kaffir lime, Indonesian bay leaves, coriander, onion, garlic, chili pepper, pepper, lemongrass, ginger, galangal and turmeric. Meat Saksang, pork cooked in spices and its own blood Panggang, Batak style roasted pork For many centuries Batak tribes has led a relatively isolated way of life and maintained their ancestral belief systems. As the result a lot of the indigenous elements of their culture still survive, including their culinary arts. Today majority of Batak tribes are Christian, for example Batak Toba, Karo, and Pakpak. Pork and dog meats are commonly consumed. Dog meat is usually called B1, derived from biang, Batak word to refer a dog, while pork is often called B2 from babi. Pork (B2) or dog meat (B1) are usually cooked in its own blood, spiced and seasoned as saksang, or grilled as panggang. However, there is also Muslim Batak tribes, such as Mandailing Batak tribe. They apply Islamic dietary law which only allows halal food and forbid consumption of pork, dog meat, and blood. Popular Batak pork dish are saksang, fried cutlets sauteed pork in thick spicy blood sauces and Babi Panggang Karo (karo roast pork) — often shortened to BPK — which is locals' favourite and has become nationally famous through Lapo Batak restaurants nationwide. BPK consists of roasted pork slices with three accompaniments: a bowl of broth made from the essence of boiled pig's bones, a platter of porcine blood cooked with pepper and chili, and a saucer of extra-hot chili sauce. Another common meat consumed in the Batak cuisine is buffalo meat, beef and chicken. Manuk Napinadar is a grilled chicken smothered in chicken blood itself, spiced with andaliman and garlic powder. Ayam Tasak Telu is one of popular chicken dish in Batak cuisine. Tasak telu literally means “cooking three times,” and consists of three dishes: the first part is boiled chicken< the second part is a sauce made of finely-ground corn kernels, spices and the remaining stock from the boiled chicken, the third part is an assortment of chopped vegetables and spicy coconut. Fish Carp Arsik, Batak style spicy fish Since the Batak tribes live in the interior of North Sumatra, freshwater fish that live in rivers or Lake Toba is commonly consumed by locals. Carp usually cooked as Arsik or Dengke Mas na Niura, the fish is not cooked, but just seasoned and flavored in heavy spices. In addition to carp, catfish and tilapia are also consumed, usually cooked as Na Tinombur. Exotic dishes Batak dishes sometimes use unusual meats such as dog meat (B1 or \\"biang\\" ) cooked as saksang or roasted as panggang. One unusual notorious dish is Pagitpagit that has distinctly pungent aroma. The ingredients include a brew of cassava leaves, santan (coconut milk), rimbang (a bitter but non-toxic variety of the nightshade family), flowers of some locally-available plants and some arsik sauce, pork or beef meat, mixed with additional unusual substance — juice from a cow's cud, food that has been digested and regurgitated. Another exotic and rare ingredients is kidu. It is the Karo word for white, plump grubs or insect larvae found in sugar palm trees. The kidu-kidu sausages are named as such because they look similar to the grubs. The grubs are lightly fried to make the outer skin crispy while keeping the inner part juicy, and then briefly cooked in a boiling arsik sauce. Beverages For the Batak community, tuak (palm liquor) is not just for drinking binges. The beverage is mandatory at celebrations, and drinking tuak has become something of a tradition. It is a popular traditional alcoholic beverage made from palm wine. It is made by fermenting the enau sap. Batak Lapo Tuak is a drinking establishment dedicated to serve this traditional alcoholic beverage. North Sumatra is also known as coffee production area in Indonesia.

Prior to these posts, he was a history professor educated at the University of Toronto and the University of Chicago. In his role as dean, he was known as a sharp critic of the University of Wisconsin Experimental College program.  Early life and career  George Clarke Sellery was born January 21, 1872 in Kincardine, Ontario. He graduated from the University of Toronto in 1897, and earned a Ph.D. in history from the University of Chicago in 1901.  Madison  Sellery became a history instructor at the University of Wisconsin in 1901, and was later named a professor in 1909. Sellery directed the UW summer session from 1906 to 1911, and as dean of the University of Wisconsin–Madison College of Letters and Science from 1919 to 1942, when he retired. His salary as dean was $7,500. Even as dean, he continued to give his history courses, which were popular. He was known as a \\"team player\\", for his dedication, and he strongly defended faculty interests. Sellery publicly denounced Alexander Meiklejohn and UW President Glenn Frank's Experimental College, which he saw as demeaning the faculty and their institution. This created a rift between Sellery and Meiklejohn–Frank. Animosity between Sellery and Frank was longstanding. Sellery was rumored to be in line for the UW presidency before Frank's arrival. Near the beginning of his term, Frank had a private investigator make files on Wisconsin key political and educational figures including Sellery. Frank showed these files to Sellery, who noted that his own file wasn't \\"complimentary\\". Frank attempted to fire Sellery in the first quarter of 1929, which backfired due to faculty alliance with the dean. When the Board of Regents removed Glenn Frank in January 1937, Sellery served as acting university president for six months. Sellery died on his ninetieth birthday: January 21, 1962.

This intrinsic type of control means that the blood vessels can automatically adjust their own vascular tone, by dilating (widening) or constricting (narrowing), in response to some change in the environment. This change occurs in order to match up the tissue's oxygen demand with the actual oxygen supply available in the blood as closely as possible. For example, if a muscle is actively being utilized it will require more oxygen than if it was at rest, so the blood vessels supplying that muscle will vasodilate, or widen in size, to increase the amount of blood, and therefore oxygen, being delivered to that muscle. There are several mechanisms by which vascular tone, and therefore blood flow, is controlled. The sympathetic nervous system and a variety of hormones, for instance, both exert some degree of control over vascular tone. However, the local intrinsic regulatory system described here is completely independent of these other mechanisms. Many organs or organ systems have their own unique mechanism of local blood flow regulation, as explained below.  Individual Mechanisms  There are two major means of local regulation of blood flow, which are described below. # Metabolic control, which consists of metabolites and paracrine agents released from surrounding tissue that act on the blood vessel(s). For example, as tissue metabolism increases, driving up oxygen demand, the amount of available oxygen decreases, driving down the pH and triggering a release in adenosine, which triggers the blood vessel to vasodilate. # Myogenic control, which originates from the wall of the blood vessel itself and consists of both muscle reflexes and products released from endothelial cells that line the vessel. These endothelial products include nitric oxide and endothelin-1 that are released in response to either chemical stimuli, like histamine, or increased shear stress on the blood vessel (meaning the amount of stress exerted by blood on the blood vessel walls). While nitric oxide causes vasodilation, endothelin-1 causes vasoconstriction.  Examples of local blood flow regulation  Below are several examples of differing types of local blood flow regulation by specific organ type or organ system. In each case, there is a specific type of intrinsic regulation occurring in order to maintain or alter blood flow to that given organ alone, instead of creating a systemic change that would affect the entire body. * Cerebral (brain) circulation is highly sensitive to changes in pCO2, meaning the amount of dissolved carbon dioxide (CO2) present in the blood vessel, as well as the hydrogen ion concentration. Both of these factors affect pH and, in turn, the balance between vasodilation versus vasoconstriction in the brain. So, the blood vessels found specifically in the brain respond changes in dissolved carbon dioxide levels. * Coronary (heart) circulation is controlled at the local level primarily by metabolic control mechanism. More specifically it is regulated by adenosine, a local vasodilator produced by neighboring cells. Therefore the heart is influenced by a form of metabolic control through the effects of paracrine signaling. * Renal (kidney) circulation is primarily controlled by Tubuloglomerular Feedback, which is a system of organ-specific autoregulation that directly affects renal blood flow. * Pulmonary (lung) circulation undergoes hypoxic vasoconstriction, which is a unique mechanism of local regulation in that the blood vessels in this organ react to hypoxemia, or low levels of dissolved oxygen in blood, in the opposite way as the rest of the body. While tissues and organs tend to increase blood flow by vasodilating in response to low oxygen supply, the blood vessels in the lungs actually vasoconstrict to decrease blood flow in response to low oxygen. * Splanchnic circulation, which supplies blood to several gastrointestinal organs (liver, gallbladder, pancreas, intestines) and the spleen, is influenced by gastrointestinal hormones and metabolites, such as vasodilatory kinins, released from the cells lining the intestines, bile acids from the gallbladder, and by products of digestion. This is an example of control at the organ system level as this group of organs all receive blood flow from one central source, the splanchnic artery. * Skeletal muscle is influenced by multiple factors. First, metabolites that are produced by active muscle use can alter skeletal muscle tone. Second, skeletal muscle can undergo hyperemia, which is a mechanism of local blood flow regulation with two major subtypes. Regardless of the subtype, the result of hyperemia is an increase in blood flow to the affected skeletal muscle. ** Active hyperemia is one subtype, which occurs in response to increased metabolic demand, meaning high oxygen requirements within the tissue. It follows the principal of metabolic control, with the release of vasodilatory substances in response to increased oxygen demand. This is classically seen in skeletal muscle in activities like running where muscles are activity being utilized and thus have increased oxygen demand. ** Reactive hyperemia is the second subtype, which occurs after a short interruption, or arrest, in blood flow. In response to the blood flow interruption, a temporary compensatory vasodilation occurs as soon as blood flow has resumed, before returning to normal. This response occurs because vasodilatory substances, like adenosine, are released i response to the blood flow interruption, meaning that when blood flow resumes it occurs in a wider blood vessel and thus at an increased flow rate. This is classically seen in weight lifting, as skeletal muscle can become occluded momentarily during this activity, thus suspending blood flow.

It is headquartered at the Walter Cronkite School of Journalism and Mass Communication at Arizona State University.  History  The center was founded in 1998 as the Disability Media Project to raise awareness of how people with disabilities are undercovered in the news. Freelance photographer Suzanne Levine established the Disability Media Project in San Francisco to serve as a bridge between the media and disability communities. An advisory board of journalists, educators and disability activists helped develop resources for working journalists and for schools of journalism and mass communication to integrate coverage of people with disabilities into their curriculum. In 2000, the organization's name was changed to the National Center on Disability and Journalism to reflect its journalistic mission as opposed to advocacy. The center was housed in the humanities building at San Francisco State University and for a short time in an office on Market Street in San Francisco. After moving to Boston in 2004, the NCDJ pursued an affiliation with a university journalism program. In 2008, the center was moved to the Walter Cronkite School of Journalism and Mass Communication at Arizona State University in downtown Phoenix. It is directed by Associate Dean Kristin Gilger and staffed by a graduate assistant and several volunteers.  Focus  The focus of the NCDJ is to provide support, resources and guidance to reporters who cover disabilities as a beat as well as those who occasionally report on people with disabilities. Although at least 19 percent of the U.S. population have some kind of disability as defined under the Americans with Disabilities Act, they are underrepresented in the mainstream media and that coverage is often inaccurate or incomplete. On the center's website, there is a newsfeed of the latest stories covering disability issues as well as various resources including an oft-cited disability style guide explaining appropriate language and terms when describing disabilities and an interview tip sheet with best practices for reporters.

It is known nearly everywhere in Turkey as “Vakfıkebir” or “Trabzon” bread. In addition to Trabson, it is especially produced in small towns along major highways. It is baked in a wood-fired stone oven, and is leavened with natural sourdough. Vakfıkebir bread is flavorful, has a long shelf life, and does not mold easily. When it goes stale it is still good. During recent years, companies producing Vakfıkebir bread have opened in large cities such as Istanbul and Ankara. As it's cooked in stone ovens, it is also known as “Stone oven” (Taşfırın) bread. In some areas it is mistakenly called “wood bread” (odun ekmeği); what is meant is that the oven is wood-fired.

He designed several buildings in Brighton and was an important figure in the town's public affairs in the early Victorian era. Biography=Early life Norfolk Hotel Central United Reformed Church, Hove Horatio Nelson Goulty was born in 1832 or 1833 in Brighton, East Sussex. His father was Reverend John Nelson Goulty, the pastor of Union Chapel and a cousin of Horatio Nelson, 1st Viscount Nelson (1758–1805). As a result, Lord Nelson was his uncle. Goulty was married and had two children. Career In 1850, Goulty and his father were two of the four founders of the Extra Mural Cemetery in Brighton. The others were architect Amon Henry Wilds and doctor and politician John Cordy Burrows. Although Wilds has been credited in some sources with the design of the two cemetery chapels (only one of which survives), Goulty's obituary in the Freemasons' Magazine and Masonic Mirror attributes the buildings to him. Goulty's influence in Brighton's public life increased when he became councillor for Park ward, one of six wards created in 1854 to govern the newly created Municipal Borough of Brighton. Named after Queen's Park, this electoral division covered the east of the town. He supported the town's Children's Hospital, which was founded by local doctor R.P.B. Taaffe at 178 Western Road on 3 August 1868 with the name Brighton Hospital for Sick Children. It now occupies a different site and is known as the Royal Alexandra Hospital. He also served as a secretary of the Local School of Art in Brighton, a Sunday Schools inspector and a deacon at a Nonconformist chapel. Goulty was responsible for two new Congregational churches in East Sussex during the 1860s. Cliftonville Congregational Church, a congregation based in central Hove, used his Sunday School building (erected in 1861) for worship until his grey stone Early English Gothic Revival-style church building was finished. The church is still in active use under the name Central United Reformed Church. In 1866, he used a different architectural style—plain Neoclassical—for his design of the Newhaven Congregational Chapel at Newhaven, which replaced a building of 1797. The stucco-faced stone building served as a church until 1938, after which it fell into dereliction and later became an antiques market. In 1864, he designed the Norfolk Hotel, located at 149 Kings Road in Brighton. The French Renaissance Revival-style building is Grade II-listed and remains in use as a luxury hotel. The author of Moorecroft's Guide (1866), a guidebook about the resort, called it \\"more beautiful than any other building in Brighton\\". He later designed the Grand Concert Hall which opened in 1866 on the southeast side of West Street, near the seafront, but was in use for only 16 years because it was destroyed by fire in 1882. He also reconstructed the Hanningtons department store on North Street, also in Brighton, and school buildings in Hurstpierpoint, and was commissioned by several early building societies for architectural and surveying work. Between 1867 and 1868, he designed the Brighton Hammam, a Turkish bath for the newly formed Brighton Turkish Baths Company Ltd. In addition to Goulty, the Company Secretary and all six of the original directors were Freemasons. The Hammam, built by Goulty and Gibbins, was located at 57–59 West Street and cost £14,000. One commentator described the exterior as \\"rising like some Moorish temple, resplendent with crimson and gilt\\". After closure in 1910, the building was converted into the Academy Cinema and was demolished in 1973. He became a Freemason in December 1863. He was also a member of the Order of the Knights Templar. Death He died on 7 July 1869 in Shoreham-by-Sea, West Sussex, England. His funeral was held 12 days later at the Extra Mural Cemetery, where between 800 and 1,000 mourners were in attendance.

Child assessed that this \\"apocryphal\\" ballad seemed like a recent fabrication from a pastiche of other ballads. Synopsis Lady Maisry had many suitors to choose from. It was Thomas of Yonderdale who \\"gaind the love o this ladie,\\" but once deprived of her virginity Thomas ceased coming near her bower. One day he passes by and overhears her speaking to the young son she bore by him, reproaching the father's neglect. Thomas is moved to tears, and declares he is come to \\"comfort\\" her. She reminds him of his earlier empty promise of marriage, and Thomas avows he will make good on the promise and marry her when he returns from voyage overseas. Despite her wish for a storm, it is fine weather on Saturday, and he sails off to his destination (England, according to Buchan) where he tarries three months and seduces another maiden. Then Lady Maisry appears in a dream upbraiding his infidelity. He summons his errand boy at night to carry a letter to Lady Maisry. The boy promises to do so even if his legs gave out and he had to crawl in the dark. Thomas instructs that Lady Maisry be dressed in a silk gown and cramasie (crimson cloth) coat, and be given a horse to ride with bells on the tips of its mane, and fine trappings. She thus arrives, and appears as magnificent as the Scottish queen in the eyes of Thomas's would-be-bride (an Englishwoman, according to Buchan). Thomas's boy then explains that the guest is no queen but Thomas's first love, at which the pretender bride despairs that he will never choose herself over this rival, and indeed, when Lady Maisry confronts Thomas about what his intent was, Thomas declares his will to marry Lady Maisry. The jilted bride then asks what is in store for her, and is only offered a ride home in a fine coach. She negotiates to have Thomas cede two-thirds of his land to his brother, and arrange to have her marry the brother. But Thomas refuses to part with his land, and says he has no power to choose a bride for his brother. Parallels Svend Grundtvig felt that this Scottish ballad, despite its suspicious and derivative nature, was probably based on an earlier form analogous to the Scandinavian ballad group represented by Danish Slegfred og Brud \\"Mistress and Bride\\" (DgF 255). Other cognates in this group are the Icelandic Elja kvæði (ÍF 48), Faroese Brúnsveins vísa (CCF 119), and the Norwegian Bendik og Videmø.. Francis J. Child makes hint of this parallel in passing, under the chapter for another Scottish ballad, No. 62 Fair Annie. It may be noted that the Scandinavian ballad group is categorized TSB D 259: \\"Bride gives up bride-groom so that he may marry mistress\\". This is not what happens in \\"Thomas of Yonderdale,\\" though it is what happens in Fair Annie and the Danish Skjøn Anna where the would-be-bride recognizes the mistress Annie/Anna as her long lost sister abducted abroad. Modern scholars however conclude that the Scandinavian ballad of Anna is of later composition, derived from a German original (Die schöne Hannale), and do not assign a TSB number to the Skjøn Anna group.

Despite not meeting Charles I face-to-face, Bernini's bust was considered a success at the time, and the English king rewarded Bernini with jewellery worth over 4,000 Roman scudi (a figure over 60 times the average yearly salary of a worker in Rome).Mormando, p131 Pope Urban VIII sent the bust to Charles's queen Henrietta Maria in 1638 in the hope of encouraging a reconciliation of the Roman Catholic Church with the Church of England. The bust was presented in 1637 and admired for its workmanship and likeness to the king. Charles rewarded Bernini with a valuable diamond ring. Queen Henrietta Maria commissioned Bernini to make a companion bust of her, but the English Civil War intervened and it was never made.

It is one of the youngest pre-historic sites in Michigan, dating to the terminal Late Woodland Period just prior to European contact. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1972. History The village that once stood at this location was likely inhabited in the early part of the 17th century (about 1605–1620, according to Quimby). The people occupying the village are thought to be the precursors of the modern Potawatomi people. It is likely that they were uprooted from this location soon after Samuel de Champlain's 1615 visit to the region, as warring tribes spilled into Michigan. Were they the Potawatomi people, they eventually made their way by the 1640s to the region around Sault Ste. Marie. Meanwhile, white pine grew up in the plain where the village stood. The pine was lumbered in 1870-1880, after which the land was gradually converted to agricultural use, and was farmed as late as 1930. In the 1940s, oil was discovered in the area, and wells were installed. The Dumaw Creek site was originally discovered in 1915 by a farmer, Christoph \\"Carl\\" Schrumpf 1854–1949, who was pulling a stump from his field. Schrumpf discovered 18 skeletons and various artifacts in 1915–16. These artifacts were catalogued by the Museum of Anthropology at the University of Michigan in 1924, but the artifacts and records were not generally well known by archaeologists. Schrumpf eventually sold the collection to a private dealer, and they eventually made their way, sans any identifying data, to George I. Quimby at the Field Museum in 1959. Quimby eventually tracked the source of the artifacts to the Dumaw Creek site, and in 1960-62 did some summer surface collection there. He also located other artifacts already dug from the site. Description The Dumaw Creek site is located on a sandy plain near Dumaw Creek, a tributary of the Pentwater River, at a site not easily accessible by canoe. The creek itself runs through a small valley about beneath the level of the plain. The site, covering , was used as a village and burial ground. The village is thought to have been a semi-permanent settlement with dome-shaped wigwams. The people hunted and fished, and grew corn and pumpkins. Artifacts Artifacts and features found at the site include burials, faunal remains, stone tools, bone tools, red ocher/mineral paint (used for ceremonial coloring), copper artifacts, shell artifacts, tobacco pipes, animal skins, and vegetal and textile remains. At least nineteen, and perhaps as many as 55 skeletons were removed from burial sites in the Dumaw Creek site. The bodies were wrapped in furs and buried with stone implements and copper beads. The stone implements found include arrowheads, knives, and scraping tools of chipped flint and axes of a hard, granular stone. Quimby reports that 99% of the stone tools were small triangular points or arrowheads, aka Madison points, indicative of a Late Woodland period placement. There were also a considerable number of copper artifacts found at the site. Many were large bead-like tubes of copper known as hair pipes, which were worn as hair ornaments. There were also other, generally smaller copper beads, conical decorations, and copper plaques, as well as shell beads and pendants. Carved stone pipe bowls were also found, as well as animal skins and pottery. The pottery is described by Quimby as grit- tempered vessels with round-bottomed, globular forms with broad orifices and slightly flaring rims. The rim edges are often scalloped or crimped. The vessel pictured below with a scalloped rim has been compared to the Moccasin Bluff Scalloped type from the Moccasin Bluff site on the St. Joseph River in southwestern Michigan. This pottery type is diagnostic of a Late Woodland period temporal placement, just before European contact.. There was also a shell pendant with a \\"weeping eye\\" design as shown below.

Early life Ryan was born at Killeen station, Longwood, Victoria, second son of Charles Ryan, an Irish overlander from New South Wales who founded the stock and station firm of Ryan & Hammond, and his wife Marian, daughter of John Cotton, a British poet, ornithological writer and artist, who became an early pastoral settler in Victoria, Australia. Ryan was educated at the Melbourne Church of England Grammar School, and subsequently at the University of Melbourne, as a student of medicine; afterwards he proceeded to Edinburgh, where he graduated in medicine and surgery, and took the degrees of Bachelor of Medicine and Master of Surgery. He then travelled on the Continent and studied medicine in France, Austria, and Italy. In Turkey In September 1876 Ryan entered the Turkish service, and was forthwith sent to Nisch, where he was placed in charge of a large hospital during the Serbian war. He was afterwards sent to the Orchanie Balkans in charge of 3000 Turkish soldiers, and from there was ordered to march to Widdin, although still suffering from a severe attack of dysentery. He reached that place in ten days, having nearly died from exhaustion on the road. While in Widdin he was present during nine bombardments. From Widdin he proceeded with Osman Pacha to Plevna, which he gained after marching for three successive days and nights, and was present at the first battle of that memorable conflict, being the only doctor on the field. He was in the Turkish ranks at the great action of 31 July. On 8 September his horse was shot under him, and his attendant killed by his side, while riding into one of the Turkish redoubts, which was about to be attacked by Russian general Michael Skobeleff. At the battle of Gravitza he entered one of the redoubts captured by the Turks from the Russians, and on the Turks, in their turn, being expelled from this redoubt, Dr. Ryan was the last to leave it, which he did leading his horse, on which he had placed two Turkish soldiers whose legs were broken. In this plight he returned to Plevna, a distance of six miles, for the first two miles of which he was exposed to a very heavy fire. He next accompanied the expedition to Loftcha. On 18 October Ryan left Plevna for Constantinople, and was sent to Erzeroum as head of an ambulance. Here he remained four months in charge of a hospital. During this period the city was besieged by the Russians for six weeks, and for four weeks Dr. Ryan was suffering from a severe attack of typhus, which disease carried off twenty-two out of thirty-six surgeons in Erzeroum, more than sixteen thousand Turkish soldiers dying from it and from dysentery. For his services during the war he received the Order of the Medjidie of the fourth class, the Order of Osmanieh of the third class, and the war medal. During his month and a half at Gallipoli, Ryan photographed various locations on the Peninsula, as well as key Australian military personnel. Appointments As a colonel, Ryan was appointed principal medical officer, Victoria, in 1902; and honorary physician to the governor-general in 1904. At the outbreak of the First World War in 1914, Ryan became assistant director of medical services, 1st Division, Australian Imperial Force. He sailed for Egypt in October and was appointed to the staff of Lieutenant General Sir William Birdwood. On landing at Gallipoli he faced an enemy whose country he had served nearly forty years before. Ryan contracted Typhoid fever in June 1915 and was evacuated to Egypt and later to England. From July 1916 he served in London as consulting surgeon, medical headquarters staff, AIF, and achieved a reputation for his toughness on medical boards. Ryan was appointed honorary surgeon-general, Australian Military Forces, in August 1917 and returned to Australia in May 1919. In July 1919 he was placed on the retired list with the honorary rank of major general. Ryan had received the Companion of the Order of the Bath in 1916, Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George and Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire in 1919. Personal life Ryan married on 5 July 1883, Alice Elfrida, daughter of the Hon. Theodotus Sumner, M.L.C., of Stony Park, Brunswick, Victoria. They had a son, Rupert Ryan who became a soldier and Federal politician; and a daughter, Ethel Marian Sumner Ryan, a pioneer aviator and poet who married Richard Casey, Baron Casey. Ryan died at sea, on board the Otranto, near Adelaide, while on a return voyage from Europe on 23 October 1926.

Long-period tidal constituents with relatively strong forcing include the lunar fortnightly (Mf) and lunar monthly (Ms) as well as the solar semiannual (Ssa) and solar annual (Sa) constituents. An analysis of the changing distance of the Earth relative to Sun, Moon, and Jupiter by Pierre-Simon de Laplace in the 18th century showed that the periods at which gravity varies cluster into three species: the semi-diurnal and the diurnal tide constituents, which have periods of a day or less, and the long-period tidal constituents. In addition to having periods longer than a day, long-period tidal forcing is distinguished from that of the first and second species by being zonally symmetric. The long period tides are also distinguished by the way in which the oceans respond: forcings occur sufficiently slowly that they do not excite surface gravity waves. The excitation of surface gravity waves is responsible for the high amplitude semi-diurnal tides in the Bay of Fundy, for example. In contrast, the ocean responds to long period tidal forcing with a combination of an equilibrium tide along with a possible excitation of barotropic Rossby wave normal modes alt=Three graphs. The first shows the twice-daily rising and falling tide pattern with nearly regular high and low elevations. The second shows the much more variable high and low tides that form a \\"mixed tide\\". The third shows the day-long period of a diurnal tide. Formation mechanism Gravitational Tides are caused by changes in the relative location of the Earth, sun, and moon, whose orbits are perturbed slightly by Jupiter. Newton's law of universal gravitation states that the gravitational force between a mass at a reference point on the surface of the Earth and another object such as the Moon is inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them. The declination of the Moon relative to the Earth means that as the Moon orbits the Earth during half the lunar cycle the Moon is closer to the Northern Hemisphere and during the other half the Moon is closer to the Southern Hemisphere. This periodic shift in distance gives rise to the lunar fortnightly tidal constituent. The ellipticity of the lunar orbit gives rise to a lunar monthly tidal constituent. Because of the nonlinear dependence of the force on distance additional tidal constituents exist with frequencies which are the sum and differences of these fundamental frequencies. Additional fundamental frequencies are introduced by the motion of the Sun and Jupiter, thus tidal constituents exist at all of these frequencies as well as all of the sums and differences of these frequencies, etc. The mathematical description of the tidal forces is greatly simplified by expressing the forces in terms of gravitational potentials. Because of the fact that the Earth is approximately a sphere and the orbits are approximately circular it also turns out to be very convenient to describe these gravitational potentials in spherical coordinates using spherical harmonic expansions. Oceanic response Several factors need to be considered in determine the ocean's response to tidal forcing. These include loading effects and interactions with the solid Earth as the ocean mass is redistributed by the tides, and self- gravitation effects of the ocean on itself. However the most important is the dynamical response of the ocean to the tidal forcing, conveniently expressed in terms of Laplace's tidal equations. Because of their long periods surface gravity waves cannot be easily excited and so the long period tides were long assumed to be nearly in equilibrium with the forcing in which case the tide heights should be proportional to the disturbing potential and the induced currents should be very weak. Thus it came as a surprise when in 1967 Carl Wunsch published the tide heights for two constituents in the tropical Pacific with distinctly nonequilibrium tides. More recently there has been confirmation from satellite sea level measurements of the nonequilibrium nature of the lunar fortnightly tide (GARY D. EGBERT and RICHARD D. RAY, 2003: Deviation of Long-Period Tides from Equilibrium: Kinematics and Geostrophy, J. Phys. Oceanogr., 33, 822-839), for example in the tropical Atlantic. Similar calculations for the lunar monthly tide show that this lower frequency constituent is closer to equilibrium than the fortnightly. A number of ideas have been put forward regarding how the ocean should respond to long period tidal forcing. Several authors in the 1960s and 1970s had suggested that the tidal forcing might generate resonant barotropic Rossby Wave modes, however these modes are extremely sensitive to ocean dissipation and in any event are only weakly excited by the long period tidal forcing (Carton,J.A.,1983: The variation with frequency of the long-period tides. J. Geophys. Res.,88,7563–7571). Another idea was that long period Kelvin Waves could be excited. More recently Egbert and Ray present numerical modeling results suggesting that the nonequilibrium tidal elevation of the lunar fortnightly is more closely connected to the exchange of mass between the ocean basins. Effect on lunar orbit  The effect of long-period tides on lunar orbit is a controversial topic, some literatures conclude the long-period tides accelerate the moon and slow down the earth. However Cheng found that dissipation of the long-period tides brakes the moon and actually accelerates the earth's rotation. To explain this, they assumed the earth's rotation depends not directly on the derivation of the forcing potential for the long period tides, so the form and period of the long-period constituents is independent of the rotation rate. For these constituents, the moon (or sun) can be thought of as orbiting a non-rotating earth in a plane with the appropriate inclination to the equator. Then the tidal \\"bulge\\" lags behind the orbiting moon thus decelerating it in its orbit (bringing it closer to the earth), and by angular momentum conservation, the earth's rotation must accelerate. But this argument is qualitative, and a quantitative resolution of the conflicting conclusions is still needed. Pole tide One additional tidal constituent results from the centrifugal forces due, in turn, to the so- called polar motion of the Earth. The latter has nothing to do with the gravitational torques acting on the Earth by the Sun and Moon, but is \\"excited\\" by geophysical mass transports on or in the Earth itself given the (slight) oblateness of the Earth's shape, which actually gives rise to an Euler-type rotational motion with a period of about 433 days for the Earth known as the Chandler wobble (after its first discoverer Seth Chandler in the late 1900s). Incidentally the Eulerian wobble is analogous to the wobbling motion of a spinning frisbee thrown not-so-perfectly. Observationally, the (excited) Chandler wobble is a major component in the Earth's polar motion. One effect of the polar motion is to perturb the otherwise steady centrifugal force felt by the Earth, causing the Earth (and the oceans) to deform slightly at the corresponding periods, knowns as the pole tide. Like the long period tides the pole tide has been assumed to be in equilibrium and an examination of the pole tide at ocean-basin scales seems to be consistent with that assumption. The equilibrium amplitude of the pole tide is about 0.5 cm at it maximum at 45 degrees N. and S. latitudes. At regional scales, though, the observational record is less clear. For example, tide gauge records in the North Sea show a signal that seemed to be non-equilibrium pole tide which Wunsch has suggested is due to a resonance connected with the excitation of barotropic Rossby waves, but O'Connor and colleagues suggest it is actually wind-forced instead. Usage The long-period tides are very useful for geophysicists, who use them to calculate the elastic Love number and to understand low frequency and large-scale oceanic motions.

Keyes's \\"Made- in-Detroit\\" Home, 1936 Personal Keyes was married to Faye Elizabeth Keyes, and had two daughters and two sons.

Howard CraneAmerican Architects Directory. R.R. Bowker (American Institute of Architects). First edition, 1956. and was an associate of Albert Kahn (\\"the foremost industrial architect of the United States\\")—where he worked on Kahn's \\"signature project\\" the Neo-Renaissance Detroit Athletic Club. Keyes also graduated from the U.S. Naval Academy and served as an ensign in the Navy during World War I and as a major in the Army during World War II. He travelled extensively in England, France, Italy, and Switzerland, all of which influenced the development of his architectural style. Keyes opened his own office in Detroit in 1921, and his career spanned the roaring twenties, the Great Depression, and into the post war boom mid-century modern period. Keyes's style ranged from Tudor Revival (the most ubiquitous style in the early 20th-century metropolitan area) to rustic Swiss chalets, but he is most noted for the Georgian/Palladian and symmetrical bow-fronted wings, wrought iron balconies, and hipped roofs (often with parapets or mansards) of the related Regency style of architecture. A 1930s model of a proposed residence by Keyes, showing the first floor entrance and hall and second floor hall and living room Keyes's houses were known for being \\"built for the ages\\" (typically of \\"concrete and steel construction\\") and devoid of frills or affectation, his \\"free use of classical forms\\" done \\"without trickery or ostentation.\\" He was particularly influential in the Art Deco movement for which Detroit would become renowned, and was at the forefront in the area in introducing the streamline moderne designs of the movement in the 1930s. Keyes's designs often included glass-walled conservatories, exploiting natural light from hillsides or lakesides. He was one of the Detroit architects that frequently employed architectural sculptor Corrado Parducci to embellish his designs.Kvaran & Lockey, A Field Guide to Architectural Sculpture in America, unpublished manuscript By the end of his life, Keyes's works were considered some of the most significant in the area. One of his most notable works, the Bugas House (or Woodland, see below), was featured by the Detroit Free Press in 1966 as \\"Wonder number one\\" of its \\"Wonders of Bloomfield Hills\\"—along with Frank Lloyd Wright's Gregor S. Affleck House and George Booth's Cranbrook. Several of Keyes's designs (specifically the Bugas/Taubman, Knudsen/Hermelin, and Harris houses) have made lists of the most expensive homes in Michigan. Keyes played an active role in the creation of the Cranbrook Institute of Science in 1933 (in the vicinity of which he would create many residences), and was one of its original honorary members. Commenting on the technological and aesthetic trend in modern architecture, Keyes observed: Principal works At the end of his career, Keyes identified his \\"principal works\\" as the John Bugas residence (Woodland), the Louis Goad residence, the Max Fisher residence, and the Benson Ford residence (Woodley Green).American Architects Directory. R.R. Bowker (American Institute of Architects). Second edition, 1962. Also considered significant among his works are the Robert Scherer residence, the Robert Hudson Tannahill residence, the Semon Knudsen residence, the Charles Welch residence, and the Lloyd Buhs residence.

Yale University School of Forestry and Environmental Studies. 1978. is one of the last and the most published of Keyes's houses. The Regency manor house features French (Second Empire) elements such as a copper hipped and mansard roofline and Keyes's signature symmetrical bow- fronted wings and wrought iron balconies. Pedimented gables and extending portico-connected wings also evoke the Palladian style, while the house's elegant mansard, white painted brick construction, leaded oval glass front windows and soaring central window interrupting the roofline are distinctive markers of the more French-influenced Regency Moderne style (or Hollywood Regency style). The south side of the house features Keyes's natural light- filled garden room (conservatory), open living room, and library. It sits on a wooded knoll overlooking the country estate's expansive ornamental gardens and orchards and adjacent Eliel Saarinen-designed Cranbrook Kingswood (called by The New York Times \\"one of the greatest campuses ever created anywhere in the world\\"). A list of renowned designers have contributed to Woodland's \\"pedigreed architecture\\": Eliel's son Eero Saarinen was at the time renovating his own Victorian house nearby on Vaughan Road and worked informally with Keyes; French designer Andrée Putman—\\"the doyenne of contemporary French design\\" who created hotels and homes (though \\"Putman rarely accept[ed] commissions for private residences except for very close friends, such as Karl Lagerfeld [and the Taubmans]\\") in Paris, New York, Brussels, and Monte Carlo (as well as designed the Air France Concorde interior)—designed seven of Woodland's bathrooms and added an enormous spa with antique Italian glass mosaic tiles and a domed ceiling with a \\"luminous cornice\\" (\\"Putman's baths are legendary,\\" according to Architectural Digest, what she called \\"the core of a home\\"); and William Hodgins, \\"one of the deans of American interior decoration,\\" later made additional and notable Regency interior modifications.

Taubman, whose extensive renovations were featured in Vogue magazine (Woodland is also known as the Taubman House); and (hedge fund manager) Mark W. Spitznagel, its present owner. Goad House Goad House Lone Pine Rd., Bloomfield Hills (1955) Client: Louis Clifford Goad Style: Regency, Georgian As the center of industrial wealth in the region shifted from Grosse Pointe to Bloomfield Hills, so too did Keyes's projects. Keyes had already been working in Bloomfield Hills (starting in the 1930s—see Welch and Lake Park House below) when Louis Clifford Goad (Executive Vice President of General Motors Company) hired him to design his estate there. Goad House was featured in Fortune magazine in 1955 (alongside projects of Philip Johnson, Edward Durell Stone, and David Adler) as an example of the first resurgence of Americans \\"building big expensive houses again\\" since the Great Depression (with reference to Keyes designing several at the time). Goad House is privately nestled off of evergreen-lined Lone Pine Road, within view of historic Christ Church and down the road from Albert Kahn's Cranbrook House. The twelve-room house incorporates Keyes's signature symmetrical bow- fronted wings, clean white brick façade and wrought iron railings, and includes contrasting French shutters and a Palladian, Ionic colonnaded and pedimented front portico with spiral volutes. Fortune said that \\"Mrs. Goad's desire for southern-style pillars and white-painted brick was gratified by architect Hugh Keyes. As in many other big houses, the formal living room and dining room are seldom used; the family lives in the library or on the porch (conservatory), usually eats in the breakfast room. The house has an ultra- mechanized kitchen installed by G.M.\\" The integrated conservatory overlooks the south sloping grounds, with an unusual oval, stone, and \\"terraced garden and wooded section which lead to a stream,\\" a tributary of the River Rouge. The exterior of the house was a filming location in the 2013 film The Ides of March, as the senator's mansion. (Keyes's McLouth House, a block away, was used as the formal interior of the house in the film.)Complete list of filming locations for George Clooney’s ‘Ides of March’. OLV. Retrieved April 20, 2015. Goad died in the house in 1979. Fisher House Fisher House Fairway Hills Dr., Franklin (1955) Client: Max M. Fisher Style: Regency, Georgian Fisher House is \\"a white-brick Georgian with a sprawling garden that borders the eighth fairway of the Franklin Hills Country Club.\\" The gracious and understated mansion is a fraternal twin to Keyes's Goad House, from its clean white brick façade to its front pillars, layout and proportions. Over the Tuscan-colonnaded and entablatured front portico is Keyes's central triangular pediment with ornate cornices. A tall, iron-railed transom window tops the front door. The house's simple symmetry and proportions are broken up by a large garage to one side. Low lanterned walls of matching construction to the house frame the front of the property. It was built for Max M. Fisher (Forbes 400 member and \\"oil and real estate magnate\\") as his main residence. (Fisher was a very close friend of fellow Keyes-client John Bugas.At John Bugas’ Ranch. The Max M. Fisher Archives. Retrieved December 10, 2014.) The house contains another Keyes-signature \\"glass-walled garden room\\" where Fisher conducted his business at home, overlooking the pool and golf course to the south. Fisher was a major supporter of Israel (its \\"most successful fund raiser\\" and \\"the single most important lay person in the American Jewish community\\") and close Middle East advisor to Republican Presidents Nixon, Ford, Reagan, G.H.W. Bush, and G.W. Bush—and for many years the estate was guarded by a White House security detail. Fisher died in his house in 2005. Scherer House Scherer House Lake Shore Rd., Grosse Pointe Shores (1951) Client: Robert Pauli Scherer Style: Regency Scherer House is a rambling, split-level design of white brick construction. The house forms a crescent (typical to the Regency style), with a dramatic open floor plan with walls of glass facing Lake St. Clair. In the center of the house is a sweeping staircase and soaring two-story window. The extensive gardens and grounds are elevated and tiered down to the lake. The estate was designed by Keyes for Robert Pauli Scherer. (Scherer—at the age of 24 in 1930—invented the rotary die encapsulation process, which revolutionized the pharmaceutical world and helped raise worldwide health and nutritional standards. He created a multibillion-dollar company around his invention, and his experimental machine ended up in the Smithsonian Institution in 1955.) The house contained a fully equipped metalworking and woodworking shop in the basement. Scherer House was later razed by a new owner—a very rare occurrence for a Keyes house. Hudson Tannahill House Hudson Tannahill House Lee Gate Ln., Grosse Pointe Farms (1947) Client: Robert Hudson Tannahill Style: Regency, Georgian Hudson Tannahill House is the earliest example of what would become Keyes's signature distinctive Regency style: white brick construction (with brick pilasters), strong symmetrical façade, a hipped roofline partially concealed by a parapet (giving the appearance of a flat roof), a dormered (garage) wing, and low walls of matching construction. The house has a motor courtyard behind electric gates, and an attached conservatory that overlooks adjacent Lake St. Clair. The estate was built for Robert Hudson Tannahill (a foremost art collector, patron, and scion of J. L. Hudson's department store fortune). Tannahill had one of the most extensive and \\"peerless\\" private late 19th and early 20th-century European art collections in the world. He built his home on Lee Gate Lane specifically to accommodate his sprawling collection—and he looked hard to find an architect to match the quality of his art. (Tannahill and his close first cousin Eleanor Clay Ford, wife of Edsel, had a long relationship with recently deceased Albert Kahn, and Tannahill's choice of Keyes as next in line to design his home is a testament to Keyes's standing at the time. Keyes, like Tannahill, nonetheless remains relatively unknown today.) When Tannahill was having the house designed and built in the 1940s, he was becoming increasingly \\"reclusive and protective of his art.\\" The house \\"was like a museum\\"—though \\"he seldom showed his collection\\"—with major works of art as well as many small, elegant pieces. His 5-foot-tall Woman Seated in an Armchair (which he called \\"the mistress of the house\\"), as well as a parade of other Picassos, dramatically adorned the house's stairwell, a Renoir nude adorned the living room, and a Matisse still life hung over the dining room table. \\"Tannahill was loath to lend art he kept in his home, preferring to be surrounded by their beauty. Still, he enjoyed entertaining friends and family there,\\" which \\"evoked the atmosphere of the great French salons.\\" He donated almost 500 pieces of art to the Detroit Institute of Arts during his life, and upon his death in 1969 he bequeathed another 557 pieces (ranging from Impressionist masterpieces to African miniatures) as well as a large acquisition endowment. (Tannahill's gifts, valued at around half-a-billion dollars, \\"have become among the most recognizable and highly prized paintings\\" in the museum's world-class collection—all of which he notably restricted from sale and thus protected from creditors.) Tannahill had the house \\"built like a bunker, meant to stop the spread of fire\\" in order to protect his art, using \\"stout walls and ceilings\\" made of \\"a lot of cement\\" (and the parapet exterior wall extending above the roof was commonly used as a fire wall). Ironically, the roof was badly damaged in a fire on November 14, 2014 during renovations by a new owner. Knudsen/Hermelin Mansion Knudsen Mansion Bingham Rd., Birmingham (1939) Client: Semon E. Knudsen Style: Colonial Georgian Designed by Keyes for Semon Emil \\"Bunkie\\" Knudsen (Executive Vice President of General Motors Company and President of Ford Motor Company), Knudsen Mansion has been described as a \\"lovely,\\" \\"rambling family home,\\" a \\"huge mansion,\\" and \\"a sprawling, twelve- room colonial farmhouse, with two tennis courts and a swimming pool, on 40 acres in suburban Birmingham, Mich.\\" Keyes returned again to mixing building materials that he used the previous year at Welch House—in this case using stone gable faces against the house's brick—as well as retractable fabric awnings framing the windows (a detail Keyes had occasionally used elsewhere, such as on Welch House, Buhs House and Windmill Pointe). White iron rails decorate the upper windows. Keyes connected the main wing and the large garage wing of the asymmetric house with a line of single-story, flat-roofed sun rooms, one with a large circular skylight. The back patio is of brick, framed by low brick walls. Stone pillars (matching the stone of the house) and iron gates mark the entrance to a long winding drive through thick woods (and 24-hour security) that finally ends at the mansion. The estate is the largest of any of Keyes's projects, as well as the most hidden from view (followed in both cases by Woodland). Upon being fired from Ford in 1971, Knudsen moved to Cleveland and sold his mansion (after subdividing, containing less than half of the original property) two years later to David Hermelin (United States ambassador to Norway and Detroit area philanthropist and entrepreneur), who would have major additions built on the house (including enormous structures which partially overlap Keyes's original rooflines) and whose widow is still the owner. (Hermelin was known to host major Presidential fund raisers for Bill Clinton at Knudsen Mansion—which is also known as the Hermelin House.) Welch House Welch House Vaughan Rd., Bloomfield Hills (1938) Client: Charles G. Welch Style: Tudor Revival A block down the leafy, estate-lined road (what Elmore Leonard described in Out of Sight as \\"Vaughan Road, nothing but money\\") from Keyes's much later Woodland, Welch House is a grand, white brick manor house with a slate roof. Keyes's Tudor Revival interpretation mixed shingled exterior faces with the brick, and surrounded a main brick-corbelled gable with additional gables to create an asymmetric façade. Retractable fabric awnings originally framed the front windows, overlooking a front yard sloping south down to the slate-roofed, white brick pillars of the front gate. The entranceway is placed at the end of a long drive which circles behind the house to the North. It was built for Charles G. Welch (partner in the eponymous Welch Brothers Motor Car Company, a luxury automobile manufacturer founded by his father in 1904 and acquired by General Motors Company in 1910). Buhs House Buhs House Lochmoor Dr., Grosse Pointe Shores (1936) Client: Lloyd H. Buhs Style: International Buhs House was an extremely innovative home for its day in 1936, called in Architectural Record magazine \\"an outstanding example of modern architecture. The 'Made in Detroit' Home was built and equipped with materials made in Detroit and sponsored by the Detroit Board of Commerce.\\" Keyes followed much of the International Style of Swiss architect Le Corbusier, and even anticipated the stripped-down Functionalism exemplified in the 1930s in Sweden in Södra Ängby. In Buhs House, Keyes first experimented with a large, clean white brick façade and strict functionalistic themes of cubic volumes, flat-rolled sheet roofs, large windows, and rounded walls and balconies (Le Corbusier's \\"ocean liner\\" aesthetic) that he would gradually morph into his own Regency Moderne style. Keyes designed the home for Lloyd H. Buhs.Michigan Historical Collections. Bentley Historical Library, University of Michigan. Retrieved on February 3, 2013. (The Buhs's daughter, Martha Henry, became a notable American-Canadian actress. Lloyd Buhs, the secretary- treasurer of the Pfeiffer Brewing Company, was charged in 1943 with embezzling company funds to purchase a controlling interest in a small war plant.) Woodley Green Woodley Green Lake Shore Dr., Grosse Pointe (1934, 1959) Clients: Emory W. Clark, Benson Ford Style: Regency, Georgian Woodley Green, considered \\"one of [Keyes's] finest houses,\\" is another important work in the Regency and Neo-Palladian style, with a stone pediment front portico with Ionic columns, a parapet and copper hipped roof, and a red brick façade with Keyes's expected \\"delicate iron grillwork railings\\" and symmetrical bow- fronted flanking wings. Overlooking Lake St. Clair at the end of a long, looping gravel driveway \\"in the midst of beautifully landscaped grounds on Lake Shore Road, it has the appearance of some venerable English country seat\\" (including its \\"somewhat disquieting proportions\\" and \\"the rather archeological quality of the detail\\"). Woodley Green was formerly the lakeside estate of Benson Ford (grandson of Henry Ford), for whom Keyes made extensive renovations in 1959. (It is also known as the Emory W. Clark House after the President of the First National Bank of Detroit, for whom it was originally designed by Keyes in 1934.) Other notable works Schlafer House Schlafer House Fairway Hills Dr., Franklin (1961) Client: Maurice A. Schlafer Style: Regency, Ranch In 1961, when Keyes was 73, five years after he designed Fisher House on Fairway Hills Dr. in Franklin, Maurice A. Schlafer (of the Schlafer Iron and Metal family) hired him to design a miniature version right across the street. The single story ranch-style house wraps around the back of the property in a U-shape, leaving a deceptively diminutive façade that belies its five-thousand square feet (which still makes it one of the smallest of Keyes's houses). It has Fisher House's Regency white brick and Tuscan colonnade and entablature with spiral volutes. Contrasting French shutters frame the walls of windows. Keyes retained his characteristic clean lines, open floor plan, and dramatic light-filled rooms—provided by the maximized window surface area from the back courtyard. Schlafer House would be the last project of Keyes's career. Whitby Hall Detroit Institute of Arts, Detroit (1955) Style: Colonial Georgian Keyes was chosen by the Detroit Institute of Arts to design the elaborate interior rooms of Whitby Hall, the centerpiece of its American Decorative Arts Gallery. The interiors \\"were completely redecorated with a new background formed by panelling from Early American Colonial houses. The alterations made to Whitby Hall were quite comprehensive.\\" New ceilings, fireplaces (including a design with elaborate Doric frieze carving in the parlor), windows, air supply equipment, wiring and lighting \\"presented a number of problems which were successfully solved.\\"Bulletin. The Detroit Institute of Arts. Volume XXXV, No. 2, 1955-56. Retrieved on November 15, 2014. Whitby Hall was an 18th- century Pennsylvania country house, the farm acquired in 1741 and the house enlarged in 1754 by James Coultas (merchant, shipowner, and high sheriff of Philadelphia from 1755 to 1758). The original house featured a steep pedimented gable with cove cornices, and a three-story, pedimented stone entrance and stair tower. Much of the architectural ornament of Whitby Hall is originally attributed to Samuel Harding (who designed the interior of Independence Hall in 1753, the inspiration for Whitby's stair tower). The interiors were removed from Whitby Hall in the 1920s and installed at the DIA (where, \\"ironically, the façade is of white clapboard, a far cry from Whitby's actual stately gray stone\\"). Emory Ford House Woodland Pl., Grosse Pointe (1949) Client: Emory M. Ford Style: Regency Another renovation and addition by Keyes, the Emory Ford House was originally built in 1928 by Robert O. Derrick. When Emory M. Ford (the great grandson of John Baptiste Ford and part of the \\"Chemical Ford\\" family) acquired the estate in 1940, Ford hired Keyes to make significant changes. Keyes added \\"artistic glass and mirror installations, including a stair banister with glass balusters,\\" as well as an attached conservatory overlooking Lake St. Clair and a mansard roof with parapet. The house sits just down the road from Keyes's much earlier mansard house Pingree House. Tyrol Ski Lodge Tyrol Ski Lodge Hidden Valley Resort, Gaylord (1947) Client: Donald B. McLouth Style: Swiss Chalet The Hidden Valley Resort was formed in 1937 by Detroit-area steel magnate Donald B. McLouth (founder and president of McLouth Steel) and was the first private ski club in North America (and had the first motorized rope tow in the U.S.). Members included Detroit industrialists such as the families of Henry Ford, William Durant, Walter Briggs, C. Thorne Murphy, Alvan Macauley, David Wallace, Gordon Saunders, and Lang Hubbard.Eckert, Kathryn Bishop, Buildings of Michigan. Oxford University Press, New York, 1993. p 440 In 1947, 6 years after McLouth hired Keyes to design his home in Bloomfield Hills, Keyes was hired to design an extensive expansion of the resort with a Tyrolian Alpine motif (aided by Austrians in charge of construction and desired by club founders who frequented the slopes of Austria and Switzerland). At the centerpiece of Keyes's design was a \\"Hansel-and-Gretel-look\\" Swiss chalet style lodge, where he incorporated bow- fronted, symmetrical wings and specifically referenced the traditional building style of houses and farms in the Alpine regions of Switzerland, Savoy and Tyrol. (Keyes's designs subsequently inspired an alpine theme throughout the nearby village of Gaylord.) The lodge's \\"original caramel-stained pine logs, accented with Bavarian-blue trim, are retained today.\\" McLouth House McLouth House Martell Dr., Bloomfield Hills (1941) Client: Donald B. McLouth Style: Regency, Georgian Designed by Keyes for Donald B. McLouth (of McLouth Steel) in 1941, McLouth House was in many ways a precursor to Goad House and Fisher House, both built in 1955; McLouth House was Keyes's initial use of many of the forms used in these much later projects, such as an ornately corniced triangular pediment, Tuscan-colonnaded and entablatured front portico, attached conservatory, curved, pilastered brick walls framing the property, and double-story patios in back (almost identical to that of Fisher House). Keyes used what was becoming his signature clean white brick construction. (McLouth House and Goad House were both filming locations in the 2013 film The Ides of March.) McLouth would later again hire Keyes for his summer home and private wilderness club Green Timbers, as well as for the Tyrol Ski Lodge at his Hidden Valley Resort. (McLouth House is also known as the Caldwell House, after its subsequent owner Philip Caldwell, the successor to Henry Ford II as Chairman and CEO of Ford Motor Company.) Joy House Joy House Renaud Rd., Grosse Pointe Shores (1938) Client: Richard P. Joy, Jr. Style: Regency Joy House is another of Keyes's flat-roof designs with ornate double-cornices and white brick construction, and evolved into his Regency style with a colonnaded front portico and delicate iron gates and railings. Joy House also has an early example of what would become Keyes's signature large central transom window. A gabled roof was later built atop the original flat roof (though not by Keyes). (Richard Joy, Jr., for whom Keyes designed the house, hails from the Joy dynasty, his grandfather James F. Joy a railroad magnate and \\"one of the foremost business men of the U.S.\\" and his father Richard P. Joy the President of the National Bank of Commerce and a Director of the Packard Motor Car Company—where his brother Henry B. Joy was also President and a major investor—among other companies. Records of Richard Jr. mention him only as a \\"yachtsman\\"—the Joy family were long time New York Yacht Club members.) Lake Park House Lake Park House Lake Park Rd., Bloomfield Hills (1937) Client: Max M. Gilman Style: Regency, Georgian Keyes designed Lake Park House for Max M. Gilman (President of the Packard Motor Car Company). His \\"huge house in Bloomfield Hills\\" represented a departure from the huge baronial houses in Grosse Pointe, such as that of Gilman's long time predecessor Alvan Macauley (whose son Edward also owned a Keyes Grosse Pointe house). Keyes continued his large white brick façade, accented with French shutters, a unique colonnaded copper front portico, and a steep, hipped roof broken up with curved dormers. In the back, copper awnings frame the windows, a two-story windowed vestibule with more columns overlooks the sloping garden, and a lower wing extends to the side (which was later removed when the large estate was subdivided) where an iron-railed patio is concealed above an open garden conservatory. The wooded end of the garden rolls sharply down to an inland lake (Quarton Lake, along the same tributary as Goad House). Hudson House Lothrop Rd., Grosse Pointe Farms (1937) Client: J. Stewart Hudson Style: Regency, Georgian Hudson House is one of several Regency style houses built by Keyes in Grosse Pointe in the thirties containing many Neo-Palladian and Jeffersonian (sometimes labeled as Georgian) architectural details. The broad, imposing red brick mansion has symmetrical wings flanking a central triangular pediment tympanum with circular stone relief, an Ionic-columned stone portico, arched brickwork, and a flat, parapet roof. An iron fence frames a circular drive in the front and intricate gardens and fountains in the back. The interior features arched doorways, a loggia and two-story sweeping staircase. The estate was built for Doctor J. Stewart Hudson. Trix House Trix House Fisher Rd. (formerly E. Jefferson Ave.), Grosse Pointe (1937) Client: Herbert B. Trix Style: Regency, International Designed right after Buhs House, Keyes continued his International/Functionalism Style in Trix House, with a simple flat roof, white brick construction, large windows and rounded walls—though with an increasingly distinctive Regency flair with ornate double-cornices and contrasting French shutters. Its otherwise very cubic volumes are broken up by a curved entranceway that leads to a side garage wing with attached greenhouse. The estate originally had an E. Jefferson avenue address, until the large lot was subdivided and the house used a new facing side road as its address. The house was built for Herbert B. Trix, President of automotive supplier American Injector Company, Director of several banks, one-time mayor of Grosse Pointe, and, at forty, the youngest president in the Detroit Athletic Club's history. Pingree House Pingree House Woodland Pl., Grosse Pointe (1935) Clients: Hazen Pingree family Style: Second Empire Pingree House was built in 1909 (the first house ever built on once heavily wooded Woodland Place on Lake St. Clair—now a suburban cul-de-sac) as the summer home of the Hazen S. Pingree family. (Pingree was a four-term mayor of Detroit and Governor of Michigan.) The original small house was built in a whimsical Dutch Colonial style with gambrel roof and flared eaves, designed by William Stratton (who built a similar gambrel-roofed, \\"low, one-and-a-half story English farm house\\" the same year a block away for Frederick M. Alger). In 1935, the Pingrees hired Keyes to design extensive additions to their home (as he had done in 1925 for William Pickett Harris), tripling its original size in order to turn it into a year-round residence. Keyes retained the same brick construction (including in the new carriage house), and created several bow-fronted wings of additions that wrap around the original structure. Keyes blended a new mansard roofline with the original similar gambrel roof, giving the expanded house a more French (Second Empire) style. (Keyes borrows from Robert O. Derrick's 1926 design of nearby Edwin H. Brown House, \\"striking a note of restrained yet charmingly intimate French Classicism with its Mansard roof.\\") Pingree House is significant in that it marked the beginning of Keyes's more restrained and increasingly French-influenced Regency style, and it was his first use of the mansard roof that would be a prominent feature in what he considered one of his greatest designs—Woodland. Descendants of the Pingrees lived in the home until 1976. (It is also known as the Parker/Mills House.) The Acorns The Acorns Metamora (1931) Client: Gail Stephens Kinard Style: Log Lodge, Swiss Chalet Gail Stephens (Kinard), a \\"wealthy Detroit sportswoman\\" whose father was lumber baron Henry Stephens, hired Keyes to build \\"a magnificent lodge named 'The Acorns' in the quiescent hills of Metamora, far from the hustle and bustle of the motor city.\\" Described as a \\"costly Norwegian hunting lodge,\\" \\"an elaborate rural retreat\\" and a \\"palatial country estate,\\" the building is constructed of large logs on the main floor and timber framing with board-and-batten exterior on the upper floor. Ornate murals reference the 19th-century Great Camps and Swiss chalet style of architecture. A massive stone fireplace has an inscription that reads: \\"They say— What do they say? Who cares what they say?\\" (Gail Stephens Kinard achieved much notoriety when she reunited with her childhood sweetheart, Dr. Kerwin Kinard, whom she first met as a student in Berlin and hadn't seen for twenty-five years, and suddenly married shortly thereafter—for which she was served a one-million dollar \\"alienation of affections\\" suit in 1932 from Dr. Kinard's estranged wife, and was \\"dropped from Detroit's social register of 1933.\\") Mennen Hall Mennen Hall Provençal Rd., Grosse Pointe Farms (1929) Clients: Henry P. Williams, Elma C. Mennen Style: Tudor Revival Arched chimney caps dot the roofline of Keyes's stately brick Tudor, Mennen Hall, that sits along a private, guarded road. It was built for (real estate tycoon) Henry P. Williams and his wife Elma C. Mennen (heiress to the Mennen personal grooming products fortune), whose eldest son was G. Mennen \\"Soapy\\" Williams (a six-term Governor of Michigan and Chief Justice of the Michigan Supreme Court). Dwyer/Palms House Dwyer/Palms House Lake Shore Rd., Grosse Pointe Farms (1928) Client: Marie Fleitz Dwyer Style: French Normandy Built \\"in the late 20s, when cost was of little or no consideration,\\" for Marie Fleitz Dwyer, the widowed daughter of a Michigan lumber baron and grain merchant, the French Normandy style house was the first in the area wired for telephones (and, until recently, there was a circuit panel in the garage through which all the neighborhood phones were wired). The house was made from limestone and the roof from slate with a copper flat top, and an intricate stone-carved pediment frames the front door. The house contains \\"a step-down living room, a sweeping staircase, curved hallways,\\" and numerous fireplaces. (Keyes designed a smaller version of the Dwyer/Palms House the same year on Kenwood Rd. in Grosse Pointe Farms.) The estate's \\"impeccable grounds\\" back onto Lake St. Clair, originally with a dock extending over 100 feet into the lake. The house and grounds have been the filming location for several movies. Keane House Keane House Lakeland St., Grosse Pointe (1926) Client: Jerome E. Keane Style: Tudor Revival Built for (investment banker) Jerome E. Keane, Keane House is a large Tudor of red brick and half-timbering. The design included Keyes's first use of a massive wall with slate-roofed pillars surrounding the estate, which matches and is incorporated into the brick façade of the house—an often-repeated motif later in his career. Multiple gables with intricate brick corbelling are a new Keyes motif (that he would use again and again, for example in 1928 in the Stoepel House on Touraine Road in Grosse Pointe Farms and later at Welch House and Woodland on Vaughan Road in Bloomfield Hills). Windmill Pointe Windmill Pointe Windmill Pointe Dr., Grosse Pointe (1925) Client: William Pickett Harris Style: Tudor Revival The \\"sprawling palace on Windmill Pointe with its groomed grounds, coffered ceilings and limestone arches\\" was originally designed by New York model farm architect Alfred Hopkins in an extravagant Tudor style for William Pickett Harris (an investment banker, expert on squirrels, and curator of mammals at the Museum of Zoology of the University of Michigan). Just four years after the house's completion, Keyes was hired to double its original size in order to accommodate Harris's growing family—which included his daughter Julie Harris (the stage, screen, and television actress—\\"the most decorated performer in the history of Broadway\\"). Keyes incorporated original architectural details, windows and doors into his outward and upward expansion. Among this expansion were additional bedrooms, including a master bedroom on the main floor (\\"a rare setup for a home built in the 1920s\\"—and one Keyes would later adopt in many other projects). But of most significance was Keyes's lower level recreation room and wine cellar along with a sunken rock garden. As American Home magazine described its innovative design in 1934: Ridgeland Ridgeland Lewiston Rd., Grosse Pointe (1924) Client: Charles A. Dean Style: Italianate On a sloping ridge surrounded by giant oak trees lies Ridgeland, a rambling country villa in the Italianate style made of tawny bricks (rather than Italian stucco). \\"Designed by Keyes during the height of the roaring twenties, it provided a dramatic setting for large parties the wealthy Charles Dean (its original owner) was famous for hosting.\\" The house informally sprawls backward asymmetrically down the hillside, folding back on itself so that \\"the house becomes part of the view from its own windows.\\" With its expansive brick walls, outbuildings, and potting shed, \\"the house feels like its own enclosed community.\\" (It is thought that a secret underground passageway exists from the main house to the garage.) The variously scaled rooms open up through French doors to slate patios, intimate gardens and stretches of lawn. Ridgeland's Italianate style is Keyes's first significant experiment with Palladianism, synthesized with picturesque aesthetics: low- pitched and hipped tile roofs, stained glass windows, arched doors and ceilings, loggias and balconies with wrought iron railings, a tower, and walls and beams painted with elaborate 14th-century Florentine motifs. (Ridgeland is also known as the Charles A. Dean House.)

He was Recorder of London in 1635–36 (by king's mandate), attorney of court of wards in 1636, and was knighted the same year. Biography Calthorpe, the third son of Sir James Calthorpe of Cockthorpe, Norfolk, and Barbara, daughter of John Bacon of Hesset, Suffolk, was one of a family of eight sons and six daughters, and was born at Cockthorpe in 1586. He entered at the Middle Temple, and seems early to have enjoyed a large and lucrative practice. By the death of his father in 1615 he inherited considerable estates in his native county, but he continued sedulously to devote himself to his profession. Shortly after the marriage of Charles I Calthorpe was appointed solicitor-general to Queen Henrietta Maria, after whom one of his daughters was named. When in November 1627 the five gentlemen who had been thrown into prison for refusing to contribute to the forced loan applied to the court of king's bench for a writ of habeas corpus, Calthorpe was counsel for Sir Thomas Darnell, being associated in the case with Noy, Serjeant Bramston, and Selden; and we are told that \\"the gentlemen's counsel pleaded at Westminster with wonderful applause, even of shouting and clapping of hands, which is unusual in that place\\". In the proceedings against the seven members in the spring of 1630, Calthorpe was counsel for Benjamin Valentine, one of the three who held down the speaker in the chair. In the conduct of this case he seems to have shown some lack of zeal, though when his turn came to speak he defended his client with conspicuous ability, notwithstanding that his sympathies were with the court party. In December 1635 he succeeded Mason as recorder of London, the corporation having been specially requested to elect him in a letter which Charles I addressed to them on his behalf. He held the recordership only a few weeks, for in January 1636 he was made attorney of the court of wards and liveries, and resigned the other appointment. Shortly after this he was knighted, and was chosen to be reader of his inn, but he never discharged the duties of his office, causa mortalitatis, as Dugdale notes. He was now in his fifty-first year, and his path seemed clear to the highest legal preferments, but death came upon him in the full vigour of his powers in August 1637. Family Calthorpe married Dorothy, daughter and heiress of Edward Humphrey, and with her had a family of ten children, only one of whom, Sir James Calthorpe of Ampton (said to have been knighted by Oliver Cromwell), attained maturity. From him the present Lord Calthorpe is lineally descended. NotesReferences * Endnotes: ** Papers of Norfolk and Norwich Archæol.

It arranged finance and handled imports from those two companies of products such as tea, silk and jute. Matheson & Company also became involved in venture-capital, specializing in mining. The company was a member of the consortium that formed the Rio Tinto Company. After 1912 it became a subsidiary of Jardine Matheson. Foundation Hugh Matheson (1821 - 1898) James Matheson, one of the two founders of the Hong Kong-based Jardine Matheson trading company, founded Matheson & Company in 1848 after he returned from China. The company was created in a reorganization of Magniac-Jardine and Company, which had come close to liquidation in the 1847 financial crisis. From 1848 until he died in 1898 the senior partner of Matheson and Company was Hugh Matheson. Hugh was the nephew of James Matheson. In 1843 his uncle had invited him to join Jardine Matheson in Hong Kong, but he declined due to moral scruples about that firm's involvement in the opium trade. Instead he had joined Magniac- Jardine, Jardine Matheson's London correspondents. Trader Matheson and Company became involved in shipping products to China such as coal and boilers, and entered into the larger business of buying up surplus cotton goods in Liverpool and Manchester and shipping them to China, where Jardine Matheson arranged for their sale to local dealers. William Keswick, a relative of the Jardines, spent some time with Matheson and Company before going to China in 1855 to work for Jardine Matheson, where he rose to become the chief executive in Hong Kong, and later to run the entire company from London, reporting only to Sir Robert Jardine. Jardine Skinner was not legally connected to Jardine Matheson, although both used the facilities of Matheson & Company. Jardine Skinner's agents in Manchester were Matheson & Scott, who were associated with Matheson & Company. In the late 1850s Matheson and Company was appointed Jardine Skinner's principal agent in London, handling imports of commodities such as tea, rice, silk, cotton, jute and indigo. Jardine Skinner entered into joint ownership arrangements with Matheson & Co. of a number of tea estates in the early 1860s. Jardine Skinner had to weather financial crises in 1848 and 1866, supported by credit from Matheson & Co., and in 1890 returned the favor when Matheson found itself in difficulty. Investor Between the 1860s and 1914, while acting as London representatives of Jardine Skinner and Jardine Matheson, Matheson & Co. also moved into international venture capital investments, particularly in mining. In February 1873 Hugh Matheson obtained agreement from the Spanish government to sell the Rio Tinto mines on the Rio Tinto in Huelva, Spain, to a syndicate he had arranged. This was made up of Matheson (24%), Deutsche Bank (56%) and the railway construction company Clark, Punchard (20%). The Rio Tinto Company was launched on 28 March 1873, headed by Hugh Matheson. Hugh Matheson and his financial partners controlled Rio Tinto until the late 1880s, when the London and Paris Rothschilds gained control. Matheson & Company also invested in copper mining in California and gold mining in South Africa. With less success, the company invested in oil production in Peru and in the 1900s in mining opportunities in Russia. Subsidiary In 1912 the interests of the Matheson family were bought out, and from then on it had the same shareholders as Jardine Matheson. After World War I (1914-1918) Matheson & Company generally withdrew from venture capital opportunities and focused on providing banking and merchanting services in London for Jardines. However, after 1936 the company did make various minor investments in East Africa. For tax purposes, Matheson & Co. was a subsidiary of Jardine Matheson. In practice, the proprietors in Scotland made the decisions and transmitted them to Hong Kong through the London office. As London grew as an international financial hub, in the 1960s Matheson & Co. expanded their merchant banking operations.

He was born in Écija and died in Madrid, where he spent most of his life.  Childhood and early years  He showed very early a deep interest for fine arts and took drawing lessons from local painters in Écija (Sevilla). His retail merchant parents were conscious of his strong vocation and, realising that his dream was to become a painter, they eventually gave their consent to his departure for Madrid. When he was only 14 years old he moved to the capital to enter the Real Academia de Bellas Artes de San Fernando. He prepared his accession exams drawing and copying sculptures in the Museo Nacional de Reproducciones Artísticas. At fifteen, the minimum age for admission, he succeeded at his first attempt to enter the Academy and immediately enrolled in oil painting, encaustic, tempera, etching, watercolour and sculpture. He completed the five compulsory years in the Academy and then remained two more years, developing teaching activities, to finally achieve a master's degree. Among his fellow students were Salvador Dalí, with whom he developed a close friendship fuelled by their reciprocal admiration.  Artistic education  His teachers in the Academy included Cecilio Plá and José Benedito (painting), José Moreno Carbonero and Julio Romero de Torres (drawing) and Francisco Esteve Botey (etching). Between 1924 and 1927, he was awarded with a fellowship from the Fundación Molina Higueras and also twice obtained a scholarship to join the Artist's Summer Residence in el Paular (Madrid). His work, presented in a common exhibition with other resident artists, was accredited with a diploma with honours. He also obtained two residence scholarships to visit during the summer the Artist's Residence of the Alhambra (Granada). At the closing exhibition hosted by the residence, he met Federico García Lorca, Manuel de Falla and Daniel Vázquez Díaz, who highly praised his paintings. In 1930, the Junta para la Ampliación de Estudios e Investigaciones Científicas awarded him a scholarship to visit Paris and its drawing academy. In 1932, he participated for the first time in the Exposición Nacional (National Exhibition) and was awarded the Bronze Medal for his work \\"Portrait\\". In the same year, he presented a colour aquatint at the International Exhibition of Venice. In 1933, he obtained a position as a drawing teacher in a high school in Elche, but he resigned after only one year and returned to Madrid. In 1934, he won the Silver Medal in the Exposición Nacional for his picture \\"Chinese mannequin\\", painted in the Museo Arqueológico de Madrid. In 1935, he was appointed head of studies in the Escuela de Artes Aplicadas y Oficios Artísticos de Madrid, in the graphic design section.  The Spanish Civil War years  During the Spanish Civil War, he joined the teacher's union FETE-UGT and the Alianza de Intelectuales Antifascistas (Alliance of Antifascist Intellectuals) which included among its leading figures the poet Rafael Alberti. During this period, graphic artists contributed to the war effort producing signs, notices and placards for the Republican Army. As public servants enlisted in the popular militias, he joined the Quinto regimiento (Fifth Regiment). He was a comrade of great poets, such as the forgotten and much admired by him Antonio Aparicio (later forced into exile) and Miguel Hernández. During these years, he carried out an intense artistic activity. In 1937, he participated in the Paris International Exposition with a painting featuring the shooting of Federico García Lorca. This canvas, later displayed in the Centro de Arte Reina Sofía in an exhibition commemorating the Spanish pavilion of the International Exposition, was hosted by the Museo de Arte Moderno of Barcelona. In 1943, the Real Academia de San Fernando awarded him the Conde de Cartagena fellowship.  Plenitude  In 1946, his work \\"Portrait\\" received the First medal in the Salón de Otoño (Madrid). The following year, he was awarded the Second prize in the National Painting Contest and, in 1948, he won the First prize with his work \\"Bathers\\". In 1950, he obtained a faculty position as art lecturer on drawing in the Escuela de Artes Aplicadas y Oficios Artísticos de Madrid and was awarded the first prize in the national competition organised by the Unión Española de Explosivos for his painting \\"The Sorcerer\\". That year, commissioned by the Unión Española de Explosivos, he painted the rock salt mines of Cardona (Barcelona). In 1951, his painting \\"Sleeping Dancer\\", later purchased for a private collection in Mexico, received the second prize in a public vote organised during the Primera Bienal Hispanoamericana de Arte (Madrid). In 1952, he was awarded the second medal for etching in the Exposición Nacional de Bellas Artes (National Exhibition of Fine Arts). In 1954, he received a scholarship to develop pedagogic studies about drawing in France and Italy. In 1955, he received the first prize in the Fine Arts Exhibition of Linares (Jaén). In 1958, he participated in a competition to design the tapestry cartoons intended for the Valley of the Fallen National Monument, in Cuelgamuros (Madrid), obtaining the first prize. In 1962, he was appointed director of the Escuela 7ª de Artes y Oficios Artísticos de Madrid. He could be defined as a complete painter, as he addressed all the possible subjects, including landscapes, still lifes, figures and portraits using the most diverse techniques, from watercolour to fresco. He worked in his artist's studio in the Madrilenian street of Hortaleza, where he took full advantage of the particular light and orientation of his penthouse, which became a sort of magic box that produced his still lifes and figures, all painted from life. He often travelled to Galicia, Asturias, Cantabria and the Basque Country and became a passionate lover of the Spanish northern coast, where he painted the many landscapes he used to present in the Salones de Otoño. In 1942, he married in Llanes (Oviedo) his wife Isabel Fernández-Pola, a member of a family of Llanes intellectuals. He was a great portrayer and many of his works are nowadays hosted in different private collections. In 1968, the cessation of the National Exhibitions and the Salones de Otoño and his bad relationship with art critics, especially embittered after the publication of his article \\"I, a Spanish painter\\" – which included a ferocious criticism of contemporary pictorial movements – drove him to withdraw from all public exhibitions and motivated his refusal to sell any painting in Spain. In fact, most of his production was thereafter sold in the United States. Nonetheless, he continued painting assiduously until his last days. In 1975, he retired from the Artes y Oficios Artísticos de Madrid. A street named Pintor Fernando Briones was dedicated to him in his birthplace, Écija (Sevilla).

He was drafted by the New York Giants in the fourth round of the 2014 NFL Draft. He played college football at Boston College, where he was a finalist for the 2013 Heisman Trophy, and won the 2013 Doak Walker Award as the nation's best running back. During the 2013 season, Williams became only the 16th player in NCAA history to rush for over 2,000 yards and he finished his college career ranked 5th all-time for most yards rushed in a single season with 2,177 yards. Early years Born in Poughkeepsie to Jamaican immigrants Lancelene and Ervin, Williams spent his first year back in his family's island nation before returning to live in Central New Jersey with his parents, sister, and two brothers. His family also lived in Atlanta, Georgia and Allentown, Pennsylvania. \\"By the eighth grade, \\" Williams would later explain, \\"I decided I was going to play Division I football.\\" After transferring from Harrison High School in Kennesaw, Georgia, he attended Parkland High School in Allentown. As a senior, he had 1,913 rushing yards on 128 carries and 33 touchdowns for the football team. He earned All-State Class AAAA first-team honors as a senior running back, and was selected as The Morning Call Player of the Year. He led the Trojans to a 10-3 record in 2009. In addition to football, he was also a standout athlete for Parkland High School's track and field team. At the 2010 PA 3A state championships, he finished third in the 100 meters, with a time of 10.76 seconds, and second in the 200 meters with a time of 22.01 seconds. He was also timed at 14.61 seconds in the 110 meter hurdles in 2009. Considered a three-star recruit by Rivals.com, he was rated as the 44th best running back prospect in the nation. He committed to Boston College over offers from Temple, Akron and Vanderbilt. College career While attending Boston College, Williams played for its Eagles football team from 2010 to 2013. He graduated early with a degree in applied psychology and human development. Freshman season Williams's first three years at Boston College were relatively uneventful. Playing as a true freshman in 2010, Williams showed his potential while sharing the backfield with Montel Harris and Sterlin Phifer. He played in all 13 games, rushing for 461 yards on 95 carries with two touchdowns. In the final regular season game of the year, playing at Syracuse, he set the school record for rushing attempts in a game, running 42 times as the Eagles beat the Orange 16-7. Williams during his tenure at Boston College. Sophomore season As a sophomore in 2011, Williams continued to improve, but played less time with sharing the backfield with Rolandon Finch, Tahj Kimble, and Montel Harris, starting seven of 10 games and rushing for 517 yards on 124 carries with four touchdowns. Junior season As a junior in 2012, he continued to be a reliable option, although for a pass-heavy offense, starting eight of nine games, rushing for 584 yards on 130 carries and four touchdowns. His efforts were mostly in vain though, as the Eagles continued to progressively get worse, winning 7 games in 2010, 4 in 2011, and only 2 in 2012. His three years of experience, however would pave the way for his breakout senior year and a turnaround for the Eagles team. Senior season With a change in coaching during the offseason, Steve Addazio brought in new coordinators and a new style of offense focused heavily on the run. Williams started off the year as a powerful weapon, running for 114 and 204 yards respectively in wins over Villanova and Wake Forest, and scoring once in each game. He had his worst performance of the season against a strong USC defense, managing only 38 yards. However, he bounced back against #8 ranked Florida State and ran for 149 yards as the Eagles nearly upset the eventual National Champions. The next week during the Homecoming game against Army he exploded offensively, scoring 5 touchdowns and rushing for 263 yards, only 1 yard shy of the school's single game rushing record. He momentarily tied the record, but unfortunately lost a yard on his last rushing attempt of the game, bringing his total back down. After rushing for only 70 yards at Clemson, he gave two solid performances against UNC and Virginia Tech, rushing for 172 and 166 yards, respectively, and scoring three times. The next week at New Mexico State, Williams managed to break the single game record that he came so close to during the Army game, running for 295 yards and two scores. The win was the first road win for Boston College since 2011. On the following week, playing on senior day, Boston College's final home game of the season against NC State, Williams broke his own record and ran for 339 yards on 42 carries, scoring twice. The performance also surpassed the ACC record, previously set at 329 yards by John Leach of Wake Forest in 1993. During the game, he also broke the school's single season record for rushing yards, finishing the day with 1,810 yards. The win made BC bowl eligible for the first time since 2010, and tripled the previous year's win total, prompting the students and fans to rush the field and celebrate with the team following the win. Williams's performance was recognized by media across the country, as he was named the Walter Camp National player of the week, as well as ACC offensive back of the week. His successes and statistics as the league's leading rusher made him the front-runner for the Doak Walker Award as the nation's best running back. After the success against NC State at home, the Eagles took on Maryland for the first of their final two road games of the season. Williams had another big day, running for 263 yards and two scores, passing 2,000 yards and becoming only the 16th player in NCAA history to accomplish this feat. With this achievement, Williams became a part of the Heisman conversation. The final game of the regular season was at 5–6 Syracuse. Unfortunately, Williams re-aggravated a right shoulder injury that he had been dealing with since the UNC game. He left the game early in the 3rd quarter and did not return, having rushed for only 29 yards for the day. Despite the disappointing end to the game, those 29 yards put Williams over 2,100 yards for the season and placed him at 9th all time in the FBS single-season rushing list. The Eagles final game of the season was in the 2013 Independence Bowl against the Arizona Wildcats. The game featured a matchup between the nation's two best running backs in Williams and Arizona's Ka'Deem Carey, who was a consensus All- American in 2012 as well as a finalist for the 2013 Doak Walker award, which Williams won. The game was a blowout win for Arizona, as they cruised to a 42–19 victory. Williams ran for 75 yards in his final contest as a college back, finishing with 2,177 yards on the season, 5th most all-time in the NCAA. =Postseason awards= Williams was one of six finalists for the Heisman Trophy in 2013, and finished fourth in the voting. He was the winner of the 2013 Doak Walker Award and was named a unanimous All-American. In addition, he was a unanimous first-team All-Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC) selection and was also a finalist for the Walter Camp Award. Professional career=New York Giants The New York Giants drafted Williams in the fourth round with the 113th overall pick of the 2014 NFL Draft.

Upon the death of their father, Augusta's brother Augustus d’Este claimed the dukedom; but the House of Lords decided against the claim, on the grounds of the invalidity of the prince’s marriage, it having been contracted without the consent of the Crown, as required by the Royal Marriages Act 1772 In 1845, when she was 44 years old and he was 63, she married as his second wife Sir Thomas Wilde, later 1st Baron Truro (7 July 1782 – 11 November 1858). They had no children together, although Lord Truro had three surviving children by his first marriage. Later life Lady Truro had strong connections with Ramsgate, Kent, residing at Mount Albion House on the East Cliff.

Washington, 420 U.S. 194 (1975), was a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court held that treaties and laws must be construed in favor of Native Americans (Indians); that the Supremacy Clause precludes the application of state game laws to the tribe; that Congress showed no intent to subject the tribe to state jurisdiction for hunting; and while the state can regulate non-Indians in the ceded area, Indians must be exempted from such regulations.  Background  Colville Reservation  History  The Colville Indian Reservation was established in the north-central part of Washington for members of twelve different tribes of Indians. These tribes were the Chelan, Colville, the Entiat, the Methow, the Nespelem, the Nez Perce of Chief Joseph's Band, the southern Okanagan, the Palus, the Sanpoil, the Sinixt (or \\"Lakes\\"), the Sinkiuse-Columbia, and the Wenatchi. The reservation was originally created 1872 by a series of Executive Orders issued by President Ulysses S. Grant and stretched from the Columbia River on the south to the Canada–US border on the north.1 915-16 (Charles J. Kappler ed. 1904). In 1887, the Dawes Act was passed and the federal government looked at allotting the land on the reservation. In 1891, an agreement was reached with the tribe that they would cede the northern half of the reservation to the government., 139-40 (2009); Rowland L. Young, Supreme Court Report, 61 1532 (Dec. 1975). As part of the terms of the agreement, Indians in the northern half who did not wish to move to the southern half would be given 80 acres of land. In addition, the United States agreed to pay $1,500,000 to the tribe and the tribe reserved hunting and fishing rights on the ceded land., at 139-40. In 1892, Congress passed an act removing the northern half from tribal jurisdiction, but not implementing all of the agreement.Act of July 1, 1892, ; Kappler, Vol. 1 at 441. The payment to the tribe was not initially made, but was eventually paid fourteen years later.  Lower courts  Alexander Antoine was an enrolled member of the Colville Confederated Tribes. In 1971, Antoine and his wife Irene were hunting on the northern half of the former reservation and were cited for hunting deer during a closed season.Antoine v. Washington, 420 U.S. 194, 195-96 (1975); , at 139-40. The Antoines were convicted of hunting and possessing a deer during a closed season in Superior Court.Colville Tribe: Control of Indian Hunting Said Illegal by High Court, , Feb. 20, 1975, at 5. After the conviction, the tribe took up their defense and appealed to the Washington Supreme Court. At the Washington Supreme Court the tribe and the Antoines argued that Article 6 of the 1891 agreement reserved to tribal members the right to hunt and fish in the ceded northern portion of the reservation.State v. Antoine, 511 P.2d 1351, 1352-53 (Wash. 1973), rev'd 420 U.S. 194 (1975). The state of Washington argued that the agreement was not a treaty, but a mere contract.Antoine, 511 P.2d at 1354; , at 140; Young, at 1532. While a treaty was \\"the supreme law of the land\\" under the Supremacy Clause, a contract was not, and a contract could not bind someone who was not a party to the contract.Antoine, 511 P.2d at 1354; , at 140; Colville Tribe, , at 5. Since the state of Washington was not a party to the contract, it could not be bound by the contract and could exercise its police power to regulate hunting and fishing.Antoine, 511 P.2d at 1354-56; , at 140. The court affirmed the convictions.Antoine, 511 P.2d at 1359; , at 140; Young, at 1532; Colville Tribe, , at 5. The tribe then appealed the case to the U.S. Supreme Court and it granted certiorari., at 140.  Supreme Court  Justice Brennan, author of the majority opinion  Arguments  The Antoines were represented by Mason D. Morisset of Seattle. Morisset first argued that treaties, laws, and agreements with Indian tribes must be construed in the tribe's favor, according to the Indian canon of construction.Br. of Antoine, 1974 WL 185799, at *8. Second, when lands are set aside for Indians, the tribe retains hunting and fishing rights unless they are specifically removed, and when the text is silent, the hunting and fishing rights remain, citing Menominee Tribe v. United States.Menominee Tribe v. United States, 391 U.S. 404 (1968); Br. of Antoine, at *8. Third, on reservation lands, the state has no authority to regulate hunting.Br. of Antoine, at *8. Fourth, the 1891 agreement is covered by the Supremacy Clause because Congress enacted a federal statute relating to Indians, which is binding on the states.Br. of Antoine, at *8. The state was represented by Joseph Lawrence Coniff, Jr., Assistant Attorney General for Washington. The state argued that since the federal government could not enter into a treaty with the Colville tribe, the Supremacy Clause did not apply.Br. of Washington, 1974 WL 185800, at *8-9. Further, the 1891 agreement was a contract, not a treaty, and as a contract could not bind the state since the state was not a party to the contract.Br. of Washington, at *8-9. Since the northern half was returned to the public domain, Washington had the authority to regulate hunting on the land.Br. of Washington, at *8-9. The United States, through Solicitor General Robert Bork filed an amicus curiae brief supporting the position of the Antoines and the tribe.Br. of United States, 1974 WL 185802, at *1.  Opinion of the Court  Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. delivered the opinion of the court. Brennan began by following Morisset's argument that the Indian canon governed, that agreements must be construed in favor of the tribe, noting that this has been law for over 150 years.Antoine, 420 U.S. at 199. Brennan next noted the fallacy of the lower courts position on the Supremacy Clause and the agreement with the tribe. He noted that once Congress passed a statute implementing the agreement, it was law and the Supremacy Clause applied.Antoine, 420 U.S. at 200-02; Ralph W. Johnson & Berrie Martinis, Chief Justice Rehnquist and the Indian Cases, 16 1, 20 (1995); Young, at 1532; Colville Tribe, , at 5. All the 1871 law did was change the method of dealing with the tribes, but a federal law still governed.Antoine, 420 U.S. at 202; Johnson, at 20; Young, at 1532; Colville Tribe, , at 5. Brennan then noted that even though the statute did not explicitly state it reserved hunting and fishing rights for the Indians, it must be construed in that manner since the agreement stated that the rights \\"shall not be taken away or in anywise abridged.\\"Antoine, 420 U.S. at 206; Young, at 1532. The court reversed the lower court.Antoine, 420 U.S. at 208; Johnson, at 20; Young, at 1532.  Concurrence  Justice Rehnquist, author of the dissenting opinion Justice William O. Douglas concurred in the opinion. Douglas summed it up clearly when he said \\"We have here only an issue involving the power of a State to impose a regulatory restraint upon a right which Congress bestowed on these Indians. Such an assertion of state power must fall by reason of the Supremacy Clause.\\"Antoine, 420 U.S. at 212 (Douglas, J. concurring); Young, at 1532.  Dissent  Justice William Rehnquist dissented. Rehnquist stated that the Washington hunting regulations and laws could only be affected by a treaty or a statute, not by an agreement between the United States and a tribe.Antoine, 420 U.S. at 213 (Rehnquist, J. dissenting). Although the ratifying or enabling act passed, authorizing monies to pay for the land, there was no language in the act about hunting or fishing rights, nor about any of the other twelve articles of the agreement.Antoine, 420 U.S. at 213-14 (Rehnquist, J. dissenting); Johnson, at 20; Young, at 1532; Colville Tribe, , at 5. Rehnquist noted that in every other case where the court held that the congressional act ratified an agreement, Congress had included the language of the agreement in the law.Antoine, 420 U.S. at 214-15 (Rehnquist, J. dissenting); Johnson, at 20.
