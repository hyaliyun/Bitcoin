Clare was held by William Vesey Fitzgerald when he became the President of the Board of Trade. As this was seen to be an office of profit, Vesey-FitzGerald had to stand in a by-election. It was not unusual for such ministerial by- elections to be uncontested. However the Catholic Association, a group campaigning for Catholic civil rights and the repeal of the Act of Union, had vowed to oppose every member of the current government, who had declined to allow for Catholic Emancipation. A number of candidates were approached but refused to stand, Vesey-FitzGerald was reasonably popular with Catholics in Clare.http://www.clarelibrary.ie/eolas/coclare/history/clare_election_1828.htm Daniel O'Connell decided to exploit a loophole in the Act of Union. It stated that Catholics could not sit in Westminster as a Member of Parliament (MP), but there was nothing about them standing for an election. Like all Parliamentary elections at the time, Clare was held as an open vote, which meant that all votes would be known. This meant that Protestant and pro-union landowners could influence their tenants, who were far more likely to be Catholic and anti-union. Result O'Connell won the by-election. Since he was a Catholic, he could not take the Oath of Supremacy, which was incompatible with Catholicism and so could not take his seat in parliament. This meant that his demand rose to allow him to become an MP for County Clare as it did not have representation. O'Connell hinted that he would get more Catholics elected to force the situation saying \\"they must crush us or conciliate us\\". Consequences The Prime Minister, the Duke of Wellington, and the Home Secretary, Sir Robert Peel, even though they opposed Catholic participation in Parliament, saw that denying O'Connell his seat would cause outrage and could lead to another rebellion or uprising in Ireland, which was about 85% Catholic.Oliver MacDonagh, The Life of Daniel O'Connell 1991 This led directly to the Catholic Relief Act 1829.

At this point, the canal is about 50 meters above the western basin. The canal coursing upslope illusion is discernible. Prehistoric Bajada \\"hanging\\" canals of southeastern Arizona were constructed after c. 1250 and remained in use until c. 1450. The presence of irrigation and domestic water supply canals in the bajada of the Pinaleño Mountains of Safford Basin expands the knowledge of prehistoric water management and agricultural intensification in the American Southwest. In contrast to the lowland riverine floodplain canals, such as those of the Hohokam culture in the Phoenix Basin, an extensive network of canal systems exists in the undulating piedmont landscape of southeastern Arizona. These canal systems are seen as an adaptive technology to mitigate the arid topography and climate, and greatly expand the settlement and agricultural potential of the area.  Scope and extent  This apparently unique series of late classic prehistoric mountain stream fed water management structures have been recently rediscovered in the Safford Basin of Arizona's upper Gila Valley. At least 28 hanging canal systems or fragments have been identified to date. The longest canals are about 9.5 kilometers (ca. 6 miles) and the total length of all systems is currently estimated to exceed 80 kilometers (ca. 50 miles) While a few of these canals may date as early as c. 800, the vast majority appear to have originated after c. 1250 and persisted until c. 1450.  Reasons for the hanging structures  Portions of these canal systems are literally \\"hung\\" on the edges of steep sided, gently sloping mesas formed from remnant Quaternary age bajadas.Lindsey, D.A., and Van Gosen, B.S., 2010, Processes of terrace formation on the Piedmont of the Santa Cruz River valley during Quaternary time, Green Valley-Tubac area, southeastern Arizona: U.S. Geological Survey Scientific Investigations Report 2010–5028, 39 p. The canals appear to be distinct from those found in the vicinity of Phoenix and elsewhere in the Southwest in that they obtained their water from mountain drainages fed by runoff, springs, and artesian sources, rather than from rivers. They are also unusual in that they traverse the vertically undulating to severely erratic uplands of basin and range topography rather than being restricted to a nearly level riverine floodplain. At places, the hanging structures are as much as 60 meters above their adjacent drainage basins. It appears the highest feasible locations on mesas were carefully selected for canal routes. It also seems clear that extreme energy efficiency was a major goal during the canal construction. Two credible reasons for these unique hanging routes is that their slope could be made largely independent of their surrounding terrain. And that much of the construction effort could be efficiently made across, rather than along the canal routes. Thus minimizing any energy loss or water robbing cuts and fills. Canal cross-sections vary from 0.30 to one meter, with atypical examples up to two meters in width, and 20 to 40 centimeters in depth. Their use seems to be primarily long distance water delivery to fields, but a few of these canals are bordered by prehistoric habitation sites and well-defined agricultural fields.  Proof of age  When assisted by historic rebuilds, several reaches of the canals still flow to this day. Portions of most of the systems remain largely pristine, and many are currently filled with fine grained sediments. These systems are located mostly on Arizona State and Coronado National Forest lands that remain largely undeveloped. While often of difficult access, major canal portions are usually easily traced. There are few access roads and fewer mesa top trails. Locations of the bajada drainage sourced hanging canals recorded to date. While the canals have been dated mostly by stratigraphy and association, other age evidence does include: being run over by roads, SCS dams, and even cemeteries roughshod without accommodation; uniform patina, lichens, and caliche; mature trees and shrubs mid-channel; extreme purposefulness and well- directed energy efficiency; and a lack of apparent use of pioneer or CCC tools except in places of obvious refurb or adaptation.  Population density  Surveys in Lefthand Canyon and Marijilda Canyon have recorded a rather heavy population concentrated along the canals, but the sites are nearly all small and scattered. Survey along many of the other canals recorded only a few small sites. These findings provide evidence in the form of agricultural intensification and settlement that points to a socio-political organization based on the collaboration and collective action of small corporate groups rather than a more complex social stratification and socio-political structure. Such findings parallel those reported in the Hohokam area.  Trading partners  Ceramics and house remains from contemporary habitation sites indicate both trading activity as well as residence by several of the prehistoric cultural groups of the Southwest. Besides the Mimbres, Mogollon, Salado, and Ancestral Puebloans, the Hohokam master canal builders of the Phoenix area are clearly included. Looking down the canal at the narrow, nearly completely filled channel of the Robinson Canal as it routes along the steep side of a mesa on its way to fields on Robinson Flat. Note the illusion of the canal coursing upslope. While it is likely that some of the canals were engineered and constructed by the local inhabitants of the Safford Basin, the Hohokam presence does suggest that Hohokam migrants may have at least in part assisted in engineering the later more sophisticated canal constructions.  Associated water management structures  The hanging canals are found in an area where other older and contemporaneous water management schemes are also present. These include conventional lowland riverine canals, extensive dry farming terraced and grid fields, numerous check dams, some of which are aproned, single room field houses, and grouped arrays of mulch rings and rock piles. No survey instruments are known to survive, but it is possible that pilot extensions of the canals themselves served as static water levels. The construction effort is variously believed to be fifty man years or more. Portions of the system give a rather strong \\"water flowing uphill\\" illusion, owing to the controlled gentle slopes and the nature of the adjacent terrain. Additional associated structures include a long aqueduct crossing a saddle, a deep and long cut, and an upcanyon routed \\"counterflow\\" canal segment.

He held the British flyweight title from 1982 to 1984. Boxing career Smart began his boxing career as a promising amateur, fighting out of the Wingfield Amateur Boxing Club based in his home town of Caerphilly. In 1979 he entered the ABA Championships held at Wembley Arena in London. He reached the final where he lost to Ray Gilbody, who would later become the British bantamweight champion. Smart turned professional in 1979, facing his first opponent, George Bailey, on 10 September in Birmingham. He stopped Bailey via technical knockout in the fourth round. Smart was prolific during 1979, following his opening victory with four further limited round bouts; winning each of the contests. Despite only having five fights under his belt, at the end of 1979 Smart was listed as second only to \\"Champagne\\" Charlie Magri in the British flyweight rankings. Smart continued his successful start to his career by beating Ian Murray in early 1980. He followed this with two wins over Iggy Jano and a win over Mohammed Younis, though when Smart and Younis were rematched a month later the referee declared the eight round match a draw. Smart took six months out before returning to the ring in November 1980 to beat Central region bantamweight champion, Steve Enwright. Smart began 1981 with a trip to Solihull, where he took a unanimous decision over Neil McLaughlin. Three months later, on 20 June, he needed just three rounds to dispatch Eddie Glencross at an encounter at the Empire Pool in Wembley. His third and final match of the year was against Liverpudlian Jimmy Bott on the undercard of Alan Minter's swansong fight at Wembley. Of the seven bouts arranged on that night, Smart's was the shortest, with Bott knocked out in the first round. Smart's unbeaten record of 14 fights led to him being offered a shot at an eliminator for European Flyweight championship against Spain's Enrique Rodríguez. The fight was arranged for 3 March 1981 and was held on the Spaniard's home soil at Oviedo. The fight went the full twelve rounds, and Rodríguez was given the decision. Despite suffering the first defeat of his career, Smart's was still one of the United Kingdom's top rated flyweight fighters. In the August of the previous year Charlie Magri had vacated his British flyweight title and Smart was lined up to challenge for the title against fellow Welsh fighter Dave George. The match was held on 14 September 1982 at the Empire pool in Wembley, and Smart and George were given top billing in an event that had both Colin Jones and Frank Bruno fighting on the undercard. The fight was scheduled for 15 rounds, but only lasted until the sixth when George was laid out for the count, making Smart the new British flyweight champion. He fought just twice in 1984, both non-title competitions, against Tito Abella of the Philippines and Canadian Ian Clyde, both results going to Smart. In January 1985, Smart's first title defense of his British title was arranged. His opponent was Hugh Russell of Northern Ireland, and the bout was arranged at King's Hall in Belfast. The 12 round bout changed hands several times in the early stages until a badly swollen eye forced Smart to retire while in his corner between the sixth and seventh round. Smart took tem months out after losing his British belt, and when he returned it was to suffer an unexpected second round defeat to Ivor Jones. Smart didn't fight throughout 1985 and on his return in January 1986, he took a narrow points decision over Midlands area bantamweight champion Rocky Lawlor. This was the final win of Smart's career. In February a return trip to Belfast saw him disqualified for a low blow against Dave McAuley, while two months later he was only able to draw against an inexperienced Joe Kelly in Glasgow. He followed this with three overseas bouts against difficult opponents; Alain Limarola and Thierry Jacob of France and Guyanese bantamweight champion Michael Parris. He completed 1986 with a challenge for the vacant Welsh featherweight title, but was outclassed by Peter Harris of Swansea. The next year Smart fought twice, losing to Fabrice Benichou in the first round and then a career ending defeat by future British featherweight champion Sean Murphy.

Born in Bermondsey, London, he was shipped to Australia as a convicted felon in 1790. He learned his trade in Sydney, becoming joint owner of a merchant ship, Diana in 1799. He co- founded Kable & Underwood, along with Henry Kable which was a merchant trading company, and utilised Diana for seal hunting in the Bass Strait. As his enterprise expanded, Underwood added coal and sandalwood shipping to his business interests, increased the size of his fleet, and added Simeon Lord as a business partner. He continued to build ships, including a 200 tonne King George, and Casuarina bought by the French explorer Nicolas Baudin. He became one of the leading figures of the fledgling sealing industry in New South Wales, employing over sixty men and bringing 30,000 skins annually. He returned to London to sell over 120,000 skins, and with the proceeds bought out his partner, Lord. On return to New South Wales he founded a coffee lounge, helped found the Commercial Society of Sydney and also joined the Standing Committee of the Emancipated Colonists of New South Wales. He became a leading merchant, and \\"one of the few merchants engaged in importing from Europe and India\\". He built a distillery with two more business partners whom he subsequently bought out. The proceeds of his expanding businesses funded a homestead said to be among \\"the three or four finest in Sydney\\".

La Paz: Ediciones Masas, 2001. p. 437 The first issue of Bandera Roja appeared on June 8, 1926. It was linked to different trade unions. Along with Reque Lozano the newspaper was run by a group of intellectuals during its early phase. The people behind Bandera Roja included Óscar Cerruto, Rafael A. Reyeros, Carlos Mendoza Mamani (a tailor, leader of the Federación Obrera del Trabajo union) and Julio M. Ordoñez.Mesa, José de, Teresa Gisbert, and Carlos D. Mesa G. Historia de Bolivia. La Paz: Editorial Gisbert y Cia S.A., 2007. p. 421 Editorial line Seeking to reach the working class, the writers of the newspaper adopted vulgar and simplified discourses. It often used attention-grabbing graphics. Bandera Roja promoted the 8-hour working day and university autonomy. The publication was vehemently anti-clerical. It also promoted rights for the indigenous population. Whilst some of the material in Bandera Roja had an anarchist tint, Bandera Roja was the first Bolivian publication that identified itself with the Communist International. Some of the articles from Bandera Roja were reproduced in the Latin American organ of the Communist International, La Correspondencia Sudamericana.John, Steven Sándor.

Uncia miners' massacre In July 1926 Bandera Roja denounced a massacre of mine workers in Uncia.Torrico Landa, Gustavo, and Cristóbal Kolkichiuma P'ankara. La imprenta y el periodismo en Bolivia. La Paz: Fondo Ed. del los Diputados, 2004. p. 344 In response the government launched a crack-down against Bandera Roja. Its office was stormed. Two editors (Ordoñez and Reyeros) were arrested, whilst Reque Lozano, Mendoza Mamani and Cerruto went underground. The crack-down on Bandera Roja was criticized sharply in the mainstream press. FOT organ Towards the end of 1926 Bandera Roja shifted course. Reque sought to make the newspaper an organ of the trade union movement and a committee, which included FOT and other unions, was formed to support Bandera Roja. This move led to a break with the intellectuals. A new editorial team was formed after the split, which included Guillermo Gamarra (president of the Uncia Workers Federation). The newspaper became an organ of FOT.Rivadeneira Prada, Raúl. Bosquejos comunicacionales. La Paz, Bolivia: Ediciones Signo, 2003. p. 173 Closure In 1927 Bandera Roja dismissed government claims of a communist plot to seize power (which supposedly would have involved unions and the Labour Party).

Exhibit area Oi! building outside balcony Oi! is a Hong Kong government art promotion organisation. It was developed by the Leisure and Cultural Services Department, and aims to promote visual arts by providing a platform for art exhibitions, forums and other art-related activities. It is situated at 12 Oil Street, Fortress Hill, North Point, at the corner of Electric Road.  Buildings  The organisation is housed in a complex that comprises a main and two ancillary buildings. The complex was built in 1908 and served as the Royal Hong Kong Yacht Club headquarters and clubhouse until 1938. Built in the Arts and Crafts style, it was officially opened on 21 March 1908 by the then Governor, Sir Frederick Lugard. The site lost its initial waterfront location due to subsequent reclamation, and the Club headquarters moved to Kellett Island.Brief Information on Proposed Grade II Items. Item #321 After World War II, the buildings were used as a garage, government staff quarters and for storage by the Government Supplies Department. Until 1998, they were part of the larger Government Supplies Department compound that included the department's headquarters. From 1998 to early 2000, the buildings of the compound were leased out on a short-term basis. They attracted a number of creative teams to develop arts in the area and housed the Oil Street Artist Village (油街藝術村). The government finally evicted the tenants, citing their lack of permits or insurance. A number of artists relocated to the Cattle Depot Artist Village in 2001.\\"Uncatalogued: The Case of Oil Street Artist Village\\", Asia Art Archive press release, 8 May 2012.\\"Cattle Depot Artist Village\\", Government press release, April 22, 2009.

The game is loosely based on an ancient Swedish tradition called \\"Årsgång\\" (pronounced [oːʂgɔŋ]; \\"Year Walk\\").Kent, L., 2014. YEAR WALK MYTHS AND MONSTERS [online]. Available at: http://www.quadrapheme.com/year-walkmyths-and-monsters/ [accessed 09/07/14]. The game was ported to Windows and OS X PC platforms via Steam in 2014, and on the Wii U via eShop on September 17, 2015.  Plot  Year Walk begins with the protagonist Daniel Svensson visiting his lover, Stina, who hints that she has been proposed to, and warns the player about the dangers of year walking, implying that her cousin had died while engaging in the activity. Daniel returns home, and prepares to engage in the Year Walk anyway. As he proceeds toward the church (the object of year walking is to get to a church and see the future), the protagonist encounters a series of fairies and mythical creatures from Swedish folklore: the Huldra, the Brook Horse, Mylings, the Night Raven, and finally the Church Grim. In the end, the player succeeds in receiving glimpses of the future, in the form of ominous bits of conversation that are presumably from Stina. They then see a beautiful grassy meadow. When they venture right, they see Stina on the ground, her eyes closed. At first, she appears unharmed, but then blood seeps from her chest onto her clothes and the grass. If the player uses the hints given after the credits to access the Journal component of the PC Game/iOS companion app, they can discover the journal of Theodore Almsten, a modern-day man obsessed with Swedish folklore, as he investigates the meaning behind the year walk. Through his research, the full story is revealed. The fate of Almsten himself is also uncertain; his research seems to have taken a toll on his mental state, and his final entry takes place immediately before he goes on a Year Walk of his own. However, Almsten believes that the desire to Year Walk alone is enough to be punished for the Watchers, so it’s implied he met the same fate as Daniel Svennson. Ultimately clues from the Journal can be used in the game itself to reach an alternate ending, considered the ultimate ending (as it says \\"the end\\"). Daniel receives a knife along with a newspaper article from the future describing his execution for the murder of Stina, and a letter from Almsten telling him to do what must be done to save Stina. It is left ambiguous whether Daniel kills himself or uses the knife to facilitate the murder.  Development  Year Walk started out as a film script that writer Jonas Tarestad shared with developer Simon Flesser. The two considered turning the script into a game, according to Flesser, \\"almost jokingly to start with\\". However the two eventually grew serious about the prospect and changed the script so that it would better suit the medium. In the transition from movie script to game script, according to Flesser, they \\"basically rewrote everything about it\\" keeping only the beginning and ending the same. In designing the game Flesser studied horror movies, specifically the timing \\"to get the scary bits right\\". He has additionally cited the games Killer7, Fez and The Legend of Zelda series as well as the film Hedgehog in the Fog as inspiration. In collaboration with Dakko Dakko, the developers behind Scram Kitty and his Buddy on Rails, Simogo rebuilt the game from the ground up for release on Nintendo's Wii U console in 2015, taking advantage of the Wii U GamePad for various mechanics.  Reception  Year Walk received highly positive reviews from critics. Review aggregation website Metacritic provides an average rating of 87 out of 100 based on 32 reviews on iOS, 87 out of 100 based on 8 reviews on PC, and 82 out of 100 based on 12 reviews on Wii U, indicating \\"generally favorable reviews\\". 148 Apps gave it a highly positive review, praising nearly every aspect of the game. They gave it a score of 5 out of 5, and said that \\"Year Walk is a haunting adventure game from Simogo that blends a dark world and involved mythology together to create an absolutely amazing experience.\\" At the 2013 Unity Awards, Year Walk won the award for Best 2D Artistic Experience. Year Walk was included in Pocket Gamer's \\"top 10 best iPhone and iPad games of the year - 2013 edition\\" list. The game sold 200,000 copies in 2013.

The collection was confiscated by German tax authorities in 2012 on dubious grounds but eventually agreed to be returned to Gurlitt's possession in 2014, although this never happened in his lifetime. After the collection came to public attention in 2013, Gurlitt agreed that any items which could be identified as looted should be returned to surviving relatives of the persons from whom the items were originally stolen. In his will he bequeathed all his property, including the art collection, to the Museum of Fine Arts in Bern, Switzerland, which agreed to accept them minus any items of suspect provenance, which remain in Germany pending further investigation. Biography=Early life Gurlitt's parents were the art dealer and previous museum director Hildebrand Gurlitt and Helene Gurlett, née Hanke. He grew up in the Dammtor district of Hamburg with his sister Renate (later known as Benita), who was born there in 1935. After attending primary school in Hamburg, he went to secondary school in Dresden until the city was destroyed by allied bombing in 1945, when Gurlitt was 13. The family moved to rural Aschbach, then in 1946 Gurlitt and his sister were sent to the private Odenwaldschule at Heppenheim for a short period until he joined his family again, now settled in Düsseldorf, where he took his school leaving examination in 1953 at the age of 20.Hickley, 2015: pp. 132-136. Death of Gurlitt's father and aftermath Three years later, while Gurlitt was enrolled at Cologne University studying art history, his father Hildebrand was killed in a road accident, leaving to his wife Helene the custodianship of his extensive and valuable, but generally little known, private art collection. In 1961, Helene bought two small apartments in the Schwabing suburb of Munich, while Gurlitt moved to Austria, building himself a small house in Aigen, a relatively affluent suburb of Salzburg. His mother died in January 1968, after which time Gurlitt divided his time between one of the two fifth floor Munich apartments (which his sister had inherited) and his Salzburg house; he never married and lived alone for the next four decades, surrounded by the art collection he had inherited upon his mother's death. He lived modestly, drove an inexpensive Volkswagen car, and was a virtual recluse, maintaining as little contact with the outside world as possible, with the exception of regular visits from his sister Benita. In addition to possessing a German passport, he had taken out Austrian citizenship and was registered in that country for tax purposes. However, by the 2000s, his Salzburg house was becoming neglected and Gurlitt, whose health was failing, visited it less frequently, spending more of his time residing in the Munich apartment.Hickley, 2015: pp. 147-149. Since he had never had any other source of income, after exhaustion of any other money inherited from his mother, Gurlitt appears to have lived by selling the occasional painting from his father's collection, the proceeds being paid into an account in Zurich, Switzerland, to which Gurlitt would travel every four to six weeks and withdraw €9,000 to pay his living costs. The existence, quality and extent of the collection that he had inherited remained largely secret, unknown to his acquaintances and the public at large although according to one dealer was \\"common knowledge among dealers in southern Germany\\".Hickley, 2015: p. 150. Artworks discovery In September 2010 Gurlitt, then aged 77, was stopped on a train returning from Zurich to Munich and found to have €9,000 in his possession which he said came from selling some paintings he had had in his possession in 1978. The amount was below the legally allowed limit to be carried between countries in cash but aroused the suspicion of authorities that he might be involved in some sort of art fraud selling stolen artworks on the black market, on which he was paying no tax in Germany. German customs officials obtained a warrant to search his sister's Munich apartment where he was living and discovered 1,406 works of art initially reported as worth €1 billion (this figure was subsequently revised downwards to some tens of millions of euros, still a substantial sum). The collection included works by Renoir, Matisse, Otto Dix and many other famous artists. These works were all confiscated by officials of the Augsburg Prosecutor's office although the legality of that action was later challenged in court.Hickley, 2015: p. 188. Gurlitt had no lawyer at the time, and his repeated requests for the collection to be returned to him on the basis that he had committed no crime went unheeded. The Augsburg Prosecutor's investigation, meanwhile, proceeded very slowly and out of public sight until the find was leaked to the press and sensationally reported by the German magazine Focus on 3 November 2013. News of the discovery was reported worldwide. In December 2013 a local court in Munich appointed a German lawyer, Christoph Edel, to look after Gurlitt's affairs for the next six months, under a scheme which provides legal representation for old or infirm clients. Edel filed lawsuits first against unidentified officials who had leaked information on the discovery to the press, then on the Prosecutor's office for return of the collection, which, however, Gurlitt was never to see again. Gurlitt also revealed to Edel the existence of a second portion of the collection at his Salzburg house, which Edel took steps to secure and remove to a new location on Gurlitt's behalf; these items, more than 250 pieces including works by Monet, Renoir, Gauguin, Liebermann, Toulouse-Lautrec, Courbet, Cézanne, Munch and Manet, were never touched by the German authorities.Hickley, 2015: pp. 186-192 Initially, Gurlitt maintained that all of the works in his collection had been acquired legally by his father and that no suggestions that the collection contained looted art would be entertained. However, he subsequently agreed in 2014 that if indeed the collection did include looted items, he would return these to the rightful heirs of the families from which they had been stolen, thereby conforming to the (non binding) 1998 Washington Principles on Nazi-Confiscated Art, although he was under no legal obligation to do so: under German law, any claims to restitution of looted art would have expired after a 30-year period, long expired by 2010.Hickley, 2015: p. 192. Already in 2011, he had consigned one picture, Max Beckmann's \\"The Lion Tamer\\", for sale to the Cologne auction house Lempertz, where it was recognized by Mike Hulton, heir to a Jewish family from which the work had originally been stolen prior to World War II, although there was no suggestion that Hildebrand Gurlitt had any involvement in the original theft. Representatives of the gallery met with Cornelius and then negotiated an amicable settlement with Hulton to share the profits of the sale, the picture eventually selling for €864,000.Hickley, 2015: pp. 153-154. Death and subsequent events Following a number of years of ill health, Gurlitt died of heart failure on 6 May 2014 at the age of 81. The will he wrote shortly before his death unexpectedly named a small museum in Switzerland, the Museum of Fine Arts Bern (German: Kunstmuseum Bern), as his \\"sole heir\\". People close to Gurlitt told an American newspaper that he decided to give the collection to a foreign institution because he felt that Germany had treated him and his father badly. The legacy included the items that Gurlitt had kept in Munich and also in Salzburg, which German authorities had not confiscated because their remit did not extend to property held in Austria, plus his properties in the two locations, which the Bern Museum subsequently announced they would be selling in order to offset some of the costs associated with accepting the bequest. The will stipulated that the museum would be required to research the provenance of the paintings and make restitution as appropriate.Lane, p. A12. The museum decided to accept those works for which there is no suggestion that they represent the proceeds of Nazi-era looting, and entered into a joint agreement with German and Swiss authorities about the handling of this bequest. The will was challenged by one of Gurlitt's cousins based on a psychiatric report concluding that Gurlitt suffered from dementia, schizoid personality disorder, and a delusional disorder at the time he wrote his will. The challenge was defeated in court and the Bern bequest permitted to stand. Some of the artworks have been established as being previously looted and have been returned to the heirs of the legitimate owners, notably a portrait by Matisse restored to the heirs of French art dealer Paul Rosenberg. Another major painting from the collection, Two Riders on a Beach (1901), by Max Liebermann, was returned to the heirs of the German-Jewish industrialist and art collector David Friedmann,Eddy, Melissa (May 15, 2015). \\"Matisse From Gurlitt Collection Is Returned to Jewish Art Dealer’s Heirs\\".

Retrieved 2016-12-19. By late 2014, Carl Spitzweg's \\"Musical Pair\\" had also been identified for return to the relevant heir of the original owner. A small number of additional items have continued to be identified as looted and have been restituted to the original owners' heirs where known; for ongoing details see Gurlitt Collection#Works identified for return to original owners. Exhibitions of some of the works from the collection went on show in November 2017.

Signed in May 2012 by Fatah's President Mahmoud Abbas, and Hamas' leader Khaled Mashal, the objective of the agreement was the formation of an interim government in preparation for the elections for a new Palestinian government. However, the agreement soon fell apart, and steps of major reconciliation were not made until January 2013. Background The Israeli and Palestinian conflict began in 1948 when the state of Israel was established. Both sides are fighting over the same land and neither will simply give away the land, due to the land having deeper religious meaning for Palestinians and Israelis alike. Israel is currently in control of the land and have strict boundaries and rules for the Israelis to follow. Although Israel is in control, they cannot just drive the Palestinian people out of the land so they intend to drive them out by mistreating them, hoping they will flee the land. This is an ongoing battle for power and a resolution does not seem to be near. Both sides have come to many different agreements in the past, but they never seem to be met and the battle for power continues. Tensions between political parties Fatah and Hamas have gone on since 2007. Problems between the two parties have been numerous, but namely arguments have risen on how to deal with Israel. Hamas has written off any type of settlement with Israel, believing that it should not have a right to exist in the first place, while Fatah has agreed in the past to work with Israel. On February 8, 2007, Hamas and Fatah signed the Fatah–Hamas Mecca Agreement. In April 2011, they signed an agreement in Cairo, which intended to end the Fatah–Hamas conflict. On February 7, 2012, the parties signed the Doha agreement in the Qatari capital Doha, placing Abbas at the head of an interim government of independent technocrats charged with organizing elections later in 2012.Abbas to head Palestinian unity government. Al Jazeera, 7 February 2012New Palestinian government will respect PLO accords, Abbas says . AFP/Al Arabiya, 19 February 2012 The accord, however, failed on implementation. Other agreements that attempted to bridge peace between the two parties were the 2011 Cairo Agreement, the Fatah-Hamas Mecca Agreement, the 2012 Doha Agreement, and the 2014 Beach Refugee Camp Agreement. The Agreement On May 20, 2012, Hamas and Fatah signed another agreement in Cairo, this time to prepare for elections for the new united government of the West Bank and Gaza. The new agreement took steps to carry out the previous Fatah–Hamas Doha Agreement, including the registering of new voters in the Gaza Strip and the formation of an interim government from May 27.Palestinians Sign Deal to Set Up Elections. New York Times, 20 May 2012 Neither party was able to come to a compromise with each other's requests. Fatah's took issue with Hamas over the latter's power in the Gaza Strip, citing that Hamas should give up some of its control. Hamas, on the other hand, would not agree to compromise so long as Fatah continued to appease Israel. The agreement was put on hiatus until May 2012, due to both parties reaching a standstill. The negotiations over the agreement were terminated due to continued disagreements between the parties.

Young Pharoz is an Egyptian Rap, Hip- Hop and R&B; band founded in 2007. Members of the band write their own songs and simply express themselves in a way that arouses interest in the listeners especially that they talk about their lives in general, and about political and social issues brought in a sarcastic and comedic method. The band's most notable appearance was in 2013 when it made fourth place on the X Factor Arabia, ranked number one band. History Young Pharoz started in 2007 as an underground rap group that eventually developed into another shape with the inclusion of singer Shahd El Shaarawy in 2009. At that point, Young Pharoz consisted of four rappers (Mohamed Magdi, Ayman Seleha, Mohamed Hani and Hazem Alaa) and Shahd as a singer, the band played at many local gigs and talent shows searching for opportunities and seeking record labels' attention. In 2011, Hazem Alaa split from the group for personal reasons. The group continued to record underground tracks until Ayman Seleha went to France for college, thus making it harder to work on projects. In 2012, Mohamed 'Mesho' Magdi, Mohamed Hani and Shahd El Shaarawy recorded a remixed version of the song Mirror for rapper Lil Wayne which garnered a relatively adequate number of views on YouTube and which grabbed the attention of X Factor Arabia talent scouts. In early 2013 and before the band went to X Factor, Mohamed Hani split from the band also for personal reasons which lead to the band taking its final current form. Young Pharoz received an invitation from the X Factor Arabia to audition in Beirut for the 2013 season, leading to them being on the show in 2013, making it to the finals and signing a record deal with Sony Music International. The X Factor Young Pharoz auditioned for the X Factor Arabia in Beirut in front of renowned judges Hussain Al Jasmi, Wael Kfoury, Elissa and Carole Samaha who later became their mentor in the following rounds. In their audition, Young Pharoz remixed the song Invincible by American rapper Machine Gun Kelly who later recognized their version of the song on his Twitter account and Facebook page and praised the band's musical ability. Young Pharoz received 4 Yes's from the judging panel as well as many positive comments about their lyrical ability, Shahd's voice and the technique of their performance. The audition video's YouTube views rocketed to 100,000 views in a matter of hours and later gained more exposure from the international media. After the audition phase ended, the successful contestants were distributed into four categories: Solo Male Artists, Solo Female Artists, Artists Above 25 and Bands. Each judge was assigned a category to mentor making Carole Samaha in charge of bands, six out of the ten bands made it through to the next round: The Judges' Houses. In this round, Young Pharoz performed their own version of the hit Run This Town by American Rappers Jay-Z, Kanye West and Barbadian singer Rihanna in front of Carole Samaha and Egyptian superstar Ahmed Mekky. Of all the contestants that passed the auditions round, only 13 made it to the live shows, where crowd voting determines the elimination process. Young Pharoz continued to present their original versions of hit international songs throughout the live shows, making it to the semi-final phase, where they lost against Ibrahim Abdel Atheem who later became runner-up. Record Deal Sony Music Middle East approached the Young Pharoz with a record deal after they were knocked out of X Factor in the semi-final round, they signed a deal with Sony to record one studio album, release a single and a music video. The first single \\"Yalla Ben Ne3eesh\\" was released on June 16th 2014 in both Arabic and English (\\"Flying The Flag\\") supporting the FIFA World Cup 2014 and is written and produced by Swedish top songwriter Gustav Efraimsson (Snoop Dogg / New Kids On The Block / Backstreet Boys). The band is currently under the management of Sony Music Entertainment. Live Performances Young Pharoz have appeared in many live performances after X Factor, their first performance was in Porto Marina in the North Coast, Egypt where they performed in front of a large crowd alongside their fellow X Factor finalist Adham Nabulsi. Media Reception A remarkable fanbase for Young Pharoz going by the name of 'YPians' started to take shape after the X Factor auditions were broadcast. Young Pharoz were the feature of many news articles in Egypt and the Middle East, where they were perceived by viewers as a phenomenon that didn't before exist in the Arab media scene, due to the fact that they present their music in English and Arabic besides addressing issues that are popular within the Arab community, such as politics and social problems. Many fans started uploading versions of their X Factor performances and the view counts started to witness a significant rise reaching 500,000 views for one of the more popular songs.

Many of his haiku appear in English-language anthologies. He was born the second son of Tsuneichi Kinoshita in Miyuki, a village in the eastern part of Hiroshima Prefecture. On 22 July 1920 his father was killed at work; on 3 August 1922, his mother married Tsuneichi's brother, Itsu, a pharmacist. In 1932, Kinoshita began studying French literature at Waseda in Tokyo, but he was forced to switch to pharmacology in Nagoya in order to continue the family business, when his elder brother became a doctor. This unwelcome career change was cemented by the death on 15 September 1935 of his stepfather. Kinoshita disliked working as a pharmacist and is described by his family as a distant man who frequently undercharged his clients for the medicine he provided. He spent all of his spare time on his poems, of which 400 survive. They were published in ten collections. In July 1965 he wrote his last poem, \\"Gone So Long\\", commissioned by a newspaper for the 20th anniversary of the bombing of Hiroshima. He died a month later of colon cancer.

Two main approaches can be undertaken. In the first, the transport of the turbulent stresses is assumed proportional to the turbulent kinetic energy; while in the second, convective and diffusive effects are assumed to be negligible. Algebraic stress models can only be used where convective and diffusive fluxes are negligible, i.e. source dominated flows. In order to simplify the existing EASM and to achieve an efficient numerical implementation the underlying tensor basis plays an important role. The five-term tensor basis that is introduced here tries to combine an optimum of accuracy of the complete basis with the advantages of a pure 2d concept. Therefore a suitable five-term basis is identified. Based on that the new model is designed and validated in combination with different eddy-viscosity type background models.  Integrity basis In the frame work of single-point closures (Reynolds-stress transport models = RSTM) still provide the best representation of flow physics. Due to numeric requirements an explicit formulation based on a low number of tensors is desirable and was already introduced originally most explicit algebraic stress models are formulated using a 10-term basis: :b_{ij}= \\\\sum_{\\\\lambda=1}^{10} G^{(\\\\lambda)} T_{ij}^{(\\\\lambda)} The reduction of the tensor basis however requires an enormous mathematical effort, to transform the algebraic stress formulation for a given linear algebraic RSTM into a given tensor basis by keeping all important properties of the underlying model. This transformation can be applied to an arbitrary tensor basis. In the present investigations an optimum set of basis tensors and the corresponding coefficients is to be found. Projection method The projection method was introduced to enable an approximate solution of the algebraic transport equation of the Reynolds-stresses. In contrast to the approach of the tensor basis is not inserted in the algebraic equation, instead the algebraic equation is projected. Therefore, the chosen basis tensors does not need to form a complete integrity basis. However, the projection will fail if the basis tensor are linear dependent. In the case of a complete basis the projection leads to the same solution as the direct insertion, otherwise an approximate solution in the sense is obtained. An example In order to prove, that the projection method will lead to the same solution as the direct insertion, the EASM for two-dimensional flows is derived. In two-dimensional flows only the tensors are independent. : T_{ij}^{(1)}=s_{ij} : T_{ij}^{(2)}=s_{ik}w_{kj} - w_{ik}s_{kj} : T_{ij}^{(3)}=s_{ik}s_{kj}-s_{mk}s_{km}\\\\frac{1}{3} \\\\delta_{ij} The projection leads then to the same coefficients. This two-dimensional EASM is used as starting point for an optimized EASM which includes three-dimensional effects. For example the shear stress variation in a rotating pipe cannot be predicted with quadratic tensors. Hence, the EASM was extended with a cubic tensor. In order to do not affect the performance in 2D flows, a tensor was chosen that vanish in 2d flows. This offers the concentration of the coefficient determination in 3d flows. A cubic tensor, which vanishes in 3d flow is: : T_{ij}^{(5)}=w_{ik}s_{kl}s_{lj}-s_{ik}s_{kl}w_{lj} The projection with tensors T(1), T(2), T(3) and T(5) yields then the coefficients of the EASM. Limitation of Cμ A direct result of the EASM derivation is a variable formulation of Cμ.As the generators of the extended EASM where chosen to preserve the existing 2D formulation the expression of Cμ remains unchanged: : C \\\\mu = \\\\frac{-A_1 g}{g^2-\\\\frac{2}{3} A_3^2 \\\\eta _1 -2 A^2 \\\\eta _2} Ai are the constants of the underlying pressure-strain model. Since η1 is always positive it might be possible that Cμ becomes singular. Therefore in the first EASM derivation of a regularization was introduced, which prevent a singular by cutting the range of η1. However, Wallin et al. pointed out that the regularization deteriorated the performance of the EASM. In their model the methodology was refined to account for the coefficient. Velocity Profile : g=C_1 - 2 b_{ij} This leads to a weak non-linear conditional equation for the EASM coefficients and an additional equation for g must be solved. In 3D the equation of g is of 6th order, wherefore a closed solution is only possible in 2D flows, where the equation reduces to 3rd order. In order to circumvent the root finding of a polynomial equation quasi self-consistent approach. He showed that by using a Cμ expression of a realizable linear model instead of the EASM-Cμ expression in the equation of g the same properties of g follows. For a wide range of and the quasi self-consistent approach is almost identical to the fully self-consistent solution. Thus the quality of the EASM is not affected with the advantage of no additional non-linear equation. Since in the projections to determine the EASM coefficients the complexity is reduced by neglecting higher order invariants.

It was designed by Philip C. Kendall, PhD, ABPP, and colleagues at the Child and Adolescent Anxiety Disorders Clinic at Temple University. A related program called C.A.T. Project is aimed at adolescents aged 14 to 17. See publishers webpage [www.WorkbookPublishing.com] The goals of the treatment are three-fold: * the child learns to recognize, experience, and cope with anxiety * the child learns to manage their level of anxiety * the child learns to master developmentally appropriate, challenging, and difficult tasks Application In 16 individual therapy program is divided into two parts: The first eight sessions are the training segment, and the second eight sessions are the practice (exposure tasks) segment). Sessions last approximately 50 minutes. In addition, two sessions between the therapist and the parent(s)/guardian(s) are scheduled at session 4 and session 9. While the therapist follows a treatment manual, the youth uses the Coping cat workbook to guide completion of the exercises and to aid involvement and skill acquisition. The therapist and youth together create a personalized FEAR plan for the youth to use in anxiety-provoking situations. FEAR stands for Feeling frightened?; Expecting bad things to happen?; Actions and attitudes that can help?; Results and rewards. Youth are also given homework, referred to as a STIC (Show That I Can) task. Evidence Coping Cat is a \\"well supported\\" intervention for treating separation anxiety disorder, social anxiety disorder, and generalized anxiety disorder. Based on the numerous rigorous research evaluations, the program has met the criteria for an \\"empirically supported treatment\\". The program has been evaluated in several randomized clinical trials with one-year follow-up data conducted both in the United States, Norway, and in Australia. The outcomes have been very favorable, with 3.35 year-follow-up of one study and 7.4 year follow-up of the second study providing evidence of the maintenance gains. One trial comparing the effects of Coping Cat, sertraline, and their combination, demonstrated that youths who received the combination of Coping Cat and medication received the most benefits, and both Coping Cat and sertraline alone resulted in significant improvements that were also greater than a pill placebo. Coping Cat has also been found to be effective in treating children with anxiety with high- function autism spectrum disorder. Versions * Adolescents: The C.A.T.

He is best known for creating the international network of offices which made Burson-Marsteller the world's largest public relations firm in the 1980s, where he eventually rose to be International chairman. Debrett's have recognised him as one of Britain's 500 most influential people.  Early life  Leaf was born in New York City on August 9, 1931. He attended Stuyvesant High School in Manhattan.  Education  After high school Leaf enrolled in the School of Journalism at the University of Missouri, the world's first school of journalism. Initially he was interested in pursuing a career in sports journalism, but after attending classes in advertising and public relations he decided that was where his future lay. At college, Leaf also developed a keen interest in history and international relations and, after receiving his bachelor of journalism degree with honors in 1952, he received an MA with honors in history in 1954.  The Army  After graduation, Leaf served in the US Army for two years. After boot camp he was posted to army headquarters at Orléans, France as an information and education specialist, who lectured to the troops. Among his subjects were the different cultural attitudes they would encounter while stationed overseas, and how best to get on with the British, French and Germans.  Burson-Marsteller  Leaf moved back to the United States in 1956 and went to live with his widowed mother in New York, while searching for a job. For a short while he worked for a show business publicist where his main clients included Milton Berle, who helped start television in the United States, Tony Bennett and Pearl Bailey. He then obtained an interview with a small PR firm called Burson-Marsteller which was looking for its first trainee, and got the job. He joined Burson- Marsteller on July 1, 1957, alongside its then six executives. The business grew rapidly and soon Leaf was promoted and given assistants, one of whom was Mary Travers – soon far better known as the Mary in the vocal group Peter, Paul and Mary. Harold Burson had also been stationed overseas in the army and felt that it offered great opportunities for the firm to represent American clients there. He appointed Leaf head of international operations and, in 1965, he was sent to Brussels on a one-year assignment. Three years later he was transferred to London, where he still resides.  Overseas growth  Credited as \\"the father of public relations\\", Leaf went on to create a global network of offices which helped Burson-Marsteller become the world's biggest PR firm during his tenure. After giving a speech in Moscow, B-M was hired by Vneshtorgreklama, the Russian state advertising agency during the Cold War, and helped set up the first PR firm in the Soviet Union. Leaf also signed a partnership agreement with the Chinese government in the Great Hall of the People to establish the first official Chinese Government PR firm. He launched the first international PR firm in the Middle East and started Burson- Marsteller offices throughout Europe, Asia, South America and Australia. In 1997, after 40 years with Burson-Marsteller, he stood down as their International chairman and established his own firm, Robert S. Leaf Consultants, which is based in the Burson-Marsteller building in London. He still advises Burson-Marsteller. Awards In 2000, Leaf was given the Chartered Institute of Public Relations first ever 'Alan Campbell Award', for outstanding contributions to international public relations and, in 2011, he received journalism's highest award Missouri Honor Medal for Distinguished Service to Journalism from his alma mater, the University of Missouri. Previous recipients include Tom Brokaw, Walter Cronkite, George Gallup and Sir Winston Churchill. He is listed in Who's Who in America, Who's Who in the World, Debrett's People of Today. In January 2014, he was included in 'The Debrett's 500', a list of people considered by them as Britain's 500 most influential people. Books In 2012, Leaf published his memoirs, The Art of Perception. It was described in The Reality Gap as: Since the publication of the book, Leaf has been spending his time talking at conferences and lecturing at leading business and journalism schools in the UK and the US. He is also a founder of the Public Relations Consultants Association. Personal life While still working at B-M's New York office Leaf received a phone call from Adele Ornstein, who had been a fellow student at Joan of Arc Junior High School in New York whom he had not seen in 12 years but hadn't forgotten, so they started dating. They were married in June 1958, their son, Stuart, was born in 1961 and they have two grandchildren.  References External links * PR Week Profile * Robert S.

In this essay Descartes uses various models to understand the properties of light. This essay is known as Descartes' greatest contribution to optics, as it is the first publication of the Law of Refraction. First Discourse: On Light Page of Descartes' \\"La dioptrique\\" with the wine vat example. The first discourse captures Descartes' theories on the nature of light. In the first model, he compares light to a stick that allows a blind person to discern his environment through touch. Descartes says: :You have only to consider that the differences which a blind man notes among trees, rocks, water, and similar things through the medium of his stick do not seem less to him than those among red, yellow, green, and all the other colors seem to us; and that nevertheless these differences are nothing other, in all these bodies, than the diverse ways of moving, or of resisting the movements of, this stick. Descartes' second model on light uses his theory of the elements to demonstrate the rectilinear transmission of light as well as the movement of light through solid objects. He uses a metaphor of wine flowing through a vat of grapes, then exiting through a hole at the bottom of the vat. :Now consider that, since there is no vacuum in Nature as almost all the Philosophers affirm, and since there are nevertheless many pores in all the bodies that we perceive around us, as experiment can show quite clearly, it is necessary that these pores be filled with some very subtle and very fluid material, extending without interruption from the stars and planets to us. Thus, this subtle material being compared with the wine in that vat, and the less fluid or heavier parts, of the air as well as of other transparent bodies, being compared with the bunches of grapes which are mixed in, you will easily understand the following: Just as the parts of this wine...tend to go down in a straight line through the hole [and other holes in the bottom of the vat]...at the very instant that it is open...without any of those actions being impeded by the others, nor by the resistance of the bunches of grapes in this vat...in the same way, all of the parts of the subtle material, which are touched by the side of the sun that faces us, tend in a straight line towards our eyes at the very instant that we open them, without these parts impeding each other, and even without their being impeded by the heavier particles of transparent bodies which are between the two. Second Discourse: On Refraction Page of Descartes' \\"La dioptrique\\" with the tennis ball example. Descartes uses a tennis ball to create a proof for the laws of reflection and refraction in his third model. This was important because he was using real- world objects (in this case, a tennis ball) to construct mathematical theory. Descartes' third model creates a mathematical equation for the Law of Refraction, characterized by the angle of incidence equalling the angle of refraction. In today's notation, the law of refraction states, :: sin i = n sin r, where i is the angle of incidence, r is the angle of refraction, and n is the index of refraction. Using a tennis ball, Descartes would compare the projection of a ray of light to the way a ball moves when it is thrown up against another object. Controversy The astronomer Jean-Baptiste Morin was noted as one of the first people to question Descartes' method in creating his theories. :...Descartes would not accept Morin's objections that the demonstrations in the Dioptric are circular or that the proposed explanations are artificial. He grants that 'to prove some effects by a certain cause, then to prove this cause by the same effects', is arguing in a circle; but he would not admit that it is circular to explain some effects by a cause, and then to prove that the cause by the same effects, 'for there is a great difference between proving and explaining'. Descartes points out that he used the word 'demonstration'...to mean either one or the other 'in accordance with common usage, and not in the particular sense given to it by Philosophers'. Then he adds: 'it is not a circle to prove a cause by several effects which are known otherwise, then reciprocally to prove some other effects by this cause'.

Biography  Born Constant Georges Gasté on 30, 1869 at 3, rue du Gindre in the 6th borough of Paris, he was born into a great painting family. His father, Henry Gasté (1845-1871), a native of Laval, was an art dealer, and was the son of Pierre Gasté (1820-1884) (Georges Gasté's grandfather) who is also an art dealer himself. He received his early art education at the Atelier Colarossi and at age 18 he enrolled at the Ecole des Beaux Arts at the Alexandre Cabanel Studio. On a visit to Morocco, Algeria and Palestine in 1892, he marvelled at the quality of light her observed there. After this, he made the conscious decision to become an Orientalist artist. In 1893, the French Orientalist, Nasreddine Dinet noticed his work and invited him to stay at Bou Saâda in southern Algeria, where Dinet and a small group of French painters had set up an artists' colony. Fascinated by the local inhabitants, he found inspiration for his paintings, producing many portraits of them. For five years, between 1892 and 1898, he travelled across North Africa, visiting Algeria and Egypt. In 1907 he settled in Cairo. During this period, he rarely returned to his native France. de Tocqueville, A., Georges Gasté: Traquer le soleil dans l’ombre, p. 25. Eager to discover new horizons, Gasté sailed for India, which for him became a new source of inspiration for his paintings. In 1905, he settled in settled in Agra, the city of the Taj Mahal, in northern India. During this period, he travelled to Venice and then to Constantinople, before returning to India in 1907 and settling in Madurai. India was a major source of inspiration and there he took many photographs and executed many paintings and watercolours. This was to be the most productive period of his career. de Tocqueville, A., \\"Beyond Orientalism,\\" The Indian Quarterly, Online: http://indianquarterly.com/beyond-orientalism In 1907, he was appointed as the official correspondent of the Orientalist Painters’ Society in India. In 1909, he was given rare permission to spend six months inside the great temple of Madurai. From this privilege, he produced several works, including: Le Bain des Brahmines, now in the collection of the Orsay Museum. He became known as the painter of India. He died, at his studio in Madurai, India from an illness on 12th of September, 1910.

The bills were part of a Republican strategy to fund portions of the government which have bipartisan support, in order to spare those agencies and programs from the effects of the shutdown. The bills all passed the United States House of Representatives during the 113th United States Congress, but (with one exception) were ignored by the United States Senate. These selective continuing resolutions became moot upon the passage of the Continuing Appropriations Act, 2014 which funded the entire government, ending the shutdown. On October 1, 2013, the federal government shut down due to a failure of the United States Congress to pass any appropriation legislation – regular or in the form of a continuing resolution – in order to fund the government in fiscal year 2014. In reaction to this shutdown, the Republican- led House of Representatives began introducing and passing a series of mini- continuing resolutions that would continue to fund smaller pieces of the government. The Senate adjourned on October 7, 2013 with no solid plans to vote on any of the mini continuing resolutions on October 8, 2013. This was consistent with previous statements that the Senate would ignore the \\"piecemeal\\" or \\"mini\\" spending bills that were passed by the House. President Obama released a statement that if he were presented with H.J.Res. 77, he would veto the bill. The statement indicated that the president would veto all mini-appropriations bills because \\"consideration of appropriations bills in this fashion is not a serious or responsible way to run the United States Government.\\" As a result, chances of the bill becoming law were considered to be \\"slim to none.\\" Background Congress annually considers several appropriations measures, which provide funding for numerous activities. Appropriations measures are under the jurisdiction of the House and Senate Appropriations Committees. In recent years these measures have provided approximately 35% to 39% of total federal spending, with the remainder comprising mandatory spending and net interest on the public debt. If regular bills are not enacted by the beginning of the new fiscal year on October 1, Congress adopts continuing resolutions to continue funding, generally until regular bills are enacted. Fiscal year 2014 in the United States began on October 1, 2013. At that time, the government shutdown because no money had been appropriated to continue funding the government. Congress had not passed any of the introduced regular appropriation bills from earlier in 2013. In late September 2013, when it became clear that a shutdown was imminent, Congress began working on a continuing resolution, Continuing Appropriations Resolution, 2014 (H.J.Res 59), that would temporarily fund the government. The bill was passed by the House of Representatives on September 20, 2013. It would have funded the government until December 15, 2013, but also included measures to delay the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, commonly known as Obamacare. The Senate stripped the bill of the measures related to the Affordable Care Act, and passed it in revised form on Friday, September 27, 2013. The House put similar measures back and passed it again in the early morning hours on Sunday, September 29. The Senate refused to pass the bill while it still had measures to delay the Affordable Care Act, and the two sides could not develop a compromise bill by midnight on Monday, September 30, 2013, causing the federal government to shut down due to a lack of appropriated funds. After the shutdown, the House and the Senate both continued to work on legislation that would restore funding to the government. House Republicans began writing \\"mini-appropriation\\" bills – continuing resolutions that would fund smaller pieces of the government. Provisions in general This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the Congressional Research Service, a public domain source. Each bill would require the rate of operations for each such account to be calculated to reflect the full amount of any reduction required in FY2013 pursuant to: (1) the Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2013, and (2) the presidential sequestration order dated March 1, 2013, except as attributable to budget authority made available by the Disaster Relief Appropriations Act, 2013 (P.L. 113-2). They would also make appropriations and funds made available and authority granted under this joint resolution available until whichever of the following first occurs: (1) enactment into law of an appropriation for any project or activity provided for in this joint resolution, (2) enactment into law of the applicable appropriations Act for FY2014 without any provision for such project or activity, or (3) December 15, 2013. The bills would require implementation of this joint resolution so that only the most limited funding action be taken in order to provide for continuation of projects and activities. The bills would authorize amounts made available for civilian personnel compensation and benefits in each agency to be apportioned up to the rate for operations necessary to avoid furloughs in such agencies, consistent with the applicable appropriations Act for FY2013, except that such authority shall not be used until after the agency has taken all necessary actions to reduce or defer non-personnel-related administrative expenses. Commentary On October 7, 2013, conservative columnist Jim Geraghty of National Review Online accused Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid of sadism for refusing to bring H.J.Res. 85 and several other mini-continuing resolutions to the Senate floor for a vote, saying that \\"Harry Reid doesn't want to minimize the pain of the shutdown. He wants to maximize it.\\" Geraghty argued that if Harry Reid did bring these bills to the Senate floor, they would pass. Speaking in favor of the bill, House Appropriations Chairman Hal Rogers said that \\"the nine bills the House has passed since Oct. 1 to reopen the government — this will be the tenth — constitute nearly one-third of the federal government's discretionary budget.\\" So, he asked, \\"why are these bills still sitting on Harry Reid's desk? Why is the Senate not making every stride they can to help our nation's disadvantaged children, hungry families and our veterans?\\" Democrats responded by repeating their demands that the House pass a \\"clean\\" continuing resolution. Dan Uffner, writing at the American Thinker accused the Democrats of being the ones continuing the shutdown by listing all of the mini-appropriation bills passed by the House Republicans, including this one, and indicating the lack of action taken by the Senate Democrats. The bills=National Park Service Operations and Capital Museums The National Park Service Operations, Smithsonian Institution, National Gallery of Art, and United States Holocaust Memorial Museum Continuing Appropriations Resolution, 2014 () would provide funding for the National Park Service, which is the United States federal agency that manages all national parks, many national monuments, and other conservation and historical properties. It would also provide funding for the Smithsonian Institution, a group of museums and research centers, and other major museums affected by the shutdown. The bill would make appropriations for FY2014 for continuing projects or activities that were conducted in FY2013 and for which appropriations, funds, or other authority were made available by the Full-Year Continuing Appropriations Act, 2013 (division F of P.L. 113-6) under the following headings:This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the Congressional Research Service, a public domain source. :*\\"Department of the Interior--National Park Service--Operation of the National Park System,\\" :*\\"United States Holocaust Memorial Museum--Holocaust Memorial Museum,\\" :*\\"Smithsonian Institution,\\" and :*\\"National Gallery of Art.\\" All 401 units of the National Park System have been closed to the public since the shutdown began, as Congress has not appropriated funding for their operations and maintenance. If H.J.Res. 70 were to pass, it would fund the operation and maintenance of these parks. Some conservative pundits, including Reince Priebus chair of the RNC, and some Republican lawmakers, including U.S. Senator Ted Cruz, have charged that some of the closures are unnecessary and being overzealously enforced at the behest of the Obama administration.http://www.yourhoustonnews.com/deer_park/opinion/cruz-reid-and- obama-trying-to-make-shutdown-as- painful/article_edf41a50-4fd7-5321-adeb-5f88b010a7fc.htmlhttps://abcnews.go.com/blogs/politics/2013/10/is- shutdown-the-new-normal-the- note/http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2013/oct/6/national-park-rangers- ordered-to-keep-visitors-out/ The National Park Service has responded that it is legally mandated to protect national park lands and, in the absence of available staff to patrol, maintain and administer the areas, must close them to the public. The vast majority of the agency's staff have been furloughed, leaving only a limited number of law enforcement rangers and firefighters on duty to protect life and property.NATIONAL PARK SERVICE CONTINGENCY PLAN , National Park Service Richard Seamon, a law professor at the University of Idaho and former assistant solicitor general, told the Christian Science Monitor that the NPS risked vandalism, crime and legal liability if it left its properties open to the public during the shutdown. \\"If I were a lawyer for the Park Service, I'd advise it in no uncertain terms to close the parks to the public during the government shutdown, because it would be irresponsible to do otherwise. There are bound to be accidents or crimes that would have been avoided or ameliorated had officials been on duty to respond or patrol.\\" Leaving the parks open, he said, \\"would be a veritable open season for criminals.\\"Government shutdown: Do national parks really need to be barricaded?, Patrik Jonsson, The Christian Science Monitor, October 3, 2013 A number of privately operated enterprises, such as the Claude Moore Colonial Farm, have also been required to close because they operate on or within National Park Service property that has been closed to the public. Various concession-operated visitor amenities have also been closed because the NPS staff who oversee concessionaires have been furloughed, preventing the agency from managing and directing concession operations. Pisgah Inn, a private business on the Blue Ridge Parkway which operates under a concession agreement with the NPS, attempted to defy the closure order. On Oct 4, park rangers blocked the entrance to the inn and turned away visitors. On the first day of the shutdown, a large group of World War II veterans participating in an Honor Flight trip from Mississippi to the National World War II Memorial ignored the closure by the National Park Service and entered the memorial, alongside members of Congress of both political parties. The National Park Service declared that the gathering was protected by the First Amendment and rangers allowed the veterans to enter. The memorial is normally open to the public and patrolled by the U.S. Park Police 24 hours daily, and staffed by interpretive park rangers from 9:30 a.m. to 11:30 p.m.Operating Hours & Seasons – World War II Memorial – National Park Service, National Park Service District of Columbia The District of Columbia Continuing Appropriations Resolution, 2014 () would provide funding for Washington, D.C., which has only limited autonomy from the federal government. The bill would allow the District of Columbia to expend local funds under the heading \\"District of Columbia Funds\\" for such programs and activities under title IV of H.R. 2786 (113th Congress), as reported by the Committee on Appropriations of the House of Representatives, at the rate set forth under \\"District of Columbia Funds-- Summary of Expenses\\" as included in the Fiscal Year 2014 Budget Request Act of 2013 (D.C. Act 20-127), as modified as of the date of the enactment of this joint resolution.This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the Congressional Research Service, a public domain source.' ' October 9, 2013, District Mayor Vincent C. Gray begged Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, \\"Sir, we are not a department of the government. We're simply trying to be able to spend our own money.\\". Reid replied \\"I'm on your side. Don't screw it up, okay? Don't screw it up.\\".Wash.Post: Gray confronts Reid Veterans Benefits The Veterans Benefits Continuing Appropriations Resolution, 2014 () would provide funds for the United States Department of Veterans Affairs for \\"veterans disability payments, the GI Bill, education training, and VA home loans under the same conditions as in effect at the end of the just completed fiscal year.\\" The bill would make appropriations for FY2014 for veterans' benefits, specifically for entitlements and other mandatory payments whose budget authority was provided in the Military Construction and Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2013 (division E of P.L. 113-6), to continue activities at the rate to maintain program levels under current law, under the authority and conditions provided in the applicable appropriations Act for FY2013, to be continued through December 15, 2013. The bill would allow obligations for mandatory payments due on or about the first day of any month that begins after October 2013 but not later than 30 days after December 15, 2013, to continue to be made and makes funds available for such payments.This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the Congressional Research Service, a public domain source. The bill would provide amounts for \\"Department of Veterans Affairs--Departmental Administration--General Operating Expenses, Veterans Benefits Administration\\" at a specified rate for operations, subject to the authority and conditions as provided under P.L. 113-6, and would make them available to the extent and in the manner that would be provided by such Act. Rep. Culberson argued in favor of the bill by that saying that it was necessary \\"to ensure that veterans their survivors receive disability compensation benefits,\\" \\"to make sure that 517,000 low-income veterans and their family members receive their pensions,\\" and \\"so that three-quarters of a million students will receive their post-9/11 GI education benefits.\\" Democrats argued against passing any bill that doesn't fully fund the entire government. Prior to a vote on H.J.Res. 72, House Democrats tried to force a vote on the Senate-passed continuing resolution but failed to do so. National Guard and reserve forces The Pay Our Guard and Reserve Act () would provide funding for the \\"reserve components of the Armed Forces\\", a list which is defined as including the Army National Guard of the United States, the Army Reserve, the Navy Reserve, the Marine Corps Reserve, the Air National Guard of the United States, the Air Force Reserve, and the Coast Guard Reserve. The funding would cover \\"pay and allowances (for) reserve members of the military who participate in inactive-duty training during fiscal year 2014.\\" The Congressional Budget Office reported the bill would result in a budget authority of $5.0 billion. Due to the Pay Our Military Act and other laws related to the shutdown, most of the Pentagon's 800,000 civilian workers and the American military's 1.3 million active-duty soldiers will get paid during the shutdown, but the 800,000 Guardsmen and reservists won't, unless a bill such as the Pay Our Guard and Reserve Act is passed. The bill would make appropriations for FY2014, for any period during which interim or full-year appropriations for FY2014 are not in effect, for pay and allowances to members of the reserve components of the Armed Forces who perform inactive-duty training during FY2014.This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the Congressional Research Service, a public domain source.

Republicans argued that the Pay Our Guard and Reserve Act was necessary to correct an oversight in the Pay Our Military Act that was signed into law by President Obama on September 30, 2013. The bill would fund the military in the event that the federal government was shut down, as it was later that night. Some Republicans argued that it was not an oversight, but an incorrect interpretation of the law by the Department of Defense that was the problem. Representative Candice Miller (R-MI) said that \\"Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel has improperly furloughed countless Guardsmen and women across the country, in violation of the intent of law.\\" The Pay Our Military Act only covered pay and allowances for full-time active duty National Guard and reserve members. Republicans argued that the Pay Our Guard and Reserve Act was a bill that the two sides could cooperate on easily. Speaker of the House John Boehner pointed to the quick passage of the Pay Our Military Act only hours before the shutdown as an example of cooperation between Democrats and Republicans on an important issue. The act ensured that members of the military would still be paid if the federal government shut down. Boehner argued that because this was possible once, \\"we should have no trouble coming together and extending the same relief to our National Guard and Reserves. These men and women make incredible sacrifices for our country, and they and their families deserve this certainty and fairness. The Senate should send this bill to the president's desk immediately.\\" Representative Martha Roby (R-AL) agreed, saying that \\"we showed with the Pay Our Military Act that there were some things too important to let politics get in the way of funding. The financial security of our military families certainly is one. But isn't funding for veterans' services one, too? How about paying our national guardsmen and reservists, or making sure we have enough federal disaster funding?\\" Democrats remained opposed to the bill, favoring a clean continuing resolution instead. Democrats, such as Rep. Pete Visclosky (D-IN) argued against the bill because \\"Congress still hasn't dealt with issues like military maintenance and procurement, research and development, and other important issues that would be covered by a full appropriations bill.\\" In Indiana, Governor Mike Pence announced that \\"On that first day of the federal shutdown, I ordered the Indiana National Guard to continue paying the 244 federally-reimbursed employees who provide support to the Guard,\\" because \\"I consider the cost of approximately $33,000 a day a small price to pay for ensuring Indiana is prepared to handle any emergency.\\" On June 11, 2014, the United States Senate passed H.R. 3230 after changing the name to the Veterans' Access to Care through Choice, Accountability, and Transparency Act of 2014 and completely amending the text. It was used as a legislative vehicle for the new bill. National Institutes of Health The National Institutes of Health Continuing Appropriations Resolution, 2014 () would provide funding for the National Institutes of Health, the primary agency of the United States government responsible for biomedical and health-related research. The bill would appropriate, out of any money in the Treasury not otherwise appropriated, and out of applicable corporate or other revenues, receipts, and funds, for the National Institutes of Health (NIH) for FY2014, and for other purposes, such amounts as may be necessary, at a rate for operations as provided in the Full-Year Continuing Appropriations Act, 2013 (division F of P.L. 113-6), for continuing projects or activities (including the costs of direct loans and loan guarantees) not otherwise specifically provided for in this joint resolution, that were conducted in FY2013, and for which appropriations, funds, or other authority were made available by such Act to the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) for NIH under the heading \\"Department of Health and Human Services--National Institutes of Health.\\"This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the Congressional Research Service, a public domain source. Republicans criticized Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid for being opposed to passing the bill, which would, among other things, fund programs supporting sick children. Reid, upon being asked if he \\"would support NIH funding to help even one child with cancer,\\" said \\"Why would we want to do that?\\" In response, Democrats criticized Republicans for playing different needy groups off one another by funding bills to support cancer treatment while failing to fund food programs. Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children The Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children Continuing Appropriations Resolution, 2014 () would provide funding for the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children, a federal assistance program of the Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) of the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) for healthcare and nutrition of low-income pregnant women, breastfeeding women, and infants and children under the age of five. The bill would make appropriations, out of any money in the Treasury not otherwise appropriated, and out of applicable corporate or other revenues, receipts, and funds, for the Department of Agriculture (USDA) for FY2014, and for other purposes, such amounts as may be necessary, at a rate for operations as provided in the Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2013 (division A of P.L. 113-6), for continuing projects or activities (including the costs of direct loans and loan guarantees) that are not otherwise specifically provided for in this joint resolution, that were conducted in FY2013, and for which appropriations, funds, or other authority were made available by such Act under the heading \\"Department of Agriculture--Domestic Food Programs--Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC).\\"This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the Congressional Research Service, a public domain source. Republicans argued in favor of the bill, with Rep. Robert Aderholf saying that \\"the WIC bill is the answer to Democratic complaints that the shutdown is threatening the nutrition of 8.7 million women, infants and children.\\" Democrats argued that this bill did not go far enough because it failed to also fund food stamps. Although 22 Democrats did vote in favor of the bill in the House, most congressional Democrats continued to oppose the piecemeal funding of the government using mini-continuing resolutions, instead favoring the passage of a full continuing resolution. Food and Drug Administration The Food and Drug Administration Continuing Appropriations Resolution, 2014 () would provide funding for the Food and Drug Administration at the annual rate of $2.3 billion, the same funding it received in FY 2013. The bill funding provided by the bill would enable the FDA to \\"keep the FDA's important food and drug safety functions in place and also allow it to collect and spend user fees, which help the agency make approval or denial decision on new drugs and devices.\\" The bill would make appropriations, out of any money in the Treasury not otherwise appropriated, and out of applicable corporate or other revenues, receipts, and funds, for the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for FY2014, and for other purposes, such amounts as may be necessary, at a rate for operations as provided in the Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2013 (division A of P.L. 113-6), for continuing projects or activities (including the costs of direct loans and loan guarantees) that are not otherwise specifically provided for in this joint resolution, that were conducted in FY2013, and for which appropriations, funds, or other authority were made available by such Act to the United States Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) under the heading \\"Department of Health and Human Services--Food and Drug Administration.\\"This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the Congressional Research Service, a public domain source. A week before the shutdown, the FDA was preparing contingency plans in case of a shutdown. One concern was whether the agency would go ahead with ongoing drug reviews and advisory committee meetings, or if those meetings would be postponed. Approximately 45% of the FDA's 14,779 employees will be furloughed. The FDA will stop routine food safety inspections as well as most of its laboratory research. Employees will still handle emergencies and high-risk product recalls. The FDA posted a full list of \\"Medical Product Activities During the Federal Government Shutdown\\" with more details on their website. Due to the shutdown, the FDA quit routine inspections of \\"food manufacturers, warehouses, packers, distributors and other key links in the food production chain,\\" whereas it would normally average 200 a week. The furloughed workers were also responsible for many tasks that involved catching issues or illnesses early, so only small crews are now monitoring consumer complaint databases or monitoring long-term threats. Some FDA staff members are still conducting inspections at U.S. ports. Republicans argued in favor of the strategy of mini-continuing resolutions as a way to find points of agreement between the two parties in order to fund at least some of the government. Rep. Aderholt argued that Congress should pass the bill because \\"we need to also limit any damage to the millions of jobs impacted by FDA's work in the food and bio- science industries.\\" Democrats continued to insist of having a full continuing resolution that would fund the whole government and accused the Republicans of holding the government hostage. However, 20 House Democrats did vote in favor of the bill. The Editorial Board of The New York Times wrote an op-ed expressing concern over the furlough of many FDA employees, raising the issue that many of the furloughed employees worked on long-term threat assessment issues that weren't considered essential in the short-run. The board's opinion was that \\"the longer Congressional Republicans allow the shutdown to continue, the greater the danger of harm\\". Head Start The Head Start Continuing Appropriations Resolution, 2014 () would provide funding for the Head Start Program, a program of the United States Department of Health and Human Services that provides comprehensive education, health, nutrition, and parent involvement services to low-income children and their families. The program's services and resources are designed to foster stable family relationships, enhance children's physical and emotional well-being, and establish an environment to develop strong cognitive skills. The program would received funding at a pace of $7.586 billion a year, but only through December 15, when the continuing resolution would expire. The bill would provide funding for the Head Start Program, a program of the United States Department of Health and Human Services that provides comprehensive education, health, nutrition, and parent involvement services to low-income children and their families. The program would received funding at a pace of $7.586 billion a year, but only through December 15, when the continuing resolution would expire. The Head Start Continuing Appropriations Resolution, 2014 would make appropriations, out of any money in the Treasury not otherwise appropriated, and out of applicable corporate or other revenues, receipts, and funds, for the Head Start program for FY2014, and for other purposes, such amounts as may be necessary, at a rate for operations as provided in the Full-Year Continuing Appropriations Act, 2013 (division F of P.L. 113-6), for continuing all projects or activities under the Head Start Act (including the costs of direct loans and loan guarantees) that are not otherwise specifically provided for in this joint resolution, that were conducted in FY2013, and for which appropriations, funds, or other authority were made available to the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) by such Act under the heading \\"Department of Health and Human Services--Administration for Children and Families, Children and Families Services Programs.\\" On October 8, 2013, John D. Arnold and his wife Laura donated $10 million to the National Head Start Association in response to the continuing government shutdown. Their donation will help pay for programs in Alabama, Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, South Carolina, and Mississippi, the six states that have either already closed or are about to due to lack of funds. The programs in these six state serve 7,200 children. On November 1, programs in 41 other states and one US territory that serve 86,000 children will also run out of money. If funding is restored, the money will be repaid to the Arnolds as though it was a no-interest loan. The shutdown also affected many Native American tribes; Head Start programs for American Indian children were among those programs. While no Indian Head Start programs closed immediately, several have grant cycles that would begin on November 1, forcing them to close down if the government shutdown, or a bill such as this one is passed, has not be resolved by then. Federal Emergency Management Agency The Federal Emergency Management Agency Continuing Appropriations Resolution, 2014 () would provide funding for the Federal Emergency Management Agency, which is responsible for coordinating a response to disasters that occur in the United States and that overwhelm the resources of local and state authorities. The bill would fund the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). The agency's primary purpose is to coordinate the response to a disaster that has occurred in the United States and that overwhelms the resources of local and state authorities. Arguing in favor of the bill, Rep. Carter said that \\"We have a duty to ensure that our nation is adequately prepared for disasters, so that our states are fully supported with their required federal assistance,\\" especially with a storm gathering in the Gulf. Thirty-two Democrats voted in favor of the bill. Despite this, most Democrats continued to oppose the piecemeal funding of the government using mini-continuing resolutions, instead favoring the passage of a full continuing resolution.

It exists in various higher plants, including Taraxacum officinale (Asteraceae), Alnus glutinosa (Betulaceae), Litsea dealbata (Lauraceae), Skimmia spp. (Rutaceae), Dorstenia spp. (Moraceae), Maytenus spp. (Celastraceae), and Alchornea latifolia (Euphobiaceae). Taraxerol was named \\"alnulin\\" when it was first isolated in 1923 from the bark of the grey alder (Alnus incana L.) by Zellner and Röglsperger. It also had the name \\"skimmiol\\" when Takeda and Yosiki isolated it from Skimmia (Rutaceae).  Chemistry = Structure  Taraxerol is an oleanan-3-ol with an alpha-methyl substituent at position 13, a missing methyl group at position 14, and a double bond between 14 and 15. The dominant biological stereoisomer in plant leaves and in sediments has the taraxer-14-en-3β-ol configuration. Taraxerol is a double-bond isomer of β-amyrin, another important naturally-occurring triterpenoid in higher plants. It is a colorless solid under room temperature with an estimated melting point of 283.50 °C and boiling point of 490.70 °C. It is practically insoluble in water and has a solubility of 9.552 × 10−5 mg/L estimated from octanol-water partition coefficient. Taraxerol carbon numbering.  Synthesis  While syntheses of pentacyclic triterpenoids in general have been proven challenging, partial synthesis of 11,12-α-oxidotaraxerol, an epoxide taraxerene derivative, has been reported by Ursprung et al. from α- and β-amyrin. Exposing an ethanolic solution of α- and β-amyrin in summer sunlight for 12 weeks yields a colorless precipitate, and saponification of the precipitate gives 11,12-α-oxidotaraxerol. Alternatively, the process could be accelerated by exposing ethanolic β-amyrin solution under ultraviolet light. In this case, the precipitate can be collected in less than 3 weeks.  Transformation in sediment  During early diagenesis, taraxerol loses its hydroxyl group and gets transformed to taraxer-14-ene. Taraxer-14-ene can undergo rapid isomerization to form 18β-olean-12-ene, in which the double bond can migrate and form a mixture of olean-12-ene, olean-13(18)-ene, and olean-18-ene. The oleanene isomers form rapidly from taraxerol rearrangements during diagenesis even under cool geothermal conditions. Further reduction during catagenesis of the three compounds gives predominantly 18α-oleanane and its counterpart 18β-oleanane as a minor product. The direct reduction product of taraxerol, taraxerane, is hardly present in natural sediments. Oleanane seems to be the dominant product as a result of the transformation process. Transformation of taraxerol during diagenesis and catagenesis. Adapted from Killops & Killops (2013).  Biomarker  Taraxerol is usually present in minor amounts in plant extracts, and it can be used as a lipid biomarker for land plants. However, in many species of mangrove tree leaves, e.g. Rhizophora mangle (red mangrove) and Rhizophora racemosa, taraxerol is present in very high levels. Therefore, it is used in various studies as a proxy for mangrove input. Within different mangrove species there also exist compositional differences. For example, Rhizophora mangle contains high levels of taraxerol, β-amyrin, germanicol, and lupeol, Avicennia germinans (black mangrove) consists mainly of lupeol, betulin, and β-sitosterol, and Laguncularia racemosa (white mangrove) is marked by large quantities of lupeol and β-sitosterol. Rhizophora racemosa trees.  Mangrove biomarker case study  Rhizophora racemosa represents the dominant mangrove species in equatorial and sub-equatorial west Africa. Versteegh et al. analyzed the leaf lipids of R. racemosa as well as surface sediments and sediment cores from Angola Basin and Cape Basin (southeast Atlantic) to assess the suitability of using taraxerol as a proxy for mangrove input in marine sediments. The hypothesis is that there should be a \\"base-level\\" for taraxerol in general sediments and elevated levels at places where Rhizophora has significant contribution. Analysis suggests that taraxerol dominates the inside and the total composition of R. racemosa leaves (7.7 mg/g leaf). As a result, increase in taraxerol level relative to other higher plant biomarkers in sediments should indicate when and where Rhizophora contributes substantially. In the most part of SE Atlantic, taraxerol/normal C29 alkanes (n-C29) ratio in surface sediments is low. High ratios are observed in a zone along the continental slope, in which maxima always occur near present-day on shore mangrove trees. This pattern strongly corroborates the link between high levels of taraxerol and input from mangrove ecosystems. This link is also supported by a similar, though less prominent, trend in Rhizophora pollens. Examination of the sediment cores reveals further connections between mangrove population, taraxerol levels, and climate conditions. One important climate condition is glaciation/deglaciation. During deglaciations when rates of sea level rise exceeded 12 cm/100 yr, mangrove populations could not persist due to lack of sediment supply. After this rate slowed down, mangrove populations can expand again in the freshly developed estuaries and deltas. Periods of mangrove development and rise in taraxerol levels in the basin, however, sometimes do not coincide with each other. In times of fast sea-level rise, coastal mangrove deposits can be transported to the basin, resulting in an increase in taraxerol input, while mangrove development would actually happen afterward. In some other cases where fluctuation in taraxerol levels was not related to sea-level changes, it can also be attributed to local climate variations in temperature and humidity.  Analysis methods  Analysis methods for the determination and quantification of taraxerol include gas chromatography/mass spectroscopy (GC/MS) and high-performance thin layer chromatography (HPTLC).  GC/MS  There are several treatment procedures before running leaf or sediment samples containing taraxerol through GC/MS analysis. Dried and grinded samples are saponified with strong base (e.g. potassium hydroxide), extracted in polar solvent (e.g. dichloromethane), separated into fractions by column chromatography, and finally derivatized. Common choices for derivatization include N-methyl-N-(trimethylsilyl)trifluoroacetamide (MSTFA) and mixture of pyridine and bis(trimethylsilyl)trifluoroacetamide (BSTFA), both of which aim to convert the free hydroxyl groups to trimethylsilyl ethers, making the molecules more non-polar and thus more suitable for GC/MS analysis. In GC/MS, taraxerol has a signature peak with a mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) of 204. Total ion current traces of R. racemosa saponified leaf extracts, showing taraxerol-OTMS (6) with β-amyrin methyl-ether (7) and germanicol-OTMS (8). Adapted from Versteegh et al. (2004).  HPTLC  Alternatively, determination and quantification of taraxerol can also be achieved with good reliability and reproducibility using HPTLC. In this case, linear ascending development is performed (e.g. using hexane and ethyl acetate (8:2 v/v) as mobile phase) in a twin trough glass chamber on TLC aluminum plates. Quantification can be achieved by spectrodensitometric scanning at a wavelength of 420 nm.  Pharmacological research  Taraxerol, like many triterpenoid compounds, has been shown to possess anti-inflammatory effects in vitro. It can disrupt the activation of the enzymes MAP3K7 (TAK1), protein kinase B (PKB or Akt), and NF-κB, by doing so inhibit the expression of proinflammatory mediators in microphages. Taraxerol also exhibits anti- carcinogenic activity. In vivo two-stage carcinogenesis tests of mouse skin tumor showed that taraxerol can inhibit the induction of Epstein-Barr virus early antigen (EBV-EA) by the tumor initiator 7,12-dimethylbenz(a)anthracene (DMBA) and the tumor promoter 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA). In addition, taraxerol can inhibit acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity in rat's hippocampus.

Davies has been a major contributor to the growth of Canada’s music industry and its creative community for more than four decades. He is credited with discovering, producing, publishing, and developing the careers of many celebrated artists and songwriters, as well as being an advocate for their status. Davies received the Juno Awards 2014 Walt Grealis Special Achievement Award, recognizing individuals who have made a significant impact on the Canadian music industry. Family and early life Born in Northampton, England, the son of British politician John Davies, by his marriage to Vera Georgina Harding-Davies, the young Davies was educated at Windlesham House School near Brighton, Pangbourne College, and Strasbourg University, in north-east France. On 1 June 1972 he married the Canadian pop singer Lynda Squires, daughter of Ruth Mullen Squires. The marriage produced three children, Meghan Mae Harding Davies, now Ehrensperger, Emily Gwyneth Emerson Davies-Cohen, and Kate Theresa Georgina Davies.'Hon. Francis William Harding Davies' in Canadian Who's Who, Vol. XLI (University of Toronto Press, 2006) Career as record producer and publisher Davies started his music career in 1964 as a French correspondent to the music industry ‘bible’ Billboard magazine. He later worked for both EMI Records and Liberty Records in London until the late 1960s, before migrating to Canada in 1970. There, he co-founded the independent record label Daffodil (named after the national emblem of Wales and as a symbol of hope and new beginnings), which became the first Canadian label to be distributed by a ‘major’ in that country, in the shape of Capitol/EMI. Davies signed Tom Cochrane, Crowbar, A Foot In Coldwater, the King Biscuit Boy, Klaatu and others to his label throughout the 70’s and published their songs. As a record producer, among other hits he produced for the label, was the first CanCon single ever released - \\"Oh What A Feeling\\" (Crowbar), as well as A Foot In Coldwater’s classic rock hit \\"(Make Me Do) Anything You Want\\". In 1978 alongside Daffodil he formed Partisan Music a production and publishing company that entered into an exclusive deal with a U.S record company (Capitol) to develop talent for that label worldwide – a Canadian first. He brought artists including Alfie Zappacosta, Graham Shaw, and the Leggat Brothers to Capitol Records. In early 1982 Davies put his label and production company on hold to become President of ATV Music Canada. At ATV, he developed the songwriting careers, of Eddie Schwartz, David Tyson, Aldo Nova, the Pukka Orchestra, Headpins, Chilliwack and Toronto, and became a full-time music publisher. In 1986, as a result of ATV’s purchase by Michael Jackson, Davies formed The Music Publisher (TMP) and built it into Canada’s largest and most successful independent music publisher over the next 14 years. Frank sold TMP to Alliance Communications Corporation and A&F; Music in 1994 staying on as its President/CEO until the end of 1999 at which time he founded the music consultancy firm he currently operates - Let Me Be Frank Inc. TMP secured over 1,500 cover recordings, of the 5,000 Canadian songs Davies published, by artists as diverse as Joe Cocker, Bonnie Raitt, Alice Cooper, The Doobie Brothers, Tom Cochrane, Heart, Cher, Don Henley & Sheryl Crow, kd lang, Tanya Tucker, Alannah Myles, Loverboy, Terri Clark, Emmylou Harris, Wynonna, George Jones, Bette Midler, The Carpenters, Blue Öyster Cult, Amanda Marshall, The Pukka Orchestra and The Guess Who. During the TMP years Davies signed and published the songs of songwriters and artists including Jane Siberry, Murray McLauchlan, Honeymoon Suite, Ron Hynes, Eddie Schwartz, Hagood Hardy, Dean McTaggart, Sherry Kean, Exchange, Ian Thomas/Boomers, Gil Grand, and John Capek; as well as American songwriters Byron Hill, Rick Braun, and Odie Blackmon. TMP opened a Nashville office in the mid-90s. Since founding Let Me Be Frank Inc, Davies has been the executive producer for albums by Serena Ryder, who he brought to EMI Music, The Rankin Family, The Treasures whose debut was released by Universal in the spring, and he is currently working on the solo debut for Heather Rankin, the youngest member of the famed Cape Breton family.

While sharing the name Rossese with several Italian varieties (including Rossese di Dolceacqua, Grillo and Ruzzese), DNA profiling has shown that all these varieties have unique genetic profiles and appear to have no close relationship to each other.J. Robinson, J. Harding and J. Vouillamoz Wine Grapes - A complete guide to 1,368 vine varieties, including their origins and flavours pgs 910-911 Allen Lane 2012 Ampelographers believe that the name Rossese came from a description of the intense color of the Rossese berries with the many varieties that are known as Rossese having skin colors that range from deep red to pink to dark gold after veraison. History All known plantings of Rossese bianco are found in the Cuneo province in Piedmont around the communes of Roddino and Sinio. In 1596, Andrea Bacci of Sant'Elpidio a Mare, a winemaker who also served as a physician to Felice Peretti di Montalto before his elevation to Pope Sixtus V noted that a grape known as Rossese bianco or Roxeise had been producing wine of high quality and reputation since the 15th century. However, it is impossible to know if this grape is the Rossese bianco grape of Roddino and Sinio or one of the other many Italian wine grapes that have been known as Rossese. Styles and wines According to Master of Wine Jancis Robinson, the rare varietal examples of Rossese bianco tend to be light bodied with fresh flavors. It is a currently a permitted variety in the Denominazione di origine controllata wines of Langhe.

Inori was created in celebration of Anime Festival Asia 2013, and is featured in a video, Facebook profile as well as a special edition of the browser. Inori's purpose is to help advertise IE, and to convince anime fans to return to using the browser, due to its falling popularity. The character has received mostly positive reception.  Character development  Inori Aizawa is a personification of Internet Explorer. She was designed by Collateral Damage Studios, who wanted to create their own character after artist and producer Danny Choo posted an image featuring human equivalents of the Safari, Firefox, and Chrome web browsers. However, the initial design was little more than fan art. Though after Collateral Damage Studios jokingly asked Microsoft to \\"call them\\", a representative from Microsoft Asia-Pacific approached the company, and Inori was adopted as a mascot for Internet Explorer. As stated by Microsoft, Inori was created by Microsoft Singapore for the Anime Festival Asia 2013 event, and is a part of the local marketing program for anime and Japanese popular culture at AFA 2013, as well as across Asia. However, she does not represent an official mascot for Internet Explorer. At the Festival, Inori was used to draw local attention to the new browser, as well as Windows Phone-powered Nokia phones and tablets. A Microsoft employee has claimed that Inori represents \\"a new way of looking at\\" Internet Explorer. The character is voiced by former Sea*A idol and anime song artist Valerie, who also made a cosplay appearance as Inori at Microsoft's marketing launch at AFA2013. Despite being featured on the official Internet Explorer YouTube channel, Microsoft has clarified that Inori Aizawa will not be used in marketing campaigns outside Asia, which includes the United States. According to Collateral Damage Studios, the artists who created the character, \\"The concept that we wanted to go for with our IE-tan was ‘redemption\\", referencing the earlier, poorer versions of Internet Explorer. They compared the earlier versions of the browser to \\"a clumsy girl who tries to do too much. She is klutzy, nerdy ... someone that everyone would love to bully\\", and thus design elements were incorporated to reflect upon IE's transformation from an “ugly duckling” to a \\"slick and confident\\" browser. Regarding the character's name, Collateral Damage Studios commented that they chose \\"Aizawa\\" as she comes from the greater Microsoft family of anime personification characters, and \\"Inori\\" since \\"given what she represents, she could definitely use a prayer.\\" An advertisement featuring Inori was uploaded to Internet Explorer's YouTube channel for the Anime Festival Asia event. Microsoft had previously used similar anime characters in its marketing in Asia. This includes Hikaru Aizawa, whom Microsoft Taiwan has used to market Microsoft Silverlight since 2010, Nanami Madobe, the mascot of Windows 7, as well as Madobe Ai and Madobe Yuu, the mascots of Windows 8. To date, over 10 original characters have been used. However, all of these characters were inspired by the original OS-tans, personified operating systems that had their origins on Futaba Channel. Apart from the video, there is also a Facebook page devoted to the character, including a post on Inori's backstory, which, along with the video, is a metaphor for the development and evolution of Internet Explorer. Additionally, Inori features in a special edition of the latest version of the browser. Microsoft hopes that Inori may cause anime fans to return to the browser, due to Internet Explorer's declining popularity as well as the emergence of other browsers such as Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox.  Reception  Cnet's Bonnie Burton reviewed Inori positively, saying \\"she's is a sassy girl who fights robots, dresses like a sexy otaku girl, and pets her cat while surfing the Net. She's the kind of girl you want hanging around your computer\\", and compared her to Clippy, the \\"annoying Office Assistant\\" attached to earlier versions of Microsoft Office. They also claimed that \\"she represents a shift in thinking about what IE's image could become\\", and wished that her role could eventually be expanded. The Verge called the Inori Aizawa video Microsoft's \\"best ad yet\\", and added \\"In the end, this is anime for the sake of anime, and it’s fun based on that alone. It may not inspire any users to stow Chrome in favor of IE, but it’s certainly worth the watch.\\" They also compared it positively to earlier Microsoft ad campaigns. They also claimed \\"No character has been quite like Inori Aizawa, though. Introduced to the world in a commercial titled \\"Internet Explorer: The Anime,\\" Inori is made to entice the masses, rather than developers or enthusiasts, to try out Microsoft's steadily improving browser.\\" Digital Journal labelled the Inori Aizawa video as \\"pretty exciting and keeps true to the feel of intense action science-fiction\\", and that Inori helps Microsoft to \\"tap into the power and influence of Japanese anime to promote Internet Explorer.\\" Mark Wilson of WinBeta agreed, finding it to be \\"pretty impressive stuff\\". Windows Phone Central commented on the video also, writing \\"[it is] a pretty cool new ad for IE from Microsoft\\", and found the scenes to be \\"pretty epic\\", while Wayne Williams of BetaNews said \\"it’s certainly a different way to attract people to the browser.\\" Karliah Eun of Kicker Daily News wrote \\"Microsoft has gone a long way from bad anthropomorphic characters to so-so bland personas. However, their latest offering [Inori] won’t disappoint you.\\" Carly Smith of The Escapist wrote that \\"Inori hits the anime checklist with [a] magical girl transformation scene and cutesy personality.\\" Mary-Anne Lee of Games in Asia listed the character as one of the reasons why Anime Festival Asia 2013 is \\"worth checking out\\", claiming that \\"the internets have been exploding with the Internet Explorer girl [Inori].\\" The character was also popular around the internet, with a large number of fanart being submitted featuring the character, as well as cosplayers. The video and character of Inori were both met with widespread approval from viewers, some professing that they had switched back to IE, while others called it a \\"stylish campaign\\" but were still reluctant to use Internet Explorer. The character's Facebook profile has also been a success, amounting to over 17,000 likes, with 400 coming within the first two days. On the other hand, Liberty Voice questioned why Microsoft had created such a strong ad campaign with so little information about their actual product. Reviews gathered and published within the article show that although Inori was considered an attractive mascot, the browser itself had removed a desired feature for one interviewee, and caused others to question exactly why Microsoft focused their advertisement on Inori rather than Internet Explorer. Nick Summers of The Next Web thought that Inori's promo video was \\"all rather confusing\\", \\"unexpected\\" and \\"certainly different to old Clippy\\", while Peter Bright of Ars Technica found it to be \\"really rather weird\\", though he did claim \\"I like the music.\\" The Mary Sue commented \\" we can’t stop trying to make this make sense, and it’s really hurting our brains\\", and jokingly wrote \\"this video also marks the first time we’ve ever seen anyone switch to Internet Explorer to solve a problem.\\" The Tech Report also reviewed Inori negatively, stating \\"I'm still shaking my head and laughing over here\\", specifically titling the article \\"Microsoft Pimps Internet Explorer with Anime Mascot,\\" while Abrition found Inori to be \\"a bit weird\\" due to being able to read her personal attributes and \\"odd\\" due to the fact that she had a personalized biography.

It is an extension of the SIMPLE algorithm used in computational fluid dynamics to solve the Navier-Stokes equations. PISO is a pressure-velocity calculation procedure for the Navier-Stokes equations developed originally for non-iterative computation of unsteady compressible flow, but it has been adapted successfully to steady-state problems. PISO involves one predictor step and two corrector steps and is designed to satisfy mass conservation using predictor-corrector steps. Algorithm steps center The algorithm can be summed up as follows: #Set the boundary conditions. #Solve the discretized momentum equation to compute an intermediate velocity field. #Compute the mass fluxes at the cells faces. #Solve the pressure equation. #Correct the mass fluxes at the cell faces. #Correct the velocities on the basis of the new pressure field. #Update the boundary conditions. #Repeat from 3 for the prescribed number of times. #Increase the time step and repeat from 1. As already seen for the SIMPLE algorithm, the steps 4 and 5 can be repeated for a prescribed number of times to correct for non-orthogonality. Predictor step Guess the pressure field p^* and get velocity field components u^* and v^* using discretized momentum equation. The initial guess for the pressure may or may not be correct. Corrector step 1 Velocity component obtained from predictor step may not satisfy the continuity equation, so we define correction factors p',v',u' for the pressure field and velocity field. Solve the momentum equation by inserting correct pressure field p^{**} and get the corresponding correct velocity components u^{**} and v^{**}. p'=p^{**}-p^* v'=v^{**}-v^* u'=u^{**}-u^* where ; p^{**},u^{**},v^{**} :correct pressure field and velocity component p',u',v' :correction in pressure field and correction in velocity components p^*,u^*,v^* :guessed pressure field and velocity component We define p',u',v' as above. By putting the correct pressure field p^{**} into the discretized momentum equation we get the correct velocity components v^{**} and u^{**}. Once the pressure correction p' is known we can find the correction components for the velocity: u' and v'. Corrector step 2 In piso another corrector step can be used. p^{***}=p^{**}+p ; p=p^*+p' u^{***}=u^{**}+u ; u=u^*+u' v^{***}=v^{**}+v ; v=v^*+v' where : p^{***},v^{***},u^{***} are the correct pressure field and the correct velocity components, respectively and p,v,u are second corrections to the pressure and velocity field. Set p=p^{***}, v=v^{***}, u=u^{***} where; p,v,u are correct pressure and velocity field Advantages and disadvantages # Generally gives more stable results and takes less CPU time but not suitable for all processes. # Suitable numerical schemes for solving the pressure-velocity linked equation. # For laminar backward facing step PISO is faster than SIMPLE but it is slower concerning flow through heated fin. # If momentum and scalar equation have weak or no coupling then PISO is better than SIMPLEC.

After the release of her first two fragrances, Puig enlisted several perfumers to work on Shakira's third fragrance, which she claimed would capture her \\"most sensual and exotic side.\\" The final product was Elixir, an oriental perfume based on various spicy and woody sources. The flacon of the perfume is inspired by apothecary bottles and is made to resemble a magical potion, featuring a light golden colour scheme. Shakira launched the fragrance at a press release in São Paulo, Brazil, in July 2012. Additionally, Jaume de Laiguana directed a commercial for the fragrance, which was filmed in the Sahara desert in Morocco. In August 2013, Wild Elixir was released as a flanker fragrance to Elixir. The floral oriental perfume is similar to the original one in appearance but features a variation in the colour scheme. It was promoted through a commercial which features Shakira encountering two cheetahs in an arid landscape.  Development = Background  In 2008, international fashion and fragrance company Puig announced that it had formed a partnership with Shakira and had signed an agreement \\"to develop a line of signature products produced with and inspired by the artist\\". The first product to appear was S by Shakira, which was released in September 2010, followed by S by Shakira Eau Florale. After developing her first two fragrances, Puig began working on Shakira's third perfume and enlisted Alexandra Kosinski and Sonia Constant, perfumers from Swiss fragrance manufacturer Givaudan, to collaborate with Elisabeth Vidal, a perfumer from Puig. Vidal had previously worked with Shakira on S by Shakira Eau Florale. The perfumers came up with the concept of a \\"second skin\\", described by Shakira as a \\"fragrance that becomes a part of you\\". In an interview with Women's Wear Daily, the singer claimed that the scent would display her \\"most sensual and exotic side\\" and had seemingly been inspired by the deserts of Morocco.  Scent and packaging  Elixir belongs to the oriental olfactive family, which is known to contain intense and long lasting fragrances. The top notes of the perfume were described by Shakira as \\"floral and spicy\\" and include neroli, white pepper, and white flower; the heart notes were said to be \\"velvety and fruity\\" and are based on the scents of flowers like freesia and paeonia, and apricot; the base notes contain amber, benzoin, musk, sugar cane and white cedar wood. The ingredients of the perfume are mostly based on spicy and woody elements which overbear the sweeter floral elements. Shakira herself stated that the \\"sweetness\\" in Elixir was kept to a limited amount. German packaging company Gerresheimer was hired to produce the flacon of Elixir. It is made of clear moulded glass and has a slender gold-tinted neck. According to Jose Manuel Albesa, chief brand officer of Puig, it is inspired by the bottles used in the historic medical practice of apothecary. In an interview with Latina, Shakira revealed that she wanted to \\"depict the kind of bottle that was used in ancient times, but that looked modern and chic as well\\" and come up with a design similar to a magical potion, which is the definition of the word 'elixir'. As the scent is inspired by the desert, she chose the tint of the bottle to be golden so that it can \\"evoke the memories of sands and sunsets\\". The packaging of the fragrance was designed by Colombian artist Catalina Estrada and features colourful illustrations of various birds and leaves printed on a pale background.  Release  Released in late-July 2012, Elixir was made available for purchase exclusively in American department store chains Kohl's and Sears. The two stores served as exclusive retailers of the fragrance for two months, after which it was released to mass market stores like CVS Caremark and Walgreens. Elixir was released in approximately 19,000 stores in the United States alone. Elsewhere, Elixir was released in Eastern Europe, Italy, and Latin America. The perfume was aimed at a younger demographic, according to Albesa. Elixir was made available as an eau de toilette, and its prices ranged from US $17.50 to US $36 with respect to the size. Shakira launched Elixir at a press release in São Paulo, Brazil, on 17 July 2012, where she discussed her inspiration behind the fragrance and its development process. The commercial for the fragrance was shot in the Sahara desert in Morocco by Jaume de Laiguana, who had previously directed music videos for various songs by Shakira, like \\"Loca\\" and \\"Rabiosa\\". The advertisement features Shakira in the middle of the desert wearing a long skirt; she opens a bottle of Elixir and performs a dance routine, attracting an eagle towards her which perches on her arm. A competition was held on the official website of the perfume to determine a winner who would be rewarded the long skirt Shakira wore in the commercial.  Products  Elixir was produced in the following range: * Eau de toilette spray - 15 ml/0.5 oz * Eau de toilette spray - 30 ml/1 oz * Eau de toilette spray - 50 ml/1.7 oz * Deodorant spray - 150 ml/5.1 oz * Body lotion - 101 ml/3.4 oz (available only in gift sets) * Lip balm - 15.7 ml/0.53 oz (available only in gift sets)  Reception  Samantha Lea from Latina praised the perfume's versatility, saying it is suitable for use \\"whether you prefer fruity to floral scents or want your scent to transport you to a tropical beach\\". She chose the usage of freesia and peony as the highlight of Elixir and included the perfume in her list of \\"Five Amazing Summer Scents and Perfumes\\". Miranda Noland, an editor of the magazine, opined the Elixir gift set would \\"please any Shakira lover.\\" At the 2011 Academia Del Perfume Award ceremony sponsored by the Fragrance Foundation, Elixir won the award for \\"Best Female Perfume General Public Category\\". Industry analysts predicted that the perfume would make $14 million through global retail sales in its first year. Twenty percent of this amount was credited to sales in the United States. In April 2013, Puig released a press statement mentioning that Elixir had performed well commercially.  Wild Elixir = Background and scent  Wild Elixir was released as a flanker fragrance to Elixir on 25 August 2013. Categorised as a floral oriental perfume, Wild Elixir features top notes of cassis and mandarin; heart notes of honeysuckle flower, orange blossom, and peach fruit accord; the base notes consist of benzoin resin, patchouli, and sandalwood. The flacon of the perfume is similar to the original one, but instead features a contrasting colour scheme of golden and black. The packaging was again designed by Estrada and features illustrations of flowers and wild cats set on a brownish orange background and is similar to the look of the African savannah. The Russian edition of Cosmopolitan gave Wild Elixir a positive review, praising its packaging and the choice of ingredients in the notes.  Promotion  On 23 June 2013, Shakira released a teaser of the commercial for the fragrance along with a photo of her posing with two cheetahs. A full version of the commercial was released later. It begins with Shakira, dressed in a dark burgundy gown, coming across a pair of cheetahs in an arid desert region. The two animals, alarmed, commence running towards her in an effort to attack her. Shakira responds by raising her hand, which prompts the cheetahs to abruptly stop in their tracks.

Education A high school dropout, Brian Banks later received his GED. Legislative accomplishments During Brian Banks tenure in the Michigan House of Representatives, members of the Michigan Democratic Party had over 190 pieces of legislation signed into law. Despite being Chairman of the Detroit Caucus, 91 percent of Brian Banks bills died in committee during the same period of time. Only 2 of his bills ever received votes on the floor and neither passed into law. Professional career In 2019, Brian Banks pitched his consulting services to the Detroit Public Schools Community District (\\"DPSCD\\") and Promise Schools, a company running a K-8 school for the School District of the City of Highland Park. Promise Schools initially contracted with Banks, after receiving a \\"strong recommendation, on more than one occasion\\" from District President Alexis Ramsey. Ramsey admitted that she was a political ally of Banks, but insisted that she did not push the District to hire Banks. Promise Schools CEO Melissa Hamann stated that Ramsey's recommendation was influential in the decision to hire Banks. After being contacted by a concerned citizen about the hire, Highland Park School Board member Eban Morales told Fox 2 Detroit: \\"I contacted Promise Schools and I said to them, like, 'How did he come about?' And the head person there said: 'Alexis Ramsey strongly suggested on more than one occasion that we needed to hire him.' And I'm like: 'Do you know his history?' And they're like, 'Yeah, well, she said that we should hire him and that he was the best person for the job.'\\" Unlike Promise Schools, DPSCD officials asked Banks to submit a bid for the work he proposed. During negotiations, Banks bid was the lowest bid received by the District. However, according to Assistant Superintendent Chrystal Wilson, when “the District proceeded to its contract due diligence phase...more detailed information regarding Mr. Banks’ background was realized that made it untenable for the district to move forward with a formal contract. Since that time, the District has not engaged in business with Mr. Banks and at this point does not intend to.” Criminal and civil history Since 1998, Brian Banks has been convicted of eight felonies and one misdemeanor. Civil judgements Since his first election, Brian Banks has civil judgements against him in the amount of $47,809.84. He has been evicted a total of seven times in recent years, including two eviction proceedings filed against him in 2016. During the 2012 election, Brian Banks refused to pay Sawicki & Sons, the company that made his campaign signs. During the 2012 Primary Election, Brian Banks was evicted from a home in Harper Woods at 19239 Berden by landlord Michele Wood, who took him to court three times for writing bad checks and not paying rent. After the 2012 General Election, Brian Banks was evicted from his Harper Woods home at 20927 Fleetwood when he bounced two checks to landlord Dan Sylvester. Sexual harassment In 2013, Brian Banks was sued for sexual harassment by his Legislative Aide, Mr. Tramaine Cotton. According to Tim Bowlin, director of the House Business Office, the state paid $85,622 to the Dickinson Wright law firm to defend Banks against the charges of sexual harassment. The lawsuit was later settled for $11,950. Fraud On June 28, 2016, Brian Banks was charged with three new felonies and one misdemeanor by Michigan Attorney General Bill Schuette over documents he falsified, to obtain a personal loan in June 2010. In a press release, the Attorney General's office said the felony charges against Banks stemmed from his use of falsified pay stubs in an application for a $7,500 loan. The news release stated that Banks claimed to work for IHI Attorneys and Consultants of Farmington, but investigators learned he had never worked there, and the paychecks “originated with a payroll company the firm never used.” Because of his previous felony convictions, Banks was charged as a habitual offender and could have faced life in prison if convicted of the new felonies. In August 2016, Banks was bound over to Wayne County Circuit Court for trial on all charges by District Court Judge Deborah Langston. Banks was formally arraigned in Circuit Court on August 23. On February 6, 2017, Banks plead guilty to a misdemeanor charge of filing false financial statements, a charge that carried a penalty of up to a year in prison. As part of a plea deal Banks reached with the Michigan Attorney General’s office, the remaining felony charges he was facing were dropped. Sentencing on the plea deal was set for 9 a.m. on February 17, 2017. Banks was sentenced to time served. He previously spent one day in jail. In a statement following Banks sentencing, Michigan Attorney General Bill Schuette stated, \\"“Former Rep. Banks pleaded guilty, admitting he did indeed commit the crime for which he was sentenced. I am pleased to see this case come to a close and that the residents of his district have the chance to get an honest, hardworking and law-abiding representative.” Mail fraud In July 2016 Kevin Trayer, the Postmaster of the Richland Post Office, investigated Brian Banks for mail fraud, concerning mail pieces that listed defunct Political Action Committees in the required political disclaimer. The pieces attacked Banks Primary opponent Pamela Sossi and echoed claims Banks had made while knocking doors. The former legislators tied to the dissolved PAC's had no ties to Brian Banks and denied allowing him to use the PAC's for any purpose. Violation of Michigan Campaign Finance Act On September 15, 2016, Michigan Secretary of State Ruth Johnson ruled that Brian Banks used House funds or resources to mail invitations to an event advocating for his re- election, a violation of section 57 of the Michigan Campaign Finance Act. As a result, Banks was required to personally reimburse the Michigan House of Representatives for the materials and labor misused. In December 2016, Brian Banks filed a motion to have Michigan Attorney General Bill Schuette's office disqualified from the case, again claiming that the charges brought against him were politically motivated collusion between Pamela Sossi and the Attorney General, timed to ensure Banks lost his bid for re-election. Wayne County Circuit Judge Michael Hathaway dismissed Banks motion, ruling that the key question was not why Banks may have been charged, but whether he committed the crimes alleged in the charges. In February 2017, Brian Banks reached a plea agreement with the Attorney General's office in which all felony counts against were dropped in exchange for his immediate resignation from the Michigan House of Representatives and pleading guilty to one misdemeanor. Banks announced his formal resignation in Wayne County Circuit Court on February 6, 2017. FBI corruption & bribery investigation In December 2017, the Detroit Free Press obtained FBI wiretap transcripts that were unsealed in U.S. District Court. The investigation is linked to a corruption case against Gasper Fiore, the owner of Boulevard & Trumbull Towing, a large City of Detroit contractor. In December 2017, Fiore entered into a plea agreement with the U.S. Attorney's Office, in which he agreed to plead guilty to conspiracy to commit federal program bribery. According to court documents, the government had probable cause that Fiore and 17 other targets were involved in several crimes, including: extortion, wire fraud, bribery and conspiracy to distribute marijuana. Fiore was so politically connected that in 2016, his daughter helped write an amendment to the Michigan Department of Transportation budget that ensured his company would win a multimillion-dollar contract, federal documents show. Along the way, Fiore appeared to have gotten help from Banks. \\"Fiore is involved in bid-rigging with legislator Brian Banks,\\" Special FBI Agent Robert Beeckman wrote in 2016 affidavit, which included intercepted text messages and phone calls between Fiore and Banks. According to the affidavit, in a May 5, 2016, phone conversation, Fiore and Banks spoke about the MDOT contract when Banks mentioned Fiore's political \\"might.\\" \\"MDOT said you have a mighty force behind you ... They said: 'We don't want to mess with that force,' \\" Banks said. Fiore responded: \\"Mmmmmm yeah. Does that mean, So what they doing with the deal then?\\" Banks: \\"So, you good so far. You hear me.\\" On May 26, a phone call between Gasper Fiore and Banks again discussed the MDOT contract. \\"MDOT said you have a mighty force behind you,\\" Banks stated. Fiore laughed in response. \\"They said you – 'We, we don't want to mess with that force behind you.'\\" Later in the conversation, Banks again reassures Fiore: \\"You know with the MDOT, you good.\\" The conversation between Banks and Fiore was among many that the government obtained after bugging Fiore's phone last year. Campaign finance records show both Jennifer Fiore and Gasper Fiore donated to Banks House campaign against Pamela Sossi. Other controversies Brian Banks has falsely claimed to be an attorney, leading Wayne County Sheriff Benny Napoleon to endorse him. Sheriff Napoleon's spokesman Dennis Niemiec said the Sheriff was unaware of Banks' felony convictions and Sheriff Napoleon said he did not previously know about Banks' felonies. The State Bar of Michigan has no record of Banks ever being licensed to practice law in Michigan. Brian Banks campaign website previously stated that he was on staff at the law firm Rodnick, Unger and Kaner, P.C. and was an adjunct professor at Baker College. An employee at Rodnick, Unger and Kaner, P.C. told the Huffington Post that while Banks briefly worked at the firm as a law clerk, he left after only a few months. Brian Banks has also claimed to be an elementary school teacher and his biography on the Michigan House Democrats website listed him as a former elementary school teacher. The Michigan Department of Education Online Educator Certification System states that Banks has never held an Educator Certification. Michigan law prohibits convicted felons from being employed by a school, unless independently waived by the Superintendent and School Board. During the 2012 General Election, the Grosse Pointe Democrats refused to endorse Brian Banks, despite his request for the endorsement and the fact that he was the Democratic candidate. Political career=2012 election Despite a number of controversies, Brian Banks defeated Scott Benson by 96 votes to win the 2012 Democratic Primary. 2014 election Although only receiving 42% of the vote in the 2014 Primary, Banks was re-elected. 2016 primary election During the August 2016 Primary Election, Brian Banks narrowly defended a challenge for his seat by Harper Woods attorney Pamela Sossi, a first time candidate. Despite Banks significant fundraising advantage, Sossi led the race throughout the night until last minute votes were reported, giving Banks a narrow victory. Sossi swept the suburbs, winning Harper Woods, Grosse Pointe Woods and Grosse Pointe Shores, while Banks won Detroit. According to the Detroit Free Press, the 1st House District Primary Election was the most competitive election in Wayne County. As the Chair of the Detroit Caucus, Banks was able to enlist the help of Detroit Mayor Mike Duggan, other lawmakers and interest groups in Lansing to raise $140,545, second most of all candidates facing Primary challengers. Records show that Banks major financial backers included Republican \\"Matty\\" Moroun (owner of the Detroit International Bridge Co.), State Rep. Andy Schor, Reynolds American, Rizzo Environmental Services and Gaspar Fiore. Rizzo Environmental and Fiore would later be ensnared in a public corruption investigation by the FBI. 2016 general election During the November 8 General Election, Banks received 66 percent of the vote over engineer William Broman, his Republican challenger. Resignation from Michigan House of Representatives On February 6, 2017, just 26 days into his third term in the Michigan House of Representatives, Brian Banks resigned his seat to avoid prison time. Banks’ resignation letter, submitted to House Speaker Tom Leonard, was effective immediately. In a statement, Speaker Leonard said, “Rep. Banks had one legal issue after another during his time in public office. I am glad to see he is finally taking responsibility for his actions, and hopefully today's plea agreement provides the fresh start he needs.\\" By 9 am, February 8, 2017, Banks was sending e-mails to supporters inviting them to a March 6 fundraiser for his PAC, Bank on Banks for Michigan, leading to speculation that he would be running for future office, or financially backing his chosen successor. The fundraiser was held at Sinbad's restaurant in Detroit, and advertised tickets starting at $50 and topping out at $5,000 for a platinum sponsorship. On February 16, 2017, Governor Rick Snyder called a Special Election to fill the vacancy left by Banks resignation. Both the Governor and the Secretary of State's office ruled that Banks was not eligible to run for his own seat, ending speculation that he might do so. Additionally, Representative Aaron Miller filed HB 4208 to ensure that expelled or resigned former members could not run in the Special Election called because of the vacancy they caused. 2018 primary election In August 2017, Brian Banks filed candidate paperwork to run for the Michigan State Senate 2nd District seat in anticipation of a resignation by Bert Johnson, who has been federally indicted for corruption. According to the invitation obtained by the Detroit News, Banks kicked off his campaign with a November 13 fundraiser at the American Serbian Hall in Detroit. Suggested contributions ranged from $41 for a ticket to $2,000 for a sponsor-level donor. Banks attempt to return to the Michigan Legislature failed. In the August 7, 2018 Election, Banks lost to first-time candidates Adam Hollier of Detroit (25.1%) and Abraham Aiyash of Hamtramck (20.9%). Banks received 17.1% of the vote, for a third place finish.

She was torpedoed and sunk in the Mediterranean Sea on 4 October 1916 with great loss of life. Salon de musique aboard Gallia Gallia was built as an ocean liner for service between France and South America. She sailed between Bordeaux and Rio de Janeiro in 10 days, and between Bordeaux and Buenos Aires in 13 days. The ship, with several others, was refitted for use as a troopship during World War I. On 3 October 1916, Gallia left Toulon unescorted, destined for Thessaloniki in Greece. Aboard were 2,350 people (1,650 French soldiers, 350 Serbian soldiers, and 350 crew members) and a cargo of artillery and ammunition. The next day, between Sardinia and Tunisia, she was hit by a torpedo from the German submarine commanded by Lothar von Arnauld de la Perière. Ammunition aboard Gallia exploded, and the ship sank in 15 minutes. Because of the rapid sinking, panic broke out on board resulting in lifeboats capsizing, and thousands of soldiers jumping overboard. The ship′s radio was disabled by the explosions, preventing the sending of a distress signal. The next day the French Navy's protected cruiser rescued the remaining survivors. About 600 people died as a result of the sinking. A list of missing personnel was published on 31 October 1917 by the Tribunal Civil of Toulon. It contained the names of 44 sailors and 553 soldiers. Several individual soldiers known by their family members to have perished are not on the list. The Serbian soldiers were also not included.

Facts  The plaintiff had instituted action against the defendant for damages arising from an alleged unlawful arrest and detention. The defendant considered that the police docket relating to such arrest was privileged, and listed it accordingly in his discovery affidavit. The plaintiff then launched the application in casu for an order directing the defendant to make the police docket available for inspection and copying.  Judgment = Amicus curiae  After the postponement of the matter, from May 19, 1994, to June 13, 1994, the court (with the consent of the parties, and having obtained the approval of the Judge President) appointed Prof E. Mureinik of the Law Faculty of the University of the Witwatersrand to act as amicus curiae. Prof Mureinik filed heads of argument, provided copies of authorities, and made oral submissions after those of the plaintiff and defendant had been concluded. Counsel for the plaintiff and defendant thereafter replied to his submissions. He was not remunerated for this work. His assistance was \\"invaluable to the Court and was greatly appreciated.\\"254.  Merits  Having set out the provisions of the Constitution relevant to the issue, the court considered the principles applicable in interpreting provisions of a constitution. Fundamental-rights provisions call for a generous and purposive interpretation. The meaning of a right is to be gathered from a consideration of the interests it was intended to protect. The principles of interpretation contained in section 35 of the Constitution are also applicable. The court then turned to an examination of Plaintiff's rights under section 23. It was accepted that the information contained in the police docket was held by an organ of state, and was information relevant to the protection of the plaintiff's rights to freedom and security. The defendant, however, placed in issue that the information was “required” by the plaintiff. After a survey of judicial interpretations of the word “required,” the Court concluded that, in its context in section 23, whether information is “required” in any particular case is a factual question. This raised the issue of whether it was intended that section 23 should serve as a discovery measure in litigation between the government and another. The defendant contended that it was not, and that section 23 should be viewed as analogous to the freedom-of-information statutes enacted in various other countries. The court held that such an analogy is not proper. Section 23 does not give the public a general right of access to information. It confers on individuals a right of access to information which is required for the exercise or protection of a right. Then and only then does the State have an obligation to provide access. To resist a claim for information, the State would have to satisfy the requirements of section 33 in each particular case. The Court concluded that it was appropriate to use section 23 to obtain discovery of documents, and that the plaintiff was entitled in terms of section 23 to the information in the police docket. The court then turned to a consideration of the defendant's reliance on section 33(1). This resolved into a question of whether docket privilege is reasonable and justifiable in an open and democratic society based on freedom and equality. (In regard to the requirement of section 33(1)(b)—that a limit “shall not negate the essential content of a right”—the court found that docket privilege did not negate the essential content of the section 23 right.) The court held that Defendant bore the onus to establish this according to the civil standard of proof. Before turning to a consideration of the affidavit of the Commissioner of Police in support of the defendant's contentions, the Court set out the nature of docket privilege. Prior to 1954, only three categories of privilege were recognised: # State secrets; # identity of informers in criminal cases; and # professional privilege. R v Steyn1954 (1) SA 324 (A). conferred a privilege on police dockets. In creating this general privilege, appeal was made to considerations of public policy. Thereafter, judicial precedent extended the privilege and added to it the principle, taken from legal professional privilege, of “once privileged, always privileged.” In his affidavit, the Commissioner of Police advanced reasons justifying the withholding of information contained in the police docket in a criminal case. These included * the prejudice to the investigation of crime if the identity of informers or the techniques of investigation were revealed; * the possible reluctance of foreign police forces to share information in the absence of a guarantee of confidentiality; and * the adverse effect on the flow of information from the public if its members could not be assured of confidentiality. In assessing the cogency of such a justification, the court considered that a starting point must be an acceptance that the administration of justice and the maintenance of social peace and order is a fundamental public interest. This dictated that, as a matter of public policy, some information (such as the identity of informers) should be subject to privilege and not be disclosed. The defendant's case, however, was that, because some of the information might be privileged, all the information should be withheld. This approach did not deal with whether the non-disclosure of unprivileged information in the docket was justifiable in an open and democratic society based on freedom and equality. To determine this question, the parties had been requested to inform the court of the practice in other countries. By agreement the parties, jointly requested Professor T Geldenhuys of the University of South Africa to prepare a memorandum setting out research conducted by him on this question. Such research covered discovery practice in criminal cases in Canada, New Zealand, the United States of America, England and Australia. The findings are set out in the court's judgment. The Court concluded from that survey that, in general, the trend in those societies was towards an expansion of the accused's rights of access to information in the possession of the prosecution. In the court's view, South African law should fall in line with that international trend. Policy considerations in favour of disclosure of unprivileged information outweigh those against disclosure. Any residual doubt on where the balance lay was removed by taking into account the fundamental right of equality before the law (section 8(1)), the right to a fair trial (section 25(3)) and the presumption of innocence (section 25(3)(c)). The Court concluded that Defendant had not established that the privilege hitherto attaching to the police docket in respect of its unprivileged contents was reasonable and justifiable in an open and democratic society based on freedom and equality. The Court rejected the claim of docket privilege and granted the defendant leave to file a supplementary discovery affidavit disclosing, in the first schedule, the information in respect of which no privilege was claimed and in the second schedule, that information in respect of which privilege was claimed.

The order appealed against was one which restored an arbitration award granting reinstatement of the employee (the respondent in this matter) retrospective to the date of his dismissal in 2001.  Facts  The case arose out of the dismissal of the employee more than nine years before by the employer, the applicant in this matter, Billiton Aluminum. The employee successfully challenged the fairness of the dismissal in arbitration proceedings before the Commission for Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration (CCMA) in 2001. On review the Labour Court remitted the matter for fresh arbitration proceedings. The finding of the commissioner in the second arbitration proceedings was that the dismissal was substantively unfair and that the employee should be reinstated retrospectively. This finding was taken on review to the Labour Court. The Labour Court confirmed the unfairness of the dismissal, but ordered compensation rather than reinstatement. This order was then taken on appeal to the Labour Appeal Court by the employee. In that court the employer ultimately accepted that the employee’s dismissal was substantively unfair. In upholding the appeal, the Labour Appeal Court restored the commissioner’s award, based on the finding that the Labour Court had wrongly treated the matter as an appeal rather than a review, and accordingly ordered that the commissioner’s arbitration award be restored. The employer then applied for leave to appeal against the Labour Appeal Court’s order to the Constitutional Court, where the employer argued that, despite the dismissal being substantively unfair, the Labour Appeal Court should nevertheless have ordered compensation, not reinstatement. In the alternative, it argued that the Labour Appeal Court was under a constitutional duty to grant an order that was appropriate, just and equitable in terms of section 172(1)(b) of the Constitution. It argued that the Labour Appeal Court was under an obligation to investigate, on its own accord, facts which arose after the arbitration award was made or judgment in the Labour Court had been delivered. In particular it was argued that systemic delays within the dispute-resolution procedures under the Labour Relations ActAct 66 of 1995 should be taken into account when granting a remedy, and that, where an employee had earned an income subsequent to his dismissal, it should be taken into account when making a just and equitable remedy on appeal. The latter arguments were never raised in the Labour Appeal Court; they were raised for the first time in the Constitutional Court.  Judgment  In dismissing the application for leave to appeal, Froneman J, writing for a unanimous court, held that, although the matter raised a constitutional issue, it was not in the interests of justice for leave to appeal to be granted. As a general principle, the Constitutional Court had required that constitutional issues be raised in the courts from which the appeal arose before leave to appeal would be granted. This was especially so because this was a matter which fell manifestly within the jurisdiction of the Labour Courts, and because the Constitutional Court would have benefited from its expertise in the matter. It was accordingly found that there were no exceptional circumstances in this case which warranted the Constitutional Court's sitting as a court of first and last instance. The court further held that leave to appeal should also be refused on an additional ground, namely that the constitutional point lacked prospects of success in the particular form and manner in which it was raised. It was found that there is no duty upon courts to investigate post-judgment facts in making a just and equitable order, especially where litigants had not made use of the relevant rules for adducing further evidence on appeal. Similarly, the applicant’s argument that there was a legal duty upon employees to mitigate their losses was dismissed. People sought work after dismissal for economic survival; it was unnecessary to turn this essential component of life into a legal duty. The court recognised that delays plague the dispute- resolution procedures under the Labour Relations Act. It noted that such delays should be addressed by the users of the system within the different institutions that make up the dispute resolution procedures. It held that the delay in this particular case was primarily caused by the employer itself, in its failure to implement the order of reinstatement, despite its eventual recognition that the dismissal was unfair. In the result, leave to appeal was dismissed.

Delusional Thomas was entirely produced by Miller under his production alias Larry Fisherman. The mixtape featured guest appearances from Earl Sweatshirt, Da$h, Bill, and Mac Miller himself.  Background and themes  After the release of Mac Miller's second studio album Watching Movies with the Sound Off, Miller began recording material under a new character named Delusional Thomas. On November 1st , 2013, Miller released a previous unannounced mixtape named Delusional Thomas, introducing the new character. The mixtape was produced by Miller under his production alias' Larry Fisherman and features him rapping in a distorted pitched up voice. He explained the voice choice saying, \\"to me it was a character and I wanted to give his whole own complete, like, everything. There was part of me that wanted to do my own voice, but I just wanted it to be its own complete character. And I feel like that evil voice inside your head is always kind of in that pitch.\\" His rhymes were described frequently as having horrorcore influences. His lyrics contain \\"references to extreme violence, constant challenges to Christianity and jokes about offering up younger nephews to Michael Jackson for sex.\\" The mixtape featured guest appearances from Earl Sweatshirt, Mac Miller in his normal voice, ASAP Mob's Da$H and Bill. Miller's album sound and lyrics were also likely influenced by his heavy drug use. In his song \\"The Jesuits\\" Miller talks about \\"black tar demons\\". This album came at a time during his career when Miller was heavily involved with drugs.  Composition and production  The first track \\"Larry\\" \\"starts out with slow-pounding keys and the eerie sound of a loon call,\\" setting the backdrop for the psychedelic killing spree the track becomes. Songs like \\"Halo\\" feature a piano tinged beat that gives a suspenseful twist, \\"giving the mixtape a feel that's halfway between Tyler, The Creator's Goblin and Eminem's The Slim Shady LP. \\"Vertigo\\" features an instrumental made of gunfire, murky slow-mo sound and horror-score synth. Earl Sweatshirt appears on \\"Bill\\", where Bruce Smith of HipHopDX said he stole the show. The instrumental of \\"72\\" features a xylophone along subtle drums under Miller's sociopathic rhymes. \\"The Jesuits\\" \\"revels in clever wordplay and outrageous rapper imagery.\\" \\"Melvin\\" is a \\"graphic tale of a conflicted rising star trying to figure out if the material goods and women really afford happiness.\\" On \\"Grandpa Used to Carry a Flask\\" Miller raps in his normal voice alongside his alter ego over a somber piano backdrop.\\"  Critical reception  Delusional Thomas was met with generally positive reviews from music critics. Jake Rohn of BET stated, \\"Regardless of who he is in any given moment, Mac Miller is one of the most lyrically gifted MCs in hip hop. He continues to add something new and different. Delusional Thomas' only drawback is that every song has a similar sound, but for the tatted up rhymer's true fans, it won't matter. This mixtape is not for the squeamish and definitely is not for those that only like Top 40 rap. For everyone else, it's hip hop noir at its finest. With only ten short songs, it's just the right amount of time to keep the listener fully engaged.\\" Bruce Smith of HipHopDX deemed the mixtape \\"EP- worthy\\" saying, \\"Getting past Mac Miller's bouts of immaturity and voice as \\"Delusional Thomas\\" is a chore and can be trying.

The tower has 348 residential units on 40 floors. History As part of the Rincon Hill Plan adopted in August 2005, the parcels at 340 Fremont and 350 Fremont were up-zoned for a single residential tower. Developed by Archstone Smith and Jackson Pacific Ventures, and initially designed by Heller Manus Architects, the development was approved for 332 residential units with 332 underground parking spaces by the San Francisco Planning Commission on June 15, 2006. Due to the United States housing market correction and the ensuing worldwide financial crisis, construction was delayed. During 2008 to 2013, a period of market recovery, the project received five consecutive 12-month extensions of its entitlements. In 2012, the project was redesigned by Handel Architects, and the number of units was increased to 348, while the number of parking spaces was reduced to 269. In 2013, the project entitlements were acquired by Equity Residential, with plans to break ground by the end of 2013. In late 2013, demolition and construction permits were issued but a neighboring homeowner association appealed the permits. In February 2014, the appeal was denied, clearing the way for construction to begin. Demolition of existing structures on the site began in March 2014. Ceremonial groundbreaking took place on April 24, 2014. The building was topped-out on October 22, 2015, and residents began moving in mid-2016. Design The project features 348 residential units, consisting of 91 studios, 119 one-bedrooms, and 138 two-bedrooms. 269 parking spaces will be located on three underground levels, primarily in stackers. The building will have an podium, topped with an outdoor terrace. The tower reaches a roof height of with a mechanical penthouse, resulting in a total structural height of . Previous structures on the site that were razed included a 3-story building at 340 Fremont Street, constructed in 1962, once occupied by the National Maritime Engineers Benefit Association, and 350 Fremont Street, constructed in 1952, which was previously occupied by the Seafarer's Union. To partially mitigate the loss of the \\"maritime labor historic context\\", the project will include a publicly accessible interpretive display in a midblock passage off Fremont Street.

The road is officially named the A5758 Broom's Cross Road, with Broom's Cross being the site of a medieval wayside cross near Thornton and the road numbering referencing the two motorways the road links to, the M57 and M58 motorway respectively. Discussions about the need for the road to be constructed date back to the construction of Switch Island junction, with numerous public consultations held throughout the years to ascertain public support and opinion on the need for the road and the alignment it would take. The consultations have produced favourable responses from the majority of respondents, with several different alignment suggestions being proposed over the years. Sefton Council gave their final approval in September 2013, with construction starting towards the end of the 2013 calendar year. The cost was in the region of £20.4 million, with the UK Government contributing £14.5M towards that and Sefton Council contributing £5.9M. The financial benefits over the 60 years following construction of the road has been estimated to be in the region of £140–200M. Development=Early proposals The need for an improved route between Switch Island and the main Southport Road was first identified as far back as 1968, during planning for the M57, M58, and M62 motorways. Shortly after the motorways opened, a number of proposals to allow traffic to bypass Thornton and Netherton were developed, given increased road traffic over the years that followed added to the congestion throughout Thornton. A Sefton Council environmental statement in 2010 made reference to the traffic congestion that had affected routes around the Thornton area for \\"many years\\", as well as the impacts to quality of life and the environment. In 1990, a detailed proposal known as the Blue Route was submitted for planning permission, which would have involved a dual carriageway road between Switch Island and the Formby Bypass. This proposal was ultimately rejected by then Secretary of State for Transport in May 1995 despite favourable public consensus, on the grounds it would have negative impact on greenbelt land and be detrimental to conservation areas and protected species. Public consultations Five years later in May 2000, a public consultation began which proposed six possible options, with the intention to understand the views and opinions of residents and businesses along the route between Thornton and Switch Island. Following feedback, six options were considered for possible highway construction, those being: alt=A picture showing a map of different routings of Option 5, which was a single carriageway road between Switch Island the A565 Southport Road * Option 1: Minimum approach involving maintenance and improved signage * Option 2: Switch Island Link Road and junction improvements at Brickwall Lane * Option 3: Co-ordinated improvements involving a Thornton bypass, Brickwall Lane enhancements and Switch Island Link Road * Option 4: Co-ordinated improvements involving a Thornton bypass, Netherton Relief Road and Switch Island Link Road * Option 5: Single carriageway road between Switch Island the A565 Southport Road * Option 6: Dual carriageway between Switch Island and Formby Bypass Of all the considered options, Option 5 performed well during the appraisal process and was identified as being the preferred option to pursue by Sefton Council. A further consultation was undertaken in 2003, during which questionnaires were distributed to ascertain resident and business viewpoints on the proposal identified in the 2000 consultation; it determined nearly 80% of respondents agreed for the need of a new road as proposed, with the majority of those questioned strongly agreeing. Of those that did not agree to the preferred option, nearly a third (30%) expressed concerns that the proposal may result in increased congestion, whilst a quarter (25%) expressed a preference for the route to be constructed as a dual carriageway. During a further consultation held 2006, local residents and businesses were sent another questionnaire asking them how strongly they agreed or disagreed with the proposed alignment and the need to restrict traffic levels and speeds once the proposed road had opened. Of the 12807 questionnaires that were sent, 10.9% were returned, with a further 100 completed at public exhibitions and online; the majority of responses were in agreement with the proposed alignment. Final decision Following the 2006 public consultation, the scheme for a single-carriageway link to Thornton was given high priority and accepted in July 2006 by the then-Secretary of State for Transport, Douglas Alexander. Funding was approved by the Department for Transport in February 2011 when Sefton Council accepted the terms and conditions that has been proposed. After two objections were raised regarding the compulsory purchase order needed to acquire the land on which the road was to be built, a public inquiry was held in October 2012. Subsequent to this, the government inspector approved the plans. Following Sefton Council giving their final approval in September 2013, construction was proposed to begin by early November 2013 for a period of around 12 months, with the financial benefits estimated to be in the region of £140-200 million over the 60 years post-construction. Construction Following the completion of land acquisition, contractors Balfour Beatty marked out the route of the bypass in October 2013 offering the first glimpse of where the road would be built. alt=Photo showing the Brickwall lane junction of the new road whilst being constructed, several months prior to opening Initial land works began in January 2014 with an expected completion date in the final quarter of 2014. In November 2014 it was reported that the project had been delayed due to poor weather and ground conditions, with the completion date pushed back to Spring 2015. Despite this, construction works to connect the new road to the main junction at Switch Island concluded by the end of December 2014, with the second phase of works taking place mostly throughout the night in January 2015 to minimise disruption. The road surface began to be laid in February 2015 with a revised opening of Spring 2015 forecast. Reports in March 2015 confirmed that due to frost and rainfall, the date of opening had been postponed to at least May 2015. After further slippage in the timescales, the opening date was revised from late June 2015 to 19 August 2015. The delay was explained as being due to needing to undertake additional work to stabilise the road foundation in two locations to make it suitable to lay tarmac on. The road finally opened on the evening of 19 August 2015, costing £20.4M in total, of which Sefton Council funded £5.9M (approximately 30%) of the cost.

The road has some sections on low embankment and others in shallow cutting where it runs close to existing residential properties, but is mostly close to existing ground level. Surface drainage is collected by a kerb and gully system and discharged into four new attenuation ponds. The route is only lit where there are specific safety reasons for doing so, such as at junctions and crossings along the route. There are no footways along the route other than specific pedestrian crossing points. The road starts at Switch Island junction, with direct connections to its namesake motorways (M57 and M58 respectively), as well as the A5036 and A59 roads which all converge at the junction. The road closely follows the route of the Northern Perimeter Road which is to its south, with the only major intersection being when it crosses the B5422 road. From there it continues in a northwest direction until it meets the A565 road, at a roundabout constructed as part of the scheme to improve efficiency for converging traffic. Operation Several months after opening in December 2015, a Sefton Council committee meeting recorded that the road was being very well used, with noticeably less traffic on the roads it was bypassing, those being the Northern Perimeter Road and Lydiate Lane respectively. It was subsequently reported in January 2016 that a section of the road would need to undergo a series of repair works during the evenings of a three-week period, just five months after the road opened to traffic. A year after opening, road users were giving generally positive feedback, with some confirming that travel times had been reduced and offers a more convenient means of accessing the motorways, although a common recurring concern were the junction issues at Switch Island. Since opening, there have been reports relating to an increased number of road traffic incidents at Switch Island, the main terminus of the A5758 road. Some road users have noted that a lack of clear road markings and signage may be a contributing factor towards the traffic collisions, whilst Sefton Council noted that they continue to review the operation of the road and associated junctions. Following continued incidents at the junction with Switch Island, the council confirmed in July 2016 that it was in talks with Highways England and Merseyside Police with Bill Esterson, MP for Sefton Central, calling for changes to be considered to the road to improve safety. Plans were announced in February 2016 which proposed a new £200M road could be built through Rimrose Valley to link directly into the A5758 road in an effort to reduce the heavy congestion on the A5036 road; Sefton Council rejected the proposal in March 2017, citing the desire to instead build a tunnel to overcome the congestion concerns.

Schwaben Creek is approximately long.U.S. Geological Survey. National Hydrography Dataset high-resolution flowline data. The National Map, accessed July 8th, 2020 The creek has two named tributaries, which both join Schwaben Creek fairly close to its mouth. The tributaries are called Middle Creek and Mouse Creek. Schwaben Creek flows through Upper Mahanoy Township, Washington Township, and Jackson Township. Nearly all of the creek's watershed is devoted to agricultural land and forests, although there is some development. Painted furniture also was made in the Schwaben Creek valley in the 18th and 19th centuries. The creek is in the ridge-and-valley geographical province. Course Schwaben Creek in its lower reaches Schwaben Creek starts in Mahanoy Township, south of Line Mountain. The creek flows westward through a valley, going past the communities of Leck Kill and Greenbrier before exiting Mahanoy Township. Upon exiting Mahanoy Township, Schwaben Creek flows into Washington Township. Shortly after entering Washington Township, the creek flows northwest to pass by the Himmels Church, where it picks up its tributary Middle Creek. It then flows westward past the community of Rebuck, and the Rebuck Church before turning southwest and then west again. The creek's valley begins getting wider as it passes St. Peters Church and leaves Washington Township. Schwaben Creek then enters Jackson Township, where it bends southwards, picking up Mouse Creek at the community of Red Cross. The creek then turns northwest and flows under Pennsylvania Route 225 to enter Mahanoy Creek. Tributaries Middle Creek is one tributary of Schwaben Creek. Middle Creek flows into Schwaben Creek approximately three quarters of the way from the source to the mouth. Mouse Creek is another tributary of Schwaben Creek. It has a drainage area of 7.1 square miles. The creek joins Schwaben Creek about half a mile from the latter creek's confluence with Mahanoy Creek. Watershed Schwaben Creek looking downstream in September 2015 in its middle reaches Townships in the Schwaben Creek watershed include Washington Township and Upper Mahanoy Township. The total area of the creek's watershed is 22.48 square miles. The watershed has a total of stream distance. Approximately 55% of the land in the Schwaben Creek watershed is devoted to agriculture.

The average annual rainfall over a 19-year period in the Schwaben Creek watershed is . The average annual runoff over a 19-year period in the watershed is . Almost all of the streams in the Schwaben Creek watershed are considered \\"impaired\\" by the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection. The exception is the headwaters of Schwaben Creek's tributary, Middle Creek. Schwaben Creek, along with Little Mahanoy Creek, are the only tributaries of Mahanoy Creek that are not affected by the mining industry. Geography and geology The average elevation in the Schwaben Creek watershed is above sea level. The creek and its entire watershed is located in the ridge-and-valley physiographic province. The rocks on the surface of the creek's watershed are primarily interbedded sedimentary rock. The main soil group is the C group. Erosion channels are present in impaired parts of the streams in the Schwaben Creek watershed. The streambanks of many streams in the watershed are also eroded. A rock formation consisting of coarse white or light gray sandstone on top of a layer of buff and yellow colored rock passes through the Schwaben Creek watershed. History Schwaben Creek used to also be known as Himmels Creek, or Greenbriar Creek. Schwaben Creek takes its name from the German region of Swabia (German: Schwaben). The name reflects the homeland of the area's settlers. A similarly named, but otherwise unrelated, Swabia Creek exists in Berks and Lehigh Counties, Pennsylvania, about 75 miles east of Schwaben Creek. A large number of furniture pieces were made in the Schwaben Creek valley in the very late 18th century and early 1800s. The furniture was made by Pennsylvania German inhabitants, including Johannes Mayer. The types of furniture included blanket chests, chests of drawers, and cupboards. The 2013 book Encyclopedia of American Folk Art called the furniture from the Schwaben Creek valley \\"the most exuberant and unique paint-decorated furniture\\". An eastward-running road between Sunbury and Paxtang Road (also known as Tulpehocken Road) was laid out in 1788. The road was long and was built by Andrew Reitz, Frederick Knoebel, George Pfeiffer, John Nicholas Hettrick, John Nicholas Snyder, and Michael Roth. Schwaben Creek has been recognized as an impaired watershed since 2002. Plants and animals Schwaben Creek is stocked with trout each year between February 15 and July 31. Livestock have access to parts of the creek. There are a total of twenty known species of fish in the creek near the community of Red Cross.

He was one of the first members of the Banu Sulaym to embrace Islam. He was falsely accused, allegedly by the poet Hassan ibn Thabit, of having an affair with Muhammad's wife Aisha after the two became separated from a Medina-bound caravan. Medieval reports about this affair are contradictory and the veracity of the incident has been questioned by historian Gautier H. A. Juynboll. Later, Safwan became a commander and moved from Medina to Basra during the Muslim conquest of that region. Afterward, he took part in the military campaigns against the Byzantines in al-Jazira (Upper Mesopotamia) and Armenia, where he is said to have been slain. However, other reports mention that he died decades later as governor of Armenia. Life=Early life Safwan ibn al-Mu'attal belonged to the Dhakwan clan of the large Banu Sulaym tribe.Lecker 1997, p. 817. His year of birth is not recorded in the sources.Juynboll 1995, p. 819. Most of the Sulaym inhabited the al-Harrah region and many members of the Dhakwan lived in the city of Mecca where they maintained close ties with the Quraysh; Safwan was an exception among the Dhakwan and lived in Medina. He converted to Islam just prior to the prophet Muhammad's expedition to the al-Muraysi well in 627.Juynboll 1995, p. 820. Safwan became the subject of a controversy following the expedition when he and Muhammad's wife Aisha became separated from the caravan returning to Medina. Rumors circulated that they had an illicit affair, but the allegations turned out to be false. Safwan blamed the well-known Arab poet Hassan ibn Thabit for spreading the rumor and is said to have struck him in the head with a sword out of anger. Hassan complained to Muhammad, who compensated him either by offering Hassan an Egyptian bride or a piece of land; in return, Sa'd ibn Ubadah, a prominent Muslim from Medina, made Hassan relinquish his demand for retribution against Safwan, who was essentially unpunished for his action. Historian Gautier H. A. Juynboll asserts that the veracity of the stories surrounding the alleged incident between Safwan, Aisha and Hassan ibn Thabit are \\"hard to establish; they may be no more than background embellishments of Safwan's role in the affair, assuming then that the tale is historically tenable\\". Commander in Jazira and Armenia After the Muslim conquest of Iraq, Safwan settled in the Arab military colony at Basra, in a neighborhood near the old market center of Mirbad. He became a commander in the Muslim conquests of al-Jazira (Upper Mesopotamia). According to Muslim historian al-Waqidi, in 639, Safwan commanded the left wing of Iyad ibn Ghanm's 5,000-strong army during the launch of a campaign to conquer al- Jazira; al-Waqidi further states that Khalid ibn al-Walid was part of Safwan's left wing, though other reports contradict this claim.Al-Baladhuri, ed. Hitti 1916, p. 270. When Iyad reached Harran, he dispatched Safwan and Habib ibn Maslama al-Fihri to subdue Samosata; after Safwan and Maslama captured several villages and forts in Samosata's vicinity, the townspeople negotiated terms of surrender with the Muslims guaranteeing their personal safety and no harm to their properties in exchange for a head tax and recognition of Muslim rule.Al- Baladhuri, ed. Hitti 1916, p. 273. When Uthman became caliph in 644 he made Mu'awiyah governor of all Syria, Jazira and the frontier areas of these provinces.Al-Baladhuri, ed. Hitti 1916, p. 287. Uthman directed Mu'awiyah to continue the conquest of Shimshat in Armenia, a task which he delegated to Safwan and Habib ibn Maslama. The latter two camped around the city for a few days and forced its surrender under terms similar to the capitulation of Samosata; other reports mention that Mu'awiyah himself led this campaign with Safwan and Habib acting as lieutenants. In either case, Mu'awiyah appointed Safwan governor of Shimshat. Later, Habib made a failed attempt to capture the Armenian fortress of Kamacha (Hisn Kamkh) from its Byzantine defenders; Safwan likewise failed in a subsequent assault against the fortress.Al-Baladhuri, ed. Hitti 1916, p. 288. However, in 678/79, Safwan's forces finally subdued Kamacha; a fellow member of the Sulaymi Dhakwan clan, Umayr ibn al-Hubab, played an integral role in Kamacha's capitulation. Reports vary widely regarding Safwan's year of death, with one mentioning that he died fighting in Armenia in 638, and other sources, including al-Waqidi, claiming that he died as governor of Armenia in 678/79.

Naomi Zeichner of The Fader praised the production of the song, writing, \\"Mike WiLL steps outside of his 'thunderous' signature all over Bangerz; on Someone Else and Drive, he approaches EDM on his own pop-rap terms, asking Cyrus' 'Jolene' twang and jackhammer buzz to serve his complex arrangements, rather than dropping some 808s on top of a dustep drop. 'Drive', which I favor, has no grandiose drop, just a stubborn pulse that gives the song its appealing undercurrent of ugly, tightly coiled strength.\\" Live performances An episode of MTV Unplugged starring Cyrus premiered through MTV on January 29, 2014; she performed an acoustic version of \\"Drive\\", among several additional tracks from Bangerz. The entire episode followed a theme inspired by country music; during \\"Drive\\" in particular, Cyrus was dressed in a matching jean jacket, bra, and pants set. A close-up of her face was shown for much of the performance, although the camera occasionally panned across the stage and revealed that Cyrus was seated on a wooden bench through the full song. Cyrus has performed the track during her ongoing Bangerz Tour. The performance received positive reviews from critics. While performing \\"Drive\\" during the first leg of the tour, Cyrus wore a black, floor-length Marc Jacobs gown with subtle sequined lightning stripes down the skirt, sheer black quarter-length sleeves, and a ruffly mock turtleneck. During the second leg of the tour, Cyrus wore a jewel-encrusted black jumpsuit designed by Roberto Cavalli.

The train was cut back to Decatur, Illinois, in 1968 and renamed City of Decatur. Amtrak did not retain the City of Decatur, and it made its last run on April 30, 1971.  History  The Wabash introduced a heavyweight Blue Bird on the Chicago–St. Louis run in 1938. The train was painted blue-gold, previously reserved for the Wabash's Banner Blue. The Wabash relaunched the Blue Bird as a streamlined train on February 26, 1950, with all-new Budd Company \\"Vista-Dome\\" dome cars and E-unit diesel locomotives from Electro-Motive Division. The new train carried Wabash's standard blue-gray-white livery. The Wabash referred to the Blue Bird as a \\"Domeliner\\" in contemporary advertising. Amenities on the new train included radio and \\"recorded musical programs\\"; coach passengers had access to the \\"Coffee Shop Club\\". The new equipment cost the Wabash ; it was the first dome train to operate between Chicago and St. Louis. The Norfolk and Western Railway leased the Wabash in 1964 but continued to operate the Blue Bird. This changed in 1968 when the N&W; truncated the Blue Bird to Decatur, Illinois, still departing from Chicago. This new service was named City of Decatur and operated until the formation of Amtrak in 1971.  Route  The Blue Bird used the Wabash's line between Chicago and St. Louis. In March 1950 northbound #24 departed St. Louis' Union Station at 8:55 AM and arrived at Chicago's Dearborn Station at 2:05 PM. The equipment set returned as southbound #21 the same day, departing Chicago at 4:45 PM and arriving in St. Louis at 10:10 PM. Intermediate stops included Englewood in Chicago, Forrest, Decatur, Taylorville, Litchfield and Granite City in Illinois, and the Wabash's Delmar Boulevard station in St. Louis itself. At the time two other Wabash trains operated on the route: the Banner Blue, which operated a reverse schedule, and the overnight Midnight.  Equipment  Interior of one of the \\"Vista-Dome\\" dome coaches on the Blue Bird. The 1950 lightweight consist included six cars: a baggage-lunch counter-lounge, three \\"Vista-Dome\\" dome coaches, a dining car, and a \\"Vista-Dome\\" dome parlor-observation car. The Budd Company manufactured all six cars, although the interior of the parlor- observation car was designed according to Pullman Plan #9525. Strong demand led the Wabash to add another dome parlor-lounge in 1952. Pullman-Standard delivered the car, which included the \\"Blue Bird Room\\", an eleven-seat private dining room.

His second came on 21 October in the group phase of the UEFA Champions League, in a 1–2 away loss to FC Porto. On 13 August 2015, he was loaned to CD Leganés in Segunda División in a season-long deal. On 17 August 2016, Guillermo terminated his contract with Athletic and signed a two-year contract with Elche CF just hours later. The following 27 June, after suffering relegation, he agreed to a three-year deal with fellow second tier club CD Numancia. On 10 January 2018, Guillermo scored twice to help to a 2–2 draw against Real Madrid at the Santiago Bernabéu Stadium for the Copa del Rey after having come as a first-half substitute, but the hosts had already won 3–0 in the first leg to progress to the quarter-finals.

Booklyn was founded, and continues to be governed by, artists.  History  Originally located in the Greenpoint neighborhood of Brooklyn, New York, Booklyn moved to the Brooklyn Army Terminal in Sunset Park, Brooklyn, New York in early 2018. This relocation included plans for new education and archives initiatives. Booklyn initially originated out of several artist run projects: The Artichoke Yink Press run by Christopher Wilde, a Bookmobile artist book distribution system run by Wilde and Shon Schooler, and a Tuesday night artist gathering at 70 Commercial Street in Greenpoint, Brooklyn. Marshall Weber, an original co-founder of Booklyn, remains involved as Directing Curator.  Activities  The work of Booklyn involves a wide range of activities: representing contemporary artists; cultivating a distribution network across international institutions that may acquire work by Booklyn artists for their collections; and curating exhibitions in its own gallery space as well as at other institutions. Education efforts at Booklyn involve lectures and workshops on various aspects of bookmaking, including bookbinding and zine-making. Educational materials are also distributed through resources such as the Booklyn Education Manual.Kulp, Louise A. “Teaching with Artists’ Books: An Interdisciplinary Approach for the Liberal Arts.” Art Documentation: Journal of the Art Libraries Society of North America, vol. 34, no. 1, 2015, pp. 101–123.

David Davis was born in Llanddeusant, Carmarthenshire, in 1797. At a young age, he went to Merthyr Tydfil, where he served an apprenticeship with a relative before opening his own business at Hirwaun. The business was successful and he soon became involved in small scale mining at Rhigos. This colliery (with its wharf at Briton Ferry near Neath) was sold in 1847, but by that time Davis had taken a lease of valuable steam-coal seams on the Blaengwawr estate at Aberaman. He sank a pit therein 1843, and transported the coal to Cardiff on the Glamorganshire Canal until the Taff Vale Railway was opened in 1847. At this time, Davis moved from Hirwaun to a house that he built at Blaengwawr. He also built another house, Maesyffynnon, for his son, David, who joined him in the business. Another son, Lewis, became sales agent in Cardiff. Davis was an active Wesleyan and, in 1837, was instrumental in the building of a new chapel at Soar, Hirwaun to replace an older chapel that was turned into cottages. When Davis moved the main focus of his business operation from Hirwaun to Blaengwawr he encouraged a number of his workmen to follow him, and he established the Wesleyan Chapel at Aberdare, which was largely frequented by his employees. In later life, Davis turned his attention to the Rhondda Fach valley, which at that time was almost entirely rural and uninhabited. After costly but at first unsuccessful sinkings, he finally struck a good seam at Ferndale. Early in 1866, with his four sons, he established 'Davis and Sons'. He was also active in public life as a member of the Aberdare Local Board of Health. David Davis was a good example of a self-made Welsh coal owner. He died on 18 May 1866 and was buried at St John's Cemetery, Aberdare.

He was also the first to declare that the ore brought back by Martin Frobisher from Baffin Island contained gold. Arrival in England Agnello described himself on the title page of a published work in 1566 as 'Giovanbatista Agnello Venetiano'; however the date of his arrival in England from his native Venice is unknown. According to Castells, he was among a number of 'Protestant men of learning who came to London as a result of the Reformation'.Castells, Justin V., \\"Frozen assets: Science, natural philosophy, and the quest for arctic gold\\" (2009).

However Jones states that Agnello did not arrive in England until 1569. According to Harkness, he lived in the parish of St Helen's Bishopsgate, and operated a 'dangerous blast furnace' there. What is known with certainty is that Agnello was recommended to Sir William Cecil by Jean de Ferrieres (1520–1586), the Vidame of Chartres,Jean II de Ferrières, vidame de Chartres et seigneur de Maligny (1520–1586) Retrieved 11 November 2013.The translator Richard Eden was for many years in the Vidame's service; . who on 4 November 1569 wrote to Cecil from Holborn commending Agnello as 'a man of honest and industry'. With his letter, the Vidame sent Cecil a copy of Agnello's book, saying that he wished it had been printed on cleaner paper, 'but that of dusky hue best suits the works of Vulcanicorum hominum'.'Elizabeth: November 1569', Calendar of State Papers Foreign, Elizabeth, Volume 9: 1569–1571 (1874), pp. 140–147 Retrieved 9 November 2013.

Frobisher voyages The Northwest Passage Martin Frobisher At the beginning of January 1577 Agnello was approached by Michael Lok, one of the principal backers of Martin Frobisher's first voyage in 1576 to the Canadian Arctic in search of the Northwest Passage. On the voyage a black stone 'as great as a half-penny loaf' had been collected loose on the surface of Hall's Island off Baffin Island by Robert Garrard, who took it to be sea coal, of which they had need.Garrard was one of five men captured by the Inuit several days later; . In a letter to the Queen on 22 April 1577 Lok stated that the stone was presented to him on Frobisher's ship on 13 October 1576 in the presence of Rowland Yorke as 'the first thing Frobisher had found in the new land'. The only contemporary account of what happened next is found in George Best's True Discourse:A True Discourse, Early English Books Online Retrieved 13 November 2013. > After his arrival in London, being demanded of sundry his friends what thing > he had brought them home of that country, [Frobisher] had nothing left to > present them withal but a piece of this black stone. And it fortuned a > gentlewoman, one of the adventurer’s wives, to have a piece thereof, which > by chance she threw and burned in the fire so long that at the length being > taken forth and quenched in a little vinegar it glistered with a bright > marquesset of gold. Whereupon the matter being called in some question, it > was brought to certain goldfinders in London to make assay thereof, who > indeed found it to hold gold, and that very richly for the quantity. > Afterwards the same goldfinders promised great matters thereof if there were > any store to be found, and offered themselves to adventure for the searching > of those parts from whence the same was brought. Some that had great hope of > the matter sought secretly to have a lease at her Majesty’s hands of those > places, whereby to enjoy the mass of so great a public profit unto their own > private gains. In conclusion, the hope of the same gold ore to be found > kindled a greater opinion in the hearts of many to advance the voyage again. Best does not identify the adventurer's wife; modern sources conclude that she was Michael Lok's second wife, Margery Perient (died c.1583), the widow of Cesare Adelmare, a Venetian like Agnello.Caesar, Julius (1558–1636), of Tottenham, Middlesex and Mitcham, Surrey, History of Parliament Retrieved 12 November 2013. Doubt has been cast on Best's account, however, since there is no mention of Margery Lok's involvement in the voluminous depositions and letters of Michael Lok himself.George Best, Canadian Museum of Civilization Retrieved 13 November 2013. Irrespective of whether the story of Lok's wife's actions is to be believed, extant documents confirm that Lok suspected that the stone might contain gold, and took pieces of it for analysis to William Williams, Assay Master of the Mint, and to two members of the Worshipful Company of Goldsmiths: one Wheeler, a gold refiner, and George Needham, Assay Master of the Society of the Mines Royal, none of whom found any trace of gold. Despite these negative results Lok persisted, and in early January 1577 took three small pieces of the stone to Agnello, as described in one of Lok's later depositions: > In the beginning of January I delivered a small piece thereof to John > Baptista Agnello, not telling what nor from whence, but prayed him to prove > what metal was therein. And within three days I came to him for answer. He > showed me a very little powder of gold, saying it came thereout, and willed > me to give him another piece to make a better proof. I did so, and within > three days again he showed me more powder of gold. I told him I would not > believe it without better proof. He asked another piece to make a better > proof, saying that he would make anatomy thereof. I gave it him saying that > I marvelled much of his doings sith I had given pieces to other 3 to make > proof who could find no such thing there. He answered me, Bisogna sapere > adulare la natura.One must needs know how to coax nature; . Lok was secretly reporting the results of the assays to Sir Francis Walsingham, who had Sir Edward Dyer analyse a sample of the ore. Dyer found no gold, confirming Walsingham in his view that Agnello's results were 'but an alchemist matter'. Agnello and Lok were not discouraged; Agnello advised Lok that he had a 'friend in the court' who would move the Queen to grant them a licence to mine the ore, and on 19 March 1557 Lok and Agnello entered into an agreement for bringing back to England more ore like the original black stone. However, by then the secret had leaked out, largely through Agnello's own indiscretion. Sir William Winter asked to meet with Lok on 29 March, and revealed that he had learned of Agnello's assays of the ore from Sir William Morgan, who had had the news from Sir John Berkeley, who had had it from Agnello himself. Moreover, not only had Agnello communicated his findings to Berkeley, but he had been assisted in some of his tests by Christopher Schutz,Often referred to in contemporary documents as Jonas Schutz. a German metallurgist working in London who had been introduced to Agnello by Berkeley and Morgan. According to Winter, the matter was of too great importance for himself and Lok, and fit only for 'the Prince'. In a lengthy letter dated 22 April 1577 Lok outlined all these matters to the Queen, and enclosed therewith six 'writings' to him from Agnello, as well as a copy of the contract signed by himself and Agnello. Agnello was later involved in assaying the tons of black ore brought back to England on Frobisher's second voyage to Baffin Island in 1577. Between 1 November 1577 and 6 March 1578 Christopher Schutz performed three 'great proofes' of this ore. Agnello and another German metallurgist working in England, Burchard Kranich, also assayed the ore. Kranich and Schutz were soon at odds, with Schutz accusing Kranich, who was favoured by Martin Frobisher, of 'evil manners and ignorance'. Numerous documents survive showing Kranich's involvement in the assaying of the ore, including a letter of 26 November 1577 in which Kranich reported to Sir Francis Walsingham on the amount of gold found in his tests. Amid growing doubts about the value of the ore, Kranich insisted that it contained a significant amount of gold, and asked for £200 and a daily wage of £1 to refine it. On 20 December 1577 Agnello submitted his own report to Walsingham on the amount of gold to be found in the ore. According to Castells an English alchemist named George Wolfe was then brought in to assist Agnello; there were disagreements as to methodology, after which Agnello was 'shut out of the enterprise'.Other sources do not state that Wolfe was Agnello's assistant; . Despite the favourable findings of Schutz, Kranich and Agnello, the hornblende ore from Baffin Island contained no gold, and it was later alleged by Robert Denham, who had assisted Kranich with his tests, that Kranich had added gold and silver coins of his own to bring the projected value of the refined ore to £50 per ton. The story that Kranich allegedly doctored the assay tests is found in a deposition to the Privy Council by Michael Lok;PRO SP 12/122/62. in the deposition Lok claims that the evidence of Kranich's fraud was presented to Lord Burghley at his house in the Strand in the presence of Lok, Sir Walter Mildmay, and all the Commissioners involved in supervising the Frobisher expeditions. Modern research has confirmed that the 1,400 tonnes of ore brought back to England from Baffin Island in 1577 and 1578 were not gold- bearing. Moreover, the original black stone on which Agnello conducted his tests in January 1577 had been found on Hall's Island during the 1576 voyage; according to Michael Lok's account, no ore was discovered during a search of Hall's Island on the second voyage of 1577, and Frobisher 'never after brought home one stone more of that rich ore which he brought in the first voyage, for there was none of it to be found'. Despite having been the first to declare that the ultimately worthless ore contained gold, Agnello appears to have survived the Frobisher debacle relatively unscathed. Investors, including a number of prominent courtiers, among them Edward de Vere, 17th Earl of Oxford, who invested £3,000,'East Indies: December 1577', Calendar of State Papers Colonial, East Indies, China and Japan, Volume 2: 1513–1616 (1864), pp. 27–30 Retrieved 4 November 2013. lost heavily, and the lawsuits which followed ruined Michael Lok. Agnello's date of death is unknown. Literary works In 1566 Agnello published in London his Espositione di Giouanbatista Agnello Venetiano sopra vn libro intitolato Apocalypsis spiritus secreti,Espositione di Giouanbatista Agnello Venetiano sopra vn libro intitolato Apocalypsis spiritus secreti Retrieved 11 November 2013. only the second book in Italian printed in England. The original work was an eight-page book in Latin, which Agnello translated into Italian and elaborated with his own commentary. According to Linden, Agnello's purpose in the work is to explain the world soul in alchemical terms. Agnello's 1566 publication was translated into English in 1623 as A Revelation of the Secret Spirit, with a dedication to John Thornborough, Bishop of Worcester. The translator, 'R.N.E., gentleman', is thought to be Robert Napier. On the title page of the 1623 publication Agnello is referred to as 'John Baptista Lambye',Agnello, Giovan Battista, A Revelation of the Secret Spirit, Early English Texts Online Retrieved 11 November 2013. which has on occasion resulted in the mistaken attribution of the 1566 publication to a Venetian named 'Giovanni Lambi'.

The MCTP communication model includes a message format, transport description, message exchange patterns, and operational endpoint characteristics. MCTP's underlying buses include SMBus / I2C, serial links, PCI Express and USB. Simplified nature of the protocol and reduced encapsulation overheads make MCTP suitable for implementation and processing within system firmware and integrated baseboard management controllers (BMCs), on a wide range of platforms including servers, workstations and embedded devices. For example, Intel's network interface controllers (NICs) include support for MCTP over PCI Express and SMBus since 2012, allowing these NICs to be controlled and monitored at a low level over MCTP. Exposed configuration and monitoring operations include power management, control of Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) offloading, configuration of the out-of-band management traffic (which can be separated from the Ethernet traffic visible to the operating system by using RMCP ports filtering, a separate MAC address, or through VLAN tagging), and handling of NIC's interrupts and error conditions.

Directed by Harold S. Bucquet, it stars Lew Ayres as the young Dr. Kildare and Lionel Barrymore as Dr. Gillespie, his mentor. The second of MGM's series of Kildare films, it introduces Laraine Day as nurse Mary Lamont, the love of Kildare's life. Plot Dr. Leonard Gillespie, the crusty senior diagnostician at New York's Blair General Hospital, has a severe disagreement with pupil, intern James Kildare, over a suspected case of Q fever. He decides to teach his stubborn assistant a lesson in dealing with the emotional causes of his patients' ills as well as the physical. To accomplish this, he fires Kildare and has him reassigned to work in a neighborhood dispensary with nurse Mary Lamont, whom he enlists with the aid of head nurse Molly Byrd to \\"stooge\\" on the intern. On the day that Kildare begins his new job, young Red enters the dispensary and confidentially asks the intern to help an injured friend, Nick Lewett. He follows Red to a cellar hideout where he discovers that Nick is suffering from a gunshot wound. Kildare is on the verge of sending Nick on to Blair when Nick's sister Rosalie convinces him not to do so. Against hospital procedure and the law requiring reporting of all gunshots to the police, Kildare continues to treat Nick in the hideout, even after he knows that the boy is wanted for the murder of bookmaker \\"Footsy\\" Garson over a gambling debt. Smitten with Rosalie, he tells Mary he knows that she's been reporting back to Gillespie on his activities. Despite Mary's resistance, Gillespie uses her obvious admiration for Kildare to persuade her to tell him what Kildare is up to, and tries to warn the intern that he is flirting with being an accessory to murder. He tries to persuade Kildare to at least reveal Nick's whereabouts, but Kildare is sure of Nick's innocence and refuses to do so. A worried Gillespie arranges with Kildare's mother to call him home to help his physician father with a difficult patient, but when the intern returns, he is picked up by the police along with Nick. For his involvement, Kildare is yet again suspended from the hospital staff but remains determined to prove Nick's innocence. Learning from Nick that he went to see Garson after his friend Tom Crandell accused Garson of maligning Rosalie, Kildare decides to confront Crandell. With the help of ambulance driver Joe Wayman and his persuasive monkey wrench, Kildare compels Crandell into confessing that he killed Garson and shot Nick, suspicious of his relationship with Rosalie, to frame him. After Nick is exonerated, Gillespie visits Rosalie and deduces that she was Crandell's girl friend. He steers her into admitting to Kildare that her only interest in him was to save her brother, and later confesses to Kildare that he arranged for Nick's arrest but that Kildare almost ruined the plan by returning from home. A little wiser, Kildare resumes as Dr. Gillespie's assistant and begins to look at Nurse Lamont in a better light.

In late 2012, STX Finland was bidding for the construction of the third Oasis- class cruise ship for Royal Caribbean International in Turku shipyard and the funding of the two cruise ships for TUI Cruises was tied to this contract due to the difficult financial situation of the Finnish shipbuilder. However, after the shipyard failed to obtain a 50 million euro emergency loan from the Finnish Government and the contract for the world's largest cruise ship was awarded to STX France, there was a danger that the Turku shipyard could face bankruptcy unless it could quickly re-negotiate funding for the vessels, the first of which had been laid down on 12 December 2012 under the name \\"Newbuilding 1383\\".Turun telakka vararikon partaalla – kaksi alustilausta vaakalaudalla.

The inscription, dating to the early medieval period, commemorates \\"Rialobranus son of Cunovalus.\\" Location Mên Scryfa stands near the Madron to Morvah road in Cornwall. It stands in the middle of a field.Bernard Deacon, (2010), Exploring Cornwall's Past, page 56. The prehistoric Mên-an-Tol standing stones lie about 300 metres to the south. Description The stone is 1.7 metres high and roughly rectangular in section, with sides of 0.4 metres by 0.5 metres.MEN SCRYFA, Pastscape, retrieved 9 November 2013 The inscription is on the northern face, although the bottom of the inscription is buried in the ground. At one time two plain crosses were said to be viewable at the upper end of the stone. The horizontal axis of the lower cross, is clearly visible but the vertical stroke is very indistinct. The smaller cross above this can no longer be distinguished. The inscription The inscription, in debased Roman capitals, reads \\"Rialobrani Cunovali fili\\", which translates as \\"Rialobranus son of Cunovalus.\\" Rialobran is not known elsewhere, but he may have been a Cornish petty king or tribal leader. Rialobran (or Ryalvran) may be Cornish for \\"royal raven\\", whereas Cunovallos may be British for \\"famous leader\\" (being cognate to the second element in the surname McConnell), thus the inscription would read \\"royal raven son of famous leader.Tom Clare, (1982), Archaeological sites of Devon and Cornwall, page 24. Antiquarians, at one time, used to identify Cunovalus with the pre-Roman British king Cunobeline.William Henry Kearley Wright, (1886), The Western Antiquary, Volume 5, page 68 Dating The inscription has been dated on stylistic grounds to the 5th to 8th century AD. It is thought, however, that the stone itself could be a prehistoric standing stone. History The antiquarian William Borlase described the stone in 1769: at that time it was lying prostrate on the ground. It was erected in 1825 only to be toppled again in 1849 by treasure hunters. It was lying face down when John Thomas Blight described it in 1861.John Thomas Blight, (1861), A Week at the Land's End, pages 19-21 It was however re-erected in its current position around 1862, the last word of the inscription being buried. In folklore A popular tradition stated that a battle was fought nearby, and that Riolbranus was slain and buried at the spot. It was further claimed that the length of the stone (about 9 feet) was the exact height of the warrior. Possible identification When consulting Peter Bartrum's A Welsh Classical Dictionary there are two men with connection to the area who bear the name Cynwal the Brittonic rendering of Cunovalus. Both occur within the same genealogy one being Cynwal Garnwch son of Amlawdd Wledig the other being Amlawdd's father Cynwal son of Ffrwdwr. As such according to the genealogies Rialobrani modernised as Rialfran or Rialbran could either be a cousin to King Arthur as son of Cynwal Garnwch or his grand uncle as son of Cynwal son of Ffrwdwr. This is because Amlawdd Wledig is the maternal grandfather of Arthur according to genealogical tradition.

It likely consists of a black hole and a companion star. It is one of the brightest X-ray sources in the region around the Galactic Center. The object was first detected in soft X-rays by the Einstein Observatory and later detected in hard X-rays by the Soviet Granat space observatory. Followup observations by the SIGMA detector on board Granat showed that the object was a variable emitter of massive amounts of photon pairs at 511 keV, which usually indicates the annihilation of an electron- positron pair. This led to the nickname, \\"Great Annihilator.\\" Early observations also showed a spectrum similar to that of the Cygnus X-l, a black hole with a stellar companion, which suggested that Great Annihilator was also a stellar mass black hole. The object also has a radio source counterpart that emits jets approximately 1.5 pc (5 ly) long. These jets are probably synchrotron emission from positron-electron pairs streaming out at high velocities from the source of antimatter. Modeling of the observed precession of these jets gives an object distance of approximately 5 kpc (or 16,000 ly). This means that while the object is likely located along our line of sight towards the center of the Milky Way, it may be closer to us than Sagittarius A*, the black hole at the center of our galaxy.

Mertz Library is a research library located at the New York Botanical Garden in the Bronx, New York City. Founded in 1899 and renamed in the 1990s for LuEsther Mertz, it is the United States' largest botanical library, and was the first library whose collection focused exclusively on botany. The library contains large collections of books relating to botany and horticulture, and are used for studies in fields such as history, anthropology, landscape and building design, architectural history, ethnobotany, economic botany, urban social history, and environmental policy. The library contains current scholarly books and serials, as well as many rare and historically important works. The library building was designed in 1896 by Robert W. Gibson in the Renaissance Revival style and constructed in 1898-1901. The structure, originally known as the Museum Building and later known as the Administration Building, is four stories tall and contains a facade of gray-buff brick with buff terracotta. A sculptural fountain called the Fountain of Life, as well as a tree-lined avenue called the Tulip Tree Allee, is located outside the front entrance. In 2009 the library building, fountain, and avenue were made a New York City designated landmark.  History = Establishment  An act of the New York State Legislature, passed in 1891, set aside land within Bronx Park in the north-central part of the Bronx for the creation of the New York Botanical Garden (NYBG) on the condition that a board of directors raised $250,000 for the site. Prominent civic leaders and financiers agreed to match the City's commitment to finance the buildings and improvements. By May 1895, sufficient funds had been raised, but the plans for the NYBG had not been finalized. The Board of Directors then asked landscape architect Calvert Vaux and his partner, Parks Superintendent Samuel Parsons Jr., to consult on site selection. A topographical survey was completed in March 1896. As part of the topographical survey, a three-story museum with of space was planned for the grounds of the NYBG, near the main entrance at Southern Boulevard and Bedford Park Boulevard. It would be the first museum in the U.S. with a collection focused specifically and exclusively on botany. The board selected the museum site for its hilltop location east of the Botanical Garden station of the New York Central Railroad (now Metro-North Railroad), which made the building easily accessible from other locations. A design contest for the museum was held, attracting firms and architects like Ernest Flagg, William Appleton Potter, N. Le Brun & Sons, Parish & Schroeder, and Clinton & Russell. Robert W. Gibson won the commission and filed building plans with the New York City Department of Buildings in November 1896. In January 1897, the city authorized the NYBG to proceed with construction of the museum.  Construction  By July 1897, construction was delayed due to disputes over whether the presence of the museum and the NYBG conservatory would detract from the naturalistic look of the rest of the garden. The magazine American Architect and Architecture, calling these objections \\"an unfortunate controversy\\", stated that the New York City parks commissioners had already hired the respective architects for the museum and conservatory, and were applying for construction funds for both projects. The New York City Board of Estimate again blocked the $500,000 appropriation in mid-September 1897, citing the concerns about the building's aesthetics and possible cost overruns, before approving it at the end of that month. A request for bids was opened, and 12 contractors submitted construction bids the following month, with the John H. Parker Company submitting the least expensive bid. After the city invalidated these bids, another request for proposals was opened. Seven contractors submitted bids, of which Parker's was again the cheapest. A groundbreaking ceremony was held on December 31, 1897, to mark the start of construction. By May 1898, construction had started on the brick walls. By September 1898, according to The New York Times, the steel frame was 75% finished and the exterior walls had been built up to the second floor. The city approved the disbursement of another $200,000 in bonds that November. A contract to build the \\"front central portico\\" was carried out between July and October 1899. According to a Brooklyn Daily Eagle article in March 1900, the building had \\"just been completed\\". The NYBG's contract with John H. Parker ended the next month, with work on the end pavilions' ornamentation being delayed.  After completion  The avenue leading to the NYBG Museum's front entrance The library initially had 2,500 volumes, and in 1899, another five thousand volumes were donated from the botanical collection of Columbia College. In April 1901, Wilson & Baillie Manufacturing were contracted to build the fountain at the Museum Building's main entrance, as well as the front approaches and cornice ornamentation. The library's collection grew over the years, and by 1926, an annex was being planned for the Museum Building. However, no progress was made on this proposal, except for the rearrangement of the building's interior. Then in 1958, Eggers & Higgins proposed a $1 million, three-story annex behind the existing structure, with a similar design to the original building. The wing was to include classrooms, conference rooms, offices, and reading rooms. In 1964, Mayor Robert F. Wagner Jr. approved the construction of the annex, with the city and NYBG contributing equal amounts toward the cost. The original rear wing behind the central pavilion was destroyed. The annex was dedicated as the Harriet Barnes Pratt Library Wing in late 1965, after a notable NYBG benefactor, and opened in 1966. Additionally, the original building's front staircase and its balustrade and sidewalls were renovated in 1960-1961. The Science and Education Building was built between 1969 and 1972 to a design by William and Geoffrey Platt, and was dedicated to Jeannette Kittredge Watson. By February 1988, the herbarium had taken up all of the vacant space in the original structure, including rooms formerly dedicated to exhibitions. As a result, NYBG officials planned for a four-story expansion to the east of the original building's north wing. At the time, the expanded wing was set to open in 1991. A three-month restoration of the rotunda was completed in November 1988, and a new orchid terrarium was dedicated. The addition of the northern annex was delayed in 1992, when the NYBG announced that the annex would cost $32 million and be completed in 1994. A one-story annex to the south, housing the herbarium specimens, was designed by Coe Lee Robinson Roesch and finished in 1994. During the mid-1990s, the library was renamed after LuEsther Mertz, a major NYBG donor. When plans for the northern annex were finalized in 1997, the project was expected to cost $39 million. Polshek Partnership designed the structure, known as the International Plant Science Center. The addition comprised nine new research rooms; herbarium and library space; a new entrance to the basement lecture hall and library; and the renovation of in the existing structure. The original building's rotunda was restored as well. Construction started in 1998, and though the expansion was originally supposed to be complete in 2000, the opening was ultimately delayed until 2002. Upon the annex's opening, the library collections and the Steere Herbarium were relocated to the new annex, and the Museum Building was renamed the Library Building.  Architecture  The original Mertz Library building was designed by Robert W. Gibson and its main facade is long. The side facades, as noted in the building plans, measured on one end and on the other. Designed in the Renaissance Revival style, it consists of a central pavilion topped by a dome, and two side wings. The Mertz Library was built upon an uneven topography, such that the basement is at the same elevation with the ground to the east, north, and south of the library, while the first floor is level with the ground to the west. The building consists of four annexes. The International Plant Science Center is located east of the northern wing and faces Southern Boulevard to the north. The Jeannette Kittredge Watson Science and Education Building is located east of the southern wing, while a one-story annex is located to the south. The Harriet Barnes Pratt Library Wing is located behind the original building to the east of the center pavilion.  Exterior  The front facade The original building's facade consists of buff and gray brick interspersed with terracotta decoration. The windows are largely rectangular, except for those on the second floor, which contains round-arched window openings with balustrades at their bases. The third story consists of a mansard roof with dormer windows corresponding to the vertical architectural bays below them. The architectural bays are separated by projecting pilasters topped with Corinthian-style pediments. A cornice runs the length of the second story. A glass dome is located over the third-story rotunda, rising above the third floor. On the front (west) side, the building contains a horizontal articulation. The central pavilion contains rustication and a pediment supported by four Corinthian columns, which divide the central pavilion into three bays. At the first floor level, there are three sets of doors, one in each bay. The end sections also have pilasters in the Corinthian style. Above the central bay is an entablature containing the seal of New York City, while smaller entablatures with the seals of New York state and the United States are located on the left and right bays. On the third story, above the center bay, there is a cartouche of the New York Botanical Garden. The steps leading to the entrance bays are made of granite, and the sidewalls are made of brick with granite coping. The pavilions on the side also contain service entrances on the first floor, located under an arched transom. The side and rear facades are similar, but contain windows on the basement as well. On the rear (east) side, four window bays on the northern portion are visible from the outside, and the four southernmost window bays are also visible. The remaining window bays cannot be seen from the outside due to the presence of the annexes. There is an entrance to the ground/basement level from the northern portion of the rear facade. The side facades to the north and south were originally five bays wide. On the south side, all five window bays are intact, but a former archway to the basement has been filled in, and a covered passageway from that arch leads to the one-story annex. On the north side, only the westernmost three bays can be seen from the outside, while the eastern two bays have been hidden by the presence of the International Plant Science Center. = Annexes = Entrance to the Harriet Barnes Pratt Library wing The International Plant Science Center is five stories high, including the basement, and contains a windowless sand-colored facade. Original plans called for it to also include a green wall on the facade. The Harriet Barnes Pratt Library Wing is six stories high and has a similar exterior design to the original library building. The Jeannette Kittredge Watson Science and Education Building is four stories high. The building is constructed of steel frame with a glass facade interspersed with aluminum and green spandrels.  Interior  The original building is constructed with a steel frame and concrete floors. The basement contains the Arthur and Janet Ross Lecture Hall, which has a capacity of 400. An economic botany museum was developed on the first floor, and a general botany museum with exhibits on plant families was located on the second floor. The economic botany museum was developed in 1907 and later split into two sections: the economic/food plants and the plant- families sections. The third floor contained a library with a reading room, stacks, herbaria, and laboratories for plant embryology and taxonomy. After a 2002 renovation, the library also included a wooden reference desk and a 50-seat study room. Since the International Plant Science Center's opening, the library collections and herbarium have been located in that building. The William & Lynda Steere Herbarium, located inside the International Plant Science Center, is one of the largest herbaria in the world, with approximately 7.2 million to 7.8 million specimens. The Science and Education Building contains offices, educational and environmental facilities, and a greenhouse used to simulate environments for plants. It is connected to the original building by a passage at its northwest end, and is used by the NYBG's School of Professional Horticulture. Herbarium specimens are stored in the one-story annex that connects directly to the south wing of the original building.  Associated structures =Fountain of Life Fountain of Life The Fountain of Life, in front of the library's main entrance, was designed by Carl Tefft and completed in 1905. The central focus of the fountain are the heroic nude sculpted figures atop a granite pedestal. These figures include two horses, both with webbed forefeet; a female sitting astride one of the horses; a boy attempting to control the other horse while holding a fish; and another boy sitting on a dolphin's back. Within the basin of the fountain is a bronze merman on a crab, and a bronze mermaid, both with startled expressions. At the time of Fountain of Life's commission, there were very few statues of horses with webbed forefeet. One observer wrote that \\"It was conceived in the spirit of Italian baroque fountains, with the surging movement of galloping horses and muscular riders.\\"Proske, Beatrice Gilman, Brookgreen Gardens Sculpture, Brookgreen Gardens, SC, 1968 p. 150 The fountain and statue were included in the original plans for the Museum Building in 1897, but except for the granite pedestal, the statue was not completed with the original building in 1900. That year, NYBG held a design contest for the proposed bronze statue, but all of the submitted designs were rejected. NYBG then asked the National Sculpture Society to appoint a committee, which would review submissions for a second fountain-designing competition. Of the 15 proposals submitted in early 1903, Tefft's design was deemed the best, and he was selected for the commission. Thereafter, Roman Bronze Works of Greenpoint, Brooklyn, was selected to cast the sculpture in December 1904. The statue was completed in May 1905 and installed that July. The Fountain of Life was initially circled by a driveway on all sides, but the western part of that driveway (in front of the fountain) was turned into an unpaved pedestrian path in 1961. The fountain was cleaned in 1968 after a period of deterioration, by which point the plinth and basin had started to crack, and the mermaid, merman, and part of the crab claw had been removed. In 2005, the mermaid, merman, and claw figures were replaced, and a bronze book was placed within the basin. At that time, the fountain was named for Lillian Goldman, a prominent donor.  Avenue  In 1901, a contract was given to Wilson & Baillie Manufacturing Company for the paving and grading of a road and tree-lined avenue leading to the museum building. This was completed in 1902. The contract also called for a seating area and a drinking fountain tall, located at the avenue's western end. These were removed in the 1950s with the construction of a laboratory building at that site. Other components of the avenue included Carolina poplars, planted in 1903, and tulip trees, planted in 1905 between each pair of poplars. The poplars were removed by 1911. The paths were re-graded in 1904 and now have benches, an asphalt surface, and concrete curbs. Head librarians * D.T. MacDougal (acting librarian, 1899)J.

A 2002 New York Times article mentioned that the library had 775,000 items and 6.5 million plant specimens in its collection. Furthermore, the Times stated that the Mertz Library had 75% of all systematic botany literature in the world and 70% of all floras that had been published, as well as the NYBG's rare-art collection. However, a book published in 2014 by the NYBG mentioned that the library had \\"550,000 physical volumes and 1,800 journal titles\\". the Mertz Library still contained one of the world's largest collections of botany-related texts. Stephen Sinon, who leads the NYBG's special collections, research and archives, called its collection \\"the largest of its kind in the world under one roof\\". The collection grew both through the purchase of books and through the donation of significant botanical and horticultural libraries from notable botanists, gardeners, scientists and book collectors.Callery, Bernadette G.

It was home to the daughter of Joseph Lane and generations of descendants of the Lane family until it was donated to the Douglas County Historical Society in 1960, following damage sustained in the Roseburg Blast of 1959. The Lane family intended the gift as a memorial to Joseph Lane and family. Aaron and Sarah Rose, for whom Roseburg is named, sold an acre of their 1851 Donation Land Claim to Solomon and Hyman Abraham in 1860. The Abraham brothers purchased an additional acre from Rose in 1861. Speculation exists about whether the Floed–Lane House had already been constructed on the property purchased by the Abraham brothers. In 1866, Roseburg merchant John Creed Floed and his wife, Sarah Emily Lane, daughter of Joseph Lane, purchased an acre from the Abrahams, and the house was part of the transaction.

The book is one of the titles in Tusen svenska klassiker, a book listing a thousand significant Swedish cultural works chosen by journalists Jan Gradvall, Björn Nordström and Ulf Nordström. Book cover The book cover depicts Sune wearing a red sweater. Plot Sune Andersson is 7 years old, and attends the 1st grade. Sune is a so-called tjejtjusare (\\"girl charmer\\"), but mostly he likes Sophie in the same class at school. They have known each other since being very small. Despite hanging with Sophie, Sune also goes to school, plays with his friend Joakim Fröberg, and fights with his little brother \\"Håkan Bråkan\\", who for example has bitten the legs off Sune's Donald Duck toy figures. The book opens with a presentation of the main characters. One Friday when walking to school, Sune gets \\"Goddag, goddag- sjukan\\", a disease where the affected can only say \\"God dag, god dag\\" (\\"Good day, good day\\"), even if the disease always comes to an end later. Sune writes a note to his mother. When coming to school, Sune tries to avoid answering questions. He is exposed during the Swedish lesson, when required to answer a question. His schoolteacher said she cured the disease with curiosity. In the nearby forest, a \\"war\\" (using cones) has broken out during a break, where the 1st graders and the 2nd graders fight the 3rd graders. Sune is about to free Daniel, but ends up in trouble with 3rd grader Bengt, who chases him until he is saved by the bell. Sune also hangs out with Sophie, and one morning Håkan wakes him up by tugging on his lashes. Håkan also breaks Sune's guitar apart. Sune responds by throwing pillows. During their own time, the children play ball games at the apartment blocks, and even older kids attend the games, including those from the higher stage of the Swedish primary school. Cathrin Åkerlund in class 5 A counts, och captures several people, but when capturing Sophie Sune tries to free her. Sune kicks the ball, which crashes into the apartment of a man called \\"Gäckande skuggan\\". He has sailed the seas, and rumors say his wife and children have disappeared. Joakim requires Sune to go picking up the ball. Sophie is not afraid and goes with Sune, and it soon turns out there is no \\"Gäckande skuggan\\", just Alvin Hjalmar Edwin Gren who is not dangerous at all. He tells about his seaman life, and about being thrown into prison in Tunis after fighting with a Greek over a girl, and that it was his wife and children who left him. Sune feels pleased over knowing the truth. When Sune's school class go to swimming lessons, they travel by bus to the pool. Sune feels ashamed of not knowing how to swim, and when the class is split up between pupils who know how to swim and those who do not, he lies and reports himself to the wrong group and mimics swimming. When the swimming instructor orders them out to deep water, it is revealed Sune cannot swim. The swimming instructor has to save Sune's life and Sune says not knowing how to swim is silly, but nobody agrees, and just say the entire point of swimming lessons is learning how to swim. Sune is sent back to the minor pool. Finally, summer arrives and Sune and his classmates complete first grade.

It continues the story of the fictional schoolboy Sune Andersson. The tetanus needle stories told by the children in one of the chapters have been used within higher education to describe children's fear of tetanus needles. Book cover The book cover depicts Sune pointing at an object dropped to the floor, while Håkan is behind Sune. Plot Sune now has a little sister, Isabelle. Sune thinks she is \\"cute\\" despite screaming worse than Tarzan. Håkan wants his parents to go back to the birthing center and replace her with a baby that does not cry so loud. Sune also holds his first party, with \\"loud\\" music, \\"cute\\" girls, dancing and playing Post Office. Sune's class at school becomes the first 2nd grade class go for a tetanus shot, and rumors spread of two needle-related deaths in the previous year, and other horrors. Joakim does not need a shot, because he got one last year when bitten by a dog. He tells stories about the needle being one meter long, and a hammer being used. Sune tries to avoid the shot, forging a note from his mother saying her son does not need an injection. Finally, the nurse has to declare it is perfectly safe, and that it is more dangerous not to get a shot. Sune and Håkan also go to the hairdresser. Sune feels so ashamed over his shorter hair that he tries to use adhesive tape to attach the hair again. At school, he does not end up being teased so much for his short hair as he feared. The Andersson family also attend an entertainment evening, which end up embarrassing for Rudolf as Håkan and Sune take him to the stage. Sune and Joakim have a secret tree house with a pin-up girl picture in the groves of the Andersson family's garden, and they believe nobody knows about the tree house, but one day Rudolf plans to clear the groves. Sune and Joakim tell him not to destroy the trees, and when Rudolf wonders why, Anna declares that Sune and Joakim have a tree house there. With the secret revealed, Sune and Joakim think the tree house is no longer fun. They decide to give it away to Håkan, but first they will sleep there overnight as a goodbye ceremony. When Håkan becomes sad because of not being allowed to sleep in the tree house overnight, he hopes the monsters in the garden will eat them up; he says he has seen a total of 37 monsters. Joakim and Sune hear sounds in the woods, which they think could be a monster elk or one of the 37 monsters Håkan mentioned. Joakim tries to calm down Sune and says no monsters exist, at least not in Sweden and a town full of cars, and Sune believes they have been exterminated by getting hit by trucks. No monsters show up, instead comes Håkan. Håkan discovers the pin-up girl pictures. When Håkan asks why she is naked, Sune and Joakim reply it is from a doctor's journal, since when visiting the doctor clothes are removed. But Håkan replies that if they do not let him into the game, he will reveal that Sune and Joakim have a pin-up girl picture. They let Håkan into the game, and Håkan plays a strong hero, while Sune and Joakim play stupid bad guys. Finally Anna shows up and tells them that it is too cold to sleep in the tree house overnight, and instead they go indoors, to sleep in beds. When the summer vacation comes, many are sad because they will not see each other again after the break. Anna will leave the 6th grade for the 7th and will not meet her schoolteacher anymore. But when Sune, who will leave the 2nd grade for the 3rd, is about to sing Idas sommarvisa he cannot recall what blossoms (which is the flowers, in Swedish: \\"blommorna\\"), and forgetting the song lyrics, he sings \\"Jag gör så att koskiten blommar\\" (\\"I make the cowdung blossom\\").

Centered in the districts of Mosul and Diyar Rabi'a in the province of al-Jazira (upper Mesopotamia), the rebellion lasted for approximately thirty years, despite numerous attempts by both the central government and provincial authorities to quell it. It was finally defeated in 896 after the caliph al-Mu'tadid (r. 892–902) undertook several campaigns to restore caliphal authority in the region. The uprising was initially led by a local Kharijite named Musawir ibn 'Abd al-Hamid al-Shari. Following Musawir's death in 877, he was eventually succeeded by Harun ibn 'Abdallah al-Bajali, who remained in command until the end of the rebellion. Background The Kharijite movement was a prominent religious sect in early Islamic history, known for its members' fanaticism and staunch opposition to the Muslim ruling establishment. The Kharijites' views on the nature of the caliphate caused them to reject the legitimacy of the rule of the Alids, Umayyads and Abbasids alike, and over the course of the seventh through ninth centuries they were responsible for numerous rebellions against the established government. Few of these attempts proved to be successful, but the Kharijites' continual presence in many Muslim-held regions meant that they were a near-constant source of trouble for the caliphs' governors.Levi Della Vida, pp. 1074-77 In the caliphal province of al-Jazira, Sufri Kharijism had enjoyed a strong following since the late seventh century, particularly among the Arabs of the Rabi'a tribe. Between 750 and 865 more than a dozen Kharijite revolts were launched in this region, although most of them were easily put down by the Abbasid government. The most recent uprising had occurred in 862, approximately four years before Musawir's revolt.Vaglieri, pp. 39-40; Madelung, pp. 766-67 Beginning in 861 the Abbasid Caliphate entered a period of severe weakness, during which the central government in Samarra was paralyzed by a vicious struggle between the caliphs and the military establishment for control. Over the course of the 860s the government was repeatedly beset with financial difficulties, riots in the capital and rebel movements in multiple provinces. These problems were exacerbated in 865, when the rival caliphs al-Musta'in and al-Mu'tazz fought a civil war in central Iraq, which left thousands dead and caused major economic damage to the region. Even after the end of the war in early 866, the instability continued unabated, with troop riots repeatedly occurring in both Samarra and Baghdad.Gordon, pp. 90-104; Waines, pp. 299-303 Outbreak of the rebellion According to the historian Ibn al-Athir, the immediate cause of the rebellion was the authorities' arrest and detention of a young man in al-Haditha. This individual was a son of Musawir ibn 'Abd al- Hamid, who was a dihqan of the town of al-Bawazij.Al-Tabari, v. 35: p. 147 When he learned of his son's incarceration, he responded angrily to the news and gathered a number of supporters, who pledged allegiance to him. The group marched on al-Haditha and entered it; the chief of police there was forced to go into hiding, and Musawir's son was freed from prison.Ibn al-Athir, pp. 186-87; Weil, p. 406 Support for Musawir quickly grew, with Bedouin Arabs and Kurds of the region flocking to his side. Following an aborted advance on the district capital of Mosul,Ibn al-Athir, p. 187; Weil, p. 406 the rebels advanced south toward the Khurasan Road between Baghdad and Hulwan in autumn 867. When the governor of Baghdad sent two commanders to protect the road, Musawir engaged one of them in battle, killing him and several hundred of his men, and forced the other one to retreat back to Baghdad. He then followed up on this victory by proceeding to Hulwan, where he fought and killed more than four hundred of its defenders.Al-Tabari, v. 35: pp. 147-49; Ibn al-Athir, p. 190; Weil, p. 406 Inside the city of Mosul, various governors succeeded one after other: in the begin of the rebellion, the Khuza'i governor Aqaba ibn Muhamed was deposed by the Taghlibi Arab leader Ayyub ibn Ahmad, who put his own son Hasan as governor.C. Edmund Bosworth, p. 413 In early 868, in response to the growing power of the rebels, the deputy governor of Mosul, the Azdi Allah ibn Sulayman, raised an army and headed for Musawir in the vicinity of the Zab Rivers. The two sides encountered each other in May 868, and engaged in battle in the middle of a valley. After heavy fighting the rebels emerged victorious; the loyalist army suffered heavy casualties and the deputy governor Allah ibn Sulayman fled to Irbil. This victory increased Musawir's authority in the region,Ibn al-Athir, p. 195; Weil, p. 407 and in the following year he undertook an expedition against Mosul itself. Due to the weakness of the defenders he was able to enter the city without opposition. He remained in Mosul for a short time, during which he conducted the Friday prayers, and then withdrew to al-Haditha.Ibn al-Athir, p. 205; Weil, p. 417; Honigmann and Bosworth, p. 900 After this, the abbasid caliph named the Turkish Azkutigin as governor of Mosul. He sent his son Azkutigin in 874 as deputy, but he was expelled by the citizens of the city, Azkutigin sent two more deputies Hytham ibn Abd Allah and the Taghlibi Ishaq ibn Ayyub, but they were expelled too. Over the course of the next several years, Musawir remained active within a large portion of the district of Mosul, together with part of northern Iraq.Ibn al-Athir, pp. 195, 219; Weil, p. 465 Lieutenants were sent to administer the areas under his control; they established garrisons and collected taxes from local residents.Vaglieri, p. 40; al-Tabari, v. 36: p. 24; Ibn al-Athir, 220 Travel through the region became difficult for government agents, who risked being captured and killed by Musawir's partisans. He also received support from nearby Arab and Kurdish tribes, who sympathized with his cause and fought against the government.Al-Tabari, v. 36: pp. 136, 158; Ibn al-Athir, pp. 238, 248, 272 Abbasid campaigns against Musawir The Kharijite rebellion spanned the reigns of four caliphs, from al-Mu'tazz to al- Mu'tadid Beginning in 867, the Abbasid government in Samarra undertook a series of military campaigns in an effort to suppress the Kharijite rebellion. These operations began under the caliph al-Mu'tazz (r. 866–869), whose forces however had little success against the rebels.Al-Ya'qubi, p. 614, who states (in summary form) that al-Mu'tazz was prompted to action after Musawir expelled the governor of Mosul, marched in the direction of Surra Man Ra'a (Samarra) and occupied the town of al-Muhammadiyyah, \\"three farsakhs from the palaces of the caliph\\" He initially sent the officers SatikinAl-Tabari, v. 35: p. 147. Satikin was an officer in the service of Bugha al-Saghir; al-Tabari, v. 35: p. 153 and Khutarmish against Musawir; the latter was defeated in the district of Jalula in December.Al-Tabari, v. 35: p. 151; Ibn al-Athir, p. 192; Weil, p. 406 In September 868 Nushara ibn Tajibak, a lieutenant in Salih ibn Wasif's service, managed to inflict a defeat on Musawir and killed a large number of his followers.Al-Tabari, v. 35: pp. 146, 155; Ibn al-Athir, p. 196 In the following year, Yarjukh was sent against the rebel, but he was defeated and forced to flee to Samarra.Al-Tabari, v. 35: p. 161 Following the overthrow and death of al-Mu'tazz, his successor al-Muhtadi (r. 869–870) continued the campaigns. Upon receiving reports in January 870 that Musawir was attacking the town of Balad, the caliph ordered the commanders Musa ibn Bugha, Muflih and Bayakbak to proceed against him; a political crisis in the capital, however, resulted in this expedition's postponement. After a delay of several months, Musa and Bayakbak reassembled their troops and departed for al-Jazira on April 6. The army set up a base at al-Sinn and Muflih proceeded to pursue Musawir, eventually engaging the rebel on a mountain near al-Haditha. The battle proceeded poorly for Musawir, whose forces were weakened from a recent battle against a dissident Kharijite, and he eventually ordered a retreat. Muflih then advanced to various cities in Diyar Rabi'a, in an effort to reestablish order.Al-Tabari, v. 36: pp. 87, 90-91. Halfway through al-Tabari's account of the fight between the caliphal army and Musawir, he switches the name of the commander from Muflih to Musa. Ibn al-Athir, p. 219, gives sole credit to Muflih as the commander during the battle, but dates the fight to after Mu'tamid's ascension. He also adds the detail that the campaigns against Musawir in this year were prompted after Musawir's seizure of parts of Iraq had hindered the ability of the government to pay the troops' salaries, causing the army to clamor for action against the Kharijites. Al-Mas'udi, v. 8: p. 8, claims that the campaign took place after Musawir had approached Samarra with an army and caused a measure of disorder around the capital. The caliphal forces remained at al-Sinn for some time, but in early June Musa and Muflih were made aware of a plot by al-Muhtadi to either have them assassinated or imprisoned; they immediately responded by abandoning al-Jazira and withdrawing toward the Khurasan Road.Al-Tabari, v. 36: pp. 91-92, 95, 96; Ibn al-Athir, p. 220; Weil, pp. 418-19 At Khanaqin Musa encountered Musawir, who had a strong numerical advantage, but in spite of this the Kharijites were routed and suffered severe losses.Al-Tabari, v. 36: p. 112; Ibn al-Athir, p. 227. Weil, p. 465, sourcing Ibn Khaldun, claims that Musawir was actually the winner of this battle After al-Muhtadi was killed on June 17 and replaced with al-Mu'tamid (r. 870–892), Muflih resumed his offensive against the Kharijites. He initially succeeded in forcing Musawir to abandon al-Haditha, but he was unsuccessful in his attempts to defeat the rebel and eventually returned to Samarra in August, allowing Musawir to regain his authority in the region.Al- Tabari, v. 36: p. 116; Ibn al-Athir, pp. 219-20, 227 Muflih again went on campaign in around early 872; he proceeded to Takrit and fought some Arab tribesmen that were reportedly sympathetic to Musawir.Al-Tabari, v. 36: p. 136; Ibn al-Athir, p. 238 Later that year, Masrur al-Balkhi undertook two expeditions against Musawir; in the first, he installed a lieutenant in al- Haditha and captured a number of Kharijites, bringing them back to Samarra; in the second, he advanced to al-Bawazij and defeated Musawir in combat, capturing a number of his followers in the process, before departing for the capital around the end of October.Al-Tabari, v. 36: p. 148; Ibn al-Athir, p. 238, who however presents a different order of events; Weil, p. 465 Masrur undertook further campaigns in 874 and 875, both times in response to the killing of government officials by Musawir's followers; on the latter occasion he was assisted by al-Mu'tamid's brother Abu Ahmad (the future al- Muwaffaq).Al-Tabari, v. 36: pp. 158, 164; Ibn al-Athir, pp. 248, 259; Weil, p. 466 Musawir's death and succession disputes Musawir died in ca. 877, shortly after he had set out from al-Bawazij to meet yet another government army. Following his death, the Kharijites sought to find someone to succeed him. They initially called upon Muhammad ibn Khurzad of Shahrazur to assume the leadership, but he turned down their request, so they turned to another man named Ayyub ibn Hayyan al-Wariqi al-Bajali and gave the oath of allegiance to him instead. Ibn Khurzad subsequently regretted his decision and requested that he be reconsidered as leader, but the Kharijites refused to go back on their choice. In response, Ibn Khurazd gathered a number of men loyal to him and attacked Ayyub ibn Hayyan, killing him. Following this, the Kharijites threw their support behind Muhammad ibn 'Abd Allah ibn Yahya al-Wariqi, but he ended up being killed by Ibn Khurzad as well. The Kharijites finally selected Harun ibn 'Abd Allah al-Bajali, who soon gained a large number of supporters. Ibn Khurzad decided not to fight against Harun, and the latter assumed Musawir's former position within the district of Mosul.Ibn al-Athir, pp. 272-73; Weil, p. 466 Despite Harun's apparent victory in the succession dispute, however, his relationship with Ibn Khurzad remained poor. In ca. 881 Ibn Khurzad decided to make a move against Harun; he gathered his supporters and advanced against him. Harun assembled his own followers in response, and the two sides encountered each other near Mosul. In the ensuing battle, Harun was defeated and two hundred of his men were killed. He soon regained control of the situation, however, by soliciting the support of the local Taghlib Arabs and writing offers to Ibn Khurzad's followers, urging them to defect to his side. Most of them agreed to do so, and Ibn Khurzad's position quickly deteriorated as a result. He was eventually killed in Shahrazur, and Harun became the undisputed head of the Kharijite rebels.Ibn al-Athir, pp. 306-07; Weil, pp. 466-67 The Kharijites under Harun Under Harun's command, the Kharijites continued their activities in the area around Mosul. They subdued numerous villages and rural districts adjacent to the Tigris River, putting deputies over these territories and levying taxes and tithes from the inhabitants.Ibn al-Athir, pp. 306-07 Harun also established an alliance with Hamdan ibn Hamdun, a Taghlibite chieftain and the eponymous founder of the Hamdanid dynasty, and over the course of the next several years the two leaders jointly conducted a number of campaigns within the Mosul district.Canard, \\"Hamdanids,\\" p. 126 In ca. 885 Harun and Hamdan decided to march on Mosul; they entered the city and Harun led the people in the prayers in the Friday Mosque. News of this incident was reported to Baghdad.Al-Tabari, v. 37: p. 150; Ibn al-Athir, p. 345; Weil, p. 467 A short time later, the district began to suffer from raiding activities by the Banu Shayban; in response, Harun and Hamdan assembled their forces in an effort to stop them. The two leaders met and advanced against the Arabs, but the Shaybanis defeated them in battle and forced them to fall back.Ibn al-Athir, p. 346 Harun undertook another advance against Mosul four years later, after he received word that Ishaq ibn Kundaj, the city's governor, had killed a local Kharijite. He summoned his followers in al-Haditha and marched against the city, intending to attack its people in revenge. The city notables, however, managed to convince Harun to back down after they disassociated themselves from the governor's actions and apologized for the killing.Ibn al-Athir, p. 358; Weil, p. 467 In ca. 892, Harun and Hamdan entered into an alliance with the inhabitants of Mosul, after the latter had rebelled against their governor, Muhammad ibn Ishaq ibn Kundaj, and expelled his deputy from the city. The deputy turned to the Banu Shayban for assistance, prompting them to enter the district in force. Harun, Hamdan, and a number of Mosuli volunteers banded together to fight the Shaybanis and expel them from the region. The two sides met in the vicinity of the city, and after engaging each other in battle the Mosulis won an initial victory. The Shaybanis, however, regrouped and returned to the battlefield; the Mosulis, who had taken to looting after the engagement, were caught by surprise. Many of them were killed and the Shaybanis won the battle.Ibn al-Athir, p. 369; Weil, pp. 467-68 In the following year, an internal dispute broke out among the Kharijites, and many of them decided to reject Harun's leadership. The leader of the dissidents was one Muhammad ibn 'Ubaydah, a member of the Banu Zuhayr from the village of Qabratha, who gathered a number of supporters from the tribal Arabs and began collecting taxes for himself. He also built a fortress at Sinjar and put his son in charge of it, leaving a large amount of his plunder there. In response, Harun marched toward the fortress with over a thousand men and laid siege to it. The Banu Zuhayr within the fortress eventually agreed to submit after they were granted a guarantee of safe-conduct; the gates were opened to Harun's men, and Muhammad's son and several of his followers were beheaded. Harun then advanced against Qabratha, where Muhammad himself was stationed. In the ensuing battle Harun's forces were at first forced to fall back, but they subsequently rallied and defeated the dissidents, killing a large number of them. Muhammad fled to Amid, but was captured by its governor Ahmad ibn 'Isa al-Shaybani and sent to Baghdad, where he was flayed on the caliph's orders.Ibn al-Athir, p. 375; Weil, p. 489 End of the rebellion In October 892 the caliph al-Mu'tamid died and was succeeded by his nephew al-Mu'tadid. At the time of his ascension, al-Mu'tadid was already an experienced military commander, having previously campaigned against both the Zanj rebels in southern Iraq and the Tulunids in Syria. The new caliph immediately strove to reestablish the central government's control over the core provinces of the Abbasid Caliphate, which under his predecessors had slipped into the hands of autonomous governors and rebel groups. Included among his objectives was the resubjugation of al-Jazira, which was a major source of grain for the capital. Toward this end, he personally undertook several campaigns against the various factions in al-Jazira, in an effort to break their hold over the region and force them to recognize his authority.Kennedy, p. 760 Al-Mu'tadid's first campaign in al-Jazira, in 893, was directed against the Banu Shayban in the region of the Zab Rivers.Al-Tabari, v. 38: pp. 7-8; Ibn al-Athir, p. 374; Weil, p. 489 In January 895 he again advanced into the province; this time, his intended target was Hamdan ibn Hamdun, due to the latter's association with Harun and the Kharijites. After first battling against some tribal Arabs and Kurds in the region, al-Mu'tadid proceeded toward Hamdan's fortress at Mardin. Hamdan decided to flee and the defenders quickly surrendered to the caliph.Al-Tabari, v. 38: pp. 15-17; Ibn al-Athir, pp. 377; Weil, pp. 489-90 Al-Mu'tadid then returned to Mosul and sent an order to Hamdan to submit to him, but when Hamdan ignored the summons he sent his commanders Wasif Mushgir and Nasr al-Qushuri against him. Hamdan's forces were quickly defeated by Wasif and he himself was compelled to flee; eventually, however, he surrendered to the caliph's forces and was put under guard.Al-Tabari, v. 38: pp. 20-22; Ibn al-Athir, p. 379; Weil, p. 490 Following Hamdan's surrender, the caliph turned his focus to Harun himself. Nasr al-Qushuri wrote a threatening latter to the Kharijite, in an attempt to convince him to submit; Harun, however, wrote back a defiant response, rejecting Nasr's demands. When al-Mu'tadid was shown the letter, he appointed al-Hasan ibn Ali Kurah over Mosul and charged him with combatting the Kharijites. After crossing the Zab, al-Hasan encountered Harun and the two armies began a grueling engagement. The battle finally ended in defeat for the Kharijites; Harun fled to the desert and some of his followers surrendered to the caliph.Ibn al-Athir, pp. 380-81; Weil, p. 490 In March 896 al-Mu'tadid again departed for the district of Mosul, in order to campaign against Harun. On this occasion he was joined by Hamdan ibn Hamdun's son al-Husayn, who had peaceably submitted to the caliph during the latter's struggle against his father. Al-Mu'tadid himself advanced to Takrit, while he dispatched al-Husayn and Wasif Mushgir to pursue Harun. Al-Husayn met the rebel near the Tigris and routed his forces; Harun attempted to flee, but al-Husayn pursued him and eventually caught up to him, together with one hundred of his followers. Despite a plea by Harun to refrain from fighting, al-Husayn ordered his men to attack; the Kharijites were again defeated and Harun himself was captured.Al-Tabari, v. 38: pp. 27-28; Ibn al- Athir, pp. 384-85; al-Mas'udi, v. 8: p. 168; Weil, p. 490 Aftermath The Abbasid Caliphate in 900, after the defeat of the Kharijites. Provinces under the control of al-Mu'tadid are in dark green Al-Husayn brought Harun to al- Mu'tadid, who sent a dispatch announcing the victory to Baghdad. He then marched back to the capital with Harun in custody, reaching it on May 9. To celebrate the capture of the Kharijite, the streets of Baghdad were decorated and the caliph's army was assembled before the city gate. The caliph himself then entered the city and proceeded to his palace. Al-Husayn and other army commanders were rewarded with robes of honor, after which they rode in triumph through the city. Harun was put on display; mounted on an elephant, he was forced to sit in a woman's litter and wear humiliating clothing.Al-Tabari, v. 38: p. 29; Ibn al-Athir, p. 385; al-Mas'udi, v. 8: pp. 168-69; Weil, pp. 490-91. Ibn al-Athir claims that Harun was subsequently crucified. Rosenthal, p. 15, however, claims that he survived his capture, and died in prison in ca. 917. As a reward for al-Husayn's capture of Harun, al-Mu'tadid agreed to pardon his father Hamdan and release him from custody. Al-Husayn and his brothers were subsequently appointed to various posts, including a number of governorships in al-Jazira. In the following century the Hamdanids succeeded in establishing a de facto independent state in al-Jazira and northern Syria, with al-Husayn's nephews Nasir al-Dawla and Sayf al-Dawla ruling over Mosul and Aleppo respectively.Canard, \\"Hamdanids,\\" pp. 126-29 Following the defeat of the Kharijites, al-Mu'tadid continued his efforts to regain control of al- Jazira. In 899 he captured Amid from Muhammad ibn Ahmad al-Shaybani,Canard, \\"Isa b. al-Shaykh,\\" p. 91 and by the end of his reign in 902 most of the province was back under the central government's authority. Kharijite rebel activity in the province subsequently tapered off, with only one further revolt in 929 being recorded.Vaglieri, p. 40; Madelung, p. 767 NotesReferences  * *Ibn al-Athir, 'Izz al-Din.

She was the author of 2 collections of short stories, 6 books of poetry, a novel, a travel book, well over 100 short stories, over 400 poems, and hundreds of newspaper essays. She was influential for the ways her writing drew international attention to the then little-known Pacific Northwest region of the United States.(Baym, 2011: 284; Blair, 1997: 52)  Life  Ella Rhoads was born in Council Grove, Kansas, to Charles Reeve Rhoads and Mary A. Rhoads. She was the youngest of six children.(Koert, 1985: 4) In 1863, the family traveled by wagon train from Kansas to Oregon and first settled in Eastern Oregon’s Grande Ronde Valley.(Koert, 1985: 5, 7) They later moved to Portland, then to a farm near Milwaukie, then to Oregon City. Ella was privately tutored and also attended public school.(Gray, 1997: 274) At age 23, she married Russell Carden Higginson, age 33, a druggist from the Northeastern United States. He was a distant cousin of New England writer and abolitionist Thomas Wentworth Higginson.(Koert, 1985: 27, 24) In 1888, Ella and Russell Higginson moved to New Whatcom (later Bellingham), Washington where they would live the rest of their lives. Higginson traveled to Alaska for four summers as part of the research for her travel book. In 1892, the Higginson house, known as Clover Hill, in Bellingham was built. On May 14, 1909, Russell Higginson, age 57, died after a short illness. Higginson also helped establish the first public reading room and library in Bellingham, Washington, and for a long time was a board member there. During World War I, Ella Higginson ceased writing and volunteered full-time for the American Red Cross. She died on December 27, 1940, at age 78, having been ill most of the year. She left an estate of about $60,000. She is buried in Bayview Cemetery, Bellingham, Washington beneath a self-designed granite monument adorned with four-leaf clovers, a reference to her best-known poem (Koert, 1985: 7).  Writing  Ella Rhoads began writing as a child. Her first published work was the poem, \\"Dreams of the Past,\\" which appeared in The Oregon City newspaper in 1875 when she was age 14. At this time, she also began sending out her short fiction for publication, much of it anonymously or under various pseudonyms (such as \\"Ann Lester,\\" \\"Ethelind Ray,\\" and \\"Enid\\"). After her marriage, she began publishing under her own name (Koert, 1985: 22). On March 8, 1890, an article by Higginson appeared in Portland, Oregon’s West Shore, a literary magazine. The article's controversial topic was divorce. In the article, Higginson argued that early marriage was more of a problem for women than divorce. Her recommendation that women would be wise to marry no earlier than age 30 garnered Higginson national notice (Koert, 1985: 52). That same year what would become her best- known poem, \\"Four-Leaf Clover,\\" was published. In 1893, Higginson’s story \\"The Mother of ‘Pills’\\" won McClure’s magazine award for best story. The following year Higginson won McClure’s magazine short fiction contest, with a prize of $500, for \\"The Takin’ In of Ol’ Mis’ Lane.\\" McClure’s printed 80,000 copies of the issue in anticipation of high demand. In 1897, the Macmillan company became Higginson's main publisher. They published most of her subsequent books and heavily promoted her writing. In 1902, when Higginson’s only novel, Mariella, of Out West, was published, reviewers compared it to novels by Jane Austen, Leo Tolstoy, and Émile Zola. In 1908, Alaska, the Great Country, an account of Higginson's travels in Alaska as well as a history of Alaska, was published and subsequently went through several editions (Murray, 1990: 132). In 1914, Higginson’s story \\"The Message of Ann Laura Sweet\\" was named Collier’s magazine prize story and awarded a prize of $500 by a panel consisting of former US President Theodore Roosevelt and investigative journalists Mark Sullivan and Ida Tarbell. With these publications and awards, Higginson became known as the most popular writer of the Pacific Northwest (Baym, 2011: 55-56; Ward and Maveety, 1995: 57-59).  Editorial work  Higginson started her lifelong editorial work at age 15 when she began work at the newspaper office of The Oregon City Enterprise, learning typesetting and editorial writing. In later years, she served as editor of the \\"Fact and Fancy for Women\\" department for Portland, Oregon’s West Shore, a literary magazine; as associate editor of The Pacific magazine in Seattle; and as associate editor for the Seattle magazine, The Westerner (Koert, 1985: 89).  Politics  In 1912, Higginson served as campaign manager for Washington State Republican candidate Frances C. Axtell, cousin of United States President Grover Cleveland. Axtell became the first female member of the Washington State Legislature (Koert, 1985: 118-119).  Honors  Higginson was the recipient of several national awards for her short fiction. In 1931, Higginson was named first Poet Laureate of Washington State (Bennett, 1998: 490; Blair, 1997: 34).

It is of minor importance to local commercial fisheries and can be found in the aquarium trade. This species is the only known member of its genus. Description The tubelip wrasse juveniles are brown with 2 bluish white stripes along their body, as they increase in size the stripes disappear. The females are yellowish brown with faint stripes. The males have a more intense and bright colour than the females with a large yellow patch sround the base of the pectoral fin. The yellow lips are thick and fleshy, creating a short tube when the mouth is closed. The head is covered in scales apart from a sheath over base of upper lip, the area in front of the eyes and the chin. The upper jaw has no teeth between the two forward pairs of canines and the large canine in the corner of each jaw. The dorsal fin has 9 spines and 11-12 soft rays and the anal fin has 3 spines and 10 - 11 soft rays. this species can attain a maximum fish measurement total length in males of . Distribution The tubelip wrasse has a wide Indo-Pacific distribution, it is found on the coast of East Africa in Tanzania and Mozambiique through the Indian Ocean, including the main islands into the Pacific Ocean as far as Micronesia and Samoa, north to the Ryukyus and Taiwan and south to the Great Barrier Reef and Lord Howe Island in Australia. Habitat and ecology The tubelip wrasse inhabits shallow lagoon reefs and semi-protected seaward reefs where there is a high level of coral cover.It is found near branching corals, especially staghorn corals of the genus Acropora, the polyps of which are the main components of its diet. Species description and etymology Labrichthys unilineatus was formally described in 1847 as Cossyphus unilineatus by the French naturalist Alphone Guichenot with the type locality given as Guam. In 1854 the Dutch ichthyologist Pieter Bleeker placed C. unilineatus in the monotypic genus Labrichthys. The generic name is a combination of the Greek labrax, which can be taken to mean \\"voracious\\", and ichthys, which means \\"fish\\". The specific name unilineatus means \\"one lined\\" and refers to the lateral strip of the juveniles. Human usage The tubelip wrasse is of minor interest to commercial fisheries and it occasionally turns up in the aquarium trade.

It was the smallest and least well-known of the French colonial uprisings during the interwar period. Much of the conflict took place in what is now part of the Central African Republic. Background Forced labour family camp during construction of the Congo-Ocean Railway 1930. Barka Ngainoumbey, known as Karnou (meaning \\"he who can change the world\\"), was a Gbaya religious prophet and healer from the Sangha River basin region. In 1924 he began preaching non- violent resistance against the French colonisers in response to the recruitment of natives in the construction of the Congo-Ocean Railway and rubber tapping, and mistreatment by European concessionary companies. Karnou also preached against Europeans and the Fula, who administered sections of Gbaya territory in French Cameroon on France's behalf. The nonviolent overthrow of the French and Fulani was to be achieved through the use of traditional medicine, symbolised by a small hooked stick that resembled a miniature hoe handle (koŋgo wara) that was distributed by Karnou to his followers. A movement emerged around Karnou, which grew to include a boycott of European merchandise and black solidarity. This movement went unnoticed by the French administration, which had only a limited presence in the region, until 1927, when many of the movement's followers began to take up arms. By this time there were over 350,000 adherents to the movement, including around 60,000 warriors. Such unity was unprecedented in a region known for its political fragmentation and historical lack of centralised authority. Fighting Armed conflict broke out in mid 1928 in a clash between Karnou's followers and a group of Fula pastoralists between the towns of Baboua and Bouar, followed by similar attacks on a caravan of Hausa merchants near Gankombon and a French agricultural agent accompanied by police escort at Nahing. Karnou's message spread rapidly on the back of these engagements and many distant Gbaya groups sent emissaries to Karnou in order to adopt his methods. Violence quickly spread towards French traders, French government posts and local chiefs and soldiers who worked for the French. Bouar was then occupied and burned down by Karnou's followers. Insurgency by Karnou's followers continued in the following months despite being ill-equipped. As a whole, the conflict took place away from urban centers. A French counterattack with reinforced troops was launched in late 1928 and on December 11, Karnou was killed by a French military patrol. The rebellion, however, continued to spread unevenly from the Sangha basin to include the neighbouring groups from Cameroon and the lower Ubangi region, namely in the Mbéré and Vina valleys of French Cameroons, around the towns of Baïbokoum and Moïssala in southern Chad, around the towns of Yaloke, Bambio, Ndele and Boda in the Mambéré-Kadéï and Lobaye regions of Ubangi-Shari, and around the town of Berandjoko in the French Congo. To further quell \\"dissent\\", French troops were dispatched to imprison followers of the movement and also sent into areas of forest unaffected by the rebellion to relocate natives. French authorities also attempted to forcibly recruit swathes of natives in the fight against the rebels, however this was avoided by many groups including the Ngando people, many of whom abandoned their villages and relocated to camps deep in the forest for the duration of the conflict, as had occurred during periods of forced labour. The final stage of the conflict, known as the \\"war of the caves\\", took place in 1931. Kongo-Wara followers fought under the premise of invulnerability from European soldiers from a sacred hoe handle. This mysticism, perpetuated by Karnou, encouraged unmilitarized villagers to fight bravely yet recklessly. One recorded example of this behaviour was an account of a man dancing before a French commander and threatening him with a spear while chanting: \\"fire, big gorilla; your gun will only shoot water\\". Allegiances Though initially a response to the atrocities committed by concession companies, the rebellion spread quickly to eastern Cameroon and southern Chad, both of which had never been controlled by such companies. Among Gbaya clans themselves, those in eastern Cameroon and western Ubang- Shari which had cultivated linked with their Fulani neighbours and French and/or former German colonisers chose to side instead with the French administration in opposing the rebellion. This was because their diplomatic ties had allowed their leaders to become officially recognised chiefs. Examples include the Gbaya chiefs in the villages of Alim and Gbangen, in the Mbéré and Pangara valleys, respectively, the Gbaya chief in the village of Lokoti and the Mbum chief in the village of Mboula, both in the Meiganga sub- prefecture, all in Cameroon. The Gbaya chiefs in the villages of Abba and Gaza in Ubangi-Shari too supported the French administration. Much of this spread in activity against France, meanwhile, was a series of parochial reactions to the indiscriminate French suppression, with far-reaching associations with Karnou's movement being nominal at best and existing only out of convenience. This is also the case for the support by groups other than the Gbaya, as although Karnou's preachings revolved around universal Gbaya traditions and spirituality, it was not pan-ethnic in its appeal. Aftermath Depiction of Karnou in 2016, in Bouar. The Kongo rebellion was suppressed in 1931 but had become the largest interwar insurrection of either French Cameroon or French Equatorial Africa. In the wake of the rebellion the movement's leaders were imprisoned and executed, although two of Karnou's lieutenants, Bissi and Yandjere, were not captured until 1935. Populations of natives were also forcibly relocated to designated villages where they could be supervised. Two of these villages are Ngoundi and Ndele of the Sangha-Mbaéré prefecture. In order to assert control over the region the French administration divided the Kadei-Sangha Department, where the rebellion had originated, into the Haute- Sangha and N'Goko-Sangha department in 1933. In the following year, however, the two departments were merged. In response to the rebellion French authorities agreed not to renew the leases of concessionary companies, however European business interests, including plantations, continued to be promoted in the region. Unlike other conflicts to have occurred in French colonies, the Kongo-Wara rebellion was relegated to relative obscurity amongst the public in France and few politicians and commentators remarked of it. What little news of the rebellion that was made known in Europe helped bring attention to the conditions faced by Central African workers. This led to criticism of French rule in Africa from communists and other groups, leading to French suspicions of the rebellion itself being instigated by communists. Though not achieving independence from the French colonial administration, the Kongo-Wara rebellion achieved an improvement in the conditions which initially sparked resistance, as the administration reduced the worse forms of oppression in a self- interested reaction to negative press the rebellion had caused. The rebellion also exposed several larger issues endemic to the French colonial system; the effect of unchecked, unrestricted capitalism upon native populations, and the fact that stability was dependent on a fragile, rural elite. Calls for fundamental reform in the wake of these revelations were silenced once order had been restored. During the 1940s and 50s, vanguard Central African nationalist and first Prime Minister of the autonomous territory, Barthélemy Boganda, explicitly equated himself to Karnou and utilised the mass appeal of the rebellion to successfully mobilise nationalistic sentiments among Central Africans for political purposes. Boganda incidentally died in a plane crash in Lobaye, near where one version of the story tells of Karnou having seen a sign from God in the form of a shooting star. Boganda's former lieutenant, Abel Goumba, also overtly identified with the story in his nationalist movement against the alleged French puppet, President David Dacko. The story of the rebellion continues to be passed on by Gbaya people in the form of traditional Gbaya folktales, sometimes including songs. It continues to have relevance, with Karnou's prophecies explaining the radical change in the experience of Africans under colonialism, namely regarding the new, politico-economic and Christian religious orders. It is also claimed that Boganda was the reincarnation of Karnou, having visited the epicentre of the rebellion that was Karnou's former residence in the early 1950s. In this way, the story of Karnou serves to reconcile Gbaya myth and tradition with the tumultuous history of Central Africa. In the town of Meiganga, Cameroon, there is a cinema named after Karnou. More recently, a Central African airline has been named Karinou Airlines, using an outdated spelling of Karnou.

She was launched in 1808 and sold in 1816. During her service she grounded on the French coast and was in French hands for about a day before the British recaptured her. During her career she captured two French privateers. Career Commander Thomas Oliver was appointed captain of Apelles in September 1808. She participated in the ill-fated Walcheren Campaign.Marshall (1832), Vol. 3, Part 2, pp.384-5. Starting on 30 July 1809, a British armed force of 39,000 men landed on Walcheren. However, the French fleet had left Flushing (Vlissingen) and sailed to Antwerp, and the British lost over 4,000 men to \\"Walcheren Fever\\", a combination of malaria and typhus, and to enemy action. As the strategic reasons for the campaign dissipated and conditions worsened, the British force withdrew in December. Prize money arising from the net proceeds of the property captured at Walcheren and the adjacent islands in the Scheld was paid in October 1812. On 19 October 1810 Apelles captured the French privateer Somnambule (or Somnus), of 18 guns and 56 men, off Dieppe. The privateer was so damaged in the engagement before she surrendered that Oliver had to scuttle her. Before Apelles captured her the privateer had captured the sloop Friends.Lloyd's List (LL) №4504. While Apelles was in sight, recaptured Friends, and sent her into Dover. French sources report that Somnambule (or Somanbule) was a chasse maree commissioned as a privateer in Dieppe in October 1810 under Captain Pierre-Antoine Sauvage. Lieutenant de vaisseau F. Lecomte was Sauvage's second-in-command. In the engagement a musket ball killed Sauvage, and Lecomte took over, and it was he that struck, though not before he himself was wounded. The French sources furthermore give her 11 guns, not 18. Commander Frederick Hoffman assumed command in December, relieving Oliver. Apelless officers had informed Admiral George Campbell that Oliver was insane, and that discipline on the sloop had deteriorated. Campbell ordered a Court of Inquiry, and as a result of its report, gently suggested to Oliver that he resign, which, after some hesitation, he did. Hoffman recommissioned her in early 1811. Captured by the French Apelles and were blockading the French coast between Cape Gris Nez and Étaples when at 3am on the morning of 3 May 1812 a thick fog descended. Within 45 minutes Skylark had grounded. All efforts to free Skylark failed and in the morning shore batteries started firing on her as French troops started to gather. The crew set fire to Skylark and left in her boats. Apelles too had run aground in the fog at about 4am, and within sight of Skylark. Shore batteries fired on Apelles also, and troops gathered. All efforts to free her failed and by 6am Commander Frederick Hoffman ordered his crew into the boats. Unfortunately there was not enough room for all, so Hoffman and 19 of his men stayed behind. Commander Boxer, of Skylark, came alongside in a boat and urged Hoffman to leave, but Hoffman refused to do so while some of his men were still on board. As more French troops arrived with field artillery, Hoffman raised a white flag at about 6:30am. Before he gave up his ship, Hoffman and the purser burned all Apelless signal books and other instructions. The French took Hoffman and his men prisoner and refloated Apelles. However, the next day and arrived and were able to drive Apelles on shore. Then and arrived. Gunfire from the British squadron drove the French off, permitting boats from Bermuda to recapture Apelles. Return to service Between May and September Apelles underwent refitting at Sheerness. She then came under the command of Commander Charles Robb. Robb was already captain in December when Apelles captured the Danish vessels No. 23 (3 December), Haabet (13 December), and Falken (20 December). At daybreak on 18 February 1813, Apelles captured the French privateer cutter Ravisseur at . Ravisseur was armed with ten 9-pounder carronades and four long 6-pounder guns, and had a crew of 51 men under the command of M. Alexander Happey. She was 12 days out of Dunkirk and had intended to cruise off Flamborough Head, but westerly gales had driven her eastward. She had not made any captures. Apelles sent her into Leith.LL №4753. Commander Robb drowned on 27 February off the Isle of May when a gale of wind washed him overboard.The European Magazine and London Review (1813), p. 361. He was assisting in throwing her guns overboard to lighten her. Commander Alexander McVicar (or M'Vicar) was appointed to Apelles on 8 March,Marshall (1830), Supplement, Part 4, p.122. and recommissioned her that month for the North Sea. McVicar tested a new patent compass in July and wrote a testimonial letter on 13 June. Vice-Admiral Robert Otway had ordered him to test the compass belonging to Mr. Alexander, of Leith, and McVicar used it for some nine weeks, finding it better than the other compasses on Apelles.

Austin's Old Three Hundred colonists. In 1806, he married Rachel Rabb in Ohio. Their family, which eventually expanded to include ten children, moved first to Illinois Territory and by 1820 was living along the Red River in Spanish Texas. In 1824 the Newmans moved to a land grant in modern-day Wharton County, Texas where they farmed and ranched. Joseph died in 1831 but his wife lived until 1872. Early life and migration Joseph Newman was born around 1787.See Newman historical marker photo On June 21, 1806, then 19-year-old Joseph married 16-year-old Rachel Rabb in Warren County, Ohio. The family later migrated to Illinois Territory where Joseph did military service in the War of 1812. Again the Newmans moved, this time to Arkansas Territory, where they lived along the Red River. In 1820, the families crossed to the south side of the river and lived in the Jonesborough settlement. The authorities in Miller County, Arkansas tried to collect taxes from the residents of Jonesborough. Believing themselves to be living in Spanish Texas, about 80 settlers petitioned the Spanish governor, asking him to appoint an alcalde to govern them. If this was not possible the petition requested that the settlers be allowed to elect their own officials. The document became known as the Joseph Newman Memorial. Austin's colony In 1823, the Newmans traveled to join Rachel's parents William Rabb and Mary Smalley Rabb in Stephen F. Austin's Colony. They were given Land Grant 59 in Mexican Texas on August 10, 1824. The grant included one sitio in what is now Wharton County and one labore in modern-day Austin County.Von-Maszweski (2011), p. 172 The larger sitio or league encompassed 4,428 acres while the labore was only 177 acres.Von-Maszewski (2011), p. 163 The Newman's league was located northwest of Wharton, Texas on the east side of the Colorado River.Von-Maszewski (2011), pp. 206-207 Their labore was located near San Felipe.Von-Maszewski (2011), pp. 180-181 An adjoining league along the Colorado belonged to Rachel's brother Andrew Rabb. An early census recorded that Newman farmed and tended livestock. He was not destined to live long on his new land. On February 15, 1831 he signed a will that left his property to his wife and their ten children. Their offspring were Mary, William, Eliza, Minerva, Sally, Elizabeth, Thomas, Ali, Joseph, Jr. and Andrew. Of these, the three youngest sons were born in Austin's Colony. The dying Newman appointed Andrew Rabb executor and Rachel executrix of his will. His will also asked that he be buried in the family cemetery on his property. The location of Newman's grave is unknown. Rachel deeded all her property to her children four years after her husband's death, but she kept living in her original home. She also inherited property in Matagorda County from her parents. In 1854, none of the original Newman league belonged to family members, so Rachel moved to Dewitt County where she remarried. She died in 1872 and was buried in the Salt Creek cemetery. Newman's daughter Sally led a very colorful life and was supposed to have gunned down several men.

The company owns 62 properties and has 7 additional properties under construction, all of which are in the Washington metropolitan area, mostly inside the Beltway, and almost all of which are accessible by the Washington Metro. The company has a history of developing sustainable buildings and is a member of the U.S. Green Building Council. It helped develop the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) program for the design, construction, operation, and maintenance of green buildings, homes, and neighborhoods. Corporate history=Founding and early years In 1957, three attorneys — Gerald J. Miller, Donald A. Brown, and Joseph Bernard Gildenhorn — formed a law practice in Rockville, Maryland called Miller, Brown & Gildenhorn. By 1960, the firm stopped practicing law and instead began securing private loans from wealthy investors to finance building projects brought to them by real estate developers. By 1962, the company controlled more than $50 million in real estate. Among the projects it completed in Washington, D.C. were a $4 million office building at 2121 Pennsylvania Avenue NW, the $2.7 million Jefferson Building at 19th Street NW and Jefferson Place NW, an $8.5 million office building at 19th and M Streets NW, and a $12 million large apartment complex at Tunlaw Road NW and Watson Place NW. That year, the company formed its own real estate development arm, MBG Associates. Benjamin A. Jacobs, a 23-year-old law student who expressed deep interest in the law firm's real estate practice, joined the real estate division. Miller left the company in 1969, and Jacobs was made a partner in the firm. MBG Associates changed its name to JBG Associates to reflect the initials of the new partners and formed two subsidiaries, JBG Properties Inc. and JBG Construction Co. Growth (1970-1996) In the 1970s, the firm hired several people who later became top managers at the company, including Robert H. Braunohler, Michael J. Glosserman, and Lewis Rumford. Managers Brian P. Coulter and Robert A. Stewart joined the company in the 1980s. In the late 1980s, the company was among the first real estate development firms in the D.C. area to redevelop properties for third-party clients for a set fee. This strategy helped the company survive the early 1990s recession. The company aggressively acquired several properties after the early 1990s recession. With 26 buildings in its portfolio in the early 1990s, Gilderhorn, Brown, and Jacobs considered an initial public offering for the company, although it did not happen. Portfolio sale to TrizecHahn (1997) By 1997, the company had an ownership interest in 21 commercial properties, including many office buildings, two hotels and one shopping center. It sold most of its assets to Trizec Properties in 1997 for $560 million. The deal did not include 10 apartment projects owned by JBG. The sale helped raise capital for the firm. But with a smaller portfolio, the company also shed most of its staff, and only 15 people remained with the firm at the end of the year. Creation of investment funds and second portfolio sale After the divestment, Brown and Gildenhorn retired from daily management of the company. In 1999, with Glosserman as the firm's new Managing Partner, the company decided on a new investment strategy. Instead of putting together syndicates for specific projects, the company sought out individual, and later institutional, investors. This gave the firm access to funds it could use at its discretion. The first investment fund closed in 2002, and its first institutional investor was the financial endowment of Yale University. By fall 2012, JBG had established 8 investment funds and raised $5.5 billion; several of the funds were specifically created just for investment by Yale. New partners were added, including Porter Dawson, Kenneth F. Finkelstein, James L. Iker, and W. Matt Kelly. In 2005, JBG recapitalized several office buildings by selling a stake in the buildings to Morgan Stanley for $644 million. In August 2007, JBG sold most of its portfolio to MacFarlane Partners for $2 billion. By 2011, the company had $10 billion in assets. That year, Jacobs retired as managing member. The firm had 15 owners by 2012, and more than 500 employees. By the fall 2012, The company had developed, owned, or managed more than of office space; 15,000 apartments; of retail space; and 15 hotels with more than 4,500 rooms. In 2013, the company was named as the most active real estate developer in the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area. Fund IX The company opened a real estate investment fund called JBG/Fund IX on March 17, 2014, and by September 2014, the company had raised $680 million. The Woodley Marriott Wardman Park Tower In 2005, JBG and CIM Group, purchased the Marriott Wardman Park hotel from Thayer Lodging Group for $300 million. JBG planned to convert a portion of the hotel into luxury condominiums and construct a 200-unit condominium building on a lot adjacent to the hotel. JBG also said it will demolish the hotel's parking garage and main ballroom, and spend $50 million to renovate the guest rooms, add dining space, build a new fitness center, and improve the exhibition and meeting space. The deal included a clause that allowed Marriott, which continued to manage the hotel, to veto the conversion of hotel rooms into condos if revenues on the remaining hotel section fell below a specified number. Hotel revenues declined significantly during the Great Recession, and Marriott exercised its right to stop the conversion of the hotel into condominiums. =Lawsuit with Marriott regarding the Washington Marriott Marquis= In 2002, Marriott International received the right to construct the 1,224-room Washington Marriott Marquis in downtown Washington, D.C. A subsidiary of JBG, Wardman Investor LLC, filed a notice with the city's Contract Appeals Board in early 2009 to have the entire project set aside for being an \\"invalid sole source procurement\\". JBG argued that the original proposal from D.C. required the hotel to be built on private land and financed with private money. JBG did not submit a proposal because it could not meet these conditions. Subsequently, the city negotiated only with Marriott, eliminated the private investment requirement, added $272 million in public financing, and gave Marriott an \\"extraordinarily favorable\\" lease. JBG argued that these changes altered the terms of the project and that it should be put out for public bid again. The appeals board said in July 2009 that JBG lacked standing to protest the award since it never bid on the job. Even if the company did have standing, the appeal board said, it lost the right to protest after the council passed legislation removing the project from the regular contracting process in 2006. JBG's motive for filing the lawsuit may not have been to contest the construction of the convention headquarters hotel. JBG allegedly sued to stop the Washington Marriott Marquis project in order to obtain favorable action by Marriott on condo conversions at the Marriott Wardman Park. Marriott counter-sued JBG on January 14, 2010, accusing JBG of tortious interference in its contractual relations. In support of its claim, Marriott told the court that JBG officials had threatened Marriott with a lawsuit if it did not renegotiate its Wardman Park deal. On January 21, 2010, the Washington Convention and Sports Authority also filed suit against JBG for tortious interference. The city followed suit with its own tortious interference claim on February 18, 2010. On March 29, 2010, Superior Court of the District of Columbia Judge Natalia Combs Greene granted partial summary judgment and a motion to dismiss to Marriott, the city, and WCSA. A partial out-of-court settlement had already been reached by the parties giving JBG some limited ability to move forward on the condo project, but that agreement now seemed unnecessary given the court's ruling. The parties suspended litigation against one another to negotiate, but litigation resumed on June 8, 2010. The parties in the various lawsuits resolved their legal dispute on July 1, 2010, allowing construction to resume on both the Marriott Marquis and the Wardman Park renovation. =Construction and sale of The Woodley apartments= After the collapse of the housing market during the financial crisis of 2007-2008, JBG decided to construct an apartment building on the vacant acreage rather than condominiums. D.C.-based architect David M. Schwarz designed an eight-story, 212-unit building for the company. Originally called Wardman West, the name was later changed to 2700 Woodley and then later to The Woodley. In June 2014, after the building was completed, but before it was leased, JBG sold The Woodley for $195 million, or $920,000 per unit, to TIAA- CREF, which set a record for the highest price-per-unit ever paid for a multifamily project in the D.C. metropolitan area. =Condominiums= JBG also converted a portion of the hotel into 32 condominiums. The project was financed by a $54 million investment from North America Sekisui House LLC (NASH), the North American division of the largest homebuilding corporation in Japan, in February 2014. One of the condominium units sold for $8.4 million. Merger with Vornado subsidiary and spin off into a public company In July 2017, the company merged with Charles E. Smith Companies, a subsidiary of Vornado Realty Trust that owned its assets in the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area. The company changed its name to JBG Smith and was spun off into a public company. Charles E. Smith Commercial was acquired by Vornado in 2002. At the time, Charles E. Smith Commercial’s portfolio included 14 million square feet of space in 50 buildings throughout the Washington, D.C. region, including 7.2 million square feet in Crystal City, Virginia. Amazon HQ2 at National Landing In November 2018, the company sold land with 4.1 million developable square feet to Amazon and announced lease transactions with Amazon at National Landing as part of the Amazon HQ2 initiative.

ACF built a total of 35 cars including coaches, dining cars, and observation cars. After Union Pacific exited the passenger business in 1971 the Auto-Train Corporation purchased most of the fleet and operated them for an additional ten years. Design ACF produced three types of domes for the Union Pacific: coaches, dining cars, and observation cars. The ten dining cars were unique: the only dome dining cars (aside from GM's Train of Tomorrow) ever built for a United States railroad. The cars featured seating on both levels: 18 in the upper level in booths and 18 in the lower level at tables. Also located on the lower level was a kitchen, pantry, and private dining room with seating for 10. A dumbwaiter connected the two levels. The coaches could seat 24 in the dome area and an additional 36 in the lower level. The center section was given over to men's and women's lounges. The lounge-observation cars were square-ended instead of the rounded-off design favored by many railroads. Like the coaches, the upper-level dome area could seat 24. In the lower level, starting at the vestibule end, was a card room (seating for five), cocktail lounge (seats for nine) and bar, stairs up to the dome level, and finally the observation area itself with seating for 19. Service history The Union Pacific was a comparative latecomer to the dome scene when it ordered the Astra Domes from ACF in 1954; most western railroads already operated domes, some since the late 1940s. ACF delivered the 35 cars to the Union Pacific in 1955 at the cost of . The Union Pacific assigned the cars to its various transcontinental streamliners: *Five coaches to the new Challenger *Five coaches, five dining cars and five lounge-observation cars to the City of Portland *Five dining cars and five lounge-observation cars to City of Los Angeles *Five lounge-observation cars to the City of St. Louis The Union Pacific found it necessary to assign a second steward to the upper-level dining area. The Union Pacific gave great publicity to the novelty of dome dining cars operating between Chicago, Portland, Oregon and Los Angeles. After the Union Pacific exited the passenger business in 1971 it sold two of the dome coaches (#7004 and #7008) to the Alaska Railroad for use on its AuRoRa streamliner. UP retained dome coach #7006 and dome lounge-observation #9004 for company use and donated dome diner #8003 to the National Railroad Museum in Green Bay, Wisconsin, where it remains today. The remainder of the fleet–seven coaches, nine dining cars and fourteen lounge-observation cars–were purchased by the new Auto-Train Corporation for use on the Auto- Train. After Auto-Train's bankruptcy in 1981 the fleet was sold and dispersed. Many remain in private hands.

Career=Mayoral elections In January 2011, while in his final semester at Brown University, Morse announced his campaign for mayor of Holyoke. The previous summer, he had attended a three-day workshop in New York City hosted by Wellstone Action, a grassroots campaign training organization for progressives, and began quietly fundraising at the end of 2010. Morse's election in 2011 at the age of 22 received national coverage, as he was the city's youngest and first openly gay mayor and, at the time, among the youngest mayors in the United States. He was reelected in 2013 and 2015. In 2015, Holyoke's mayoral term was extended from two years to four, effective 2017. Morse was reelected that year, and is the first Holyoke mayor to serve a four-year term. Mayoral tenure Left to right: Alex Morse, Richard Neal, Lt. Gov. Timothy Murray, Congressman John Olver, and others presiding over groundbreaking in 2012 for Holyoke station; a $73 million federal grant by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) restored rail service for the first time since 1967 =Cannabis industry= On August 1, 2016, Morse became the first Massachusetts mayor to publicly endorse the legalization of cannabis. Following legalization, Morse has encouraged investment of marijuana cultivation in the city, calling Holyoke \\"the Rolling Paper City\\"; he vetoed a 2017 moratorium the city council placed on recreational retailers. Morse has attended several cannabis cultivation forums as a speaker, including several on the industry hosted in Holyoke. Among the earliest projects to open in Holyoke was a $10 million cultivation facility for Chicago-based Green Thumb Industries (GTI), which was operational by mid-2018. Several other businesses have since purchased facilities in the city, including a $3.2 million sale of a former American Thread Company mill to Trulieve, a company seeking to produce and sell retail marijuana at the site. =Casino= During Morse's 2011 campaign, a prominent issue was plans for a casino in the city, with then-mayor Elaine Pluta supporting such plans and Morse opposing them. In an October 2012 editorial, Morse elaborated on his position, concluding, \\"I oppose a casino in Holyoke because I have not given up on Holyoke\\". On November 26, 2012, Morse held a press conference announcing his reversal on this stance, vowing to work with local businessman Eric Suher and others to build a casino at Mountain Park, with the city accepting a $25,000 payment from the developer for the costs of a review process. Facing backlash from supporters of his previous campaign against casinos, by December 2012 Morse reversed course and returned the funds, citing a \\"resounding voice against the casinos\\". =Education= As the chair of the Holyoke School Committee, Morse opposed state receivership before the 2015 state takeover, saying, \\"We should agree that local control matters, which is to say that a corporate takeover of our district or a charter organization running our district is not acceptable\\". Since receivership he has become increasingly supportive of state implementation, as public schools have seen marked improvement, with graduation rates increasing 20%. Morse has also publicly supported state expanded programs such as bilingual education, and the tentative construction of two new middle schools for a reported estimate of $132 million. =Labor support= In 2017, following a trial shutdown, or \\"brownout\\", of a local fire engine company, the International Association of Fire Fighters Local 1693 made a vote of no confidence in Morse, saying in a press release, \\"Chief Pond's continued reductions to the Department and practice of operating the Department at unsafe levels, all with the support of [the] Mayor\\". Morse has repeatedly affirmed support of the fire chief and denied the validity of these concerns, saying at a protest outside of a fundraiser that \\"the points that they're making just are untrue.\\" The Pioneer Valley AFL-CIO and the New England Regional Council of Carpenters Local 108 endorsed Morse in his 2017 reelection campaign. =Municipal finance= In 2014 the city council criticized Morse for refusing to disclose the reason for providing a $45,000 exit agreement to city solicitor Heather Egan, a year after her appointment. In response, Morse said in a Reddit AMA: \\"I do admit that I should have briefed the City Council before executing the settlement agreement with this former employee as to avoid issues of perception. Again, when faced with the decision to potentially spend hundreds of thousands of dollars in legal costs to fight frivolous lawsuits, or to execute a settlement agreement with funds that were already allocated in the budget, I chose the latter. Separation agreements are not uncommon in both the private and public sector.\\" Following the resignation of the city auditor in 2018, who suggested receivership and said he did not believe the mayor's office followed protocol, state auditor Suzanne Bump responded to a city council request stating, \\"I do not believe the circumstances in Holyoke rise to the level of warranting a state audit\\". In the previous month, a private audit by firm CliftonLarsonAllen found all city funds accounted for. Although Holyoke's government has a strong mayor–council government, Morse has called for finance-related departments to be placed under a chief financial officer appointed by the mayor and subject to City Council confirmation. The charter currently calls for the election of city treasurers. =Sanctuary city status= On November 19, 2014, Morse issued an executive order to the Holyoke Police Department, asking the department not to enforce federal civil detainer requests for holding immigrants suspected of being in the country illegally past the point they would usually be released. This codified a practice previously implemented during his tenure. The practice would not apply those who were registered as sex offenders, had previous indictments or convictions, or outstanding warrants. Following a threat by the Trump administration to defund sanctuary cities in 2017, Morse reaffirmed this practice. Morse acknowledged that he knew of no instance where local police ignored federal immigration requests, and that the policy did not directly affect Holyoke's largest group of residents, the Puerto Rican community, who hold American citizenship. 2020 congressional campaign On June 22, 2019, Morse announced his run for the U.S. House of Representatives against incumbent Democrat Richard Neal, to represent Massachusetts's 1st congressional district. He was later endorsed by Justice Democrats, the Sunrise Movement, and Humanity Forward. Morse was defeated by Neal by around 17 percentage points. In an August 2020 email, as part of what Morse and Out magazine later called a smear campaign,  the College Democrats of Massachusetts alleged that Morse had used \\"his position of power for romantic or sexual gain\\". The email said that Morse had used dating apps to match with and contact students, aged 18 and above, at University of Massachusetts Amherst, where Morse was an adjunct instructor. The political group disinvited Morse from any future events on campus. Morse responded, \\"I have never violated UMass policy\\". The local chapter of the Sunrise Movement voted to retract its endorsement of Morse, and the national organization announced that it would no longer campaign for him. Other organizations, including the Justice Democrats and the Working Families Party, affirmed their support of Morse. On August 12, 2020, The Intercept published an article on chat logs shared with the publication, reporting that the accusations had been organized starting almost a year earlier as part of a sting operation by UMass Amherst College Democrats in an attempt to aid Neal. The released chat logs discussed looking for Morse's dating profiles and how to lead him into saying incriminating things, and their hopes of gaining internships with Neal in exchange. The Neal campaign and the UMass Amherst College Democrats both denied having cooperated. Timothy Ennis, the chief strategist and former president of the UMass Amherst College Democrats, had taken a class with Neal and was highlighted as a driving force behind the allegations, with members of the group saying that Ennis saw Neal as his \\"in\\" for a political career. Former members of UMass Amherst College Democrats alleged an \\"anti-Morse bias\\" in the group. On August 12, Business Insider journalist Grace Panetta wrote on Twitter that she had been contacted anonymously in April 2020 and that the names in the chat logs The Intercept had acquired were the same as those who had written her with vague allegations against Morse. Massachusetts state senator Julian Cyr said the situation showed how \\"vague and anonymous allegations can be easily launched against LGBTQ candidates to destroy their campaigns\\". Journalist Glenn Greenwald expressed a similar sentiment, writing that the allegations were \\"old homophobic tropes\\" and calling the allegations a \\"smear campaign\\". LGBTQ Victory Fund political director Sean Meloy called the incident \\"a series of orchestrated political attacks meant to weaponize Alex’s sexuality and appeal to a homophobic narrative around the sex lives of LGBTQ people.\\" On August 16, 2020, the Sunrise Movement resumed campaigning for Morse. Further reporting by The Intercept alleged that the executive director of the Massachusetts Democratic Party, Veronica Martinez, coordinated with College Democrats before the allegations were made public, and that she \\"demanded records of her communications with CDMA members be destroyed\\" once the allegations were brought into question. Martinez denied the report. In response to evidence and allegations that party officials and elected representatives may have collaborated in originating and circulating the allegations for political gain, more than 50 Massachusetts Democratic State Committee members wrote that the organization's leadership \\"may have behaved unethically\\" and demanded an independent investigation before the September election into \\"what appears to be an unprecedented abuse of power\\". Personal life Morse is Jewish. In 2012, Morse was ranked #9 in Out magazine's annual list of 100 most eligible bachelors; in 2013 the magazine ranked him #66. In response, Morse said, \\"I'd like to thank Out magazine for their recognition. It's always positive to see Holyoke highlighted in national publications.\\" Morse was a lecturer of political science at the University of Massachusetts Amherst from 2014 to 2019. Forbes magazine named Morse in their 2019 30 Under 30 list for Law & Policy, citing his \\"initiatives include offering refuge to Puerto Ricans displaced by Hurricane Maria, encouraging legal marijuana businesses and restoring the city's downtown.\\" Morse's mother suffered from severe mental health issues and his brother struggled with drug addiction; both died during his mayoralty.

It was excavated in the late 18th century, and much of the structure has since been destroyed. Location West Lanyon Quoit is located northwest of Penzance near the road between Madron and Morvah. It stands 300 metres to the southwest of the road. 700 metres to the east stands the much more famous Lanyon Quoit.LANYON QUOIT, Pastscape, retrieved 9 November 2013 Description At the present day all that can be seen of West Lanyon Quoit are two large stones. One support stone (probably the southwest stone of the chamber) is still standing: it is 1.6 metres high and 1.5 metres wide. The capstone, which rests against it, is 4.1 metres long and 2.6 metres wide. Discovery and excavation West Lanyon Quoit was originally covered by a large barrow mound.Glyn Edmund Daniel, (1950), The prehistoric chamber tombs of England and Wales, page 238. Cambridge University Press The burial chamber only came to light in the late 18th century. The account of the discovery was published in volume 14 of Archaeologia in 1803.A Short Account of Three Roman Urns, and a Cromleh, lately discovered in the West of Cornwall, Archaeologia: or, Miscellaneous Tracts, Relating to Antiquity, pages 228-9 This describes how the landowner had directed his servants to remove the earth from the barrow for compost. When the servants had removed \\"near a hundred cart-loads\\" they discovered \\"the supporters of a cromlech, from which the coverstone was slipped off on the fourth side, but still leaning against them.\\" The chamber was orientated north-east to south-west: the northeast end was open.WEST LANYON QUOIT, Pastscape, retrieved 9 November 2013 The chamber was rectangular and its measurements were given as 10 feet by 5 feet by 5 feet. Digging into the chamber led to the discovery of a broken urn, ashes, and some human bones. Given that the chamber was full of mound material, it is now thought that the tomb had been opened previously and that the urn and bones were a secondary, probably Bronze Age, cremation burial.

Early life Emanuel was born in Goulburn in 1860, the son of Solomon Emanuel, Jr. who was a pastoralist and merchant. His grandfather was Samuel Emanuel who had been elected as a member of the Legislative Assembly in New South Wales for the seat of Argyle in 1862. Both Isadore and his brother, Sydney Phillip, were employed in a Sydney livery stable that was a part of the family business. The Kimberley district in Western Australia was opened up for settlement in 1880 and their father joined with Michael and Patrick Durack in seeking large areas of land for settlement along the Ord River. Western Australia In 1881, after the completion of a reconnaissance of the area, the Emanuels resolved to focus on the Fitzroy River valley area in the West Kimberley area. Isadore arrived in 1884 with a flock of 2,860 sheep and established the sheep station, Noonkanbah Station, and the cattle runs, Gogo Station and Lower Liveringa Station. The Emanuels profited by employing competent managers and earned good returns. By 1894 they established a company with Alexander Forrest, called Forrest, Emanuel and Company, creating an effective monopoly in the live cattle trade between Derby and the southern port of Fremantle with the Emanuels acting as agents in the Kimberley. The brothers expanded their pastoral interests by acquiring Meda and Jubilee Downs Stations. Following the death of Forrest in 1901, the Emanuels bought his share of the company. At this stage the Emanuels entered into a business partnership in 1902 with Sidney Kidman and acquired a property in the neighbouring Northern Territory, Victoria River Downs Station. The property occupied an area of and was regarded as one of the largest cattle stations in the world. The Emanuels now controlled a huge area of land in the Kimberley region of Western Australia and Northern Territory with either wholly or partly owned by the brothers. They also held large investments in the meat trade and were briefly the subject of a royal commission as the leaders of a meat ring. In 1909 Kidman and the Emanuels sold Victoria River Downs for £170,000, for which they had paid £20,000, to Bovril Australian Estates. Emanuel died in London in 1954, leaving an estate worth £721,563, of which assets to the value of £290,897 were in Western Australia.

It is striving to create awareness among masses about women’s rights and speaks largely about feminism. In rural areas, women lacked awareness and education however due to media, now they are more aware and the gender pay gap is reducing to a great extent. Many of the people are giving negative opinions regarding the role of media. Media has a detrimental role to play and doesn’t facilitate women in any way. Most of the people were of the opinion that media has projected a negative image of women and brought her weak points to the forefront. The drama industry has a big responsibility to shoulder in this regard. The drama Zindagi Gulzar Hai was a great success by the media in showing a positive image of women in the society and her cultural importance. Most of the time, media shows negative things regarding women but this drama turned the direction to 180 degrees. This drama especially the role of Kashaf should have resulted in the motivation of many females and families who lack sons. Such dramas must be appreciated and more efforts like this must be done to promote the role of women through media.  Template of Drama  Mostly TV Dramas shows that if boy and girl got in friendship, parents think that they're preparing for marriage by asking that for \\"for boys: do she cook food?, is she rich?, do she have dowry?\\", \\"for girls: did he earns?, do he have money?, do he have bank balance, house, cars?\\". another way our media shows, that if girl got seriously involved in altercations with boys, or if boy attack girl or vice versa, then only girls got targeted and then parents started doing her marriage without seeing a boy that can he make her happy?, mostly parents says to only girls that he will make you happy, if you don't do marriage to that boy, we'll get divorced\\".

King went on to start and become the Executor Director of the Alumnae Advisory Center, a career counseling and placement organization for women. Early life King was born in New York City on July 17, 1914, to librarian Marion Morrison King (a relative of Elizabeth Cady Stanton) and banker Frederick Gore King (great grandson of Rufus King).Anonymous. 2007.

After graduating from the Brearley School, King attended Bryn Mawr College and received a bachelor's degree followed by an M.A. in psychology. Career King began her career in 1942 as Warden and Vocational Adviser at Bryn Mawr College. In 1943, she took a job as Personnel Supervisor at Pratt & Whitney. After World War II, King became the Head of the Psychology Department at the Brearley School, the chairperson of the Remedial Reading Department and later Assistant Head of the School. In 1950, King founded the Alumnae Advisory Center as a career counseling and placement service for college women in New York and served as Executive Director there for 27 years. From 1977 to 1979, King served as a consultant for the center before retiring that year. Alumni Advisory Center The Alumnae Advisory Center (1950-early 80s) aimed to help women advance to executive positions, find part-time jobs, or return to work after raising children. The center was located in the Women’s Exchange building, 541 Madison Avenue between 54 and 55 Streets until 1980 when it became known as Council for Career Planning and moved to 310 Madison Avenue. The center first opened with nineteen Founding Member colleges including Barnard College, Bennington College, Bryn Mawr College, Bradford College (United States), Centenary College of New Jersey, Colby, Connecticut, Goucher College, Howard University, Keukia, Middlebury, Pemborke, Sarah Lawrence, Swarthmore, Vassar College, Wells College, Western, Hobart and William Smith Colleges, and Wooster. Members of the Board of Directors included individuals like Sarah Gibson Blanding. Although the center made its services available to men, it was not until the 1970s with newly formed co-educational colleges that its male clientele increased. Dolly Cannon became Executive Director in 1977. The Center moved to 310 Madison Avenue in 1980. Personal life King’s writings were published in magazines such as Good Housekeeping and Glamour and in newspapers including The New York Times, The Christian Science Monitor, Today’s Secretary and the Ridgefield Press. King published at least three books including “Women in Business” (Dutton, 1964), “Help Wanted: Female” (Scribner’s, 1968) and “Women And Careers In the Big Apple” (Alumnae Advisory Center, 1983).

Appearance The New Zealand Defence Meritorious Service Medal is made of silver and circular in shape. The obverse of the medal bears the effigy of the Sovereign, currently the effigy designed by Ian Rank-Broadley, surrounded by the Royal Styles and Titles for New Zealand. The reverse bears the inscriptions FOR MERITORIOUS SERVICE and HE TOHU HIRANGA surrounded by a wreath of fern fronds surmounted by St Edward's Crown. The medal was designed by the New Zealand Herald of Arms, Phillip O’Shea . O’Shea has designed many of the New Zealand awards created since 1973. The medal is suspended from crimson ribbon, wide, with three central stripes of white, green, and white with two narrow yellow stripes at the edges. Crimson has served as the ribbon color of long service and merit awards, starting with the Army Long Service and Good Conduct Medal in 1830. In 1887, a distinctive New Zealand award the New Zealand Long and Efficient Service Medal utilised a crimson ribbon with two white centre stripes. The imperial Meritorious Service Medal for New Zealand and the subsequent 1985 New Zealand Meritorious Service Medal also used a crimson ribbon, but with a green centre stripe. The ribbon of the New Zealand Defence Meritorious Service Medal integrates the green centre stripe, flanked by two white stripes recalling the history of and linking this medal to the awards that came before. The yellow edge stripes represent achievement or brilliance. Subsequent awards of the medal will be depicted by bars made of silver and silver-gilt bearing a single fern frond. In undress, when a service ribbon is worn alone, a small silver rosette may be worn on the ribbon for each of the first three bars awarded. When a fourth bar is awarded, the silver rosettes are replaced by a silver-gilt rosette. An additional silver-gilt rosette is worn for each subsequent bar conferred.

The developing cyclone was first detected on April 3, while situated well to the northeast of Vanuatu. As atmospheric conditions became more conducive to intensification, the disturbance gradually consolidated as it drifted toward the west-southwest. After receiving the name Sose on April 5, the cyclone was driven southeastward, passing just west of Espiritu Santo and neighboring islands. Although it never made landfall, Sose was particularly expansive, producing a wide area of gale-force winds. The cyclone peaked in strength between April 7 and 8 with maximum 10-minute sustained winds of 110 km/h (70 mph) and 1-minute sustained winds of 130 km/h (80 mph), placing it at Category 2 intensity on the Australian tropical cyclone intensity scale. Ultimately, stronger wind shear and an increasingly hostile upper-air pattern took their toll on the cyclone as it progressed due south; Sose lost tropical characteristics to the northeast of Norfolk Island by April 12. The extratropical remnants of Sose continued into the Tasman Sea. Occurring just two months after Cyclone Paula affected Vanuatu, Sose compounded the damage already done by the previous storm, especially to crops and farmlands. Throughout the island chain, two people lost their lives to the storm. Roadways were blocked by debris and floodwaters, while schools and classrooms on several islands were damaged or ruined. The storm destroyed about 200 homes around the nation and damaged many more, particularly on southern Espiritu Santo. The storm's large fetch generated enormous swells as far away as Australia's Eastern Seaboard, where surfers took advantage of the abnormally intense conditions and two swimmers drowned. On Maré Island in New Caledonia, a man was swept away by a large wave and presumed dead. The storm later produced torrential rainfall and strong winds over the North Island of New Zealand, sparking damaging freshwater floods and downing trees and power lines. Hazardous driving conditions in the Waikato region led to a fatal traffic accident in which three people died. Another individual drowned in a swollen river. Sose reportedly contributed to coastal flooding as far away as Tonga. In all, Sose killed nine people; total monetary damage is unknown. As a result of the storm's destruction, its name was later retired. Meteorological history Cyclone Sose originated in a broad area of disturbed weather first identified on April 3, well to the east- northeast of Vanuatu. The system initially drifted generally toward the west under an improving upper-level wind shear pattern that began to catalyze favorable outflow. Late on April 4, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert on the disturbance, noting strong banding features and a well-defined low-level center of circulation. Tropical Depression 13F formed at 1200 UTC next day as examined by the Fiji Meteorological Service (FMS), the local Regional Specialized Meteorological Center. At the time, the new cyclone was situated about to the northwest of Espiritu Santo. The JTWC's official \\"best track\\" entry on the storm-- designated 19P--first lists it as a tropical depression at 1800 UTC on April 4, though operationally, the agency did not issue its first tropical cyclone warning until late on April 5. The storm proceeded slowly westward and gradually continued to organize, its intensification hindered by residual wind shear and its proximity to the mountainous terrain of Espiritu Santo. However, convection over the center continued to develop, and consequently the FMS upgraded 13F to Tropical Cyclone Sose at 1800 UTC. Sose remained nearly stationary for a period of 24 hours, blocked by a strong subtropical ridge to the south. Over the course of April 6, an approaching mid-level trough of low pressure created a weakness in the ridge, allowing Sose to accelerate southeastward. The storm's environment steadily improved in both the lower and upper levels, triggering the consolidation of deep convection around the center. As a result, early on April 7, a central dense overcast formed. According to the FMS, Sose reached its peak strength at 1800 UTC, with maximum 10-minute sustained winds of 110 km/h (70 mph) and a central barometric pressure of . The cyclone passed just to the west of the islands of Vanuatu as its outer bands contracted around the well-defined central dense overcast. A large feeder band persisted on the eastern side of the circulation, bridging the northwestern southeastern quadrants. The feature became a notable aspect of the cyclone's satellite presentation. The JTWC estimated that 19P reached its peak intensity at 1200 UTC on April 8, possessing 1-minute sustained winds of 130 km/h (80 mph) and gusts up to 170 km/h (105 mph). The Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission imaged the storm shortly thereafter, and revealed a distinct eye about 44 km (27 mi) across, bounded on the southern semicircle by strong convection activity. Sose made its closest approach to New Caledonia early on April 8, passing about 280 km (175 mi) to the northeast. A strong area of high pressure over New Zealand served to tighten to surface pressure gradient well to the south of Sose's center, contributing to an overall very large envelope of gale-force winds. In turn, the cyclone affected numerous islands on both side of its path, despite never having made landfall. As it progressed on its southeastward track, the cyclone began to show signs of weakening, at least partially due to increasing wind shear from an approaching upper trough. At the same time, a mid-level ridge to the east forced the storm to turn due south; the conflicting wind patterns undermined the cyclone's circulation, causing its center at the surface to separate from the deep convection. Both the FMS and the JTWC reflected steady weakening, and by early on April 10, the center had become exposed and ill-defined. Sose then entered the area of responsibility of the Tropical Cyclone Warning Center in Wellington, New Zealand, where it continued to deteriorate. The JTWC issued its last warning on 19P at 0600 UTC on April 11, while the system was located about 335 km (210 mi) northeast of Norfolk Island. TCWC Wellington soon downgraded Sose to a tropical depression as it underwent an extratropical transition. Drifting south-southwestward, the cyclone lost its tropical identity early on April 12. The remnant low ultimately moved over the Tasman Sea, where it was absorbed by a broad low pressure system about to travel over New Zealand's North Island. Abundant residual tropical moisture acted on the low pressure environment to create widespread precipitation across northern New Zealand. Impact and aftermath Annotated map of Vanuatu; click to enlarge Prior to the storm's passage of New Caledonia, residents there were advised to take basic precautions, such as remaining indoors during bouts of inclement weather. Storm warnings were hoisted over the Loyalty Islands and South Province. Vanuatu's Department of Meteorology began posting official alerts on April 7. Warnings for heavy rains and strong winds were posted throughout northern New Zealand in anticipation of the storm's remnants. With Easter weekend, more motorists were already expected to be traveling longer distances, and officials grew concerned of dangerous effects on traffic from the cyclone. Police increased their presence to unprecedented levels in an attempt to control speeding and other hazardous behaviors. Due to the storm's \\"negative impact on one or more countries\\", Sose was retired from the cyclical list of tropical cyclone names; Vanuatu Sose predominately affected the western islands of Vanuatu, starting from the north. Most severely impacted were the islands of Espiritu Santo, Malakula, Aoba, Efate, Erromango, Tanna, Aneityum, and the Shepherd Islands. In several locations, Sose compounded or worsened the destruction wrought by Cyclone Paula in late February and early March. The storm produced significant precipitation, heavy seas, and sustained winds exceeding 100 km/h (60 mph). A resident of Malakula was struck and killed by a falling coconut while seeking shelter from the worsening conditions. Agriculture on nearby Ahamb Island, already impaired by Paula, was further compromised; all crops, both those remaining after Paula and those planted in the intervening time, were destroyed. Four classrooms on the small island were also damaged beyond use. Buildings on Aoba incurred appreciable damage, while on Efate, the storm brought down utility poles, severely damaged local schools, and left roads covered with debris and floodwaters. Flooding in the nation's capital city of Port Vila forced 50 residents to leave their homes in search of higher ground. Espiritu Santo, particularly the island's south shore around Luganville, bore the brunt of Cyclone Sose. Several types of crops (also weakened by Paula) took a heavy beating, and 60 people had to evacuate due to encroaching floods. In total, the storm demolished 59 houses on the island and in some way damaged another 101. A young child drowned after being swept away while attempting to cross a swollen waterway. Just offshore, the M/V Omale succumbed to the heavy seas; all 16 of its occupants successfully swam four hours to shore. Overall, the Vanuatu National Disaster Management Office estimated at least 50% each of food crops and buildings in the hardest- hit provinces were left in a state of damage. The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs considered about 200 residences throughout the island nation \\"lost\\" to the storm. The National Disaster Committee met on April 9 to discuss potential emergency aid for residents of the areas hardest hit by cyclones Sose and Paula. Around the same time, the Vanuatu Red Cross stated that it would distribute supplies such as materials for makeshift shelters and water purification tablets. The Red Cross was also to provide 500 bags of rice to villages in the Shepherd Islands. Political unrest on a national level limited the government's attention to initial recovery; it did not immediate declare a state of emergency or file any requests for international aid. New Zealand and Australia The remnants of Cyclone Sose were a significant factor in stormy weather over the North Island of New Zealand between April 12 and April 14. Numerous locations received 10 to 20 cm (3.9 to 7.9 in) of rainfall, and of precipitation fell at Glenbervie, Northland region, in just seven hours. The heavy rainfall rates caused \\"significant\\" flooding of low-lying roads and farmlands in the region. Floodwaters inundated the township of Kaeo and entered several local businesses. The swollen Kaeo River temporarily rendered New Zealand State Highway 10 impassable to most vehicles at a bridge over the waterway. A hospital became isolated from the rest of the town. Further to the west, State Highway 1 was blocked by flooding at Rangiahua, as was State Highway 2 between Te Puke and Te Maunga Junction. At the former, the rains triggered a landslide and polluted the local supply of drinking water. Several residences throughout the region sustained damage. A 22-year-old man drowned in high waters along the Wairoa River. Rising waters from the Kerikeri River threatened to affect the Mission House, the nation's oldest surviving building, where staff were on standby to relocate furnishings if necessary. Satellite image, taken at 0000 UTC on April 12, of the weakening tropical cyclone as it approached the North Island of New Zealand A severe traffic accident occurred on State Highway 28 at Tapapa, Waikato, on the morning of April 13. The head-on collision was attributed to slick roads resulting from the storm. Three individuals were killed and two more were hospitalized. Several other accidents were reported around the same time. In addition to the rainfall, strong winds brought down trees and utility poles across the island and as far south as Marlborough on the South Island. There, the strong winds fanned a large fire ignited by sparks from downed power lines. The fire covered more than 70 hectares (175 acres) of land and prompted several families to evacuate their homes. Three people were injured at Ohakune after a temporary tent collapsed at a local festival. Along the coast, swells triggered by Sose reached in height. The tight pressure gradient between Cyclone Sose and the ridge to its south generated extremely rough seas along the eastern coast of Australia, especially Queensland. Along the state's southern shore, normally protected from strong swells, waves were as high as 8 m (26 ft) and frequently between 4-5 m (13-16 ft). A 53-year-old man and his 9-year-old son both drowned in the heavy surf near Gladstone on April 8. Offshore Kingscliff, New South Wales, a yacht capsized, forcing its two occupants to swim to land. The large swells proved popular with experienced surfers looking for a challenge. Although the event became infamous within local surfing circles, at least one surfer was hospitalized after being swept against rocks, and several others required rescue. Some beach erosion was reported in several locations, leading to minor sandbagging efforts to hamper the erosion. Elsewhere A large wave breaking on the cliffs of Maré Island in New Caledonia swept away a spectator, who was presumed dead after the rough conditions delayed searching efforts. The storm disrupted classes and school activities in parts of the archipelago, but little to no damage was reported. The distant cyclone sent large swells toward Tonga and Samoa, coinciding with high astronomical tides. Coastal flooding on low-lying islands of Tonga reportedly destroyed houses and crops.

Cavalera's excitement for this song  Max Cavalera commented on the Roadrunner website about this song, \\"I'm excited to open the record with a fast song. Usually Soulfly albums begin mid-tempo, but this reminds me of 'Beneath the Remains.' This song also has one of the biggest hooks I've ever done. I can close my eyes and picture huge festival crowds singing it. When the fast part comes in, it's just war.\\" David Vincent, Morbid Angel frontman, is the guest that greatly satisfied Cavalera, \\"His screaming on that song was off the wall!\\"  Lyrics  The lyrics explore each word of the song title, when hate fuels war involving fire resulting in blood. 'Blood, Fire, War, Hate' is repeated 36 times during the song including 18 lines in a row to start the song and 10 in a row to end it, plus the extension 'Blood Fire War Hate will never end' to end the chorus. Variations of Blood Fire War Hate are sung, such as 'Blood, Fire, Hell, Heaven', 'Blood, Fire, War, Kill', and 'Blood, Fire, War, Dust'.

Collectively, the parks are located approximately southeast of Melbourne, between Coal Point in the west to Wreck Creek in the east, and are used for walking, picnicking, boating, education and research. The Bunurong Marine Park comprises two separate areas along of coastline and was gazetted on . The broad rock platforms and underwater reefs of Bunurong Marine Park support a remarkable range of habitats, containing a diverse array of plants and animals. The Bunurong Coastal Park includes the narrow strip of public land adjacent to Bunurong Marine Park and Bunurong Marine National Park, between the eastern boundary of the Cape Paterson Foreshore Reserve at Undertow Bay in the west and Wreck Creek in the east, and was gazetted in June 1984. Both parks draw their name from the Australian Aboriginal Bunurong people who are the traditional owners of the land and water in the region. Etymology The Bunurong parks are named after the Bunurong Aboriginal people who owned this stretch of coast for thousands of years prior to colonisation. The Boakoolawal clan lived in the Kilcunda area south of the Bass River, and the Yowenjerre were west of the Tarwin River along what is now the Bunurong Marine and Coastal Parks near Wonthaggi. Middens containing charcoal and shellfish mark the location of their campsites along the coast. Features The principal features of the park are the striking rock formations including the large rock structure called Eagles Nest, located adjacent to the coastline at the eastern end of the marine national park. Eagles Nest also resembles the top half of a map of Australia. Other attractions include Flat Rocks where there are large rockpools for rockpool rambling and direct access from Cape Paterson-Inverloch Road. The Bunurong Marine National Park is accessed at many different points along this coast, a popular one being near Cape Paterson caravan park on Surf Beach Road as it has a modified rockpool for swimming. Direct and more difficult access to the marine national park is via car parks off Cape Paterson-Inverloch Road. Exploring, snorkelling and scuba diving are popular. There are boat launching facilities at Inverloch on Anderson Inlet. Australia’s first dinosaur bone, the Cape Paterson Claw, was discovered in 1903 by William Ferguson at what is now Bunurong Marine Park at Eagles Nest beach in Inverloch. Since then more than bones and teeth of small dinosaurs, mammals, birds, turtles and fish have been excavated. There is a dinosaur exhibition at the Inverloch Shell Museum. Ecology Together with the Bunurong Marine National Park, the Bunurong Marine and Coastal Parks support many marine animals including seastars, featherstars, crabs, snails, 87 species of fish, whales and seals. It has the highest recorded diversity of intertidal and subtidal invertebrates in eastern Victoria. The range of seaweed species is large. Restrictions It is prohibited to kill or take any matter (i.e., catch fish, collect seashells or kill or take any sea or land creature, living or dead) from the Bunurong Marine National Park, but fishing (only with a rod) is permitted in the Bunurong Marine Park.

Abdul Razzaq was found mutilated after he had been reported missing since 24 March 2013 and found dead in Karachi, Pakistan. Personal He was reported to be around 35–42 years old at the time of his death. Career Abdul Razzaq was a journalist and an activist. He was a copy editor/sub editor at nationalist newspaper Daily Tawar (Voice). A Urdu newspaper printed from Mustang, Balochistan. Death Abdul Razzaq Baloch was reported missing by his sister on March 24, 2013 in Karachi. Razzaq was last seen leaving a friend's house in the Liyari neighborhood of Karachi, which is a district severely affected by the ethnic and gang warfare. His body was found mutilated, tortured along with signs of strangulation on August 21, 2013 in Surjani Town area of Karachi. According to reports, the bodies of Abdul Razzaq Baloch and Pattan Bugti a resident of Hub, were found tortured to death and thrown away in Sarjani town of Karachi. Razzaq's body was found with a piece of paper suggesting he was the missing journalist from the Daily Tawar. Seaeda Sarbazi, Mr. Razzaq's sister was adamant on the identities of the kidnappers as Baloch Liberation Army, a terrorist group operating in Balochistan. The family decided on a second look at the body to truly identify him. Once Razzaq 's body was found it took his family 24 hours to be able to identify him due to the severe trauma to his body. The childhood stains on Abdul's nails were how the family was finally able to truly identify him and bury him in the Mewa Shah graveyard. The childhood stains on Abdul's nails were how the family was finally able to truly identify him. Context There had been at least 16 bodies of Baluch individuals 6 of them journalists and 4 of them were Balochistan, which were found in the Surjani Town area of Karachi within the six months prior to Razzaq's death. Impact Certain districts of Balochistan are no longer considered safe for journalists, and are becoming dangerous places to report from. When it would come to security or armed struggles, journalists would not report any mishaps due to it endangering their lives or to avoid being threatened. Reactions Protests were held at the Karachi Press Club.Abdul Razzaq left the Daily Tawar, which is known for its coverage of conflicts happening between rival groups along with the government, after a fellow journalist was found dead after going missing. With Razzaq being the 7th reporter to go missing and later found dead due to several reasons this brings up questions to who and what is causing these happenings. After the disappearance of Razzaq, his family had protested holding banners and posters outside of a Karachi Press Club trying to spread the word of their missing family member.

IPAA was established in South Australia in 1927 and since 1984 has had divisions in each state and territory. Initially associated with the Royal Institute of Public Administration based in London, IPAA became an independent national organisation on 1 January 1980. IPAA’s strategic direction is set by a National Council — with an executive and representatives from each IPAA division — supported by a national office. As part of its commitment to the study and practice of public administration, public management and policy making in Australia, IPAA has produced the quarterly journal Australian Journal of Public Administration since 1937. IPAA delivers an annual national conference. At the dinner preceding the conference, IPAA recognises practitioners and researchers who have made an outstanding contribution to the practice and study of public administration with the Sam Richardson Award. Members who have made outstanding contributions to public service and to IPAA are also announced as National Fellows. IPAA membership is open to public servants, academics and those with an interest in public administration. IPAA divisions are the engine room for local events, professional development opportunities and other member activities. History The Institute was founded in South Australia in 1927 as a Regional Group of the Institute of Public Administration. Regional groups were subsequently formed in each Australian state and territory: Victoria (1929), New South Wales (1935), Queensland (1951–2012; 2017), Papua and New Guinea (1952–1968), Western Australia (1944), Papua and New Guinea (1952-1968), Australian Capital Territory (1953), Tasmania (1953), Northern Territory (1954-1968; 1984). On 1 January 1980 ties were cut with the Royal Institute of Public Administration and a new entity came into existence: the Australian Institute of Public Administration. Over time the organisation had several name changes — Royal Australian Institute of Public Administration (1982), Royal Institute of Public Administration Australia (1991) — until eventually settling on Institute of Public Administration Australia (1996). The first conference of the then Australian Regional Groups of the Institute of Public Administration was held in Canberra from 6–7 November 1958 with a focus on dealing with problems of recruitment in public administration in Australia. A national conference has been held every year since. In 1959 the Australian Capital Territory Regional Group established the Garran Oration to provide a link between the memory of Sir Robert Garran GCMG and the subject of public administration. The first Garran Oration was delivered by Harry Frederick Ernest \\"Fred\\" Whitlam LLB, a former Crown Solicitor of the Commonwealth of Australia. The Garran Oration has since become one of IPAA's richest and most public contributions to discussion and debate on public administration. In 1982 the National Council assumed responsibility for the Garran Oration from the ACT Division. Since then the Garran Oration has been delivered by four Australian Prime Ministers (Hawke 1988, Howard 1997, Rudd 2009 and Gillard 2011); a former Prime Minister of New Zealand (Key, 2017); three State Premiers (Bannon, 1986, Lawrence 1992 and Baird 2015); four Aboriginal leaders (O’Donoghue 1991, Turner 1996, Pearson 2014 and Dodson 2019); as well as a Governor-General, senior Government Ministers and public servants; and leaders from industry, defence, the legal and medical professions and academia.

Family background and early life Robertson was the second son of Margaret Whyte and William Robertson senior, who went to Victoria from Tasmania in 1812, and purchased the Colac estate from the late Captain Foster Fyans. Robertson, sen., was for many years engaged in pastoral pursuits at Campbelltown, between Hobart and Launceston, and he afterwards entered into business as a merchant in Hobart, where his son William was born in the year 1839. The latter received his education at the High School in Hobart and at Wadham College, Oxford, where he graduated B.A. in 1861. He was called to the Bar at the Middle Temple in January 1863. While at Oxford he rowed in the Oxford and Cambridge annual boat race on the Thames in 1861, and was one of the winning crew, being the first of several young Australians who have taken part in the great inter-university race. The oar used on that occasion, converted into a trophy of the victory and appropriately mounted and inscribed, was always one of Robertson's proudest possessions. Legal career In 1863 Robertson returned to Victoria, where he was admitted to the Bar in the following year. For several years Robertson practised as a barrister in Melbourne, but he never exerted himself to any great extent in that direction. Politics Robertson was elected to the Legislative Assembly in the seat of Polwarth and South Grenville in April 1871, holding it until the election of March 1874. He won the seat again in the election of 28 February 1880 being sworn-in March 1880, but lost it again at the 14 July 1880 election. He regained the seat at a by-election in August 1881 and held it until February 1886, when he was elected to the Legislative Council for South Western Province at a by-election. Late life In 1888 Robertson obtained leave of absence for the purpose of making another trip to the old country, and upon his term of office expiring in the same year he retired finally from Parliamentary work. For some years after the death of William Robertson, sen., the combined property was worked by the brothers in partnership, and the firm of Robertson Brothers became famous throughout Australia for the great annual sales of shorthorn cattle which were initiated. The herd had been commenced by Robertson, sen., at least a quarter of a century before, and he spared neither time nor money to procure some of the best strains of blood then extant. The stock had been kept perfectly pure, and in 1875 the brothers began a series of annual drafts from their herd, which were submitted at auction year by year and realised almost fabulous prices. On each occasion stock-breeders flocked to Colac from all the Australian colonies, New Zealand, and Tasmania. At one sale the prices paid aggregated upwards of £30,000, and at another the total receipts were £25,800. On one occasion the firm purchased from the estate of the late Richard Morton thirty- seven prime shorthorns, known previously as the Mount Derrimut herd, for £27,000, the sum of £2,500 being paid for one of the bulls: Oxford Cherry Duke. The last sale of the regular series took place in 1884, and in 1885 the famous \\"F.F.\\" herd was dispersed, owing to the dissolution of the partnership which had till then subsisted between Messrs. Robertson Brothers and the executors of the late John Robertson, the surviving brothers having decided to confine their attention almost exclusively to sheep-breeding. On 24 April 1863 William Robertson married Martha Mary, second daughter of J. R. Murphy, of Melbourne. Robertson's eldest son, William St. Leger, was educated at Oxford, and during his stay there had the same pleasant experience as his father of being one of the winning crew in the annual boat race against Cambridge. He afterwards settled at Broome, Western Australia, as resident partner with the Messrs. Streeter, of London, in the pearl fishing industry and in squatting pursuits in the Kimberley district. Robertson died at Colac on 24 June 1892.

Each tract contains millions of neuronal connections. HDFT is based on data acquired from diffusion spectrum imaging and processed by generalized q-sampling imaging. The technique makes it possible to virtually dissect 40 major fiber tracts in the brain. The HDFT scan is consistent with brain anatomy unlike diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). Thus, the use of HDFT is essential in pinpointing damaged neural connections.  History  Traditional DTI uses six diffusivity characteristics to model how water molecules diffuse in brain tissues and makes axonal fiber tracking possible. However, DTI had a major limitation in resolving axons from different tracts intersected and crossed en route to their target. In 2009, Learning Research & Development Center (LRDC) at University of Pittsburgh launched the 2009 Pittsburgh Brain Competition to invite the best research team to work on this problem. A prize of $10,000 was offered to the team that could track optic radiations, and teams from 168 countries took part in the competition. A winning team from Taiwan revealed Meyer’s loop, which no other team had successfully tracked. The key of the method was multiple observations of water molecules and improved algorithms to better capture how axons connects brain regions. The technique was further developed as HDFT between the University of Pittsburgh and Carnegie Mellon University. HDFT is currently used by UPMC neurosurgery department to provide neurosurgical planning, neuro- structural damage assessment, intraoperative navigation, and evaluation of changes and responses to rehabilitation therapy after brain surgery.  Applications  HDFT has been applied to traumatic brain injury (TBI) to identify which brain connections have been broken and which are still intact. HDFT allows neurosurgeons to localize fiber breaks caused by traumatic brain injuries to provide better diagnoses and prognoses. It could also provide an objective way of identifying brain injury, predicting outcome and planning rehabilitation. HDFT can also be used to determine the optimal surgical approach for difficult-to-reach tumors and vascular malformations.

It subsequently came to refer more specifically to painters who had their workshops in medieval Cologne and the lower-Rhine region from about 1300 to 1550 (; ).  Style periods  Inner left and right panels of the St Bartholomew Altarpiece (c.1510) Initially smaller altarpieces such as the Klaren Altar in the Cologne Cathedral from about 1360–70 were created, based on book paintings from around the year 1300 . The mid-15th century is the high-point of this school, when Stefan Lochner (active 1442–1451) created the Altar of the City Patrons, which is considered to be the greatest masterpiece of the Cologne School . A third creative period followed, under the influence of Netherlandish painters such as Rogier van der Weyden . Rogier's influence is especially notable in the work of the outstanding representative of this final phase, the anonymous painter known as the Master of the Saint Bartholomew Altarpiece. For example, the latter's large Deposition of Christ resembles the same theme represented in the former's Escorial altarpiece, and the Master's heightened naturalism and emphasis on tear-stained features reflect Rogier's emotionalism .  Painters of the Cologne School  Deposition of Christ by the Master of the Life of the Virgin The artists of the Cologne School include Stefan Lochner and William of Cologne, as well as a number of artists identified only by the works they created: * *Master of the Saint Bartholomew Altarpiece  Master of the Life of the Virgin  Master of the Wasservass Calvary Master of the Sinzig Calvary  The Cologne artists' quarter  The Cologne painters worked mainly in the area of Old Cologne around the Schildergasse, the artists' quarter, where sign painters were also active .

This place was built on May 1, 2002, to commemorate the 2002 Korea- Japan World Cup Games and the new millennium. World Cup Park is made up of five parks: Pyeonghwa (Peace) Park, Haneul (Sky) Park, Noeul (Sunset) Park, Nanjicheon Park, and Hangang Riverside Park.  History = Nanjido  In late 1970s, a small islet in the northwest part of Seoul, called Nanjido, was made into a landfill due to the waste disposal problem that arose, due to the rapid development of Seoul into a metropolitan city. The park was once a 15-year-old landfill that consisted with 92 million tons of garbage, and it took 6 years to stabilize, and an extra year to build the park. The 2002 Korea-Japan World Cup Games led to the rebirth of Nanjido as an eco-friendly area. Nanjido was developed by Nanji which is a branch of Hangang parting from the main river around Mangwonjeong and then rejoins the river near Haengjusansung(Hill Fortress). This place was used a dock for boating till the late Joseon period. Before 1978 when the place was used as a landfill, peanuts and millet were cultivated on this land.  Five Parks = Pyeonghwa (Peace) Park  Located on the opposite side of Seoul World Cup Stadium, it is the main park of World Cup Park created to commemorate the 2002 Korea-Japan World Cup Games. Its name was given to symbolize world peace and unity. There is UNICEF Plaza, Nanji Pond, Peace Park, Hope Forest, and the World Cup Park Museum.  Haneul Park  Like its name Haneul, which means sky in Korean, the park is situated at World Cup Park's highest point. The Haneul stairs consist of 291 stairs and have become a tourist attraction. Situated at the highest point in World Cup Park, there are observation points on the sloping sides of the park.  Noeul Park  Noeul Park is one of the favored parks in Seoul. The park contains wild animals such as deer, wildcats and raccoons. There is a sculpture park which is a themed space with nature and cultural art works displayed on green lawns.  Nanjicheon Park  Nanjicheon Park was built along the Nanji Stream, which flowed under the Haneul Park. The stream was filled with sewage but it is now purified. It has an outdoor stage and various sports facilities.  Hangang Riverside Park (Nanji Area)  Hangang Riverside Park was built on the banks of Han River (Korea). It has soccer field, basketball court, grass field, River cruise ship port, and an area for nature-studies.
