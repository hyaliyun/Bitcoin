Built in 1873 to an Italian Romanesque Revival design, it served this part of eastern Brighton for more than a century until its closure in 1989, after which it became a recording studio. It is owned by Brighton College, an independent school based nearby. The building has been listed at Grade II in view of its architectural importance. History Brighton's first Methodist church opened in 1808 in Dorset Gardens off St James's Street, a recently developed road east of the Old Steine and the Royal Pavilion. By the 1870s, housing had spread much further east, and the area between Thomas Read Kemp's high-class Kemp Town estate and the earlier development around St James's Street had been filled in with high-density housing. The area became known as Kemptown . In 1872, Reverend J. Martin, a Methodist minister, proposed the construction of a new church to serve this area. Architect Thomas Lainson, who also designed several buildings (including a Congregational church) in Hove and the Middle Street Synagogue in Brighton, was commissioned to draw up a design. He submitted this on 1 March 1872. A builder named John Fielder was responsible for construction, which continued through 1873. A stone tablet (now partly illegible) at the base of the tower, dated 7 October 1873, names Lainson, Fielder and Reverend Martin, and bears the inscription . The church was part of the Wesleyan Methodist tradition, and during the early 20th century became part of a circuit of six local Wesleyan churches; the others were the nearby Dorset Gardens Methodist Church (also in Kemptown), Hove Methodist Church, and others in Hurstpierpoint, Portslade and Southwick. A closure proposal was announced in 1987. In 1989, the congregation moved out and began to share St Mary the Virgin, a nearby Anglican church. After this, the building was sold and converted into a recording studio. It is now owned by Brighton College. The former church was listed at Grade II on 26 August 1999. It is one of 1,124 Grade II-listed buildings and structures, and 1,218 listed buildings of all grades, in the city of Brighton and Hove. Architecture Thomas Lainson adopted the Italian Romanesque Revival style for his design. The building is of brown and red brick, laid in the English bond pattern, with dressings of stone and pale brick. There is a tower at the southeast corner, rising in three stages and capped by a short spire and a lead roof. Most of the main roof area is laid with slate, but there is one timber-framed section as well. The south face has a stair turret at the southwest corner and the tower at the opposite corner; and between these is the entrance porch, a portico with three arches separated by columns of granite topped with abaci of stone. Three round-arched windows, with stone surrounds and an architrave, are above this; and the façade is completed by a rose window below the gabled roof. There is another entrance in a small porch on the east face of the tower. The internal layout consisted of a three-bay nave leading into a sanctuary, and a single-storey vestry with four arched stone-dressed windows on the northeast side.

C. Beaton (Marion Chesney), first published in 1996. It is set in the fictional town of Lochdubh, Scotland featuring the local constable Hamish Macbeth.  Plot introduction  Randy Duggan is the macho man of the title of this work of fiction. He claims to be a professional wrestler and he becomes known in the small village of Lochdubh for his tall stories. When Randy is found murdered, Constable Hamish Macbeth hopes that the killer is not one of the villagers. However, there is enough local resentment against Randy, that someone in quiet, peaceful Lochdubh may have been driven to slaying this macho man.  Plot  Randy Duggan arrives in Lochdubh claiming to be an American professional wrestler. A huge, muscular man, he dominates the bar in Lochdubh's pub. At first the locals are enthralled by Randy's fascinating stories of his apparently exciting life and his generosity with paying for drinks. Their interest begins to pall when they realise that Randy's accent, when he is drunk, betrays his Scottish origins and that he is a braggart and a bully and openly insults the local men, including Geordie Mackenzie, a mild retired school teacher and local fisherman, Archie Maclean. Both the latter are heard to claim that they will kill Randy. Constable Hamish Macbeth intervenes in a verbal argument between Randy Duggan and Geordie Mackenzie. Randy claims that Hamish is hiding behind his uniform and would not consider challenging Randy as a civilian. Hamish accepts the challenge and agrees to face Randy in a fight. Hamish bitterly regrets this challenge next day, but as the whole village of Lochdubh has turned out to witness the fight, Hamish decides he must go through with it. Randy does not meet the appointed time for the fight. Archie Maclean volunteers to go to Randy's cottage to insist he meet this commitment. Archie finds Randy's very dead body. And Hamish Macbeth is a suspect in the death of a macho man. Hamish knows that the detective team from the fictional town of Strathbane, led by his archenemy, Chief Inspector Blair, will question his actions in arranging a fight with the deceased. He is in trouble, but pretends that he did not intend to engage in a fight, but rather have the whole village witness Hamish berate Randy Duggan for his loutish behaviour and his rudeness to the local people. To Blair's disgust, this explanation is accepted. Hamish discovers that the macho man has been involved with many of the villagers. Several women in particular appear to have been smitten by Randy's macho charm. One of these women is Rosie Draly, a writer of romantic historical fiction. When Rosie is murdered, Hamish is baffled to find a connection between her death and the death of Randy Duggan. Blair is convinced that he has solved the case. Rosie's brother in law, passionately in love with her for many years, confesses to killing her and Randy Duggan. Rosie would not consent to marry her brother in law and he was jealous of Randy's attentions to Rosie. Blair is happy to have the murders solved. Hamish is not convinced that Rosie's brother in law killed Duggan and makes this known. Hamish, with his usual reliance on his intuition and following up possible although apparently unlikely leads, unearths the truth. Rosie was murdered by her brother in law, but Randy Duggan was not. The murderer of the macho man was in Lochdubh all the time. Hamish saves Priscilla Halburton-Smythe from a murderous kidnapper and shoots this man. In doing so, Hamish has revealed the solution to a long unsolved crime in Scotland and proven the identity of the mysterious \\"Gentleman Jim\\", the brains behind this notorious crime. Despite his success, Hamish is once again out of favour with his superiors in Strathbane. Hamish is deemed to be too unorthodox, too much a maverick to be allowed to remain in the police force. The villagers of Lochdubh march into Strathbane and demand that their village constable retains his position in Lochdubh. Given the media coverage of his success and the flashing cameras and television crews accompanying the villagers' march, his superiors agree that Constable Macbeth is best left alone to police his beloved village.

The PSI changed its name to the Islamic Association Party of Indonesia (PSII) in 1929 and in the next few years attacked nationalism of other parties, claiming that nationalism came from men rather than God. The party's fortunes waned in 1934 when the Dutch colonial authorities clamped down on nationalist activities and party leader Tjokroaminoto died. Following this, political Islam broke into factions. In 1942 the occupying Japanese banned all political activity.Ricklefs (1991) pp. 174-190 However, in 1943 the Japanese established an organization called Masyumi in an attempt to control Islam in Indonesia.

Settled in the 1850s, ten buildings built between 1883 and 1930 still stand, including the cross-wing western farmhouse. These ten structures comprise the buildings added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2007 as an example of a farm in the region from the turn of the 20th century. Until the 1950s the farm was used to grow seeds, including rye grass and vetch. Listed buildings on the property include a barn, smokehouse, pumphouse, woodshed, and privy. History Farming here began in 1851, when Carlos Dudley Wilcox and his wife Elizabeth settled a Donation Land Claim on the Tualatin Plains in Washington County, Oregon. Carlos had immigrated to the Oregon Country in 1847 with his parents and married the 15-year-old Elizabeth Scoggin on July 3, 1851. The couple had five children on their farm, though Carlos sold in 1857. In 1872, the Wilcoxes divorced, with Elizabeth gaining the southern part of the farm and Carlos the northern part, of which he sold half in 1874. Elizabeth remarried on January 29, 1874, to native New Yorker Louis Manning. Manning, born in 1836, had previously lived in Kansas, Ohio, Colorado, and Eastern Oregon before settling in Washington County. On Elizabeth's farm, the two raised her children from the prior marriage and grew various crops. They built a new farmhouse on the property between 1876 and 1883. The Mannings also built a two-story barn on the farm in the early 1880s. Herman Kamna (1870–1924) from Bassen, in what was then the Province of Hanover, in Germany (now Lower Saxony) immigrated to Washington County with his family in 1886. He married Anna Rehse on February 14, 1900, and the couple purchased from the Mannings in June 1903. The Mannings retained a life estate to a small portion of the farm that included the farmhouse, and remained on the farm until after Louis' death in 1910 and Elizabeth's in 1916. The Kamnas then moved into the farmhouse. The Kamnas had four children, though one died in an accident at the farm at age three. One son, Edgar, in time took over the farming on the farm. About 1910 the Kamna family built an addition to the barn, and around 1920 built a second addition to the barn. They continued adding buildings to the farm in the early 1900s including a woodshed, privy, pumphouse, chicken coop, smokehouse, potato shed, and a canning shed. The last addition was a garage in the 1920s. In the 1920s the family added indoor plumbing to the farmhouse, and in the process enclosed parts of two porches. The Kamnas grew oats, fescue, rye grass, vetch, and sub-clover on the farm and used the barn for sorting and packing the seeds, running the farm into the 1950s. As of 2007 the farm was owned by Wayne Reed and Petrina Pometto. On October 10, 2007, the Manning–Kamna Farm was added to the National Register of Historic Places. Farmhouse The farmhouse in 2009 Located along northwest Evergreen Road at Jackson School Road, the Manning-Kamna farm sits across the street from the city of Hillsboro. The largest and oldest building on the farm is the residence. Built as early as 1876 and as late as 1883, the house stands 1.5 stories tall and is of a late Victorian style in a cruciform shape. The cross-wing Western Farmhouse designed structure has a gabled roof (double Gabled-Ells) with four hip-roofed porches, one on each corner. The home is a wood framed building that had a concrete foundation added in 2006. Materials include mainly Douglas-fir for the wood, and a composite shingle roof. Details on the home include double hung windows, two chimneys, seven doors, and a catwalk that attaches to the neighboring woodshed. Architectural features include a corbelled chimney, crown moulding window casings, and on the porch are triangle shaped decorative wood brackets that are on top of the turned porch columns at the eaves. Inside, the main floor includes the kitchen, laundry room, a bathroom, the dining room, a parlor, foyer, a mud room, a fireplace room that features a Rumford fireplace. The second floor has a bathroom, a sewing room, and three bedrooms. Out buildings The farm has nine other buildings organized in a rectangular pattern, with the home in the middle, the barn to the west, and the privy on the eastern boundary. The original two-story barn is the oldest and largest of these remaining buildings. Built of hand hewn timber posts, it measures by and has white shiplap siding. The two newer barn buildings and the older portion form one interconnected building. These newer parts are one story tall, with the middle one measuring by and the northernmost by . White board and batten siding was used on the middle portion that was built around 1910 and tongue and groove siding on the end section added about 1920. The barns were used for the seed growing operation of the farm. Attached to the residence is the woodshed, or chop house, that stands one story tall and has a gabled roof. Built in the early 1900s by the Kamna family, it was remodeled in the 1970s and turned into a finished space complete with half-bath. The chicken coop was built about 1920 with an unfinished interior, and also has a gabled roof. The by structure has a dirt floor and shiplap siding. The potato shed also features the shiplap siding and gabled roof. Measuring by , the concrete floored structure was built circa 1910 and was used for storing crops. The smallest structure is the privy, which is by . It was used from about 1910 until the 1950s. Inside were three holes, while outside was shiplap siding and a cedar shake roof. The pumphouse featured a brick foundation and brick lined well. Built about 1910, it is a wood frame structure with a hip roof of composition shingles. The well was used for irrigation on the farm. Also built around the same time was the smokehouse which had a dirt floor. Measuring by , it has white shiplap siding and a cedar shake roof on the exterior. The canning shed on the property is the only brick structure. Built in the late 19th century, it was used for canning, food storage, and summer kitchen. Measuring squared (1.3 m2), it also has a hipped roof which features a wooden ventilation chimney at the apex. The exterior of the brick is covered with stucco. The newest building on the farm is the garage that was built in the 1920s. It has a gabled roof, exposed rafter tails, weatherboard siding, and composition singles. Located between the farmhouse and the barn, it measures by and has a wide double-car garage door on the south side. There is a single window on both the east and west ends of the building. A large Pignut Hickory and Black Walnut trees shade the garage.

It is a component in a variety of theories relating to stress, mental health, coping, and emotion. It is most notably used in the transactional model of stress and coping, introduced in a 1984 publication by Richard Lazarus and Susan Folkman. In this theory, cognitive appraisal is defined as the way in which an individual responds to and interprets stressors in life. A variety of mental disorders have been observed as having abnormal patterns of cognitive appraisal in those affected by the disorder. Other work has detailed how personality can influence the way in which individuals cognitively appraise a situation.  Conceptualizations and theories  Visual representation of Lazarus' transactional model of stress. = Lazarus' transactional model of stress = This model uses cognitive appraisal as a way to explain responses to stressful events. According to this theory, two distinct forms of cognitive appraisal must occur in order for an individual to feel stress in response to an event; Lazarus called these stages \\"primary appraisal\\" and \\"secondary appraisal\\". During primary appraisal, an event is interpreted as dangerous to the individual or threatening to their personal goals. During secondary appraisal, the individual evaluates their ability or resources to be able to cope with a specific situation . = Scherer's component process model = The component process model proposed by Klaus Scherer utilizes cognitive appraisal to explain an individual’s psychological and physiological response to situations. Scherer’s model makes additions to the Lazarus’ transactional model regarding how many appraisals occur. Rather than just two levels of appraisal in response to an event (primary and secondary), Scherer’s model suggests four distinct appraisals occur: (a) the direct effects or relevance that an individual perceives an event being to them (b) the consequences an event has both immediately and long-term to an individual and their goals (c) the ability an individual perceives they can cope with the consequences of an event (d) the ways in which the events are perceived to result from an individual’s values and self-concept. This model and additional work by Scherer notably highlights not only psychological responses, but many physiological responses according to how events are appraised by an individual. = Roseman's appraisal theory of emotions = Ira Roseman utilized the concept of cognitive appraisal to build an explanatory theory that encompasses a wider range of emotions (when compared with Lazarus' transactional model). According to Roseman (1996), positive emotions result from events that an individual appraises as consistent with their motives, while negative emotions result from events that individuals appraise as inconsistent with their motives. More specific emotions are based on if the event is perceived to be as caused by others, the individual, or due to an uncontrollable circumstance.  Practical applications  The way in which stress is cognitively appraised has been found to influence mental health. Cognitive styles of perceiving the world and interpreting events have been suggested as factors that may make certain individuals more prone to depression, such as Aaron Beck's cognitive theory (1967). A variety of studies have linked panic disorder with attentional biases and catastrophic perceptions of events.

Club career  After playing for the London City Mission, Gnome Athletic and Park Avondale, Lane joined Tottenham Hotspur in 1922 for the first time but left the club without appearing in a senior match. He went on to play for Summerstown and Barnet before re-joining Tottenham after a spell with the club's \\"nursery\\" team Northfleet United.Kent's nursery clubs Retrieved 7 May 2009 Lane, a centre forward, went on to feature in 36 matches and found the net on 12 occasions between 1924 and 1926. Lane's time with Spurs came to an end after manager Peter McWilliam dropped him after Lane kicked the ball into the crowd after having a goal disallowed in a match versus Preston North End. Lane had been courting the attention of the England selectors at the time, who were present at the match, but unimpressed with his behaviour. The incident ended Lane's chances of an international call-up and his Tottenham career. After leaving White Hart Lane, Lane appeared for Leicester City (joining for £2250), Reading and Brentford, where he scored 89 goals in 123 appearances. As of 2015, his record of seven league hat-tricks is second behind club record- holder Jack Holliday and his 33-goal haul in the 1929–30 season was a club record until Holliday broke it in 1932–33. Despite his excellent form for the Bees, Lane was transfer-listed by manager Harry Curtis, who needed the money from Lane's sale to fund the transfer of Middlesbrough players Jack Holliday, Bert Watson and Billy Scott. Lane signed for Watford in a £1500 deal in 1932 and the following year scored a hat-trick in the Football League in under three minutes against Clapton Orient on 20 December 1933, then a record. He featured in a total of 136 matches for Watford in all competitions, scoring 77 goals and went on to have spells at Bristol City, Clapton Orient and finally Gravesend United.  Managerial and coaching career  In 1945, Lane turned down the manager's job at Clapton Orient to return to Brentford as a coach under Harry Curtis. He remained with the Bees before going into management with Guildford City. He later moved on to manage Brighton & Hove Albion and Gravesend & Northfleet. He managed Brighton & Hove Albion to its first ever Football League title, as 1957–58 Third Division South champions. After leaving Gravesend & Northfleet, Lane became a scout for Arsenal and later returned to Brighton & Hove Albion in a similar role. He was still working for Albion at the time of his death in 1985.  Personal life  Lane served as a PT instructor during the Second World War.

Bradley is the only coach to have trained multiple winners of the four best known & most prestigious professional footraces in the world: the New Year Sprint (Scotland) 5 winners, the Stawell Gift (Australia) 2, the Bay Sheffield (Aust) 3 & the Burnie Gift (Aust) 2. Early life Jim Stott (he changed his surname to Bradley when he registered as a professional athlete), was born in Edinburgh, Scotland on 17 May 1921. The second youngest of five children, Bradley's father deserted the family, leaving Jim's mother Maggie to raise five children in a single room tenement in Broughton Street. To ease the burden, Bradley's two elder siblings were farmed out to relatives and friends. His mother worked part-time as house-keeper to provide enough money for the family to survive. Bradley left school at fourteen to work with the London and North Eastern Railway (LNER), where he worked as a junior checker, keeping a record of the number of wagons and their weight in coal. He supplemented his income by carting bottles of tea from local cafes to the workers in the rail yards. At 17 Bradley lost his railways job to a senior checker and without the prospect of another job lined up, he joined the army in February 1939. He was placed in the Royal Army Services Corp and soon found himself serving in the Middle East where he served four years, sustaining a few war injuries but fortunately nothing life-threatening. He later served in France and Belgium and finally in East Berlin where he remained until the end of the war in 1945. Becoming an athlete After returning to the UK in 1946, at the age of 24 Bradley took up athletics, immediately giving up cigarettes and undertaking a vigorous training regime. He joined the Southern Harriers in Edinburgh, training on the track at Meadowbank Stadium. After training alone for some months, a dairy farmer who lived opposite the training track suggested he should seek out a coach and soon Bradley was running under the guidance of athletics coach George McCrae. In 1947 McCrae persuaded Bradley to run professionally, where he had his first run in the Powderhall sprint, winning his heat and attracting the attention of bookmaker William Murphy who offered to sponsor Bradley for a preparation at the famous New year sprint. In 1951, Bradley became a training partner for Eric Cumming, the champion Australian professional athlete who was on a 10-week preparation for the Powderhall sprint. Cumming was beaten in the semi-final and was ready to return to Australia before Bradley convinced him to stay in Scotland and have another go at Powderhall in 1952. Cumming was indebted to Bradley's advice as he became the first and still the only Australian athlete to win the famous race in 1952 off the tight handicap of two yards on a track covered in snow.  Becoming a coach  By 1951 Bradley was training under new coach Jim Muir, another successful Scottish coach and after training under McCrae and Muir, Bradley began thinking of his arm action and ways he could improve it to enhance his running. Bradley's curiosity with the upper body's role in sprinting led him to research various upper body training methods and he commenced experimenting with the speedball. After a few years using himself as a guinea pig for his training methodology and enjoying some success, in 1957 he began coaching his first athlete – Ricky Dunbar. As Dunbar was only running 100 yards in 11.4 secs, Jim figured that using Dunbar as model for his speedball ideology would not harm Dunbar's athletic ability and if anything, should help him. Bradly applied different speedball applications before deciding that six three-minute rounds with a one-minute rest produced the best results. He complimented the speedball with body weight exercises and trained every day, keeping detailed records of the training effects. By 1958 Bradley had added another 6 athletes to his squad and adopted the name – Albany Athletic Club. After running several fund raising efforts including dance nights, the Albany Athletic Club had its own clubrooms and gym equipment. Training at Saughton Enclosure's cinder track, Jim needed to regularly sprinkle salt on the track to prevent it from freezing over. Whilst Jim enjoyed moderate success in his early years, by the early 1960s his squad became a regular force on the Border Games circuit in Scotland & Northern England. His 'school' of athletes were noted for wearing red silk vests and shorts. In 1962, Ricky Dunbar ran 2nd in the 120 yards Powderhall Sprint off a mark of 6 yards, before returning in 1963 to win the race off a handicap of 4½ yards. Dunbar went on to become the British professional sprint champion as did his stablemate Dave Walker. In 1969, Bradley added George McNeil to his stable and had instant success with McNeil winning the 1970 Powderhall Sprint before running 2nd off scratch in 1971. Under Bradley, McNeil broke the world professional 120-yard record on the way to winning the British professional sprint title. Between 1962 and 1971, Bradley coached eleven Powderhall Sprint finalists including five winners - *1963 Rick Dunbar *1965 Tom Dickson *1969 David Deas *1970 George McNeil *1971 Wilson Young Wilson Young later became a successful coach, employing the training methods he learned from Bradley. Young briefly coached Allan Wells who used the Jim Bradley speedball method on his way to winning a 100m gold medal at the 1980 Moscow Olympics. 1972 – move to Australia In 1972, Bradley left his management job in Thomson & Brown Brothers Tyre Depot in Edinburgh and emigrated to Australia where he became a fitness coach for the Essendon Football Club, an Australian Rules football team playing in the Victorian Football League. In 1974, Bradley had his jaw broken in the infamous battle of Windy Hill, Essendon brawl that erupted at half time of the Essendon v Richmond game. At the end of the 1974 season, at the coaxing of North Melbourne Football Club captain Barry Davis, Bradley became fitness coach for the Kangaroos and played an integral part in the club's first premiership in 1975. He soon left North Melbourne and undertook some freelance coaching, whilst building his sporting goods business. In May 1988, at the age of 67, Bradley got the athlete coaching bug back and commenced coaching his own squad on the Victorian Athletic League circuit. In his first season on the professional running circuit, he enjoyed his first Australian success with Paul Young winning the Brunswick Gift over 120 metres in December 1988. His squad quickly grew and within 3 years he was virtually unstoppable with his charges winning several major Gifts with multiple finalists in many of the events. On New Year's Day 1990, Jim Bradley scored the unprecedented feat of having first and second in the feature Gifts at two of Australia's most prestigious 120-metre Gifts when Dave Clarke beat Paul Dinan at Maryborough (Victoria) and Sam Kirsopp beat Simon Smith at Burnie (Tasmania). In another astonishing first, in January 1990 at the popular Rye Gift carnival, Bradley trained athletes – Simon Smith, Steve Tilburn, David Clarke and Sam Kirsopp filled the first four places in the 120m Gift final. In a stellar 1989/90 season, Bradley's athletes also won the Broadford, Wangaratta, Melton, Bendigo and Werribee Gifts, as well as several other sprint races on the VAL circuit. Consequently Bradley was named VAL and ACC (national) coach of the year. In 1991, Bradley became only the second coach in Stawell Gift history to train the quinella (1st and 2nd) when Steve Brimacombe defeated his stablemate Paul Young in the 120m classic. It also gave him another record that is never likely to be broken – and that is coaching 1st and 2nd in both a Stawell Gift and the New Year Sprint. Brimacombe became Bradley's first Bay Sheffield (SA) winner in 1991, a race Bradley won again in 1993 with Ryan Witnish and 2000 with Craig Brown. Brimacombe also became Bradley's first Australian national champion, when in March 1994, he won a memorable and titanic 200m battle against 1993 world championship finalists, Dean Capobianco and Damien Marsh. Brimacombe later was a finalist in the 1994 Commonwealth Games, becoming Bradley's best ever Australian athlete. In 1995, Bradley became embroiled in one of the most controversial incidents in Stawell Gift history, when his athlete Glen Crawford was sensationally disqualified after running the fastest heat on Easter Saturday. After two inquiries, Crawford was reinstated and on Easter Monday went on to become the most emphatic winner in Stawell history, winning in an incredible 11.78 secs on a rain affected track. Crawford was later heavily fined by the VAL for a failure to disclose performances, before it was rescinded after Bradley threatened legal action to clear Crawford's name. In December 1995, a Deed of settlement between Crawford and the VAL was signed, effectively clearing Crawford of any wrongdoing. After a few quiet years in the late 1990s, in 2000/2001, Bradley had a mini resurgence when Craig Brown won the Bay Sheffield and Burnie Gifts and Adam Burbridge was 2nd in the Stawell Gift. Jim Bradley continued to coach junior athletes into his 90s. His last success was Sam Jamieson who won the prestigious Don Furness sprint over 70m. Jamieson left Bradley in 2007 and won the 2008 Stawell Gift under his new coach. After a short illness, Bradley died aged 94, on July 2, 2015. Apart from speedball and bodyweight exercises, Bradley espoused a diet of steak & chips, with plenty of vegetables & fruit. Jim Bradley wrote a book about his life in athletics, published in 2004: Athletics My Way.

It is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade I listed building. New aisles were added in 1499. The Perpendicular octagonal tower, which is in three stages, dates from around 1455, but the top section was rebuilt in 1833. It has a number of interesting gargoyles known locally as 'hunky punks'. The portcullis in the stonework above the battlements is from the coat of arms of Margaret Beaufort, Countess of Richmond and Derby who was Lord of the Manor of Eastover in the Parish of Langport. Two of the hunky punks are believed to represent Margaret Beaufort and her son Henry VII of England. The East window of the chancel contains a set of late 15th century glass depicting various saints, appropriate to the dedication \\"All Saints\\". Although restored in the 19th century, it remains one of the best preserved medieval windows in Somerset. Additionally, it is unusual in that the window contains a full set of glass from the same period. The church is no longer used for services, meaning its congregation has been merged with nearby St Mary's. It is now a redundant church in the care of the Churches Conservation Trust. The church was declared redundant on 1 July 1994, and was vested in the Trust on 28 June 1995. The Trust has carried out extensive rebuilding work. In 2011, the Churches Conservation Trust and the community of Langport started an innovative regeneration project at All Saints church. Now the Regeneration Task-force at the Churches Conservation Trust is working in partnership with a group of local young people aged 16–25 to regenerate All Saints church with a new use. The group of young people is called the 'New Saints'.

A. in 1564. About 1573 he entered into holy orders, and was made a prebendary of Winchester (1581) and rector of Easton. In 1588, while maintaining his position at Winchester, Barlow began an association with Lichfield as prebend of Colwich, which in the following year was transferred to the 'golden prebend' of Sawley with which came the position of treasurer of Lichfield Cathedral. He afterwards became a chaplain to Henry Frederick, Prince of Wales, son of James I, and finally archdeacon of Salisbury (1615).

Barlow's work was on practical aspects of magnetism: improvements in the hanging of compasses at sea, for the discovery of the difference between iron and steel for magnetic purposes, and for the proper way of touching magnetic needles, and of piercing and cementing lodestones. He corresponded with William Gilbert. A controversy arose between Barlow and Mark Ridley, who published a reply to Barlow's Magnetical Advertisements, charging him with plagiarism, not only of Gilbert's work De Magnete (1600), but of his own book, Magnetical Bodies and Motions (1613). Barlow made a stinging reply. The work had in fact its origins in a manuscript he had prepared in 1609 for Sir Thomas Chaloner; Chaloner may have found him the position as chaplain to Prince Henry.http://www.shpltd.co.uk/pumfrey-dawbard.pdf, p. 156 and p. 171.

His 2005 book The High Cost of Free Parking identifies the negative repercussions of off-street parking requirements and relies heavily on 'Georgist' insights about optimal land use and rent distribution. In 2015, the American Planning Association awarded Shoup the \\"National Planning Excellence Award for a Planning Pioneer.\\" Early life and career Shoup was born in Long Beach, California, in 1938. When he was two years old, his family moved to Hawaii for his father's work in the U.S. Navy. He arrived in New Haven, Connecticut, in the late 1950s at the peak of New Haven Mayor Richard C. Lee's efforts to build major parking garages and improve city traffic flow with the Oak Street Connector and other urban renewal projects. He received his undergraduate degrees from Yale College in electrical engineering and economics, and his doctorate in economics from Yale in 1968. After completing his PhD he headed west, assuming a post as research economist at UCLA's Institute for Government and Public Affairs. After a four-year stint as a professor at the University of Michigan, Shoup returned to UCLA as an Associate Professor of Urban Planning in 1974, and later was awarded a full professorship in 1980.  Parking  Originally focused on public finance and land value tax theory, in 1975 Shoup was inspired by a master's thesis that found that Los Angeles County employees were almost twice as likely to drive alone than federal employees in the Los Angeles Civic Center due to the availability of free parking. Shoup has extensively studied parking as a key link between transportation and land use, with important consequences for cities, the economy, and the environment. In a 2004 paper titled The Ideal Source of Local Public Revenue, Shoup argued for the application of Georgist tax theory to urban parking and transportation issues.Shoup, Donald C. \\"The Ideal Source of Local Public Revenue.\\" Regional Science and Urban Economics 34.6 (2004): 753-84. Shoup popularized the theory that an 85% occupancy rate of on-street parking spaces would be the most efficient use of public parking. When cars at any given destination in a city (a block or group of blocks) occupy more than 85% of on-street parking spaces, then cars arriving at that destination are forced to circle the block for a few minutes in order to find an unoccupied parking space. This small search time per car creates a surprisingly large amount of traffic congestion because, typically, many cars are searching for parking simultaneously during peak driving times. This wastes time and fuel and increases air pollution. Shoup calls this phenomenon of excess driving resulting from under-priced parking \\"cruising for parking\\". His research on employer-paid parking led to the passage of California’s parking cash-out law, and to changes in the Internal Revenue Code to encourage parking cash out. His research on municipal parking policies has led cities to charge fair market prices for curb parking and to dedicate the resulting meter revenue to finance added public services in the metered districts. Shoup's attempts to turn theory into practice have, on occasion, led to controversy. Shoup is a Fellow of the American Institute of Certified Planners, and has served as Director of the Institute of Transportation Studies and as Chair of the Department of Urban Planning at UCLA. He has served as a visiting scholar at the University of Hawaii, Cambridge University, and the World Bank Bibliography =Books= * Shoup, Donald and Ruth P. Mack.

Van Lagen driving the Lada Priora The team returned to the WTCC to run Lada 110s in 2008, with Dutch driver Jaap van Lagen joining Shapovalov with driving duties. Kirill Ladygin joined the team in a third car for the final four rounds. For 2009, the team attracted support from Lada, with the Russian company thus becoming the fourth manufacturer in the championship alongside SEAT, BMW and Chevrolet. The introduction of the new Priora at Porto and the addition of former British Touring Car Champion James Thompson to the driver lineup helped the team to increase their competitiveness during the season. Drivers points were achieved by Thompson for a pair of 6th places at the Imola round, which were also the first for either a Russian Bears driver or a Lada driver in the series. In order to make room for Thompson, Shapovalov had stepped down from driving duties to concentrate on team management. For 2011, the team participated in the new European Production Series (EP Series) with Kirill Ladygin and Vyacheslav Maleev driving two SEAT Leons and in the Lada Granta Cup driving two Lada Grantas Sport.

The History of the Colour Conundrum Early life Keeley was born in Bristol, the son of a local clergyman. Performance Work Inspired by the work of French chemist and colour theorist Eugene Chevreul, Keeley was a regular performer at the London Royal Polytechnic in the 1860s, which was chaired by distinguished scientist and aeronautical engineer Sir George Cayley.WEEDEN, B (2008) The Education of the Eye: History of the Royal Polytechnic Institution 1838-1881. Granta Keeley became famous for an innovative form of magic lantern display in which abstract colour slides replaced the normal representational and narrative forms. By employing geometric and repetitive patterns his projections had the effect of producing afterimages in the eyes of his audiences (it may be that Keeley was familiar with studies of the afterimage made earlier in the century by Goethe and by Czech scientist Jan Purkinje).CRARY, J (1990) Techniques of the Observer pp. 102-104. MIT Press Keeley's lantern shows were highly innovative for their time, but they did not prove popular to a Victorian audience and in the early 1870s he spent several months in America, where he produced lighting effects for the Metropolitan Opera House in New York City.

Shortly after Mayor Torcuato de Alvear widened and extended what was then known as the Camino Bella Vista during the 1880s, Hume had a Tudor Revival mansion designed by architect Carlos Ryder built in 1890. Built over a bluff, the lot behind the house remained unimproved until the City Parks Commissioner, noted urbanist Charles Thays, was hired by the family to landscape and Piveau Gratias the property, in 1913.Clarín: Historia de una mansión The property was sold to the Duhau family during the 1920s. The Duhaus - prominent landowners - commissioned architect León Dourge for the design of a new residence adjacent to the old Hume house. Inspired in the Château du Marais (in Le Val-Saint-Germain, near Paris), the resulting Neoclassical palace and its guesthouse were completed in 1932. The Duhau siblings eventually relocated to the Hume house, however, and the last of these died in 1976. The palace itself remained empty until, in 2002, local developer Juan Scalesciani purchased the property and secured a partnership with the Hyatt Hotels Group. The Chicago-based hotelier planned a Park Hyatt to replace the Retiro-area highrise sold to the Four Seasons Hotels in 2002. Following a US$74 million investment and numerous delays over privacy concerns regarding the neighboring Vatican nunciature, the Palacio Duhau - Park Hyatt Buenos Aires was opened on July 12, 2006.

It was a Progress M1 11F615A55 spacecraft, with the serial number 253. Launch and first docking Progress M1-4 was launched by a Soyuz-U carrier rocket from Site 1/5 at the Baikonur Cosmodrome. Launch occurred at 01:32:36 UTC on 16 November 2000. The spacecraft docked with the Nadir port of the Zarya module at 03:47:42 UTC on 18 November. The Kurs docking system failed during docking, and the manual backup, TORU, was used for the docking. Progress M1-4 remained docked for two weeks before undocking at 16:22:52 UTC on 1 December. Second docking Following its undocking, Progress M1-4 spent 25 days in free flight, prior to redocking with the same port on 26 December at 11:03:13 UTC. Like the original docking, the TORU system was used, as although the fault with the Kurs system had been resolved, the procedure used to abort the original Kurs docking attempt was irreversible due to the retraction of an antenna that could not be redeployed. It remained docked for 44 days before undocking again at 11:26:04 UTC on 8 February 2001. It was deorbited at 12:59 UTC on the same day. The spacecraft burned up in the atmosphere over the Pacific Ocean, with any remaining debris landing in the ocean at around 13:50 GMT.

Demographics As of the year 2000, the racial makeup of Barnum is 20.73% White non-Hispanic, 0.61% African American, 0.83% Native American, 0.64% Asian, and 75.78% Hispanic or Latino.http://www.piton.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=CommunityFacts.Summary&Neighborhood;_ID=863 Boundaries The neighborhood's northern boundary is the Sixth Avenue Freeway, its eastern boundary is Federal Boulevard, its southern Boundary is Alameda Avenue, and its western boundary is Perry Street. History In 1865, Daniel Witter bought 160 acres southwest of Denver, the first in a series of land deals in the development and promotion of Villa Park. Envisioned as a vast development with unique features such as curving streets, Witter's dream of a home for Denver's wealthy was never realized. The Denver Villa Park Association raised money for development, but lawsuits followed and the association was soon bankrupt. Lands were placed with a trustee, and on March 11, 1878, offered for sale. Less than two weeks later, on March 21, 1878, the American circus mogul P.T. Barnum of the Barnum and Bailey Circus bought 760 acre for just $11,000, and a few years later, the Barnum subdivision was platted. Barnum's involvement with his namesake's development has become part of Denver folklore, especially in the durable legend of the showman's plan to establish a winter home for his circus in the city. In fact, Barnum never wintered his animals anywhere other than Connecticut or Florida, and the entertainment entrepreneur made just four documented trips to Colorado. Barnum sold as much of Barnum as possible before disposing of the remainder to his daughter, Helen Buchtel, for the price of one dollar. Ironically, much of Barnum's initial development was a result of efforts by Helen, and her second husband, William Buchtel, who also served as mayor of an independent, incorporated Barnum established in 1887.https://history.denverlibrary.org/barnum-neighborhood-history See also * Villa Park, Denver References Category:Neighborhoods in Denver ","title":"Barnum, Denver"},{"id":"23129890","title":"China National Highway 323"},{"id":"23129906","text":"Kurt Hirschhorn (born May 18, 1926 in Vienna)http://www.whonamedit.com/doctor.cfm/3356.html is an Austrian-born American pediatrician, medical geneticist, and cytogeneticist who identified the chromosomal defects that underlie Wolf-Hirschhorn syndrome.

Its last assignment was with Aerospace Defense Command (ADC)'s Goose Air Defense Sector at Thule Air Base, Greenland, where it was discontinued in 1965. The wing was organized in 1960 and assigned a fighter interceptor squadron and a squadron operating a radar for ground controlled interception. The 4683d also acted as the host organization at Thule until October, when support units were transferred to the 4683d Air Base Group, which was attached to the wing, but assigned to the 64th Air Division in Newfoundland. It supported the Ballistic Missile Early Warning System when the system was activated at Thule, but was discontinued when that mission supplanted the wing's traditional air defense mission. History The 4683d Air Defense Wing was established in 1960 when Air Defense Command (ADC) assumed host responsibility for Thule Air Base from Strategic Air Command. Its operational mission was to act at the command and control echelon, controlling both a radar and a fighter squadron in Greenland to provide forward air defense of northeast North America. Through the attached 4683rd Air Base Group, the wing also acted as the United States Air Force host organization for Thule. The wing also provided support for an Army Nike Missile air defense unit. The 931st Aircraft Control and Warning Squadron, already at Thule, was reassigned to the wing from the 64th Air Division immediately upon organization of the wing.Cornett & Johnson, p. 105 The 931st was located on Pingarssuit Mountain (Site N-32), 20 miles south of the main base.

The campaign followed directly from the Trafalgar campaign of the year before, in which the French Mediterranean fleet had crossed the Atlantic, returned to Europe and joined with the Spanish fleet. On 21 October 1805, this combined force was destroyed by a British fleet under Lord Nelson at the Battle of Trafalgar, although the campaign did not end until the Battle of Cape Ortegal on 4 November 1805. Believing that the French Navy would not be capable of organised resistance at sea during the winter, the First Lord of the Admiralty Lord Barham withdrew the British blockade squadrons to harbour. Barham had miscalculated – the French Atlantic fleet, based at Brest, had not been involved in the Trafalgar campaign and was therefore at full strength. Taking advantage of the reduction in the British forces off the port, Napoleon ordered two heavy squadrons to sea, under instructions to raid British trade routes while avoiding contact with equivalent Royal Navy forces. Departing from Brest on 13 December 1805, it was 12 days before the Admiralty in London were aware of the French movements, by which time the French squadrons were deep in the Atlantic, one under Vice- Admiral Corentin-Urbain Leissègues intending to cruise in the Caribbean and the other, under Contre-Admiral Jean-Baptiste Willaumez, sailing for the South Atlantic. Two British squadrons were hastily mustered and dispatched in pursuit, one under the command of Rear-Admiral Sir Richard Strachan and the other under Rear-Admiral Sir John Borlase Warren. These squadrons were joined by a third under Rear-Admiral Sir John Thomas Duckworth, who had deserted his station off Cadiz when he learned news of a French squadron to his south and subsequently crossed the Atlantic in pursuit of Willaumez. Although Willaumez managed to escape into the South Atlantic, Leissègues was less successful and was discovered and destroyed at the Battle of San Domingo in February 1806 by a combined force under Duckworth and Rear-Admiral Alexander Cochrane. Other squadrons already at sea became embroiled in the campaign: a smaller squadron that had been raiding the African coast under Commodore Jean-Marthe-Adrien L'Hermite since August 1805 provided a diversion to the major campaign but failed to draw off significant British forces, while the remnants of a French squadron under Contre-Admiral Charles-Alexandre Durand Linois that had been operating in the Indian Ocean since 1803 was intercepted and defeated by Warren in March, after a chance encounter on its journey back to France. Willaumez achieved minor success in his operations in the South Atlantic and Caribbean, but was caught in a summer hurricane on his return journey and his ships were scattered along the Eastern Seaboard of North America. One was intercepted and destroyed by British forces and others were so badly damaged in the storm that they were forced to shelter in American ports. The survivors gradually returned to Brest during the autumn, the last arriving in early 1807. The campaign was the last significant operation in the Atlantic for the remainder of the war, and no French squadron of any size left any of the Biscay ports until 1808. The losses suffered by the Brest fleet weakened it so severely that it would not participate in a major operation until 1809, when an attempt to break out of Brest ended in defeat at the Battle of Basque Roads. Background =Trafalgar= On 30 March 1805, the French Mediterranean Fleet under Vice-Admiral Pierre-Charles Villeneuve successfully broke out of Toulon harbour, avoiding the British blockade fleet under Vice- Admiral Lord Nelson and sailing westwards out of the Mediterranean and into the Atlantic, Nelson following several days behind.The Campaign of Trafalgar, Gardiner, p. 122 Villeneuve, joined by a Spanish squadron, crossed the ocean to the Caribbean and anchored at Martinique, while Nelson arrived at Barbados on 11 June. Panicked by the British arrival, Villeneuve immediately returned to Europe, with Nelson again close behind. Villeneuve's orders had specified that he sail to Brest, the French naval port on the Bay of Biscay, and join there with the fleet under Vice-Admiral Honoré Ganteaume. Together this force would drive the Royal Navy out of the English Channel in preparation for an invasion of Britain.The Campaign of Trafalgar, Gardiner, p. 130 However, as he passed the Spanish port of Ferrol on 22 July 1805, Villeneuve was intercepted by a British fleet under Vice-Admiral Sir Robert Calder. At the ensuing Battle of Cape Finisterre, Calder captured two Spanish ships but failed to inflict a decisive blow on Villeneuve's squadron, which later sailed to Cadiz, Spain's principal Atlantic seaport. Nelson arrived shortly afterwards and initiated a blockade of the port.The Campaign of Trafalgar, Gardiner, p. 137 On 21 October 1805, Villeneuve's combined Franco-Spanish fleet sailed from Cadiz and was intercepted by Nelson, resulting in the Battle of Trafalgar. Although Nelson was killed at the height of the battle, his squadron inflicted a devastating defeat on the combined fleet, capturing or destroying 17 French or Spanish ships, including Villeneuve's flagship. The battered remnants of the French Mediterranean and Spanish Atlantic fleets retreated to Cadiz, although four French ships fled north and were intercepted and captured at the Battle of Cape Ortegal two weeks later.The Campaign of Trafalgar, Gardiner, p. 173 In total, the campaign cost Napoleon 13 French and 12 Spanish ships, eliminating any possibility of even regional superiority at sea and therefore preventing the planned invasion of Britain, which had already been indefinitely postponed. The elimination of the French and Spanish fleets and the end of the threat of French invasion was widely celebrated in Britain, and seen by First Lord of the Admiralty Lord Barham, as an opportunity to reduce costs and damage to his ships by withdrawing the Atlantic blockade to Britain during the winter under the assumption that the battered French Navy would be unable and unwilling to operate at sea during the period.Adkins, p. 172 He wrote: \\"It is of little purpose now, to wear out our ships in a fruitless blockade during the winter.\\"The Victory of Seapower, Gardiner, p. 17 =French plans= Allemand's squadron in pursuit of the Calcutta convoy, 25 September 1805, Thomas Whitcombe Barham had seriously miscalculated the strength of the Brest fleet, which had been uninvolved in the campaign of 1805 and was therefore at full strength. He also underestimated Napoleon, who had observed that Villeneuve's brief stay in the Caribbean had acted as a major threat to British trade, delaying convoys and causing panic among the West Indian merchants.Rose, p. 35 The French naval authorities were also inspired by the effect of a raiding squadron under Contre-Admiral Zacharie Allemand, which had escaped from Rochefort on 17 July 1805, caused significant disruption to British trade in the Atlantic and remained at sea off the North African coast.Rodger, p. 545 Seeking to repeat these effects, Napoleon sent orders to the commander at Brest, Vice Admiral Honoré Ganteaume, in November 1805 for two strong squadrons to be prepared for service in the Atlantic. These were to leave Brest under cover of darkness on 13 December, with orders to strike deep into the Atlantic and intercept any merchant convoys that they encountered. Subsequently, the squadrons were to separate, one to the South Atlantic and the other to the Caribbean, there to cause as much disruption to British intercontinental trade as possible. The orders encouraged the admirals not to engage any Royal Navy force of equivalent size or larger and thus avoid the risk of being captured or destroyed.The Victory of Seapower, Gardiner, p. 20 Ganteaume selected 11 ships of the line for the operation, including the 120-gun first rate Impérial, flagship of Vice Admiral Corentin-Urbain Leissègues, who was to sail to the Caribbean with four other ships of the line, two frigates and a corvette. His squadron carried over 1,000 French soldiers to augment the garrison on Santo Domingo under General Jean-Louis Ferrand, and was then required to spend two months blockading Jamaica before cruising along the American Eastern Seaboard to Newfoundland, returning to France when food supplies ran low.Woodman, p. 215 The other squadron was given to Contre-Admiral Jean-Baptiste Willaumez in Foudroyant, with orders to cruise the shipping lanes of the South Atlantic before sailing to the Leeward Islands, communicating with the French colonies of Martinique, Guadeloupe and Cayenne and blockading Barbados. When British opposition became too strong, he was to return to the South Atlantic off Saint Helena, also returning to France once food supplies ran low.Clowes, p. 184 His squadron consisted of six ships of the line, two frigates and two brigs, and included among its captains Jérôme Bonaparte, the Emperor's younger brother. Although both squadrons carried six months provisions, they were expected to capture more during their voyages and it was intended that their raiding operations should last as long as 14 months, causing severe indirect damage to the British economy by restricting the movement of trade.James, Vol. 4, p. 185 December 1805 On 13 December 1805, with the majority of the British blockade squadron anchored in Cawsand Bay and the remainder driven far offshore by a winter gale, the French squadrons sailed from Brest into the Bay of Biscay unnoticed. Within two days they had passed nearly into the Atlantic Ocean and had encountered a British merchant convoy, Willaumez detaching in pursuit. The convoy was sailing to Britain from Gibraltar, escorted by the 64-gun under Captain Robert Redmill and the frigate under Captain William Prowse. Heavily outnumbered, the convoy turned away and ran before the wind, Willaumez in close pursuit. Later in the day a second convoy appeared to the north, of 23 ships sailing from Cork to the Caribbean escorted by the frigates under Captain Charles Brisbane, under Captain John Maitland and the brig . With Willaumez distracted, Leissègues ordered his squadron in pursuit.Woodman, p. 216 Willaumez's ships captured a number of stragglers from Redmill's convoy and managed to isolate Sirius, which only just escaped after narrowly avoiding an unequal encounter with four French ships of the line. With the convoy dispersed, Willaumez gathered his scattered forces and despatched the frigate Volontaire to the Spanish island of Tenerife with the prizes, before turning the remainder of his squadron southwards for his designated cruising grounds. To the north, Leissègues gradually approached Brisbane's convoy during the night but did not close with him until the morning of 16 December.Clowes, p. 186 In response, Brisbane formed his three warships into a line of battle, accompanied by three of the larger merchant ships. This force could not hope to resist Leissègues' main force, but would enable the 17 other vessels to escape by blocking the French squadron's frigates from chasing them.James, Vol. 4, p. 186 Ignoring the escaping convoy, Leissègues formed his own line of battle and continued to close with Brisbane, whose faster ships steadily pulled away from the French throughout the day. As darkness fell, Leissègues abandoned the pursuit and turned to the south and Brisbane immediately despatched Boadicea to Brest and Wasp to the blockade squadrons along the Atlantic Seaboard with urgent warnings of the French operations in the Eastern Atlantic. Brisbane himself remained in distant contact with Leissègues for another day before the French squadron sheered away. Brisbane continued southwards with the remainder of his convoy, seeking the British blockade squadron at Cadiz. =Duckworth's cruise= On 20 November 1805, the French squadron under Contre-Admiral Allemand encountered a British convoy off the Savage Islands. Allemand's squadron was on its return journey to France when he encountered the convoy, consisting of six merchant ships sailing from Britain to Gorée under the escort of the brig under Commander Frederick Langford. Langford gave orders for his convoy to scatter as the French approached, Lark turning northwards in search of Rear-Admiral Sir John Thomas Duckworth and the Cadiz squadron, reaching it on 26 November. Duckworth immediately sailed in pursuit of Allemand, leaving behind only two frigates to watch Cadiz in his absence.James, Vol. 4, p. 187 Sailing south from Cadiz, Duckworth's squadron reached Madeira on 5 December, passing Tenerife ten days later without sighting any French ships. Continuing south to the Cape Verde Islands, Duckworth reluctantly conceded that the French squadron had escaped and he retired northwards until he encountered Brisbane's reduced convoy on 23 December. Tracking the presumed course of Leissègues' ships, Duckworth continued northwards on a course that would intercept the French squadron. At 06:45 on 25 December, at , approximately northwest of the Canary Islands, lookouts in Duckworth's squadron spotted nine sails in the distance. As Allemand's squadron was estimated to have approximately nine ships, Duckworth initially believed that his enemy was Allemand, possibly accompanied by prizes captured on his cruise. However, as he closed with the French, it became clear that this was a different squadron altogether.Clowes, p. 187 In fact his target was Willaumez, and despite the French admiral's efforts, Duckworth was steadily gaining on him, the ships of the line , and outstripping the rest of the British squadron.The Victory of Seapower, Gardiner, p. 21 By 13:00 on 26 December, the flagship Superb was just behind the rearmost French ship, with Spencer further back and Agamemnon another distant. The rest of the squadron was more than behind the leaders, almost completely out of sight, with the rearmost ship, , more than behind Superb.James, Vol. 4, p. 188 The more compact French squadron was therefore at an advantage. The British were too dispersed to be able to bring a powerful enough force to engage the French in equal battle and the distance between the individual British ships was too great to allow them to provide mutual support if Willaumez turned to face them. Therefore, to the fury of his officers, Duckworth called off the pursuit. This decision was heavily criticised, both at the time and subsequently: historian William James commenting that \\"had the Superb brought to action, as in the course of a few hours she might, the sternmost French ship . . . the issue, in all reasonable calculation, would have been favourable to the British\\".James, Vol. 4, p. 189 Gathering his scattered squadron, Duckworth despatched the frigate to Britain with the news of the French activity in the Eastern Atlantic, his message suggesting that the French were probably destined for the Dutch East Indies. He himself turned southwest towards the Leeward Islands, where he could resupply his ships in preparation for resuming the blockade at Cadiz. On 2 January 1806 he ordered under Captain Robert Plampin to sail for the Indian Ocean and reinforce the British squadron there, in case Willaumez's squadron reached Asian waters. =British response= Word of the French break-out did not reach Britain until 24 December, when a cartel arrived from Gibraltar with the news. The report understated the size of the French forces, claiming seven rather than eleven ships of the line had broken out, with four frigates. Recognising his error in withdrawing the blockade, Barham immediately ordered two squadrons to prepare for sea: one under Vice-Admiral Sir John Borlase Warren gathered at Spithead, including the second rate and six other ships of the line. The other formed in Cawsand Bay under Rear-Admiral Sir Richard Strachan and consisted of the second rate and five other ships of the line. Both were ordered to cruise the mid-Atlantic in search of the missing French squadrons, Warren in the vicinity of Madeira and subsequently the West Indies, eventually joining with the squadrons there under Rear-Admiral Alexander Cochrane and Vice-Admiral James Richard Dacres. Strachan was to pass Saint Helena and cruise the West African coast to the Cape of Good Hope, guarding the vital trade route in the Eastern Atlantic that connected Britain with India. If he was unable to discover the French he was instructed to attach his squadron to that under Commodore Home Riggs Popham that had been sent to invade the Dutch base at the Cape of Good Hope in the autumn of 1805.Clowes, p. 185 Battle of San Domingo On 12 January 1806, Duckworth's squadron anchored in Carlisle Bay, Barbados, sending to St. Kitts for additional water supplies. On 19 January the whole squadron sailed to Basseterre at St. Kitts, where they anchored and took on fresh food and water.James, Vol. 4, p. 190 On 21 January two ships of the West Indian squadron joined them: under Captain John Morrison and under Captain Samuel Pym. Northumberland was the flagship of Rear-Admiral Alexander Cochrane, who met with Duckworth but had no new information about French movements in the region.Clowes, p. 188 In fact, Leissègues had arrived in the Caribbean on 20 January, his passage delayed since departing from Brisbane's convoy in December and his ships damaged and dispersed by a series of winter storms off the Azores. Disembarking the troops at Santo Domingo, the French admiral made repairs to his ships, awaited the arrival of the missing Alexandre and Brave, and took on supplies over the next two weeks in preparation for raiding operations in the West Indies.Clowes, p. 189 On 1 February, the British sloop arrived at St. Kitts with news that three French ships of the line had been spotted off Santo Domingo. Duckworth immediately weighted anchor and sailed for the port, passing St. Thomas on 3 February and through the Mona Passage the following day. On 5 February, the frigate under Captain Adam Mackenzie joined the squadron, accompanied by a captured Danish schooner that had recently departed Santo Domingo and whose crew were able to give a precise account of the French squadron at anchor in the harbour. Before the Danish ship had left port, a number of French officers had been concerned that the schooner might reveal details of their presence to the British and had demanded that Leissègues seize and burn the vessel, but the admiral had refused. The Battle of San Domingo, 6 February 1806, with H.M.S. Canopus Joining the Action, Thomas Lyde Hornbrook In the early morning of 6 February 1806, Duckworth's scouting frigates sighted Leissègues' squadron off the port of Santo Domingo. French lookouts reported the British squadron to the admiral, who ordered his ships to sail in a line of battle westwards along the coast, in the direction of Nizao. Duckworth closed with Leissègues' leading ships in his flagship Superb, followed by Cochrane in Northumberland and Spencer. The rest of the ships formed a second division led by Rear-Admiral Thomas Louis in , which rapidly fell behind the leading division.James, Vol. 4, p. 191 At 10:10, Duckworth opened fire on Alexandre, while Northumberland and Spencer engaged the next two French ships in line, Leissègues' flagship Impérial and Diomède. Within 15 minutes, Alexandre had fallen out of the line, dragging Spencer with her to the south, while Northumberland had suffered severe damage from Impérial's heavy gun batteries.James, Vol. 4, p. 192 At 10:35, Louis' squadron arrived, each ship raking Alexandre as they passed and leaving her dismasted and shattered. Canopus then passed on towards the melee surrounding Impérial while targeted Brave and attacked Jupiter, both of which rapidly surrendered, followed shortly afterwards by Alexandre.Clowes, p. 191 With the French rear defeated, the remaining British ships focused their attack on Impérial and Diomède, but the intense smoke blocked the British view and caused Atlas to collide with Canopus, while fire from Impérial disabled Northumberland. At 11:30, surrounded by enemies and with escape impossible, Leissègues' decided to drive his remaining ships on shore rather than surrender. Steering for the beach and closely pursued by Canopus, both Impérial and Diomède were deliberately grounded.James, Vol. 4, p. 193 With the enemy line destroyed, Duckworth anchored offshore to observe French activity on the grounded ships and conduct hasty repairs. Out of range of British fire, small boats evacuated most of the remaining sailors from Impérial and Diomède, which had lost all their masts and were rapidly filling with water. When Duckworth sent in his frigates on 8 February it was clear that both ships were beyond repair, the British boarding parties removing the remaining 156 crew as prisoners and setting fire to the hulls.James, Vol. 4, p. 198 British casualties in the engagement had been 74 killed and 264 wounded, while the French total was estimated at 1,510, although accurate counts were not taken in the aftermath of the battle. With his enemy defeated, Duckworth detached Northumberland and to Barbados and took the rest of the squadron to Jamaica with the prizes. There he was acclaimed, and his victory was also celebrated in Britain when the news reached Europe in the brig .James, Vol. 4, p. 199 Awards were distributed among the officers of the squadron but Duckworth was overlooked: his abandonment of Cadiz and the failure to bring Willaumez to battle in December had earned the enmity of Lord Collingwood, commander in chief of the Mediterranean Fleet, who blocked any awards to his subordinate. Historians William James and William Laird Clowes have both suggested that if Duckworth had not been victorious at San Domingo then he would probably have faced a court martial.James, Vol. 4, p. 200Clowes, p. 193 Willaumez's cruise =South Atlantic= After outrunning Duckworth on 26 December, Willaumez sailed for the South Atlantic, intending to pass into the Indian Ocean and cruise off the Cape of Good Hope in anticipation of the arrival of the British China Fleet.James, Vol. 4, p. 203 The China Fleet was a large annual convoy of East Indiamen that originated in Canton and passed through the Malacca Straits, across the Indian Ocean, around the Cape of Good Hope and then north through the Atlantic Ocean, arriving in British waters six to eight months after departure. During the passage, the convoy gathered ships from the various British colonies in the Indian Ocean and by the time it passed the southern tip of Africa it often contained dozens of vessels.James, Vol. 4, p. 248 By combining the heavy armaments of the East Indiamen with a strong Royal Navy escort, the China Fleet became a formidable target for French raiding squadrons: at the Battle of Pulo Aura in February 1804, an unescorted China Fleet drove off a powerful French squadron under Contre-Admiral Charles- Alexandre Durand Linois after a sharp encounter.Woodman, p. 195 Willaumez had planned to resupply his squadron at the Cape itself before searching for the China Fleet, but the crew of a merchant ship captured in the South Atlantic informed him that the Dutch governors had surrendered on 10 January 1806 to an expeditionary force under General Sir David Baird and Commodore Popham after five days of fighting. Turning away from the Cape, Willaumez decided to continue operations in the South Atlantic until April, when he put into Salvador in Brazil for supplies. Willaumez was fortunate to have collected this information before attempting to anchor in Table Bay: Popham had ordered all ships and shore facilities to continue to fly the Dutch flag in the hope that enemy ships would be lured within range of the port's gun batteries.James, Vol. 4, p. 274 On 4 March this ruse worked successfully when the frigate Volontaire, detached from Willaumez's squadron in December, anchored in the midst of Popham's squadron without realising their identity. Hopelessly outnumbered, Captain Bretel had no choice but to surrender, the British boarding party discovering 217 British soldiers in the hold, captured by Willaumez from Redmill's convoy.Adkins, p. 189 =Destruction of Linois= The London Man of War capturing the Marengo Admiral Linois, 13 March 1806, Contemporary engraving by \\"W. C I\\" While Willaumez operated in the South Atlantic, the British squadrons under Strachan and Warren hunted for him hundreds of miles to the north. Warren's squadron cruised the eastern Atlantic, monitoring the trade routes than ran along the coast of West Africa while Strachan focused on the western Atlantic, particularly the southern approaches to the Caribbean. Although neither was in a position to intercept Willaumez until he began the return journey north, Warren's position afforded him the opportunity to watch for any French or allied vessels returning to Europe from the East. At 03:00 on 16 March 1806, lookouts on reported sails to the northeast and Captain Sir Harry Burrard-Neale ordered his ship in pursuit. Although no other ships in the squadron could see anything, Warren gave the order to follow London in case the sails proved to be French. The distant ships were in fact the remains of Linois's squadron, which had put to sea on 13 March 1803 and operated in the Indian Ocean ever since. There Linois conducted a string of commerce raids that achieved minimal success, hampered by both the lack of naval stores at Île de France and Linois's hesitation in the face of the enemy. The squadron had missed opportunities at Pulo Aura and the Battle of Vizagapatam in 1804 and against a conovy escorted by Sir Thomas Troubridge in 1805.Rodger, p. 547 Much reduced by detachments and shipwreck, Linois's squadron now consisted only of his ship of the line Marengo and the frigate Belle Poule. At 03:00 on 13 March, lookouts on Marengo sighted sails to the southwest and despite his officers' misgivings Linois ordered Marengo to investigate, in the hope that he had discovered another merchant convoy.Clowes, p. 373 At 05:30, London and Marengo almost collided in the darkness, Linois recognising the strange ship as a Royal Navy second rate and desperately turning away in an effort to escape. Marengo was too slow and Neale opened fire, rapidly inflicting serious damage to the French flagship. Captain Bruilhac on Belle Poule assisted his admiral for as long as possible, but at 06:15 swung away with British frigate pursuing closely. The fighting continued for another four and a half hours, Linois defending his ship against mounting odds as the rest of Warren's squadron came into range. To the northeast, Amazon succeeded in catching Belle Poule, the British frigate inflicting serious damage on the French ship as she closed. Unable to escape or continue the fight, both Linois and Bruilhac surrendered at 11:00, although by that time the French admiral had been severely wounded and taken below.Adkins, p. 191 French losses were 69 killed and 106 wounded to British casualties of 13 killed and 27 wounded.Clowes, p. 374 Following the engagement Warren returned to Britain with his prizes, leaving the eastern half of the Atlantic temporarily unguarded.Victory of Seapower, Gardiner, p. 29 Willaumez in the Caribbean At the beginning of April 1806, Strachan was the only British admiral still hunting for Willaumez's squadron, following the withdrawal of Duckworth and Warren. Strachan's squadron was hampered in its movements by the presence of the 98-gun , which was much too slow to operate effectively with Strachan's fast response force. Returning to Britain in early April to resupply, Strachan detached St George and (the new flagship of the Rochefort blockade) at Plymouth and was joined by three additional ships of the line and two frigates, all fast ships capable of extended operations.James, Vol. 4, p. 210 In early May, news reached Britain of Willaumez's stay at Salvador and his subsequent departure in mid-April, and Strachan was again ordered in pursuit, sailing for the West Indies.Clowes, p. 196 On leaving Brazil, Willaumez first steered for the French colony of Cayenne, where he divided his ships into three squadrons to increase his raiding operations throughout the West Indies. In May he briefly considered an attack on Carlisle Bay, Barbados, but withdrew claiming that the wind and tide were against him. Cochrane, whose squadron was based at Carlisle Bay, came out in pursuit of the French and almost captured Jérôme Bonaparte in Vétéran with his flagship Northumberland, forcing the French ship to withdraw to Fort-de- France on Martinique on 9 June. Cochrane blockaded the port and was joined by under Captain George Dundas and under Captain John Harvey, but Northumberland was damaged by a storm and the British temporarily withdrew to Saint Lucia, allowing Éole and Impétueux to reach Fort-de-France on 15 June. Over the following week the rest of Willaumez's squadron joined Vétéran, ignoring Cochrane's efforts to intercept his ships as they entered the harbour. On 1 July Willaumez left Fort-de-France with two ships and sailed to Montserrat, seizing three merchant ships in the harbour. The British governor on Montserrat sent urgent messages to Nevis and St. Kitts, where the authorities hastily evacuated a 65-ship convoy anchored at Sandy Point under the meagre protection of the 28-gun frigate .James, Vol. 4, p. 204 However, 13 ships from other harbours missed the warning and on 3 July four ships that had detached from Willaumez's squadron the day before descended on the islands, seizing four vessels on Nevis and attacking the remaining nine that had gathered under Brimstone Hill. There gunfire from the Brimstone Hill batteries drove off the attacking French ships. On 4 July Willaumez rejoined the squadron from Montserrat with news that the annual Jamaica convoy, a large collection of merchant ships that sailed each year from the Caribbean to Britain during the summer, was anchored off Tortola. Cochrane had already recognised the danger to the Jamaica squadron and had overtaken Willaumez while he was at Montserrat, waiting for the French squadron off St. Thomas with four ships of the line and four frigates. On 6 July Willaumez sighted Cochrane south-east of St. Thomas and, heeding his orders from Napoleon not to risk battle, turned away and passed between St. Thomas and the Passage Islands. With the French driven off, Cochrane sailed to Tortola where nearly 300 ships had gathered to prepare the convoy for the journey to Europe.Clowes, p. 194 Frustrated in his efforts to intercept the convoy at anchor, Willaumez determined to meet it at sea, sailing to the Bahama Banks. There he waited for the convoy, seizing any ships that came within sight of his squadron, including neutral vessels, in case they revealed his position.James, Vol. 4, p. 205 For several weeks Willaumez's lookouts saw nothing, the British holding the convoy back until they obtained some information about the location of the French squadron.James, Vol. 4, p. 206 During the night of 31 July, bored with waiting for the convoy, Captain Jérôme Bonaparte sailed northwards away from the squadron, acting without orders or even notifying his admiral. When dawn broke on 1 August, Willaumez was panicked by the disappearance of Vétéran and, assuming that the ship had somehow been accidentally separated, began to search for the missing vessel and its important commander. While Willaumez was distracted by his missing ship, Cochrane had finished preparing the convoy. Unable to delay its departure any longer, he sent 109 large merchant ships eastwards under the protection of one small ship of the line, two frigates and two sloops, a significantly inferior force to the one under Willaumez. The convoy passed across Willaumez's cruising ground during August while the French admiral was to the north searching for Vétéran, and by the time he returned the convoy was far to the east, was well on its journey to Britain. Willaumez's absence also meant that he missed a potential encounter with Admiral Warren, who had returned to the Atlantic in search of Willaumez following his victory over Linois in March. Warren had sailed from Spithead on 4 June and by 12 July had anchored at Barbados. During August he searched for Willaumez in the eastern Bahamas but failed to discover the French squadron, which at that time was still searching for Vétéran far to the north. Hurricane With his squadron unexpectedly depleted, his principal target escaped and food supplies running low, Willaumez decided to begin the final stage of his cruise and sail for Newfoundland, thereby escaping pursuit from Cochrane and Warren and preying on the convoys and fishing fleets that crossed the area.Adkins, p. 192 Turning northwards on 18 August, Willaumez was at , north-east of Puerto Rico, when his squadron was struck by a fierce hurricane. When the storm abated, Willaumez found that his flagship Foudroyant was badly damaged and entirely alone. Rigging jury masts, Foudroyant began slowly limping for the Spanish port of Havana on Cuba, where she could make the repairs needed for the journey back to France. For nearly a month Willaumez encountered nothing, but on 15 September, with Havana in sight, the heavy British frigate under Captain Charles Lydiard appeared.James, Vol. 4, p. 208 Willaumez sent a boat into Havana for assistance as the frigate approached and at 13:15 Lydiard opened fire. Although Foudroyant was far larger than Anson she was significantly damaged and incapable of rapid manoeuvres, which gave Lydiard some hope of capturing her. However the fire of Willaumez's flagship proved too strong and at 13:45 Anson sheered away with two men killed and eight wounded. Spanish ships, including the ship of the line San Lorenzo came out to assist Foudroyant and within a few hours she was safely anchored in the heavily fortified harbour.James, Vol. 4, p. 209 The rest of Willaumez's squadron was less successful in their attempts to reach safety. All were badly damaged and most had been blown north-west towards the Eastern Seaboard of the United States. There they encountered Strachan's squadron, which had passed through the Bahamas while Willaumez searched for Vétéran and been from Willaumez when they were caught in the same hurricane that had dispersed the French squadron. Less damaged than their opponents, Strachan's ships began gathering off Chesapeake Bay with the intention of continuing their search once temporary repairs had been completed. On 14 September the ships of the line under Captain William Hargood, under Captain John Erskine Douglas and the frigate under Captain Stephen Poyntz were cruising off Cape Henry in search of Strachan's flagship when they spotted a ship sailing under jury masts to the southwest. Closing to investigate, they discovered that the stranger was the French ship Impétueux, left in a dismasted and leaking state by the hurricane and desperately attempting to reach a harbour in the United States. Commodore Alain-Joseph Le Veyer-Belair immediately steered Impétueux towards the coast to avoid the unequal combat and drove his ship on shore at 08:15. Although Impétueux was now on United States soil, Melampus opened fire, the attack followed at 10:00 by boats from Belleisle and Bellona.Woodman, p. 218 Boarding parties seized Impétueux but the appearance of two sails on the horizon, later discovered to be British, convinced Hargood to abandon the wreck to Melampus. By 20:00 the remaining French crew had been taken aboard the frigate as prisoners and Poyntz gave orders for the wreck to be burnt.Adkins, p. 193 The destruction of Impétueux on United States territory prompted complaints from the French consul at Norfolk, Virginia and from the captains of Éole and Patriote, which had sheltered in Annapolis following the storm.James, Vol. 4, p. 211 Badly damaged by the high winds, repairs on Patriote took over a year, Commodore Joseph-Hyacinthe-Isidore Khrom waiting until 16 December 1807 to make the journey back to France. He arrived at Ile d'Aix on 17 January 1808, narrowly avoiding the blockade squadron under Strachan that was temporarily out of position to take on fresh supplies.James, Vol. 5, p. 3 Éole was never repaired: the difficulty in obtaining the required naval stores proved too great and she was broken up at Annapolis in 1811. Another ship that never returned to France was the frigate Valeureuse, which sheltered in the Delaware River following the hurricane but was later forced to sail up river to Philadelphia to avoid attacks by British raiding parties. As with Éole, repairs proved too complex and Valeureuse was also broken up some years later. The flagship Foudroyant did succeed in returning to France, sailing from Havana late in 1806 and arriving at Brest in February 1807. Vétéran entering Concarneau, Michel Bouquet Of the original squadron only two ships returned to France immediately: Vétéran had separated before the storm and Captain Bonaparte, assisted by a specially selected veteran crew, managed to intercept a convoy travelling from Quebec to Britain escorted only by the 22-gun under Captain Robert Howe Bromley on 10 August. Although Bromley made a desperate attempt to draw off the French ship of the line, Vétéran ignored the small escort ship and seized six merchant vessels, setting them on fire.Clowes, p. 195 Champion and the transport Osborne escaped, accompanied by nine other merchant ships. On 26 August 26 days after he deserted Willaumez's squadron, Bonaparte was nearing the French coast when he was chased by the 80-gun under Captain Willoughby Lake and the frigates and under Captains William Robert Broughton and Thomas Baker. Closely pursued, the reliable officers placed under Bonaparte abandoned the intended destination of Lorient and instead used their expert local knowledge to direct Vétéran to the tiny port of Concarneau, the first time a ship of the line had ever successfully anchored in the harbour.James, Vol. 4, p. 207 Although another captain might have been court martialed for abandoning his admiral without orders or permission, the Emperor's brother was instead praised for intercepting the Quebec convoy and promoted soon afterwards. The other surviving ship of Willaumez's squadron was Cassard, which passed through the hurricane relatively intact and made its way to Europe alone, arriving at Rochefort several weeks later. Minor operations In addition to the squadrons of Willaumez, Leissègues and Linois, the French authorities sent several other forces into the Atlantic during the campaign; either separate operations intended to pass unnoticed under the cover of the major campaign or deliberate diversionary expeditions to draw British forces away from the main theatre of operations. The first of these was L'Hermite's expedition, an expedition to West Africa under Commodore Jean- Marthe-Adrien L'Hermite that had sailed from Lorient towards the end of the Trafalgar campaign with orders to attack undefended merchant shipping off West Africa and await reinforcements under Jérôme Bonaparte.James, Vol. 4, p. 264 Before Bonaparte could sail, the Battle of Trafalgar changed the strategic situation and the reinforcements were never despatched. L'Hermite conducted an effective but minor raiding operation of his own, cruising off West Africa and capturing a number of merchant ships and slave ships, eventually sailing for Cayenne and then back to France in September 1806.James, Vol. 4, p. 265 A second force was less planned and more opportunistic: Lamellerie's expedition was drawn from frigates that had survived the Battle of Trafalgar and were sheltering in Cadiz. Duckworth withdrew from the blockade of Cadiz in November 1805, and inadequate replacements were provided by Collingwood. In February 1806, a British plan to lure the French squadron out of port by withdrawing all of the available forces except the frigate and a brig backfired when a storm blew Hydra out of position on 26 February 1806 and La Meillerie escaped with four frigates and a brig.Clowes, p. 197 Hydra gave chase, and La Meillerie abandoned the slower brig to avoid combat with the British frigate, eventually escaping with his remaining ships. La Meillerie's expedition then visited Senegal and Cayenne, failing to make any impact on British merchant shipping despite orders to commerce raid when possible. After four months, La Meillerie decided to return to France, reaching the Bay of Biscay on in July 1806.Woodman, p. 225 As well as the squadrons under Warren and Strachan, the British authorities had deployed additional forces in response to the French operations, in particular with the intention of intercepting and capturing Willaumez during his return journey to France. To this end, Rear-Admiral Louis was given a squadron to patrol in the English Channel and Admiral William Cornwallis maintained a powerful force off Brest, which was so successful in cutting off the seaport that L'Hermite's Régulus was the only ship of the line to enter or leave the port during 1806. Other squadrons were stationed off the remaining French Biscay ports, including a force of five ships of the line under Commodore Richard Goodwin Keats off Rochefort. One of Keats' ships, under Captain Robert Dudley Oliver was able to intercept La Meillerie's squadron on his return journey and capture the frigate Rhin on 17 July.Woodman, p. 226 In September, Keats was replaced off Rochefort by Commodore Sir Samuel Hood, who achieved a significant success when he intercepted a French squadron of seven frigates and corvettes under Commodore Eleonore-Jean-Nicolas Soleil sailing from Rochefort to the French West Indies with supplies and reinforcements at the Action of 25 September 1806.Clowes, p. 390 Hood, commanding six ships of the line, sighted Soleil's force at 01:00 on 25 September, within hours of it leaving Rochefort. Giving chase, conditions suited Hood's larger ships and by 04:00 Soleil recognised that he would be caught by the advancing British and detached three ships southwards and one to the north, retaining three others to delay the approaching British squadron, which had become separated during the pursuit.Woodman, p. 227 Engaging the lead ship, under Captain Richard Lee, Soleil ordered his frigates to target her rigging in the hope of slowing Monarch's advance and escaping. Monarch was damaged in the battle, but remained in contact with the French long enough that Hood's flagship HMS Centaur and later HMS Mars could come up and join the engagement. In all four of the French frigates were captured, including the vessel sent north, which was caught by Mars. British casualties were nine killed and 29 wounded, the latter including Hood, who lost an arm. L'Hermite's force had been caught in the same hurricane that had dispersed Willaumez, and as a result his ships were scattered and damaged on 20 August, one frigate joining the remains of Willaumez's squadron in the United States and the others limping back to France. Most succeeded in slipping through the British blockade independently, including Régulus, which arrived at Brest on 5 October, but one ship was less successful: on 27 September 1806 the frigate Président became the final French casualty of the campaign when it was trapped in the Bay of Biscay by Louis' squadron. Closed in from all sides, the approach of Louis' flagship Canopus convinced Captain Labrosse that continued resistance was impossible and he struck his colours without a fight.Clowes, p. 391 Aftermath Although Allemand led a minor expedition from Brest to Toulon in 1808, and the Brest fleet under Willaumez made a determined if ineffectual effort to break into the Atlantic in early 1809 which ended at the Battle of Basque Roads, there were no other large scale naval campaigns fought in the Atlantic Ocean during the Napoleonic Wars.The Victory of Seapower, Gardiner, p. 19 Minor operations by individual French ships and small squadrons continued, but the losses of 1805 and 1806, combined with the barring of Spanish ports after the Dos de Mayo Uprising and the seizure of much of the French West Indies in 1809, reduced both the need and the ability of the French to operate on a large scale in the Atlantic: Lord Barham recognised this when he commented on hearing the news of the victory at San Domingo that it \\" puts us out off all fear from another predatory war in the West Indies\\".The Victory of Seapower, Gardiner, p. 24 In Britain the campaign emphasised the important lesson previously demonstrated in the Trafalgar campaign of the year before, that it was immensely difficult in the vastness of the Atlantic Ocean to detect and intercept French squadrons at sea: only off their own harbours and in the confined waters of the Caribbean were they vulnerable to detection and attack by British squadrons. The inadequate size and power of convoy escorts and the expense in resources employed in chasing French squadrons at sea meant that British trade was placed at risk by the depredations of independent French squadrons, and the maintenance of a tight blockade was essential.The Victory of Seapower, Gardiner, p. 18 The British grip on French maritime travel was a constant source of irritation to Napoleon, who instigated a massive shipbuilding program with the intention of breaking the blockade: by 1808 he was able to muster over 80 ships of the line against the British blockade squadrons.

The area is part of Magajin Gari Ward in the southern part of Sokoto North local government area of Sokoto state, bordered Gidan Haki in the east, Digyar Agyare in the west, Mafara in the north and Helele in the south.  Etymology According to oral sources Makera Assada was formerly known as Makerar Dutsi. The word Makera is a Hausa name for smithery. The area is known for its blacksmithing, which happened to be the main occupation of the area, the area thus became known as Makera. On the other hand, the reason why the area is associated with Dutsen Assada, is that in the neighboring area, at the southern part is the place popularly known as Dutsin Assada which extended up to the river of Dundaye. This area is a hilly area with small and flat rocks. There were people who were said to have settled in the place, although the region is not suitable for agriculture people happened to settle there. At that early time, around the 1880s after the formation of Sokoto, Assada was said to be one of the most important personalities who settled near the Dutsi, and he consistently stopped children from climbing it. Consequently, people started calling the place Dutsin Assada.Umar Hamza Tsoho; Growth and history of the establishment of Makera Assada in Sokoto metropolis to the year 2007. Assada was very popular in the area; very kind and friendly, he was said to be among the close friends of the sultan and even used to receive sultan visitors in his residence. His house was like gidan baki or guest house. The reason why Assada is added as a suffix to Makera is to differentiate it from other areas known for blacksmithing. The other places where smithing occurred included: Kofar-Rini the area that specialized in white metal smithing producing earrings and necklaces. There is also Makera in Nupawa that produces hoes and other farming tools. But in Makera Assada all types of smithing take place. This explains why Assada is the home of Sarkin Makeran Sarkin Musulmi, or the chief smith of the sultan of Sokoto.  Origin of the people of Makera Assada  The origin of the people of Makera Assada is not clear. No one knows the exact date of settlement. But it is assured that the people settled after the Jihad of Shehu Usmanu Danfodiyo in the nineteenth century, when Sokoto was founded. The coming of immigrants played an important role in the history and the growth of the area. These immigrants include the blacksmiths from Zamfara who were also Fulani under the leadership of Muhammad Andi and his brother Ahmad Maigeme.Oral interview with Malam Bello Da\`agi. Imam and Islamic scholar Makera Assada The time Shehu Usmanu Danfodiyo started his teaching and preaching in his home town Degel, and after some time he went out on preaching tours. His first tour was to Kebbi from where he gained his first converts. The Uthman and his assistants, including his younger brother Abdullahi ibn Fodiyo, made for Zamfara where they remained and preached for five years. His preaching influenced many people from different parts of west Africa. Very soon interested people who were influenced by his preaching continued to form part of the Jama\`at, as his followers were known. The people included both the Fulani, his race, and Hausa since Shehu Usmanu preached both in Hausa and Fulfulde languages. Many more people form his fold, and the community grew still further in fame both in and out of Hausaland.Boyi. U;Tanzinul waraqatHausa translation of Abdullahi's work, Muhammad Andi and his brother Ahmad Maigeme, together with their people left Zamfara in order to join Shehu who had migrated to Gudu and possibly the Jihad that was going on. Mallam Bello stated that “when the Muhammad Andi and his people left Zamfara they met Shehu Usmanu Danfodiyo when the Jihad was going on and even participated in the Great Battle of Alkalawa.Malam Bello According to oral sources Muhammad Andi and his people were Fulanis from Zamfara. Their chief occupation was blacksmithing. These people were ill-treated before they left their home Zamfara, because of their belief in Shehu's preaching. The Hausa rulers feared that their subjects would revolt against them. Seeing this, the Hausa rulers were alarmed. They saw the growing number of his following and the hold that Islam had gained. Men urged them on saying “if you do not disperse this concourse of people, your power will be gone; they will destroy your country by causing all the people to leave you and go to them.”Cited in It is important to note that, when Sarki Nafata was the King of Gobir, he forbade any man from holding religious meetings and preaching to the people, excepting only Shehu. Secondly, he decreed that Islam might only be practiced by those who inherited the creed from their fathers, and he also prohibited the wearing of turbans by men and veils by women. These edicts were proclaimed in every marketplace in Gobir and the neighboring parts of Adar and Zamfara which were under Gobir domination. With these we can see that the jama\`at of Shehu Usmanu and other followers in different places most especially in Hausaland shared the same fate. Consequently, the people of Muhammad Andi who were in Zamfara had no choice but to migrate and follow Shehu wherever he was. On their migration the Hausa rulers tried to stop them from following Shehu. In order to escape from their threats, the people of Andi complained to them, that they were only blacksmiths, on their way for business activities. As each opened their luggage, it was discovered that it contained blacksmiths tools, and therefore allowed them to pass. These people were welcomed by the Shehu and his Jama\`at, especially because of their profession. This people remained with the Jama\`at of Shehu Usmanu Danfodiyo and participated in the Jihad of Hausaland. The people of Muhammad Andi continued with their profession there by producing war tools and weapons for the Jihadists. During the war time they produced swords, spears, arrows, handmade guns, helmets, shields and other materials worn by horses. After the Jihad of Hausaland following the creation of the Sokoto caliphate by Shehu Usmanu and his son also War Commander Muhammad Bello, they came together with their followers, scholars, friends, relatives and other participants of the Jihad. These people were given a portion of land to settle with their people. Muhammad Andi was therefore one of the beneficiaries, being the first to settle at present Makera Assada. Shehu ordered Muhammad Andi to go round and look for a convenient place for him to stay, and when he found the area (Makera Assada) he informed Shehu Usmanu dan Fodiyo, Shehu therefore blessed the land. According to oral sources Shehu wanted Muhammad Andi to stay near Hubbare but Andi complained that by nature of their blacksmith occupation and also a kind of animal husbandry, it was better for them to settle far away from the centre of the town.ibid. After some years another important personality arrived at the newly established Makera with the members of his family. This person is popularly known as Sharif Muhammad Al-gudana. He was with some other people. Algudana and his people were Adarawas. Adarawa are found in Tamaske, Buza and Adar region in Tawa, Niger Republic. They are also found in Illela in Sokoto. As a result of the Jihad of Shehu dan Fodiyo in the 19th century, the Sarkin Adar Mustaphata and his son Muhammad Dan Almustapha and also Ahmad Bida visited Shehu Danfodiyo when he was in Gudu, but Mustapha left Ahmad Bida and Muhammad with Shehu. Hamidun, who succeeded to the throne of Sarkin Adar during the Jihad of Danfodiyo sided with Gobirawa until 1809, when Sarkin Azbin Muhammad Gemma, who succeeded Al-Bakri, took Sarkin Adar Hamidun with him to Shehu at Sifawa and Sarkin Adar made his submission. He died soon after that. Ahmad Bida was said to have stayed at Dundaye as the Sarkin Adar of Dundaye. Thus was born the dynasty of Adarawa at Dundaye. Ibid We can see from the above account that during the Jihad, Adarawa participated in it and after, some of them stayed at Dundaye and spread in different parts of Sokoto in search of business activities. But some of them returned to Niger Republic under Muhammad dan Al- Mustapha, who prepared to remain in Adar with the hope of regaining to his throne. When these people settled in the area, they practiced leather work. They produced all kinds of leather materials like shoes, leather bags, royal pillows, etc., but these people did not became popular in leather work as most of them adopted the occupation of their host, blacksmithing.  Occupations  As many people continued to stay in the area, the major economic activity of the people had been blacksmithing, which was dominant in the area, the people having been engaged in various types of gainful employment. The people of the area engaged in all forms of smithing and other iron work. Both blacksmithing and white smithing is practiced in the area. Blacksmithing has been practiced since the establishment of the region after the jihad of Shehu Usmanu. The people of the region used to regard blacksmithing as a compulsory occupation of every member of the area. They regard those who abandoned their grandfather's occupation as committing a serious offence. The act of smithing provides income for the people of the area, as the blacksmith produces house utensils, farming tools, weapons, etc. On the other hand, those who specialized in smithing of the white iron or Makeran fari, produces decorations for women, thereby producing necklaces, earrings, handrings, etc. The white smiths are very few in the area thus blacksmithing or Makeran Baki are regarded as their masters. Apart from smithing, the Hausa people were noted for their active participation in commercial activities. Some people in the region engaged in internal trade (Kasuwanci). This was especially the case with merchants with small scale capital. They sold the goods produce in the area in villages and towns. Farming had been the preoccupation of most African society, which was extensively done during the rainy season. In this area (Makera Assada), there are people who engage in farming, these people mostly have their farmland at the riverside along Dundaye and Kofar Kware areas, mostly farming in small scale. In other sector of the economy in the area, there are also people who engaged in the production of mats. The Major material in this manufacturing sector is wild dump palm tree and rubber. This industry was not the monopoly of either men or women. Both men and women engage in the manufacturing of mats or carpets, Wundaye and Tabarmi. However we should not forget the contribution of women of this region towards economic activities. Some of them engage in the economic sector. The role of women as commission agents (Dillalai), just like members of the more formal stock exchange market, the old women actively engaged in serving as commissioned agents (Dillalai). This was because only the older women were allowed to go out of their homes. They also used to move from house to house looking for items to sell. For instance, they used to engage in large scale trade in thread that was also manufactured at home by the women. They used to collect these home-made products either as commission agent or as through direct purchases. These women also engaged in the sale of newly produced and second hand clothes. They also sold food items both in and outside their homes. People of all age groups use to buy these items. The women fetched a lot of income to these women manufactures and sellers. The activities of commissioned agents were strengthened because of the nature and social attitudes and values in Sakkwato. Thus is against Islamic law for married women to go up and down anyhow especially in the market places. Thus the commercial agents provides most of the items needed for them. Another economic sector where women provided their contribution which is closely related to the agricultural sector, is the food and catering industry. Their services in this industry are not limited to the production of food for family consumption. They also processed and cooked different types of food for sale outside the family. Among the solid food they cooked Tuwo made of rice (Tuwon shinkafa), corn or Maize etc., Masa round cake of flour, Bula etc. The morning drink such as Kunu, Koko and the Fura which are extensively consumed during the summer season and different types of snacks, such as Kosan Rogo, Wake Awara etc. These were all prepared by women at home for family consumption as well for sale. Groundnut was widely produced in Hausaland, the women of the area use groundnuts to produce many different items for both family consumption and for sale. The shell of ground nuts for instance was ground into seed powder form to make bran (Dussa), which was used to feed cows and sheep. The groundnut kernel was press and oil extracted. This oil was used in the olden days as fuel (paraffin or kerosene) as well as for food. The solid part of the groundnut kernel was made into groundnut cake, (Kuli Kuli) and put to many uses more especially in making fast food “Datu” and as cake snacks. There are also some women of the area that specialized in producing local sauce or “Daddawa” important ingredient in making soup, local sauce has blocked the success of such modern market favourites as maggi cube, or Ajini-moto. Majority of the people especially who live in the local areas rely on local sauce. Perhaps this is why the Nigerian food and beverages company decided to come out with a new brand name for modern sauce based called Daddawa cubes. In the weaving industry, women along with the men engaged also in making of Kwaddo and Linzami. These are decorations done on the men closing. There were also some who engaged in the manufacture of multi colored caps (Kube). Among the artistic works of the women folk was the design on bedsheets (Zanen Gado) pillow cases and mattresses. Skilled women in their home did these. There were also the existence of mini-market which served the immediate needs of the people in the area. The market which is known as Kasuwar Bayangida opens in the evening time till late in the night. = Blacksmithing in Makera Assada = Makera Assada since its establishment as one of the commercial centers of Sokoto town, was known for its blacksmithing (Kira). It is sometime hard to imagine today, an age where people use their surrounding environment as the only source for survival. At the very rise of African civilization the essential tools to survival were found through the use of wood and stone tools. These tools proved to work well enough for hunting and farming, but as time changed and mankind evolved, it became necessary to find more efficient means of survival. The first known iron working exists in Turkey and the age of metals such as gold, copper, silver, lead and iron were not made workable until approximately 400 BC. This development slowed until around 1500 BC, with the development of furnaces capable of forging iron tools. The era of Iron had begun and the art of blacksmith soon spread throughout western Africa. Blacksmithing began with the Iron Age, when primitive man first began making tools from iron. The Iron Age began when some primitive person noticed that a certain type of rock yielded iron, when heated by the coals of a very hot campfire. In short, we can say that blacksmithing the art of crafting that crude metal into a usable implement, has been around for a long time. In Nigeria, the NOK people, shows the art of blacksmiths, which dates back to the sixth century BC. These Nigerian metal workers developed a technology that gave them the upper hand in life, and would prove to be a technology to revolutionise the world. Clapperton writing in 1824, spoke about iron working in Sokoto and even claimed that all the city blacksmiths were Nupes. At any rate, Nupes preponderance in the Iron working industry is probably exaggerated by Clapperton. No doubt, many skilled iron workers came to Sokoto because they were attracted by its development in terms of settlement. Other skilled iron workers no doubt came into the city as refugees (Al-kalawa), as slaves sent in from the emirates or by the demand of skilled hands in Sokoto itself. In the previous chapters we saw the coming of Muhammad Andi and his men from Zamfara marked the beginning of blacksmithing industry in Makera. Zamfara for long is noted for its blacksmithing.  Roles of the blacksmiths in Sokoto  Before the coming of Europeans, Makera Assada was one of the developed areas in Sokoto town. It has been observed that most of the development that occurred to her was a result of the heavy involvement in blacksmithing and this help the town of Sokoto in general. Smithing was the major factor that united the people of Magajin Gari ward. This was so because the manufactured goods by the blacksmith was needed within and around the area as most of them engaged in farming. The neighbouring Mafara people were mostly farmers and cattle rearers. This people of Mafara used to purchase the manufactured products of the blacksmith, like the farming tool, house utensils, keys and padlocks, earring, etc. This is to say that while the people of Makera were busy producing needed materials for people their neighbours, Mafara people are helping them exporting their products to various places. The people of Mafara are grand children of Muhammad Sambo, one of the closest friends of Shehu, all so a jihadist and a scholar. There is a kind of intermarriage between the people of Makera and Mafara strengthen their relationship. The development of in the trade, was as a result of the subsistence economy practiced in the early period of time. As Makera Assada specialized in producing iron products there was also people within and around Sokoto that engage in farming, dying capentary, hunting, etc., as such iron was needed in variety of forms. Spears, arrows, sword, knives. The farmers needed hoes, matches and ploughshares. According to Ibrahim Gandi, one of my informants, contended that hunters and farmers from distance places comes to purchase various implements from the people of Makera. Pre-colonial blacksmithing Makera society was very efficient, Sarkin Makera Buhari, stated that “Shehu Usmanu Danfodiyo, ordered his son Muhammad Bello to expand Sokoto town”. The area of Assada continues to receive more and more immigrants. The blacksmith of the area is one of the factors of their arrival. Muhammad Bello therefore ordered for the clearance of bush nearby the area up to Kofar-Kware. Most blacksmiths starts to work when they were young boys, may be age 6 or 7. They would apprentice to a blacksmith, for a decade or more, and then they will set out to start their own shop. If a boy did apprentice to a master, he might spend most of his life in shop before he ever got the opportunity to be a journey man. The people of Assada try to imbibe the knowledge of blacksmithing into every son born in the area. later when western education started taking shape in the area at first the blacksmith did not show interest. It was only those who refuse to trade in smithing, that were sent to school. These categories of boys were sent away so as not to be seen nearby as their sight would be irritating to their parents. But the blacksmiths realized the importance of western education and they put their wards, even the lazy ones. Many people enjoyed the fruits of western education in the area, as some of them became very closer to the government. The government need advice of this kind of people like famous Yahaya Danboko one of the earliest scholars of Sokoto state. However, the practice of blacksmithing in Makera Assada makes the area to be recognized as the home of blacksmithing. The area was known for its smithing since the establishment of Sokoto town. That is why during the time of Caliph Muhammad Bello, he appointed the Sarkin Makera from the blacksmiths of the area. By the arrival of the Europeans to Sokoto, whenever they need the service of the blacksmiths they use to contact the sultan. The sultan will however call the Sarkin Makera and Mazugi. The blacksmiths of Assada produces the wrought iron gates for Sokoto prison and the residence of Europeans and other places. Another important role played by the blacksmiths of Makera Assada was during the jihad of Shehu Danfodiyo. The blacksmith apart from participating in the jihad, they also produce weapons for the jihadists. It is believed that, if the government had taken these kind of local smithing serious, it would not had been spending money and importing farm implement and other iron products from abroad. Iron working made farming, hunting and war more efficient. Iron allowed for greater growth in societies with the ability to support large kingdoms, which spread across western Africa.  Process of blacksmthing in Assada  Blacksmith is a person who creates objects from iron or steel by “forging” the metal, by using tools to hammer, bend, cut and otherwise shape it in its non liquid form. Usually the metal is heated until it glows red or orange as part of the forging process. Blacksmiths produces things like wrought iron gates, grills, railings, light fixtures, furniture, sculpture, tools agricultural implements, decorative and religious items, cooking utensils and weapons. Blacksmiths work with their old clothes this is because of the nature of the work. They use to work both in their shop (Bukkar Makera), and even at entrance of their houses (Zaure) as the case of Makera Assdada. Except during this time that most of the work use to take place in the market. Blacksmiths work with black metals, typically iron. The term smith originates from the word ‘smite’ which means to heat. Thus a blacksmith is a person who works or smite black metal. Over the centuries blacksmith had taken little pride in the fact that, theirs is one of the few crafts that allows them to make tools that are used for their craft. Time and tradition had provided some fairly standard basic tools which vary only in detail around the world. All a smith needs is something to heat the metal, something to hold the hot metal with, something to hit the metal on, and something to hit the metal with. The tools which blacksmiths need to include. The forge or Tukunya which is place under the ground, forge is a fireplace of the blacksmith’s shop. It provides the means to keep and controlled with the help of Mazuzzugi. Tongs (Awartaki) are used to hold the hot metal. They came in a range of shapes and sizes. Intriguingly, while tongs are needed for a great deal of blacksmithing, much work can be done by mere holding the cold end with one’s bare hand. Steel is a fairly poor conductor of heat, and orange hot steel at one end would be cold to the touch a foot or so. The Anvil (makera) at its simplest is a large block of iron or steel. Over time this has been refined to provide a rounded horn to facilitate drawing and bending, a face for drawing and upsetting and bending and on one or more holes to hold special tools (swages or hardies) and facilitate punching. Often the Flat surface of an anvil will be hardened steel, and the body made from tougher iron. Blacksmiths hammer (amaleshi) tend to have one face and a peen. The peen is typically either a ball or a blunt wedge (cross or straight peen depending on the orientation of the wedge to the handle) and it is used when drawing. Swage (magagari) this is shaping tool, swages are either stand alone tools or fit the ‘hardie hole’ on the face of anvil. The Blacksmiths work by heating pieces of wrought iron or steel until the metal become soft enough to be shape with hand tools, such as hammer and chisel. To fuel the smelter or the forge, wood is converted to charcoal is use. The techniques of Blacksmithing may be roughly divided into forging (sometimes called “sculpting”), welding, heat treating and finishing. Forging is also referred to as sculpting because it is the process of shaping metal. Some of the operations or techniques applied in forging to include drawing, shrinking, bending, upsetting and punching. Drawing can be accomplished with a variety of tools and methods. Two typical methods using only hammer and anvil would be hammering on the anvil horn, and hammering on the anvil face using the cross peen of a hammer. Another method for drawing is to use a tool called a fuller (tsinke), or the peen of the hammer to hasten the drawing out of a thick piece of metal. The technique is called fullering from the tool. Fullering consist of hammering a series of indentations (with corresponding ridge) perpendicular to the long section of the piece being drawn. The resulting effect will be to look somewhat like waves along the top of the piece. Bending through heating steel to an orange heat allows bending as if the hot steel were clay or sarafy taffy; it takes significant but not Herculean effort. Bending can be done with the hammer over the horn or age of the anvil, or by inserting the work into one of the holes in the top of the anvil and swinging the free end to one side. Bends can be dress and tightened or widened by hammering them over the appropriately shaped part of the anvil. Upsetting is the process of making metal thicker in one dimension through shortening in the other. One form is by heating the end of a rod and them hammering on its as one would drive a nail, the rods get shorter, and the hot part widens. An alternative to hammering on the hot end, would be to place the hot end on the hot end of the anvil and hammer on the cold end, or to drop the rod, hot end down, onto a piece of settle at floor level. Punching may be done to create a decorative pattern, or to make a hole, for example, in preparation for making a hammer head, a smith would punch a hole in a heavy bar or rod for the hammer handle. Punching is not limited to depressions and holes. It also includes cutting, slitting and drifting; these are done with a chisel. The combining process; the five basic forging process are often combined to produce and refine the shapes necessary for finished products. For example, to fation a cross peen hammer head, a smith would start with a bar roughly the diameter of the hammer face, the handle hole would be punched and drifted (widened by inserting or passing a larger tool through it), the head would be cut (punched, but with a wedge), the peen would be drawn to a wedge and the face would be dressed by upsetting. Welding is the joining of metal of the same or similar kind such that there is no joint or seam; the pieces to be welded become a single piece. Now the smith moves with rapid purpose. The metal is taken from the fire and quickly brought together, the hammer lightly applying a few taps to bring the mating faces into complete contact and squeeze out the flux and finally return to fire again. The weld was begun with the taps, but often the joint is weak and incomplete, so the smith will again hit the joint to welding temperature and work the weld with light blows to ‘set’ the weld and finally to dress it to shape. ; Heat treatment Other than to increase its malleability, another reason for heating the metal is for heat treatment purposes. The metal can be hardened, tempered, normalized, annealed, case hardened and subject to other process that changes the crystalline structure of the steel to give it specific characteristics required for different uses. Finishing; Depending on the intended use of the piece a blacksmith, may finish it in a number of Ways. A simple jig that the smith might only use a few times in the shop it may get the minimum of finishing a rap on the anvil to break off scale and a brushing with a wire brush. Files can be employed to bring a piece to final shape, remove burrs and sharp edges, and smooth the surface. Grinding stones abrasive paper and emery wheels can further shape, smooth and polish the surface. Finishes include but are not limited to paint, varnish, bluing, borrowing, oil and wax. However, blacksmith’s striker (mazugi) is an assistant to the blacksmith. His job is to swing a large hammer in heavy forging operations. The Sarkin Makera quoted, “when ever there is any work or if the sultan needs the service of the blacksmiths, he will invite the Sarkin Makera and the Mazugi will be the person to follow him with his tools. Making an axe or a knife or a fireplace crane, set of door hinges or a handful of nails was what the village smithy did. His shop was the local hardware store. He could also repair a long chain or put rims on the wagon wheels or fix the axe that got chipped when it hit the rock. Whether the village needed swords or plough shares, the blacksmith made them. For without the blacksmith, the village could not survive As this whole iron industry evolved over time, blacksmithing became an umbrella for several specialisties. The blacksmith who made knives and swords was a bladesmith. The blacksmith who made locks was a locksmith. The blacksmith who maids suits of armour was an armorer. The blacksmith who made gun barrels and triggers was a gunsmith. The blacksmith who shod horses, was a farrier. The blacksmith, who made earrings, necklaces and other decorations for women, was a whitesmith. The blacksmith who specialized in moulding gold was a goldsmith. Thus the blacksmiths possess all these skills.  Assessment of the industry  Gandi describes the profession of blacksmithing as the main way of life to people of Assada saying that is belief that anybody who hails from the region must be a blacksmith hence it is a taboo for a person to abandon the occupation of his father and grandfathers. In every family of the Makera Assada, there must be an evidence of blacksmithing. This points to the importance of the craft and its antiquity, among the Assada people. The smiths of Makera Assada are always at their smithing shops and work places. Most of the blacksmiths are not farmers, so they do not go to farm but they have good relationship with the farmers who need their services. Smithing was particularly a different profession requiring artistic ingenuity and physical strength. Today’s blacksmith is more of an interpreter of the past and artist if you will rather than real item. As such it is hedged about with many taboos and requires long period of apprenticeship. The smiths are known for their use of iron and fire, to the extent that iron weapon or fire cannot harm them. The blacksmiths offered relief to farming and also supplied technological base. The blacksmiths provides items made necessary by social and day-to-day activities. Since the emergence of blacksmith into western Africa around 1500 BC, they are feared in some western African societies for their powerful skills in metal working, as we mentioned earlier most of the famous blacksmiths, iron weapon and fire cannot harm them, although some consider that as form of magic, but universally revered by West African for their technological pioneering. While common people fear the power of the blacksmith, they are highly admired and hold high social status. Because the trade is so specialized and dangerous, blacksmiths are often requisitioned by towns and villages where there are none. As such making an axe or a knife or a fireplace crane, bowls (baho) or a set of door hinges are his work. He could also repair door locks or fix the axe that get chipped when it hit a rock. What affected the Makera smiths was the importation of foreign iron wares, large quantities of cheap hardware are now on sale in the local markets. Knives, house utensils like bucket, bowls, necklaces, etc. Door bolts and hinges and other useful materials can be purchased at will anywhere. Formally the people depended for local smith, for the production of these goods. These foreign goods are cheaper and more convenient for its purpose. Although, the blacksmiths of Makera Assada specialized in all kind of iron work, they did not however, give priority to the production of locally made guns although hunters need them for hunting animals. This is so because of security risk as the government prohibited such production. In other words, local weapons like sword, spears etc. are produced there. Apart from moulding the iron to produce things, some individuals engage in traveling smith. They travels to many places as far as Kano, Zaria, Funtua and even beyond the borders of northern Nigeria, to buy irons that can be put to use, like damage vehicles and planes, pieces of iron rods, oil tanker’s containers and many more. At this metals are brought to Makera Assada until when they are needed any company or individual who want this kind of business or irons will be directed to Makera Assada area. The occupation diversification among the Makera particularly in their smithing crafts shows their technological prowess and advancement. This was witness during the jihad. In 1839, Henry Wadsworth Longfellow in his famous poem, \\"The Village Blacksmith\\" praises the blacksmith, “His brow is wet with honest sweat. He earn whatever he can, and looks the whole world in the face, for he owes not any man.

Combining advantageous lineage, shrewd marriage choices and the power afforded her from the secret Sande society, Yoko became a leader of considerable influence. She expanded the Mende Kingdom and at the time of her death, she was the ruler of the vast Kpa Mende Confederacy. Biography Madam Yoko, originally called Soma, was born around 1849 in the Gbo Chiefdom. She changed her name to Yoko at her Sande initiation ceremony, during which time she became known for her graceful dancing. Yoko's first marriage, which was unsuccessful, was to a man named Gongoima. After leaving Gongoima, Yoko's second husband was Gbenjei, Chief of Taiama. Although Yoko remained childless, Gbenjei made her his great wife, giving her economic power within her household. Following Gbenjei's death, Yoko married Gbanya Lango. In 1875, Gbanya was detained by British colonial officials in Taiamawaro. Yoko went directly to Governor Rowe to appeal for her husband's release. Rowe was impressed with Yoko's appeal and Gbanya was flogged, and then released. Following this incident, Gbanya made Yoko his great wife and began sending her on diplomatic missions. With the Sande, Yoko was able to wield significant power, not only amongst women, but Mende society as a whole. As a leader in this women's secret society, she made political alliances and took younger initiates as \\"wards\\" — later marrying them into other aristocratic lineages in an imitation of the trajectory of her own rise to power. In 1878, following her third husband's death, Yoko became the chief of Senehun. By 1884 she was officially recognised as \\"Queen of Senehun\\". This recognition came not only from her own people, but also from the British. She died in 1906, rumoured to have committed suicide.

From 1862, he formed his own office, forming a partnership with Henry Fuller in 1868. Cubitt's philosophy was laid out in his book, Church Design for Congregations. He attacked as obsolete the traditional nave and aisle design. When the \\"columns are thick or moderately thick, it inevitably shuts out a multitude of people from the service ... When, on the other hand, its columns are thin, the inconvenience is removed, but the architecture is ruined ... The type as it remains is but a shadow of its former self – a medieval church in the last stage of starvation\\". Too many architects were failing the principal criteria of their brief: \\"to produce a grand and beautiful church in which everyone could see and hear the service\\". His chapels are built as broad uncluttered spaces around a central pulpit and Lord's table. Cubitt lived most of his professional life at Loughton, where he built several private houses and three schools.

The station was reached by a footpath leading south from the village church in Salehurst. Closed in 1954, Salehurst Halt may yet see trains again as the Rother Valley Railway, a preservation society, is proposing to reopen the line from to , including the line through the halt.  History  Although only officially opened to the public in 1929, a simple platform had existed at Salehurst Halt since at least 1903. It had been provided by the Rother Valley Railway following a request in December 1902 by the vicar of Salehurst, the Reverend Edward Sing, for trains to stop in bad weather on Wednesdays and Sundays so that his organist, Miss Elsam, could arrive at the church in time for services. The organist lived close to Bodiam station and usually reached the church by car, although her journey became difficult during bad weather when the roads were slippery. The vicar contended that as a platform had been provided at Junction Road where trains could be flagged down, a similar facility should be provided at Salehurst which had a higher population. The site of the proposed stopping place was situated to the north of the Rother and was the location of Salehurst Siding which provided goods facilities only. This short siding had been provided for the benefit of the Bantony Estate. A simple earth and gravel platform held in by a wooden retaining face was duly provided and Colonel Stephens informed the Board of Trade of its existence in July 1903. In October 1913, the Salehurst Parish Council contacted Colonel Stephens about the possibility of establishing a public halt near the church. Although Stephens might have been favourable to the suggestion, nothing happened until 1929. In August 1929, the unexpected announcement was made that construction of a request stop at Salehurst had begun. Rather like Junction Road Halt, the station was no more than a single platform with a wooden bench and nameboard. The station, which began to appear in public timetables from 1929, seems to have been little used, even though it was one of the few stations on the line which was located close to the village it claimed to serve. It was also the only intermediate station not to be situated by a road crossing; it was reached by a footpath leading south from the church. The nearby small village of Salehurst consisted at the time of little more than a church, a public house and a cluster of houses, while Robertsbridge could be reached on foot in less than half an hour which was probably quicker than the usual late-running trains. Following nationalisation and the creation of British Railways, Salehurst Halt was considered for closure on the basis that it was \\"never used\\" according to W. H. Austen, Colonel Stephens' successor. The halt remained nevertheless open, much in its original state of construction, until the formal withdrawal of passenger services on Saturday 2 January 1954 Soon after public closure, the platform was removed by British Railways. The final passenger train to traverse the section of the line through Salehurst was a Locomotive Club of Great Britain special hauled by LB&SCR; A1 class Nos. 32662 and 32670 on 11 June 1961.  Present day  Nothing remains of the platform, although the station site is still reachable by footpath from Salehurst church. The public house still exists and is now known as \\"Salehurst Halt\\". The Rother Valley Railway, a preservation group set up in 1991, intends to reopen the line between and .Rother Valley Railway, \\"Our Roots\\". By June 2009, around of trackbed had been purchased from Robertsbridge to Northbridge Street, to the west of Salehurst, and the first train ran on that rebuilt section in September 2013.

They were formed through a merger between City-South and East Launceston in 1986, clubs in the former Northern Tasmanian Football Association (which is not related to the current NTFA). South Launceston was in the TFL Statewide League from 1986 to 1997, then the Northern Tasmanian Football League until 2008, then in the Tasmanian Football League until 2013. The club is nicknamed The Bulldogs, a name which was adopted upon the merger. City-South were the Redlegs and East Launceston had been known as the Demons. For their club colours they took City-South's red and white as well as the blue from East Launceston's guernsey to give them their current royal blue, red and white club colours. Club history =The Statewide League Era= South Launceston's first taste of statewide football could be described as a failure. In 12 seasons in the Statewide Competition the Bulldog's never contested the finals with a highest finish of 6th in 1992. During these 12 years South Launceston managed to collect 3 wooden spoons, this feat has only been matched by New Norfolk who have spent a longer period in the statewide league. =Northern Tasmanian Football League= In 1998 South Launceston pre-empted the collapse of the statewide league in 2000 when they decided to join the NTFL. This move greeted them with success with them winning the 1998 and 1999 NTFL Premierships. South Launceston remained competitive while they were in this competition. =Tasmanian State League= In 2008 the South Launceston Football Club accepted an invitation to leave the Northern Tasmanian Football League (NTFL) and join the new Tasmanian Football League in 2009. After three seasons of very poor on-field performance, which included two wooden spoons and a win- loss record of 8–46 across the three years, the club appointed Mitch Thorp as playing coach for 2012. Under Thorp, the club rose to the minor premiership in 2013, with a record of 17–3, and went on to defeat Burnie in the Grand Final to win its first statewide premiership. However, while its premiership season was ongoing, on 3 July 2013, a meeting of club members determined in a split vote to not pursue a further license in the Tasmanian State League beyond the season. The club rejected an opportunity to have a joint venture with the Prospect Senior Football Club for a 10-year license in the TSL. The Prospect Senior Football Club and the Prospect Junior Football Club subsequently took up a 100% share of the TSL license and formed the Prospect State Football Club t/a Western Storm. =Northern Tasmanian Football Association= In late 2013 the South Launceston Football Club was successful in being accepted into the Northern Tasmanian Football Association (NTFA) and will play the first division against pre-merger rivals Longford and Scottsdale as well as previously amateur and country teams that make up the competition. The South Launceston team that first contested the NTFA in 2014 was successful in winning the senior premiership with a victory over Deloraine in the Grand Final.

It belongs to the Byzantine text-type as one of the textual families of this group. It includes uncials, and although hundreds of minuscules, no early ones.  Description  The group was discovered by Hermann von Soden and designated by him with symbol Kx.H. von Soden Die Schriften, I/2, p. 713. The only distinction von Soden made among Kx members was according to the presence and type of the Pericope adulterae.H. von Soden Die Schriften, I/2, pp. 734-757. Due to the massive influence of the group on other groups and its lack of control, the boundaries of group remain blurred. The most problematic is the question, how many Kx readings can be missing and how many surplus readings can be added before a manuscript no longer deserves to be classified as Kx? According to the Claremont Profile Method Kx has following profile in Luke 1, 10, and 20 are:The word before the bracket is the reading of the UBS edition; the readings which are not bold are those of the TR.

According to von Soden the group Kx emerged in the 10th century.H. von Soden Die Schriften, I/2, p. 718 The group probably evolved from Family E, which is not as easy to distinguish as groups Kr and K1. Von Soden included these Kappa manuscripts in this family, which are not classified as Kr or Ki. The Textus Receptus was created on the basis of the manuscripts of this group.

Dixie has cruised Webster Lake since 1929, providing tours of the lake to generations of residents and visitors. A number of private owners cared for and operated the boat from 1929 until 2007 when title was transferred to a nonprofit organization called Dixie Sternwheeler Inc., which operates the boat for regular summer cruises from Memorial Day weekend through Labor Day and to allow chartered events such as weddings, retirement home outings, and company and community gatherings. Regular cruises last about 75 minutes and are each evening Monday through Saturday and during the afternoon and evening on Sunday. Many of the regular cruises feature period music and a narration with some history of the area, the lake, and Dixie. Dixie was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2009.

The town was shaped as an irregular hexagon, with a single main street along the line of the main Roman Road running east–west through the area, and an irregular pattern of side streets with tightly packed buildings leading off it. A picture of the Roman cistern at The Weir Garden in Herefordshire  Name  The Roman town is securely identified with the \\"Magnis\\" which appears both in the Antonine Itinerary and Ravenna Cosmography. The town is today sometimes referred to under the name \\"Magna\\". However, the town was not a colonia, nor a tribal capital, and Rivet and Smith derive the name from the Celtic word maen meaning 'stone' or 'rock'. The name may apply to the hills visible to the north of Kenchester.  History  The ruins of a Roman temple possibly associated with a high-status Roman villa, which may have connections to Magnae, lie inside the Weir Garden by the River Wye. There is an octagonal cistern filled by a spring, and a ruined buttress by the river. These are the highest standing Roman ruins in Herefordshire. Earthen defences have been found dating from the 2nd century, with later stone defences being built by the 4th century and occupation likely to have continued into the 5th century. In the Sub-Roman Period, the fort formed a citadel of the British kingdom of Pengwern. After Pengwern was overrun, the town was the base of the Mercian subkingdom of Magonsaete.

Protests The protests were sparked by the news of the execution of 30 Uyghur independence activists as well as the crackdown on attempts to revive elements of traditional Uyghur culture, including traditional gatherings known as meshrep. On 5 February 1997, after two days of protests during which the protesters had marched shouting \\"God is great\\" and \\"independence for Xinjiang\\", and had reportedly been dispersed using clubs, water cannon, and tear gas, the several demonstrators were killed by the Chinese Army gunfire.

Opened in 1932, it contains the most extensive collection of archaeological artifacts found in the country. The museum holds prehistoric and pre-Islamic collections, including many objects uncovered by archaeologists working in Volubilis, Banasa and Thamusida, which were first put on display in 1930-1932. This includes human remains from the middle Palaeolithic period (probably Neanderthals) to the Neolithic (4000 BC). A further find in 1957 saw the museum expand considerably, after which it became a National Museum and it has housed the National Museum collections since 1986. Pre-Roman and Roman civilisations are well represented in the museum with a number of notable Hellenistic-style bronzes such as the Dog of Volubilis, and the marble 'Ephebe Crowned With Ivy and Head of a Young Berber. Prehistoric cultures On the ground floor of the museum is an extensive collection of stone artifacts from prehistoric cultures. On display are a number of stone tools, arrows, axes, swords, items of pottery, altars and sarcophagi and polished stones and stelae carved with inscriptions. The floor also has a number of tomb fragments and rock carvings. It covers Acheulian culture from sites such as Sidi Abderrahmane and Daya el-Hamra, Pebble culture from sites such as Arboua, Douar Doum and Casablanca, as well as the Neanderthal-associated Mousterian industry and Aterian culture dating back to 4000 BC. The museum also contains the Jebel Irhoud fossils, which are the oldest human remains found in Morocco. The Neolithic culture of Morocco, based on agriculture and livestock and evolving technologies and rock art, has been found in the caves in the region of Tangier and Tetouan. A number of axes and swords have been uncovered which are on display. The ground floor of the museum also has space for temporary exhibitions and has a reconstruction of a mosaic found in Volubilis on the floor and a marble statue of Ptolemy, dating back to the Ptolemaic dynasty ca. 25-40 AD. A map in the lobby also illustrates the various archaeological sites discovered in Morocco and those from which the museum is constructed. The patio section has some of the best inscriptions in Morocco, such as the tombstone of N'khila and several Latin inscriptions. The stele of Abu Yacoub Yusuf comes from Chellah. The garden contains a substantial collection of stone steles, bases of columns and statues, wheels, altars, sundials, and fragments of stone baths showing beautiful mosaics. Pre-Islamic civilizations Items found at Volubilis form a major part of the Rabat museum collection The Pre-Islamic collection of the museum is derived from sites that include Volubilis, Banasa, Thamusida, Sala and Mogador, and which are organized by theme. The displays such as cooking utensils like plates, dishes, glasses and knives reveal much about every day life and Mediterranean relations in earlier times particularly between Morocco and Carthage. There are also the remnants of terracotta piping used in Roman public baths in Morocco. The museum has a noted collection of antique bronzes found mainly in Volubilis, including a bust of Cato the Younger from the 1st century and above all, the Ephebe Crowned with Ivy bust which depicts an ephebe, a young soldier in training naked, wearing a crown of ivy and holding a lamp in his left hand. The Lustral Ephebe is also on display, discovered in Volubilis in 1929, as is the bust of Juba II dating back to 25 BC, originally imported from Egypt. The Dog of Volubilis was found in 1916, dating back to Hadrian in the early 2nd century. The museum also has a number of notable marble statues from Roman times, notably the Head of a Young Berber from Augustus's reign, the Sleeping Silenus and a Sphinx. Numerous figures of Roman gods are on display including Venus, Mars and Bacchus and Egyptian deity figures such as Anubis and Isis. Sala-Chellah and Islamic archaeology The museum has an extensive collection found at the site of Sala-Chellah. This was a Mauretanian and Roman town, which flourished up to the 4th century and became a royal necropolis during the 13th century under the Merinids. The displays from this site are on the upper floor of the museum including an early Christian altar, a Byzantine censer, an ivory figurine of the Good Shepherd, and a number of items of pottery and oil lamps and a bust of Juba II. The museum also houses an extensive collection of coins and ceramics from the early-to-middle Islamic period, including pottery from Sijilmassa and a dish from Belyounech dating to the 14th century.

Only two airframes were built but were modified with different undercarriages, engines and seating. Development In 1947 SNCASO built two similar light aircraft both carrying the name Deauville. The first, the S.O.7050 which flew on 11 June had a tricycle undercarriage.Gaillard (1990) p.66 The second, the S.O.7055 flew on 1 July with a tailwheel undercarriage. The first and possibly the second machine was powered by a Mathis 4GO flat-four engine, though the S.O.7055 had a Minié 4.DC.32 flat-four at some point. It was later modified into the SO.7056. In 1948 both airframes were re-engined with Walter Minor 4-III engines and a third seat was added behind the two front side-by-side seats to produce the S.O.7060 Deauville. The undercarriage of the S.O.7050 was modified to be like that of the SO.7056, so both S.O.7060s had tailwheel gear. The Deauvilles were of all-metal construction with low/mid set wings of constant chord, straight tapered tail surfaces and a fixed tailwheel undercarriage. The canopy was entirely transparent and slid back to permit the access of pilot and passengers. Dual controls were provided.Green, 1956, p. 176 Operational history The first airframe F-BDVZ was flown by its makers in S.O.7060 form for several years and then by an aero club based at St- Cyr-l'Ecole airfield to the west of Paris during the later 1950s and through the 1960s.

Its last assignment was with Air Defense Command (ADC)'s Western Air Defense Force at Larson Air Force Base (AFB), Washington. It was established in 1952 in a general reorganization of Air Defense Command (ADC), which replaced wings responsible for a base with wings responsible for a geographical area. It then assumed control of several Fighter Interceptor squadrons that had been assigned to the 101st Fighter-Interceptor Wing, which was an Air National Guard unit mobilized for the Korean War. The wing's 569th Air Base Group briefly assumed the host responsibility for Larson, but the wing and group were inactivated only 45 days later when Larson became a Tactical Air Command base. The wing's units were transferred to the nearby 4702d Defense Wing.

Originally intended as the private chapel of the adjacent St Mary's Hall school, it was partly built in 1838 at the request of Frederick Hervey, 1st Marquess of Bristol; but arguments over whether or not it should also be open to the public delayed its completion for more than 10 years. It became the parish church of Kemptown in 1873, but declining attendances resulted in a declaration of redundancy in 1986. At that time it was taken over by the school and became its chapel, nearly 150 years after this was first proposed. The Early English-style stone and concrete structure has been criticised by architectural historians, but has been listed at Grade II by English Heritage for its architectural and historical importance. History Brighton's rapid growth in the early decades of the 19th century resulted in residential development filling in the gap on the cliffs between Thomas Read Kemp's high-class Kemp Town estate and the longer-established area around the Royal Pavilion and Old Steine, the centre of high society activity in the late 18th century. Roads such as Eastern Road and Bristol Road ran from west to east towards Kemp Town, and high-density housing branched off on roads to the north and south. This area became known as Kemptown . Kemp owned much of the land in the area, but in the 1820s he sold about to Frederick Hervey, 1st Marquess of Bristol. He had succeeded to the Earldom of Bristol when his father, the 4th Earl of Bristol (known as the Earl-Bishop), died in 1803. The Marquess, who assumed that title in 1826, was interested in church-building and works of charity. Soon after buying the land, he gave a portion to Reverend Henry Venn Elliott to allow him to build St Mary's Hall School. In 1837, Reverend Elliott began to plan for an Anglican church to serve the area, and the Marquess gave more land next to the school to allow one to be built there. Construction started in 1838, and the Marquess spent about £2,000 (£ in ) to ensure a rapid completion. However, disagreements soon arose over these plans: the Diocese of Chichester had not approved the proposal to open the church to the public, and had only given permission for the building to be a private chapel for the school; and the Vicar of Brighton, Reverend Henry Michell Wagner, disapproved of its location—it was considered to be too close to St George's Church. Correspondence and debate carried on for several years between the men involved, and an independent party—the Commissioners for Building New Churches—eventually had to take charge of the project. Construction was allowed to continue in 1848, after agreement was reached that the church could be used for public worship, and the Bishop of Chichester Ashurst Turner Gilbert conducted a consecration ceremony on 21 September 1849. The identity of the architect was not recorded, but sources suggest either George Cheesman Jr.—whose Christ Church in Montpelier Road, Brighton was very similar—or Thomas Cooper. Thomas Shelbourne was the builder; he may have had some influence in the design as well. The final cost was £4,800 (£ in ), most of which was contributed by the Marquess and Reverend Elliott. The church had a capacity of more than 1,000, and about half of the pews were free (not subject to pew rents). The others provided income to offset church expenditure until the pew rent system was abolished in 1930. Reverend Henry Venn Elliott's brother, Reverend Edward Bishop Elliott, became the vicar in 1853 and remained in charge until his death in 1875. Although he was buried at St Andrew's Church in Hove, a memorial stone was installed in the chancel. It is next to a tablet commemorating the Marquess of Bristol, who had died in 1859. The congregation and others also donated money to fund a new window in the east end as a memorial to him. In 1848, three bells were installed by Mears & Stainbank (now the Whitechapel Bell Foundry) of London, and three more were added in 1867 when the tower was given the clock which it was intended to have had from the beginning. A vicarage was added in 1888 after the 3rd Marquess of Bristol donated land from his estate, and larger-scale alterations took place between 1891 and 1892, when the new vicar commissioned architect W. Gilbee Scott to add a chancel, vestry, south transept and organ chamber and to alter the galleries. A north transept was never built, although it was planned. The new chancel was altered further by the addition of multicoloured paintwork and a marble reredos in 1913, during the short incumbency of Reverend Henry Venn Elliott's grandson, also called Henry Venn Elliott. The 3rd Marquess of Bristol paid for this work. In 1873, St Mark's became the parish church of Kemptown; St George's Church had originally held this status. By the 1980s, however, attendances were falling, and the Diocese of Chichester declared the church redundant as from 1 May 1986. Its parish was merged into that of St George's Church, which also gained the area covered by the parish of St Anne's Church, closed and demolished in 1986. The official name of this parish is now \\"St George with St Anne and St Mark\\". The building was then given to St Mary's Hall School for use as their private chapel, arts centre and concert hall. This meant that after nearly 150 years, it was being used for the purpose for which it was originally built. Architecture The east end undergoing restoration in 2008 Prominent architectural historians have criticised St Mark's Church. Nikolaus Pevsner wrote of its \\"terrible stone facing\\", while Harry Stuart Goodhart-Rendel considered both St Mark's and the very similar Christ Church (now demolished) to have \\"deplorable architecture [...] combining the smugness of the chapel [with] the peculiarity of the Gothic\\". The building does not reflect ecclesiastical architectural norms of the mid-19th century, partly because its construction started several years earlier and also because Reverend Elliott and the Marquess of Bristol held traditionalist, old-fashioned views. The church was built in the Early English Gothic Revival style using a combination of concrete, stone and ashlar. The concrete was used to imitate Kentish Ragstone; the north side is stuccoed to resemble ashlar; and genuine ashlar was used for the late 19th-century extensions. The concrete section has stone quoins at the corners. The south façade, facing Eastern Road, has lancet windows and small buttresses, and the north face is identical. The tower, topped with a spire, stands at the west end and also has lancets and corner buttresses; it is flanked by porches. All roofs are of slate. As originally designed, the nave and its adjacent aisles consisted of one open-plan area demarcated by narrow cast iron columns and piers. A stone chancel arch led to W. Gilbee Scott's chancel, with one bay and a window with tracery work. The vestry was on the north side of the chancel, opposite the organ chamber. The galleries, altered and mostly removed during the 1891–1892 work, originally ran round three sides of the interior and were held up by fluted columns. The church today St Mark's Church was listed at Grade II by English Heritage on 26 August 1999. It is one of 1,124 Grade II- listed buildings and structures, and 1,218 listed buildings of all grades, in the city of Brighton and Hove. St Mary's Hall School now owns the church. Reverend Henry Venn Elliott founded the school, which opened on 1 August 1836, and commissioned George Basevi to design it. He used the Early Tudor style, and the building cost £4,250 (£ in ), over half of which was paid by Reverend Elliott. Many extensions have been built subsequently. The school made some internal alterations to the church to allow part of it to be used as an arts centre and concert hall, but its main function is still religious. More extensive alterations are planned, for which planning permission has been granted; the arts centre area is to be extended and opened to groups from outside the school.

It allows users to search files, URLs, and contacts on their computer, as well as performing actions on the results. History and status GQSB was first released as a developer preview on January 12, 2009.Jitkoff, Nicholas. (2009-01-12) Official Google Mac Blog: Search Without Effort: The Quick Search Box. Googlemac.blogspot.com. Retrieved on 2013-11-29. It is still in beta, and a new version is released approximately monthly. The releases follow the sequence of chemical elements from the periodic table. The first public release was named Scandium and the current release is Cobalt.Downloads - qsb-mac - Quick Search Box for the Mac - Google Project Hosting. Code.google.com. Retrieved on 2013-11-29. Like other Google products such as the Chrome browser, QSB is open-source software. However, just as with Chrome, Google distributes official builds with extra functionality. In the case of QSB, this includes plugin validation, auto- update, and Google-branded icons. Later it became a fully open source product, and just called Quick Search Box. In Mac OS X Snow Leopard, QSB has replaced Google Desktop. Comparisons to other products QSB is similar to another Google product, Google Desktop. However, there are several key differences between the two products: * Operating system compatibility: While Google Desktop is cross-platform, QSB is at present Mac-only software. Google currently has an app that allows users to search the web using the iPhone.Google Search on the App Store on iTunes. Itunes.apple.com (2013-11-05). Retrieved on 2013-11-29. *Search methodology: Google Desktop maintains its own index of files for searching. It also indexes Gmail messages. QSB uses macOS's built-in indexing technology, Spotlight. Because of this, QSB is less resource-intensive than Google Desktop. However, there are drawbacks. QSB does not support indexing of Gmail messages (because Spotlight doesn't), and some aspects do not function if Spotlight is disabled.See Aug. 5 message in this thread: https://groups.google.com/group/qsb-mac- discuss/browse_thread/thread/7709d9a3ecc24d9a/0ba963b84d91d182 *Search philosophy: Google Desktop offers a search-only paradigm. On the other hand, QSB allows actions to be defined, which can be applied to search result. For example, after locating a file in QSB, it is possible to select among \\"open,\\" \\"get info,\\" \\"move to trash\\" and other actions. In this respect, it is similar to another macOS software tool, Quicksilver. The developer of Quicksilver, Nicholas Jitkoff is employed by Google and is one of the lead developers of QSB.Google Quick Search Box : looks like QuickSilver ain’t it?. Tech.gaeatimes.com (2009-06-10). Retrieved on 2013-11-29. *Extensibility: Both QSB and Google Desktop offer plugin APIs. However, in QSB it is possible to add both search result plugins and action plugins (integrating with the actions described immediately above). Google indicates that there is more leeway to expand QSB. Features In addition to file search, QSB is distributed with a suite of plugins that allow additional functionality. These include: * Bookmarks from common browsers (Firefox, Camino, Safari) * Definitions from the operating system dictionary * Results of simple calculations * Integration with Google Documents and Picasa Criticisms Users have noted that the functionality as compared to Desktop is reduced, especially in the area of in-document text searching, Gmail message searching and web history searching.

He was born in London. His mother was of Polish stock and his father was a professional musician who had settled in Britain from Austria-Hungary in the late 1880s. His three elder brothers were also musicians. He took up the violin at an early age and won a scholarship to the Guildhall School of Music. Firman’s first job, at the age of thirteen, was at the Playhouse Theatre, London, where he was part of a quintet playing entr'acte music. A year later his father negotiated a position for him in the orchestra at the Victoria Hotel in Northumberland Avenue. After only three months in this job he secured the part of Sascha, a gypsy violinist in the musical Sally at the Winter Garden Theatre, Drury Lane. The production opened on 10 September 1921, running for 383 performances. During this run, at the suggestion of the producer, George Grossmith Jr, Feuerman changed his name to Bert Firman, apparently so as to make it easier to bill in lights outside the theatre. When the run of Sally finished, Firman got a job as a violinist with the Midnight Follies Orchestra at the Metropole Hotel. Shortly after beginning this job, the current bandleader was indisposed, and Firman was offered the job. He was then only sixteen, and he would thereafter claim to have been the youngest bandleader in the world. In 1924, Firman became musical director for Zonophone Records (a subsidiary of His Master’s Voice) and in the following five years recorded over 750 sides for them. Throughout the 1920s Firman continued to lead his band from success to success, including a season in variety at the Alhambra Theatre, Leicester Square and the Coliseum Theatre, whilst still also directing the Midnight Follies and then later, bands at the Devonshire Restaurant and the Carlton Hotel. As well as recording with his band, Firman also produced many recordings with a smaller group called The Rhythmic Eight. The group included such prominent musicians as Sylvester Ahola, Chelsea Quealey, Frank Guarente, Arthur Lally, Danny Polo, Max Goldberg and Jack Jackson. In 1929 Firman was given a six-month contract to be a guest conductor at N.B.C., becoming the first British bandleader to broadcast in America. He then spent some time in Hollywood adding music to a large number of silent films. Firman then formed a band in London, which he took to Les Ambassadeurs restaurant in Paris. The band included Sam Costa, a young pianist who would later become a singer and actor, as well as Freddy Gardner, a talented British saxophonist. He spent several years in France before returning to London in 1937 to form another band. During this period he broadcast regularly for the B.B.C., and had several series on Radio Luxembourg. At the outbreak of war Firman moved to the Cafe de Paris with a band that included Ivor Mairants and George Melachrino. However, after a dispute with the management he walked out. He then joined up with the South Staffordshire Regiment. After completing his training he went to Egypt, Syria, Palestine and Persia, with Stars in Battledress, an organization dedicated to entertaining the troops. Later the party moved to Europe and crossed the Rhine with the British troops. After the war Firman was set to lead a band in London again, but was annoyed at being asked to audition for the B.B.C. He therefore went to lead a band in Paris again, where he formed a band at the Bagatelle Club. The band, which included Stephane Grappelli and Django Reinhardt, was to be his last. Firman finally retired from band leading, partly because the age of the big bands was coming to an end. He withdrew entirely from the music business, working on the London Metal Exchange until he opted for full retirement in 1976. He died on 9 April 1999.

During his time at NSA he started playing music with David Cadry, and his brother, Theodore Gerold, in his first band 8 Feet Under. =Victims In = In 1998 Gerold formed Victims In with lead singer Jim Louvau. The band was heavily influenced by Chicago based underground rock drag band Mary's Window and other industrial rock bands of the 1990s. The band often wore dresses, skirts, feminine make- up, and boas onstage to set themselves apart from other valley bands. They quickly gained local success with the release of their debut E.P Chinese Pornography and opened for bands like Linkin Park, Disturbed, MDFMK, Jack Off Jill, My Life With the Thrill Kill Kult, and Pitchshifter. Victims In also won 5 Phoenix New Times Showcase awards including \\"Best Industrial Act\\" and \\"Most Likely to Make It Big\\".

It is one of the few surviving examples of the small, wooden synagogues that were built by pioneers on the Canadian and American prairie. In the sanctuary, Torah is read to the congregation from the bimah and the Torah scrolls are stored in the aron kodesh on the east wall. The congregation face towards the east, and Jerusalem, in prayer. The ornamentation features symbols such as Stars of David, and natural forms. The synagogue was moved to Heritage Park Historical Village in Calgary at a cost of over a million dollars in 2008, becoming the first Jewish house of worship to be housed in a Canadian historic park. About 2,000 people attended the dedication of the synagogue in its new location on June 28, 2009.\\"Calgary synagogue honours Montefiore settlers\\", Calgary Herald, June 29, 2009 With an area of approximately 74 square meters, the building was constructed on the farm of Joseph, Fanny and Dov Chetner to serve the approximately 30 Jewish families as a community center, school, and house of worship. After the colony was abandoned in the 1920s, the Canadian government sold the building to a family around 1937 for $200. It was moved to the town of Hanna, Alberta and served as a two-bedroom house for the same family for almost 70 years.

Meshreps typically include music of the Muqam variety and ad-hoc tribunals on moral questions. \\"Meshrep\\" may also refer to the Islamic youth groups that became a political force in Ili, Xinjiang in the 1990s. The voluntary societies used extralegal means such as boycotts to enforce what they saw as Islamic mores against gambling, alcohol and drug abuse among young Uyghur men. Amid continuing political campaigns and antigovernment protests launched by these meshrep, the Xinjiang government cracked down on key religious leaders, including meshrep leaders, leading to urban violence in 1997 and the flight of meshrep leaders to Kazakhstan. In November 2010, China successfully petitioned UNESCO to list the traditional meshrep in its List of Intangible Cultural Heritage in Need of Urgent Safeguarding. Traditional structure The practice of meshrep is diverse among Uyghur communities, but there are some commonalities. Meshrep are usually held in the courtyard of one of the members' family home. Traditionally, meshrep were only held on the harvest, and on weddings, circumcisions, and girls' comings of age. Each meshrep consists of a leader (yigit bashi, an older man), a disciplinarian (passip begi), and 30 younger men (ottuz oghul), who sit on a carpet according to seniority. As the meshreps were primarily male bonding events, the women and children of the host's family were to stay inside the house and only interact with the men to bring them food or to otherwise serve them. Music is an essential component of the meshrep, and during the meshrep, men play progressively faster muqam melodies on the dutar while others compete to see who could perform whirling circle dances for the longest period of time. Some meshrep also feature songs, skits, and lectures from religious leaders. Aside from the entertainment value of the meshrep, these groups also formed part of the informal governance structure of Uyghur communities, and still do outside of China. Inside the meshrep, the moral transgressions of the men, such as polygamy, are publicly scolded and the men humiliated by slapping or caning. There is no limit on the length or attendance of the meshrep, and the Dolan Uyghurs were famed for hosting meshrep \\"attended by hundreds of people, and often last[ing] the whole night\\". Ili Youth Meshrep The meshrep is attested to in modern Chinese literature as early as 1942, in the socialist realist play Gulnissa, where the meshrep is portrayed as a secular, coeducational youth culture. During that time, the meshrep in Yining (Ghulja) consisted of musical performances and \\"informal court hearings\\" for community dissidents. Uyghurs in Kazakhstan began practicing the meshrep as early as the 1970s. After China's economic reforms in the 1980s, a middle class began to develop in China, and ordinary Chinese had more leisure time and discretionary income. At the same time, political and religious controls were loosening, and Chinese officials encouraged the building of mosques and the veiling of women. Contemporary developments in the region, including the global Islamic revival and the independence of the Soviet Central Asian states in 1992, inspired Uyghur independence feeling and the establishment of militant groups like the East Turkestan Islamic Movement (ETIM). Still, in the 1990s, the social and political life in the city of Yining (Ghulja) was predominantly secular. In Yining, young Uyghur men would informally gather, usually once a week, to drink baijiu, perform poetry and music, and otherwise socialize. These gatherings, called olturax, grew to perform important political and economic functions in Yining life. Islamic youth groups organized in the evenings grew in opposition to and eventually eclipsed the olturax, also serving \\"the foci for Uyghur resistance to Chinese rule\\". Calling themselves \\"meshreps\\", the clubs criticized the secular nature of the olturax and the alcohol consumption within as un-Islamic. These meshreps, which have been compared to the Catholic Knights of Columbus, were more formal than the olturax: tasked with providing \\"moral guidance\\", they kept strict membership lists and organized regular meetings, wherein members would read passages from the Quran. Meshrep practitioners were held to a strict code of Islamic conduct in their daily lives, including abstinence from alcohol and hashish. Initiation into the meshrep involved hazing rituals, and once admitted, men who did not continue to meet the group's standards of Muslim piety were given corporal punishment, such as caning, or petty fines by the group. These practices diverged significantly from the meshrep's secular tradition, and thus revived the meshrep in Yining with \\"new religious and nationalist meanings\\". Initially, both social reformers and the local government supported the meshreps, as they provided an outlet for young Uyghur men in an environment rife with unemployment, alcoholism, drug abuse, and gambling. But as the popularity of meshrep grew, meshrep groups became more assertive in their opposition to the government's goals. In the spring and summer of 1995, meshreps started a campaign of boycotts and intimidation against shops that sold liquor in Yining and the surrounding villages. Fearing the meshrep's political potential, Xinjiang authorities banned the gatherings in July 1995. However, most meshrep groups continued to operate in secret, or delegated their morals enforcement duties to legal neighborhood watch groups. When a football game organized by underground meshrep teams was canceled by authorities, the meshrep mobilized several hundred Uyghur men to march across government offices and to gather in Yining's main plaza, although there was no violence and the crowd dispersed after a few days. Authorities then drew a distinction between \\"healthy, traditional\\" meshrep and an \\"illicit\\" political and religious meshrep, encouraging the former but cracking down on the latter. In 1997, a national anticrime campaign resulted in the arrests of meshrep leaders and talibes in Yining, leading to mass riots called the Ghulja Incident. Modern meshrep After the Ghulja Incident, local antigovernment Uyghurs migrated to Almaty in Kazakhstan, where they continued to practice the meshrep as they had in Ili. In November 2010, UNESCO approved China' nomination of the meshrep to the List of Intangible Cultural Heritage in Need of Urgent Safeguarding. Due to Chinese government’s crackdown on Uyghurs since 2016, it was increasingly difficult for local Uyghur communities to organize their own meshrep, other than government-organized meshrep performance aimed at tourist.

Early life  Dent was born in Warragul Victoria, and educated at Warragul High School and Wesley College, Melbourne before being admitted to study Medicine at Melbourne University, initially at Queen's College.  Career  Graduating in Medicine with first class honours in 1979, in 1980 Dent undertook a placement with Mother Teresa at the Missionaries of Charity in Calcutta, the commencement of a lifelong commitment to medical care in developing nations. Dent completed his surgical training in the United Kingdom, being admitted to the Royal College of Surgeons in 1985. Following this he spent many years at a mission hospital at Shishong in Cameroon, where he was the only qualified surgeon in a small team of doctors. He helped bring modern medical and surgical methods to a chronically under- resourced hospital, and his surgical training was invaluable in helping people in hundreds of local villages. His fundraising efforts help upgrade the very basic equipment, and he was the first doctor on-scene with medical aid at the 1986 Lake Nyos disaster: the eruption of a cloud of volcanic gases which killed almost 2000 people and sparked a major international aid effort. Leaving Cameroon for the birth of his first son, Dent worked briefly in Australia before taking up a hospital role in Rabaul, New Guinea. His work on tropical medicine in New Guinea was cut short by the 1994 double volcanic eruption which almost completely destroyed the city. Although his wife and children were evacuated by the RAAF, Dent stayed on in New Guinea after the eruption, attending to the medical needs of many of the tens of thousands of displaced people. Returning to Australia in 1995, he became a member of the Australasian College of Tropical Medicine, was admitted as a fellow of the Australasian College of Emergency Medicine and became Director of Emergency at St Vincent's Hospital, Melbourne. At St Vincent’s, he instituted wide-ranging changes, increasing the number of patients seen each year from 24,000 to over 40,000, ensuring a very low rate of ambulance by-pass, advocating for a specialist mental health emergency centre, establishing the Emergency Practice Innovation Centre, and helping ensure that emergency medical services were provided with “compassion, justice, and a respect for human dignity”. He had a particular focus on ensuring that homeless people received good medical care. Earning a master's degree in Public Health and appointed as an associate professor at Melbourne University, he published many dozens of research papers and developed practice manuals used globally. He was active in the development and education of young doctors in Australia and internationally. Dent continued visiting New Guinea frequently, working for improved public health, particularly in the Southern Highlands and Gulf provinces. In order to ensure that this important public health work continued he helped establish the Pacific Health Foundation. In 2008 Dent was admitted to the Order of the International Federation for Emergency Medicine. Dent was diagnosed with cancer in June 2007. In 2008 Dent’s contributions were recognized with an Order of Australia on the Queens Birthday, one day before his death.  Personal life  Born one of five siblings, Dent met Blandine Janot (daughter of French constitutional lawyer and statesman Raymond Janot) while living as a guest worker on a kibbutz in Israel in 1977. They married in 1978, and had two sons. Dent joined the Catholic Church in 2007 and is interred at St Ignatius, Richmond Victoria.

The Bolivia–Chile boundary is about long and is demarcated by pillars in the Andes. Most of the boundary consists of straight lines between high mountain peaks. From the Argentina–Bolivia–Chile tripoint of Cerro Zapaleri, it extends northward through more than five degrees of latitude to the Peru–Bolivia–Chile tripoint at 17° 29' 55.0\\" S. latitude and 69° 28' 28.8\\" W. longitude. Historical background When Bolivia became independent from Spain on August 6, 1825, it took possession of the territories that corresponded to its colonial administration in accordance with the uti possidetis juris of 1810. Bolivia claimed the maritime territory westward from the Andes to the Pacific Ocean between the Río Salado on the south and the Río Loa on the north, which included part of the Atacama Desert. In 1842 Chile made claims to the desert area following the discovery and exploitation of nitrate deposits. With negotiations extending over a period of several decades, a decision was reached finally between Bolivia and Chile in a treaty dated August 10, 1866. Article 1 of the treaty of 1866 stated that \\"the line of demarcation of boundaries between Chile and Bolivia in the desert \\"shall henceforth be, the parallel of latitude 24 degrees South.\\" On December 5, 1872, a subsequent treaty confirmed the 24th parallel as the boundary between the two states. In accordance with various other treaties, Bolivia was given an equal share of revenues from guano deposits located in Chilean territory between the 24th and 25th parallels; and Chile had the same concession in Bolivian territory between the 24th and 23rd parallels, which area included the port of Antofagasta. In 1872, the Government of Bolivia granted a concession to a British firm to develop the nitrate deposits in Bolivian territory for a period of 15 years. The secret 1873 Treaty of Defensive Alliance (Bolivia–Peru), called defensive by the signer, was signed at Lima to guarantee the independence, sovereignty, and integrity of their respective territories, but the treaty was kept secret and not communicated to Chile. Therefore, Chile interpreted this pact as a secret alliance against them. In 1878 Bolivia placed a minimum tax on the production of the nitrate firm. In the intervening time, the concession had been transferred to a Chilean company making the leveling of the tax a violation of the treaty of 1866, in which Bolivia had agreed not to increase taxes on the industry without the approval of Chile. Chile asked Peru for a proclamation of neutrality, the latter did not respond, and Chile declared war on both Peru and Bolivia on April 5, 1879, precipitating the so-called War of the Pacific. The Treaty of Ancón ended the conflict between Peru and Chile on October 20, 1883, and a truce was signed by Bolivia and Chile at Valparaíso on April 4, 1884. In accordance with the terms of the truce, Chile was to administer Bolivian territory from the 23rd parallel northward to the Rio Loa, thus depriving Bolivia of the northern part of the province of Antofagasta and a Pacific littoral. The eastern boundary of the territory was given as a series of straight-line segments extending northward between stated points from Cerro Zapaleri (Cerro Sapaleri) through the two thirds of the northeastern slope of Cerro Licancabur, Cerro Cabana, most southerly bay head of Salar de Ascotan, Volcan Oyahue (Volcan Ollague) and Volcan Tua, and then by the boundary between the former Peruvian province of Tarapaca and Bolivia. In 1889, a railroad constructed inland from Antofagasta reached Uyuni on the Bolivian plateau. On May 18, 1895, a treaty signed by Chile and Bolivia confirmed the latter's loss of the territory between the 23rd parallel and the Rio Loa. A second treaty also was signed on the 18th by the two states that promised to transfer Tacna and Arica to Bolivia if Chile obtained them or, if not, the Caleta de Vitor, a small port south of Arica. On October 20, 1904, a peace treaty between Chile and Bolivia delimited the boundary through 96 specified points between Cerro Zapaleri and Cerro Chipe. Provision was made in the treaty for demarcation and boundary pillars were erected shortly thereafter. Chilean sovereignty was recognized by Bolivia over the territory from the ocean to the existing Argentine boundary between the 23rd and 24th parallels. Chile also recognized the right of Bolivia in perpetuity to commercial transit through its territory and ports, to be regulated by special agreements. The Salas-Pinilla Protocol of 1907 made two modifications of the 1904 boundary although ratifications of the protocol were not exchanged until 31 years later. A change was made between Cerro Chipapa and Volcan Olca in favor of Chile in order to keep the Collaguasi railroad, which connected with the Antofagasta-Uyuni railroad, entirely within Chilean territory. In return a second change transferred a small parcel of Chilean territory to Bolivia between Cerro de Patalani and Alto de Panantalla. In 1913, a railroad was completed between Arica and La Paz, which gave Bolivia access to the Pacific Ocean by means of a second railroad. In accordance with the terms of the Treaty of Ancón, Peru ceded unconditionally to Chile the littoral Tarapacá Province, bounded north by the Rio Camarones, south by the Rio Loa, east by Bolivia, and west by the Pacific Ocean. The provinces of Tacna and Arica, bounded north by the Rio Sama from its source in the mountains adjoining Bolivia to the sea, south by the Rio Camarones, east by Bolivia and west by the ocean, were to be administered by Chile for a 10-year period, followed by a plebiscite to determine whether the provinces would remain permanently under Chilean administration or if they would continue to be part of Peruvian territory. Efforts to reach an agreement on the terms of a plebiscite were unsuccessful, and Chile remained in possession of Tacna and Arica after the expiration of the 10-year period stipulated in the Treaty of Ancón. In a treaty signed at Lima on June 3, 1929, Article 2 delimited the international boundary dividing the disputed territory of Tacna and Arica between Peru and Chile. A complementary protocol signed on the same day stated in Article 1 that neither government might without previous agreement with the other cede to any third state all or any part of the territory which, in accordance with the treaty, remained under their respective sovereignties. In Article 2 of the protocol, port facilities granted to Peru under Article 5 of the treaty should consist of free transit to Peruvian territory and from such across Chilean territory. The placing of pillars marking the boundary was completed the following year and a demarcation protocol was signed at Lima on August 5, 1930. In 1939, Chile announced a plan to divert the waters of the Rio Lauca westward through a canal and tunnel into the Quebrada Azapa for purposes of irrigation in the Valle de Azapa and hydroelectric-power generation. Within six miles of the international boundary, Lago Cotacotani is the source of the Rio Lauca which flows successively westward, southward, and eastward for about 50 miles in Chilean territory before entering Bolivia where it ultimately reaches Lago Coipasa. Construction on the project was not started until 1948, and water diversion began 14 years later from a dam located about 16 miles southwest of Lago Cotacotani. In 1962 Bolivia threatened to take the matter of water diversion before the Organization of American States (OAS) which organization ultimately requested the Governments of Bolivia and Chile to resort to one of the means of pacific settlement of disputes provided for in the inter-American system. Geographic setting The Bolivia–Chile boundary extends along the spectacular heights of the Cordillera Occidental of the Andes. From 13,000 feet at the Peru tripoint, it connects with numerous snow- capped peaks exceeding 18,000 feet in elevation to the Argentina tripoint Cerro Sapaleri, at 18,530 feet. Several peaks are above 19,000 feet such as Cerro Sairecahur with an elevation of 19,587 feet. In general mountain passes are high and not easily accessible with some over 14,000 feet in elevation. Barren rocky slopes, limited areas of short grasses, and scattered mountain shrubs are typical along the boundary. Near the boundary salars or salt plains are common such as the Salar de Coipasa in Bolivia and the Salar de Ascotán in Chile. Because of great differences in the elevation and exposure of landform features in the Andes, climatic conditions range broadly along the boundary. Characteristic of the high elevations, mean annual temperatures are relatively low and precipitation tends to be greater on the windward side than on the leeward side of the mountains. The temperatures and precipitation of enclosed valleys and plateau areas contrast greatly with the exposed peaks. Most of the high peaks are snow-capped throughout the year. In general, the area is sparsely populated and few roads cross the boundary. Small towns serve mining companies, transportation maintenance stations, and scattered people engaged in pastoralism or limited cultivation.

In accordance with the treaty of 1904, the boundary between Cerro Zapaleri (Cerro Sapaleri), the Argentina tripoint, and Cerro Chipapa is as follows: :From the highest peak of Cerro Zapaleri (1), in a straight line to the highest point (2) of the ridge going toward the south of the Cerros de Guayaques in the approximate latitude of 22° 54'; from here another straight line to the Portezuelo del Cajon (3), and following the divide of that ridge which runs north by the northern slope of Cerro Juriques (Volcan Juriques) (4), through the innominated point located at two thirds of elevation of the northeastern slope of Volcan Licancabur (Cerro Licancabur) in the latitude of 22° 49' 41\\" and longitude of 67° 52' 35\\" (5), Cerro Sairecabur (6), [Cerro] Curiquinca (7), and Volcan Putana or [Cerro] Jorjencal (8,) from this point [the boundary] follows by one of the spurs in the direction of the Cerro del Pajonal (9), and in a straight line to the southern peak of the Cerros de Tocorpuri (10), from where it follows again by the divide of the Cordon del Panizo (Cerro Panizo) (11), and Cerros de Tatio (12). It follows always to the north of the divide of the Cordon del Linzor (Volcan Linzor) (13) and of the Cerros de Silaguala (Cordon de Silaguala) (14) from whose northern peak (Volcan Apagado) (15) it goes by a spur to the Cerrito de Silala (Cerro Silala) (16) and then in a straight line to the Cerro Inacaliri or [Cerro] Cajon (17). :From this point it goes in a straight line to the peak that seems to be in the center of the group of the Cerros del Inca or Barranca (Faldas de Barrancane) (18) and then along the divide following northward by the ridge of the Cerro de Ascotan or [Cerro del] Jardin (19); from the peak of this mountain it goes in a straight line to the peak of Cerro Araral (20), and by another straight line to the peak of Volcan Ollague (Volcan Oyahue) (21) :From here [the boundary goes] in a straight line to the highest peak of Cerro Chipapa (22),... The Boliviano-Chilean protocol of 1907 modified the boundary of 1904 between Cerro Chipapa and Volcan Olca (25) and transferred a small parcel of Bolivian territory to Chile.The treaty of 1904 had previously delimited the boundary between Cerro Chipapa and Volcan Olca as follows: :...[from] the highest peak of Cerro Chipapa (22), descending to the west by a ridge to the peak of Cerro Cosca (23). From this point it follows the divide along the ridge that connects with the Cerro Alconcha (24) and from here it goes to the Volcan Olca (25) by the highest divide. :Between Cerro Chipapa and Volcan Olca, the boundary shall be a straight line from Cerro Chipapa, as marked, to the northern crest of Cerro Paroma (Cerro Paruma), leaving inside Chilean territory a space of not less than one kilometer between the easternmost point of the Collaguasi railroad and the frontier: from Cerro Paroma it shall continue along the crest which unites Cerro Paroma with Volcan Olca. The boundary between Volcan Olca and Cerro de Patalani is delimited by the treaty of 1904. :...From this volcano [Volcan Olca] it follows by the ridge of the Cerros del Millunu (Cordon del Milluni) (26), of [Cerro] Laguna (27), Volcan Irruputuncu (28), [Cerro] Bofedal (29) and [Cerro] Chela (30), and from a high point of mountains, it arrives at Milluri (Cerro Milliri) (31) and then Huallcani (32). :From here it goes to the Cerro Caiti (33) and follows by the divide to Cerro Napa(34). :From the peak of this mountain it goes in a straight line to a point (35) situated 10 kilometers to the south of the east peak of Cerro Huailla (36), from where it goes in a straight line to the height mentioned, doubling back again to the east and following by a ridge of the Cerros Laguna (37), Corregidor (38), and Huaillaputuncu (39) to the easternmost stones of [Cerro] Sillillica (40), following along a ridge that goes northwest to the peak of Cerro Piga (41). :From this mountain, it goes in a straight line to the highest peak of Tres Cerritos (42) and follows in a straight line to Cerro Challacollo (43) and to the narrowest part of the fields of Sacaya (44), opposite Vilacollo. :From Sacaya the boundary goes in a straight line to the stones of Cueva Colorada (45) and Santaile (46), where it follows to the northwest by the Cerros Irruputuncu (47) and Patalani (48). A second modification of the 1904 boundary made by the Boliviano-Chilean protocol of 1907 between Cerro de Patalani and Alto de Panantalla (54) transferred a small piece of Chilean territory to BoliviaThe treaty of 1904 had previously delimited the boundary between Cerro Patalani and Alto de Panantalla as follows: : ...From this peak [Cerro Patalani (48)] it goes in a straight line to the Cerro Chiarcollo (49), crossing the Rio Cancosa (50) and from here also in a straight line to the peak of Cerro Pintapintani (51) following from this peak by the ridge of the Cerros Quiuri (52), Pumiri (Cerro Pumire) (53) and Panantalla (54). :Between Cerro Patalani and Panantaya (Alto de Panantalla), the frontier shall be a straight line from Cerro Patalani to the crest of Cerro Irpa Pueblo, and from there in a straight line to Cerro Irpa; from there it shall follow the divide to the highest point of Cerros Sillayhuay (Cordillera Sillajhuay) and shall double in the north in order to follow the Cerros de Torini (Cerro Toroni) divide to the Apacheta de Oje, and from there the divide to Cerro Armasaya. From this point it shall be a straight line to Apacheta Tirujalla (Apacheta Tillujaya) and from there a straight line to the Alto de Panantaya, as marked. The boundary between Alto de Panantalla and the Peru tripoint is delimited by the treaty of 1904: :...From the height of Panantalla it goes in a straight line to Tolapacheta (55), half the distance between Chapi and Rinconada, and from this point in a straight line to the Portezuelo Huailla (56); next it passes by the peaks of the Cerros Lacataya (57) and Salitral (58). It returns to the north going in a straight line to the Cerrito Tapacollo (Cerro Tapacollo) (59) in the Salar de Coipasa, and in another straight line to the marker of Quellaga (60) from which it follows in straight lines to the Cerro Prieto (Cerrito Prieto) (61) to the north of the field of Pisiga (Pisiga Sucre), Cerrito Toldo (Cerro Toldo) (62), markers of Sicaya (63), Chapillicsa (64), Cabarray (Cabaray) (65), Tres Cruces (66), Jamachuma (67), Quimsachata (68) and Chinchillani (69), and cutting across the Rio Todos Santos (70) it goes by the landmarks of [Cerro] Payacallo (71) and Carahuano (72) to Cerro Capitan (74). :It then follows northward by the divide of the ridge of the Cerros Lliscaya (75) and Quilhuiri (76) and from the summit at this point it goes in a straight line to the Cerro Puguintica (77). :To the north of this last point, Bolivia and Chile agree to fix the following boundary: :from the Cerro Puquintica (77) it goes northward by the ridge toward Macaya, crossing in this place the Rio Lauca (78) and then following in a straight line to the Cerro Chiliri (Cerro Chilliri) (79); it continues northward by the divide to the Portezuelo de Japu (80), the peak of [Cerro]. Quimasachata (81), Portezuelo Tambo Quemado (82), the Cerros de Quisiquisini (83), Portezuelo Huacollo (Paso Guacollo) (84), peaks of the Cerros de Payachata [Nevados de Payachata] (85 and 86), Cerro Larancahua (87), to the Portezuelo Casiri (88). :From this point it goes to the Cerros de Condoriri (89) that separate the waters of the Rio Sajama and Rio Achuta from those of the Rio Caquena or Cosapilla, and continues by the ridge between those hills, and goes to the Cerro Carbiri (91), passing by the Portezuelo Achuta (90); from Cerro Carbiri, it descends to the narrows of the Rio Caquena or Rio Caspailla (92), above the post house which also bears the last name. It will then follow the course of the Rio Caquena or Rio Cosapilla to the outlet (93) in the meadows of the Estancia, from where it goes in a straight line to the marker to Visviri (94). From here it goes in a straight line At the time of the treaty of 1904, a permanent boundary had not been established between Peru and Chile, and the latter administered the Arica - Tacna area. Therefore, the Bolivia-Chile boundary was delimited northward of the present Peru tripoint as follows: :...From here [the marker of Visviri (94)] it goes in a straight line to the [Cerro] Santurario (95) that is found north of the [Rio] Maure on the northwest of the confluence of this river with another that comes from the north, two kilometers north of the Maure Posthouse; it continues northwest by the ridge that leads to the marker on the Cerro Chipe or Cerro Tolacollo (96), the last point on the frontier.[northward to the Peru tripoint]In accordance with the protocol of 1930 relative to the demarcation of the Chile-Peru boundary, the Peru tripoint is boundary pillar No. 80 and marker No. 5 of the old Bolivia-Chile boundary. The tripoint is located at 17° 29' 55.0\\" S. latitude and 69° 28' 28.8\\" W. Present situation Bolivia continues to have aspirations for a territorial outlet to the Pacific Ocean. Chile has granted Bolivia duty-free use of the ports of Arica and Antofagasta and of the railroads connecting them. An agreement has not been reached by the two states relative to the diversion of water from the Rio Lauca by Chile. There seems to be no dispute with respect to the alignment of the Bolivia-Chile boundary. Diplomatic relations between Bolivia and Chile have been broken since April 1962, with a shorter period of diplomatic relations in 1975 during the Pinochet–Banzer negotiations. After five years of negotiation, Bolivia sought a ruling by the International Court of Justice on the matter. On October 1, 2018, the ICJ ruled against Bolivia's claim that Chile was under a \\"legal obligation to negotiate a sovereign access\\" to the sea for Bolivia.

The church was acquired by the Treasurer of Wells Cathedral in 1227 and he became the rector and patron of the church. He lived in the Treasurer's House. The tower dates from around 1505, in four stages, with offset corner buttresses to the full height of the tower, to replace the previous one over the central crossing. At the same time the rest of the church was also restored and expanded. This expansion was paid for by Lady Margaret Beaufort. In July 1645 the church was used as a billet and damaged by the troops of Oliver Cromwell after a battle at Bridgwater, this included the removal of the statues of saints from niches in the clerestory. The church was restored by Benjamin Ferrey, who was architect to the Diocese of Bath and Wells from 1841 until his death, and also in 1883-84 by Ewan Christian when a new pulpit was installed. The interior includes a stucco plaster altar and an organ which was previously in Wells Cathedral. In 1919 the Lady Chapel was restored and furnished, and a screen added across the aisle arch. In 1921 the Jacobean altar table, which had long been used as a vestry table, was repaired and replaced as the High Altar. In 1923 the leads of the tower and aisles were renewed and repaired.

Later, the term was adopted by others in the continental philosophy and philosophy of science traditions. Wittgenstein himself used the term sparingly in his works Philosophical Investigations and On Certainty. Other writers have gone on to use the term in many ways. Description Comments about a form of life are not explanations meant to comprehend the concept as a whole. The view that stringing together simple, non-controversial statements of ordinary understanding will illuminate something that is supposedly already understood is, in Wittgenstein's view, quite nonsensical. The concept of 'form of life' itself, for example, is extremely difficult to get right, as is indicated by the widely divergent things that have been said about it since Wittgenstein introduced it in the books cited above. In response to a question from an imagined interlocutor, Wittgenstein notes the following: : \\"So you are saying that human agreement decides what is false and what is true?\\" – It is what human beings say that is false and true; and they agree in the language they use. That is not agreement in opinions but in form of life. (Wittgenstein, Philosophical Investigations, para. 241 [emphasis not in original]) Ordinarily, humans do not step away from their activities in order to justify how or why they say and do what they say and do. However, their activities, when investigated in an historical way, will be found to reflect a particular form of life. When such questions do arise, a philosophical investigation will involve reminding the questioner of certain things he or she takes for granted and which, when noted, can help dissolve the question. We do what we do because we assume a given form of life, which gives our actions, ourselves, and the world meaning. Form of life is what makes meaning itself possible. Use by Agamben Italian philosopher Giorgio Agamben takes up the intersecting concepts of form-of-life, rule-following and use, but besides attempting to deconstruct what Wittgenstein meant, traces these concepts genealogically, in the manner of Stirner or Rousseau. In The Highest Poverty – Monastic Rules and Form-of-Life, Agamben looks at the emerging genre of written rules starting in the 9th century, and its development into both law and something beyond law in the Franciscan form-of-life, in which the Franciscans replaced the idea that we possess our life (or objects generally) with the concept of 'usus', that is 'use'. Agamben finds earlier versions of form-of-life in monastic rules, developing from 'vita vel regula', 'regula et vita', 'forma vivendi', and 'forma vitae'. Thus Agamben takes Wittgenstein's concepts and applies them to the history of Western monasticism in order to rethink the consequences of these concepts for doing (contemporary) politics — the main goal of his Homo Sacer-project, which started with Homo Sacer: Sovereign Power and Bare Life and to which The Highest Poverty belongs.

Marriage and issue Florestine married Count Wilhelm of Württemberg (later Wilhelm, 1st Duke of Urach), son of Duke Wilhelm of Württemberg and his morganatic wife Baroness Wilhelmine von Tunderfeldt-Rhodis, on 15 February 1863 in Monaco. Florestine and Wilhelm had two sons: *Wilhelm Karl Florestan Gero Crescentius (1864–1928), Count of Württemberg, 2nd Duke of Urach, and nominally King of Lithuania as Mindaugas II of Lithuania :∞ 1892 Duchess Amalie in Bavaria (1865-1912), eldest daughter of the Duke Karl-Theodor in Bavaria :∞ 1924 Princess Wiltrud Alix Marie of Bavaria (1884-1975), sixth daughter of Ludwig III of Bavaria *Josef Wilhelm Karl Florestan Gero Crescentius (1865–1925), Prince of Urach Florestine's husband Wilhelm had converted to Roman Catholicism, in 1841, for his first marriage to Théodolinde de Beauharnais, who died in 1857. Monaco Succession Crisis of 1918 Florestine, according to the rules governing succession to the throne of Monaco, was able to marry without relinquishing her rights. When her grandnephew Louis II, Prince of Monaco, ascended to the Monegasque throne, Florestine's son Wilhelm claimed his rights for his succession to the princely throne of Monaco and the Grimaldi noble titles. However, France had undergone two wars against Germany and did not wish to see German princes ruling the Principality of Monaco. Therefore, France reached an agreement with the principality allowing the illegitimate daughter of Louis II, Charlotte, to be his heir presumptive to the princely throne and Grimaldi noble titles. Charlotte renounced and ceded her rights to the princely throne on 30 May 1944 to her son Rainier who became Rainier III, Prince of Monaco.

The gymnasium has hosted the likes of the Harlem Globetrotters, the B.C. high school basketball championships, Billy Idol and is the current venue for the finals of all division of the TELUS Basketball Classic. In October 2010, the Toronto Raptors held their first training in the province of BC in the venue. Playing sports in this facility was unique because of the floor's special spring. Folklore has it that horsehair had been inserted beneath the wood surface, which has been since removed. It is still viewed as one of the premier University level basketball/volleyball facilities in Canada.

Similar to media monitoring it is becoming increasingly popular as a base for strategic insight development alongside other forms of market research. Buzz monitoring involves the checking and analysis of myriad online sources such as internet forums, blogs, and social networks. Data can be provided in real time, which means that critical issues can be picked up instantly. It is also comparatively inexpensive compared to other market research tools and can actually guide further product and service developments. Influence is a key question in buzz monitoring – does this particular person and/or this particular piece of content matter and is it influencing others? Hence, the influence of a source is an important buzz monitoring metric that should be benchmarked. Buzz monitoring is implemented by businesses for a variety of reasons, namely to improve efficiency, reaction times and identify future opportunities. Insights gained can help guide marketing and communications, identify positive and negative customer experiences, assess product and service demand, tackle crisis management, round off competitor analysis, establish brand equity and predict market share. Tools In the era of the technological prosperity, social networks have become an essential tool for buzz monitoring, due to the large scale of opinions and information shared between users. Recently, the growing interest in monitoring and scrutinizing opinions shared on-line was the subject of a TREC Conference. One of the main advantages of using social networks for buzz monitoring is price availability, as this method could be considered cheap compared to other sources of information. Many types of social networks have added specific features which allow people to observe the on-line activity of their friends or followers. One of the first examples is the \\"Hot Topics\\" section on Blogspot, which was added to the website in 2009. Other social networks, including Google with \\"Google Alerts\\", Facebook, Twitter and Yahoo have also added similar services. Twitter, which uses the micro-blogging platform, could be reasonably considered as one of the most powerful free tool for buzz monitoring. With its micro-blogging facilities, users can share their thoughts quickly and promptly, view the latest trending topics, and search the profiles of people without the need to \\"follow\\" them. Other widely used tools such as Mention, Alterian-SM2, BrandWatch and Converseon are designed specifically for monitoring information. These online tools are not available for free; however, they provide more features and are more complicated and sophisticated than online platforms such as Google Alerts. When deciding which tool would better suit a specific product, one needs to carefully consider some features such as which market segment one wants to consider and what type of data one is expecting to collect. For example, if someone wished to define the strategy for the future, they would probably be looking for the tool that allows them to track information during the past several months or years. The collected information can then be restrained using data analysis tools, built on Structured Query Language (SQL) for later use. Types of buzz The direct correlation between the consumer response and the success of the brand or product has recently been determined. The buzz around the certain product can be divided into several groups: positive buzz, sometimes called \\"white buzz\\", negative buzz, also called \\"black buzz\\", and neutral buzz. The white and the black buzz correspondingly can be calculated using binaryEnotion and following formulas: :White Buzz = (Positive > (Neutral + Negative)) :Black Buzz = (Negative > (Neutral + Positive)) The abovementioned notations can be best described by the assumption that the white buzz is formed when the total amount of positive comments is greater than the sum of neutral and negative ones. The same can be applied in the case of the black buzz. To obtain more accurate data, it might be prudent to search as much information as possible, as the correctness of data is directly proportional to the amount of the consumers' responses examined. Recent studies have indicated that the impact of negative comments tends to be higher than that of positive ones as they think they are more credible. However, it might depend on customer's reaction on different type of comments. People are also more inclined to share a negative experience than a positive one in order to raise public awareness and prevent their friends and relatives from using the same service. Thus, it might be recommended for a big company to reduce the black buzz around the product or brand rather than increasing the amount of positive comments. Effects Buzz, also sometimes referred to as a \\"word-of-mouth phenomenon\\", has always been around and can have a great effect on a product's reputation. While advertisements get more obsolete and hard to understand, communication between the user and producer is becoming more and more common. Managers of the company should always be aware of the buzz surrounding their product, work in cooperation with the audience and be constantly prepared to stop any enormous negative attack from the core. Having collected all necessary information from the customers, managers should compare the functioning in the market of their own product to the competitor's one and to determine the further strategy, defining strong and weak sides of the product. As suggested, there are exactly two pathways of the response to an online buzz from the different point of views. Managers of the companies affected by an existing buzz would try to reduce or increase the costs of the product depending on what kind of reviews they have received; they also might try to improve the service or goods in case of prevailing amount of negative opinions. Customers would likewise make their decisions about the product, deciding to either buy it in future or avoid further usage. Both pathways directly affect the company's profitability and brand image. When used in the right way, buzz monitoring could also increase the public awareness of the product. However, there are also some disadvantages linked to buzz monitoring. As online buzz is getting more important and easy to access, marketing agents are trying to increase the ratio of positive reviews and to create the great amount of buzz around the certain product or service they need to sell in order to increase the profit and public awareness.

It is a choral symphony,Wilson, New Grove (2001), 24:848. written for tenor, countertenor, chorus, and orchestra. It was first performed on April 12, 1984, in Moscow.Schnittke xxiii. Structure The symphony is written in a single movement of 22 variations and is approximately 45 minutes in length. Ronald Weitzman writes, \\"The form of Schnittke's Fourth Symphony [is] at once cross- shaped and spherical.... The composer draws musically on the three main strands of Christianity--Orthodox, Catholic, Protestant--while underlying this is a three-note semitone interval motif representing synagogue chant, thus symbolizing the Jewish source of Christianity.\\" The result, Ivan Moody writes, is that Schnittke \\"attempts to reconcile elements of znamennïy and Gregorian chant, the Lutheran chorale and Synagogue cantillation ... within a dense, polyphonic orchestral texture\\"Moody, New Grove (2001), 22:566. A tenor and a countertenor also sing wordlessly at two points in the symphony. Words are saved for a finale in which all four types of church music are used contrapuntallyWeitzman, notes for Chandos 9463, 7. as a four-part choir sings the Ave Maria. The choir can choose whether to sing the Ave Maria in Russian or Latin. The programmatic intent of using these different types of music, Schnittke biographer Alexander Ivashkin writes, is an insistence by the composer \\"on the idea ... of the unity of humanity, a synthesis and harmony among various manifestations of belief.\\"Ivashkin, Schnittke, 165. Overview While in Vienna in 1980, Schnittke decided to embrace Christianity and be baptized but was not sure what church to join. His father had been born JewishIvashkin, Schnittke, 15. but was an atheist and both his parents had been devoted to Communist ideals. He was drawn to Catholicism but felt that, as a Russian, a move toward Russian Orthodoxy might be more appropriate. Schnittke decided to be baptized as a Catholic but made his confessions twice yearly afterwards to a Russian Orthodox priest who would visit his Moscow apartment.Ivashkin, Schnittke, 160. The Fourth Symphony reflects Schnittke's religious dilemma.Ivashkin, Schnittke', 161. The symphony is based on the traditional 15 Mysteries of the Rosary of the Roman Catholic Church, which retrace the life of Jesus through the eyes of his mother Mary.Weitzman, notes for Chandos 9463, 5. In the 22 variations that make up the symphony's single movement, The actual number of variations in the Schnittke Fourth Symphony is \\"a subtle non-synchronicity,\\" of the piece, considering the \\"3 by 5 scheme\\" of the Rosary upon which these variations are reportedly based. Weitzman, notes for Chandos 9463, 5. Schnittke \\"follows the canons of the Passions of Jesus Christ,\\" depicting \\"decisive moments in Christ's life\\"Weitzman, notes for Chandos 9463, 6. and, as in the Second Symphony, giving a detailed musical commentary on what is being portrayed. Alexander Ivashkin writes that when the symphony received its first performance in Paris, \\"Schnittke was generally pleased with the European precision of the playing. He nevertheless felt it should be sung by a Russian Choir. A Western performance might be brilliant, but it would inevitably lack the Russian intensity of extreme religious sensation.\\" Instrumentation The symphony is scored for solo tenor, counter-tenor, a chamber choir and a chamber orchestra comprising 1 flute (doubling alto flute), 1 oboe, 1 clarinet, 1 bassoon, 1 horn, 1 trumpet, 1 trombone, 4 percussionists playing glockenspiel, vibraphone, bells, gong and tam-tam, celesta, harpsichord, piano, and strings.https://www.boosey.com/cr/music/Alfred-Schnittke-Symphony-No-4/2378 Notes \\\\---- References * Ivashkin, Alexander, Alfred Schnittke (London: Phaidon Press Limited, 1996). . * Sadie, Stanley (ed.).

Longford has their strongest decade in the 1950s when they claimed three NTFA premierships, including their breakthrough triumph in 1955. They had previously never won the competition but had been runners-up in 1931, 1940 and 1953. In 1959 the club attempted to win their third premiership in a row but lost the Grand Final to City-South. The Tigers were Tasmanian State Premiers in 1957. After accounting for Ulverstone, premiers of the North West Football Union, in the preliminary match, Longford defeated North Hobart by 21 points in the decider at York Park. The club spent one unsuccessful year in the NTFL (1987) before realising that the football standard was too high for them so they transferred to the Tasmanian Amateurs where they remain to this day.

L. Binger, was a 20th-century American psychiatrist who wrote books and articles on a wide range of topics including medicine and psychiatry and testified in the trial of Alger Hiss. Background Carl Alfred Lanning Binger was born in 1889, the son of Frances (née Newgass) and Gustav Binger. He had three siblings: Elsie Naumburg, Robert Binger, and Walter D. Binger. He graduated from Harvard Medical School in 1914.  Career  In 1943, E. B. White consulted Binger, a pioneer in the field of psychosomatic medicine, during a nervous breakdown in the spring of that year. In 1946, Binger was certified as a psychiatrist after deferral for insufficient training. In the summer of 1951 he resigned his position of directing the two-million-dollar-endowed Mary Conover Mellon Foundation out of concern for the \\"sexual development of undergraduates in an atmosphere of supervision by matriarchy.\\"Crimson Saturday, June 02, 1951 Hiss Case Binger's wife was a college classmate of Alger Hiss's future wife Priscilla at Bryn Mawr College. Binger himself was a friend of Louis Weiss, brother of Carol Weiss King. King was a member of the International Juridical Association, of which Hiss (and several others in the Ware group had been a member. On August 17, 1948, The New York Times interviewed Binger during a conference on mental health and reported: > Professor Binger pointed to the \\"bugaboo of communism,\\" which he said was > now spreading a state of \\"neurotic anxiety\\" throughout the United States. > Fanned largely by \\"big business\\" and by vote-getters, this \\"neurosis,\\" > Professor Binger added, has become confused in public minds with the > \\"legitimate fears\\" of Russia and, under such conditions, he asserted, not > only the people of the United States but also its leaders and policymakers > are in danger of losing a rational, objective approach to world problems.\\" In the 1949 Alger Hiss trials, Binger served as a defense witness by analyzing Whittaker Chambers's activities, writings, and behavior during trial but without ever meeting or interviewing him.The Alger Hiss Story In his testimony with Hiss's lead attorney Claude Cross, the following exchange occurred: > CROSS: What is your opinion, Dr. Binger, of the mental condition of Mr. > Chambers? > BINGER: I think Mr. Chambers is suffering from a condition known as > psychopathic personality, which is a disorder of character, of which the > outstanding features are behavior of what we call an amoral or an asocial > and delinquent nature. > CROSS: Will you define for us, Doctor, what you mean by amoral and asocial? > BINGER: I mean that amoral behavior is behavior that does not take account > the ordinary accepted conventions of morality; and asocial behavior is > behavior which has not regard for the good of society and of individuals, > and is therefore frequently destructive of both. > CROSS: Is psychopathic personality a recognized mental disease? > BINGER: It is... > CROSS: Will you tell us, Dr. Binger, what some of the symptoms of a > psychopathic personality are? > BINGER: Well, they are quite variegated. They include chronic, persistent > and repetitive lying; they include stealing; they include acts of deception > and misrepresentations; they include alcoholism and drug addiction; abnormal > sexuality; vagabondage; panhandling; inability to form stable attachments; > and a tendency to make false accusations. In his testimony with Prosecutor Thomas Francis Murphy, the following exchange occurred regarding the Pumpkin Papers: > MURPHY: You say that a man who was living on a farm in 1948, who puts pretty > valuable papers in a pumpkin that he has hollowed out right by his door, is > bizarre? > BINGER: I say the act is bizarre. > MURPHY: The act is bizarre? > BINGER: Because it is unusual. Perhaps there is one other example in > history that you have given. > MURPHY: If, Doctor, you assume that these microfilms were previously in his > house and he moved them from room to room, and that the day that he put them > in the pumpkin was the day that he was going to leave his farm, and assume > further that there were different people in and about the farm looking for > things, wouldn't you say, Doctor, that that was a pretty good hiding place? > BINGER: It was. > MURPHY: No matter how bizarre it was? > BINGER: It certainly was a good hiding place, yes. > MURPHY: All right. As a matter of fact, don't you remember reading, Doctor, > that when Benedict Arnold sold out West Point and gave the plans to Major > André, do you know where he put the plans when he was caught, just up here > by Tarrytown? > BINGER: No, I don't. > MURPHY: He had them in the boot of his shoe, the sole of his boot. Was that > bizarre on the part of an intelligent British officer? > BINGER: No, I wouldn't say so. > MURPHY: Well, how about the mother of Moses hiding the little child in the > bulrushes? Was that bizarre? > BINGER: Well, she could hardly put it in a safe deposit vault. > MURPHY: Now, Doctor, you don't tell us that all things that don't fit in > safe deposit boxes are therefore bizarre, do you? > BINGER: No, I don't. > MURPHY: I am asking you, Doctor, whether the action of Moses' mother in > putting the young child in the bulrushes was bizarre behavior? > BINGER: I don't know the circumstances and I wouldn't know where else she > had to hide the child. If that was the only place, it certainly was not > bizarre. Summing up Binger's input to the case, John V. Fleming wrote: > The junk literary criticism was handmaid to the junk science introduced into > the first trial by one of Hiss's testimonial experts, the psychiastrist Carl > Binger. He was the one who without ever interviewing Chambers had attributed > to him \\"unconscious motivation\\" and in the second trial assigned him to the > category of \\"psychopathic personality\\"–a category he then cheerfully agreed > was meaningless. Personal and death Binger was one of the oldest friends of American journalist Walter Lippman. Awards, honors In 1959, he was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.

Features  Ilsan Lake Park is divided into two parts by Dal-ma-ji island () which is located in the middle of the lake. The northern part is built around a real natural lake with much of the original plant growth retained. The southern part is an artificial lake with many squares and fountains. There is an octagonal pavilion on Dal-ma-ji island called \\"Wal-pa-jung\\" (). In the middle of the park, there is the Go-sa fountain () which spouts over 10 m high during the daytime in the summer.

The site is surrounded by the Hermon nature reserve. While the nature reserve is open year-round, the ski resort is open only at the peak of winter (usually January–March), when enough snow is accumulated on its ground.\\"Mount Hermon Ski Resort opens a month earlier than usual after this week's heavy snow\\", Omer Rabin's reports on \\"Globes\\", 15 December 2010 It has a top elevation of 2,040 metres (6,690 ft), going down to 1600 metres, with an area covering about 2434 dunams.The Hermon Ski Resort: About, homepage of the resort, accessed 9 August 2019 History The ski lift Alpine soldiers take Palestinian children diagnosed with cancer to visit Mount Hermon Ski resort in August =Biblical era= The Hermon site is linked to Judeo-Christian traditions. In the Bible, it is referred to as Ba'al Hermon, Sion, Sirion and Senir. According to the Gospels, Caesarea Philippi is located at its base, and the mountain is believed by some to be the site of the Transfiguration.The world's strangest ski resorts =Modern era= The first lift was installed in 1971, largely with assistance from the Jewish Agency for Israel, and the resort first opened to skiers in December 1971. The next considerable expansion came in 1981 when the region fell under Golan Heights law, which allowed for easier expansion. Additional lifts were added gradually during the next 20 years. Since 1981, the Golan Heights have been governed under Golan Heights Law, and during this period the resort has expanded considerably. The resort includes a wide range of ski trails for novice, intermediate, and expert levels. It also offers additional winter family activities such as sledding and Nordic skiing. The resort is unusual in not having been built by a town, and there is still no town at the resort, so those who operate the Hermon Ski area live in the nearby Moshav of Neve Ativ and the town of Majdal Shams. The ski resort has a ski school, ski patrol, and several restaurants located at either the bottom or peak of the area. The base of the resort is at , and it peaks at .Snow Forecast: Mount Hermon The resort has 7 red pistes, 3 blue pistes, 2 black pistes and one green piste. The resort also has several facilities for summer visitors. As the highest point in Israeli controlled areas, it is also in a very strategically important position for the IDF because it overlooks Syria and Lebanon. In peak season more than 12,000 people can be on the mountain each day. The resort has also added a snowpark. The resort provides an important source of income to residents of both Neve Ativ and Majdal Shams. In the 2000s the resort started suffering from the effects of global warming, having had previously two to three months of good snow every winter going down to only two to four weeks (In 1999, for the first time in its history, the resort had no sufficient snow at all for skiing). Resort ownership Ownership of the resort is controversial. The resort is operated and held by 32 families of Neve Ativ. The families have no property rights in the land and they have not paid the Israel Land Administration for its use in over a decade. SPNI accused resort operators for charging illegal fees. In 2010 the Movement for Quality Government in Israel appealed to the Supreme Court of Israel against the Israel Land Administration. In the appeal Neve Ativ was accused of holding the area of the resort without any valid contract, violating the public's interest and the Israel Land Administration law. Legal issues =Snow cat accident= In February 2004 a 24-year-old woman was killed and four others were injured in a snowcat accident. The vehicle was not intended for carrying passengers. The driver was arrested and his lawyer claimed that he was only following the orders of his superiors. In 2008 the Nazareth court sentenced the resort manager, Menahem Baruch, along with three other resort workers, to a suspended six-month jail sentence and a 5000 Israeli new shekel penalty payment. The family of the deceased woman complained that the sentence was not severe enough. =Arson of rival business= In 2004 police arrested four senior workers at the resort for allegedly ordering the arson of a competing snow equipment rental business in Majdal Shams. According to allegations the four offered two fellow resort workers a sum of 40 thousand Israeli new shekels each for setting fire to the competing business. Additionally resort workers allegedly harassed visitors who rented equipment from the rival shop.

With close to five hundred published books, he is one of the most prolific authors in the United States, and one of the country's foremost writers of historical works for children and teens. History =Childhood and education= Don Nardo was born in Columbia, Missouri. With his younger brother, Philip (born 1949), Nardo spent the first few years of his life on the road as his parents, who were popular nightclub entertainers that traveled throughout the country. In the early 1950s, the family settled in Natick, Massachusetts, where Nardo was at first home-schooled, but he later attended the local public schools. As he grew older, he developed an interest in many of the fields he would later pursue professionally, including acting, music, history, and writing. In high school, he performed in numerous plays and was voted best actor in his senior class. Outside of school, he learned to play the trumpet and began composing chamber and orchestral music, including a four-movement symphony at age fourteen. However, having little formal musical training, he was initially unable to notate these pieces properly, so in the next few years he taught himself to do so by studying books on orchestration. After graduating from high school in 1965, Nardo majored in theater at Syracuse University, but left after a few semesters to pursue an acting career in New York City. Later, in the 1970s, he returned to school, graduating magna cum laude with a degree in history from Worcester State College (now Worcester State University). =Early professional work= As a young character actor, Nardo appeared in numerous stage productions, including work in summer stock in upstate New York and dinner theater in the American South. He also worked with the National Shakespeare Company under producer-director Philip Meister, including productions of Macbeth, Othello, and As You Like It. Later, Nardo's theatrical interests shifted more to writing screenplays and teleplays. While working on his first few scripts, he taught high school social studies and English in Barnstable, Massachusetts. One of these screenplays, The Bet, won a $5,000 award from the Massachusetts Artists Foundation in 1982. Among the teleplays was an episode of ABC’s Spenser: For Hire, starring Robert Urich. Titled \\"Skeletons in the Closet,\\" it guest starred E.G. Marshall and Boyd Gaines. Nardo also co-wrote, produced and directed a low-budget feature film, In Deadly Heat, which was distributed as Stuff Stephanie in the Incinerator by Troma Entertainment and released to the video market in 1990 by Media Home Entertainment. =Writing career= Although Nardo had avidly studied history informally since childhood and had acquired a degree in history in the 1970s, he did not begin writing history books until the 1980s. A chance assignment by a Boston-based publisher to write several chapters of a new high-school-level history textbook led to offers from several young adult publishers. In the years that followed, the offers kept coming, as did positive reviews from School Library Journal, Booklist, and other noted journals. He joined the Association of Ancient Historians in the 1990s. And by 2004, he had penned more than a hundred books about the Greeks, Romans, Egyptians, Assyrians, Babylonians, Persians, and other ancient peoples. In that same year, noted classical historian Victor Davis Hanson stated online: “There is an entire series of great children’s books [about ancient history] by Don Nardo, who has emerged as the premier practitioner of that important craft.\\"Victor Davis Hanson's Private Papers, August 2004. Retrieved 2009-06-06 At the request of Chelsea House, Scholastic, Lucent Books, Compass Point Books, Morgan Reynolds, and other publishers, Nardo also wrote numerous books about medieval civilization, among them a biography of the eccentric Danish astronomer Tycho Brahe that won a special commendation by the National Science Teachers Association. In addition, he fulfilled numerous requests to write books about modern history, including several studies of Native American culture, America's wars, and the U.S. founders and their writings. His 2012 book Migrant Mother was nominated for numerous best book of the year awards and won the Spur Award for Best Western Juvenile Nonfiction,as well as citations from the Bank Street Children's Book Committee, the Midwest Independent Publishers Association, and the Pennsylvania School Librarians Association. Another 2012 volume, Destined for Space, won an award from the American Astronautical Society. Moreover, in September 2014, for the first time Nardo briefly switched his focus from nonfiction to fiction by publishing his first novel, titled Cloak of Destiny. He calls it a \\"cosmic mystery.\\" One of its main story lines, he says, deals with a modern archaeologist who \\"has discovered an astonishing secret in the deserts of Israel, revealing some startling previously unknown truths about humankind’s place in the universe.\\" That excavator has \\"no doubt in his mind\\" that when the public finds out about these mind-bending discoveries, \\"the world as people now know it will change forever.\\" =Music= Meanwhile, Nardo continued to compose music, including three more symphonies; concertos for violin, cello, piano, clarinet, French horn, and trumpet; a double concerto for violin, cello, and orchestra; a piano trio; a piano sonata; four string quartets; a musical tribute to Thomas Jefferson; incidental music for stage plays, including a large-scale school production of The Hobbit, for which he also conducted the pit orchestra; several romances arranged for strings or orchestra; an oratorio based on the King Arthur legends, and other works. In 1987 the Cape Cod Symphony Orchestra, conducted by Royston Nash, commissioned him to compose a concert piece for children based on H.G. Wells's The War of the Worlds. A more recent commission came in 2008 from Portuguese-American violinist Pedro Ferreira — a double concerto for violin and Portuguese guitar, the first major concert piece ever written for the latter instrument. Between 2008 and 2010, Nardo was the resident composer and arranger for Ferreira’s Connecticut-based Amadis Orchestra. Another commission from the Cape Cod Symphony, now under conductor Jung-Ho Pak, came in 2011, part of the orchestra's 50th anniversary celebration. Titled Cape Cod Impressions, the large-scale orchestral piece was accompanied by photos of the Cape projected onto huge screens and received standing ovations at all performances. In 2013, Nardo completed another commission from Peter Ferreira, this time a set of more than a dozen orchestral arrangements of popular songs for a special pops concert in which Ferreira performed with Connecticut's Cheshire Symphony Orchestra, conducted by Richard Brooks.Harugari German Club \\"Cheshire Symphony Orchestra with Peter Ferreira Ensemble\\" , Newstimes.com, 14 June 2013. Personal life Nardo has been married twice. The first union produced a son, Dana (born 1972), who became a graphic artist and animator. Nardo and his second wife, Christine, are avid animal lovers who have a particular fondness for dogs and presently share their home in Massachusetts with a yellow lab named Daisy. They also enjoy traveling and have made frequent trips to Greece and other countries that Nardo frequently writes about. Selected works *Krakatoa. Lucent Books, 1990. *Gravity: The Universal Force.

From 1963–66, he held senior position in the Home ministry, Government of India, as Officer on Special Duty for the welfare of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled tribes, which gave him opportunity to travel extensively all over India. His experiences during these travels gave enough material for his literary incursion in the form of travelogues. In 1967, he was appointed as the Chairman of Backward class reservation commission by the Left Democratic Front Government headed by E M S Namboodiripad. He served as chairman until the report was finalised in 1970.

Early years and the freedom struggle Damodaran was born to K. P. Kunhikannan and Smt. Thalu in a small hamlet called Nettur in the present day Tellicherry municipality. He did his early schooling from Mannayad school and Middle school, Illicoon in Nettur which was established by the legendary visionary and philanthropist Hermann Gundert. He later on attended Basel Evangelical Mission Parsi High School (BEMP), Tellicherry and Brennen College respectively. After graduating in Physics from Madras Christian College, he joined the Indian freedom movement from the Malabar region. He played a pivotal role in the Quit India Movement during 1942 from Tellicherry, organising rallies and public events to that effect, often giving the police a slip. During one such event, he was arrested by the authorities. This created an uproar in Tellicherry already reeling in high national spirits. He was tried and sentenced to two years in prison. He was held as a political détenu in Alipur Central jail, Bellary from 1942–44. After finishing his jail-term, he resumed his fight for India's freedom till Independence was achieved in the year 1947. Damodaran's political life gave way to administrative career for a short spell, when he was unexpectedly chosen by Andhra Kesari T. Prakasam, then Chief Minister of Madras State, as one of the first two 'Firka' (now known as Block) development officers as part of an all India experimentation on Firka development model.Damodaran's Biodata on Lok Sabha Portal He resigned from his official position in 1952 to embark on Parliamentary career by contesting the first general election of independent India from Tellicherry constituency, and winning with a thumping majority. During his tenure in the Lok Sabha (1956), he was part of a Parliamentary delegation to China when Prime Minister Zhou Enlai was in power.  Literary works  Damodaran traveled extensively within India and wrote travelogues describing the local culture, people and practices. Some of his published works include: *Narmadayude Nattil (In the land of Narmada) – a travelogue covering the course of the Narmada river. *Adivasikalute Keralam (The Tribals of Kerala) – an authoritative work on the Tribals of Kerala *Anubhavachurulukal (Reels of experience: Publisher: DC Books, Kottayam; 1987DC books – Publisher of 1st Edition (Author name spelt as 'Damodaran Nettoor')) – Autobiographical sketches encompassing the freedom struggle and early years of freedomBooks authored by Shri Nettur P Damodaran as listed on Americanpoems.com Anubhavachurulukal was republished in 2007 by Samayam Publications, Kannur.  Social reform  Damodaran worked towards the uplift of socially and economically backward classes of Kerala. He was chairman of what came to be known as the Nettur Commission, formed by the government of Kerala to assess comprehensively the conditions that define backwardness of social classes in Kerala. A report of the commission's findings was submitted to the government which was subsequently published in 1971.Backward Class Commission report ('Nettur Commission') published by Govt. of Kerala, 1971 listed on openlibrary.org  Liberation of Mahé  Even after India attained independence from Britain, France continued to hold onto Puducherry, Mahé, Yanam, Karaikal and Chandannagar. Damodaran played a role in expediting Mahé's liberation from French rule by working in concert with Mahé liberation leaders such as I. K. Kumaran and C.E. Bharathan, and highlighting the various issues related to the struggle in parliament. Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru personally saw to it that the concerns raised by Damodaran and the remedies put forward by him in Parliament were addressed appropriately, helping realising the liberation of Mahe in a bloodless manner. He was actively involved in shaping and giving political lead in the formative years of independent Mahé.  Cultural activism  Damodaran liked art and took various steps to popularise and promote local art forms of the Malabar region. This primarily included Kalari Payattu, an ancient martial art; Theyyam, a form of dance; and Thira, a religious ritual of northern Kerala. He was instrumental in organising various Kalari performances for the troupe of C .V.N Nair, a kalaripayattu maestro from Thalassery in Northern India and even in Ceylon (Sri Lanka). He was encouraged further by Nehru after witnessing a private performance in New Delhi. Indian circus, of which Tellicherry was the citadel, was another area of his interest and involvement. At the time of his death, he was the Secretary of the Circus Federation of India, New Delhi.

It is found in the southwestern Pacific Ocean. Description The inscribed wrasse is a large species within its genus with the largest males measured at 325mm in standard length, It is said to reach in standard length. The small juvenile fish are greenish with white markings and an eyespot on the soft part of the dorsal fin and another on the anal fin. The females are brown with white markings on their scales that create thin longitudinal stripes. The males are bluish-grey in colour with the body showing an irregular pattern which resembles scribbles and which give rise to the species common and its specific name. The males also have white dorsal and anal fins. Dsitribution The inscribed wrasse is native to eastern Australia including Lord Howe Island and Norfolk Island, the Kermadec Islands, and the northeast coast of the North Island in New Zealand where its range extends from Cape Reinga to East Cape. This is an uncommon species off Australian coasts but is abundant off Lord Howe Island, Norfolk Island and the Kermadecs. Habitat and biology The inscribed wrasses can be found around kelp beds on rocky reefs at depths around . It is carnivorous, feeding on benthic invertebrates mostly molluscs and crustaceans. Like other species in the genus Notolabrus the males of this species formharems within a territory defended by a male, in this species harems average six females or juveniles. Taxonomy The inscribed wrasse was first formally described as Labrus inscriptus in 1848 by the Scottish naturalist John Richardson (1787-1865) with the type locality given as Norfolk Island. This species has been recorded as hybridising with Notolabrus fucicola.

He is best known for his Memoirs of Great Britain and Ireland from the dissolution of the last parliament of Charles II until the sea battle of La Hogue, first published in 1771. A new edition of 1790 carried on to the capture of the French and Spanish navies at Vigo. The Dalrymples formed a dynasty among the legal profession in Scotland. Although a central figure in the Scottish Enlightenment and a friend of persons like David Hume and Adam Smith, Dalrymple's writings were rather unappreciated and he has been described as an irritating member of the Edinburgh literati.Oxford Dictionary of National Biography: Sir John Dalrymple 1726–1810 Life Sir John was the son of Sir William Dalrymple of Cranstoun, 3rd Baronet (1704–1771) and a cousin of William Dalrymple-Crichton, 4th Earl of Stair. His mother was Agnes Crawford (died 1755). He was educated at Edinburgh and Cambridge universities, Dalrymple was admitted to the Faculty of Advocates in 1748. He served as Solicitor to the Board of Excise, and as a Baron of the Exchequer (1776–1807). On Thomas Hamilton's death in 1779, Sir John inherited Oxenfoord, and began laying out the gardens. He published his Essays on Different Natural Situations of Gardens in 1774, which became an influential book at the time. In 1783 Dalrymple was a co-founder of the Royal Society of Edinburgh.https://www.royalsoced.org.uk/cms/files/fellows/biographical_index/fells_indexp1.pdf In later life his Edinburgh house was at 15 Buccleuch Place, just south of George Square.Edinburgh and Leith Post Office Directory 1807–8 Sir John Dalrymple died on 26 February 1810. Family In 1760 Dalrymple married his cousin, Elizabeth Hamilton MacGill,Oxford Dictionary of National Biography: Sir John Dalrymple 1726-1810 daughter and heiress of Thomas Hamilton of Fala, who himself had inherited Oxenfoord Castle, property of the Viscounts of Oxfuird. This led him to adopt her name upon her inheritance. They had thirteen children only five of whom still lived at the time of his death. Memoirs of Great Britain and Ireland David Hume, in the course of writing his History of England, requested that Dalrymple search the French state archives.J. P. Kenyon, The History Men. The Historical Profession in England since the Renaissance. Second Edition (Weidenfeld and Nicolson, 1993), p. 55. Dalrymple discovered that the Secret Treaty of Dover did indeed contain a provision that Charles II convert to Roman Catholicism, and that there was a secret agreement between Charles and Louis XIV made in March 1681. He also uncovered \\"King William's Chest\\" at Kensington Palace, which contained the original Invitation to William from the Immortal Seven. When Dalrymple, \\"a devoted Whig\\", saw that he had discovered the original, he was filled with emotion: \\"Immortal Seven! whose memories Britain can never sufficiently revere\\".Kenyon, p. 67. He published this in the first volume of his Memoirs in 1771. However, when he returned to the French archives for the second volume (published in 1773), he found in the French Ambassador's despatches evidence that the legendary Whig martyr Algernon Sidney had accepted money from Louis XIV in 1678 and that William Russell, Lord Russell had negotiated with him. Dalrymple wrote: \\"When I found Lord Russell intriguing with the Court of Versailles, and Algernon Sidney taking money from it, I felt very near the same shock as if I had seen a son turn his back in the day of battle.\\"Kenyon, p. 68. When the first volume of Dalrymple's Memoirs appeared in 1771, Hume criticised it: \\"There is not a new circumstance of the least importance from the beginning to the end of the work.\\"Kenyon, p. 56. He said of the controversy surrounding the revelations on Russell and Sidney: > It is amusing to observe the general, and I may say national rage, excited > by the late discovery of this secret negotiation [with the French Court]; > chiefly on account of Algernon Sidney, whom the blind prejudices of party > had exalted into a hero. His ingratitude and breach of faith in applying for > the King's pardon, and immediately on his return entering into cabals for > rebellion, form a conduct much more criminal than the taking of French gold. > Yet the former circumstance was always known, and always disregarded. But > everything connected with France is supposed in England to be polluted > beyond all possibility of expiation. Even Lord Russell, whose conduct in > this negotiation was only factious, and that in an ordinary degree, is > imagined to be dishonoured by the same > discovery.http://oll.libertyfund.org/?option=com_staticxt&staticfile;=show.php%3Ftitle=652&chapter;=62166&layout;=html&Itemid;=27 In a discussion with James Boswell, Samuel Johnson said of the discoveries on Russell and Sidney: > JOHNSON. \\"Why, Sir, every body who had just notions of government thought > them rascals before. It is well that all mankind now see them to be > rascals.\\" BOSWELL. \\"But, Sir, may not those discoveries be true without > their being rascals?\\" JOHNSON. \\"Consider, Sir; would any of them have been > willing to have had it known that they intrigued with France?

The school was one of the ten similar schools constructed in Greenfield Township, and is one of only two one-room schoolhouses remaining in Erie County that are not heavily altered. The schoolhouse was constructed in 1875, and was originally called Shadduck School. Hornby School stayed in continuous operation as a school until 1956. It was restored and opened as the Hornby School Museum in 1984, and was listed on National Register of Historic Places in 2008.  Design  Hornby School is located on Station Road (Pennsylvania Route 430) in Greenfield Township, a from the intersection of Station and Williams Roads. The school consists of a one-story, frame building long and . Its gable roof shingled with cedar shakes and topped with a belfry. The interior of the school divided into three rooms: the cloakroom, the wood storage room, and the school classroom. The schoolhouse was not built with indoor plumbing; water is supplied from a well and hand pump adjacent to the building. Also on the property is a two-person outhouse; only one stall is operational with the other being used for storage. The original holding pit beneath the outhouse was removed and replaced with a septic tank in 1982.  History  The first school to be established in Greenfield Township was at Colt Station in 1820. Shadduck School was originally a log cabin built in 1850; the building was replaced in 1865 with another log cabin. After the passage of the Free Schools Acts of 1834 by the Pennsylvania General Assembly, state funding allowed Greenfield Township to build ten, frame, one-room schoolhouses that either replaced older schools or established new ones. On December 23, 1873, the Greenfield Township School Board authorized the construction of two new schoolhouses--replacing the older Shadduck School and another schoolhouse. The school board decided on a location for the building on June 12, 1875, and the school was completed by October 27\\\\. Interior of the schoolhouse The school was known as Shadduck School until 1900, when it was changed to reflect the name of the nearest post office, Hornby. The school's belfry was also erected in 1900. Hornby School was closed in 1956 after the township became a part of the Wattsburg Area School District and the Greenfield Elementary School was completed. The property, including the building and its contents, were subsequently auctioned off. The Hornby School Restoration Society was formed and the school, along with a of land, was donated to the organization in 1973; an additional was donated in 1991. Hornby School was reopened on August 26, 1984 and now functions as a museum. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on August 13, 2008. The Hornby School is a working one-room schoolhouse and replicate the operation of the school from the 1870s to the early 1900s. Of the ten constructed in Greenfield Township and the six that survived to the 1940s, it is the only one that was not modified: one is an automotive parts store, three are residential homes, and another burned down in a fire. All of the \\"chalkboards, desks and other teaching implements\\" were original to Hornby School or were from one of the other schoolhouses in the township. The only other one-room schoolhouse in the county is located on the campus of Northwestern High School in Albion.

Retrieved 28 August 2020 Plot Inspector Glebsky arrives at the hotel \\"Dead Mountaineer's\\" because of an anonymous call. This hotel is located in a remote area in a valley, hidden among the mountains in some European country. The very name of the hotel - \\"Dead Mountaineer's\\" can be explained quite simply: one climber died here who fell off a cliff. He left only his faithful dog behind - a St. Bernard called Lel. In the hotel there is a rather bleak portrait of the climber near which faithful Lel likes to sleep. Almost all of the lodgers are rather strange, especially Mr. and Mrs. Moses and Olaf Andvarafors. Later another strange individual materializes; Luarvik, who can not even utter a couple of words. Mr. Moses and Luarvik turn out to be aliens and Mrs. Moses and Olaf are their robots, although they look like ordinary people. And in the mountains they suffer a calamity. After a heavy snowfall, when the hotel is cut off from the outside world, a body appears at one point. Inspector Glebsky initiates an investigation, using all of his standard skills. However the investigation of the pseudo-murder of Olaf comes to a standstill. And when seemingly all intricacies of the plot unravel and the aliens can safely leave the Earth a military helicopter appears. The inspector has a chance to do great service to the aliens, but Glebsky behaves like a typical cop, subordinate only to common sense and official instructions which leads to the tragic outcome. At the end of the film the inspector is plagued by doubts whether he did everything he could. Reception and analysis Eva Näripea and Henriette Cederlöf, in a 2015 article on the film, viewed it as a blend of science fiction and film noir, the latter particularly in its visual aesthetics.Näripea, Eva & Cederlöf, Henriette (2015) \\"Genre and Gender in the Dead Mountaineer's Hotel (1979)\\", Science Fiction Film & Television, Volume 8, Issue 2, ISSN 1754-3770.

Gender identity was also a theme that they identified in the film, commenting on its \\"apparent denial of heteronormativity as the sole accepted coordinate system for sexual identity\\", which \\"parallels its obvious denunciation of oppressive power relations and the attempts by Soviet authorities to combat all kinds of otherness, including of ideological and ethnic origin\\".

Other trainers began to use him on a regular basis and in October 1999, he partnered Zelden to success in the Derrinstown Stud Apprentice Handicap final at the Curragh. Since then he has won numerous listed, group and other major races in Ireland including the Phoenix Stakes, Noblesse Stakes, Greenlands Stakes, Round Tower Stakes, Debutante Stakes, Ulster Derby, the Irish Cesarewich and the McDonagh Handicap at the Galway Festival. In 2011, O'Donoghue rode the Aidan O'Brien trained Treasure Beach in The Derby, finishing second by a head. Mick Kinane described O'Donoghue's performance on the horse as the best ride in the race. He then won the Irish Derby at the Curragh Racecourse on the same horse. This was his second European classic success following victory in the Poule d'Essai des Poulains, which he won on Astronomer Royal in 2007. Two months later, in August 2011, he won the Shergar Cup at Ascot as a member of the victorious Irish Jockeys' team, winning the 12 furlong Shergar Cup Classic race on Parlour Games, his first ride for Godolphin. In November he was nominated for an Outstanding Achievement Award by Horse Racing Ireland. In January 2012, he was invited to represent Ireland in the Meydan Masters International jockeys challenge in Dubai and in March won the UAE Derby on Daddy Long Legs at the Dubai Carnival meeting. O'Donoghue has ridden for many leading trainers and owners including Aidan O'Brien, Jessica Harrington, Jim Bolger, Dermot Weld and John Oxx in Ireland, Bobby Frankel, Neil Drysdale, Bob Baffert and Todd Pletcher in the US, Lee Freedman in Australia, Dr MAM Ramaswamy, Subaiah Ganapathy and Vijay Mallya in India and Katsuhiko Sumii in Japan. He also won the inaugural running of the American St. Leger at the Arlington Million meeting at Arlington Park in Arlington Heights, Illinois, in August 2012. O'Donoghue won the race on Jakkalberry for the Newmarket based trainer, Marco Botti. From 2016, he replaced Fran Berry (who had moved to England) as first jockey on the flat for dual-purpose trainer Jessica Harrington, initially mixing that role with his Ballydoyle position. He rode his first Royal Ascot winner, Sword fighter, for Aidan O'Brien in the Queen's Vase in 2016. In 2018, he rode the Harrington- trained Alpha Centauri to win four Group One races, including one at Royal Ascot. O'Donoghue also established a relationship with Godolphin, riding for trainer Charlie Appleby at all eight Dubai World Cup Carnival meetings in 2019. In February 2019, it was announced that Shane Foley would replace O'Donoghue as the Harrington stable jockey. By the following month, it had been announced that O'Donoghue would be used by the new training partnership of John Oxx and Patrick Prendergast.

It is close to the modern day town of Vau i Dejës.  History  In period 1081—1116 Dagnum belonged to the kingdom of Duklja. The Ragusan-Serbian peace treaty was signed in Danj on 25 March 1326, attended by vojvoda (Slavic count) Mladen and čelnik Đuraš Ilijić. Until 1395 Sati (whose castellan was Koja Zaharia) and Dagnum belonged to a fief of Kostadin Balšić and was part of the Lordship of Zeta under Đurađ II Balšić. In 1395 Balšić ceded Sati (with Dagnum) together with Scutari and Drivast to Venetian Republic (in order to create a buffer zone between remaining part of his Zeta and Ottoman Empire), but Zaharia refused to allow Venetians to take control over the Sati. He proclaimed himself the Lord of Sati and Dagnum (\\"dominus Sabatensis et Dagnensis\\") after he captured Dagnum in 1396 which became the seat of his domain. In 1429 Stefan Maramonte, supported by Ottomans and forces of Gojčin Crnojević and Little Tanush, plundered the region around Scutari and Ulcinj and attacked Drivast in 1429, but failed to capture it. While Venetian forces were busy fighting to repel this attack, the Ottoman forces captured Dagnum and territory of Dukagjini and entrusted it to be governed by Ottoman voivode Ismail. After receiving incorrect information about the death of the Ottoman Sultan, Murad II, Gjergj Arianiti raised a large rebellion against the Ottomans in 1432. Nicholas Dukagjini, however, took advantage of this rebellion and conquered his family's former lands, accepting Venetian suzerainty. He yielded Dagnum to Venice. Venice soon learned that Sultan Murad was actually alive. Fearing that Venice would be provoking the Ottomans, they broke all relations with Dukagjini, and transferred Dagnum to Turkish hands by 1435. Members of the Albanian League of Lezhë, Nikollë Dukagjini and Lekë Zaharia, lord of Dagnum, were in dispute over who should marry Irene Dushmani, the only child of Lekë Dushmani, prince of Zadrima. The Albanian princes were invited to the wedding of Skanderbeg's younger sister, Mamica, who was to wed Muzaka Thopia in 1445. Irene entered and hostilities soon began. Dukagjini asked Irene to marry him, but a drunken Zaharia saw this and assaulted Dukagjini. Some of the nobles attempted to end the fight, but this only led to more people being involved and resulted in many deaths until peace was established. Neither of the two antagonists had suffered any physical damage, but Dukagjini was morally humiliated. In an act of revenge, Dukagjini ambushed and killed Zaharia in 1447. This resulted in the town's hostility towards the Albanian League. Venice quickly sent a force into Dagnum and the local population gave their support to Venice, including Zaharia's mother. Venice then set out to capture the rest of Zaharia's holdings, including Sati, Gladri and Dushmani, with Zaharia's mother's agreement. Skanderbeg had ordered the return of these towns, and Drivast, to Albanian hands, however, Venice refused. The Albanian League sent envoys to their northern neighbors, Principality of Zeta (under Stefan Crnojević) and the Despotate of Serbia (under Đurađ Branković) to aid the League against their Venetian enemies. Branković expressed his willingness to help against Venice, however, made it clear he would not aid against their common Ottoman enemies. Skanderbeg ordered the invasion of Dagnum in 1447. The Venetians, however, saw this city as important, more important in fact than their anti-Ottoman war. Venice offered an award to anyone who could assassinate Skanderbeg. Venice even sent out envoys to the Ottomans to attack Albania once more. Skanderbeg, however, heard that Venice sent out a force to protect Dagnum. He then left a small force to continue the siege on the city. In the meantime, Skanderbeg marched from the town to meet the Venetian army at the Drin River. What would be known as the Battle of the Drin in 1448, the League of Lezhë defeated the Venetians. Venetian presence was reduced to small garrisons within several walled cities, including Dagnum. The Venetians opened up negotiations for peace with the Albanians in Alessio and peace was signed between the various representatives of both parties on 4 October 1448. The signatories agreed that Venice would pay 1,400 ducats a year to Skanderbeg and his male heirs and that Dagnum and all lands surrounding it would be relinquished to Venice. Lekë Dukagjini fought the Venetians over the control of Dagnum since 1456. In 1456, Dukagjini captured the city, but Venice retook the city by August 1457. Venetian forces led by Andrea Venier were supported by Skanderbeg. Dukagjini finally made peace with Venice in 1459. In 1474, the Ottoman Turks directed an attack against Crnojević Zeta and Venetian Zeta (around Lake Scutari). This war directly led to Ottoman conquest of the city from Venetian hands. The Ottomans had no intentions of retaining the city, but were content to demolish its fortifications.

While the design of the current mosque dates from the early 19th century during the Alaouite period, the same site has been occupied by a succession of religious buildings since Antiquity.  History  The minaret. The site of the mosque is believed to have originally been the site of a Roman temple dedicated to Hercules and of a 5th-century Roman church. A grand mosque (Friday mosque) was established on this site during the Marinid dynasty (13th-15th centuries). Tangier was frequently besieged by European forces in the 15th century until it was finally conquered by the Portuguese in 1471. The Portuguese immediately converted the mosque or rebuilt the site into a cathedral. In 1662 Tangier was passed to the English as part of Catherine of Braganza's dowry to Charles II. After years under pressure from local Muslim mujahidin attacks, the English evacuated Tangier in 1684, blowing up its fortifications before leaving. The sultan of Morocco at the time, Moulay Ismail from the Alaouite dynasty, immediately claimed the city and supported its Muslim resettlement (including by many of the mujahidin who had fought against the European presence). The Muslim settlers immediately sought to pray in the cathedral which had formerly been the grand mosque. Moulay Ismail ordered the new governor, Ali ibn Abdallah Errifi, to convert the building to a mosque. The new mosque, however, was reportedly very crude, despite being an important symbol of the city's return to Muslim rule. Muslim travelers commented on its poor amenities. The Alaouite Sultan Moulay Slimane was reportedly so shocked by its condition upon seeing it in 1815 that he immediately ordered that it be completely rebuilt. Artisans from outside Tangier were recruited to help with the task, and the reconstruction was completed in 1817-18. The mosque's current form dates essentially from this construction. Subsequent Alaouite sultans continued to embellish or restore the mosque, reinforcing its role as a symbol of the government's importance in upholding religious orthodoxy in the face of other popular forms of religion focused around Sufi marabouts. Along with the khutba, the weekly Friday sermon, important official announcements were also delivered here. The mosque was also a focus of civic life and urban infrastructure. It was located near the Inner Market (formerly the Roman Forum), following a pattern found in other Moroccan and Islamic cities where the most important or prestigious commercial activities took place near the city's main mosque. Across the street on the southwest side of the mosque was the house of the qadi, or judge, where legal cases were heard and resolved. Next to this was the house of the muwaqqit, the timekeeper of the mosque (i.e. responsible for accurately determining the time of prayers), which was connected to the mosque itself by an overhead passage between the house and the minaret. Further south on the same street was a cistern, a maristan or hospital dedicated to caring for the mentally ill, and a house for washing the bodies of the dead (especially for foreigners who died far from home, given Tangier's role as a port). On the mosque's northwestern side, across the street from its main entrance, was a madrasa (school) built in the 18th century under sultan Muhammad ibn 'Abdallah. Attached directly to the mosque itself, behind its southeastern wall (the qibla wall), was a library and a funeral mosque (jama' al-gna'iz, where funerary rites where performed before the body's burial). Some of these amenities were managed and funded by the habous (or waqf) of the mosque; that is, a charitable trust under which the mosque drew revenues from various sources for its upkeep and the upkeep of its associated establishments. In the decades prior to colonial rule and the establishment of an international (European) regime governing Tangier (between 1924 and 1956), the mosque's civic importance declined and the fiscal assets of its habous were increasingly confiscated or diverted by the government. Under colonial rule all habous establishments were further curtailed and lost their role as agents of urban development. Like in many other North African cities, a Ville Nouvelle (\\"New City\\") was established outside the old city walls and rapidly outgrew it, thus reducing the status of the old medina (walled city) to a relatively undesirable and decaying neighbourhood, along with its main mosque. Mohammed V visited the mosque on April 11, 1947, going on to make a historic speech at Mendoubia Gardens. King Hassan II ordered an extension to the mosque in 1962, expanding it on its southwest side. The mosque was restored again in 2001 by order of Mohammed VI.  Architecture  left The late 19th-century street fountain across from the mosque's main entrance (photo from 2014). The mosque today is located on Rue de la Marine, just below the Petit Socco and above the sea walls of the medina. Opposite the mosque is a primary school, established by nationalists during the French protectorate. Many of the old annexes to the mosque are now gone or no longer serve their original purpose. The mosque itself is still in use, and as such it is closed to non-Muslims (like most mosques in Morocco). Across the street from the mosque is also a public fountain decorated with tile mosaic inside a horseshoe arch with carved stucco outlines. The fountain dates from the late 19th century and was restored in 1918 and 2003. The mosque is distinguished on the outside by its minaret and its entrance portal. The entrance portal is decorated with typical radiating geometric motifs, green colours, and a wooden canopy, mostly still dating from the time of Moulay Slimane. The minaret, at the mosque's western corner, is typical of Alaouite-era minarets, inheriting the traditional form of Moroccan minaret architecture. It has a large square shaft crowned by merlons and topped by a smaller, secondary shaft at its summit. Its facades are decorated with more geometric motifs and blind arches outlined in white stucco. In the negative space between the stucco outlines the surfaces are covered with green tiles or multicoloured tile mosaics. The interior of the mosque features a square courtyard with a central fountain, around which are indoor galleries and the main prayer hall. The galleries and prayer hall, like those of most Moroccan mosques, are interior hypostyle spaces marked by rows of arches. The galleries to the southwest and northeast of the courtyard are two aisles deep, while the gallery to the northwest (on the side of the main entrance) is only one row deep. The main prayer hall, which extends from the courtyard towards the qibla (direction of prayer) and the mihrab (niche symbolizing the direction of prayer), is three aisles deep. Behind the mihrab wall at the far end are a few rooms that were historically used, or are still used, as a library, imam's chamber, and funeral mosque (for conducting funerary rites before the burial of a body), all accessed from within the mosque. A newer extension to the mosque, likely from 1962, appears to extend from this main historic building towards the southwest.

The current constitution, which came into force on 6 January 1986, replaced the Liberian Constitution of 1847, which had been in force since the independence of Liberia. Much like the 1847 Constitution, the Constitution creates a system of government heavily modeled on the Federal Government of the United States. The first article of the Constitution and Laws of the Commonwealth of Liberia from 1843 was promulgated by the Legislative Council of the Commonwealth of Liberia in Monrovia and contains an abstract of the legal principles and rules. Drafting process Following the overthrow and execution of President William Tolbert by a small group of soldiers led by Samuel Doe on April 12, 1980, the 1847 Constitution was suspended and governing power was assumed by the People's Redemption Council led by Doe. Doe refused to assume the presidency, instead ruling by decree as the Chairman of the PRC. On April 12, 1981, Amos Sawyer, a political science professor at the University of Liberia, was appointed Chairman of the National Constitution Committee, a 25-member body tasked with drafting a new constitution. In December 1982, the Committee finished their draft constitution, and submitted it to the People's Redemption Council in March 1983. The PRC appointed a 59-member Constitutional Advisory Committee to review the draft. On October 19, 1983, the CAA finished its review, having removed or altered several provisions. Among the changes made to the draft included an increase of presidential terms from four to six years, removal of an entrenchment provision that would have prevented amendments altering presidential term lengths and term limits, removal of a prohibition on government participation by military personnel, and deletion of provisions establishing two autonomous agencies charged with approving judicial candidates and investigating corruption. On July 3, 1984, the revised Constitution was submitted to a national referendum, where it was approved by 78.3% of voters. Following the 1985 general election, the new Constitution came into effect on January 6, 1986 with the inauguration of Doe and the newly elected Legislature of Liberia. Constitutional institutions =Presidency= The executive power of the state is vested in the President of Liberia, who is entrusted to faithfully execute the laws of the country. Among the changes made to the presidency from the previous constitution include the introduction of term limits, prohibiting the President from serving more than two terms, and the reduction of presidential terms from eight years to six. Additionally, the Constitution also requires that candidates for the presidency must own at least $25,000 in real property, an increase in the original $600 requirement in the 1847 Constitution. Furthermore, the President is immune from civil suits arising from actions taken during their tenure in office and arrest on criminal charges while in office, though the President may be prosecuted for criminal acts committed while in office upon vacating the presidency. The Constitution also includes new provisions allowing for the presidential appointment of a new Vice President, with the consent of both houses of the Legislature, in the event of the vacancy of the office. Furthermore, the Constitution provides that in the event of the assumption of the presidency by the Vice President in the event of the President's death, resignation, incapacity or removal, the Vice President will be not considered to have served a term in office for the purpose of term limits. =Legislature= The Constitution grants legislative power to the Legislature of Liberia. Few changes were made to the Legislature from the 1847 Constitution, which largely modeled the Liberian Congress on the United States Congress. However, due to the unitary nature of Liberia, the Legislature is not restricted in its power to make laws, so long as those laws do not violate any provision of the Constitution. =Judiciary= The Constitution largely follows the model set by Article IV of the 1847 Constitution, vesting judicial powers in the Supreme Court of Liberia and any subordinate courts created by the Legislature. However, the Constitution places previously absent requirements on judicial appointees, requiring Supreme Court justices to have been counselors of the Supreme Court Bar for at least five years and requiring all other judges to have been either practicing attorneys for three years or a member of the Supreme Court Bar. =Autonomous agencies= Article 89 of the Constitution mandates the establishment of three independent agencies: * Civil Service Commission * National Election Commission * General Auditing Commission Additional provisions While the 1847 Constitution had provided for political rights similar to those expressed in the United States Bill of Rights, the current constitution expands these rights to include a variety of economic and social rights. For instance, Article 6 provides for equal access to education, while Article 5 protects traditional Liberian culture. Article 8 establishes workers' rights by prohibiting inhumane or dangerous working conditions, and Article 18 prohibits employment discrimination on the basis of gender, religion or ethnicity, as well as guaranteeing equal pay. Additionally, Article 14 explicitly invokes the separation of church and state and the prohibition of a state religion. Article 27(b) of the Constitution retains the controversial nationality requirements of Article V, Section 13 of the 1847 Constitution, which limits citizenship to \\"persons who are Negroes or of Negro descent.\\" Article 95(a) of the Constitution officially repeals the 1847 Constitution, while certifying that all laws enacted before the repeal remain in effect. Article 95(a), (b) and (c) also certifies the validity of all statutes, treaties, international agreements and financial obligations enacted by the People's Redemption Council. Additionally, Article 97 prohibits any court from questioning the validity of actions taken by the PRC or bringing charges against any PRC member for the overthrow of the Tolbert administration, the repeal of the 1847 Constitution, the establishment of the PRC, the imposition of criminal penalties or the confiscation of property by the PRC during their term in power or the establishment of the new constitution. Amendment process Per Article 91, constitutional amendments may be proposed by either a two-thirds vote of both houses of the Legislature, or by a petition signed by at least 10,000 registered voters and approved by a two-thirds vote in the Legislature. A proposed amendment must be ratified by two-thirds of voters in a popular referendum held no sooner than one year after its approval by the Legislature. Article 93 affirms that while the term limitations set forth in Article 50 may be amended, the term limitations of the President in office at the time of ratification of such an amendment remain in place. 2011 amendment referendum Constitution of Liberia On 17 August 2010, the Legislature passed four amendments to the Constitution. The four amendments proposed would have: * Decreased the residency requirement for presidential and vice presidential candidates in Article 52 from ten to five years; * Increased the mandated retirement of judges from 70 to 75; * Changed the date of national elections set in Article 83 from the second Tuesday in October to the second Tuesday in November; * Allowed House and Senate elections to use first-past-the-post voting, while retaining the two-round system for presidential elections. In a referendum held on 23 August 2011, all four amendments failed to garner the required two-thirds majority for approval.

It is the fourth of a series of semi-autobiographical films in which Skolimowski himself plays his alter ego, Andrzej Leszczyc.Jerzy Skolimowski, booklet published by Wydawnictwo Telewizji Kino Polske to accompany DVD release, 2009 (in Polish) At the time it was banned in Poland, under the Communist regime, for 18 years because it depicted the Stalinist past. The film was originally made in 1967 in monochrome by :pl:Zespół Filmowy Syrena studio. In a twenty-minute section (filmed in colour) added by Skolimowski in 1981 he explains how the original was withheld by Polish censors of the time, and that this was a principal cause of his leaving his country; however following liberalisation in Poland, he was invited to resuscitate it. The introduction includes, apart from some fictional apocalyptic passages, shots of Beirut ruined by the civil wars of the 1970s, where Skolimowski is working as an actor on Volker Schlöndorff's German film Die Fälschung (Circle of Deceit), and also shots of London featuring demonstrations in favour of Solidarnosc, Speaker's Corner, and an exhibition of Skolimowski's own paintings. These sections include cameo roles by Bruno Ganz, David Essex, Mike Sarne and others. Some of the music in this introduction is from the 1970 choral work Kosmogonia by the Polish composer Krzysztof Penderecki. The original film is a surrealistic reunion of Leszczyc (who has apparently become a veterinary surgeon) and some of his student colleagues. They refer to themselves by the makes of the cars they own - Leszczyc owns a Zastawa, one owns a Wartburg, the others own more upmarket models such as an Opel Rekord or the Alfa Romeo owned by the unhappily married couple. Supposedly taking speed (although it is later revealed the pills are a placebo), and carousing in the cattle truck of a freight train, the group offers various satirical sidelights on Polish society of the 1960s. The characters also reflect that the truck may have been one of those in which the former generation were transported during World War II to the Nazi death camps. The final credits show the actors as they are in 1981, with the exception of Bogumił Kobiela, who died in 1969. The film was screened out of competition at the 1981 Cannes Film Festival.

Two Cambria County school districts participated in the study. The pilot program had 104 K-12 entities, including: nine career and technical centers, nine charter schools and nine intermediate units. Beginning in January 2012, participating school districts used the new evaluation method and provide feedback to the Department of Education. This new evaluation was not used to determine an educator's official 2011-12 assessment.

The other half is based on student achievement (15 percent will be building-level data, 15 percent will be teacher-specific data, and 20 percent will be elective). The new evaluation system has both announced and unannounced observations.

Among Pennsylvania high school graduates pursuing an associate degree, only one in three graduate in three years.National Center for Education Statistics Per the Pennsylvania Department of Education, one in three recent high school graduates who attend Pennsylvania's public universities and community colleges takes at least one remedial course in math, reading or English. Dual enrollment Blacklick Valley Junior Senior High School offers a dual enrollment program. This state program permits high school students to take courses, at local higher education institutions, to earn college credits. Students remain enrolled at their high school. The courses count towards high school graduation requirements and towards earning a college degree. Courses are available through IU8 and from Mount Aloysius College. The students continue to have full access to activities and programs at their high school. The college credits are offered at a deeply discounted rate. The state offered a small grant to assist students in costs for tuition, fees and books.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Dual Enrollment Guidelines, 2010 Under the Pennsylvania Transfer and Articulation Agreement, many Pennsylvania colleges and universities accept these credits for students who transfer to their institutions. Under state rules, other students that reside in the district, who attend a private school, a charter school or are home schooled are eligible to participate in this program. In 2010, Governor Edward Rendell eliminated the grants to students, from the Commonwealth, due to a state budget crisis. In 2013, funding was available through Pennsylvania's Educational Improvement Tax Credit (EITC) Program. For the 2009-10 funding year, the school district received a state grant of $2,354 for the program. Graduation requirements Among Pennsylvania's 500 public school districts, graduation requirements widely vary. The Blacklick Valley School Board has determined that a pupil must earn 23 credits to graduate, including: a required class every year in Language Arts and social studies, Math 3 credits, science 3 credits, Physical Education 1credit each school year and electives 8 electives. By law, all Pennsylvania secondary school students were required to complete a project as a part of their eligibility to graduate from high school. The type of project, its rigor and its expectations are set by the individual school district. Effective with the graduating class of 2017, the Pennsylvania State Board of Education eliminated the state mandate that students complete a culminating project in order to graduate.Pennsylvania State Board of Education, Proposed changes to Chapter 4, May 10, 2012 By Pennsylvania School Board regulations, beginning with the class of 2017, public school students must demonstrate successful completion of secondary level course work in Algebra I, Biology, and English Literature by passing the Keystone Exams. The exam is given at the end of the course. Keystone Exams replace the PSSAs for 11th grade. Students have several opportunities to pass the exam. Schools are mandated to provide targeted assistance to help the student be successful. Those who do not pass after several attempts can perform a project in order to graduate. For the class of 2019, a Composition exam will be added. For the class of 2020, passing a civics and government exam will be added to the graduation requirements.Pennsylvania Department of Education, State Board of Education Finalizes Adoption of Pennsylvania Common Core State Academic Standards and High School Graduation Requirements, March 14, 2013 In 2011, Pennsylvania high school students field tested the Algebra 1, Biology and English Literature exams.

In December 2010, the district administration reported that 122 pupils or 17.6% of the district's pupils received Special Education services, with 45% of the identified students having a specific learning disability. In December 2007, the district administration reported that 128 pupils or 19% of the district's pupils received Special Education services, with 48.4% of the identified students having a specific learning disability. Special education services in the Commonwealth are provided to students from ages three years to 21 years old. In the 2010-2011 school year, the total student enrollment was more than 1.78 million students with approximately 275,000 students eligible for special education services. Among these students 18,959 were identified with mental retardation and 21,245 students with autism.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Testimony Hearing on Special Education Senate Republican Policy Committee, January 2013 The largest group of students are identified as Specific Learning Disabilities 126,026 students (46.9 percent) and Speech or Language Impairments with 43,542 students (16.2 percent). In 2007, Pennsylvania Secretary of Education Gerald Zahorchak testified before the Pennsylvania House Education Committee regarding full day kindergarten. He claimed that districts which offered full day kindergarten would see a significant decrease in special education students due to early identification and early intervention. He asserted the high cost of full day kindergarten would be recouped by Districts in lower special education costs. Blacklick Valley School District has seen little decline in the percentage of special education students it serves, yielding no savings. In order to comply with state and federal Individuals with Disabilities Education Act rules and regulations, the school district engages in identification procedures to ensure that eligible students receive an appropriate educational program consisting of special education and related services, individualized to meet student needs. At no cost to the parents, these services are provided in compliance with state and federal law; and are reasonably calculated to yield meaningful educational benefit and student progress. To identify students who may be eligible for special education services, various screening activities are conducted on an ongoing basis. These screening activities include: review of group-based data (cumulative records, enrollment records, health records, report cards, ability and achievement test scores); hearing, vision, motor, and speech/language screening; and review by the Special Education administration. When screening results suggest that the student may be eligible, the district seeks parental consent to conduct a multidisciplinary evaluation. Parents who suspect their child is eligible may verbally request a multidisciplinary evaluation from a professional employee of the district or contact the district's Special Education Department. The IDEA 2004 requires each school entity to publish a notice to parents, in newspapers or other media, including the student handbook and website regarding the availability of screening and intervention services and how to access them. In 2010, the state of Pennsylvania provided $1,026,815,000 for Special Education services. This funding was in addition to the state's basic education per pupil funding, as well as, all other state and federal funding. The Special Education funding structure is through the federal Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) funds and state appropriations. IDEA funds are appropriated to the state on an annual basis and distributed through intermediate units (IUs) to school districts, while state funds are distributed directly to the districts. Total funds that are received by school districts are calculated through a formula. The Pennsylvania Department of Education oversees four appropriations used to fund students with special needs: Special Education; Approved Private Schools; Pennsylvania Chartered Schools for the Deaf and Blind; and Early Intervention. The Pennsylvania Special Education funding system assumes that 16% of the district's students receive special education services. It also assumes that each student's needs accrue the same level of costs.Browne, Patrick., Senate Education Committee Hearing on Special Education Funding & Accountability testimony, November 1, 2011 Over identification of students, in order to increase state funding, has been an issue in the Commonwealth. Some districts have more than 20% of its students receiving special education services while others have 10% supported through special education.Kintisch, Baruch., Public Hearing: Special Education Funding & Accountability Testimony, Education Law Center, November 11, 2011 The state requires each public school district and charter school to have a three-year special education plan to meet the unique needs of its special education students.Amy Morton, Executive Deputy Secretary, Public Hearing: Special Education Funding & Accountability Testimony, Pennsylvania Department of Education, November 11, 2011 In 2012, the Obama Administration's US Department of Education issued a directive requiring schools include students with disabilities in extracurricular activities, including sports.US Department of Education, U.S. Department of Education Clarifies Schools' Obligation to Provide Equal Opportunity to Students with Disabilities to Participate in Extracurricular Athletics, January 25, 2013 The Blacklick Valley School District received a $510,784 supplement for special education services in 2010. For the 2011–12, 2012–13 and 2013-14 school years, all Pennsylvania public school districts received the same level of funding for special education that they received in 2010-11. This level funding is provided regardless of changes in the number of pupils who need special education services and regardless of the level of services the respective students required. For the 2014-2015 school year, Blacklick Valley School District received an increase to $518,636 from the Commonwealth for special education funding.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Special Education funding report by LEA, July 2014 In 2013, the state's Special Education Funding Reform Commission provided a report on the state of funding for special education in the Commonwealth. Funding for special education programs is borne largely on a local basic at 60%, with the state contributing $1 billion or 30% and the federal government providing 10% of the funding. ;Least Restricted Environment monitoring In 2009, Blacklick Valley School District was identified by the Pennsylvania Department of Education Bureau of Special Education for Least Restrictive Environment monitoring. One hundred ninety six schools districts were selected in 2008-09. The district received an alert letter from the PDE - Bureau of Special Education.Pennsylvania Department of Education, LRE Index Scores and Identification for Monitoring, 2019 School districts were placed in one of three categories: Tier 1, Tier 2 or Tier 3. The Blacklick Valley was placed in Tier 3 due to the number of students spending their day in settings outside of the regular school (lower numbers of students are desirable). The monitoring is a product of the PDE addressing its voluntary settlement in Gaskin V. Pennsylvania which ordered that special education students spend most of their school day (80%) in regular education classrooms with supplementary aids and services to assist funded by the taxpayers. =Gifted education= The District Administration reported that 2 or 0.3% of its students were gifted in 2009. The highest percentage of gifted students reported among all 500 school districts and 100 public charter schools in Pennsylvania was North Allegheny School District with 15.5% of its students identified as gifted. By law, the district must provide mentally gifted programs at all grade levels. The referral process for a gifted evaluation can be initiated by teachers or parents by contacting the student's building principal and requesting an evaluation. All requests must be made in writing. To be eligible for mentally gifted programs in Pennsylvania, a student must have a cognitive ability of at least 130 as measured on a standardized ability test by a certified school psychologist. Other factors that indicate giftedness will also be considered for eligibility. Enrollment Blacklick Valley School District has low enrollment. According to Pennsylvania Department of Education enrollment reports, enrollment at Blacklick Valley is among the lowest of any public school districts in the Commonwealth. There were just 696 students enrolled in K-12 in 2005-06 school year. The enrollment declined to 669 students enrolled in K-12 in 2008–09 school year. In 2014, enrollment was 688 pupils due to adding the preschool program. Enrollment is projected to remain low through 2020. In 2008, the district administrative costs were $899.59 per pupil (top 20% in state for administrative spending). The lowest administrative cost per pupil in Pennsylvania was $398 per pupil.Fenton, Jacob., Pennsylvania School District Data: Will School Consolidation Save Money?, The Morning Call, February 2009 A study of Pennsylvania public school spending, conducted by Standard and Poor's, examined the consolidation of small public school district in Pennsylvania in 2007. The study found that consolidation of the administration with an adjacent school district would achieve substantial administrative cost savings which varied by district. Among several consolidations the study suggested there were four plans for Blacklick Valley School District. It examined combining BVSD with: United School District which would save taxpayers an estimated $2,924,154 a year. A combining with Penns Manor Area School District which was estimated to save taxpayers $1,762,572 a year, with no school closures. Another plan was to combine with Northern Cambria School District which would have saved taxpayers $2,101,677 annually. Finally, they examined consolidating BVSD with Central Cambria School District yielding an annual savings of $2,081,144, without closing any schools. Pennsylvania had 2,361 public school districts in 1959. The state compelled mergers reducing the number to 505 by 1980. Mergers slowed through the 1980s after a 1981 court order desegregated and combined the Edgewood, General Braddock, Swissvale, Churchill and Turtle Creek districts into the Woodland Hills district. According to a 2009 school district administration consolidation proposal by Governor Edward Rendell, the excessive administrative overhead dollars could be redirected to improve lagging academic achievement, to enrich the academic programs or to reduce local property taxes. Consolidation of two central administrations into one would not require the closing of any schools. The Governor's proposal called for the savings to be redirected to improving lagging reading and science achievement, to enriching the academic programs or to reducing residents' property taxes. In March 2011, the Pennsylvania Institute of Certified Public Accountants Fiscal Responsibility Task Force released a report which found that consolidating school district administrations with one neighboring district would save the Commonwealth $1.2 billion without forcing the consolidation of any schools. The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania has one of the highest numbers of school districts in the nation. In Pennsylvania, 80% of the school districts serve student populations under 5,000, and 40% serve less than 2,000. This results in excessive school administration bureaucracy and not enough course diversity.2009–2010 Executive Budget Fast Facts. Pennsylvania Office of the Governor, 2010 In a survey of public school superintendents of small districts, 42% of the 49 respondents stated that they thought consolidation would save money without closing any schools. Budget Pennsylvania public school districts budget and expend funds according to procedures mandated by the General Assembly and the Pennsylvania Department of Education (PDE). An annual operating budget is prepared by school district administrative officials. A uniform form is furnished by the PDE and submitted to the board of school directors for approval prior to the beginning of each fiscal year on July 1. Under Pennsylvania's Taxpayer Relief Act, Act 1 of the Special Session of 2006, all school districts of the first class A, second class, third class and fourth class must adopt a preliminary budget proposal. The proposal must include estimated revenues and expenditures and the proposed tax rates. This proposed budget must be considered by the Board no later than 90 days prior to the date of the election immediately preceding the fiscal year. The preliminary budget proposal must also be printed and made available for public inspection at least 20 days prior to its adoption. The board of school directors may hold a public hearing on the budget, but are not required to do so. The board must give at least 10 days’ public notice of its intent to adopt the final budget according to Act 1 of 2006.Pennsylvania General Assembly, Taxpayer Relief Act, Act 1 of the Special Session of 2006, June 27, 2006 In 2013, the range of teacher salaries at Blacklick Valley School District was $29,000 to $71,350 a year. Teachers also receive a benefits package that includes: health insurance, life insurance, dental insurance, vision insurance, state pension, personal days, 10 paid sick days, paid professional development and more.Blacklick Valley School Board, Blacklick Valley Teachers Union Contract, 2014 Blacklick Valley School District teacher and administrator retirement benefits are equal to at least 2.00% x Final Average Salary x Total Credited Service. (Some teachers benefits utilize a 2.50% benefit factor.) After 40 years of service, a teacher can retire with 100% of the average salary of their final 3 years of employment. According to a study conducted at the American Enterprise Institute, in 2011, public school teachers’ total compensation is roughly 50 percent higher than they would likely receive in the private sector. The study found that the most generous benefits that teachers receive are not accounted for in many studies of compensation including: pension, retiree health benefits and job security. In 2009, the district reported employing 100 teachers and administrators with a salary range of $29,000 and a top salary of $97,000. The teacher's work day was 6.5 hours with 180 days in the contract year. Additionally, the teachers received a defined benefit pension, health insurance, professional development reimbursement, paid personal days, 10 paid sick days, and other benefits. ;Administrative spending Blacklick Valley School District administrative costs per pupil in 2008 was $899.59 per pupil ranking 106th out of 500 public school districts for spending on administration.

The undesignated funds are not committed to any planned project. Designated funds and any other funds, such as capital reserves, are allocated to specific projects. School districts are required by state law to keep 5 percent of their annual spending in the undesignated reserve funds to preserve bond ratings. According to the Pennsylvania Department of Education, from 2003 to 2010, as a whole, Pennsylvania school districts amassed nearly $3 billion in reserved funds.Murphy, Jan., Pennsylvania's public schools boost reserves, CentreDaily Times, September 22, 2010 In 2005, the total reserve funds held by Pennsylvania public school districts was $1.9 billion. By 2013, reserves held by Pennsylvania public school districts, as a whole, had increased to over $3.8 billion. Audit In July 2013, the Pennsylvania Auditor General conducted a performance audit of the District. The findings were reported to the School Board and the district's administration. The audit cited a Violation of the Retirement Code regarding the employment of the former superintendent. In 2010, the Districts was also audited by the Pennsylvania Auditor General. Tuition Students who live in the district's attendance area may choose to attend one of Pennsylvania's 157 public charter schools. A student living in a neighboring public school district or a foreign exchange student may seek admission to Area School District. For these cases, the Pennsylvania Department of Education sets an annual tuition rate for each school district. It is the amount the public school district pays to a charter school for each resident student that attends the charter and it is the amount a nonresident student's parents must pay to attend the district's schools. The 2013 tuition rates are Elementary School - $7,809.80, High School - $10,352.35. Tax shift referendum In accordance with Act 1, Blacklick Valley School District placed a referendum question on the ballot at the May 15, 2007, primary election seeking voter approval to levy (or increase the rate of) an earned income and net profits tax (“EIT”) or a personal income tax (“PIT”) and use the proceeds to reduce local real estate taxes by a homestead and farmstead exclusion. The referendum was not approved by the voters.Pennsylvania Department of State, Referendum results Blacklick Valley School Districts, May 16, 2007 Blacklick Valley School District is funded by a combination of: a local earned income tax 0.5%, a Local Services Tax - $10, Per Capita Tax - $10, a property tax, a real estate transfer tax 0.5%, coupled with substantial funding from the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and a small amount, generally 10% of its budget from the federal government. Grants can provide an opportunity to supplement school funding without raising local taxes. Interest earnings on accounts also provide nontax income to the District. In the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, pension income and Social Security income are exempted from state personal income tax and local earned income tax, regardless of the level of the individual's personal wealth.

Called Science: It's Elementary, the program was a hands on instruction approach for elementary science classes that develops problem-solving and critical thinking skills.Patricia Vathis Pennsylvania Department of Education, Grants and Subsidies Science: It’s Elementary, 2006 To encourage schools to adopt the program's standards aligned curriculum, the state provided a grant to cover the costs of materials and extensive mandatory teacher training.Pennsylvania Department of Education, 2010-11 Science: It’s Elementary Application Guidelines, July 2010 The district was required to develop a three-year implementation plan for the participating school. The school district administration was required to appoint a district liaison who was paid $3,000 by PDE to serve as the conduit of all information between the district and the Department and its agents along with submitting orders and distributing supplies to implementing teachers. For the 2006-07 state education budget, $10 million was allocated for the program. The grant program was expanded to $14.5 million in the 2008-09 budget. The Science It's Elementary grant was discontinued by Governor Edward G. Rendell in the state's 2011 budget. =Other grants= Blacklick Valley School District did not participate in: PreK Counts - preschool grants; Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection's Environmental Education annual grants; Education Assistance Tutoring Grants; 2012 Striving Readers Comprehensive Literacy grant; 2013 Safe Schools and Resource Officer grants; 2012 and 2013 Pennsylvania Hybrid Learning Grants; Project 720 High School Reform grants (discontinued effective with 2011-12 budget); nor the federal 21st Century Learning grants. =Federal Stimulus grant= The district received an extra $271,000 in American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA) - Federal Stimulus money to be used in specific programs like special education and meeting the academic needs of low-income students. The funding was limited to the 2009-2010 and 2010-2011 school years. Due to the temporary nature of the funding, schools were repeatedly advised by the Pennsylvania Department of Education, the Pennsylvania Senate Education Committee, the Governor and the Pennsylvania School Board Association, to use the funds for one-time expenditures like acquiring equipment, making repairs to buildings, training teachers to provide more effective instruction or purchasing books and software. =Common Cents state initiative= The Blacklick Valley School Board elected to not participate in the Pennsylvania Department of Education Common Cents program. The program called for the state to audit the district, at no cost to local taxpayers, to identify ways the district could save tax dollars. After the review of the information, the district was not required to implement the recommended cost savings changes. =Local Services Tax= Blacklick Valley School Board levies a $10 Local Services tax. All local taxing authorities are required by the Local Tax Enabling Act to exempt disabled veterans and members of the armed forces reserve who are called to active duty at any time during the tax year from any local services tax and to exempt from any local services tax levied at a rate in excess of $10 those persons whose total income and net profits from all sources within the political subdivision is less than $12,000 for the tax year. The Local Tax Enabling Act also authorizes, but does not require, taxing authorities to exempt from per capita, occupation, and earned income taxes and any local services tax levied at a rate of $10 or less per year, any person whose total income from all sources is less than $12,000 per year. =Real estate taxes= Property tax rates in 2014-2015 were set by the school board at 44.7000 mills. A mill is $1 of tax for every $1,000 of a property's assessed value. Irregular property reassessments have become a serious issue in the commonwealth as it creates a significant disparity in taxation within a community and across a region. Property taxes, in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, apply only to real estate - land and buildings. The property tax is not levied on cars, business inventory, or other personal property. Certain types of property are exempt from property taxes, including: places of worship, places of burial, private social clubs, charitable and educational institutions and all government property (local, state and federal). Additionally, service related, disabled US military veterans may seek an exemption from paying property taxes. Pennsylvania school district revenues are dominated by two main sources: 1) Property tax collections, which account for the vast majority (between 75-85%) of local revenues; and 2) Act 511 tax collections, which are around 15% of revenues for school districts. When a Pennsylvania public school district includes municipalities in two counties, each of which has different rates of property tax assessment, a state board equalizes the tax rates between the counties. In 2010, miscalculations by the State Tax Equalization Board (STEB) were widespread in the Commonwealth and adversely impacted funding for many school districts, including those that did not cross county borders. *2013-14 - 43.3200 mills. *2012-13 - 37.9600 mills.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Finances_Real Estate Tax Rates 2012-13, 2012 *2011-12 - 37.0000 mills. *2010-11 - 37.0000 mills. *2009-10 - 37.0000 mills.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Financial Elements Reports, 2010 *2008-09 - 37.0000 mills.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Financial Elements Reports 2008-09 Real Estate Mills, 2009 *2007-08 - 37.0000 mills.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Real Estate Tax Millage by School District, 2008 *2006-07 - 37.0000 mills.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Real Estate Tax Millage by School District, 2006 *2005-06 - 37.0000 mills.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Real Estate Tax Millage by School District, 2005 The average yearly property tax paid by Cambria County residents amounts to about 2.4% of their yearly income. Cambria County ranked 1048th out of the 3143 United States counties for property taxes as a percentage of median income.Tax-rates.org., The 2015 Tax Resource County Property Taxes 2014, 2015 According to a report prepared by the Pennsylvania Department of Education, the total real estate taxes collected by all school districts in Pennsylvania rose from $6,474,133,936 in 1999-00 to $10,438,463,356 in 2008-09 and to $11,153,412,490 in 2011.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Pennsylvania School Finances - Summaries of Annual Financial Report Data 2010-11, 2011 Property taxes in Pennsylvania are relatively high on a national scale. According to the Tax Foundation, Pennsylvania ranked 11th in the U.S. in 2008 in terms of property taxes paid as a percentage of home value (1.34%) and 12th in the country in terms of property taxes as a percentage of income (3.55%).New Census Data on Property Taxes on Homeowners, Tax Foundation, September 22, 2009. Pennsylvania's 2011 tax burden of 10.35% ranked 10th highest out of 50 states. The tax burden was above the national average of 9.8%. Pennsylvania's taxpayers paid $4,374 per capita in state and local taxes, including school taxes.Tax Foundation, The facts on Pennsylvania’s Tax Climate, January 2015 Act 1 Adjusted Index The Act 1 of 2006 Index regulates the rates at which each school district can raise property taxes in Pennsylvania. Districts are not permitted to raise property taxes above their annual Act 1 Index unless they either: allow Districts voters to approve the increase through a vote by referendum or they receive an exception from the Pennsylvania Department of Education. The base index for the school year is published by the PDE in the fall of each year. Each individual school district's Act 1 Index can be adjusted higher, depending on a number of factors, such as local property values and the personal income of district residents. Originally, Act 1 of 2006 included 10 exceptions, including: increasing pension costs, increases in special education costs, a catastrophe like a fire or flood, increase in health insurance costs for contracts in effect in 2006 or dwindling tax bases. The base index is the average of the percentage increase in the statewide average weekly wage, as determined by the PA Department of Labor and Industry, for the preceding calendar year and the percentage increase in the Employment Cost Index for Elementary and Secondary Schools, as determined by the Bureau of Labor Statistics in the U.S. Department of Labor, for the previous 12-month period ending June 30. For a school district with a market value/personal income aid ratio (MV/PI AR) greater than 0.4000, its index equals the base index multiplied by the sum of 0.75 and its MV/PI AR for the current year. In June 2011, the Pennsylvania General Assembly passed legislation eliminating six of the exceptions to the Act 1 Index. Several exceptions were maintained: 1) costs to pay interest and principal on indebtedness incurred prior to September 4, 2004 for Act 72 schools and prior to June 27, 2006 for non-Act 72 schools; 2) costs to pay interest and principal on electoral debt; 3) costs incurred in providing special education programs and services (beyond what is already paid by the State); and 4) costs due to increases of more than the Index in the school's share of payments to PSERS (PA school employees pension fund) taking into account the state mandated PSERS contribution rate. The legislature also froze the payroll amount public school districts use to calculate the pension-plan exception at the 2012 payroll levels.

Property tax relief In 2014, Blacklick Valley School District 1,536 approved homestead properties received $110. The amount received by the district must be divided equally among all approved residences. In 2013, 1539 properties received $110. In 2009, School District approved 1,528 homestead properties to receive $111 in property tax relief. The relief was subtracted from the total annual school property tax bill. Property owners apply for the relief through the county Treasurer's office. Farmers can qualify for a farmstead exemption on building used for agricultural purposes. The farm must be at least and must be the primary residence of the owner. Farmers can qualify for both the homestead exemption and the farmstead exemption. The amount of property tax relief each Pennsylvania public school district receives is announced by the PDE in May of each year. The amount of tax relief is dependent on the total tax revenue collected on the casino slots in the previous year. Thirty five percent of the slots tax revenues are used for property tax relief. In Cambria County, the highest tax relief went to Ferndale Area School District which was set at $212.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Tax Relief per Homestead, May 1, 2009. The highest property tax relief provided, among Pennsylvania school districts, goes to the homesteads of Chester Upland School District in Delaware County which received $632 per approved homestead in 2010. Chester- Upland School District has consistently been the top recipient since the programs inception.Tax Relief per Homestead 2009, Pennsylvania Department of Education Report, May 1, 2009 The tax relief was started by Governor Rendell with passage of the gaming law. Rendell promised taxpayers substantial property tax relief from legalized gambling. In Cambria County, 54% of eligible property owners applied for property tax relief in 2009. This was among the lowest participation rates in Pennsylvania. Some Blacklick Valley School District residents, including: low income residents aged 65 and older; widows and widowers aged 50 and older; and people with disabilities age 18 and older, can qualify for the state's Property Tax/Rent Rebate program. The income limit is $35,000 for homeowners. Residents must apply annually to receive up to $650. The Property tax/rent rebate program is funded by revenues from the Pennsylvania Lottery. In 2012, these property tax rebates were increased by an additional 50 percent for senior households in the state, so long as those households have incomes under $30,000 and pay more than 15% of their income in property taxes.Pennsylvania Department of Revenue., Property Tax/Rent Rebate Program, June 2012 Wellness policy Blacklick Valley School Board has an established district wellness policy.Blacklick Valley School Board Policy Manual, Student Wellness Policy 246, 2015 The policy deals with nutritious meals served at school, the control of access to some foods and beverages during school hours, age appropriate nutrition education for all students, and physical education for students K-12. The policy is in response to state mandates and federal legislation (P.L. 108 – 265). The law dictates that each school district participating in a program authorized by the Richard B. Russell National School Lunch Act (42 U.S.C. 1751 et seq) or the Child Nutrition Act of 1966 (42 U.S.C. 1771 et seq) \\"shall establish a local school wellness policy by School Year 2006.\\" Most districts identified the superintendent and school foodservice director as responsible for ensuring local wellness policy implementation. The legislation placed the responsibility of developing a wellness policy at the local level so the individual needs of each district can be addressed. According to the requirements for the Local Wellness Policy, school districts must set goals for nutrition education, physical activity, campus food provision, and other school-based activities designed to promote student wellness. Additionally, districts were required to involve a broad group of individuals in policy development and to have a plan for measuring policy implementation. Districts were offered a choice of levels of implementation for limiting or prohibiting low nutrition foods on the school campus. In final implementation these regulations prohibit some foods and beverages on the school campus. The Pennsylvania Department of Education required each school district to submit a copy of the policy for approval. Blacklick Valley School District offers both a free school breakfast and a free or reduced-price lunch to children in low income families. All students attending the school can eat breakfast and lunch. Children from families with incomes at or below 130 percent of the federal poverty level are provided a breakfast and lunch at no cost to the family. Children from families with incomes between 130 and 185 percent of the federal poverty level can be charged no more than 30 cents per breakfast. A foster child whose care and placement is the responsibility of the State or who is placed by a court with a caretaker household is eligible for both a free breakfast and a free lunch. Runaway, homeless and Migrant Youth are also automatically eligible for free meals.USDA, Child Nutrition Programs - Eligibility Manual for School Meals, 2012 The meals are partially funded with federal dollars through the United States Department of Agriculture.Pennsylvania Hunger Action Center, The Pennsylvania School Breakfast Report Card, 2009 In 2013, the USDA issued new restrictions to foods in public schools. The rules apply to foods and beverages sold on all public school district campuses during the day. They limit vending machine snacks to a maximum of 200 calories per item. Additionally, all snack foods sold at school must meet competitive nutrient standards, meaning they must have fruits, vegetables, dairy or protein in them or contain at least 10 percent of the daily value of fiber, calcium, potassium, and Vitamin D.USDA, Child Nutrition Programs, June 27, 2013 In order to comply with the Healthy, Hunger- Free Kids Act of 2010 all US public school districts are required to raise the price of their school lunches to $2.60 regardless of the actual cost of providing the lunch. The Healthy Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010 mandates that Districts raise their full pay lunch prices every year until the price of non- subsidized lunches equals the amount the federal government reimburses schools for free meals. That subsidy in 2013-2014 was $2.93. In 2014, President Obama ordered a prohibition of advertisements for unhealthy foods on public school campuses during the school day. The Food and Drug Administration requires that students take milk as their beverage at lunch. In accordance with this law, any student requesting water in place of milk with their lunch must present a written request, signed by a doctor, documenting the need for water instead of milk. Blacklick Valley School District provides health services as mandated by the Commonwealth and the federal government. Nurses are available in each building to conduct annual health screenings (data reported to the PDE and state Department of Health) and to dispense prescribed medications to students during the school day. Students can be excluded from school unless they comply with all the State Department of Health's extensive immunization mandates. School nurses monitor each pupil for this compliance. Nurses also monitor each child's weight. Extracurriculars Blacklick Valley School District offers a wide variety of clubs, activities and an extensive, publicly funded sports program. Eligibility for participation is determined by school board policy and in compliance with standards set by the Pennsylvania Interscholastic Athletic Association (PIAA). By Pennsylvania law, all K-12 students residing in the district, including those who attend a private nonpublic school, cyber charter school, charter school and those homeschooled, are eligible to participate in the extracurricular programs including all athletics. They must meet the same eligibility rules as the students enrolled in the district's schools. According to the Pennsylvania Child Abuse Recognition and Reporting Act 126 of 2014, all volunteer coaches and all those who assist in student activities, must have criminal background checks.

Launched in 1927, the vessels were named Hrabri (Brave) and Nebojša (Fearless). Their design was based on that of the British L-class submarine of World War I, and they were built using parts originally assembled for L-class submarines that were never completed. The Hrabri-class were the first submarines to serve in the Royal Yugoslav Navy, and the class was joined by the two smaller French-made s to make up the pre-war Yugoslav submarine force. They were armed with six bow- mounted torpedo tubes, two deck guns and one machine gun, and could dive to . Prior to World War II both submarines participated in cruises to Mediterranean ports. Hrabri was captured by Italian forces in April 1941 during the German- led Axis invasion of Yugoslavia. She was never commissioned by the Italians and was subsequently scrapped. Nebojša evaded capture, and served with British submarine forces in the Mediterranean as an anti-submarine warfare training boat until the end of the war. Following the war, she served in the Yugoslav Navy as Tara in a training role until 1954, when she was stricken. Description and construction Yugoslav naval policy in the interwar period lacked direction until the mid-1920s, although it was generally accepted that the Adriatic coastline was effectively a sea frontier that the naval arm was responsible for securing with the limited resources made available to it. In 1926, a modest ten-year construction program was initiated to build up a force of submarines, coastal torpedo boats, torpedo bombers and conventional bomber aircraft to perform this role. The Hrabri-class submarines were one of the first new acquisitions aimed at developing a naval force capable of meeting this challenge. The Hrabri-class was built for the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes (later Yugoslavia) by the Vickers-Armstrong Naval Yard on the River Tyne in the United Kingdom. Their design was based on that of the British L-class submarine of World War I, and they were built using parts originally assembled for the Group III boats HMS L-67 and HMS L-68, which were never completed due to the end of the war. The L-class were designed for operations in the North Sea, but during the interwar period the Royal Navy had deployed them around the world, including in the Mediterranean from 1929 onward. The two Yugoslav boats had an overall length of , a beam of , and a surfaced draught of . Their surfaced displacement was or submerged, and their crews consisted of 45 officers and enlisted men. They had a diving depth of . For surface running, Hrabri-class boats were powered by two diesel engines which were rated at that drove two propeller shafts. When submerged, the propellers were driven by two electric motors generating . They could reach a top speed of on the surface and on their electric motors when submerged. On the surface, the boats had a range of at . The Hrabri-class were armed with six bow-mounted torpedo tubes and carried twelve torpedoes. They were also equipped with two guns (one forward and one aft of the conning tower), and one machine gun. Service history Both submarines were launched in 1927, and left the Tyne in late January 1928. In company with the Yugoslav submarine tender , the submarines arrived in the Bay of Kotor on the southern Adriatic coast on 8 April 1928. In May and June 1929, Hrabri, Nebojša, Hvar and six torpedo boats accompanied the light cruiser Dalmacija on a cruise to Malta, the Greek island of Corfu in the Ionian Sea, and Bizerte in the French protectorate of Tunisia. According to the British naval attaché, the ships and crews made a very good impression while visiting Malta. On 16 May 1930, Nebojša was exercising her crew at periscope depth near the entrance to the Bay of Kotor when she collided with a Yugoslav steamship. The damage was not serious and there were no injuries. In June and July 1930, Hrabri, Nebojša and the fleet auxiliary Sitnica again cruised the Mediterranean, visiting Alexandria and Beirut. In 1932, the British naval attaché reported that Yugoslav ships engaged in few exercises, manoeuvres or gunnery training due to reduced budgets. In 1933, the attaché reported that the naval policy of Yugoslavia was strictly defensive, aimed at protecting her more than of coastline. Hrabri was captured in port by the Italians during the German-led Axis invasion of Yugoslavia in April 1941. She was not commissioned by them and was scrapped later that year due to her poor condition. Nebojša evaded capture during the invasion, and was used by the Royal Navy as an anti- submarine warfare training vessel. After the war she was overhauled by the Yugoslavs and renamed Tara, continuing in a training role until she was stricken in 1954.

The thought experiment of radical translation and the accompanying notion of indeterminacy of translation are original to Word and Object, which is Quine's most famous book. Synopsis Quine emphasizes his naturalism, the doctrine that philosophy should be pursued as part of natural science. He argues in favor of naturalizing epistemology, supports physicalism over phenomenalism and mind-body dualism, and extensionality over intensionality, develops a behavioristic conception of sentence-meaning, theorizes about language learning, speculates on the ontogenesis of reference, explains various forms of ambiguity and vagueness, recommends measures for regimenting language to eliminate ambiguity and vagueness as well as to make perspicuous the logic and ontic commitments of theories, argues against quantified modal logic and the essentialism it presupposes, argues for Platonic realism in mathematics, rejects instrumentalism in favor of scientific realism, develops a view of philosophical analysis as explication, argues against analyticity and for holism, against countenancing propositions, and tries to show that the meanings of theoretical sentences are indeterminate and that the reference of terms is inscrutable. Behaviorism Central to Quine's philosophy is his linguistic behaviorism. Quine has remarked that one may or may not choose to be a behaviorist in psychology, but one has no choice but to be a behaviorist in linguistics.The Cambridge Companion to Quine, Roger F. Gibson, Cambridge University Press, 2004, p. 199 This influence can be seen in Word and Object. In chapter 2 a linguist has to translate a native's unknown language into English. What is so specifically behavioristic there is that the linguist has nothing to go on but verbal behavior from the native and the visible environment the native interacts with. The same view is displayed in chapter 3 where Quine describes how a baby learns its first words. In this chapter Quine also mentions B.F. Skinner, a well known behaviorist, as one of his influences. The opposite view to Quine's and Skinner's in philosophy of language is represented by Noam Chomsky's linguistic nativism. New edition with a foreword by Patricia Churchland. Translation and meaning In the second chapter of Word and Object, Quine investigates the concept of meaning. He shows to what extent his own, empirical, notion of meaning can give an account for our intuitive concept of meaning: 'what a sentence shares with its translation'. Quine also introduces his famous principle of indeterminacy of translation, with the help of the thought experiment of radical translation, i.e. translation of a hitherto unknown language (called Jungle by Quine) into English. The point of this thought experiment is to show that a behavioristic account of meaning does not allow for the determination of the right manual for translating one language into another, as there is no such single right translation manual. A linguist desiring to translate Jungle has to set up his translation manual based only on the events happening around him/her, the stimulations, combined with the verbal and non-verbal behaviour of Jungle natives. The linguist can thus only use empirical information, therefore, radical translation will tell us which part of our language can be accounted for by stimulus conditions. In the experiment, Quine assumes that functional Jungle equivalents of 'Yes' and 'No' are relatively easy to be found. This allows the linguist to actively query the utterances of the natives, by repeating words (s)he has heard the native utter, and to subsequently record the native's reaction of assent or dissent. In determining the translation of the Jungle sentence 'Gavagai' (whose English equivalent would be 'Look, a rabbit'), the linguist first has to determine which stimulation prompt the native to assent, and which prompt him to dissent to the linguist uttering 'Gavagai'. For example, if the linguist sees a rabbit, and the native says 'Gavagai', the linguist may think that 'Gavagai' means 'Rabbit'. (S)he will then try the sentence 'Gavagai' in different situations caused by the stimulation of a rabbit, to see whether the native assents or dissents to the utterance. The native's reaction is elicited by the linguist's question and the prompting stimulation together. It is the stimulation that prompts the assent or dissent, not the object in the world, because an object in the world can be replaced by a replica, but then the stimulation stays the same. 'The class of all the stimulations [..] that would prompt his assent' is the affirmative stimulus meaning of a certain sentence for a given speaker. Negative stimulus meaning is defined likewise, with assent and dissent interchanged. Quine calls these affirmative and negative stimulus meaning combined the stimulus meaning of the sentence. However, since we want to account for the fact that a speaker can change the meaning of a concept, we add the modulus to the definition of stimulus meaning: the time frame in which the stimulations take place. Once the stimulus meaning has been found, the linguist can then compare it to the stimulus meanings of sentences in English. The English sentence with (near-) identical stimulus meaning to 'Gavagai' functions as a translation of 'Gavagai'. After Quine has set out the concept of stimulus meaning, he continues by comparing it with our intuitive notion of meaning.Becker, E. (2012). The Themes of Quine's Philosophy: Meaning, Reference, and Knowledge. Cambridge University Press. For this, he distinguished two kinds of sentences: occasion sentences and standing sentences. Occasion sentences are the sentences that are only affirmed or dissented after an appropriate stimulation, e.g. 'Look, a rabbit walks by!' On the other hand, there are standing sentences, which do not rely on stimulation for assent or dissent; they can be prompted by stimulation, but they don't have to be, e.g. 'Rabbits are mammals'. Thus, the stimulus meaning is less useful to approximate the intuitive meaning of standing sentences. However, the difference between occasion and standing sentences is only a gradual difference. This difference depends on the modulus because 'an occasion sentence modulo n seconds can be a standing sentence modulo n – 1'. Since stimulus meaning cannot really account for the intuitive concept of meaning for standing sentences, the question remain whether it can account for the intuitive concept of meaning for observation sentences. Quine approaches this question by investigating whether, for occasion sentences, the intuitive notion of synonymy (sameness of meaning) is equivalent to the notion of stimulus synonymy (sameness of stimulus meaning). For this question, he uses the notion of observationality. A special subclass of occasion sentences are the observations sentences. Their stimulus meaning is least influenced by collateral information, extra information that is hidden for the linguist, and does not vary over the population. Therefore, observation sentences belong to the sentences that are directly translatable by the linguist.Kirk, Robert. (2004). \\"Indeterminacy of Translation\\". In: Roger F. Gibson, Jr (ed.) The Cambridge Companion to Quine. pp. 151-180. Cambridge Companions to Philosophy. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. p. 162. However, it is exactly this point of collateral information that poses problems for equating the intuitive notion of synonymy with the notion of stimulus synonymy. For even sentences that are supposedly highly observational, like 'Gavagai!', can be affected by collateral information. Quine uses the example of a rabbit-fly: assume that there is a fly that is unknown to the linguist, that only occurs in the presence of rabbits. Seeing such a rabbit-fly in the grass would thus make the native assent to the sentence 'Gavagai', because the native can be sure that there is a rabbit nearby. However, the rabbit-fly is not part of the stimulus meaning of 'Rabbit' for the linguist. Thus, even for the most observational occasion sentences, it is not possible to equate the intuitive notion of synonymy with stimulus synonymy. From this, Quine concludes that we cannot make sense of our intuitive notions of meaning. As Becker formulates it: =Indeterminacy of translation= Having taken the first steps in translating sentences, the linguist still has no idea if the term 'gavagai' is actually synonymous to the term 'rabbit', as it is just as plausible to translate it as 'one second rabbit stage', 'undetached rabbit part', 'the spatial whole of all rabbits', or 'rabbithood'. Thus, the identical stimulus meaning of two sentences 'Gavagai' and 'Rabbit' does not mean that the terms 'gavagai' and 'rabbit' are synonymous (have the same meaning). In fact, we cannot even be sure that they are coextensive terms, because 'terms and reference are local to our conceptual scheme', and cannot be accounted for by stimulus meaning. It appears therefore impossible to determine a unique correct translation of the term 'gavagai', since the linguist can take any of the mentioned possibilities and have it correspond to the stimulus meaning through adaptation of logical connectives. This implies there is no matter of fact to which the word refers. Quine calls this the inscrutability of reference. This inscrutability leads to difficulties in translating sentences, especially with sentences that have no direct connection to stimuli. For example, the tautological Jungle sentence 'Gavagai xyz gavagai' could be translated (in accordance with stimulus meaning) as 'This rabbit is the same as this rabbit'. However, when 'gavagai' is taken as 'undetached rabbit part' and 'xyz' as 'is part of the same animal as', the English translation could also run 'This undetached rabbit part is part of the same animal as this undetached rabbit part'. The Jungle sentence and its two English translations all have the same stimulus meaning and truth conditions, even though the two translations are clearly different. Quine concludes that the linguist can set up his translation manual in different ways, that all fit the native's speech behaviour yet are mutually incompatible. This is called holophrastic indeterminacy. There is no one correct translation of Jungle: translation is indeterminate. =Analytical hypotheses= Quine sums up the first steps of the radical translation: To go beyond these boundaries of translation by stimulus meaning, the linguist uses analytical hypotheses, in which he uses the steps (1)–(4) to equate parts of the native sentences to English words or phrases. Using the analytical hypotheses the linguist can form new sentences and create a translation manual.  In Chapter 2 of Word and Object, Quine shows that the total apparatus of grammatical and semantic devices in a language is not objectively translatable into foreign languages. Therefore, in Chapter 3, he proposes to investigate a language's devices relative to each other. For this, he first describes a child's process of acquiring reference, by showing the order in which children learn grammatical devices. In Chapter 4 he then turns away from language acquisition, to investigate the vagaries of reference in a particular language (English). In Chapter 5, Quine proposes a system for regimentation, which should help us understand how reference in language works and should clarify our conceptual scheme. He calls this system the canonical notation; it is a system with which we can investigate the grammatical and semantic devices of English by paraphrase. =Acquiring reference= In order to learn a language, a child has to learn how the language expresses reference grammatically. Quine presents a behavioral theory in which the child acquires language through a process of conditioning and ostension.Murphey, M. The Development of Quine's Philosophy. Springer, 2011. Web. Boston Studies in the Philosophy of Science. p. 163 This process consists of four phases. In the first phase the child starts babbling. This behavior gets rewarded or not, dependent on the situation in which it occurs. Terms are learned by a process of reinforcement and extinction. In this phase, the child is not aware yet of objects, it just reacts to stimulations. This is a form of operant conditioning. In the second phase, the child acquires general terms, and demonstrative singular terms (this, that) and singular description, sentences that name (or purport to name) only one object. In this phase the child also learns terms that do not have reference, like 'unicorn'. Furthermore, the child learns divided reference of general terms (that general terms refer to more than one object), and with that it has access to a conceptual scheme that includes 'enduring and recurring objects'. With this, the child has acquired the important distinction between singular and general terms. This distinction entails that a singular term 'purports to refer to one object' while a general term does not purports to refer to an object. As Quine points out: 'The basis combination in which general and singular terms find their contrasting roles is that of predication.' Predication combines general terms with singular terms, in a sentence that is true or false just as the general term ('F') is true or false of the object to which the singular term ('a') refers. Predication is thus logically represented as 'Fa'. In the third phase, the child learns composite general terms, which are formed by joining two general terms. In the fourth phase, the child learns how to talk about new objects. The child can now apply relative terms to singular or general terms. A relative term is a term that is true of two (or more) objects in relation to each other, like 'bigger than'. The child can now make use of terms that refer to objects that cannot be seen, for example 'smaller than that speck' to refer to a neutrino. This phase thus gives a new dimension to the child's conceptual scheme. =Vagaries of reference and referential transparency= In Chapter 4 of Word and Object, Quine looks at the indeterminacies of reference that are inherent to the (English) language system. A term is vague if the boundaries of its reference are not clear. For a singular term this means that the boundaries of the object it refers to are not clear, e.g. with the 'mountain': for two neighboring mountains it is not clear where the first mountain stops and the second one begins. General terms can be vague in this same way, but also in yet another way, namely that there are some objects of which it is not clear whether or not they should be included in the reference of the term. For example, the term 'blue' is vague insofar as it is not clear whether or not some objects are blue or green. A second vagary of reference is ambiguity. Ambiguity differs from vagueness in that for a vague term the (boundaries of) its reference are unsettled, whereas ambiguous terms do refer to clearly to objects, however they are clearly true and clearly false of the same objects. For example, the term 'light' is clearly true of a dark feather, but at the same time clearly false of it. Quine also introduces the term 'referential transparency'. Quine wants to make explicit the ambiguities in language, and to show different interpretations of sentences, therefore, he has to know where the terms in a sentence refer to. A term is used in purely referential position if its only purpose is to specify its object so that the rest of the sentence can say something about it. If a term is used in purely referential position, it is subject to the substituitivity of identity: the term can be substituted by a coextensive term (a term true of the same objects) without changing the truth-value of the sentence. In the sentence, 'Amsterdam rhymes with Peter Pan' you cannot substitute 'Amsterdam' with 'the capital of the Netherlands'. A construction, a way in which a singular term or a sentence is included in another singular term or sentence, has referential transparency: it is either referentially transparent or referentially opaque. A construction is referentially transparent if it is the case that if an occurrence of a term is purely referential in a sentence then it is purely referential also in the containing sentence. However, Quine's goal is to make clear which positions in a sentence are referentially transparent, not to make them all transparent. =Canonical notation= In Chapter 5 of Word and Object Quine proposes a system of regimentation: the paraphrasing of sentences into a 'canonical notation', that we can use to understand how reference works in a language. Since we use language for science, the reductions that we make in the complexity of the structure of sentences will also simplify the conceptual schema of science. In the canonical notation, a sentence S is paraphrased as S'. S' is a paraphrase of S that should clarify its reference, which means that it often resolves ambiguities, and is therefore by definition not synonymous with S. However, S' should express the intended meaning of the speaker. Therefore, it should always be the original speaker who does the paraphrasing. The canonical notation consists of: atomic sentences (sentences that do not have sentences as a part) that have a general term in the predicate position, with one or more variables: 'Fa' or 'Fab,' etc. Non-atomic sentences are built from atomic sentences by using truth functions, quantifiers, and some other devices, like the four variable-binding operators. Quine drops tense, and instead uses the present as temporally neutral. We can express time with the use of 'a at t', where x is a spatiotemporal object. In his canonical notation, Quine has eliminated all singular terms other than variables. This greatly simplifies his logical theory, in the sense that there is economy in the roots of the theory: there is a very limited number of elements. In some situations, however, short paraphrases are very useful, for example in mathematic deductions. For these cases, Quine introduces definitions: we can define singular terms relative to the canonical notation. In that way, we can still use singular terms, without having to include them in our theory. Semantic ascent In the last paragraph of Word and Object, Quine asks the question why, in a book titled Word and Object, we have talked more about words than about objects. He comes to the conclusion that this has to do with the distinction Rudolf Carnap makes between a material mode of speech and a formal one.Carnap, Rudolf, Logical Syntax of Language [1960]. The International Library of Philosophy: Philosophy of Mind and Language, Routledge, Reprint edition, 2010, pp. 63-64. In the material mode we talk about objects themselves and usually this is unproblematic. However, when two people with completely different ideas of whether or not there are such entities as miles, are discussing miles as the objects themselves this discussion will be fruitless. It is in these instances that we see what Quine calls semantic ascent, the shift from the material mode of language to the formal one. In the formal mode of language we are at a different level. Rather than talking about miles as objects we are talking about what this word 'mile' even means, what it refers to and if it even refers at all. In the formal mode, people with different conceptual schemes might be able to have a reasonable discussion because they are talking about something their conceptual schemes have in common: language. Quine differs from Carnap in applicability of semantic ascent. Carnap believes that talking in a formal mode is something that can only be done to some effect in philosophy. Quine, however, believes that semantic ascent is used in science as well. He argues that Einstein's theory of relativity wasn't just accepted by the scientific community because of what it had to say about 'time, light, headlong bodies and the perturbations of Mercury' in the material mode, but also because of its simplicity compared to other theories in the formal mode. The formal mode allows for a more distant approach to certain problems; however, we are not able to reach a vantage point outside of our conceptual scheme, to Quine 'there is no such cosmic exile'.

It was translated into Arabic in the Abbasid age specifically in the second hijri century (the eighth Gregorian century) by Abdullah ibn al-Muqaffa using his own writing style. A lot of researchers have agreed that the book goes back to Indian roots, and was based on the Sanskrit text Pañcatantra. Then it was translated into Pahlavi language at the beginning of the sixth Gregorian century by orders from Khosrow I. The book introduction says that the Indian scholar Bedba wrote it for Debshleem, the king of India. The author used animals and birds as the main characters in it, which mainly refer to human characters. The fables include several subjects, the most remarkable among which is the relation between the king and his people. In addition, they include a number of aphorisms and sermons. When Khosrow I heard about the book and the sermons it contains, he ordered the physician Borzuya to travel to India, copy what is in the book, and translate it into Persian Pahlavi. King Vakhtang VI of Kartli made a translation from Persian to Georgian in the 18th century.https://evergreen.tsu.ge/eg/opac/record/134029?qtype=author;query=%E1%83%A8%E1%83%9D%E1%83%A8%E1%83%98%E1%83%A2%E1%83%90%E1%83%A8%E1%83%95%E1%83%98%E1%83%9A%E1%83%98%20%20%E1%83%9C%E1%83%9D%E1%83%93%E1%83%90%E1%83%A0%20 His work, later edited by his mentor Sulkhan-Saba Orbeliani, has been used as a reference while determining the possible original text, along with an earlier unfinished translation by King David I of Kakheti.http://iliauni.edu.ge/uploads/other/17/17836.pdf The book consists of fifteen main chapters containing a lot of fables whose heroes are animals. One of the remarkable animal characters the book includes is the lion, which plays the role of the king, and his servant ox Shetrebah, in addition to two jackals, Kalila and Dimna. The book includes four other chapters which came in the first pages of the book: chapter of introduction, chapter of Borzuya's delegation to India, chapter of introducing the book translated by Abdullah ibn al-Muqaffa, and chapter of Borzuya translated by Bazrgamhr ibn al- Bakhtakan. The Arabic version of the book played an important role in spreading it, since it was translated into other languages directly from the Arabic text or through middle languages which are taken from the Arabic text. Kalila and Dimna is considered a masterpiece of Arabic literature, and one of the most popular and influential books ever written. It forms part of Arab pop-culture today and is still widely read in the Arab World, with various depictions in plays, cartoons, and commentary works.  Summary The King Dabschelim is visited by the philosopher Bidpai who tells him a collection of stories with important morals for a King. The stories are in response to requests of parables from Dabschelim and they follow a Russian doll format, with stories interwoven within the stories. =Story One: The Lion and the Ox= The Ox, Shatrabah, was abandoned by his master due to being stuck in a mud pit and was left to be watched by a servant. However, the servant grew tired of waiting and also abandoned Shatrabah and told his master that the ox had died. Nevertheless, Shatrabah managed to free himself and make his way to a lush pasture where he lived in peace. But the solitude took its toll on Shatrabah and he would moo loudly in despair and loneliness. The sounds of his wails reached the ears of the lion king who ruled the area. The lion had a court of many animals and predators but had never heard the wailing of an ox. From the lion's court were two doormen jackals, the brothers Kalila and Dimnah. Dimnah was an ambitious jackal and wanted to earn the favour of the king and become his most trusted member of the court. Kalila tried to dissuade Dimnah of his plans, but was rebuffed by Dimnah's ambition. Dimnah managed to gain entry into the court with his silvertongue, which impressed the lion king and so, he rose rapidly in rank and quickly became the lion's closest advisor. Upon hearing the wails of Shatrabah, the lion became anxious and wary of venturing outside, as his scouts had reported on the marvellous beast, with its huge horns and menacing frame (as Shatrabah had put on weight while grazing in the lush meadow), who was the source of the noise. Dimnah was concerned with the king's abandonment of his daily patrol and duties, so he approached the king and calmed him down. Dimnah then went and confronted Shatrabah and painted the picture of the fierce lion king and his court of predators to the ox. Shatrabah was in awe and fear of the king described to him and obeyed Dimnah's claim of a summons from the king and went back with Dimnah. However, on arrival the ox and the lion struck up a friendship and as days passed, their bond grew and Shatrabah took Dimnah's place as the main confidant of the king. As the days passed, a fierce jealousy consumed Dimnah and he became set on taking down Shatrabah. He confided in his brother Kalila, who warned him against his plans but to no avail. Dimnah first approached the lion and told him that Shatrabah was plotting against him and was planning to usurp the power for himself. The king was skeptical of Dimnah's claims of treason, due to his knowledge of the meek nature of his ox friend. But Dimnah persisted and convinced the lion of Shatrabah's planned treachery and Dimnah advised the lion that the only way to resolve the treason was to punish the ox by death. The lion decided to confront Shatrabah about these plans and then exile him. Dimnah, knowing the plan would be unravelled if they were allowed to talk, told the lion that if Shatrabah's limbs were trembling and if he was moving his horns as if preparing to charge, then there was no doubt regarding his treason. Dimnah then quickly went to Shatrabah and told him of the lion's plan to kill him and feast on his flesh with his court. But Shatrabah was skeptical of Dimnah's claims as he knew of no crime that he had committed which could have resulted in such a punishment. But he was convinced that the evil members of the lion's court had turned the king against him and that only Dimnah stood by his side. Shatrabah reasoned that the lion's carnivorous nature had won out and that a herbivore like himself had held no place in such a court in the first place. Spurred by Dimnah's whisperings, Shatrabah prepared himself to engage the lion in combat to save his life. Dimnah told the ox that if the lion approaches you with his chest out and mouth open, then know he has come to kill you. Dimnah then went to his brother and told him of his near success before scampering off to witness the showdown. When the lion confronted the ox, they each saw the other exactly as Dimnah had described and so launched themselves at each other. Shatrabah was killed and the lion was left heavily wounded. Kalila severely scolded his brother for his actions and warned him of the fatal consequences of his deception if he was to be uncovered. The lion king while licking his wounds regretted killing his friend Shatrabah and started to become suspicious of Dimnah. Meanwhile, a leopard from amongst the closest members of the king's court was prowling in the dark, when he came upon Kalila admonishing Dimnah for his deception and he overheard the whole thing. The leopard immediately went to the lion's mother and upon swearing her to secrecy told her of Dimnah's dastardly scheme. The mother visited her son the next day and saw how his remorse was eating him up and she scolded him for acting without proper investigation. While she was there Dimnah paid a visit to the king and got in a spat with the lion's mother who accused him of treachery and scheming against the king. Dimnah attempted to save the situation with his eloquence but only managed to get thrown into prison. While in prison, he was visited by his brother Kalila who reminded him of his earlier warnings to not carry out his plot. However, unbeknown to them both a cheetah lay imprisoned with Dimnah, and he overheard the whole confession and was willing to testify against Dimnah in the judge's court. When the court case came, the judge asked for witnesses and warned them all of the punishment in the hereafter if they hid their testimony. The leader of the pigs tried to defame Dimnah, but Dimnah skilfully talked his way out and managed to avoid any further scandal. During Dimnah's spell in prison, Kalila fell ill out of grief and guilt and died. A fellow jackal Rawzbah visited Dimnah in prison and informed him of his brother's passing, to which Dimnah was very bereaved. Meawhile the lion pressured his mother into revealing the source of her information regarding Dimnah's plan. She summoned the leopard who testified against Dimnah, as did the imprisoned cheetah, which was enough for the judge to pass the death sentence. And so Dimnah was mercilessly executed. Sub-story One - The Man and the Wolf A man was travelling in the wild when he saw a threatening wolf, so in order to escape he ran but came to a ravine with a river preventing safe passage to the village on the other side. Faced with death at the hands of the wolf, the man took his chances and jumped in the river in an attempt to swim across. The current was too strong and he was being pulled away, when a group of villagers saw him and came to his aid. After being saved and taken to the village he decided to rest for a while in an empty hut on the outskirts of the village, however to his surprise he entered upon a group of bandits distributing their loot. In fear of his life, he quickly took off and ran into an alley where he leant against a wall to catch his breath. The wall then fell on him and he died. Sub-story two - The Monkey and the Carpenter A carpenter had a pet monkey who watched him work all day. The monkey dreamed of using the hammer and pegs of the carpenter, and so one day when the carpenter went for a break he seized the opportunity. The monkey grabbed the hammer and went to hammer a peg into the piece of wood, but unwittingly his tail had got caught in the gap without him noticing, so when the hammer came down the peg was driven into the monkey's tail and he fell unconscious from the pain. However, when the carpenter returned to find the monkey's handiwork, the monkey became victim of an even more painful punishment for his foolishness. Sub-story three and four are part of the main story Sub-story five - The crow and the serpent There was a crow who lived in a tree with a serpent who lived at the bottom in his burrow. However, the snake would eat the eggs of the crow. In revenge, the crow intended to claw out the snake's eyes, but he was discouraged by a jackal who told him to play smart. The jackal advised the crow to steal the jewelry of a human and make a show of throwing it into the snake's burrow. When the crow did this, the humans followed the crow to the burrow and upon finding the snake killed it and retrieved the jewelry, thus relieving the crow of the snake. Sub-story of sub-story five - The toad and the crab There was a toad who lived in a pond full of fish and would eat to his fill daily, however as he grew old he could not fish and so grew hungry. As the toad sat there, old, hungry and sad, thinking of a solution, a passing crab took pity on him and asked what the problem was. The toad told the crab that fishermen were going to come and take all the fish, so he was going to die of hunger. The crab told all the fish the news and they all went to the toad for advice. The toad suggested moving to a new and safer pond nearby, and he offered to transport two fish daily. The fish took upon his offer, but the toad would take the fish and would eat them and spit their bones out near the other pond. One day the crab asked to be transferred as he had become lonely, so the toad took him, but when they arrived the crab saw the heap of bones and realised what the toad had been doing the whole time, and so quickly grabbed the toad in its pincers and snapped its neck. Sub-story six - The Rabbit and the Lion There was a lion that ruled a jungle, the occupants gathered together and offered to present the lion an animal a day as an offering, so he would not hunt them. One day the draw fell to a rabbit to deliver the meal to the lion, however the rabbit did not arrive on time and kept the lion hungry and waiting. When the rabbit arrived, he came empty-handed, furious the lion demanded to know why. The rabbit claimed that he was going to present another rabbit as a meal, but that rabbit refused and claimed that he was going to feed himself to the real king of the jungle, another lion. The lion incensed by this challenge of authority demanded the rabbit to take him to the other lion. The rabbit took the lion to the edge of a well and showed the lion their reflection and told the lion that there was the other rabbit and lion. The lion roared and jumped into the well to attack and drowned. Sub-story seven - The three fish There were three fish in a pond, a wise one, a smart one and a shortsighted one. The fish overheard two fishermen walk past and say that they would come back and catch all the fish in the pond. The wise fish heard this and immediately left the pond and joined the river that flowed into the pond. The smart fish delayed until the fishermen arrived, but when he tried to leave he was blocked by the nets of the fishermen. So he flopped out of the pond and pretended to be a dead fish so that the fishermen move him closer to the river, and when they did, he jumped into the river and swam away. As for the shortsighted fish, he was caught. Sub-story eight - The louse and the flea There was a louse who would stay in the bed of a richman and drink his blood daily without getting caught. Then a flea visited one day and went with the louse to drink the blood of the richman, but when the flea bit the man, he ran away and the man woke up. The man only saw the louse and so killed the louse out of anger and pain. Sub-story nine - The Wolf, the crow, the jackal and the camel There was a lion who had three companions, a wolf, a crow and a jackal. One day a camel left his flock to join the lion, where he stayed for a long time. One day the lion was injured by an elephant and could no longer hunt; this was a problem for the wolf, crow and jackal, as they would scavenge the leftovers of the lion's hunt. However they told the lion that they would hunt for him. Together they hatched a plan and proposed to the lion that they eat the camel, however the lion angrily rebuffed the idea as he didn't want to back-stab his friend. The crow tried to explain that sometimes sacrifices must be made for the greater good, and the lion stayed silent and that was the sign of his acceptance. So they plotted that the three of them would present themselves to the lion to be eaten along with the camel, but for each of the three the other two would intercede and they wouldn't eat him. So when the camel offered himself to the lion, they did not intercede and they all fell upon him and ate him. Sub-story ten - The sea bird and the sea agent There were two sandpipers who were a couple, they had a nest near the sea. The wife insisted on moving their nest to avoid the sea agent, but the husband refused and when the tide came in the sea agent took the nest. The male sandpiper decided to call upon the king of the birds, the phoenix, for help, which he received. The phoenix went with a contingent of birds to attack the sea agent and reclaim the nest, but the sea agent gave it up out of fear and avoided confrontation. =Sub-story of sub-story ten - The Turtle and the two ducks= A turtle lived in a pond with two ducks, but the pond's water levels were decreasing, so the turtle asked the ducks to help him move to another pond. Together they devised a plan that the ducks will hold two sides of a stick and fly to the other pond, while the turtle held on with its mouth. As they were flying, people on the ground started to marvel at this strange sight. The turtle, who was very self-conscious, cursed the onlookers, but in doing so, opened his mouth and fell to the ground and died. Sub-story eleven - The monkeys and the bird There was a troop of monkeys, who were cold and searching for fire one night, when they saw a glow worm and started to chase it. An onlooking bird knew that it was a glow worm and not fire and so called out to them to stop their futile chase, as it would not give them the warmth they desired. The monkeys ignored the bird and carried on. The bird was determined to convince them of their error, when a man said to the bird to leave the monkeys alone, because they are too stubborn to accept their error. The bird refused to listen to the man and flew to the monkeys to convince them, but they got angry and grabbed the bird and threw him to the ground, killing him.

The cunning one proposed to the naive man that they each take a small portion and bury the rest under a nearby tree, and when any of them needed any of it, they would both return and take whatever was needed. The naive man agreed and they buried the case and went their separate ways. However, the cunning man returned, dug up the treasure and took it all. After some time, the naive man visited the cunning man and told him that he needed some of the money, so they both went to the tree, dug up the area and found nothing. Immediately the cunning man turned on the naive man and accused him of taking all the money. The naive man, protesting his innocence, ended up in court with the cunning man. The judge asked the cunning man to provide evidence for his claim, the cunning man claimed that the tree would testify that the naive man stole all the money.

After the tree answered the judges questions, the flabbergasted judge ordered the tree to be burnt down. The father, within the tree, started to scream and jumped out of the tree and confessed to the judge the whole plot.

The crow watched as the hunter hid and a flock of pigeons along with their ruler, the collared pigeon, landed on the net to eat the seeds. When all the pigeons were trapped, they all tried to save themselves and fly away, but they were stuck. The collared pigeons ordered them to work together and fly off so that they could all be saved. The pigeons flew away while being pursued by the hunter and followed by the crow. The pigeon decided to ask his mouse friend to free all of them from the net, so they went to his hole and called him. The mouse freed the pigeons, which impressed the crow, who tried to become friends with him. The mouse was wary and hostile to a known predator. However the crow persisted and swore not to eat until the mouse becomes his friend. The mouse agreed to become his friend but was still afraid of the crows fellow crows, who were not as friendly as the crow. The crow promised to protect him and break ties with any crow who would be the mouse's enemy. After the friendship blossomed, the crow convinced the mouse to leave the human dwellings and move to the jungle and live with the crow and his tortoise friends. So the crow took the mouse by the tail and flew him to the jungle. One day, they were all relaxing in the jungle, when suddenly a deer burst into the gathering. Startled, the crow flew off, the mouse went into his hole and the tortoise into his shell. But when they realised that the deer was alone they approached him. The deer told them that he was on the run from two hunters. The group of animals offered the deer to stay with them, out of the way of the hunters and safe, an offer which the deer accepted. After a while, one day, the crow flew into the air to find his friend, the deer. He found the deer caught in the net of two hunters, so he quickly returned to his friends and told them of their friend's plight. They rushed to save the deer, with the mouse cutting the net. However, the tortoise had also followed them to save his friend, they told him off for endangering himself, as he would be too slow if the hunters returned. Suddenly, the hunters returned and the friends ran and flew away, but the tortoise was caught. The friends hatched a plan to save the tortoise, wherein the deer and crow would bait the hunter further and further away from his camp, while the mouse freed the tortoise. After freeing the tortoise, the friends regrouped, and the hunter, now without any caught game, realised his predicament and became convinced that he was in a land of djinn or going insane, so he left. Sub-story one - The mouse and the house of the pious man The mouse used to reside in the house of a pious man and he would scavenge the food of the man when he would leave the house. One day, the man had a guest, whom he asked to get rid of the mouse. The guest dug a hole trying to find the mouse but found a case full of a hundred dinars (gold coins). The guest took the dinars (gold coins) and told the pious man that the coins allowed the mice to scavenge and so the guest and the man split the money between themselves. Meanwhile, the other mice approached the mouse for their normal supply of food, but he didn't have any, so they shunned him and left him alone. The pious man went to sleep and put the money near his head. The mouse intended on taking the money while the man slept, so as to make friends again, but every time he tried, he failed and was hit. So he left the house and lived in the open, where he became friends with the pigeons. =Story Three - The deceitful enemy: The Owl and the Crows= There was a large murder of crows and a large parliament of owls living on a mountain. The two colonies disliked each other, and one night the king of the owls led an attack on the crow colony and killed many crows, took many as prisoners and injured many as well. The crows complained to their ruler, who then consulted the five wise crows of the colony. Three suggested running away and relocating from the mountain, one suggested to propose a treaty wherein the crows would pay the owls an annual tribute in lieu of safety. The king disliked the counsel of the first four owls. The fifth crow suggested that the crow king rip off some of the advisor's own feathers and attack him, leaving him in a dishevelled state, so that he could infiltrate the owl colony as a double agent. When the owls came upon the crow spy, they didn't know what to do with him, so the owl ruler consulted his advisors, one said to kill him but the other two were in favour of keeping him alive as an advisor. The first advisor was still adamant that they should kill the crow but he was ignored. The crow rose in status amongst the owls and learned their secrets. One day he returned to the crow colony and told them of the owls lair, they had burrows in the mountain side. The crows conspired to carry dry firewood and dump it into the burrows before setting them alight, therefore killing all the owls by fire or by the smoke.

She wanted to marry the strongest person, so she went and asked the sun to marry her. The sun told her to go to the clouds, as they were stronger as they cover him. The clouds told her to go to the winds, as they were stronger as they moved him. The winds told her to go to the mountain, as he was stronger as they could not move him. The mountain told her to go to the rat, whom he could not stop burrowing inside him and living on him, so he was stronger.

The ruler of the frogs approached the snake and asked him why he looked so down. The snake replied that he had bit the finger of the son of a pious man, resulting in the boy's death. The pious man had then chased him out and cursed him to be the mount of the frog king and that he could only eat the frogs that were gifted to him by the king.

In the water was a turtle, who would eat the olives, and so decided to strike up a friendship with the monkey. The turtle and the monkey became very good friends and the turtle would enjoy the monkey's company for long periods of time. The wife of the turtle became jealous of the monkey taking all the turtle's time, and so consulted her neighbour. The neighbour suggested that when her husband turtle returns, she should pretend to be ill and say that the doctor has prescribed the only cure as the heart of the monkey. When the husband turtle was told about the cure, he returned to his friend and invited him to his home, a lush island with many trees laden with fruits, with the intent to kill him. The monkey agreed but the turtle became ashamed of his plans and tucked his head into his shell. The monkey became suspicious of the turtle and inquired about his behavior. The turtle told him that his wife was ill and so he feared he could not host the monkey to the best of his capability. They carried on to the island, with the monkey on the turtle's back. The turtle again mentioned his wife's illness and kept on acting more suspiciously. The monkey asked what the cure to his wife's illness was, and the turtle told him it was the heart of a monkey. The monkey suddenly very aware of his predicament told the turtle that he should have mentioned that before they left, because it was customary among monkeys to leave their hearts at home before visiting a friend. The monkey told the turtle that they should return, so the monkey could get his heart and gladly give it to the turtle's wife. The turtle overjoyed by his friends commitment, swam back to the olive tree, whereupon the monkey quickly scrambled ashore and up his tree. The turtle waited for the monkey to return, but he did not, so he called up to the monkey to come down from the tree with his heart so they could return. The monkey scolded the turtle for his plan and his stupidity. Sub-story one - The lion and the donkey There was once a lion who had a jackal companion who would feed off his leftovers. However one day the lion contracted scabies and became too weak to hunt. The jackal concerned for the lion and his own well being asked the lion what could be done.

The donkey readily followed the jackal to the lion, but the lion was too weak to attack it, frightened, the donkey ran away. The lion promised the jackal that if he had one more chance he would be able to attack the donkey and kill it. The jackal called the donkey back, claiming that the other donkeys wanted to welcome him. When the donkey returned, the lion pounced and caught the donkey. However the lion claimed that the doctors said one must eat the heart and ears after bathing. So while the lion went to bathe, the jackal ate the heart and ears of the donkey. When the lion returned and enquired about the heart and the ears, the jackal said that such a donkey that returned after being attacked once, obviously had no heart or ears, otherwise it would have used them the first time and not returned! =Story Five - The hasty imprudent: The pious man and the weasel= There was once a couple who had no children, when one day the wife became pregnant.

Many hunters often passed the tree and laid their nets nearby, one day the cat got caught in a net while exiting his home. The same day, the rat left his home in search of his daily needs, when suddenly he was faced with a weasel intent on eating him, and an owl behind him ready to swoop down and catch him. The rat decided that his only escape was to approach the trapped cat. The rat offered to free the cat and cut the ropes of the net in exchange for security. The cat readily accepted, but the rat was still wary of the cat and so promised to keep one rope still attached until he was sure he was safe. The cat tried to gain the rat's trust but the rat stayed skeptical, until the time came where he freed the cat and made it safely into his burrow. The rat continued his daily searches for food but still kept his distance from the cat. The cat tried to call him in an attempt to reward him for freeing him, but the rat stayed cautious and would not approach the cat. =Story Seven - The nobles who should avoid each other: The Prince and the bird Fanzah= There was once an Indian king called Breedun who had a pet bird called Fanzah.

When Fanzah returned, she cried out in despair, gouged out the eyes of the prince, flew away and landed on the roof of the palace. When the king found out, he was incensed. The king went to talk to Fanzah, calling her down, claiming she was safe as the prince deserved his punishment. However Fanzah refused, as she knew the rage of someone seeking revenge and knew the king would kill her; so she bid the king farewell and flew away. =Story Eight - The ruler who examines the punishment of the convicted innocent: The lion and the pious jackal= There was once a pious jackal who, unlike his fellow brethren and predators, would not spill blood, eat meat or envy his fellows. His brethren disliked him but his fame reached the king of the jungle, the lion, who asked him to be part of his inner council. The jackal politely declined as he believed being involved in such affairs would only bring trouble. However, the lion insisted and the jackal accepted on the condition that if any case regarding the jackal was brought to the lion, he would not be hasty in his judgement. The lion appointed the jackal responsible for the treasury department. The other members of the lion's court grew jealous of the pious jackal and they all agreed to get the jackal in trouble. The lion loved meat and gave a large portion to the jackal to store. The next day when the lion asked for the meat, it did not arrive. He was told by his advisors that the jackal had taken it. Upon summoning the jackal, the jackal claimed he had given the meat to the appointed food person to give to the king. The appointed food person denied ever receiving the meat. The lion sent a search party to the jackal's house where they found the meat, thereby incriminating the jackal, resulting in him being thrown into jail. The lion then summoned the jackal to defend his own case, but the other ministers sent a rude false reply back to the king, infuriating him. The king in his rage issued the execution of the jackal. The lion's mother realised that the lion had acted hastily and calmed him down, she told him to investigate properly and not to execute a close friend over some meat! The mother suspected the other ministers and soon enough they came forward and confessed to their deception. The mother encouraged the lion to forgive and show grace to those who plotted against the jackal, as they would never dare to do anything similar again. She also instructed him to reconcile with the jackal and reinstate him. The jackal talked to the lion and at first did not want to return, but the lion convinced him to and honoured him even more when he did. =Story Nine - Forbearance, the most important quality of a ruler: Iladh, Baladh and Irakht= There was once a king called, Baladh. One night, he saw eight dreams that frightened him, so he called the monks to interpret the dreams. The monks said they would return with the interpretation in a week. The monks hated the king, for he had killed twelve thousand monks. The monks plotted to tell the king that the dreams meant he had to kill those whom he loved and cared for the most, then bathe in their blood and be spat on by the monks, before being washed by perfume in order to avoid a terrible fate. They told the king he must kill his wife Irakht, his child Juwayr, his nephew, his close friend Iladh, his scribe and secret keeper Kaal, his great white elephant, his battle horse, two other great elephants, his fast strong Bactrian camel and the wiseman Kabariyoon, who was responsible for the death of the monks. When the king was informed of this, he said he'd rather die than have his close ones killed. The king retreated to his quarters in sorrow and grief. Iladh realised that the king was hiding something and so told Irakht to approach the king and find out what was troubling him, as he had seen the king with some monks and feared they may have said something to him. Irakht approached her husband and he told her of the interpretation of the dream given by the monks. Irakht was frightened but knew of the monks hatred for the king and so comforted the king and told him to ask Kabariyoon for the correct interpretation. Kabariyoon told the king that it meant in one week he would receive amazing gifts. And so it transpired that a week later the king received amazing gifts. Overjoyed the king called his two wives Irakht and Hawraqnah to pick what they wanted from the gifts. Irakht picked a wreath and Hawraqanah picked a dress. The king would alternate his nights between his wives, one night, while with Irakht, Hawraqnah wore the shimmering beautiful dress and purposefully walked past the king. The king, transfixed and in love, scolded Irakht for choosing the wreath over the dress. Irakht angered by the criticism, struck her husband on the head with a plate. The king, shocked, called for Iladh and told him to execute his wife Irakht. Iladh knew that the king had issued the order in anger and would cool down and regret it later, so he took Irakht and hid her in a hut, he then returned to the king with a bloodied sword and told him he had killed her. The king, now calm and collected, regretted his decision and was in deep sorrow. He proclaimed his love for Irakht openly and his remorse. Iladh then approached the king and told him that Irakht was still alive. The king was overjoyed and welcomed her back and raised her and Iladh in status. The king then executed the monks who had tried to deceive him, thereby gaining closure from his dreams. Sub- story one - The two pigeons There was once a pigeon couple, and they filled their nest with barley and wheat grain. They made a pact not to eat from the grain until winter, when there would be no food available elsewhere. When summer came, the moist grain dried up and shrunk in size. When the male pigeon saw the reduced grain, he accused the wife of eating from it and pecked her to death, while she swore she didn't.

When the lioness returned and saw what had been done to her children, she shrieked and roared in grief. A neighbouring jackal visited her and told her that she had had it coming as what goes around comes around. The lioness distressed and confused asked the jackal to explain. The jackal told her that the action of the horseman was no different to the lioness’ own actions, as her prey also had parents who grieved the loss of their children. The lioness upon hearing this, changed her ways and became a vegetarian and would only eat fruits and would spend most of her day in worship. One day, two doves approached her and scolded her for eating all the fruit, as she was the cause of a fruit shortage, which was depriving many animals of their daily food.

The king had three advisors, Rudhbadh, Shira’ and Baghdad. One day, they all gathered to discuss whether they could rid themselves of the ancestor's fear of cats. Rudhbadh said that one cannot change what they have genetically inherited from their ancestors. He suggested that the king consult the advisors for solutions. One suggested to tie bells to all the cats so that the rats were warned of their presence. The second dismissed the first's proposal and suggested that all the rats leave the city for a year, tricking the people into believing that no more cats are needed, so then they would kill all the cats, allowing the rats to return safely. The third, Rudhbadh, suggested that the king should instruct all the rats to split into groups and infiltrate the homes with cats. Then the rats should damage the clothes and furnishings of the house but leave the food, that way the people will assume that the damage is due to the cats. The rats should also damage according to how many cats lived in the house, the more cats the more damage. This would result in the populace killing all the cats and even removing the cats in the wild, to save their homes. The rats carried out this plan and therefore successfully caused the extermination of all the cats in the city and sowed the hatred of cats within the population for generations, so that no cat could live in Badoor ever again.

A tunnel sat in the mountain's side, from which the seven winds flew out. Near this tunnel was a marvellous palace, unrivalled in its brilliance. One day the king's advisors suggested that they close the tunnel and stop the winds, to make the palace area into a paradise. The advisors believed it may be impossible, but the king ordered all the people of the area to gather and block the hole with rocks, wood and soil. After much toil and effort the people succeeded in blocking the hole. However, this prevented the breeze and gales from the hole spreading, thus causing the trees and water to dry up. Six months had not passed and all the springs and crops had dried up, all the animals had died and a barren wasteland was left for hundreds of miles. Many people died and those who remained marched on the king and killed him and his advisors. The revolters then went to the hole and set fire to the wood that was blocking it to let the air out. Once slightly opened, the six months worth of trapped air burst out of the hole, taking the large fire with it and spreading it to all corners of the kingdom. Not one city, town or tree escaped the carnage of the fire.

So the next day, he broke out of captivity and followed the deer to the stream and tried to converse with it. However, the deer did not understand donkey talk. The donkey was convinced that it was the presence of the owner that was preventing them from conversing, so he attacked and bit the owner. The owner of the deer wanted to mark the donkey so he could find it later, so he sliced its ears off. The donkey, in pain, returned to its master, who was furious that it had run off, and received a worse punishment than having its ears sliced, from his own master. The donkey realised that such desires were foolish and pursuing them only ended badly. =Story Twelve - The one who leaves what is suitable for him to search of the unsuitable: The pious man and the guest= There was once a pious man who served a guest of his some local dates. The foreign guest really liked the dates and wanted to know how he could plant and grow the dates in his city. The pious man told him that his city already had many fruits, so there was no need to plant dates there. It would be an unnecessary burden and it may not even work, as your land may not be suitable for its growth. So the guest decided to drop the subject. The pious man spoke Hebrew and the guest wanted to also learn the language. The guest tried to learn the language and spent many days doing so. The pious man told the guest to stop ignoring his own tongue and focusing on Hebrew, as then he'd forget his mother tongue and will also still be inept at Hebrew, thereby failing at both.

The tourist decided to help them out of good will. First the monkey came out, then the snake, then the tiger, all three told the man not to help the jeweller, as humans are the most ungrateful beings. However, the tourist ignored them and helped the jeweller out as well. The three animals told the tourist that if he ever needs any help while passing by their homes he should just call and they would answer. The jeweller told the tourist that if he ever went to the city Nawadirakht, he should seek him out and he may be able to return the favour. After some time had passed, by chance the tourist had to visit that city. As he approached, the monkey appeared and gifted him a juicy fruit, which he ate thankfully. Then, as he came to the door of the city, the tiger approached him and promised to repay him. The tiger went to one of the palace gardens, killed the princess and took her necklace, giving it to the tourist without telling him of its origin. The tourist, very happy by the treatment received from the animals, intended on approaching the jeweller. When the jeweller saw him, he welcomed him in and sat him down.

He took this as an opportunity and went to the palace and told them that the princess’ murderer is at his home. The tourist was found with the necklace and promptly arrested. It was judged that he be punished and walked around the city and then crucified. While they were doing this, the tourist cried out in anguish how he should have listened to the three animals and not saved the man. The snake heard this and bit the prince, poisoning him such that none of the doctors could cure him. The snake then asked his djinn friend to make the prince believe that the only cure was if the tourist read an incantation over him, as they had wrongly punished him. The snake then entered the tourists cell and gave him a leaf which was the cure to his own poison and told the tourist to tell the prince his story and he should be freed. When the tourist was summoned, he fed the leaf to the prince, curing him. The king gifted the tourist immensely and upon hearing his story had the jeweller crucified for his lies and ungratefulness. =Story Fourteen - The fortunate ignorant and the unfortunate: The prince and his companions= There was once a group of four, a son of a king, a son of a businessman, a handsome son of a nobleman and a son of a farmer. The group was in need and had nothing but the clothes on their backs. The prince believed in fate, the businessman's son believed in intelligence, the nobleman's son believed in beauty and the farmer's son believed in hard work. They came upon a city and the group decided to send the farmer's son first to earn for the day's means. The farmer's son gathered a tonne of firewood and sold it all for a single dirham (silver coin). At the end of the day he walked past the city gates and wrote on them “a cost of a day when one works hard, is one dirham”. The next day the son of the nobleman went into the city and sat down under a tree and fell asleep. A city nobleman passed by and astonished by the beauty of the young man realised it to be the genetics of a noble household. Feeling sympathy for the boy he gifted him five hundred dirhams. The nobleman's son wrote on the gate “a day’s worth of beauty is five hundred dirhams”. The next day the businessman's son went into the city. The boy went to the docks, where a fisherman's boat had bought in many fish. The businessmen of the city had gathered and planned to return later to buy it at a reduced price. The boy approached the fisherman and bought all the fish on credit for one hundred thousand dirhams. He then went about spreading the news that he planned on taking all the fish to another city. The businessmen in a panic rushed to buy from him and the boy made a profit of one hundred thousand dirhams. The businessman's son wrote on the gate “the price of a day’s worth of intelligence is one hundred thousand dirhams”. The next day the prince was sent into the city. The prince sat by the gates of the city and waited. It so transpired that that day the king had died and left no heir. When the funeral passed the prince, he was asked why he didn't grieve. The gatekeeper then arrested the prince and put him in jail. The next day when the city gathered to appoint a new leader, the gatekeeper told them of the strange boy near the gates the previous day. The prince was summoned and told the people of his ancestry and lineage and how his brother had usurped the throne after their father's demise, so he had fled the city. The people who had visited the prince's land in the gathering recognised him and supported his claim. The people then decided to appoint the prince as their new leader. During his coronation procession he passed the gates of the city and ordered for it to be written that “Hardwork, beauty, intelligence and any good or bad one gains in this world is due to the decree of God”. The new king then summoned his companions and appointed the intelligent one as a minister and made the hardworking one a farmer. He then gave the handsome one a large sum of money to be rid of him. The king then gathered his advisors and talked to them regarding the importance of having faith and believing in God and fate. One advisor told the king of his own personal experience of fate. The advisor used to work for a nobleman who would pay him two dinars. One day, the advisor took the two dinars and went to the market with the intention of giving one in charity and keeping the other. He saw a man selling two captured hoopoe birds who were a couple. The man would only sell both of them together and only for the full price of two dinars. The advisor, intent on carrying out his deed, gave up bargaining and purchased the two malnutritioned birds for two dinars. He then released them in a lush garden full of fruit trees. The hoopoe birds decided to tell the advisor of a bag full of gold coins, hidden in a tree. The advisor took the bag and indeed it was full of gold coins. The advisor praised God for his turn in fortune. =Story Fifteen - One who advises others but not himself:The pigeon, the fox and the heron= There was once a pigeon who made a nest in a tree and laid an egg in it. When the egg was ready to hatch, a fox came to the foot of the tree and demanded that the pigeon give him the newborn chick to eat. This continued for the next egg too. One day a heron passed by the pigeon and advised it to challenge the fox to climb the tree and take the eggs himself. The next time the fox came, the pigeon acted on the heron's advice. The fox, stumped, asked the pigeon where it learnt such a retort. The pigeon informed the fox of her teacher the heron. The fox approached the heron, who had nested near the river. The fox asked the heron to show him how it could tuck its head under its wing. While the heron displayed this, the fox attacked the heron and killed it, all the while mocking the heron for providing the pigeon with a trick, but not being smart enough to avoid the fox's trick.

(1986) is an album by American musician Constance Demby, with additional sonic textures by composer Michael Stearns. The album sold over 200,000 copies worldwide It was voted in 2002 one of \\"The 25 Most Influential Ambient Albums of All Time\\".  History  = Creation = The title Novus Magnificat is Latin for \\"New Magnificat\\". Inspired by Western classical and sacred music, Novus Magnificat was self-defined as \\"A Magnificat and Exaltate for digital orchestra, choral voices, and special electronic images\\"See primary source: HOS, \\"Novus Magnificat\\" (cassette liner notes)See primary source: HOS, \\"Novus Magnificat\\" (compact liner notes) and \\"Dedicated to the Infinite One...\\" The music was performed using the Emulator II, one of the first digital sampling synthesizers available: this provided and combined the sound of real symphonic instruments and choirs under a single keyboard, hooked to a Roland Juno 60 \\"for arpeggiated effects and enhanced sounds\\".See primary source: Demby, \\"The creation of Novus Magnificat\\" Nothing being written down or scored in advance, the album was directly composed and recorded in 1985 by Demby at the keyboard. The music was further enhanced with electronic textures by composer Michael Stearns and refined with record co- producer and label co-founder Anna Turner. The result was termed, \\"Music conjured by the future, rooted in the Western sacred tradition.\\" = Releases = Novus Magnificat was released by Stephen Hill's Hearts of Space Records, first on cassette in 1986,See secondary source: Digital Audio, \\"Constance Demby: Novus Magnificat\\" then on CD in fall 1987 (along a vinyl LP in Japan,See primary source: HOS, \\"Novus Magnificat\\" (vinyl liner notes) licensed to Alfa Records). It was the first of the four Demby albums this label would release or re-release between 1986 and 1995. The album was also broadcast in full on Hill's syndicated radio show Hearts of Space, in program 105 on June 13, 1986.HOS. \\"PGM 105 : Novus Magnificat\\", Hearts of Space at HOS.com In 1987, the last movement of \\"Novus Magnificat, Part One\\" (dubbed \\"My Heart Doth Soar\\") and the first movement of \\"Novus Magnificat, Part Two\\" (dubbed \\"The Flying Bach\\") were selected by Demby for her self-released 1978–1986 best-of compilation Light of This World (cassette and CD versions: the vinyl could only fit \\"The Flying Bach\\"). In 2001, the \\"Hearts of Space\\" label's trademark and catalogue were sold to Valley Entertainment, still distributing the album . In 2008, the CD version was complemented with Novus Magnificat (Alternate Version), a downloadable digital album (MP3 files, 256 kbit/s, released June 6, 2008) with the same music cut in a new track list\\"Novus Magnificat (Alternate Version)\\" (with date and track list) at Amazon of eleven movements. = Genre = Following Demby's previous studio album Sacred Space Music (1984), Novus Magnificat was tagged \\"Sacred Space II\\" (later \\"Sacred Space Series, vol. II\\"). Considered part of the new-age music, the album is described as \\"Contemporary classical Spacemusic\\" in its liner notes, or \\"symphonic space music\\"See secondary source: Wright, \\"Novus Magnificat\\". by Allmusic. Its subtitle \\"Through the Stargate\\" is complemented with a space- themed cover reminiscent of 2001: A Space Odyssey (whose novel version featured a \\"Star Gate\\"). The album is also often ranked among ambient music albums, but Demby once noted \\"Though we are honored, Novus Magnificat is not really 'ambient' \\" on her site. = Reception = USA Today wrote, \\"There is no other recording in the electronic genre rooted in the harmonies of Bach and the romantics that is so heartfelt\\",See primary source: Demby, \\"Novus Magnificat\\" and it was noted for \\"its Bach-like organs crescendos, its Vivaldi-like string passages\\" in Pulse! magazine. Though it was not nominated at the newly created \\"New Age\\" category of the Grammy Awards,Novus Magnificat was released in 1986 and eligible for the 1987 Grammy Awards (alias \\"Grammy Awards for 1986\\"), where a \\"New Age\\" category appeared that year for the first time. Neither the album nor Demby appears on the MetroLyrics list of 1987 Grammy nominations, including the two compilations from Germany's Windham Hill Records, \\"various artists - Windham Hill Records Sampler '86\\" and \\"various artists - A Winter's Solstice\\". (Same for 1985, 1986, 1988, 1989.) No other source checked in June 2009 (including Google News Archive and Google Book Search) could list the album among Grammy nominations. The \\"Grammy nominated\\" claim found on Demby's website since at least 2001 (and in some interviews) may have been a confusion between the album being \\"nominated\\" by its record label to the Grammy academy (as is the regular process) and the actual official list of five Grammy nominees (the one called \\"Grammy nominated\\"). the album sold over 200,000 copies worldwide,See secondary source: Phoenix, \\"Constance Demby: Heavy Metal Thunder\\" making Demby one of the most successful New Age artists of the time, and helped build the reputationHOS. \\"Hearts of Space - Company\\", Hearts of Space at HOS.com: \\"Early releases on Hearts of Space were critically applauded and sold well in the instrumental music market by then swept into the burgeoning New Age category.

Launched in 1928–1929, the vessels were named Osvetnik (Avenger) and Smeli (Daring) in Serbo-Croatian. They were built to a partial double hull Simonot design similar to the French s. The Osvetnik-class was the second class of submarines to serve in the Royal Yugoslav Navy, and joined the two larger British-made s to make up the pre-war Yugoslav submarine force. They were armed with six torpedo tubes, one gun, and one anti-aircraft gun, and could dive to . Prior to World War II both submarines participated in cruises to Mediterranean ports. Both submarines were captured by Italian forces at the Bay of Kotor during the German-led Axis invasion of Yugoslavia in April 1941. After refit, they saw service as experimental and training vessels with the Regia Marina as Francesco Rismondo and Antonio Bajamonti respectively. They were both scuttled in September 1943 following the Italian surrender, Francesco Rismondo by the Germans following her capture, and Antonio Bajamonti by the Italians themselves. Description and construction Yugoslav naval policy in the interwar period lacked direction until the mid-1920s, although it was generally accepted that the Adriatic coastline was effectively a sea frontier that the naval arm was responsible for securing with the limited resources made available to it. In 1926, a modest ten-year construction program was initiated to build up a force of submarines, coastal torpedo boats, torpedo bombers and conventional bomber aircraft to perform this role. The Osvetnik-class submarines were one of the acquisitions aimed at developing a naval force capable of meeting this challenge. The Osvetnik-class was built for the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes (later Yugoslavia) by the Ateliers et Chantiers de la Loire company (ACL) at Nantes, France. Their design was based on a partial double hull design developed by ACL's chief engineer, G. Simonot, which was similar to the French .

Their surfaced displacement was , or submerged, and their crews consisted of 43 officers and enlisted men. They had an operational depth of . For surface running, the Osvetnik-class boats were powered by two MAN (Maschinenfabrik) diesel engines which were rated at that drove two propeller shafts. When submerged, the propellers were driven by two Nancy electric motors generating . They could reach a top speed of on the surface, and on their electric motors when submerged. They were armed with six torpedo tubes (four bow-mounted, two stern-mounted), one gun, and one anti-aircraft gun. On the surface, the boats had a range of at , and at submerged. Service history Smeli was launched on 1 December 1928, and Osvetnik on 14 January 1929. They arrived in the Bay of Kotor on the southern Adriatic coast on 9 December 1929. In 1932, the British naval attaché reported that Yugoslav ships engaged in few exercises, manoeuvres or gunnery training due to reduced budgets. =Osvetnik= First of the class, Osvetnik was involved in a series of visits to Mediterranean ports during the interwar period. She was captured in port by the Italians during the German-led Axis invasion of Yugoslavia. She was refitted and modernised before being commissioned by the Italians as Francesco Rismondo, but was only used for training and experimentation. After the Italian surrender, she was captured then scuttled by the Germans in September 1943. =Smeli= Smeli was the second and last of her class.

It was published by the Columbian Agricultural Society.Kane, p. 13 The publisher was W. A. Rind of Georgetown, Washington, D.C. The editor was a Reverend David Wiley who was a minister that moved to Georgetown in 1800. Rev. Wiley was in charge of the Columbian Agricultural Society and was its secretary and teacher. The society was established for the purpose of inspiring local agriculture manufactures. The magazine was a branch of the society that discouraged imported products. Wiley was Georgetown's postmaster, superintendent of the turnpike, merchant, miller, and the major. Another important editor to the magazine was Joel Barlow. At first the periodical had no subscribers and depended on the society's members. It started as a bi-monthly publication and ran this way for a year. It then switched to being published monthly beginning with Volume 2 and ended after eleven issues of that volume (July 4, 1810 – June 19, 1811), m. (July 1811May 1812.) v.1, no.1-24; v.2, no. 1-11.

Another society member pointed out in his article labeled Roads and Inland Navigation that by raising $300,000 for improving the navigational system of the Potomac and its branches that it would benefit those with agricultural products that needed to be distributed throughout the United States. Another society member named Rinaldo Johnson wrote to the editor on July 30, 1810, after receiving the first two issues, on how happy he was with the publication. He explained in detail his first attempt at making Homespun cloth from wool. He made various clothing articles for his family that he considered as good as \\"British cloth\\".

The editor also incorporated an article labeled \\"On the culture of Potatoes\\" by Bath Papers. The article points out that potatoes are much more desirable for the poor than turnips. The article also points out potatoes are much better for the soil than turnips. Potatoes can also be used to feed cattle and hogs. They also store better than turnips. There is also an extract from a letter showing how to make paper from vegetable materials.

Early life Thurairatnam was born on 10 August 1930. He was educated at Jaffna College, Vaddukoddai. He joined the clerical service at the age of 17 but left soon after to enter the University of Ceylon. Career After graduation he joined the teaching profession. He taught at the Puloly Hindu English School until 1960. Later on he studied at Ceylon Law College and qualified as a lawyer. Thurairatnam joined the Illankai Tamil Arasu Kachchi (Federal Party) soon after it was formed. He stood as the ITAK's candidate in Point Pedro at the 1956 parliamentary election but was defeated by the Communist Party candidate P. Kandiah. He however won the March 1960 parliamentary election and entered Parliament. He was re-elected at the July 1960, March 1965 and May 1970 parliamentary elections. Thurairatnam played a leading role in the 1961 satyagraha campaign organised by ITAK. Early on the morning of 20 February 1961 a group of 55 to 75 persons staged a satyagraha at the Jaffna Kachcheri in Old Park. Among them were ITAK MPs A. Amirthalingam, S. J. V. Chelvanayakam, V. Dharmalingam, V. A. Kandiah, E. M. V. Naganathan, V. N. Navaratnam and Thurairatnam. A large group of policemen arrived in riot gear, wearing helmets and carrying batons and shields. The police started removing the protesters by lifting and carrying them away. Those who resisted were dragged away. Later, as Government Agent M. Srikantha and Superintendent of Police Richard Arndt tried to leave Old Park in a jeep the protesters blocked their way. The police reacted with brutality, beating he protesters with batons and pulled them out bodily. Palaniyappan, a young man who had thrown himself in front of the jeep was pulled away by the police and beaten severely with batons. Five ITAK MPs were amongst the protesters blocking the jeep. Kandiah was carried out and dumped on the ground, Dharmalingam and Thurairatnam were dragged out by their hands and legs whilst Amirthalingam and Naganathan were baton charged. The police also baton charged a crowd of around 5,000 who had gathered to watch the satyagraha. On 14 May 1972 the ITAK, All Ceylon Tamil Congress, Ceylon Workers' Congress, Eelath Thamilar Otrumai Munnani and All Ceylon Tamil Conference formed the Tamil United Front, later renamed Tamil United Liberation Front (TULF). On 21 May 1976 Thurairatnam was delivering leaflets along with other leading Tamil politicians (A. Amirthalingam, V. N. Navaratnam, K. P. Ratnam and M. Sivasithamparam) when they were all arrested on government orders. Sivasithamparam was released but the others were taken to Colombo and tried for sedition. All the defendants were acquitted on 10 February 1977 after a famous trial at bar case in which around 70 leading Tamil lawyers, including S. J. V. Chelvanayakam and G. G. Ponnambalam, acted for the defence. Thurairatnam was the TULF's candidate in Point Pedro at the 1977 parliamentary election and was re-elected. Thurairatnam and all other TULF MPs boycotted Parliament from the middle of 1983 for a number of reasons: they were under pressure from Sri Lankan Tamil militants not to stay in Parliament beyond their normal six-year term; the Sixth Amendment to the Constitution of Sri Lanka required them to swear an oath unconditionally renouncing support for a separate state; and the Black July riots in which up to 3,000 Tamils were murdered by Sinhalese mobs. After three months of absence, Thurairatnam forfeited his seat in Parliament on 5 January 1984. Thurairatnam died on 23 September 1995.

It lies about north of Bergen on the B 3 federal road and currently has 579 inhabitants. It is administratively responsible for the neighbouring hamlet of Dageförde.  History  Bleckmar was first mentioned in the records in 866 under the name of Blecmeri. This farming village originally grew from two farms, but by 1820 it had a population of 150. This number grew to over 300 inhabitants in 1900. In 1910 Bleckmar was given a railway halt on the Celle–Soltau railway which now ran through the village. Street names were not introduced in Bleckmar until 2001 after the majority of inhabitants voted in favour of them. The River Meiße, which flows in a north-south direction through Bleckmar, was dammed to form a pond here used to power a corn mill. The old mill building has now been restored and converted into a residential property. Dageförde is a small farm hamlet where there are timber-framed farmhouses with ornate decorations, as well as typical heathland barns - the Treppenspeicher - from the 18th century.  Politics  Since the merging of local councils as part of the Lower Saxon administrative reforms of 1971, Bleckmar has been part of the town of Bergen. Bleckmar is represented by a parish council (Ortsrat) and a chairman (Ortsbürgermeister). The council is empowered, inter alia, to make decisions about public services in the village, is responsible for maintaining the appearance of the village and for overseeing its clubs and societies, and has to be consulted by the town of Bergen on all important matters affecting the village.Information about the Lower Saxony Community Constitution It consists of five elected representatives who, together with the mayor, sit on the Bergen town council. The parish council elects its own mayor. The current incumbent is Elisabeth Tasto-Iseken.  Mission work  Lutheran Church Mission, vicarage and St. John's Church Since 1892 there has been a Lutheran church mission in Bergen- Bleckmar. The Independent Evangelical-Lutheran Church (SELK) is the sponsor of this mission. Mission work is led by the current head of mission, Markus Nietzke. It has sent missionaries in South Africa, Botswana, Brazil, Australia and Germany. It has its own seminary in which missionaries are trained.

Life She was the daughter of Henry V of Luxembourg and Margaret of Bar. Isabelle was a member of the House of Luxembourg. Isabelle was the third of seven children. =Marriage= In March 1265, Isabelle married Guy of Dampierre. Her marriage was determined by events that occurred many years before her birth. Indeed, around 1165, her great-grandfather Henry IV the Blind, Count of Namur and Luxembourg, had no children from his first marriage. He named his brother Baldwin IV of Hainaut as his successor. Baldwin died in 1171, and Henry the Blind confirmed his nephew Baldwin V of Hainaut. But with one more attempt to have children, Henry the blind married his second wife, Agnes of Gelderland, who bore a daughter, Ermesinde and thus had broken the promise he had made to Baldwin. A war ensued, with the result that Baldwin would be Henry's designated heir in Namur. Isabelle's father claimed his rights of Namur, being son of Ermesinde. Henry V failed on his claim to rule Namur. Isabelle's parents wanted to make peace with Guy over a dispute of Namur. Isabelle became Guy's second wife; his first wife, Matilda had died one year earlier. Guy already had eight children with Matilda. Guy arranged a marriage between their daughter Philippa and Edward, Prince of Wales. However, Philip IV of France imprisoned Guy and two of his sons, forced him to call off the marriage, and imprisoned Philippa in Paris until her death in 1306. Guy was summoned before the king again in 1296, and the principal cities of Flanders were taken under royal protection until Guy paid an indemnity and surrendered his territories, to hold them at the grace of the king. Isabelle died in the September 1298, and her husband six years later, in 1304.

The album was re-released on CD by Verve in 1992, with two additional takes of \\"Tea for Two\\". The sessions also appear on The Complete Bud Powell on Verve (1994) box set. History The two sessions mark Powell's fourth recording date as leader, following on from the February 1950 session for Jazz Giant. The three takes of \\"Tea for Two\\" at the start of the CD release recall the classic 1955 LP release of The Amazing Bud Powell, which opens with three takes of \\"Un Poco Loco\\". Although the three versions here don't display the cumulative explorations of the \\"Un Poco Loco\\" takes, the sheer velocity and attack on each is remarkable. Powell's composition \\"Parisian Thoroughfare\\", a \\"classic bop vehicle\\", has been recorded by several other artists, most notably the Clifford Brown and Max Roach quintet in 1954 (Clifford Brown & Max Roach), featuring Bud's brother Richie Powell on piano.

Thrill the World is an annual international dance event and world record breaking attempt, in which participants simultaneously emulate the zombie dance seen in the music video of Michael Jackson's \\"Thriller\\". The dancers perform in unison at locations throughout the world, and can range from pre-teens to the elderly. Ines Markeljevic created the event \\"Thrill Toronto\\" where she taught a group of 62 zombies the dance in a mere couple of hours and they set the first Guinness World Records for Largest Thriller Dance in one location, at a community hall in Canada. Ines Markeljevic is dance instructor and entrepreneur from Toronto, Canada, whose personal mission is to unite the world through dance. Following the Guinness World Record setting event in Toronto, Canada in 2006, Ines Markeljevic launched Thrill The World in 2007. 1,722 people in 80 cities from 17 different countries participated in the event. Donations were made during the Irvine, California dance to the American Red Cross, who used the money to aid victims of the October 2007 California wildfires. The year after, Thrill the World returned for its second event, in which 91 venues from 13 different countries participated. The event coincided with the 25th anniversary of Jackson's album Thriller. The event takes place every year on the Saturday preceding Halloween. Background The idea to create an international event, in which participants simultaneously emulate the zombie dance in the music video of Michael Jackson's \\"Thriller\\", came about in 2006. At the time, a group of 62 zombies set a Guinness World Record for Largest Thriller Dance in one location, at a community hall in Canada. The event garnered worldwide attention. The world record, however, was subsequently broken, when 1722 people from 52 cities on five different continents emulated Jackson's zombie dance. The event—part-charity fundraiser, part-world record attempt—evolved into Thrill the World, one of the world's largest simultaneous dance events. Ines Markeljevic, a dance instructor, aimed to unite the world in dance and followed this event up with Thrill Toronto. The popularity of the event spread, and it visited Croatia, Honduras, New Zealand, the Philippines and Sierra Leone. The majority of people discovered Thrill the World through their official website and YouTube, where Markeljevic posted instructional step by step videos on the Thriller dance. Markeljevic stated that she chose Thriller because it has a special hold on people. \\"Regardless of where people are in the world, they love Thriller, they want to do the dance.\\" Events =2006= On Sunday, October 29, 2006, Thrill Toronto’s 62 zombies officially set the first Guinness World Record for “Largest Thriller Dance!” (in one location) =2007= Thrill the World's official website expected the 2007 event to include 60 separate dancing events in 15 different countries. On the day of the performance, October 27, 2007, it was revealed that 1,722 people in 80 cities from 17 different countries had actually participated. The dancers in Irvine, California's event ranged from teenagers to women in their late 50s. One female participant danced to \\"Thriller\\" with her 4 ½-month daughter strapped to her waist. Another participant, 57-year-old Valerie Cardinal, wore a lime-green wig and scary makeup. \\"This is more fun than ballet\\", she proclaimed. \\"It's life affirming, even though it's about death.\\" The Irvine event was organized by resident Tom Nguyen and dance instructor Jeremy Heckman. The pair arranged rehearsals and the main show in two weeks, upon hearing that a Canadian dance instructor was aiming for the \\"Largest Simultaneous Thriller Dance\\" world record. During the event, Nguyen and Heckman collected donations for the American Red Cross, which would then be used to aid victims of the October 2007 California wildfires. One of the wildfire victims, 26-year-old Kim Deans, participated in Irvine's \\"Thrill the World\\" event. At the time, Deans had been evacuated from her home and not allowed back. She later spoke of the escapism in performing at the event. \\"It's a break – a physical and mental break. It was either this or Disneyland.\\" =2008= Thrill the World 2008 in Austin, Texas 4,179 people in 91 venues from 13 different countries participated in the 2008 Thrill the World dance. Thrill the World 2008 featured Australia participating for the first time. Their Brisbane event was coordinated by Andrew Curnock, a Queensland University of Technology tutor and gaming software sound engineer. The tutor sought to have Australia join the dance event after watching a viral video of prison inmates dancing to \\"Thriller\\". \\"We basically came across that viral video that featured a bunch of (prison) inmates performing the Thriller dance\\", Curnock revealed. \\"One YouTube clip really just led to another and that's how we found out about Thrill the World and recognised the potential to get involved locally.\\" Participants went through weeks of dance classes and costume preparation before the event, although Curnock added that those involved didn't have to be great dancers. \\"It's more about getting out there and getting involved.\\" Curnock stated that he hoped Thrill the World wouldn't be a passing fad for Brisbane, but would be a permanent fixture on their social calendar. The 2008 event, which coincided with the 25th anniversary of Thriller, also had Austin, Texas participate in their record break attempt. Texan artist Shawn Sides oversaw the rehearsals for the Austin dance. Some classes drew more than 200 people at a time. Sides became interested in the event after watching a commercial featuring lizards emulating the Thriller choreography. \\"I realized that Thriller is like the national choreography of the United States\\", Sides explained. \\"I'm so excited that there's this choreography in the world that our entire nation recognizes.\\" Indiana Adams, who also helped with the Austin dance, remembered being so obsessed with Thriller as a child that she started to tell people her mother had been one of the zombies in the video. \\"It was just the most amazing choreography a 4-year- old had ever seen\\", Adams added. =2009= Thrill the World 2009 in Västerås, Sweden Thrill the World 2009 in Toronto, Ontario Thrill The World 2009 was performed on October 24/25.

Kupetzky moves through time and space in a bizarre and surreal universe. In the beginning of the show you see Kupetzky in a black cadillac driving on the street. A woman's voice called \\"Carla\\" is screaming \\"Krrrupetky\\" from the radio receiver, whereas Kupetzky corrects his name most of the time.

No matter what problem one of his clients has got, whether you suffer from insomnia, you are trying to establish a new religion or your parachute won't open - he can solve it. The figure of Kupetzky is in the style of movie characters such as \\"Mr Fix It\\" (Wag the Dog) and \\"Mr Wolf\\" (Pulp Fiction). The background music consists mainly of songs by Elvis, who appears to be Kupetky's role model.  Visual appearance  The show is characterised by fast cuts and soft tracking shots.

It is under the de facto control of Northern Cyprus. Lysi is also the administration center for the villages of Beyarmudu, Paşaköy, Pile and Vadili. In 1960, there were 3,700 Greek Cypriots living in the village and approximately 6,000 in 1974, when they all fled because of the Turkish invasion and the subsequent partition of the island. The arrival of Turkish settlers from mainland Turkey and of Turkish Cypriots displaced from other villages in South Cyprus changed the demographics of the village. In the centre of the village there is a late 19th-century Greek Orthodox church, covered in a thick layer of Gothic decoration copied from the great medieval cathedrals of Famagusta and Nicosia. The church was built by the inhabitants of Lysi who volunteered their work over several years. After the Turkish occupation of Lysi the church was looted, all its Christian icons and other Christian interior decorations were removed and was turned into a mosque. The diminutive 14th-century church of St. Evphemianos, 2 km southwest of the village, enjoys a lonely position, shaded by a clump of eucalyptus just above a water course. This small church depicted some of the most beautiful and well-preserved Byzantine mosaics found on the island of Cyprus. The mosaics were later purchased by the Menil Foundation in Texas, USA on behalf of the Church of Cyprus and have been on long-term loan to the Menil ever since. The loan agreement came to an end in February 2012. West of the village, 2 km along the tarmac road to Arsos village, there is a distinctive hillock capped with rounded boulders. Halfway down its southern face is a Greek Archaic nympheum, a small natural cave that archaeologists found filled with votive statuettes. The silhouette of the sibyl's hill hovers as a visual echo of the Pentadaktylos mountains on the northern horizon. About 4 km further west along this road, the other side of Arsos, is the hamlet of Tremetousia, the site of Richard the Lion Heart’s victory over Isaac Comnenus. The ruinous church and the buildings on the northern edge are the remains of an 18th-century rebuilding of the ancient monastery of St Spyridon. The remains of the saint lay buried here for a few centuries before being removed to Constantinople, and eventually to the island of Corfu.

Richardson gained fame during her high school career at Rochelle High School (total enrollment 59) when, as both a junior (2008) and senior (2009), she (as the only state qualifier from her school) single- handedly won the UIL Class A girls team track championship, notwithstanding that as the only qualifier she could not compete in relay events, which under UIL scoring rules count double the points of individual events. High school career Under the University Interscholastic League track and field scoring system, points are awarded to the top six finishers using a 10-8-6-4-2-1 scale (10 for first place, and so on) for individual events. Relay events are scored by doubling the points for each place. An individual can compete in a maximum of five events (individual or relay). Richardson could not practice the long jump at Rochelle High School as it does not have usable facilities. To train, she used the school's track, which \\"is made of dirt, grass, weeds, rocks, red- ant mounds and ruts...a trench from an old water line [to] hurdle, goats and a llama grazing beside it, armadillos and deer pattering across it\\", and nearby Brady High School's all-weather running track. =2006= As a freshman, Richardson qualified for the state track meet (held at Myers Stadium on the University of Texas campus) in the discus (an event in which she would eventually qualify all four years), taking seventh place (103 feet 10 inches; 31.65 metres). =2007= She qualified for the state track meet in the discus, high jump, and long jump. She placed fourth in the discus (114 feet 2 inches; 34.80 metres), sixth in the high jump (5 feet 0 inches; 1.52 metres) and captured the title in the long jump (18 feet 10 inches; 5.74 metres), earning a total of 15 points. Rochelle had one other qualifier, who finished in sixth place in her event for one point. The 16 points placed Rochelle in a tie for 12th place in the final team standings. =2008= Richardson qualified in the discus, high jump, long jump, 100 metres, and 200 metres. The other two girls on her track team did not qualify in any state events. On the first day of competition, Richardson won the high jump (5 feet 5 inches; 1.65 metres), placed second in the long jump (18 feet 7 inches; 5.77 metres), and third in the discus (121 feet; 36.88 metres). She earned 24 points, enough to take the school lead. On the second day, Richardson won the 200 metres (25.03 seconds) and was second in the 100 metres (12.19 seconds), losing by one- hundredth of a second. The additional 18 points gave her (and Rochelle) a total of 42, six ahead of second place teams Chilton and Seymour, neither of which had any chance of overtaking her in the relays. Richardson's performance would have tied for second in Class 2A and placed sixth in Class 3A. Richardson became the first female, and only the third person, to singlehandedly win a Texas state team title, joining James Segrest (Class 2A Bangs in 1954) and Frank Pollard (Class B Meridian in 1976). Her success caused other schools' coaches to call asking how to also obtain a \\"caliche\\" training surface. Richardson became one of the most-recruited high school female athletes in Texas history, with Arizona State, Nebraska, Texas Christian, Texas Tech, Texas A&M;, Arkansas, and many other Division 1 universities showing interest. In the fall, she signed a letter of intent with Texas A&M.; =2009= As a senior, Richardson comprised the entire Rochelle girls' track team, and qualified for the same five events as in 2008. On the first day, she recaptured her 2007 title in the long jump (17 feet 4.50 inches; 5.30 metres), defended her title in the high jump (5 feet 8 inches; 1.73 metres), and placed second in the discus (126 feet 9 inches; 38.63 metres; her best state placement in this event). Once again, her point total (28) put Rochelle in first place after one day. On the second day, Richardson placed third in the 200 metres (25.78 seconds) and fourth in the 100 metres (12.51 seconds). Her 38 points were two better than second-place Cayuga High School. Cayuga had a chance to win the overall team award by placing fifth or better in the final relay race (or tie Rochelle with a sixth-place finish), but finished in seventh. The accomplishment made Richardson the only person in Texas high school track and field history (male or female) to single-handedly win the team title more than once. Other accomplishments In addition to her track exploits, Richardson was named the Class A Division II high school basketball player of the year and led her team to the 2008 Class A Division II state semifinals. She was the valedictorian of her class of 14 and President of the Rochelle High chapter of the National Honor Society.

Proposals The Sandler report suggested that there are three main reasons why the industry seemed to be failing to serve large portions of the population. The government is particularly worried about so called savings gap, i.e. the failure to provide adequate funds for their retirement. The report cited: *The complexity and opacity of many financial services; *The failure of the industry to attract and engage with the majority of lower- and middle – income consumers; *The inability of consumers to drive the market. Ron Sandler suggested the development of a suite of simple, low-cost, risk- controlled products. The name “Stakeholder” was given to those products, although they are still referred to as Sandler products. The maximum level of charge permitted per annum for the investment products was set at 1.5% for the first 10 years of the life of the product and 1% thereafter. For stakeholder pensions arranged prior to 6 April 2005, charges are capped at 1% throughout. The suite of stakeholder products includes five types of products: *A cash deposit product, similar to a cash ISA. The interest rate will be within 1% of the Bank Of England base rate, and the minimum deposit is no more than £10; *A medium-term investment product, related to collective investment schemes such as unit trusts and OEICs; *A smoothed investment fund ( a with-profits-type fund); *The stakeholder pension; *The Child Trust Fund. Controlling the risk is also important. This is achieved by limiting the proportion of shares in the stakeholder unit-linked and with-profit products to 60% of the funds. The remainder must be invested in fixed-interest securities and cash. A simplified selling model applies to these products, with the exception of the smoothed investment. The rules are included in the Conduct of Business sourcebook, and can be summarised as follows: *The adviser must explain the nature of stakeholder products and must make clear that only basic advice will be given ; *The sale process will be based on a series of short scripted questions in plain language; *The assessment of suitability for a product will be based only on information disclosed by the questions and will not involve a detailed assessment of the customer's needs but: **The customer's savings and investment objectives should be ascertained; **The customer's willingness to accept risk should be ascertained, as this may determine which product might be suitable. The process must be terminated at any stage if: *The customer requests it; *The adviser believes there is no likelihood of any stakeholder products being suitable; or *It appears that the customer is unlikely to be able to afford a stakeholder product *An assessment should be made of the customer's other financial needs and priorities, and if necessary the customer should be clearly informed of the desirability of meeting the other priorities first: *If the customer appears to be “significantly” in debt, a stronger warning should be given ; *Additional rules apply to stakeholder pensions, which should not be recommended if the adviser believes there are better options for the customer.

PSJC dispatches fifteen agencies to approximately 304,000 incidents a year, with over 69,800 being 911 calls. History The Columbia/Boone County Public Safety Joint Communications Center has been in existence since 1977. From a modest beginning, in which communications assets of four agencies were donated to begin operation as a joint communications center, the organization has undergone many changes. In 1983, work was begun on a majo upgrade to the original center. Renovations included replacing the outdated radio consoles in the pre-existing center with new consoles and radios, duplicating each console for future expansion. A radar system was installed to better assist in tracking weather and a separate console was installed for ham radio operators to staff during disaster situations. The enhanced 9-1-1 (E-911) system was installed in the fall of 1986. The funds for the system were provided by a tax bill, with each tax payer in Boone County paying approximately $2.25 additional on their phone bill to pay for the system. This system allows each 9-1-1 call to automatically be traced to the location it originated from. It also allowed for special information about that location such as directions, medical related information, or any information the resident feels is important to immediately be available for the operator receiving the call. A new CAD (Computer-Aided Dispatch) computer was placed on line on September 21, 1993. The new system allows both fire and medical calls to be dispatched by computer as well as law calls. The CAD was also integrated with the 9-1-1 system the Missouri Uniform Law Enforcement System (MULES). This made PSJC a completely automated center. In the spring of 1999 a mobile data terminal system was installed allowing placement of lap top computer terminals in Columbia Police Department, Columbia Fire Department, and Boone County Fire District vehicles that are linked to the dispatch computer mainframe at the Communications Center. In 2004 an integrated GIS mapping system that automatically maps 911 calls was installed and placed online. In 2000, the current Columbia/Boone County Public Safety Joint Communications Center was built, sitting at the corner of Seventh and Walnut streets, in the same building as the Columbia Police Department's headquarters. In October 2009, Zim Schwartze, a Columbia Police Department captain, was selected to head the Public Safety/Joint Communications Center. Captain Schwartze had headed the 911 call center on an interim basis since the former director Jim McNabb stepped down in May. Training Trainees receive 6 months of training, receiving American Heart Association Certification in CPR and obtaining certification as Emergency Medical Dispatchers. Each trainee also receives certification from the Missouri Highway Patrol-Missouri Uniform Law Enforcement System (MULES), and several other dispatch programs. Upon completion of classroom training, they are assigned to a field training officer to complete their training.

Manabendra was born in Kolkata on 11 August 1929. His father's name was Atulchandra Mukhopadhay. It is considered that during the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s the Bengali modern songs reached its peak of excellence and that period is usually called the \\"Golden age of Bengali Adhunik Songs\\". At that time Bengal had a unique mix of singers which inspired composers and lyricists to create innumerable treasure of creative music. Each singer had his own inimitable style and compositions were made to match their individual ability. Bengali non-film modern songs were in fact was as popular, if not more, than film songs which also reached a level of popularity in the 1950s and 1960s. Coming to limelight in the early 1950s Manabendra was an innovative and stylish singer who had a strong foundation in Indian classical music. With his distinctive voice, Manabendra was an instant hit with the audience. demonstrating great talent also as a composer, using the lyrics and melody of a song with good effect. At that time Bengali modern song world had the presence of some outstanding performers like Dhananjay Bhattacharya, Manna Dey, Satinath Mukherjee, Akhilbandhu Ghosh, Hemanta Mukhopadhyay to name a few. Early music career He started his Music Talim from his uncle Ratneshwar Mukherjee( Sangeet Ratnakar, Sangeet Acharya, Sangeet Prabhakar).Being inspired by uncle Sidheshwar Mukherjee and Ratneswar Mukherjee, Manabendra impressed the listeners with his first basic disc in 1953, titled Nai chondon Lekha Sriradhar chokhe nai nai shyamo rai. He released his two records nameed ’Phire Dekho Na’ and ‘Janina Tumi Kothay’ in association with HMV. The lyrics were written by Sidheswar Mukhopadhay. It was based on keertan andaz, and Manabendra was trained towards Keertans, Bhajans and Bhaktigeeti from the very early childhood. His uncles were trained classical experts and mainly due to their influence he came into the world of music. A number of his songs began to hit the airwaves including the romantic \\"Emni Kore Porbe Mone\\" (Lyrics -Shyamal Gupta), and semi classically bent \\"Ghumayona Saheli Go\\". Within a short span, Manabendra drew the attention of the erstwhile leading music composers of Bengal, namely Salil Chowdhury, Sudhin Dasgupta, Robin Chatterji, Anol Chatterji, Nochiketa Ghosh, Probir Mojumdar, Gyan Prakash Ghosh, Abhijeet Banerjee, and others. His successful songs include \\"Ami Parini bujhite parini\\",and 'Jodi Jante' composed by Salil Chowdhury, \\"Mayur Konthi Ratero nile\\" and \\"Tari Churite Je Rekhechhi Mon Shona Kore by Sudhin Dasgupta\\", 'Jodi Amake Dekho Tumi Udashi' and 'Sei Chokh Kothai Tomar' by Abhijit Banerjee, \\"Ei neel nirjan sagore\\" by Probir Majumdar, \\"Birohini Chiro Birohini\\" by Himangshu Dutta, \\"Bone Noy Mone Mor\\", 'Aha Na roy Na' by Dr. Nachiketa Ghosh, \\"Tomar Pother Prante Moner monideep jele rekhechi\\" and 'Tumi Phiraye Diyechho Bole' by Satinath Mukherjee. His own compositions also continued to grab the attention of audience like \\"Ami Eto Je Tomai Bhalobesechhi\\", \\"Sei Bhalo Ei Basanta Noi\\" (1960) 'Rimjhim Baje Manjira Kar' 'Kato Asha Niye Tumi Esechhile' etc. The former became a huge hit and is cherished by audience even today. The proof of this is in the fact that many audio compilations from HMV still includes this song and it is played by many radio stations. Manobendra Mukhopadhyay was also a great scholar in the songs of Kazi Nazrul Islam. He trained himself not only being inspired by his uncles, but he had a great enthusiasm also in Nazrul's songs being trained from Angurbala Devi, Indubala Devi, who were directly schooled in Nazrul's songs from Kazida in 1929–1942. Manobendra is the first man, who scored in his disc record of Nazrul's songs as Nazrulgeeti in mid-sixties of last century. So many Nazrulgeeti lured in his vocal expression and charmed the people of Bengal as well as Indians like, \\"Bagichay Bulbuli Tui\\", \\"Musafeer Mochh Re Ankhi Jol\\", \\"Akul Holi Keno\\", \\"Britha Tui Kahar Pare\\", \\"Aamar Nayone Krishno Nayantara\\", \\"Arunkanti Ke Go\\" etc., mainly based on the basic Indian raagas in classical touch. An enormous effort was achieved from his Nazrulgeeti, which may be considered as an Institution. Film career Manabendra made a debut in the film arena by becoming the music director for Uttam Kumar's film Chapadangar Bou, (1954), where the songs were written by eminent writer Tarashankar Bandopadhyay. Before this he did a cameo in Uttam Kumar starrer film Sharey Chuattor and also sang a song in it. In Chapadangar Bou Manabendra brought in the flavour of Mahadev's Gajon, that are sung in villages in Bengal with the song 'Shibo He Shibo He'. According to Manabendra (in an old television interview) he gave his audition as a music director at Tarashankar's house as the writer wanted to hear the tunes. The song mentioned earlier was composed at his house on spot. In 1958, Robin Chattopadhyay composed music for a film titled 'Lalu Bhulu', the story of two handicapped boys. The film was highly successful in Bengal and Manabendra sang these songs with great efficiency. 'Jar Hiya akasher nil nilimay', 'Dukho amar Shesh kore dao probhu', 'Surjo tomar Sonaar toron kholo', 'Dukher pothe naai jodi', 'Ei pran jharona jaglo. The lyrics were penned by Sailen Ray. In another film 'Nilachale Mahaprabhu' celebrated composer Raichand Boral invited him to sing kirtans of Lord Chaitanya and the song 'Jagannath Jagat Bandhu' made the audiences spellbound. However, Manabendra credits a song in 'Nabajanma'-Ore mon majhi'to be his first hit in films. Manobendra himself composed music in a number of Bengali films including 'Mayamrigo'(1960), 'Badhu'(1962), 'Jato Mat Tato Path', 'Joy Jayanti', (1970), 'Godhuli Belay', (1965), 'Sudur niharika', (1978) etc. Due to Manabendra's classical potential composers showed the courage of composing pure classical numbers in Bengali films like 'Rajoni pohale sojoni kothay' by Anil Bagchi in the film 'Shashibabur Sangsar', (1960), 'Andhare' by Gyan Prokash Ghosh in the film Basant Bahar, (1958). Later years In the 1970s also, Manabendra had sung notable songs like 'Ei Ganga ei Padda' (1970), ‘Halka megher palki', 'Hajar jonom dhore', 'Oi moushumi mon shudhu rong bodlai', etc. In the 1980s Manabendra concentrated on Nazrul geeti and Bag bajarer gaan and there also emerged as a winner. Manabendra Mukherjee's songs in Bagbajarer gaan include the creations of late eighteenth century written by Bhola Moira, Khirod Prasad, Girish Chandra Ghosh etc., titled \\"Bagbajarer Sidheswarir Annopurnar Ghat\\",\\"Bandhona Torikhani\\", \\"Jaigo Oi Bajae Bashi Pran Kemon Kore\\",\\"Ki Diye Pujibo Bolo Ki Achhe Amar\\", etc. He portrayed the style of singing that used to be exhibited 100 years back at the shore of Ganges in Kolkata. The songs show the other dimension of Manabendra Mukherjee. He died on 19 January 1992. According to many, Manabendra Mukhopadhyay did not get the recognition he deserved which happened to a number of classical singers during the golden age. Personal life He had married to Bela Mukhopadhyay and he was father to Manasi Mukhopadhyay, who is a singer in her own rights at present. She was born in the year 1966.

The design eventually chosen was that of the family jeweller Mellerio. The trophy has a wide aperture, bordered with vine leaves and decorated with two swan-shaped handles. The trophy is housed in the office of the president of the FFT, and is only removed once every year when the Men's Singles winner at the French open is announced. The winner does not get to keep the actual trophy; a new replica is produced every year that the player gets to keep. The replica, which is always smaller than the original that is displayed during the trophy ceremony, is made from a sheet of solid silver, and takes over one hundred hours to complete. Rafael Nadal won the 50th year Open era anniversary French Open title. The original trophy weighs around 14 kg, is 21 cm high and 19 cm wide. The female equivalent of La Coupe des Mousquetaires, awarded to the winner of the Women's Singles competition, is the Coupe Suzanne Lenglen. A one time full-size replica of the Coupe des Mousquetaires was awarded to Rafael Nadal for his 10th win of the French Open in June 2017. It is the same exact made as the original trophy, with the only difference being the original trophy's marble base substituted for a simple black coloured base with a different inscription: on the base of Nadal's trophy is the title 'Decima' meaning 'Tenth' in Spanish and below it listing of all of Nadal's French Open titles up to that date (2005-08, 2010-14, 2017). Nadal went on to win an eleventh title in 2018, this marked the 50th year of the Open era in professional tennis, which started at the 1968 French Open. The replica trophy that Nadal took home for this special anniversary was also larger than the usual replica, while still being smaller than the original that comes out during trophy ceremony.

Design The church hall with the pipe organ The building was designed by city architect Hans van Petersom. It has a classical style facade on the Amstel with a length 102 m, at the time the longest facade of Amsterdam. It has a symmetric map with a large courtyard. Around two secondary courtyard lie wings with rooms for the ladies: the chambrettes. The centrally located monumental entrance leads to a fake door. The mayors at the time found an entrance with steps a necessity for a building of such stature. Directly behind the door is the church hall, which could not serve as entrance. Above the door the original name \\"Diaconate Old Women's Home anno 1681\\" () is written. Retirement home Two women working in the kitchen At its opening in 1682 the home accommodated 400 ladies. Men weren't allowed until 1817. In order to qualify, women had to be at least 50 years of age, a resident of Amsterdam for 15 years and member of the church for 10 years.

It is located in the former municipality Postribë in the Shkodër County. At the 2015 local government reform it became part of the municipality Shkodër. The ruined 13th Century Drisht Castle is on a hilltop 800m above sea level. The ruins of the castle itself contains the remains of 11 houses, and below the ruins of the castle, and above the modern village of Drisht are further archeological remains of late-Roman and medieval Drivastum.  History  The settlement of Drivastum is known to have existed before the tenth century AD. The Diocese of Drivastum became a suffragan of the Archdiocese of Antivari in 1089, after it was transferred from the Archdiocese of Ragusa.Historical dictionary of Albania - Page 118 Robert Elsie - 2010 \\"DRISHT. Archeological site, medieval fortress, and village in the mountains above the Kir valley east of Shkodra. In the ninth century, Drisht (medieval Drivastum,...\\" In 1081—1116 Drivastum belonged to the kingdom of Duklja. In 1183, Serbian Stefan Nemanja conquered Drivast and its surroundings. In 1241, the city was plundered by Tatars as they were advancing east across Zeta while heading home. Scholars estimate that Drivast was taken by the Balšići ca. spring of 1362. However, it is known that by 1363, they had captured Drivast and nearby Scutari. In 1393, Đurađ II Balšić, having negotiated his freedom from Ottoman captivity, submitted to the Great Sultan's suzerainty and surrendered Drivast, Sveti Srđ and Scutari. However, Đurađ soon ended his vassalage to the Ottomans and reconquered the cities he had surrendered mere months before. In 1395, knowing he could not outlast an Ottoman attack, he handed these cities, including Drivast, to dogal Venice in exchange for 1,000 ducats yearly. In 1399, the townspeople in Drivasto (the city's new Italian name) and Scutari started a revolt against Venice, angered at the high taxes they were paying. The revolt lasted for three years, when Venetian troops managed to control the situation. However, the areas surrounding Drivast and Scutari no longer recognized Venetian authority. Angered by Venice's policy on his former lands and its trade monopoly policy that caused an economic stagnation in his ports, Đurađ II sent troops to his former lands, including Drivast, breaking his peace treaty with Venice. Đurađ's actions led to Venice believing that he had a major role in the uprising's initiation. Scholars are unsure whether this accusation is accurate. The Turks also decided to send raiding parties to these rebellious lands. In 1423 Đurađ Branković conquered Drivast and annexed it to Serbian Despotate. Supported by Ottomans, Gojčin Crnojević and Little Tanuš Dukađin, Maramonte plundered region around Scutari and Ulcinj and attacked Drivast in 1429, but failed to capture it. In August 1442, Venice took Drivast from Serbian Despot Đurađ Branković. Native citizens of Drivast were hostile toward advances of Albanians and Serbs so they accepted Venetian suzerainty only under condition that Venice wouldn't employ Albanian pronoiers and to return to the city land Serbian despot gave to Serbs. In 1447, Skanderbeg demanded from the Venetians to give control over Drivast to him, along with the lands which earlier belonged to Lekë Zakarija. However, the Venetians refused to accept his demands and Skanderbeg started the war against Venice. In March 1451 Lekë Dukagjini and Božidar Dushmani planned to attack Venetian controlled Drivast. Their plot was discovered and Božidar was forced to exile. In September 1478, Drivast was captured by the Ottomans.  Ecclesiastical History  The bishopric was founded around 400 AD, as a suffragan of its Late Roman province Dalmatia Superior's capital Doclea's Metropolitan bishop. Drivastum became a suffragan of the Archdiocese of Antivari in 1089, after it was transferred from the Archdiocese of Ragusa.Historical dictionary of Albania - Page 118 Robert Elsie - 2010 \\"DRISHT.

The Thirteen Assyrian Fathers () were, according to Georgian church tradition, a group of monastic missionaries who arrived from Mesopotamia to Georgia to strengthen Christianity in the country in the 6th century. They are credited by the Georgian church historians with the foundation of several monasteries and hermitages and initiation of the ascetic movement in Georgia.Rapp, Stephen H. (2003), Studies in Medieval Georgian Historiography: Early Texts And Eurasian Contexts, p. 321. Peeters Publishers, Lang, David Marshall (1956), Lives and Legends of the Georgian Saints, pp. 81-83. London: Allen & Unwin The lives of the Assyrian Fathers are related in a cycle of medieval Georgian hagiographic texts and are unattested beyond these sources. Some of these vitae are formalities composed for an 18th-century synaxary, but four of them exist in original form, as well a metaphrastic version. The dating as well as authorship of these texts is controversial. The Georgian Catholicoi Arsen I (830-87) and Arsen II (955-80) have been suggested as authors of some of the vitae. Other, unattributed, texts may have been composed earlier, in the late 7th century.Rayfield, Donald (2000), The Literature of Georgia: A History, pp. 50-51. Routledge, . Many monasteries in modern Georgia are named after the Assyrian Fathers and are said to have been founded and led by them and their numerous disciples. In the Middle Ages, these religious foundations played an important role in forging Georgian Christian identity. Tradition, written and oral, names as many as 19 Assyrian monks active in Georgia in the 6th century and the number \\"13\\" seems to be largely symbolic. Modern scholarly opinion is divided as to whether they were Assyrians, Assyrian-educated Georgians, whether missionaries or refugees — monophysite or diophysite — from Syria, from which monophysitism had retreated while Georgia was still primarily monophysite at that time.

Lord Denning MR affirmed that where agreements concern the acquisition of rights over land, there is no need for both parties to provide a consideration for upholding the bargain. While promissory estoppel cannot found a cause of action it was held that in the peculiar situation of land, consideration is not necessary at all. Facts In 1965 Mr Victor Crabb bought 2 acres of land in the sea-side village of Pagham, near Bognor Regis. His boundary onto acres to the west, demarcated by publicly owned Mill Park Road, belonged to Arun District Council (ADC) (formerly Chichester Rural District Council). His north boundary faced Hook Lane. He thought he enjoyed two access points on Mill Park Road, which led up to Hook Lane, and out of the village, point \\"A\\" and point \\"B\\". The access point \\"A\\" was open by virtue of a formalised easement, granted when the previous owner of the whole acres had sold the property on to the current owners, Access point \\"B\\" was open only because the council was letting Crabb use it, with no formal written agreement in place. In February 1968 ADC put up gates at point \\"A\\" and \\"B\\". Crabb believing that he had assurances to use both gates, sold off the northern half of the land, where access point \\"A\\" was. For the southern half of the land, he relied on having access point \\"B\\" open. In January 1969 he secured the inside of the gate at point \\"B\\" with padlocks. ADC responded by replacing the gates with a fence. Crabb asked for to access point to be re-opened. ADC said they would in return for £3000. Crabb subsequently sued the council, alleging that he had been given an assurance that the gates would remain open. The trial judge found that Crabb had received no formal or firm assurance, but more importantly, if there was, Crabb had given no consideration in return for it, and it was not enforceable. Crabb appealed the decision. Judgment Lord Denning MR held that the promise could be enforced, and that a right of access over ADC's land be made way for. it was also ruled it may have been appropriate for Crabb to pay some amount for the cost of the works in relation to the erection and removal of the fence, but in view of the fact that the land had been unusable for the five or six years the fence had been in place, Crabb had no financial liability in relation to the costs related to the fence being erected or removed.

Chrysler LLC was a lawsuit brought in United States federal court June 2009 by several pension funds against Chrysler LLC and the United States Department of the Treasury, to block the planned sale of Chrysler LLC assets to a \\"New Chrysler\\" entity in the Chrysler bankruptcy. The case arose from the high-profile bankruptcy of Chrysler, in which the U.S. Treasury orchestrated a sale under Section 363 of the Bankruptcy Code to avoid the debtors' having to fully compensate a group of first lien priority creditors, which included roughly 100,000 retired teachers and police officers from Indiana. The United Auto Workers Union (UAW), which was closely allied with the Obama Administration, was a junior, unsecured creditor who stood to gain from the plan of sale. The plaintiff (pensioners) asked for the U.S. Treasury's redistribution of value in the bankruptcy from senior, secured creditors with priority liens to junior, unsecured creditors to be struck down, and also argued that the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 (EESA) authorizes the federal government to use TARP (Troubled Asset Relief Program) moneys [sic] only to \\"bail out\\" financial institutions and not automakers. In Dec 2008, Congress declined to authorize the Auto industry bailout bill. The defendant (U.S. Government) asked to allow the bankruptcy plan to proceed, noting that the needs of the economy outweigh the needs of the deal's detractors. Government lawyers defended the use of funds from TARP and argued that Indiana's appeal lacked legal merit. The sale had been ordered to proceed by the decision in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York. The order was appealed by the pensioners to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, and from there to the United States Supreme Court, who decided not to hear the case, and dropped the stay allowing the asset sale to proceed. As a result of the sale the United Auto Workers Union (UAW) gained a 55 percent ownership stake in the automaker. Six months later the Supreme Court vacated the lower court's ruling, thereby ensuring that the controversial opinion would retain no precedential value going forward; no ruling was issued to explain the Court's actions. Background Chrysler LLC and General Motors both carried a substantial debt and interest-cost burden that would make restructuring for future viability difficult, unless bondholders' claims were reduced or exchanged for equity by agreement. The original U.S. government plan was for both companies to enter a Chapter 11 bankruptcy, obtain critical agreements from most stakeholders, and minimize objections, allowing the companies to exit the bankruptcy process without a prolonged battle with stakeholders affected by the filing. Fiat's agreement permitted Fiat to decline to consummate the proposed partnership with the new Chrysler Group company if it were not completed by June 15, 2009, which in turn could force the liquidation of all Chrysler assets. Four major U.S. financial institutions (including JP Morgan Chase and Bank of America) which had received Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) bailout funds from the U.S. federal government held 70 percent of the Chrysler bonds, and agreed to the proposed deal of 33 cents on the dollar. The remaining holders of the debt formed a group known as the Committee of Chrysler Non-Tarp Lenders that accused the TARP bondholders of having a conflict of interest. Statement from non-Tarp Chrysler lenders, Financial Times, April 30, 2009 Under federal government pressure, most key members of the Non-TARP Lenders acceded to a bankruptcy agreement, raising the total of bondholders agreeing to 92 percent. However, since not all stakeholders had agreed before the deadline, Chrysler filed for bankruptcy on April 30, 2009. In the bankruptcy court, the U.S. government lowered the debt exchange offer to 29 cents on the dollar. The Indiana State Police funds, plaintiffs in the lawsuit, had obtained their Chrysler bonds in July 2008 at 43 cents per dollar of face value. Case overview The plaintiffs claim that the Department of the Treasury treated Chrysler's secured creditors in a manner that is contrary to that called for under U.S. bankruptcy law. Indiana State Treasurer Richard Mourdock originally filed a motion in the New York's federal bankruptcy court to stop the pending sale of Chrysler; it was rejected along with 300 other motions when the court order for the sale was issued. On Friday, May 29, 2009, the Indiana group's motion was rejected, and on Sunday, May 31, 2009, bankruptcy Judge Arthur J. Gonzalez approved a proposed government restructuring plan and sale of Chrysler's assets that allowed most of the assets of Chrysler to be purchased by the new entity. The plaintiffs appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, which affirmed the sale on June 5, 2009. The Second Circuit, however, stayed its decision, pending possible review by the Supreme Court, until 4 P.M. Monday, June 8, 2009. Fiat was to receive 20% of the new Chrysler entity, and have the future option of purchasing equity up to an additional 15% of the company. The autoworker's union retirement health care trust (voluntary benefit association \\"VEBA\\") would get 55%, and the U.S. Government and Canadian government would be minority stakeholders. On Sunday (June 7), the Indiana State Police Pension Fund, the Indiana Teacher's Retirement Fund, and the state's Major Moves Construction Fund filed a petition with the U.S. Supreme Court requesting an emergency stay to delay the sale while they challenged the deal.U.S. top court asked to delay Chrysler sale, Reuters, June 7, 2009. The funds argued that the sale went against U.S. bankruptcy law because it unlawfully rewarded unsecured creditors ahead of secured creditors since, under the proposed sale, Fiat would not initially contribute cash, but would instead contribute its vehicle platforms to the New Chrysler in exchange for its equity share.Court asked to stop Chrysler sale, BBC, June 7, 2009 Chrysler estimated the market value of Fiat's proposed contribution to be as much as US$8 to 10 billion. The pension funds also challenged the constitutionality of using funds from the Troubled Asset Relief Program to pay for the Chrysler bailout, and claimed that Congress never gave approval for the funds to be used in that manner. Indiana state pension and construction funds ask Supreme Court to block Chrysler sale to Fiat, Los Angeles Times, June 7, 2009 Fiat had the right to withdraw from participation in the \\"New Chrysler\\" if the deal did not close by June 15. However, the head of Fiat said it \\"would never walk away\\" from the Chrysler deal, even if it did not close by June 15. If Fiat did abandon the deal, since there is no other known entity willing to participate in the purchase of Chrysler assets as a block, the liquidation of all Chrysler assets would ensue.Court puts Chrysler deal in jeopardy, Globe and Mail, June 8, 2009 In briefs filed at the Supreme Court, the administration of U.S. President Barack Obama supported the completion of the asset sale .Chrysler Fiat Sale Delayed by U.S. Justice Ginsburg, Bloomberg News, June 8, 2009 On Monday, June 8, 2009, Supreme Court Associate Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, presiding over emergency motions arising from the Second Circuit, issued a temporary stay in a one-sentence order, pending a further order by her or by the Supreme Court. Supreme Court declines to hear the case On Tuesday, June 9, 2009, the Supreme Court declined to hear the case. It issued a per curiam denial of the applications for a stay of the sale from the three Indiana funds, allowing the sale of assets to \\"New Chrysler\\" to proceed. It did not discuss the underlying issues raised, and its opinion cautioned that its denial of the stay was not a judgment on the underlying merits. According to the two-page decision and order, the Indiana funds \\"have not carried the burden\\" of demonstrating that the Supreme Court was required. The U.S. Department of the Treasury then issued a statement saying: \\"We are gratified that not a single court that reviewed this matter, including the U.S. Supreme Court, found any fault whatsoever with the handling of this matter by either Chrysler or the U.S. government.\\" On Wednesday, June 10, 2009, the sale of most of Chrysler assets to \\"New Chrysler\\" (formally known as Chrysler Group LLC) was completed. As had been proposed, Fiat received equity in the New Chrysler through its contribution of automobile platforms as a base for a new line of Chrysler cars. The federal government financed the deal with the US$6.6 billion in financing that it had paid to the \\"Old Chrysler\\", formally called Chrysler LLC. The transfer did not include eight manufacturing locations, nor many parcels of real estate, nor equipment leases. Contracts with 789 U.S. auto dealerships, which are being dropped by Chrysler, were not transferred. As a result of the asset sale the United Auto Workers Union (UAW) gained a 55 percent ownership stake in the automaker. Supreme Court vacates the underlying Second Circuit opinion On December 14, 2009, the Supreme Court granted the cert petition in Indiana State Police Pension Trust v. Chrysler LLC and vacated the underlying Second Circuit opinion, but remanded the case with instructions to dismiss the appeal as moot. While the Court had declined to hear the case on June 9 which allowed the Obama administration's wealth redistribution BK plan to proceed without ruling on its merits, its Dec 14 action effectively de-legitimized the BK plan, yet the Court did not issue a ruling to explain its actions. This was far from the ideal outcome for the Indiana pensioners who sought equitable relief from the high court, but the vacatur of a flawed lower court decision is nevertheless an important development that will maintain the integrity of bankruptcy law going forward. Opinions on the case =Plaintiff (Indiana pension group) argument= During a May 29, 2009 interview with Human Events, Mourdock said, \\"This is the first time in the history of American bankruptcy law when secured creditors received less than unsecured creditors.\\" Mourdock also stated, \\"The Chrysler deal is a clear violation of the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution and more than 150 years of bankruptcy law.\\" Mourdock also stated that under the Fifth Amendment, private property cannot \\"be taken without due process of law. That clearly has not happened in this case. There has been no process of law consistent with long-standing precedent whatsoever.\\"Interview With Richard Mourdock , Human Events, June 1, 2009 On May 26, 2009, while speaking in front of U.S. District Judge Thomas Griesa, Mourdock stated, \\"As fiduciaries, we can't allow our retired police officers and teachers to be ripped off by the federal government. The Indiana state funds suffered losses when the Obama administration overturned more than 100 years of established law by redefining 'secured creditors' to mean something less ...

It is an unacceptable risk for us to purchase that debt.\\"Indiana treasurer challenges Obama's Chrysler plan, Reuters, May 22, 2009 =Defendant (U.S. government) argument= Chrysler said in a statement that Mr. Mourdock, a Republican, was politically motivated and was willing to put Chrysler in liquidation over less than 1 percent of the three funds' assets. U.S. Solicitor General Elena Kagan, later an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court, defended the use of TARP funds for helping Chrysler, and argued that the pension funds' appeal to block the sale to Fiat lacked legal merit. She said that the losses that the pension funds would incur \\"cannot outweigh\\" the potential larger problems that a collapse of Chrysler would create. She wrote, \\"As an economic matter ... blocking the transaction would undoubtedly have grave consequences.\\"Obama lawyer: Chrysler-Fiat must be allowed, CNN, June 8, 2009 She also said, \\"The liquidation of Chrysler would have very severe effects on the American and Canadian economies ... More than 38,000 Chrysler employees would lose their jobs; 23 manufacturing facilities and 20 parts depots will be shuttered; more than 3,000 Chrysler dealers would suffer significant and possibly fatal harm to their businesses; and billions of dollars in health and pension benefits for current and former Chrysler workers would be wiped out.\\"U.S. top court considering Chrysler sale, Reuters, June 8, 2009 =Other responses= U.S. Representative Joe Donnelly (D-Indiana), objecting to the lawsuit, declared, \\"This claim endangers the present offer made by Chrysler and threatens to provide the pension funds with a much lower return than has already been offered.\\" U.S. Representative Gary Peters (D-Michigan), with a district that includes Auburn Hills, Michigan, where Chrysler's headquarters is located, said, > It is quite clear that Indiana's case is not in the best interest of the > people of Indiana.

If it wasn't, it wouldn't have been offered at such a steep discount.\\" Lombard also pointed out that during the current recession, even secured bank debt is not a guarantee. She explained that the market's low price could have been due to a relative lack of buyers or because the debt was faulty. She also compared the transaction to purchasing a house at a bargain price, and stated, \\"Either there's a divorce and the people just want to get out of there, or the foundation is cracked. In an industry in such turmoil, due diligence becomes even more critical.\\"Indiana Teachers and Cops vs. Chrysler, Business Week, June 4, 2009 Hedge fund managers from Pacific Investment Management, Barclays Capital, Fridson Investment, and Schultze Asset Management Advisors have predicted that the Treasury Department's actions will discourage them from lending money to unionized companies with underfunded pension and medical obligations, such as airlines and auto suppliers.Fund Managers Burned by Obama Now Say They Are Wary, Bloomberg, May 20, 2009 The Financial Times wrote that the Obama administration's treatment of Chrysler's secured creditors \\"disturbed the security of expectation that has made lenders willing to provide capital as secured credit, thus handicapping all US industry and undermining what has been, for all its flaws, one of the best financial reorganisation processes in the world, now emulated elsewhere.\\"How Washington blew GM’s bankruptcy, Financial Times, June 1, 2009 An editorial in The Economist argued that the Treasury Department's actions could \\"establish a terrible precedent.

Oroklini refers mainly to the village behind Oroklini Lake, however, some coastal neighborhoods in Livadia and on Dhekelia Road are usually also designated as outskirts of Oroklini.  History  The region around the village was inhabited in ancient times,Oroklini when there was intense mining in that region, especially for copper. It was an estate of despots, and was probably destroyed by Saracens. Leontios Machairas in his Chronicle mentions raids by the Saracens in that region during the reign of Janus of Cyprus (1398-1432). Oroklini and the surrounding villages were abandoned in the fifteenth century, resettled, then again temporarily abandoned before being resettled in the sixteenth century. In the seventeenth century it is mentioned in Venetian documents as Vorochini: during this period the village was abandoned yet again. It was finally permanently settled in the eighteenth century.  Industry  Although copper is no longer mined, there are a number of quarries of grey soil, umber and tera alba.  Bird protection area  Oroklini Lake is designated as a Special Protection Area (SPA) and was subject to a three-year project starting in January 2012 to bring the lake to ″favourable conservation status″. Black-winged stilt (Himantopus himantopus) and the spur-winged lapwing (Vanellus spinosus) were the main target species along with fifty-eight bird species that migrate through, or overwinter within the SPA. The shallow salt lakes are also home to greater flamingo. Churches There are several deserted chapels in the area next to the mountainside. The old small church of the Archangel Michael from the 17th century is built in the Byzantine style. It was rebuilt in 1867. The new church of the Archangel Michael was built in 1986. The small church of the Prophet Elias was built in the 16th century on the hilltop west of the village. There was also the Church of Saint Thomas, which was a monastery from the 10th century.

Construction  Recuperative multi-tube coolers essentially exist of a turning rotor which is mostly driven via chain. At the ends of the rotor are stiff cases for product feed and outlet. The rotor is supported on running treads, as it is typical for rotary drums. The interior of the rotor exists of several tubes in a revolvertype (or planetary) arrangement. The tubes are completely surrounded by a jacket. According to requirements recuperative multi-tube coolers are built with diameters between 1.0 and 4.0 m and lengths from 10 to 40 m.  Function  Recuperative multi- tube coolers work with indirect air cooling. That means, that there is no direct contact between the product to be cooled and the cooling air. The heat is exchanged indirectly via thermal conduction. Ambient air is used as cooling air, which is drawn between the jacket and the tubes. Product and cooling air pass through the cooler in counterflow. The product to be cooled falls directly into the product feed housing. By the rotary movement and a little slope of the rotor, the product is conveyed through the cooler. The rotation causes a permanent mixing of the product in the tubes and hence a good heat transfer. Due to the indirect method of operation, the coolers provide hot and clean air that can be reused as energy. This opportunity of recovering energy is where the term recuperative results from.  Applications  The coolers can be used for the cooling of free flowing, fine grained bulk material. They are especially used when consumers of the recovered hot air are close-by. Usual this is the case in calcination processes after hotgas fired rotary kilns in or similar. The hot air is used as preheated supply of combustion air in the kilns. The consumption of primary energy can be reduced seriously. The coolers are mostly used in the pigment industry, e.g. for cooling of titandioxide pigments after calcination. The entry temperatures of the products can reach up to 1000 °C.

As a result, the nave and chancel were rebuilt although the earlier three-stage tower was left intact. Henry Hastings, 3rd Earl of Huntingdon granted the patronage of the church to Emmanuel College, Cambridge, leading to a dispute between the college and the owner of the manor of North Cadbury that became famous in the history of mortgage law. From the 17th century until 1979 the church remained under the patronage of Emmanuel College, Cambridge, and every rector from the mid-17th century to the mid-20th century was a former fellow of the college.

The pattern was formulated in Otto Jespersen's 1917 book Negation in English and Other Languages, and named after him in Swedish linguist Östen Dahl's 1979 article Typology of Sentence Negation. Introduction The linguist Otto Jespersen began his book with the words: The process has since been described for many languages in many different families, and is particularly noticeable in languages which are currently at stage II (both the original and the additional word obligatory) such as French, Welsh, and some dialects of Arabic and Berber. The fact that different languages can be seen to be in different stages of the process, and that sometimes, as Jespersen says, the whole process can begin again after renewal, prompted Dahl to name the process \\"Jespersen's cycle\\". The observation was however made earlier, most noticeably by Antoine Meillet, who used the term 'spiral'. The process There are three stages, labelled I, II and III: In Stage I, negation is expressed by a single pre-verbal element: (Examples from different periods of French, all from ): : In Stage II both a preverbal and a postverbal element are obligatory: : In Stage III the original preverbal element becomes optional or is lost altogether: : Examples French is well known to use a bipartite negative, e.g. \\"Je ne sais pas\\" = \\"I don't know\\", lit. \\"I not know not\\". (The second negative element originally had a semantic connection with the verb: \\"Je ne marche pas\\" originally meant \\"I don't walk a step\\".) Welsh has a very similar pattern, \\"Ni wn i ddim, literally \\"Not know I nothing\\". In both languages, the colloquial register is at a more advanced stage in the cycle, and the first part (ne or ni(d)) is very frequently omitted. In formal Welsh registers, by contrast, ni(d) tends to be used without ddim. This is not true of formal registers of modern French, but the use of ne on its own survives in certain set expressions (e.g. n'importe quoi: \\"no matter what/anything\\") and with certain verbs (e.g. \\"Elle ne cesse de parler\\": \\"She doesn't stop talking\\"). English too passed through Jespersen's cycle early in its history: for example \\"I didn't see\\" would be expressed in Old English as ic ne seah; then strengthened with the word nauȝt (from Old English ' \\"no thing\\") as Middle English I ne sauȝ nauȝt; then leading to Early Modern English I saw not.Kastovsky, Dieter. 1991. Historical English syntax. P. 452Van Gelderen, Elly. 2006. A history of the English language. P. 130 The same development occurred in the other Germanic languages such as German and Dutch, which produced their respective postposed negative particles nicht and niet, first duplicating and eventually ousting the original preposed negative particle ne / ni.Jäger, Agnes. History of German negation. P. 103–104 Modern English’s do-support and contraction of “do not” to “don’t” in colloquial speech could be argued as moving English back toward Stage I of Jespersen’s Cycle—“I didn’t see”. Incipient signs of a further step may be seen in sentences like \\"I didn't say a word\\" or \\"I don't know shit\\", in which the final word does not specify the object of the verb, but mainly serves to reinforce the negative. Central Atlas Tamazight, a Berber language spoken principally in Central Morocco, uses a bipartite negative construction (e.g. 'he _didn't_ go out' — the underlined elements together convey the negative) which apparently was modeled after proximate Arabic varieties. , p. 2. The Chamic languages, spoken in parts of Cambodia, Vietnam, and Hainan, may also be undergoing Jespersen's cycle. , p. 313. Italian and the various Italian regional languages are also undergoing a similar transformation, where even all three stages can be seen in action at once: The standard language is (still?) generally at stage I, with, e. g., Non gliel'ho detto (I haven't told him/her). This can become Non gliel'ho mica detto colloquially (stage II) and also (stage III) Gliel'ho mica detto (sub-standard) or Mica gliel'ho detto (colloquial), mica originally meaning \\"in the least\\". In Western Lombard, the archaic no l'hoo vist (I haven't seen him/it) has long since become l'hoo minga vist or l'hoo vist no with no change in meaning.

Musical and singing career  Brown began her classical musical training at Juilliard at the age of sixteen; however, she later took up the genres of jazz and the blues after having met Leonard Bernstein at Tanglewood in 1947. Along with Ruth W. Greenfield, Brown was one of the founders in 1951 of the Fine Arts Conservatory, in Miami, which The New York Times described as, \\"one of the first racially integrated theaters and art schools in the South.\\" By the 1950s, Brown had developed a rhythm-and-blues style akin to such performers as Ma Rainey and Bessie Smith, and during this time, she released an album entitled, A Torch for Tally, with the Jimmy Diamond Quartet. The album featured the songs Limehouse Blues, Honeysuckle Rose, and My Man. Brown was also cast in productions of Mame, The Pajama Game, Medea, and other shows, which were staged on and off Broadway. In the 1960s and 70s, Brown sang in notable New York City nightclubs such as Reno Sweeney's and S.N.A.F.U. She also provided entertainment at the Continental Baths, a gay bathhouse in New York City. Following her death, The New York Times published an obituary stating that Ms. Brown was known for her intense, dramatic renditions of songs by Kurt Weill, the Rolling Stones and David Bowie.\\"  Acting career  Brown began her film acting career by appearing in the film Batman Dracula (1964) and the film Camp (1965), both directed by Warhol. In one scene from Camp, Brown mimicked Yma Sumac. Brown appeared in such experimental films as Brand X (film) (1970) and The Illiac Passion (1964-67). She was also featured in the horror film Silent Night, Bloody Night (1974).  The New York underground performance scene  Brown was \\"prominent in the underground performance world of the 1960s and 70s.\\" In the summer of 1964, Brown first met Warhol at a benefit for the Living Theatre, the alternative theatre in New York City of which she was a member. Brown would later be featured in at least two of Warhol's films. In 1970, she was among a panel of guests who participated in a discussion on the David Susskind Show about Warhol's underground film Trash (1970). Also interviewed were other members of Warhol's \\"Factory\\".  Tally Brown, New York  German filmmaker Rosa von Praunheim directed a documentary based on the life of Brown entitled Tally Brown, New York in which he relied on \\"extensive interviews with Brown, as she recounts her collaboration with Warhol, Taylor Mead, and others....\\" Released in 1979 in the former West Germany, Tally Brown, New York was a portrait of Brown's singing and acting career. Distinguished cameo appearances in the film included that of actors Divine, Holly Woodlawn and artist Ching Ho Cheng.

The horse is best known for her win in The Oaks in 2009, a year in which she was named European Champion 3-Y-O Filly. Background Bred and raced by Lady Bamford, she was named for the Sariska Tiger Reserve in the Alwar district of the Indian state of Rajasthan. She was trained by Michael Bell. Racing career Sariska made her racing debut on 1 November 2008, winning a maiden race for fillies at Newmarket Racecourse. She did not return to the track until 18 April 2009, when she ran fourth to winner Lahaleeb in the Fred Darling Stakes at Newbury Racecourse. In her next start, Sariska won the Musidora Stakes at York Racecourse. Made the betting favourite for The Oaks, under jockey Jamie Spencer, who had ridden her in all of her previous starts, Sariska outfought Midday down the stretch to win the Classic by a short head. She followed that up with another victory in the Irish Oaks. Her next start was her first against older horses in the Yorkshire Oaks where she went off a short priced favourite only to be out battled by the four-year-old Dar Re Mi, who prevailed by a short head. She then finished third behind Twice Over in her first race against the colts in the Champion Stakes at Newmarket. Sariska trained on as a four-year old and started her campaign with an easy victory over old rival Midday in the Group Two Middleton Stakes at York. She was then second in Epsom's Group One Coronation Cup, behind Fame and Glory. In the Yorkshire Oaks, Sariska was to face Midday and a younger horse, that season's dual Oaks winner, Snow Fairy. However, Sariska refused to budge from the stalls as the field raced away from her with Midday, a horse she'd beaten three times, winning. This was the first time Sariska had shown any negative temperament in public, although she had nearly killed her trainer Michael Bell a month previously when kicking him with both hooves in the back, narrowly missing his kidneys and sending him flying across the stable. Retirement Connections gave her one last chance in the Prix Vermeille at Longchamp, but she again refused to budge from the stalls in a race where Midday again took the honours. After the race, her trainer Michael Bell compared her to \\"a Ferrari with no keys\\" due to her appearing to be \\"in great form\\" but refusing to run. Sariska was then retired. She is currently a broodmare at Daylesford Stud and was bred to Galileo in 2011 for a 2012 foal.

He was the outstanding two-year-old colt in the United States in 1970 when his wins included the Cowdin Stakes. Hoist The Flag was being prepared for the Triple Crown races when his career was ended by a leg injury. He subsequently became a highly successful and influential breeding stallion. Background Hoist The Flag was a dark-coated bay horse with a small white star, bred by New York City Investment banker, John Schiff. Hoist The Flag was out of the mare Wavy Navy, a daughter of the 1937 U.S. Triple Crown champion, War Admiral. His sire was Tom Rolfe, the 1965 American Champion Three-Year-Old Male Horse and a son of the undefeated European superstar, Ribot. Hoist The Flag was purchased as a yearling for $37,000 by Jane Forbes Clark I (née Wilbur), wife of noted philanthropist Stephen C. Clark, Jr. who also owned and raced top steeplechase horses. The colt's race conditioning was handled by future U.S. Racing Hall of Fame trainer, Sidney Watters, Jr. and his jockey was Jean Cruguet, who six years later would ride Seattle Slew to a U.S. Triple Crown championship. Racing career As a two-year-old, Hoist The Flag dominated his age group and was the heavy winterbook favorite for the 1971 Kentucky Derby. Hoist The Flag finished first by several lengths in each of his four starts but in the Champagne Stakes was disqualified from first and set back to last for interference during the early stages of the race. He came out of the race with sore shins and was sent to recuperate at facilities in Camden, South Carolina. He was voted the 1970 American Champion Two-Year-Old Colt. For 1971, Hoist The Flag was assigned highweight of 126 pounds on The Jockey Club's Experimental Free Handicap. He did not return to racing until March 12, 1971 when he blew away the competition by 15 lengths in an overnight race at Bowie Race Track. In his next start on March 20, the colt won the Bay Shore Stakes at Aqueduct Racetrack by seven lengths while setting a new track record. No three-year-old had ever run seven furlongs faster than the 1:21 Hoist The Flag clocked in winning the Bay Shore. On March 30, 1971, Hoist The Flag was at Belmont Park where he was scheduled to run in the Gotham Stakes as a tune-up before the Kentucky Derby. Following a five furlong workout, the colt took a misstep and broke his right hind leg in two places, suffering a shattered pastern and a fractured cannon bone that ended his racing career and put his life in jeopardy. Veterinary Surgeons performed a bone graft, using screws and metal plates to secure the breaks then created the first ever fiberglass cast to wrap around the horse's leg. While Hoist The Flag eventually recovered, in 2006, Kentucky Derby winner Barbaro would suffer a very similar injury but following surgery developed laminitis and had to be euthanized . Stud record Following his recovery from surgery, Hoist The Flag was sent to stand at stud at Claiborne Farm near Paris, Kentucky where he sired 254 live foals. Successful as a sire and as a broodmare sire, he was the leading juvenile sire in North America in 1981 and the leading broodmare sire in 1987. Among his notable offspring, Hoist The Flag was the sire of: * Alleged (f. 1974) - 1977 European Horse of the Year, two-time winner of the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe (1977, 1978) * Sensational (f. 1974) - multiple Grade 1 winner, American Champion Two-Year-Old Filly * Hoist The King (f. 1979) – sold for record-setting $1.6 at Keeneland Sales in 1979 * Linkage (f. 1979) - won 1982 Blue Grass Stakes, 2nd Preakness Stakes * Stalwart (f. 1979) - won Norfolk Stakes, Hollywood Futurity Hoist The Flag was the damsire of: * Broad Brush (f. 1983) - multiple stakes winner of US$2,656,793, Leading sire in North America (1994) * Personal Flag (f. 1983) - multiple Grade 1 winner, career earnings of US$$1,258,924 * Cryptoclearance (f. 1984) - Multiple Grade 1 winner, career earnings of US$3,376,327 * Personal Ensign (f. 1984) - U.S. Racing Hall of Fame inductee who won the 1988 Breeders' Cup Distaff and retired undefeated in thirteen starts * Sacahuista (f. 1984) - won 1987 Breeders' Cup Distaff, American Champion Three-Year-Old Filly, career earnings of US$$1,298,842 Hoist the Flag died in 1980 and is buried at Claiborne Farm. Assessment In a 2004 televised interview, jockey Jean Cruguet, perhaps best known for his Triple Crown victory on Seattle Slew, said Hoist The Flag was the best horse he ever rode. Jockey Jean Cruguet would reiterate and amplify his remarks in an August 2011 interview with Brisnet. \\"Hoist the Flag was the best horse I ever rode, by far... It wasn't Seattle Slew. The first time I ever got on Hoist the Flag (as a two-year-old), I told everyone I knew that I was going to win the Kentucky Derby with this horse. The only reason I didn't say 'the Triple Crown' was because I was so new in this county I didn't even know what the Triple Crown was. I'd never even heard of it. If he hadn't broke down (early in his three-year-old season but eventually saved for stud duties), Hoist the Flag would have been 1-9 to win the Triple Crown. \\"Seattle Slew was a top miler, and because he was so much better than everyone else that year he was able to win the Triple Crown, but Hoist the Flag would have beat everyone else going any distance at any time. He was just that much better than everyone else.\\" Pedigree References Category:1968 racehorse births Category:1980 racehorse deaths Category:Racehorses bred in Kentucky Category:Racehorses trained in the United States Category:American Champion racehorses Category:United States Champion Thoroughbred Sires Category:American Champion Thoroughbred broodmare sires Category:Clark family Category:Thoroughbred family 5-i Category:Chefs-de-Race ","title":"Hoist The Flag"},{"id":"23134031","text":"Kokkinotrimithia ( []) is a village located west of Nicosia, Cyprus, close to the Green Line.

It has a double plinth, offset corner buttresses, dividing strings, battlemented parapet with pairs of corner pinnacles extended from buttresses, and central paired pinnacles corbelled off gargoyles. The dovecote in the churchyard dates from the 17th century, and was associated with a manor house which was demolished around 1850.

The three strong class was the second generation of domestically built submarines, representing a significant improvement compared to the earlier . Built at the Brodogradilište specijalnih objekata (eng. Special objects shipyard) in Split, the new class featured a streamlined hull design and four bow facing torpedo tubes that could also be used for minelaying. With the start of the Croatian War of Independence all three boats were relocated from the Lora Naval Base to Montenegro where they were commissioned with the SR Yugoslav Navy. The last two boats of the class, Junak and Uskok, were decommissioned during the 1990s and scrapped. Heroj was decommissioned in 2004 and after restoration laid up at the Porto Montenegro Museum in 2013.  Description  The boats measured in length with a hull diameter of . Surfaced they displaced and while underwater. The diesel- electric drive consisted of two Mercedes diesel generators and single Končar electric motor mounted on a single shaft. This enabled them a maximum speed of underwater and when surfaced. Travelling underwater using a snorkel at a speed of , the boats had a range of . Diving depth was . The boats were manned by a complement of 28 crew members. Armament of the class consisted of four torpedo tubes used for launching up to six SET-65E active/passive homing torpedoes or deploying up to twelve naval mines instead.

Before being officially commissioned with the Navy, Heroj underwent a series of sea trials in order to test the maximum operational parameters of the submarine. On one such occasion, Heroj was travelling at a depth of and slowly accelerating to its maximum underwater speed. When the submarine reached , the boat's fiberglass sail collapsed. This in turn affected the hydrodynamics by creating a positive trim and surfacing the submarine at high speed within seconds. After overcoming these difficulties, the boat was clear for service and was officially commissioned on 10 September 1968. Two other units soon followed with Junak being commissioned in 1969 and Uskok in 1970.

He remained a faithful supporter of Henry and was rewarded with lands and offices in South Wales. Some sources claim that he personally delivered the death blow to King Richard III at Bosworth with his poleaxe.Heritage of Wales News 6 February 2013. Accessed 27 February 2013http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/richard-iiis-killer- really-welshman-7168556 Early life Rhys was the youngest legitimate son of Thomas ap Gruffydd ap Nicolas of Llandeilo in Carmarthenshire, and Elizabeth, daughter of Sir John Gruffydd of Abermarlais, also in Carmarthenshire. In 1460, after decades of increasing unrest among the nobility and armed clashes, the supporters of Richard, Duke of York of the House of York challenged the right of King Henry VI of the House of Lancaster to rule England. Most Welsh landholders claimed their titles through grants made by Henry's father and grandfather for loyalty to the English crown during the revolt of Owain Glyndŵr. They therefore generally supported Henry, rather than the rival Yorkist claimants to the throne. In 1461, when Rhys ap Thomas was twelve or thirteen, a Lancastrian army raised in Wales under Jasper Tudor, the Earl of Pembroke, moved into England but was defeated at the Battle of Mortimer's Cross by Edward, Earl of March (the eldest son of Richard of York who had been killed a few weeks before). Rhys's grandfather Gruffydd ap Nicholas was killed in the battle. Within a few weeks, Edward had been proclaimed King Edward IV, and the main Lancastrian armies were crushed at the Battle of Towton in Yorkshire. Some Lancastrians, including Rhys's father Thomas, continued to resist in Wales. Thomas and his brother Owain defended Carreg Cennen Castle near Llandeilo. They were forced to surrender in 1462 after a siege. The victorious Yorkists slighted the castle to prevent it being used as a Lancastrian stronghold again. The lands of the defeated Lancastrians were confiscated, and Thomas, with the young Rhys, went into exile at the court of Philip the Good, the Duke of Burgundy. Thomas and Rhys returned to Wales in 1467, and reacquired at least some of their former lands. This was during a period which included the Readeption of Henry VI, when many former Lancastrians regained their lands, and contrived to keep them even after the subsequent victory of Edward IV in 1471. Thomas died in 1474. Rhys's two elder brothers had already died, and Rhys inherited his father's estates. Reign of Richard III In 1483, Edward IV died. His son, Edward V was still a minor. Edward's surviving brother Richard of Gloucester and the Duke of Buckingham moved to prevent the unpopular relatives of Elizabeth Woodville, Edward's Queen, from sharing in power or even dominating the government during the young King's minority. However, Richard went further, declaring Edward's children illegitimate and seizing the throne himself. The young Edward V and his younger brother (the Princes in the Tower) disappeared and were probably murdered. Buckingham turned against Richard and led a revolt aimed at restoring the House of Lancaster, in the person of the exiled Henry Tudor, Earl of Richmond, to the throne. The revolt failed. Buckingham himself had raised a force at Brecon in mid-Wales, but storms and floods prevented him crossing the River Severn to join other rebels in England, and his starving soldiers deserted. He was soon betrayed and executed. The same storms prevented Henry from landing in the West Country. Rhys had declined to support Buckingham's uprising. In the aftermath, when Richard appointed officers to replace those who had joined the revolt, he made Rhys ap Thomas his principal lieutenant in south west Wales and granted him an annuity for life of 40 marks. Rhys was required to send his son Gruffydd ap Rhys ap Thomas to the King's court at Nottingham as a hostage, but he excused himself from this obligation by claiming that nothing could bind him to his duty more strongly than his conscience. He is supposed to have taken an oath that > Whoever ill-affected to the state, shall dare to land in those parts of > Wales where I have any employment under your majesty, must resolve with > himself to make his entrance and irruption over my belly. Nevertheless, he is presumed to have carried on some correspondence with Henry Tudor, who was preparing another attempt in France to overthrow Richard. The intermediary was Dr. Lewis Caerleon, who was personal physician to Lady Margaret Beaufort, Henry Tudor's mother. Bosworth campaign On 1 August 1485, Henry set sail from Harfleur in France. With fair winds, he landed at Mill Bay near Dale on the north side of Milford Haven, close to his birthplace in Pembroke Castle, with a force of English exiles and French mercenaries. At this point, Rhys should have engaged him. However, Rhys instead joined Henry. Folklore has it that the Bishop of St. David's offered to absolve him from his previous oath to Richard. The Bishop also suggested that Rhys fulfil the strict letter of his vow by lying down and letting Henry step over him. This undignified procedure might have weakened Rhys's authority over his men, so instead, Rhys is said to have stood under the Mullock Bridge about north of Dale while Henry marched over it. Henry's and Rhys's forces marched separately through Wales, with Rhys recruiting 500 men as he proceeded. They rejoined at Welshpool before crossing into England. Rhys's Welsh force was described as being large enough to have \\"annihilated\\" the rest of Henry's army.Ross, Charles (1999) [1981]. Richard III. Yale English Monarchs. New Haven, Connecticut; and London: Yale University Press, p.213. On 22 August, they met Richard's army near Market Bosworth. In the resulting Battle of Bosworth, Richard launched an attack led by John Howard, 1st Duke of Norfolk. According to a contemporary ballad, Rhys's men halted the assault. \\"Norfolk's line began to break under pressure from Rhys ap Thomas's men\\" and the Duke was killed by an arrow shot.Ralph A. Griffiths and Roger S. Thomas, The Making of the Tudor Dynasty, p.185. Hoping to turn the tide and win the battle rapidly by killing his rival, Richard and his companion knights charged directly at Henry. The king was unhorsed and surrounded. The poet Guto'r Glyn implies that Rhys himself was responsible for killing Richard, possibly with a pollaxe. Referring to Richard's emblem of a boar, the poet writes that Rhys \\"killed the boar, shaved his head\\" (\\"Lladd y baedd, eilliodd ei ben\\").Griffith, Ralph, Sir Rhys ap Thomas and his family: a study in the Wars of the Roses and early Tudor politics, University of Wales Press, 1993, p.43. See also guto'r glyn.net However, this may only mean that one of Rhys's Welsh halberdiers killed the king, since the Burgundian chronicler Jean Molinet, says that a Welshman, one of Rhys' men (suspected to be Wyllyam Gardynyr), struck the death-blow with a halberd. Guto'r Glyn himself says that Rhys was \\"like the stars of a shield with the spear in their midst on a great steed\\" (\\"A Syr Rys mal sŷr aesaw, Â’r gwayw’n eu mysg ar gnyw mawr\\"). He was knighted on the field of battle.E. A. Rees, A Life of Guto'r Glyn, Y Lolfa, 2008, p.212. Richard III wounds match medieval Welsh poem description Later life Rhys demonstrated his continuing loyalty to Henry by suppressing a Yorkist rebellion at Brecon in 1486, and taking part in the campaign against the pretender Lambert Simnel in 1487 and the subsequent campaigns against Perkin Warbeck. He played a part in the defeat of the Cornish Rebellion of 1497, capturing the rebel leader Lord Audeley, for which he was awarded the honour of Knight Banneret. As reward for his loyalty to Henry, he acquired many lands and lucrative offices in South Wales. He was appointed Constable and Lieutenant of Breconshire, Chamberlain of Carmarthenshire and Cardiganshire, Seneschall and Chancellor of Haverfordwest, Rouse and Builth, Justiciar of South Wales, and Governor of all Wales. He was also a Privy Councillor and in 1505 he was made a Knight of the Garter, which he celebrated with a great tournament at Carew Castle in 1507. After the death of Henry VII, he remained a supporter of his son, Henry VIII and took part in the Battle of Guinegatte in 1513. He was one of the Garter Knights to accompany Henry VIII in 1520 at his meeting with Francis I of France at the Field of the Cloth of Gold. Rhys was married twice: to Eva, daughter of Henri ap Gwilym of Cwrt Henri; and to Janet, daughter of Thomas Mathew of Radyr, who was widow of Thomas Stradling of St Donats. However, although Rhys had numerous mistresses and several illegitimate children, his legitimate son Gruffydd ap Rhys ap Thomas died in 1521. Rhys himself died at Carmarthen Priory in 1525. After Henry VIII suppressed the monasteries, Rhys's tomb was moved to St. Peter's Church, also in Carmarthen. Rhys's estates and offices were meant to pass to his grandson and heir Rhys ap Gruffydd, however they were taken by the Crown and given to Lord Ferrers for life. Rhys ap Gruffydd was later beheaded by Henry VIII in 1531 for treason after fighting Ferrers and provoking civil unrest amongst the citizens of Carmarthen who were still angry about the disinheritance. The current claimed heirs of Rhys's are the Lords Dynevor, although with existing unclaimed heirs; with the most famous and prominent being the Evanses of Carmarthen, Vaughans of Carreg Cennen Castle, Morgans of Llandeilo and Williamses of Dynevor Castle. Each of these unclaimed heirs all claim to be a descendant from one or multiple of Rhys's illegitimate children with each having claim to the baronet whilst also having claims in their own rights [Speculation from Oral Traditions carried out in Carmarthenshire].

It is located at the north corner of North Broadway (US 9) and Cherry Street, a block north of the junction of Route 9 and NY 199. It was built in the mid-18th century as an inn to serve long-distance travelers on the Albany Post Road. In the 1810s, it became the meeting place of the Red Hook Town Board for the next several decades. It has had a number of owners; the Elmendorphs are the earliest known ones. In the 1830s, it was expanded and renovated, eventually becoming just a residence. After a recent restoration it has become a community center. In 1978 it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Building The inn is a two-story, nine-bay frame clapboard-sided structure with a modified gambrel roof pierced by four brick chimneys. A lean-to addition is on the rear. It is located on the north corner of the intersection, just two buildings north of the Village Diner. Inside, the building has much of an interior added in the early 19th century, such as its wooden doors, lath and plaster walls, chair rails and exposed ceiling beams. The central hallway has a curved wall to accommodate the staircase. There is evidence of the expansions that have taken place, such as bricked- over former fireplaces.

History Records of property ownership and improvements in 18th-century Red Hook are scant because most of the land in the village was leased from local landowner Henry Beekman. The village did not even incorporate until 1894, after a fire had destroyed many older buildings, further complicating historical research. The mid–18th- century construction date has been established instead by close examination of its architecture and the contemporaneous leasing of many surrounding properties. For most of the 18th century Red Hook was just the inn and a few houses, serving travelers on the Albany Post Road (now Route 9), where it became a regular stop in 1785. It seems to have gone through several owners, and is first noted as Elmendorph's Inn on a 1797 map. By 1811 it was known as Loop's Hotel, after owner Jacob Loop, whose deed for is the first indication of ownership of the property. The Red Hook Town Board met there for the first time in 1815, the first of many recorded meetings at the inn. The first Dutchess County Fair was held on the grounds. When Loop died in 1819, a George Ring bought the inn. He opened a store as well in 1820, but this effort failed so thoroughly that the entire property was sold at a sheriff's sale five years later. The buyer flipped it the same day to Peter DeReimer, who himself sold it to a Jacobus Eckhart in 1827. Sometimes during the 1830s, the inn was expanded in both the north and south directions to its present size. The original gambrel roof was covered over to create its present gabled appearance. The interior was also refurbished in the Federal style; many of those improvements remain. The next owner, David Wager, lived there for a while before buying the inn in 1835. Town Board meetings continued until 1842. Three years later Wager gave some of the land on the east end of the parcel to the local Methodist Episcopal Society for use as a cemetery. He sold the property to Augustus Martin, a state assemblyman and town supervisor, shortly before his death in 1854. It was the Martin family who ended the building's commercial use and converted it to a two-family residence. Edward Martin, a descendant, later operated a school in the building that, at least during the 1890s, had kindergarten classes. It remained in his family's hands until 1933. At that point the lot was subdivided and sold, with only the inn's half-acre (2,000 m2) remaining. Heating and plumbing were added to the building during the 20th century. In 1977 it had fallen into disrepair and was on the verge of being demolished. It was acquired by a group called Friends of Elmendorph, which renovated it to its present appearance over the next 12 years. A front porch that was on the building in 1978 when it was listed on the Register has since been removed, and shingled siding removed to reveal the original clapboard. The building is now home to Historic Red Hook, a membership 501(c)(3) non-profit volunteer organization committed to collecting, preserving and promoting Red Hook's history. The group maintains the historic Elmendorph Inn as a community center, creating dynamic public programs and partnering with community organizations.

Developed by the Brodarski Institute (BI) from Zagreb, the two strong class was built by the Brodogradilište specijalnih objekata (Special objects shipyard) in Split. They were intended as a replacement for the aging s. Compared to the earlier , the Sava class was longer with more powerful armament that consisted of six torpedo tubes that could also be used for minelaying. With the start of the Croatian War of Independence, both submarines were relocated to Boka Kotorska where they would be commissioned with the new FR Yugoslav Navy of, what would eventually become, Serbia and Montenegro. Both were decommissioned during the early 2000s.  Development and building  The Sava class was developed by the Brodarski Institute (BI) from Zagreb, SR Croatia as a replacement for the two boats in service. The project, designated B-72, was led by Colonel Dušan Radanović who was succeeded by Branko Ryšlavy. Compared to the previous Heroj-class attack submarines, the new class was to have a greater degree of automatation with improved armament and autonomy including greater diving depths. Both submarines, Sava (P-831) and Drava (P-832), were built by the Brodogradilište specijalnih objekata (Special objects shipyard) in Split, SR Croatia and named after rivers in SFR Yugoslavia. Sava was laid down in 1975, launched in 1977 and was commissioned in 1978. It was the second submarine in the Yugoslav Navy to carry that name, the first one being Sava (P-802). Drava was laid down in 1978, launched in 1981 and commissioned in 1982.  Description  The submarines measured in length displacing surfaced and when submerged. The diesel-electric drive consisted of two MTU diesel engines and a Končar electric motor mounted on a single shaft, enabling the boats a speed of when surfaced and a maximum speed of underwater. The boat's maximum diving depth was and were manned by a crew of 35. Armament consisted of six forward facing torpedo tubes used for launching a complement of up to ten TEST-71ME torpedoes with a maximum range of or up to twenty naval mines if used for minelaying operations. Sensors include a \\"Stop Light\\" radar warning system and a \\"Snoop Group\\" surface search radar. Sources are somewhat conflicting regarding installed sonar equipment. Service and aftermath  Both Sava and Drava were part of the 88th Submarine Flotilla of the Yugoslav Navy, with the Lora Naval Base in Split being their homeport. In October 1983 while underwater Drava suffered a hull breach which almost resulted in the submarine and its entire crew being lost. It was revealed that the cause of the breach was a design flaw in the submarine itself. With the start of the Croatian War of Independence both submarines were relocated to Montenegro where they were eventually commissioned with the FR Yugoslav Navy. The major overhaul of Drava was stopped in 1996 and the boat was decommissioned sometime around 1999. Sava was decommissioned in 2002 and was officially declared redundant in 2004, being not operational for some time by that point. The submarines were passed on to Montenegro after the country declared independence in 2006, and after unsuccessful attempts at selling the submarines as complete warships, in 2008 it was decided that they were to be sold for scrap or as museum exhibits. Drava was sold and scrapped in June 2008 in Tivat. On 8 May 2008 Sava was sold as scrap for 174,500 Euros to the Podgorica firm \\"Mont Metal\\" and was towed to Turkey for scrapping. An article published in 2010 suggested that the submarine was sold along with the \\"Orca-2000\\" system still on board, although it was supposed to be removed along with the other sensitive combat equipment. \\"Orca-2000\\" was a torpedo fire control system that could also be used for navigation and was developed in Serbia and Montenegro . A few days later Rajko Bulatović, commander of the Montenegrin Navy at the time, made a statement explaining the \\"Orca-2000\\" system was never installed on Sava, and was in fact, developed for a foreign customer.

It premiered at 9:00pm ET/PT on Saturday, February 24, 2001 and was cancelled after six episodes. Overview The title character was the single mother of teenaged sons Daniel and Elvis. Facing a financial crisis, she seeks legal advice at Brothers Keepers, an inner city community advocacy center, and is offered a job as a social worker. Her co-workers include attorney Abbie Schaeffer and Joe Almeida, the organization's street-smart director, who founded it after his daughter was killed in gang crossfire. Cast * Mary Stuart Masterson as Kate Brasher * Rhea Perlman as Abbie Schaeffer * Hector Elizondo as Joe Almeida * Mason Gamble as Elvis Brasher * Gregory Smith as Daniel Brasher * Roger Robinson as Earl Among those actors making guest appearances during the series' short run were K Callan, Dennis Christopher, Paul Dooley, Mariette Hartley, Josh Hopkins, Carl Lumbly, Spencer Breslin, David Naughton and Mackenzie Phillips. Development and production Series creator Stephen Tolkin based the character of Almeida on Rabbi Mark Borovitz, an ex-convict and alcoholic who became the spiritual leader of Gateways Beit T'Shuvah, a residential treatment center for Jews in recovery from alcohol and drug addiction. The two men met when Tolkin contacted the rabbi for help with a friend who was dealing with substance abuse.Jewish News of Greater Phoenix, March 30, 2001 Although set in Santa Monica, California, the series was shot on location in San Diego, California. Episodes Critical reception Anita Gates of the New York Times said the series \\"has an appealing cast and doesn't insult viewers' intelligence most of the time. But the main characters - who are 100 percent good and face off against people who are 100 percent bad - always seem to be making self-righteous speeches . . . There's nothing wrong with inspiring little speeches that make audiences cheer. It was always a pleasure to see Dixie Carter get carried away with one of hers on Designing Women. But the speeches have to say something in a fresh way, and even Ms. Carter's orations got old once the show's writers became so self-conscious about them. Kate Brasher is trying too hard . . . to be quirky . . . to create a noisy ER-ish atmosphere of hustle, bustle, chaos and crisis, . . . [and] to be simultaneously uplifting and cynical.\\" New York Times review References External links Category:CBS original programming Category:2000s American drama television series Category:2001 American television series debuts Category:2001 American television series endings Category:Television series by 20th Century Fox Television Category:Television series by CBS Television Studios Category:Television shows set in California ","title":"Kate Brasher"},{"id":"23134416","text":"Munro College is a boarding school for boys in St Elizabeth, Jamaica. It was founded in 1856 as the Potsdam School (named for the city of Potsdam), a free school for poor boys in St. Elizabeth as stipulated in the will of plantation owners Robert Hugh Munro and Caleb Dickenson. It was renamed Munro College during World War I as part of the general rejection of German names at the time, though the surrounding Potsdam district was not also renamed. Munro College takes its name from one of its benefactors and was established in the fashion of the British public school. Several of the boarding houses take the names of other benefactors or illustrious alumni. The campus has its own chapel and magnificent views of the Caribbean sea and Pedro Plains from its perch atop the peak of the Santa Cruz Mountains.http://www.munrocollege.edu.jm Over the years Munro College has distinguished itself as a centre for excellence in secondary education in Jamaica and the Caribbean. It is reputed to have produced the most Rhode Scholars of any secondary school in the Caribbean. The most recent Rhodes Scholar from Munro College is Vincent F. Taylor (Jamaica and Magdalen 2013). Munro College is currently the only all- boys boarding school in Jamaica. Sixth form Although established as a free school for poor boys, Munro used to admit Hampton girls into its 6th Form programme, but as of the new term of September 2010 this was discontinued, along with the classes previously offered at Hampton School. Munro College now has a shared campus with Hampton School where both set of sixth formers learn the arts in a cool, learning-inducing environment with quality teachers.

The 32nd AAMDC commands echelon above corps (EAC) ADA brigades and other assigned forces. Four such brigades, 11th Air Defense Artillery Brigade, 31st Air Defense Artillery Brigade, 69th Air Defense Artillery Brigade, and 108th Air Defense Artillery Brigade; by training, all stand ready to accomplish their mission of air defense against missile attack – 'anywhere, anytime' in support of the war-fighting combatant commander (CCDR). Mission On order, the 32nd AAMDC rapidly deploys forces to conduct joint and combined/coalition air and missile defense operations for the regional combatant commander. Function The 32nd Army Air and Missile Defense Command (32nd AAMDC) is the Army Forces and Joint Forces Land Component Commanders' (ARFOR / JFLCC) organization that performs critical theater air and missile defense planning, integration, coordination, and execution functions. The 32nd AAMDC coordinates and integrates the four operational elements (or pillars) of theater missile defense (TMD): passive defense, active defense, attack operations, and battle management/command, control, communications, computers, and intelligence (BM/C4I) to protect contingency, forward deployed, and reinforcing forces, as well as designated theater strategic assets. The 32nd AAMDC is based at Fort Bliss, Texas and falls within the authority and under the operational control of U.S. Forces Command. Current Army authorization documents provide for four AAMDC's (three Active Component, and one Reserve Component). Used for attack operations, standard Army processes are unwieldy and inefficient. A more streamlined method is needed that places Theater Missile Defense (TMD) responsibility under a single executive agent. Commander in chief, USARCENT and CFLCC, has designated a single authority for the conduct of TMD operations in the SWA theater of operations—in this case, the Commander, Air Component Command, and Commanding General, Ninth Air Force. In a break with Army tradition, the Commanding General, CFLCC, gives up operational control of 32d AAMDC when Ninth Air Force is in theater, effectively establishing a single focused authority over theater missile defense on the peninsula. The theater missile defense operations center functions as a staff under the combined forces air component command and is responsible for planning, coordinating, and integrating theater-level missile operations. The center is split-based with Ninth Air Force in theater and 32nd AAMDC in Ft. Bliss, TX. During either an exercise or in wartime, 32d AAMDC collocates in the JAOC and integrates operations with the Ninth Air Force cell. In addition, it dispatches liaison teams to the separate ADA Brigades. Joint attack operations is an ongoing venture, beginning with intelligence preparation of the battle space conducted jointly between AAMDC and the Ninth Air Force intelligence cell. Information sharing aids the process. Attack strategy is jointly drafted and approved. Pre-planned and immediate attack mission requests are developed. AAMDC brings experience as well as considerable technical capabilities with its intelligence tools such as the generic area limitation environment and all source analysis systems. The in-country analysts bring enormous SWA-specific knowledge and access to quick-response Air Force collection systems. With these resources, joint intelligence identifies the enemy theater missile order of battle, operational patterns and techniques, capabilities and weaknesses, likely operating areas, and other exploitable information. History To date, the 32nd AAMDC has proven itself as the premier example of the Total Force concept.http://www.defense.gov/News/NewsArticle.aspx?ID=24693 Composed of in excess of 220 active duty (FT Bliss) soldiers, more than 10 civil service personnel, and numerous contractors, the 32d AAMDC has performed and validated its TMD mission and conducted extensive training during numerous joint and combined exercises – including Prairie Warrior 96, Ulchi Focus Lens 96, 97 & 98, Roving Sands 96 and 97, Coherent Defense 97, U.S./Russian TMD Exercise (Jan 98), and JTFEX/TMDI (Feb 99). In early February 98, and prior to its official activation (16 Oct 98), the 32nd AAMDC deployed to support Combined Task Force-Kuwait during Operation Desert Thunder. The 32nd AAMDC performs critical theater-level air and missile defense planning, integration, coordination and execution functions. The unit coordinates and integrates the operational elements of theater missile defense in support of the ground maneuver forces. The unit commanded the Echelon Above Corps ADA brigades, which in this case are TF 1-1 ADA and TF 3–43 ADA. After successfully deploying into Kuwait with little notice, the 32d AAMDC assumed command of one Patriot Task Force, conducted RSOI and assumed command of a second patriot task force, wrote the air and missile defense plan for Operation Desert Thunder and executed the TAMD mission in a contingency theater. Further, the 32d AAMDC played the pivotal role in developing procedures for combined U.S. and Kuwaiti theater air and missile defense, interoperability, and training; expanding the TBM alert and warning architecture within CTF-Kuwait; and conducting distributed interactive simulation (DIS) training while performing its mission in a contingency environment. While deployed to the Southwest Asia (SWA) theater of operations, the 32nd AAMDC commander also performed the functions of Theater Army Air Defense Coordinator (TAADCOORD) and Deputy Area Air Defense Commander (DAADC) – ensuring that Army Air and Missile Defense was integrated with counterair, active defense operations and planning at the theater level. The 32nd AAMDC provided liaison officers to each of the major theater elements: Air Component Commander (ACC), Land Component Commander (LCC), Battlefield Coordination Detachment (BCD), Joint Special Operations Command Task Force (JSOTF), and Allies to provide coordinated execution of integrated AD and TMD operations. With the addition of the 32nd AAMDC to the joint coalition task force, soldiers on the ground have access to a new early warning system. This system, which is basically a redundant system relying on digital pagers, can alert soldiers to possible biological and chemical agents before they are released by incoming Scud missiles. Within seconds of a Scud launch, the 32nd AAMDC TOC can predict its trajectory and where a warhead will impact. In less than two minutes, this information will then be relayed to the unit commanders who are at the predicted impact site. These commanders will then pass the word to the troops, giving them time to protect themselves. By monitoring the air picture, the 32nd AAMDC TOC can also pinpoint where a Scud missile has been launched and directing the land-component command to counterattack the site. In Nov 98, the 32nd AAMDC deployed to Kuwait to conduct contingency planning and coordination in support of CTF-Kuwait during Operation Desert Thunder II/Southern Overwatch. During the period Dec 98 – Jan 99, the unit was again deployed to SWA in support of Operation Desert Fox. =Lineage= The unit was first constituted in January 1918 in the Regular Army as Headquarters and Headquarters Company, 32nd Artillery Brigade (Coast Artillery Corps) and organized at Key West Barracks, Florida Demobilized 18 January 1919 at Camp Hill, Virginia Reconstituted 18 October 1927 in the Regular Army as Headquarters and Headquarters Battery, 32nd Coast Artillery Brigade Activated 20 November 1942 at Fort Bliss, Texas Redesignated 28 May 1943 as Headquarters and Headquarters Battery, 32d Antiaircraft Artillery Brigade. Inactivated 30 May 1947 in the Philippine Islands. Activated 6 February 1951 at RAF Mildenhall in England. In June 1957, the Brigade deployed from the UK to Kaiserslautern in Germany. Redesignated 11 March 1958 as Headquarters and Headquarters Battery, 32nd Artillery Brigade. On 11 May 1966, the unit was redesignated as Headquarters and Headquarters Battery, 32nd Army Air Defense Command (AADCOM). Subordinate to the 32nd AADCOM were the 10th, 69th, 94th, and 108th Artillery Groups, making it the largest air defense unit in the US Army. 32nd AADCOM also had a presence in Germany in the 1960s and 70s, basing its headquarters in Kaiserslautern (K-Town) until 1976, and thereafter at Darmstadt. The first Nike Hercules Battery in Germany was located in Kaiserslautern This battery also had the distinction of the first dual site (Nike Hercules and Nike Ajax) This battery was later moved to Hontheim, Germany. There were also HAWK missile batteries in Schweinfurt, Germany. The battalion headquarters was in Baumholder (Birkenfeld, Rhineland- Palatinate). They were supplied by the Spangdahlem Air Force base (Bitburg- Prüm, Rhineland-Palatinate). After overcoming some reliability problems, the Patriot was issued in 1985 to units of the 32nd AAMDC, a major subordinate command of U.S. Army, Europe. At this point, the Patriot was capable only of shooting down aircraft, including helicopters. A major effort to improve the capabilities of the Patriot system was already under way. Two Patriot batteries from the 32nd Army Air Defense Command's 10th Air Defense Artillery Brigade were designated for airlift to Israel during the Gulf War. All of the American Patriot units that fought in DESERT STORM were drawn from the 11th Brigade and from several similar brigades of U.S. Army, Europe's 32nd Army Air Defense Command. Inactivated 15 July 1995 in Germany. Formerly a provisional organization assigned to U.S. Army Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC), the 32nd Army Air and Missile Defense Command (32d AAMDC), Fort Bliss, TX, officially activated as a theater level command on 16 October 1998. It is assigned to Headquarters, United States Army Forces Command (FORSCOM), per FORSCOM Permanent Orders 271-2 dated 28 September 1998. Effective with the activation, 32nd AAMDC assumes \\"command and control\\" (C2) of the 11th and the 35th ADA Brigades. The 32nd AD also tested the Patriot Missile in Crete during \\"Reforger\\" a mission that was conducted around 1983–1985 this was essential in making the Patriot system mission capable. Soon after Validation. Patriot was passed off to allies such as Israel, to ward off attacks from neighboring, hostile countries in the Middle east region. =Heraldry= Nickname: The 32nd AAMDC adopted the nickname \\"Blackjack\\" shortly after its activation in 1998. This nickname was originally given to Gen. John J. Pershing. Gen. Pershing was born in Laclede, Missouri on 13 Sept. 1860. He graduated from the U.S. Military Academy in 1886 and served in several Indian wars. In 1895, after leading an all-black unit in a clash with the Cree Indians in Montana, he received the nickname \\"Black Jack\\". Gen. Pershing was assigned to Fort Bliss in April 1914, where he served until 1917, when he was appointed to command the American Expeditionary Force in Europe. Patch: The red and yellow colors of the 32nd AAMDC patch represent the Artillery. The five arrowheads (representing missiles) allude to the air defense mission of the command. Their placement three and two, respectively, refer to the unit's numerical designation. Insignia: The star is a symbol of achievement, and represents the command. The five points of the star allude to the organization's participation in World War I (Saint-Mihiel and Meuse-Argonne) and World War II (New Guinea and Leyte) as well as the command's Philippine Presidential Unit Citation.

Its exact date of origin is unknown, but a map of 1576 shows a \\"Newlande Chap.\\" on the site. The church exterior presents white-washed roughcast walls and a green slate roof; the interior displays two stained glass windows, a gallery, and a reading desk and a pulpit dated 1610. Tourists and hillwalkers visit on their way to the fells. The church is a Grade II listed building. Location The whitewashed roughcast Church of Newlands lies in open countryside some to the west of the hamlet of Little Town, Cumbria, England near the confluence of Newlands Beck, Scope Beck, and Keskadale Beck in the Lake District National Park and by road from Keswick. It is situated in the Newlands Valley, separated from Derwent Water to the east by the summit of Catbells. It is surrounded by the high mountains which encircle the head of the valley. History =Origins= The exact date of the origin of Newlands Church is unknown, but is believed to be some time in the middle 16th century. Christopher Saxton’s map of 1576 shows a church on the site marked \\"Newlande Chap.\\".University of Portsmouth site. Shows copy of Saxton‘s map of 1576. The church was mentioned again in 1594 when John Mayson of the local farm Stoneycrofte left the sum of 3s 4d to Newlandes Chappell in his will. Due to the effects of the plague of 1558 the church did not have an Incumbent in its early years and it was not until 1610 that Anthony Bragg was installed as the church’s first Lay reader. A Lay reader was an unqualified member of the clergy (usually a local person) who could read the services but could not perform christenings, marriages, or Communion, these duties being the bailiwick of the primary priest on his rounds of the valley. Nine Lay readers served the church until 1731, the longest serving being Thomas Birkhead (1654–1690) and John Atkinson (1690–1728). Stained glass window in the south wall depicting St. Michael in armour =Curacy= In 1731, Joseph Fisher was appointed the church's first Curate and served until 1779. Newlands was one of the poorer clergy with an annual stipend of £2 11s 7d, the lowest in the Diocese of Carlisle. The church received three payments of £200 under the laws of Queen Anne's Bounty in 1748, 1750 and 1757. Ten Curates served in Newlands until 1868. William Parsable served for 32 years (1794–1826), and was known as “Peppery Billy”. He also served as Headmaster at Crosthwaite School in nearby Keswick, and was known for his quick temper and firm discipline which put fear into both the congregation and pupils. =Rebuilding= By the early years of the 1840s, the church was in a rundown state. John Monkhouse became Curate in 1840, and raised funds to rebuild the structure and to add a school. The school was built on the west side of the church at a cost £37 and opened in 1841. A modern plaque outside the school says it was built in 1877 but records confirm its construction in 1841. The rebuilding of the church cost £200 and included a new roof, new windows and an end wall. The height of the building was increased thereby, allowing for the construction of an upstairs Gallery. =1880s to present= In 1882, the church received its first vicar, A.C. Forbes, and, in 1885, further renovations were conducted with new pews, new flooring, and a heating system being installed. A slate plaque was put in the north wall to commemorate the re-opening by the Bishop of Carlisle. The graveyard was extended in 1926. The school remained open until 1967 when the pupils were transferred to Braithwaite Primary School. The school room fell into disrepair after closure, but was refurbished in the late 1990s and reopened on 9 April 2000 by the Bishop of Carlisle as a place for quiet reflection. Today, twice monthly Sunday services are conducted, and the church is open during the day for visitors and hill walkers to call in as they pass on their way to the fells. The church is a Grade II listed building.  Interior  Interior from the Gallery At the east end of the church is a reader’s desk and pulpit which both date to 1610. The sandstone and wood lectern dates to 1937. The wooden top of the lectern can be removed to allow the sandstone plinth to be used as a baptismal font. The stained glass east window by Abbot & Co. of Lancaster dates to 1845, and was paid for by local residents to commemorate the rebuilding of the church. It displays Christ holding the wine and bread beneath the words, \\"I am the true vine, I am the living bread\\". A stained glass in the middle south wall window (the only other in the church) by Shrigley and Hunt displays St Michael in armour with a lion's head on his shoulder. The window is a memorial to Thomas Roscre Johnston, killed in World War I. A slate memorial in the north wall commemorates the re-opening of the church by the Bishop of Carlisle on 4 June 1885. There are memorials to benefactors Moses and Sarah Mawson of Emerald Bank, and to the Clark brothers (slain in action during World War II). The offertory box near the door is a memorial to John Bulman. A large wooden armorial with the Royal Coat of Arms of George II, dated 1737, hangs on the south wall.  Literary connections  The poet William Wordsworth and his daughter Dora visited Newlands Church in May 1826 while on a walking tour of the fells from Rydal Mount. Wordsworth was so impressed by his first glimpse of the church through half-opened leaves that he was prompted to write in his poem, \\"To May\\":Visit Cumbria site. Gives details of Wordworth‘s visit to chapel. :“How delicate the leafy veil :Through which yon house of God :Gleams, mid the peace of this deep dale :By few but shepherds trod!\\":every poet.com. Gives lyrics of the poem “To May”. In the summer of 1901, children's author and illustrator Beatrix Potter was staying at nearby Lingholm and often had the Vicar of Newlands Church and his family to tea. The vicar's young daughter Lucie Carr played with Potter's pet hedgehog during these visits and inspired the character of Lucie in The Tale of Mrs. Tiggy-Winkle (1905). In the illustration of Lucie running along a path, Potter depicted the church in a grove of trees.

He was born and raised in the city of Campeche, where he began drawing as a young student. However, he had to flee the city for Mexico's capital after confronting Campeche's governor in public. In the capital, he made his way to law school, despite poverty, but continued his opposition to the political status quo, landing him in jail, interrupting his studies. After he finished his classes he began to work as a journalist in opposition newspapers when in 1893 a series of fictionalized accounts of army campaigns against the Tarahumara people landed him back in jail. Escaping his captors and with help, he fled to the US and Paris. In the latter city, he discovered Impressionism which he admired but did not begin to produce his own paintings until well after he returned to Mexico. Clausell has two periods of production, during the 1900s and from 1920 until his death, with the break coming during the Mexican Revolution. His canvas works are almost exclusively dedicated to landscapes with some seascapes, mostly sticking to the base of Impressionism with some experimentation in coloring. However he also produced images on the walls of his studio, which are far more varied in theme and style, with elements of Symbolism. While he was not integrated with Mexico's art scene during his lifetime, his work was noticed and appreciated by artists such as Diego Rivera and Dr. Atl. Since 1995, when a tribute to his work took place at the Mexico's National Art Museum he has been written about and gained more recognition. Personal life Canal de Xochimilco by the artist Clausell is the son of José Clausell from Catalonia (now northeastern Spain) and Marcelina Franconis from Campeche, Mexico. His father immigrated to Mexico initially to work in shipbuilding with his brother Mauro, but later became a businessman in the city of Campeche. Joaquín was born Joaquín Quirico Marcelino in the city of Campeche on June 16, 1866, the only son of the couple. According to family lore, the couple knew they could not have any more children so they put all the names they liked onto this one. The family was prosperous enough to allow Joaquín to study at a private school called the Instituto Campechano from primary to high school; however, the death of the father meant that Joaquín had to work as well as study to make family ends meet. Since he was young he had a rebellious nature. When he was an altar boy, he decided to use the red vestment as part of his costume for Carnival, which had him banned from this religious role. This nature pushed him to oppose much of the political status quo of his day, related to the Porfirio Díaz regime. As the age of 16, he confronted the then-governor of Campeche Joaquín Baranda in public, which resulted in the artist's expulsion from school and the state. Clausell went to Mexico City with little money, and starting to work cleaning equipment at a pharmacy in order to survive. In the capital, he met many of his generation, rich and poor, with liberal ideas in opposition to the government. Most, if not all, of these were students with no fixed careers. Clausell briefly attended the National School of Engineers, but since his interest was in law, he did not stay long. Through friends, he found ways to take law books from the National Law School library and other buildings to study at night. Clausell was caught doing this and jailed, but this prompted a visit from the school's dean. The dean was moved by Clausell extreme poverty and desire to learn and gave him admission and a scholarship. However, Clausell still needed to work odd jobs to feed himself and even pawned a medal he won debating in order to buy food. Admission to law school did not end his political activities. He had oratory and organization skills which he used, to organize students in 1889 to honor the recently deceased political exile Sebastián Lerdo de Tejada when the body was repatriated to Mexico. This pushed the government to have an official reception for the body, which they tried to keep as quiet as possible. However, Clausell disrupted the official event by speaking out for Lerdo de Tejado's policies, wound up being arrested for sedition, and spent several months in the Belem Prison. While Clausell was able to complete all of his law classes in 1892, the jail time prevented him from taking the bar exam and receiving his degree. Clausell's later work as a journalist got him into political trouble once again, forcing him into exile, first to the United States and then to Paris. He kept in touch with friends and family through letters, at first signed with pseudonyms. This included letters to an early girlfriend named Esther La Chiti, despite the fact that she had married. While in Paris, Clausell was introduced to the Impressionism art movement and he was particularly impressed with the work of Camille Pissarro. Clausell struck up a friendship with the older artist, visiting him several times in his Paris studio and received an invitation to visit Pissarro's hometown of Rouen, but did not go, most likely due to lack of funds. There is also no evidence that Clausell took classes or otherwise began to paint while in Europe. Clausell returned to Mexico City in 1896, and initially returned to his bohemian lifestyle with the writers, journalists and artists of what was called the Centuria Azul or Modernista generation. Clausell was able to arrange his bar exam and received his law degree, ironically signed by Porfirio Díaz, in 1901. Mural work in Clausell's studio During this time as well he married Angela Cervantes, the sister of Antonio Cervantes, who had helped Clausell economically during his exile. The family was descended of the Counts of Santiago de Calimaya and Clausell moved into the family residence which today is the Museum of the City of Mexico. The family had managed to conserve enough of their fortune to still live comfortably and eventually Angela inherited the mansion. The couple had four children: Angela, Dolores, Estella and Joaquín. Angela did not particularly approve his Clausell's painting or many of his acquaintances, so two rooms were constructed for him on the roof of the building, one of which would become his studio. This studio was a large room with doors and windows on three sides, leading to the name of “tower of a thousand windows.” Clausell used the studio as a refuge from his wife and her family, and to entertain friends such as Dr. Atl, Juan O'Gorman, Diego Rivera, Carlos Pellicer, Salvador Novo and Julio Ruelas where they discussed modern ideas. In 1908, Atl created a pastel portrait of Clausell. He also used the walls of the studio to paint, eventually filling them with sketches and paintings in various stages of completion and without an overall plan in mind. These number about 1,300 works in various sizes and are distinct from his canvas landscape works by their wide variety of themes and elements outside of Impressionism. The murals have been mostly forgotten because the studio section has generally been closed to the public, partially or fully because of its deteriorated condition. Despite his entertaining, he was not a central figure in the Mexican art scene at the time, with his closest friend being Dr Atl, with whom he served as an officer of the Sociedad de Pintores y Escultores. He was also a Freemason, belonging to the Grand Lodge of the Valley of Mexico. Clausell died on November 28, 1935 while on an outing with friends and family at the Lagos de Zempoala area south of Mexico City. He was walking on a hill near the lake when ground gave way under his feet and he fell down an embankment. The resulting landslide covered and suffocated him. Political activism and law career Clausell is best known for his painting, although he was also an orator, journalist, politician and lawyer. He continued his rebellion against the Diaz regime after his graduation from law school, moving into journalism. At first he worked for El Universal, writing columns critical of the government under the pseudonym of Juan Pérez, but government pressure soon terminated this job. Afterwards he tried to establish his own publication La Soberanía de los Estados but it failed due to lack of funds. He also collaborated with publications such as El Hijo del Ahuizote and El Monitor Republicano. Soon after Díaz was re-elected for a third time, Clausell co- founded an opposition newspaper called El Demócrata in 1893, which he also directed. Months after the founding, the paper began publishing excerpts of a fictionalized account of the army's offensive against the Tarahumara people in Chihuahua in Tomóchic, under this name. This landed him and co founder Francisco R Blanco back into Belem Prison. It was likely that the facts of the story, if not the story itself were relayed to Clausell by Heriberto Frías, but Clausell insisted it was all his own idea. Just before his trial, Clausell escaped and with the help of friends self-exiled to the United States and France. By the beginning of the Mexican Revolution, Clausell was allied with the party of Francisco I. Madero. However, there is no information about what, if any, role Clausell played in the conflict, especially after Madero's assassination. It is known that he spent much of the 1910s working as a lawyer and defending many of the poor in the prisons in Xochmilco. He did this work either pro bono or accepting whatever his clients could pay him, which often was in farm products, leading to the nickname of “Abogado Gallina” (Lawyer Chicken). Artistry Mazatlán, by the artist It is estimated that during his lifetime, Clausell produced about 400 works, 100 of which are large-scale works. However, he did not sign his works and rarely dated them, making cataloging and a chronology very difficult. He did not consider himself a professional painter, He was a recluse, not promoting his work and with a few exceptions, did not associate with contemporary Mexican artists. There is no known association between Clausell and the older but still contemporary landscape artist José María Velasco, who was famous for his renderings of the Valley of Mexico. With few exceptions, he did not sell any of his works and often gave them away. However, despite all this he did serve as an art teacher at the “escuelas de aire libre” (free and open art classes given in parks and other public spaces) with Dr. Atl, becoming director of the school in Iztacalco in 1930. While he drew cartoons as a young student, his interest in painting was peaked when in Paris, attending an 1896 exhibition of Camille Pissarro, whose work impressed him. Clausell is generally considered to have been self-taught or described as a kind of genius by contemporary newspapers, although art historian Xavier Moyssen believes he might have had formal instruction. There are no records in art schools in Paris or Mexico City that indicate that he attended courses at these institutions nor do any of his personal documents or family accounts indicate such study. However, Moyssen believes that several works, copies of works by other painters, were probably done with Clausell in the role of student. These include a copy of a work by Edith Corbet, with Clausell dedicated on the back to Van Gogh, Cezanne and Monet, the oldest known work of the artist. He also did a copy of Alberto Fuster's “Retrato de un mujer,” a non-landscape piece, in 1902. As an artist, Clausell had two periods of production, the first between roughly 1903 and 1910 and the second from 1920 until his death in 1935. He abandoned painting during the Mexican Revolution, mostly likely to concentrate on his law practice. However, his production was most intense in the latter period, becoming something of a vice, with all of his spare money going to supplies and even painting on wood and cardboard when he did not have canvas. In addition, he occasionally disappeared to Mexico's coasts, especially the area between Mazatlán and Acapulco to return with sketches as the basis of new paintings. Most of Clausell's work is done in oil though there are some watercolors, with works done on canvas, wood and cardboard. His color schemes show influence from pastels with paints applied mostly by brush with some use of the spatula. Most of his work is solidly Impressionist, with his open admiration of the work of Van Gogh, Renoir, Cezanne and Monet. His work shows influence from all of these along with that of Camille Pissarro and Alfred Sisley. While his canvas work sticks to the origins of Impressionism, there was some experimentation in the coloring of clouds, sky, rivers and sea, making them stronger than in nature. Unlike many Impressionist painters, he was uninterested in the everyday activities of people, who rarely appear in his works. Instead his work was inspired by the nature of Mexico, such as in Tlalpan and the lake areas of Iztacalco and Xochimilco along with the Pacific Coast. While Mexico has had a number of notable landscape artists, Clausell's work stands out because of its dedication to Impressionism. This style extended into the beginning of the Mexican muralism movement, but the muralists' requisite social themes did not influence Clausell. Unlike the panoramic views of the works of José María Velasco, Clausell's works depict the Valley of Mexico in smaller, more intimate scenes, often in areas related to his family's lands or in travels with Dr. Atl. A significant number of works are related to Iztacalco and the then existing Santa Anita Canal, as well as the ranch of his wife's family. According to Xavier Moyssen, he was the best among his contemporaries at seascapes. One particular work is Ola verde, which captures the green waves of the Laguna de Cuyutlán. Most of his canvas works have conventional coloring and topics, possibly because of his profession and social standing. However, the works he created on his studio's walls are different, with more experimentation and a wider variety of themes. These depict images of family, other artists, religious icons, nudes and animals with elements related to Symbolism, showing influence from Paul Gauguin and Paul Sérusier. Female figures were often portrayed in a negative light, but not always. These works have received less attention from both the public and critics, mostly because of their relative inaccessibility. Recognition Since his death in 1935, Clausell has been recognized as the most prominent Mexican Impressionist artist, even though he did not introduce the style into the country. He existed on the fringes of the Mexican art scene during his lifetime, but his work was noticed and praised by a number of well- known contemporaries. In an exhibition in 1921, his work caught the attention of Diego Rivera, who had just come back from Europe and later visited Clausell in his studio. This was despite the disdain of Rivera's generation for “academic” and European painting. Rivera proclaimed Clausell to be the best of Mexico's landscape artists as well as a “painter-poet”, who expressed the natural beauty of the country. His work was also supported and promoted by Dr. Atl. Clausell's work was only occasionally exhibited during his lifetime, and then collectively. One of his works was purchased from one of these exhibitions by the Secretaría de Instrucción Pública y Bellas Artes for the gallery of the Academy of San Carlos. After his death, his work has been documented by a number of prominent art critics and historians. Critic Jorge Juan Crespo de la Serna wrote a text about the artist in 1945, presented at the Palacio de Bellas Artes. Justino Fernandez dedicated text to him in a major reference on Mexican art called “El arte del Siglo XIX en México.” In 1995 the Museo Nacional de Arte held an homage and exhibition to the artist along with Telefonos de Mexico, which published a monograph dedicated to the artist. His granddaughter Patricia Clausell de Latapí has also worked to document and preserve the works of Clausell. In 2008 she published Nostalgia ocultas: Anécdotas sobre la vida de Joaquín Clausell, edited in part by the State of Campeche. One reason for the books is that over seventy fakes of Clausell's works have been discovered. However, she admits that a complete catalog is not possible because of the lack of signature and dates on his works as well as the fact that the collection is highly dispersed among many private collections. In 2012, one of Clausell's works called the Iglesia de San Ángel was sold for 360,000 pesos. To pay homage to Clausell and recognize him as one of the precursor's to modern art in Mexico, a juried event called the Bienal de Pintura Joaquín Clausell (Biennial of the Painter Joaquín Clausell) has been sponsored by the National Council for Culture and Arts, the Ministry of Culture of the State of Campeche and the Autonomous University of Campeche since 1993. The eleventh year of this competition allowed artists to create works between January 2014 and 30 September 2015.

She is best known for her photography chronicling the early life of settlers in Eastern Montana, depicting cowboys, sheepherders, weddings, river crossings, freight wagons, ranch work, badlands, eagles, coyotes and wolves.  Early life and education  Evelyn Jephson Flower was born to a wealthy merchant family at Furzedown Park, south of London, England. She was the eighth child of her father's second marriage, with three surviving older brothers and one older sister. Her father, Phillip William Flower's position as a merchant in the East India Company secured his family's comfort in the upper echelons of British society. Evelyn received the traditional education given to young women of the upper class, and could speak Italian, German, and French. She and her sister, Hilda, were educated at their home by a French governess, and their mother's work as a composer ensured them a thorough musical education. However, Evelyn was noted for preferring outdoor activities, such as horseback riding and hunting to traditional domestic activities, even before her move to the wilds of Montana.  Marriage and Moving West  Ewen Somerled Cameron was a family friend of the Flowers, and a hunting companion of Evelyn's oldest brother, Percy Flower. Over a decade Evelyn's senior, he was a Scotsman inhabiting the Orkney Islands, dedicated to ornithology, hunting and equestrian pursuits. Cameron was also married to the American opera singer Julia A. Wheelock (Guilia Vlada) in January 1881. The annulment of their marriage - by the Court of Session in Edinburgh - was not finalized until October 17, 1889, a month into his and Evelyn's expedition to Montana. Ewen and Evelyn began their first journey to Montana in 1889, arriving across the Atlantic Ocean in New York City in September, shortly after Evelyn's twenty-first birthday, on which she inherited a generous trust from her deceased father's will and became financially independent from her family, who disapproved of her venture to America with a married man. Following the earlier direction of Evelyn's brother Percy, who had hunted west of Miles City before the expansion of the railroad into Eastern Montana, the couple hunted along the Yellowstone River from November 1, 1889 to August 1, 1890, which Evelyn later recalls as her honeymoon. After traveling back to Britain to collect their belongings, the Camerons finally migrated to Montana in September 1891, along with Evelyn's brother Alec, and set up their first ranching venture. Over the years the Camerons would move to three different ranches in the area around Terry, Montana, trying their hands at raising polo ponies and cattle ranching. Their homesteading would be interrupted by Ewen Cameron's ill health and a year-long trip back to Britain from the summer of 1900 to 1901.  Career  Evelyn was introduced to photography by a boarder at their ranch house, and in July 1894, Ewen purchased their first camera. The boarder, an Irishman named Mr. Adams educated Evelyn on the basics of glass- plate photography and after his departure was replaced by a Briton known as Mr Colley. Mr Colley added to Evelyn's knowledge of photography and was a partner in her experiments to improve her work, by practicing different shutter times and processing methods. Evelyn was soon frequently requested at public gatherings and life events, to photograph weddings, family portraits and, by her husband, wildlife. Evelyn's work often accompanied her husband's observations of the local fauna of the region. Some articles that included her work are \\"The Mule Deer in Montana\\" in the British periodical Land and Water, as well as \\"Nesting of the Golden Eagle in Montana\\" from The Auk, an ornithological journal. Evelyn was not credited in either of these publications. However, in a 1905 article she wrote for The Breeder's Gazette in Chicago, titled \\"Sheep in Montana\\", which included her photography of surrounding sheep ranches, she was listed as the author and photographer. Cameron garnered national acclaim for the area through the work of former Time-Life Books editor, Donna Lucey. In the late 1970s, Lucey discovered thousands of Cameron's prints and negatives, along with diaries and letters covering thirty-six years of frontier life, stashed away in the basement of Cameron's best friend's home. After intensive study of the photos and documents Lucey wrote a biography, Photographing Montana 1894-1928: The Life and Work of Evelyn Cameron, which reproduces more than 170 Cameron images. The bulk of the photographs are now housed at the Montana Historical Society in Helena, Montana. Prints and artifacts are also displayed at the Evelyn Cameron museum in Terry, Montana. Cameron is the subject of the PBS documentary, Evelyn Cameron: Pictures From A Worthy Life.

He was a member of the first New South Wales Legislative Council. Campbell, a suburb of Canberra was named in his honour. Life and career Campbell was born in Greenock, Inverclyde, Scotland and at the age of 27 moved to India to join his older brother John. In India, he and his brother were partners in Campbell Clark & Co., merchants of Calcutta, which in July 1799 became Campbell & Co. when the Clarkes gave up their interest in the firm. In 1798, Robert Campbell, with a cargo from Calcutta, visited Sydney to develop a trading connexion there, and he also purchased some land at Dawes Point, near the western entrance of Sydney Cove. In February 1800, he returned to Sydney with another cargo to both settle in Sydney, and to establish a branch of Campbell & Co. In 1801 he married Commissary John Palmer's sister Sophia Palmer (1777–1833). After settling in Sydney he built the private Campbell's wharf and warehouses on his land at Dawes Point, and developed a large business as a general merchant. In the early years, Campbell & Co.'s business dealings involved importing goods and spirits from Calcutta for sale in Sydney, but not all voyages were successful. For example, in 1802 the Campbell & Co. brig Fly, captained by John Black, and \\"laden with piece and other valuable goods\\" was lost at sea on its return voyage from Kolkata to Sydney. Despite losses such as this, Campbell & Co. was heavily involved in the Australian trade, having £50,000 worth of goods in its Sydney warehouses in 1804. As part of its import business, the firm also fulfilled government contracts for supplies from India, mainly livestock for the Sydney and Derwent settlements, which Governor Philip Gidley King calculated had brought Campbell's firm £16,000 from the government alone between 1800 and 1804. In 1805 and 1806, Campbell and his family travelled to England. During this time his brother-in-law John Palmer acted as his agent. After the arrival of Governor William Bligh in August 1806, Campbell's high character led to him being appointed treasurer to the public funds, naval officer and collector of taxes. There being no bank at Sydney in 1807, the gaol and orphan funds were deposited with Campbell & Co. on its undertaking to pay interest at five per cent. Campbell built Australia's first shipbuilding yards in 1807, at the site that is now the Royal Sydney Yacht Squadron, Kirribilli. In 1809 Campbell chartered a ship the Brothers and sent it on a sealing expedition to New Zealand under Captain Robert Mason. He probably intended it to go to Solander Island in Foveaux Strait but instead, in November,it landed a gang on two islets on what is now the coast of the city of Dunedin on the southeast coast of the South Island. These are the first identifiable Europeans recorded as landing in the area, although others probably preceded them. The gang included the ex-convict William Tucker. When the Brothers returned to relieve its men it found only Tucker and Daniel Wilson at Otago Harbour where it anchored on 3 May 1810. This is the first reference to a European ship entering the harbour although others had probably preceded it. Tucker would later return and become the first European to settle in the area. While it was no part of his intention Campbell was thus instrumental in bringing the territory which is now Dunedin into the European sphere. With food supplies of the colony under threat following the Hawkesbury floods in 1806, Campbell's ship, the \\"Sydney\\", was chartered by Governor King, and on 14 April 1806, proceeded to Calcutta to return with 400 tons of rice or wheat. Unfortunately, the ship was wrecked on a reef off the coast of New Guinea, but no lives wore lost. In compensation he was granted £3,000, of land and 710 sheep. In 1825, James Ainslie established a sheep station called Pialligo for Campbell in the area where Canberra is now situated. In 1846, Robert renamed the property Duntroon after his ancestral Duntrune Castle, Argyll and Bute, Scotland. In later years Campbell provided half the cost of the church of St John the Baptist in its original form. In December 1825 Campbell was appointed a member of the first New South Wales Legislative Council. In January 1830, he was a member of the committee which recommended that King's schools should be founded at Sydney and Parramatta, and as evidence of his continued high standing in the community, when the Savings Bank of New South Wales was founded in 1832, it was found that Campbell had deposited with him £8000 belonging to convicts, and £2000 belonging to free people. He was allowing seven and a half per cent interest on these deposits. Campbell retired from the legislative council and from public life in 1843, and in 1844 his name was included in a list of those considered eligible for a proposed local order of merit. Campbell had seven children, John, Robert, Sophia, Charles, Sarah, George and Frederick. John, Robert and Charles became politicians like their father, all being on the Legislative Council, and John and Robert also being on the Legislative Assembly. In 1910, with the creation of the Australian Capital Territory, the government acquired Duntroon for the creation of the Royal Military College. The original Duntroon homestead (though later extended) is now the officers mess in the Royal Military College.Australian Department of Defence.

Etymology The origin of the name Nakhawila (singular: nakhwali) is unclear; however, it is most likely derived from the Arabic word nakhl, nakhla or nakhil (date palm) because the Nakhawila community is said to have worked in the palm groves around Medina. The word is believed to have been first used during the Ottoman rule of Hejaz and was first recorded by Abu Salim al-Ayyashi during his 1662-63 stay in Medina. In modern Saudi Arabia the Nakhawila are officially known as al-nakhliyūn or al- nakhliya (singular: nakhli).  Origins  The origin of the Nakhawila is unclear. Most members of the Nakhawila community claim descent from native Medinan Arab tribes such as the Khazraj or Hashemites, while others are claimed to be descended from black African slaves said to have been freed by Hasan ibn Ali and ordered to work on his farms. Other beliefs include that they are the descendants of African slaves, that they came from eastern Arabia, Iran or are from among the remnants of the Shiites of post-Fatimid Egypt. History Historically, they have engaged in cultivating palm trees and other menial work. The Nakhawila were prohibited from living within the city walls of Medina and were not allowed to pray in Al-Masjid an-Nabawi or to bury their dead in Al-Baqi' cemetery. This was due to the popular Sunni belief that the Nakhawila would pollute these places. They were also prohibited by the Ottomans, and later by the Saudis (following widespread Sunni protests in 1937), from participating in elections. According to Johann Ludwig Burckhardt, the Nakhawila were \\"despised by the townspeople, because they openly profess heresy, and are moreover of humble degree.\\" During his visit to Medina, Richard Francis Burton described the Nakhawila as \\"miserable schismatics\\". During his stay in Medina, Abu Salim al-Ayyashi described a unique Nakhawila custom in which \\"almost every Thursday\\" they would visit the shrine of Ismail ibn Jafar and engage in various activities, such as feasting, circumcision of boys and ziyara. Such a custom may hint at an Ismaili past. Many sources also claim that the Nakhawila men allow, or even encourage, their women to contract temporary mutah marriages with Shiite foreigners visiting Medina. Such Shiite pilgrims often use Nakhawila homes to stay in and conduct Shia rituals, such as mourning of the Imams, beyond the gaze of Sunnis in the city. Following the fall of Medina during the Saudi conquest of Hejaz, the Nakhawila demolished the tombs of Al-Baqi' cemetery at the behest of the Wahhabi qadi Ibn Bulayhid. During the mid-1970s, the Nakhawila were involved in serious communal disturbances in Medina. For decades, the Nakhawila community in Medina was headed by Sheikh Muhammad Ali al-Amri, a Shia jurist who studied in Najaf under the guide of several notable scholars, up until his death on 24 January 2011. Al-Amri's son Hashim resumed his father's prayer leading position (Imam) at Medina's first Shia mosque, located at his father's farm.http://www.rohama.org/en/content/479  References   Further reading  *The Nakhāwila, a Shia Community in Medina Past and Present, Werner Ende, Die Welt des Islams, New Series, Vol. 37, Issue 3, Shiites and Sufis in Saudi Arabia, (Nov., 1997), pp. 263–348 *Marja and the Survival of a Community: The Shia of Medina, Yousif al-Khoei in \\"The Most Learned of the Shiʻa: The Institution of the Marjaʻ Taqlid\\", ed Linda Walbridge, 2001, Oxford University Press US *More Questions than Answers: The Origin of the Nakhāwila, Werner Ende in I.

This enables real-world systems to be simulated and tested with a computer. Purpose Since the early 1961s computer systems have been able to simulate real-world dynamic situations, such as the interaction between people in a public building such as an airport terminal. Models can be used to test the stresses imposed on an engineering structure without risk or construction cost. Modern uses include weather systems analysis and the effect on our planet Earth due to global warming. CSMP and its various versions were used extensively in the past when this software was first developed. Structure Like all computer programs its analytical and simulation programs are constructed from three general types of statements: *Structural statements, which define the model. They consist of FORTRAN-like programming language statements, and functional blocks of program code (procedures) designed for repeat operations that frequently occur in a model definition. *Data statements, which assign numerical values to various changing parameters, constants, and initial conditions. *Control statements, which specify options in assembly and execution of the program, and the choice of output of the results of the calculations performed. Structural statements can make use of the operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and exponentiation, using the same notation and syntax rules as are used in FORTRAN. If, for example, the model includes the equation :X=6Y/W+(Z-2)^2 the following statement will be used to define the variables and calculus performed: x=6.0*Y/W+(Z-2.0)**2.0 Randomisation Random variation to values can be added to some parts of the model to simulate unpredictable behaviour patterns in dynamic wind-loaded structures, such as high-rise buildings or aircraft wing designs. Modern variations The earlier CSMP III text-based programming language has been superseded by variations such as APL and object oriented computer-language modelling versions of CSMP such as OOSCMP.
