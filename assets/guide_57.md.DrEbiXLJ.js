Description and history Unity's town hall is located in its rural village center, on the west side of the 2nd New Hampshire Turnpike just north of Center Road. It is a single-story wood frame structure, with a gabled roof and clapboarded exterior. It has modest Greek Revival styling, with plain cornerboards and a cornice with decorative molding. An entry pavilion projects from the main block, echoing its decorative features, and there is a two-stage tower with an open belfry. The two entrances are topped by Federal-style fanlights, and there is a half-eye window in the pavilion's gable. The tower's first stage has louvered openings with half-round fanlight tops, and is itself crowned by a low balustrade with urned posts. The belfry, with arched openings, is crowned by a similar but smaller balustrade, which surround a cupola and weathervane. The structure was built in 1831 as a church for the local Baptist congregation which was organized in 1794. Although its builder is unknown, the building's design is strongly influenced by the work of Elias Carter, a builder responsible for a number of period churches further south. The Baptists sold the church to the town in 1877.

The town common began as a parcel acquired in 1787, and the current town hall followed in 1789. It is a two-story wood frame building which originally served as both a civic and religious meeting house. The adjacent Gothic Revival Congregational Church was built in 1840. The third structure is the Schoolhouse, a -story two-room school built in 1883. The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1986. Buildings Washington's town common is a two-acre parcel purchased from a local farmer in 1787. It is located at the junction of New Hampshire Route 31 and Half Moon Pond Road, and is a roughly oval grassy area, fringed on the north by the gravel access road for the public buildings that line its north side. On the right is the town hall, a rectangular two-story gable-roofed structure. When built, its main entrance was on the long side facing the common, and there was no tower. The tower projects from the west facade, rising as a square above the main ridge, with two open octagonal stages capped by a bell-shaped cupola above. The tower was added in 1820, and in 1843 the gallery space was converted into a full second story. Despite these changes, elements of the original galleries and box pews survive. It is believed to be one of the oldest meeting houses in the state to still be in active civic use. To the left of the town hall stands the school, with its gable end facing the common. There are two entrances on the front facade, set near the building corners. A small belfry with shallow pyramidal roof rises above the main roof ridge. The school was built as a one-room schoolhouse, with the upper floor used for a variety of other purposes before c. 1960, when it was turned into a second classroom. An ell extends to the rear, providing space for modern plumbing and heating. The Congregational church stands at the left (west) end of the assemblage. Its principal Gothic features are the fan in the front gable, and the pointed-arch openings in the belfry of the tower. The pyramidal pinnacles found at the tower corners are also a Gothic feature. The common was historically lined with a larger number of buildings, but a major fire in 1830 destroyed 21 buildings and damaged the meeting house.

The sculpture is proposed to be a ribbon of twisted, white stainless steel, representing the shape of a cloud, originally designed to be and with a span of 53 metres (174 ft). It is intended to \\"frame\\" the Sydney Town Hall, and be visible from all approach directions as part of the pedestrianisation of the street. A light rail line running up George Street is under construction and would run through the arch. The feet of Cloud Arch will be placed on diagonally opposite corners of one of Sydney's busiest intersections, George and Park Street; the sculpture will stand among the Town Hall, the Queen Victoria Building, and The Galeries Victoria. Originally it was to be installed in 2019 but due to the increased costs ($22m, over the initial estimate of $9m) and disputes about site access during the construction of the light rail, planning for the project was postponed until 2020.  Announcement  The sculpture was announced on 29 July 2014 as part of a $9 million package of public artworks for Sydney. Cloud Arch was originally expected to cost $3.5 million. The four other artists shortlisted for the George Street sculpture were New Zealander Bill Culbert, Song Dong of China, Australian Mikala Dwyer, and Ugo Rondinone of Switzerland. Announced at the same time were Pavilion by Hany Armanious, a milk crate to be placed in Belmore Park, and The Distance of Your Heart by Tracey Emin, to consist of 60 bronze bird sculptures perched on poles and above doorways in the northern end of the central business district. Development applications for the sculptures were to be lodged by the end of 2015.  Remodelling  In 2017, the design was remodelled as a result of the original being incompatible with requirements of the new light rail infrastructure running beneath it. Trams will pass beneath the arch as part of the new south east light rail network, which links Circular Quay and Central Station through George Street. The sculpture's new design was necessary to compensate for the subterranean changes. It requires more steel, is wider and heavier than the one originally proposed (now at 53 metres wide using 140 tonnes of steel, rather than 28.5 metres wide using 58 tonnes). The increased width and the rise in cost from the initial expectation of to $11.3 million, explained as due to changes in the price of steel since 2015, were both criticised, although it was pointed out that the city spends two-thirds that amount every year for temporary works for Sydney New Year's Eve. On 29 August 2017, a six to four majority of city councillors voted to approve the sculpture. It was originally expected to be completed by March 2019, to coincide with the original planned opening of the George Street light rail line.  Critical response  Immediate reactions to the announcement of the sculpture were broadly supportive, with positive responses from professional critics, one of whom wrote: \\"its dance like thrown ribbon in the sky, will excite Sydney's municipal heart, a lasso to the heavens\\". Popular reaction was dominated by dismissive similes ‚Äì comparisons of Cloud Arch to everyday objects, and whimsical nicknames for the work, such as \\"space noodle\\". However, as one writer explained: \\"Good art makes us see something anew. It's not about money, or tourism, or popularity. It's about insight ‚Äì and if it comes with delight and wit, all the better.\\" During the December 2018 city council debate to defer the project it was described by opposition politicians as a ‚Äúridiculous vanity project‚Äù, the same week The Sydney Morning Herald ran an editorial strongly defending the project.

The feature was introduced by SanDisk in a partnership with Intel. Some think that the initiative could make laptops feel like they power on basically instantaneously, while others state that this means that laptops can stay on all the time, and always be available with no adverse effects on battery life. In traditional low-power modes, SATA link still needs to remain powered on to allow the device to receive a wake-up command. With DevSlp, rarely used 3.3 V pins of the SATA power plug will be used for the DevSlp signal instead of providing 3.3 V power. This signal can wake up the drive, and it will allow SATA link to be shut down, reducing further the power consumption. Due to the way they work, DevSleep-enabled drives may not be suitable for most desktop PCs and some notebooks with the 3.3 V voltage present in their SATA power connectors; the presence of 3.3 V results in DevSleep-enabled drives remaining in DevSlp state. An incompatibility between a desktop mainboard and a SATA SSD may be resolved by disabling the DevSleep feature using a power connector adapter that does not pass the +3.3 V line.

Approximately south of Beebe is the Von Damm Vent Field. At nearly below sea level, Beebe is the world's deepest known hydrothermal vent site and one of the few known to reside in the abyssopelagic. The hydrothermal plume nicknamed \\"Piccard\\" was detected in 2010, and the Beebe site was discovered later that year. The vent field hosts two main areas of black smoker venting, with a fluid at temperatures of over 400 ¬∞C and a low salinity of about 2.3 wt% NaCl. Under these conditions, the venting fluid is supercritical at the vent orifice, and is the only site shown to host sustained supercritical venting. The combined depth and vent fluid temperature make it a popular site for studying aqueous thermodynamics, high- pressure biology, and geochemistry.  Geography  Bathymetry profile of the Mid-Cayman trough and spreading center. The Beebe vent field is located at the northern end of the Mid-Cayman Rise on the segments closest to the Septentrional-Oriente fault zone. The entirety of the field resides on the western side of the axial valley. The Beebe vent field consists of 7 sulfide mounds, the majority of which are inactive. Central to the field are the main endmember vents, known as Beebe 1 - 5 which branch from the same mound. Surrounding these endmember vents are Hot Chimlet to the north, Beebe Sea to the East, and Beebe Woods to the South. The series of mounds continue to the northeast of the field, where high-temperature hydrothermal activity used to take place as evidenced by extinct chimneys.  Geology  The Beebe vent field is located in the very near vicinity of the spreading center, which has been described as an ultraslow ridge at a rate of to per year. The area is primarily basalt, with metal-sulfide mounds and talus sourced from hydrothermal activity. = Chimneys = Approaching the Beebe vent complex at the Beebe (Piccard) hydrothermal field. Beebe vents 1 - 5 form a branching complex consisting of pyrite, pyrrhotite, and other oxidized metal-sulfides. These chimneys emit the hottest temperature fluids of anywhere within the field, up to . Beebe Woods to the south has a similar geological composition, though temperatures are cooled slightly (). These temperatures are hot enough that iron has not yet precipitated, giving the chimneys a distinctive black- smoker appearance. These metal-sulfide chimneys are conductive of precious and semi-precious mineral precipitation, such as gold, silver, and copper. Hot Chimlet to the north features venting at a significantly lower temperature (), such that the fluids are clear and devoid of metals. Residing on the slope of the mound, the Hot Chimlet site has a light dusting of sulfide materials likely sourced from the center of the field. Hot Chimlet also does not have the impressive chimney structures as at the center of the field, and requires the use of dive markers to identify quickly. Shrimp Gulley, similarly, is a location within the Beebe Sea which is distinguished by abundant biology. The Gulley reaches temperatures around , with markers also required to find the exact locations of diffuse flow. Profuse venting at the Beebe Vent Field.  Chemistry  As with many basalt-hosted systems, Beebe has endmember fluids that are highly acidic in association with basalt dissolution reactions. Such reactions with basalt can be favorable in forming hydrothermal ore deposits. Extreme temperatures and depth are favorable conditions for phase separation, such that measured amounts of chlorine are depleted relative to seawater (similarly to the Rainbow Vent Field on the Mid-Atlantic Ridge). These hot, acidic conditions make precipitation of metal-sulfide chimneys possible, also giving the hottest vents their characteristic black-smoker appearance. = Organic compounds = With abundant iron in the venting plume, there have been many models examining the potential of ligands binding to iron when mixing begins with seawater. These ligands prevent the precipitation of iron in mineral phases, potentially making them bioavailable. High temperatures acting on seawater can cause diagenesis of organic compounds, such that they break up into smaller compounds or alter bond configurations.  Biology  Beebe has an abundance of shrimp present at venting orifices, particularly those of Rimicaris hybisae, belonging to the family of Alvinocarididae, and are almost completely blind. These shrimp have eyes as juveniles but lose them as they age, developing a light-sensing organ that they can use to detect the infrared glow of hot, venting locations. The shrimp at the Beebe vent field are unique from those found at the Von Damm field in that they are a slightly more brown color due to the high concentrations of iron pumped out by the vents. There is also an abundance of deep sea anemones and solitary squat lobsters. As with other vent fields, it is possible for sharks or roaming fishes such as grenadiers or wreckfish to appear around the field. Rimicaris hybisae at the Beebe Vent Field. From a microbial standpoint, there are visible mats of microbial activity at both the Beebe and Von Damm vent systems. Microorganisms are suggested utilize hydrogen and sulfide in venting fluids to metabolize chemosynthetically. Some of these microorganisms are present on or within vent crustaceans, being routinely grazed or taking up roles as symbiotic organisms.  Naming  The hydrothermal system was suggested to exist on an American-led oceanographic cruise in 2009 on the R/V Cape Hatteras, with 3 hydrothermal plumes detected in the water column: Piccard, Walsh, and Europa. Beebe was visually confirmed in early 2010 on a British-led expedition with the RRS James Cook, though the Piccard plume could not be found, so the vent field was named Beebe. Americans returned to the vent field in 2011 on the Okeanos Explorer prior to scientific publications from the previous mission, and named the vent field Piccard, therefore creating a second name for the vent field. The Interridge Database lists the vent field as Beebe, though many American journals publish results under the name of Piccard. The original name for the detected plume, Piccard, may come from Jacques Piccard, a Swiss oceanographer that dove with Don Walsh to the Challenger Deep. The subsequent naming of Beebe is after the American naturalist William Beebe who frequently dove in the Bathysphere prior to powered submersibles.  Jurisdiction  Due to the nearness of Beebe to the Cayman Islands, the vent field falls under British jurisdiction.

Canuto and Xu Xiaoxi. Headed by actress Alexandra Smothers, the film features an ensemble cast also starring Alejandra Walker, Ellen Clifford, Javier Lopez, Kjord Davis, and Jesus Guevara. Revolving around an eccentric and dysfunctional Mexican immigrant family living in Los Angeles, California, the film is divided into three parts, each one with a story reflecting a family member (mother Carmen, daughter Bess and son Andrea) and the relationship that they establish with a new neighbor, a prostitute (Lucy Bell). Plot The story follows a Mexican immigrant family's life in the United States following a tragic accident. The family's matriarch, Carmen (Alejandra Walker), is a widowed single mother of two, who wants to ‚Äúfix‚Äù her teenage son's ‚Äúconfusion‚Äù about his sexuality, and seeks solace through her religious beliefs. Her daughter Bess (Ellen Clifford), a curious but sheltered young girl who hides from the world by the clothes she wears and by her behavior, so the world sees her as odd and unusual. And Andrea (Javier Lopez), her teenage son, whose emerging sexuality is of concern to his mother and her religious beliefs, and then he falls for a streetwise man whom he sees as his way to escape to freedom. Each of the family members is coping with a family altering accident in their own way. As they endure their loneliness and the turmoil of maturing, each encounters unique experiences and a lasting special relationship with their ostentatious and passionate new neighbor, Lucy Bell (Alexandra Smothers), a companion for hire.

The film was initially conceived as the directors' thesis film as part of their MFA degree at the New York Film Academy (NYFA) at Universal Studios in Hollywood. After the directors' graduation, the film was re-edited and the post-production was completed. Scene from Desire Street with Alexandra Smothers and Alejandra Walker. Desire Street was filmed on Super 16mm film and principal photography lasted three and half weeks, taking place in August 2009, with temperatures reaching and higher. The directors' intentions behind Desire Street were to explore the elements of sex and desire as the main themes of the film. They tried to create characters that, under different circumstances, either repress these instincts (due to influences from the society, personal tragedies, etc.) or use it freely as the hooker does in the film. Canuto and Xu take as a reference the Mexican melodramas of the 1960s. They exaggerate the representation of the characters to accentuate the irony that is a basic element in the story, creating many situations of comedy. At the end of the story the family became the main reference for the individual survival. Desire Street has \\"a unique perspective, exploring social aspects and family issues with a melodramatic, but at times humoristic tone. This is conveyed with very bold and colorful characters and a dynamic narration. The message that the directors wish to bring to the film and its audience is a respect for others irrespective of their sexuality, race, or profession. Also the film highlights the importance of family support for any teenagers who are struggling with their sexuality and differences to the stereotypes that the society creates \\". The film touches themes like immigration, prostitution, homosexuality, lesbianism or bulling at a young age, themes that can be seen as controversial by the approach taken in the movie. Image from Desire Street with Ellen Clifford.  Reception  The film was well received in the film festivals where it was screened, including some awards. At the premiere in Mix Mexico International Film Festival 2011, Desire Street received a \\"Special Mention for Best Feature Film\\". The jury mention at the ceremony that the award was deserved due to \\"a very well structured script, strong story and great characters\\". In 2014 the film received two nominations and the award for Best Feature Film at the Asturian Film Festival (Festival De Cine Asturianu) 2014 in a ceremony celebrated at the Ateneo of Madrid. The jury highlight that Desire Street \\"develop, with technical mastery and a good treatment of the script, the generation gap and the family and sexual conflicts in a multiethnic society\\". Desire Street critics reviews were also positive, highlighting the structure of the script and some film techniques, together with the actors performances: ‚àó \\"...these characters could be from an Almodovar movie as they seem to need to behave in extraordinary ways in order to draw some sexual, psychological advantage...The use of subjective camera movement, composition and mirrored reflections are effective in conveying a real sense of false perceptions since the seeing is not real. Coupled with this is the technique of revisiting of previously seen scenes, but from a different perspective per time. This subversive type of shooting is not new to cinematography, but it is used to great effect in this application...The collaborations of Roberto Canuto and Xu Xiaoxi make them the future wave as these two engaging directors bring together fresh insight with redesigned camera work.\\" from Dickie King at MTG, 2011 (South Africa).

The project builds on the maritime expedition routes of Admiral Zheng He. The maritime silk road essentially runs from the Chinese coast to the south via Hanoi to Jakarta, Singapore and Kuala Lumpur through the Strait of Malacca via the Sri Lankan Colombo towards the southern tip of India via Mal√©, to the East African Mombasa, from there to Djibouti, then through the Red Sea via the Suez Canal to the Mediterranean, there via Haifa, Istanbul and Athens to the Upper Adriatic region to the northern Italian hub of Trieste with its international free port and its rail connections to Central Europe and the North Sea. The China‚ÄìPakistan Economic Corridor is an extension to the proposed Silk Road. The Maritime Silk Road coincides with the theory of China's String of Pearls strategy.  History  The Maritime Silk Road initiative was first proposed by Chinese leader Xi Jinping during a speech to the Indonesian Parliament in October 2013. In November 2014, Chinese leader Xi Jinping announced plans to create a USD $40B development fund, which would help finance China's plans to develop the New Silk Road and the Maritime Silk Road. China has accelerated its drive to draw Africa into the MSR by speedy construction of a modern standard-gauge rail link between Nairobi and Mombasa. In March 2015, the National Development and Reform Commission of the People's Republic of China publicly released a document titled Vision and Actions on Jointly Building Silk Road Economic Belt and 21st-Century Maritime Silk Road, which discusses the principles and framework which form the foundation of the initiative.  Routes and Key Ports  Although the routes encompassed in the MSR will be copious if the initiative comes to fruition, to date there has not been ample official information released concerning specific ports. Between 2015 and 2017, China has leased ownership over the following ports: * Gwadar, Pakistan: 40 years * Kyaukpyu, Myanmar: 50 years * Kuantan, Malaysia: 60 years * Obock, Djibouti: 10 years * Malacca Gateway: 99 Years * Hambantota, Sri Lanka: 99 years * Muara, Brunei: 60 years * Feydhoo Finolhu, Maldives: 50 years In the 2018 Xinhua-Baltic International Shipping Centre Development Index Report, the China Economic Information Service cites the following as major routes for the 21st Century Maritime Silk Road: = China - Southeast Asia Route =  China-Vietnam, Myanmar  Qinzhou - Yangpu - Zhanjiang - Gaolan Port - Yantian - Nansha - Ho Chi Minh City (Vietnam) - Singapore - Yangon (Myanmar) - Palawan (Philippines) - Singapore - Qinzhou.

Potential routes proposed for the MSR could contribute to increasing tensions over certain areas. However, some academics propose that the MSR initiative will provide a means for China to resolve these sovereignty-related conflicts by providing an opportunity for mutual gain. It has been suggested that the future of the MSR will be largely dictated by the economic conditions of the participating countries.Blanchard, J.-M. F. (2017). Probing China‚Äôs Twenty-First-Century Maritime Silk Road Initiative (MSRI): An Examination of MSRI Narratives. Geopolitics, 22(2), 246‚Äì268. The possibility exists that China may have to make financial contributions to other MSR countries who are experiencing poor economic conditions. China will need to ensure that any loans allocated to these countries are spent appropriately.Ibid. Coordination on the national and subnational levels may be challenging for China. It has been stated that China's subnational actors - such as multinational corporations, provinces, cities, and towns - have a tendency to strongly prioritize their own interests above those of the nation and participate in government initiatives primarily to satisfy their own objectives. This could lead to inappropriate spending on projects outside the scope of China's national interests.Ibid Gaining political approval from countries with different political systems could prove problematic for China. Countries may be weary about joining the MSR initiative due to geopolitical and security factors.Ibid. Concerns have been put forth regarding whether China will be able to receive India's cooperation and participating in bringing the initiative to fruition.J.

India represents a strong economic force and may likely prefer to develop the Indian Ocean region's infrastructure itself rather than allow China to have any control over the region. While Chinese investment in India's underdeveloped maritime infrastructure could benefit India's economy greatly, India remains wary to accept such investment as the possibility exists that China is primarily attempting to expand its own territorial and economic interests.Palit, Amitendu (2017-04-03). \\"India's Economic and Strategic Perceptions of China's Maritime Silk Road Initiative\\".

DHS would also be required to create a strategy for recruiting and training additional cybersecurity employees. The bill was introduced into the United States House of Representatives during the 113th United States Congress. Background Computer security (also known as cybersecurity or IT security) is information security as applied to computing devices such as computers and smartphones, as well as computer networks such as private and public networks, including the Internet. The field covers all the processes and mechanisms by which computer-based equipment, information and services are protected from unintended or unauthorized access, change or destruction, and is of growing importance in line with the increasing reliance on computer systems of most societies worldwide.\\"Reliance spells end of road for ICT amateurs\\", May 07, 2013, The Australian Provisions of the bill This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the Congressional Research Service, a public domain source. The Homeland Security Cybersecurity Boots-on-the-Ground Act would require the United States Secretary of Homeland Security to: (1) develop occupation classifications for individuals performing activities in furtherance of the cybersecurity mission of the United States Department of Homeland Security (DHS), (2) ensure that such classifications may be used throughout DHS and are made available to other federal agencies, and (3) assess the readiness and capacity of DHS to meet its cybersecurity mission. The bill would define \\"cybersecurity mission\\" as threat and vulnerability reduction, deterrence, incident response, resiliency, and recovery activities to foster the security and stability of cyberspace. The bill would direct the Secretary, acting through the DHS Chief Human Capital Officer and Chief Information Officer, to include in such readiness assessment information on which cybersecurity positions are performed by: (1) permanent full-time departmental employees (together with demographic information about such employees' race, ethnicity, gender, disability status, and veterans status); (2) individuals employed by independent contractors; and (3) individuals employed by other federal agencies, including the National Security Agency (NSA). Requires the assessment to address vacancies within the supervisory workforce, job training, and recruiting costs. The bill would direct the Secretary to develop: (1) a workforce strategy that enhances the readiness, capacity, training, recruitment, and retention of the DHS cybersecurity workforce, including a multiphased recruitment plan, a 5-year implementation plan, and a 10-year projection of federal workforce needs; and (2) a process to verify that employees of independent contractors who serve in DHS cybersecurity positions receive initial and recurrent information security and role-based security training commensurate with assigned responsibilities. The bill would require the Secretary to provide Congress with annual updates regarding such strategies, assessments, and training. The bill would require the Comptroller General (GAO) to study and report to the Secretary and Congress with respect to such assessments and strategies. The bill would direct the Secretary to report to Congress regarding the feasibility of establishing a Cybersecurity Fellowship Program to offer a tuition payment plan for undergraduate and doctoral candidates who agree to work for DHS for an agreed-upon period of time. Congressional Budget Office report This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the Congressional Budget Office, as reported by the House Committee on Homeland Security on December 12, 2013. This is a public domain source. H.R. 3107 would require the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to undertake several actions designed to improve the readiness and capacity of DHS‚Äôs cybersecurity workforce. In particular, the bill would require that DHS prepare a report on that workforce‚Äîbased on occupational classifications‚Äîassessing training, hiring, vacancies, and other factors that could affect readiness. The bill also would require DHS to develop a cybersecurity workforce strategy that would enable the department to develop and retain an effective cybersecurity workforce. In preparing the assessments and strategy required by the bill, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) expects that DHS would be able to draw from several similar federal efforts‚Äîsuch as the National Cybersecurity Workforce Framework, the Information Technology Workforce Assessment for Cybersecurity, and DHS‚Äôs Coordinated Recruiting and Outreach Strategy‚Äîand therefore, that the cost of completing those new requirements would total less than $500,000. The bill also would require DHS to maintain documentation verifying that contractors who serve in cybersecurity roles at DHS receive the training necessary to perform their assigned responsibilities. CBO anticipates that effort would require additional staffing and resources. Based on the cost of similar personnel, CBO estimates that implementing that requirement would cost approximately $2 million over the 2014-2019 period, subject to the availability of appropriated funds. Enacting H.R. 3107 would not affect direct spending or revenues; therefore, pay-as-you-go procedures do not apply. H.R. 3107 contains no intergovernmental or private-sector mandates as defined in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act and would not affect the budgets of state, local, or tribal governments. Procedural history The Homeland Security Cybersecurity Boots-on-the-Ground Act was introduced into the United States House of Representatives by Rep. Yvette D. Clarke (D, NY-9). The bill was referred to the United States House Committee on Homeland Security and the United States House Homeland Security Subcommittee on Cybersecurity, Infrastructure Protection, and Security Technologies. On December 12, 2013, the bill was reported (amended) alongside House Report 113-294. On July 28, 2014, the House voted in Roll Call Vote 457 to pass the bill 395-8. Debate and discussion Rep. Bennie Thompson (D-MS), who co-sponsored the bill, said that \\"DHS' success depends on how well it recruits, hires, and trains its cyber workforce.\\" Rep. Pat Meehan (R-PA) supported the bill, saying that \\"the cyber risk is among the most serious our nation faces today. Terrorist groups like Hamas, nation-states like Iran, China and Russia and criminal gangs across the world are constantly attempting to breach our systems. But existing laws that have been on the books for years are not designed to cope with the threat.\\" See also *List of bills in the 113th United States Congress References External links *Library of Congress - Thomas H.R. 3107 *beta.congress.gov H.R. 3107 *GovTrack.us H.R. 3107 *OpenCongress.org H.R. 3107 *WashingtonWatch.com H.R. 3107 *Congressional Budget Office's report on H.R. 3107 Category:Proposed legislation of the 113th United States Congress ","title":"Homeland Security Cybersecurity Boots-on-the-Ground Act"},{"id":"43422492","text":"Walter Kenneth Martinez, Sr. (November 16, 1930 ‚Äì May 11, 1986) was an American attorney and politician who served as a member of the New Mexico House of Representatives. A liberal member of the Democratic Party, he served as speaker of the House for eight years. before being removed from the position in 1979, when conservative Democrats allied with Republicans to elect a conservative Democrat as speaker. Early life and education Martinez was born in Tierra Amarilla, New Mexico, one of eleven children in poor but well- educated family. He studied law at the University of New Mexico and graduated in 1955. He became a general legal practitioner with the firm of Tibo Chavez and Boucher and established an office in Grants, New Mexico. Career In 1966, Martinez was elected to the New Mexico House of Representatives as a Democrat representing Valencia County, New Mexico. He served in the House for eighteen years. Until 1971, the House had been dominated by conservative Democrats, mostly from the south and east of New Mexico. That had begun to change after the Supreme Court \\"one man, one vote\\" decision in Baker v. Carr (1962), which forced electoral districts to be more balanced in size and led to growing numbers of liberal Hispanic and urban intellectual representatives. In 1971, when Martinez was in his first term, the position of speaker came open. After a tie on the first vote, Martinez was elected speaker by a one- vote margin. For eight years Martinez was one of the leaders of the liberal \\"Mama Lucy Gang\\", which controlled the house and prevented conservative \\"Cowboy Democrats\\" from the ranching areas in the south of the state from controlling the main committees. Another leader was Raymond G. Sanchez. Martinez's achievements included equalizing school district funding across the state and developing New Mexico's severance tax permanent fund. In 1977 Martinez was chosen as candidate for speaker of the Democratic caucus by 26‚Äì22, going on to reelection as speaker. The Cowboys did well in the 1978 election and demanded a strong presence in the committees. Martinez refused, which turned out to be a mistake. He was then chosen the Democratic caucus by 30 votes to 11 for Gene Samberson. During the opening session of the house on January 16, 1979, eleven Democrats allied with twenty six Republicans to elect the Cowboy Democrat Gene Samberson as speaker by thirty seven votes against the thirty Democrats and three rogue Republicans who voted for Martinez. The Mama Lucy Gang remained out of power for the next four years. Martinez and Joseph Fidel worked together to obtain funding for many projects in the Grants area. In 1981 Martinez was the main force behind the legislation that split Cibola County, New Mexico, out of Valencia County. Grants was the seat of the new county. In the 1982 election, the liberal Democrats formed a solid majority of the forty seven Democrat members, and the Martinez-backed candidate Raymond G. Sanchez was elected speaker without opposition from the Cowboys. Personal life Martinez was married to Dolores Nolasco. They had three children, a girl and two boys, all of whom became lawyers. His eldest son, W. Ken Martinez, served as a member of the New Mexico House of Representatives from 1998 to 2016. His daughter became a district judge. His youngest son served on the Grants Board of Education. Martinez was diagnosed with Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (Lou Gehrig's disease) and left the House in 1984. He died in 1986 at the age of 55. An enclosed walkway linking the Capitol and the newly built Capitol Annex was dedicated to Martinez in 2001.The University of New Mexico School of Law posthumously awarded his the Distinguished Achievement award.

Erected in 1844, it was the first social hall or club house ever built on the North American Pacific Coast. It was the hall of the Sociedad Econ√≥mica de los Amigos del Pa√≠s (Friends of the Country), a society or club made up of the leading citizens of the town, both native and foreign born, who, during the 1840s, formed a group with the dual purposes of providing pensions and stimulating the reading of literature. A lot, 100 varas square, free of taxes, was granted the society by the Ayuntamiento. An adobe building was erected and fitted up with a dancing hall, reading room and card tables. The hall was dedicated by a grand ball and a number of social entertainments were held. The Amigos for a time enjoyed their social privileges, and the society flourished. But it was a time of revolutions and political disturbances. In time social amenities gave place to political animosities. Although the members were \\"Friends of the Country,\\" they became enemies to one another. The society ran in debt. Its membership fell off. The building was finally put up at a lottery. Andr√©s Pico drew the lucky number. The Amigos del Pais disbanded during the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War. Their hall in the course of time became a saloon and afterwards it was \\"Los dos Amigos,\\" (\\"the two friends\\") ‚Äîthe friend behind the bar and the one in front of it. The McDonald Block, on North Main Street, was later built on the site of the Amigos‚Äô hall. Reading room The hall was the first attempt at a reading room and library during the Mexican era of Los Angeles‚Äô history. A reading room was partitioned off from the main hall and a small library of books was collected. There were no daily newspapers in the reading room.

He developed the Herbarium of the University and Coimbra Botanical Garden. He also founded the Broterian Society, which brought together various scientists botanists, geologists and naturalists. He was a large admirer of the work of Charles Darwin.Thomas F. Glick and Elinor Shaffer . p. 580 He also wrote many articles about the flora of Portugal. Biography Henriques was born on 15 January 1838, in the parish of Arco de Ba√∫lhe. In 1853, he married Zulmira Angelina de Magalh√£es Lima. He went to school in the city of Braga. In 1854, he trained to become a lawyer at College of S√£o Bento in Coimbra, (following his fathers wishes). He completed his law course in 1859, but then enrolled on a second college course in Philosophy at the University of Coimbra. After gaining a bachelor's degree in Philosophy, he went on to obtain a Ph.D. doctorate. Henriques was a supporter of Darwinism. His final thesis in 1865, was entitled As esp√©cies s√£o mud√°veis? (translated as Are species modifiable?) was a defence of Charles Darwin's theory of evolution. In 1866, he became a tutor in Philosophy at the University of Coimbra. He soon became secretary of the Philosophy Faculty, which he held until 1873. In 1869, he became a substitute lecturer in botany, agriculture, zoology, chemistry and mineralogy. He most favoured botany and the plant sciences, and then in 1873, this new found passion lead to him becoming head of the Botany and Agriculture. This also meant being in charge of the university botanical garden. Using other botanical gardens in Europe as his guide, he achieved new funding for the department. He acquired new laboratory resources, increased fieldwork opportunities for his botany students. He re-organised the books, to create a library, then he re-organised the botanical specimens to create a herbarium. This new plant collection attracted others, including a vast number of specimens from the German collector Heinrich Moritz Willkomm (who collected in Spain and Portugal). He also added to the Botanical Garden, by collaborating (via exchanges of plants and seeds) with other botanical gardens and plant organisations. This invigoration within the botany department, turned Coimbra into a national centre for studying Portuguese flora. In 1876, he wrote O Jardim Botanico, published by University Press. In 1880, he was still in contact with Heinrich Moritz Willkomm, with several letters being sent between the two botanists. In 1880, he founded the Sociedade Broteriana, which was named in honour after F√©lix Avelar Brotero (a botanist and founder of the Botanical Garden. The botanical society brought together plant enthusiasts from all over Portugal, to write various articles in the society's bulletins.Julio Augusto Henriques, Aur√©lio Pereira da Silva Quintanilha and Luiz Wittnich Carrisso (Editors) and disseminate information about plants throughout the country. Henriques became to travel all over the country to collect more specimens for the University and the herbarium. He also started classifying and identifying the herbarium collection (including Willkomm's and his) specimens. He produced many articles and publications on the fungi, lichens, algae and vascular plants (such as Amaryllidaceae, Poaceae and Plantaginaceae) of Portugal and produced a regional flora of the Mondego Basin.Julio Augusto Henriques (1880) In 1882, Henriques published an article Carlos Darwin, which is devoted to Charles Darwin's life and works. In 1883, he published Expedi√ß√£o scientifica √° Serra da Estrella, in Sec√ß√£o de botanica, based on a botanical exploration taken of Serra da Estrela (Star Mountain range) in 1881. It listed 716 plants (including 600 vascular species).Sidney Fay Blake Julio Augusto Henriques (1880) In 1886, he published Uma excurs√£o botanica na Serra do Caramullo in Bol. Soc Broteriana, various geological, topographical and flora observations from explorations taken in June 1884. In 1886, he published Contribui√ß√£o para o estudo da flora d'Africa: Flora de S. Thome about flora of the Portuguese commonwealth in Africa, he collected in S√£o Tom√© and Pr√≠ncipe as well, and is responsible for publishing the first flora of these islands in 1886. He was also interested in the development of agriculture on S√£o Tom√© and Pr√≠ncipe and in Angola, publishing instructions on successful cultivation of certain crop species (particularly quinine for its protective qualities against malaria), and sending over thousands of species of potential agricultural interest. In 1889, he published Lecanora newtoniana (a species of Lichen) in Ins. Guin.: 17 (1889). He studied specimens from plant collectors, Frenchman Jules Alexandre Daveau (during 1852-1929) and M. Ferreira. (during 1860-1920). In 1901, he published De Macieira at√© Castro Daire in Bol. Soc Broteriana various geological, topographical and flora details of various regions in articles. Henriques did not hold a large number of administrative positions, preferring instead to concentrate on his teaching and running the gardens. In 1907, the University of Uppsala (in Sweden) awarded him an honorary doctorate but, as a particularly humble man, he often refused other recognition's. In 1915, he wrote a letter on 5 January from Jardim Bot√¢nico, Coimbra to Sir William Abbott Herdman, the letter is now stored by the Natural History Museum Archives in London. In 1917, he wrote A Ilha de S. Tom√©, sob o ponto de vista hist√≥rico-natural e agr√≠cola. He also wrote Plantas Da Borracha E Da Gutta-Percha (Portuguese Edition). It was re- published in paperback form on 27 January 2012. He is the botanical author of Iris boissieri. After his death in 1928, several articles Flora vascular de Transcow were published in Anais da Faculdade de Sci√™ncias do Porto in 1936 by Gon√ßalo Sampaio. This was a brief annotated list of 405 species of vascular plants collected by Henriques in July 1908. In 1955, Portugaliae acta biologica: Sistem√°tica, ecologia, biogeografia e paleontologia, Volumes 6-8 was also published.Julio Henriques In 1978, Sociedade Broteriana also published the letters sent between Julio Henriques and Heinrich Moritz Willkomm.

The book is set within the context of a country that was frantically trying to hold on to its self- proclaimed wartime neutrality, but it was increasingly caught in the middle of the economic, and naval, wars between the Allies and the Axis. In Brazil: The Fortunes of War, World War II and the Making of Modern Brazil, Lochery reveals a long-buried chapter of World War II, showing how the cunning statecraft and economic opportunism of Brazil's leaders, under the dictatorship of Get√∫lio Vargas, transformed it into a regional superpower and uncovers the little- known origins of one of the world‚Äôs emerging economic powerhouses. In 2013, he completed the first volume of a major work on the modern history of Portugal; Outside Looking In, 1933-1974. It tells the stories of the colourful array of international personalities who came to Lisbon during the one of the most controversial periods in its modern history, the period of the Portuguese Estado Novo.

The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) had not approved a new active ingredient in sunscreen since 1999, despite some sunscreens having been approved and used overseas for a decade. The new law gave the FDA one year to respond to the existing backlog of sunscreen ingredient approval requests, and then 18 months to reply to any future applications. The bill was introduced during the 113th United States Congress by Rep. Ed Whitfield (R, KY-1) and Sen. Jack Reed (D, RI), and signed into law by President Barack Obama on November 26, 2014. Background Sunscreen (also commonly known as sun screen, sunblock, suntan lotion, sunburn cream, sun cream or block out) is a lotion, spray, gel or other topical product that absorbs or reflects some of the sun's ultraviolet (UV) radiation on the skin exposed to sunlight and thus helps protect against sunburn. Depending on the mode of action, sunscreens can be classified into physical sunscreens (i.e., those that reflect the sunlight) or chemical sunscreens (i.e., those that absorb the UV light).Sunscreens  The Ageing Skin Medical organizations such as the American Cancer Society recommend the use of sunscreen because it aids in the prevention of squamous cell carcinomas.What You Need To Know About Skin Cancer Many sunscreens do not block UVA radiation, which does not cause sunburn but can increase the rate of melanoma and photodermatitis, so people using sunscreens may be exposed to high UVA levels without realizing it. The use of broad-spectrum (UVA/UVB) sunscreens can address this concern. Diligent use of sunscreen can also slow or temporarily prevent the development of wrinkles and sagging skin. Provisions of the bill This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the Congressional Research Service, a public domain source. The Sunscreen Innovation Act would amend the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to establish a process for the review and approval of over-the-counter (OTC) sunscreens. The bill would require the United States Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) to review and determine whether OTC sunscreens are generally recognized as safe and effective and ensure that any sunscreens marketed in the United States are appropriately labeled. The bill would make sunscreens that have been marketed for five continuous years in the United States or other countries and in sufficient quantity eligible for review under this Act. The bill would establish a framework for the review and approval by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) of OTC sunscreens with new active ingredients. Sets forth time frame requirements for review. Requires applications for review to include safety and efficacy data as well as adverse drug experience information. The bill would direct the Secretary to report on the progress made in issuing timely decisions on the safety and effectiveness of OTC sunscreens. The bill would require the Secretary to make determinations on the testing and labeling of aerosol sunscreens and on whether a sunscreen may contain a label indicating a sun protection factor (SPF) greater than 50. Congressional Budget Office report This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the Congressional Budget Office, as ordered reported by the House Committee on Energy and Commerce on July 15, 2014. This is a public domain source. H.R. 4250 would modify the review process that allows the marketing of certain new ingredients in non-prescription sunscreen based on a determination by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) that they are generally recognized as safe and effective. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates that implementing H.R. 4250 would cost $28 million over the 2015‚Äì2019 period, assuming appropriation of the necessary amounts. H.R. 4250 would not affect direct spending or revenues; therefore, pay-as-you-go procedures do not apply. H.R. 4250 contains no intergovernmental mandates as defined in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act (UMRA). The bill would impose private-sector mandates, as defined in UMRA, because it would allow FDA to require that marketing applications for certain sunscreen products be submitted in a new standardized format. CBO estimates that the direct cost of complying with those requirements would not exceed the annual threshold established by UMRA for private-sector mandates ($152 million in 2014, adjusted annually for inflation). Debate and discussion The Melanoma Research Alliance supported the bill. In a video produced by the group, a melanoma survivor said that \\"when I heard that there were actually ingredients that the FDA is basically holding hostage, it infuriates me, it's crazy.\\" The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported that in 2010 over 60,000 Americans were diagnosed with melanoma. The most common form of cancer in the United States is skin cancer. In 2009, chemical company and sunscreen manufacturer Ashland Inc. \\"significantly expanded its existing sunscreen production facilities in Columbus, Ohio, after the FDA announced it expected to make decisions on the pending ingredient applications before the end of the year.\\" Five years later, the FDA had still not made a decision and Ashland was unable to sell this type of sunscreen in the United States.

Having his first competitive race ride on 22 October 1979. His first winner came five months later at an Irish point- to-point meeting on 10 February 1980. His first of 311 professional victories came at Leopardstown when riding \\"Killeenyarda\\" in February 1982. Duggan took up his apprenticeship in England under the wing of Ulverston trainer Roger Fisher, where his association with horses such as Amarach and Aonoch came into fruition. It was in the 1983 Bula Hurdle at Cheltenham where at the age of 19 Duggan had his first big race winner when riding Amarach. On leaving the yard of Roger Fisher, Duggan moved south to the Lambourn stables of renowned champion trainer and former champion jockey Fred Winter, where he was to be associated with such horses as Aces Wild, Sailors Dance, Ulan Bator, Conquering and the only Fred Winter-owned horse in the yard Bargill. Also Duggan had two winning rides on Celtic Shot, before the partnership were bought down in the Supreme Novices' Hurdle at Cheltenham, he was subsequently to lose that ride to Peter Scudamore and they later won the 1986 Champion Hurdle. Along with Sailors Dance Duggan won the 1985 Scottish Champion Hurdle, at Ayr. When both Amarach and Aonoch were moved to trainer Sally Oliver's yard in Worcestershire, the association with the pair was continued. Unfortunately Amarach's racing career was cut short following a training injury. One of Jimmy Duggan's most memorable winning rides came at Aintree, Liverpool in the guise of the 1986 Sandemans Hurdle, where the partnership took on a number of top class hurdlers, including the three times and reigning Champion Hurdler, See You Then. The pair battled it out side by side up the run in to the line, Aonoch holding on to beat the champion by a neck, with Duggan giving Aonoch a tremendous ride of strength and precision, two of Duggan's trademarks The jockeys' most disappointing moment in his career was probably a ride on Aonoch, whom Duggan actually rode a total of 14 victories on, was undoubtedly in the 1986 Champion Hurdle for Sally Oliver, they were being touted for at the very least a place, however from the outset of the race Duggan had his fears that something was not quite right with fellow, Aonoch was not feeling right, not moving fluently, he never got into his running and was most disappointing, finishing tailed off and without ever once having been put into the race, most uncharacteristic of the little horse who was renowned as a battler. Duggan was quick to realise that the horse was suffering from corns, which was an ailment that plagued the horse from time to time. However, after the race it was realised that there was another factor to his bad running, in that the horse suffered a heavy blow to his head when at the fourth hurdle Corporal Clinger fell in front of Aonoch and caught him. On his return from the course Aonoch was bleeding profusely from both nostrils, which he recovered from. All of that was forgotten just 25 days later at Aintree with the famous victory over See You Then. Since retiring from the saddle, Jimmy Duggan has since moved to the United States where he has become a successful businessman, now married to his wife Jane (July 2003) with one daughter, Grace. Jimmy is also well known face on American television, as the voice of steeplechasing and leading steeplechase analyst in the country.

III c66) was the first United Kingdom Act of Parliament to attempt to regulate the hours and conditions of work of children in the cotton industry. It was introduced by Sir Robert Peel, who had first introduced a bill on the matter in 1815. The 1815 bill had been instigated by Robert Owen, but the Act as passed was much weaker than the 1815 bill; the Act forbade the employment of children under 9; children aged 9‚Äì16 years were limited to 12 hours' work per day and could not work at night.Early factory legislation. Parliament.uk. Accessed 1 August 2014. There was no effective means of its enforcement , but it established the precedent for Parliamentary intervention on conditions of employment which was followed by subsequent Factory Acts. Background The Health and Morals of Apprentices Act 1802 (42 Geo III c.73) had been introduced by Sir Robert Peel to improve conditions for apprentices working in cotton mills. Peel was one of the richest millowners in England, and had become concerned at the poor health of child apprentices working in his mills (which he blamed on 'gross mismanagement' by his subordinates) and in cotton mills in general. Early mills had been water-powered, and hence sited where there was a useful fall of water, rather than where there was an available workforce. Child apprentices had been widely used as a cheap and captive workforce. The Act required that cotton mills and factories be properly ventilated and basic requirements on cleanliness be met. Apprentices in these premises were to be given a basic education and to attend a religious service at least once a month. They were to be provided with clothing and their working hours were limited to no more than twelve hours a day (excluding meal breaks); they were not to work at night. The Act was not effectively enforced, and did not address the working conditions of 'free children' (children working in mills who were not apprentices). Improvements in the generation of rotary motion by steam engines made steam-powered cotton mills a practical proposition; they were already operating in Manchester in 1795, using free children drawn from the local population. The great advantage parish apprentices had had was that they were tied to the mill, no matter how remote the mill had to be to avail itself of water power. If the mill no longer had to be remote, it became a problem that the mill was tied to the apprentices. Apprentices had to be housed clothed and fed whether or not the mill could sell what they produced; they were in competition with free children whose wages would fall if the mill went on short time ( and might not reflect the full cost of housing clothing and feeding them, since that was incurred whether they were working or not) and who could be discharged if sick, injured or otherwise incapable of work. Consequently, the use of free children came to predominate: the Act became largely a dead letter within its limited scope, and inapplicable to most factory children. In 1819, a Lords Committee heard evidence from a Bolton magistrate who had investigated 29 local cotton mills; 20 had no apprentices but employed a total of 550 children under 14; the other nine mills employed a total of 98 apprentices, and a total of 350 children under 14. Apprentices were mostly found in the larger mills, which had somewhat better conditions; some even worked a 12-hour day or less (the Grant brothers' mill at Tottington worked an 11.5 hour day: \\"This establishment has perfect ventilation; all the apprentices, and in fact all the children, are healthy, happy, clean, and well clothed ; proper and daily attention is paid to their instruction ; and they regularly attend divine worship on Sundays.\\"): in other mills children worked up to 15 hours a day in bad conditions (e.g. Gortons and Roberts' Elton mill: \\"Most filthy; no ventilation; the apprentices and other children ragged, puny, not half clothed, and seemingly not half fed; no instruction of any sort; no human beings can be more wretched\\"). In 1815, Robert Owen, owner of a prosperous mill at New Lanark approached Peel with a draft Bill to regulate the use of children in the textile industry. Peel agreed to steer the Bill through Parliament. Owen's draft was given a First Reading late in the 1815 session (so that copies could be printed and sent out for consultation before the 1816 session; other bills were given similar 'advance notice' First Readings at the end of the 1815 session). In the 1816 session Peel chaired a Commons Committee collecting evidence intended to show the necessity for legislation. Peel did not bring forward a Bill in the 1817 session (because - he explained later \\\\- he was ill; he certainly withdrew from business in January 1817). In 1818 he did: the Bill got as far as the House of Lords, but lapsed when a General Election was called. In 1819, he again presented a Bill; the Lords felt it necessary to set up a Committee of their own to hear evidence on the issue; nonetheless in 1819 an Act was finally passed to regulate the working conditions of children working in cotton mills and factories. Provisions The Act passed in 1819 was only a pale shadow of Owen's draft of 1815. :The bill presented in 1815 :* Applied to all children in textile mills and factories. :* Children under ten were not to be employed :* Children between ten and eighteen could work no more than ten hours a day, with two hours for mealtimes and half an hour for schooling this made a 12.5 hour day. :* Magistrates were to be empowered to appoint paid inspectors (to be independent of the mills and factories they inspected) :* Inspectors were to be able to demand admission to mills at any time of day :The Act passed in 1819 :* Only applied to children in cotton mills and factories :*Children under nine were not to be employed :* Children between nine and sixteen could work no more than twelve hours a day (not including mealtimes or schooling); the twelve hours to be worked between 5 a.m. and 9 p.m.; at least half an hour to be allowed for breakfast, and a dinner break of at least an hour to be taken between 11 a.m. and 2 p.m.Statutes at Large, 59 Geo. III, c. 66, LXXIII, pp. 418-419 ;relevant excerpts reproduced at quoting since reprinted with same pagination by Psychology Press (1996, ) (an amending Act in the next session (60 Geo. III., c. 5) amended these limits to 11 a.m. to 4 p.m.) :* There was no provision for routine inspection of mills; if two witnesses gave information upon oath that a mill was breaking the Act, local magistrates could send their clerk (or a paid deputy) to inspect the mill. If the mill was indeed breaking the Act, then it was liable to further inspections without fresh informations being laid. The Act therefore did little more than establish the principle of government intervention and set forth a relatively unambitious and virtually unenforceable standard. An amending Act (60 Geo. III., c. 5) was passed in December 1819. It was introduced by Sir Robert Peel, who explained that \\"the object of the amendment was, when any accident by fire or otherwise took place in a factory, to allow the people thrown out of employment by such accident, to work by night, in such part of the works as were not destroyed, till the accident was made good. If this was not allowed, the worst consequences must arise, from letting loose on society a number of people without employment.\\" (Contemporary newspaper reports indicate that this followed a fire at one of the mills at New Lanark, and that Peel indicated that unless the Act was passed by the start of January, many of the workers there would become unemployed.) Objections Robert Owen blamed the failure to get an Act closely matching his bill passed on Peel's failure to move swiftly before opposition had a chance to get organised. However, the 1815 bill was extremely ambitious and the dates at which subsequent factory legislation matched its provisions (paid inspectors 1833 Act; ten-hour day 1847 Act, minimum age ten 1874 Act) do not suggest that if passed it would have been regarded as a definitive settlement. Objections to the much weaker 1819 bill were still strong and varied; a contemporary pro-bill pamphlet listed (and to its own satisfaction rebutted) eight different arguments against the bill, most of which were to continue to be urged against subsequent factory legislation for many years: # that nothing in the working conditions of mill children showed any need for legislation # that the bill is inquisitorial, interferes with free labor, with parental authority, and in effect with the labor of adults, because the adults cannot work without the children # that the bill would make British industry uncompetitive on the world market # that the bill created a dangerous precedent \\"If eleven hours actual labor be fixed as a maximum in Cotton Mills, how can Parliament refuse to impose a similar maximum for all other trades?\\" # that there was no need for legislation; enlightened millowners already saw the need for good working conditions; given time the rest would also # that restricting working hours was unfair to water-powered mills # that restricting the hours of children would mean millowners would employ men rather than children ‚Äì rather than benefitting children the bill would make them unemployable # that reducing the hours mills were operated would have a bad effect on the morals of the millworkers Notes References Footnotes Bibliography * Further reading  Category:United Kingdom Acts of Parliament 1819 Category:Health and safety in the United Kingdom Category:Occupational safety and health law ","title":"Cotton Mills and Factories Act 1819"},{"id":"43423029","text":"Daniel Wallace (born 14 April 1993) is a retired Scottish swimmer who has represented Great Britain in the Olympic Games and FINA world championships, and Scotland in the Commonwealth Games.

The old chapel has been converted into a centre for dance and is now known as Dansekapellet (Chapel of Dance). One of the cemetery‚Äôs main attractions is an avenue of Japanese cherry trees that, when in bloom during spring, form a long, pink tunnel. History Bispebjerg Cemetery was established in 1903 to release the pressure on Copenhagen's other cemeteries. The plan was designed by Edvard Gl√¶sel. Buildings The South Chapel =Chapel and administration building= The architect Andreas Clemmensen have designed most of the buildings in the cemetery. His contributions include the main entrance, the administration building at Frederiksborgvej 125 (1903), the North Chapel (1910), now used as a storage building, the South Chapel (1912), which in 1931 was rebuilt to designs by architect Tyge Hvass. Clemmensen also designed the East Chapel which was extended by Tyge Hvass in 1930 but demolished in 2001. The old crematory building, now Dansekapellet =Old crematory and personnel building= The old crematory was designed by Holger Jacobsen as the result of an architectural competition. The building was completed in 1907 with inspiration from Roman architecture. and later extended in 1915-16 and 1932-34. The building has now been converted into a venue for modern dance, Dansekapellet. The new crematory Holger Jacobsen has also designed a cluster of buildings in the northwestern corner of the cemetery. They date from 1916 and were used for storage purposes and personnel. Tyge Hvass added a stables building in 1935 and was also responsible for a larger extension of Jacobsen's buildings I 1945. =Crematory= A new crematory was inaugurated on 14 January 2003. The building was designed by Friis & Moltke. Sections The old communal burial site features a monument by Holger Jacobsen. The new communal burial site features a sculpture by Knud Nellemose. The Swedish section was established in 1927 and moved to the current location in Section 5 in 1957. It was designed by Sven-Ingvar Andersson. Other special sections are dedicated to Swedish, Russian, Catholic and Muslim graves. There is also a columbarium with a special room dedicated to Buddhist urns. =World War II= In the southwestern corner of the cemetery is a section dedicated to Danish soldiers, police officers and resistance fighters who died in World War II. The complex was designed by city architect Poul Hols√∏e and features a monument created by the sculptor Povl S√∏ndergaard. Another monument commemorates the resistance fighters who died at two incidents on 29 August 1943 and 19 September 1944. It was designed by Povl S√∏ndergaard in 1947. The area also features a group of graves of British soldiers with traditional British headstones and a Cross of Sacrifice. Many of the interred were crew members of British aircraft that were shot down over Zealand. The British casualties was buried at the site upon orders from the German occupying forces but most of them were transferred to Vestre Cemetery in March 1944. Section 10 also features 16 graves of Soviet soldiers who died in Denmark during and immediately after the war. A monument designed by the Russian artist Anatolij Dioma was installed in 1990.

The Compagnie Fraissinet added Northern America (New York NY, Providence RI, Chicago IL, Cleveland OH, Detroit MI and Montreal Quebec) to its routes after a merger with the Compagnie Fran√ßaise de Navigation √† Vapeur Cyprien Fabre & Cie (Fabre Line). The Compagnie Fraissinet operated for close to 150 years through two World Wars, several revolutions, and the colonization and decolonization periods. The Fraissinet family started divesting from shipping activities in the 60s to concentrate on aviation and media. Fraissinet lowered its flag in 1968, the tanker Alfred-Fraissinet being the last ship of the company. Fabre kept on operating until 1979. Origin 1888 advertisement for the company Compagnie Fraissinet was founded in January 1836 in Marseilles by Marc Fraissinet, the son of a Protestant merchant from Languedoc. Fraissinet's first ship was the Marseillais. In 1837, two new ships were built, Rh√¥ne and H√©rault. In 1841, Fraissinet bought the company and extended the line to Nice. Initially supported by the French government, Fraissinet's projet of a line to New York and the Gulf of Mexico eventually aborted. In 1846, Fraissinet appointed his son Adolphe as deputy director of the company; the lines were extended to Spain, Gibraltar and Portugal. The company was renamed Compagnie Marseillaise de Navigation √† Vapeur in 1853. Isabelle, the first screw- propelled vessel of the company, inaugurated the next year the first scheduled line between Algeria andLe Havre (Marseilles-Algiers-Spain-Portugal-Le Havre). The short-lived line was suppressed after the collision of Normandie with a Dutch ship in 1857. In 1860 the company, operating ten vessels, had to face an increased competition on the Italian market. Fraissinet extended his lines to Naples and Levant, increased the capital of the company and purchased six new ships in 1865. The same year, Fraissinet purchased Bazin, the first steamship company founded in Marseilles. One year later, the Fraissinet company had a capital of 9 millions francs and operated 15 steamers. Scheduled lines with Corsica and Leghorn were established in 1868. Asie, heading to India, was the first merchant vessel to sail on the Suez Canal (8 January 1870). In 1870, Fraissinet owned 20 vessels, operating scheduled lines to Bombay, Malta, Port Said, Constantinople, Italy, Corsica and Languedoc. Due to the Franco-Prussian war, the service to India was suppressed, the service to Corsica was postponed and several ships were sold. Pediment of the former company's office in Marseille Fraissinet resurfaced in 1874 as Nouvelle Soci√©t√© Maritime de Navigation √† Vapeur (Compagnie Fraissinet). The company was granted the postal service to Corsica by the French government. In 1878, a line was established between S√®te and Genoa, while the existing Levant lines was extended to Palestine and Odessa. On 18 December 1878, the Byzantin sunk off Gallipoli, causing the death of c. 150 of the 250 passengers of the ship. In 1889, Fraissinet was granted the postal service to West Africa and Congo. The Corsican company Morelli (five ships) was taken over by Fraissinet in 1892. At the end of the 19th century, Fraissinet operated lines to Languedoc, Corsica (postal service), Sardinia, Italy, the French and Italian Rivieras, Constantinople, the Black Sea and the mouth of Danube, Oran, Dakar and Libreville (postal service). On 7 June 1903, Liban collided with L'Insulaire a few miles off the port of Marseilles, causing the death of c. 100. The accident deeply afflicted the town of Marseilles and a violent press campaign broke up against Fraissinet, which lost the postal service to Corsica in 1904. However, Compagnie Fran√ßaise de Navigation et de Construction Navale could not fulfill the contract, which was retroceded to Fraissinet in 1905. The Fraissinet fleet was decreased to ten ships after the First World War. Balkan (August 1918), Suzette-Fraissinet (May 1918), Marc-Fraissinet (October 1917), Esterel (April 1917), Golo (August 1917) and Italia (May 1917) were sunk by German or Austro-Hungarian U-boats. Alfred Fraissinet reorganized the company, favouring the Corsican and Algerian lines. In 1927, the postal contract to Corsica was extended for 20 years; a new series of modern ships was built: Cap-Corse, Ville-d'Ajaccio, Cyrnos, √éle-de-Beaut√©, Pascal-Paoli. Fraissinet and Fabre The marriage of Jean Alfred Fraissinet with Mathilde Cyprien Fabre changed Compagnie Fraissinet's strategy. The Fabre family, originating from La Ciotat, was involved in trade and shipping in the Mediterranean Sea and to the West and East Indies since the 15th century. Cyprien Fabre (1838‚Äì96) founded in 1868 the Soci√©t√© Cyprien Fabre et Cie; he bought a few sailing ships for the service of his trade posts in West Africa. Interested in steam navigation, which was still controversial at the time, Fabre purchased in the next ten years one paddle ship and ten screw-propelled ships. The company developed its African line and tramping, as well as a scheduled line to Algeria via Spain. In 1879, an attempt to open a transatlantic line failed but a scheduled line was opened between Marseilles and Liverpool. In 1881, Fabre founded the Compagnie Fran√ßaise de Navigation √† Vapeur Cyprien Fabre & Cie and was elected unanimously President of the Chamber of Commerce of Marseilles. Using the subsidies granted by the new French law on shipping, he bought 12 ships in four years, mostly from English shipyards. In 1885, the company operated 16 steamships to Middle East, Algeria, Brazil and Argentina (specifically, for the transport of Portuguese and Italian emigrants, 1882‚Äì1905), New York and New Orleans, West Africa (line extended in 1902 to Lagos, Nigeria). Fabre was also involved in the transport of fishers from Saint-Malo to Newfoundland (1887‚Äì1906), of pilgrims to Mecca, and of troops to China and Madagascar. When Fabre died in 1896, the company's fleet represented 10% of the commercial ships regesitered in Marseilles. Internationally, the company was known as the Fabre Line, a 'trademark' that would be painted in white letters on the hull of the liners of the company after the Second World War. In 1914, Fabre owned 11 ships, including eight liners. Sant'Anna, commissioned for the transport of troops, was torpedoed in 1918 near Bizerte (Tunisia) with 2,000 passengers. The company lost another three vessels, Libia, Provincia and Liberia. At the end of the war, Fabre reorganized its fleet. Suppressed in 1914, the Middle East line was re-established in 1921 as the Marseilles ‚Äì Genoa ‚Äì Syria ‚Äì Egypt ‚Äì New York line. Agencies were created in several Mediterranean countries in order to promote leisure cruises. Transatlantic cargo-passenger lines were reorganized via Portugal and Italy, while the African lines were extended to Douala (Cameroon) and Pointe-Noire (Congo). Alliances with the other companies in Marseilles were deemed necessary. Fabre first et up joint agencies with Fraissinet. In 1927, the company took a majority stake in Chargeurs R√©unis. The company was renamed Compagnie G√©n√©rale de Navigation √† Vapeur Cyprien Fabre & Cie in 1933. The result of the Fraissinet Fabre merger Cap des Palmes, , was requisitioned in 1939 and converted into an aviso In 1930, Fraissinet set up an alliance with Fabre and Chargeurs R√©unis for a joint service to western Africa. The lines to the Black Sea, suffering from the Italian competition, was suppressed in 1931 after 50 years of uninterrupted service (including during wartime). In 1931, the Italian government decided a monopoly on the transport of emigrants, which resulted in the suppression of the Fabre line to America. Fabre transferred unused liners to the Messageries Maritimes or reallocated them to the African line. New lines were opened with Fraissinet for the transport of African fruit to France. In 1937, Fraissinet took the control of Fabre, which had abandoned Chargeurs, and set up an alliance with Paquet for a while. This was the only period during which the three big family companies from Marseilles sailed together. When the Second World War broke out, most activity of Fabre was concentrated in Africa, with a rapid postal line, a commercial line resupplying Morocco and Algeria and shipping back their products to France, and fruit lines with specific ships mostly dedicated to the transport of bananas. In 1941, the company was renamed Compagnie de Navigation Cyprien Fabre & Cie. Some ships were lost during the Second World War, whereas the remaining ones had become obsolete. The Second World War caused a great damage to the Compagnie Fraissinet. One of the few ships left by the Germans to the French merchant navy, MS G√©n√©ral-Bonaparte, was sunk off Corsica by a British submarine on 19 May 1943. After World War II Passenger ship G√©n√©ral Mangin, After the war transatlantic lines were re- established, serving New York and the Gulf of Mexico, and, from 1950, Canada and the Great Lakes. In 1954 new transatlantic lines were established from Le Havre, Bordeaux and Brest. In 1955, Fabre completed the merger with Fraissinet by forming the Compagnie de Navigation Fraissinet et Cyprien Fabre, directed by Roland Fraissinet, Cyprien Fabre's grandson. Maintained under the Fabre house flag, the traditional Fabre lines were complemented with lines from the other partners of the new company: a fruit line to West Africa, occasionally to Reunion, Indian and Pacific Ocean; a container line to the US, occasionally to the Great Lakes; a cargo line to the Gulf of Mexico; a line to the Antilles and Guyana (originally a SGTM line); and a line to Morocco (originally a Paquet line). In 1959, they founded Compagnie Ivoirienne de Consignation Maritime and placed two ships under the flag of C√¥te-d'Ivoire. Fraissinet lowered its flag in 1968, the tanker Alfred-Fraissinet being the last ship of the company. Fabre kept on operating until 1979. In 1970, the company owned 16 ships. The company eventually lowered its flag and sold its last cargo ships, MS Joliette and MS Frontenac, in 1979. References External links * The Ship List, www.theshiplist.com * Paul Bois.

He worked for British Intelligence during World War II, in London and Washington DC. He thought about taking this up as a career but decided to return to \\"Sotherbys\\" after the war. He appeared as a \\"castaway\\" on the BBC Radio programme Desert Island Discs on 26 September 1966. He was made a Commander of the Order of the British Empire in 1970, and was made honorary life president of Sotheby's in 1980, when he stood down as chairman. Wilson owned Garden Lodge at Logan Place in London's Kensington district for several years. He died in Paris in 1984, after being in a coma for a week. He was 71. Wilson is mentioned in the Ian Fleming story \\"The Property of a Lady\\", commissioned by Sotheby's for use in their annual journal, The Ivory Hammer, and which was adapted as the auction sequence in the film Octopussy.

It is an active Anglican parish church in the deanery of St Helens, the archdeaconry of Warrington and the diocese of Liverpool. Its benefice is combined with those of three local churches to form the Parr Team Ministry. The church is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade II listed building. History St Peter's replaced an earlier church nearby that was burnt down in 1860. It was designed by J. Medland Taylor, and built in 1864‚Äì65. The church cost ¬£2,600. Architecture =Exterior= The walls of the church are built in a mixture of red and yellow sandstone and industrial waste in the form of copper slag, and the roofs are slated. Its plan consists of a nave, north and south aisles under catslide roofs, a double south transept, a chancel with a canted east end, a south vestry and a north organ loft (both under catslide roofs), and a tower with a broach spire at the southwest corner. The tower has a south entrance with a pointed tympanum containing a quatrefoil and crossed keys. It has corner buttresses, lancet windows, and paired bell openings. At the top are squat pyramidal pinnacles, and a broach spire surmounted by a weathervane. The window at the west end of the church has two lights and contains plate tracery. Along the wall of the south aisle are triple lancets with roundels above. On the north side the windows are either triple lancets, or double lancets with roundels. The transept is in two bays, each containing a triple lancet over which is a rose window. In the chancel are three windows, each of two lights containing plate tracery. =Interior= Inside the church are six- bay arcades on round columns, and the chancel arch is carried on round corbels. The font is circular on a circular base, and the pulpit is also circular. The chancel screen is in timber, and dates from about 1920. In the transept is a wall memorial to Revd Abraham Augustus Nunn, the first incumbent of the church, who died in 1889. The two-manual pipe organ was designed by Henry Willis; the date of its installation is unknown. Appraisal The church was designated as a Grade II listed building on 23 August 1985. This grade is the lowest of the three gradings given to listed buildings and is applied to \\"buildings of national importance and special interest\\". Pollard and Pevsner in the Buildings of England series note that this was an early church design by J. Medland Taylor, and that it is \\"by no means his best\\".

Its caput was at Trematon Castle, Cornwall. In 1166 it comprised 59 knight's fees, thus about 59 separate manors.

It was held for several generations by the de Vautort family, Latinized as de Valletorta, which was once thought to come from Vautorte in Maine,Sanders, p.90, note 8 but has since been shown to originate in Torteval in Normandy. The descent of the barony was as follows:Sanders, p.90-1 *Reginald I de Vautort (died about 1123), the first holder of the barony, was by 1086 a major tenant of Robert, Count of Mortain, with 57 manors centred on the castle and market of Trematon. *Roger I de Vautort (died about 1163), his son and heir, married Emma. *Ralph I de Vautort (died before 1173), his son and heir, who in 1166 according to the Cartae Baronum held 59 knight's fees from the Count of Mortain. *Roger II de Vautort (died 1206), his son and heir. *Reginald II de Vautort (died 1245), his son and heir, married Joan, daughter of Thomas Basset of Headington.An anonymous user claims a daughter Joan (1213 - 1299, who married Alexander Oakston (1211-1276). However, Reginald had no surviving children, which is why his estates went to his brother. *Ralph II de Vautort (died 1257), his brother, married Joan, daughter of Reginald de Dunstanville, Earl of Cornwall . *Reginald III de Vautort (died 1269), his son and heir, died young without children. *Roger III de Vautort (died 1274), his uncle, after disposing of most of the family's holdings and leaving vast debts, died childless. What was left of the estates eventually found its way to the descendants of two daughters of Ralph I de Vautort. A younger son of Reginald I de Vautort was Joel de Vautort, whose descendants held lands in Somerset centred on the manor of Currypool in Spaxton until about 1332. =Earls of Cornwall= *Richard, 1st Earl of Cornwall (1209-1272), second son of King John and Isabella of Angoul√™me, bought the barony in 1270. *Edmund, 2nd Earl of Cornwall (1249-1300), son and heir, died without progeny when the barony escheated to the crown. *Piers Gaveston, 1st Earl of Cornwall (d.1312), was granted the barony in 1309, but following his execution in 1312 it reverted to the crown. *Queen Isabella, wife of King Edward II, granted the barony in 1317, which she retained during her husband's reign. *John of Eltham, Earl of Cornwall (1316-1336), second son of King Edward II and his queen Isabella of France, was granted the barony in 1331, and died without progeny. *Edward, the Black Prince (d.1376), eldest son of King Edward III, was granted the barony in 1337.

During this period, the army doctors on both sides were greatly handicapped as microorganisms weren't well understood and the germ theory of disease and antibiotics were still a few years away. Many soldiers died from infections that modern medicine would now be able to easily treat.  Angel's Glow  Captain Dinwiddie had witnessed the carnage of the Battle of Shiloh and was greatly interested by the increased survival on those wounded soldiers that exhibited \\"Angels Glow\\". Angels Glow was caused by the then unknown bioluminescent bacteria Photorhabdus luminescens. It has been reported that infection by this bacterium of the wounds of soldiers in the Civil War caused the wounds to glow, and that this aided the survival of the soldiers due to the production of antibiotics by P. luminescens. This led to the phenomenon's nickname \\"Angel's Glow.\\"  Effective method despite flawed model  After his observations of the unexplained impact of angels glow, Dinwiddie's erroneous conclusion was that mortification (now called gangrene or necrosis) was caused by \\"dark humors\\" or \\"bad air\\" (miasma theory) that had contacted his surgical instruments, clothing and bedding, and moreover, these dark humors could be eradicated by heat and noise. Based on his flawed idea Dr. Dinwiddie began a daily practice of placing his surgical bedding and instruments into a large pot of boiling pine tea. When the steam (in his mind the 'dark humors' or 'bad air') came to the surface, he would ring a cow bell to frighten them away. Dr. Dinwiddie's infection rates plummeted. While his model of induced bacterial necrosis was flawed, his practice greatly reduced mortality amongst his patients, as boiling the tools and bedsheets served to kill germs, functioning as a basic form of sterilization.

The club is based in the commune of Mulhouse, in eastern France, close to the Swiss and German borders. The women's section also became known in the elite of basketball in the early 1990s. History It was in the 1920s that basketball was born in Mulhouse. At the time, it still plays with berets, free throws are the spoon and the ball is heavy and laced leather! But then, in those years, Mulhouse dominates the French basketball. Foyer alsacien Mulhouse won the national title in 1924, 1925 and 1926, losing the following year but recovered in 1928 to never let go before 1932! In 1935 and in 1937 and 1938, it is the other club of Mulhouse, Mulhousien, who won the title. Basketball is played at the time with 8 players on the field and a great rivalry is born between these two leading Mulhouse clubs. The club was born in 1949 from the merger of the prestigious Foyer alsacien Mulhouse and the \\"Esp√©rance de Mulhouse\\". The new entity will be denominated \\"Mulhouse Basketball Club\\" (MBC). In 1970, became a new merger with \\"GENS Mulhouse\\" which relegated from National 2 to National 4. Then accesses Club in National 3 at the end of his first season, then National 2 (1974) with the title of champion of France National 3. When Carmine Calzonetti arrived as coach in 1976, the club rises to Nationale 1 (1st division) in 1978. During the 1980s, Jean-Luc Monschau became president of the club. Gradually the club, accustomed to the depths of the championship, up the slope and anchors the play-off. In 1989 Mulhouse led by Philip Szanyiel and Jean-Aim√© Toupane (both they came from Monaco), won the Tournoi des As against Pitch Cholet and acquired its shareholding in the European Cup Winners' Cup of the next year. AlsŒø, MBC participated for two consecutive years in the FIBA Koraƒá Cup and reached the semifinals in 1991, where they eliminated by the Italian declining powerhouse Clear Cant√π. This year (1991) saw in Mulhouse the arrival of Joe \\"JellyeBean\\" Bryant, father of the NBA star Kobe Bryant aged 13 to time. At the end of the next season, the club is demoted to National A2 for financial reasons. MBC disappears from the A1 and renamed to FCM Basket (FC Mulhouse Basket). FCM was administratively relegated (due to deficit in 1994) before climbing again all levels of the championship. In three years, the club goes back to three divisions for a return to Pro B in 1997. FCM Basketball connects the good and less good result and fails to climb in Pro A. In 2006‚Äì2007, the club, too inconsistent and lack of wins is relegated to National 1.La municipalit√© derri√®re le FCM Basket, 11 novembre 2007. In November 2007, the club drops the Balance Sheet1. Late 2008, the club was relegated in sporting Nationale 2. But without the necessary financial support, the club obliged to declare bankruptcy. So it restarts in pre-national for 2008/2009 season, a very difficult season, where the club is saved in the last game. For 2009/2010, the club gives new ambitions under the leadership of a new staff. The revival is running under the name of Mulhouse Basket, with the accession in National 3. 2009/2010, Mulhouse Basket project is abandoned, but the adventure continues in National 3 under the name and colors of FCM Basket. 2010/2011, the senior team finished undefeated in the league and rises in National 2.

He was deported to Portuguese Macau in 1614, but six years later returned to Japan. He engaged in missionary work primarily in Oshu with Joam Mattheus Adami, a priest. However, he was captured in Aizu and sent to Edo (now Tokyo) in 1629, and was then martyred at the gallows and the pit (ana-tsurushi) in Edo on 29 September 1633. Biography In August 1586, Yama joined the Society of Jesus and became the cleric of the Church of Yanagawa, which was ruled by the vassals of Don Francisco Otomo Sorin, a Christian feudal lord. There, Yama came to know Adami, who had come to Yanagawa as a priest in 1607. Since the Edo government had proclaimed anti-Christian Edicts in 1612, Yama and Adami were exiled to Macau with many other priests in November 1614.Mizobe (2002) P.1-22Schutter (1975) p.1122 Missionary work in Oshu Yama returned to Japan in 1620 and was reunited with Adami, who had come back to Japan in 1618, to the seminary of Inawashiro near Wakamatsu, the capital of Aizu. They were engaged primarily in the missionary work in Oshu at that time.Schutter (1975) p.915Pag√®s (1869) P.434 The Edo government had proclaimed anti-Christian Edicts again in 1619 and as a result, the oppression of Christians severely increased in Kyushu. Nevertheless, Aizu in Oshu, ruled by Leo Gamo Ujisato, a Christian feudal load, was still at peace. Joam Bautista Porro, a priest, brought a statement of encouragement written by Pope Paul V to Aizu in 1620. However, Saemonsuke Oka, a chamberlain of the Gamou family, became the Lord of Inawashiro Castle in 1622, and asked Tadasato Gamou, a grandson of Ujisato, to commit an apostate. Persecution then began in Aizu.Kroehler (1994) P.44-57 Porro stayed in Aizu and was reported to have been martyred in Yonezawa on 12 January 1629.Tsutsui (2009) P.6-7 This report was sent to Rome through Andr√© Palmeiro, a priest in Macau. But it was believed that it was actually Yama who went to Yonezawa and reported the martyrdom, instead of Porro.Tsutusi (2009) P.88 (in Japanese) Martyrdom in Edo In 1629, Yama was captured in Aizu and confined in the prison of Wakamatsu. More than one month later, he was sent from Wakamatsu to Edo for six days, escorted by strict guards in terrible winter weather. He was sentenced to the stake along with 15 Christians who were previously sent from Wakamatsu to Edo. However, seven officials of the government expressed interest in the declaration of Christianity written by Yama, which was as follows:Pag√®s (1869) P.791 :Recognize the Lord of heaven who has created all things in heaven and on earth. In respect to the truth that has no falsehood and which all of us need, there is nothing written in the Confucian writings and nothing taught by Shaka (Buddha) or the great philosopher of China, Confucius. This country is ignorant of this truth and is enveloped in eternal darkness as though the light of the sun cannot be seen. If you officials make the necessary effort to search for this truth in all of Japan, the new appearance of the sun would immediately be seen and would drive away the terrible darkness.Kroehler (2006) P.47 The execution of Yama was postponed and he instead spent four years in the prison of Edo, but the policy of the government to crack down on Christianity never altered. Meanwhile, Adami had left Aizu for Edo in 1630, and then went to Nagasaki, where he was martyred at the gallows and the pit in October 1633. Yama was martyred in the same manner in Edo, on 29 September 1633, at the age of 66.Pag√®s reported that Yama died at the age of 63 (√† soixante-trois ans in French),[10] but Kroehler et al reported that he was 66 years old,[11] which was supported by Schutter‚Äôs records.[1] See also *Catholic Church in Japan Notes References * Schutter, Josef Franz S.

He is currently head coach of the women's basketball team at the University of Arkansas. He moved to Arkansas, his alma mater, in 2017, after four years as head coach at the University of Washington. Early years Neighbors was born and raised in Greenwood, Arkansas, where he played basketball at Greenwood High School. His family was very involved in the school system, as teachers, school secretaries, assistant superintendent and superintendent positions. Neighbors completed his associate degree at Westark Community College (now the University of Arkansas ‚Äì Fort Smith) in 1989 and bachelor's degree at the University of Arkansas in 1993. Coaching career In 1994, Neighbors became head girls' basketball coach at Bentonville High School in Bentonville, Arkansas. The team improved from a 1‚Äì24 record in his first season to winning at least 18 games each of the next three seasons and reached the state finals in 1997. Neighbors then took the same job at Cabot High School in Cabot, Arkansas in 1998 and taught biology at the school also. During his year at Cabot, he was playing some pickup basketball. He had bet a high school player he could dunk. He won and played five pickup games that morning. After going home, he was resting on his couch when he experienced a heart attack. Doctors placed two stents in his chest to help with the blood flow, and he was back to coaching the following Friday. However, he decided he had to change his life and he resigned the head coaching position to take an administrative job at the University of Arkansas. The change resulted in a substantial pay cut. =College assistant= From 1999 to 2001, Neighbors was director of operations for Arkansas Razorbacks women's basketball. Neighbors explains his philosophy: \\"...be the head coach of whatever they ask you to do.\\" He quickly moved upward to additional responsibilities. Coach Gary Blair asked him to help out with camps, then with viewing opponents' videos to write scouting reports. After two years as director of basketball operations at Arkansas, Neighbors became an assistant coach at Tulsa under Kathy McConnell- Miller. While an assistant at Tulsa, the school had their best record in school history (19‚Äì12) and their first ever post-season invitation. When McConnell-Miller left to take over the Colorado program, Neighbors continued as her assistant at Colorado. After one year at Colorado, Susie Gardner persuaded Neighbors to return to Arkansas, this time as a full assistant. The return home did not last long, as Gardner and Arkansas parted ways at the end of the season. Arkansas replaced Gardner with Tom Collen, who chose to bring in his own staff as assistants. Neighbors was hired by Xavier head coach Kevin McGuff in time for the 2007-08 season. He continued as McGuff's assistant through the 2010‚Äì11 season, during which time the Musketeers were 108‚Äì22, winning the A10 Conference Tournament three of the four years, making the NCAA tournament each year, and advancing to the Elite Eight in 2010, losing to national runner-up Stanford by just two points. While at Xavier, Neighbors was selected as one of the best assistant coaches in the country. He was chosen as one of five recipients for the BasketballScoop.com and ONS Performance Rising Star award. McGuff was hired by the Washington Huskies for the 2011-2012 season, bringing Neighbors along with him. In their first season under McGuff, the Huskies turned around their 11‚Äì17 record from the previous season, improving to 20‚Äì14 and making it to the quarterfinals of the WNIT. The next year, the team improved again, finishing 21‚Äì12, and finishing 5th in the Pac-12 Conference, their best finish since 2007. However, at the end of McGuff's second season, Ohio State decided to move on from Jim Foster, and persuaded McGuff to take over the head coaching position for the Buckeyes. McGuff, who had signed a three-year contract extension just three weeks earlier, was persuaded to return to his home state. =Washington head coach= On April 21, 2013, Washington hired Neighbors to be its women's basketball head coach. In his first year, Washington finished 20-14 (10-8 Pac-12). Among the team's wins was a nationally televised upset of then-No. 3 Stanford at Alaska Airlines Arena that snapped Stanford's 58-game road conference winning streak. Washington earned its first top-25 ranking since 2003 in Neighbors's second season in 2014‚Äì15 and made the NCAA Tournament as a #6 seed. In the first round, Washington lost to #11 seed University of Miami. In the 2015‚Äì16 postseason, the Huskies were picked as an at-large bid as a #7 seed in the 2016 NCAA Tournament in the Lexington region. After beating #10 seed Penn 65-53, the Huskies upset #2 Maryland on their homecourt 74-65 to advance to the Sweet 16 for the first time since 2001. The Huskies played against #3 Kentucky on their homecourt to defeat the Wildcats 85-72 to advance to the Elite 8. The Huskies played against their Pac-12 opponent Stanford in the Elite Eight, where the Huskies and Cardinal split the season series. The Huskies led throughout the game and they defeated the Cardinal 85-76 to advance to their first ever Final Four. =Arkansas head coach= On April 3, 2017, Neighbors was announced as the ninth coach in program history at his alma mater, where he once served as director of basketball operations and as an assistant. His contract is for six years and he will make $600,000 per year. https://www.usnews.com/news/best-states/arkansas/articles/2017-04-03/ap- source-mike-neighbors-hired-as-arkansas-womens-coach His first season was filled with ups and downs, as the team finished 13-18 overall and next to last in the conference. They won their opening round SEC Tournament game over Vanderbilt, before succumbing to former Arkansas coach Gary Blair and his Texas A&M; team, 82-52. In his second season at Arkansas, Neighbor's Lady Razorbacks doubled their SEC wins from the previous year to 6. Neighbors coached his team into the SEC Women's Tournament championship game versus #5 Mississippi State, defeating Georgia, #12 South Carolina, and #15 Texas A&M; on consecutive days. But the Lady Razorbacks lost to Mississippi St. Arkansas accepted a bid to the 2019 Women's National Invitation Tournament (WNIT), beating Houston and UAB in the first two rounds at Bud Walton Arena in Fayetteville. Neighbors team lost at home to TCU, 82-78, in the third round, ending their season. Neighbors enters his fourth season coming off arguably the best season for the Hogs ever in the Southeastern Conference, as his 2019-20 Hogs became one of just two teams to ever win 10 games in the league, while his most recent squad was one of just three Razorback teams in the SEC era to finish above .500 in the league. With their 10-6 record in 2020, the Hogs finished tied for third place in the conference, the best-ever conference finish for Arkansas Women‚Äôs Basketball. If not for the shortened season, Neighbors would have guided his Hogs back to the NCAA Tournament for the first time since 2015.

This is a challenge in the era of nanometer semiconductor nodes, where transistor scaling and voltage scaling are no longer in line with each other, resulting in the failure of Dennard scaling. This discontinuation of Dennard scaling has led to sharp increases in power densities that hamper powering-on all the transistors simultaneously at the nominal voltage, while keeping the chip temperature in the safe operating range.

The forum's official opening was held in the capital Ngerulmud, in Melekeok State, but the majority of events were held in Koror, Palau's largest city and former capital.Calendar of Events ‚Äì Palau PIF. Retrieved 21 January 2015. The official theme of the meeting was \\"The Ocean: Life & Future\\". Topics under discussion include climate change, commercial fishing, non-communicable diseases and the possibility of readmitting Fiji to the forum.  Overview  The Pacific Islands Forum is an inter-governmental organization that aims to enhance cooperation between the independent countries of the Pacific Ocean. It was founded in 1971 as the South Pacific Forum. In 1999, the name was changed; Pacific Islands Forum is more inclusive of the Forum's Oceania-spanning membership of both north and south Pacific island countries and Australia. It is an official observer at the United Nations. The mission of Pacific Islands Forum is ‚Äúto work in support of Forum member governments, to enhance the economic and social well-being of the people of the South Pacific by fostering cooperation between governments and between international agencies, and by representing the interests of Forum members in ways agreed by the Forum‚Äù. Its decisions are implemented by the Pacific Islands Forum Secretariat (PIFS), which grew out of the South Pacific Bureau for Economic Co-operation (SPEC). As well as its role in harmonising regional positions on various political and policy issues, the Forum Secretariat has technical programmes in economic development, transport and trade. The Pacific Islands Forum Secretary General is the permanent Chairman of the Council of Regional Organisations in the Pacific (CROP).  Issues  President of Palau Tommy Remengesau declared the official theme of the Forum would be \\"The Ocean: Life & Future\\", with the major focus on the issue of climate change amidst concern over rising sea levels and sinking islands in the Pacific Ocean. He stated that the solution to the problem of rising seas as well as ocean warming and acidification is the reduction of CO2 emissions. Pacific islands leaders plan to produce a follow-up to the Majuro Declaration, which was passed at the 44th Pacific Islands Forum with the support of United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki- moon. Secretary General of the Pacific Islands Forum Secretariat Tuiloma Neroni Slade commended Remengesau for the choice of theme, noting \\"it is a theme that is most timely with considerable strategic significance in the lead up to the 3rd UN conference on Small Islands Developing States (SIDS) to be held in Samoa, in September.\\" Other topics on the agenda for the Forum include commercial fishing and non-communicable diseases. Earlier this year, President Remengesau proposed a ban on commercial fishing in Palau. Bans and other ways to promote marine conservation will be discussed at the Forum. Leaders are upset that despite the lucrative nature of the Pacific tuna fishing industry, worth approximately four billion US dollars per year, it is poorly managed and little of the money trickles back to Pacific countries. Prevalence of smoking and obesity are widespread in the Pacific, and leaders in Palau want to discuss ways to reduce these problems at the Forum. To model good practices, smoking has been banned during the course of the event, and dietary guidelines have been put in place for food served at all meetings during the event. The readmission of Fiji to the Pacific Islands Forum was also discussed at the Forum. Fiji was banned in 2009 after the military government that took power in the 2006 Fijian coup d'√©tat promised elections in 2009 but failed to hold them. However, readmission is unlikely to occur before the Fijian election in September. Prime Minister of New Zealand John Key said he would discuss allowing Fiji to return to the Forum, but Foreign Minister of Fiji Ratu Inoke Kubuabola previously stated that Fiji would not consider reapplying unless Australia and New Zealand were banned from the forum.  Representatives  In addition to representatives from each of the 15 participating countries, representatives of major powers such as the United States, China, India, and the European Union also attended the forum. Former White House Chief of Staff and current Counselor to the President John Podesta led the US delegation at the forum, a group including senior officials from the National Security Council, United States Pacific Command, United States Coast Guard, United States Department of State, United States Department of the Interior, Peace Corps, United States Agency for International Development, and Hawaii. The delegation of the European Union was led by High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy for the EU and Vice-President of the European Commission Catherine Ashton. Ashton will speak at a plenary session on 30 July and host a dinner that same evening. Her goals are to discuss issues of mutual interest such as climate change and increase strategic relations between the EU and Pacific islands. The EU has already agreed to provide over 750 million Euros for bilateral and regional cooperation. Prime Minister of Australia Tony Abbott and Prime Minister of New Zealand John Key, heads of government of the two largest participating countries in the Forum, were both unable to attend. Tony Abbott was occupied with matters concerning the crash of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17. The Australian delegation was led by Deputy Prime Minister of Australia Warren Truss and Parliamentary Secretary Brett Mason. The New Zealand delegation was led by Foreign Minister Murray McCully, who promised a $5 million programme to update navigation maps for the region, and to help protect Pacific fisheries. The Green Party of Aotearoa New Zealand condemned Key for not attending the forum, and accused both leaders of not caring deeply enough about the effects of climate change.

This world-class cluster presents a critical mass of 1,000 companies, research centers and innovation support structures, representing today more than 25,000 employees. The Health Valley strives to animate the life sciences ecosystem of the region, by establishing thriving bridges between its ambassadors. The name of the Health Valley is inspired by that of Silicon Valley in California, United States (where the focus is on information technology). According to Swiss newspaper Le Temps, there were close to 1,000 biotech and medtech companies in the Health Valley in 2017, employing 25,000 people. The Health Valley network is led by the swiss charity Inartis Foundation, which president, Prof. Beno√Æt Dubuis is actively engaged in the development of the life sciences in the region. He has created and continue to actively promote the Health Valley concept through BioAlps (President 2008-2018), Eclosion (Founder) and Campus Biotech (Managing director since 2013). The Health Valley is today supported by 70 ambassadors which intends to foster synergies in order to create value for the region.

According to Swiss journalist, the idea of a Health Valley was actively supported by Patrick Aebischer during his tenure as president of the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Lausanne/EPFL (2000-2016). Notably, Aebischer promoted teaching and research in the life sciences while deepening cooperation with Lausanne University Hospital/CHUV. Biotech expert J√ºrg Z√ºrcher argues that Switzerland as a whole constitutes a cluster, with the Basel BioValley employing 50,000 people and the Zurich region employing 21,000. \\"Together, these three regions form the densest network of biotech firms anywhere in the world\\", Swiss Info notes, with over 40% of the world's pharmaceutical companies in the Basel region alone.

Both textiles and coca are very important to the people in Andean South America. These chuspas are a vital piece of culture and are especially important to combat the bitter cold in the mountainous zones of the Andes. These bags are also a way to showcase the cloth which in itself is a primary artistic medium. Highland textiles are traditionally woven from the hair of native camelids, usually the domesticated alpacas and llamas, and more rarely, wild vicu√±a and guanaco. These pouches are important symbols of social identity. As part of this tradition, chuspas show to the rest of their people how skilled they are in weaving. They can express their artistic skills and display their cultural affiliation by creating these chuspas. History Since the beginning of the first millennium AD, chuspas have been a constant presence in Andean society. Chuspas have endured changing fashions and technologies throughout the years, just like other pieces of fashion. Furthermore, as with other textiles in Andean South America, stylistic differences between chuspas distinguish them as products of particular regions and communities. However, chuspas are unique among Andean textiles because of the substance they hold, coca leaves. Long before the Spanish arrived in Peru, Andean artists portrayed people wearing chuspas, especially on pottery vessels. Between AD1 and 700, the Moche dominated the north coast of Peru, and during that time Moche ceramic artists produced lifelike representations of people, plants, and animals in molded ceramic vessels. Many of these representations depicted people carrying chuspas. Depictions of chuspas in media have been around since pre-Hispanic times. Chuspas are particularly notable in the seventeenth century line drawings that accompany Felipe Guaman Poma de Ayala's length description of Inca customs. Guaman Poma includes chuspas in an extensive variety of contexts, as two individuals share coca during horticulture, in ritual settings, at funerals, in festivals, and in parades. Written descriptions of Andean chuspas or huallqepos as they are called in Aymara, another widely spoken Andean language, are also remarkably consistent from the Spanish conquest to present. In 1609 Bernabe Cobo wrote that underneath his mantle and over his tunic a man would carry 'a small chuspa which hangs around the neck. It is more or less one span in length and about the same width. This bag hangs down by the waist under the right arm, and the strap from which it hangs passes over the left shoulder.\\" There have been many visual and written representations of chuspas throughout the centuries which demonstrate the ubiquity of chuspas and suggest that coca bags are relatively straight forward and conservative items, but in fact variations are evident in the actual objects that have survived. Surviving chuspas reveal a great deal about the technological and artistic styles evident in the Andes at different periods. Crafting Chuspas Chuspas are created using similar tools and techniques involved in making larger items, such as shawls and ponchos. Although the technologies are relatively simple, creating a chuspas can take more than a week, and for a much smaller object. The crafting process incorporates three basic stages: spinning, weaving, and embellishing. Using a hand spindle, a weaver spins cotton, camelid fiber, or sheep's wool into a thread and then twists or piles two or more spun threads together to strengthen the yarn. When she has spun and piled enough yarn, the weaver turns to her loom. Horizontal ground looms are particularly common in the southern Andes, where most of the chuspas are made. Once the weaver has wraped the loom by continuously wrapping a length of yarn in a figure-eight around the bars at each end of the loom, she can begin to interlace the weft threads into the warp to create a structure. Although plain weave is the simplest and most common, weavers use a range of more complex weaving techniques in order to achieve the elaborate designs seen in chuspas and other Andean cloth. Regardless of the technique used, after the weaver is finished, she removes the loom pieces and is left with a four-selvage length of cloth, which is folded in half and stitched along the sides to create the basic bag shape of a shuspa. Although simple stitching is seen in some coca bags, weavers often create a tubular edging to ensure that the sides are more securely held together. This is achieved by extracting either a cross-knit loop stitch or hand-woven edge bindings. When the body of the bag is complete, the weaver adds straps. To finish, the weaver sews on tassels, fringes, eads, and other decorations according to local custom.

Life and Works Henrique Bernardelli was born in Valparaiso, Chile. He was the brother of sculptor Rodolfo and painter and violinist F√©lix. In 1865 he moved with his family to Rio Grande do Sul when his parents (a violinist and a dancer), were contracted by the emperor Pedro II to be tutors to the imperial princesses. In 1867 they moved to Rio de Janeiro. In 1870 he enrolled in the Academia Imperial de Belas Artes (AIBA) in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, studying with painters of outstanding importance such as Victor Meirelles and Agostinho Jos√© da Mota. In 1878 he took Brazilian nationality to be eligible for AIBA's European travel award. He lost the award to Rodolfo Amoedo but travelled to Rome in 1879 using his own resources. There he encountered the work of such artists as Francesco Paolo Michetti e Giovanni Segantini. Back in Rio de Janeiro in 1888 he participated in a number of exhibitions: In 1889 at the Paris Universal Exhibition, where he won a bronze medal with the painting Os Bandeirantes; in 1890 at the General Exhibition of Fine Arts, where he showed the works Dicteriade, Tarantella and Calle de Venezia; and in 1893 at the Chicago Universal Exhibition with Messalina, Mater and Proclama√ß√£o da Rep√∫blica. In 1891 he became a teacher of painting of the recently inaugurated Escola Nacional de Belas Artes. He kept contact with the Italian figurative culture, constantly travelling to cities such as Rome, Naples and Venice. He taught at the school until replaced by Eliseu Visconti in 1906 when he began to give private lessons in his studio, at the same time receiving private commissions. His performance as a decorator deserves attention, having worked on the Municipal Theatre in Rio de Janeiro, the National Library and the National Museum of Fine Arts. In 1916 he won one of the highest awards that an artist can aspire to in Brazil: the Medal of Honour. He was also a member of the Superior Council of Fine Arts to which he rendered important services. A large part of the work of Henrique Bernardelli was donated to the state¬¥s art collection. There is a bust of him with his brother Rodolfo in Pra√ßa do Lido, Copacabana, by the sculptor Le√£o Veloso.

He is a completely passioned by nautical sportsman. Taken aboard a boat by his parents only 15 days after he was born, he was never able nor wanted to let go of the sea again. Francisco Lufinha Francisco 1 year old Piece of news At age eleven, he started to compete in the dinghy class Optimist where he won several regional and national races and ended representing his country at the ‚Äô98 Europeans in Split, Croatia. At age 15 he upgraded to the 420 (dinghy) (boats of two persons) where he raced until he was eighteen and won the national overall ranking. While developing his sailing skills, he was always looking for the most recent extreme sport to try to learn how to do it. Water skiing and wakeboarding were his first choices, then windsurfing and the latest, in 2002, was kitesurfing. Hydrofoil wakeboarding Francisco found in kitesurfing the most complete sport he has ever tried, because it is a mix of his favorite sports. In 2005 he was national champion and in 2006 vice- champion.  Studies and career  In parallel with his sportive life, Francisco graduated from a master's degree in engineering and industrial management at Instituto Superior T√©cnico in 2007, which lead to jobs as auditing at Deloitte, strategy marketing analyst at BES bank, co-manager of the Portuguese offshore sailor ‚Äôs project, CTO at ConsultaClick.com (co- founder), general manager at Dakhla Attitude resort in Morocco, private yacht skipper and manager and in 2014 was co-founder of +Mar (Portuguese association for promoting the nautical tourism and sports) in which he is President, nautical events organizer and speaker at conferences and company private events.  Extreme challenges  = MINI Kitesurf Odyssey 2013 = This challenge consisted of kitesurfing from the city of Porto to Lagos, Portugal, covering more than 500 km of the Portuguese coast non-stop. This had never been done before and was an idea that Francisco had in his mind for some years, after sailing the Portuguese coast several times in his family boat or with his sailing expert friend Francisco Lobato. In 2013 he dedicated his time and effort to make this adventure happen and he understood that it could be possible to do it kitesurfing without stops, with a good wind forecast for the entire course. Francisco trained for this highly demanding challenge that has taken his limits to an extreme test, both physical and mentally. He made it till the end and kitesurfed 564 km in 28 hours and 53 minutes, always on the board, setting a new world record for longest distance kiteboarding without stops.

On August 19, Loudwire premiered the video for the album's first single \\"Mask Machine\\". Soon after, Classic Rock premiered the song for Europe. On September 22, the entire album began streaming on the Prog magazine website.  Recording and concept  Before the album release, drummer Mike Portnoy said it would benefit from a bigger \\"chemistry\\" between members: The band's experience with Peter Collins was overwhelmingly positive. For Second Nature, the band decided not to work with a producer because they wanted to experiment with working on their own. According to Portnoy, the album was recorded in a Led Zeppelin-ish way, with the members meeting for a couple of days, then carrying on with their other commitments, then going back to record more parts, and so on. The first writing session happened via Skype conversations. Bassist Dave LaRue said about the writing sessions: \\"Everyone brings in ideas, no complete songs. When we like an idea, we start from there and build on it. There are some ideas that get thrown out, others that get completely changed, some that stay pretty much intact. We do try a lot of different ideas within one song. The writing sessions are pretty intense ‚Äì we move fast, due to the limited amount of time we have\\".Interview with Dave LaRue, by Grande-Rock.com retrieved on November 13, 2014. Guitarist Steve Morse said he encourages his bandmates to bring just ideas for songs, instead of complete tracks, \\"so that the band sound is on everything\\". Also, he said the band decided not to \\"underestimate\\" their audience and assume they \\"can handle lots of subtlety, complexity and changes of tempo.\\" All instruments were recorded in each member's personal studio, except for the vocals, which were mostly recorded at keyboardist/vocalist Neal Morse's studio. The cover for Flying Colors was designed by executive producer Bill Evans. For Second Nature, Portnoy and Evans asked artist Hugh Syme to come up with something with the theme of \\"Second Nature\\". Steve Morse described the concept of the cover as follows:  Song themes  The opening track \\"Open Up Your Eyes\\" was the first song to be written for the album. McPherson commented that the song is a reflection about life, and how one may not be happy even when have reasons to be. \\"Mask Machine\\" was the first single from the album and received a video. McPherson stated that the song is his favorite and that he personally believes the chorus talks about \\"the record, in terms of our need to get away from consumerism and telling our boy to cover up who we really are\\". \\"Bombs Away\\" is about getting involved in business everyday and losing sight of the beauty of life due to being busy. \\"The Fury of My Love\\" was primarily written by Neal, who submitted a demo of the chorus for his bandmates. McPherson was initially afraid that the song could be mistaken as a song about domestic violence, and he describes it as actually covering simply the topic of the passion one feels for another. \\"A Place in Your World\\" received a video, which was premiered at Billboard's website on 10 October 2014. The video consists of the band performing the song altogether in a studio, which Portnoy described as the band's \\"most natural and comfortable environment\\". He also said that the song is a good example of the Flying Colors sound: \\"catchy vocal hooks with clever, tasty musicianship sprinkled on top. It's also a great example of the Flying Colors vocal blend as it features lead vocal turns from all three vocalists (myself, Neal, and Casey) and a chorus that features a three-part harmony with all of us.\\" According to McPherson, the song sees the album once again with existential, reflexive lyrics. According to McPherson, the original chorus of \\"Lost Without You\\" may have been \\"Cause I'm home\\" instead of the \\"Cause I'm Lost\\" that was actually recorded. He also said the song speaks to the loved ones that he lost in his life. The Celtic and \\"almost middle eastern/Indian approach\\" of \\"One Love Forever\\" made McPherson realize \\"how these tribes around the world have musical similarities that I hadn't really thought about until we did that verse.\\" Steve says he used a style of playing that resembled European folk music. McPherson describes \\"Peaceful Harbor\\" as \\"the journey of a man to finding a place where we'll find contentment. It's kind of a mix of what it's like to be a man and how we naturally take our journey.\\" Steve adds that it is \\"about the joy of finding that peace inside after going through a storm or catastrophe\\". The initial version of the song didn't contain any choir at the outro, but Neal found out about a choir in Nashville and decided to hire them to complete the ending. The vocal melody of the song is reminiscent of their previous tour; it was something McPherson would sing during sound checks and that the band wanted to include in their next album. \\"Cosmic Symphony\\" was written by McPherson towards \\"the person getting free of the trap of consumerism and how that relates to identity, [...] that person becoming comfortable on his own shoes.\\" He also described the end of the song as a \\"I'm ok with who I am and I don't need anything else, I don't need to fill myself with things to purchase or to become, in order to describe who I am.\\"  Reception  Track listing Personnel ;Flying Colors * Casey McPherson ‚Äì lead vocals, rhythm guitar * Neal Morse ‚Äì keyboards, backing vocals, co-lead vocals (1, 5, 7, 8, 9) * Mike Portnoy ‚Äì drums, percussion, co-lead vocals on \\"A Place In Your World\\" * Steve Morse ‚Äì lead and rhythm guitar * Dave LaRue ‚Äì bass guitar ;Additional Personnel * The McCrary Sisters ‚Äì background vocals on \\"Peaceful Harbor\\" and \\"Cosmic Symphony\\" * Chris Carmichael ‚Äì strings on \\"The Fury of My Love\\" and \\"Peaceful Harbor\\" * Shane Borth ‚Äì strings on \\"Bombs Away\\" * Eric Darken ‚Äì hand drums on \\"One Love Forever\\" ;Production * Bill Evans ‚Äì executive producer * Flying Colors ‚Äì producers * Rich Mouser ‚Äì mixing * Jerry Guidroz, Bill Evans and Flying Colors ‚Äì engineers * Paul Logus ‚Äì mastering * Hugh Syme ‚Äì art direction, design, illustrations * Jim Arbogast ‚Äì photography References Category:Flying Colors (band) albums Category:2014 albums ","title":"Second Nature (Flying Colors album)"},{"id":"43423855","text":"Joseph Polidano (born 8 June 1940) is a former Maltese cyclist.

The bill was introduced into the United States House of Representatives during the 113th United States Congress. Background The Muscular Dystrophy Community Assistance Research and Education Amendments of 2001 (\\"MD CARE Act\\", ) amended the Public Health Service Act to provide for research with respect to various forms of muscular dystrophy, including Duchenne, Becker, limb girdle, congenital, facioscapulohumeral, myotonic, oculopharyngeal, distal, and Emery‚ÄìDreifuss muscular dystrophies.H.R. 717--107th Congress (2001): MD-CARE Act, GovTrack.us (database of federal legislation), (accessed July 29, 2007)Public Law 107-84, PDF as retrieved from NIH website According to the Muscular Dystrophy Association, \\"since 2001, there have been 67 clinical trials of drugs or therapies for muscular dystrophy, and currently 37 clinical trials are under way.\\" Provisions of the bill This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the Congressional Research Service, a public domain source. The Paul D. Wellstone Muscular Dystrophy Community Assistance, Research and Education Amendments of 2013 would amend the Public Health Service Act to revise the muscular dystrophy research program of the National Institutes of Health (NIH). The bill would expand the range of forms of muscular dystrophy included within the program. Requires the research conducted through Paul D. Wellstone Muscular Dystrophy Cooperative Research Centers to include cardiac and pulmonary function research. Requires the Director of NIH to ensure the sharing of data between such centers. The bill would revise the composition of the Muscular Dystrophy Coordinating Committee (MDCC) to include the Social Security Administration and the United States Administration for Community Living. The bill would require the MDCC to meet at least two times per year. Requires the MDCC Action Plan to provide for: (1) health economic studies to demonstrate the cost-effectiveness of providing independent living resources and support to patients with various forms of muscular dystrophy, (2) studies to determine optimal clinical care interventions for adults with various forms of muscular dystrophy, and (3) the development of clinical interventions to improve the health of adults with various forms of muscular dystrophy. The bill would require the MDCC to develop a plan to expedite the evaluation and approval of emerging therapies and personalized medicines that have the potential to decrease fatal disease progression across the various forms of muscular dystrophy. The bill would require the United States Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS), in carrying out epidemiological activities regarding Duchenne and other forms of muscular dystrophies, to ensure that data from different racial and ethnic populations is captured and made publicly available to investigators conducting public or private research on muscular dystrophy. Directs the Secretary to foster ongoing engagement and collaboration between the surveillance program and the research centers. The bill would amend the Muscular Dystrophy Community Assistance, Research, and Education Amendments of 2001 to authorize the Secretary to: (1) update and disseminate widely existing Duchenne-Becker muscular dystrophy care considerations for pediatric patients, and (2) develop and disseminate widely Duchenne-Becker muscular dystrophy considerations for adult patients and acute care considerations for all muscular dystrophy populations. Directs that such care considerations should build upon existing efforts currently underway for specified forms of muscular dystrophy and incorporate strategies specifically responding to the findings of the national transitions survey of minority, young adult, and adult communities of muscular dystrophy patients. Congressional Budget Office report This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the Congressional Budget Office, as ordered reported by the House Committee on Energy and Commerce on July 15, 2014. This is a public domain source. H.R. 594 would amend the Public Health Service Act to reauthorize surveillance, research, and education activities relating to muscular dystrophy. The bill would expand the portfolios of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to include additional forms of muscular dystrophy. It also would direct CDC to capture more representative data regarding muscular dystrophy across populations. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates that implementing H.R. 594 would cost $323 million over the 2015-2019 period, assuming appropriation of the necessary amounts. Pay-as-you-go procedures do not apply to this legislation because it would not affect direct spending or revenues. H.R. 594 contains no intergovernmental and private-sector mandates as defined in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act. Procedural history The Paul D.

She first practiced at her local club in Abano Terme. When it closed, she joined Petrarca Scherma in Padova. She won the gold medal both in the individual and the team event at the 2007 Mediterranean Fencing Championships in Syracuse, Sicily and at the 2008 Junior European Championships in Amsterdam. She joined the national sabre team in the 2012‚Äì13 season. She took part in the 2013 European Championships in the team event only. Italy defeated France, but fell against Russia in the semi-finals and fenced Poland in the small final. They prevailed 45‚Äì44 despite Poland's being in the lead for most of the match, and came away with a bronze medal. In the 2013‚Äì14 season Sinigaglia reached her best individual result as of 2014 with a quarter-final in the Antalya World Cup. In the European Championships in Strasbourg, she was defeated in the table of 32 by World No.1 Olha Kharlan. In the team event, Italy were defeated in their first match by France and finished sixth. In the World Championships in Kazan, Sinigaglia created an upset in the table of 64 by eliminating reigning Olympic champion Kim Ji-yeon, but yielded to Japan's Mika Kikuchi in the next round.

Palk had intended to build a mansion at TorwoodSee 1863 painting by John Wallace Tucker Torwood Manor, collection of Torre Abbey Historic House and Gallery in his manor of Tor Mohun, which he had purchased from Lord Donegal in about 1759, but where he had been unable to purchase various surrounding fields which interfered with the estate.Swete, Vol.1, p.165 The Torwood estate was later developed by his successors into half of the resort of Torquay. Major-General Stringer Lawrence (1697‚Äì1775), the first Commander-in-Chief of the British Army in India, spent his retirement at Haldon House as an honoured guest of his friend from Indian days Sir Robert Palk, to whom he bequeathed the huge sum of ¬£50,000 and in whose memory in 1788 Palk erected the \\"Lawrence Tower\\" (alias \\"Haldon Belvedere\\") on his estate. In 1789 Haldon House was viewed by Rev. John Swete (died 1821) of nearby Oxton House, a connoisseur of the picturesque, and a former proteg√© of Palk's, who in his journal criticised its design in having two wings which swept forward in curves, which although effective in built-up London for Buckingham House, here resulted in much of the spectacular view of the surrounding countryside being blocked off from the front of the house.Gray & Rowe, Vol.1, p.8 Palk removed the formal gardens and replaced them with lawns and clumps of trees in the then fashionable style. The house was visited by several notable people, including King George III (1760‚Äì1820), whom Sir Robert Palk escorted to view the Lawrence Tower along a specially made carriage drive.

(Historical Manuscripts Commission ; no. 74,1922) A single buyer was not forthcoming and the estate was split up and sold piecemeal.Winckworth, Archibald N. (1917‚Äì1997), (owner of Dunchideock House) Memories of Dunchideock At the time of its demolition in 1925 the house had six reception rooms (sizes 30 by 20 feet, 22 by 30, 50 by 17¬Ω, 28¬Ω by 18¬Ω, 22 by 22¬Ω and one other), 38 bedrooms, a ballroom, theatre and chapel to seat 100. No buyer could be found and with the gardens and a 5-acre field it was withdrawn at ¬£1,350. The final sale of the last of the estate was in 1925. The furnishings of the chapel were purchased by Clifton College for its own chapel.Winckworth Haldon Belvedere About a mile south-west of the house and visible from afar is the triangular 26-metre-high Haldon Belvedere, built in 1788 by Sir Robert Palk, 1st Baronet. It was originally called \\"Lawrence Tower\\" in honour of his friend and patron General Stringer Lawrence (1697‚Äì1775), who spent much of his retirement at Haldon.Cherry & Pevsner, p.342 References Sources *Cherry, Bridget & Pevsner, Nikolaus, The Buildings of England: Devon.

They were built by Muslims when they occupied the Iberian Peninsula between the 8th and the 15th centuries, especially from the 12th century during the Almohad dynasty and mainly in the south of Spain and Portugal where the Islamic influence was the longest. In Spanish, they are called torre albarrana. The towers of typical appearance, with a square section, were built several meters in front of the curtain wall. They were accessible by a bridge walkway from the curtain wall. More often, the bridge had a removable wooden section allowing the tower to be isolated from the wall if the tower is occupied by attacking forces. The earliest Albarrana towers were often pentagonal or octagonal in plan (e.g. Badajoz, Tarifa, Seville) but a more rectangular plan became the norm. In France and the north of Europe, flanking towers remained a part of the wall. Even the keep was sometimes built as a part of the wall instead of inside the yard at the center of the castle. They were philippian towers. The main albarrana towers are : * Torre de Espantaperros in Badajoz, Spain. Probably the first albarrana tower, built by Abu Yaqub Yusuf in 1170. Its plan is octagonal. * Torre del Oro, Torre de la Plata in Sevilla * Torre de la Malmuerta in Cordoba * Town of Talavera de la Reina near Toledo with several albarrana towers * √ídena castle near Barcelona * Castle of Paderne in Portugal * 2 albarrana towers in the Santa Catalina castle in Ja√©n * Castle of Loul√© in Portugal Albarrana towers are almost uniquely confined in the Iberian Peninsula. In the other parts of the medieval Muslim world this defensive feature seems not to be used. However, a notable example can be found in the Citadel of Aleppo, in Syria. Aleppo Citadel Restoration: https://archnet.org/sites/6414/media_contents/76471 Model of Pontefract Castle, Yorkshire Possibly the only example of a true Albarrana tower in England can be found at Pontefract Castle. The castle now lies in ruins, but one Albarrana tower called Swillington Tower is visible on the models of the castle and the remains of the tower itself can be seen to the north of the castle.

It was then that they decided to create Revolve, a company that strips the vanity and indulgence from theatre and focus on the art.http://www.miromagazine.co.uk/#!dame-judi-dench-named-patron-for- revolve/c1dof The aim of Revolve is to offer something educational and inspiring and to the theatre scene of Oxfordshire and Berkshire. Education Revolve believe in the educative and political powers of theatre, especially through Shakespearean language.Shakespeare Besides delivering performances completely unique to Revolve, the company strive to take their rendition of Hamlet to schools, to teach young minds about the beauty of Shakespearean language from an idiosyncratic perspective. Debut Performance The first performance by Revolve was a One-Man adaptation of Hamlet, in which Artistic Director, Oliver Dench, performed a total of 15 roles. The play was written using Bard's original textBard and was debuted at the Henley Fringe festivalhttp://www.henleyfringe.org/ in July, 2014. The performance' warm welcome has inspired Revolve to take their adaptation of the historic play to new ventures in the future.

Existing =Georgetown bypass route= U.S. Route 460 Bypass (US 460 Byp.) is a bypass route in Georgetown, Kentucky. It serves as the main part of the Georgetown Bypass. The majority of its route is shared with US 62; the other part of the bypass is KY 1143\\\\. It begins across from the Carewood Golf Course and runs southeasterly where it intersects and merges with US 62. Just after sharply curving slightly to the northeast US 62/US 460 Byp. has an intersection with US 25, then begins to curve more toward the north around the vicinity of a pair of bridges over a railroad line. US 460 Byp. ends at US 460 two blocks west of exit 125 on I-75, while US 62 continues northward toward Columbus, Ohio. =Paintsville business loop= U.S. Route 460 Business (US 460 Business) was a business route in Paintsville, Kentucky and Prestonburg, Kentucky. Much of the route ran in a concurrency with U.S. Route 23 Business, as well as Kentucky Route 40, Kentucky Route 321, and Kentucky Route 114. =Pikeville business loop= U.S. Route 460 Business (US 460 Business) was a business route of Pikeville, Kentucky. Like the business route between Paintsville and Prestonburg, it ran in concurrency with U.S. Route 23 Business. The route began at a diamond interchange shared by the eastern terminus of KY 1384 and ran east where it eventually curved south and west around into downtown Pikeville. US BUS 23/460 ended at a semi-directional T interchange with US 23/460. =Grundy business loop= US 460 Bus. east of US 460 in Grundy U.S. Route 460 Business (US 460 Business) is a business route of US 460 through Grundy. =Richlands‚ÄìCedar Bluff business loop= View west along US 460 Bus. entering Cedar Bluff west of US 460 U.S. Route 460 Business (US 460 Business) is a business route of Richlands and Cedar Bluff, Virginia. The road begins as Front Street at an at-grade interchange with US 460 west of downtown Richlands, taking a concurrency with State Route 67 away from that route and immediately crosses a bridge over the Clinch River while running parallel to a Norfolk and Western Railroad line. The route splits into a one- way pair at Second Avenue, and the concurrency with SR 67 goes along with the split. Eastbound US BUS 460/SR 67 now runs along Front Street, while westbound US BUS 460/SR 67 runs along Second Street. The railroad tracks move away from Front Street west of the SR 609 (Veterans Drive) bridge. SR 609 only terminates at the westbound section of the route. The routes cross over the Clinch River a second time in both directions after this. Across the street from a wye junction with the previously mentioned railroad line, SR 67 turns north onto Railroad Avenue. The one-way split of US BUS 460 ends east of Grayson Avenue, and the first intersection after this split is the shared intersection with Dickerson Place and Teah Park Street. The business route resumes running parallel to the N&W; line, which itself now follows that Clinch River. Front Street rises above the tracks along a mountain, then curves towards the south. A local street branches off to the south as the railroad line and river follow that street instead, while US BUS 460 briefly curves back to the east. Near Richlands High School, the road turns southeast once again, descending gradually down a hill as it approaches its parent route. US BUS 460 ends at an unconventional quarter-cloverleaf interchange with US 460 at the Richland-Cedar Bluff border, which is also shared with the western terminus of SR 631 (Cedar Valley Drive). =Tazewell business loop= View south along US 19 Bus. and west along US 460 Bus. at SR 91 in Frog Level U.S. Route 460 Business (US 460 Business) is an business route of US 460 in Tazewell, Virginia. It is concurrent with US 19 Business for its entire length. The route begins at an at-grade intersection near the Historic Crab Orchard Museum, running southeast. The road makes a sharp curve to the east at the wye intersection of the northern terminus of State Route 91, and then joins a concurrency with State Route 16. The road doesn't enter \\"downtown\\" Tazewell until another wye with State Route 16 Alternate (Fairground Road), where the name is changed to West Main Street. West Fincastle Turnpike, which ran parallel to the north side of the road since SR ALT 16 merges with US BUS 19/460/SR 16 at the beginning of an undetermined historic district. Only at Central Avenue does the name change from West Main Street to East Man Street, where it skirts the southern edge of the Tazewell Historic District. East Main Street ends at Church Avenue and US BUS 19/460 turns south onto Church Avenue, only to make a sharp curve back to the northeast onto a road named the Fincastle Turnpike. It curves more toward the east before the concurrency with SR 16 ends at a low-key signalized intersection. Later the turnpike passes the Tazewell High School and some gas stations mixed in with primarily a residential area, which becomes more commercial east of Perry Street. The road curves northeast as it intersects Ben Bolt Road, and later crosses a bridge over the South Fork of the Clinch River thus entering an eastern sliver of North Tazewell where it encounters a diagonal intersection with State Route 61. Only after this intersection does the road run parallel to the North Fork of the Clinch River and a former Norfolk and Western Railroad line. Briefly curving to the right, it uses a low bridge over that river which now runs along the south and east side of the road (sometimes even at the shoulder of the road), while the railroad line remains along the north and west side of it. The road ends at an eastbound on-westbound off flyunder interchange with US 19/460. =Pearisburg business loop= View east along US 460 Bus. in Pearisburg U.S. Route 460 Business (US 460 Business) is a business route of US 460 through Pearisburg. Much of the route is concurrent with SR 100\\\\. =Blacksburg‚ÄìChristiansburg business loop= View west along US 460 Bus. just east of SR 114 in Christiansburg U.S. Route 460 Business (US 460 Business) is a business route of Blacksburg and Christiansburg, Virginia, of which can be found in Blacksburg and of which can be found in Christiansburg. After US 460 curves to the south, US BUS 460 branches off to the southeast between Bishop Road (SR 648) and Farmingdale Lane, and is named North Main Street. Within downtown Blacksburg, it encounters a traffic circle at the end of SR 412. From there, the road encounters the Virginia Tech Alumni Mall (SR 314). At the four corners of Blacksburg, North Main Street becomes South Main Street at Roanoke Street which changes from West Main Street to East Main Street. Eventually it curves straight south as it passes by the runway of the Virginia Tech Montgomery Executive Airport. US BUS 460 has an interchange with its parent route but does not terminate there. This interchange contains unbuilt ramps leading to and from Transportation Research Drive, the home of the Virginia Tech Transportation Institute. The former right-of-way of the parent route and business route can be found on the southwest corner of the interchange. After the intersection of SRs 808/643, the route passes by the Lewis-Gale Hospital- Montgomery, which is flanked to the south and west by SR 775. Just north of SR 657 the route enters Christiansburg and becomes North Franklin Street. One noteworthy site along the way is the large Corning Glass Factory in the distance along the west side. Around the same area, the road is three blocks west of the parent route. The road runs southwest until it runs past the New River Valley Mall on the northwest corner of the intersection with State Route 114, and then curves back to the southeast, where it approaches a second interchange with US 460 only to be diverted to the south once again. Technically, this interchange is where the Blacksburg business route ends and the Christiansburg business route begins. It includes a trumpet interchange between the Blacksburg and Christiansburg business routes, and wye interchanges with the parent route for both. Additionally, the southbound ramp between the Blacksburg and Christiansburg Business Routes contains an off-ramp to Cambria Street (State Route 111), but all segments encounter railroad crossings before intersecting SR 111 itself. From there the road climbs a hill, then descends as it passes a historical marker for the Christiansburg Industrial Institute next to an Appalachian Power substation before crossing the bridge over Crab Creek, which also runs over a two-tracked Norfolk and Western Railway line that pass by the nearby Cambria Freight Station. In the heart of Downtown Christiansburg, US BUS 460 makes a left turn onto a concurrency with US 11 at East Main Street, and both routes make a sharp turn to the right onto Roanoke Street, which becomes Lee Highway east of First Street Southeast Lee Highway crosses another railroad line, this time at an at-grade level crossing before encountering the southern terminus of SR 111 this time as Depot Street Northeast. Just after the Gateway Plaza North shopping center, US Bus 460 encounters a third interchange with US 460, but finally ends at an interchange with I-81 (Exit 118) where US 460 itself takes over the concurrency with US 11 along Lee Highway. =Salem alternate route= View north along US 11 Alt. and east along US 460 Alt. in Salem U.S. Route 460 Alternate (US 460 Alternate) is a alternate route in Salem, Virginia. It is concurrent with US 11 Alternate for its entire length. Beyond the eastern terminus, the US 11 Alternate continues along main line US 460 into Roanoke, Virginia. =Bedford business loop= US 460 Bus. westbound at SR 122 in Bedford U.S. Route 460 Business (US 460 Business) is a business route of Bedford, Virginia. The route runs in a concurrency with US 221, as well as a brief one with State Route 43. =Timberlake‚ÄìLynchburg business loop= US 460 Bus. eastbound at SR 647 in Timberlake U.S. Route 460 Business (US 460 Business) is a business route of Lynchburg, Virginia. The route begins in Timberlake at a trumpet interchange with US 460 east of the intersection with SR 681, and runs northeast as a four-lane divided highway known as Timberlake Road. It remains in Timberlake until the intersection with Crowell Lane where it enters the Lynchburg City Limits, maintaining the same characteristics as a commercial strip that it had in Timberlake. After the interchange with US 501, the road becomes Fort Avenue. East of John Lynch Place, Fort Avenue becomes a four-lane undivided highway until it passes Westview Avenue and divides again before seeming to terminate at State Route 163. US BUS 460/SR 163 runs in a northeast concurrency as a four-lane undivided highway until it reaches the Fort Early and Jubal Early Monument, where SR 163 diverges north as two-lane Memorial Avenue at an acute intersection, and US BUS 460 becomes a two-lane highway as well. Access from southbound SR 163 to eastbound US 460 Business and from westbound US 460 Business to northbound SR 163 is provided through Oakridge Boulevard. At Wythe Road, US BUS 460 is joined by US 221, just east of Calvin Falwell Field. US 221/BUS 460 runs along the northwest side of the Spring Hill Cemetery and after they veer onto 12th Street the routes are joined by US BUS 501 at Campbell Avenue. After the bridge over the Norfolk Southern Railway's Danville District rail line all three routes turn south onto Kemper Street, which becomes a four-lane divided highway past 16th Street as it approaches the interchange with US BUS 29, an interchange that stands as the northern terminus of US 221. Kemper Street runs beneath another railroad line then veers back towards Campbell Avenue and ends there, but US BUS 460/501 continue south onto Campbell Avenue, as does the status as a four-lane divided highway until the divider ends just before it crosses a bridge over Norfolk Southern Railway's Blue Ridge District. From there, the routes wind through the mostly residential hills of southeastern Lynchburg, and serves as the northeastern terminus of State Route 128. The undivided section ends southeast of Woodrow Street and a former segment of Campbell Avenue. US BUS 460/501 ends at an interchange with US 460/29 near the Falwell Airport, while US 501 moves onto Campbell Avenue at that interchange towards South Boston, Durham, North Carolina, and Myrtle Beach, South Carolina. =Appomattox business loop= View east along US 460 Bus. at SR 131 and SR 1012 in Appomattox U.S. Route 460 Business (US 460 Business) is a business route of Appomattox, Virginia. The road is named Confederate Boulevard and begins at a diamond interchange along US 460 with the southern terminus of State Route 26, and the east end of the concurrency with US 460 and State Route 24. The concurrency with SR 24 ends shortly after this interchange and makes a left turn onto Old Courthouse Road as it heads for Mt. Rush, Virginia. Simultaneously it joins another concurrency with State Route 131, which ends one block to the southeast. SR 131 leads to the Appomattox Historic District. A former segment of the Confederate Highway can be found in the form of SR 1004 (Patricia Anne Lane) on the north side of the road, however a much more important intersection is encountered in the form of SR 727 (Church Street), which also leads to the Appomattox Historic District. US BUS 460 then runs between the Appomattox County Middle School and a school bus yard just west of the southeastern terminus of State Route 131, which is across from SR 631 (Oakleigh Avenue) and the eastern terminus of SR 1004. The trajectory of the route begins to curve more towards the east at SR 635. The route ends at a wye interchange at US 460 that includes a single east to west ramp between eastbound US 460 and westbound US BUS 460. =Pamplin City business loop= View east along US 460 Bus. past SR 47 in Pamplin City U.S. Route 460 Business (US 460 Business) is a business route of Pamplin City, Virginia. The road is a former segment of US 460 named Pamplin Road which runs southeast into town along the east side of a Norfolk Southern Railroad line and serves as the northern terminus of State Route 47. East of there, the route curves to the northeast and runs along the west side of the High Bridge Trail until terminating at its parent route. =Farmville business loop= View west at the east end of US 460 Bus. just east of Farmville U.S. Route 460 Business (US 460 Business) is a business route of Farmville, Virginia. It begins at a trumpet interchange with the west end of a concurrency with US 15 and briefly runs north before making a sharp right turn onto U.S. Business Route 15 and SR 695. As US BUS 15/460 gets closer to Downtown Farmville, SR 695 breaks away onto Fairgrounds Road, and the street name becomes West Third Street. The formerly overlapped secondary route intersects again, and later terminates at US BUS 15/460 just north of the High Bridge Trail. Within the Farmville Historic District, US BUS 15 leaves US BUS 460 at the city's four corners at South Main Street which is also the southern terminus of State Route 45 (North Main Street), and US BUS 460 continues onto East Third Street. The route curves toward the southeast occasionally passing some random shopping centers then turns to random residencies and small offices before entering a small swath of oak forest land. After crossing the bridge over Brirey Creek, US BUS 460 finally ends at a wye interchange with US 460 southeast of the town. =Burkeville business route= US 360 Bus. and US 460 Bus. at SR 716 just west of Burkeville U.S. Route 460 Business (US 460 Business) is a business route of Burkeville, Virginia. It is named Second Street and is concurrent with US 360 Business for its entire length. =Nottoway‚ÄìBlackstone business loop= U.S. Route 460 Business (US 460 Business) is a business route of Nottoway and Blackstone, Virginia. US 460 Bus. eastbound in Blackstone The route begins at an unusual half-diamond/trumpet interchange onto a street called \\"Old Nottoway Road\\" which immediately runs over a bridge over a Norfolk and Western Railroad line southeast of the eastbound on-and-off-ramps of US 460. After the shared intersection with Brick Kiln Lane and Carson Lane, a secondary route veers off to the south named SR 625 (West Courthouse Road), which leads to the historic Nottoway County Courthouse. The rest of the route runs mostly southeast and is almost entirely rural with barren forests interrupted occasionally by farmland, moderate to minor intersections, and abandoned local businesses. The road widens in order to accommodate left-turn lanes in the vicinity of Nottoway High School, but returns to two lanes once it passes the school, returning to its previously described characteristics. Occasionally, the road gets close enough to the Norfolk and Western line it passed over near its western terminus. At a point where the road turns south, it even passes an abandoned restaurant and gas station. In Blackstone, the street name changes from Old Nottoway Road to Church Street, although there aren't as many churches along this street as the name implies. There is, however, a religious radio station, a city Department of Public Works office, the Blackstone Christian Church, the Blackstone Presbyterian Church, the Blackstone Volunteer Fire Department on the northwest corner of SR 614 (Mill Street), Blackstone United Methodist Church, and finally the St. Luke's Episcopal Church, where the street ends and US BUS 460 turns north in a concurrency with State Route 40 (South Main Street). US BUS 460/SR 40 serves as the street where cross streets lose their \\"West\\" prefixes and get \\"East\\" prefixes and vice versa. They encounter SR 614 again at West/East Irvin Street. South Main Street itself becomes North Main Street at West/East Broad Street. SR 40 turns east onto Dimwiddie Street and US BUS 460 continues north onto North Main Street, which becomes Cox Road as it curves to the northeast and leaves the city limits. The surroundings become rural once again, as the road briefly runs parallel to the previously mentioned Norfolk and Western line, only to move away from the tracks in order to rise over an embankment so that it may cross another bridge over the tracks. US BUS 460 descends from that bridge near a local lumber yard on the south side of the road and north side of the tracks. The road curves to the northeast one last time where it descends as it finally terminates at the intersection of its parent route, which it shares with SR 609 (Yellow Bird Road). =Petersburg business loop= View west along US 460 Bus. in Petersburg U.S. Route 460 Business (US 460 Business) is a business route of Petersburg, Virginia. The route begins at Interstate 85 where the concurrency between US 1 and US 460 terminates at Exit 63. US 1/BUS 460 makes a sharp turn to the east around Central State Hospital and becomes West Washington Street. After running beneath a railroad bridge signed for Seaboard Systems, the routes become a one-way pair with northeast- bound traffic shifting to West Wythe Street and southeast-bound traffic remaining along West Washington Street. At South Street, the routes are joined by Virginia Truck Route 36. The concurrency with US 1/VA 36 Truck ends at US 301 (Adams Street), and US BUS 460 joins southbound US 301 itself. US 301/BUS 460 continue to run down East Wythe and Washington Streets, and after the first interchange with I-95 at Exit 52, the routes turn south onto South Crater Street. This concurrency only lasts until the second interchange with I-95 at Exit 50 B-C. Here, the eastbound lanes join the southbound frontage road of I-95, while the westbound one joins Winfield Road, which contains two- way traffic until it encounters the northbound I-95 off ramp for Exit 50B. Eastbound US BUS 460's concurrency with I-95 ends at a wye interchange at Exit 50A, and eastbound and westbound segments rejoin again along the route's only independent segment, which ends at Wagner Avenue where it terminates with both its parent route and SR 106. =Suffolk business loop= View east at the west end of US 460 Bus. at US 13/US 58/US 460 in Suffolk U.S. Route 460 Business (US 460 Business) is a business route of Suffolk, Virginia. It begins at the partial cloverleaf interchange and the west end of US 460's concurrencies with US 13 and US 58, running southeast where it crosses over a bridge near Sadler Pond, and then curves to the south as it merges with State Route 10 and State Route 32 running in a short concurrency. The route turns east again at the intersection of US BUS 13 and US BUS 58, and follows that route onto another concurrency which ends at an interchange with US 13/58/460. =Chesapeake‚ÄìNorfolk alternate route= View east along US 460 Alt. and US 58 in Chesapeake U.S. Route 460 Alternate (US 460 Alternate) is a alternate route between Norfolk and Chesapeake, Virginia. Part of the route is shared with US 58 until it reaches State Route 337, and briefly moves onto a concurrency with that route. After crossing a railroad line it shifts onto an interchange with Interstate 264 at Exit 4 and heads east through a fly-under ramp.

Cyprus Memorial Cemetery (), is a memorial forest including a symbolic military cemetery and an open-air museum dedicated to the Turkish servicemen killed in action during the 1974 Turkish military invasion of Cyprus. Established in 1976, it is located at Silifke district of Mersin Province in southern Turkey. The memorial place is in a pine woods covering at √áamd√ºz√º, west of Silifke on the provincial road 33-58 between Silifke and G√ºlnar just west of State road D715. Following the 1974 Cypriot coup d'√©tat, Turkey, fearing an intercommunal fighting and killing, intervened . In 1976, a symbolic cemetery was established in commemoration of 454 Turkish army servicemen. A tree was planted next to each symbolic grave. A monument of Atat√ºrk is erected in the middle of s ceremonial square surrounded by the symbolic graves. Another monument is dedicated to the fallen 220 warriors of the Turkish-Cypriot resistance. There is also a museum at the military memorial, in which weapons like rifles, pistols and ammunition are exhibited. Some heavy military equipment, such as a tank, a howitzer and an armoured personnel carrier, which were captured from the Greek-Cypriot Army, are on display in the open-air museum. The military memorial, which was initially administrated by the National Parks Authority, was later handed over to the Regional Forest Directoriate due to its nature of a forest. By the summer of 2014, the Regional Forest Directoriate sent the museum's display items to the Mersin Naval Museum on grounds that they are not capable of their maintenance. In December, 2014, the heavy military equipment were transferred to the newly established Mersin Peace Museum, an action, which was highly protested by the local residents. Couple of days later, the open-air museum's articles were returned to the military memorial. The memorial cemetery hosts an official ceremony every year.

Using materials that invoke both conflict and construction, Violent Garden invited the viewer to consider notions of autonomy and evolution. Informed by the social, religious, and political history of suicide, the project highlighted themes of individual power and the primal self. Through these sculptures, Rogers questioned the dynamic between spirit, body, and matter, and examined the interplay between industrial progress and the violence of the natural world.  \\"SUBJECT\\"  \\"SUBJECT\\" was inspired by a produce truck driveshaft and the most fertile soil (Terra Petra) found in California.

Vuosaarenhuippu is a recreational area in the northern part of Vuosaari in eastern Helsinki. Earlier it was the Vuosaari dumping ground and a place where land masses from construction sites was deposited. Through ecological restoration the area has been turned into a natural-like environment, the scale of which is unprecedented in the history of Helsinki. A large number of both flora and fauna inhabit the area. There are paths connecting the area to the nearby Mustavuori protected area. Dumping ground =History of the dumping ground = Vuosaari dumping ground was a municipal dumping ground in the years 1966‚Äì1975 and 1979‚Äì1988. During the latter period it was one of the ‚Äúbig three‚Äù. The two others were the Iso-Huopalahti dumping ground and the Pasila dumping ground. The Vuosaari dumping ground is the second biggest dumping ground in the Nordic countries ever, second only to the current √Ñmm√§ssuo dumping ground in Espoo, Finland. The waste taken there included domestic waste, industrial waste, and in all likelihood also hazardous waste. The Lohja Kalkkitehdas dumping ground In the early 1960s, the Lohjan Kalkkitehdas Oy (‚ÄòLohja Burnt Chalk Factory‚Äô) had a limestone quarry in the area and also a dumping ground. The quarry could later be seen in the scene as an old pond. The speciality of the place was pink marble, which first jota Lohjan Kalkki Oy and later Rudus Oy would retrieve in slates from depths up to 60 metres deep. It seems that also a stone crushing plant operated in the area, since the local residents made a complaint about the dust it emitted. As a result of this complaint, it was found that the amount of dust in the air was harmful for human beings, and the company was ordered to manage its dust emissions. It is difficult of find more precise information on this phase of the dumping ground. A city of Helsinki dumping ground  The Vuosaari dumping ground was taken to use after Vuosaari had been annexed to the city in 1966 and after the Vartiokyl√§ dumping ground had at the same time become too full to be used any longer. At the time, Vuosaari was a remote place next to the city boundaries against Helsinki Rural Commune and Sipoo. In spite of the remote location, the nearest dwellings were located only 400 metres from the dumping ground. In addition, the place was unguarded and it was full of rats and seagulls. The waste formed loose masses of matter, and for this reason fires were frequent, and the dense smoke from these fires was a severe inconvenience for the local residents. From 1975 the dumping ground was temporarily out of use, but since the use of the Iso-Huopalahti dumping ground ended, the city began to transport to Vuosaari again. The residents considered this to be an illegal maneuver, and they were strongly opposed to it. It was said the site was still badly managed, after all, it was still unguarded, and it was claimed in the media that hazardous waste, such as poisons, petroleum derivatives and solvents were taken there. In 1980, the housing cooperatives of the neighbourhood complained about the dumping ground to the health authorities, to the Helsinki Police Department and finally, to the Chancellor of Justice. Also, the Finnish Nature Conservation Society demanded that the dumping ground be closed. The Uusimaa Provincial Court banned the use of the site, and as the possibilities for the city to dispose of its waste were thus narrowed down, the importance of the Kyl√§saari Waste Incineration Plant grew accordingly in the city waste management. Apparently, since the use of the site became banned, it consequently became a guarded site in 1981. It seems that domestic and industrial waste was no longer taken to Vuosaari, but landfill materials were taken there, apparently up to 1988. However, some sources mention the Vuosaari dumping ground as the main dumping ground for the city of Helsinki in the 1980s. The site of the former dumping ground thus consists of two parts, the former dumping ground proper, which amounts to 25 hectares, and the landfill hill, which apparently amounts to 35 hectares. Since 1983, the Helsinki Metropolitan Area Council has been responsible for the area. During its last years of operation, the dumping ground was repeatedly taken up by the mass media. The closing of this site in all likelihood was due to negative public opinion. =The amount and nature of the waste= A total of 3.4 million tons of municipal solid waste and 150 000 tons of industrial waste was taken to the site. (Some sources indicate only 1,7 million tons of waste.) In addition to this, construction waste, sulphur removal agents, solvents, hospital waste and ashes from coal power plants and precipitates and silt have been taken there. Among these, there are polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, volatile organic compounds, heavy metals and sulphur compounds. In all likelihood, these include also toxic wastes. =Restoration= In the 1990s, a gas emission collection system was built in the area. It comprises 27 wells, plumbing, a pumping station, a flame incinerator, and a system of pipelines that takes the heat into a heating plant. After fill was no longer taken to the place, substantial amounts of clean excess land has been placed on top of it. At some point, either before or after the use of the site as a dumping ground, the area has been cordoned off with land walls. In spite of this, the former dumping ground has been classified as a risky site, and what comes to the rain waters and waters from melting snow that are being filtered through the land is constantly being monitored. =Landscape restoration and landscape = The actual landscape restoration can take place only when the gas emissions from the landfill have ended. The new pipeline system is designed to accelerate the escaping process of the gases. Excess land has been accumulated on the landfill hill for decades. The top soil of the hill has been brought to the site from the construction site of the Vuosaari Harbour. Earthmovers have brought 80 000 cubic metres of earth from K√§√§rmeniemi (the site of the harbour). The land masses have been re-placed in an innovative way, preserving the order of the original land layers. Thus the top layer, with its organic matter, with all its microbes, seeds and organisms on the top, so that after they have recovered from the shock of the transfer, they can start a new life at the new location. Certain precious soil types with their plants were even transported on stretchers, as if they had been human patients. Thus plants, organisms and mycelia will continue growing in the new location. The maximum height of the place is considerable after all the excess landmasses that have been taken there, and thus the place can be seen from afar, and also, from the top of the hill, one can see most of the surrounding areas. But after all this had been going on for quite some time already, the plans changed again. One commentator said that The landscape restoration of the City of Helsinki Public Works Department, and especially the head of its workshop, Mr. Jukka Toivonen, has been lauded by The Finnish Association for Nature Conservation, and they have received the Countdown Prize from the Finnish IUCN Committee. According to the commentator quote above, Inspiration for the landscape design has been drawn from the biotopes of the outer islands of Finland's archipelagos, the open slopes of heights, increasingly rare type of groves and the grazed traditional landscape, such as the dale of H√§nt√§l√§ in Somero. In the summer of 2014 land masses from the future residential neighbourhood of Kruunuvuorenranta have been brought here. The landscape designers are eagerly waiting to see what kind of plants will emerge from the seeds in that soil. The present state of the site Although the city of Helsinki began the landscape restoration only in 2003, over 400 plant species are found here, as well as many rare or endangered animal species. A significant part of the flora of the landfill area has originally come here with the top soils chosen from construction sites, either as already in plant form or as seeds. The Vuosaarenhuippu area is a kind of a reservation, into which it is possible to transfer rare and regional plant species which are overrun by the expanding development of the city. As a result of the accumulation of land masses, the hill is a rather high one, and it can be seen from afar, and from the top, one can also see most of the surrounding areas. At the highest spot, at an elevation of 65 metres, there is a scenic spot, from which one can see a view to e.g. the Vuosaari Harbour. From the north, there is an accessible route to the highest point of the hill. The accessible route begins at the parking lot next to Niinisaarentie street, and it proceeds along the official route. The route proceeds between the old dumping ground and the reed growth of the Porvarinlahti Bay and on to the northwestern slope of the hill. From there the route climbs up the slope to the northern point of the hilltop. From the south, however, there is no route accessible for all. The most obvious route, and the shortest, as the crow flies, from Niinisaarentie to the eastern slope is not open to the public.

Raised in Kentucky, Glassford followed his family to farm in Johnson County, Illinois. He then followed his father to St. Louis, Missouri where Glassford engaged first in the sugar trade, then purchased some coal mines. He returned to the family farm in Illinois in 1860 and amassed a large estate. He served two terms in the Illinois Senate in the 1870s. Biography Samuel McFadden Glassford was born in Indiana County, Pennsylvania on November 15, 1825. When he was eight years old, his family moved to Mason County, Kentucky; his father George had opened a blacksmith shop in May's Lick. Glassford attended public schools there until 1841, when the family moved to Johnson County, Illinois near Vienna. In 1849, he left for St. Louis, Missouri, where his father had moved three years earlier. There, Glassford worked for sugar refiners Belcher & Brothers. Glassford purchased their coal mining interests from the controlling family and focused the rest of his career on the coal trade. In 1860, Glassford sold his interest in coal to his brother John, then retired to the family farm in Elvira, Illinois. He had inherited a share of the farm from his parents and bought out the portions granted to the other heirs. He continued to accumulate land for the farm until his estate totaled approximately . In 1861, he partnered with his brother to build a flour and woolen mill in Vienna. However, shortly before the mill was put into motion, it burned down for a loss of about $40,000. In the ensuing years, Glassford became a staunch prohibitionist. In 1874, he was elected to the Illinois Senate, where he served two consecutive two-year terms as an independent. Glassford married Elizabeth Jones in 1846, but she died a few years later. In 1851, Glassford married her sister, Juliet Jones. They had three children together: Josephine, Charles A., and Mary E. The Glassfords were members of the Christian Church. Samuel M. Glassford died near Vienna on February 8, 1901 and was buried in the Old Oliver Cemetery.

History The company, originally City Furniture Company, was founded in 1902 by Charles Wolf and John Fox in downtown Altoona, Pennsylvania. In 1915, Wolf bought out Fox's interests, constructed a new five story building in Altoona, Pennsylvania, and renamed the business Wolf Furniture Company. At that time, it was the largest furniture store between Pittsburgh and Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. After Wolf's death in 1918, sons George and Herbert opened ten locations in and around Altoona. By 1992, the chain had grown to eighteen stores in Pennsylvania, Maryland and West Virginia. That year, the company decided to sell off fourteen of its stores to Heilig-Meyers Furniture. The Wolf chain, however, would eventually expand again including returning to locations held prior to the Heilig-Meyers sale. In 2000, Doug Wolf became the 8th president of Wolf Furniture Company. By 2003, the company volume exceeded $70,000,000, qualifying Wolf Furniture for a spot in the Top 100 among U.S. home furnishing retailers. The company expanded to include twelve locations in three states. The newest showroom was opened in Leesburg, Virginia in 2012. In 2013, long time Wolf executive Gene Stoltz was promoted to President of Wolf Furniture Company. In 2014, Paula Deen visited the Hagerstown showroom for a meet and greet with over 1,500 fans in promotion of her Universal Furniture collection, Paula Deen Home Furniture. In 2015, Wolf Furniture purchased the 73-year-old Maryland-based Gardiners Furniture chain and rebranded the stores Gardiner Wolf. This acquisition brought the number of Wolf-owned stores to eighteen. In 2017, Wolf Furniture was acquired by Art Van Furniture. Under the agreement, the Wolf company maintained its name and all current management and staff. In 2020, Art Van Furniture filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy with plans to liquidate all company-owned stores. The former owner of Levin Furniture, another chain acquired by Art Van in 2017, stepped in soon after and signed a deal to buy both the Levin Furniture and Wolf Furniture stores to save them from potential closures.

The bill would also change the procedures for screening and processing unaccompanied alien children who arrive at the border from certain countries. The bill would provide $659 million in supplemental funding. The bill was introduced into the United States House of Representatives during the 113th United States Congress. The Senate introduced the Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Act, 2014 (S. 2648; 113th Congress) to address the same issues. Background The children's immigration crisis refers to the surge in unaccompanied children from Central America seeking entrance to the United States. The surge has increased rapidly, doubling in volume each year, reaching crisis proportions in 2014 when tens of thousands of women and children from Honduras, Guatemala, and El Salvador migrated to the United States. Many of the children had no parent/legal guardian available to provide care or physical custody and quickly overwhelmed local border patrols.6 U.S.C. ¬ß 279(g)(2) The provisions of H.R. 7311, William Wilberforce Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of 2008, signed into law by George W. Bush give substantial rights and protection to unaccompanied children from countries which do not have a common border with the United States. This made expeditious deportation of the large number of children from Central America difficult and expensive, prompting a call by President Barack Obama for an emergency appropriation of nearly $4 billion and resulted in discussions on how to interpret or revise the 2008 law in order to expedite handling large numbers of unaccompanied children. Provisions of the bill This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the Congressional Research Service, a public domain source. The Secure the Southwest Border Supplemental Appropriations Act, 2014 would provide supplemental FY2014 appropriations for the United States Department of Homeland Security (DHS), including U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE); the United States Department of Defense (DOD); the United States Department of Justice (DOJ); and the United States Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) for expenses related to the rise in unaccompanied alien children and alien adults accompanied by an alien minor at the southwest border. The bill would permit funds previously appropriated for the United States Department of State, foreign operations, and related programs for assistance to the countries in Central America to be used for repatriation and reintegration activities. The bill would specify other authorized, restricted, and prohibited uses of appropriated funds. The bill would include rescissions of funds previously appropriated to various federal agencies. The Secure the Southwest Border Act of 2014 would amend the William Wilberforce Trafficking Victims Protection Authorization Act of 2008 to change the procedures for screening and processing unaccompanied alien children who arrive at the border from certain countries. The bill would amend the Immigration and Nationality Act to include the commission of certain drug-related offenses as grounds for per se ineligibility for asylum. The bill would permit appropriations provided to DOD under this Act to be used for the National Guard to provide support for operations on the southern border. The bill would prohibit the United States Secretary of the Interior and the United States Secretary of Agriculture (USDA) from impeding, prohibiting, or restricting certain CBP activities on federal lands. The bill would express the sense of Congress that the United States Secretary of Defense should not allow the placement of unauthorized aliens at military installations unless certain conditions are met. Congressional Budget Office report This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the Congressional Budget Office, a public domain source. Division B of H.R. 5230, the Secure the Southwest Border Act of 2014, would amend the rules that apply to unaccompanied alien children, particularly children from countries other than Mexico or Canada. Among other changes, such children would now have the option to voluntarily depart the United States without appearing before an immigration judge. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) considers it likely that enacting Division B would reduce the number of children present in the United States receiving means‚Äêtested federal benefits, thereby reducing direct spending for such benefits. However, CBO cannot estimate the potential reduction in direct spending at this time. Procedural history H.R. 5230 was introduced into the United States House of Representatives on July 29, 2014 by Rep. Hal Rogers (R-KY). The bill was referred to the United States House Committee on Appropriations. The House was scheduled to vote on the bill on July 31, 2014, but the Republican leadership canceled the vote because they did not have enough votes to pass the bill at that time. On July 30, 2014, President Barack Obama released a statement of administration policy stating that \\"his senior adivsors would recommend he veto the bill\\" if it were presented to him for his signature. Debate and discussion On July 9, 2014 a hearing on the crisis was held by the United States Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs. The testimony of Statement of Craig Fugate Administrator, Federal Emergency Management Agency U.S. Department of Homeland Security was that \\"We are talking about large numbers of children, without their parents, who have arrived at our border‚Äîhungry, thirsty, exhausted, scared and vulnerable.\\"Statement of Craig Fugate Administrator, Federal Emergency Management Agency U.S. Department of Homeland Security Senator Dianne Feinstein compared the crisis to the American refusal to accept Jewish refugees from Nazi Germany aboard the MS St. Louis. The President's request for additional funds was met in both houses of Congress by proposals to modify or eliminate the rights granted by the 2008 reauthorization of the Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act of 2000 A 2014 Mother Jones article suggests many of these unaccompanied children are attempting to escape abusive situations. Analysis of Border Patrol statistics shows a correlation between gang-related killing of children in Central America, particularly San Pedro Sula in Honduras, and the surge in migration. In a statement of administration policy, the Obama Administration announced their strong opposition to the bill. According to the statement, \\"by setting arbitrary timelines for the processing of cases, this bill could create backlogs that could ultimately shift resources away from priority public safety goals like deporting known criminals.\\" The Administration also charged that the bill would hurt due process for the children and could result in children being sent back \\"to life threatening situations in foreign countries.\\" The Administration also objected that the \\"limited resources provided in H.R. 5230 are not designated as emergency, but rather come at the expense of other Government functions.\\" This bill would provide significantly less than President Obama's requested $3.7 billion. It would also provide less than the $2.7 billion found in the Senate supplemental funding bill. Rep. Hal Rogers, who introduced the bill, urged members to pass the bill, arguing that \\"more and more immigrants will continue to flood across the border if you fail to act\\" because resources were running out. Democratic opposition to the bill stemmed from the changes it would make to the William Wilberforce Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of 2008 which would allow unaccompanied child migrants to be deported faster.

It is being explored to treat ground water, wastewater, soil, sediment, or other contaminated environmental materials. Nanoremediation is an emerging industry; by 2009, nanoremediation technologies had been documented in at least 44 cleanup sites around the world, predominantly in the United States. In Europe, nanoremediation is being investigated by the EC funded NanoRem Project. A report produced by the NanoRem consortium has identified around 70 nanoremediation projects worldwide at pilot or full scale. During nanoremediation, a nanoparticle agent must be brought into contact with the target contaminant under conditions that allow a detoxifying or immobilizing reaction. This process typically involves a pump-and-treat process or in situ application. Some nanoremediation methods, particularly the use of nano zero- valent iron for groundwater cleanup, have been deployed at full-scale cleanup sites. Other methods remain in research phases. Applications Nanoremediation has been most widely used for groundwater treatment, with additional extensive research in wastewater treatment. Nanoremediation has also been tested for soil and sediment cleanup. Even more preliminary research is exploring the use of nanoparticles to remove toxic materials from gases. = Groundwater remediation = Currently, groundwater remediation is the most common commercial application of nanoremediation technologies. Using nanomaterials, especially zero-valent metals (ZVMs), for groundwater remediation is an emerging approach that is promising due to the availability and effectiveness of many nanomaterials for degrading or sequestering contaminants.Lowry, G. V. (2007). Nanomaterials for groundwater remediation. In: Wiesner, M.R.; Bottero, J. (eds.), \\"Environmental Nanotechnology\\". The McGraw-Hill Companies, New York, NY, pp. 297-336. Nanotechnology offers the potential to effectively treat contaminants in situ, avoiding excavation or the need to pump contaminated water out of the ground. The process begins with nanoparticles being injected into a contaminated aquifer via an injection well. The nanoparticles are then transported by groundwater flow to the source of contamination. Upon contact, nanoparticles can sequester contaminants (via adsorption or complexation), immobilizing them, or they can degrade the contaminants to less harmful compounds. Contaminant transformations are typically redox reactions. When the nanoparticle is the oxidant or reductant, it is considered reactive. The ability to inject nanoparticles to the subsurface and transport them to the contaminant source is imperative for successful treatment. Reactive nanoparticles can be injected into a well where they will then be transported down gradient to the contaminated area. Drilling and packing a well is quite expensive. Direct push wells cost less than drilled wells and are the most often used delivery tool for remediation with nanoiron. A nanoparticle slurry can be injected along the vertical range of the probe to provide treatment to specific aquifer regions. = Surface water treatment = The use of various nanomaterials, including carbon nanotubes and TiO2, shows promise for treatment of surface water, including for purification, disinfection, and desalination. Target contaminants in surface waters include heavy metals, organic contaminants, and pathogens. In this context, nanoparticles may be used as sorbents, as reactive agents (photocatalysts or redox agents), or in membranes used for nanofiltration. = Trace contaminant detection = Nanoparticles may assist in detecting trace levels of contaminants in field settings, contributing to effective remediation. Instruments that can operate outside of a laboratory often are not sensitive enough to detect trace contaminants. Rapid, portable, and cost- effective measurement systems for trace contaminants in groundwater and other environmental media would thus enhance contaminant detection and cleanup. One potential method is to separate the analyte from the sample and concentrate them to a smaller volume, easing detection and measurement. When small quantities of solid sorbents are used to absorb the target for concentration, this method is referred to as solid-phase microextraction.Addleman, R. S.; Egorov, O. B.; O'Hara, M.; Zemaninan, T. S.; Fryxell, G.; Kuenzi, D. (2005). Nanostructured sorbents for solid phase microextraction and environmental assay. In: Karn, B.; Masciangioli, T.; Zhang, W.; Colvin, V.; Alivisatos, P. (eds.), Nanotechnology and the Environment: Applications and Implications. Oxford University Press, Washington, DC, pp. 186-199. With their high reactivity and large surface area, nanoparticles may be effective sorbents to help concentrate target contaminants for solid-phase microextraction, particularly in the form of self-assembled monolayers on mesoporous supports. The mesoporous silica structure, made through a surfactant templated sol-gel process, gives these self-assembled monolayers high surface area and a rigid open pore structure. This material may be an effective sorbent for many targets, including heavy metals such as mercury, lead, and cadmium, chromate and arsenate, and radionuclides such as 99Tc, 137CS, uranium, and the actinides. Mechanism The small size of nanoparticles leads to several characteristics that may enhance remediation. Nanomaterials are highly reactive because of their high surface area per unit mass. Their small particle size also allows nanoparticles to enter small pores in soil or sediment that larger particles might not penetrate, granting them access to contaminants sorbed to soil and increasing the likelihood of contact with the target contaminant. Because nanomaterials are so tiny, their movement is largely governed by Brownian motion as compared to gravity. Thus, the flow of groundwater can be sufficient to transport the particles. Nanoparticles then can remain suspended in solution longer to establish an in situ treatment zone.Zhang, W.; Cao, J.; Elliot, D. (2005). Iron nanoparticles for site remediation. In: Karn, B.; Masciangioli, T.; Zhang, W.; Colvin, V.; Alivisatos, P. (eds.), Nanotechnology and the Environment: Applications and Implications. Oxford University Press, Washington, DC, pp. 248-261. Once a nanoparticle contacts the contaminant, it may degrade the contaminant, typically through a redox reaction, or adsorb to the contaminant to immobilize it. In some cases, such as with magnetic nano-iron, adsorbed complexes may be separated from the treated substrate, removing the contaminant. Target contaminants include organic molecules such as pesticides or organic solvents and metals such as arsenic or lead. Some research is also exploring the use of nanoparticles to remove excessive nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus. Materials A variety of compounds, including some that are used as macro- sized particles for remediation, are being studied for use in nanoremediation. These materials include zero-valent metals like zero-valent iron, calcium carbonate, carbon-based compounds such as graphene or carbon nanotubes, and metal oxides such as titanium dioxide and iron oxide. =Nano zero-valent iron= As of 2012, nano zero-valent iron (nZVI) was the nanoscale material most commonly used in bench and field remediation tests. nZVI may be mixed or coated with another metal, such as palladium, silver, or copper, that acts as a catalyst in what is called a bimetallic nanoparticle. nZVI may also be emulsified with a surfactant and an oil, creating a membrane that enhances the nanoparticle's ability to interact with hydrophobic liquids and protects it against reactions with materials dissolved in water. Commercial nZVI particle sizes may sometimes exceed true ‚Äúnano‚Äù dimensions (100 nm or less in diameter). nZVI appears to be useful for degrading organic contaminants, including chlorinated organic compounds such as polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and trichloroethene (TCE), as well as immobilizing or removing metals. nZVI and other nanoparticles that do not require light can be injected belowground into the contaminated zone for in situ groundwater remediation and, potentially, soil remediation. nZVI nanoparticles can be prepared by using sodium borohydride as the key reductant. NaBH4 (0.2 M) is added into FeCl3‚Ä¢6H2 (0.05 M) solution (~1:1 volume ratio). Ferric iron is reduced via the following reaction: 4Fe3+ \\\\+ 3B + 9H2O ‚Üí 4Fe0 \\\\+ 3H2B + 12H+ \\\\+ 6H2 Palladized Fe particles are prepared by soaking the nanoscale iron particles with an ethanol solution of 1wt% of palladium acetate ([Pd(C2H3O2)2]3). This causes the reduction and deposition of Pd on the Fe surface: Pd2+ \\\\+ Fe 0 ‚Üí Pd0 \\\\+ Fe2+ Similar methods may be used to prepared Fe/Pt, Fe/Ag, Fe/Ni, Fe/Co, and Fe/Cu bimetallic particles. With the above methods, nanoparticles of diameter 50-70 nm may be produced. The average specific surface area of Pd/Fe particles is about 35 m2/g. Ferrous iron salt has also been successfully used as the precursor. =Titanium dioxide= Titanium dioxide (TiO2) is also a leading candidate for nanoremediation and wastewater treatment, although as of 2010 it is reported to have not yet been expanded to full-scale commercialization. When exposed to ultraviolet light, such as in sunlight, titanium dioxide produces hydroxyl radicals, which are highly reactive and can oxidize contaminants. Hydroxyl radicals are used for water treatment in methods generally termed advanced oxidation processes. Because light is required for this reaction, TiO2 is not appropriate for underground in situ remediation, but it may be used for wastewater treatment or pump-and-treat groundwater remediation. TiO2 is inexpensive, chemically stable, and insoluble in water. TiO2 has a wide band gap energy (3.2 eV) that requires the use of UV light, as opposed to visible light only, for photocatalytic activation. To enhance the efficiency of its photocatalysis, research has investigated modifications to TiO2 or alternative photocatalysts that might use a greater portion of photons in the visible light spectrum. Potential modifications include doping TiO2 with metals, nitrogen, or carbon. Challenges When using in situ remediation the reactive products must be considered for two reasons. One reason is that a reactive product might be more harmful or mobile than the parent compound. Another reason is that the products can affect the effectiveness and/or cost of remediation. TCE (trichloroethylene), under reducing conditions by nanoiron, may sequentially dechlorinate to DCE (dichloroethene) and VC (vinyl chloride). VC is known to be more harmful than TCE, meaning this process would be undesirable. Nanoparticles also react with non-target compounds. Bare nanoparticles tend to clump together and also react rapidly with soil, sediment, or other material in ground water. For in situ remediation, this action inhibits the particles from dispersing in the contaminated area, reducing their effectiveness for remediation. Coatings or other treatment may allow nanoparticles to disperse farther and potentially reach a greater portion of the contaminated zone. Coatings for nZVI include surfactants, polyelectrolyte coatings, emulsification layers, and protective shells made from silica or carbon. Such designs may also affect the nanoparticles‚Äô ability to react with contaminants, their uptake by organisms, and their toxicity. A continuing area of research involves the potential for nanoparticles used for remediation to disperse widely and harm wildlife, plants, or people. In some cases, bioremediation may be used deliberately at the same site or with the same material as nanoremediation. Ongoing research is investigating how nanoparticles may interact with simultaneous biological remediation.

Early life The third son of John Laffan, of Skehanagh, counties Clare and Limerick, he was born on 21 September 1821. Educated at the college of Pont Levoy, near Blois, France, he went to the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich, in September 1835, and on 5 May 1837 was gazetted a second lieutenant in the Royal Engineers. Career After serving for two years at Chatham and Woolwich, and becoming first lieutenant on 1 April 1839, Laffan was sent to South Africa, where he was employed in frontier service. He was one of the officers summoned by the governor, Sir George Napier, to a council of war in order to concert measures for the relief of Captain Thomas Charlton Smith and the garrison of Port Natal, then beleaguered by a force of Boers under Andries Pretorius. Laffan took charge of the engineering arrangements of the expedition, under Abraham Josias Cloete, which relieved the British garrison. From the Cape, Laffan was sent to Mauritius, where he was promoted captain on 1 May 1846. On his return home in 1847 he was appointed commanding Royal Engineer at Belfast. At the close of the year was nominated an inspector of railways under the Board of Trade, a post he held until the autumn of 1852, when he was sent to Paris and Antwerp to report on the defences for the information of Sir John Fox Burgoyne, the inspector-general of fortifications. Laffan represented the borough of , Cornwall, in the House of Commons from 1852 to 1857 in the Conservative interest. In 1854 he was appointed commanding royal engineer in the London district, and in 1855 he was sent by the Duke of Newcastle, then secretary of state for war, with William Thomas Knollys and Sir George Maclean, to report on the organisation of the French minist√®re de la guerre. On his return to England in May 1855 he was appointed deputy inspector-general of fortifications at the War Office. From 1858 to 1860 he was absent on sick leave in the south of France and Switzerland. Laffan was promoted brevet-major on 26 October 1858, and became a regimental lieutenant- colonel on 28 November 1859. On his return from sick leave he was stationed at Portsmouth for a short time, and towards the end of 1860 he was sent to Malta as commanding Royal Engineer. He remained there for five years, during which the armament of the fortress was completely revised. He was promoted brevet- colonel on 28 November 1864. In 1865 Laffan was sent to Ceylon as a member of a commission to investigate and report on the military expenditure of the colony and the strength of the force to be maintained there in time of peace. He was at the same time deputed to report specially to the secretary of state for war on the defences. On his way home, under instructions from the war office, he visited the Suez Canal with Ferdinand de Lesseps, and he made a report to the secretary of state for war. He revisited Egypt at the invitation of de Lesseps, to witness the opening of the canal in November 1869. In 1866 Laffan was appointed commanding Royal Engineer at Aldershot; he transformed the appearance of the camp by planting trees and laying down grass, and the old Queen's Birthday Parade was later renamed Laffan's Plain in his memory. (Years later it became part of Farnborough Aerodrome.) He was promoted regimental colonel on 9 February 1870. In January 1872 he was sent to Gibraltar as commanding Royal Engineer, and remained there for five years. On 27 April 1877, Laffan was appointed governor and commander-in-chief of the Bermudas, with the rank of brigadier-general, and on 30 May the same year was made K.C.M.G. In the Gazette of 2 October 1877 he was promoted major-general, and under the provisions of the royal warrant then just issued his rank was antedated to 8 February 1870. He was promoted lieutenant-general on 1 July 1881. Family Laffan married in 1852 Emma, daughter of W. Norsworthy, and left a daughter and four sons. The eldest son, R. S. de Courcy Laffan, married Bertha Jane Grundy, as her second husband. Another son, Henry David Laffan (1858‚Äì1931) was a colonel in the Royal Engineers, who took part in the geodetic survey of the Cape Colony and Natal in 1883 to 1888. Death Laffan died on Bermuda, at Mount Langton, 22 March 1882. His body lay in state for two days, and was buried with military honours in Pembroke churchyard, Bermuda.

She was widely regarded as the best European filly of her generation in 1975, when she was unbeaten in three races including the Prix du Calvados and the Crit√©rium des Pouliches. In the following year she added wins in the Prix Vanteaux and Prix de la Nonette and finished second in a strongly-contested renewal of the Prix Saint-Alary, but appeared to be just below top class. She was later exported to race in the United States, where she campaigned with limited success. She was later a useful broodmare, producing several winners. Background Although officially described a bay during her racing career, Theia was a grey mare with a white blaze and three white socks bred in France by her owner Baronne de Lopez-Taragoya. Her sire, Caro, was a top-class performer (rated 133 by Timeform), whose wins included the Poule d'Essai des Poulains, Prix Ganay and Prix d'Ispahan, before becoming a very successful breeding stallion. Caro's other progeny included Madelia, Crystal Palace, Cozzene and Winning Colors. Theia's dam Cavadonga won as a two-year-old and produced several other winners. Theia was trained during her racing career by Raymond Touflan. Racing career =1975: two-year-old season= Theia, who had been the subject of very positive reports from her performances in training, made her debut in a maiden race over 1200 metres at Deauville Racecourse in August. She took the lead 400 metres from the finish and won by three lengths. Later that month, at the same course, Theia was moved up in class for the Prix du Calvados and started favourite against twelve opponents. She was among the leaders from the start, took the lead 300 metres from the finish and held off a late challenge from Antrona to win by a neck. On 5 October, Theia, ridden by Yves Saint-Martin, started the 3/1 favourite for France's premier race for juvenile fillies, the Crit√©rium des Pouliches over 1600 metres at Longchamp Racecourse. She was again opposed by Antrona as well as Imogene, a Maurice Zilber-trained filly who had run second to Vitiges in the Prix Morny. Theia tracked the leaders before making a forward move in the straight. She took the lead in the closing stages and won by three-quarters of a length from Antrona, who was subsequently disqualified for causing interference. =1976: three-year-old season= Theia began her second season in the Group Three Prix Vanteaux over 1900 metres at Longchamp on 19 April. Ridden by Freddie Head she started favourite and took her winning run to four, but finished only a head in front of the runner-up Elise Ma Belle. At the same course on 23 May, she was matched against Riverqueen (Poule d'Essai des Pouliches) and Flying Water (1000 Guineas) in the Prix Saint-Alary. Ridden by Henri Samani she finished strongly but was beaten three quarters of a length by Riverqueen, with Antrona in third, Kesar Queen (later to win the Coronation Stakes) in fourth and Flying Water in seventh. Theia started third favourite, at odds of 19/4 for the Prix de Diane at Chantilly Racecourse on 13 June, but finished fifth of the eleven runners, seven lengths behind the winner Pawneese. After a break of two months, Theia returned in the Prix de la C√¥te Normande at Deauville Racecourse on 12 August in which she was matched against colts for the first time. She started the 5/4 favourite, but finished third of the eleven runners behind Iron Duke and Cheraw. On 5 September, Theia, ridden by Gerard Dubroeucq, started 2.3/1 second favourite behind Antrona in the Group Three Prix de la Nonette over 2100 metres at Longchamp. She recorded her fifth win, beating Antrona by half a length, with No No Nanette a length and a half away in third place. Two weeks later she was moved up in distance for the Prix Vermeille over 2400 metres and finished fifth behind the Fran√ßois Boutin- trained Lagunette. After finishing fourth behind the four-year-old Dona Barod in the Prix de l'Op√©ra on 3 October she was sent to England for the Champion Stakes in which she finished unplaced behind Vitiges. =1977-1978: later career= As a four-year-old, Theia entered the ownership of Forest Acres stable and was sent California where she was trained by David Hofmans. She failed to win in seven starts in the United States but produced several good efforts in defeat. She did not race until August when she finished second in an allowance race at Del Mar Racetrack before running unplaced in the Grade III Ramona Handicap at the same track. All of her subsequent races were at Santa Anita Park. In October but and third in the . In October she ran fourth in an allowance race but then produced a much better effort when she finished second to the ex-British Swingtime in the Grade III Las Palmas Handicap. Towards the end of the season Theia ran third to Star Ball in the inaugural running of the Yellow Ribbon Stakes and third in the San Gorgonio Handicap. She ran once as a five-year-old, finishing third in an allowance race in January 1978. Assessment There was no International Classification of European two-year-olds in 1975: the official handicappers of Britain, Ireland and France compiled separate rankings for horses which competed in those countries. In the French Free Handicap, Theia was the highest-rated juvenile filly, a pound ahead of Antrona and six pounds below the top colt Manado. The independent Timeform organisation gave her a rating of 128, and named her the best two-year-old filly of the year. In the following year she was rated 117 by Timeform, fourteen pounds inferior to their top-rated three-year-old filly Pawneese. She was rated eight pounds below Pawneese in the French Free Handicap for three-year-olds. Breeding record Theia was retired from racing to become a broodmare in Kentucky. She was offered for sale at Keeneland in November 1983, but failed to reach her reserve price of $900,000. She produced at least eight foals and four winners between 1980 and 1989: *One More Slew (brown colt, foaled in 1980, sired by Seattle Slew), unraced *Tabun Bogdo (brown colt, 1982, by Seattle Slew), won one race *Antique Lamp (brown filly, 1984, by Seattle Slew), failed to win in ten races *Tanker Port (brown colt, 1982, by Valdez), won twelve races *Woodleys Fee (brown filly, 1986, by Seattle Slew), won one race *Winnie the Slew (grey colt, 1987, by Seattle Slew), failed to win in seven races *Shrewd Vixen (grey filly, 1988, by Spectacular Bid), won six races, dam of Bare Necessities (Sixty Sails Handicap, Gardenia Handicap) *Slewpercilious (grey filly, 1989, by Slewpy), unraced Pedigree References Category:1973 racehorse births Category:Racehorses bred in France Category:Racehorses trained in France Category:Thoroughbred family 16-g ","title":"Theia (horse)"},{"id":"43424933","text":"Caxiuan√£ National Forest (, also FLONA de Caxiuan√£) is a national forest located in lower Amazon region the state of Par√° in the North Region of Brazil. It is located on the west banks of the Ba√≠a de Caxiuan√£ between the Xingu River and downstream from the Anapu River. The forest is located southeast of the Ilha do Maraj√≥. Caxiuan√£ National Forest covers two municipalities in Par√°, Portel (population: 47,967) and Melga√ßo (population: 25,153), but the forest itself is sparsely inhabited. It is located from the state capitol of Bel√©m. Caxiuan√£ is noted for its rich biodiversity, geographic isolation, and a very low population density. The national forest is the oldest in Amaz√¥nia Legal, a region that contains all 9 states in the Amazon Basin, and is also the second oldest national forest in Brazil. Hearings on logging in Caxiuan√£ National Forest, part of a nationwide campaign to grant logging concessions in national parks by the Brazilian Forest Service (Servi√ßo Florestal Brasileiro, SFB), began in 2014. A proposal calls for the logging of in three areas of Caxiuan√£. Administration and research stations Caxiuan√£ National Forest was established on November 28, 1961, under federal law No. 239. It is managed by Chico Mendes Institute for Biodiversity Conservation (ICMBio), which maintains two bases in the forest. The Ferreira Penna Scientific Station (Esta√ß√£o Cient√≠fica Ferreira Penna) is maintained by the Museu Paraense Em√≠lio Goeldi and Brazilian Institute of Environment and Renewable Natural Resources (Instituto Brasileiro do Meio Ambiente e dos Recursos Naturais Renov√°veis, IBAMA), and is the center of many international research projects. The research station covers , opened in 1993, and consists of laboratories and housing. Climate Caxiuan√£ is located in the humid tropical climate zone with an annual medium temperature of , and mean annual rainfall is . The forest has two seasons. The dry season runs from June to December, with rainfall declining to in October. The wet season runs from January to May and rainfall reaches in March. Vegetation Caxiuan√£ is in the Tocantins-Araguaia-Maranh√£o moist forests ecoregion. The forest is noted for its diversity of vegetation. It is home to terra firme, a type of forest unique to the Amazon Basin where dead organic matter decays and is rapidly recycled into soil. Terra firme forests do not flood seasonally, and are easily and permanently destroyed by deforestation. Terra firme forests make up 85% of Caxiuan√£, and have a canopy that reaches on average. The soil of the terra firme is characterized by oxisol, a soil type typical of tropical rain forest. Floodplain forests unique to the Amazon River Basin are also present in Caxiuan√£. The v√°rzea, a seasonal floodplain forest engulfed by white water rivers of the Amazon. The v√°rzea forest areas are located around Caxiuan√£ Bay. Igap√≥ is a seasonal floodplain forest engulfed by blackwater of the Amazon. V√°rzea and igap√≥ flood plain forests make up 12% of Caxiuan√£. Caxiuan√£ also contains areas of vegetation similar to that found in the savanna, and areas that were formerly orchards and contain residual agricultural vegetation. Population Caxiuan√£ was once home to Arucar√° and Aricuru populations, both part of the Guaycuru people. 27 archaeological sites reveal that the forest was populated in ancient times. The forest now has a small population of 29 families with 206 members (2003). The population of the forest are concentrated into three small villages. Residents engage in primitive agriculture, primarily for the production of manioc flour. Fishing and hunting are also important sources of food. Brazil nuts and a√ßa√≠ are also exported from the forest. The current population of the forest may not cause damage to the forest as they carry on practices of the prehistoric population of the forest. Research on the local population and its effect on the ecology of Caxiuan√£, however, is lacking. Access Caxiuan√£ National Forest is accessible only by boat. The shortest route to the forest is made in two stages: first by air to the city of Breves, Par√°, also in the state of Par√°, and then an 8-hour boat ride to the Caxiuan√£. The trip can be made entirely by boat from Bel√©m, a trip of 25 hours.

History The roots of the university go back to 2001, when a group of American intellectuals originally from Cameroon decided to start a US-style university in Cameroon. In 2009, the Professional Training Center (PTC) went operational in Bamenda, Cameroon, approved by the Ministry of Employment and Vocational Training. It provided training in sustainable energy, especially solar energy. In 2012, Saint Monica University replaced the PTC, with the incorporation of the university in Hawaii in the United States as a non-profit institution offering Bachelor's, Master's, and Doctoral programs. In the same year (2012), Saint Monica University began seeking authorization to operate in Cameroon and was granted permission, where it operates under the name, Saint Monica University (SMU) Higher Institute. In a bid to expand into the United Kingdom, SMU established partnership with the Academy for International Science and Research (AISR) in Derry, Northern Ireland, which now serves as SMU's UK campus. Similarly, AISR now offers its programs in Cameroon at the SMU campus in Bulu, Buea. The SMU ground or permanent campus in Cameroon is located in the Bulu neighborhood in Buea, the campus has been christened \\"Civitas Dei,\\" Latin for \\"The City of God.\\" Accreditation Saint Monica University (SMU) is accredited by the United Kingdom-based Accreditation Service for International Colleges.

The station was owned by RKO General. Originally established in 1948, WNAC-TV signed off for the final time at 1:00 am on May 22, 1982, due to improprieties by its parent company; it was replaced that morning with WNEV-TV (now WHDH), which operates on a separate license. History =Origins= Test pattern used by WNAC-TV Boston in its early years WNAC-TV first signed on the air on June 21, 1948, as the second television station in Boston after WBZ-TV (channel 4), which debuted twelve days earlier. Channel 7 originally operated as a CBS affiliate, but also carried some programs from the ABC and the now-defunct DuMont Television Network. The station was originally owned by General Tire, along with WNAC radio (then at 1260 AM, frequency now occupied by WBIX; later moved to 680 AM, now WRKO), which served as the flagship station of the Yankee Network, a regional New England radio network. General Tire had purchased the Yankee Network in 1943. WNAC-TV first broadcast from the WNAC/Yankee Network's studios at 21 Brookline Avenue, near Fenway Park, before RKO moved its Boston operations to new facilities near Government Center at 40 Hawkins Street‚Äìlater renamed 7 Bulfinch Place‚Äìin 1968. In 1950, General Tire bought the West Coast regional Don Lee Broadcasting System. Two years later, it acquired the Bamberger Broadcasting Service (owners of WOR-AM- FM-TV in New York City) and merged its broadcasting interests into a new division, General Teleradio. General Tire purchased RKO Radio Pictures in 1955 after General Tire found that RKO's film library would be a perfect programming source for WNAC-TV and its other television stations. The studio was merged into General Teleradio to become RKO Teleradio; after the film studio was dissolved, the business was renamed RKO General in 1959. By 1955, ABC began to increase the amount of programming seen as \\"secondary clearances\\" on channel 7, which continued until the original incarnation of WHDH-TV signed on over channel 5 in 1957. However, WNAC-TV was in danger of losing its CBS affiliation that same year when Storer Broadcasting (which had very good relations with CBS) planned to purchase WMUR-TV (channel 9) in nearby Manchester, New Hampshire and move its transmitter to just outside Haverhill, Massachusetts ‚Äì only 20 miles north of Boston; approval of the move would have potentially made WNAC-TV a full-time ABC affiliate and resulted in the aforementioned channel 5 signing on as an independent station, but Storer's purchase of channel 9 never materialized as outcry from New Hampshire viewers led regulators to reject its request to build a new tower near Haverhill; Storer eventually purchased WIHS-TV (channel 38) in 1966 and changed its call letters to WSBK-TV. The station also had a secondary affiliation with the Paramount Television Network; in fact it was one of that company's strongest affiliates, carrying Paramount programs such as Time For Beany, Dixie Showboat, Hollywood Reel, and Armchair Detective. From 1948 to 1950, WNAC-TV shared the rights to Boston Braves game telecasts with WBZ-TV; and shared rights to Boston Red Sox telecasts with WBZ-TV from 1948 to 1954. In the fall of 1948, WNAC-TV became the first station to televise games of the Boston Bruins, carrying the third period (and sometimes the second and third periods) of home games. WNAC-TV was nearly sold by RKO General, along with its radio sisters, to NBC as part of a multi-city transaction and station trade between the two companies announced in March 1960.\\"NBC swap with RKO taking shape.\\" Broadcasting, January 25, 1960, pg. 52.\\"NBC‚ÄìRKO General trades.\\" Broadcasting, March 21, 1960, pg. 52. As a preemptive move, CBS decided to move its Boston affiliation to WHDH-TV when the changeover became official.\\"Boston shuffle.\\" Broadcasting, March 28, 1960, pg. 136. However, final approval of the RKO-NBC deal was held up at the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and the U.S. Department of Justice due to issues involving NBC's ownership of WRCV-AM-TV in Philadelphia, which RKO would acquire in the trade. Meanwhile, WNAC-TV reached an agreement to carry ABC programs in what was thought to be an interim arrangement.\\"Shift of WNAC-TV to ABC may be on interim basis.\\" Broadcasting, November 28, 1960, pg. 57. The affiliation swap between WNAC-TV and WHDH-TV went into effect on January 1, 1961. Ultimately, the RKO-NBC transaction never materialized,\\"Philadelphia circle is complete,\\" and \\"Nine-year history of that trade in Philadelphia.\\" Broadcasting, August 3, 1964, pp. 23-25. and channel 7 would remain an RKO-owned ABC affiliate for the next eleven years.https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.geocities.com/jehobden/tvgene.html&date;=2009-10-26+00:46:16 1960s slide from RKO General In 1969, the Boston Herald-Traveler Corp., WHDH- TV's parent company, lost its license to operate channel 5. Boston Broadcasters, Inc., the owners of the station that replaced it, WCVB-TV, planned to air more local programming than any other station in the country, heavily preempting CBS programming in the process. CBS was not pleased with the prospect of massive preemptions on what would have been its second-largest affiliate and its largest affiliate on the East Coast. The CBS affiliation immediately moved back to channel 7, leaving channel 5 to affiliate with ABC. The second network switch in Boston‚Äìessentially, a reversal of what took place in 1961‚Äìoccurred on March 19, 1972, WCVB-TV's first day of operations; Boston's ABC affiliation remains on channel 5 to this day. However, late in 1973, WNAC-TV adopted a version of the circle 7 logo, similar to that used by ABC's owned-and-operated stations; in 1977, ABC complained that the station was infringing on its trademark, and changed its logo to a Times-Serif-Italic \\"7\\". In late 1981, a stylish, strip-layered \\"7\\" was introduced, which ended up being the last logo redesign under RKO General ownership. Two legendary Boston television personalities had shows on WNAC-TV: Louise Morgan, who hosted a talk show and was known as \\"New England's First Lady of Radio and Television\\", and Ed McDonnell, who as the costumed (as an astronaut) character \\"Major Mudd\\", hosted a popular children's show from 1961 through 1973. =Fight for survival and transition= By 1965, RKO General faced numerous investigations into its business and financial practices. Though the FCC renewed channel 7's license in 1969, RKO General lost the license in 1981 after General Tire admitted to a litany of corporate misconduct ‚Äì which among other things, included the admission that General Tire had committed financial fraud over illegal political contributions and bribes ‚Äì as part of a settlement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. However, in the FCC hearings, RKO General had withheld evidence of General Tire's misconduct and had also failed to disclose evidence of accounting errors on its own part. In light of RKO's dishonesty, the FCC stripped RKO of the Boston license and the licenses for KHJ-TV (now KCAL-TV) in Los Angeles and WOR-TV (now WWOR-TV). The FCC had previously conditioned renewal of the latter two stations' licenses on WNAC- TV's renewal. An appeals court partially reversed the ruling and ordered new hearings for the Los Angeles and New York licenses, finding that the FCC had overreached in connecting them to WNAC-TV's renewal. However, it upheld the revocation of WNAC-TV's license, finding that RKO's dishonesty alone merited the loss of that license. RKO appealed this decision, but in February 1982 the FCC awarded a construction permit for a new channel 7 station to New England Television (NETV), a merger of two of the original rivals to the station's license controlled by Boston grocery magnate David Mugar.\\"The heirs presumptive for Boston ch. 7.\\" Broadcasting, April 26, 1982, pp. 28-29. Two months later in April the U.S. Supreme Court denied its appeal, forcing RKO to surrender the station's license;\\"It's all over for RKO's WNAC-TV.\\" Broadcasting, April 26, 1982, pp. 27-28. RKO then sold the non-license assets of WNAC-TV to NETV. On the evening of May 21, 1982, RKO General‚Äôs final full day of operating WNAC-TV, the station pre-empted CBS‚Äôs primetime schedule to broadcast Game Six of the NBA Eastern Conference Finals, between the Boston Celtics and the Philadelphia 76ers. This was followed by a local public affairs program, the 11:00 pm newscast, and a delayed airing of the CBS drama Nurse. Just after 1:00 am on May 22, following a rebroadcast of the late news, channel 7 signed off for the final time as WNAC-TV. New England Television took over channel 7 at the 5:55 am sign-on that morning, under a new license as WNEV-TV. WNEV-TV acquired WNAC-TV's former studios on Bulfinch Place as well as its transmitter and tower plant in Newton. It also inherited WNAC-TV's CBS affiliation and syndicated program contracts, along with most of its staff. The station has operated since 1990 under the call letters WHDH-TV and was Boston's NBC affiliate from 1995 to 2016 before becoming a news-intensive independent station. WHDH-TV claims WNAC-TV's pre-1982 history as its own (much as WCVB claims its history as its own with the first WHDH as well locally), though it operates under a separate license. Programming =Preempted programming= Over the years, WNAC-TV did not preempt much network programming. This fact greatly appealed to CBS when it decided to abandon the original WHDH-TV (which would return to the air under the callsign WCVB) in 1972 and re-affiliate with WNAC. =Sports programming= WNAC-TV first broadcast the games of the NFL's New England Patriots (known as the Boston Patriots in 1970) from the completion of the AFL/NFL merger (the Patriots were part of the AFL) in 1970 until 1981 thorough CBS' broadcast contract with the NFC; those games were limited to home interconference contests. WNAC also aired Boston Celtics Games from 1973 to 1982 via CBS' broadcast rights to the NBA as well. =News department history= 1948‚Äì1965 WNAC-TV's first newscasts were sponsored by Shawmut Bank and were named Shawmut Bank Newsteller. The title had a double meaning; that of an anchor who told the news, and that of the program being compared to a bank teller making a withdrawal of news and information from a \\"news bank\\", at the public's request (this title was also used on a newscast that Shawmut sponsored on WBZ-TV during this time). This format lasted from WNAC's launch on June 21, 1948, until the early 1950s, when the branding changed to reflect RKO's Yankee Network and its personnel, which also handled news on RKO's radio side. WNAC-TV's relationship with WNAC radio was also touted more starting at this time. From then on through the mid-1960s, the newscasts were known as Yankee Network News. 1965‚Äì1972 By 1967, most of WNAC's in-house productions, including news and public affairs programs, began to be broadcast in color. Several years later, the newscasts' titles were changed to New England Today (for morning and noon newscasts) and New England Tonight (for the 6 and 11 p.m. broadcasts). Reporter John Henning briefly served as the station's lead anchor before leaving for (the original channel 5) WHDH-TV because, as he complained, the station was more interested in feature films than news. In 1970, the station was the first to promote its newscasts with a music package based on a jingle, called \\"Move Closer to Your World\\" (WNAC's slogan at the time was \\"7 Colors Your World\\", later used by Australia's Seven Network). Two years later, WNAC's news director moved to Philadelphia's WPVI- TV and took the theme music with him, where it became iconically associated with that station. Also during this era, a series of anchor teams led the newscasts, including Jim Hale and Howard Nielsen and later Hale and Ken Thomas. The station revamped its anchor desk entirely in 1970, naming Lee Nelson and Chuck Scarborough as the anchor team. After serving in the role from 1970 to 1974, Scarborough moved to WNBC in New York City, where he remains today. 1972‚Äì1982 The New England Today/Tonight format lasted until mid-1972, just months after the switch from ABC to CBS. RKO General then revised the station's on-air image once again to now include the moniker \\"Boston 7\\". The station's newscasts were titled Boston 7 Newsroom from 1972 to 1974 when it was shortened to Newsroom 7. For WNAC's final year on the Channel 7 position (1981‚Äì82), the newscasts were simply named News 7. Despite its links with the Yankee Network's well-respected news department (which came to an end when RKO General closed the network in 1967), WNAC-TV spent most of its first 20 years on the air as a distant third (and a distant second until 1957) in the Boston ratings, behind WBZ-TV. However, the station had begun to be fairly competitive in the early 1970s. For a brief period in 1974, WNAC's 6 p.m. newscast jumped from third place to first. Ted O'Brien, who had replaced Scarborough as the station's primary anchor, remained as lead anchor until being paired with Jay Scott, a young reporter who was hired with a publicity campaign claiming that the news director, on a nationwide talent hunt, had found Scott in a hotel room in Denver, where he had watched television looking for talent. A few years later, John Henning returned to the station from WCVB- TV as Scott's replacement. Henning was joined on WNAC's newscasts by station standbys Eddie Andelman and Dr. Fred Ward and reporters Gary Armstrong, Gayle Sinibaldo, Charlene Mitchell, Tanya Hart, Mike Levine, and Sheila Fox. The station went through several News Directors and Station Managers. The RKO licensing difficulties over the next few years were accompanied by a drop in the ratings. In 1979, the station hired its first female lead anchor, when Mary Richardson was hired to co-anchor the 11 p.m. broadcast. In 1980, Brad Holbrook was added as Henning's new co-anchor. Henning left the station in June 1981 after his four-year contract was up. During the 1970s and early 1980s, the station's news department suffered a number of blunders. During a December 1977 broadcast, anchor Jack Cole stated \\"We'll be back with more alleged news\\" following a report on how to clean a chimney for Santa Claus. On April 1, 1980, the station aired a news report that stated that Great Blue Hill in Milton, Massachusetts was erupting. The story was an April Fools' joke, but the prank resulted in panic in Milton. The station's image was also tarnished by the arrests of reporter Charlene Mitchell for shoplifting and sports reporter Bob Gamere for drunk driving, as well as the revelation that former reporter Stephen Guptill falsely claimed two degrees on his resume. In the year leading up to RKO's sale of channel 7's assets to David Mugar after losing its licensing appeal, the station hired Susan Brady to co-anchor with Brad Holbrook. The changes did not cease during WNAC's remaining months. After RKO's loss of the WNAC license in 1980 was upheld by the Federal Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, Brady left for a position in Los Angeles. She was quickly replaced by young weekend anchor Susan Burke, who worked with Holbrook both during the transition from RKO to New England Television and for the first months of the new ownership. =News/station presentation= =Newscast titles= *Shawmut Bank Newsteller (1948‚Äì1949) *Yankee News Service (1949‚Äì1959) *TV-7 News (1959‚Äì1964) *The Boston 7 Report (1964‚Äì1967) *New England Today/New England Tonight (1967‚Äì1972) *Boston 7 Newsroom (1972‚àí1974) *Newsroom 7 (1974‚Äì1981) *News 7 (1981‚Äì1982) Station slogans *\\"We're With You!\\" (1981‚Äì1982) Notable former on-air staff * Robin Hemingway ‚Äì talk show host, line producer \\"One More Time\\" ‚Äì public affairs programming (1970‚Äì1971) * Eddie Andelman ‚Äì sports critic at large (1974‚Äì1979) * Paul Benzaquin ‚Äì talk show host (1969‚Äì1975; deceased) * David Brudnoy ‚Äì commentator (1973‚Äì1982; deceased) * John Dennis ‚Äì longtime sports anchor (1977‚Äì1982, now at WEEI-FM) * Bob Gamere ‚Äì sports anchor and host of Candlepins for Cash (1975‚Äì1982) * Bob Gallagher ‚Äì sports anchor * Stephen Guptill ‚Äì elderly affairs reporter, The Elder American host (1975‚Äì1978; later served as Massachusetts Secretary of Elder Affairs) * John Henning ‚Äì anchor (1964‚Äì1968, 1977‚Äì1981; deceased) * Harvey Leonard ‚Äì chief meteorologist (1977‚Äì1982, now at WCVB-TV) * Ed McDonnell ‚Äì portrayed \\"Major Mudd\\" (1961‚Äì1973; deceased) * Louise Morgan ‚Äì women's show host (1949‚Äì1960; deceased) * Lee Nelson ‚Äì anchor (1972‚Äì1975) moved to WGBH ‚Äì died in 1980 * Chuck Scarborough ‚Äì anchor (1972‚Äì1974; now at WNBC in New York City) * Mike Taibbi ‚Äì investigative reporter (1977‚Äì1982; now at NBC News) * Gus Saunders ‚Äì weather ‚Äì (deceased) * Jacqui Adams ‚Äì anchor * Gayle Sinibaldo ‚Äì reporter and anchor (1976‚Äì1979, now retired) * Gary Armstrong ‚Äì reporter * Howard Nielsen ‚Äì reporter * Tanya Hart ‚Äì reporter * Sheila Fox ‚Äì reporter and noon anchor * Mike Levine ‚Äì reporter References *Gallant, Joseph.

It was produced by Crystal Creek Media and directed by Daniel Knudsen. Filming of Creed of Gold took place in several locations near Indianapolis, Indiana and Detroit, Michigan with some additional photography taking place on location in New York City.  Plot  Creed of Gold begins with a flashback during the Bolshevik revolution in Russia. A reporter hides a list with names of powerful bankers who financed the revolution. The list is discovered seventy years later by a Russian history professor. The professor's son Adam eventually inherits the list and begins to research the names on it. Adam Smith is an incoming freshman at a fictional American school called Havenhurst University. In his Money & Banking class he is assigned to work on a term paper with Kirsten Stanford. Kirsten is a wealthy girl from upstate New York and her father is on the board of governors of the Federal Reserve. The two do not see eye to eye but eventually work things out and begin researching together. Their work is being thwarted by a greedy Federal Reserve board member named Stuart Wornwall. Wornwall is secretly stealing money from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York by programing the computer system to misappropriate funds every time the Federal Reserve buys and sells bonds from the US Government. Adam and Kirsten uncover Wornwall's family history through the list. This discovery links Wornwall's family fortune back to the offenses committed during the Bolshevik revolution. The film was released August 12, 2014.  Cast  * Taylor Lindsey as Adam Smith * Ellen Lawrence as Kirsten Stanford * Nicholas Willeke as Cody Williams * Vanessa Ewing as Jenell Slone * Alexander Ganahl as Byron Tackitt * William Greene as Stuart Wornwall * Dr. Jay L. Wile as Gerald Steinberg * Sehul Viras as Wornwall's Hitman  Production  Principal photography began June 10, 2010 and ended July 12, 2010. Various locations near Indianapolis, Indiana were used for filming, including the Indiana World War Memorial Plaza, Taylor University, the Columbia Club and the Indianapolis Union Station. The Indiana State House doubled as the interior of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. The film took three years to complete and secure international distribution. The movie trailer was released by Crystal Creek Media on June 29, 2012.  Themes  The main theme is that certain actions may escape the boundaries of International law but they are still wrong because they are a violation of Natural law. Ron Paul's campaign advisor Doug Wead has a special feature on the DVD about what is going on with the Federal Reserve and its impact on American citizens and the rest of the world. Though the film deals with complex topics it was awarded the Dove seal of family approval from the Dove Foundation.  Release  Creed of Gold premiered in Indianapolis, Indiana and was released August 12, 2014.  Awards  The film was nominated for an Adam Award for best feature drama at the Sabaoth International Film Festival in Milan, Italy and won a Redemptive Storyteller Award at the Redemptive Film Festival.

It was developed by the European Offshore Wind Deployment Centre consortium. The scheme consists of 11 wind turbines with an installed capacity of 93.2 megawatts. It is located between Blackdog and Bridge of Don near Aberdeen. First power was generated in July 2018, with full commissioning following in September 2018. Planning The wind farm was initially proposed by the Aberdeen Renewable Energy Group (AREG) in 2003. The original plan was for 20 two-megawatt turbines in an eight kilometres long row about 1 kilometre offshore. A geological survey of Aberdeen Bay was begun in 2007, and a grant of 40 million euros was offered by the European Commission in 2009. The proposal at that stage was for a maximum of 23 turbines. A planning application was lodged in August 2011. The application was submitted by Aberdeen Renewable Energy Group (AREG) in cooperation with two other companies, Vattenfall and Technip. The proposal was for 11 turbines. Planning consent was granted by the Scottish government in March 2013. In May 2013 Vattenfall announced plans to reduce its stake in the project. In October 2013 Aberdeenshire councillors rejected a planning application to build an electricity substation. In December 2013 it was announced that construction would be delayed for two years, with connection of the grid occurring in 2017. In January 2014 an appeal against the substation vote was lodged. The developers won the appeal in July 2014. Vattenfall decided to proceed with the 92 MW wind farm in July 2016.https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-north-east- orkney-shetland-36854835 The plan was for 11 turbines each of 8 MW placed 3 km from land, with a contract for the assembly of suction bucket foundations for the turbines contracted out to Smulders Projects UK. Objections American billionaire Donald Trump purchased a large part of the Menie estate near the village of Balmedie in 2006. He proposed to build a golf course, with a hotel, holiday homes and a residential village. He expressed his concerns about the wind farm in April 2006 stating that \\"I want to see the ocean, I do not want to see windmills.\\" In 2006 RSPB Scotland expressed concern about the effect both the wind farm and Donald Trump's golf course would have on the wildlife on the Aberdeenshire coast. In 2011 the RSPB called for \\"more planning, research and monitoring ... to ensure we truly understand the impact this site may have on local birds.\\" In September 2011 the Trump Organization filed an objection to the planning application. By 2012 the RSPB dropped its opposition to the wind farm following the reduction in the number of turbines and a change in the layout.\\" In May 2013 Trump launched a legal challenge against the Scottish government's decision to grant planning permission for the wind farm. The hearing began at the Court of Session in November 2013, but was rejected in February 2014. An appeal against the decision was heard at the Court of Session in January 2015, but Trump lost the appeal in June 2015. After the decision Trump said he would appeal before both the Supreme Court of the UK and the European Courts. Trump's appeal was unanimously dismissed by the UK Supreme Court in December 2015.Trump International Golf Club Scotland Limited v The Scottish Ministers [2015] UKSC 74 Construction  The wind farm under construction in 2018, as seen from Bridge of Don Connection work began in early 2017. The turbines are mounted on unusual suction bucket foundations. The sea cables are 66kV. There are more than four miles of high voltage underground cable between the substation in Dyce (on the outskirts of Aberdeen) and the wind farm's onshore substation at Blackdog. The first foundation was installed offshore in March 2018, and the first turbine was installed in April. The eleventh and final turbine was erected near the end of May. First power was generated in July 2018, with full commissioning following in September 2018.

The formation was known to preserve fossils of Plateosaurus sp. in the Norwegian offshore (Snorre Field well 34/4-9S), dating back to the Rhaetian period. The formation comprises dry floodplain; paleosol/pedogenic, concretionary, brown, red, calcareous mudstones.Snorre Field well 34/4-9S at Fossilworks.org  Description  The Lunde Formation occurs in the northern part of a Late Triassic continental basin that covered most of the present North Sea area. Several thousands of meters of fluvial sediments were deposited in this basin during a thermal subsidence phase following Late Permian to Early Triassic rifting. With an approximate width of between present mainland Norway and the Shetland Platform, the continental post-rift basin contains the Teist, Lomvi and Lunde Formations, and lasted throughout the Triassic until the final depositional stages of the overlying latest Triassic to Early Jurassic Statfjord Formation, when the whole area was flooded during a marine transgression from the north and south in late Sinemurian to early Pliensbachian times. The climate during deposition of the Lunde Formation was semiarid and highly seasonal, typical for the contemporary palaeogeographic position at 40-50 degrees North paleolatitude. The basin was linked to a marine borealic seaway, probably located some tens to hundreds of kilometers to the north and to provenance areas composed of Archean gneisses, Caledonian metamorphic rocks and Devonian sandstones. These sources located on the Shetland Platform and in the southwestern area of Norway and deposited into a vast alluvial plain in the Triassic of what is now the North Sea.Hurum et al., 2006, p.117 The bone slice of Plateosaurus was discovered during the description of a core retrieved in February 1997 from well 34/4-9S in the north-western part of the Snorre Field. It occurs in a reddish-brown, mudstone interval referred to as the upper member of the Lunde Formation. The mudstone is composed of dominantly compound and cumulative paleosols that formed in distal to fluvial channels in a floodplain forming the uppermost part of the upper member of the Lunde Formation. The paleosols are characterized by carbonate nodules, pedogenic mud aggregates and slickensides, mottling, root traces and mud cracks. The paleosol type is similar to modern vertisols forming in semi-arid areas with seasonal precipitation, commonly with dry periods lasting 4-8 months. The presence of root traces suggests that the floodplain was covered with small trees and bushes, vegetation suitable for herbivorous animals living on the alluvial plain. Beds containing the bone specimen belong to the younger of two palynomorph assemblages containing the spore Kreuselisporites reissingeri thought to indicate an early Rhaetian rather than a Norian age, corresponding approximately to an age of 203-202 Ma according to the time scale of Gradstein et al.

He was born in √Ömot as a son of forest owner Hans Tollefsen Kilde (1822‚Äì1882) and Oline Grini (1827‚Äì1871). He attended Sagatun Folk High School, the Norwegian College of Agriculture and the Forestry Academy in Tharandt. In 1878 he took over the family farm, Kilde. It fell out of use in 1927 because of economic problems, but was inherited by his son in 1938. He was married twice; first from 1880 to Pauline Iversdatter Arnestad (1858‚Äì1917), but the marriage was dissolved; then from November 1903 to Hanna Fredrikke Hansdatter Arnestad (1877‚Äì1955). Kilde was an active politician. Locally he was a member of √Ömot municipal council from 1881 to 1925, serving as mayor from 1890 to 1893 and 1905 to 1910. For the Liberal Party, he was a deputy representative to the Parliament of Norway during the term 1891‚Äì1894. In the 1909 election he was fielded as the Liberal candidate in the single-member constituency S√∏ndre √òsterdalen, but ended a distant fourth behind the Labour Democrat, Liberal Left and Conservative candidates. He later joined the Liberal Left Party, and in the 1921 election he was a minor ballot candidate for the Norwegian Agrarian Association, which had now entered politics (from 1922 as the Agrarian Party). Kilde had chaired Hedemark Agrarian Association, and served as deputy chairman of the Norwegian Agrarian Association, already from 1905 to 1907. He was a central board member from 1904 to 1908 and 1913 to 1934. Kilde's main endeavor was to develop √òsterdalen in general, and Rena in particular. He was a financial, political and administrative contributor to the foundations of Osfallet Power Plant, Rena Kartonfabrik and Rena Tr√¶sliperi to continue local hydroelectricity and refinery of the region's rich forest resources; two bridges over the local rivers Glomma and Rena (1890); and the inclusion of a Rena Station in the Norwegian railway network. He also contributed to the foundation of the school in Rena, which is now a campus of Hedmark University College, the fire insurance company Aamot Brandkasse and the local co-op. A failed endeavor, however, was the construction of a channel in Glomma, all the way from Nedre Glomma to Storsj√∏en. √òsterdalen would be \\"the furute Canada\\", wrote Kilde, if the plan were to come to reality. A separate Trysil Line on the railway network was never materialized either. Kilde was decorated as a Knight, First Class of the Order of St. Olav in 1897, received the Medal for Outstanding Civic Service in silver in 1933 and the Norwegian Agrarian Association honorary medal. The main street in Rena is named after him, and a bauta has also been erected in the town.
