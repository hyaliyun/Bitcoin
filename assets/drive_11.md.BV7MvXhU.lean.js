Technology overview Video Synopsis combines a visual summary of stored video together with an indexing mechanism. When a summary is required, all objects from the target period are collected and shifted in time to create a much shorter synopsis video showing maximum activity. A synopsis video clip is generated, in real time, in which objects and activities that originally occurred in different times are displayed simultaneously.Y. Pritch, A. Rav-Acha, and S. Peleg, Nonchronological Video Synopsis and Indexing, IEEE Trans. PAMI, Vol 30, No 11, Nov. 2008, pp. 1971-1984. (See Figure 1 - Screen shots: Before and after Video Synopsis). The process begins by detecting and tracking objects of interest. Each object is represented as a tube in space-time of all video frames. Objects are detected and stored in a database in approximately real time. Following a request to summarize a time period, all objects from the desired time are extracted from the database, and indexed to create a much shorter summary video containing maximum activity. (See Figure 2 - Tube packing). Real time rendering is used to generate the summary video after object re-timing. This allows end-user control over object/event density.

Located on margins of River Homem and Ribeira do Eido, in 1972, it was intentionally submerged by the Portuguese State during the course of filling of a reservoir of the same name. Although still legally held by the former-villages, the lands are inundated, and only visible during the dry season, when it emerges, becoming a tourist attraction. History Oral tradition suggests that the village was founded within the 1st century (c.70), during the Visigothic settlement of the region, a time when the nearby Roman road (Via Nova XVIII) was extended. According to this history, seven men settled present-day Portela do Campo, but following a dispute, four decided to settle downstream of the Rio Homem, establishing Vilarinho da Furna. Little evidence exists to support this story, although there are several Roman roads and bridges within the region, including two roads to the south and three bridges (one within the village that crosses the Ribeira do Eido, one upstream (the Ponta Nova) and one downstream (Ponte do Cou√ßo). Little is known about its status during the Roman occupation, although it was first referenced in 1623, in the church register of baptisms. A German who visited Vilarinho da Furna in the final years of the 18th century noted that the houses were comparable to other peasants in the region. However, his large, host family lived comfortably; in contrast to many other places, they had no shortage of food, and their beds were clean and made-up with white linens. He suggested that many German peasants would envy how well-off they were (Link, 1803 mentioned in Cleto, 2001). Flood Planning for a reservoir and dam began in the 1950s, with surveys and test drilling. Construction started in 1967. At this time, the village had almost 300 inhabitants in 57 families spread over 80 houses. The exodus started in September 1969, when the then-Companhia Portuguesa de Electricidade (Portuguese Electricity Company) started to pay out the indemnity fees to the villages residents. The villagers received a total of 20,741,607 escudos: excluding houses and other structures, the land itself was valued by HICA - Companhia Hidroel√©ctrica do Cavado (Cavado Hydroelectric Company) at .5 escudos , equivalent to the price of half a sardine. When including all structures, the compesation was equivalent to 5 escudos , which was less than the cost that HICA incurred to build houses for its workers. In October 1970, notices were posted throughout the village stating that the reservoir would be filled. Before the dam was built, all roads leading to the village were constructed by the villagers. The dam construction company attempted to build a new road to evacuate the villagers, but this attempt failed. In the end, the villagers had to construct a new road to allow them to take their belongings by truck from the village. Residents tried to bring away as much of their belongings as possible (even the roof tiles); only the bare walls of most of the houses were left behind. The last inhabitant left in 1971, and the village was submerged the following year. The reservoir covers an area of approximately , with a useful reservoir capacity of , as well as a maximum power capacity of 125 MW.EDP Annual Sustainability Report 2003 Aftermath In 1981, the municipality of Terras de Bouro built an Ethnographic museum in S√£o Jo√£o do Campo that commemorates the history of Vilarinho da Furna. The collection includes clothes, agricultural tools, and paintings depicting daily life in the village. The museum was built with stones from two houses of the old village. It was opened by Prime Minister An√≠bal Cavaco Silva on 14 May 1989. In 2008, Terras de Bouro launched the project Valoriza√ß√£o do Espa√ßo Natural da Serra da Amarela (Serra da Amarela Natural Space Appreciation), based on the Parque Natural de Vilarinho da Furna (Nature Park of Vilarinho da Furna) that includes an underwater museum, a glass-bottom boat and wharf, a wildlife observation post, two mountain shelters, water and solar energy installations to provide energy for the park, beehives, a campsite and a bike path, as well as the re-reconstruction of the old bridge at Cou√ßo and the watermills in the area. The project was approved in July 2008 and funded 1.2 million euros budget over a period of 2 years, although it is estimated that another 2-3 million Euros would be needed to cover the expenses of the buildings and access roads. The municipalities of Terras de Bouro and Ponte da Barca also jointly developed a hiking route along Serra da Amarela that crossed Ch√£ da Fonte, Casa da Neve, Branca de Bilhares, Entre-ambos-os-Rios, Germil, Brufe, Casarotas, Fojo do Lobos and back to Vilarinho da Furna.Ant√≥nio Silva, Valoriza√ß√£o de Vilarinho conclu√≠da dentro de um ano, Di√°rio de Minho, 2008-12-21 In October 1985, the former villagers created the Associa√ß√£o dos Antigos Habitantes de Vilarinho da Furna (Association of Former-Inhabitants of Vilarinho da Furna) to defend and promote the cultural, collective and communitarian heritage of the people of the old village. Some of its goals, such as the reforestation of the old lands, the creation of animal reserve, the development of an underwater museum and tourist activities, have been realized by the organization. Geography Vilarinho da Furna was situated in the southern slopes of Serra Amarela, providing the village with both good solar exposure and protection from the northerly winds from the higher mountains. Local springs did not dry out during the summers and fertile soils were located in upstream locations whose sediments were deposited during regular floods. The Ribeira da Furna fed the community spring, while levadas provide water through a controlled system of sluice gates, that allow channeled the water supply to village and cattle, as well as field irrigation below the village. The trees in the small valleys provided shade for them in the hot months of late summer. Pasturelands on hilltop, at most above sea level, are predominantly sparse, with poor soils and exposed outcrops. Only a small portion of land in the lower, gentle slopes were suitable for hay and foraging cattle. These circumstance provided the ideal conditions for a diverse local agriculture, supporting the cultivation of maize on small plots (or gardens) interspersed with small vineyards (to make vinho verde, the typical wine of the Minho region). Many of the villagers kept domesticated animals (chickens, cows, pigs, sheep and goats). In order to avoid occupying arable land, the houses in the village were constructed side- by-side, thereby defining inter-community streets, alleys and the common spaces (including the alpendoradas, in which the Junta gathered). Due to the lack of space within the village, many of the houses overhung the streets. The lands belonging to Vilarinho da Furna encompass an area of approximately . In 1895, after a dispute with the Servi√ßos Florestais (Forest Services) much of the land became the shared private property of those descendants of the villagers who had signed a contract, ending the dispute. Culture Had the village not been submerged by the reservoir, it might have been completely forgotten. The construction of the dam made scientists take notice of the village and its communitarian social system, which was uncommon in the 20th century, but which in remote times was found throughout Europe. The village had a council, called the Junta, with a member for each family. This is believed to be a practice dating back to the Visigoths, with their conventus publicus vicinorum (public assembly of neighbours). The Junta's leader (Zelador, or Ju√≠z) was chosen from among the married men, and sat for a term of six months together with its legislative chamber (Os Seis). At the beginning of each term all voters one by one went into a room with the new Zelador and gave him a note with name of six of the neighbours to elect the new \\"Os Seis\\". In a tradition that was abandoned already when Jorge Dias was around the old Zelador would give the new Zelador a whip upon which the new would swear an oath on the Santos Evangelhos.Jorge Dias. Vilarinho da Furna: Uma Aldeia Comunit√°ria. Imprensa Nacional Casa da Moeda. Vila da Maia, 1983 (In Portuguese) Facsimile of the book released in 1948 The council discussed and made decisions concerning many aspects of village life, discussing some matters in great detail. This discussion at the council made Vilarinho da Furna a participatory democracy based on its consuetudinary laws. Matters discussed by the Junta included preparing new routes and repairing existing ones; organising the pastoral duties, including the herding of the cattle; irrigating the fields; cutting wood and clearing forests; trapping wolves; and harvesting grapes. In essence, the Junta was charged with making sure that nothing went undone in this largely self-sustaining community. In the last years of the village's existence, the Junta also devoted itself to devising strategies to fight its final enemy, the company that constructed the dam. The Junta also judged and punished any crimes; thus the leader was referred to as the Judge (juiz). Absence from meetings of the Junta was punished: slight delays were fined; for absences, the offender owed the village one day of community work. The most severe punishment for any transgression within the community was to be excluded from it (botar fora do vizinho). The offender would not receive any help within the scope of the communitarian lifestyle, so no one else would herd his cattle; and he would be denied access to the communal land. In essence, this meant exile from the village. The village's economy was based on cattle. In 1968, the herd consisted of over 1600 head, not counting calves born in that year. At the end of World War II, the count was almost 1000 head higher, as a result of the high price of domestically- produced meat. Little beef or butter was found on the village's tables, and milk was only taken after calving; the focus was on feeding cattle for sale. Cattle were generally pastured in the lower lands; goats were kept up on the hills. The cow pastures were divided by stone fences to avoid mixing the animals, in particular to separate the castrated cattle from the bulls to avoid upsetting the latter. The villagers took turns herding, so that everyone had to spend time away from the village. A herder was fined if it was determined that an animal had been killed or had disappeared through his fault or negligence. Villagers in the fields prepared supper for those who watched the herds. The mountains around the village, especially Serra da Amarela, have a number of small huts (casarotas) as temporary lodging for the herders. Every spring the villagers went out to mend the stone fence that defined the outer perimeter of the land (termo).

Initially coined by Gideon Rose in a 1998 World Politics review article, it is a combination of classical realist and neorealist - particularly defensive realist - theories. Neoclassical realism holds that the actions of a state in the international system can be explained by intervening systemic variables - such as the distribution of power capabilities among states - as well as cognitive variables - such as the perception and misperception of systemic pressures, other states' intentions, or threats - and domestic variables - such as state institutions, elites, and societal actors within society - affecting the power and freedom of action of the decision-makers in foreign policy.  Overview  While holding true to the realist concept of balance of power, neoclassical realism further adds that states' mistrust and inability to perceive one another accurately, or state leaders' inability to mobilize state power and public support can result in an underexpansion or underbalancing behaviour leading to imbalances within the international system, the rise and fall of great powers, and war: * Appropriate balancing occurs when a state correctly perceives another state's intentions and balances accordingly. * Inappropriate balancing or overbalancing occurs when a state incorrectly perceives another state as threatening, and uses more resources than it needs to in order to balance. This causes an imbalance. * Underbalancing occurs when a state fails to balance, out of either inefficiency or incorrectly perceiving a state as less of threat than it actually is. This causes an imbalance. * Nonbalancing occurs when a state avoids balancing through buck passing, bandwagoning, or other escapes. A state may choose to do this for a number of reasons, including an inability to balance. According to one review study, Neoclassical realism has primarily been criticized for its \\"apparent ontological and epistemological incoherence\\". A 1995 study criticized Neoclassical realism for encompassing \\"nearly the entire universe of international relations theory\\" and stretching realism \\"beyond all recognition or utility.\\" According to Steven Walt of the Kennedy School at Harvard University, one of the chief flaws in Neoclassical realism is that it \\"tends to incorporate domestic variables in an ad hoc manner, and its proponents have yet to identify when these variables have greater or lesser influence\\". Neoclassical realism has been used to explain a number of puzzling foreign policy cases, such as the volatility in South Korea-Japan relations, Fascist Italy's foreign policy, Slobodan Milosevic's decision-making during the 1999 Kosovo crisis, the occurrence of the Cod Wars between Iceland and the United Kingdom, and Iran's foreign policy choices after the American invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq. Proponents of the theory argue that the theory is particularly valuable in explaining cases that fly in the face of other international relations theories, due to its incorporation of domestic variables.

Members include architecture and design firms, building product manufacturers, service providers, and forward-thinking AEC firms of all sizes that take an active interest in their future. History In 1993-94, at the Smithsonian Castle on the East Coast and at the Salk Institute on the West Coast, a network of regional and national design firms began sharing ideas, benchmarks, and proprietary financial analysis with each another. They brought successful practice strategies into dialogue with the world of client demands, budgets, innovation, technology, and communications. These architects, designers, and thought leaders were seeking to build better futures for their firms in their roles as partners, leaders, and futurists. James P. Cramer, Hon. AIA, Hon. IIDA, Chairman & CEO of Greenway Group, a Washington, D.C.-based management consulting firm, facilitated the sharing of ideas and experiences within this network. A newsletter with information about profitability, tax considerations, business measures, and capital expenditure decisions was circulated as a result. In the beginning, the group had no name but talked about in industry circles, with references to ‚Äúthat design futures network.‚Äù During this time, Greenway Consulting was working with other clients allied to the design professions who became enthusiastic about supporting the network. Those clients included Cecil Steward of the University of Nebraska, Doug Parker of Steelcase, Jonas Salk of the Salk Institute, Jerry Hobbs and Paul Curran of BPI/VNU Communications, and Arol Wolford of CMD. In addition, principal leaders from Gensler; Skidmore, Owings and Merrill; Hammel, Green and Abrahamson; Perkins and Will; CommArts; and two dozen other firms provided leadership vision and energy. The network held meetings in La Jolla, Calif., Washington, D.C., and New York City, solidifying the concept of expanding the group and making the proprietary information available to a broader audience. Greenway Consulting proposed to BPI/VNU Communications that this information- sharing bulletin be published for a subscription fee and be named DesignIntelligence. The first issue was published on May 15, 1995. Shortly thereafter, this leadership network officially became the Design Futures Council. They met in the offices of Greenway Consulting in Washington, D.C., and in meeting rooms at the Smithsonian Institution‚Äôs Castle. Invitations for programs and sharing of ideas came from the American Institute of Architects, the American Consulting Engineers Council, the Industrial Designers Society of America, the Aga Khan Trust for Culture, the World Future Society, the International Interior Design Association, the American Society of Interior Designers, the Design-Build Institute, the Design Management Institute, and many colleges and universities. Notable Senior Fellows Fellowship in the Design Futures Council is granted to outstanding individuals who have provided noteworthy leadership toward the advancement of design, design solutions, or the design professions. Senior fellows of the DFC are recognized for significant contributions toward the understanding of changing trends, new research, or applied knowledge leading to innovative design models that improve the built environment and the human condition.

Cleckley's The Mask of Sanity, and Robert D. Hare's Hare Psychopathy Checklist.Hare, Robert D. (1991). \\"The Hare Psychopathy Checklist\\" (Revised). (North Tonawanda, NY: Multi-Health Systems) Associated expressions are \\"charm offensive\\", \\"turning on the charm\\" and \\"superficial smile\\".  Early history  Classical rhetoric had early singled out the critical category of the superficial charmer, whose merit was purely verbal, without underlying substance.  Psychopathic charm  Contemporary interest in superficial charm goes back to Hervey M. Cleckley's classic study (1941) of the sociopath: since his work it has become widely accepted that the sociopath/psychopath was characterised by superficial charm and a disregard for other people's feelings. According to Hare, \\"Psychopathic charm is not in the least shy, self-conscious, or afraid to say anything.\\" Subsequent studies have refined, but not perhaps fundamentally altered, Cleckley's initial assessment. In the latest diagnostic review, Cleckley's mix of intelligence and superficial charm has been redefined to reflect a more deviant demeanour, talkative, slick, and insincere. A distinction can also be drawn between a subtle, self-effacing kind of sociopathic charm, and a more expansive, exhilarating spontaneity which serves to give the sociopath a sort of animal magnetism.Jon Ronson, The Psychopath Test (2011) p. 143.Martha Stout, The Sociopath Next Door (2005) pp. 88‚Äì89.  Workplace  The authors of the book Snakes in Suits: When Psychopaths Go to Work describe a five phase model of how a typical workplace psychopath climbs to and maintains power. In phase one (entry), the psychopath will use highly developed social skills and charm to obtain employment by an organisation.Baibak, P; Hare, R. D Snakes in Suits: When Psychopaths Go to Work (2007) Corporate psychopaths within organizations may be singled out for rapid promotion because of their polish, charm, and cool decisiveness.Boddy, C. R The Corporate Psychopaths Theory of the Global Financial Crisis Journal of Business Ethics August 2011, Volume 102, Issue 2, pp 255-259 Their superficial charm may be misinterpreted as charisma.https://leb.fbi.gov/2012/november/the-corporate-psychopath  Narcissism  The term also occurs in Hotchkiss' discussion of narcissists: \\"Their superficial charm can be enchanting.\\" For such figures, however, there is no substance behind the romantic gestures, which only serve to feed the narcissist's own ego. Narcissists are known as manipulative in a charming way, entrapping their victims through a fa√ßade of understanding into suspending their self-protective behaviour and lowering their personal boundaries. Closely related is the way impostors are able to make people fall in love with them to satisfy their narcissistic needs, without reciprocating in any real sense or returning their feelings.  Social chameleons  Social chameleons have been described as adept in social intelligence, able to make a charming good impression, yet at the price of their own true motivations.Daniel Goleman, Emotional Intelligence (London 1996) pp. 118‚Äì119. Their ability to manage impressions well often leads to success in areas like the theatre, salesmanship, or politics and diplomacy.Goleman, p. 120. But when lacking a sense of their own inner needs, such superficial extraverts may end up (despite their charm) as rootless chameleons, endlessly taking their social cues from other people.Goleman, pp. 119‚Äì120. Similarly, for the histrionic personality, the attention seeking through superficial charm may only reinforce the splitting of the real self from the public presentation in a vicious circle.Len Sperry, Handbook of diagnosis and treatment of DSM-IV-TR personality disorder (2003) p. 138.  Positive outcomes  Superficial charmers, in their more benign manifestations, can produce a variety of positive results, their conversational skills providing light-hearted entertainment in social settings through their ability to please.Salekin, p. 414.  Charm offensive  A \\"charm offensive\\" is a related concept meaning a publicity campaign, usually by politicians, that attempts to attract supporters by emphasizing their charisma or trustworthiness. The first recorded use of the expression is in the New York newspaper Elmira Advertiser on July 1, 1955.https://www.newspapers.com/clip/42147872/  Literary analogues  F. Scott Fitzgerald explored the destructive consequences of excess charm in stories like \\"Magnetism\\", maintaining that charm, for those who had it, had a life of its own, demanding constant use to keep it in peak condition.F. Scott Fitzgerald, Bernice Bobs Her Hair and other stories (Penguin 1968) p. 149. Criticism Critics object that there are few objective criteria whereby to distinguish superficial from genuine charm, and that as part of the conventional niceties of politeness, we all regularly employ superficial charm in everyday life,S. J. Pfohl, Images of Deviance and Social Control (1985) p. 103. conveying superficial solidarity and fictitious benevolence to all social interactions.Steven Pinker, The Stuff of Thought (2007) pp. 480‚Äì481.

Starting her career in the 1970s as a fine artist and super realist painter, her life-size airbrush paintings of slaughtered whales in Northern Canada are featured in the collections of the National Gallery of Canada and Art Bank. Her first show \\"Oceans of Blood\\" was exhibited at the Isaac's Gallery in Toronto, Ontario. By depicting the giant creatures with innocence and beauty, and presenting the slaughter in a way that was at once shocking but also stylized and aesthetically compelling, she enticed audiences to look and to grapple with the issue of animal rights amidst the controversy of the seal hunts. After living in the arctic to be near the mythical creatures she depicted in the paintings, Berman created the performance art piece \\"The Rites of Nuliajuk,\\" which marked the beginning of her crossover from fine artist to musician. Collaborating with her partner Douglas Pringle and their production company Peak Productions, Berman started composing music and creating the on- stage persona of Michaele Jordana. With her band, The Poles, Jordana became a beacon in the new wave movement, and blazed a trail for female musicians in Canada. With their hit single \\"CN Tower\\", The Poles won the first U-Know Award, were nominated for a Juno, and were regulars at legendary punk venues including Max's Kansas City, the El Mocambo and CBGB, where they played alongside Devo and the Ramones. Always a champion for those who could not speak for themselves, in the 1980s Jordana Berman directed and produced the award winning documentaries \\"Moving with the Light\\" and \\"Face to Face\\" which pioneered assistive technologies, as Jordana enabled down syndrome youth to communicate through the introduction of art, light and colored gels, and later arming them with video cameras to go out in the world and shatter stereotypes. Jordana took a hiatus from the world of new wave music to have a child, Ramona Pringle, and went on to integrate fine art and music in her future works as a multiplatform artist. Her stage show Storming Heaven, a rock opera which cast a dystopian glance at the realities of animal testing, played to sold out audiences at the DuMaurier Center in Toronto and toured to the United States. In the mid-1990s, Jordana started applying her photorealistic touch to digital art and design, and together with Pringle started integrating new media platforms into their work, producing music art and video for the web. By 2000, Peak Productions had evolved into the Peak Media Collective, a collective of artists, filmmakers, engineers and other creative minds, working independently and collaborating on large scale public installations such as The Media Tree at Casino Niagara and Winter Sky, a video fresco at Sherway Gardens, in Toronto. Jordana continues to work at the helm of the Peak Collective, as the creative director on multiplatform projects, integrating her specialization in different creative fields. As an art educator, she has taught courses in visual art, video production, media and design, and game design throughout her career at institutions including the art schools of York University, the University of Guelph and the University of Ontario Institute of Technology, where she developed and taught drawing for animators and gameworlds for game designers. Most recently, Michaele has been professor and coordinator of the program in digital animation and game design and development at Centennial College's Centre for Creative Communication.

With more than visitors in 2007, it is the most visited site in Loiret. . Comit√© d√©partemental du tourisme du Loiret, 2008. The source of the Loiret river is at the centre of the park. The park has been awarded the status of Jardin remarquable by the French Ministry of Culture and the national council of parks and gardens. Geography The Parc Floral de la Source extends over .Le parc floral de la Source, une invitation √† la r√™verie. Conseil g√©n√©ral du Loiret, 18 July 2003. It uses the natural contours of the site and consists of open spaces where the flora, fauna and minerals are juxtaposed. Its unique geographical position, between the wooded region of Sologne and the plains of the Loire Valley, gives it a particular relief. At its centre, after an underground course of several miles, is the Bouillon: the resurgence of the Loiret river. With the passing seasons, successive flowering continually renews the appearance of the grounds. History In 510, the land was ceded to the monks of the Abbey Saint-Mesmin de Micy by Clovis. From 1427, it belonged successively to various lords and noble families. The first great gardening work, in the formal style of French gardens, dates from the beginning of the 18th century. During the 1720s, an ice-house, a library gallery, bas-reliefs and a terrace were incorporated into the garden. In 1959, the city of Orl√©ans and the d√©partement acquired the 410 hectares of the estate; 35 hectares were reserved to create the park, the rest being used to create the quarter of La Source as a site for the University of Orl√©ans. The garden opened in 1964 as a recreational park as well as a showcase for the horticultural department. Organisation of the park The Parc Floral consists of two main parts: the plateau de Sologne and the plaine du Val de Loire. Plateau de Sologne The plateau is covered by a semi-natural forest of hornbeams and oaks. It is joined to the plain by a hillside which corresponds to a former fluvial terrace of the Loire. Located on the plateau are animal enclosures for a variety of species, including alpaca and Ouessant sheep. La plaine du Val de Loire The plain of the Loire valley is given over to floral and horticultural works. It includes the iris garden, the Miroir rose garden, the valley of perennials, the garden of the Source, the exotic butterfly glasshouse, the kitchen garden and the dahlia garden. Aviaries exhibit birds from several continents. This area also includes the source of Loiret. The gardens and its collections The park has several gardens including collections of ferns and rhododendrons, a rose garden, tropical gardens, rockery and flowering grasses. The iris garden collection includes about 900 varieties, classified since 1996 as a specialist national collection. A children's playground is available and a \\"train\\" tours the site. Exhibitions Entrance to the Gaulois village at the Floralies Internationales 1967 In 1967, the Floralies internationales d'Orl√©ans attracted visitors in six months.

Used in some Israeli contemporary dance, Retrieved December 15, 2015. Gaga has two educational tracks which are taught in Israel as well as several other countries: Gaga/Dancers is intended for trained dancers and comprises the daily training of the Batsheva Dance Company; Gaga/People is designed for the general public and requires no dance training. Many dancers have stated that after taking Gaga classes, their passion for dance has been re-ignited; they have found new ways to connect to their inner beast without being self-conscious about how the movement looks while at the same time discovering how to listen to their bodies/self. Gaga students improvise their movements based on somatic experience and imagery described by the teacher, which provides a framework that promotes unconventional movement.dE_uWz1hH1ZMkZlj \\"Ohad Naharin Discusses Gaga Movement\\", Retrieved December 15, 2015. The imagery is intended to guide the performer's movement expressivity by focusing attention on specific body regions. For example, \\"Luna\\", \\"Lena\\", \\"Biba\\", \\"Tama\\" and many more words are used to experiment in a performers body while dancing. Mirrors are avoided in Gaga training to facilitate movement guided by sensing and imagining rather than sight. About The Gaga movement language was created by Ohad Naharin, former Martha Graham dancer and artistic director of Batsheva Dance Company as of 1990. The movement language has developed over time in relation to Naharin's research in dance and choreography. Naharin created Gaga as a reaction to a back injury he was experiencing. The language is intended to facilitate communication with the dancers and help them to take care of the body while testing their physical limitations.Martha Schabas, Choreographer Ohad Naharin on developing the dance language Gaga The Globe and Mail The terminology within the language often emphasizes pleasure and freedom.Batsheva.co.il, Gaga Batsheva Dance Company Website The idea is that the mind can undergo many tasks and the body can still explore its power, so long as it adheres to pleasure. The movement can be uninhibited, as pleasure prevents injury. The language allows for the breaking of movement habits and the experience of effort and exaggeration, with an emphasis on sensation.Ohad Interview, Interview Ohad Naharin on the Language of Gaga Methodology A Gaga class is given as a procession of instructions that give access to bodily sensations. Each instruction is meant to help the dancer use mental approaches to create physical research. Because of the dependence of Gaga on the actual setting and people involved, there is no uniform class structure, though specific methodologies are employed.  Float  A floating sensation (referred to as 'float') is cultivated throughout. Float does not ignore the existence of gravity. However rather than giving into gravity and adhering to heaviness, the body uses gravity as a force of energy and even elevation of the limbs.KATAN-SCHMID, EINAV. EMBODIED PHILOSOPHY IN DANCE: Gaga and Ohad Naharin's Movement Research. PALGRAVE MACMILLAN, 2018. Naharin states, ‚Äúwe sense the weight of our body parts, yet, our form is not shaped by gravity.‚Äù Gaga People, Gaga Gaga People website Additionally, float is intended to facilitate a constant awareness and activeness in which dancers are never completely released, even when they are doing nothing, leaving them 'available' for movement.KATAN-SCHMID, EINAV. EMBODIED PHILOSOPHY IN DANCE: Gaga and Ohad Naharin's Movement Research. PALGRAVE MACMILLAN, 2018. Page 123.  Vocabulary  Naharin created Gaga terminology specific to bodily functions that activated throughout a dancer's Gaga practice. ‚ÄúBiba‚Äù means to pull the body away from the seat bones. It is meant to create more space and freedom in the lower spine. ‚ÄúTashi‚Äù means to move with feet glued to the floor. ‚ÄúPika‚Äù is the activation of the spot right beneath the pubic bone.  Focus on pleasure  Naharin emphasizes the return to pleasure, especially within moments of exaggeration and bodily effort. His belief is that pleasure is always good for the body. Gaga often requests demanding actions, such as running and shaking, but the effort of ‚Äúburning muscles‚Äù must be tied to pleasure in order to keep it healthy. Gaga has been taught in centers for people affected by Parkinson's disease.'Dancing with Parkinson's '  Release of aesthetic ambitions  The Gaga language focuses on the internal sensations. Due to this, classes are run without mirrors. Naharin emphasizes the release of ambitions or inhibitions. He states ‚Äúwe might be silly, we can laugh at ourselves‚Äù This kind of instruction is an effort for exploratory research without limits or tensions.  Connection to groove  With or without music, dancers are asked to connect to the musicality of their movement.KATAN-SCHMID, EINAV. EMBODIED PHILOSOPHY IN DANCE: Gaga and Ohad Naharin's Movement Research. PALGRAVE MACMILLAN, 2018. Page 156. Naharin emphasizes attention to groove, as groove is a universal experience regardless of technique levels.

He is known for his work, Universe, which attempted to accumulate the knowledge of mankind into a single book to collect and deliver a solution for all the problems of humanity.  Life  Klyce studied at the University of Arkansas. In his youth, served in the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War, and participated in the Philippine campaign. In 1902 he graduated from the U.S. Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland, where he later filed a post-graduate study for engineering. In 1908 he married Etheldreda Hovey (‚Ä† 1917). They had one son, Stephen Klyce. His second, (1917) closed marriage was with Laura Tilden Kent. They had two children, William and Dorothy Klyce Klyce. His duty in the Navy involved protecting shipping interests during the Honduras Nicaragua War of 1907. On 2 May 1907 Klyce was promoted to Commander in the U.S. Navy. On 15 February 1912 he resigned to devote himself to the study of the foundations of science ( \\"investigation of foundations of science\\").  Estate  Klyce's estate was passed by his widow to the Library of Congress in 1933, where it is still available. It includes 16 boxes with 4800 items and is located in the Manuscript Division at the Library of Congress. The deposit includes published and unpublished scripts, magazine articles, and Klyce correspondence with contemporaries such as Robert Daniel Carmichael, James McKeen Cattell, Clarence Day, John Dewey, Waldo Frank, Dorothy Canfield Fisher, David Starr Jordan, Robert Andrews Taylor, Theodore William Richards, William Emerson Ritter and Upton Sinclair. Klyce is also known to have corresponded with Frederick W. Taylor.Kurowski, Lois Landis. \\"The Gospel According to Saint Frederick: The Friendship and Shared Beliefs of Frederick W. Taylor and Scudder Klyce.\\" Academy of Management Proceedings, Aug. 2003, p. B1.  Klyce's philosophical work  Universe is Klyce's main work which he self-published in 1921. Universe claims to solve all issues related to the \\"why, how and what to solve\\" in science, religion, and philosophy. Issues with which the book is involved include astronomy, light, electricity, heat, chemicals, the spiritual union of the humanities; which unzutreffendheit Newton's laws of biology, psychology, the correlation between ethics and economics, sociology, the various theories of language in relation to physics, cosmology, energy, matter. Largely obscure after its publication, despite the inclusion of an introduction by popular American philosopher John Dewey, Universe managed to capture brief notability in 1989. In that year, Alan Grant, a regular author of Detective Comics for DC Comics, made reference to Universe within the comic book. In the story, the character Anarky, a creation of Grant's, drew heavy influence from Klyce, and the author made some of Klyce's philosophy a part of Anarky's characteristics. In another reference, Grant wrote a book (Batman: The Stone King) in which Batman owns a personally signed edition with notes, but exchanges it with Scarecrow for some information. Klyce's second work, Sins of Science was published 1925. In it, Klyce says that the basics of science and religion should be separated. His chief concern of the book is to show how a man should be able to obtain happiness and success.  Works  * Universe, 1921.

History The IPC was established by the Planning Act 2008 and began operating on 1 October 2009 and provided advice and guidance about the application process until its powers to receive, accept and examine applications for development consent came into force on 1 March 2010. It was abolished by Coalition Government's Localism Act 2011 which transferred its decision making powers in all cases to the relevant Secretary of State. The Act gained royal assent on 15 November 2011 and from 1 April 2012, the acceptance and examination of applications for development consent is dealt with by a new Infrastructure Planning Unit within the Planning Inspectorate. Function The IPC examined accepted applications for development consent for proposed projects that meet certain thresholds, as set out in Part 3 of the 2008 Act. In England, its remit covered applications for proposed energy, transport, water, waste water and waste infrastructure projects. Its remit in Wales only covered proposed energy and harbour projects. The framework for decision-making of applications for development consent was set out in National Policy Statements (NPS). Following the designation of a NPS, the 2008 Act provided jurisdiction for the IPC to decide applications in that field. While an NPS is in draft form, the IPC acted as Examining authority and provided a report of recommendation to the relevant Secretary of State who was to take the decision.

In 1632, the first documented mention of Hundsturm was made. In 1600, Archduke Matthias, who later became Emperor, built a R√ºdenhausen in Hundsturm. The name Hundsturm (\\"Hounds Tower\\") might come from this R√ºdenhausen. It is more likely, however, that the name goes back to the former mill, which was occupied in 1408 as the first time in the disk Hunczm√ºhle Ried. The R√ºdenhausen was demolished in 1672, when Hundsturm Castle was built in its place, but in the 19th Century, the castle was also demolished. During the 17th Century, the settlement grew around the castle, especially along the present Sch√∂nbrunnerstra√üe between Spengergasse and Margareteng√ºrtel. In 1842 Hundsturm came through the purchase of the municipality to Vienna. The incorporation took place in 1850 as part of the original configuration of the 4th District Wieden. However, in 1862, Hundsturm was allocated to the new 5th District Margareten. In 1907, smaller parts of the former suburb were re-zoned into the 12th District Meidling. At the Hundsturm cemetery, founded in 1783, was buried in 1809, the famous Austrian composer Joseph Haydn. Today the remains are instead in the Haydn Park Cemetery within Meidling. The Hundsturm coat of arms shows, on a blue background, a castle tower on a green meadow. From the open door of the golden tower jumps a dog.

Life Ingegerd Knutsdotter was the daughter of M√§rtha (Margareta) Ulfsdotter and Knut Algotsson, and the maternal grandchild of Saint Bridget of Sweden. She was raised with the future Union Queen Margaret, as her mother served as royal governess. She was inducted into the Vadstena Abbey in 1374 at the age of eighteen, the same year as the body of Bridget was returned to Sweden. Abbess In 1385, she succeeded Margareta Bosdotter (Oxenstierna) as abbess, although the abbey was still not officially recognized. On 18 May 1388, after the Vadstena Abbey was officially recognized by the pope, she was ordained as its first official abbess. During her tenure, she received the Union Queen Margaret when the monarch claimed to have had a vision, kissed the hands of all the members of the convent and was ordained as a lay sister. In 1400 the city of Vadstena was granted city rights by Queen Margaret on Ingegerd's request. Ingegerd was accused of forgery of the convent's documents, for embezzlement of the convent's property, and for having brought the abbey to disrepute by breaking the vow of chastity. It was a great scandal, as she was related to Saint Bridget. Ingegerd was accused of having \\"consorted too intimately\\" with both worldly men as well as men of the church. She embezzled from the taxes to the pope and gave it to her relative, Bishop Canute of Link√∂ping, who cooperated with her in draining the abbey's assets by accepting her forged seals as genuine. She was to have persuaded the monk Lucas Jacobi to break his vows and let him enter the female section of the abbey, where he destroyed the Letter of Privilege of the Vadstena Abbey by the Pope, and prevented six monks from being ordained to priesthood because they had refused to break their vows. The abbey complained to Queen Margaret, but without result, as Ingegerd enjoyed great status as the granddaughter of Saint Bridget. In 1400, Ingegerd deposed the procurator of the monks, Sten Stensson, and replaced him with Lucas Jacobi, who was thereafter sent as her envoy to the Pope in Rome. In 1401, the monks opposed her by choosing Petrus Johannis as their general confessor, after which Johannis deposed Jacobi and reinstated Stensson. The abbey was then visited by Bishop Canute of Link√∂ping, who ordered them to obey Ingegerd's authority. Hereafter, the nuns asked Ingegerd to leave her post. When she refused, the nuns and monks joined forces and deposed her in a coup and choose Christina Staffansdotter Stangenberg (d. 1438) as acting abbess while Ingegerd was investigated. Stangenberg and Martin, the leader of the monks, thereafter sent an appeal directly to the Pope and asked for an investigation of Ingegerds rule. Bishop Canute of Link√∂ping tried to prevent the investigation by hiring men to attack and harass the Abbey's tenants and place people loyal to Ingegerd as vicars in the congregations placed under the abbey. Later life In November 1402, the Pope ordered Bishop Peter of Str√§ngn√§s to undertake an investigation against the accusations of forgery, embezzlement and for breaking the vow of chastity. After the investigation proved that the accusations was truthful, Ingegerd was declared guilty and deposed from her position as abbess the 5 February 1403. In the following election, she was replaced by Gerdeka Hartlevsdotter in the office. After her deposition, Ingegerd lived as a regular member of the abbey. At the time of her death, the convent was assured that her sins were forgiven, as she had died with the words: \\"O! dulcissima Maria, Mater Dei, adjuva nunc\\", after having received the sacrament. She died in 1412. References * Anteckningar om svenska qvinnor / * Anteckningar om svenska qvinnor / * Nordisk familjebok / 1800-talsutg√•van. 17.

Bowen & Company, Inc., Indianapolis, Indiana, 1915, Pg. 179. At the time, there was no community, although the church did draw many settlers from that part of Union County. In 1871, a Short-line railroad was announced running between Columbus and Springfield, and a store was opened near the church in expectation of the railroad. In 1873, the railroad was completed, and a station was opened and named Lilly Chapel. The community was laid out on August 28, 1871, by Henry Gilroy and Henry Lilly, and originally named Gilroy. Due to the church and railroad station already being named Lilly Chapel, when Henry Lilly petitioned for a post office, he used that name. The Lilly Chapel Post Office was established April 16, 1873, and the first postmaster was Thomas Horn, who was also the community's first railroad agent. The town's first physician was Dr. Taggart, who moved to Lilly Chapel in 1880, and by 1885, the community contained three general stores, one grocery store, two blacksmith shops, a wagon and buggy shop, two steam sawmills, and two grain elevators. In 1878, a steam-powered tile factory was built. As of 1915, the community contained a bank, two churches, a high school, two general stores, a hardware store, a confectionery, a grain elevator, and a blacksmith. The post office was discontinued on December 31, 1957, and the mail service is now through the West Jefferson branch. Demographics As of 1885, the community had a population of 200, and as of 1915, the population was 370.

Historical meaning The use of the word \\"drunk\\" to signify being overcome by substances other than alcohol is long-established, e.g. drunk with opium (1585), or with tobacco (1698). In October 1905 Thomas Edison (then 58 years old) declared that \\"the country is food drunk.... the people eat too much and sleep too much, and don't work enough\\". Citing the theories of Louis Cornaro (born 1464), Edison explained how an assistant had been so affected by experiments with X-rays that \\"doctors had to amputate one limb after another.... and finally he died\\". Thomas Edison also stated that by reducing his food intake to a day, at the end of two months he weighed just as much as when he began, exactly . The phrase was echoed by Dr J E Rullfson of Toledo after fasting for sixty days from January 5, 1907. He holds that the entire human race is food drunk, saying \\"the dinner eaten by Napoleon just before the battle of Leipsic proved so indigestible that the monarch's brain was clouded and as a result the battle was lost and a pie which King Philip failed to digest caused the revolt of the Netherlands.\\" State of being food drunk When people overeat, their bodies have the tendency to chemically change, including metabolic shifts. There are also electrolyte imbalances due to the process of digestion that occur once the massive amounts of food have been deposited into the body. This can also cause a feeling of depression, emotional attachment to food, fatigue, and also boredom. This is hypothesized to be partially due to dopamine and endorphin release after food consumption (especially spicy foods).

The Mummy of San Andr√©s is a human mummy belonging to the Guanche culture, who were the ancient inhabitants of the Canary Islands, Spain. It is one of the best preserved Guanche mummies, and is one of the few that has a proper name, Mummy of San Andr√©s. The appellation refers to the place where the male specimen was discovered, similar to how the mummies of the swamps in northern Europe were named after local toponyms (Lindow Man, Grauballe Man and Tollund Man, among others). The mummy is a male of about 25 to 30 years partially covered with goatskin with 6 strips that surround it. It was found in a cave in a ravine outside the village of San Andr√©s. The mummy was found in the Anaga massif, an area on the island of Tenerife that is rich in archaeological finds. It is thought that the mummy might have been that of a Mencey (aboriginal king), or a leading figure in Guanche society of the time. The exact year of the mummy's discovery is unknown. The specimen was kept at the Museo Municipal of Santa Cruz de Tenerife until 1958, when the mummy became part of the collections of the Museum of Nature and Man (Museo de la Naturaleza y el Hombre) of Santa Cruz de Tenerife, where it currently is.

Born in Edmonton in 1950, and placed in a foster home at the age of two, Cardinal only discovered his M√©tis roots while making his documentary Foster Child. This 1987 National Film Board of Canada (NFB) film received over 10 international film awards, including a Gemini Award for best direction for a documentary program, following its broadcast on CBC's Man Alive series. Background After graduating from the radio and TV arts program of the Northern Alberta Institute of Technology in 1971, he worked as a studio cameraman at Alberta's Access network, where he made his first film, a documentary about the pianist Mark Jablonski. In 1975 he became director and associate producer of the series Come Alive. He also Shadow Puppets: Indian Myths and Legends, a series on Cree and Blackfoot legends. Cardinal left Access in 1980 to work with the NFB as a freelance director, researcher, writer and editor. His first film he directed for the Film Board was Children of Alcohol (1983), produced by Anne Wheeler, a documentary about the effects of parental alcoholism on children. He also shot a series of short documentaries and dramas, notably Hotwalker (1985), before making Foster Child. In 1987, Cardinal made Keyanaw Tatuskhatamak, about the struggle for Native self-government in northern Alberta. Other NFB credits include The Spirit Within (1990), on Native spiritual programs in prisons, and David with F.A.S. (1997), about fetal alcohol syndrome. In 1998, he directed the CBC miniseries Big Bear, for which Cardinal was nominated for a second Gemini. In 2006, he made the CBC drama Indian Summer: The Oka Crisis, about the 1990 Oka Crisis. Cardinal also directed numerous episodes of North of 60 and The Rez, and an episode of the drama anthology series Four Directions. He directed two NFB documentaries about the ultimately successful efforts of the Haisla Nation to repatriate their g'psgolox pole, a mortuary pole taken from them in 1929. His 2003 film Totem: The Return of the G‚Äôpsgolox Pole, premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival. Death and legacy In 1997, Cardinal was recognized with a National Aboriginal Achievement Award, now the Indspire Awards, for Film and Television. On November 7, 2015, the Alberta Media Production Industries Association (AMPIA) announced at its 27th David Billington Award ceremony that he was the recipient of the 2015 award, which honours contributions to the province's audiovisual industry. Too ill to attend, Cardinal had been presented with the award at a private ceremony. AMPIA also announced the creation of the Gil Cardinal Legacy Fund, which was founded by close friends, to provide funding for emerging Aboriginal filmmakers to kickstart their careers.

The line was closed to passengers by British Railways in October 1956 and completely two years later. The station had a single platform, a stone-built station building, and a siding.

Initially, it was manned by European gunners of the 2nd Company, 2nd Battalion Bengal Artillery but in 1854, Europeans were replaced with Indian gunners. One of the first officers of the unit was Lieutenant FS Roberts, later Field Marshal Lord Roberts of Kandahar. The battery was equipped with four 3-pounder guns and four 4.5-inch howitzers. In 1858, it became part of the Punjab Irregular Force (Piffer). The Punjab Irregular Force, later designated as the Punjab Frontier Force, earned legendary fame for its exploits on the Northwest Frontier of India. The Peshawar Battery saw extensive service on the Frontier and took part in numerous operations including the Umbeyla Campaign of 1863 and the Second Afghan War of 1878-80.

The name means literally \\"the skies\\", in allusion to the celestial vault (the sky). Acham√°n, an omnipotent and eternal god, created the land and the water, the fire and the air, and all creatures derived their existence from him. Acham√°n lived in the heights and sometimes descended upon the summits of the mountains, contemplating his creations. According to legend, Guayota kidnapped Magec (the sun) and shut it up in the Teide, plunging the world into darkness. Humans prayed to Acham√°n who saved Magec, and instead locked Guayota up in the Teide. Another aboriginal legend is that of the creation of the human being, according to which Acham√°n had created a group of men and women of water and land, giving them cattle for their sustenance. Later he created more people, but he did not give them cattle, indicating that they should serve the first ones. This myth of origin explained the different social classes that existed in the Guanche people. Other names of Acham√°n are: * Achuhuran * Achahucanac * Achguayaxerax * Achoron On other islands, its name also varied, however it is not known if they really belong to the same god. Although if they relate to the supreme god: * Acoran (Gran Canaria) * Abora (La Palma) * Orahan (La Gomera) * Eraorahan (El Hierro) In Lanzarote and Fuerteventura, the name of the supreme god is unknown.

She was involved in a collision in 1973 in which thirteen of her crew perished. She was rebuilt and sailed under various other names until being scrapped in 1985. Construction and service She was built at Kockums shipyard in Malm√∂, Sweden and launched on 26 October 1959. Following outfitting, she entered commercial service transporting crude and refined oil products for the Esso Oil Company throughout Europe, Africa and North America. Built along classic lines with the bridge and the officer's quarters located amidships and the engines, crew quarters and aft deckhouse located toward the stern, Esso Brussels was a typical oil tanker in both size and design for her time. Collision with the container vessel Sea Witch The Esso Brussels dropped anchor in the southernmost anchorage of The Narrows in New York Harbor on June 1, 1973, fully loaded with of light Nigerian crude oil destined for Exxon's Bayway Refinery. While she waited for the high tide, her mixed European crew of 36 men and one woman, first steward Gisele Rome, under the command of Captain Constant Dert went about their daily routine into the evening of the 1st. When the 12 a.m. to 4 a.m. watch came on duty all seemed normal. At roughly the same time, the container ship Sea Witch left the Howland Hook Marine Terminal on Staten Island. She headed for the sea, carrying some 730 containers on board. Twenty-nine minutes after midnight, the Sea Witch passed the ferry terminal at the tip of St. George, Staten Island and turned to a heading of 167 degrees in order to begin transiting the Narrows separating Staten Island from Brooklyn. Seven minutes later the Sandy Hook pilot Jack Cahill ordered a change in course to 156 degrees so the ship would pass through the shipping lane in the general anchorage. The second turn never occurred. When the ship did not respond as expected, the helmsman told the Captain that Sea Witch was no longer steering. Both the captain's and the pilot's attempts to re-engage the steering gear and check the Sea Witch's continuing turn to starboard proved futile. With all steering control was lost and the ship proceeding at 15 knots with the aid of an outbound tide the Sea Witch was being forced out of the channel toward Staten Island. The Pilot immediately ordered the engines to full astern and the port anchor to be let go in an effort to stop the ship. Blowing a series of short rapid blasts on the ship's whistle signaling that Sea Witch was in distress and ordering the general alarm bell rung to alert the crew, both the pilot and the captain watched as both of her anchors failed to deploy. A mere two and a half minutes after control was lost on board Sea Witch she was a mere from the starboard side of the Esso Brussels and realizing that the ship was not going to be able to stop in time, the Sea Witch's whistle was locked to sound continuously and her crew abandoned the forward section of the ship. The mate standing what was a quiet and uneventful watch on Esso Brussels's bridge heard Sea Witch's distress whistle and watched as the container ship began to head out of the channel towards his ship. First thinking that the disabled ship would pass astern of his tanker, the Mate sounded the general alarm as the Sea Witch continued to veer in his direction. With only about two minutes of warning, many of the crew of the Esso Brussels were still below decks when the collision occurred. Making about 13 knots and her engines in full reverse, Sea Witch rammed its ice-reinforced bow into the starboard side of the Esso Brussels between the midship and aft deckhouses, piercing three of the Esso Brussels' cargo tanks and locking the two ships together. The light crude oil spewed out of the punctured tanks and its vapors quickly caught fire wreathing both ships in a pool of burning oil. Despite the sudden chaos on the Esso Brussels Capt. Dert supervised the terrified crew as they abandoned the burning ship onto the only available lifeboat. Having lowered the motorized aft port lifeboat the crew tried to release it from its lines and get its engine started, but the hand crank to start the engine was impossible to operate on the overloaded lifeboat once freed from the ship. Despite the resistance from the anchors of the Esso Brussels, the engines of Sea Witch, still running full reverse, were pulling both ships down the Narrows. This movement created a suction force which pinned the Esso Brussel's lifeboat against the tanker's hull and brought the pool of flaming oil around to the port side of the ship. A last-second attempt to row the lifeboat away from the advancing fire failed to overpower the suction, and as the flames grew nearer to the lifeboat, many of the crew jumped into the water in a desperate attempt to escape the flames. Within minutes of the collision the veteran FDNY fireboat Fire Fighter arrived to what the firefighters aboard would later describe as a sea of flames that extended 3,000 yards in front of them. Thinking there had been an explosion on the Esso Brussels, the fireboat began to pour water onto the ship from its starboard bow, keeping their ship upwind and upcurrent from the smoke and flames now heading towards the Verrazano- Narrows Bridge. As the two ships passed beneath the bridge, the pool of burning oil surrounding the ships sent flames high enough to scorch the bottom of the bridge above the water's surface. Fortunately, the anchor chains on the Esso Brussels parted at this point and both ships passed under the bridge quickly, preventing the steel from suffering heat damage. Propelled by the Sea Witchs still-running engines and the outbound tide, the ships proceeded into outer New York Harbor and ran aground in Gravesend Bay, burning furiously. After both ships grounded, Fire Fighter moved into position and fought the oil fire from the port side of Esso Brussels. To their horror, as they extinguished the fire they saw the bow of Sea Witch was embedded in the starboard side and realized that two vessels were involved in the inferno. Moving quickly along the port side of the container ship they began to pour water on the blazing container stack of the Sea Witch and moved toward its stern, hoping to find some evidence of the ship's crew, 30 of whom were rescued from the stern of the ship. At dawn on June 2nd, 1973, the fires from the oil cargo on board the Esso Brussels were mostly under control, aided by her sound construction which prevented the oil in her undamaged tanks from leaking out or catching fire. Sea Witch was in much worse condition, as almost all the on-deck containers were still burning. The US Coast Guard and FDNY agreed to have tugs separate the vessels to avoid the risk of the rest of the oil aboard the Esso Brussels catching fire. Once separated, the four FDNY fireboats easily extinguished what little oil continued to burn and the hulk of the Esso Brussels was towed to the Military Ocean Terminal at Bayonne to have the balance of her oil cargo removed onto barges for delivery. By this time, tugs and small craft managed to rescue the Esso Brussels survivors from the water, but 13 of her crew were lost and never seen again. Two members of the Sea Witch's crew were lost below decks, unable to escape the fire and heat. Later life In the months following the collision the severely damaged Esso Brussels remained at the Military Ocean Terminal until November 1973, when she was purchased by Iphigenia Shipping & Trading Co, Piraeus, Greece. Esso Brussels was towed to Piraeus to be rebuilt. Emerging from the shipyard in 1973, the newly named Petrola XVII was placed under the management of John D Latsis. In 1974, she was renamed Spiro, then Petrola XXXVI in 1975, when she was sold to Latsis. In 1976, she was sold back to Iphigenia Shipping & Trading and was renamed Petrola 36. In 1983, management was transferred to Bilinder Marine Corp. Petrola 36 served until 1985, arriving on 21 October at Aliaƒüa, Turkey for scrapping.

A comprador is a native manager for a European business house in East and South East Asia, and, by extension, social groups that play broadly similar roles in other parts of the world. Etymology The term comprador, a Portuguese word that means buyer, derives from the Latin comprare, which means to procure. The original usage of the word in East Asia meant a native servant in European households in Guangzhou in southern China or the neighboring Portuguese colony at Macao that went to market to barter their employers' wares. The term then evolved to mean the native contract suppliers who worked for foreign companies in East Asia or the native managers of firms in East Asia. Compradors held important positions in southern China buying and selling tea, silk, cotton and yarn for foreign corporations and working in foreign-owned banks. Robert Hotung, a late-nineteenth-century compradore of the British-owned trading conglomerate Jardine, Matheson & Co. was believed to be the richest man in Hong Kong by the age of 35. Li & Fung partly functioned as a Canton comprador in its early stages. In Marxism, the term comprador bourgeoisie was later applied to similar trading-class in regions outside East Asia.Mao Zedong; Michael Y. M. Kau, John K. Leung (eds.)

As a liceo classico it offers a traditional classical curriculum with a strong concentration on Italian, Latin and Greek. Alternative syllabi are available for some degree of specialisation in foreign languages, mathematics and computer science, or history of art. The school opened in 1919 as the 'Regio Liceo-Ginnasio del Vomero', an autonomous offshoot of the Vittorio Emanuele school with premises in Via Morghen. The following year it received the title of Sannazaro, after the Neapolitan poet and Renaissance humanist Jacopo Sannazaro. The school was co-educational from the start with six girls included in the first intake of 35; of the 230‚Äì230 pupils who attended classes during the first four years, around a third where female. One of the reasons for building the school in Vomero was to assuage the anxieties of its residents regarding the potential dangers and temptations their daughters could face if they were to travel down into the city every day for their education. In 1938 the school moved to its current site in Via Puccini, opening on 28 October 'in the name of Mussolini'. During the September 1943 Four days of Naples, the uprising against Nazi occupation, the school served as Vomero's resistance headquarters.

Guayota, in Guanche mythology of Tenerife (the Canary Islands), was the principal malignant deity and Acham√°n's adversary. Mythology According to Guanche legend, Guayota lived inside the Teide volcano, one of the gateways to the underworld. Guayota was said to be represented as a black dog and was accompanied by demons, also in the form of black dogs, known as tibicenas. According to legend, Guayota kidnapped Magec (the sun) and shut it up in Teide, plunging the world into darkness. Humans prayed to Acham√°n who saved Magec and instead locked Guayota up in Teide. Guayota is the king of evil genies, and was worshiped on the island of Tenerife in the Guanche religion. Features Guayota shares features similar to other malignant deity- inhabitants of volcanoes as in the case of the goddess Pele in Hawaiian mythology, who lived in the Kƒ´lauea volcano and was regarded by the native Hawaiians as responsible for the eruptions of the volcano. In popular culture Currently, like other aboriginal gods, Guayota remains a typical Canary creature folklore.

Career  Born in New York, Gross began his career as a commercial photographer, apprenticing with photographers Francesco Scavullo and James Moore and studying with master photographers Lisette Model and Richard Avedon. His fashion and beauty photography has been featured in numerous fashion magazines over the years and his work has appeared on the covers of such magazines as GQ, Cosmopolitan, and New York Magazine. Celebrities Gross has photographed include Calvin Klein, Gloria Steinem, Whitney Houston, and Lou Reed. Gross studied with the Animal Behavior Center of New York and became a certified dog trainer in 2002, using that training to begin working with dogs and creating Fine Art style portraits. His last project was a series of large scale portraits of senior dogs and he actively supported charities that benefited rescue dogs and senior dogs. His work has received awards from The Art Directors Club and the Advertising Club of New York.  Brooke Shields photograph controversy  Gross was the photographer of a controversial set of nude images taken in 1975 of a then ten-year-old Brooke Shields with the consent of her mother, Teri Shields, for the Playboy publication Sugar 'n' Spice. The images portray Shields nude, standing and sitting in a bathtub, wearing makeup and covered in oil. Two of the images were full-frontal. In 1981, Shields attempted to prevent further use of the photographs but in 1983 a US Court ruled that a child is bound by the terms of the valid, unrestricted consents to the use of photographs executed by a guardian and that the image did not breach child pornography laws.http://jcomm.uoregon.edu/~tgleason/j385/Brooke.htm In ruling, the presiding Judge stated: \\"The issue on this appeal is whether an infant model may disaffirm a prior unrestricted consent executed on her behalf by her parent and maintain an action pursuant to section 51 of the Civil Rights Law against her photographer for republication of photographs of her.

Bred in Kentucky by W. Bruce Lunsford and raced under the Adena Springs banner for owner Frank Stronach, he had a record of 25: 7-7-4 with career earnings of $2,194,510. Golden Missile was best known for his wins in the grade one Pimlico Special and the grade two Stephen Foster Handicap.Pedigree Online, Thoroughbred Database;.  Two-year-old season  Golden Missile only raced one time as a two-year-old finishing second and earning $4,100 for the year.  Three-year-old season  At age three Golden Missile was a modest horse showing some signs of improving, he won his first race by 2¬Ω lengths in a maiden special weight at Hialeah Park Race Track. Then he made headlines and drew attention by winning an allowance race at Churchill Downs by 8¬Ω lengths. He followed that up win in a nine furlong turf race in the Cumberland Stakes at Ellis Park winning by 5 lengths. He record as a three-year-old was (5): 3-1-1 for annual earnings of $90,470.  Four-year-old season  As a four-year-old, Golden Missile started his campaign at Hialeah in March 1999 and won the grade three Widener Handicap at nine furlongs over Early Warning, Sir Bear. He then took some time off and was freshened until summer. On the New Jersey beach, Golden Missile won his first start back at Monmouth Park Racetrack and won the $80,000 Skip Away Stakes by 7¬Ω lengths. In August he shipped up to Saratoga and placed third in the $300,000 grade two Saratoga Breeders' Cup Handicap behind Running Stag and Catienus. Then in September he had a good solid performance in the $500,000 grade three Hawthorne Gold Cup Handicap, being nipped at wire by British invader Supreme Sound by a nose. Stronach and Orseno then decided to take on the world by entering Golden Missile in North America's richest race, the $4,000,000 Breeders' Cup Classic. He finished third in the grade one Classic to Cat Thief and Budroyale earning a show check for $364,000 that day. He finished 1999 with a record of (9): 2-2-2 for annual earnings of $838,240.Thoroughbred Times Stallion Directory;  Five-year-old season  In his five-year-old season Golden Missile really came into top form and became one of the best handicap horses in the country in 2000. In February of that year he placed second in the $500,000 grade one Donn Handicap to Stephen Got Even by a half length. In the fall of 2000 Golden Missile had a series of solid performances which included a runner-up performance to Captain Steve by 3/4 of a length in the $500,000 grade two Kentucky Cup Classic Handicap at Turfway Park; a third- place finish in the $500,000 grade three Hawthorne Gold Cup in Chicago, Illinois at Hawthorne Race Course and a runner-up finish to Yankee Victor in the grade three Westchester Handicap in New York at Aqueduct Racetrack. But it was his wins in the summer of 2000 that Golden Missile will best be remembered for and those signature wins in the Pimlico Special Handicap and the Stephen Foster Handicap that propelled him from a good horse to a very good horse competing to be a candidate for the Eclipse Award for older male horse. In May 2000 Golden Missile went off as the 9-2 fourth choice in a field of nine graded stakes winners that competed in the $750,000 grade one Pimlico Special Handicap in Baltimore, Maryland at Pimlico Race Course. He broke slow as the gates opened and was next to last passing the stands for the first time as Cat Thief, Budroyale and favorite K One King led. Jockey Kent Desormeaux asked Golden Missile for a little run early and by the time they hit that famous clubhouse turn at Old Hilltop he was placed third on the outside. Going down the backstretch three horses fought nose to nose on the front end including Cat Thief, Budroyale and Golden Missile. Coming out of the far turn and into the stretch Golden Missile pulled ahead of Cat Thief as Lemon Drop Kid and Almutawakel charged around the outside. As they neared the finish Golden Missile pulled ahead and won going away by three lengths in front of Lemon Drop Kid and Present Breeze.2007 Maryland Jockey Club Media Guide, page 47-52 on March 3, 2007. Then just five weeks later Golden Missile beat Ecton Park and Cat Thief again at Churchill Downs to win the grade two Stephen Foster Handicap by 2-2/4 lengths. He finished his five-year-old season earning more than one million dollars with a record of (10): 2-3-1 for an annual profit of $1,261,700.  Retirement  Golden Missile was retired in 2001. In 2007, he was the number one sire in the state of New York for number of winners and progeny earnings. He now stands at Milfer Farm in Unadilla, New York. His 2009 stud fee is $7,500.

It is the most complete early hominid specimen, with most of the skull, teeth, pelvis, hands and feet, more complete than the previously known Australopithecus afarensis specimen called \\"Lucy.\\" In all, 125 different pieces of fossilized bone were found.  Discovery  The Ardi skeleton was discovered at Aramis in the arid badlands near the Awash River in Ethiopia in 1994 by a college student, Yohannes Haile-Selassie, when he uncovered a partial piece of a hand bone. The discovery was made by a team of scientists led by UC Berkeley anthropologist, Tim D. White, and was analyzed by an international group of scientists that included Owen Lovejoy heading the biology team. On 1 October 2009, the journal Science published an open-access collection of eleven articles, detailing many aspects of A. ramidus and its environment. Her fossils were also found near animal remains which indicated that she inhabited a forest type of environment, contrary to the theory that bipedalism originated in savannahs. Ardi was not the first fossil of A. ramidus to come to light. The first ones were found in Ethiopia in 1992, but it took 17 years to assess their significance.  Etymology  The word Ardi means \\"ground floor\\" and the word ramid means \\"root\\" in the Afar language, suggesting that Ardi lived on the ground and was the root of the family tree of humanity.  Description  Scientific paleoartist Jay Matternes' rendition of Ardi Ardi weighed about , and could be up to tall. Although she is a biped, Ardi had both opposable big toes and thumbs in order to climb trees. It is speculated that her bipedality impeded movement, but enabled her to bear more offspring. Although it is not known whether Ardi's species is related to Homo sapiens, the discovery is of great significance and added much to the debate on Ardipithecus and its place in human evolution. With regards to Ardi's body composition, archaeologists note that she is unique in that she possesses traits that are characteristic of both extinct primates and early hominids. It is still a point of debate whether Ardi was capable of bipedal movement. Ardi's divergent big toes are not characteristic of a biped. However, the found remains of her legs, feet, pelvis, and hands suggested that she walked upright when on the ground but was a quadruped when moving around trees. Her big toe, for example, spreads out quite a bit from her foot to better grasp tree limbs. Unlike chimpanzees, however, her foot contains a unique small bone inside a tendon which kept the big toe stronger. When seen along with Ardi's other bone structures, this unique bone would have helped her walk bipedally, though less efficient than Lucy. Her wrist bones also provided her with flexibility but the palm bones were short. This suggests that Ardi did not walk on her knuckles and only used her palms to move along tree branches. Some of Ardi's teeth are still connected to her jawbone and show enamel wear suggesting a diet consisting of fruit and nuts. The canine teeth of A. ramidus are smaller, and equal in size between males and females. This suggests reduced male-to-male conflict, pair-bonding, and increased parental investment. \\"Thus fundamental reproductive and social behavioral changes probably occurred in hominids long before they had enlarged brains and began to use stone tools.\\" See also * * ReferencesExternal links * Human Origins and the Fossil Skeleton Ardi Radio interview of Stanley Ambrose, Professor of Anthropology, University of Illinois * Ardipithecus ramidus -Science Journal Article * Discovering Ardi - Discovery Channel * Human Timeline (Interactive) ‚Äì Smithsonian, National Museum of Natural History (August 2016).

It was their first to chart and the second-highest charting album they produced. The songs dealt with issues like self-image (\\"Fearfully and Wonderfully\\"), putting trust in God instead of other people or Satan (\\"Holding the Puppet Strings\\"), and people's use of excuses to hold on to bad habits (\\"This Lie\\").

He graduated M.A. in 1623; he received the higher degrees of B.D. in 1630 and D.D. in 1644. He was elected to the mastership in a close contest, and the first for which the Fellows had chosen, the previous Masters having been outside nominees. On 13 September 1643 eleven Fellows met in the college chapel. The candidates were one of them external, Herbert Thorndike of Trinity College, Cambridge, and Minshull who was a Fellow of Sidney. Herbert was a royalist, while Minshull had the backing of Oliver Cromwell, a college contemporary. The matter hung in the balance but was settled by the intervention of the troops of Edward Montagu, 2nd Earl of Manchester, in command of the Eastern Association covering the area for Parliament since August of that year. Despite the strong-arm tactics employed, Charles I confirmed the appointment and Minshull continued in the post for the rest of his life.http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=66658#s11 He was vice-chancellor of the university in 1652.

It is known to be the valuable source for the political history of the formative period of Maratha Empire. The document was first edited by B.G. Tilak and published by Bharat Itihas Sanshodhak Mandal, Pune, in 1916. Background The Jedhes, the Khopades, the Bandals and the Naik-Nimbalkars were the prominent Deshmukhs of Maval. Out of these, Jedhes of Kaari, in modern-day Bhor, were the Deshmukhs of 'Rohid Khora', which includes the forts of Raireshwar and Rohideshwar, in the Maval region of the modern Pune district, which is near Bhor about 48 km towards south of Pune. Being the leaders of their region, they were privileged persons and enjoyed a high status in political, social and economic life of the region. Kanhoji Jedhe is regarded as the real founder of the Jedhe family as he and his son Baji, popularly known as Sarjerao Jedhe, brought their family to prominence by rendering valuable services to Shivaji, the founder of Maratha Empire in the 17th century. Jedhe Shakawali (chronology) and Jedhe Karina (statement) are their family records which is now regarded as the genuine evidence for many historical events including birth date of Shivaji. Contents Jedhe Shakawali consists of year-wise data starting from 1618 AD (birth of Aurangzeb) and ending to 1697 AD (the besiege of the Gingee fort). The years are, however, mentioned in terms of 'Shaliwahan Shaka', the Indian year, which is approximately 78 years behind the modern AD. It also mentions many-a-times about day, date and timing of the event. The main feature of the Jedhe Shakawali is known to be the brief and 'To the point' descriptions of the events.

The boulevard is conterminous with Farm to Market Road 3005 south of 61st Street. It runs along the Gulf coast waterfront of the island near the main parts of the city. It is named for the Galveston Seawall built along the beaches. The sidewalk adjacent to Seawall Boulevard on the south is claimed to be the longest continuous sidewalk in the world at long.Galveston, Texas Outdoor Recreation & Nature Accessed 2012-03-15. Seawall Boulevard is home to several hotels and entertainment venues including the famous Hotel Galvez. In 2011 a voter referendum which passed by the Seawall Enhancement Campaign led to a creation of a parking management district where motorists who park on Seawall Boulevard would pay up to $8 per day or $25 annually where revenue from paid parking is used for Seawall enhancements. Paid parking is waived on the Fourth of July, Mardi Gras, and the Lone Star Rally but due to the budget shortfall of the first six months of the Seawall Enhancement Campaign parking revenues are still collected despite the provisions stated during the 2011 election. A sunset clause which was part of the 2011 referendum eliminates paid parking after 7 years of service. Paid seawall parking was phased in since July 11, 2013 which is slated to expire July 11, 2020 where a continuation of the Seawall Enhancement Campaign after the 7-year contract requires another voter referendum to be placed on the May 2020 voter ballot for the City of Galveston municipal elections. December 2016 marked the end of an era where 24 hour parking is a thing of the past - the Galveston City Council approved a 3-5 a.m. curfew where some beachgoers have monopolized parking spaces on both sides of the Seawall from Broadway to 101st Street with the exception of the designated areas around the 61st and 94th Street Pier used by fishermen. Open Era During Galveston's Open Era the road became quite famous as a lavish, nationally known tourist venue and casino district featuring elegant hotels and clubs. The boulevard's prominence began with the construction of the club and casino Maceo's Grotto (later called the Balinese Room) in 1929.Miller (1993), pg. 6 Cartwright (1998), pg. 9 Other famous locations on this road included Murdoch's Bath House, the Buccaneer Hotel, the Pleasure Pier, and the Mountain Speedway roller coaster.Cartwright (1998), pg. 194 Miller (1993), pg. 185 Bath Houses and Boulevard, Galveston, Texas [The Murdoch] (postcard, circa 1915-1924)Murdoch's Bathhouse Wreckage after 1915 Galveston Hurricane The boulevard became the focal point for tourism events such as the International Pageant of Pulchritude of the 1920s, the first international beauty contest. The event would be held on the beach in front of the seawall attracting tourists from around the nation and media attention from around the world. Other events along the boulevard included the spectacular Mardi Gras parade and celebration. This era of prosperity declined during the 1940s and ended in the 1950s with the closing of the casinos by the Texas Rangers.

From 1990, she was a member of the Bundestag as well as of the Federal Executive Board of the CDU. Between 1994 and 1998, B√∂hmer served on the Committee on Labour and Social Affairs as well as on the Committee on Family Affairs. From 2000, she was part of the CDU/CSU parliamentary group's leadership, first under chairman Friedrich Merz (2000‚Äì02) and later under chairwoman Angela Merkel (2002‚Äì05).

In 2010, B√∂hmer proposed to introduce legally binding quotas to boost the low number of people with immigrant backgrounds in public sector jobs, saying it would ensure that the public service sector better mirrored the country's population; however, Germans politicians ‚Äì both from B√∂hmer's own conservative Christian Democratic Party as well as from the centre-left opposition ‚Äì opposed the measure.Sonia Phalnikar (15 January 2010), German politicians reject immigrant quotas in the public sector Deutsche Welle.

The perigynium is a modified prophyll, tissue of leaf origin, that encloses the dry, one-seeded achene. In liverworts, \\"perigynium\\" refers to a tube-shaped structure which encases the archegonium and the developing sporophyte. The location, size, shape, hairiness, color, and other aspects of the perigynium are important structures for distinguishing Carex species. They are often subtended by a scale, which may also aid in identification. Dispersal Features of the perigynium may aid in seed dispersal, such as a surface that clings to fur or skin or a shape that enables dispersion via wind or water. Seed dispersal by animals such as ants (myrmechory) has been recorded, as some species of sedges have developed elaiosomes at the base of the perigynia. Ants carry the perigynium back to the nest, use the elaiosome for food, and the seed germinates away from the parent plant. Perigynium vs. utricule The terms perigynium and utricle have been widely used interchangeably. In North America, the term perigynia is preferred, while utricle is more commonly used in Europe. After the merging of Kobresia under Carex, a terminological clarification was desired, as the open prophyll of Kobresia could not be assimilated to the concept of utricle, which etymologically implies closure. The authors of a 2016 paper recommended using perigynium to refer generically to the flower prophyll of Carex sensu lato (including former Kobresia), but calling it utricle when it has its margins fused so it is entirely closed (as in the vast majority of Carex species).

He is also the head chef and proprietor of the MacNean House and Restaurant. Maguire has published and launched several cookbooks and features regularly on television and radio in his native country. He writes a weekly column in the Irish Farmers Journal. Biography Neven Maguire was born to Joe and Vera Maguire. He began cooking at the age of twelve in the kitchen of his family restaurant, MacNean's in Blacklion, County Cavan. The restaurant, purchased by Joe in 1969, was to be greatly affected by The Troubles, being bombed twice and shutting down for more than a decade between 1976 and 1989. Maguire exited school following his Junior Certificate at the age of sixteen to pursue his love of cookery. He took over the business as Head Chef and Proprietor in 2003. Neven attended Enniskillen College of Food. Upon graduating from college, he worked in several Michelin starred restaurants in Europe. He commenced his overseas career in Berlin. Neven also worked in Roscoff Restaurant, Belfast, Northern Ireland (1 Michelin Star), The Grand Hotel Restaurant, Berlin, Germany (2 Michelin Stars), Lea Linster Restaurant, Luxembourg (2 Michelin Stars) and Arzac Restaurant, San Sebastian, Spain (3 Michelin Stars). Neven is married to Amelda. He is a father to twins born on 8 February 2012. Amelda went downhill and nearly died during labour after her heart failed. Media work Maguire is a regular contributor to The Marian Finucane Show on RT√â Radio 1 and also writes a weekly column and recipe in the Irish Farmers Journal. He has contributed recipes to the Mayo Advertiser. In 2009, he performed at the National Ploughing Championships in County Kildare at a stand sponsored by the newspaper.

Controversy Maguire was involved in a controversy in August 2009 when he appeared alongside the bikini-wearing model Georgia Salpa and a plate of food on the cover of Food & Wine magazine. A national radio debate on Liveline saw feminists object to the treatment of Georgia Salpa and the magazine's publisher apologised and admitted it had been an error which had occurred whilst she had been absent from work. One female caller suggested the photos were \\"evidence of a pernicious heteronormativity\\", whilst another complained that \\"women are here to please men and we're supposed to have these perfect bodies\\". Another caller also expressed disappointment: \\"I really don't see what this [bikini model] has to do with the pic . And I'm really disappointed with the women that they partake in this as well\\". Callers also expressed fears that the photos would lead to rape and the sexualisation of children. John Masterson, writing in the Irish Independent, accused Liveline of \\"manufacturing\\" the fight, called the radio show a \\"kangaroo-court\\" and questioned why football manager Giovanni Trapattoni (\\"who had one more model than Neven in the same paper\\") was not equally guilty according to the feminists. However, Catherine O'Mahony, writing in The Sunday Business Post, praised the apology given by the magazine publisher as the whole affair was \\"pretty embarrassing for everyone connected with it\\". Model Nadia Forde furthered the controversy by saying \\"I don't think any chef would make it into a newspaper on his own\\", causing upset in the Irish cooking community and leading chef Derry Clarke to respond with the remark: \\"We [chefs] don't need models to make the papers. I have been in plenty of papers without the help of models\\". Neven Maguire remained tightlipped on the issue. He was not paid for his involvement in the photo shoot and five other chefs were also present to be photographed.

It never possessed any legitimacy to operate in the United States.Questions swirling around jail deal from Billings Gazette The company's previous logo was an exact copy of the Serbian state coat of arms which caused some controversy and resulted in the Serbian government threatening legal action against APF if it did not remove or change the logo. In September 2009, US government contract databases showed no record of the company, while security industry representatives and federal officials said they had never heard of it. APF was registered as a corporation in California by convicted con man Michael Hilton on 2 March 2009.AMERICAN PRIVATE POLICE FORCE ORG INC. from California Secretary of State website However, the company did not have a business license to operate in California or Montana.

Taking over a Montana jail facility In 2009, APF was contracted to control and operate the Two Rivers Detention Facility, a prison facility which had been empty for over two years in Hardin, a town in Montana's Big Horn County. The contract was reportedly a 10-year, multimillion-dollar deal. According to a CBS News article, dated September 29, 2009, the APF was \\"a little known company which claims to specialize in training military and security forces overseas\\", which has \\"seemingly taken control of a $27 million, never-used jail, and a rural Montana town's nonexistent police force.\\" Following APF's Mercedes SUVs entering the community with \\"City of Hardin Police Department\\" stenciled on the side of its vehicles, a city official released a statement dismissing such accusations: \\"There are no commandos in the streets. There is no fence or gate being built around Hardin. People are free to come and go as they please. APF is not running our town or our police force.\\"Editorial: Short takes , The Roanoke Times, October 3, 2009. Retrieved October 3, 2009. The city of Hardin had no official police department, and traditionally relied on the Big Horn County Sheriffs department police protection. According to a reporter's blog dated October 1, 2009, on the USA Today website, it is unclear why and by which authority the APF had taken control over the empty jail facility.\\"What is the American Police Force and what is it doing in Montana?\\", USA Today, October 1, 2009 However, CNN had reported in April 2009 that Hardin city officials might invite and willingly host a Guantanamo Bay detention camp- style prison in order to improve the economic situation of the city, even though Senator Max Baucus of Montana opposed the idea and said that it would be a security risk. Steve Bullock, the Attorney General of Montana, investigated APF for possible violations of the Montana Unfair Trade Practices and Consumer Protection Act in connection with dubious statements on APF's website with regard to APF's operations and supposed contracts with the federal government. As the story unveiled, Serbian authorities stated that the coat of arms appearing in the APF logo was being used illegally and requested its removal \\\\- and a California attorney who worked with APF cut his ties to the project. Michael Cohen, a former supervisor for the Secret Service, was named by Michael Hilton as the future operations director for the jail facility.

Development  To provide a higher performance glider, to complement the W.W.S.1 Salamandra and W.W.S.2 ≈ªaba, Wac≈Çaw Czerwi≈Ñski designed an all wood glider with smooth lines derived from wind tunnel tests at the Lw√≥w Technical University. With a stiff structure optimised for higher speeds the W.W.S.3 had pleasant flying characteristics. The first prototype was built with two alternative tailplanes, one conventional with separate elevator, the other an all-flying surface, both of which were evaluated in airworthiness trials at the I.B.T.L. (Instytut Bada≈Ñ Technicznych Lotnictwa ‚Äì Institute of Aviation Technical Research) during 1937. Production aircraft were produced at W.W.S and at L.W.L.(Lw√≥wskie Warsztaty Lotnicze ‚Äì Lw√≥w Aviation Workshops) with the all-flying tail for pitch control. The cantilever gull wings were constructed as a divided pair, with diagonal supplementary spars and plywood skinned leading edge D torsion box. The fuselage was constructed as a semi-monocoque shell, with integral fin carrying the rudder and all-flying tailplane. A pneumatically-sprung nose skid formed the undercarriage. Production continued until the outbreak of World War II, with most aircraft being destroyed except for examples confiscated by the German and Soviet authorities. One example taken by German forces was left behind in Denmark at the end of the war, and refurbished for the Stamgruppen Gliding Club (regn OY-DYX), where it flew for several years.Cynk, Jerzy B.

A small minority also live in Odisha and West Bengal. History Asurs were one of the first settlers of Chotanagpur plateau and they are believed to be the founders of the Indus Valley Civilization. The word ‚ÄúAsur‚Äù finds mention in the Rigveda, the Puranas and other scriptures. Their language is Asuri, which is part of the Austroasiatic language family. In the excavations of Archaelogical Survey of India, many sites of ancient Asur civilization are found at Saridkhel, Kabrakala,etc of Jharkhand. Also the artifacts of neolithic and chalcolithic era were found including axe, utensils and furnaces of the Harappan period are found at the confluence of Son and North Koel river. Many burial sites were also found by archaelogists.  Occupation  Asurs are traditionally iron-smelters. They were once hunter gatherers, having also involved in shifting agriculture. However, majority of them shifted into agriculture with 91.19 percent enlisted as cultivators in the 2011 census. Their indigenous technology of iron smelting gives them a distinct identity; as they claim to have descended from the ancient Asuras who were associated with the art of metal craft. When smelting, the Asur women sing a song relating the furnace to an expectant mother encouraging the furnace to give a healthy baby, i.e., good quality and quantity of iron from the ore; and were thence, according to Bera, associated with the fertility cult. But now a days a major section of the population is also attached with mining work. Society The Asur society is divided into 12 clans. These Asur clans are named after different animals, birds and food grains. Family is second prominent institution after the clan. Except in emergency cases, they use traditional herbal medicines. They have their own community council (jati panch) where disputes are settled. They accept food from Rajputs, Oraon, Kharwar, Thakur, Ghasi, and few others; and maintain putative kinship ties with Kharwar, Munda and other neighbouring tribes. Except the burial site, they share all other public spaces with their neighbours. They live in pats (a clearing area) surrounded by the forest, and their houses are made of mud walls supported by wooden poles with a roof covered with paddy straw and self- baked khapras (tiles). Their houses consist of spaces for cattle and birds and a separate area for worship of ancestors. Utensils for cooking and storing water drawn from wells, are made of iron, aluminium and earthen ware. Traditional male clothing is dhoti while the females wear tattoo marks (depicting totemic objects) upon their bodies as ornaments. The females also wear other metal and non-metal ornaments as well as glass bangles. They use common agricultural implements for cultivation; and occasionally hunt game in the forest using bows and arrows. Divisions The modern Asur tribe is divided into three sub-tribal divisions, namely Bir (Kol) Asur, Birjia Asur and Agaria Asur. The Birjia are recognized as a separate as a Schedule Tribe. Religion The Asur religion is a mixture of animism, animatism, naturalism and ancestral worships. They also believe in black magic like bhut-pret (spirits) and witchcraft. Their chief deity is Singbonga. Amongst the other deities are Duari, Patdaraha and Turi Husid. They celebrate festivals like Sarhul, Karma, Dhanbuni, Kadelta, Rajj karma, Dasahara Karam. Many Asurs believe the Mahishasura is their benevolent ancestor, and mourn during the Durga Puja period for what they see as the unjust butchering of their ancestor. The veneration of Mahishasura has spread throughout the Munda tribes of West Bengal as well as Namasudras. Marriage Marriage is an important ritual and come essentially in the life of every individual. Only physically disabled are not able to get married. The Asur follow the rule of monogamy, but in case of barrenness, widower and widow hood, they follow the rule of bigamy or even Polygamy. Widow remarriages are permissible. Asurs have a custom of paying bride price. Pigs are an essential part of bride price. In addition, cash and clothes are also given. At the time of marriage, they follow the rule of tribe endogamy. Those who do not obey these rules are thrown out from the community but are allowed after paying seven times feast to the community members.  Challenges  Presently, the Asurs of Jharkhand are having many difficulties. They don't have access to proper basic amenities like health services, education, transportation, drinking water, etc. They are on the verge to become destitute because of the elimination of their traditional occupation iron-smelting. Their agricultural based economy is also in danger due to bauxite mining in the area. As a result, migration and displacement have become their major problems. There have been cases of human trafficking of the minor girls, poverty is a big reason behind it. These days a young Asur woman called Sushma Asur is striving hard to preserve art, culture and the existence of her community.

History  This sneaker was originally worn by NBA star George \\"The Iceman\\" Gervin which exposed NBA fans to the Nike brand for the first time. The original shoe was made out of three main components, the upper portion of the shoe was made up of leather, the tongue was made up of nylon and the mid sole consisted of rubber just like most sneakers use today. At this point in time, other sneaker giants were also breaking into the NBA with their own basketball sneakers and basketball stars to market them such as Julius Erving with Converse and Walt Frazier with Puma, so Nike definitely had competition in this space. Nevertheless, Nike was well prepared to compete with the other industry giants and that could be attributed to the fact that the Nike Blazer possessed the best technology for basketball shoes at the time. The Nike Blazer is still available in the sneaker market in a low and mid-top.  Nike SB  In 2005, one of Nike's spokespersons Lance Mountain released the Nike Blazer SB which was a design with new features such as a padded collar and insoles where Nike implemented their Zoom Air technology to accommodate skaters. The first Nike Blazer SB, released in May, carried a very dark look with an all black suede upper and a black mid-sole that was made thicker than what the original basketball shoe had. The swoosh and laces were a baroque brown which completed the first SB version of the Blazer. Therefore, although the Nike Blazer was originally created for the sport of basketball, since then it became a part of the Nike SB (Skateboarding) sub brand and is currently marketed towards the skateboarding community.  Collaborations  The Nike Blazer has remained relevant in today's sneaker culture, not only for skaters but also for everyday casual sneaker users. This could be directly attributed to the numerous collaborations Nike has done with other clothing brands to create new Blazer colorways.  Nike Blazer x Off-White  Off-White is an american luxury fashion brand founded in 2012. In September 2017, the first collaboration happened between the two and \\"The Ten\\" Nike Blazer came to be. This shoe has a white upper with an white/tan mid-sole all brought together by the black Nike Swoosh. In September 2018, Nike not only teamed up with Off- White again but also with Tennis superstar Serena Williams to create the \\"Queen\\". This shoe is the most colorful of all the shoes thus far, with a wolf grey upper while the heel and tongue are white. This shoe's mid-sole is pink and purple with a fade effect and a black swoosh. In October 2018, Nike and Off-white teamed up to create two Nike Blazers. The \\"All Hollows Eve\\" consists of a pale vanilla upper while the swoosh is in bright yellow-orange. The \\"Grim Reapers\\" consist of an 'clone black' while the mid-sole and upper toe is black, this shoe features orange accents in order to give it that classic Nike look.  Nike Blazer x Sacai  Sacai is a Japanese luxury brand founded in 1999. In May 2019, the two brands collaborated on the \\"Black Blue\\" which features most black upper while the eye-stays of the shoe is a university blue. It also features a university blue swoosh hidden behind a white swoosh. In addition to the \\"Black Blue\\", Sacai and Nike released the \\"Maize Navy\\" colorway in May 2019. This would be their most abstract colorway thus far, it's made up of a yellow upper with a white toe. It also features a varsity red swoosh with a navy blue swoosh hidden behind it. In October 2019, the two brands released the \\"White Grey\\" colorway of the Nike Blazer. This shoe is made up of an all white upper including the swoosh with small underlying wolf grey features such as the swoosh hidden behind the swoosh. Also in October 2019, the \\"Black Grey\\" colorway was released. The shoe is made up of an all black leather upper featuring a black swoosh which is accented by a grey swoosh that is hidden behind. The toe is grey while the mid-sole and laces are white. Overall, the four sneakers share an abstract look that suits Sacai's brand.  Nike Blazer x Stranger Things  Stranger Things is an american Netflix web series that was released during the Summer of 2016. In June 2019, the Netflix hit teamed up with Nike to create the \\"Hawkins High\\" colorway of the Nike Blazer, this was a part of a three-sneaker collection which included the Nike Cortez and Tailwind. This sneaker has a very retro look which suits the show's story line. It features an all white leather upper with a bright orange swoosh, the laces and mid-sole are also white and the entire shoe is highlighted by green accents on the tongue and heel. In July 2019, the two came together once again to release another three-sneaker collection, this one featured the \\"OG Collection\\" Nike Blazer. This sneaker is an eye-catching one with its all royal blue suede upper that is accented by a white leather swoosh that complements the white mid-sole and heel. The most recent three-sneaker collection came in August 2019 which includes the \\"Upside Down\\" Blazer. This sneaker is made up of a light tan mesh/canvas upper, it features a swoosh of the same color and material, making it hard to notice from afar. The shoe does feature a white mid-sole to match alongside the white laces.  Nike Blazer x Stussy  Stussy is an american clothing brand founded in the 1980's. In 2002 the two teamed up to create a unique sneaker that fits both brands' aesthetic feel. Two different colorways were released, one came in a navy blue with a pink Nike swoosh while the other was a wolf grey with an emerald green swoosh. In 2008, the two companies once again teamed up to release three new colorways of the Nike Blazer as a part of Stussy's Neighborhood Boneyard collection. This particular version of the Blazer featured a checkerboard on the upper portion of the shoe which came in blue, red and white versions.  Nike Blazer x Supreme  Supreme is an american skateboard shop and clothing brand that is very prominent in urban culture.

The \\"Sail\\" colorways also features the quilted stitching on the upper but is made up of all white leather which is supplemented by white laces. The swoosh is made up of the same snake-like pattern. Overall, a very a much more subtle sneaker than the \\"Varsity Red\\". The \\"Black\\" colorway just as the previous two sneakers, features the quilted stitching. The upper is made up of an all black leather upper with black shoelaces. While the mid-sole is white giving the sneaker some contrast. The swoosh is made up of the same snake-like pattern.

He now lives in Philadelphia with his wife, ceramic artist Sandrine Sheon. Confronting myths A recurring theme in Wald's work is to identify and confront myths, especially but not exclusively those that have come to surround prominent figures in popular music.This then is remarked upon by, among others, (1) Jonny Whiteside, Tonight at Book Soup: Elijah Wald Defends His Book, How the Beatles Destroyed Rock & Roll, L.A.

He was a pioneer in the Great Lakes shipping industry. Background Charles Magnus Lindgren was born near Dragsmark in Uddevalla Municipality in the traditional Province of Bohusl√§n, in V√§stra G√∂taland County, Sweden. He went to sea at the age of 14. In 1849, he went to the California gold fields where he engaged in the freight traffic. Career In 1852, Lindgren entered into a railway project together with the Bishop Hill Colony and settled in 1854 in Henry County, Illinois, a few miles from Galva. In 1856, Lindgren came to Chicago, bought a couple of freight vessels and contracted with a lumber company for shipping lumber from Michigan to Chicago.History of the Swedes of Illinois, Volume 1 (edited by Ernst Wilhelm Olson, Martin J. Engberg, Anders Sch√∂n. Engberg-Holmberg Publishing Company. 1908) In 1860 he engaged in shipping. He gradually added vessel after vessel until in 1870 he owned half a dozen ships with a combined tonnage of 4,500. Several of these were among the largest in the Great Lake trade at that time. In 1871, he had three more large freighters built at Manitowoc, Wisconsin. One of these, the schooner Christina Nilsson was named after Christina Nilsson, a world-renowned Swedish diva who had visited America that year.The History of the Christina Nilsson (University of Wisconsin Sea Grant Institute) Personal life In 1852, Lindgren returned to Sweden to marry Johanna Andersson. They subsequently returned to America arriving in Chicago. Lindgren was a philanthropic man who was particularly liberal toward the Swedish Methodist Church. When the Swedish Methodist Theological Seminary in Chicago (now Garrett-Evangelical Theological Seminary) was founded, Lindgren contributed generously toward its erection and maintenance.

It stars George Segal in the titular role, alongside Susan Anspach and Kris Kristofferson. Others in the cast include Mazursky, Marsha Mason and Shelley Winters. Plot Wandering alone around St. Mark's Square in Venice, Italy, where they first honeymooned, Stephen Blume wonders what possessed him to be unfaithful to his ex-wife Nina, a woman he continues to love in spite of himself. Through a series of extended flashbacks, he reflects on the aftermath of their breakup and divorce. Blume, a successful Beverly Hills divorce lawyer, had been caught by Nina while sleeping with his secretary at the home that he and Nina had shared. Nina promptly leaves him and, though Blume begins to date actively, he is unsatisfied and grows wistful of his married life. Meanwhile, Nina, a social worker, sets about a journey of self-discovery, trying out new experiences like yoga and taking up with a man 12 years her junior, Elmo, a free-spirited unemployed musician. Nevertheless, after their divorce, Blume discovers how much he loved Nina and he goes to great, sometimes humiliating, mostly futile lengths to win her back, complicated by the fact that he finds Elmo to be quite a nice guy. Though Nina remains rightfully skeptical of his motivations, Blume befriends the easygoing Elmo and the three form an unlikely if precarious friend group. One night Blume comes to Nina's house, ostensibly to see Elmo, but he isn't home. He and Nina begin talking, and Blume tells her he still loves her and wants her. She tells him to leave, but he forces himself on her. Elmo walks in on them and Nina tells Elmo that Blume raped her. Blume admits this and Elmo hits him, ending their friendship. Some time later Elmo comes to Blume's office to let him know that Nina is pregnant with Blume's baby. Elmo also tells Blume that he is leaving town because \\"it's time to go.\\" Blume goes to Nina and says he wants to help support the child, but she is hesitant. They stay in communication and eventually Nina tells Blume she wants him to leave town for two weeks so she can decide what she wants. We again see Blume in Venice, where he has gone for the two weeks. He sees Nina across the square and they go to each other.

Roger Ebert in his June 18, 1973 review in the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film four stars on a scale of four, proclaiming it to be \\"what everybody is always hoping for from Neil Simon: a comedy that transcends its funny moments, that realizes we laugh so we may not cry, and that finally is about real people with real desperations.\\" Vincent Canby of The New York Times described it on the same date as \\"a restless, appealing, sometimes highly comic contemporary memoir.\\" Richard Corliss of Film Comment praised Segal's performance, claiming that \\"No contemporary actor can touch George Segal for klutzy charm or a seriocomic capacity for suffering (he‚Äôs the Tom Ewell of the Seventies), and no film has used his manic copelessness as well as Blume in Love.\\" In an interview with Robert K. Elder for his book The Best Film You've Never Seen, director Neil LaBute explains his feelings on the film: ‚ÄúI was both intrigued and frustrated by what was happening. There‚Äôs this fractured telling of the story, several trips to Venice and the rest takes place in Venice, California.

The company began under the artistic direction of Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo dancers Yvonne Chouteau and Miguel Terekhov in the Science and Arts Foundation building on the Oklahoma City Fairgrounds, Founded in 1963, Oklahoma City Ballet has been the city's professional ballet company for over 40 years. It is the resident dance company of the Civic Center Music Hall and has 30 dancers from around the world. Led by Artistic Director Robert Mills, the company produces 5 main stage productions per season in Oklahoma City and tours across Oklahoma and the surrounding states. The Oklahoma City Ballet also participates in a number of community outreach projects designed to provide dance education and experience throughout central Oklahoma. History The company began in 1963 under the name Oklahoma City Civic Ballet, brought together by the foundation's civic ballet committee and chief benefactors, Mr. and Mrs. John E. Kirkpatrick. The Oklahoma City Ballet Society was incorporated in 1967 to support the company. That same year the Ballet joined the newly formed Arts Council of Oklahoma City and performed in the first Festival of the Arts, celebrating Oklahoma's 60th year of statehood. In 1970 the Board of Trustees formed a new group, Oklahoma City Metropolitan Ballet Society and with the generous support of Vernon Pellow, Sr. the company began as the Oklahoma City Metropolitan Ballet with Yvonne Chouteau staying on as founding artistic director. Ballerina and Oklahoma native Maria Tallchief worked together with Ms. Chouteau to audition dancers for the company. Yvonne Chouteau was succeeded by New York City Ballet principal dancers Conrad and Joy Ludlow, who directed the Company from 1973‚Äì1979. The Ludlow's founded the company's affiliate school and joined Oklahoma City's Allied Arts organization. During this time the Company and School used studios on the campus of Oklahoma City University and performed at the Kirkpatrick Theater also on the OCU campus. In 1979 American Ballet Theatre dancers Bojan Spassoff and Stephanie Wolf-Spassoff assumed direction of the Company. This was the beginning of the change from a civic company to a semi-professional company which was now performing three productions plus The Nutcracker in a season. In 1980 the company name was changed to Ballet Oklahoma and in the spring of 1981 the company moved into a newly renovated facility. The building was donated by Robert Hefner, III and a campaign to raise funds for renovations was chaired by Ann Simmons Alspaugh. Rand Elliott provided the architectural design and the renovations were completed by Bill McNatt Construction. In 1983 New York City Ballet dancer Edward Villella joined the company as artistic director and directed the company for three seasons, bringing the work of George Balanchine into the repertory. In 1986 Dallas Ballet dancers Bryan Pitts and Laura Flagg- Pitts joined the company as artistic director and assistant to the director respectively. During the Pitts‚Äô tenure, the company instituted its annual Artsreach program to bring students from across the state to the Civic Center for a live ballet performance. This program received the Governor's Arts Award in 1997. In 2008 the Board of Trustees appointed dancer, choreographer and former Ballet Nouveau Colorado director Robert Mills the new artistic director. That same year the name of the company was changed to Oklahoma City Ballet. In 2017 the name of the affiliate school was changed to The Oklahoma City Ballet Yvonne Chouteau School thanks to a generous endowment gift from Kirkpatrick Philanthropies. Also in 2017, the company moved into a new state of the art, 29,000 square foot facility designed by Allford Hall Monaghan Morris Architects. Performance Oklahoma City Ballet's repertory includes works by George Balanchine, Gerald Arpino, Anthony Tudor, Nacho Duato, Jiri Kylian, Twyla Tharp, Jessica Lang, Nicolo Fonte, Stanton Welch, Perrot, Coralli, Fokine, Petipa, Bournonville and Artistic Director Robert Mills. Oklahoma City Ballet has also presented special dance attractions as part of its role in serving the community. In the past, it has sponsored performances by Mikhail Baryshnikov, Rudolf Nureyev, the San Francisco Ballet, Hubbard Street Dance Chicago, and Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater. The Oklahoma City Ballet tours regionally and is the resident dance company of the Civic Center Music Hall in Oklahoma City. School The Oklahoma City Ballet Yvonne Chouteau School is Oklahoma's only American Ballet Theatre certified school and teaches the A.B.T National Training Curriculum. Its faculty have all trained within the curriculum and have passed examinations to become certified instructors of the curriculum The school trains students who wish to become professional ballet dancers, and recreational students. Students trained in the school have been regularly accepted into summer sessions and advanced classes at the School of American Ballet, Houston Ballet, Pacific Northwest Ballet, the San Francisco Ballet and others. Former students have gone on to professional careers with the American Ballet Theatre, Aspen/Santa Fe Ballet, Sacramento Ballet, David Parsons Dance and the Oklahoma City Ballet itself.

Mythology The group have also created a kind of personal mythology, reminiscent of George Clinton's Funkadelic and Parliament, some of which has been used in their recordings, sleevenotes and website. This includes a fabricated mythical language they call \\"Mung Su\\", various characters including a linguist named Ronald P. Hardaker, an allegedly ancient order of Knights called \\"The Knights of Jumungus\\", and numerous others based on occasional collaborators. On their website they have also initiated a Halo 3 Clan under the moniker of \\"The Noble Order of The Knights Of Jumungus\\" in order to perform battle reenactments from the artificial history of the Mungolians. They also have an alleged \\"Mungolian\\" providing them with a blog (\\"The Homunculus\\"), which is usually critical in tone of humanity and its pastimes, culture and various social and political machinations. In contrast, they also have a character named \\"The Dhaqwaan of Po-Lonte\\" who acts as official bard, scattering epigrams and short poems throughout their website and sleevenotes, as well as contributing \\"special poetry\\" to the track \\"Y Lentokone Mungo\\" on their second album, \\"We Gave It All Away... Now We Are Taking It Back\\". This poetry previously appeared as an untranslated sleevenote on their first album (which they often refer to as their \\"difficult third album\\", an asynchronous anomaly their mythology attributes to DJ Strangefruit's ability to bend time through the use of his turntables), \\"Beauty Came To Us In Stone.\\" No translation of this text has yet been supplied, although they collectively maintain there is one in existence. Occasionally, mention is made of a \\"mad Irish writer\\" who collaborates with them. Credits on their second and third albums suggest this writer may be named \\"Dave Mullan,\\" but as no confirmation or denial has been issued by either the band or the writer, this cannot be stated with certainty. The sleevenotes included on their most recent album, \\"Mungodelics\\", is presumably from the same source as the rest of their mythology, but as there is no accreditation, it remains uncertain. Cover artwork The artwork of their second and third albums (\\"We Gave It All Away ... Now We Are Taking It Back\\" and \\"Schlungs!\\") and many of the releases of DJ Strangefruit's own record label, Luna Flicks, was created by Suzie Webb, an English expatriate artist and designer living in Oslo, Norway. For their fourth album (\\"Mungodelics\\"), the cover was designed by Kim Hiorth√∏y, who has designed many of the album covers for the label Smalltown Supersound. Beauty Came To Us In Stone This album is a collective effort, guided by P√•l Nyhus and Reidar Skaar primarily, with some contributions from Knut S√¶vik. Initially a commissioned jazz album for Bugge Wesseltoft's Jazzland Recordings label, it soon evolved from the tribute to electric era Miles Davis it was intended to be into a densely woven pastiche of innumerable elements. We Gave It All Away ... Now We Are Taking It Back Their second album moved away from the Jazz-based sound of its predecessor, and saw Knut S√¶vik take a leading role in the group, effectively replacing Reidar Skaar. The more club-oriented sound also meant the band moved from Jazzland Recordings to Smalltown Supersound, a label whose roster and aesthetic seemed to be a better home for the Psychedelic Disco music they were aiming to create. The album consists of a few original tracks interspersed with tracks that began as remixes of others, but were remixed a second or even third time to create a more consistent sound. The album covers two CDs with 8 tracks per disk, and each disk timed at 59 minutes and 15 seconds. Schlungs! Their third album took a different approach from its predecessors in that some of the material had a distinct element of pop music. While the psychedelic aspects were to the fore on some tracks, traditional disco played a major role, particularly in tracks such as \\"Bella Lanay\\", \\"We Are The Shining\\" (a commentary on the use of Illuminati imagery in mainstream pop), and \\"Ties n Downs\\". Critical opinion was sharply divided by these \\"lighter\\" moments, where, for example, Pitchfork said \\"Here, the music frequently scales down to more human dimensions, at which point the silliness starts to resemble that of real humans: flushed with an over- enthusiastic pleasure you can observe but not share, and at times a bit uncomfortable to be in the same room as\\". By contrast, Resident Advisor said \\"'Schlungs' scans more like the art-pop of 10cc's 'How Dare You' than an introverted journey like 'The Wall'. This is due in no small part to the inclusion of 'Bella Lenay'\\" [sic]. However, the album was a commercial success, and paved the way for a rapid follow-up. Mungodelics The fourth album marked a return to the remix-revised/reclaimed aesthetic of their second album, this time adding some original pieces, and some pieces by spin-off project, The Knights Of Jumungus (originally a Halo Clan). The overall tone is heavier than releases since their debut for Jazzland Recordings. Reviews were generally positive, although some (e.g. exclaim.ca) felt that the band were repeating themselves. However, Allmusic.com said \\"Above all, Mungodelics practically bubbles with undisguised joy in the moment, a pleasure in activity, and the possibilities they explore\\" which is a common theme in most reviews. Work in progress The band are working on a fifth album, as yet untitled. The only information thus far available suggests that it will be a full studio album, containing some retro-thematic concepts that go far beyond the 60s/70s/80s references they have littered their work with, music that stretches their already expansive sampling and stylistic composing, and most indications suggest a heightened presence of the \\"excess\\" that has come to define them above all other considerations. The album will be a direct follow- on from \\"Schlungs\\" in the same way that \\"Mungodelics\\" followed \\"We Gave It All Away ... Now We Are Taking It Back\\".

Her mother, Margrethe Vinhofvers, is known to have had a position at the work house's staff. She married David Schumacher (d. 1650) in Holstein, had a daughter in 1640 and returned to Denmark in the late 1640s with her lover Lieutenant J√∏rgen Walter (d. 1670). She, her mother and daughter lived with the silk manufacturer Samson Gertzen and supported herself by silk ironing, but was also pointed out as a prostitute.  Corfitz affair  In 1650, she reported a plan to assassinate the king. She pointed out Corfitz Ulfeldt as the father of the child she expected. She also claimed to have overheard a conversation between Ulfeldt and his wife Leonora Christina Ulfeldt (1621‚Äì1698) in which them reportedly spoke of their plans to poison King Frederick III (1609‚Äì1670). Leonora Christina Ulfeldt was an illegitimate daughter of King Christian IV of Denmark (1577‚Äì1648), and half-sister of Frederick III J√∏rgen Walter, the probable father of her child, who had become a favorite of the king and became ennobled in 1649, presented her accusations before the monarch. Walter is also believed to have been the one who instigated her to put forward her accusation to limit the influence of Ulfeldt, whose position was already risky because of his tense relationship with the king: Walter was close to the Danish-Holstein nobleman Christian Rantzau (1614‚Äì1663), who was an opponent of Ulfeldt. The accusation was put forward at a point when Ulfeldt's professional conduct was already under investigation. However, the accusations were kept secret by the king, who wished to examine them quietly. In 1651, Walter was appointed councillor, which can be seen as a sign that the king had taken the accusations seriously. Vinhofvers now met Leonora Christina and Ulfeldt's priest and confessor Simon Hennings (d. 1661) and told them that Walter had plans to assassinate the Ulfeldt couple. Ulfeldt informed the king, who had Vinhofvers imprisoned at Copenhagen Castle and made the affair public. She retracted her former accusation against Ulfeldt during questioning, and claimed that the accusations had been fabricated by Walter. Ulfeldt was freed by the court and secretly left Denmark (14 July 1651) with his family. But Dina Vinhofvers was sentenced to death for her first accusation. She was decapitated in the summer of 1651 outside Copenhagen Castle.  In literature  The entire affair is the subject of Maria Edgeworth's story \\"The Conspiracy,\\" first published in her Tales of Real Life (1810). Dina Vinhofvers was the subject of Dina, a tragic play written in 1842 by Adam Oehlenschl√§ger (1779‚Äì1850). Danish author Ebbe Kl√∏vedal Reich (1940-2005) also included portions of her story in his publication Rejsen til Messias (Copenhagen: Gyldendal. 1974).

His grandfather was Archdeacon Robert Johnson, who founded Oakham and Uppingham Schools in Rutland.www.british- history.ac.uk After being educated at Emmanuel College, Cambridge (matriculating 1614, graduating B.A. 1617 and proceeding M.A. 1621) where a relative, Dr Laurence Chadderton, was inaugural Master, he was admitted to Gray's Inn in 1620. Johnson was then, on 27 May 1621, ordained a priest in the Church of England by Dr Thomas Dove, Bishop of Peterborough. The Archdeacon settled upon his grandson the manor of Clipsham after his marriage in 1623 to Lady Arabella Clinton, second daughter of the 3rd Earl of Lincoln, whose brother (the 4th Earl) was a leading proponent of the Puritan colonisation of America. Life Johnson was the largest shareholder of the Massachusetts Bay Company and was one of the twelve signatories to the Cambridge Agreement on 29 August 1629. In 1630 he sailed with the Winthrop Fleet to America, arriving at Salem on 12 June. He was then one of the four founding patrons of the First Church at Charlestown on 30 July 1630 and provided the land for King's Chapel Burying Ground.Irons, p. 86, notes that, \\"Most likely\\" he had gone to Charlestown for [a] Meeting, had died there and was buried with his wife at Salem. But so much romance has been woven round the original foundation of Boston that it is now very hard to ascertain the actual facts: yet it appears certain that Isaac Johnson however he may have visited the place and suggested its name never actually dwelt there and most certainly did not die nor was buried there.\\" Revd William Blackstone, his university contemporary, invited Johnson to Shawmut (now Boston), for which he then provided the finance. At a Charlestown meeting shortly before he died, Revd Johnson renamed the settlement, previously known as Shawmut or Trimountain (on account of three contiguous hills which appear in a range when viewed from Charlestown), as Boston, after the port town in Lincolnshire in England where he lived with his wife before emigrating and his friend, Revd John Cotton, was Vicar of St Botolph's, Boston.Irons, p.86 He died at Charlestown on 30 September 1630, the richest man in the colony. The \\"Admiral\\" (a ship in the Winthrop Fleet) was renamed Arbella after his wife, Lady Arabella Johnson, who predeceased him at Salem by one month.Hubbard says ‚ÄúAmong others that were at that time visited with mortal sickness, the Lady Arabella, wife of Mr. Isaac Johnson, was one who, possibly, had not taken the counsel of our Savior to sit down and count the cost, before she began to build. For, coming from a paradise of plenty and pleasure, which she enjoyed in the family of a noble earldom, into a wilderness of wants, it proved too strong a temptation for her; so that the virtues of her mind were not able to stem the tide of those many adversities of her outward condition, which she, soon after her arrival, saw herself surrounded with. For, within a short time after, she ended her days at Salem, where she first landed; leaving her husband, a worthy gentleman of note for piety and wisdom, a sorrowful mourner, and so overwhelmed with grief, that about a month after, viz. September 30, 1630, death carried him after her into another world, to the extreme loss of the whole plantation.‚Äù See also * New England Colonies References * Category:1601 births Category:1630 deaths Category:People from South Luffenham Category:People from Rutland Category:Alumni of Emmanuel College, Cambridge Category:17th-century English Anglican priests Category:American Puritans Category:New England Puritanism Category:Kingdom of England emigrants to Massachusetts Bay Colony Category:People of colonial Massachusetts Category:Burials in Boston ","title":"Isaac Johnson (colonist)"},{"id":"24539720","text":"The Manufactured Superstars are an electronic dance music DJ/production duo from Denver, Colorado consisting of Bradley Roulier and Shawn Sabo.

History According to information provided for a historic driving tour,Mark's Creek \\"Step Back In Time Tour\\", 2008. in the early 19th century the land was owned by Moses Mordecai, a prominent Raleigh lawyer and landowner in Wake and Johnston counties. Before he died, he willed the property to his daughter Ellen, who could take ownership of the land at age 21, but only if she was married. At age 21 she was still unmarried, so the property was sold in 1850 to newlyweds James Stallings and Elizabeth Jones, who built the present house and operated the farm. By 1860 the Stallings owned , on which they raised livestock and grew corn, peas, beans, oats, and sweet potatoes. The town of Stallings Station, present-day Clayton, was named for James Stallings. In 1904, the property was sold to Ashley Horne, a state legislator, co-founder of NC College of Agricultural and Mechanical Arts (now North Carolina State University), and unsuccessful candidate for governor. Horne did not live at Bend of the River but rented it and leased the timber rights. Several owners later, the house was restored and listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

United States, 450 U.S. 544 (1981), was a Supreme Court case that addressed two issues: (1) Whether the title of the Big Horn Riverbed rested with the United States, in trust for the Crow Nation or passed to the State of Montana upon becoming a state and (2) Whether Crow Nation retained the power to regulate hunting and fishing on tribal lands owned in fee-simple by a non- tribal member.. First, the Court held that Montana held title to the Big Horn Riverbed because the Equal Footing Doctrine required the United States to pass title to the newly incorporated State. Second, the Court held that Crow Nation lacked the power to regulate nonmember hunting and fishing on fee-simple land owned by nonmembers, but within the bounds of its reservation. More broadly, the Court held that Tribes could not exercise regulatory authority over nonmembers on fee-simple land within the reservation unless (1) the nonmember entered a \\"consensual relationship\\" with the Tribe or its members or (2) the nonmember's \\"conduct threatens or has some direct effect on the political integrity, the economic security, or the health or welfare of the tribe.\\" The Supreme Court in Montana v. United States set a precedent which resulted in a wave of litigation challenging not only the exercise of tribal court authority over non-members, but the very existence of that authority. Background In October 1973, the Crow Tribal Council enacted Resolution Tribal Edict No. 74-05, to restrict fishing in response to increasing food prices and tribal enrollment, coupled with decreasing supplies of fish and game on the reservation. In May 1974, James Junior Finch, a non-tribal member, went fishing, in open defiance of the tribal resolution. Charges were filed against Finch in district court. In September, District Court Judge James Battin ruled (for the moment) that the Bighorn riverbed was held in trust by the United States for the tribe. This ruling was consistent with one he made three years earlier, declaring in 1971 that, since the U.S. did not expressly withhold the riverbed in any of the Fort Laramie treaties, it gave the tribes \\"absolute right of use over the area described.\\" In that ruling Battin made note that the Crow reservation was superimposed on traditional Crow territory. In April 1975, Battin overruled the decision he made 8 months earlier. He now decided that the riverbed in question was owned by the state. He asserted that the tribe did not have the \\"exclusive right to fish\\" since the first Fort Laramie Treaty in 1851 only referred to fishing as a \\"mere privilege\\" and the 1868 Fort Laramie Treaty \\"does not contain any reference to fishing.\\" Battin further concluded that the tribe lacked sufficient sovereignty to regulate non-members from fishing and hunting on the reservation. \\"The blunt fact‚Ä¶is that an Indian tribe is sovereign to the extent the United States permits it to be -- neither more nor less.\\" Days after this decision, the tribe approved a special ordinance and resolution in response to Battin's ruling and reasserted their authority to regulate non-members' sporting activities on tribal land, empowering tribal game wardens and police to arrest non-members going on the reservation to boat, fish, trap, or hunt. They also appealed Battin's decision to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. Chairman Patrick Stands Over Bull, Thomas Lynaugh (attorney), and eighteen other delegates went to D.C. to \\"argue their case\\" to the government. The tribe felt that Battin's ruling undermined their sovereignty as well as threatened future coal production and water rights. In December 1976, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals reversed Judge Battin's decision. Judge Anthony Kennedy held that the riverbed fell within the boundaries of the reservation and was therefore owned by the U.S. and the Crow Tribe. Kennedy also made reference to the Fort Laramie treaties, stating that the establishment of the reservation was to provide a permanent homeland for the people and that they had every right to the resources contained within it. Kennedy applied traditional canons of Indian law by stating that the negotiations of the two treaties had no other meaning to the natives other than the fact that the \\"government recognized all lands within the metes and bounds of the reservation were theirs.\\" In July 1978, on remand, Battin once again ruled in favor of the state, concluding that the U.S. did not reserve the river bed for the tribe, that the \\"Crow tribe was not indigenous historically to either Montana or Wyoming,\\" that they were a nomadic people with origins in Canada. Despite testimony from Joe Medicine Crow and Henry Old Coyote supporting the fact that Crows routinely fished and often supplemented their diet with fish, Battin concluded that \\"fishing was not central to the Crow diet.\\" Battin then addressed the issue of whether or not the State has power to regulate hunting and fishing by non- members within reservation limits. Again, Battin ruled in favor of the state, holding that Montana did have authority to regulate non-members on the river and on all non-Indian fee land within the reservation. Battin also concluded that the state had \\"concurrent jurisdiction\\" with the U.S. to regulate these activities on tribal land if the activities violated state law. Battin addressed tribal rights by stating that, while they retain the right to give permission to non-members to hunt and fish on tribal lands, tribes do not have the power to regulate non-members unless specifically granted by an \\"act of Congress,\\" referring to Oliphant v. Suquamish.. In June 1979, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals unanimously overturned Battin's ruling, holding that the river (bed and banks) was held by the United States in trust for the Crow tribe. Addressing the emergent regulatory issues, they ruled that the tribal resolution 74-05 was invalid only when it came to \\"resident non-members\\" on fee land that they personally owned, and that the resolution was valid when it came to regulating \\"non-resident non-member owners of land and resident non- members on any other territory\\" within the reservation. The tribe could regulate both members and non-members as long as the non-members were not subjected to criminal sanctions and the process was carried out in a non- discriminatory fashion, consistent with conservation principles. Both parties were dissatisfied with the decision and both petitioned for a rehearing, but both of these petitions were denied. In April 1980, the U.S. Supreme Court granted the state of Montana's petition for certiorari. In the ensuing briefings, Montana's attorneys argued that lands under navigable waters on federal land were supposed to be held in trust by the U.S. for the State. States are considered to have \\"equal footing\\" in this regard. They argued that the tribe held no authority to regulate non-members on non-Indian lands within the reservation and that the \\"allotment legislation\\" voided any treaty-based authority given to the tribe. They supported these claims with the Oliphant case, which denied tribes inherent sovereign authority to exercise criminal jurisdiction over non-Indians. The U.S. and Crow attorneys contended that the U.S. appropriated the land in question prior to statehood for the benefit of the Crow tribe and that the tribe did not expressly cede the rights in question in any treaty. They urged that the Allotment acts did not in any way change or \\"dilute\\" treaty rights. Opinion of the Court Seal of the Supreme Court of the United States In this case, the Supreme Court ruled on two issues: (1) Who held title of the Big Horn Riverbed and (2) Whether Tribes retained regulatory authority over hunting and fishing on reservation land owned in fee-simple by non-Indians. First, the Court resolved whether title of the Big Horn Riverbed remained with the United States, held in trust for the Crow Tribe, or was transferred to the State of Montana when it was admitted to the Union. The Court found the title belonged to Montana.450 U.S. at 550‚Äì52. Since the federal government, \\"[a]s a general principle,\\" transfers title for navigable waterways to States upon incorporation, the equal footing doctrine requires that Montana retain the same right to title for navigable waters within the geographic boundaries as other states.450 U.S. at 551. While the Second Treaty of Fort Laramie conveyed land to the Crow Tribe, setting it \\"apart for the absolute and undisturbed use and occupation of the Indians,\\" it did not explicitly refer to the riverbed.e \\"set apart for the absolute and undisturbed use and occupation of the Indians herein named....\\" 450 U.S. at 553 (quoting Second Treaty of Fort Laramie, May 7, 1868, Art. II, 15 Stat. 650.) Therefore, the Treaty language cannot overcome the presumption that title passed to the State of Montana.450 U.S. at 554‚Äì57. Second, analogizing to Oliphant's holding in the context of criminal jurisdiction, the Court held that Tribes do not have inherent sovereign power to exercise civil jurisdiction over activities occurring on fee-simple reservation land owned by nonmembers unless (1) the nonmembers have entered \\"consensual relationships with the tribe or its members, through commercial dealing, contracts, leases, or other arrangements\\"450 U.S. at 565. or (2) the nonmember's \\"conduct threatens or has some direct effect on the political integrity, the economic security, or the health or welfare of the tribe.\\"450 U.S. at 566. The Court found that nonmember hunters and fishers on fee-simple land neither entered consensual relationships with the tribe nor threatened the political or economic integrity of the Tribe.450 U.S. at 566‚Äì67. Therefore, the Tribe could not regulate nonmember hunting and fishing practices on fee-simple land within the reservation. Dissent Harry Blackmun's dissenting opinion, with William Brennan and Thurgood Marshall joining, addresses the issue of the canons of construction regarding treaties. > Only two years ago, this Court reaffirmed that the terms of a treaty between > the United States and an Indian tribe must be construed \\"in the sense in > which they would naturally be understood by the Indians.\\" As in any case > involving the construction of a treaty, it is necessary at the outset to > determine what the parties intended. ...With respect to an Indian treaty, > the Court has said that \\"the United States, as the party with the > presumptively superior negotiating skills and superior knowledge of the > language in which the treaty is recorded, has a responsibility to avoid > taking advantage of the other side.\\" ...In holding today that the bed of the > Bighorn River passed to the State of Montana upon its admission to the > Union, the Court disregards this settled rule of statutory construction. > Because I believe that the United States intended, and the Crow Nation > understood, that the bed of the Big Horn was to belong to the Crow Indians, > I dissent from so much of the Court's opinion as hold otherwise. As in any > case involving the construction of a treaty, it is necessary at the outset > to determine what the parties intended. ...the Crow were assured in 1867 > that they would receive \\"a tract of your country as a home for yourselves > and children forever, upon which your great Father [sic] will not permit the > white man to trespass.\\" Rebutting the 'equal footing' argument, the dissent in part II states: > ...it defies common sense to suggest that the Crow Indians would have so > understood the terms of the Fort Laramie Treaties. In negotiating the 1851 > treaty, the United States repeatedly referred to the territories at issue as > 'your country,' as 'your land,' and as 'your territory.' ...It is hardly > credible that the Crow Indians who heard this declaration would have > understood that the United States meant to retain the ownership of the > riverbed that ran through the very heart of the land the United States > promised to set aside for the Indians and their children 'forever.' Indeed, > Chief Blackfoot, when addressed by Commissioner Taylor, responded: 'The > Crows used to own all this Country including all the rivers of the West.' > Id., at 88. (Emphasis added.) The conclusion is inescapable that the Crow > Indians understood that they retained the ownership of at least those rivers > within the metes and bounds of the reservation [450 U.S. 544, 579] granted > them. This understanding could only have been strengthened by the reference > in the 1868 treaty to the mid-channel of the Yellowstone River as part of > the boundary of the reservation; the most likely interpretation that the > Crow could have placed on that reference is that half the Yellowstone > belonged to them, and it is likely that they accordingly deduced that all of > the rivers within the boundary of the reservation belonged to them. > In fact, any other conclusion would lead to absurd results. The dissent thus stands firmly against the majority's \\"silent nullification\\" of the treaties in its \\"equal footing\\" argument that there was a \\"strong presumption\\" that the federal government held lands under navigable waters in trust for the states rather than the tribes. Effects Montana State Flag Montana v. United States is a critical case because, in part, it left behind a \\"cauldron of confusion\\" regarding jurisdiction. The opinion states that tribes \\"inherent sovereign power to exercise some forms of civil jurisdiction over non-Indians on their reservations, even on non-Indian fee lands. A tribe may regulate, through taxation, licensing, or other means, the activities of nonmembers who enter consensual relationships with the tribe or its members, through commercial dealing, contracts, leases, or other arrangements.\\" In addition, tribes retain \\"inherent power to exercise civil authority over the conduct of non-Indians on fee lands within its reservation when that conduct threatens or has some direct effect on the political integrity, the economic security, or the health or welfare of the tribe.\\" Since the court decision in 1981, it has been used many times as an important precedent. Shortly after the Montana decision was made, the Court used it in both National Farmers Union Ins. Co. v. Crow Tribe (1985). and Iowa Mutual Ins. Co. v. LaPlante (1987).. Both cases were related to tribal power, and the Court relied on Montana to rule that \\"tribal inherent powers do not extend beyond what is necessary to protect tribal self-government or to control internal relations.\\" These decisions dictate that a nonmember of the tribe can enter \\"federal court to challenge tribal court jurisdiction over them, usually after they've first 'exhausted' tribal court remedies.\\" The Montana decision was used again in the Atkinson Trading Company v. Shirley (2001). to strike down a tax imposed on non-tribal members for operating a hotel on lands owned by the Navajo Reservation. The ruling has created problems for the courts since it was made. In the 1997 court case Strate v. A-1 Contractors,. the Montana ruling was used to determine that tribal courts did not have the authority to listen to a case that involved an accident involving two non-tribal members on the reservation. The Montana case outlined the principles on tribal sovereignty, especially over issues relating to non-tribal members. The ruling made in the Montana- Strate-Atkinson is derived from the Oliphant ruling, and shows the inherent tribal civil jurisdictional powers. The Montana ruling continues to be applied. In 2005 an on-duty police officer died in a single car accident when the officer's Ford Expedition rolled over on a tribally maintained road. It was a single car accident, and the car allegedly rolled over due to a product defect. The Ford Motor Company entered federal court looking to challenge the issue of tribal jurisdiction in this case. The Montana ruling was applied, and neither of its two exceptions were found to apply, because there were no consensual relations between the tribe and the Ford Motor Company, and the security of the nation was not at stake. This is just one example of how the Montana ruling is still being applied in 21st century court cases. Legacy The Montana case has been cited hundreds of times in the lower courts with mixed outcomes. An important part of the Montana ruling is the ability of the tribes to regulate all activity related to tribal interests under the first \\"direct effects\\" exception. To the chagrin of the State of Montana, the \\"direct effects\\" exception was used by the Ninth Circuit to uphold the substantive authority of the Confederated Salish & Kootenai Tribe to set water standards on the reservation that had the effect of imposing obligations on non-Indians living off the reservation upstream. A vital part of the Montana ruling is the ability of tribes to regulate consensual activity under the second exception. This exception permitted the tribal courts of the Mississippi Choctaw Band to hear a case in which a non-Indian employee of a Dollar General retail store was accused of committing a tort against a teenage tribal member.Dolgencorp, Inc. v. Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians, 746 F.3d 167, (5th Cir. 2014), affirmed sub. nom. by an equally divided court, Dollar Gen. Corp. v. Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians, 579 U.S. ___ , 135 S. Ct. 2159 (June 23, 2016) (per curiam). These two exceptions have been addressed many times by the courts since the ruling was made in 1981, and will continue to be used in nearly every case which involves the jurisdiction of the tribes over non-tribal members.

In October 2009, Bedford Borough Council launched a consultation on the future of special education provision in the borough. The consultation included options to merge Ridgeway School with the nearby Grange School on the Ridgeway site. Another proposal involved merging the two schools with St John‚Äôs School to create one special school for the whole of the Borough of Bedford. In January 2010, Bedford Borough Council confirmed its intention to merge Ridgeway School and Grange School on the Ridgeway site in the next few years. The new combined school was planned to be rebuilt to accommodate the broader range of pupils. However, in March 2013 Grange School converted to academy status and the move is on hold. Three new classrooms were constructed at Ridgeway School for use at the start of September 2013. The classrooms are primarily used for sixth form classes. Academics The school is organised into two departments, which fit the traditional school transfer age from primary to secondary education. The Primary Department covers Early Years education, Key Stage 1 and Key Stage 2 (ages 3 ‚Äì 11), whilst the Secondary Department covers Key Stage 3, Key Stage 4 and Post 16 education (ages 11 ‚Äì 19).

Family background and early life Sadhu Singh Saini was born on 6 June 1905, at Chakk No. 7, a village in Saini Bar region of Lyallpur district (now in Pakistan). His father was Bhai Ran Singh and mother Mai Atam Kaur. There were about 15 exclusively Saini owned villages in Saini Bar settlement and all of them had relocated there from Doaba and Gurdaspur region. The villages were named as Chakks and each Chakk had number allotted to them in official records, though some of them were named after predominant clan names or village head, examples being Chakk Naura-Bhaura and Chak Bhola. Chaudhari Bhola Ram Saini of Chakk 178 was the Zaildar of the entire Saini Bar region in Lyallpur (now Faisalabad) district of British Punjab. During the partition of Punjab, his family migrated from the Saini Bar settlement of Lyallpur to east Punjab. He was highly educated and he could speak and write 7 languages, namely Hindi, English, Urdu, French, Arbi and Punjabi. He always encouraged everyone to do the highest level of education. He loved music as well and got his eldest daughter to master in Sitar from Lucknow university. His youngest born Dr. Balbir Singh Bhaura who is an eye surgeon in Jalandhar presently, runs a free eye camp every year on the death anniversary of his father.  Political background  After matriculating from Khalsa High School, Lyallpur (where Master Tara Singh, later a leading figure in Sikh politics, was the headmaster), he joined police service and served at Quetta from 1923 to 1925 before resigning to take part in the Akali agitation for Gurdwara reform. From 1926 to 1928, he studied at the Shahid Sikh Missionary College, Amritsar, to train as a missionary. From 1928 to 1964, he headed the Sikh preaching centres at Aligarh and Hapur, in Uttar Pradesh, where he is said to have initiated nearly half a million persons according to Sikh rites, among them mostly Vanjara Sikhs of Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan. He was a member of the executive committee of the Shiromani Akali Dal from 1955 to 1960 and took part in several of the political agitations launched by the party. He was Jathedar of Takhat Sri Kesgarh, Anandpur Sahib, from 1961 to 1964.  Elevation as Jathedar of Akal Takth  In 1964, Sadhu Singh Bhaura was elevated to the position of Jathedar of Sri Akal Takht, the highest seat of religious authority and legislation for the Sikhs. He attracted wide public notice when, on 10 June 1978, he issued a hukamnama or edict calling upon all Sikhs to boycott socially the neoNirankari sect. In 1980, Jathedar Sadhu Singh Bhaura, in an effort to avert a vertical split in the Akali Dal, formed a seven member committee of senior party leaders to function as collegiate executive, but soon after himself resigned on health grounds and retired to live with his sons in Jalandhar where he died on 7 March 1984.

This motor was based on previous models KE-7 Lightning and KF-7 Super 10. Upgrades included redesigned connecting rods, upgraded aluminum clamp and swivel brackets, a new high RPM magneto, improved porting, an 8 Reed valve cage (as opposed to KE-7 and KF-7‚Äôs 4) and larger crankcase opening. Hurricane was also advertised at 10 hp*, way below the actual horsepower developed, Mercury noted this asterisk by stating that horsepower varies with rpm; really the Hurricane could deliver up to 18 hp. Shortly after the introduction of the Hurricane, Mercury came up with their first performance gear case with the capability of mating to a standard driveshaft housing of a KG-7 or similar green top engine of the time. This was named ‚ÄúQuicksilver‚Äù and promised an extra 20 to 30% increase in top speed. Essentially, it boasted a significantly slimmer pointed gear case that housed an integrated rubber rotex water pump and forward only 1:1 gears along with the necessary bearings. After a few months of use, Mercury found that the average race boat's transom would not elevate the standard driveshaft housing and quicksilver gear case high enough for peak performance. Rectifying this problem, Mercury developed the Quicksilver driveshaft housing. This new driveshaft housing was three inches shorter which in turn lowered the motor's center of gravity on the boat which helped turning ability, reduced the strain on the boat's transom and motor's clamp brackets, and decreased underwater drag while increasing top speed as less gearcase was below the boat. In addition the motor had a sort-of cut down lower anti-cavitation plate, protruding forward upper anti-cavitation plate (spray plate), a stronger rear- mounted steering bar design, and finally, an exhaust opening above the water surface that reduced exhaust back pressure while increasing noise levels when the boat was on plane. When the dealer installed the quicksilver driveshaft housing and gear case (packaged at $82.25) he had authorization to hand stamp a small \\"Q\\" behind the serial numbers on the tag and block. Some did, some did not ‚Äì and so, the \\"Stamped Q\\" came to be. 1951 saw the first production race- ready outboard models; KG-4Q, KG7-Q, and KG-9Q. These motors were pulled off the production line at random, given the quicksilver gear case, driveshaft housing, and \\"Q\\" stamp behind the tag serial number and block serial number. These KG-7Qs worked fine on runabouts but were too long for hydroplanes ‚Äì and the racers made this known to Mercury. So thus was born the 2\\" shorter \\"H\\" driveshaft housing in 1952. Right before Mercury released this \\"H\\" driveshaft housing, they still had several \\"Q\\" length driveshaft housings, so they introduced a factory KG-7Q which had a green silk screened Q behind the serial number on the tag and a factory stamped \\"Q\\" on the block. These motors are very rare; they fall into the serial range of 532404-532963. Continued interest Today many Mercury KG-7Q Super 10 Hurricane's have survived the years, many are still raced at local Antique Outboard Motor Club, Inc. (AOMCI) Events. In demand and also rare; today a KG-7Q will go for the price of a brand new 10 hp motor.

It involved two steam hauled passenger trains of the narrow gauge heritage Radebeul‚ÄìRadeburg railway (German: L√∂√ünitzgrundbahn). One hundred and twenty-one people were injured, four of them seriously. Substantial damage was sustained by the locomotives and rolling stock. Background On the weekend of 12‚Äì13 September 2009, the gauge L√∂√ünitzgrundbahn was holding a gala to celebrate the 125th anniversary of the opening of the railway. Four train compositions (three of them were extra trains from various other narrow-gauge railways) were operating on the line as part of the gala, performing fifty-five train journeys on the line instead of the usual twenty-eight. Some of the trains were assembled to represent distinct periods in the railway's history, one of them recreating a train from 1955 used rolling stock from the Mansfelder Bergwerksbahn in Saxony-Anhalt. The last and a resident train were later involved in the head-on collision. Another accident had already happened earlier the afternoon. A double-headed train hauled by Saxon-Meyer 0-4-4-0Ts Nos.145 and 176 was in collision with a BMW car at an open level crossing in Radebeul. The result of this accident was that the planned timetable had to be abandoned. The L√∂√ünitzgrundbahn is single track with passing loops at some stations. Because of the schedule disruption, trains were not passing each other at the planned locations. Accident Friedewald station near the collision site At 17:45 local time, two passenger trains were involved in a head-on collision on the single track at between Friedewald Haltepunkt and Friedewald Bad stations of the Moritzburg municipality, approximately halfway between the streets Karlstra√üe and An der Siedlung. The train hauled by No. 99 1789-9 was on a regular scheduled service train while that hauled by No. 20 was one of the extra gala trains. Around 250 passengers were travelling on the two trains. Both trains were travelling at a speed of about , and entered a single-tracked long turn in a narrow, forested valley from opposite directions. The drivers were able to notice one another's trains only at short distance, and while both drivers promptly started braking, the trains collided with a speed of . Five carriages derailed. As a result of the accident, all trains on the line were cancelled, as was the rest of the gala. Ambulances and a helicopter were used to ferry the injured passengers to hospital. Buses were laid on to replace the train service. Work began on 13 September to remove the damaged trains. The line was closed until 15 September and re-opened on early 16 September. Injuries One hundred and twenty-one people, including passengers as well as both drivers and firemen, were injured, four seriously, but not critically. Fifty-two injured passengers, including seven children under ten years of age, were rescued from the collision site by the local police and fire departments and the German Red Cross, and taken to six different local hospitals. The other injured registered in the days after the accident. By 14 September, only one person was detained in hospital. Locomotives involved ;99 1789-9 The first locomotive involved was No. 99 1789-9, a 2-10-2T built in 1956 and resident on the line. ;20 The second locomotive involved was No. 20, an 0-8-0. This locomotive built by Lokomotivbau Karl-Marx, Potsdam-Babelsberg in 1951. Four hundred such engines were built as part of the East German World War II reparations for the Soviet Union. In 1996, No. 20 was bought as scrap metal in Estonia and transferred to Saxony-Anhalt by the Mansfelder Bergwerksbahn association, and since 2000, after an extensive overhaul, operated on the association's narrow gauge railway with the same name. It was visiting the L√∂√ünitzgrundbahn railway as part of the gala. After the accident, the badly damaged locomotive was taken to the S√§chsische Dampfeisenbahngesellschaft (SDG) workshops in Oberwiesenthal for assessment. There were reports that the locomotive was so badly damaged that it might be written off, but it was repaired. Damage Locomotive No. 20 suffered severe damage in the accident, as did the carriages it was hauling at the time. The cost of repairs was estimated at ‚Ç¨1,000,000 (¬£900,000). After the derailed carriages had been lifted back on the track with hydraulic jacks, both damaged locomotives and seventeen carriages were transported from the collision site to Radebeul Ost station by diesel locomotives for inspection. After inspection in October 2009, locomotive No. 20 was being disassembled and repaired in Oberwiesenthal from November 2009, its boiler was repaired in Pi≈Ça. Repairs to locomotive 99 1789-9 followed. According to the L√∂√ünitzgrundbahn's vice manager, Mirko Fro√ü, the repair costs are covered by the railway's insurance. The track, which had only suffered minor damage, was repaired before the line reopened on 16 September. Twelve severely damaged carriages were repaired in the SDG's workshops in Marienberg. Until the carriages were repaired, the L√∂√ünitzgrundbahn used carriages borrowed from the SDG's other narrow-gauge railways, namely Wei√üeritztalbahn and Fichtelbergbahn. Many of the carriages suffered damage to their end verandah in the accident. The verandah of the leading carriage of the train hauled by No. 20 had the tender of the locomotive ride up upon it. The repair of No. 20 was carried out by the SDG at its Oberwiesenthal workshops. The tender was rebuilt by SDGs parent company BVO in Marienberg. Repairs to the boiler were carried out by Interlok, Pi≈Ça, Poland. Repairs to No. 20 included new tender frames and replacement of a section of the boiler. The locomotive returned to service in May 2011. Repairs to 99 1789 were carried out after No. 20 was completed. Investigation The accident was investigated by the local police. Spokesman Joerg Weyand said \\"The reasons are not clear at the moment. We cannot say if human error or technical failure caused the crash\\". The parts played in the accident by a driver and a train conductor are under investigation. As of 2 October 2009, the state's attorneys' investigations were still going on. Expert for transport safety Ulrich Maschek of the Dresden University of Technology criticized that the trains were not equipped with GPS-based modules automatically warning or halting trains about to collide: \\"Modern technology and historical vehicles are not mutually exclusive\\", he said. It is indicated that the accident was caused by one train leaving a station without permission. Court proceedings before Amtsgericht Mei√üen confirmed that the scheduled train No. 3011, hauled by engine 99 1789, had left Friedewald Bad without permission despite the other train on the line. In addition, the train crew had failed to stop at a signalling board (an \\"Ne 1\\" trapezoid board) and used the wrong track in Friedewald Bad. Driver and conductor were fined.

There are other trails, such as the Topocoba, Moqui and Kirby trails. However, these other trails are not maintained. As far back as 1976, they were described as ranging from \\"in poor repair\\" to \\"primitive, dangerous foot trails.\\" Special permission is required to use any such trail. Trail The trailhead is located at Hualapai Hilltop (which is located at the end of BIA Road 18), where there is a large parking lot, a heli-pad and permanent toilets that include amenities such as toilet paper and hand sanitizer. The trail can be traveled by foot, by horseback, or on a mule service the Havasupai offer. The mule service can also be purchased for luggage/packs only, which allows an easier hike and the ability to bring down more luxuries. The trail starts out at the hilltop, where it switch-backs down the side of the canyon for about ¬æ of a mile. This is by far the most difficult part of the trail, and is much more difficult on the way back up. The trail is approximately long to Supai, with an extra added on in order to reach the campgrounds, and descends about . Narrowing canyon The switch-backs stop when the plateau is reached, a point that is marked by a small rest area made from rocks and cement. The trail then leads down off the plateau into a dry streambed. Caution should always be taken when entering a dry streambed in any desert, as it is a prime place for flash floods. The trail follows the streambed down. There are multiple trails leading down this small canyon wash, but they all lead to the same place and never stray more than away from each other. The trail meanders down this streambed for approximately until the canyon starts to open up into another canyon. This spot is marked by a dramatic increase in vegetation. Follow the trail down the new canyon to the left. The trail will take you next to the stream where you will encounter a bridge. The trail crosses the bridge, thus entering into the town of Supai. Stay on the trail and respect the fences as the land behind them is private property. The trail enters into the city main, where it first encounters a small convenience shop that sells drinks, ice cream, candy, food, and other snacks. Straight ahead lies a rodeo corral where there are usually bulls penned-up. The trail leads to the town square where all the public buildings are located. The trail then goes through the city along the canyon wall to the right. The trail makes an obvious right-hand turn and enters into more vegetation. After leaving the vegetation the trail follows the canyon to the left. Hikers near Hualapai Hilltop After completely circling the small canyon (this is where Navajo Falls used to be located and now where two new unnamed falls are located since a large flood changed the area in 2008, Navajo Falls) the trail starts to head down towards the creek, ultimately crossing it twice, over two small separate bridges. After crossing the bridges, the trail leads to the top of Havasu Falls. It then moves toward the canyon wall on the left, ultimately hugging it. On the right side of the trail is the cliff that is next to Havasu Falls, where there is a good spot for photographs of the falls. There is a hand rail on the right side to help prevent falls. The trail heads down and enters into the campgrounds. The campgrounds are about half a mile (nearly a kilometer) long and offer many campsites, ranging from group to single size. There is a small spring located in the middle of the campgrounds which offers fresh water (the Tribe recommends treating the water, such as with boiling, filtering, etc.). The campground has many composting toilets and picnic tables. The Tribe asks to please pack out all trash and does not permit campfires. The trail then goes through the campgrounds and ends at Mooney Falls.

Early life Jennings was born in the Gila River Indian Community near Tempe, Arizona but was raised in Oklahoma. Her parents were Clifford Santos of the Gila River Pima tribe and LaQuinta Mopope, a Kiowa who worked as a nurse with the Indian Health Service in Arizona. Jennings is the oldest granddaughter of Kiowa Six artist Stephen Mopope and Jeanette Berry Mopope, from whom Jennings \\"inherited the Kiowa songs, crafts, manners and language\\" that is integral to her artwork. Jennings began doing beadwork at age 11, after observing and helping her grandmother with her artistry for several years prior. As a child growing up in Lawton, Oklahoma, she was often teased by others for wearing leggings and braids instead of trying to conceal her Native American heritage. She attended high school and college in Oklahoma. After graduation, she worked with the Bureau of Indian Affairs and then moved to the allotment land granted to her grandmother in Red Stone, OK. She and her first husband built an earth lodge on this Kiowa spiritually-significant property, which she uses as a studio and also makes available to the tribe for various cultural activities. In addition to her grandmother, another major influence in Jennings' life has been her participation in the O-Ho-Mah Lodge Society, a Kiowa war dance society with which her family has been involved for several generations. Her grandfather Stephen, his father George Mopope, and Jennings' sons Gabriel and Seth have all performed songs at Society ceremonies. Career Jennings had made artwork in her spare time, but in the early 1980s she received a commission from the Museum of International Folk Art to make a ceremonial child's dress using traditional Kiowa beadwork on rawhide. Jennings acknowledges that this commission marked the beginning of her professional career as a traditional Southern Plains artist. Jennings is known for making traditional Kiowa cradleboards, saddles, moccasins, beadwork, men's and women's clothing, and other craft formats, but she says cradleboards are her favorite. Over the years, her work has been included in many special exhibitions and she has received commissions from Kiowa leaders to make ceremonial regalia for important rituals, but she has also had to work other jobs in Anadarko, Oklahoma in order to earn funds to support her artwork. Jennings has also taken seriously the responsibility of teaching her craft to future generations, by \\"instructing young people in the necessary techniques to make regalia and demonstrating her artistry for broader audiences at museums and cultural centers\\". Despite having won many awards for her creative endeavors, she says \\"I've never considered myself an artist. I have always told everyone that I'm a simple, traditional woman.\\" \\"I do my grandmother's work,\\" Jennings said. \\"I do my great-grandmother's work. This is what they used to do. They are the ones who should be honored.\\" Besides finished pieces, she is one of the few artists who brain-tans her own hides. In 1992, Jennings (then-Morgan) reproduced a small version of the \\"Tepee With Battle Pictures\\" for an exhibit at the National Cowboy & Western Heritage Museum in Oklahoma City. The original painted tepee was created in 1845 to commemorate the continued peace agreement between the Kiowa and Cheyenne tribes, and was presented as a gift to Little Bluff, the principal chief of the Kiowa. The tepee represented an object of great cultural significance and prestige, and has been reproduced several times over the years. Jennings is a great-great-great-granddaughter of Little Bluff II. For her reproduced model, Jennings drew upon family history to depict military deeds, but because Kiowa tradition is that only men can reproduce such images, Jennings taught her son Seth to draw the battle pictures on the tepee. In 1995, Jennings helped organize an exhibit titled \\"Four Generations: Mopope, Palmer, Jennings, and Morgan\\" at the Red Earth Indian Center in Oklahoma City. The exhibit featured the work of eight Kiowa artisans from Jennings' family, starting with her grandfather Stephen Mopope, to represent an unbroken line of artistic tradition. One of Jennings' cradleboards was included in a national traveling exhibition titled \\"Gifts of Pride and Love\\" that featured 38 cradles from various Native American tribal traditions. The exhibit also emphasized female artists, who have long been overlooked by histories focusing on the male Indian warrior culture. The exhibition began in December 1999 at the Gilcrease Museum in Tulsa, Oklahoma, and included stops at the Heard Museum in Phoenix, Arizona, the Fowler Museum of Cultural History in Los Angeles, California, the Smithsonian National Museum of the American Indian in Washington, D.C., the Oklahoma Museum of Natural History in Norman, Oklahoma, and the Mashantucket Pequot Museum and Research Center in Ledyard, Connecticut. Jennings wrote a chapter titled \\"Why I Make Cradles\\" in the catalog book that accompanied the exhibition. Jennings' work has also been featured at the National Cowboy & Western Heritage Museum in Oklahoma City and the Buffalo Bill Historical Center in Cody, Wyoming, as well as in England and Scotland. As of 2017, she is believed to be the last active Kiowa cradleboard maker on the Southern Plains. She is a founding member of Artists for the Traditional Arts, an initiative of the National Council for the Traditional Arts. Awards and honors At the inaugural Red Earth Festival in 1987, Jennings won prizes for her antelope headdress and a mountain lion bow case. Jennings is a recipient of a 1989 National Heritage Fellowship awarded by the National Endowment for the Arts, which is the United States government's highest honor in the folk and traditional arts. That honor also includes recognition as a Living National Treasure by the US President and Congress. In 1992, she received the Red Earth Festival President's Award. In 1996, Jennings and her artwork were honored in a Plains Indian Seminar sponsored by the Buffalo Bill Center of the West, titled \\"Powerful Expressions: Art of Plains Indian Women\\". The seminar's keynote address noted that \\"the way Vanessa lives epitomizes the best kinds of values and virtues of Plains Indian women\\". In 2004, she was named the Honored One by the Red Earth Festival, which is the highest honor bestowed upon an artist by the festival. She has earned multiple awards in various categories at the Santa Fe Indian Market, including in 1997, 2003, 2010, and 2016. She has also won awards at the Great Plains Indian Rendezvous. Personal life Jennings lives in Red Stone, east of Fort Cobb, Oklahoma. She had three children from her first marriage. Because her parents died in the 1950s, she was unable to follow the Kiowa tradition of having the grandparents directly raise their grandchildren, so Jennings raised her three children by herself. She married Carl Jennings in 1993. As of 2004, she had four grandchildren, and she also raised her sister's eight children following her death. Two of Jennings' children are also traditional artists. Gabriel Morgan is a ledger artist, pipe maker and flute player. Seth Morgan is also a ledger artist and pipe maker, in addition to working with beads, making bows and arrows, and writing poetry. As of 2003, she has survived four strokes.

Overall health care=United States Healthcare rationing in the United States is largely accomplished through market forces, though major government programs include Medicare, Medicaid, Veterans Affairs, and the Indian Health Service. Most Americans have private health insurance, and non-emergency health care rationing decisions are made based on what the insurance company or government insurance will pay for, what the patient is willing to pay for (though health care prices are often not transparent), and the ability and willingness of the provider to perform uncompensated care. The Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act of 1986 requires any properly equipped hospital receiving Medicare funds (nearly all private hospitals) to provide emergency healthcare regardless of citizenship, immigration status, or ability to pay. The government also regulates insurance policies, requiring coverage for some items and controlling the rules for who is eligible and what they can be charged. The 2010 Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (known as the PPCA or Obamacare) contained many changes to these regulations, including the first requirement that all Americans purchase health insurance (starting in 2014), which significantly changed the calculus of rationing decisions, including for preventive care. United Kingdom In the United Kingdom, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) sets coverage requirements for the National Health Service (NHS), which is funded and operated by the government. NICE calculates an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio in terms of quality-adjusted life years (QALY). Treatments under ¬£20,000 per QALY gained are considered cost-effective, but those above ¬£30,000 per QALY are rarely approved. Individuals who are able to do so may also pay for private treatments beyond what the NHS offers, but low-income people largely have equal access to health care. The overall level of government funding for NHS is a political issue in the UK. Local decisions about service provision in England are made by clinical commissioning groups. As pressures on the NHS have increased there have been increasing local moves to restrict non urgent surgery for obese patients and smokers. Funding for in vitro fertilisation is reduced from three cycles to one for patients who meet the criteria; that female sterilisation is only be funded in exceptional circumstances; gluten free food will not be available on prescription for most patients who need it; and over the counter medicines will no longer be prescribed except in exceptional circumstances. In 2006 Croydon Primary Care Trust produced a list of 34 procedures of limited clinical effectiveness which was circulated widely within the English NHS. Some were largely cosmetic, and others were used on patients who were unlikely to benefits from them. The London Health Observatory calculated that these procedures amounted to between 3% and 10% of clinical activity and that the resources could be used more effectively. A similar list was produced by NHS England in June 2018. It is proposed that surgery for snoring, dilatation and curettage for heavy menstrual bleeding, knee arthroscopies for osteoarthritis and injections for non-specific back pain will only be available in exceptional circumstances. Specific eligibility criteria will be produced for *Breast reduction *Removal of benign skin lesions *Grommets for Glue Ear *Tonsillectomy for sore throats *Haemorrhoid surgery *Hysterectomy for heavy menstrual bleeding *Chalazia (lesions on eyelids) removal *Anthroscopic compression for subacromial shoulder pain *Carpal tunnel syndrome release *Dupuytren's contracture release for tightening of fingers *Ganglion excision - removal of noncancerous lumps on the wrist or hand *Trigger finger release *Varicose vein surgery This would affect about 100,000 patients every year and is claimed to free up about ¬£200 million. See also NHS treatments blacklist. Shortages Shortages of donated organs for transplantation has resulted in the rationing of hearts, livers, lungs and kidneys in the United States, mediated by the United Network for Organ Sharing. During the 1940s, a limited supply of iron lungs for polio victims forced physicians to ration these machines. Dialysis machines for patients in kidney failure were rationed between 1962 and 1967. More recently, Tia Powell led a New York State Workgroup that set up guidelines for rationing ventilators during a flu pandemic.Cornelia Dean, Guidelines for Epidemics: Who Gets a Ventilator?, The New York Times, March 25, 2008 Among those who have argued in favor of health care rationing are moral philosopher Peter SingerWhy We Must Ration Health Care , The New York Times, July 15, 2009 and Oregon governor John Kitzhaber.

For nearly twenty years, from 1935‚Äì54, he was a prolific editor of films for Paramount Pictures, including eleven films with director Mitchell Leisen. For twenty-five years, from 1941‚Äì1966, Harrison was editor, editorial supervisor or associate producer on all the films directed by Billy Wilder,https://catalog.afi.com/Person/39117-Doane-Harrison who is now considered as one of the great 20th Century filmmakers. Early career Born in Paw Paw, Michigan, Harrison began his career during the silent film era. The earliest phase of his career and his education don't appear to have been documented. In 1925‚Äì1926, he was credited as the editor for nine films starring Richard Talmadge, and produced by Richard Talmadge Productions.See . By 1928, he was editing films produced by Path√© Exchange. In 1933 he edited his eleventh (and last) film starring Richard Talmadge, On Your Guard. By 1935, Harrison had joined Paramount Pictures, one of the major Hollywood studios. Harrison remained at Paramount for more than eighteen years. His first film there was Four Hours to Kill! (1935), which was directed by Mitchell Leisen; at Path√© Exchange, Leisen had been the art director and Harrison the editor on three films. Their notable director-editor collaboration ultimately stretched over twenty-three years and eleven films, including Hold Back the Dawn (1941), which received six Academy Award nominations, Easy Living (1937), Midnight (1939), and Remember the Night (1940). Collaboration with Billy Wilder Harrison is probably best remembered for his long association with Billy Wilder. As a new immigrant to the United States in the 1930s, Wilder had found work as a screenwriter for Paramount, where Harrison was also working as an editor. Wilder and Harrison both worked on Midnight in 1939, and again on Hold Back the Dawn in 1941. By 1942, Wilder had persuaded the management at Paramount to assign him as the director of the comedy The Major and the Minor; Wilder had previously directed just a single film in France. Wilder asked that Harrison be assigned as the film's editor. Wilder has been quoted as saying about this early assignment, \\"I worked with a very good cutter, Doane Harrison, from whom I learned a great deal. He was much more of a help to me than the cameraman. When I became a director from a writer my technical knowledge was very meagre.\\" Sam Stagg has described their early collaboration, \\"In valuable early lessons, Harrison taught Wilder how to preplan each shot as part of a total editing scheme. The results: Time and money saved, and few protection shots required. (The term \\"protection shot\\", also called coverage, refers to footage shot from various setups and angles that may be needed for editing a sequence in the cutting room.)\\" The Major and the Minor was successful, and launched Wilder's directing career. Harrison worked on all the films directed by Wilder for the next 25 years, through The Fortune Cookie (1966); their unusually close collaboration involved Harrison in filming as well as editing. Lemon's 1966 interview and article was reprinted in this 2001 volume. Harrison was credited as editorial supervisor on the next several films that Wilder directed, through Sunset Boulevard (1950). Harrison was credited as an \\"editorial consultant\\" on Sabrina (1954), which was the last film at Paramount for Wilder and Harrison. After leaving Paramount, Harrison was an associate producer on eight, and production associate on two of Wilder's films, from The Seven Year Itch (1955) through The Fortune Cookie (1966). Final cuts Harrison's and Wilder's notable director-editor collaboration (as editor, editorial supervisor or advisor) had extended over ten films, from The Major and the Minor (1942) through Sabrina (1954).https://catalog.afi.com/Person/39117-Doane-Harrison While he was working with Wilder, Harrison also edited more films by other directors; his final editing credit, for The Girl Most Likely (1958), was a reunion with director Mitchell Leisen. He acted as a consultant to Mike Nichols on Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? (1966), which was the first film Nichols directed. Harrison was nominated three times for the Academy Award for Best Film Editing for three films directed by Wilder: Five Graves to Cairo (1943), The Lost Weekend (1945), and Sunset Boulevard (with Arthur P. Schmidt, 1950).Academy Awards archives Harrison died in 1968 in Riverside, California, aged 74.

The idea was seen by some as a way to solve the chronic industrial disputes and to enhance participation of employees in their workplace. Background A Committee of Enquiry into Industrial Democracy was set up by the Labour government of Harold Wilson in December 1975, in response to the European Commission's Draft Fifth Company Law Directive which sought to harmonise worker participation in management of companies across Europe. Its terms of reference started with the words, Content The committee, chaired by Bullock, published its report in January 1977. This report was not unanimous. The majority report was signed by Bullock and as members of the committee: three trade unionists, two academics and a city solicitor. Majority report The key idea was that in all boards of companies with over 2000 employees, there would be a right to have representation for workers. A company wide codetermination referendum would be held in firms with over 2000 employees, with the entire workforce voting. After approval, only union members would be able to vote for candidates to the supervisory board. Shareholders and unions would appoint x representatives each. The deadlock breaker would be an independent y appointee from the government. The Report further recommended that nondelegable board functions would be codified as the right to submit resolutions to shareholders concerning (1) winding up (2) capital structure changes (3) article alterations (4) dividends (5) disposal of substantial parts of the business.(1977) Cmnd 6706, 77 The board, not management, should have exclusive control of (1) appointment of management and (2) disposition of resources not concerning rules on capital structure and dividends.(1977) Cmnd 6706, 78 Shareholders would retain a veto power, however, over such decisions.(1977) Cmnd 6706, 81 Minority report The minority report, produced by the three industrialists on the committee, proposed a second tier board for workers to have input on. They recommended election of representatives to be open to nonunion members.115 Reception The report was received with trepidation but not rejecting the principles laid down. In a publication of the City Company Law Committee, A reply to Bullock, the authors said, > The more people are able to influence decisions which closely affect their > work the more effective will that involvement be; the more effective the > involvement the greater the commitment to the company‚Äôs objectives which, in > the final analysis, will be concerned with generating wealth or services for > the community as a whole.City Company Law Committee, A Reply to Bullock > (1977) 3 Nevertheless, they did not want direct participation because they viewed shareholders to be the \\"owners\\" of companies. > the fundamental basis of the joint stock company system...

These scattering mechanisms are: Umklapp phonon-phonon scattering, phonon-impurity scattering, phonon-electron scattering, and phonon-boundary scattering. Each scattering mechanism can be characterised by a relaxation rate 1/\\\\tau which is the inverse of the corresponding relaxation time. All scattering processes can be taken into account using Matthiessen's rule. Then the combined relaxation time \\\\tau_{C} can be written as: :\\\\frac{1}{\\\\tau_C} = \\\\frac{1}{\\\\tau_U}+\\\\frac{1}{\\\\tau_M}+\\\\frac{1}{\\\\tau_B}+\\\\frac{1}{\\\\tau_\\\\text{ph-e}} The parameters \\\\tau_{U}, \\\\tau_{M}, \\\\tau_{B}, \\\\tau_\\\\text{ph-e} are due to Umklapp scattering, mass-difference impurity scattering, boundary scattering and phonon-electron scattering, respectively. Phonon-phonon scattering For phonon-phonon scattering, effects by normal processes (processes which conserve the phonon wave vector - N processes) are ignored in favor of Umklapp processes (U processes). Since normal processes vary linearly with \\\\omega and umklapp processes vary with \\\\omega^2, Umklapp scattering dominates at high frequency. \\\\tau_U is given by: :\\\\frac{1}{\\\\tau_U}=2\\\\gamma^2\\\\frac{k_B T}{\\\\mu V_0}\\\\frac{\\\\omega^2}{\\\\omega_D} where \\\\gamma is the Gruneisen anharmonicity parameter, is the shear modulus, is the volume per atom and \\\\omega_{D} is the Debye frequency. Three-phonon and four-phonon process Thermal transport in non-metal solids was usually considered to be governed by the three-phonon scattering process, and the role of four-phonon and higher-order scattering processes was believed to be negligible. Recent studies have shown that the four-phonon scattering can be important for nearly all materials at high temperature and for certain materials at room temperature. The predicted significance of four-phonon scattering in boron arsenide was confirmed by experiments. Mass-difference impurity scattering Mass-difference impurity scattering is given by: :\\\\frac{1}{\\\\tau_M}=\\\\frac{V_0 \\\\Gamma \\\\omega^4}{4\\\\pi v_g^3} where \\\\Gamma is a measure of the impurity scattering strength. Note that {v_g} is dependent of the dispersion curves. Boundary scattering Boundary scattering is particularly important for low-dimensional nanostructures and its relaxation time is given by: :\\\\frac{1}{\\\\tau_B}=\\\\frac{V}{L_0}(1-p) where L_0 is the characteristic length of the system and p, which is related to the roughness of the surface, represents the fraction of specularly scattered phonons. The p parameter is not easily calculated for an arbitrary surface. For a surface characterized by a root- mean-square roughness \\\\eta, a wavelength-dependent value for the p parameter can be calculated using :p(\\\\lambda) = \\\\exp\\\\Bigg(-\\\\frac{16 \\\\pi^3 \\\\eta^2}{\\\\lambda^2} \\\\Bigg) in the case of plane waves at normal incidence. The value p=1 corresponds to a perfectly smooth surface such that boundary scattering is purely specular. The relaxation time \\\\tau_B is in this case infinite, implying that boundary scattering does not contribute to the thermal resistance. Conversely, the value p=0 corresponds to a very rough surface, in which case boundary scattering is purely diffusive and the relaxation rate is given by: :\\\\frac{1}{\\\\tau_B}=\\\\frac{V}{L_0} This equation is also known as Casimir limit. Phonon-electron scattering Phonon-electron scattering can also contribute when the material is heavily doped. The corresponding relaxation time is given as: :\\\\frac{1}{\\\\tau_\\\\text{ph-e}}=\\\\frac{n_e \\\\epsilon^2 \\\\omega}{\\\\rho V^2 k_B T}\\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{\\\\pi m^* V^2}{2k_B T}} \\\\exp \\\\left(-\\\\frac{m^*V^2}{2k_B T}\\\\right) The parameter n_{e} is conduction electrons concentration, Œµ is deformation potential, œÅ is mass density and m* is effective electron mass. It is usually assumed that contribution to thermal conductivity by phonon-electron scattering is negligible.

Synopsis The play focuses on the relationship between despondent Arthur Przybyszewski, a former 1960s radical who owns a rundown donut shop in Uptown, Chicago, and Franco, his energetic but troubled young African American assistant who wants to update the establishment with lively music and healthy menu options. Dialogue scenes are separated by soliloquies in which Arthur discusses his past and reminisces about the city as it was in his younger years.

It‚Äôs insubstantial and sweet, with virtually no nutritional value. Still, minor though this comedy is, it is also hard to dislike. Who doesn‚Äôt hanker for a doughnut now and then?\\"New York Times, June 30, 2008 In reviewing the Broadway production, Isherwood called Superior Donuts \\"a gentle comedy that unfolds like an extended episode of a 1970s sitcom\\" and \\"a warm bath of a play that will leave Broadway audiences with satisfied smiles rather than rattled nerves.\\" He felt if the play \\"possesses the nostalgic appeal of a classic sitcom, it is also hampered by some of the genre‚Äôs standard flaws. A subplot about Franco‚Äôs gambling debts feels contrived, like one of those dubious byways cooked up by writers in the later seasons of a series, when inspiration flags and the characters‚Äô interactions have begun to go stale. The ancillary characters... might have come straight from the Sidekicks, Neighbors and Friends rack, although the excellent actors imbue them all with a sharp specificity. The relationship at the heart of the play, between Arthur and Franco, is also not without its formulaic aspects. Mr. Letts‚Äôs depiction of this budding cross-racial, cross- generational friendship feels a little retrograde, as both Arthur and Franco reveal dimensions that confound each other but help ease the awkwardness between them... But Mr. Letts treads gently, underplaying the surrogate-son aspect of their dynamic.\\"New York Times, October 2, 2009 Jon Michael Hill was nominated for the 2010 Tony Award for Best Performance by a Featured Actor in a Play for his work in this play. TV series In January 2016, CBS ordered a pilot of a TV show based on the play with Bob Daily as the showrunner. On February 9, 2016, it was reported that Jermaine Fowler will play Franco. On March 1, 2016, Brian d'Arcy James was cast as Arthur. On May 26, 2016, CBS ordered the series to be re-piloted for a mid-season premiere. In September 2016, CBS ordered the TV series, which debuted on February 2, 2017. Judd Hirsch now plays the role of the shop owner. Other cast members include Jermaine Fowler, Katey Sagal, David Koechner, Maz Jobrani, Anna Baryshnikov, Darien Sills-Evans, and Rell Battle. On May 12, 2018, the series was cancelled after 2 seasons.

It is said to have been founded by Guru Maharaj Narayan Khatri (Swami Hamsananda), who spent most of his life in the vicinity herding and milking thousands of cows. According to traditional stories, some of his devotees followed him to see where he took the cows, but they never could find him. According to older people of the locality, he came from Rolpa to the present temple site and asked the owner of that land (landlord) to donate the land to him. He dug the land and obtained curd mixed rice and fire. He had explained that these things were those buried by the Pandavas in Dvapara Yuga, when they worshipped in this place before departing to heaven. The landlord was astonished . He agreed to hand over the land instantly. Thereafter the holy fire is burning continuously till then. Bivut (ash) of the firewoods burnt by the holy fire is believed to cure different physical disorders like headache and stomach ache. Before he left physical body the guru gave some of his powers to a few disciples. On the day he departed his physical body by his own wish, a number of people gathered around him at the place where he habitually meditated. The guru left his body after bidding goodbye to his disciples and other followers. His favourite cow also died at the same instant, then the rest of the cows miraculously disappeared within a few days. There are also accounts of cows emptying their milk by themselves every day at the same time, at the place where the Guru died. He had done many miracles during his lifetime. Once he asked Rolpali cowherds not to take the cattles in a particular area for grazing warning them of a huge landslide in that area. But they refused and were swept by the landslide. He used to tell fortune of the devotees. He was so much kind that no one returned from the temple without having food. He helped the poors to build their house. He managed to teach vedic scriptures and other religious scriptures to the children's. They may perform vedic worshipping in the temple after study. But, doing this is not a compulsion after study. Swargadwari is counted among Nepal's top pilgrimage sites and is listed in a national inventory of cultural and historic heritage sites. As of 2009, a cable car to the temple complex was under construction. In the aftermath of the 1996-2006 Nepalese Civil War, donations of straw and hay had diminished to a point where resident cattle at Swargawari were in danger of starving. It is the one of the popular Hindu's place. It is located in southern part of pyuthan district. Main visitor of this religious area are Nepalese and Indians. sworgadwari is also popular for the trekking. it takes two days to reach there by foot. The footfall in swargadwari increase dramatically on June‚ÄìJuly. Anyone can reach there from two routes; from bhingri, and from Ghorahi. It takes around 4 hours from bhingri to reach swargadwari, and around 8 hour from Ghorahi, dang. but the routes are extremely breath taking. The route from dang is more dangerous in comparison to the bhingri road. This road has been recently rerouted for betterment and safe journey. It lies on the top of the hill, surrounded by pine forest. There are vast number of Rhododendron trees on the way and in swargadwari itself.

It is a area extending from the blocks west of Broadway to extensions along Church (NY 9N) and Washington (NY 29) streets. The former Franklin Square Historic District is included in its entirety. The neighborhoods of the district are characterized by modest, intact 19th-century houses in vernacular 19th-century architectural styles. Its development was shaped first by the divisions of the original land grant, and then by the construction of railroads into the community. During the city's peak years as a resort in the later 19th century, the West Side housed its working class. In 1994 it was recognized as a historic district and listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Two of the almost 600 properties within it, a house and a cemetery, are listed on the Register in their own right. Geography Within Saratoga Springs, the West Side is generally taken to mean the area from Broadway on the east to the city's western boundary, between Greenfield Avenue on the north and West Circular Street on the south, including Skidmore College and Saratoga Hospital. The historic district's boundaries are more elaborate and include a small portion of that area, reflecting the areas where historic buildings, mostly houses, have remained intact. Boundary On the east the district boundary is generally Woodlawn Avenue or lot lines along it between Walton Street and Greenfield. From there it turns west to exclude some newer construction but then follows Woodlawn and its axis south to Washington Street. At Franklin Square it turns south to follow Grand Street west, sometimes including houses on the south side, as far west as a few houses on the north side just west of Birch Street. It follows Birch up to the rear lines of the north side of Washington to Marvin Alley, where it turns north. At Division it turns west, then follows some rear lines along West Harrison Street. Remaining along lot lines, it skirts newer construction at the Church- West Harrison intersection, then follows the rear lines along the south side of Church almost to Myrtle Street, just south of the hospital. After following Church back eastward, it goes up Seward, Pearl and Van Dorn streets to some houses on the west side of Skidmore, then down their rear lines to Pine Alley. After a short eastward section it takes in all the houses on either side of Waterbury Street south of the college and a few on Lawrence Street just north of Waterbury. It returns to Pine Alley in the middle of the block to the east, then follows rear lines along the west of State Street to its northernmost point at Greenfield. From there it follows that street back to Woodlawn. Character Within this boundary there are 500 buildings, mostly wood frame houses, considered of sufficient integrity and age to be contributing properties to the district. An additional 18 sites of former houses are also considered contributing. Another site, and 57 other buildings, are non- contributing. Most of the houses are located on narrow lots, not more than wide by deep, typical of 19th-century development. There are a few more urban areas along Woodlawn, with a mix of uses including commercial and residential. History The development of the West Side was forged in the early years by divisions and subdivisions of the land, which created lot lines still followed by streets today. Later on, the railroad created a clear social dividing line which made the West Side the village's working-class neighborhood. The resort era also impacted the district on its fringes. 1768‚Äì1813: Land subdivision The West Side's evolution began late in the colonial era, when the Kayaderosseras Patent was subdivided. The patent was originally granted to Robert Livingston and David Schuyler in 1708, but could not be sold or subdivided for 60 years because of a dispute over the Indian deed. When it was, Lot 12 of the patent's 16th General Allotment, where most of the present- day city of Saratoga Springs is located, was assigned to the heirs of Rip Van Dam, one of the original proprietors. Van Dam's heirs sold to Isaac Low, Jacob Walton and Anthony Van Dam, with all three receiving a piece of the land on which High Rock Spring, then the most valuable aspect of the property, sat. Low was a Loyalist during the subsequent Revolution, and his third was confiscated and sold in 1779. Ultimately these divisions and subdivisions of land would influence lot and street placement within the city and the district. Walton's son Henry built himself a country seat, called Wood Lawn, on his lands, presently where Skidmore is situated. He eventually purchased enough other land that he came to own Flat Rock Spring and developed it for tourism. He soon got competition when Gideon Putnam acquired Congress Spring to the south (in what is now Congress Park) and began developing hotels there. Both men were also acquiring land to the west of the springs and making lots available. A map Walton published in 1813 is the first in the city to show Church and New streets; it is also the first on which the name Van Dam Street appears. 1833‚Äì1907: Railroads and resorts Both Walton and Putnam's son Rockwell were among the founders of the Saratoga and Schenectady Railroad, which opened a line into the village in 1833. The tracks were routed west of Broadway, along New Street, past a station at Division Street, and finally crossed Broadway at Van Dam. They are no longer extant, but their presence shaped the development of the district as well. It gave the neighborhood a center, triggered growth two or three blocks deeper than had previously been taking place and gave the West Side its identity as the less genteel workingman's side of town (the local gentry settled in the East Side). Franklin Square By the middle of the century, all the land four blocks west of Broadway had been built out, and subdivisions were being carved out of the farmland west of Franklin and Walworth streets. The station's presence at Division and Franklin had created Franklin Square (originally Marvin Square), the only upscale neighborhood on the West Side, with large Greek Revival homes. Just to its west was a poorer neighborhood, originally home to Irish immigrants (later Italians) who arrived via the Adirondack Railway (by then routed along Franklin), giving it the name Dublin, which it still has. In 1879 Henry Hilton acquired Woodlawn from Walton's heirs (supposedly having raised the money by defrauding the estate of Alexander Turney Stewart) and expanded it lavishly, adding around . This occurred during Saratoga Springs' peak years as a resort and triggered the construction of lavish vacation homes in the northern reaches of the West Side, abutting the estate. The city's population more than tripled in the three decades between 1850 and 1880. Most of those new inhabitants settled on the West Side. Saratoga Springs' peak years ended in 1907, when gambling was outlawed. The casino became city property four years later and its land became Congress Park in 1915. Later in the 20th century, urban renewal projects demolished some of the older, neglected buildings in the corridor where the railroad tracks had been. Some of the Woodlawn property became a senior citizens' housing complex with high rises, and Skidmore moved into the land at the north end in 1976. Today Like the city's other historic districts, its historic character is preserved by the city's Design Review Commission, a seven-member body appointed by the mayor to staggered three-year terms. It reviews any proposed signage and exterior changes to any building in any of the city's historic districts. Architecture Amid the overwhelmingly residential character of the district, there are a number of different house types reflecting difference in social status of the builder or original owner. Frame predominates as a building material because of the proximity of the Adirondack forests to Saratoga Springs; architecturally the district reflects the vernacular styles found in that region. The form of the houses was also constrained by the narrow lots, resulting in buildings much deeper than they were wide. Even some of the bungalows built in the mid-20th century on vacant or redeveloped lots within the district were positioned so that the side gable faced the street, with the main entrance likewise located on the side of the lot. In a few cases, two lots were consolidated to build a house with a wide front. The most upscale residences are the townhouses found on Franklin Square, Church and Woodlawn streets and portions of Clinton and Van Dam streets. Usually two stories tall, they show the greatest attention to the forms of popular contemporary styles and the most elaborate ornamentation, sometimes including surfaces of brick or stone in sections. They often have a generous setback from the street and a porch, sometimes wrapping around the side. The majority of the district's housing is a type referred to as village residences. These were home to the middle class population which settled the district. They are often one to two stories, located on smaller lots and more restrained in their architecture, with most taking the form of a front-facing gable with inline ells on telescoping on the rear. Most have porches, like the townhouses, yet minimally decorated. A few have side gable wings with some later ones having cross-gabled rears. In the 20th century, many were resided with modern materials like vinyl and aluminum. Workers' cottages were even smaller and plainer than the village residences, but otherwise similar in form. A few are more than two stories in height; most are one. They have porches but almost no decoration, with rear additions primarily small and service-related. Most use cheaper novelty siding instead of clapboard. They are found in the areas of the district with the smallest and densest lots, primarily the south side of Van Dam between Church and Woodlawn and the northern end of State Street. Two- family houses were village residences either originally built or later modified to house an owner and tenant. They are generally similar to that form, except for some turn-of-the-century designs where architects took advantage of the larger size to scale the form up. Some were divided vertically to look like two row houses. They are usually two stories in height, taking up most of the larger lots they occupy, leaving little room for yards. Higher-density rental housing took the form of tenements, large three- story flat-roofed buildings that contain more than two units. They were usually owned by an absentee landlord. Most are on back streets, like Russell or Waterbury streets, and unornamented. A slightly more stylish example from later in the district's development can be found at 190‚Äì94 Grand Street. Some houses had outbuildings which are also included as contributing properties. Most are stables or carriage houses later converted to garages. These were usually utilitarian gabled sheds with a bay for a single horse and wagon (the exception being those that served the upscale homes of Franklin Square). A few later ones were built for automobiles. Their main impact on the district was the creation of the alleys in mid-block, later expanded into streets in their own right. Significant contributing properties Hiram Charles Todd House The West Side Historic District was preceded by another, smaller district. Two properties within that district were later separately listed on the National Register, and there are some other notable properties within the current district. *Franklin Square. Added to the Register in 1972 as the city's first historic district, it contains 87 properties in its . Most are upscale mid-19th century residences and outbuildings taking advantage of the proximity of the railroad station, newly built at the time. *Hiram Charles Todd House, 4 Franklin Square. This ornate Greek Revival house on Franklin Square, one of the city's first listings on the Register, was probably built around 1837. It takes its name from Todd, a prominent lawyer and jurist descended from the original owners, who lived there in the early 20th century. *Holmes Block, 102‚Äì08 Woodlawn Avenue. This group of four rowhouses was built over the two decades after the Civil War in the Second Empire style, with mansard roofs and dormer windows. They retain their original marble flooring at the entrances. *Tenement at 190‚Äì94 Grand Avenue. This 1896 group of three two-unit attached houses was designed by R. Newton Brezee, known for his grand houses elsewhere in town. It features more decoration than other tenements in the district, such as bracketed cornices.

(ref. https://www.spglobal.com/esg/csa/yearbook/ranking/#data- search*=%22enel%20americas%22] ) History The former logo of the company On June 19, 1981, Compa√±√≠a Chilena de Electricidad S.A. was reorganized into a parent company and three subsidiaries. One of these was Compa√±√≠a Chilena Metropolitana de Distribuci√≥n El√©ctrica S.A. In 1985, under the Chilean government's privatization policy, the process of transferring the share capital of Compa√±√≠a Chilena Metropolitana de Distribuci√≥n El√©ctrica S.A. to the private sector was begun, ending finally on August 10, 1987. In this process, the pension fund management companies (AFPs), company employees, institutional investors, and thousands of small shareholders joined the Company. Its organizational structure was based on activities or operative functions whose results were evaluated functionally and its profitability was limited by a tariff structure as a result of the Company's exclusive dedication to the electricity distribution business.  Restructuring and Diversification (1987 - 2014)  In 1987, the company's board proposed forming a division for each of the parent company's activities. Four subsidiaries were therefore created to be managed as business units each with its own objectives, thus expanding the company's activities toward other non- regulated activities but linked to the main business. This division was approved by the extraordinary shareholders meeting of November 25, 1987 which defined its new corporate objects. Compa√±√≠a Chilena Metropolitana de Distribuci√≥n El√©ctrica S.A. thus became an investment holding company. On August 1, 1988, by virtue of that agreed at the General Extraordinary Shareholder‚Äôs Meeting of April 12, 1988, one of the corporations born out of the division changed its company name to Enersis S.A. The same year, and with the purpose of successfully facing the challenge of development and growth, the company was divided into five business units, which gave rise to five affiliates. Of these, Chilectra and R√≠o Maipo took charge of electric power distribution; Manso de Velasco concentrated upon engineering and electric construction services, as well as real estate administration; Synapsis took care of the information technologies and data processing area; while Diprel focused upon lending electric product supply and marketing services.

Route description The highway runs from the north coast city of San Juan to the south coast city of Ponce via Rio Piedras, Caguas, Cayey, Aibonito, Coamo, and Juana Diaz. The highway corridor is now signed as Puerto Rico Highway 14 from Ponce to Cayey, and as Puerto Rico Highway 1 from Cayey to San Juan. History In the 1820s, the Spanish colonial government in Puerto Rico, under the direction of Governor Miguel de la Torre took the first steps for building a highway connecting the towns of San Juan and Rio Piedras and incorporating temporary wooden bridges for river crossings. During the 1830s an unpaved wagon road was built linking Ponce, Juana Diaz and Coamo to satisfy the commercial sugar production needs of that area. In 1846 a new masonry bridge was built by Spanish engineer Santiago Cortijo to connect the capital city island of San Juan with the rest of the Puerto Rico mainland. Meanwhile, construction of a 41-kilometer macadam highway between San Juan and Caguas, designed by Colonel engineer Diego Galvez, was begun. Construction of the San Juan-Caguas span was first under the direction of Colonel Tulio O'Neill and was later completed, in 1853, under Commander Santiago Cortijo. After the completion of the bridge over the Rio Piedras river in 1853, the construction project completed bridges over Quebrada Frailes in 1855, the Concepcion bridge over Caguas's Rio Ca√±as in 1856, and the bridge over the Caguas's Cag√ºitas River in 1857. In 1858 Puerto Rican civil engineer Timoteo Luberza designed the paved highway between Coamo, at the southern foothills of Cordillera Central, and Juana Diaz, its first neighboring town due southwest, for the municipality of Coamo. Three years later, by 1861, a fair portion of this highway had already been completed. The most challenging segment of Carretera Central, the one involving the mountainous segment between Caguas in the north and Coamo in the south, was built under the 1859 General Highway Plan, a complete highway plan to connect the coastal town with those in the mountainous interior. The plan was approved by the Spanish Crown in 1860 and it included the creation of \\"first order\\" and \\"second order\\" highways. In 1860, the central government commissioned engineer Niceto Blajot to design the paved version of Carretera Central between Ponce and Juana Diaz, which until then was a dirt and gravel road. The then-municipal highways connecting Ponce, Juana Diaz and Coamo were made part of the state-run Carretera Central between 1875 and 1880. Meanwhile, the first stretch of road built exclusively under the Delegation of Public Works (equivalent to a department of public works) was the northern mountainside segment between Caguas and Cayey. This segment was started in 1875 and completed in 1881 under the direction of site engineers Raimundo Camprubi and Enrique Gadea-Giraldez. It was designed by engineer Manuel Lopez-Bayo. On the southern mountainside of Cordillera Central, the stretch from Coamo to Aibonito was designed by Timoteo Luberza in 1861. Construction started in 1874 under Ricardo Campubri. It included 7.5 kilometers of the steep Asomante slopes, and was completed in 1881. The width of the road in this stretch was reduced from 6.5 meters to 6.0 meters, to reduce costs associated with building in such steep terrain. The segment between Aibonito and Cayey was designed by Manuel Lope-Bayo, begun in 1879 and completed in 1886. It included bridges over Quebrada Honda and Quebrada Toita. As in the Coamo to Aibonito stretch, the stretch from Aibonito to Cayey has a width of 6.0 meters instead of 6.5 meters. The stretch was so treacherous that it was the last to be completed and the most expensive. It soon acquired the popular name La Piqui√±a.La centenaria ruta de la Piqui√±a. El Nuevo Dia. Guaynabo, Puerto Rico. 1 July 2011. Accessed 25 May 2016. Functional by 1886, Carretera Central was the first highway to cross Puerto Rico's east‚Äìwest mountain range, the Cordillera Central. In 1886, it was a route with 13 permanent bridges and 33 \\"casillas de camineros\\" (housing for road maintenance technicians). Contests were held for which roads had been best maintained, so that workers could be properly recognized and rewarded. The Arenas Bridge, constructed in 1894 to bring the Carretera Central across the Rio de la Plata, was the longest bridge constructed in Puerto Rico under Spanish government. Macadamized \\"from end to end...into an almost solid floor,\\" when the United States took possession of Puerto Rico in 1898, the editors of the American Harper's Weekly publication called Carretera Central, which was also known as Carretera Militar, \\"the finest road in the Western Hemisphere.\\" The road, spanning the entire length between San Juan and Ponce, was fully completed in 1898 and christened Carretera Central. Other facts In 1898, during the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War, American forces moved from south to north over the Carretara Central. One bridge was demolished by the Spanish to delay the American advance. National Register of Historic Places As one of the first modern roadways in Puerto Rico, being built from 1846‚Äì1886, and regarded as one of the finest roads in the Americas for years after its completion, a portion was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2019. The listed portion of the road, from Caguas to Juana D√≠az, includes the exceptionally challenging engineering through the Cordillera Central, 11 major bridges, 14 maintenance workers' houses, and numerous other roadway structures.

A small number were built for Italian diplomatic use. Design and development In 1937 CANT (Cantieri Riuniti dell'Adriatico) won a contract to build an aircraft for the Italian diplomatic corps in their embassies abroad. The result was the CANT Z.1012. It was a low wing cantilever monoplane with an aerodynamically clean wooden structure and plywood skin. The single spar wings were tapered, carrying balanced ailerons and slotted flaps inboard. The fuselage had an oval cross-section and was built on a keel with longitudinal members and transverse frames. The cabin, over the wing, was fully glazed and had a starboard side seat for one passenger alongside the pilot with a bench seat behind for two more. A third row could be included if a lower fuel load was carried. The back of the bench seat folded for access to a baggage compartment. The fin was integral with the fuselage and was quite tall, carrying the tailplane about halfway up. The tailplane was braced below to the fuselage. Both rudder and elevators were fabric covered and both mass and horn balanced.Flight 15 October 1942 p.410 The Z.1012 was powered by three inverted air-cooled inline engines, one mounted in the nose and the other two in long fairings on the wings. There were two engine options, either the 90 kW (120 hp) Alfa-Romeo 110, a four-cylinder unit, or its six-cylinder relative, the 138 kW (185 hp) Alfa-Romeo 115. The more powerful engines raised the top speed by 48 km/h (30 mph) . The main undercarriage units retracted into the engine fairings but the tail wheel was fixed.

Voranc's literary reputation was established during the 1930s with a series of Slovene novels and short stories in the social realist style, notable for their depictions of poverty in rural and industrial areas of Slovenia. His most important novels are Po≈æganica (1939) and Doberdob (1940).Pre≈æihov Voranc, Two short stories, \\"The Self-Sown\\" and \\"Passion above the Precipice,\\" translation and introduction by Irma Marija O≈æbalt, Slovene Writers association (1994) Biography=Formative years Pre≈æihov Voranc was born as Lovro Kuhar in Podgora near Kotlje, a Slovene-speaking village in Carinthia, then part of Austria-Hungary. He was the son of tenant farmers who later acquired their own land. His younger brother, Alojzij Kuhar, became a renowned liberal conservative politician and historian. His pen name is a typical folk formulation derived from the oeconym of the farm the family lived on (the Pre≈æih farm) plus the Carninthian dialect form of the name Lovrenc (or Lovro); thus, Pre≈æihov Voranc literally means 'Lovro from the Pre≈æih farm'. The steep mountain slopes of his homeland were hard to farm, and Voranc consistently returned to his childhood of drudgery and fortitude. He received little formal education beyond primary (elementary) school and later a course in co- operative management. He was, however, a man who wished to educate himself and for much of his life he self studied and read voraciously. In 1909, Voranc's first published work appeared in the Slovene magazine Domaƒçi Prijatelj, edited by the writer Zofka Kveder. It was the first of many short stories for the magazine usually depicting the lives of farm labourers and rural characters from his Carinthian homeland. Between 1911 and 1912, Voranc spent time in Trieste where he became more political aware writing of the travails of social misfits and unemployed drifters for the Social-Democrat newspaper Zarja. Service in World War I At the outbreak of World War I, he was immediately drafted into the Austro-Hungarian Army. He saw action and was captured in 1916 spending the remainder of the war in POW camps in Italy. As a soldier he continued writing often about the psychology of soldiers in warfare drawing on his surroundings and depicting the lives of the soldiers that he knew and with whom he had fought. Political activism Voranc was released in 1919 and returned to a Carinthia that was in political and cultural ferment. He took a job in the offices of a workers' co-operative at the steelworks in Gu≈°tajn. He became increasingly radicalized and a supporter of Carinthian political integration into the newly formed Yugoslav state. He continued to write, and in 1925 he published his first short story Povesti. It was not especially well received by the intelligentsia in Ljubljana; one review dismissed the work as by \\"talented proletarian, a self-taught writer.\\" Nevertheless, it contains \\"elements that were later to develop into his highly acclaimed style.\\"Irma Marija Ana O≈æbalt, Slovene Writers Association, Slovene P.E.N., Ljubljana (1994) In 1930 his political activism and Communist sympathies resulted in a threat of arrest and Voranc absented himself from Carinthia and moved to Vienna and from there, Prague in 1931 and hence to Berlin in 1932. What appears to have been a period of instability in his life was also a period of active collaboration with other socialists in Europe and during the early thirties he also visited Romania, Bulgaria, Greece, Norway, and France. He edited the magazine Delo in Vienna from 1932 to 1934 but fell foul of the Austrian authorities, who imprisoned him in 1937. In the years immediately before the Second World War Voranc was working in Paris as a librarian mixing with other political emigres. Sodobnost In 1933, a new left wing literary review was founded in Slovenia, called Sodobnost, propagating socialist views. Voranc' themes of social realism quickly found favor with the new review's editors, Josip Vidmar, Fran Albreht and Ferdo Kozak. The changing socio-economic conditions of the 1930s necessitated writers who could convey social realism, who could argue and inform and represent the lives of working-class people . Voranc' contributions to Sodobnost established his literary reputation when he was already in his forties. His first story Boj na po≈æiralniku, (in 1982 made into a film of the same title) , Review by Eleanor Mannikka exhibits Voranc's unique style: realistic events of Slovenian life are described within the context of an impressionistic landscape. The characters are as large as the landscape in which they live and their language in vernacular and realistic. The story focuses on a downtrodden family who are in part despised by their better off neighbors, one of whom describes then as ‚Äòpolecats‚Äô. The family exists on the margins of Slovenian society, toiling the land in an endless fight for survival which some of them fail to achieve. Voranc depicts death and children fighting to survive into adulthood. Boj na po≈æiralniku caused a literary sensation and five more stories followed in the years 1935 to 39 which were later collected together as Samorastniki. All deal with peasants lives in the Carinthian mountains, a region that had rarely featured in Slovene literature. The characters speak in the vernacular of the region, they are possessed of a resilient fortitude against the strife of their lives and whilst they are often overly superstitious, egotistical and obdurate Voranc also records them as: faithful, brave, honest and possessing of a religious faith that is true and sincere. In 1939, Sodobnost published a collection of Pre≈æihov Voranc's works under the title Samorastniki. It included Ljubezen na odoru (Passion Above the Precipice) and Vodnjak (The Self-Sown), available in English translations. Voranc left Paris and returned swiftly to Slovenia upon the outbreak of war living in Ljubljana and then in Mokronog. Upon his return he worked on an unfinished novel Po≈æganica that had been started whilst he was in prison in Vienna.The novel set against the background of the end of the Great War is one of his most politically dogmatic and according to one critic 'marred by some overly naturalistic scenes, by over simplification of some characters and by political preaching' . Later novels Austro-Hungarian military cemetery in Doberd√≤ commemorating the fallen of World War I His novel Doberdob, which was published in 1941, had already had a checkered past, with the first two manuscripts seized or stolen.The title of the book referred to Doberdob, slovenskih fantov grob (\\"Doberd√≤, the grave of Slovene lads\\"), a lament to the Slovene dead of the Battle of Doberd√≤ near the village of Doberd√≤ del Lago during the First World War, In fact Voranc subtitles the novel as \\"The War Novel of the Slovenian People\\". The third version is mostly a string of anecdotes and meditations on the lives of the Slovenes. It is a fiercely nationalistic novel surrounding the Battle of Doberd√≤. Doberd√≤ has become the central symbolic place of the Slovene victims of World War I in part because of Voranc's novel. His third novel, Jamnica, is set in a rural Carinthian village between the two wars at a period when the values of rural society are being challenged by increasing industrialization. It remained unpublished until 1946. Axis annexation and the \\"cultural silence\\" In April 1941, following the invasion of Yugoslavia, Nazi Germany annexed northern Slovenia, while Ljubljana and Mokronog were annexed by the Italian troops (and then occupied in 1943 by the Germans). Voranc feared for his life and left Slovenia once again for the Croatian capital Zagreb and then into the Bosnian countryside. However he seems to have had a change of heart and decided to return to Ljubljana for the duration of the war. He did not join the resistance movement but on 11 September he met clandestinely with other writers to proclaim the self-imposed \\"cultural silence,\\" which prohibited publication, exhibitions and performances by Slovene artists for the duration of the war. As a suspected communist sympathizer Voranc was arrested in January 1943 and transported to the Sachsenhausen and Mauthausen-Gusen concentration camps. He returned to Ljubljana at the end of the war sick and depressed and unable to communicate with his family and comrades. He returned to his native village in Carinthia where he ceased political activity and removed himself from the political actualities of the newly formed communist Yugoslavia. He worked on Solzice, a historical novel that remained unfinished at the time of his death in Maribor in 1950. Themes in Voranc's writings As a child and youth, Voranc experienced first hand the back-breaking drudgery of farming steep mountain slopes, and the theme of the farmer fighting the unyielding soil is recurrent in much of his writing. The mountains of Carinthia and the working-class people within them remained at the heart of Voranc's philosophical work. The beauty of the scenery is conveyed against the backdrop of shared toil and camaraderie. Voranc was drawn to the unfortunate and unjustly treated people he witnessed. His experiences during World War I undeniably left a deep impression on his psyche. The reality of war on the mind is especially explored in his novel Doberdob. Voranc wished to convey to his reader the realism of the situation in which his characters lived and there is little that is sentimental about his depictions. Voranc preferred to write about the impoverished peasant and industrial working class against the impressionistic backdrop of a land that sometimes colludes against the peasant. His socialist leanings are key to understanding his later work. During the 1930s, while living away from his homeland, he became more aware of international socialism, although he adapted realism in his work to suit Slovene sensibilities.

Built in the 13th century, the castle stands in a dominant position on a hill south of the parish seat of Alcoutim on the right bank of the San Marcos River (tributary of the Guadiana River), opposite the territory of Sanl√∫car de Guadiana (in Spain). History The medieval walls of the fortress dating back to the early Neolithic Lusitanian castro The interior courtyard of the castle/fortress Various vestiges encountered in the immediate surroundings suggest that a Lusitanian castro may have existed on the site, during the transition from the Neolithic to Chalcolithic periods.Helena Maria Gomes Catarino (1997/98), p.539 The Phoenicians came to this region at the end of the 10th century B.C.E., establishing a trading post under the protection of the Lusitanian castro. The Greeks, in the middle of the 8th century, also founded a colony that quickly dissolved into the Lusitanian population, along with the Celts and Carthaginians. At the beginning of the 2nd century A.D., the Romans conquered Alcoutim at a time when the settlement was a rich centre, dominated by its busy port. The fortress at its centre was transformed into a military base for the occupying forces and political centre, which became known as Alcoutinium. Taken by the Alans in 415, the main square of Alcoutinium slowly fell into ruin, owing to the decrease in mineral exports. The Moors arrived in 715, changing the name to Alcat√¢, yet could not restore the historical political and economic importance to the region. It was only during the period of the Reconquista that the Castle began to gain a specific form. Integrated into the Portuguese Crown after 1240, the monarchs took various steps to increase settlement and establish an authority within the region. They did this by reconstructing and reformulating the defences during the second half of the 13th century. In 1240, Alcoutim was taken by the forces loyal to King Sancho II of Portugal, who ordered the reconstruction of the castle and wall to defend the population. At the same time, Sancho elevated the settlement to the status of town. King Denis of Portugal restored the castle and walls during his reign, at the same time (1304) conceding a foral (charter) to the settlement, transferring its title to the Order of S√£o Tiago.Valdemar Coutinho (1997), p.28 Unfortunately, little remains of the primitive medieval castle. In fact, there are no monographs that depict the transition between the Moorish settlement and early Portuguese settlements What did remain were the two ogive gates, which hinted as to its Gothic military structure. It was in this fortress that King Ferdinand of Portugal and Henry II of Castile signed a peace treaty; the defensive construction on the Guadiana River would continue to be an important buttress to Spanish authority in the region. King John II of Portugal and, later, King Manuel of Portugal would continue to repair and maintain the fortress. During the reign of Manuel of Portugal the Castle was constructed and elements of its Gothic architecture were replaced by rational fortifications and proto-modernist characteristics. In the book \\"Livrod das Fortelezas\\"Duarte d'Armas (around 1509) described the fortress as a rectangular plan that included no towers and accessible from one of the fa√ßades. Its walls were uniformly divided in two, and the exterior, there existed a few buildings supporting the structure. During the Portuguese Restoration War, in 1640, new restoration and maintenance continued on the fortress, including the batteries of Cortadoiro and Santa B√°rbara (which were designed to batter the Spanish border region). To this end, a landing was built towards the border and the fortress actively played a part in the context of the war.Valdemar Coutinho (1997), p.30 But, this was the last phase of the fortifications importance: the fortress began a steady decline in military and political influence in the following decades. The Castle was eventually abandoned and began serving in various civic purposes (including slaughterhouse around 1878). The General-Directorate for Buildings and National Monuments () first began focused maintenance in 1961, with restoration work on the masonry, which had become loose (and again in 1967), and re-construction and consolidation of parts of the walls. In 1969, many of the houses in states of ruin were demolished to unobstructed segments of the main walls. In 1977, the DGMEN continued to restore segments of the castle, including the merlons, repairing cracks in the wall, using reinforced concrete and installing a new main gate. But, in 1979, a new phase of construction resulted in the demolition of the masonry and roof of the main magazine. Three years later (1981), restoration works included: construction of the hydraulic lift in order to recuperate an access staircase to the battlements and reconstruction of the batteries and bulwarks. Following public works to maintain the walls in 1985, the building received electrical illumination in the exterior in 1988. After 1992, the municipal council established a plan to develop the grounds for tourism and construct an archaeological museum for the municipality (under the architect Fernando Varanda).Gradim (2003), p.342 In 2000 a museum in the center of the castle was officially opened to the public. It was most recently renovated in 2011 and covers the archaeological heritage of the castle and the region around it from the Neolithic to the Modern Period.Visiting Alcoutim. https://www.wetravelportugal.com. Retrieved 9 April 2020. In a building separate to the main museum is a permanent exhibition covering Islamic board games from the Moorish period. The castle and museum are open everyday of the year except January 1st, December 24th, 25th and 31st.Alcoutim Concelho. http://www.cm-alcoutim.pt. Retrieved 9 April 2020. Architecture The structure is based on the intersection of two architectural styles, that includes both a medieval castle and medieval fort. Both are based in an irregular plan and consist of a structure identifiable by merlons (the medieval) and composed of artillery batteries and bulwarks guarding the river (the modern elements). It is situated in an urban environment, on a hilltop overlooking the Ribeira de S√£o Marcos, alongside the confluence of the Guadiana River (that borders the Spanish frontier town of S√£o Lucar). A castle that protected its medieval town, the walls of the fortress circles the settlement of Alcoutim.

Proposed dam and reservoir The proposed dam would be of zoned earthfill construction and would be 11 kilometres-long. It would be designed with the potential to install a 15 MW hydroelectric plant. The reservoir would have a storage capacity of 2,700 million cubic meters, and would be the second largest in Nigeria after the Kainji Dam. It would irrigate 120,000 hectares of arable land on which cash crops could be grown. Potentially the project would support production of one million tonnes of sugarcane annually and provide over one million jobs in industries related to agriculture. Project history The dam was first considered after the 1972-1974 drought in the Sahel, and during the Shehu Shagari regime in 1979-1982 a contract was awarded to Julius Berger Nigeria to build the dam. In 1984 the contract was terminated, but it was reinstated in 1992 by the Ibrahim Babangida regime. In 1994 the Sani Abacha regime terminated the contract again, and set up a judicial committee of inquiry into all aspects of the project. In 2002, funding was allocated for the project, but then abruptly withdrawn. In 2008 Governor Isa Yuguda of Bauchi State awarded a contract to the Dangote Group to restart the abandoned dam project, a move that was supported by Abdul Ahmed Ningi, a Bauchi state representative who was House Leader in the National Assembly when the project was cancelled in 2002. Controversy Arguments in favor of the dam from supporters in Bauchi State include the benefits of irrigation for agriculture in the area, such as sugar cane crops, while controlled releases would avoid downstream impact. Opponents in downstream Yobe State and Borno State argue that the dam will prevent the seasonal floods that their farmers depend upon for farming, and will cause the water table to drop, with much water being lost to evaporation. Environmentalists are also concerned about the impact on downstream wetlands. Floodplain farmers and fishermen use water much more efficiently than farmers who rely on irrigation from dams. A study funded by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) estimated that the economic value of water in the downstream Hadejia-Jama'are floodplain was US$32.00 per 1,000 m3, while the value of water in the Kano River Project, irrigated by the Tiga Dam and the Challawa Gorge Dam was US$1.73 per 1,000 m3, or US$0.04 per 1,000 m3 after accounting for operational costs. The study estimated that if implemented, even with a regulated flooding regime to reduce downstream impact, the Kafin Zaki dam project would have negative value of around US$15 million. In April 2009 Dr. Hassan Bidliya, Administrative Secretary of the Hadejia-Jama'are-Komadugu-Yobe Basin Trust Fund, advised that any decision should be deferred until the Environmental Impact Assessment on the project had been completed. In September 2009, three farmers‚Äô associations in downstream Borno State called for the federal government and Bauchi State government to shelve the project, concerned about the impact on their livelihood. In August 2009, Senator Ahmed Ibrahim Lawan of Yobe North, Chairman of the Senate Committee on Public Accounts, spoke against the proposed dam. He stated that the Tiga and Challawa dams on the Hadejia River had already reduced downstream water flow drastically, and the Jama'are River was now the main source of water in the Yobe River. He said the dams caused intense poverty, increased desert encroachment, migration and conflicts between arable farmers and herdsmen.

It is a little-known monument, now in ruins, used for the protection of the people of the village and surrounding area from attacks by north African pirates. History The ancient fortification had its base in a Lusitanian castro settlement, that likely existed between the Neolithic to Chalcolithic transition. It was conquered by the Romans, in 198 AD, and transformed into a military base that was served by the ports of Arma√ß√£o and Pera. During its occupation by north African Arabs in the 12th century, the ancient stone walls were constructed, allowing the protection of the space until the 13th century. It is likely that the civil parish/village first received its name from the Arabic \\"al-qantar√¢\\", named from a local bridge, on the road between two of the more prestigious provinces of Al-Andalus (Faro and Silves). The castle was conquered from the Moors by D. Paio Peres Correia, during the reign of Afonso III of Portugal, who sought to command the area by re-building the castle walls. The walls were strengthened and remodeled during the 16th century, under King Sebastian of Portugal, who controversially resulted in the dis-figuration of the Muslim castle. In 1573, when the monarch passed through the locality, he was determined to improve the redoubt, whose strategic importance continued during this epoch: it was seen as a bastion to maritime attacks and guarded areas that could be used as eventual disembarkation points. Although, there were reports that the structure sustained major damages following the 1755 Lisbon earthquake there were no documented resources that confirm the extent of these damages. Yet, it is clear that its decline began after this period. It was similarly restored after the Portuguese Restoration Wars in order to defend the region from Spanish attacks. Architecture The original structure of the Castle, its formal layout and extent are still unclear, owing to its destruction and degradation. Many of the typical features of the medieval castle are missing, including towers, doors and complimentary systems of defence. The ovular layout of the streets of Alcantarilha presuppose a Gothic layout to the structure, that may have occurred following the invasions of King Afonso III of Portugal. The castle consists of little more than a limestone wall to a height of . A simple door in the southeast and a rectangular window-like slit (four metres above the surface) in the northwest are the only vestiges of the battlements. Another segment of the wall is addorsed to the northwest corner of a courtyard of a two-story residential building, while to the southeast, in the local market, there are wedges of masonry painted yellow and clinched into the eaves and gabled roof. The castle continues to wait for formal archaeological investigations within the village in order to determine the extent of artefacts and vestiges of this structure.

With any mention of homosexuality in mainstream United States comics forbidden by the Comics Code Authority (CCA) until 1989, earlier attempts at exploring these issues in the US took the form of subtle hints or subtext regarding a character's sexual orientation. LGBT themes were tackled earlier in underground comix from the early 1970s onward. Independently published one-off comic books and series, often produced by gay creators and featuring autobiographical storylines, tackled political issues of interest to LGBT readers. Mainstream comics‚Äîthe genre of superhero comics published in the United States since the late 1930s‚Äîhave historically excluded gay characters, and the superhero genre and its two largest publishing houses, Marvel Comics and DC Comics, have been criticised for their lack of inclusivity. Transgender characters have likewise been under-represented, although the common storyline of a superhero having their sex changed by magical or technological means has been regarded as an oblique reference to transgender and transsexual issues. Queer theory analyses have noted that LGBT characters in mainstream comic books are often shown as assimilated into heterosexual society, whereas in alternative comics the diversity and uniqueness of LGBT culture is at the forefront. Mainstream comics have also been labelled as \\"heteronormative\\", in comparison to \\"integrationist\\" alternative comics. Since the 1990s LGBT themes have become more common in mainstream US comics, including in a number of titles in which a gay character is the star. Censorship, criticism and inclusivity For much of the 20th century, creators were strongly discouraged from depicting gay relationships in comic books, which were regarded as a medium for children. Until 1989 the Comics Code Authority (CCA), which imposed de facto censorship on comics sold through newsstands in the United States, forbade any suggestion of homosexuality, and LGBT characters were excluded from comics bearing the CCA seal. The CCA itself came into being in response to Fredric Wertham's Seduction of the Innocent, in which comic book creators were accused of attempting to negatively influence children with images of violence and sexuality, including subliminal homosexuality. Wertham claimed that Wonder Woman's strength and independence made her a lesbian, and stated that \\"The Batman type of story may stimulate children to homosexual fantasies.\\" Storytellers subsequently had to drop subtle hints while not stating directly a character's orientation. Overt gay and lesbian themes were first found later in underground and alternative titles which did not carry the CCA's seal of approval. In recent years the number of LGBT characters in mainstream superhero comics has increased greatly. At first gay characters appeared in supporting roles, but their roles have become increasingly prominent. The trend has prompted both praise from the LGBT community and organizations like the Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation (GLAAD), and criticism from conservative groups. Critics make regular accusations that comics are attempting to subvert readers into a \\"gay lifestyle\\", trying to \\"lure young American boys into the kinky web of homosexuality and AIDS\\". According to writer Devin Grayson, the amount of creative freedom allowed by editors in the portrayal of LGBT characters depends upon how popular and established a character already is. Long-standing characters that would require a retcon to change their sexuality are less likely to be shown as LGBT than newer characters. When such changes to a character's continuity are made, fans are often disgruntled, particularly when sexuality is involved,Furey, p. 4 and Alan Moore suggests that creating a new character is preferable. Scott Lobdell claims that it is more often the fans, rather than editors, that have stronger negative reaction to LGBT issues. Moore notes however, that \\"it's probably quite fashionable... to have the odd gay character,\\" and that the inclusion of LGBT people continues to improve in mainstream comics, but that the characters continue to be limited by stereotypes and do not represent a varied cross- section of LGBT people. Greg Rucka says that some scenes of same-sex interactions are rejected by editors due to unease with sexual content in general rather than the LGBT content. On the other hand, inclusion of LGBT issues attract media attention, in which the hype makes some fans and creators uncomfortable. Podcaster Faust points out for example, that gay marriage in a comic issue is treated almost as an ‚Äúevent‚Äù, when that series had already been significant with openly gay characters. Lobdell, while wondering about the attention media gives gay characters, hopes that in the near future, they will not ‚Äúmake the news at all, because they are as common as capes and cowls.‚Äù DC=Pre-1990s The Encyclopedia of Gay Histories and Cultures (2000) notes that gay subtext can be found in DC Comics publications as early as the Golden Age of Comic Books, with readers inferring homosexuality between superheroes and their same-sex sidekicks and on the women-only Paradise Island. Batman's relationship with Robin has famously come under scrutiny, in spite of the majority of creators associated with the character denying that the character is gay. Psychologist Fredric Wertham, who in Seduction of the Innocent asserted that \\"Batman stories are psychologically homosexual,\\" claimed to find a \\"subtle atmosphere of homoeroticism which pervades the adventures of the mature 'Batman' and his young friend 'Robin.'\\" It has also been claimed that Batman is interesting to gay audiences because \\"he was one of the first fictional characters to be attacked on the grounds of his presumed homosexuality,\\" and \\"the 1960s TV series remains a touchstone of camp.\\" Frank Miller has described the Joker as a \\"homophobic nightmare,\\" and views Batman as sublimating his sexual urges into crime fighting. Burt Ward has also remarked upon this interpretation in his autobiography, noting that the relationship between the two could be interpreted as a sexual one. When creating the character of Jericho in Teen Titans, Marv Wolfman and George Perez considered making him gay, which would have marked one of the first appearances of a gay character in a major super hero book. However, they ultimately passed on the idea after concluding that it would be too stereotypical to make the sensitive, artistic, effeminate featured Jericho a homosexual. One Autostraddle reviewer, Mey Rude, noted that one early example of a \\"not-quite-trans recurring character\\" was in the 1940 Action Comics #20 with Ultra-Humanite, a villain to superman, was killed, but he kidnaps a famed actress, placing \\"his mighty brain in her young vital body.\\" Two issues later, in no. 22, this version of Ultra-Humanite is gone with the character instead transferring his \\"consciousness into the body of an albino ape.\\" Many years later, in the 1980s, in the Camelot 3000 series, one night, Sir Tristan, is \\"reincarnated as a woman,\\" tries to change back into a man for much of the comic, but ultimately accepts it. Rude criticized this as showing a \\"lack of awareness of real life trans people that comics had.\\" The first obviously gay character was Extra√±o, an effeminate Hispanic man whose name means \\"Strange\\" in Spanish, who was created by Steve Englehart and Joe Staton and appeared in Millennium and New Guardians in 1987.First appearance in Millennium #2 (1987) New Guardians was not successful, but during its short run it also featured a character dying of AIDS. An official aftermath to Millennium, The Spectre (vol. 2) #11, depicted a \\"mostly male and mostly gay\\" AIDS rally. Several characters, including the Enchantress (describing them as \\"filthy disgusting men\\") and a police helicopter pilot named Ed (screaming about \\"fags\\") are influenced into attempting to crush the rally by a seven-headed spirit. Thanks to the actions of the Spectre, Doctor Fate, Deadman, Madame Xanadu, and Ben Turner, the men are saved. Previous to this, in the hugely influential Watchmen (1986), one of the central characters, Ozymandias, is referred to as \\"possibly homosexual\\" by Rorschach, who critics have interpreted as asexual.Watchmen #1 (1986) The series also strongly implied that minor characters the Hooded Justice and Captain Metropolis were gay, and that Silhouette was kicked off the Minutemen superhero team when she was publicly outed as a lesbian. In Watchmen and Philosophy, Mark White and William Irwin write that the gay relationships in Watchmen remain ambiguous as \\"lots of heteros are icked out by homos\\", and also that Watchmen is particularly surprising and challenges preconceptions of homosexuality, as \\"if it's true that Hooded Justice and Captain Metropolis are gay, they sure as heck don't act or look like they are gay\\". Alan Moore was described by AfterElton.com writer Lyle Masaki as \\"very gay friendly\\", due to his inclusion of complex LGBT characters and realistic treatment of LGBT issues in Watchmen and V for Vendetta. 1990s The early 1990s saw a few more LGBT minor characters portrayed in DC titles. Transsexual themes were explored in a 1992 storyline in Legion of Super-Heroes, in which Element Lad finds out that Shvaughn Erin, the woman he is in love with, is actually a man who has taken a sex-change drug to be with him; Element Lad subsequently reveals that he prefers Shvaughn as a male.In The Legion of Super-Heroes #31 (1992) A lesbian relationship was also implied between the Legion of Super-Heroes' Shrinking Violet and Lightning Lass, but all these non-heterosexual characters were retconned during the Zero Hour \\"reboot\\" to be straight. Camelot 3000 also explored transsexual themes by having Sir Tristan reincarnated into the body of a woman, to his initial dismay.Camelot 3000 #1‚Äì12 (1997) Notable storylines featuring LGBT themes include the 1991‚Äôs The Flash (vol. 2) #53, which had received the first GLAAD Award for Best Comic Book in 1992. Here, the reformed villain Pied Piper was revealed as gay. Another is the coming out of Kyle Rayner's assistant and an arc about his \\"gay bashing\\" in Green Lantern, both written by Judd Winick.In Green Lantern #137 (June 2001) and #154 (November 2001) These stories earned the writer title two GLAAD awards and a Gaylactic Spectrum Awards (and a further nomination). Green Lantern also has a lesbian couple, Lee and Li, as supporting characters. The 1990s title Doom Patrol introduced a number of LGBT characters and explored transsexual themes. Doom Patrol's base of operations in later stories is the sentient transvestite street Danny the Street. Danny is named after British female impersonator Danny La Rue, and \\"dresses in drag\\" by hosting typically masculine shops (such as gun shops), but decorating them in bright frilly patterns and pastel curtains.\\" His inclusion is described by Timothy Callahan as part of the \\"increasingly absurd\\" tone of the book from the twentieth issue.Created by Grant Morrison and Brendan McCarthy and first appeared in Doom Patrol vol. 2, #35 (August 1990). One member of the team is the transsexual, bisexual Coagula, who can coagulate liquids and dissolve solids, created by transsexual fantasy writer Rachel Pollack. Coagula gains her powers while working as a prostitute: One of her customers is Rebis, a radioactive hermaphrodite and Coagula gains her powers after having sex with them.First appearance in DC Comics has a number of imprints, including Wildstorm and Vertigo. Wildstorm was originally a studio producing work for Image Comics, which is noted to have a greater proportion of LGBT characters. Vertigo is an imprint that produces comics for more mature audiences, allowing more sexual themes. George Haggerty notes in Gay histories and cultures: an encyclopedia that \\"substantive mainstream presentation of gay themes in the future seems most likely in DC's adult-orientated Vertigo titles.\\" Vertigo titles that have tackled LGBT themes include the Sandman, Shade, The Changing Man and Enigma. The Sandman: A Game of You (1991) had a transsexual character, and its creator Neil Gaiman said that he included transgender characters in his works in response to the lack of realistic representation of such people in comics. The title character of Shade, the Changing Man was an alien who could change his surface form: This resulted in people sometimes perceiving him as female, and although he remained essentially male, it was implied that he had relationships with both genders. Enigma (1992) deconstructed the superhero genre, with the title characters homosexuality playing a large part. John Constantine, the protagonist of Hellblazer was first hinted as bisexual in 1992, and confirmed in 2002.Hellblazer #51 (1992)Hellblazer #170 (2002) In the television series however, Constantine was portrayed straight due to NBC guidelines, which brought on criticism from both critics and fans. An example of a gay character in a starring role is the violent vigilante superhero Midnighter, who appears in comic books first published by Wildstorm.First appearance Stormwatch (vol. 2) #4 (1998) The Batman-like Midnighter was revealed to be in a relationship with the Superman-like Apollo during their time as members of the superhero team The Authority. The portrayal of the relationship was initially subtle, with writer Warren Ellis not informing the artist of his intentions. However, the DC editorial board still censored a kiss between the two characters in 2000. Described as the \\"first openly gay couple in comics,\\" Midnighter and Apollo married in a later issue and have an adopted daughter. Midnighter starred in his own solo title from 2006; the Midnighter comic was criticised by Fran√ßois Peneaud for ignoring the protagonist's relationship with his husband, and also for the continual use of homophobic insults by villains. Criticism has also been leveled at a storyline in which Apollo is raped, with critics saying that straight superheroes are never subjected to such treatment. Alan Moore pointed to the characters as an example of comics' \\"strange attitude\\" towards LGBT themes, describing them as \\"vicious muscle queens.\\"Furey, p.1 Starting 2015, Midnighter once again stars in his own solo series, published from DC Comics, making him the first gay male superhero to have his own series in a mainstream publisher. The 1990s also brought with it more almost trans characters. In the 1992 issue of Legion of Super-Heroes #31, Shvaughn Erin was revealed to be male, born with the dead name of Sean, taking a drug to transition into a female form because he was in love with a male superhero. This portrayal was criticized for a lack of knowledge about trans characters, saying that the writers of this comic seemed to think that \\"trans women are just gay men who want to date straight men.\\" A few years later, in 1997, Comet appeared in the Supergirl comics and was revealed to be a shapeshifter who could alternate between a bisexual woman named Andrea Martinez and the male centaur named Comet. It was also a time where there was a \\"rise of alternative comics at DC,\\" which gave more roles to trans characters. 2000s Manhunter, created by Mark Andreyko in 2004, caused reaction in the fan community when it was revealed that the boyfriend of the title character's gay co-counsel was long-time Infinity, Inc. member Obsidian. Obsidian had a number of failed heterosexual romances in Infinity, Inc. and while a member of the Justice League, and later struggled to come to terms with his sexuality, but it wasn't until his appearances in Manhunter that the character was revealed to be gay and to have accepted his homosexuality. Andreyko said that making the character openly gay could be seen as a retcon, but that this seemed a logical step in character's growth. In 2006, one character, Erik Storn, was given superpowers allowing him to change into a female superhero, while two years later, Loki, was portrayed as a woman from 2008 to 2009. Later on, Al Ewing in Loki: Agent of Asgard to say \\"Loki is bi...He‚Äôll shift between genders occasionally as well,\\" resulting in one reviewer saying that Loki could be seen as trans. Homosexual interpretations of Batman have continued into the 21st century. One notable example occurred in 2000, when DC Comics refused permission for the reprinting of four panels (from Batman #79, 92, 105, and 139) to illustrate Christopher York's paper All in the Family: Homophobia and Batman Comics in the 1950s. In summer 2005, painter Mark Chamberlain displayed a number of watercolours depicting both Batman and Robin in suggestive and sexually explicit poses. DC threatened both the artist and the Kathleen Cullen Fine Arts gallery with legal action if they did not cease selling the works and demanded the surrender of all remaining art, as well as any profits derived from them. In 2006 DC drew widespread media attention by announcing a new, lesbian incarnation of the well-known character Batwoman even while openly lesbian characters such as Gotham City police officer Renee Montoya already existed in DC Comics. It was revealed at the 2009 New York Comic Con that she would be DC Comics' highest profile gay superhero, appearing in a new Justice League comic book written by James Robinson and taking over as the lead character in Detective Comics with issue #854. Greg Rucka said that DC's editors had no problem with his writing Montoya or Batwoman as lesbian, but the media controversy over Batwoman's sexuality \\"nullified any positive effect Batwoman might have had on the industry\\" and forced the character into minor roles during major crossover storylines. In 2011 Batwoman gained her own title as part of The New 52 DC comics relaunch. This makes her the first LGBT character to headline a monthly series in the DC Universe. In 2006, Gail Simone brought back the Secret Six as a team of villains with new members, in which many are LGBT, including lesbian Scandal Savage, her lover Knockout, pansexual Rag Doll, bisexual Jeannette, and Catman, who is also bisexual. Secret Six relaunched in December 2014, with Gail Simone returning as the writer. Scandal Savage, Rag Doll, and Jeannette return as recurring characters. The team consists of new members save Catman, and among them, Porcelain is genderfluid. 2010s In Earth 2, Green Lantern Alan Scott was revealed as gay. In issue 3, Scott is revealed to have a boyfriend named Sam, to whom he intends to propose while on vacation in China. Before he can do so, however, the train on which the couple is travelling is suddenly wrecked. A mysterious green flame protects Scott and heals him; a disembodied voice informs him that the crash was caused by a force that threatens the whole world, and that Sam did not survive. The grief-stricken Scott is then told that he will be given the power to avenge his love and protect the world. Alongside Batwoman, DC also released a series starring Voodoo, a bisexual African American woman, as part of The New 52 relaunch. The same relaunch also introduced Bunker, an openly gay Latino superhero, as part of the core cast of the new Teen Titans series.http://www.latina.com/lifestyle/news/teen-titans-welcomes-new-gay- latino-superhero Demon Knights brought back Shining Knight, who previously appeared in Grant Morrison‚Äôs Seven Soldiers of Victory as a girl crossdressing as a male knight. In the new series however, The Shining Knight says that he is ‚Äúnot just a man or a woman[, but] both.‚ÄùDemon Knights #14 (2012) This makes him the possible first intersex hero. The number of minor DC characters being identified as LGBT continues to increase, including bisexual superheroes Sarah Rainmaker and Icemaiden, as well as major ones such as Catwoman. and Jericho.Deathstroke (vol. 4) #6-7 In Catwoman #39, she was confirmed bisexual, which critics claim iconic, as she is one of the most famous characters in the DC Universe. Furthermore, DC Comics officially stated that Harley Quinn and Poison Ivy, whose relationship many fans have speculated as romantic or sexual, are ‚Äúgirlfriends without the jealousy of monogamy.‚Äù In 2016, Sensation Comics featured Wonder Woman officiating a same-sex wedding (Issue #48) drawn by Australian illustrator Jason Badower. Inspired by the June Supreme Court ruling that established marriage equality in all 50 United States, Badower says DC Comics was \\"fantastic\\" about his idea for the issue. In an interview with The Sydney Morning Herald, he said his editor \\"Was like 'great, I love it! Let's do it. It was almost anticlimactic.\\" http://www.advocate.com/arts- entertainment/2015/08/20/wonder-woman-performs-same-sex-wedding-new-comic Wonder Woman Fights for Marriage Equality Wonder Woman's advocacy for gay rights was taken a step further in September 2016, when comic book writer Greg Rucka announced that she is canonically bisexual, according to her rebooted Rebirth origin.http://www.nydailynews.com/life-style/woman-bisexual-dc-comics- article-1.2813018 Rucka stated that in his opinion, she \\"has to be\\" queer and has \\"obviously\\" had same-sex relationships on an island surrounded by beautiful women. This follows the way Wonder Woman was written in the alternate continuity or non-canon Earth One by Grant Morrison,https://www.ign.com/articles/2016/04/06/grant-morrison-on-wonder- woman-earth-ones-birth-race-and-sexuality-changes and fellow Wonder Woman writer Gail Simone staunchly supported Rucka's statement.https://www.inverse.com/article/21755-gail-simone-wonder-woman-queer Surprised at the amount of backlash from her fanbase, Rucka responded to \\"haters\\" that consensual sex with women is just as important to Wonder Woman as the Truth is to Superman.http://io9.gizmodo.com/greg-rucka-says-haters- need-to-get-over-it-about-wond-1787537688 Marvel=1990s Marvel Comics' incorporation of LGBT themes has been unfavorably compared with that of DC; its use of gay characters has been described as \\"less prolific but more deliberate\\". Some reviewers have pointed out in Alpha Flight #45, in 1987, there was an \\"almost\\" trans character: Sasquatch. He was \\"killed,\\" with his soul transferred into a woman's body, meaning that he had a female body when human, and male when in his \\"Sasquatch form.\\" More broadly, Marvel reportedly had a \\"No Gays in the Marvel Universe\\" policy during Jim Shooter's 1980s tenure, and Marvel's policy from the 1990s had stated that all series emphasizing solo gay characters must carry an \\"Adults Only\\" label, in response to conservative protests. Yet in 2006 publisher Joe Quesada claimed that this policy is no longer in force. Although same-sex couples are depicted occasionally kissing, intimate or sexual scenes have not been shown, even in Marvel's \\"Adult only\\" imprint. The use of mutants and the discrimination they face in the X-Men comics has been seen as a metaphor for the real-world discrimination directed at minority groups including LGBT people.Kaplan, p.59 Alpha Flight‚Äôs Northstar, a member of the original Alpha Flight superhero team, was the first major gay character created by Marvel Comics. Creator John Byrne said that Northstar was planned to be gay from his inception in 1979,Haggerty, p.326 but although hints about Northstar's sexual identity appeared during 1983 in issues 7 and 8 of Alpha Flight, his apparent lack of interest in women was attributed to his obsessive drive to win as a ski champion. The character was finally revealed to be gay in 1992's Alpha Flight issue 106, the only comic book issue to have been inducted into the Gaylactic Hall of Fame. Storylines involving Northstar have included an illness seen by some readers as a metaphor for AIDS, which was cured when it revealed that the character is actually a part \\"fairy\\", a race of non-human beings. Northstar also adopts an abandoned baby, which soon dies of AIDS. Criticism has been levelled at the fact that in 30 years Northstar has never been shown kissing another man, although many interactions with other gay characters are shown, as in the Marvel Swimsuit Special, in which he is shown socializing with the gay Pantheon member Hector. After the cancellation of Alpha Flight Northstar appeared in his own miniseries, which mostly ignored his sexuality, and eventually became a member of the X-Men. During his time in this team he became a mentor to gay teenage mutant Anole, who later became a Young X-Men member along with another gay teen, Graymalkin. Notable also in Northstar's tenure in the X-Men was his death in three separate continuities in the same month. Other LGBT members of Marvel's mutant teams were X-Statix's Phat, Vivisector, and Bloke (until their deaths) and the villain Mystique, the latter having been in a relationship with the character Destiny, although this was not explicitly revealed until years after the relationship had ended with Destiny's murder. 2000s Freedom Ring was a character depicted as gay from his debut by his creator Robert Kirkman. Joe Quesada touted him as Marvel Comics' leading gay hero, with stories dedicated to his adventures in Marvel Team-Up. Despite this, the character was killed one month later. His death and general treatment was met with some negative reactions, including accusations of homophobia, particularly with respect to the phallic imagery of the death, with the character being killed by being impaled with spikes.Prism Comics Kirkman commented on the controversy, stating \\"Freedom Ring was always planned as an inexperienced hero who would get beaten up constantly and probably die. I wanted to comment on the fact that most superheroes get their powers and are okay at it... and that's not how life works. During working on the book, I was also noticing that most gay characters... are all about being gay. Straight characters are well-rounded characters who like chicks. So I wanted to do a well-rounded character who just happened to like dudes. Then I decided to combine the two ideas. In hindsight, yeah, killing a gay character is no good when there are so few of them... but I really had only the best of intentions in mind.\\"Robert Kirkman. Image Comics Community ‚Äì Freedom Ring Controversy http://www.imagecomics.com Image Comics March 25, 2005. Retrieved November 4, 2008. Kirkman later stated, \\"Frankly, with the SMALL amount of gay characters in comics in general, and how unfortunate the portrayals have been thus far, whether intentional or not‚ÄîI completely understand the backlash on the death of Freedom Ring, regardless of my intentions. If I had it to do all over again... I wouldn't kill him. I regret it more and more as time goes on. I got rid of what? 20% of the gay characters at Marvel by killing off this ONE character. I just never took that stuff into consideration while I was writing.\\" In the 2000s there was the introduction of two characters who were almost trans: Jessica Drew, a \\"female clone of Peter Parker,\\" and Courier, a shapeshifting friend who becomes \\"trapped in a female form by the evil Mr. Sinister.\\" There was also the advent of Xavin, a shapeshifter in the Runaways with Xavin originally male but changes to a female form, saying in issue no. 8 that \\"for us changing our gender is no different than changing our hair color.\\" While Autostraddle's Mey Rude says that she does not consider Xavin to represent the human trans experience, the character explored gender changes in \\"a way that was pretty revolutionary for a comic book character.\\" In 2002, Marvel revived Rawhide Kid in their Marvel MAX imprint, introducing the first openly gay comic book character to star in his own magazine. The first edition of the Rawhide Kid‚Äôs gay saga was called Slap Leather. According to a CNN.com article, ‚ÄúThe new series pairs the original artist, John Severin, now 86, with Ron Zimmerman, a television writer. Making the Rawhide Kid gay was Zimmerman‚Äôs idea. The character‚Äôs sexuality is conveyed indirectly, through euphemisms and puns, and the comic‚Äôs style is campy. Conservative groups protested the gay take on the character, which they claimed would corrupt children, and the covers carried an \\"Adults only\\" label. The Young Avengers series, which debuted in 2005, featured two gay teenager major characters, Hulkling and Wiccan, from its inception. The characters' sexuality was criticised by some readers and defended by the writers in an extended series of letters on the title's letters page. The Young Avengers earned Marvel its first (and to date only) GLAAD Award Best Comic Book Award in 2005. Hulkling was originally planned to be a female character: According to Tom Brevoort, \\"Originally, Allan pitched Hulkling as a female character using her shape-changing abilities to pose as a man. I suspect this was as close as Allan felt he could get to depicting an openly gay relationship in a Marvel comic. But as we got underway... he started to have second thoughts and approached me about maintaining Hulkling and Wiccan as two involved male characters.\\"Xtra: In print Young Avengers In the latest incarnation of X-Factor, written by Peter David, depowered mutant Rictor and his longtime friend Shatterstar (with whom he'd had an ambiguous relationship)See, for example: Cable #22, X-Force #56, X-Force #59‚Äì60, X-Force #60, X-Force ‚Äô99 Annual were shown in an on-panel kiss.X-Factor v.3 #45 After the issue was published, Peter David confirmed Rictor and Shatterstar's bisexuality in his blog and expressed his desire to develop the relationship between them further. Shortly after, one of Shatterstar's creators, Rob Liefeld, expressed his disapproval of Peter David's decision.Kevin Melrose. \\"Liefeld ‚Äòcan‚Äôt wait to someday undo‚Äô Shatterstar development\\" Comic Book Resources; July 3, 2009 Despite his complaints, however, both Peter David and Marvel editor-in-chief Joe Quesada have defended the development, and the story will most likely go on as planned.Comic Book Resources Joe Quesada and Kiel Phegley. \\"Cup O' Joe\\" Comic Book Resources; July 14, 2009  2010s  2012‚Äôs Astonishing X-Men #51 held Northstar and his long-term partner, Kyle Jinadu‚Äôs wedding. Though it is not the first same-sex marriage to be featured in superhero comics, as Apollo and Midnighter had married in The Authority, this is the first in mainstream comics. Due to flirtations with characters of various genders and sexuality, fans have speculated Deadpool as pan- or omnisexual. Writers Gerry Duggan and Gail Simone, as well as Terry Miller, the director of the Deadpool film, accepts the fan theory. However, Fabian Nicieza, one of the creators of the character, stated on Twitter that such speculation on his sexuality is invalid because his ‚Äúbrain cells are in CONSTANT FLUX. He can be gay one minute, hetero the next, etc.‚Äù The comment upset many fans, for it suggests that Deadpool‚Äôs sexuality is linked to his mental disorder. Hercules, in previous works such as Hercules: Fall of an Avenger and X-Treme X-Men have been portrayed as bisexual.Hercules: Fall of an Avenger (2010), X-Treme X-Men #10 (2013) However, Marvel‚Äôs editor-in-chief Axel Alonso stated that Hercules in the new series will be heterosexual, which disappointed fans and critics for ‚Äústraightwashing‚Äù an LGBT character. Other recent major characters that have confirmed to be LGBT include Iceman, who came out as gay, and Loki, who is now genderfluid and bisexual.Uncanny X-Men #600 Other publishers: Malibu, Image, Dark Horse The 1990s saw the creation of a number of independent publishing houses with output that competed with the giants of mainstream comics publishing, Marvel and DC. The companies included Malibu Comics, Image Comics and later, Dark Horse Comics. These companies gave greater artistic freedom to their writers and artists and chose not to ascribe to the Comics Code, allowing exploration of more mature themes. As a result, comics from these companies included a greater relative number of LGBT characters and storylines than their more traditional competitors.Lopes (2009), p.139. LGBT superhero characters include Spectral and Turbo Charge (from Malibu comics), and Promethea and Gen13's Sarah Rainmaker (both created by Wildstorm for Image Comics before being taken over by DC).Lopes (2009), p.140. Image comic's A Distant Soil, written by Colleen Doran, depicts an alien culture with exotic gender and sexual mores and gay romances that gained the series a Gaylactic Spectrum Award nomination. Others notes that Malibu had, in the series Mantra, \\"an immortal male superhero soul who was reincarnated into the body of a woman\\" who is only \\"almost\\" trans, but not fully a trans characters, and in Rising Stars a possibly trans character named Joshua Cane. Dark Horse's Buffy the Vampire Slayer-related comics feature the lesbian characters of Willow, Tara and Kennedy and the closeted character Andrew from the television series. The Buffy Season Eight comics attracted media attention when the title character has a one night stand with another girl who had fallen in love with her.Buffy Season Eight #12 (March 2008) and #15 (June 2008) The encounter was repeated, but both the character and the creators denied that this made Buffy gay, with Joss Whedon saying: \\"We're not going to make her gay, nor are we going to take the next 50 issues explaining that she's not. She's young and experimenting, and did I mention open-minded?\\". Archie featured their first gay character, Kevin Keller, in 2010. The American Family Association spoke out against the character and issues containing same-sex romance, but Veronica #202 had been so popular it sold out, resulting in his own solo series. Mey Rude, writing for Autostraddle, stated that the vast majority of actual trans representation happened from 2013 forward, which she considered the \\"Golden Age of Trans Comics,\\" noting comics like Bitch Planet(by Kelly Sue DeConnick), The Unbeatable Squirrel Girl (by Erika Henderson), and various anthologies. This came with more comics being funded through crowdfunding sites and created by trans people, resulting in a \\"new kind of trans representation by the trans people, of the trans people and for the trans people.\\" Fandom and awards As the visibility of LGBT comic book creators and characters has increased, comic book fandom has taken notice. Panels discussing LGBT topics occur regularly at comic book and LGBT conventions such as Comicon and Gaylaxicon, and conventions also feature stands dedicated to LGBT comics. Ted Abenheim, event chair of Prism Comics said in 2008, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre in our sixth year of exhibiting at Comic-Con, presenting a larger booth and more panels and events than ever before.‚Äù A number of websites dedicated to LGBT comic book fandom and featuring content from staff writers exist, such as Prismcomics.org, Pinkkrytonite.com and Gayleague.com. GLAAD awards The first GLAAD Award for \\"outstanding comic book\\" was awarded in 1992 (to DC's The Flash). Since then, a number of GLAAD awards have been awarded to mainstream titles, including for DC's Green Lantern and The Authority titles, and Marvel's Young Avengers. According to Paul Lopez, LGBT fans and creators have \\"debated whether the awards for mainstream comics were more about media hype than the actual content of the comic's stories.\\" Gaylactic Spectrum Awards The Gaylactic Spectrum Awards are given to works of science fiction, fantasy or horror published in the United States, and their \\"other works\\" category allows nomination of comic book series or individual issues. Comic book winners include issues of DC's Green Lantern, The Authority and Gotham Central, and nominations have been given to titles from Marvel (X-Force, X-Statix), Dark Horse (Buffy Season Eight) and Image Comics (A Distant Soil).

About one kilometre () north of the town of Alcoutim, the old castle is one of the more important Islamic military structures in the Algarve: it is both an important historical visit for tourists and histographically significant to the Muslim occupation of the region. Commonly confused with the younger Castle of Alcoutim, the old castle was abandoned in the 11th century, but its exploration and excavation was elaborated by archaeologists in the 20th century. History The initial construction occurred in the 8th-9th century, although the space was occupied since the Bronze Age. The option to locate in this location, and not solely in the town of Alcoutim, has never been clearly explained. Likely, its conditions (the level of visibility) and the use of the original Roman structures (identified in the neighbouring town of Lourinh√£) played a part in the early construction of this fortress. What is certain is that the Old Castle was the centre of a vast territory, influenced by the river activities along the Guadiana, and on the other hand, by the level of mineral exploration in the region.Helena Catarino (1997-1998), p.599-602 A few lithic fragments, for example, were found in the Muslim living spaces of the structure. It was the discovery of a few graves nearby from this period, during the archaeological excavations begun in 1986, that contributed to a better understanding of the site's roots. Similar excavations at various levels on the site, allowed the determination of a range of occupation beginning with the Bronze Age and extending into the 11th century. At one point, which coincided with the new Islamic powers during the Emirate of C√≥rdoba, the fortress was constructed. Later, during the Caliphate and early taifas, the local infrastructures were altered, resulting in the expansion of some living quarters into the defensive walls.Helena Catarino (1997-1998), p.597 At the beginning of the Middle Ages, the site could have also become a refuge site, protected by the rocky cliffs that encircled the site. The defensive systems were altered over time, as is evident in the late construction of the tower protecting the main gate. Abandoned during the 9th century, for reasons still unclear, the Castle did not recuperate its military importance nor role. With the Reconquista of the Algarve (11th century), the new Christian powers privileged the village of Alcoutim, where they constructed a new castle and community, and abandoned the old castle altogether. Yet, by the late-Middle Age, there were still some need for the old fort, necessitating some \\"modern\\" reforms to the site, including new Gothic gates. Between 1986 and 1993, archaeological excavations were undertaken onsite by Helena Catarino. On 7 October 1996, the site was classified as a Im√≥vel de Interesse P√∫blico (Property of Public Interest). In the 2000s (decade), public works to requalify the site, supported by the Programa Operacional de Coopera√ß√£o Transfronteiri√ßa Portugal-Espanha (Portugal-Spain Trans-frontier Cooperation/Operational Program), and integrated into Project Guaditer. These initiatives lead to the construction of stainless-steel guard-rails and platforms to allow visitors to view the structure and landscape in 2011. Architecture The castle is located in a rural location, on the hilltop with dense vegetation, shrubs and bushes, structured in relation to the Guadiana River with good visibility. The military architectural group consists of two enclosures, both rectangular. The upper, that corresponds to the alcazaba, occupies an area of and includes various rectangular towers, although none of them are positioned on the angles.Helena Catarino (1997-1998), p.596 Two doors give access to the interior, that includes a opening to the cistern, walls of thickness, and compartments (likely used as residences) constructed of schist masonry. The second line of walls were constructed to protect the settlement that developed around the interior walls. It is also a rectangular layout, similarly reinforced by towers, and includes a gate that permits communication with the habitable area in its periphery (the area until the river). The second redoubt, which is defended by various schist towers, and protected by rectangular structures of ashlar schist, of which a few vestiges remain in the west. Sections of the wall are made of blocks of greywacke and shale mixed with soil and clay, with a thickness of . Along this wall are towers: two with an irregular plan, about and two of approximately . This rational structure, imposed a structural geometry to the terrain, which is part of the Umayyad castle typology. Archaeologist Helena Maria Gomes Catarino, drew parallels between Alcoutim and other castles of the Eastern Algarve, referring to the fortress of Almiser√°t (Alicante) in particular, constructed in the 10th century, and others with identical characteristics.Helena Catarino (1997-1998), p.609 This attribution is reinforced by the morphology of its construction: a base of irregular lose stone, with cemented stone and earth, typical of other Umayyad military installations of the time.Helena Catarino (1997-1998), p.589 There is still a lack of archaeologically-precise evidence. From the \\"landfill\\" around the cliffs, fragments of ceramics, many cooked in an irregular kiln, and a few decorative remains that attest to medieval period (likely the end of a Visigoth occupation and/or beginning of a Muslim intervention). A excavation of the living quarters reveal fragments of tile, ceramic and a few metal objects, that point to a chronology from the end of the Emirate period of the Muslim occupation. Over the wall, of one of the rectangular compartments, constructed in the centre of the castle during the Caliphate period, archaeologists retrieved a green, manganese bowl. Another layer retrieved from the excavations, although for the most part characteristic of the Caliphate period, also included ceramics from the 11th century.

Excavations in the castle have discovered that the location was occupied during the Bronze and Iron Ages, while the parade grounds, habitational structures, and two silos date to the 12th and 13th centuries. History Main entrance to the castle structure Inscription on the corner of the castle, dedicated to the castle's early founding: marking its centenary Part of the ruined inside walls of the castle One of the sentry towers Partial ruins alongside the main wall The site of the castle was occupied, successively and uninterrupted by Lusitanians, who constructed a castro to oversee their lands, before being pushed aside by the Romans, who constructed a lookout. By the 7th-8th century, the Visigoths also used the space as a sentry to safeguard their territory. By the beginning of the 10th century, a small town was founded by Arabs, who reformulated their defences, constructing various dependencies within and outside the walls.Rosa Varela Gomes (2001), p.200-201 Of these constructions, only the cistern in the castle survives their period of occupation. The castle was part of the Moorish defensive line of Silves, during the Almohad Caliphate and era of the Iberian taifas. In 1242 (or 1246), Aljezur was conquered by knights loyal to Paio Peres Correia. As legend suggests, the conquest of the castle aided by a Moorish woman, who betrayed her fellow countrymen and delivered the citadel into the hands of the knights The Lenda of Maira Aires, also suggests that the castle was taken by Paio Correia on 24 June, on the feast day of the village's patron saint. Its occupation did not result in the partial or total destruction of the castle, although alterations to the fortress occurred in the first decades of its Christian occupation. Following the 1267 Treaty of Badajoz, the castle and other fortresses along the Algarve were transferred into the dominion of the King Afonso III of Portugalby Alfonso X of Castile. King Denis of Portugal issued a foral (charter) to the region of Aljezur on 12 November 1280, while staying in Estremoz. Thirty years later, the monarch bartered away the Castle of Aljezur and other lands for the town of Almada (1 December 1297). In 1448, during a visitation by members of the Order of Santiago to the town of Aljezur, they referred to the castle being in a state of abandon, at the same time prohibiting the removal of rock and masonry from the site for other constructions. Further, the report mentioned directions by the Order to reconstruct the walls and the cleaning of the cistern. On 20 August 1504, King Manuel of Portugal reissued a foral from Lisbon, where he conferred the title of honrada (honoured) to the charter (seen as a way to attract new settlers to the region). The 1755 Lisbon earthquake caused the destruction of all the homes in the town, and demolishing most of the castle, saving only the tribune and the Presbytery in the church. As a result of the 1940-1941 commemorations of the Portuguese centenary, the walls was partially reconstructed. On 19 September 1972, a decision by the JNE considered future plans to convert the castle into a hotel should only be considered if the volume of remodelling required did not harm the interior of the monument. Yet, this decision did not inhibit other business-related plans, leading eventually to the 1 June 1992 decision to transfer the castle into the authority of the IPPAR Instituto Portugu√™s do Patrim√≥nio Arquitect√≥nico (Portuguese Institute of Architectural Patrimony), a forerunner of the IGESPAR Instituto de Gest√£o do Patrim√≥nio Arquitect√≥nico e Arqueol√≥gico (Institute for the Management of Architectural and Archaeological Heritage). In the meantime, a project to illuminate the castle grounds (in 1973 and, again, in 1981) and construction of an improved road accessway and parking area were completed in 1976-1977 by the municipal government of Aljezur (CMA). Urgent consolidation and repairs of the walls were undertaken in 1985. On 21 November 1996, the CMA of Aljezur issued a public tender to elaborate a project to reconstruct, preserve and consolidate the remains of the Castle for the purposes of utilizing the structure as a method attracting tourism to the region. Two years later (29 September 1998), the final plan was presented publicly. Architecture The castle is located in a rural environment, isolated on top of an 88-metre hilltop (the smaller of two that overlook the old town) and circuited by the winding Aljezur ravine. During the Moorish occupation of the region, the river was navigable (lasting until the 18th century). With the exception of planned core around the new Church, the village is characterized by Moorish accents; the old village, consists of low stature homes, adapted to the into the rugged terrain of the hill in an amphitheatre-shape, accompanying the contour. Owing to its location, over the town, it was characterized as a defensive structure along the river and guardian of its port. Getting to the castle from the N120 roadway is accomplished across the Vale da Telha, following in the direction of Rua das Figueiras, then Rua das Piteiras towards the Rua Serro do Mosqueiro. Access to the property is made by a pedestrian ramp on the eastern end of the castle, accessible from a main road leading from the town. The entrance directly makes access to the main enclosure, which provides an ample vista with natural lookout. The polygonal irregular plan is defined by the walls, reinforced by two towers on the north and southern ends of the structure. The height of the walls vary between three and five metres in height, while the structure is approximately 1.5 metres thick. The wall outcroppings on the western, and northwestern exposures show elements of barbicans, that extend one metre in height. There is one unique opening in the northeast, which provides access to the schist cliffs. The towers are massive, distinct in form and incomplete: the north tower is circular, with a diameter of and exterior height; the rectangular southern tower, by has the same height as its northern neighbour. In the parade ground, there are several excavations encountered along the northwest walls. This includes the rounded cistern, with vaulted ceiling and interior completed filled-in. Near the entrance, is a commemorative inscription that marks the 100-year period of the castle's restoration. There is some belief, although unproven, that the castle was the one represented on the national flag.

She was renowned for her storyteller pottery figurines, a motif she invented, based upon the traditional \\"singing mother\\" motif.  Early work  She first learned to create leatherwork, then in the 1950s started creating pottery birds and animals that her husband painted. It is said that Helen's aunt suggested clay as a medium over the more expensive leather. She also recommended figures after the early attempts by Helen at bowls and jars were misshapen.  Style and materials  Cordero \\"followed a traditional way of life including digging her own clay and preparing her own pigments\\". She used three types of clay, all sourced near Cochiti Pueblo, and clay and plant materials for paint. Over time, Helen's finish became more refined, and she made her children separately instead of from the primary piece of clay allowing for her to vary their placement around the storyteller. As Helen's work progressed, she ultimately developed the trademark face for which her dolls are now known. Cordero had a personal connection to her work, \\"They're my little people. I talk to them and they're singing.\\" This reflects the Pueblo belief that clay is living substance, and that the figurines are like living being.  Storyteller figurines  The Cochiti women potters made figurines of women with children known as \\"Singing Mother\\" or Madonna, Cordero transformed this form into her Storyteller design in 1964. According to one account, she was commissioned by the Anglo designer and collector Alexander Girard to create the first Storyteller. Yet, in a 1981 article, Cordero said she created the first Storyteller on her own in 1964. \\"I made some more of my Storytellers with lots of children climbing on him to listen, then I took them up to the Santo Domingo Feast Day\\" where Alexander Girard bought them. Alexander Girard was a patron who purchased her early work. Not long after Helen started her figurines, Gerard asked her to increase her yield and the size of her figures. This request ultimately terminated in a 250-piece Nativity set. It is suggested that Gerard also proposed Helen should fashion a larger \\"Singing Mother\\" figure. Helen mulled over the idea, and thought of her grandfather, Santiago Quintana, who she remembered as a great storyteller. Helen's grandfather would in part inspire her first Storyteller, a male figure surrounded by five grandchildren. After 1964, her family members joined her in making Storyteller figurines. She described her process: > \\"work outdoors in warm weather and at her kitchen table in the winter. Her > husband and son drove one hundred miles to bring home the cedar wood she > used to fire her pieces ... on an open iron grate behind her house.\\" Her Storyteller design became popular with other pottery-makers, who have created variations, including animal storytellers. By the 1990s, over 200 potters were making Storyteller figures for a booming market. To distinguish her work and to fulfill the expectations of some collectors, Helen began signing her works. After the success of the Storyteller, Helen eventually drew more from her experiences and went on to develop other types including, drummers, singing mothers, Pueblo father, and Hopi maiden.  Personal life  Cordero was a lifelong resident of Cochiti Pueblo. She married Fred Cordero, an artist, drum-maker, and governor of Cochiti Pueblo, and they had four children.  Collections  Cordero's work is found in the Museum of International Folk Art and the New Mexico Museum of Art in Santa Fe, New Mexico, the Smithsonian American Art Museum in Washington, DC, the Heard Museum in Phoenix, the Bandelier National Monument museum in Los Alamos Co., New Mexico and the Brooklyn Museum.

History The battlements of the Fort of Alvor, as seen from the rooftops of the civil parish, showing the partial remains of one of the towers A profile of the remnant walls of the old fort The establishment of the first fortress was constructed in the 7th century B.C.E., from the remains of Phoenician, Greek and Carthagninan remnants that were built on a Lusitanian castro settlement. The Carthaginan fort was conquered by Hannibal in 436, who renamed the fortification Portus Annibalis, which would later be re-christened Barc√≠nia. From excavations completed by Teresa Gamito, the author determined that Alvor was an ancient populational and commercial centre during the pre-Roman colonization.Teresa Gamito (1994) Roman conquest did not alter significantly Alvor's role. The Moors finally conquered Alvor in 716, but the settlement retained its important political and commercial role that it acquired during the earlier cultures. King Sancho I of Portugal destroyed the fort in 1189, when his forces swept away resistance from Moorish forces. It was a temporary success: the region was retaken in 1191 by the Moors. In 1250, King Afonso III finally settled this territorial dispute by sacking Alvor. In order to maintain their conquest, King Denis ordered the reconstruction of the castle in 1300. Successively, Alvor was elevated to the status of town by King John II on 29 February 1495, which later allowed its deannexation from the municipality of Silves (on 28 December 1498). Within ten years, on 13 December 1505, King Manuel issued a foral (charter) to the parish of Alvor. The apparent simplicity of the structure that survived to this day contrasts with the importance of the location during the Middle Ages. Current thinking suggests that the actual Castle of Alvor corresponded to the primitive square, that sheltered a garrison. Outside this redoubt circled the primitive settlement, which was itself circled by walls (which have not survived). At the time of the first conquest of Silves (in 1189), Alvor was referred to as a dependent town, suffering from Christian incursions (including deaths and considerable destruction to the settlement). Within the Christian sphere, Alvor became one of the principal localities of the Algarve. Yet, the few notices survive to this day of the military preparedness of the castle or its garrison. It was in Alvor that King John II died, his body eventually transferred to the S√© Cathedral in Silves, before being interred in the Monastery of Batalha. It was only in the 17th century that a further understanding of the structure can be determined. In 1621, during a period of intense reform carried out after the Portuguese Restoration War, Alexandre Massaii first referred to Alvor castle as a \\" small, square fort\\". The preoccupation with the defense of the Algarve suggested that this fort was abandoned in favor of concentrating forces in large, complex forts in strategic points along the coast.Left in abandon, the castle was successively threatened by the encroachment of the town, as a number of residences were constructed within and without its walls. The 1755 Lisbon earthquake was responsible for the complete destruction of the castle, resulting in its current vestiges. At the end of the 20th century, a children's playground was constructed in the interior of the main square, an act that was seen as a commemoration of the Christian conquest of the town. The attempt to identify the hidden defensive systems of Alvor continue. An archaeological excavation of the hill discovered the remnants of the fortress of Ipses (or old city), located in front of the matriz church, revealing levels of Moorish occupation.Teresa J√∫dice Gamito (1994), p.213‚Äì218 These excavations revealed that the castle of Alvor was actually complemented by other secondary redoubts, located closer to the coast. Architecture As an ancient river community, the region was conditioned by a privileged position: it had access to the sea and interior territory, across many of the ravines and rivers that cross the region and protected by a dominant mountain. Alvor was, since this early period, a reference for many of the smaller populations that developed along the eastern maritime coast east of the River Arade. The structure was installed on a hilltop: a rectangular plan, the castle's walls continue to exist after many years of wear and ruin, comprising many blocks of irregular forms. A perceptible path still circles this structure, identifiable by a staircase located along the southern wall, but the vertical extent of this wall is clouded by limited vestiges. The main gate, aligned to the north, was constructed during the Renaissance, defended by a tower.Rosa Varela Gomes (2002), p. 133 On the eastern wall is the remnant of another tower, with a panoramic view of the sea.Valdemar Coutinho (1997), p. 82 References ;Notes ;Sources   Alvor Castle Alvor Category:Castles in the Algarve Alvor ","title":"Castle of Alvor"},{"id":"24540916","text":"John Kadlecik (born June 28, 1969 in Council Bluffs, Iowa) is an American guitarist.

From 2009 to 2014 he performed with original Dead members Bob Weir and Phil Lesh in Furthur. Early life John Kadlecik's mother is a visual artist and his father a city manager. Because of this, his family moved every few years in his early life. He lived in Omaha, Cincinnati and Davenport where he began studying classical violin before his family relocated to the Chicago area. In high school he became interested in improvisation and he began teaching himself guitar. John Kadlecik with the John K Band at Mexicali Live in Teaneck, NJ on April 13, 2013 Musical career Kadlecik played in several garage bands throughout high school before he became interested in jazz and folk music. In 1990 he began performing regularly with a Chicago area folk-rock band called Uncle Buffalo's Urban Mountain Review before joining Hairball Willie in 1991. With John on guitar, violin, and vocals, Hairball Willie performed around the Midwest and released several recordings, including a full length studio CD, Just Defying Gravity. He then had a brief stint with a Grateful Dead tribute band called Uncle John's Band in 1996 before forming his own group called Wingnut. In 1997, he co-founded the Dark Star Orchestra, which was originally intended to be a one night a week Dead cover band formed by deadhead musicians. Before long all the group members quit their other projects and began concentrating on the group full-time. Since then John has been noted for his abilities to emulate Jerry Garcia's playing and singing abilities. On several occasions former members of the Grateful Dead have joined Kadlecik and the Dark Star Orchestra on stage. In 2003, Kadlecik began performing occasionally with Melvin Seals in several tributes to the music of the Jerry Garcia Band. This led ultimately to the formation of the Mix with Melvin Seals, Greg Anton, Jeff Pevar, and Kevin Rosen. The Mix signed a recording contract with Rainman Records and released a full-length CD, American Spring, which featured two of Greg Anton's songwriting collaborations with Robert Hunter sung by Kadlecik as well as two of John's Hairball Willie songs co- written with lyricist Eric Olson. In August 2009, Kadlecik joined Grateful Dead members Bob Weir and Phil Lesh in their band Furthur. On November 16, 2009 John announced that he was officially leaving Dark Star Orchestra to concentrate his time on Furthur. His final performance with Dark Star Orchestra was on December 5, 2009 in Buffalo, New York. In addition to his work with Dark Star Orchestra and Furthur, Kadlecik has continued to perform on his own in the Washington D.C. area, both solo acoustic and as the leader of small bands, including projects like Firewheel. On April 11, 2010, John debuted the John K Band in Washington, D.C., performing his original songs, written with lyricists Eric Olson and Indi Riverflow, as well as songs by the Grateful Dead, the Jerry Garcia Band, Phish, and others. After the final Dead performances, where Trey Anastasio was chosen to play lead guitar in favor of Kadlecik (Fare Thee Well), he was invited back to play a few shows with Phil Lesh & Friends at Terrapin Crossroads in San Rafael, CA.

By 2012 four of five accused conspirators behind the attack admitted their guilt in plea bargains. A fifth committed suicide in federal detention while awaiting trial. Arson and investigation At some point in the early morning hours of May 21, 2001, a device, which consisted of a digital alarm clock wired to a 9-volt battery and a model-rocket igniter was placed in a filing cabinet in the offices of professor Toby Bradshaw. Tubs of gasoline were then placed near the cabinet, and the timer on the firebomb was set. Around 3:00 AM, a university security officer reported seeing \\"billowing smoke and flames\\" rising from the horticultural center's roof and the fire department was summoned. It took firefighters two hours to put out the conflagration, after which it was found that the office in which the blaze started was burnt down to the studs and significant damage had been done to the central hall of the building as well as several botany labs. The Earth Liberation Front claimed responsibility for the fire ten days after it transpired. Activists Lacey Phillabaum, Jennifer Kolar, Bill Rodgers, Briana Waters and Justin Solondz eventually admitted their guilt in setting the fire. Prosecutors alleged they were part of ELF cell known as \\"the Family.\\" The motivation for the arson was rooted in suspicions by the ELF that Professor Bradshaw, a plant geneticist, was engaging in experiments funded by the industry to produce genetically- engineered trees. In their statement, the ELF claimed that \\"Bradshaw... continues to unleash mutant genes into the environment that is certain to cause irreversible harm to forest ecosystems... As long as universities continue to pursue this reckless 'science,' they run the risk of suffering severe losses. Our message remains clear, we are determined to stop genetic engineering.\\" Bradshaw states that while he had considered doing genetic research, at the time he was doing experiments on transgenic tissue samples from poplar trees, a fast-growth species which he hopes could conceivably be used to reduce the need to log natural forests if raised privately on plantations to produce pulp. Bradshaw was quoted in the University of Washington alumni magazine as saying, \\"I have never genetically engineered a tree, much less released one into the environment,\\" and further explained that of the eighty samples of poplar he had been working with since 1995, none had ever left the laboratory. The office of professor Bradshaw contained little in the way of actual research material relating to the poplar trees, and the bulk of what was destroyed in the office fire turned out to be Bradshaw's personal possessions and books. The fire did, however, destroy research materials relating to plant regeneration on Mount St. Helens after the volcanic eruption, materials relating to the restoration of wetlands and prairies, and a cache of stickseed plants which were intended to be transplanted to the Cascade Mountains to replenish dwindling wild stocks. With little of his research damaged, Bradshaw affirmed that he would continue his research in the face of the attack. He wrote in a letter to the Los Angeles Times that, \\"ELF firebombings are hate crimes against those of us whose missions in life are to increase human knowledge and bring a sense of wonder to the classes we teach.\\" A new horticultural center was later rebuilt in 2004, costing approximately $7.2 million. Operation Backfire The investigation into the incident was eventually merged into an FBI-led affair known as Operation Backfire which also covered six other investigations into radical environmentalist activity. Perpetrators and alleged perpetrators=Lacey Phillabaum and Jennifer Kolar Lacey Phillabaum, a former editor of Earth First! Journal, and the narrator of a documentary film Breaking the Spell, pleaded guilty on October 4, 2006, along with Jennifer Kolar, to her role in the arson. Both women made an agreement to assist prosecutors in exchange for reduced sentences. Phillabaum admitted to being on scene during the arson, whereas Kolar confessed only to using a knife to cut through the window to Bradshaw's office. Both women have since been the target of derision by other activists. Bill Rodgers Bill Rodgers, considered by the FBI to have been a significant organizer within ELF, was alleged to have helped set the fire bombs inside the horticulture center. He was taken into custody on December 7, 2005 and was subsequently charged with one count of arson, relating to a 1998 fire. He later committed suicide in his jail cell in Flagstaff, Arizona by asphyxiating himself with a plastic bag. Briana Waters Briana Waters, a violin teacher and the director of the environmental documentary Watch, was convicted of involvement in the crime in 2008 and admitted her involvement in a 2011 plea deal. The original conviction was vacated by the Ninth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals on September 15, 2010. The appeals court found that prosecutors in the original trial were improperly allowed to introduce a folder of anarchist literature that Waters was said to have given to another participant in the bombing. Judge A. Wallace Tashima stated that the articles' \\"repugnant and self-absorbed embrace of destruction is likely to have swayed jurors' emotions.\\" In June 2011, while awaiting a retrial, Water's entered a plea agreement with federal prosecutors. She admitted to charges of conspiracy and arson in the firebombing incident and to involvement in a separate 2001 arson at the Litchfield Wild Burro and Horse Corrals in Susanville, California. She also agreed to provide testimony against other alleged conspirators if called upon by the government. In exchange, prosecutors said they would recommend that she not serve any more time in prison, given she provides full and complete cooperation with ongoing investigations. Any additional time in prison will ultimately be determined by a federal judge.Former Olympia woman pleads guilty, The Olympian, June 14, 2011 At her original trial she was charged with two counts of arson, one count of conspiracy and two charges relating to the use of a destructive device in a crime of violence. She pleaded innocent to all the chargers, Waters was found guilty of the two arson counts by a Tacoma jury on March 6, 2008 and was sentenced at that time to six years in a federal prison and to pay $6 million in restitution by U.S. District Court Judge Franklin D. Burgess. In her 2011 plea deal, Water's admitted to \\"arson, conspiracy to use a destructive device, possessing an unregistered destructive device and the use of an explosive device in a crime of violence.\\" She also admitted to perjury when she declared her innocence while under oath at her 2008 trial. Waters agreed to testify against Justin Solondz, who is expected to be returned home for trial by China in the late summer. The State of California agreed not to press charges in the Litchfield arson contingent on her full cooperation with federal prosecutors. During Waters' trial, her defense attorneys Robert Bloom and Neil Fox contested the testimony of Kolar and Phillabaum and sought to have U.S. assistant Attorney Andrew Friedman removed from the case for misconduct in creating a misleading summary. They failed in that attempt. Justin Solondz Justin Franchi Solondz, who previously dated Briana Waters while attending Evergreen State College at the time of the arson, evaded charges for several years. He was indicted for arson and conspiracy in absentia in 2006, and was eventually arrested in Dali, China in March 2009 on charges of growing marijuana. He pleaded guilty to manufacturing drugs in a daylong trial and was sentenced to three years in prison by a local court. He was deported back to the U.S. to face charges there after his sentence was completed. He pleaded guilty to planning the UW arson and was sentenced to seven years in prison. Solondz admitted to involvement in the construction of the incendiary devices used in the bombing and said that he was also involved in arsons in Oregon and California, totaling $6 million in damages.Firebomb maker gets 7 years for 2001 UW arson Seattle Times, March 16, 2012 ReferencesExternal links * FBI wanted poster for Justin Solondz Category:2001 in Seattle Category:Attacks on universities and colleges in the United States Category:Earth Liberation Front Category:Eco-terrorism Category:University of Washington Category:May 2001 events in the United States Category:Terrorist incidents in the United States in 2001 ","title":"University of Washington firebombing incident"},{"id":"24541211","text":"Green Echo is an instrumental band from Lisbon, Portugal, crossing over various genres such as dub, world music, progressive music, experimental music. Biography Green echo was founded by Nno Mar (Guitar & effects), J (drums) and Pedr√º (Bass) in 2003. The three long-time friends, sharing mutual taste for music, decided to start jamming together, playing at home long instrumental and experimental jams, always based on improvisation, using various effects pedals, namely long-lasting delays, deep reverbs and loops, influenced on a variety of bands from all types of genres, such as Mr. Bungle, Sonic Youth, Can, Kraftwerk, Soft Machine, Tool, The Mars Volta, De Facto, Radiohead, Amon Tobin, Zenzile, Kaly Live Dub, Hightone, Pink Floyd, Bob Marley, King Tubby, and on also on Portuguese bands such as Three and a Quarter, Zen, Blasted Mechanism, Primitive Reason, Loosers, Wray Gunn. Wanting to develop their ideas, they started with regular rehearsals, from which resulted their first tracks being recorded and made available on MySpace, under several names, until settling with the name Green Echo (made up by Nno Mar and J, defining the style of music played and based on a Line 6 delay pedal) Wanting to expand their sound, Adri (Clarinet, Transverse Flute, Melodica and effects) and Zdigas (Guitar, Synth & effects) became full-time members, making Green Echo's sound much more dense. It was then that Green Echo started grabbing some attention on the internet, eventually having its first airplay on a Portuguese radio program called \\"Admir√°vel Mundo Novo\\". Their first release was a contribution with two tracks (‚Äúdunk‚Äù and ‚Äúduz‚Äù) for the compilation ‚Äò‚Äô‚ÄúThirty Something New Tales‚Äù‚Äô‚Äô from Music@PL.PT in 2006. At this time, Pedr√º had left the band, and was temporarily replaced by Zeca. In the following months, the band went on a short hiatus, returning to their regular jams with a new formation. Zeca left the band, while the brothers Leo (Guitar) and Rod (Keyboards, Percussion and Bass) joined in, and some months after, bass duties were undertaken by Katharsis‚Äô vocalist Sarmento (Bass, Tenor Sax and Didgeridoo). With the entry of the three latter members, the music of Green Echo distanced itself from the yearly experimentalist and raw sound, influencing more on world music and jazzy structures. It was with this formation that Green Echo finally gave their first concert, on the Festival de Oeiras in early 2009. Shortly after Sara (VJ) joined the band, providing Green Echo with a new visual impact for their music through strong emotive videos. It was only by the end of July that Green Echo gave their first full concert alone, at Crew Hassan in Lisbon. They then entered into the New Talents Contest (\\"Concurso Novos Talentos\\"), with a series of gigs in Lisbon and Montemor, eventually winning the contest. As a result, the band was invited to play at the Festa do Avante in September 2009, headlining the last day of the festival's side stage, giving one of their most memorable concerts up to date! In October 2009, Green Echo started recording their first album. Musical style As can be read from their site, \\"Green echo release their ideas and emotions communicating and expressing themselves through art, creating an explosion of feelings in the audience. Green echo jam and improvise trying to make their sound the echo of the present moment. Their music is a fusion of electronic and acoustic sound that reaches a spacey and natural sound at the same time. Each musical moment is unique and is created through fusion of perceptions that each element has from the world. This creates the energy for rebellion, for reflection... We seek the sound of change.\\" Improvisation The general idea behind Green Echo's music is solely based on improvisation and soundscapes. These improvisations can be attached to a single riff, idea or on the other hand be loosely developed around no particular thing where the band simply started playing and took the music wherever it went. Green echo maintains the spirit of improvisation as its result is more closely linked to the moment of the experience itself giving space for a much more interesting creation, based upon what is happening in that moment. As such, green echo's concerts are in each self unique, as even when previously prepared, such preparation relies only on the message or journey to be explored, no more. Effects Green Echo's sound relies also on the heavy use of effects pedals. This use, namely by creating soundscapes, shows a different approach to the instruments played, being a guitar, for example, not a final instrument, but a mere vehicle to what can be done with effects pedals. Every member of the band uses some kind of effects, especially imposing echos and delays. This can be particularly heard in the self-oscillating delays, and the effects used in the woodwinds played by Adri. Influences All members of Green Echo have a different, even if linked, musical background. However, it is clearly identifiable the influence of Dub, World Music, Progressive rock, Experimental rock, Jazz fusion, and from bands such as Mr. Bungle, Sonic Youth, Can, Kraftwerk, Soft Machine, Tool, The Mars Volta, De Facto, Radiohead, Amon Tobin, Zenzile, Kaly Live Dub, Hightone, Pink Floyd, Bob Marley, King Tubby, and on also on Portuguese bands such as Three and a Quarter, Zen, Blasted Mechanism, Primitive Reason, Loosers, Wray Gunn.

He is particularly known for his contributions to the children's book genre, including the Newbery Medal and Caldecott Medal.Kniffel, Leonard; Sullivan, Peggy; McCormick, Ethel (1999). \\"100 of the most important leaders we had in the 20th century\\". American Libraries. 30 (11) p. 38. Melcher was named as one of the most important 100 leaders in the library science field in the 20th century in an American Libraries article and has been described as \\"the greatest all-round bookman in the English-speaking world\\". Melcher was born in 1879 in Malden, Massachusetts, a suburb on the north side of Boston.Melcher, Frederic (1945). \\"On Becoming Acquainted with Books\\". Smith, pp. 3‚Äì10. In 1883, the family moved to Newton Center, another Boston suburb. A 1945 essay describes his childhood growing up near a lake, fishing, ice skating and swimming. He was also an avid reader from a young age, making many visits to the library, as well as enjoying books passed on or given by friends and family. Bookstores and bookmen When Frederic was 16, his grandfather helped him to secure a job at Estes and Lauriat publishing company and bookstore in Boston. Melcher began his career in the book industry there, a career which would span 68 years. He began working in the mailroom and over the next 18 years worked his way into sales and acquisitions.Goodspeed, Charles (1945). \\"On Embarking on a Career\\". Smith, pp. 11-16. It was during his time at Estes and Lauriat that he first developed his interest in children's books.Miller, Marilyn Lea (2003). Pioneers and Leaders in Library Services to Youth: a Biographical Dictionary. Libraries Unlimited. He worked to develop the children's collection of the books store with help of Caroline Hewins, a New England librarian who also had interests in developing and promoting children's books. He later established The Caroline M. Hewins Lectureship on New England children's books in 1947. In 1910, he married Marguerite Fellows, an author of children's books. In 1912, Melcher became president of the Boston Booksellers League. He was very active in the Boston book trade and was described as \\"an energetic and agreeable bookseller who knew books thoroughly.\\" His reputation as an enthusiastic and knowledgeable salesman resulted in his recommendation for a position running the W.K. Stewart Bookstore in Indianapolis, Indiana in 1913.Chambers, D. Laurance (1945). \\"On the Bookseller's Earthly Mortality\\". Smith, pp. 17-23. During his five years in Indiana, Melcher managed the W.K. Stewart Bookstore, which survived a flood but not a later fire which resulted in a total loss of the store and a new location. He was also active in the Indiana public Libraries Association and promoted material relating regional history. He remained with R.R. Bowker for 45 years, becoming president in 1934. While at Publishers Weekly, Melcher began creating space in the publication and a number of issues dedicated solely to books for children.Hansen, Harry (1945). \\"On the Best Definition of an Editor's Usefulness\\". Smith, pp. 24-28. In 1919, he teamed with Franklin K. Mathiews, librarian for the Boy Scouts of America, and Anne Carroll Moore, a librarian at the New York Public Library, to create Children's Book Week. Melcher proposed the Newbery Medal in 1922, an annual award for \\"the most distinguished book for children\\". Melcher suggested that the award be named after John Newbery, a British bookseller known for his contributions to the children's book industry. Melcher recruited Rene Paul Chambellan to design the award. Although the award had hearty support, Melcher also drew extensively upon his own funds for the creation of the medal.Marcus, Leonard (1997). \\"Frederic G. Melcher (1879-1963)\\". Publishers Weekly (244) 31 p. 66. Melcher proposed the Caldecott Medal in 1937 to honor children's picture books. Named for British illustrator Randolph Caldecott, the medal is presented annually for the \\"most distinguished picture book for children\\". In 1945, Melcher had worked in the book industry for 50 years. A celebration was held in his honor at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel in New York City.Smith, p. 61. He was awarded Honorary Membership in the American Library Association. American Library Association, Honorary Membership. http://www.ala.org/awardsgrants/awards/176/all_yearsA collection of essays about his life was published to commemorate this event and he was awarded a medal from The American Institute of Graphic Arts: > In recognition of his many-sided contributions to the Graphic Arts through > 50 years, his patient and judicial sponsorship of worthy causes, > international as well as national; his continuing kindly encouragement of > young men and women first entering the world of books; and his tireless, > accomplished, and successful efforts to make known and to maintain high > standards of bookmaking. Melcher resigned as president of R.R. Bowker in 1958 to become chairman of the board. In 1962 he received the Regina Medal from the Catholic Library Association \\"in recognition of a lifetime contribution to children's literature\\". Religious ties Melcher was an active member in the Unitarian Universalist church.Melcher, Daniel (1967). \\"Fred Melcher as I knew him\\". ALA Bulletin (61) pp. 56-62. His contributions to the church and to the publishing industry, as well as his work in fighting against censorship led to the church establishing the Frederic G. Melcher Book Award in 1964. The award is given annually to the work \\"judged to have made the most significant contribution to religious liberalism\\". Other interests Although Frederic G. Melcher is best known for his contributions to the world of children's books, he was also known as being foremost among his contemporaries for his comprehensive understanding of the entire book industry, including bookselling, publishing and libraries. He was also active in supporting and developing the international book trade, fighting against censorship and working toward international copyright laws. Friendship with Frost Melcher is also known for his friendship with American poet Robert Frost. The University of Virginia Library is home to the Frederic G. Melcher‚ÄìRobert Frost Collection, which covers various photos and writings from the two men from 1865-1963. In 2006, a University of Virginia graduate student who was completing a thesis on the poetry of Frost discovered a previously unpublished poem, inscribed by Frost on the inside cover of a book Frost had given to Melcher in 1918.Stilling, Robert (2006). \\"Between Friends: Rediscovering the War Thoughts of Robert Frost\\". The Virginia Quarterly Review (Fall) pp. 113-19. Death Melcher died on March 9, 1963 at the age of 83, and his ashes were scattered at the family vacation home in Cape Cod. After his death, much of his work and sponsorship of several awards was carried on by his son Daniel. See alsoReferences ;Citations * Smith, Mildred, editor (1945). Frederic G.

The exhibition was on view at CAMH from May 9-October 4, 2009. No Zoning: Artists Engage Houston was co-curated by Toby Kamps and Meredith Goldsmith and featured projects by twenty-one Houston artists using the city as inspiration, material, and site. This chronology documents Houston's alternative art scene.  Before 1970  ;1930 ;Houston Artists‚Äô Gallery Grace Spaulding John and a group of women opened the city's first artist-run gallery, the Houston Artists‚Äô Gallery, in the basement of the Beaconsfield Hotel on Main Street. The organization sponsored exhibitions, auctions, and lectures. ;1949 ;Contemporary Arts AssociationThe building housing the Contemporary Arts Association (CAA) was from its inception often referred to as the Contemporary Arts Museum (CAM) and the latter name was used almost exclusively from the 1970s to 1990s. In 2002 the institution‚Äôs name was officially changed to the Contemporary Arts Museum Houston (CAMH). Houston artists and architects seeking a venue for displaying contemporary art and design founded the volunteer-operated Contemporary Arts Association, initially presenting exhibitions at the Museum of Fine Arts and in 1949 erecting an A-frame museum building on Dallas Street in downtown Houston. The organization gradually gained professional status and curator Jermayne MacAgy was hired as its first full-time director in 1955.http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/fmaea ;1956 ;The Orange Show; Postman Jeff McKissack began to single-handedly design and build The Orange Show, a brightly colored, carnival-like environment dedicated to the orange and to the virtues of good health and right living. He used concrete, stucco, and found objects‚Äîmosaic tiles, wrought iron fencing, wagon wheels, mannequins, and tractor seats‚Äîto transform two plots on Munger Street in the East End into a vividly painted architectural maze of walkways, balconies, exhibits, and performance stages. When The Orange Show finally opened to the public in 1979, the hordes of visitors McKissack anticipated did not come. He died shortly thereafter. The facility is now preserved by the Orange Show Center for Visionary Art and is the site for events and performances.http://www.roadsideamerica.com/story/3341 ;1963 ;Jim Love and Roy Fridge Studio Artists Jim Love and Roy Fridge shared a studio in a two-story derelict storefront on Truxillo Street near West Alabama. It became a meeting place and notorious party site for artists such as Donald Barthelme, Jack Boynton, David McManaway, and Charles T. Williams, along with numerous Houston art patrons and international visitors such as Jean Tinguely and Niki de Saint Phalle. ;1968 ;The Beer Can House John Milkovisch, a retired railroad upholsterer, began to transform an ordinary bungalow in Houston's West End into a kinetic, shimmering environment. Working for twenty years, he covered the entire yard and drive with intricate patterns of concrete studded with marbles, salvaged industrial washers, and stones; decorated the house and trees with garlands made from beer can tops, rims, and pull tabs; and clad the house with thousands of flattened beer cans, ensuring that he would never have to paint the house again. ‚ÄúThey say every man should leave something to be remembered by,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúAt least I accomplished that goal.‚Äù The site is now a revered local monument maintained by the Orange Show Center for Visionary Art. ;1969 ;Lee Benner Lee Benner, opened his first studio on Wheeler St. Made sculpture for Coca-Cola, Bush Gardens, and Jockey's. ;Daucus Carota Herschel Berry, Michael Hollis, and Kelly Kirkonnel started Daucus Carota (Latin for ‚Äúwild carrot‚Äù) while they were in high school. The group had a shifting membership that included Andy Feehan, Nicky Galmiche, Chris Lesikar, Jim Martin, and Julian Schnabel. Members of Daucus Carota used images and sculptures of carrots in their work, often leaving bunches of real carrots in their wake. They sculpted an oversized painted carrot, which they placed around town, including in front of the Museum of Fine Arts, in a gesture designed to belittle the art establishment. ;Ant Farm In 1968 in San Francisco, Chip Lord and Doug Michels founded the architecture and art collective Ant Farm, which later included Douglas Hurr, Hudson Marquez, and Curtis Schreier. In 1969 while Lord and Michels were teaching at the University of Houston College of Architecture, Ant Farm staged a series of free-form architectural performances in the Houston area. Subsequently, they worked throughout the United States, but realized some of their important projects in Houston, including Time Capsule 1972‚Äì1984 (1972); a monumental sculpture on Kirby Drive for the Hard Rock Caf√© with an actual 1962 Thunderbird hardtop convertible towering aloft, STP (Save the Planets) (1985); and their award-winning project The House of the Century (1971‚Äì73), a futurist spaceship-like dwelling for Marilyn Oshman Lubetkin located near Angleton, Texas, south of Houston.  1970s  ;1972 ;Goodyear Blimp over CAM During the opening of Exhibition 10, curated by Sebastian J. Adler at the Contemporary Arts Museum, artist and experimental filmmaker Michael Snow created an elaborate piece on the advertising light grid of the Goodyear Blimp, which flew over the museum. ;Hyde Park Miniature Museum D. D. Smalley, grandfather of artist and musician Frank Davis, was inspired by his grandson's birth in 1941 and began production of what was eventually called the Hyde Park Miniature Museum. On display in the oversized attic of a house on Hyde Park Street was a range of artifacts, including 250,000 postage stamps wrapped in bundles of 100, dinosaur excrement and bones, Indian skulls, tools, handmade models, over 1,000 clocks, the U.S. Constitution in Braille, wax recordings, a three-toed horse hoof, short wave radio paraphernalia, bee tracking glasses, dressed fleas, and many other curiosities and miscellany, all carefully arranged and catalogued. ;B. E. & J. Holding Firm Bob Camblin, Earl Staley, and Joe Tate, all university studio art teachers, used the chance operation of the I Ching to name their collaboration the ‚ÄúB. E. & J. Holding Firm.‚Äù In the backyard of their shared studio on Garrott Street, they built a large sculptural tower with a payphone on the third floor. It became a meeting place for many artists in the community, including Al Smith, David Folkman, Jack Boynton, and Mark Battista, a former architecture student from Rice University. Their collaboration resulted in three exhibitions at the University of St. Thomas. ;1973 ;Re:Vision In fall 1973 Ian Glennie, interim director of the Contemporary Arts Museum, organized an exhibition called Re:Vision, which included performances, concerts, films, and artworks. One of the projects was a site-based sound portrait of Houston by Robert Whitman, a New York artist known for his theater and technology works. Whitman assembled volunteers and assigned each participant a specific location on a map of Houston and a time to call in. When they reached Whitman, they talked about where they were and what they saw. Using a sound mixing board, Whitman then arranged recordings of the calls into a concertlike sound piece that was broadcast live on Pacifica radio. ;1974 ;West EndThe area informally known as the West End is bounded by Washington Avenue on the north, Memorial on the south, and Durham and Westcott to the east and west, incorporating more formal subdivisions such as Rice Military and Magnolia Grove. Metal Houses On Roy Street, a few blocks away from the Beer Can House and mirroring the vernacular metal warehouses scattered throughout the neighborhood, architects Eugene Aubry, Ian Glennie, and Hossein Oskouie designed the first residence using an industrial metal exterior. This residential type has since proliferated in the area (sometimes referred to as ‚ÄúTin Town‚Äù) and throughout the city. Glennie and Fredericka Hunter of Texas Gallery were the original inhabitants of the loftlike space, and they presented the first Houston performances of composer Philip Glass and performance artist Joan Jonas in their home. ;1975 ;The Menil Collection Campus Facilitated by the lack of zoning in Houston, John and Dominique de M√©nil discreetly began acquiring thirty acres of property adjacent to the University of St. Thomas, at first intended for potential university expansion. They later decided to build their museum there and to maintain the residential properties against the incursion of unwanted architecture and businesses. In 1974, under the direction of architect Howard Barnstone, the many bungalows comprising the neighborhood were all painted gray with white trim, inspired in part by Dominique de Menil's Rice Museum exhibition of grisaille painting Gray is the Color. This gray theme informed the look of the Renzo Piano‚Äìdesigned Menil Collection, which opened in June 1987 on part of the site where some houses had been demolished or moved. The remaining bungalows today are art administrative offices, arts spaces, and homes‚Äîa unique and homogeneous neighborhood-within-a-neighborhood. ;1976 ;See Saw As part of the Main Street Festival, artist Mel Chin created an earthwork called See Saw in Hermann Park with funds he raised from GeoSource, an oil company. Chin and GeoSource worked closely to build the work, which consisted of two ‚Äúplanter boxes‚Äù set apart and linked by a hydraulic system, so that they ascended and descended in opposition to each other when visitors stood on them. ;1977 ;Mayhem at CAM The Kilgore College Rangerettes, a renowned women's synchronized drill team dressed as miniskirted cowgirls, performed during the opening night of an exhibition at CAM organized by James Harithas featuring the work of Antoni Miralda, a sculptor whose medium is food and its attendant ceremonies. In a nod to the local Rainbow Bread Company, the artwork on view was an installation of bread dyed all the colors of the spectrum. Perhaps stirred by the high-kicking Rangerettes, the opening night crowd erupted in mayhem and tore the bread apart in a food fight that spilled into the streets. ;SWAMP A community-wide offshoot of the Rice University Media Center, the Southwest Alternate Media Project (SWAMP) was founded as a Texas-based nonprofit organization to promote the creation and appreciation of film, video, and new media, as well as, originally, to provide low-cost access to media production facilities. ;1978 ;Christ Church Gallery Artist Terrell James opened and operated a gallery for several years on the premises of the downtown Christ Church Cathedral, an Episcopal church founded in 1839. ;Women's Caucus for Art The Houston Women's Caucus for Art was founded as a regional chapter of the national Women's Caucus for Art, to actively support equal opportunity and visibility for work by women. Participants included MaryRoss Taylor, Gertrude Barnstone, Lynn Randolph, Toby Topek, Suzanne Bloom, and Roberta Graham Harris. ;Ring II: The Embrace . . . Advanced to Fury Terry Allen presented his music-theater piece The Ring in a full-scale wrestling ring erected in Spinoza, Inc., the industrial warehouse of Max Miller's railroad track company near Channelview. In the ring, a couple verbally recounted their relationship as a male and a female wrestler violently acted out their roles while random audience members stood and recited parts of the narrative. This was one of the first public performances of actress/performance artist Jo Harvey Allen. ;1979 ;Urban Animals The Urban Animals, a loose-knit group of street skaters, was formed by Edie Scott and Scott Prescott. Their activities included roller hockey, parking garage surfing, midnight crosstown skating, bar hopping, roller jousting, and graffiti art. At their zenith in the late 1980s, they numbered several hundred and included skating filmmakers, artists, mechanics, lawyers, electricians, topless dancers, bartenders, and even a Harris County deputy. The Animals became notorious among the press, city government, and local police, but the group's creative output was large and its charitable efforts at local shelters and community centers were generous. ;The Red House Placing a classified ad in the Houston Chronicle, artist Mel Ziegler offered to paint any house for free as long as the owner accepted his conditions that the entire edifice, inside and out, be painted boldly in red and left that way for three months. The house remained a compelling architectural quirk on Bomar Street in the Neartown area for fifteen years because the owners kept repainting the house as Ziegler had originally instructed. The structure still exists but is no longer painted red. ;Square One Mark Lombardi moved to Houston in 1975 to become an assistant curator under Director James Harithas at the Contemporary Arts Museum. In 1979 in an attempt to support himself and other local artists such as James Bettison, Ibsen Espada, Andy Feehan, and Andy Mann, he opened the gallery Square One on Bissonnet Street. Later in 1994, Lombardi began an art practice of tracking various political, energy, and military-industrial complex conspiracies on thousands of index cards, then mapping the connections on elaborate flow chart-like drawings. ;120 Portland Michael Peranteau and artist Max Pruneda began monthly exhibitions of area artists at 120 Portland, a restaurant where Pruneda was chef. The openings were held on Sundays, when the restaurant was closed. ;Lawndale Art and Performance Center Lawndale Art and Performance Center (now Lawndale Art Center) began in a warehouse located on Hillman Street near Lawndale in the East End of Houston after a fire displaced the painting and sculpture department of the University of Houston. Under the direction of artist and sculpture professor James Surls with programming implemented independently from the university, the cavernous former cable factory grew into a freewheeling laboratory environment that served as classroom, studio, and exhibition and performance space for students and artists in the community. One of the earliest exhibitions was Pow Wow: Contemporary Artists & Models Ball, curated by Bert L. Long Jr., Miniatures Exhibition, an exhibition of work by over five hundred artists. Students at the original Lawndale Art Annex on Dismuke and Lawndale included: Sharon Kopriva, Ed Wilson, Jack Massing and Michael Galbreth (The Art Guys), Paul Kittleson, Kelly Alison, Bert Samples, Craig Lesser, Donald Redman, Mary Jenewein, Barbara Jones, Robert Shuttelsworth, Glen Gipps, Chuck Dugan, Wes Hicks, Judy Long, Jim Poag and Jeff Delude. In 1993, Lawndale moved to its current location on Main Street in the Museum District. ;Smithsonian Archives of American Art As part of a national initiative the Smithsonian Institution's Archives of American Art began a pilot project, the first privately funded archive documenting predominantly Texas artists. Later records from New Mexican artists were added. Originally scheduled to function for two years, it continued through 1985 because of the scale of the work. This southwestern archive was run from Houston by Sandra Curtis Levy, assisted by Terrell James. Liz Ward and Maggie Olvey also helped. A duplicate of this archive, which is part of the National Archives of American Art, is kept on microfilm at the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston.  1980s  ;1980 ;Studio One William Steen founded Studio One in a storefront studio space he shared with Mel Chin on Congress Street in a derelict area east of downtown Houston. For several years, it was one of the most influential art spaces in the city. Art exhibitions, readings, lectures, films, and performances were staged there, including works by experimental punk band Culturcide, improvisational musician Richard Landry, avant-garde filmmaker Kurt Kren, The Art Guys, and actor/artist Dennis Hopper. Steen also became a liaison to various outsider and prison artists such as Henry Ray ‚ÄúPretty Boy‚Äù Clark. ;3221 Milam Dancer and choreographer Farrell Dyde founded the alternative space 3221 Milam, which presented art exhibitions, performances, dance, and music. ;Rock Extension Artist Kate Ericson's Rock Extension was a row of rocks that extended from the front porch and down the walkway of a house in the Neartown area. Ericson went on to create several other important works in Houston in collaboration with her husband, Mel Ziegler. ;The Fan Man Bob Harper, the Fan Man, began to build an environment in the Third Ward that he called the ‚ÄúThird World.‚Äù Assembling found materials like abandoned TVs, water skis, mannequins, bottles, and numerous electric fan blades, he said, ‚ÄúI build for the Lord. Everybody can look at what I build and know that there is a God up above because I get my ideas from the blue sky.‚Äù The project grew until it covered the house and yard. In 1992 the house burned down when a gas heater exploded; Harper's mother died from injuries sustained in the fire. The Fan Man then moved to a property owned by his brother and began to rebuild his environment, working on it until his death in 1995. ;1981 ;DoV-Z ROBOTTs After making a series of 16 sculptural radio-controlled robots (parabots), artist H. J. Bott staged eight biweekly robot performances in his studio in the Heights, which were highly attended (SRO) by local Houston artists, gallerists, collectors, curators and art writers. ROBOTT Opera: A Time- Warp Newscast, 1983, followed at the University of St Thomas, Houston, featuring 12 of the parabots in dialogue with three screens of art and news, a shaman (Shanabu), newscaster mimes (Walter Cranktight and Bonnie Warbler) and the omnipotent computer force of the Universe (Mother PCOF‚ÄîPower, Control, Order) of the 23rd c A.C.W, (After the Corporate Wars) voice by Margaret (a.k.a. Dee Dee) Bott. ROBOTT voices were by gallerists, curators and a collector. Two of the DoV-Z ROBOTTs, Nadair (an Inter-galactic political consultant/historian) and ROWE ( a radiation analyst/bot-philosopher), were then included in a two-year 11 museum traveling exhibition, The History of Robotics initiated by the American Craft Museum, NYC. Each ROBOTT represents a different discipline, appearing thru a time- warp, warning of our environmental destructive and inhumane behaviors, and specific for a respective discipline; e.g., Egairt was a catastrophic event triage-bot, mimicking human attitudes, \\"I do not deal in patient plea bargaining.\\" All performances were politically, highly charged scripts. ;Dark Continence William Steen was commissioned to create a performance in front of the downtown library. Called Dark Continence, the performance included projected imagery, elaborate scaffolding, and dancer Margaret Boswell with music by Culturcide. ;Houston Center for Photography The Houston Center for Photography was founded as a member-run cooperative and was eventually incorporated as a nonprofit visual arts organization devoted exclusively to photography and related media. ;1982 ;McKee Street Bridge The McKee Street Bridge, which spans Buffalo Bayou in the northeast corner of downtown Houston, was regularly trashed with vandalism and graffiti up until the early 1980s. Artist/environmentalist Kirk Farris and photographer Paul Judice created an exhibition called Bridges over Buffalo Bayou that appeared at the Houston Public Library‚Äôs downtown branch. Farris then acquired donations of paint and lighting supplies, as well as approval from the City of Houston, and went on to single-handedly revitalize the bridge. He continued the project with the acquisition of nearby property and added park space, which has become a source of civic pride. ;The Orange Show Re-Opening The Orange Show re-opened to the public after its restoration by the Orange Show Foundation (now the Orange Show Center for Visionary Art). In 1983 the Orange Show Foundation began its stewardship of other visionary art sites and programming inspired by these sites. ;Kuumba House South African native Lindi Yeni founded Kuumba House to create, teach, perform, and preserve African art forms of dance, theater, music, and other creative expressions. ;Midtown Art Center The Midtown Art Center was founded at LaBranch and Holman Streets in 1982 as a multidisciplinary arts complex with music, visual art, performance, and literary programs. It continues as a community outreach organization. ;Core Program of the Glassell School A postgraduate fellowship program was founded at the Glassell School of Art at the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston under the direction of sculptor Allan Hacklin. It continues to thrive today providing recipients with studio space, facility use, a stipend, seminars with visiting artists and scholars, and an annual exhibition. Numerous artists from the program have contributed to the development of the Houston art scene and continue to reside in the city. ;Center for Art and Performance In 1982, Michael Peranteau and artist Max Pruneda founded the Center for Art and Performance (CAP), a gallery/alternative art space on Almeda Road where many local artists had their first exhibitions and performances. These artists include Terrell James, Kathleen Packlick, Jesus Moroles, John Peters a.k.a. Perry Webb a.k.a. Mark Flood, Beth Secor, among many others. ;1983 ;DiverseWorks Artist Charles Gallagher founded DiverseWorks in an historic Civil War-era armory and dry goods store on Travis Street in downtown Houston. It included studios and an artist-in-residence program with James Bettison, Billy Hassell, Doug Laguarda, Don Redmond, Lisa Schoyer, and Beth Secor as early participants. In 1989 a fire forced DiverseWorks to move to The Docks near the East Freeway, a warehouse complex where some artists also maintain studios privately. DiverseWorks Artspace continues as a vital laboratory where programming includes the visual, performing, and literary arts. In 2012, DiverseWorks moved to 4102 Fannin Street, in the heart of the Midtown Arts and Entertainment District, and within the Houston Museum District. ;Dennis Hopper in Houston In May at Studio One, William Steen presented Paintings and Assemblages by Dennis Hopper, with a related screening at the Rice University Media Center of a film (Out of the Blue, 1980, directed by and starring Hopper) involving a school bus accident. The entire audience was then transported via school buses to the Big H Speedway stock car race track for the ‚ÄúRussian Dynamite Death Chair Act.‚Äù In the infield, Hopper sat in a chair rigged with six sticks of dynamite and safely blew himself up. ;Consolidated Arts Warehouse In the summer, artist Lee Benner renovated the old Consolidated Meats Warehouse on Montrose just south of the Highway 59 overpass. The first event, ‚ÄúDance with Live Artists,‚Äù was a huge blowout with five bands, multiple happenings, and artwork on display. The venue remained open periodically for the next couple of years, catering to punk music and exhibitions of young artists in Houston's burgeoning art scene. ;The Flower Man Cleveland Turner found himself homeless and living on skid row until he had a vision in 1983 of a whirlwind that deposited colorful junk onto a long wall. Since then, he has transformed his homes in Houston's Third Ward with massive amounts of colorful debris, handmade sculptures, and flower gardens. ;FotoFest FotoFest was founded by photographers Fred Baldwin and Wendy Watriss and European gallery dealer Petra Benteler as the first international biennial of photography and related art in the U.S. In March 1986, FotoFest presented its first biennial of photography in sixty-four sites around Houston. ;Firehouse Gallery The Houston Women's Caucus for Art opened an exhibition space, the Firehouse Gallery, in former Houston Fire Station No. 16 on Westheimer Street in Neartown. ;1984 ;Artists' Warehouse Alliance Lee Benner, John Calaway and Sandra Joseph started AWA early in 1984. Artist were moving into the abandon warehouses north of downtown in large numbers. The first meeting over 50 artist came, the youngest artist there said \\"we should name ourselves The Cloud because we all had our heads in a cloud\\".

An estimated 1.3 million people attended the event, making it one of the largest concerts in history up to that time. ;New Music America 1986 The Houston Festival presented New Music America 1986 as part of the city's Sesquicentennial celebrations. The world's largest festival of experimental music, which showcased renowned musicians and artists working with sound, was inaugurated in New York at The Kitchen in 1980. It was presented yearly in different cities in the United States until 1990. The festival in Houston exploited the city's special qualities and spaces, including the Astrodome, the tunnel system of downtown, various office lobbies, a YWCA pool, and incoming airline flights. ;New Music Parade New Music Parade by New York musician/composer Tom Cora, noted for his improvisational work in jazz and rock, launched New Music America 1986 in Houston. Cora collaborated with local artists Trish Herrera and Rachel Hecker on the organization of the parade, which included a hodge-podge of Houston's art community, including the Urban Animals, sculptural cars by Jackie Harris and Paul Kittelson, belly dancers, and more. The New Music Parade proceeded south on Montrose to the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston sculpture garden, which opened that same day with an event featuring the world premiere of John Cage's ‚ÄúRyoanji.‚Äù Inspired by the success of the New Music Parade, The Orange Show organized the first Art Car Parade in 1988. ;Stegosaurus by Paul Kittelson DiverseWorks sponsored public artworks placed throughout Houston. Paul Kittelson received one of these modest $500 grants and created his Stegosaurus, a life-size dinosaur made of foam cushions over a metal armature, which he installed under the Highway 59 overpass (later demolished) at Montrose Boulevard. The sculpture became a public phenomenon during its nine-month installation. It met its demise when it was set on fire by anonymous arsonists. ;On Waugh Gallery Artist Ted Brown, with Karen Poltarek, and Rick Sargent, who were co-owners, opened an exhibition space in a building at 1306 Waugh Drive.

He placed slow-scan video cameras and permanent markers at the figure's head, hands, and feet. The monitors receiving the video images, the project's working drawings, and its maps were installed at DiverseWorks. ;Tar Babies In April Los Angeles artist Michael McCall tarred telephone poles and switching boxes throughout Houston with his Tar Baby paintings, which were mixed-media paintings on roofing tar paper. ;Community Artists‚Äô Collective The organization was conceived by artists and art educators Michelle Barnes and Dr. Sarah Trotty (Texas Southern University) to assist African American artists with a special sensitivity to women artists. In 1989 its headquarters was established in midtown. The Collective has sponsored numerous exhibitions and educational programs, many aimed at making cultural experiences more accessible to inner-city youth. ;Robbie Conal Posters DiverseWorks brought Los Angeles artist Robbie Conal to Houston to install his posters of politicians and celebrities guerilla-style throughout the city, including images from his Men With No Lips and Women With Teeth series. ;Houston Gorilla Girls Inspired by the activities of the New York and Chicago Guerrilla Girls who offered a critique of male-dominated art world activities, a small group of steadfastly anonymous women artists formed the Houston Gorilla Girls. Dressed in gorilla masks and costumes to hide their identities and to foment a satirical counterpoint at art openings, they carried signs, targeted art events, and distributed handouts with statistics about the poor representation of women in the arts. DiverseWorks brought the Gorilla Girls to Houston where they mounted a major installation and never disclosed their identities. ;Super Canvas Patrick Media began its sponsorship of the Super Canvas Project in which a panel selected artists to design billboards, which were then produced and displayed throughout Houston. This project continued for a few years. ;Watermelon Flats Local artists banded together to organize their own temporary outdoor sculpture show called Watermelon Flats set along Buffalo Bayou in a location across from the Wortham Center, an area that was once an outdoor farmers‚Äô market. Included in this inaugural exhibition were works by Paul Kittelson, Noah Edmundson, Jackie Harris, The Art Guys, Dean Ruck, Olin Calk, Carter Ernst, Ken Adams, Pati Airey, and Tim Glover, among many others. Watermelon Flats eventually became what is today Buffalo Bayou Art Park. ;1988 ;That's Painting Productions French-born conceptual artist Bernard Brunon began a high-concept art project in Houston that consisted of painting rooms, walls, or exteriors in a manner that was indistinguish-able from typically painted rooms, walls, or exteriors. He considers these ‚Äújobs‚Äù as his artwork and signs, dates, and catalogues his efforts. ;Magnolia Grove Neighborhood Painter Salle Werner Vaughn began to acquire neighboring bungalows and transform them into environments evocative of another time and place; the houses hovered somewhere between artwork and home. To create the neighborhood, Vaughn purchased her property in tandem with Hiram Butler, who bought the block adjacent to hers to build his gallery and sculpture garden, retaining one of the modest houses on the property for his home. ;The Art Car Parade In 1988 The Orange Show, in conjunction with the Houston International Festival, organized and presented the first Art Car Parade in downtown Houston as a tribute to the burgeoning phenomenon of ‚Äúart cars.‚Äù The parade continues annually under the auspices of the Orange Show Center for Visionary Art and has become an internationally recognized focus of the art car movement. ;1989 ;Buffalo Bayou ArtPark The Buffalo Bayou ArtPark was founded as a continuation of the Watermelon Flats show. Today it is an artist-run organization that features a constantly rotating collection of public art below the Sabine Street Bridge between Allen Parkway and Memorial Drive. Twenty to twenty-five works of art are displayed at the park at any one time. ;Meaux's Bayou/ Zocalo/ TemplO Nestor Topchy, Rick Lowe, and Dean Ruck moved to a six-acre site on Feagan Street in the West End to fashion one of the most energetic communal art projects in the city. The site included several living spaces, a theater, a communal kitchen, gardens, several warehouse spaces for studios, and an outdoor stage and canopy used as a drive- in movie theater for up to thirty-five cars. Many artists lived and worked there, including Jim Pirtle, Andy Mann, Michael Battey, Fritz Welch, Mario Perez, and Giles Lyon. Initially called Meaux's Bayou,Topchy changed the compound's name to Zocalo, and then to TemplO as it grew and transformed. ;Rubber‚ÄìAn Art Mob Begun by artists Wayne Gilbert, Kelly Alison, Bill Hailey and filmmaker Ramzy Telley, Rubber‚ÄìAn Art Mob mounted twenty-five to thirty exhibitions in Texas. For a few years, the group ran 101 Space, located near downtown, as their home base. Their projects included film, video, performance art, and visual and sculptural exhibitions. ;Social Bodies Social Bodies, a one-night exhibition of the work of John Peters, occupied two sites: Homage, a downtown club, and 3221 Milam. To serve as his stand-in at one site, Peters hired a male model, who signed his own eight-by-ten headshots as ‚ÄúJohn Peters.‚Äù On his new canvases, Peters sold advertising space by the square inch. ;Aerosol Warfare Graffiti artists GONZO247 and MERGE360 began to document on video what they were doing both legally and illegally. They established a pen pal system with graffiti artists in other cities, exchanging videos of their work. They then compiled these videos from all over the world under the name Aerosol Warfare to create a video magazine covering all aspects of emerging hip-hop culture; centered on graffiti, the magazine is now sold worldwide. In 1992 they established Houston's first ‚Äúwall of fame,‚Äù a legal spot for artists to graffiti, which is still running today at Palmer and McKinney Streets. In 1994 Christian Azul and Christopher Karl \\"BeZerk One\\" joined Aerosol Warfare. ;Art Guise World Headquarters In 1989 The Art Guys renovated and moved into a nineteenth-century warehouse on the northern edge of Houston's Heights neighborhood. This became their studio as well as an alternative art space, where they presented and staged exhibitions and performances of their own work and the work of other artists. For more than fifteen years while at this location, The Art Guys Museum (its name changed frequently) was a Houston hot spot for unusual and sometimes seminal exhibitions, performances, and events. ;True Artist Tales Artist Scott Gilbert's comic strip appeared in The Public News, which was then Houston's leading alternative newspaper weekly, and later moved to The Houston Press. True Artist Tales began as a make-believe comic soap opera in which Gilbert sprinkled recognizable characters with pseudonyms to present a semi-fictitious rendering of the Houston art scene. ;Primal Screen Primal Screen: A Fake Art Movement, an exhibition organized by artist John Peters for Treebeard's Restaurant on Market Square, included work by Jane Addison, Jose Cipriano Aquirre, James Bettison, Mel Chin, Randy Cole, Jeff Cowie, Ramona Fabregas, Wes Hicks, John Kaiser, Jack Massing, Joel Orr, John Peters, and Santiago Pretence, with opening night music by Jim Pirtle.  1990s  ;1990 ;Project Houston Organized by Deborah Brauer for DiverseWorks, Project Houston was a collaborative exhibition presenting designs for Houston's future by artists, architects, engineers, scientists, a choreographer, and a composer, working both individually and in teams.

ILYB's website iloveyoubaby.org acts as an archive of their work from 2003-2008. ;Market Square Park Soon after DiverseWorks began programming in its building next to Market Square, it initiated a plan for an artist-designed park. Participating in this landmark park project, one of the first artist-designed parks in the country, were Malou Flato, Paul Hester, Douglas Hollis, James Surls, and Richard Turner. They worked collaboratively to design the park in cooperation with the Houston Parks and Recreation Department. It was dedicated in 1992. ;Don‚Äôt GAG the Arts The rally ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt GAG the Arts,‚Äù held in the park on the Menil campus to protest censorship of grants by the National Endowment for the Arts (NEA) and to support freedom of expression, drew a large and vocal crowd. The NEA had rescinded grants awarded to four artists, Karen Finley, John Fleck, Holly Hughes, and Tim Miller, because of their works‚Äô provocative content. Rally speakers included Walter Hopps, Peter Marzio, Michael Peranteau, Tim Miller, and Paul Winkler. Artists made ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt Gag the Arts‚Äù posters, placards, and fans.

The ArtCrawl is always held on the last Saturday before Thanksgiving. ;Project Row Houses Project Row Houses, conceived and founded by artist Rick Lowe together with a group of African American artists and community activists, rescued and rehabilitated a series of shotgun-style houses in Houston's Third Ward, one of the city's oldest African American communities. Installations, exhibitions, and performances were programmed in the houses, some of which also became a residential program for young, single mothers . The opening of Project Row Houses was preceded by the Drive-By Show, which invited artists to paint on the plywood temporarily covering the windows of the row houses facing Holman Street. Project Row Houses has grown from the original 23 shotgun houses on 2 blocks to about 50 buildings on 8 blocks. Project Row Houses is internationally recognized and Michael Kimmelman of the New York Times said that Project Row Houses \\"may be the most impressive and visionary public art project in the country.\\" In 1999 Project Row Houses partnered with the School of Architecture at Rice University to build low-income housing. By the end of 2010 Project Row Houses will be housing over 75 residents. The art installations continue in six-month cycles. ;Arena Productions Curator Chris Ballou and artist Sean Thornton staged a series of interactive public art exhibitions in response to what they saw as inadequate art-presentation strategies by galleries and museums. Unusual in format, these exhibitions appeared in unlikely places: Frost Free was held in the appliance department of a Sears store; Potlatch occurred in a local warehouse as part of Rolywholyover‚ÄìA Circus for Museum by John Cage, presented at the Menil Collection; and Cross-City Blowout was a traveling ‚Äúart mobile‚Äù stuffed full of artworks from Houston artists. ;1994 ;Museum of the Weird Dolan Smith founded the Museum of the Weird in his two-bedroom house in Houston's Heights.

At below sea level, the is bounded on the north by Seven Mile Slough, on the east and south by the San Joaquin River, and on the west by Three Mile Slough. The island is entirely within the Rio Vista Gas Field, although well pads and associated infrastructure make up only a small part of its land use. Twitchell is eighty- five percent owned by the State of California. Twitchell Island is the site of an experiment being conducted by the U.S. Geological Survey to study whether growing tules and cattails on the sinking islands of the Sacramento Delta can reverse the soil loss caused by wind, rain and farming. The soil under the site has risen since the project started in 1996. The plants not only help rebuild the level of the soil, but sequester quite a bit of carbon as well. It is believed that farmers in the delta might be able to make money with so- called \\"carbon-capture\\" farming by planting tules and cattails rather than row crops and get paid by companies who need to meet state greenhouse gas limits.

From the Battle of the Trou√©e de Charmes (24‚Äì28 August) when the German offensive was met by a French counter-offensive, a period of preparation from when part of the French eastern armies was moved westwards towards Paris, then a final German attack against the Grand Couronn√© de Nancy, fought from by the 6th Army and the French Second Army (No√´l de Castelnau). Background After the failure of the French offensives in the Battle of Lorraine on 20 August 1914, the French Second Army was ordered by Joffre, on 22 August, to retreat to the Grand Couronn√© de Nancy, heights near Nancy, on an arc from Pont-√†-Mousson to Champenoux, Lun√©ville and Dombasle- sur-Meurthe, to defend the position at all costs. On 24 August, Rupprecht and the 6th Army tried to break through the French lines on the Moselle from Toul to √âpinal and encircle Nancy. After the Battle of the Mortagne, an attempt by the Germans to advance at the junction of the French First and Second armies. A lull followed from then the Germans simultaneously attacked Saint-Di√© and Nancy in the Battle of Grand Couronn√©. After the failure of the Battle of Mortagne, the capture of Nancy would have been an important German psychological victory and the German Emperor Wilhelm II came to supervise the offensive. The German attack was part of an offensive of all the German armies in France in early September; a German success would have outflanked the right of the French armies from the east. Castelnau had to send several divisions westwards to reinforce the Third Army. Prelude=German offensive preparations From the end of the Battle of the Trou√©e de Charmes on 28 August, Rupprecht and his Chief of Staff Konrad Krafft von Dellmensingen obtained more heavy artillery and managed to prevent the transfer of troops to the Eastern Front. Helmuth von Moltke the Younger wanted attacks by the German armies on the eastern flank to resume, preventing the French from withdrawing troops to the western flank near Paris. German preparations were sufficiently advanced for the offensive to begin during the night of 3 September. French defensive preparations Castelnau concluded that the losses of the Second Army and the withdrawal of forces, to reinforce the Third Army, made it unlikely that the Second Army could withstand another German attack and submitted a memorandum to Joffre with the alternatives of fighting the battle without withdrawal, which would exhaust his forces or falling back to two successive defensive positions, which would cover the right flank of the French armies from Verdun to Paris and delay the German advance. Battle The German offensive began during the night of 3/4 September, against the fortifications of the Grand Couronn√© on either side of Nancy, which pushed back the 2nd Group of Reserve Divisions (General L√©on Durand) to the north and the XX Corps (General Maurice Balfourier) to the south, by the evening of 4 September. In the afternoon of 5 September, Castelnau telegraphed to Joffre that he proposed to evacuate Nancy, rather than hold ground, to preserve the fighting power of the army. Next day Joffre replied that the Second Army was to hold the area east of Nancy if at all possible and only then retire to a line from the Forest of Haye to Saffais, Belchamp and Borville. The civilian authorities in the city had begun preparations for an evacuation but the troops on the Grand Couronn√© repulsed German attacks on the right flank during 5 September. To the east and north of Nancy, the Reserve divisions were only pushed back a short distance. An attempt by Moltke to withdraw troops from the 6th Army, to join a new 7th Army being formed for operations on the Oise failed, when Rupprecht and Dellmensingen objected and were backed by the Emperor, who was at the 6th Army headquarters. German attacks continued on 6 September and the XX Corps conducted a counter-attack, which gave the defenders a short period to recuperate but the troops of the 2nd Group of Reserve Divisions, east and north of Nancy began to give way. On 7 September, German attacks further north drove a salient into the French defences south of Verdun at St. Mihiel, which threatened to separate the Second and Third armies. At Nancy, part of the 59th Reserve Division retreated from the height of St Genevi√®ve, which overlooked the Grand Couronn√© to the north-west of Nancy, exposing the left flank of the Second Army and Nancy to envelopment. Castelnau prepared to withdraw and abandon Nancy but was circumvented by the Second Army staff, who contacted Joffre and Castelnau was ordered to maintain the defence of the Grand Couronn√© for another (Castelnau had received news that a son had been killed, giving the orders while still shocked.) The French abandonment of the height of St Genevi√®ve went unnoticed by the Germans, who had retired during the afternoon and the height was reoccupied before they could react. German attacks continued until the morning of 8 September, then diminished as Moltke began to withdraw troops to the right (west) flank of the German armies. Moltke sent Major Roeder, from his staff to the 6th Army, with orders to end the offensive and prepare to retire to the frontier; only at this point did Rupprecht find out that the armies near Paris were under severe pressure. On 10 September, the 6th Army began to withdraw to the east. On 13 September, Pont-√†-Mousson and Lun√©ville were re-occupied by the French unopposed and the French armies closed up to the Seille river, where the front stabilised until 1918. Aftermath=Analysis The battles near Nancy contributed to the Allied success at the First Battle of the Marne, by fixing a large number of German troops in Lorraine. German attempts to break through between Toul and √âpinal were costly in manpower and supplies, which might have had more effect elsewhere. The German offensives failed and were not able to prevent Joffre from moving troops westwards to outnumber the German armies near Paris. Casualties In 2009, Holger Herwig wrote that in September, the 6th Army suffered with killed, despite half the army being en route to Belgium; most lost in the fighting at the Grand Couronn√©. The 7th Army suffered of which killed. The German army never calculated a definitive casualty list for the fighting in Alsace and Lorraine but the Bavarian official historian Karl Deuringer made a guess of casualties, of which were killed, in the fifty infantry brigades which fought in the region, which would amount to which the (ten-day casualty reports) bore out.

His design features two arched ribs, one on either side of the roadway, rising above the deck. The deck is suspended from the arches by vertical risers. Drivers see the rainbow arch crowns on each side, similar to crossing a pony truss bridge. The bridge over the Little Cottonwood River is one of the oldest Marsh rainbow arches in the country. Unfortunately, as traffic flow increased and farm machinery got larger, many of Marsh's rainbow arch designs became obsolete, since they could not be widened.

The festival‚Äôs motto is \\"Spotlight on African American and African Diaspora Cinema\\". History The San Diego Black Film Festival, originally known as the Noir Film Festival, began in 2003 in a hotel room in the Gaslamp Quarter. Three films were shown, and approximately 20 people attended. In 2006 the name of the festival was changed to the San Diego Black Film Festival because the organizers realized that there was confusion with \\"Film Noir\\". By 2011, with 120 films scheduled and between 15,000 and 30,000 attendees expected, the festival had become one of the largest black film festivals in the United States and one of the most important festivals in San Diego. The festival runs for four days and shows more than 100 films each year, in categories including: comedy, drama, documentaries, animation, GLBT, horror, religious, foreign/African Diaspora, shorts, feature films and music videos. It took place at the Regal United Artists Theatre in the Westfield Horton Plaza mall, then at the Pacific Gaslamp multiplex. In 2017 it expanded to three theaters and began developing a Black Film Centre, which will ultimately host the festival as well as housing an archive.

George Mel√©ndez Wright (June 20, 1904 ‚Äì February 25, 1936) was an American biologist who conceived of, then conducted, the first scientific survey of fauna for the National Park Service between 1929 and 1933. Wright was a pioneer in many ways, but especially for his holistic approach to wildlife management issues in the National Parks. Wright and his colleagues spent years in the field researching wildlife issues, and advocating for an ecosystem-wide approach to managing species within, and bordering, the parks. The George Wright Society, founded in 1980, honors Wright's vision.  Early life  Wright was born in San Francisco, California. Wright's Salvadoran mother Mercedes Mel√©ndez Wright was born in San Salvador, and was from one of El Salvador's most powerful, and largest, families. Wright's father was John Tennant Wright, a descendant of a long line of San Francisco-based steamship captains who followed his family‚Äôs footsteps by establishing a thriving import/export business along the Pacific Coast. Both of Wright's parents died when he was still young, leaving him in the care of a great aunt, Cordelia Ward Wright, who encouraged his fascination with the natural world and his interest in science. Throughout his childhood, Wright cultivated a practice of observing and recording the habits of wildlife, particularly birds. At the age of 16, Wright started his studies in forestry and vertebrate zoology at the University of California, Berkeley under Professor Walter Mulford in Forestry and the renowned field zoologist, Professor Joseph Grinnell, head of the University's Museum of Vertebrate Zoology. During his studies, Wright also worked in close contact with Grinnell's assistant, Joseph Scattergood Dixon, the museum's Economic Mammologist. All three would be Wright‚Äôs mentors academically and professionally. During his time at the university, Wright spent his summer vacations exploring California, the West, and beyond. In 1921, at the age of 17, he ventured north to Alaska. An early Sierra Club member, Wright participated on the Club‚Äôs 1922 High Country trip out of Sequoia National Park and the Kings River Canyon. Subsequent summers found him visiting western National Parks in his worn out Model T Ford. In 1926, while still a student at Berkeley, Wright accompanied Dixon on a collecting trip up to Alaska, sponsored by a wealthy East Coast naturalist, in search of the eggs of the elusive surfbird. The trip was a success, with Wright becoming the first person to successfully locate a surfbird's nest.  Career  In 1927, Wright entered into the National Park Service and joined the staff of Yosemite National Park as Assistant Park Naturalist, working under Carl Parcher Russell. Through this work as well as his time spent in national parks throughout the west, Wright became very concerned about what he would come to call ‚Äúthe problems caused by conflict between man and animal through joint occupancy of the park areas.‚Äù Wright was particularly concerned about the excessive predator control practiced for years within parks and adjacent lands, poaching, the park service practice of feeding grizzly and black bears for entertainment, and the lack of adequate habitat and forage for wildlife species within parks (deer, elk, buffalo, antelope) due to unnatural park boundaries and the grazing of sheep and cattle within parks. In 1929, with the help of Joseph Dixon, Wright convinced then National Park Service Director Horace Albright to approve a survey of the wildlife and wildlife issues in the national parks in the western U.S. The survey was a ground-breaking project which took root during the early years of the Great Depression; Wright himself funded the survey and the salaries for his two colleagues, Dixon and Benjamin Hunter Thompson. The Wildlife Team of Wright, Dixon, and Thompson (often accompanied by Wright‚Äôs wife, Bee Ray Wright), spent three field seasons visiting National Parks in their customized 1930 Buick, which they called ‚ÄúThe Truck.‚Äù The results were published in 1932 as Fauna of the National Parks of the United States, a Preliminary Survey of Faunal Relations in National Parks. Their follow-up publication, rounding out the two part \\"Fauna\\" series, Wildlife Management in the National Parks was published in 1934 and was soon adopted as official National Park Service policy. For the first time, the survey and reports established science as the basis for wildlife conservation in American national parks. In 1933, Wright became the first chief of the newly-formed Wildlife Division of the Park Service. Under his leadership, and with the aid of Civilian Conservation Corp funding, each of the national parks began to survey and evaluate the status of wildlife on an ongoing basis in order to identify urgent problems especially in regards to restoration, conflict management, and rare or endangered species. During his brief Wright wrote numerous articles and professional papers extolling the virtues of the National Parks and the need to maintain them in their ‚Äúpristine‚Äù or ‚Äúprimitive‚Äù state. And how‚Äîwith proper science-based management, strategic restoration, and expansion‚Äîthe national parks could recover and steward their wildlife (and flora) while also accommodating increasing human visitation.  Death and Legacy  In February 1936, Wright along with his friend and colleague Roger Toll (Superintendent of Yellowstone National Park), and several other park service members, were notified by the Secretary of the Interior that the President had designated them members of a Commission ‚Äú‚Ä¶to formulate policies and plans for the establishment and development of international parks, forest reserves and wildlife refuges along the international boundary between Mexico and the United States.‚ÄùSecretary of the State, Letter to George M. Wright, Chief, Wildlife Division, National Park Service, February 8, 1936. Copy of letter held by Pamela Mel√©ndez Wright Lloyd. After several successful days exploring what is now Big Bend National Park with park and forest representatives from Mexico, the American contingent moved west to look at other potential border parks. On February 25, Wright and Toll died in an automobile accident near Deming, New Mexico. George Wright was 31. The Park Service was devastated by the loss of two of their most prominent colleagues. Had he lived, Wright likely would have become one of America‚Äôs most influential conservationists. The historian Richard West Sellars called Wright's vision for the management of national parks \\"truly revolutionary, penetrating beyond the scenic fa√ßades of the parks to comprehend the significance of the complex natural world.‚Äù Wright was also featured in Ken Burns and Dayton Duncan's 2009 documentary, \\"National Parks: America's Best Idea.\\" The George Wright Society is named in his honor.

It is mandated by provincial legislation to act in the public interest and cannot own any transmission, distribution or generation assets. The key duties and responsibilities of the AESO are dictated by the Province of Alberta's Electric Utilities Act (EUA) and the Transmission Regulation (T-Reg) and include, without limitation, the following: * Determine the future requirements of the AIES, develop transmission plans over near-term, medium- term and long-term planning horizons that identify transmission system enhancements needed to meet those requirements, and make arrangements to implement those enhancements as necessary. * Prepare and maintain a transmission system that anticipates, for at least 20 years forward, system conditions and requirements. The system must be planned to accommodate future growth, which requires the AESO to take a long-term view while adjusting for short-term changes and focusing on system requirements that meet the long-term vision for electrical infrastructure. * Ensure the safe, reliable and economic operation of the AIES. * Operate the power pool and facilitate the electricity market in a manner that is fair, efficient and openly competitive. * Provide transmission access service consistent with an approved transmission tariff. * Manage and recover the costs associated with line losses and ancillary services. * Conduct a fair and open competitive process to determine the successful proponent who will develop, design, build, finance, own, operate, and maintain identified major transmission infrastructure in Alberta. The AESO operates a market for the exchange of electric energy in Alberta and attempts to uphold the principles of market fairness, openness, and efficiency. To this end the AESO \\"contracts with transmission facility owners to provide generators access to the electric grid.\\" One of AESO's responsibilities is to manage system load in the case where shortfalls in supply or excessive demand for electricity threaten the integrity of the power grid. In this case AESO can direct power companies to shed load temporarily through measures such as rolling blackouts. In July 2012, six power generators were shut down during a major heat wave that resulted in high demand on the power grid, Edmonton, Calgary, Red Deer and Lethbridge were hit by rolling blackouts. AESO directed utilities to reduce their customer load. AESO's Doug Simpson explained that this had not happened since 2006. According to their homepage, AESO operates \\"independently of any industry affiliations and owns no transmission or market assets.\\"  History  Alberta electricity policy changed in 1996, with the province restructuring its electricity market away from traditional regulation to a market-based system. The market now includes a host of buyers and sellers, and an increasingly diverse infrastructure.  Expanding wind farms  In 2006 Alberta Electric System Operator explained the limitations of dependence on wind power. AESO at that time could not \\"rely on any more than 900 megawatts of wind (less than eight per cent of the province's total power generation) because wind doesn't blow consistently. When it drops off, coal and natural gas plants have to take up the slack to avoid power shortages.\\" At that time Alberta didn't have \\"enough transmission lines to connect new wind turbines to its power grid.\\"  High cost of electricity in Alberta  In April 2013, Calgary ranked third (with an average monthly payment of $216 based on a monthly consumption of 1,000 kWh) and Edmonton fourth ($202 a month) in Canada compared to other cities in terms of high electricity bills.

Vancouver, BC was among the least expensive($130 a month).

Keith Provost, former senior vice-president of Alberta Power Ltd.

According to AESO, \\"The pool price is the arithmetic average of the 60 one-minute system marginal prices. Only those offers accepted generate power and receive the AESO pool price.

It was used to describe an anti-social youth who was non law-abiding and was feared by others. They were often gang members. After the integration of Jamaican culture with that of the United Kingdom in the 1970s, badman (along with several other words and phrases) became of common usage in the UK, where it has gained particular popularity in London and the South-East. The words badman and very rarely badgirl are also associated with such UK music scenes as grime, dubstep and big beat. The words are used in this context to describe a person who is either powerful, someone who commands respect in their neighbourhood, or someone affluent, any of which would make them stand out from the crowd. In the UK grime culture, MCs whose lyrics are particularly meaningful or persuasive are said to be a badman. The term can also be used sarcastically to describe somebody who has an inflated ego or brags about illegal acts. The word has parallels with other terms, such as gangsta, rude boy, or bad boy.

May 2008. Now there is one, unified, online NYPL catalog. The group's purview included the catalog and more. Controversy surrounded the integration of research and circulating collection catalogs.

With 24 years he was at that time the youngest party leader of Austria, yet not electable because of his age. However, Neumann has been overthrown by radicalized groups. By his publishing activity, Neumann helped to rehabilitate 13 wrongly convicted men (among them Rudolf Rechberger, Huberth Ranneth und Josef Auer).

Fletcher was also one of the principal founders of the Dalhousie Opera Company, and over several seasons he conducted the Marriage of Figaro by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, the Barber of Seville by Gioachino Rossini and Tosca by Giacomo Puccini. In 1976 Peter Fletcher returned to the UK to work in School Music in Leicester, and took over the directorship of the Leicestershire Schools Symphony Orchestra following the retirement of Eric Pinkett. With the orchestra, as Principal Music Advisor for Leicestershire, he embarked upon a series of tours throughout Europe, and as a group they became known for the quality of their performances of Gustav Mahler, Dmitri Shostakovich, Messiaen, Charles Ives, Michael Tippett, Elliott Carter, Douglas Young, Iannis Xenakis and other 20th-century composers.The Guardian, 7 June 1996 LSSO archivist John Whitmore recalls that Douglas Young [Composer in Residence in Leicester for 3 years, 1981-84] developed a close musical partnership with Fletcher; this artistic relationship stretched the orchestra's technical and musical abilities greatly, and moved the ensemble forward to a new peak of excellence. During his 8-year tenure at Leicester, Fletcher also conducted the Leicestershire Chorale and with the orchestra recorded Tippett's The Shires Suite, and made a stunning digital recording of Douglas Young's The Hunting of the Snark, narrated by Peter Easton which was reissued by Cameo Classics, the original label, on CD in 2013 . The Chorale was founded in 1977 largely by the efforts of Dr Andrew Fairbairn, the then Director of Education for Leicestershire and Rutland, who had himself been a choral scholar at Trinity College Cambridge. When he and others perceived the need for a choir which would provide, in particular, a performance outlet for teachers in Leicestershire he took his ideas to Peter Fletcher and he agreed to be the first Musical Director of the Chorale, a role which he continued until 1984. By then excellent links had been established with the Leicestershire Schools Symphony Orchestra and they had accompanied several Chorale performances. This was the beginning of the tradition unique among Chamber Choirs in the region to have a least one major work accompanied by orchestra in each season. In 1984 Fletcher was appointed Director of the Welsh College of Music and Drama in Cardiff. He attempted to dismiss a number of members of staff: disapproval by the governing body led to the termination of his contractThe Guardian, 7 June 1996 [Classical Music magazine carried a headline 'early bath for Fletcher']. From 1990 to 1993 Fletcher held the post of Dean of Music at the Hong Kong Academy for Performing Arts, after which he retired to a cottage in North Wales to focus on the writing of his book \\"World Musics in Context\\", which was edited and prepared for publication after his death by John Hosier. He had also been the author of the earlier book \\"Roll over Rock\\"[1981], a study of the position of music in contemporary culture. In the autumn of 1995 Fletcher was one of twenty-five music examiners spending ten weeks in Hong Kong on behalf of the Associated Board of the Royal Schools of Music. Although within six months of dying of cancer, there were no outward signs and he made no mention of it. Just before he died in 1996, Peter returned to St James the Greater, Leicester to conduct the Leicestershire Chorale in a performance of J. S. Bach‚Äôs Mass in B minor.

To this end, a succession of small British military expeditions landed in Senegal and captured the French settlements of Saint-Louis and Gor√©e, seizing French vessels and supplies. By late 1758 the whole of the French colony on the Senegalese coast had been captured by the British, with administrative matters being handled by the first (and only) British Governor of Senegal, Lieutenant Colonel Richard Worge. Background The plan was devised by an American merchant Thomas Cumming who had previously visited West Africa, and extensively considered the possibilities for a British expedition.Brown p. 165 The plan was built around Britain's growing dominance on the Oceans which had dramatically reduced French sea power. A British naval force under Captain Henry Marsh would sail from England and head for the coast of West Africa, where it would land an amphibious force at the Senegal River. They would then capture the French fort at Saint-Louis. Cumming planned to raise support from local African forces, who would rendezvous with the British and attack the French.Anderson p. 306 The French settlements in Senegal had little strategic value,Robson 2016, pp. 81‚Äì83 but they were important to France's global trade in slaves. They were also home to a substantial industry in natural gums. The principal object of the expedition was therefore to damage the French economy by cutting access to these industries. Such expeditions were part of Southern Secretary William Pitt's strategy of destroying France's capacity to continue the war by draining her of funds.Robson 2016, pp. 81‚Äì83 Expedition The settlement of Saint-Louis in 1780 Two hundred troops and two warships were to take part in the expedition. The forces departed from Plymouth in early 1758, and after a brief stop for supplies at Tenerife, they reached the coast of West Africa in April. Cumming had gone ashore to secure support amongst locals, and they launched a landward blockade of the fort. Marsh then put his troops ashore. The sudden arrival of British troops took the garrison completely by surprise. On 1 May they surrendered the fort, and the resident traders swore allegiance to the British.McLynn p. 99 Not a single Briton had been killed in the taking of the settlement.Anderson p. 306 Cumming's ships returned home crammed with captured goods valued at hundreds of thousands of pounds. Pitt was extremely pleased at the ease with which the British forces had taken Saint-Louis. He was also impressed by the large quantities of gum arabic which were brought back to Britain, opening up a much cheaper source of the good for silk- weavers.McLynnp.99 In the wake of the missions' success, two further expeditions were sent out that year, which captured the Island of Gor√©e and the French trading station on the Gambia.McLynn pp. 99‚Äì100 Pitt would have liked to have launched further expeditions but could not in the face of opposition from the Duke of Newcastle who feared that stripping the British Isles of troops would leave them vulnerable to invasion. Aftermath Along with attacks against Canada, the West Indies and Philippines, the capture of Senegal demonstrated the new global reach of the Royal Navy and the increasingly global nature of conflicts between the competing European powers who were battling for dominance and control of resources on several continents ‚Äì as a consequence historians have labeled it the first 'world war'. Ownership of the West African settlements became a major source of contention between Britain and France during the peace talks that led to the 1763 Treaty of Paris. The negotiations centred on a potential return of some of the captured outposts. Britain was keen to keep hold of the Senegalese mainland, but willing to return the island of Gor√©e. Ultimately Britain kept Saint-Louis and the Senegal mainland. The British were keen to build up their presence in West Africa, and intended to use Senegal as a starting point for this. They raised the Africa Corps, a special unit of troops under the command of Charles O'Hara, to protect the new possession. The French were unhappy about the loss of this valuable colony, and planned to regain them in any future conflict with Britain. In 1764, the French launched incursions against the coast of Senegal from Gor√©e angering the British cabinet.Simms p. 510 In 1779 during the American War of Independence a French force landed and seized Saint-Louis, and Senegal was ceded to them by Britain as part of the Treaty of Paris that ended the war in 1783. However French control remained sporadic until the mid- nineteenth century. See also * France in the Seven Years' War ReferencesBibliography * Anderson, Fred.

An extensive terminology has evolved to describe their common features. This glossary provides definitions for these terms. Terms which relate solely to boilers used for space heating or generating hot water are identified by (HVAC).  A-B  Steam locomotive blastpipe manhole and bridge clamp ; : A container beneath the furnace, catching ash and clinker that falls through the firebars. This may be made of brickwork for a stationary boiler, or steel sheet for a locomotive. Ashpans are often the location of the damper. They may also be shaped into hoppers, for easy cleaning during disposal. ; Blastpipe: Part of the exhaust system that discharges exhaust steam from the cylinders into the smokebox beneath the chimney in order to increase the draught through the fire. ; Blow-down: Periodic venting of water from the boiler. This water contains the most concentrated precursors for sludge build-up, so by venting it whilst still dissolved, the build-up is reduced. When early marine boilers were fed with salt water, they would be blown-down several times an hour. ; : A valve mounted low-down on the boiler, often around the foundation ring, which is used for blow down. ; Blower: The blower provides a forced draught on the fire, encouraging combustion. It consists of a hollow ring mounted either in the base of the chimney or on top of the blastpipe. Holes are drilled in the top of the blower ring, and when steam is fed into the ring, the steam jets out of the holes and up the chimney, stimulating draught, much like a blastpipe. ; :A pressure vessel for the creation of hot water or steam, for residential or commercial use. ; : A craftsman skilled in the techniques required for the construction and repair of boilers - not to be confused with at boilermaker (common misconception). A boilermaker is a skilled metalworker, usually the member of a union of the same name, skilled in platework or welding. A boilermaker may or may not be a boilersmith. ; Boiler stay: A structural element inside a boiler which supports surfaces under pressure by tying them together. ; Boiler suit: Heavy-duty one-piece protective clothing, worn when inspecting the inside of a firebox for steam leaks, for which task it is necessary to crawl through the firehole door. ; Boiler ticket: The safety certificate issued for a steam (locomotive) boiler on passing a formal inspection after a major rebuild, and generally covering a period of ten years (eight years on the mainline. Additional annual safety inspections must also be undertaken, which may result in the locomotive being withdrawn from service if the boiler requires work. When the ticket \\"expires\\" the locomotive cannot be used until the boiler has been overhauled or replaced, and a new ticket obtained. ; Boiler water treatment: Removal or chemical modification of boiler feedwater impurities to avoid scale, corrosion, or foaming. ; : A horizontal baffle of firebrick within the furnace, usually of a locomotive boiler. This forces combustion gases from the front of the furnace to flow further, back over the rest of the furnace, encouraging efficient combustion. The invention of the brick arch, along with the blastpipe and forced draught, was a major factor in allowing early locomotives to begin to burn coal, rather than coke. ; :  C-E  ; : the damaging condition where water droplets are carried out of the boiler along with the dry steam. These can cause scouring in turbines or hydraulic lock in cylinders. The risk is accentuated by dirty feedwater. : See also priming. ; : or clack valve, from the noise it makes. A non-return valve where the feedwater enters the boiler drum. They are usually mounted halfway along the boiler drum, or else as a top feed, but away from the firebox, so as to avoid stressing it with the shock of cold water. ; : The layer of insulation and outer wrapping around a boiler shell, particularly that of a steam locomotive. In early practice this was usually wooden strips held by brass bands. Later and modern practice is to use asbestos insulation matting (or other less hazardous fibres) covered with rolled steel sheets. The outer shape of the cladding is often a simplification of the underlying boiler shell. Also termed \\"clothing\\" in LMS practice. ; : The framework of hoops used to support cladding over a boiler. Named from the similar hoops under a crinoline skirt. ; : The upper sheet of the inner firebox on a locomotive boiler. It is the hottest part of the firebox, and sometimes at risk of boiler explosion, should the water level drop and the crown sheet be exposed and thus allowed to overheat. Supported from above by complex stays. ; : An adjustable flap controlling the air admitted beneath the fire-bed. Usually part of the ashpan. ; : The cleanup process at the end of the working day, usually involving dropping the fire and blowing down the boiler. ; : a raised location on the top of the main boiler drum, providing a high point from which to collect dry steam, reducing the risk of priming. ; : large external pipes in many water-tube boilers, carrying unheated cold water from the steam drum down to the water drum as part of the circulation path. ; : Either a fire-tube or water-tube that is entirely below the water-level of the operating boiler. As corrosion and scaling is most active in the region of the water-level, this reduces wear and maintenance requirements. ; : a feedwater injector that economizes on steam consumption by using waste steam, such as engine exhaust.  F  Field-tube ; Feedwater: ; Feedwater pump: ; Field-tube:A form of water-tube where the water tubes are single-ended, similar to a thimble water tube with an internal tube to encourage circulation. ; : Replaceable cast-iron bars that form the base of the furnace and support the fire. These wear out frequently, so as designed for easy replacement.. See also Rocking grate ; Firebox:In a steam engine, the area where the fuel is burned. ; Firedoor:A door leading from outside the boiler into the firebox, through which fuel (such as coal) could be added by stokers. ; : Emptying out the remains of the fire after a day's work. A time-consuming and filthy task; labour-saving ways to improve this became important in the final days of steam locomotives. ; : ; Fire-tube boiler: A boiler where the primary heating surface is tubes with hot gas flowing inside and water outside. . See also water-tube boiler ; Flash steam: ; : A large fire tube, either used as the main heating surface in a flued boiler, or used as enlarged firetubes in a locomotive-style boiler where these contain the superheater elements. ; Flued boiler: ; Foundation ring: The base of the firebox, where the inner and outer shells are joined. ; Furnace: ; Fusible plug: A safety device that indicates if the water level becomes dangerously low. It melts when overheated, releasing a jet of steam into the firebox and alerting the crew.  G-K  Galloway tubes ; Galloway tubes: tapered thermic syphon water-tubes inserted in the furnace of a Lancashire boiler. ; : part of the water level gauge, which normally consists of a vertical glass tube connected top and bottom to the boiler backplate. The water level must be visible within the glass at all times. ; : erosion of a boiler's plates from the internal water space, particularly where there is a step inside the shell. This was a problem for early boilers made from lapped plates rather than butted plates, and gave rise to many boiler explosions. In later years it was a problem for the non-circular water drums of Yarrow boilers. ; : A small manhole, too small for access but useful for inspection and washing out the boiler. See also mudhole ; Injector: a feedwater pump without moving parts that uses steam pressure and the Bernoulli effect to force feedwater into the boiler, even against its pressure. ; Klinger gauge glass: A form of gauge glass where the water level is visible through a flat glass window in a strong metal frame, rather than a cylindrical tube. These were popular with some operators, and increasingly so for high pressure boilers.  M-R  Mudhole and bridge clamp on a vertical boiler ; : an oval access door into a part of the boiler, for example the shell or, in a water tube boiler, the top drum or chamber, large enough for a worker to enter and used for maintenance and cleaning. Manholes are sealed with a removable door from the inside. As they are oval, this door may be turned and lifted out through the hole. Doors are clamped in place from the outside with one or two bridge clamps spanning the hole and tightened down with a nut on a stud. As the cutting of a manhole weakens the boiler shell, the surrounding area is strengthened with a patch. ; : a sludge of boiler scale particles, precipitates and general impurities that builds up in the lower parts of a boiler. Mud reduces water circulation and so a local buildup may lead to localized overheating and possibly explosion. ; : a water drum, particularly one mounted low on the boiler whose function is primarily to trap mud from circulation. ; : A small manhole, too small for access but useful for washing out the boiler, either as an inlet for a hose or as a drain for removed mud. See also washout plug ; Priming:Where a sudden reduction of steam pressure caused by a large, suddenly applied load may result in boiler water being pulled into the pipework. ; Regulator: ; : An advanced form of firebar, where sections of the grate may be rocked or tipped to either break up clinker within the fire, or to drop the fire after a day's work.  S  Smokebox ; Safety valve: an automatic valve used to release excess pressure within the boiler. ; : dissolved minerals from hard water that precipitate out in the steam space around the water-level. Where this scale falls to the bottom of the boiler and mixes with other contaminants, it is termed mud. ; Scum valve: A blow-down valve mounted at the water-level of a boiler, used to blow down lighter oily or foamy deposits within a boiler that float on the water-level. ; : another term for Mud. ; Smokebox: an enclosed space at the extremity of a fire-tube boiler, where the exhaust gases from the tubes are combined and pass to the flue or chimney. ; Snifting valve: ; Steam accumulator: ; Steam drum: a cylindrical vessel mounted at a high point of a water-tube boiler, where dry steam may separate above the water level, so that it may be drawn off without risk of priming. This is similar to the function of a dome in a fire-tube boiler. ; Steam & water drum: a steam drum that contains a turbulent mixture of steam and water, with a substantial part of this being water. The terms are used somewhat interchangeably. ; Steam drier: a form of mild superheater that adds additional heat to wet- or saturated steam, thus ensuring that all water in the steam has been evaporated, thus avoiding problems with water droplets in the cylinders or turbine. Unlike the superheater, the steam drier does not attempt to raise the temperature of the steam significantly beyond the boiling point. ; Steam generator: ; Steam separator: ; Suction valve: an automatic non-return valve, which opens when the boiler is at less than atmospheric pressure. This avoids any risk of vacuum collapse, when a hot boiler is allowed to cool down out of service. ; Superheater: If superheated steam is required it passed through asuperheater. This is simply a heat exchanger where additional heat is added to the saturated steam.  T-W  smokebox tubeplate Inside a water drum, showing the tube ends ; Thimble tube:A form of water-tube where the tube is single-ended; predecessor to the field tube ; Thermic siphon: ; Three-drum boiler: A generic term for water-tube boilers of the Yarrow pattern. In Royal Navy practice, a reference to the specific Admiralty example of this. ; : a plate forming the lower front of the outer firebox of a locomotive boiler, below the barrel. ; Top-feed: in locomotive boilers, a feed water check valve placed on the top of the boiler drum. This encourages rapid mixing of the cold feedwater with the hot steam, reducing the risk of thermal shock to the heated parts of the boiler. ; : a plate across the barrel of a fire-tube boiler, containing many small holes to receive the fire-tubes.

Ceramics from Cerro de las Minas site Cerro de la Minas is an archaeological site located in the modern state of Oaxaca, just to the north of the city of Huajuapan de Le√≥n. The site belongs to what is called the √ëui√±e, or lowland/hot lands Mixtec cultural area. The site is located on a hill that dominates the Valley of Huajuapan, in what are now the neighborhoods of Chapultepec, Santa Rosa, Alta Vista and Del Maestro of the city. This large hill is in a strategic position over the farmlands of the valley, which provided it with its food, as well as the trade routes that cross this valley, which made it regionally important. The site contains a number of settlements and was reserved for the elite of that area during that time. Cerro de las Minas is the only lowland Mixtec archeological site open to the public. Background This site was systematically explored by Dr. John Paddock in the 1960s. He defined the √ëui√±e culture; further extensive works were carried out by Dr. Marcus Winter in 1987. Site History 2500 Years ago, there were many Mixtec communities (Mixteca Alta y Baja) inhabited by mixtec peoples called √ëuu Yata Yata (ancient people). These groups lived in Cerro de las Minas, Diquiy√∫ and Tequixtepec (Mixteca Baja); Huamelulpan, Monte Negro, Yucuita and other (Mixteca Alta). The culture developed for 600 years, up to 250-350 CE, probably due to Teotihuacan influence would later transform into the √ëui√±e culture. Was an important √ëui√±e culture center, founded in the late Preclassic period, its apogee occurred during the early classic period, between 400 and 800 CE, during this period flourished other major cities such as Monte Alban and Teotihuacan, the latter in the Highland Valley Mexico. The area fell on the trade routes between the Valley of Mexico and the central valleys of Oaxaca, the Valley of Tehuac√°n and other areas of the Sierra Madre del Sur. Commerce through here dealt in obsidian, ceramics, textiles, metals, salt, wood, charcoal, plants, fruit, and copal. The development of this site from a village to a city is divided into two phases:  √ëudee Phase The first is called √ëudee (the Mixtec name for Huajuapan, meaning ‚Äúplace of the brave‚Äù) and covers the period from 400 BCE to 250 CE. The site was founded in the late Preclassic period by people who originated from the Santa Teresa site, two km to the south.  √ëui√±e Phase The second phase is called √ëui√±e and covers the site as a city-state from between 250 CE to about 800 CE. In both these phases, cultural influences from other Mixtec and Mesoamerican areas can be seen. It was the economic, political and cultural center of an area with a radius of about 10 to 15 km . Population peak of the site itself was between 1,000 and 2,000 people. Its apogee was reached in the Classic period with the development of the √ëui√±e culture among the lowland Mixtec in general, which had its own architecture, writing, ceramics, figurines and urns. Starting from 800 CE, the city went into decline, possibly due to being subjugated from a neighboring dominion. The area would not grow again until after the Spanish Conquest, with the founding of the Spanish city of Huajuapan in the valley area below, next to the river. This settlement was established in 1525. Cerro de las Minas has characteristics similar to cities in the Mixteca Alta. Characterized by a construction of buildings around several squares, the rest of the population distributed around these plazas. (Mixtec urban design differentiation from other cities in which the buildings were organized around a single, large square). The construction areas were modified with terraces, called coo yuu (Mixtec name for terraces). It can be translated as ‚Äúclay Dyke‚Äù, for this reason it was necessary to build stairs around the town. Cerro de las Minas was decorated with reliefs of inscriptions, using (a not very well known) writing system, called √±ui√±e. The writing system is very similar to Monte Alban (Zapotec) inscriptions, which suggests a strong relationship between the valleys and the Mixteca Baja during the classical period. Site Description  Most of the site covers about fifty hectares on the top and down the sides of the large hill although in 2007, INAH found a pre-Hispanic tomb at the foot of the Cerro de la Minas. The hill was chosen as it was defensible. The center of the site is dominated by three mounds that measure about eight meters high and forty meters in diameters. These form a line through the center of the sites and have large platforms built among them, extending for a total of about 180 meters. In addition, there is a Mesoamerican ball court that measures sixty meters long and fifteen meters wide. The sides of the hill have been terraced to create more flat spaces for a market, the palace and some residential areas. The residential areas generally contain foundations of stone, with walls of stone or adobe. Later homes built here have thinner walls made with flagstone filling in the gaps from the larger stones. Residential buildings situated in dominant positions have gravesites. This seems to be related to more modern Mixtec burial traditions, especially for those in high or preferred positions in society. The palace is divided into rooms, a central patio and a large tomb, Number 5. This tomb contains three major burials, probably related to the ruling family. A total of nine tombs were discovered, some had been robbed but in other were found human remains, vessels and gravestones with the names of the deceased. In addition to these, more than 100 ordinary graves were found. Findings Major investigation and excavation of the site was carried out in the late 1980s and early 1990s by a team of 200 people headed by Marcus Winter. Much of what little is known of this Mixtec region comes from finds at this site, especially finds related to the Mixtec glyph writing system. Most of the finds were contained in Tomb 5, located south of the main plaza in the palace complex. This tomb contained a large quantity of Mixtec ceramics as well as a multicolored urn with a representation of the god of wind or fire, with a brazier on its head, seated on a platform decorated with four glyphs. This piece is now on display at the Museum of Oaxaca. Most of the √ëui√±e writing has been found in this tomb, on gravestones. This kind of √ëui√±e writing contains a central glyph, usually the name of the deceased accompanied by dates. Two gravestones of this type were found in Tomb 5 and were probably of the governors of the city. It is the same writing system that was found in San Pedro y San Pablo Tequixtepec about 25 km to the north of the site, in the form of inscriptions under painted battle scenes were found. Tomb three was found to have been already sacked, but it still contained fragments of an urn and a carved stone. Cultural elements found here show contact and influence from other Mixtec settlements such as Diquiy√∫, Monte Negro, Huamelulpan, Yucuita and Yucu√±udahui. Despite six years of excavation, the site is still not completely explored; however, funds have not been secured to continue work at the site. Structures=Structure H1A Covers the width of the Hill Summit; There was a structure, probably a temple. Access was via a wide staircase. Mound 1 Yet to be explored, has a stairway that probably lead to a temple over (on top) the mound. Mound 2 It is a large platform with vertical walls and flat surface. Probably had residences at the northeast side, has not been determined what buildings were constructed on the platform. Main Plaza Located between mounds 1 & 2, Tomb 5 Patio is located here, surrounded on three sides by residential structures, there are basement remains of rooms and patios.  Tomb 5 Contained remains of several people, more than 70 vessels and a beautiful √±ui√±e URN. Late walls of the Tomb patio show construction techniques (block ‚Äì stone slab), and of slope-panel. In the patio is another housing area, designated area C. Ballgame Court  Beside 2 mound, remains of a structure were found, possibly a Ballgame Court (I Shaped). The evidence is unclear, only some indications are preserved and houses were built over these (√ëui√±e late phase); the elongated shape and two small engraved stones suggest its use as a court, before construction of the Houses. Mound 3 Yet to be explored, the space between mounds 2 and 3, without residential houses, as the Tomb 5 patio, it is believed to have been a Tianguis (market).

It is the general name used for pop and rock bands that were formally recognized by the Soviet government from the 1960s to the 1980s. In Soviet times, the term VIA generally meant band, but it is now used in Russia to refer specifically to pop, rock, and folk groups active during the Soviet period. History A typical 70s Soviet VIA Tsvety, in the hippie-inspired dress of the era VIA Zemlyane, circa 1984 The term VIA appeared in the Soviet Union in the 1960s and represented a model under which the Soviet government was willing to permit domestic rock and pop music acts to develop. To break through to the state-owned Soviet media, a band needed to become an officially recognized VIA. Each VIA had an artistic director (—Ö—É–¥–æ–∂–µ—Å—Ç–≤–µ–Ω–Ω—ã–π —Ä—É–∫–æ–≤–æ–¥–∏—Ç–µ–ª—å) who served as manager, producer, and state- appointed censor. In some bands (such as Pesniary) the artistic director was the band's leading member and songwriter, while in others he played the role of impresario. Soviet VIAs played a specific style of pop music. They performed youth-oriented (but officially approved) radio-friendly music, which combined contemporary Western and Soviet trends. Folk instruments were often used, and occasionally a keytar (a keyboard held like a guitar). Songs varied from pop ballads, dance-beat disco and new wave to mainstream rock (although bands avoided the \\"rock music\\" label until the late 1970s, because rock was considered \\"bourgeois\\" and formally banned). Many VIAs had up to ten members (including a number of vocalists and multi-instrumentalists), who were in frequent rotation. Due to state censorship, the lyrics of VIAs were family- friendly; typical topics were universal emotions like love, joy, and nostalgia, or idealized vignettes from daily life. Many bands also encouraged national culture and patriotism, (especially those of national minorities from the smaller Soviet republics) such as Yalla from Uzbekistan, Labyrinth from Georgia and Chervona Ruta from Ukraine. Folk-based VIAs such as Pesniary (later they mixed folk rock and progressive rock styles), Siabry and Verasy were especially popular in Belarus.‚ÄúPesnyary‚Äù ‚Äì Legends in Bell-Bottoms Russian bands from Moscow and Leningrad (such as Zemlyane and Tsvety) were more oriented towards Western pop and rock music. Many VIAs were created by musicians that played together in local choruses or musical theatrical productions. The earliest VIAs included Avangard (Avantgarde) in 1964, Poyushchiye Gitary (The Singing Guitars) in 1966, Vesyolye Rebyata (Jolly Fellows) in 1968, and Dobry Molodtsy (Good Guys) in 1969. Unique Characteristics The typical VIA consisted of 6 to 10 band members, with several singers and musicians capable of playing multiple instruments. Lead vocalists in VIAs usually did not play an instrument, but only sang. Virtually every member of a VIA was a professional musician with formal musical education and many years of performance experience. The Soviet government had strict rules governing how members of a VIA were to behave on stage and conduct themselves in public. Movement around the stage was discouraged. Musicians typically remained in one place as they played their instruments or sang. Anything outside of the conservative \\"norm\\", such as tattoos, leather jackets, or metallic accessories were forbidden. VIA song recordings were done by the State owned record company Melodiya (Melody). Concerts and performances were organized by professional associations such as Soyuzkontsert (Union Concerts), Moskontsert (Moscow Concerts), Lenkonsert (Leningrad Concerts), Roskontsert (Russian Concerts), and Goskontsert (Government Concerts), along with regional orchestra groups. At times, a VIA would collaborate with a well- known solo singer to provide musical backing. Examples include Yury Antonov and VIAs Araks and Aerobus, Alla Pugacheva and VIA Retsital, Sofia Rotaru and VIA Chervona Ruta, Valeriy Obodzinskiy and VIA Verniye Druziya, and Lev Leschenko and VIA Spektr. Repertoire VIAs typically performed songs written by professional composers and lyricists who were members in good standing of the Composers' Union and the Writers' Union in the former Soviet Union. Some songs were created by VIA members or the VIA's artistic director. In the early 1980s, there was an unspoken rule that at least 80% of a VIA's performance repertoire had to be songs written by union members. VIAs performed songs in a range of musical styles, including folk music, disco, rock, and synth-pop. Although tightly controlled by the government, VIAs had an enormous influence on the Russian public and created an audience for the rock music wave that followed. On the other hand, VIAs tended to deliver songs that were mainstream, simple in expression, and conservative in performance. Lyrics tended to focus on uncontroversial topics such as patriotic motifs, love stories, idealizations of work, light humor, ballads, current events, and folk themes. Any social criticism or protest was heavily censored and largely forbidden, except when directed against the West. A number of VIAs did cover versions of foreign hits, typically changing the lyrics to entirely different meanings, but matching the music and vocalization. At times, VIAs went so far as to claim that the music was their own original work. Rise and Fall VIAs as a movement in Soviet music existed for approximately two decades, from the mid-1960s until the mid-1980s. They were very popular, particularly among Soviet youth. The best known VIAs would perform year round, giving several concerts a day. Many of these concerts received television and radio air time. Their albums sold tens of millions of copies. Most VIAs dissolved in the late 1980s. This was in part due to rock music becoming more popular and the censorship apparatus largely falling apart. The advent of synthesizers, samplers, and other technologies that enabled the creation of music without the use of a large number of musicians was also a contributing factor. Finally, the lyrical content of VIA songs became far less relevant in the new, more open society. Although most VIAs disappeared, a number of VIA members enjoyed successful subsequent careers as solo performers or members of new bands. Many Russian pop and rock stars of the 1990s were VIA members in the 1970s and 1980s. A few of the most popular VIAs endured and continued to exist into the 1990s and thereafter, usually with a significantly different membership.

Orbanes and developed by Winning Moves Games USA in 1977. However, the game is no longer in production. It received the French Game of the Year Award for 2009. The game is based on Penrose tiling.  Gameplay  The game is played on a decagonal board, which contains the scoring pegs, and has a storage well for each of the four coloured sets of pieces. There are 80 total pieces divided into four identical sets of purple, red, green and yellow. 250px 360px The first player must place a piece inside, or touching, the center circle. Then, every piece played must touch the piece previously placed on the board. So, on a player's turn, they must place a piece so it touches the piece that was just played by the previous player. Players score points by completing circles and stars. If a player has majority of the five segments in the circle or star, they scores 10 points. A five point bonus is awarded to the player who completes the shape if they do not have majority in the shape. A player can earn a free turn ‚Äì play anywhere, in three ways: # If they complete the centre star # If they are the first player to use their silver piece # If they place a piece that is completely surrounded and there is no adjacent spot for the other players to play. Strategy * Each player has the same exact pieces. There are large pieces that cover three segments of a circle. If a player has the chance to play these, they have immediate majority and will score 10 points when the shape is completed. There are no pieces covering three segments in a star. * The smaller pieces like the arrow and wedge will come in very handy later in the game when trying to navigate out of tight spots. * Free turns can be very valuable, but if the game results in a tie, the winner is the player with the greatest number of pieces remaining. This means that it took fewer moves for that player to reach 40 points.

The Tripteroceratidae appeared almost simultaneously with the Oncoceratidae and Valcouroceratidae early in the Middle Ordovician, and are most likely derived from the Graciloceratidae.  Genera  The Tripteroceratdae includes five known genera, as briefly described. Tripteroceras, the type genus, named by Hyatt (1884) is characterized by a small, straight or slightly exogastric shell with a broad, depressed triangular cross section. The venter, underneath, is flat, the dorsum, above, broadly rounded with a median ridge or keel and lateral angles acute. (Sweet 1964). The siphuncle is small, ventral, and with segments that are only slightly expanded, and thought to be empty. Tripteroceras is known from North America and possibly Norway. Allumettoceras, from the Middle and Upper Ordovician of North America and northern Europe, is similar to Tripteroceras except the siphuncle which starts off suborthochoanitic becomes cyrtochoanitic with subspherical segments in the later growth stages. Allumettoceras was named by Foerste in 1926 Hadoceras, named by Strand in 1934, is a tripteroceratid with a broadly arched under side and more highly arched upper, respectively venter and dosum.

Always interested and involved in music, Bertarelli has continued to write songs. She recorded some of her songs for the UK-Swiss charity Smiling Children Foundation and Le Matin described her as having a \\"golden voice\\". Universal Music liked the songs and decided to sign her. The first single, \\"Don't Say\\", was released digitally through online stores on 9 December 2009. Her debut album Elusive was published on 15 January 2010, entering the Swiss charts in the 20th position. Throughout 2010, Bertarelli published two more singles in Switzerland (\\"Elusive\\" and \\"More Than Anything\\"). She also had several live performances, including the Montreux Jazz Festival and opening acts for Simply Red in Edinburgh and Z√ºrich. In 2011, a remix of her conservation song \\"Green\\" was chosen by the WWF to be their anthem to mark the Fund's 50th year of conservation at their annual Panda Ball. Bertarelli donated all proceeds from the single to WWF to support their ongoing conservation projects around the world. The song is included in the acoustic album Green, first released as an iTunes digital download in February 2012. Proceeds from the album are also being donated to the WWF, as part of her continuing support for the organization. 2011 saw the release of her single \\"Set Your Body Free\\", which included remixes from Loverush UK!, Jason van Wyk, Full Intention and Nova. In January 2012, Bertarelli signed a long-term exclusive music deal with Sony/ATV Music publishing and collaborated with world-renowned trance DJ Armin van Buuren. Van Buuren's remix of Kirsty's song \\"Twilight\\" was in dance charts for 9 weeks, peaking at No. 2 on Music Week's club chart. This collaboration has continued, with van Buuren producing Kirsty's new single \\"Free of War\\". Bertarelli then released her next album titled Love Is, which was partly recorded in Nashville, Tennessee. Her latest album, called Indigo Shores, was released on 12 May 2014 following her signing by Decca Records in the autumn of 2013.

The 7-track release was released to moderate critical acclaim for its diverse and experimental sound juxtaposed with pop- music sensibilities and has received positive reviews including an 8/10 from U&I; Music Magazine and a 4.8 rating on Sputnikmusic. Their song 'Queen Bee' was selected by musician George Barnett to be featured on Huw Stephens' BBC Introducing Show on BBC Radio One in October of that year. In August 2014 the band announced their intention to begin performing for the first time across the UK with possible new music to emerge in 2015. Little Ghost released a single on 15 June entitled 'Tiny Little Flicker'. Around this time they introduced three new songs into their live set, 'Tiny Little Flicker', 'Ladies And Gentlemen' and 'Carpe Diem Yourself'. On 14 September they released their debut album Versus. The album's release coincided with small UK tour with co- headliners City Of Ashes and A Mouth Full Of Matches.

Based on a true story, it tells how a teacher named Jakob Seel is arrested and thrown into a Soviet prison in 1938. Mann Munoz directed the film and Roberto Munoz produced. Jeff Stewart plays the lead role of Jakob Seel. The film also stars Christopher Elliott, Sal Rendino, Quentin McCuiston, Sean Patrick Folster, Matthew R. Staley, Chloe Roe, and Ken Jennings. The film is set in the Soviet Union prior to World War II. It features the lives of the ethnic minority Germans from Russia. Plot Jakob Seel (Jeff Stewart) struggles with his growing sense of worthlessness after he is dismissed from his position as a teacher in a Soviet village. A neighbor asks him to say a prayer at the funeral of her brother. He agrees, even though he knows it is illegal. Jakob is reported and he is arrested by the secret police later that night. They take him from his daughter and granddaughter, Marta (played by Chloe Roe). Thrown into prison, Jakob and his fellow political prisoners find themselves under the heel of the ruthless warden: Nikolai (played by Christopher Elliott). Unknown to them, Nikolai has an old vendetta against Jakob. One by one, during the night, prisoners mysteriously disappear. To help distract them from their terror of being taken, Jakob consents to the prisoners' request to form a choir. In doing so, he unexpectedly finds the sense of worth he had craved. As he rehearses the men, he gains their respect, especially that of the embittered prison bully, Bruno (Sal Rendino). Then one day, the man responsible for Jakob's arrest ‚Äî Oigen (Ken Jennings) - is also imprisoned. Now, Jakob faces the test of a lifetime ‚Äî to see if he's ready to forgive the unforgivable.

Staley as Karl * Peter Iasillo, Jr. as Vovik * Chloe Roe as Marta * Alexandra Tejeda Rieloff as Emma * Ken Jennings as Oigen * Horacio F. Lazo as Pepchik * Greg Kowalczyk as Rudi Based on a true story Under Jakob's Ladder was inspired by the life of a real teacher who lived in the Soviet Union in the 1930s: Jakob Seel. His life story is representative of so many others who lived during Stalinist great purges. He belonged to an ethnic minority called the Germans in Russia. During the 18th century, Seel's German-speaking ancestors were among those invited by Catherine the Great (and her son Paul and grandson Alexander who ruled after her) to settle the Russian territories. Communist rule was established as a result of the 1917 Russian Revolution, and Joseph Stalin came to power in the late 1920s. In the 1930s, Stalin began his political purges. The secret police would always come at night in a vehicle that was nicknamed the Black Raven. Men became scarce in the villages and it wasn't long before Seel himself was arrested‚Äîafter praying a simple prayer at a funeral.

The proboscis has 14 rows each of 6 hooks and 2 spines and the trunk has an anterior swelling. The apical hooks are the smallest; posterior hook largest, reaching up to 74 um. Hook and spine roots (when present) invariably simple, posteriorly directed, without manubria. Trunk spines markedly smaller, with variable distributionSpines on the trunk are only on the anterior side. *Acanthocephaloides cyrusi Bray, Spencer-Jones & Lewis, 1988 A. cyrusi has been found parasitizing the fish: Blackhand sole (Pegusa nasuta referred to by its synonym Solea bleekeri) and the Small- spotted grunter (Pomadasys commersonnii) in Lake St. Lucia, Natal, South Africa. It is distinguished from the other species in the genus Arhythmacanthidae by the more greater sexual dimorphism in length, differing arrangement of hooks, the proboscis with the longest hooks at the anterior- most part and the larger size of proboscis hooks and body spines. Specifically, the proboscis hook rows with 3 spines and 3 hooks that increase in size anteriorly. Apical hook reaches 83‚Äì101 or 118‚Äì137 um in length and has root with large, oblique, anterior manubrium. Posterior spines rootless. Whole trunk with regular transverse rows of uniform, acuminate, 13‚Äì22 um long spines. *Acanthocephaloides delamuri (Parukhin, 1989) Amin, 2013 *Acanthocephaloides distinctus Golvan, 1969 Found off Senegal. *Acanthocephaloides geneticus (Buron, Renaud & Euzet, 1985) Found off the Mediterranean coast of France. *Acanthocephaloides ichiharai Araki & Machida, 1987 Found off Japan. The proboscis has variable 13‚Äì14 (rarely 12 or 16) hook rows of 10‚Äì12 hooks/spines (9 hooks and 3 rootless spines in 1 specimen). Hook and spine roots (when present) invariably simple, posteriorly directed, without manubria with the apical hook being the smallest; posterior hook largest, and reaching up to 74 um. The trunk is cylindrical and has spines only on the anterior portion smaller than probiscus hooks and variable in their distribution. *Acanthocephaloides irregularis Amin, Oƒüuz, Heckman, Tepe & Kvach, 2011 A. irregularis is found parasitizing the Combtooth blenny (Parablennius zvonimiri) in the Gulf of Odessa, Ukraine, the Mushroom goby (Ponticola eurycephalus) in the Sukhyi Estuary, in the Black Sea, and the Tubenose goby (Proterorhinus marmoratus) and Black-striped pipefish (Syngnathus abaster) in both locations. The species is named for its irregular distribution of trunk spines. A. irregularis is most similar to its closest relative, A. propinquus in proboscis shape and armature as both have 12 longitudinal rows of 5 hooks each and the shape of the trunk, reproductive system and lemnisci. A. irregularis differs from A. propinquus in having randomly distributed trunk spines that are organised in circular rings of individual spines separated by aspinose zones. A. irregularis is also unique in having an anterior trunk collar, a very large triangular cephalic ganglion, nucleated pouches at the posterior end of the proboscis receptacle, and hooks and spines with roots bearing anterior manubria. It is the tenth species of the genus to be described.Amin, O. M., Oƒüuz, M. C., Heckmann, R. A., Tepe, Y., & Kvach, Y. (2011). Acanthocephaloides irregularis n. sp.

The proboscis has 12 ‚Äì 14 rows of hooks each comprising 5 or 6 hooks. The longest hooks were in the middle of the proboscis and the smallest basal hooks were unrooted and resembled spines. The lemnisci were longer than the proboscis sac, measuring between 312 and 350 ¬µm and between 312 ‚Äì 349 ¬µm long.

Milliken (2012). The sedimentary rock record of Mars: Distribution, origins, and global stratigraphy, SEPM Special Publication, 102, 1-48. Just to the south of McMurdo is a field of numerous short, dark streaks or fans. These are caused by the outgassing of carbon dioxide in the spring when the temperature is rising. The carbon dioxide gas carries with it dark particles. If a wind is blowing at the time, the plume of material is spread to one side forming a streak or a fan; these features have been called spiders because at times they look spiders with many legs. Both layers and fans are shown in the pictures below. Wikimcnurdo.jpgMcMurdo, as seen by CTX camera (on Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter). Wikimcnurdolayers.jpgShort dark streaks are dark fans caused by outgassing of carbon dioxide and dark material. Layers are easily visible in the wall of the crater.

It is bounded on the West by a former minerals railway line, to the South by social housing, the east by Holly Hayes Woodland, and to the North by an aggregate storage area, and have developed on soils derived from the clays of the Triassic Keuper Marl. The grassland is poorly drained and is dominated by tufted hair- grass Deschampsia caespitosa, Yorkshire fog Holcus lanatus, red fescue Festuca rubra and great burnet Sanguisorba officinalis. Additionally, flora typical of relatively basepoor clay soils, such as pignut Conopodium majus, betony Betonica officinalis, heath bedstraw Galium saxatile, tormentil Potentilla erecta, devil's-bit scabious Succisa pratensis, and mat grass Nardus stricta, are present. The grassland also includes typical meadow species as saw-wort Serratula tinctoria, meadow thistle Cirsium dissectum, knapweed Centaurea nigra and lady's smock Cardamine pratensis. In 2008, the site was bought by the Friends of Holly Hayes Wood who wanted to see the meadow land restored to its former glory. The group is working with Natural England to re-establish appropriate maintenance which it hoped will lead to a more appropriate 'favourable' status and to ensure that the meadow is meeting its conservation objectives.

She gets friendly with his daughter Pinky, who tells her that she would get her introduced to her uncle Velu, and they would make a good pair. It turns out that Velu studies in Anjali's college and soon after, they come to know each other and get close. Bose investigate the case of Umapathi, whom no one has been able to touch. He is even involved with a land deal involving crores of money which is completely illegal and others including the DIG is involved. When the chairman of the bank who has lent money for the deal demands the money back as the deal has not worked, Umapathi eliminates him. The people who are customers of the bank take to the streets and try to damage the bank. Bose arrives there, arrests the manager, and takes him away. Somehow, Umapathi comes to know where the manager has been taken. He arrives there with his men and the DIG and nearly kills Bose. Umapathi asks his men to dump the body. On the way, Velu gets involved and ultimately rescues Bose from a burning bus, and Bose dies in Velu's arms. The entire media and the people think Bose has swindled off all the money as they have been made to believe that by the DIG. Velu decides to take revenge on the people who killed his brother. Firstly he kills Dinesh (Hemanth), his friend and Umapathi's henchman. Then he kills the DIG (he had been taken to jail and he had escaped). Umapathi also kidnaps Velu's entire family. Velu goes to an old temple where he kills Umapathi. He spills the beans that Bose is dead, and he rescues his family under the supervision of the new DIG Gautham Ganesh (Prabhu), who supports him wholeheartedly.

The film was said to be titled as Maanja Madhan which proved untrue and it is changed as Maanja Velu. Suresh Gopi was initially selected to play the role of Arun's elder brother but he was replaced by another senior actor Karthik who made his comeback through this film. Dhansika, who was one of the five girls in Peraanmai has been selected to play the pair opposite hero making her first project as a solo heroine. First schedule of the film was started with song at Bangkok. The climax fight scenes of the film was canned in Ekkattuthangal Burma Colony Muneeswarar Temple, Chennai for last 5 days and it was shot using two outdoor units and four cameras, the set was built like that of a ruined temple with a 50 ft tall 'Aiyanaar' statue was erected at a whoping 65 lakhs. A scene featuring 400 junior artists and 25 stunt artists was canned in a festival set that was erected around the temple. A scene in which Arun Vijay kicking two fighters by jumping from a platform was being shot, for which both the fighters were tied on with a transparent nylon rope, to avoid accidents. Unexpectedly one of the nylon ropes got tangled with Arun Vijay's right arm while he was performing the action. Arun Vijay's elbow was badly injured due to the accident and the whole arm swell at once. Immediately the actor was offered first aid by the stunt master Kanal Kannan and was rushed to the hospital where he was offered emergency treatment, for this scene Arun tonsured his head to give a new look and also hanged upside down which was shot for 7 days. Songs were shot at Pazhani, Dindigul and Chennai. The title song of the film was shot in Pondicherry schedule with 80 junior artists. Few stunts were shot at Trichy and Stunt master Kanal Kannan has given 45 days of his schedule. Controversy Before the release, Dr. Kalidoss has stated that he had been in the film industry for the past 15 years and that he completed a film titled ‚ÄòThunichal‚Äô with Arun Vijay in the lead in the year 2008. He also stated that though the Censor Board had cleared the film, Arun Vijay had ‚Äòpurposely‚Äô delayed the release of the film by not completing his portion of the ‚Äòdubbing‚Äô work. As he had spent Rs.2 crores till date, the producer told Vijay that he couldn't continue to shoot the film. Meanwhile, he was asked by the actor to release Thunichal after his ‚ÄòMalai Malai‚Äô released. Due to his non-cooperation, instead of releasing ‚ÄòThunichal‚Äô in 160 theatres, I could release the film only in 16 theatres on 1 January this year, said Kalidoss. Due to this, I incurred a loss of Rs.1.5 crores, he added. \\"Due to the mental harassment I had to endure because of Arun Vijay, I couldn‚Äôt continue my profession as a doctor for the past 4 years. Vijay has to pay me Rs.1.5 crores and till he does so, the release of his ‚ÄòMaanja Velu‚Äô should be stayed till the 19th of this month,\\" he had stated in the petition Dr. Mohan, producer of ‚ÄòMaanja Velu‚Äô and father-in-law of Arun Vijay, had filed a counter petition with the Court praying for vacation of the stay on the grounds that he, as a producer, had nothing to do with Dr. Kalidoss‚Äô case and requested that as such, his film should be allowed to release on the stipulated date. Advocate G. Murugesh Kumar, who appeared on behalf of Dr. Mohan in the court of Mr. Justice T.S. Sivagnanam, managed to putforth his point of view strongly before the Judge and said that Dr. Kalidoss had ‚Äòwrongly informed‚Äô the Court in the matter. As soon as the Judge announced that he'd be giving the verdict based on the ‚Äòactual nature‚Äô of the case, Dr. Kalidoss is said to have ‚Äòwithdrawn‚Äô his petition from the Court. Following this, the Judge dismissed the petition and said that the film could release on 21 May as per its original schedule. Soundtrack The soundtrack is composed by Mani Sharma and he reused the tunes from the original film Lakshyam. Audio function was attended by Producers Council chief Rama Narayanan, secretary Sivasakthi pandian, director Shakthi Chidambaram, actors Karthik, Shaam, Jai, Sibiraj, Sundar C.. Critical response The soundtrack was released to generally positive reviews. Behindwoods said, \\"there is nothing in the album that will make it stand up for itself\\". Milliblog said, \\"getting 3 decent tracks in a masala potboiler soundtrack is a huge win indeed\\". Indiaglitz said, \\"Over all, the music of Maanja Velu will definitely be chart busters and the music will have a wide reach. Mani Sharma, has used the tunes of his hit songs in Telugu in this album, which would surely appeal even to the Tamil audience\\". Release The satellite rights of the film were sold to Kalaignar. The film was given an \\"A\\" certificate by the Indian Censor Board and released on 21 May 2010 alongside Magane En Marumagane, Kanakavel Kaaka, Kutti Pisasu, Kola Kolaya Mundhirika and Kutrapirivu. Reviews Sify said, \\"On the whole director Venkatesh has dished out an average run of the mill mass masala cocktail which is quite entertaining in the first half but fizzles out in the second half with a predictable long drawn out climax\\". Behindwoods said, \\"Maanja Velu is an entertainer that aims to satisfy all types of audiences and A. Venkatesh has managed to create a screenplay that takes care of all requirements. But, there is a feeling that the full potential of the script has not been realized. It is still a decent entertainer which can be watched especially for its wonderful casting\\". Times of India said, \\"The one thing that strikes you about Maanja Velu is what a talent house Tamil cinema has been. As you watch the parade of the seniors like Karthik, Prabhu, Vijaykumar and Vagai Chandrasekhar you feel glad that they came up with good, great, moving or simply lovable performances in the past. It does a lot to ease the heart burn caused by the so-called earthy cinema that we have been treated to for months and months now. Where you saw plenty of victims of circumstances on display, but so very lacking in angst that you came away from the movie without any emotional connect\\". Indiaglitz said, \\"A perfect one for those who love masala flicks\\". Chennaionline said, \\"Maanja Velu has all the ingredients of a masala flick but the problem is that it has no novelty or neatness to impress us\\". Top 10 cinema said, \\"The movie may have its reach amongst the commercial film lovers, who have no regards for logics\\". Box office The film has seen an above average opening with total collections running up to Rs. 18 lakhs and weekend collections at Rs. 3,38,177 in second week. After that, weekend saw Rs. 4,22,307 drawn in its favor with Rs. 26 lakhs over the last weeks. Rs. 1,76,967 was made by the film this weekend with Rs. 32 lakhs spanning over 3 weeks. Total collections in Chennai was Rs. 26 lakhs. Overall trade pundits declared the film as \\"decent hit\\" due to the medium budget it was produced on.

The first was a short coal and goods hauling railroad that ran between Oneida and Jamestown, Tennessee. It was prosperous during the 1920s, hauling coal and lumber and provided groceries and mail to residents along the O&W; in the remote gorges and hollows of Scott and Fentress counties. The line also provided a passenger service that at the time, was the most efficient way to travel. In the 1940s the Wolf Creek Dam project was a ray of hope for the O&W;, but World War II ended that hope and the project was lost along with the large investment made by the railroad's owners. Abandonment was announced in 1946, however the Jewell Ridge Mine purchased the railroad and held on to it until 1953 when abandonment was officially requested due to sagging business in the area. The last train operated on March 31, 1954. Local citizens opposed the railroad's abandonment, however the implementation of better highway and trucks were a considerable competitor, local citizens and former employees blamed poor management as the cause for abandonment. The second, Oneida & Western Transportation (OWTX), was a railroad with no track. In the 1970s, the Shamrock Coal Company was having trouble with its primary hauler, the Louisville & Nashville, unable to supply empty cars fast enough to meet demand. Increased haulage rates and inadequate maintenance made things more difficult for Shamrock. The coal company responded by buying its own cars and locomotives, built to L&N; specifications, in 1979. These were run as L&N-trains; by L&N; crews, but gave Shamrock lower rates for transportation and a guaranteed supply of trains/cars. The name Oneida and Western was resurrected for the attractive two-tone green trains. The coal was exclusively sold and hauled to a South Carolina Electric & Gas power plant in Wateree. After the L&N; was bought by CSX in 1987, and Shamrock was bought by Sun Coal in the same year, the changed situation rendered the dedicated O&W-trains; unnecessary. Sun Coal and CSX agreed to a new contract for \\"ordinary\\" trains, and the O&W-equipment; was sold.

Polish State Railways started passenger service trains PKP Pendolino operating a speed 200 km/h on 80 km line Olszamowice-Zawiercie (part of railway line called CMK, from Warsaw to Katowice/Krak√≥w). From December 2017 there are two 200 km/h sections, 136 km long in total.https://www.plk- sa.pl/biuro-prasowe/informacje-prasowe/siec-kolejowa-przejezdna-wdrozenie- rozkladu-zgodnie-z-planem-3560/https://www.plk- sa.pl/files/public/user_upload/pdf/Reg_przydzielania_tras/Regulamin_2017_2018/06.12.2017/N_ZAL_2.1P_20171206105414.pdf Polish state railways PKP launched the high-speed service under the Express Intercity Premium (EIP) brand name. PKP Intercity was initially using only nine sets a day to operate 23 EIP services from Warsaw to Gdynia, Krak√≥w, Katowice, and Wroc≈Çaw. Today most of the 20 units operate on the core Krak√≥w ‚Äì Warsaw ‚Äì Gda≈Ñsk ‚Äì Gdynia route, running hourly at peak times and every 2 h off-peak. The (Gliwice/Bielsko-Bia≈Ça - Katowice - Warsaw - Gda≈Ñsk - Gdynia route is operated five times a day. There are two Pendolinos each way per day on the Wroc≈Çaw route. Headline journey times are 2 h 58 min from Warsaw to Gda≈Ñsk, 2 h 28 min to Krak√≥w and 2 h 34 min to Katowice. EIP services from Warsaw to Wroc≈Çaw run via the CMK trunk line, Czƒôstochowa and Opole, taking 3 h 42 min against up to 6 h for the previous route via Pozna≈Ñ. In addition to the Central Rail Line from Warsaw to Krak√≥w and Katowice, and from Warsaw to Wroc≈Çaw, the Pendolinos also operate on the 350 km (221 miles) route from Warsaw to Gda≈Ñsk and Gdynia on the Baltic Sea. In 2011-2015 the Warsaw-Gda≈Ñsk- Gdynia route is undergoing a major upgrading costing $3 billion, partly funded by the European Investment Bank, including track replacement, realignment of curves and relocation of sections of track to allow speeds up to , modernization of stations, and installation of European Train Control System Level 2, which is to be completed in June 2015. When Pendolino services started on 14 December 2014 the previous Warsaw-Gda≈Ñsk rail travel time of 4¬Ω to 6 hours was reduced to 2 hours 58 minutes by Pendolino, and will be reduced further to 2 hours 40 minutes when upgrading is completed.'Pendolino z Tr√≥jmiasta do Warszawy,' http://www.trojmiasto.pl/wiadomosci/Pendolino-z- Trojmiasta-do-Warszawy-Wiecej-pytan-niz-odpowiedzi-n71010.html Previous proposals Historically, there have been many proposals and plans put in place by several Polish governments and/or interest groups seeking to introduce high-speed rail to Poland. As of December 2009, Poland had 700‚Äì800 km of railways suited for rail transport reaching 160 km/h. An additional 1,500 km are expected by 2015, including some sections allowing 200 km/h. While previously the Polish government had invested primarily in Poland's road network, from 2012 onwards it will shift its focus toward development of rail transport. The government hopes to link Poland's twelve largest cities by high-speed rail by 2020. Several sections of the Central Trunk Line currently permit speeds of 200 km/h (with a current speed record in Poland of 293 km/h) however only 160 km/h was used in commercial service. Polish Railways planned to buy Pendolino trains in 1998 but the contract was cancelled in the following year by the Supreme Control Chamber due to financial losses by Polish Railways. Warsaw to Pozna≈Ñ and Wroc≈Çaw via ≈Å√≥d≈∫ There are plans for a \\"Y\\" line that would have connected Warsaw‚Äì≈Å√≥d≈∫‚ÄìKalisz. The line would then have split into two branches to Wroc≈Çaw and Pozna≈Ñ. The geometric layout of the line was planned to permit speeds of 360 km/h. Construction had been planned to begin around 2014 and finish in 2019. In April 2010, the tender for a feasibility study was awarded to a consortium led by Spanish company Ingenieria IDOM. The feasibility study was granted ‚Ç¨80 million in subsidy from the European Union. The total cost of the line including construction and train sets was estimated at ‚Ç¨6.9 billion and was planned to be partially financed by EU subsidies. In the center of the city of ≈Å√≥d≈∫ the \\"Y\\" line would have traveled through a tunnel which would have linked two existing railway stations. One of them: ≈Å√≥d≈∫ Fabryczna would have been reconstructed as an underground station (construction contract was signed on 18 August 2011). However, the \\"Y\\" line project was cancelled in 2011 due to insufficient funding. As for February 2017 the project is still a subject of public debate only. However the central hub of \\"Y\\" line (the ≈Å√≥d≈∫ Fabryczna underground station) is completed. Upgraded lines The Central Rail Line (CMK) Warsaw - Krak√≥w/Katowice was originally built to geometry appropriate for speeds up to 250 km/h, and only requires suitable signalling equipment to be fitted and some amount of modernisation works. ETCS Level 1 allowed trains to reach 200 km/h in 2014 on part of the line and a further upgrade for 230 km/h is planned. Reconstruction work has started on the Warsaw‚ÄìGda≈Ñsk line to allow speeds up to 200 km/h for tilting trains. This initially allows trains to run to ETCS Level 1 standards with a commitment but no timetable for further upgrades to ETCS Level 2 standards. Rolling stock A PKP Intercity ED250 Pendolino The seven-car Class ED250 trainsets have been supplied by Alstom Transport. Each set has seats for 57 first class and 345 second class passengers, with a buffet/bar and three four-seat business or family compartments. Polish state railways PKP originally ordered 14 Pendolinos in 1998, but the order was cancelled in 2000 due to a shortage of funds. In 2010 Alstom won a PKP Intercity tender for high-speed trains with an offer of 20 New Pendolino trains. Similarly to the CRH5, these are non-tilting. Like the ƒåD class 680 the trains will be equipped to work on , and 3 kV DC, and thus able to operate in Poland, Germany, Austria and the Czech Republic.RailwayGazette: Alstom sole bidder in Polish high speed train tender On 30 May 2011 the Polish state railways PKP signed an agreement with Alstom for 20 Pendolinos ETR 610 for delivery in 2014.Railway Gazette International, 31 May 2011, 'PKP Intercity signs Pendolino Contract,' http://www.railwaygazette.com/news/passenger/single-view/view/pkp-intercity- signs-pendolino-contract.htmlGazeta Krakowska http://www.gazetakrakowska.pl/aktualnosci/409707,pkp-intercity- zamawia-20-pociagow-new-pendolino,id,t.html The first Pendolino was delivered on August 12, 2013.'The first Pendolino (EIC Premium) is already in Poland,' Alstom Press Release http://www.alstom.com/press-centre/?taxgroup=8589951408 The Pendolinos were to operate on the high-speed CMK Central Rail Line from Krak√≥w/Katowice to Warsaw, and on the routes from Gdynia to Warsaw and from Wroc≈Çaw to Warsaw.Railway Gazette International, 8 December 2011, Polish high speed rail project cancelled, http://www.railwaygazette.com/news/infrastructure/single-view/view/polish- high-speed-rail-project-cancelled.html High-speed tests using the new Pendolino ED250 on the CMK Central Rail Line began in November 2013.

The tests had not been performed by May, and PKP announced that Alstom had failed to meet the contract terms and would be charged penalties as of May 6.http://www.kurierkolejowy.eu/aktualnosci/19371/Pendolino-bez-homologacji-Od- jutra-beda-kary.html Alstom responded that homologation in Poland at 250 km/h using ETCS Level 2 was impossible, since ETCS Level 2 was not operational anywhere in Poland, and the Central Rail Line (Poland) where the first ED250 Pendolino had reached 293 km/h in testing was equipped with ETCS Level 1, not Level 2.Railway Gazette International, 23 Dec 2013, 'First ETCS Certified in Poland,' http://www.railwaygazette.com/news/infrastructure/single- view/view/first-etcs-certified-in-poland.html On 26 June 2014 a compromise was reached between PKP and Alstom under which the Pendolinos would be delivered under a two-stage homologation, first homologated for operation using ETCS Level 1 and eventually to be homologated for ETCS Level 2. Pendolinos were put in service on 14 December 2014.'Jest porozumienie PKP w sprawie Pendolino, ruszy przed ≈õwiƒôtami, http://www.polskieradio.pl/42/273/Artykul/1161766,Jest- porozumienie-PKP-w-sprawie-Pendolino-ruszy-14-grudnia'End of Pendolino Dispute,' http://www6.lexisnexis.com/publisher/EndUser?Action=UserDisplayFullDocument&orgId;=1746&topicId;=100410004&docId;=l:2152514833&Em;=7&start;=4  Operational status  Other loco-hauled services branded EIC (Express InterCity) will be switched to EIP (Express Intercity Premium) operation over the coming months, with the eventual plan envisaging 17 Pendolinos in traffic, one spare and two for maintenance. All 20 trains have now been completed, with the final set being delivered to Poland at the beginning of December. However, the first unit which was used for testing and commissioning has been returned to Savigliano for retrofitting before entering revenue service. As well as 3 kV DC for operation in Poland, the Pendolinos are equipped with 15 kV 16‚Öî Hz and 25 kV 50 Hz and the train control systems needed to run in Germany, Austria and the Czech Republic. However, certification for international operation is not seen as a priority, as the trains are restricted to domestic services for an initial 10 years under the terms of a grant from the EU Cohesion Fund which covered 22% of the project cost. Alstom expects to employ around 130 people at the Groch√≥w maintenance depot, which has three covered tracks for servicing and two for maintenance. The company is using its TrainTracer health monitoring and diagnostics systems to manage the fleet, ensuring that sufficient trainsets are available for the operator. Some sets are stabled overnight at the outer termini, and cycled through the depot as required. The fleet management and pit-stop maintenance regime has been developed using experience in maintaining the Virgin West Coast Pendolino fleet in the UK, with many staff being trained in Manchester.

Composition and Geology View from the L√ºneburg Kalkberg at sunset The Kalkberg is made up largely of gypsum (calcium sulphate) and comes from sediments that were deposited there around 250 million years ago by the Zechstein Sea. More recently (in geological terms), smaller disturbances have allowed the less dense Zechstein salts to flow together and force their way upwards into the younger, overlying rocks. Today these salts are near the earth's surface. Through this process, the more geologically-recent layers of rock around the rising mass of salt were deformed, shattered, and lifted; the initially horizontally-lying layers of salt were tilted and folded as they were rose upwards. Near the surface, the resulting salt dome was leached by groundwater, so that only the less readily- soluble elements remained behind, such as carbonates and sulphates. These are the compounds that make up the Kalkberg today, and can also be seen to protrude through the surface around L√ºneburg. Today, the rock walls only have very sparse vegetation, attracting animals and plants typical of dry grassland habitats. On an area of , one can find over 180 species of flowering plants, including several warmth-, light-, and chalk-loving types that otherwise grow only in south-central Europe. Several small caves are inhabited by bats. History Until February 1371, a castle stood on top of the Kalkberg from where the Principality of L√ºneburg-Brunswick was governed. During the L√ºneburg War of Succession, the castle on the Kalkberg was destroyed along with the nearby monastery. The bulk of the Kalkberg has been quarried away over the centuries in order to use the gypsum as a building material. The former quarry is still recognizable from its steep, rugged walls. As a result of the depletion of the salt deposits and the increasing anhydrite content of the gypsum, the quarry was closed in 1923. Of particular geological interest are deposits of boracite and l√ºneburgite. Other minerals present include anhydrite, calcite, gypsum, halite, hematite, hydroglauberite, jarosite, kalistronite, lepidocrocite, pyrite, quartz, sylvite, syngenite and thenardite. The Kalkberg still has a height of 56.3 m above sea level. Originally it was about 80 m high. The L√ºneburg surveyor Eduard Schl√∂bcke helped turn the Kalkberg into one of the first German nature reserves in 1932.

The film is co-produced by Alshaibi's wife Kristie Alshaibi and co-executive produced by Studs Terkel.  Plot In January 2004, shortly after officially becoming an American citizen, the Iraqi-born filmmaker Usama Alshaibi travels to Baghdad to visit the family he hasn't seen in over two decades. He makes the trip with his wife, Kristie, in tow. Although Saddam Hussein had been captured by American forces in December, Baghdad is in a state of extreme turmoil with massive explosions a daily, frightening occurrence. Yet, Usama and Kristie are surprised by his family's nonchalance at the chaos. When a bomb blows up and rocks the entire house, Usama's cousin Tareef refers to the explosive device as a \\"nice bomb,\\" hence the film's title.  Release  Nice Bombs made its World Premiere at the 2006 Chicago Underground Film Festival where it won the Best Documentary award, which was especially fitting since Alshaibi has worked as a filmmaker primarily out of Chicago. Nice Bombs was theatrically released in New York at Two Boots Pioneer Theater and Chicago at the Gene Siskel Film Center. The film also screened at the 2007 New York Underground Film Festival and made its broadcast debut on the Sundance Channel in March 2008.

Portals is currently the lowest-level network programming interface on the commercially successful XT line of supercomputers from Cray.  Overview  Portals is based on the concept of elementary building blocks that can be combined to support a wide variety of upper-level network transport semantics. Portals provides one-sided data movement operations, but unlike other one-sided programming interfaces, the target of a remote operation is not a virtual address. Instead, the ultimate destination in memory of an incoming message is determined at the receiver by comparing contents of the message header with the contents of structures at the destination. This flexibility allows for efficient implementations of both one-sided and two-sided communications. In particular, Portals is aimed at providing the fundamental operations necessary to support a high-performance and scalable implementation of the Message Passing Interface (MPI) standard. It was also used as the initial network transport layer for the Lustre file system.  Early years  Portals began in the early 1990s as an extension to the nX message passing system used in the SUNMOS and Puma operating system. It was first implemented for the Intel Paragon at Sandia, and later ported to the Intel TeraFLOPS machine named ASCI Red. There were four building blocks in the first version of Portals: the single block, the dynamic block, the independent block and the combined block. All incoming messages would first pass through a match-list that allowed individual portals to respond to specific groups, ranks, and a set of user specified match-bits.  Portals 3  The Portals concept continued to evolve over successive generations of lightweight kernels and massively parallel systems. In 1999, an operational programming interface was given to Portals so that it could be implemented for intelligent or programmable network interfaces outside of a lightweight kernel environment. This standard was designed for systems where the work required to prepare, transmit, and deliver messages is longer than the round-trip to the Portals data structures. For example, in modern systems, this work is dominated by the round-trip through the IO bus to the network interface. The standard has been revised since the initial release to make it more suited for modern high performance, massively parallel computers. The MPI library was ported from the retronymed Portals 2 to the new Portals 3.0. The Portals 3 specification has been implemented several times, first on ASCI Red, then on CPlant over Myrinet, Linux and the Cray XT family.  Portals 4  In light of emerging partitioned global address space (PGAS) languages, several new features have been added to the Portals API as part of Portals 4. Portals 4 also made several changes to improve the interaction between the processor and network interface (NIC) for implementations that provide offload. Finally, an option to support a form of flow-control was added to Portals 4. Portals 4 is the low-level networking API for the Bull-Atos BXI NIC.

Lokanath * Mysore Anand * Suresh Rrai Production=Development Speaking on a talk show, Weekend with Ramesh in 2014, on how he developed the story for Om, Upendra said he wrote a part of the story during his days in college in the late-1980s. Purushottam, a friend of Upendra, brought to him a letter written by someone that caught his attention. Drawing inspiration from it, he drafted the first part of the story, that he subsequently developed, although incompletely. He also revealed that had always wanted make a film on organized crime and mafia, based on real-life incidents. He said he was \\"disappointed\\" on learning that the screenplay of 1989 film Siva had a similar storyline to what he had written. He began working as a dialogue writer and songwriter in Kannada cinema during the time, and the first half of the 1990s saw him direct two films, Tharle Nan Maga (1992) and Shhh! (1993). Alongside, he developed the storyline and wrote a screenplay with the plot taking sequences of flashback, which he said \\"took another form\\" at the end of completion. Casting Having given the film a working title as Satya, Upendra initially decided to cast Kumar Govind as the eponymous lead, who he had previously collaborated with, in Shhh!. However, later, eager to cast Shiva Rajkumar in the role, Upendra approached actor Honnavalli Krishna in 1994, and persuaded him to speak the matter over to Shiva's father and actor, Rajkumar. Krishna spoke to S. P. Varadappa, Rajkumar's brother, who invited Upendra and him over to their house in Bangalore. Impressed by the story narrated by Upendra in a span of ten minutes using newspaper cuttings of oil mafia to elaborate on the subject, Rajkumar gave the go-ahead and Shiva was signed as the male lead. Rajkumar also agreed to produce the film and handed an amount of 50,000 over to Upendra the same day. Shiva had till then portrayed roles predominantly of a romantic hero in his then career of 8 years. Speaking on casting him, Upendra said he was drawn by Shiva's \\"powerful brownish-shaded eyes\\" and wanted to \\"make full use of it\\". Many actresses had been speculated to play the role of the female lead Madhuri, in the film, including then popular Hindi film actress Juhi Chawla. Finally, on Rajkumar's approval, Prema, a newcomer then, who was already filming with Shiva in Savyasachi, was cast in the role. Real-life gangsters Bekkinakannu Rajendra, Korangu Krishna, Tanveer Ahmad and Jedarahalli Krishna made cameo appearances in the film. Filming The principal photography began on 7 December 1994 in Bangalore. On the day, Rajkumar wrote the spiritual icon \\"‡•ê\\" on the film's screenplay material using kumkuma, which was later made the title design for the film. B. C. Gowrishankar who handled cinematography used a warm, yellow tone and employed filters throughout the film to diffuse the violence and the colour of the blood. Soundtrack Hamsalekha composed the film score and the film's soundtrack, also writing its lyrics. In September 2015, the rights for the soundtrack album was acquired by Sony Music Entertainment, and was released digitally.

David McCallum plays a comedic role as the \\"Jackal\\" an opportunistic drifter who uses the emergency system as a personal taxi service to allow him to feed his drug habit and get out of trouble. Turhan Bey came out of an over forty year absence from film acting to play an elderly man confined to a nursing home who provides the main character reason to carry on in an incredibly demanding job.

This tournament is an ice hockey tournament held annually for midget aged players in Richmond, British Columbia, Canada. The Tournament is held at the two Richmond arenas under the auspices of Richmond Minor Hockey Association and is sanctioned by Hockey Canada. The tournament gets underway every year starting on Boxing Day, and concludes on New Year's Eve, with the Elite Division and AAA Division Championship games being played at Minoru Arena. The tournament features 60 teams and approximately 170 games with more than eleven hundred participants, aged 15 ‚Äì 18, from across Canada, the United States and Europe. Each team is guaranteed to play at least five (5) games with 3 - 20 minute stop time periods. All proceeds from this Tournament go directly to the Richmond Minor Midget Hockey Scholarship Program. We do not charge an entrance fee, so we ask that spectators support our 50/50 draws, raffle and program sales. In 2008, the AAA Gold final game proved to be one of the highlights of the tournament, seeing the two local teams from Richmond BC, Richmond Minor Hockey Associations and Seafair Minor Hockey Association, playing off against each other for the title. The AAA Gold game was played before a sold out crowd of more than 1600 fans that left standing room only at the Minoru Arena. The Seafair Islanders won the Championship 5-2. In 2008, the British Columbia Junior Hockey League joined as a sponsor of the tournament. The BCHL schedules a regular league game to be played during our tournament. The inaugural game featured the Surrey Eagles and the Powell River Kings. This Junior A game was a big hit with the players of our tournament as the two teams played to a crowd of more than 1300 fans. The game was played in true Junior A fashion, with end to end action. overtime and all. Tournament History The tournament began in 1980 as a B tournament with 10 teams participating. In 1992, after the completion of the Richmond Ice Centre, the tournament expanded the B division to a AA/B division with 20 participating teams and added the AAA division with 20 participating teams. In 2004, the Elite AAA division was added and the tournament size grew again with a total of 60 teams participating in all three divisions. Tournament Format *\\"Elite AAA\\" Division consists of 12 teams, 2 pools of 6 teams. :The format sees the top 4 teams from Each Pool proceed to playoff format. (1 vs 4 and 2 vs 3 from the opposite pool). :The 5th and 6th place teams in their pools will play a Consolation game with a team from the other pool. *\\"AAA\\" Division consists of 28 teams, 4 pools of 7 teams. *\\"AA/B\\" Division consists of 20 teams, 4 pools of 5 teams. The format is set up as a flight series, allowing more teams to advance into the playoffs. :Gold Flight - the 1st and 2nd place teams in each pool will advance to a Quarter final in the Gold Flight. The winning teams from the Quarter finals advance into a Semi-Final and the winning teams from the Semi-final advance into the Gold Final. :Silver Flight - the 3rd and 4th place teams in each pool will advance to a quarter final in the Silver Flight.

It was a follow-on from Cisco's earlier CLEO router in space on the UK-DMC satellite. The Cisco Space Router was launched to geostationary orbit on board Intelsat 14 (IS-14), a spacecraft built by Space Systems/Loral for satellite operator Intelsat, in November 2009. IRIS was evaluated by the United States Department of Defense by way of a JCTD (Joint Capabilities Technology Demonstration). The Space Router runs Cisco IOS (Internetworking Operating System) software and also contains an onboard Software-defined radio running satellite modem waveforms. The United States Department of Defense used the JCTD to evaluate the reduced latency, improved throughput and increased flexibility provided by the Space Router.Assessment of the Internet Protocol Routing in Space - Joint Capability Technical Demonstration, E. Cuevas, H. Esiely-Barrera, H. Warren Kim and Z. Tang, Johns Hopkins APL Technical Digest, vol. 30 no. 2, 2011. The Space Router provided the ability to route Internet Protocol computer network traffic on board the satellite, which enabled users of Web, VoIP, and other IP applications to directly communicate without having to double-hop data to and from an intermediate Earth station. The ability to avoid the double-hop to the Earth station can reduce latency, which is approximately 250 ms for GEO satellites. Latency reduction is a key driver for increased use of real-time applications, including video teleconferencing, over satellites. The avoidance of the double-hop to the Earth station can also reduce satellite transponder costs.

Pictured is mint, along with some other herbs. In general use, herbs are plants with savory or aromatic properties that are used for flavoring and garnishing food, for medicinal purposes, or for fragrances; excluding vegetables and other plants consumed for macronutrients. Culinary use typically distinguishes herbs from spices. Herbs generally refers to the leafy green or flowering parts of a plant (either fresh or dried), while spices are usually dried and produced from other parts of the plant, including seeds, bark, roots and fruits. Herbs have a variety of uses including culinary, medicinal, and in some cases, spiritual. General usage of the term \\"herb\\" differs between culinary herbs and medicinal herbs; in medicinal or spiritual use, any parts of the plant might be considered as \\"herbs\\", including leaves, roots, flowers, seeds, root bark, inner bark (and cambium), resin and pericarp. The word \\"herb\\" is pronounced in Commonwealth English, but is common among North American English speakers and those from other regions where h-dropping occurs. In botany, the word \\"herb\\" is used as a synonym for \\"herbaceous plant\\". Definition Herb garden at Hardwick Hall, Derbyshire, England, originally planted in the 1870s by Lady Louisa Egerton, recreated by the National Trust, largely following the original design. In botany, the term herb refers to a herbaceous plant, defined as a small, seed-bearing plant without a woody stem in which all aerial parts (i.e. above ground) die back to the ground at the end of each growing season. Usually the term refers to perennials, although herbaceous plants can also be annuals (where the plant dies at the end of the growing season and grows back from seed next year), or biennials. This term is in contrast to shrubs and trees which possess a woody stem. Shrubs and trees are also defined in terms of size, where shrubs are less than ten meters tall, and trees may grow over ten meters. The word herbaceous is derived from Latin herbƒÅceus meaning \\"grassy\\", from herba \\"grass, herb\\". Another sense of the term herb can refer to a much larger range of plants, with culinary, therapeutic or other uses. For example, some of the most commonly described herbs such as sage, rosemary and lavender would be excluded from the botanical definition of a herb as they do not die down each year, and they possess woody stems. In the wider sense, herbs may be herbaceous perennials but also trees, subshrubs, shrubs, annuals, lianas, ferns, mosses, algae, lichens, and fungi. Herbalism can utilize not just stems and leaves but also fruit, roots, bark and gums. Therefore, one suggested definition of a herb is a plant which is of use to humans, although this definition is problematic since it could cover a great many plants that are not commonly described as herbs. Ancient Greek philosopher Theophrastus divided the plant world into trees, shrubs, and herbs. Herbs came to be considered in three groups, namely pot herbs (e.g. onions), sweet herbs (e.g. thyme), and salad herbs (e.g. wild celery). During the seventeenth century as selective breeding changed the plants size and flavor away from the wild plant, pot herbs began to be referred to as vegetables as they were no longer considered only suitable for the pot.  Culinary herbs  thyme (Thymus) Culinary herbs are distinguished from vegetables in that, like spices, they are used in small amounts and provide flavor rather than substance to food. Herbs can be perennials such as thyme, sage or lavender, biennials such as parsley, or annuals like basil. Perennial herbs can be shrubs such as rosemary (Rosmarinus officinalis), or trees such as bay laurel (Laurus nobilis) ‚Äì this contrasts with botanical herbs, which by definition cannot be woody plants. Some plants are used as both herbs and spices, such as dill weed and dill seed or coriander leaves and seeds. There are also some herbs, such as those in the mint family, that are used for both culinary and medicinal purposes. Emperor Charlemagne (742‚Äì814) compiled a list of 74 different herbs that were to be planted in his gardens. The connection between herbs and health is important already in the European Middle Ages--The Forme of Cury (that is, \\"cookery\\") promotes extensive use of herbs, including in salads, and claims in its preface \\"the assent and advisement of the masters of physic and philosophy in the King's Court\\". Herbal teas Some herbs can be infused in boiling water to make herbal teas (also termed tisanes). Typically the dried leaves, flowers or seeds are used, or fresh herbs are used. Herbal teas tend to be made from aromatic herbs, may not contain tannins or caffeine, and are not typically mixed with milk. Common examples include chamomile tea, or mint tea. Herbal teas are often used as a source of relaxation or can be associated with rituals.  Medicinal herbs  Nicholas Culpeper was an English botanist, herbalist, physician, and astrologer.Patrick Curry: \\"Culpeper, Nicholas (1616‚Äì1654)\\", Oxford Dictionary of National Biography (Oxford, UK: OUP, 2004) (etching by Richard Gaywood between 1644 and 1662) Herbs were used in prehistoric medicine. As far back as 5000 BCE, evidence that Sumerians used herbs in medicine was inscribed on cuneiform. In 162 CE, the physician Galen was known for concocting complicated herbal remedies that contained up to 100 ingredients. Some plants contain phytochemicals that have effects on the body. There may be some effects when consumed in the small levels that typify culinary \\"spicing\\", and some herbs are toxic in larger quantities. For instance, some types of herbal extract, such as the extract of St. John's-wort (Hypericum perforatum) or of kava (Piper methysticum) can be used for medical purposes to relieve depression and stress. However, large amounts of these herbs may lead to toxic overload that may involve complications, some of a serious nature, and should be used with caution. Complications can also arise when being taken with some prescription medicines. Herbs have long been used as the basis of traditional Chinese herbal medicine, with usage dating as far back as the first century CE and far before. In India, the Ayurveda medicinal system is based on herbs. Medicinal use of herbs in Western cultures has its roots in the Hippocratic (Greek) elemental healing system, based on a quaternary elemental healing metaphor. Famous herbalist of the Western tradition include Avicenna (Persian), Galen (Roman), Paracelsus (German Swiss), Culpepper (English) and the botanically inclined Eclectic physicians of 19th century/early 20th century America (John Milton Scudder, Harvey Wickes Felter, John Uri Lloyd). Modern pharmaceuticals had their origins in crude herbal medicines, and to this day, some drugs are still extracted as fractionate/isolate compounds from raw herbs and then purified to meet pharmaceutical standards. There is a record dated 1226 for '12d for Roses for Baron's Chamber and in 1516 for flowers and rushes for chambers for henry the 9th Certain herbs contain psychoactive properties that have been used for both religious and recreational purposes by humans since the early Holocene era, notably the leaves and extracts of the cannabis and coca plants. The leaves of the coca plant have been chewed by people in northern Peruvian societies for over 8,000 years, while the use of cannabis as a psychoactive substance dates back to the first century CE in China and northern Africa. Indigenous Australian peoples developed \\"bush medicine\\" based on plants that were readily available to them. The isolation of these groups meant the remedies developed were for far less serious diseases than the western illnesses they contracted during colonisation. Herbs such as river mint, wattle and eucalyptus were used for coughs, diarrhea, fever and headaches.  Sacred herbs  Commiphora gileadensis (Gilead myrrh) Herbs are used in many religions. During the monastic era, monks would cultivate herbs alongside vegetables, while others would be set aside in a physic garden for specific purposes. For example, myrrh (Commiphora myrrha) and frankincense (Boswellia species) in Hellenistic religion, the nine herbs charm in Anglo- Saxon paganism, neem (Azadirachta indica) leaves, bael (Aegele marmelos) leaves, holy basil or tulsi (Ocimum tenuiflorum), turmeric or \\"haldi\\" (Curcuma longa), cannabis in Hinduism, and white sage in Wicca. Rastafari also consider cannabis to be a holy plant. Siberian shamans also used herbs for spiritual purposes. Plants may be used to induce spiritual experiences for rites of passage, such as vision quests in some Native American cultures. The Cherokee Native Americans use both white sage and cedar for spiritual cleansing and smudging.  Herbal cosmetics  Originally there was always doubt in ancient societies, especially in the sceptical medium of western traditions, as to the efficacity of herbal medicines. The use of herbal cosmetics dates back to around six centuries ago in the European and Western countries. Mixtures and pastes were often concocted to whiten the face. During the 1940s, herbal cosmetics took a turn with the emerging red lipstick color, with every year gaining a more intense red. Herbal cosmetics come in many forms, such as face creams, scrubs, lipstick, natural fragrances, powders, body oils, deodorants and sunscreens. They activate through the epithelium of sebaceous glands to make the skin more supple. Ayurvedic oils are widely used in India, prized for their natural health-giving properties. One method and perhaps the best, used to extract natural oils from herbs to make lipstick is partition chromatography. The process involves separation in watery solution, and then the injection of colour under pressure. Strewing herbs Strewing herbs are scattered (strewn) over the floors of dwelling places and other buildings. Such plants usually have fragrant or astringent smells, and many also serve as insecticides (e.g. to repel fleas) or disinfectants. For example, meadowsweet (Filipendula ulmaria) was sometimes strewn across floors in the middle ages because of its sweet smell.

House bill H.R. 2872 was introduced by Congressman Artur Davis (D-AL) and cosponsored by Representatives Steve Israel (D-NY) and Mary Jo Kilroy (D-OH). The Quality Cancer Care Demonstration (QCCD) project was developed by community oncologists, with input from policy experts, to be a national Medicare demonstration project focused on two key aspects of cancer care: treatment planning and end-of-life care. Treatment planning involves all of the essential components of establishing the cancer care plan and monitoring its effectiveness. End-of-life care involves all of the essential components of patient-centric cancer care relating to individuals facing end-of-life planning and decisions. H.R. 2872 calls for national reporting, via the Medicare payment system, of key metrics of evidence based care, refinement of those metrics, and development of a new Medicare performance-based reimbursement system that is patient-centric and quality driven, while aligning better with parameters of cost control. The bill includes the following elements: * Establish a national Medicare demonstration project implemented by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) and open to all oncology practices. * Address current shortcomings in treatment planning and end-of-life care by improving metrics and aligning incentives relating to that care. * Having oncologists to report (through the Medicare reimbursement system) quality measures concerning their treatment plans and end-of-life care. It would include refinement and improvement of those plans. * Allocate $300 million per year in Medicare funding to revise the Medicare payment system. Those payments would be based on quality and cost-efficiency. * Incorporate the key elements under discussion in the healthcare reform debate ‚Äî quality care delivery, evidence-based medicine, care coordination, patient- centric, cost control, health information technology, and pay-for-performance ‚Äî in producing an evolved payment system. * Evaluation of QCCD to determine participation of oncologists and cost effectiveness of the plan. * Conducting of the demonstration project over a period of not less than two years to allow for improvement of reporting, metrics, and analysis. * A substantive project that can be implemented within 6 months by CMS and be available to all oncologists nationwide. * Could serve as a model for other areas of specific care relating to terminal illness for Medicare beneficiaries.

She was one of the first African Americans to earn a PhD in Library Science and became dean of Atlanta University's School of Library Sciences. Early life Virginia Lacy was born to Edward and Ellen Lacy in Cincinnati, Ohio on June 25, 1912. She spent much of her childhood in Clarksburg, West Virginia. She recalled that growing up her family was \\"poor, hardworking, proud, and ambitious.\\" She said that books and reading were always a part of her home life. She and her mother made frequent trips to the public library in Clarksburg, which was not segregated. In 1927, Jones moved to St. Louis, Missouri to live with an aunt and uncle. The move could have facilitated the path to a virtually expense-free college education through the Harris Teachers College as she desperately wanted to further her education, but her family was not able to afford it. She entered Sumner High School, where her uncle taught, and completed her final two years of school in 1929. It was while in high school that Jones realized the possibility that librarianship would be a part of her future. It was an experience at the St. Louis Public Library that inspired her most. She was researching information for her church's citywide essay contest on \\"The Values of Attending Sunday School\\" when she encountered a friendly reference librarian. She remembers that after telling this librarian what she was looking for, the librarian showed her how to use the periodical indexes. Jones recalls, \\"This experience was a thrilling one for me, and my imagination ran wild at the magic of the St. Louis Public Library, a great storehouse of information, ideas, and inspiration. I thought that to be a librarian like that reference librarian who helped me in the St. Louis Public Library would be the greatest thing in the world.\\" Education and career After high school, Jones abandoned the idea of becoming a teacher and instead enrolled at the Hampton Institute in Hampton, Virginia, the only library school in the South at the time where African-Americans could be trained. There she met Florence Rising Curtis, who would play an integral role in Jones' career. Curtis was the director of the library school and would become a mentor to Jones, who earned a B.S. in Library Science from Hampton in 1933. Later that same year, she found employment in Kentucky as the assistant librarian of Louisville Municipal College, which was the African-American branch of the segregated University of Louisville. She soon realized that a career in librarianship would require an advanced degree, but in order to do so she first had to complete a bachelor's degree in education. Jones returned to the Hampton Institute and earned a B.S. in Social Studies Education in 1935. During Jones' second tenure at Hampton, Curtis invited Jones, along with other faculty and students, to attend the American Library Association's annual conference in Richmond, Virginia. The Black participants were unable to attend the exhibits or stay in the provided accommodations, and special arrangements had to be made for them to attend the regular meetings. Due to her fair complexion, Jones was able to pass for white, and therefore she could stay at the hotel and view the exhibits. Jones later stated, \\"I never liked the idea of passing for white, but I did it, nevertheless... I had mixed feelings about doing so... on the other hand, I felt a sense of triumph in outsmarting the blatant and cruel racial discrimination of whites.\\" At this time, a realization of the importance of training for African-American school librarians began. Florence Curtis proposed the establishment of regional centers to provide summer classes for these librarians and chose Jones to head the program at the Prairie View A&M; College in Texas. There courses were taught in reference, book selection, school library administration, and cataloging and classification. In fall 1936, Jones returned to Louisville Municipal College as Head Librarian and she also taught courses for African- American public and high school librarians who needed to earn college credit in order to be certified by the state. Now ready to begin her graduate education, Virginia Lacy Jones received a General Education Board fellowship upon recommendation from her mentor Florence Curtis, to attend the University of Illinois. Curtis strongly believed that Jones would be beneficial to library development for African-Americans in the South. In 1938, Jones completed a master's in Library Science. Upon completion of her master's degree, she returned once again to Louisville Municipal College as librarian and instructor. However, there had been a change in leadership while Jones was away, and when it became apparent that she could no longer tolerate the working environment, Jones resigned. The day following her resignation, Rufus Clement offered Jones a position as catalog librarian at Atlanta University. She had known Clement from Louisville Municipal College where he had been president. Clement had recently accepted the position of president at Atlanta University, where he had plans to create a library school to replace the school at the Hampton Institute, which had closed its doors. Leaving Kentucky for Atlanta, Jones found herself taking part in something very exciting. Her new position allowed her to participate in the planning of what would become the Atlanta University School of Library Service. She was sent to library schools throughout the Eastern United States to observe the various programs. The school opened in the fall of 1941. The purpose and commitment of the school was to not only train librarians, but to create leaders for the betterment of library services in the South in general, and for African- Americans in particular. Again Jones held dual positions within the university. She was catalog librarian as well as an instructor. It was also in fall 1941 that she married Edward A. Jones, Professor of French and Chairman of the Foreign Languages Department at Morehouse College. After she had been teaching for two years at Atlanta University, Virginia Lacy Jones was awarded a second fellowship provided by the General Education Board. This allowed Jones to attend the University of Chicago Graduate Library School where, in 1945, she became the second African-American to earn a doctorate in Library Science. Her dissertation was on \\"The Problems of Negro Public High School Libraries in Selected Southern Cities.\\" She served on the faculty at the Atlanta University School of Library Service until she was appointed Dean in 1945. She was the second person to hold this position, after Eliza Atkins Gleason, the first African-American to receive a doctorate in Library Science. Her tenure as dean of the School of Library Service ran until 1981.Nyren, 94 During the 36 years Jones spent as dean, the school trained some 1800 black librarians, which was more than any other school in the country. After her retirement, Jones was appointed the first director of the Robert W. Woodruff Library at the Atlanta University Center, a position she held from 1982 to 1983. During her professional career, Jones wrote on issues that concerned libraries in the South and those dealing with Library Science education for African-Americans. The Robert W. Woodruff Library now houses 18.5 linear feet of these papers, as well correspondences, personal letters, and photographs all pertaining to her life. She died in December 1984 in Atlanta and was buried in South-View Cemetery there. Honors and awards During her professional career, Virginia Lacy Jones received numerous awards and recognitions. In 1967, she was elected the first African-American president of the Association for Library and Information Science Education. That same year President Lyndon B. Johnson appointed her to the President's Advisory Committee on Library Research and Training Projects where she was responsible for the report on children's and youth services. In 1973, Jones was awarded the Melville Dewey Award by the American Library Association. She was the first African-American to receive this award and the Joseph E. Lippincott Award, which she was given in 1977. In 1976 she was elected to honorary membership in ALAAmerican Library Association. Honorary Membership. This is the association's highest honor. Other awards given to Jones include: an honorary Doctor of Letters from the University of Michigan (1979), Beta Phi Mu Award (Library Science Honorary Society) Award (1980), and the Mary Rothrock Award (1980). In 1985, the Robert W. Woodruff Library's exhibition hall at Atlanta University was named for her. In 1999, American Libraries named her one of the \\"100 Most Important Leaders We Had in the 20th Century.\\"Leonard Kniffel, Peggy Sullivan, Edith McCormick, \\"100 of the Most Important Leaders We Had in the 20th Century,\\" American Libraries 30, no. 11 (December 1999): 43.

These materials are typically cell-free, distinguishing them from classical allografts and xenografts, can be integrated or incorporated into the body, and have been FDA approved for human use for more than 10 years in a wide range of clinical indications.Cornwell, K.G., Landsman, A., James, K.S. Extracellular Matrix Biomaterials for Soft Tissue Repair. Clin Podiatr Med Surg 26 (2009) 507‚Äì523 (Original Article) Harvesting and processing All ECM samples originate from mammalian tissues, such as dermis, pericardium, and small intestinal submucosa (SIS). After explantation from the source, the ECM biomaterial retains some characteristics of the original tissue. The ECM tissues can be harvested from varying stages in the developmental stages in mammalian species such as human, porcine, equine, and bovine. Although they are similarly composed of fibril collagen, the microstructure, specific composition (including presence of noncollageous protein and glycosaminoglycans and ratio of different types of collagen), physical dimensions and mechanical properties can differ. Depending on the developmental stage of the tissue during which harvesting occurred, the microstructure can vary within an organism. Additionally, keeping in mind the size and shape of the final tissue, the potential of the physical dimensions of the tissue of origin must be considered. Despite this ‚Äúmemory‚Äù of the ECM tissue, methods have been engineered so that these innate characteristics can be modified, saved or removed. The modification process varies depending on the material used in clinical setting. Some ECM biomaterials undergo a modification that removes all the cells but leaves the remainder of the other ECM components called decellularization. Another process that can be introduced into the biomaterial is artificial crosslinking. Artificial crosslinking has been shown to stabilize reconstituted collagen, which can rapidly degenerate in vivo. Although mechanical strength is gained, the artificial crosslinks that are added increase the chance for a host-cell rejection, due to its foreign origin.Badylak S. \\"Host Response to Biomaterials\\" Due to this complication, intentional crosslinking is no longer practiced as more recent advancements have been made that increase the lifespan of the collagen without the use of artificial stabilization. Finally, to ensure the ECM biomaterial is without infectious bacteria and viruses, most are terminally sterilized. This can include ethylene oxide (EO) gas, gamma irradiation, or electron beam (e-beam) irradiation as the sterilizing agent. In all, the small variances from origin, time of harvest, and processing method can direct the final properties of the ECM biomaterial. Decellularized ECM biomaterials can be further processed into a fine powder and then lyophilized (freeze-dried). This powder can then be mixed with collagenase to form an ECM derived hydrogel (self-healing hydrogels). These hydrogels are then used in cell culture to help maintain cell phenotype and increase cell proliferation. Cells cultured on ECM hydrogels maintain their phenotype better than cells cultured on other substrates such as matrigel or type 1 collagen.Wolf MT, et al. \\"A hydrogel derived from decellularized dermal extracellular matrix\\"Sawkins MJ, et al. \\"Hydrogels derived from demineralized and decellularized bone extracellular matrix\\" Though hydrogels do not yet have direct clinical relevance, they have shown promise as a method of assisting in organ regeneration.Barker TH \\"The role of ECM proteins and protein fragments in guiding cell behavior in regenerative medicine\\" Similarly, whole organs can be decellularized to create 3-D ECM scaffolds.Faulk DM, et al. \\"Role of the extracellular matrix in whole organ engineering\\" These scaffolds can then be re-cellularized in an attempt to regenerate whole organs for transplant. This method works primarily for organs with a complex vasculature, as it allows detergent to be fully perfused through the material. Host/implant interactions Wound healing of the skin and tendons is a complex coordinated process in the body that happens slowly over weeks or even years. A number of products in the market today aim to affect this process positively, although little data is available on their success. The majority of products are still in the development phases where the (often inflammatory) interactions between the host and the implanted devices are being assessed. Implanted ECM biomaterials fall into two general categories based on how they interact with the host. Incorporating devices eventually allow the growth of cells and passage of blood vessels through the matrix, whereas nonincorporating biomaterials are encapsulated by a wall of fused macrophages. In nonincorporating biomaterials such as Permacol, an acellular porcine dermal implant for hernia repair, it is important that the material is not degraded or infiltrated by the immune system.Faulk DM, et al. \\"ECM hydrogel coating mitigates the chronic inflammatory response to polypropylene mesh.\\" Encapsulated biomaterials that are recognized as foreign can be degraded and/or rejected by the body and migrate to the outside of the body. In incorporated ECM biomaterials, infiltration by the immune system can occur in as few as seven days, leading to rapid degradation of the device volume. In the case of Graftjacket, an allograft from human dermis, the matrix is quickly populated by host cells as vasculature. The device itself decreased more than 60% in volume, and is replaced with host fibroblasts and macrophages.[Graft Jacket Applications ECM biomaterials are used to promote healing in a number of tissues, especially the skin and tendons. Surgimend, a collagen matrix derived from fetal bovine dermis, can trigger the healing of tendons (which do not heal spontaneously) in the ankle. This intervention can shorten healing time by almost half and allows the patient to return to full activity much sooner.Tei Biosciences Open wounds, like tendons, do not spontaneously heal and can persist for long stretches of time. When ECM biomaterials are added in multiple layers to the ulcer, the wound begins to close quickly and generates host tissue. Although preliminary studies seem promising, little information is available on the success of and direct comparisons between different ECM biomaterial devices in human trials.

S.1221 and H.R. 1392 will amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to ensure more appropriate payment amounts for drugs and biologicals under Part B of the Medicare Program by excluding customary prompt pay discounts extended to wholesalers from the manufacturer's Average Sales Price (ASP). Prompt pay discounts are provided by pharmaceutical manufacturers to drug distributors. Because they are financing terms between manufacturers and distributors, prompt pay discounts are not passed on to community cancer clinics. However, the Medicare Modernization Act of 2003 (MMA) required that prompt pay discounts be included in the calculation of ASP. Their inclusion artificially reduces Medicare reimbursement rates by approximately 2%. Currently the prompt pay discounts artificially reduce Medicare Part B drug reimbursement rates for community oncology clinics, jeopardizing the viability of these providers. Additionally, prompt pay discounts also reduce the payment rates of private payers that use ASP. The bill is a step forward in addressing problems with Medicare reimbursement for cancer drugs. Excluding distributor prompt pay discounts from the ASP methodology is consistent with existing policy and will create greater uniformity among federal healthcare programs, as these terms already are excluded from the Medicaid Average Manufacturer Price (AMP) methodology.

Zone in Orlando, Florida. It was the fourth event under the Turning Point chronology, and the twelfth and last event on the 2007 TNA PPV schedule. Eight professional wrestling matches were featured on the event's card with only one featuring a championship. The main event was a Six Man Tag Team match, in which the team of Samoa Joe, Kevin Nash, and Eric Young defeated The Angle Alliance (Kurt Angle, A.J. Styles, and Tomko). In another tag team match, Christian Cage and Robert Roode were defeated by Booker T and Kaz. In a high-profile match, Johnny Devine and Team 3D (Brother Devon and Brother Ray) wrestled Jay Lethal and The Motor City Machine Guns (Alex Shelley and Chris Sabin) in a Six Man Tag Team Tables Match. Devine and Team 3D won the contest. The contest between Abyss and Raven versus Black Reign and Rellik in a Match of 10,000 Tacks was also featured on the card. Abyss and Raven won the encounter. The event is remembered for Scott Hall's failure to show up for the event and for Samoa Joe's unscripted rant against the promotion. It also marks the first time the Feast or Fired match was held. The professional wrestling section of the Canadian Online Explorer website rated the entire event a six and a half out of ten, higher than the 2006 event's rating of six. Production=Background TNA announced in mid-September 2007 that the fourth Turning Point event would take place on December 2, 2007. The location was not announced, but various news sites speculated that it would be held outside the TNA Impact Zone in Orlando, Florida. However, in mid-October, TNA announced the event would be held at the TNA Impact! Zone. TNA created a section on their official website for the event. The promotional poster was released through PPV providers featuring Abyss, Black Reign, and Judas Mesias and the tagline \\"Silent Night...Bloody Night\\". TNA held a thirty-minute Road to Turning Point special on Spike TV to promote the event. Storylines Turning Point featured eight professional wrestling matches that involved different wrestlers from pre-existing scripted feuds and storylines. Wrestlers portrayed villains, heroes, or less distinguishable characters in the scripted events that built tension and culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches. Kevin Nash requested the Six Man Tag Team match at Turning Point. The main event was a Six Man Tag Team match pitting The Angle Alliance (Kurt Angle, A.J. Styles, Tomko) against the team of Scott Hall, Kevin Nash, and Samoa Joe. Jim Cornette, Management Director, made the announcement on the November 15 episode of TNA's television program TNA Impact!. The match was at the request of Hall and Nash, with the stipulation that they would be able to choose a mystery partner. Their mystery partner was later revealed to be Joe during the same episode. The buildup to this encounter began on the November 8 episode of Impact!, when Nash questioned if Hall was Sting's mystery partner in a tag team match against Nash and Angle at TNA's Genesis PPV event on November 11. Hall denied he was Sting's partner and at the sametime mended an alliance with Nash. At Genesis, then-champion Angle and Nash faced Sting and the debuting Booker T in a tag team match for the TNA World Heavyweight Championship. Nash almost won the encounter before being attacked by Angle, thus costing him the pinfall and the championship, and creating a rivalry between the two. The match Kaz and Booker T versus Christian Cage and Robert Roode was also scheduled. On the November 15 episode of Impact!, Booker T, along with his real-life wife Sharmell, made their Impact! debut signing talent contracts. They were interrupted by Cage, sparking a rivalry between Booker T and Cage. On the November 29 episode of Impact!, Cage manipulated Roode into thinking that Booker T was trying to steal his spot at becoming a main star in the promotion. Roode went on to fight Booker T later in the episode in a losing effort. After the encounter, Cage and Roode attacked Booker T, which led Kaz to come to his aid in the situation. A tag team match between the four was later promoted by TNA for Turning Point. Another featured match on the card was a Six Man Tag Team Tables match pitting the teams of Johnny Devine and Team 3D (Brother Devon and Brother Ray) against Jay Lethal and The Motor City Machine Guns (Alex Shelley and Chris Sabin) (MCMG). On the October 18 episode of Impact!, Team 3D attacked MCMG and declared they were going to destroy the X Division to which they belonged. This was due to MCMG helping The Steiner Brothers (Rick and Scott Steiner) defeat Team 3D at TNA's Bound for Glory PPV event on October 14. The two teams then fought at Genesis with MCMG winning the contest. Later in the event, Team 3D attacked and stole the TNA X Division Championship from then-champion Lethal. On the November 15 episode of Impact!, Devine, an X Division wrestler, turned on the division and joined Team 3D, helping to attack MCMG and Lethal. A Six Man Tag Team Tables match was later added to the Turning Point card. Several lower profile matches were featured at Turning Point. Two were Gail Kim defending the TNA Women's World Championship against Awesome Kong and the team of Abyss and Rhino versus the team of Black Reign and Rellik in a Match of 10,000 Tacks. Also scheduled was the first-ever Feast or Fired match. Kim's title defense was announced on the November 22 episode of Impact! and was the result of a brawl between the two on the November 15 episode of Impact!. Four cases would be hung above four padded turnbuckles, with three holding a title shot while the last holding a pink slip. The Match of 10,000 Tacks was the result of a Shop of Horrors match between Abyss and Reign at Genesis. Abyss won the match, but after the encounter Rellik debuted, creating an alliance with Reign by attacking Abyss. On the November 15 episode of Impact!, Abyss defeated Reign and Rellik in a 3-Way Dance. Afterwards, Reign and Rellik attacked Abyss until Rhino came to Abyss' aid. Impact! commentator Mike Tenay later announced on the November 22 episode of Impact!, that Rhino and Abyss were scheduled to face Reign and Rellik in a Match of 10,000 Tacks at Turning Point 2007. Event=Miscellaneous The event featured employees other than the wrestlers involved in the matches. Mike Tenay and Don West were the commentators for the telecast. David Penzer was the ring announcer for all contests. Earl Hebner, Rudy Charles, Mark \\"Slick\\" Johnson, and Andrew Thomas were referees for the encounters. Jeremy Borash and Crystal Louthan conducted interviews throughout the event. Besides wrestlers who appeared in a wrestling role, Christy Hemme, Jackie Moore, Ms. Brooks, Karen Angle, and Sharmell were also featured on the broadcast. Preliminary matches alt=Two adult males, one black and one white, wearing black shirts doing hand gestures. The first match to take place on the event's card was the Six Man Tag Team Tables match pitting the team of Johnny Devine and Team 3D against the team of Jay Lethal and MCMG. The match lasted fourteen minutes and fifty-nine seconds. The objective of a Six Man Tag Team Tables match is to drive one of the members of the opposing team through a table. During the contest, Lethal drove Devine through a table with a driving elbow drop. However, as the referee was scripted to appear unconscious, this allowed Team 3D to knockout MCMG and Lethal with the X Division Championship belt. They followed by draping Devine over Lethal, making it appear as though Devine had drove Lethal through the table, thus winning the match for his team. Velvet- Love Entertainment (Angelina Love and Velvet Sky) faced off against the team of ODB and Roxxi Laveaux in a tag team match next. The duration of the contest was six minutes and two seconds. Velvet-Love Entertainment were the victors by pinfall after Love kicked Laveaux in the face. Eric Young fought James Storm, who was accompanied by Jackie Moore, in the third encounter which lasted twelve minutes and twenty-one seconds. Young won the contest with a roll-up pin while Storm was accidentally distracted by the referee. TNA held the first-ever Feast or Fired match next. In the Feast or Fired match, four briefcases are held above four different turnbuckles on poles, with three having future title shots for the TNA World Heavyweight, TNA X Division, and TNA World Tag Team Championships; the remaining briefcase holds a pink slip, leading to that wrestler's contract termination. A wrestler must retrieve the briefcase and then leave the ring in order to gain official possession of the case. The participants in the bout were Scott Steiner, Senshi, B.G. James, Petey Williams, Shark Boy, Lance Hoyt, Christopher Daniels, Elix Skipper, Homicide, Hernandez, Kip James, Jimmy Rave, Chris Harris, and Sonjay Dutt. The contest lasted eleven minutes and fifty-five seconds. Christy Hemme accompanied Rave and Hoyt to the ring for the contest. Williams was the first to obtain a case in the match. Kip was the second; however he threw it to his Voodoo Kin Mafia tag team partner B.G. James who was standing at ringside, thus giving B.G. James possession of the case. A short time later, Senshi retrieved the third case. The final case was collected by Steiner, after he took it from Kip, who had taken it from the retriever Daniels. Main event matches alt=A dark-skinned adult male wearing a muti-colored T-shirt signing an autograph Gail Kim defended the TNA Women's World Championship against Awesome Kong in the fifth bout. It lasted eight minutes and twenty- three seconds. During the match, Kong repeatedly refused to listen to the referee's orders, and eventually pushed the referee down, resulting in a disqualification and Kim retained the title. The Match of 10,000 Tacks was up next, pitting Abyss and Raven against Black Reign and Rellik. Rhino was originally supposed to be a part of the match, but was removed due to a neck injury he sustained in a previous match; he was replaced with Raven. The encounter lasted fourteen minutes and forty-one seconds. Raven forced Reign through a table covered with thumbtacks during the contest. The team of Abyss and Raven won the bout, after Abyss slammed Rellik into a pile of thumbtacks and then gained the pinfall victory. Abyss required stitches as a result of this match. In the next match, the team of Kaz and Booker T, accompanied by Sharmell, fought the team of Christian Cage and Robert Roode, accompanied by Ms. Brooks. The duration of the bout was fifteen minutes and fifty seconds. Booker T won the match for his team by pinfall after slamming Cage into the mat face first with his Axe Kick maneuver. Kaz cracked his skull during the encounter. The main event was a Six Man Tag Team match originally planned to pit the team of Samoa Joe, Kevin Nash, and Scott Hall against The Angle Alliance (Kurt Angle, A.J. Styles, and Tomko), who were accompanied by Karen Angle. Hall had announced that morning that he would not show up. Prior to the match, Joe delivered an unscheduled, unscripted speech to the crowd explaining his anger and distaste for Hall's failure to show up for the event. He said that Hall \\"punked out on me and on every single fan in this building tonight\\", and concluded: \\"Scott Hall, chico, kiss my ass, you punked out and you're a punk\\". He followed this by announcing Hall's replacement in the match: Eric Young. The six men fought for a total of nine minutes and thirty-one seconds, before Joe slammed Tomko into the mat with his Muscle Buster maneuver to gain the pinfall. Reception A total of nine hundred people attended the event. Canadian Online Explorer writer Chris Sokol rated the entire event a six and a half out of ten, which was the same rating given to the 2006 Turning Point event. It was higher than the six out of ten given to TNA's next event Final Resolution. It was lower than the seven and a half out of ten given to TNA's previous Genesis PPV event. Compared to rival World Wrestling Entertainment's Armageddon PPV event held on December 16, Turning Point was rated lower as Armageddon was given a seven out of ten by Bob Kapur. In Sokol's review four matches were rated a seven out of ten, his overall highest rating given in the review. The first was the Six Man Tag Team Tables match, which Sokol felt \\"was a solid match.\\" The second match given this score was the Match of 10,000 Tacks, which Sokol believed to be \\"just an all out brawl.\\" Sokol rated the Kaz and Booker T versus Christian Cage and Robert Roode bout seven out of ten and stated he thought it was a \\"good match.\\" The main event was the final one with this rating, which Sokol thought was a \\"decent\\" match. The women's tag team match was the lowest rated match in Sokol's review, with a 5 out of 10. Regarding the entire event, Sokol thought that \\"despite all the chaos, the PPV still churned out some good matches.\\" Wade Keller of the Pro Wrestling Torch published a review of the event, in which his highest rating of two and a three-quarter stars out of five was given to the Six Man Tag Team Tables match, while his lowest of half a star out of five was given to the women's tag team match and the Storm versus Young bout. The Kaz and Booker T versus Cage and Roode bout was given a two and a half out of five stars. The main event was rated one and a half out of five stars. The event was released on DVD on February 5, 2008 by TNA Home Video. Aftermath alt=Adult white male wearing black and white wrestling gear doing hand symbols. Following Turning Point, A.J. Styles tried to unite Christian's Coalition and The Angle Alliance. On the December 6, 2007 episode of Impact, Christian Cage became leader of a joint alliance, until Kurt Angle and Robert Roode attacked him at the end of the episode. This led to Angle defending the TNA World Heavyweight Championship against Cage at TNA's Final Resolution PPV event on January 6, 2008. There, Angle defeated Cage after Styles attacked Cage, effectively siding with The Angle Alliance. The two fought again for the title at TNA's Against All Odds PPV event on February 10, 2008, where Tomko cost Cage the title, siding with The Angle Alliance as well. At Final Resolution, Roode and Booker T fought again in a Mixed Tag Team match. Sharmell had come to Roode's manager Ms. Brooks' defense on the December 13, 2007 episode of Impact! after Roode belittled her for losing a match, providing a reason for the encounter. At Final Resolution, Sharmell and Booker T defeated Roode and Ms. Brooks in a Mixed Tag Team match. After the encounter, Roode accidentally punched Sharmell, injuring her in the storyline. This led to a match between Roode and Booker T at Against All Odds, which ended in a double count-out. At TNA's Destination X PPV event on March 9, 2008, Roode defeated Booker T in a Stand By Your Man Strap match. Sharmell returned after this encounter, resulting in an Intergender Tag Team Six Sides of Steel Cage match at TNA's Lockdown PPV event on April 13, 2008 pitting Roode and his new manager Payton Banks against Booker T and Sharmell, which the later team won. Team 3D's feud with the X Division continued into Final Resolution. The two teams fought again on the December 6, 2007 episode of Impact! in a Six Man Tag Team Ladder match, which Johnny Devine and Team 3D won. On the December 20, 2007 episode of Impact!, Jay Lethal and MCMG defeated Devine and Team 3D in a Double North Pole match to determine the stipulation to their match at Final Resolution; choosing an Ultimate X match over a Plate glass Tables match. On the January 3, 2008 episode of Impact!, Team 3D attacked and injured MCMG in the storyline by beating their hands with kendo sticks, which made it hard to compete in an Ultimate X match in storyline. At Final Resolution, Devine and Team 3D won the bout. The feud came to an end at Against All Odds, where Lethal and MCMG defeated Devine and Team 3D in a Street Fight to save the X Division from disbandment. Gail Kim defended the newly named TNA Women's Knockout Championship against Awesome Kong at Final Resolution in a No Disqualification match and successfully retained the title. This led to another fight between Kong and Kim on the January 10, 2008 episode of Impact!, in which Kong defeated Kim to win back the championship. The contents of the Feast or Fired briefcases were revealed on the December 13, 2007 episode of Impact!. However, on the December 6, 2007 episode of Impact!, Christopher Daniels defeated Senshi with Elix Skipper as Special Guest Referee to win his briefcase. Prior to the unveiling, Scott Steiner defeated fellow briefcase holders Daniels, Petey Williams, and B.G. James to get to decide to either switch his briefcase with another or take a $50,000 buyout. Steiner chose to switch his briefcase with Williams'. Williams' new and Steiner's old briefcases were then opened, awarding Williams a future TNA World Heavyweight Championship match. James' briefcase was next, giving him a future TNA World Tag Team Championship match with a partner of his choice. Steiner's new and Williams' old briefcase as well as Daniels' case was open simultaneously next. Awarding Steiner a future TNA X Division Championship match and giving Daniels the pink slip, effectively firing him in storyline. After this segment, Steiner and Williams started a storyline over their briefcases, leading up to Against All Odds where Steiner defeated Williams to gain control over both cases. This led to Steiner and Williams starting a partnership, in which Steiner gave Williams the TNA X Division Championship title shot which he used on the April 17, 2008 episode of Impact! to win the title. Steiner went on to use his title shot at TNA's Sacrifice PPV event on May 11, 2008 in a losing effort against then- champion Samoa Joe and Kaz in a 3-Way Dance. James announced his tag team partner on the January 17, 2008 episode of Impact! as his real-life father Bob Armstrong. The two revealed on the January 24, 2008 episode of Impact! that they would use their title match at Against All Odds. The two failed to win the title from A.J. Styles and Tomko at the event. In October 2017, with the launch of the Global Wrestling Network, the event became available to stream on demand. Effects of Scott Hall's no-showing Leading up to Turning Point 2007, TNA officials began to suspect Scott Hall would not show up at the event, as the last contact with him prior to the event was earlier that morning. TNA officials soon received word from Hall that he was suffering from food poisoning and would not be able to attend. As a result of the no-show, officials approached Samoa Joe and asked him to help take blame off the company for Hall's no-show and to help promote talent in TNA by giving an announcement before introducing Eric Young as Hall's replacement. Joe's announcement went five minutes longer than originally planned, which upset several individuals in TNA. At one point during his announcement, he asked a person off-screen if they were angry and to go ahead and fire him, as he did not care; this individual was the legitimate president of TNA, Dixie Carter. After the event went off the air, a heated exchange between Kevin Nash and Joe took place backstage. The next night, TNA held a meeting and announced that anyone unhappy with their job could void their contract with the company. Senshi was the only one who wished to void his contract. During the meeting, Joe apologized for his actions at the event. Due to Joe's rant at Turning Point, TNA created a storyline in which Joe was unhappy with his position in the company. On the January 3, 2008 episode of Impact!, Management Director Jim Cornette announced that Joe and Nash would team up to challenge for the TNA World Tag Team Championship at Final Resolution. At the event, Nash abandoned Joe, causing him to fight off both A.J. Styles and Tomko, before succumbing to defeat in the storyline. After this, Joe and Nash began a partnership, in which Nash tried to help Joe deal with his issues over the way he was treated by TNA, and secured him a new contract. Joe was soon given a TNA World Heavyweight Championship match at TNA's Lockdown PPV event on the February 21, 2008 episode of Impact! by Cornette. At Lockdown, Joe defeated Angle in a Six Sides of Steel Cage match to win the TNA World Heavyweight Championship. Joe held the championship until TNA's Bound for Glory IV PPV event on October 12, 2008, in which Sting defeated Joe with help from Nash (who had been inactive since the summer). On the October 30, 2008 episode of Impact!, Nash said the reason Hall missed the match at Turning Point was that Hall did not believe that Joe was \\"worth the rub\\". Joe and Nash fought at TNA's Turning Point PPV event on November 9, 2008, which Nash won. Joe and Nash fought again several months later at TNA's Sacrifice PPV event on May 24, 2009, where Joe won, thus ending the feud. Those within TNA held strong negative feelings toward Hall for missing the event; many felt he should have at least tried to make it to the show. Dixie Carter was upset at Joe's comments prior to the main event, believing Joe tried to go \\"into business for himself.\\" Chris Sokol's wrote in his review: \\"The old saying was, 'Don't turn your back on the Wolfpack.' However, thats just what Scott Hall did when he decided to no-show his TNA PPV return.\\" ResultsReferences ;Footnotes ;Bibliography * External links *Impact!

Song information During writing and production of \\"Epitaph One,\\" the 13th unaired episode of Dollhouse (the television series for which Tancharoen and Whedon also write), the two writers felt that a piece of music was necessary over the coda of the episode, but due to budget concerns, they were unable to use a famous or popular song at the time. Rather, Tancharoen and Whedon wrote \\"Remains,\\" which can be heard over the episode's final scenes. However, they wanted the song not to appear too close to the content of the episode lyrically, so as not to distract the viewer with the realization that the song was composed specifically for the episode, despite the lyrics being thematically relevant but not overly specific to the context. Tancharoen and Whedon were happy with the end result of the song, which they felt sounded like a genuine piece of contemporary music, thus prompting them to release the song on its own merit as well. Despite \\"Epitaph One\\" having not aired on television in the United States, the episode did air in foreign markets (airdates varied) and was released in the U.S. on the first season DVD set of Dollhouse on July 28, 2009, with the song fully intact.

The book features many of Gogarty's Dublin acquaintances and well-known contemporaries as characters. Shortly after its publication, it became the subject of a highly publicised libel lawsuit. Literary style As I Was Going Down Sackville Street is told in the first person from the perspective of Gogarty. Unlike a conventional memoir, however, the book deals little with events in Gogarty's personal or professional life, instead using his persona as a vehicle for encountering and describing the geography and chief inhabitants of 20th-century Dublin. In writing Sackville Street, Gogarty sought to give \\"past and present the same value in time\\"; thus, while the first-person narrative is continuous and appears to occupy a compact chronological space, the events detailed span the years 1904‚Äì1932. Gogarty also rearranged events into (approximately) reverse chronological order, beginning with life in the Irish Free State and moving backwards through the Irish Civil War, the Irish War of Independence, and, finally, colonial Ireland. This structure was intended to loosely recall that of Dante's Divine Comedy, with the Dublin of the mid-1920s‚Äì1930s standing for Inferno, the Dublin of the 1910s‚Äì1920s for Purgatorio, and turn-of-the-century Dublin for Paradiso.Carens, p. 123 The tone of the book is predominately anecdotal and conversational; much of its action consists of lively accounts of dinner parties, luncheons, \\"at-homes\\", pub conversations, and chance meetings, allowing Gogarty to draw vivid portraits of his contemporaries by reproducing their speech patterns and characteristic social interactions. Gogarty also frequently embarks on humorous, rambling narrative monologues, pertaining to other characters, to the landscape, and to various salient issues of the time. While not strictly polemical, As I Was Going Down Sackville Street is notable for its political overtones, expressed in both Gogarty's monologues and in the speeches he places in the mouths of other characters. As a Catholic with strong intellectual and personal ties to the Anglo-Irish Ascendancy, a founding member of Sinn F√©in with a deep devotion to Arthur Griffith, and a Free State Senator who had suffered kidnapping and arson at the hands of IRA gunmen, Gogarty's political identity was complex and idiosyncratic, and in his book he gave frequent vent to his animosity towards √âamon de Valera and his disillusionment with Irish politics. Characters As I Was Going Down Sackville Street opens with the disclaimer \\"The names in this book are real, the characters fictitious\\", and a number of notable figures make appearances in its pages, including Eoin O'Duffy, James Joyce, W.B. Yeats, George Moore, Lord Dunsany, Seumas O'Sullivan (as \\"Neil\\"), √Ü, Robert Yelverton Tyrrell, John Pentland Mahaffy, Arthur Griffith, Michael Collins, and Horace Plunkett. One of the most frequently recurring figures in the book is that of Endymion, a Dublin eccentric, who prominently features in the opening and closing scenes and appears at intervals throughout the text. Gogarty critic James F. Carens has argued that the character of Endymion, a genial madman who has adjusted \\"Reason to the phantasmagoria of Life\\", can be read both as an embodiment of the city of Dublin and as a parody or simulacrum of Gogarty himself.Carens, pp. 125‚Äì126 Libel lawsuit As I Was Going Down Sackville Street was highly anticipated before its publication as \\"a riposte to Ulysses and an appendage to [George Moore's] Ave, Salve, Vale\\", and as a result of its popularity became the subject a lawsuit brought forth by Harry Sinclair, a Jewish art dealer, who said that two passages in the book contained libels against himself and his recently deceased twin brother, William Sinclair. These consisted of verses written by Gogarty's friend, George Redding, and prose commentary by Gogarty: The plaintiff claimed that he and his brother (who had heard of the book's contents shortly before his death) were slanderously characterised as lechers and usurers, and could be recognised in the first set of verses by the name \\"Willie\\" (a reference to William Sinclair) and the mention of gaiters (which Harry Sinclair was apparently known to wear). Harry Sinclair further identified himself and his brother as the \\"twin grandchildren\\" in the second passage based on the description of their grandfather as a \\"pursuer of the immature\\", and submitted papers to the court to prove that his own grandfather had in fact been guilty of the same offence. The case attracted a great deal of public attention, with one commentator observing that \\"only The Pickwick Papers, rewritten by James Joyce, could really capture the mood of this trial.\\"O'Connor, p. 279 Various witnesses were called by both sides, some claiming to have instantly recognised the Sinclair siblings from the description in the text, others claiming to have made no such connection; some witnesses also claimed that William Sinclair had immediately threatened to sue Gogarty upon first hearing of the verses, while others recalled that Gogarty had occasionally recited them in William Sinclair's presence without protest from him. Appearing as a \\"publication witness\\" for the prosecution was Samuel Beckett, then a little- known writer, whose impartiality was called into question based on his familial relationship to the plaintiff (his aunt had been married to William Sinclair) and who was humiliatingly denounced by Gogarty's counsel as \\"the bawd and blasphemer from Paris\\". Gogarty, put on the stand, alleged that the unnamed Jews of the verses were parodies or composite characters rather than deliberate evocations of living persons, and were intended to throw discredit on the practice of usury and moneylending generally.O'Connor, pp.280‚Äì283 Gogarty ultimately lost the lawsuit and was ordered to pay IR¬£900 in damages, plus court costs; the total cost to him was ¬£2,000 (equivalent to well over ‚Ç¨100,000 in 2010 terms). This outcome deeply embittered Gogarty, who had already suffered financial setbacks after the Great Depression and felt that the trial had been politically motivated.O'Connor, p. 284 Gogarty's critics differ over the extent to which the language of the offending passages can be attributed to anti-Semitism. Biographer J. B. Lyons alleges that Gogarty, though often sharp-tongued with respect to the Sinclair siblings, was not actually an anti-Semite, citing the evidence of his friendships with other Dublin Jews.Lyons, p. 194 James Carens observes that anti-Semitic remarks are present in Gogarty's early journalism and in his private correspondence, but upholds Gogarty's claim that usury and child molestation, not Jews or Judaism, were the intended targets of satire in Sackville Street.Carens, pp. 129‚Äì130 Influence Beckett critic Sighle Kennedy has argued that Gogarty's portrayal of the lunatic Endymion in As I Was Going Down Sackville Street influenced Beckett's novel Murphy, which was published just two years after Beckett had first read Gogarty's book in connection with the Sinclair trial.

He is the 3rd and current president of the World Uyghur Congress, in office since 12 November 2017. He previously served as General Secretary and Chairman of the Executive Committee of the congress, respectively, and has spoken on behalf of the rights of the largely Islamic minority Uyghurs which makes up the majority population in that region, as well as presented Uyghur human rights issues to the UN Human Rights Council, European Parliament, European governments, and international human rights organizations. In 1988, when he was studying at Xinjiang University, he led the students demonstration on 15 June 1988 in √úr√ºmqi against discriminations and unfair treatments on Uyghurs and was expelled from the school in the same year, later he fled to Europe. In November 1996, he played an important role in establishing the World Uyghur Youth Congress in Germany and served as Executive Chairman and President. In April 2004, he also played an important role in the establishment of the World Uyghur Congress. He is currently the president of the World Uyghur Congress and the Vice-President of UNPO. Early life and fleeing from China Dolkun Isa was born 2 September 1967 in Aksu and raised by his grandparents in Kalpin County in Aksu Prefecture until 9 years old, later he moved back to Aksu City and completed his Middle school and High school there, in 1984 he was admitted by Faculty of Physics of Xinjiang University and studied there until his dismissal in early 1988 when it was just half year before his graduation time due to his human rights activities for minorities, after that he went back to Aksu and worked for education. In 1990, he went to Beijing and studied English and Turkish until 1994. In 1994, he left the country due to detention threat and studied in Gazi University in Ankara, Turkey and received a Master's degree in Politics and Sociology, later he went to Europe and sought asylum there. In 2006 he became a citizen of Germany. East Turkestan Independence Movement China's government claims that Isa is the vice chairman of the East Turkestan Liberation Organization, however, this is denied by Isa. This claim by China has led to China's issuance of a red notice to Interpol which has not been acted on by Germany or any other country in the West where he has subsequently traveled. He has been on a Chinese list of wanted terrorists since 2003. Contrary to China's claims, Isa has condemned all terrorist activities. Olympic boycott Isa called for a boycott of the 2008 Summer Olympics which were held in Beijing due to an alleged cultural genocide that was being conducted against the people of East Turkestan and Tibet. Isa told AFP that China had failed to improve human rights in Tibet and China's western Xinjiang region, where Beijing is accused by rights groups of cracking down on local ethnic groups. Uyghur activists have been seeking independence or autonomy for the region, which they call East Turkestan. 2006 and 2009 Taiwan controversies Isa was admitted to Taiwan in 2006 to attend the meeting of the Unrepresented Nations and Peoples Organization, a movement co-founded by Taiwan in 1991, during the administration of pro-localization president Chen Shui-bian. There were reports in Taiwan's media in July 2009 that Isa had secretly entered the country in the lead-up to the World Games which were hosted in the southern city of Kaohsiung. This prompted the National Immigration Agency of the then China-friendly KMT government to issue a ban on his travel to Taiwan. Rebiya Kadeer was denied a visa to visit Taiwan later in 2009, a move linked to Isa's alleged connections with terrorists. Premier Wu Den-yih noted that if Isa steps down from his position in the World Uyghur Congress or if Kadeer steps down from her position, the ban would be lifted. Activities=Meeting with Binali Yƒ±ldƒ±rƒ±m On 16 February 2018, Turkish Prime Minister Binali Yƒ±ldƒ±rƒ±m met with the President of the World Uyghur Congress Dolkun Isa in Munich, where he came for the World Security Conference, Isa told the PM about the present situation of the 11 Uyghurs who are in custody in Malaysia and reiterated Chinese occupation, oppression assimilation, transformation and religious and ethnic genocide practices in East Turkestan. Dolkun Isa also met with S√ºleyman Soylu who is currently the Minister of the Interior of Turkey. Speaking in European Parliament On 15 May 2018, on the occasion of a meeting of the Subcommittee on Human Rights (DROI), Mr Dolkun Isa, Vice- President of the Unrepresented Nations and Peoples Organization (UNPO) and President of the World Uyghur Congress (WUC), together with Ms Sophie Richardson (China Director of Human Rights Watch) and Mr Ulrich Delius (Director of Society for Threatened Peoples), exchanged views on the human rights situation in China, with a special focus on the so-called Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region. The Uyghurs are exposed to restrictions of their rights to freedom of expression, freedom of religion and belief and even freedom of movement in China. Arbitrary detentions, in particular under the pretext of China's \\"anti-terrorism\\" law, remain widespread. Campaign obstructions=South Korea entry denial Isa was denied entry into the Republic of Korea and was briefly \\"detained\\" in September, 2009 while preparing to attend the World Forum for Democratization in Asia. The Unrepresented Nations and Peoples Organization condemned the detention and warned the Korean government in a letter that China's accusations are groundless and that extradition would certainly result in summary trial and execution at the hands of China's authorities. After being held for two days, Isa was released without being admitted to the country, a move that was condemned by Amnesty International. Indian visa withdrawal On 22 April 2016, India had issued a visitors visa to Isa to attend a conference in Dharamshala. This was viewed as a hardening of India's stand against China since the Uyghur activist Rebiya Kadeer had previously been denied a visa to visit India. This move by the Indian Government was widely seen by Indian News Media as an act of payback against China for its stand on not supporting JeM Chief Masood Azhar's designation as a terrorist in the UNSC. The Indian government in a U-turn from its earlier stance, later withdrew Isa's visa on 25 April 2016, a day after China raised objections to India Expulsion from UNPFII On 26 April 2017, Uyghur human rights activist and member of the Unrepresented Nations and Peoples Organization (UNPO) Dolkun Isa, who was participating in the United Nations Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues (UNPFII), was forced to leave the UN premises. The incident occurred outside Conference Room 4, where Indigenous Peoples Organizations (IPOs), forum members, UN member states and agencies were discussing the implementation of the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP). Mr Isa, the co-founder and General Secretary of the World Uyghur Congress (WUC), was asked for his identification document by UN security and was then asked to leave the UN premises, without being given any explanation, despite his asking for a reason. Despite efforts by the UNPO and the Society for Threatened Peoples, under which Mr Isa and his fellow human rights activist Omer Kanat were accredited as participants in the Forum, Mr Isa was not able to re-enter the building. Two days after the incident, on 28 April, he was denied a badge to be able to re-enter the UN and participate in the Forum. Detention by police in Italy On 26 July 2017, Dolkun Isa was approached by 15-20 plainclothes members of the Divisione Investigazioni Generali e Operazioni Speciali (DIGOS) while walking with colleagues to the Italian Senate. The officers, who were holding a photo of Isa, stopped him at the gate of the senate building and asked him to accompany them for an identification check, Isa said. the officers loaded him into a car and took him to a nearby police station. The DIGOS police checked Isa's ID, took his photo and fingerprints, and eventually released him after 3:00 p.m. Prevention from UN forum On Monday, 16 April 2018, Mr. Isa was prevented from entering the UN premises to participate in the first day of the Forum. When asked for an explanation, UN security was unable to elaborate further on the justification for the refusal, citing 'security concerns' once more. said UNPO. Mr. Isa remarked that \\"This represents a clear signal of the success of China's attempts to manipulate the UN system. I am incredibly disappointed and appalled that the UN has been undermined to this extent.\\" Removal of Interpol Red Notice On 20 February 2018 Interpol removed Red Notice alert for Dolkun Isa which was issued for him nearly two decades ago, The London-based rights group Fair Trials also confirmed that Interpol deleted a wanted alert, known as a red notice, for Dolkun Isa, who is currently the president of the Munich-based World Uyghur Congress. Dolkun Isa told reporters at the National Press Club in Washington that his case, which was closed last month after nearly two decades, demonstrates the need for countries and international policing mechanisms to reject efforts by authoritarian governments to target dissidents abroad. The fact that Mr. Isa's noticed originated from China, and that INTERPOL removed it, is also good news for those who have wondered about the effect of INTERPOL's new president Meng Hongwei on the organization's decision-making process, some observers believed that his position was more ceremonial and less influential over Red Notice issuance. The decision in Mr. Isa's case demonstrates that the Commission for the Control of INTERPOL's Files has both the willingness and the autonomy to issue decisions contrary to the desire of the Chinese government, irrespective of the organization's leadership. Chinese accusation in UN On 21 May 2018, during the resumed session of the Committee on Non-Governmental Organizations in UN, the Chinese delegation claimed that Isa had been \\"participating, inciting and funding separatism and terrorism for years\\", adding that while participating in regional dialogues at UNPFII he had indicated that he was \\"representing WUC instead of STP\\", despite only having accreditation as an STP representative. \\"All the above actions seriously violates relevant rules and regulations of the United Nations,\\" the letter said, urging the Committee on Non-Governmental Organizations \\"to uphold the authority of the U.N. Charter and withdraw the consultative status of STP\\". Kelley Currie, the U.S. representative to the U.N. for economic and social affairs, accused Beijing of preventing the exiled Uighur activist Dolkun Isa from entering U.N. headquarters in New York to speak at a forum on indigenous rights last month. Beijing demanded that the U.N.-accredited organization that invited Isa to speak at the United Nations, the Society for Threatened Peoples, be stripped of its accreditation. The United States sprung to Isa's defense, saying China was seeking to retaliate against an irritating advocate who has shed light on political repression against the Uighurs. The United States and Germany maintain that there is no evidence of links between the two groups. Death of Isa's mother On 29 June 2018, Radio Free Asia reported that Isa's mother died while in detention at a \\"political re- education camp\\" in northwest China's Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region (XUAR), according to security officials. In June 2018, Isa learned from a close family friend that his mother, Ayhan Memet, died on 17 May at the age of 78, but the WUC president was unsure if she had been incarcerated in one of the many \\"political re-education camps\\" throughout the XUAR, where authorities have been detaining Uyghurs accused of harboring \\"extremist\\" and \\"politically incorrect\\" thoughts since April 2017.

Directed by Nathan Greno the Head of Story on Bolt, the short film picks up sometime after the conclusion of Bolt. The excitable and TV obsessed hamster Rhino finds out his friends Penny and Bolt have been kidnapped and have to save them from the evil Dr. Calico. The short inspires Bolt: The Video Game and is a spin-off to the fictional TV show featuring Bolt. Super Rhino was included in the 2009 DVD and Blu-Ray release of Bolt. Plot Penny and Bolt have been captured by the evil Dr. Calico, suspended above a pool of lava, inside a heavily guarded warehouse on an island in the middle of nowhere - a base which is impenetrable to both people and dogs. Penny's father watches the events from his lab through a secret camera imbedded in Bolt's collar and worries that he cannot save her. Discovering that no man or dog can break into Dr. Calico's base, he turns to Rhino, who is watching TV in the background. In order to save Penny and Bolt, Rhino is put through the same procedure as Bolt to give him super- powers. Rhino uses his newly found powers to fly across the sea and crash land outside the armed base encased in his ball. Rhino's battle with the guard is witnessed by Penny, Bolt and Dr. Calico from the inside, with helicopters and cars crashing into the side of the building. As all the noise subsides a single knock on the door is heard and not receiving an answer Rhino uses his heat-vision to create an opening in the wall. On the inside Rhino uses his eye-beams to defeat the armed guards and commandeers a flying missile, riding it like a surfboard to aim at Dr. Calico, though the missile misses. Instead Rhino uses his super squeek ability to finish the villain off. With Penny and Bolt saved Rhino walks away. Rhino is next seen on stage performing \\"The Best of Both Worlds\\"; the theme song from Hannah Montana (by co-star Miley Cyrus), where it is revealed that Rhino has been dreaming his adventures all along. Mittens wakes him up, telling him that she's not a fan of his singing. The short ends with another dream sequence, this time about Rhino being selected by the President to defeat Calico once again.

In the article, A Yogic PerspectiveA Yogic Perspective: Light alkalizing foods - the key to endurance and good health, Morris Krok, Living Nutrition, vol. 6, 1990s he describes how \\"To heal and avoid illness, one must alkalinize the body through a diet of predominately raw fruits and vegetables.\\" Writings Krok wrote books on detoxification, internal purification, natural living, self-healing, fruitarianism, fasting, living foods, raw nutrition, physical culture, hatha yoga, meditation, deep breathing, higher consciousness, radiant energy, life extension and vitalism. As well as being an author, Krok published several books by other authors including Johanna Brandt,The Grape Cure, Joanna Brandt, Durban: Essence of Health Publishers Otto AbramowskiWater Into Gold, Ernestine Hill, Angus and Robertson, 1965, 291 pages, \\"Dr. Otto Abramowski was the grandson of a Governor of Warsaw, and had been a surgeon in the Franco- Prussian War of 1870, of which he told many a stirring tale.\\" and Theos Bernard, through Essence of Health Publishers. Golden Path Krok's book Golden Path To Rejuvenation described how a non-toxic diet and the osmotic pressure of rainwater could detoxify and purify the membranes and tissues of the body. Krok believed that internal purification, was the direct and most effective way for a longer and youthful life. He described how not everything humans eat is used by the body, showing how accumulated wastes and toxins caused by an unnatural diet and other substances, result in illness and premature ageing.Experiences in Euphoria, USA: Living Nutrition, Vol. 7, 1990s \\"euphoria can only be experienced more often if mucous-forming and toxic foods are not eaten, so that the 24 feet of small intestines and few feet of colon, become scrupulously clean. When these are kept clean, this cleanliness will spill over to the lungs, sinuses, nasal passages and eustachian tubes. What I infer from these experiences is that the wonderful feeling of euphoria, does not depend on a specific vitamin, mineral, supplement or food, but on the thorough natural cleansing of the entire body. Foods that are the big culprits are all starches, dairy products, eating too much of any cooked food, as well as of natural concentrated raw foods such as avocado, nuts, dried fruits and dates.\\" His internal purification programme was designed to help increase longevity and remain youthful.Experiences in Euphoria, USA: Living Nutrition, Vol. 7, 1990s, \\"If civilized man puts himself on an elimination program for an extended period of time, he will be shocked by the amount of stored slime that is dislodged and eliminated from the 30 feet of intestines and delicate bronchial tubes of the lungs. As he discovers the principle of detoxification, he will understand why no pill, special food or stretching exercise can clear the large thick, salty, toxic accumulations that foul the body..... The sticky, slimy and toxic substances contained in starchy foods, dairy products and animal foods will in a short time, neutralize hours of physical endeavor.\\" He believed internal cleansing in conjunction with plant foods was the 'golden path'. The book also explained the yogic vomit technique, a central part of the detoxification regime he endorsed. Legacy Krok was one of a series of 20th-century writers who wrote about fruitarianism, raw nutrition, fasting, detoxification, yogaYoga World Wide, Meenakashi Devi Gitananda, Satya Press, 1972, page 52, \\"Yoga is expounded in various parts of Africa.

Northeast Georgia is part of two media markets: metro Atlanta's toward the southwest, and the western Carolinas to the northeast. For the purpose of weather warnings, the westernmost counties of the region are considered to be north-central Georgia by the National Weather Service in Atlanta (NWSFO Peachtree City). The easternmost counties, bordering South Carolina in the Savannah River valley, are the responsibility of the Greenville/Spartanburg office (NWSFO Greer). Besides the Savannah River, and its tributaries the Tugaloo River and Chattooga River (which also form the state line), the other major rivers are the Chattahoochee River and its tributary the Chestatee River, which are the headwaters for much of metro Atlanta's water supply, held in Lake Lanier by Buford Dam. The Oconee River also begins near Athens, and the Little Tennessee River flows north from Rabun county. The Chattahoochee and Chestatee are west of the Eastern Continental Divide along with the Little Tennessee, while the others are east.

The vessel entered service in 1960 with the Department of Transport's Marine Fleet, before being transferred to the newly formed Canadian Coast Guard in 1962. The buoy tender served on both coasts of Canada and was used for search and rescue duties along the West Coast of Canada. The ship was loaned to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police in 2000 and transited the Northwest Passage, circumnavigating North America in the process. The ship was taken out of service in 2001 and sold to private interests. In 2006, the vessel reappeared as a yacht using the same name. Design and description Simon Fraser and sister ship were long overall with a beam of and a draught of . The vessel had a fully loaded displacement of and a gross register tonnage (GRT) of 1,358. The vessels were powered by a diesel-electric system (DC/DC) driving two fixed-pitch screws creating . This gave the vessels a maximum speed of . The ship carried of diesel fuel, had a range of at and could stay at sea for up to 20 days. The ships were fitted with a flight deck and a telescopic hangar and were capable of operating one helicopter. Service history The vessel was constructed by Burrard Dry Dock at their yard in Vancouver, British Columbia with the yard number 306. Simon Fraser was launched on 18 August 1959, named after a Scottish explorer who charted much of what became known as British Columbia. The ship entered service with the Department of Transport in February 1960. In 1962 the Department of Transport's Marine Service fleet was merged into the newly formed Canadian Coast Guard and Simon Fraser was given the new prefix CCGS. The vessel was registered in Ottawa, Ontario. Simon Fraser was initially assigned to duties in the Western Region, working in the Pacific Ocean. In 1986, the vessel was converted for search and rescue duties and transferred to the Laurentian Region in Eastern Canada. Towards the end of her career, Simon Fraser returned to buoy tending duties in the Maritimes Region, based at Dartmouth, Nova Scotia. She played a role in searching for wreckage that could show the cause of the crash of Swissair Flight 111. In May 2000 Simon Fraser was loaned to a Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) support group. Travelling from Halifax, Nova Scotia to Vancouver, the vessel transited the Panama Canal. From there, the Coast Guard ship escorted the on a transit of the Northwest Passage, which was recreating the historic 1940‚Äì1942 transit of .

He is known for taking legal cases alleging brainwashing by cults, self-help groups and for sexual misconduct by psychotherapists. He is considered an expert on these subjects.http://cfreemp3.com/mp3/paul-morantz-on-cults-confession-and-mind- control/ https://richardbrenneman.wordpress.com/2013/08/10/blast-from-the- past-synanon-rattlesnake-attack/Molko http://podcast.uctv.tv/webdocuments/legally-speaking/12_12LegallySpeaking.pdf His successful prosecution of Synanon led to an attempt against his life, by means of a rattlesnake.  Early life and career  Morantz was born and raised in Southern California. After high school, he served in the United States Army in 1963 for six months as a reservist. He then attended Santa Monica City College and the University of Southern California (USC) as a journalism major. Morantz became a sportswriter for the USC school newspaper the Daily Trojan. In 1967 he interviewed O. J. Simpson. Later that year he became co-sports editor of the Daily Trojan along with Lance Spiegel. In 1968, the Los Angeles Times offered Morantz a job as a sportswriter but he decided to go to law school instead. While in law school, Morantz took a position writing for the Pigskin Review. He played for USC Law School in the basketball intramural league. After graduation, Morantz became a Los Angeles public defender. He left the public defender's office in 1973, then worked part-time as both a lawyer and writer. During this time, he developed his feature-length article on surf singers Jan and Dean that was later published in Rolling Stone magazine, and wrote the story for the made-for-television movie.  Litigation history = Nursing home kidnappings  In 1974 Morantz uncovered a criminal conspiracy to kidnap homeless alcoholics and place them to nursing homes where they were kept sedated with Thorazine while the state was billed through Medical/Medicare and their social security checks taken. Los Angeles County supervisors called for a four-point probe on January 23, 1975, after hearing testimony that patients were often sedated, their ability to communicate with anyone outside the institution restricted, and detained in facilities behind locked gates and barbed wire if they tried to leave. Morantz filed a class action lawsuit on behalf of the former patients, testified on nursing home abuses during the public hearings and aided in the creation of a district attorney task force on nursing home crimes.  Synanon  In 1977, he investigated the drug rehabilitation institution Synanon, which had a reputation as a seemingly successful program for rehabilitating drug addicts where existing traditional hospitals had failed. Its founder, Charles Dederich, an ex-alcoholic, established it in 1958 as a non-medical self-help program that included the \\"Game,\\" a session in which participants acted out hostilities and sought the truth about themselves while not being bound by the truth in making critical attacks on each other. Synanon claimed it had cured thousands but by 1967 Dederich turned the organization into a \\"lifestyle\\" by recruiting non-addicts (\\"Squares\\") and building cities in Marin County, then Tulare County and eventually Lake Havasu. In 1974 Synanon declared itself a religion and centered on middle-class searching for utopia rather than addict curing. By then Synanon's assets, including real estate, ten aircraft, 400 cars, trucks and motorcycles, totaled around $33 million. Its advertising and specialty-gifts business netted $2.4 million in 1976 while donations and other income added another $5.5 million. Rules were passed mandating non-smoking, dieting, exercise programs, group marriages, shaved heads, vasectomies, abortions and exchanging mates. Approximately 200 couples \\"changed partners.\\" Members were trained in \\"Syndo\\" (Martial arts) with the elite placed in the Imperial Marines who were trained to and did commit violence against their enemies. By 1977 Morantz was warning government authorities Dederich was mandating violence against its enemies (\\"a reign of terror\\") and filing lawsuits on behalf of ex-members and victims.District of Columbia Circuit Court, Case No. 754 F.2d 395 , District of Columbia Circuit Court Morantz would later state in 1985, that he was among 50 victims of a Synanon \\"reign of terror\\" from 1975 to 1978.  Rattlesnake attack  Synanon members began to exhibit violent behavior, which culminated in 1978 when Dederich inspired followers to try to kill Morantz. Three weeks earlier Morantz had won a $300,000 judgment against Synanon on behalf of a married couple. The couple claimed that the wife had been held captive by Synanon and that during her stay, leaders at Synanon had attempted to brainwash her. On October 10, 1978, Morantz was bitten by a rattlesnake which had been placed in his Pacific Palisades home mailbox by two members of the Synanon Imperial Marines, Lance Kenton and Joe Musico. A neighbor applied a tourniquet that saved Morantz's life. Arriving fire department paramedics chopped off the snake's head with a shovel, and discovered that the rattles had been removed so that the snake could attack without warning. Morantz was hospitalized for six days.  Werner Erhard and est  In May, 1978, Werner Erhard and est officials offered to train the entire city of Parlier, located in the San Joaquin Valley, for free. Two city councilmen who had taken training endorsed it but many town members dropped out after training started and a controversy over est's presence in the community arose. Morantz came to Parlier to help the town. Morantz called the free training offer an attempt to use the tools of coercive persuasion on an entire community. \\"The whole thing I saw there scared me,\\" said Morantz. \\"It really was one of the scarier things I've ever seen.\\" Morantz then went to Deputy Chief Barry Wade of the Los Angeles Police Department and the LAPD police union in effort to stop est from providing free est trainings for LAPD officers. After Morantz contact and warnings, LAPD and its Union ended associations and training with est after one session had taken place.  The Center for Feeling Therapy  Morantz represented approximately forty ex-members of the Center for Feeling Therapy who after nine years rebelled against the Center, leading to its closure in 1980. Many of its former members later sued the founding therapists in what was then the largest psychology malpractice lawsuit in California history. The Center, a product of the Human Potential Movement, splintered from Primal Therapy, and was led by Richard \\"Riggs\\" Corriere and Joseph Hart who referred to themselves as the \\"Butch Cassidy and Sundance kid of Psychotherapy\\" and as the \\"New Freuds.\\" It also resulted in the removal of many of their therapists licenses. During the course of litigation, the California court of appeals in Rains v. Superior Court (Center for Feeling Therapy Psychological Corp.) ruled in Morantz's favor that the Center's use of physical punching (\\"Sluggo therapy\\") could be the basis for a battery claim despite patient consent to being hit.Rains v. Superior Court, 150 Cal. App. 3d 933, Court of Appeals California, 2nd Appellate Dist., 4th Div. 1984 Seven years after the therapeutic community ended, Corriere and Hart's licenses were removed. Four psychologists were found guilty of acts of gross negligence, incompetence, patient abuse, aiding and abetting the unlicensed practice of psychology and false advertising after a 94-day hearing before Administrative Law Judge Robert A. Neher.  Molko v. Holy Spirit Ass'n for the Unification of World Christianity  Morantz gave pro-bono assistance to the plaintiffs in the Molko case in which the California Supreme Court would decide if religious organizations could be sued for deceitful brainwashing. In 1988, following his investigation into the Unification Church, the state high court held that religious organizations may be sued for fraud and intentional infliction of emotional distress when they use brainwashing techniques.  John Gottuso  In 1988 Morantz successfully took on representation of former female patients of preacher-psychotherapist John Gottuso for sexual misconduct with his patients as an aid to their psychological and spiritual life. As a result, the pastor/therapist of Park View Christian Fellowship in California lost his license to practice psychotherapy as well as the right to be involved in his church's pre-school. A decade later Morantz again represented another six adults and five former students in a 1996 civil lawsuit against Gottuso, his church and its private school. The suit for sexual abuse and psychological abuse was settled in March 1998 for $3,200,000. In response to this case, California passed related legislation prohibiting private school teachers who by their past actions could not teach in public schools.  Other cases, legislation and law enforcement  He has litigated against the Church of Scientology, Peoples Temple, Hare Krishnas, Rajneesh movement and other religious groups.Church of Scientology v. Armstrong (1991) 232 Cal. App. 3d 1060 [283 Cal.Rptr. 917, Superior Court of Los Angeles County Morantz has also worked alongside of anti-cult attorney at law Ford Greene and Los Angeles County class action lawsuit king Thomas Girardi. He has collaborated with thought reform theorists and anti-cultist authors such as Margaret Singer, Louis Jolyon West, among others. He helped write the California law setting forth requirements under which a religious organization could be sued for punitive damages. In Hall v. Great Western Bank (1991) 231 Cal. App. 3d 713 [282 Cal.Rptr. 640] Morantz argued successfully banks could not fire employees for reasons that would violate public policy. In 2013 the City Council of Santa Monica gave Morantz a commendation signed by the Santa Monica Mayor for his cases against Synanon and dedication to welfare of others.http://extern.peoplecheck.de/link.php?q=synanon&url;=http%3A%2F%2Fsmdp.com%2Fbook- review-developing-a-cult-following%2F128691http://www.paulmorantz.com/wp- content/uploads/2013/08/City-of-Santa-Monica-Commendation-email.jpg \\"In 2016 a bill Morantz worked on for several years to protect minors from abusive live- in institutions was passed in California and signed into law by Gov.

Criticism of rebate cards Rebate cards have been criticized for not offering consumers the full amount of their value. With many of them, it is impossible to know exactly how much is remaining on the card at the point of sale. A purchase for less than the amount remaining can be made with the card, but a purchase for even one penny above this amount will be declined.

In 2000 Nadon was temporarily renamed St. Roch II in order to recreate the 1950 voyage of the RCMP schooner St. Roch around the North American continent. The voyage began at Vancouver on 1 July 2000, and involved navigating the Northwest Passage around the northern coast of Canada as far as Halifax. She was accompanied by the Coast Guard ship , as a support vessel. St. Roch II also carried out a search for a reported wreck from Sir John Franklin's expedition of 1845. Using a Kongsberg/Simrad SM2000 forward-looking sonar she completed a survey west of Grant Point on the Adelaide Peninsula. An area of of previously uncharted sea floor was searched, but found nothing, and a survey by shore parties of the unnamed island southwest of Grant Point, and the northwestern point of Grant Point itself found nothing definitive. The St. Roch II then continued down the eastern seaboard of the U.S., across the Caribbean to transit the Panama Canal before returning to Vancouver in December.

He was notable for having trained Violette Szab√≥, made famous by the 1958 film Carve Her Name with Pride starring Virginia McKenna, on which he was an advisor. Fernandez started the war with the Royal Signals but soon transferred to the Army Physical Training Corps, which brought him into contact with SOE agents. In early 1943, as a Colour Sergeant Major, he moved to Military Operations 1 based in Algiers to train for sabotage operations in southern France. In July 1944, Fernandez was dropped by US Air Force Liberator onto a plateau above Barcelonette, near Digne on the French-Italian border. The area has a strategically important pass called the Col de Larche (Italian Maddalena Pass) between the Cottian Alps and the Maritime Alps. Work to disrupt the possibility of a German counterattack against the US forces on the French side included blowing up the road in the Col de Larche, which remained blocked for two years. For this, Fernandez was awarded the Military Medal. In December 1944, Fernandez received an Emergency Commission as a 2nd Lieutenant with Special Forces and worked with the Italian partisans as a British Liaison Officer. He was also BLO with the 6th Airborne Division in the Baltic before joining as Staff Officer PT to the 1st Allied Airborne Group HQ in London. In 1947 he was listed as an officer with the rank of Lieutenant with the Regular Army Reserve of Officers with the Devonshire Regiment as part of the Wessex Brigade. He received an extension on the reserve list as Captain on 18 December 1950, which was renewed on 25 February 1954. He resigned his commission on 1 July 1959, retaining the honorary rank of Captain. Meanwhile, Fernandez had joined the British Foreign Service in intelligence, working mainly in Africa and the Middle East. He became Her Majesty's Consul at Seville on 4 July 1969 and later Algeciras when he was appointed OBE. On retirement from diplomatic service he joined a shipping company. Fernandez was parachuted at Seyne les Alpes above Barcelonnette. His war surname was then Rodolphe. He was picked up by French partisans and met Charlotte Franquebalme. She was their link and would bring up through the mountains food and material to the resistance. Franquebalme and Fernandez had a civil wedding in July 1945 in Marseilles and left for England by boat. A priest happened to be on the same journey and proceeded to a religious wedding. Franquebalme had three children with him. They divorced in 1957 and although Franquebalme came back to France, Fernandez did see his children and made them travel throughout the world as he had entered the diplomatic service. In 1963, Fernandez married Elizabeth Covington who had two children from a previous union. Honours and awards Fernandez was awarded the Military Medal in 1944 and the Croix de Guerre in 1946, and was appointed OBE in 1972.

In it, approximately 90 Red (communist) prisoners were killed by the White (anti-communist) troops, after the Battle of Varkaus in 1918. It was the first application of the Shoot on the Spot Declaration, which ordered that all Red leaders, agitators, and saboteurs caught red-handed, and whoever had actually participated in violence should be shot without trial, defining this as justifiable homicide rather than a death sentence. It was claimed by the Reds that the White troops, after the Battle of Varkaus, ordered all the captured Reds to assemble in a single row on the ice of Huruslahti, selected first all leaders and then every fifth prisoner, and executed them on the spot.Marko Tikka / Ajatuskirjat 2006 : Terrorin aika / The number executed was 10% of the accused. The Whites claimed that they individually selected each victim based on known identities and acts of violence rather than randomly, even though many victims were underage and had not participated in the battle. Furthermore, the condemned were first separated from the rest and then shot in groups of five. The legality of the event been debated: in modern terms, it would be considered a war crime. It was apparently embarrassing to the White leadership already at the time: there was no declaration of war, and the apparent legality was completely based on a military order, not law as conventionally required. The Senate considered the victims as \\"armed civilians\\". Without a particular law to authorize the death penalty, the executions can be considered illegal. However, the newly independent state of Finland had not signed any treaties on the laws of war, such as the Brussels Declaration of 1874 or the Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907. The general amnesty laws adopted after the war absolved all perpetrators from judicial responsibility.

The story revolves around two very different families living in the same neighbourhood, the Gonzales (a low-class family who have just moved from Huamanga, Ayacucho) and the Maldini (a rich and powerful family with a high economic status). It is one of the most popular telenovelas in Peru and is now being shown in Ecuador, Bolivia, Paraguay and Uruguay. Plot=Season 1 One of the most exclusive areas of Lima, \\"Las Lomas\\", is shaken up by the arrival of the Gonzales family from Huamanga, Ayacucho. The family settled in a half-built house they inherited. Their peasant traditions infuriate the neighbors, especially the family living opposite them, the Maldinis. The Maldinis are the richest family in all of Las Lomas, however, they still cannot find a way to get rid of the newcomers. Amid this confrontation, the Ferrands, another neighboring family, befriend the newcomers. Fernanda De Las Casas, daughter of the Maldinis, is enamored with one of the Gonzales, Joel, and they begin a relationship. The two families do not accept it due to their socio-economic differences. After they escape together, the family puts Joel in jail and sends Fernanda to Boston. In Boston, she falls in love with another man, Mike, who is wealthy and returns with her to Lima. Meanwhile, Grace (Joel's sister) becomes attracted to her close friend Nicolas (Fernanda's brother). However, he has a girlfriend, Cayetana Bogani, a spoiled and wealthy girl who mistreats Grace because of her lack of wealth. Meanwhile, Cayetana's brother Gianfranco is attracted to Grace and is determined to win her love. At the same time, Fernanda, Mike, Nicol√°s, and Cayetana try to set Mia (Fernanda's best friend) up with Gianfranco. Miguel Ignacio De Las Casas divorces Isabella Picasso because she finds out that he is cheating on her with his secretary. During the divorce process, Isabella falls in love with her lawyer Mariano Pendeivis (the former fianc√© of Francesca). However, he has a girlfriend and is shocked when he finds out that Isabella is in love with him. This leads to Isabella taking a holiday in Abu Dhabi, trying to follow in the footsteps of the Sex and the City story, and falls in love with somebody called Leonardo. She thinks he is perfect, but he is hiding a secret involving Claudia Zapata (the secretary of \\"Constructora De Las Casas\\"). Meanwhile, Miguel Ignacio refuses to sign the divorce papers, and is then fired from his position as General Manager when he is caught cheating on Isabella with his maid Gladys. Francesca (the owner of \\"Constructora De Las Casas\\") then hires Mike as General Manager. Nicol√°s mishears the conversation between Francesca and Peter (the butler) about the position and assumes that they are going to give the position to him. When he finds out that the position is for Mike, he is infuriated and leaves the house. Season 2 When Peter discovers that Claudia is manipulating Mike and convinces him to leave Fernanda, Claudia kidnaps Peter, shoots him in the chest and leaves him for dead. Claudia attempts to flee the country with money embezzled from the company but is spotted by Mike at the airport, who is also leaving after his attempts to win back Fernanda fail. Having heard of Peter's plight, Mike prevents Claudia from boarding the plane and she is subsequently arrested. While Peter is recovering in the hospital, Francesca overhears Peter in his sleep and under the effects of anesthesia saying that he has always loved her. Peter recovers only to find out his secret love is well known by everybody and Francesca does not share the same feeling. Soon everybody finds out because Gilberto, Nelly's husband, accidentally tells her. Determined to make Francesca look bad, she tells the whole family. At the same time, Grace and the newly changed Cayetana are planning Gianfranco's (Grace's boyfriend of whom she is convinced will make her forget about Nicolas) birthday which is sought out to be huge. While Cayetana seems to have changed, she plans the party as a trap for Grace and Nicolas (who returns to being her boyfriend after learning that she \\"changed\\"). It was when dancing that she reveals Grace's love for Nicolas and proceeds to pours a large amount of mud on them, embarrassing them in front of all the high society guests at the party. Grace then breaks up with Gianfranco knowing that she can never forget about Nicolas. Meanwhile, Mike succeeds in winning back Fernanda because she thinks it is over and decides he was the best thing that happened to her. Joel is also starting to reconstruct his love life because his co-worker Andrea is in love with him. He, on the other hand, is convinced that she is almost like a guy friend to him and that there will be nothing more. After learning that, Andrea tells him and Joel finally returns her love. Even though she really loves him, she is insecure and is afraid that Joel will go running back to Fernanda. One day Claudia calls Mike, and makes him believe that she had a mental breakdown which led her to commit her crime. At first, Mike does not believe in her, but at the end he starts visiting her. Unfortunately it is all a trap because somebody that Claudia knows takes a picture of Mike and Claudia kissing. Then Claudia sends that picture to Fernanda and Francesca causing the breakup of Mike's relationship with Fernanda for the second time and after that Mike leaves Lima. Meanwhile, Miguel Ignacio, falls in love with Gladys and they start a project by selling juanes. With a lot of effort they are able to open a restaurant called \\"¬°Ay, La Gladys!\\" (Lit. Oh Gladys!). But he has to face a problem: Regaining the love of his children who are ashamed of their father. After finding out that his father is poor and is working in a market with Gladys, Nicolas learns to accept it. Fernanda, however, does not. After regaining the love of his daughter, Miguel Ignacio's restaurant is burned down and he loses everything. Later, viewers learn that the fire was caused by Claudia's friend from prison. After losing the restaurant Miguel Ignacio, overwhelmed by the debts, decides to escape by leaving Gladys. While Miguel Ignacio is trying to escape, he receives a call from Claudia and finds out that she was the one who orchestrated the destruction of his restaurant. After realizing that he is helpless Miguel Ignacio decides to join Claudia. After his bold decision, Claudia tells him how to accomplish what he wants more than anything in the world - to get back at Francesca. She tells him a secret and Miguel Ignacio uses it to blackmail Francesca into giving him back his old job as General Manager. Meanwhile, Luciana, Raul and Susu's daughter return for Raul and Charo's wedding. Grace feels threatened because Nicolas and Luciana used to be a couple. When a rumor is spread by Isabella and Susu that Nicolas and Luciana are back as a couple, Grace furiously tells Nicolas everything she feels for him. After days without talking, Nicolas realizes that he loves Grace and that they should not be friends, but should date instead. After sharing a kiss with Grace, he leaves for her mother's wedding. On his way there, he almost crashes into a truck. Charo marries Raul in Las Lomas, and Isabella does the same with Leonardo in a hotel in Paracas. He dedicates a song to Isabella, to which they dance. When everything is over he reads a message that Claudia gave him and throws it into the water, revealing he is the brother of Claudia. Back at Las Lomas, everything seems to go well until an unexpected guest (Lucho Gonzales) arrives at the Gonzales' house, leaving everyone in shock and making Charo faint. Francesca, overwhelmed by the blackmailing of Miguel Ignacio, leaves the hotel with Peter following. When they are in the car, she starts to cry and reveals her secret to Peter: Isabella is not her daughter. Season 3 The first episode describes how Charo and Lucho's marriage was like 22 years ago, and what happens afterwards. Miguel Ignacio gains back his original post at the construction management office and calls Gladys, rekindling their relationship. Days later, Charo decides to board a plane with Raul for a getaway, but she ends up deserting him and heads back home, as she feels that she is abandoning her children. Later, she finds Raul and tells him that she wants to leave with him, but he rejects her as he felt hurt after she had deserted him. They both get divorced, as conflicting relationships arise with Lucho's presence. Later, Raul meets Renata Newman, whom he starts a relationship with to forget about Charo. Charo, in return, goes back to being Lucho's wife, without knowing that he hides a secret from her. Pepe, Tito, and Joel go to Rio de Janeiro, due to a website they joined. Later, Fernanda (out of jealousy towards the relationship that Joel has with another girl named Andrea) makes a blown-up picture of Joel making out with a girl he met in Rio. Consequently, Andrea breaks up with him. Claudia Zapata is released from prison, with every intention to make the people who hurt her pay. In an act of vengeance, Isabella, along with Francesca and Peter, smothers Do√±a Nelly with paint. In retaliation, Nelly says that Isabella is not Francesca's real daughter in front of her, giving Francesca a panic attack, most of all because Isabella calls up her mysterious sister, Rafaella, to tell her the truth. Rafaella tells Isabella that she is neither the daughter of Francesca Maldini nor of Bruno Picasso, but they both love her as if she were their real daughter. Claudia makes friends with Grace Gonzales, but later Grace realizes that Claudia was only trying to manipulate her. Peter, the Maldini's butler, later sees Claudia and Leonardo, Isabella's new husband, talking. This is something that makes him suspicious. Peter then leaves the Maldini house to go live in the Gonzales' due to \\"Madam\\" (his name for Francesca) and her mistrust of him. He then returns to his old post because Tito's mother, Maria Juana Smith, was harassing him, and because he knew that Francesca wouldn't really pay any attention to him. Fernanda gets back together with Joel, a fact that infuriates Andrea and Lucas, Fernanda's ex-boyfriend, and both Andrea and Lucas wish to get revenge on Joel. Margarita, Grace's best friend, takes advantage of the whole situation and attempts to seduce Lucas, and they later become a couple. Later in the series, Lucho's secret is revealed. On the day of the wedding in which he remarries Charo, three uninvited guests, a woman and her children, show up. The woman is revealed to be Lucho's lover, Reyna Pachas (Tatiana Astengo), whom Lucho met at a bar. Her children are twenty- year-old Shirley, a cute but superficial girl with a mean personality, and sixteen-year-old Jhonny, a kind and hard-working boy with a disciplined lifestyle. Everyone is completely shocked at the news, and the surprise eventually turns into rage, as the whole family is furious upon finding out that the reason why Lucho was gone for so long was because he was spending time with his \\"other\\" family. The wedding soon turns into a nightmare for everyone. It sparks much jealousy between the two families, especially in Grace and Shirley, as Grace and Shirley were both fully convinced that they were \\"daddy's little princess\\". When Shirley begins to sob about her father loving her other sister more, Lucho assures Shirley that she is the daughter most dear to him, a fact that Grace overhears, breaking her heart. When Shirley and Jhonny are kicked out momentarily from the house while everyone inside fights, Nicolas catches Shirley's eye, and she falls madly in love with him. She has no idea that Nicolas was Grace's ex-boyfriend, but when she does find out, she doesn't let that stop her. She does everything she can to make him love her back, without noticing that Nicolas is uncomfortable with her smothering affection for him. Like daughter, like mother, Reyna also tries to seduce Miguel Ignacio, who has gotten back with Gladys and is expecting a baby boy. Gladys, feeling that she is unable to compete with Reyna, becomes jealous and resentful. When Gladys starts to accuse Miguel Ignacio that something is going on between him and Reyna, he fires Reyna's son Jhonny who was working for him as a janitor. When Reyna gets the news she tries to seduce Miguel into giving the job back to her son. She brings him a plate of sopa seca (a coastal dish popular in Ica, where Reyna hails from) but when she comes clear the table she breaks down and starts to cry. She tells Miguel that she does not know what she is going to do because of what Lucho did to her. Miguel Ignacio, not knowing what to do, tells her that he will give her son his job back plus a rise and promotion. When she heard this she jumps up and hugs him resulting in Reyna giving Miguel Ignacio a kiss. Season 3 closes at the day where Mariano Pendavis and Teresa are about to get married and Francesca appears in the middle of the wedding and flees with Mariano, leaving Teresa in despair after having her wedding ruined and the Gonzales family furious. Joel and Fernanda get secretly married. A mysterious man from province (which is later is known to be Isabella's biological father) asks himself how his precious 'wawita' is.

Established in 1983 and incorporated in 1991, NUTV is a campus-based non-profit organization that offers opportunities to University of Calgary students and community members to explore the medium of television by learning the various stages of production. These opportunities include reporting/interviewing, hosting, writing, camera operation, lighting, sound mixing, using Final Cut Pro & Adobe Creative Suite, editing, producing, and directing. NUTV is part of the University of Calgary Tri-Media Alliance, composed of print (The Gauntlet), radio (CJSW 90.9), and television (NUTV). The University of Calgary is unique in that it is one of only two Canadian universities that house three media operations on-campus, the other being the University of Toronto Mississauga's UTM/TV. NUTV provides an important service to the community by broadcasting a bi-weekly community magazine program about news, sports, and arts for both the University of Calgary and greater Calgary community viewers. It is important to recognize that this non-profit society has volunteers who provide services directly to the community. Examples of these services include providing short videos to non-profit organizations for advertising, fundraising, or training purposes, giving students and community members the opportunity to gain professional level training on high quality equipment, and display interesting and useful information for the campus community's benefit on NUTV's closed circuit network.

It also participated in programs to recycle plutonium. One of the projects was the use of mixed plutonium-oxide uranium-oxide (MOX) fuel in the Fast Flux Test Facility (FFTF). For that project, one of the PFP's tasks was to perform quality assurance for the fuel pins that had been constructed for the FFTF by outside vendors, such as Kerr-McGee, NUMEC, and Babcock & Wilcox. The major activities at PFP generally included: * Created plutonium 'buttons', used to make weapons, until 1989 * Special nuclear material handling and storage * Plutonium recovery * Plutonium conversion * Laboratory support * Waste handling * Shutdown and operational facility surveillances. Divisions Plutonium Conversion Facility *'Remote Mechanical A' line - created plutonium oxide powder *'Remote Mechanical C' line - created metallic plutonium from plutonium nitrate Plutonium Reclamation Facility *Produced 'high purity plutonium nitrate solution' from a 'variety of feed sources, including scrap'. Started in 1964 Waste Treatment Facility *Neutralized liquid nuclear waste before it was pumped to Hanford's Tank Farms Incinerator *Burned old clothes, filters, etc. to recover plutonium residue Other *Ventilation systems, nuclear storage vaults, chemical storage, office space, backup generator, etc. *RECUPLEXRECUPLEX = Recovery of Uranium and Plutonium by Extraction process, Plutonium recovery and recycle. Contaminated the ground with plutonium, carbon tetrachloride, and acidic waste  Cleanup and demolition  Before the last four major facilities at the plant could be demolished, approximately 20 years of work was completed to stabilize approximately 20 tons (nearly 18 metric tons) of plutonium-bearing material by 2004; remove legacy plutonium from plant systems by 2005; ship all weapons- grade plutonium out of the plant and to the Savannah River Site by 2009; remove 238 large pieces of contaminated equipment, including glove boxes and fume hoods, and approximately 50 plutonium processing tanks; and demolish numerous plant support facilities, including the vault complex used for secure storage of plutonium by 2012. That preparatory work has been called the most hazardous cleanup work at the Hanford Site and PFP has been called Hanford's most hazardous building. The Department of Energy's PFP Closure Project intends to have the entire facility cleaned and destroyed down to a concrete slab in 2017, with all contaminated materials moved to other sites. Open-air demolition of the plant's last four remaining major facilities began in November 2016 on the plant's Plutonium Reclamation Facility. Demolition of the second major facility, the Americium Recovery Facility, also known as the \\"McCluskey Room\\" because of a facility accident in 1976, began in January 2017 and was completed in March 2017. Demolition of the third remaining major facility, the ventilation stack and fan house, was completed in July 2017. Demolition of the last of four major remaining facilities, the Main Processing Facility, began in July 2017. As of December 2017, all demolition is on hold, after contamination was found as far away as 10 miles from the site, and found in two car air filters that were checked by a Hanford contractor and deemed clean, but rechecked by an independent lab and were found to have small amounts of radioactive contamination.

The first show was the brainchild of Tourism & Attractions employee, Mark Brammar. The show takes place over two days, at the end of Summer, and attracts tens of thousands of spectators to see the many aircraft take to the skies above Southport and the displays that are held on Southport beach, making it the North West's largest Air Show.http://www.southportvisiter.co.uk/southport-entertainment/news- reviews/2009/09/25/the-britain-memorial-flight-major-attraction-at-southport- airshow-101022-24772444/ The flying programme includes military and civilian aircraft, classic jets, helicopters, aerobatics by the world famous Red Arrows, warbirds and parachute displays. The Southport Model Aero Club usually put on a model aircraft display before the start of the main air display. The show includes trade stands, interactive and educational displays, simulators and children's activities, as well as a military display with the highlight of a dramatic simulated battle on the beach involving army reserve forces complete with explosions and military vehicles. However, in 2007, the army units were unable to attend the event, due to operational commitments in Iraq. In 2009, a Eurofighter Typhoon made an appearance at the show. The 2010 Southport Airshow went ahead on Saturday 18 September with a display from the Red Arrows. The Sunday performances were cancelled due to poor weather, and heavy rain which caused flooding on the site.http://www.visitsouthport.com/site/whats-on/air-show/ In 2011, the show included the Battle of Britain Memorial Flight.http://www.bada.uk.com/calendar/icalrepeat.detail/2012/09/08/19/-/southport- air-show In 2015, the show on the Saturday saw the final ever appearance of Vulcan XH558 at the airshow.

The festival, which is currently sponsored by WR Shaw, was initiated by the Irish Farmers Journal in 1964 as part of the Kilkenny beer festival. The competition was then taken over by Offaly Macra three years later. County Meath lives up to the claim of being the \\"Royal County\\" by having had six Queens crowned over the years. Laois and Kilkenny come second with four titles each. The only year the contest had to be postponed was 2001; this was owing to the foot-and-mouth disease crisis that hit Ireland that year. It had the effect of giving Anita Meagher the distinction of being the only Queen to rule for two years. The host county has only tasted victory twice in the competition; Michelle Cody won in 1994 and Sinead Mulcahy in 2009, both from the Shinrone Macra Club. 2005 was the 40th anniversary of the festival. As part of the big celebrations, all former Queens were invited back to Tullamore to join in the festivities for the weekend. The festival is celebrating 54 years in 2017.

He was a trusted public servant who after 26 years as a Puritan, befriended persecuted Quakers and shortly afterwards joined the movement. He was banished from Massachusetts at 60 years of age and helped to found the first Monthly meeting of Friends in the United States at Sandwich, Massachusetts. Arrival in the colonies From their first arrival aboard the Mayflower in 1620, until 1629, only about 300 Puritans had survived in New England, scattered in small and isolated settlements. In 1630, their population was increased when the ship Mary and John arrived in New England carrying 140 passengers from the English West Country counties of Dorset, Somerset, Devon and Cornwall. These included Nicholas Upsall, Roger Ludlowe, John Mason, Samuel Maverick, William Phelps, Henry Wolcott and other men who would become prominent in the founding of a new nation. It was the first of the ships later called the Winthrop Fleet to land in Massachusetts. Nicholas married Dorothy Capen (1611‚Äì1675). They had fours daughters: Amasa, born December 1635; a daughter Elizabeth born December 1637 who married William Greenough on July 4, 1651; a daughter Susannah born July 12, 1639 who married Joseph Cooke on November 10, 1659; and Experience born January 19, 1640 who died August 2, 1659. Became Freeman and led community The earliest record of Nicholas Upsall was on September 28, 1630, when he was impanelled on a jury by the Court of Assistants to look into the death of Austen Bratcher. He applied for Freeman at the first General Court held in the Colonies on October 19, 1630 and took the Oath of Freemen among 108 others on May 18, 1631. Upsall was an upstanding Puritan and citizen for more than a quarter of a century. He was among the first to become a Freemen, possessing full citizenship as a result, and gained public trust, respect and esteem. He later found that his prior role in the community did not protect him against religious persecution. Upsall was granted land in Dorchester in 1633 and became its first bailiff and ratter in 1634. \\"It is ordered by the town of Dorchester,\\" April 17, 1635, \\"that Nicholas Upsall and Matthew Grant shall p'ceed in the measuring of the great lotts as they have begun.\\" Upsall was licensed as an innkeeper from 1636-1638. \\"It is ordered,\\" according to the town records of June 27, 1636, \\"that Nicholas Upsall shall keep a house of entertainment for strangers.\\" He was selectman in 1638 and 1642. In 1637 he was a member of the jury of Life and Death, as it was called, to distinguish it from the grand jury. Upsall apparently maintained an independent mind on political and religious matters, and was seen as man of \\"sober, and of unblameable conversation.\\" His stature in the community is also evidenced in a letter from Roger Williams to John Winthrop, dated Providence, April 16, 1638. Williams requested Winthrop to send his reply to Upsall in Dorchester, \\"because it is not safe for his messenger to wait for the answer.\\" This was three years after Williams's banishment. The same year Upsall became an original and the twenty-third charter member of the Ancient and Honorable Artillery Company of Boston, the oldest military company in America, which serves today as Honor Guard to the Governor of Massachusetts who is also its Commander in Chief. In 1644 Upsall and his family moved to Boston, and with his wife Dorothy was admitted to the church there on May 28. He was already a large property holder there, for in 1637 \\"he owned the land from the north- east side of Richmond Street and from Hanover Street to the sea.\\" He was also an inn-keeper of the Red Lyon Inn on the northeast corner of North and Richmond Streets. Met and joined Quakers In 1656, Mary Fisher and Ann Austin became the first known Quakers to set foot in the New World. They journeyed from England to Barbados and eventually arrived at the Massachusetts Bay Colony. Their goal was to spread the beliefs of the Friends among the colonists. Detail of a contemporary portrait of Puritan Governor John Endecott.In Puritan-run Massachusetts, which was extremely antagonistic towards dissenting viewpoints, the women were harshly persecuted. They were imprisoned, stripped to the waist and publicly whipped, and their books and materials were burned. The magistrates were set on starving the women and burying them. An unknown individual, likely Upsall, offered to pay their fine if he could be allowed to speak with them. The magistrates, having boarded up their jail window to isolate them, refused. Upsall, \\"touched with compassion,\\" gave their guard five shillings a week to permit him to bring food to the women. The women were deported back to Barbados after five weeks, having been unable to share their faith with anyone except perhaps Upsall. Upsall's act of kindness apparently escaped detection. But his contact with the women and their steadfast faith apparently moved him. On October 14, 1656, the Magistrates caused that a law prohibiting any citizen from aiding the Quakers was read in public. The act was apparently read before the door of his inn, Reprinted 2006 and he is recorded as having raised his voice in protest. He later wrote, \\"...that he did look at it as a sad fore-runner of some heavy judgment to fall on the country.\\" On the following morning he was called before the Court and charged with having expressed his disapprobation of the law against Quakers. Title page from a book protesting the persecution of Quakers in New England (1660-1661)A fine of twenty pounds was exacted from him, Governor Endecott saying, \\"I will not bate him [i.e., reduce his fine] one Groat.\\" He was besides banished to depart in thirty days, including four in prison, and was fined three pounds more for not attending worship after banishment. At 60 years of age, Upsall abandoned the Puritan Church, giving up the rights and privileges accorded to him as a Freeman, and joined the Friends. He was banished as a result and took refuge during the winter of 1656 in Sandwich, Massachusetts. There he helped to found the first Monthly Meeting of Friends in the United States. It began meeting in 1657 at the home of William and Priscilla Allen. Other founding Quakers included Richard Kerbey, Elizabeth Newland, and Stephen and Daniel Wing. He made friends among the Indians, and one of the chiefs called him \\"friend,\\" and offered to build him a comfortable house, if he could accept his hospitality. The chief commented about Upsall's persecutors: \\"What a God have the English who deal so with one another over the worship of their God.\\" On October 19, 1658, the Puritans passed a law stating that any Quaker who refused banishment would face \\"pain of death.\\" Upsall eventually left Sandwich for Rhode Island, though he returned to Boston after three years, when he was imprisoned for two years. When the \\"Boston martyrs\\", Quakers Marmaduke Stephenson and William Robinson, were executed, their bodies were dumped in into a pit dug nearby without a marker. Upsall, from his prison, asked to be permitted to build a fence around their burial site, but his request was denied. From prison, he still attracted people to his beliefs, and he was then sent to the Castle in Boston harbor for another year. During 1660-1664, \\"twenty-two [individuals] had been banished on pain of death, three martyred, three had their right ear cut off, one had been burned in the hand with a letter H, three had been ordered by the court to be sent to Barbadoes as slaves, thirty-one persons had received six hundred and fifty stripes administered with extreme cruelty, ¬£1044 of property had been taken from them, and another was martyred in 1661. His wife petitioned twice on his behalf, and when King Charles II ordered Governor Endecott to release all Quakers, Upsall along with many others was finally released. The court record recounts, \\"Nicholas Vpshall being formerly sentenced to perpetual Imprisonment, & obteyning a Reprivall, hath greatly abused their lenity, do therefore Order him to be Confined again to ye house of John Capen.\\" \\"Reprivall\\" [i.e., a \\"reprieve\\"] still meant banishment, and his transfer to his brother-in-law John Capen's home stipulated that he may remain free, \\"provided he does not corrupt any with his pernicious opinions,\\" or does not teach \\"the diabolical doctrines and horrid tenets of the cursed sect of Quakers.\\" He died there in August 1666 and was buried in Copp's Hill Burying Ground. Death and legacy On October 13, 1666, Nicholas' estate after payment of his debts was valued at ¬£543, 10s, a large estate for his times, especially given that for the last ten years of his life he lived in exile for having become a Quaker. His will specifically includes the Quakers: Historians believe the furniture he bequeathed to the Friends were in the Red Lyon Inn, which he owned at the time of his death. In 1694, Edward Shippen, the first mayor of Philadelphia under the city charter, gave a piece of land for a Friends Meeting House. On Brattle Street, near the site of the Quincy House, the Friends recorded that the \\"money from Nicholas Upsall's Chamber to go towards it.\\" The records of the Yearly Meeting of Friends for New England, dated April 7, 1694, contain the following: See also * Quakers in North America References Category:American Quakers Category:Converts to Quakerism Category:1666 deaths Category:Year of birth uncertain Category:Burials in Boston Category:People of colonial Massachusetts Category:Kingdom of England emigrants to Massachusetts Bay Colony Category:1596 births ","title":"Nicholas Upsall"},{"id":"24543931","text":"Six-Milles is an unincorporated community in Restigouche County, New Brunswick, Canada.New Brunswick Provincial Archives - Six-Milles HistoryNotable peopleSee also *List of communities in New Brunswick References Category:Communities in Restigouche County, New Brunswick ","title":"Six-Milles, New Brunswick"},{"id":"24543953","text":"Imperial Mills is an unincorporated community in northern Alberta in Lac La Biche County, located northeast of Highway 55, northwest of Cold Lake.

An Emeritus Professor of Virology at Erasmus University Rotterdam since 1993, Osterhaus is known throughout the world for his work on SARS and H5N1, the pathogen that causes avian influenza. Life Osterhaus was born into a Roman Catholic family of seven and grew up in Slotermeer, Amsterdam. From 1967 onwards he studied veterinary medicine at Utrecht University and graduated cum laude in 1974. He received his PhD degree in 1978 at the same university for a dissertation entitled \\"Feline infectious peritonitis: identification, propagation and epidemiology\\". He fulfilled several positions in his 16-year career at the Netherlands National Institute for Public Health and the Environment (RIVM) in Bilthoven, the last of which was head of the laboratory for Immunobiology. During that period he was also a part-time Professor of Environmental Virology at the Institute for Virology in Utrecht, a position he still holds as of 2009. In 1993 he became Professor of Virology at the Medical Faculty of Erasmus University and also head of the Department of Virology at Erasmus University Medical Centre Rotterdam. In 2013, he stepped down from his position as head of the department of Viroscience, as the Virology department is now known, and handed over the reins to Professor Marion Koopmans, formerly attached to the Dutch National Institute of Health, the RIVM. Osterhaus did not rest and set up a new institute looking at the zoonotic side of virology at TiHo in Hannover, Germany. He also holds a position at Artemis BV in Utrecht. Osterhaus played an important role in the identification of the SARS coronavirus. In February 2004, his team found that Pegylated interferon alpha, a drug used for the treatment of patients with Hepatitis C, helps combat the virus that causes SARS. Osterhaus holds various editorial positions for scientific journals, holds several patents, has been supervisor of more than 40 PhD students and has identified more than a dozen ‚Äúnew‚Äù viral pathogens and he is author of more than 1000 scientific papers, including journals like Nature, Science and The Lancet. Osterhaus served as member and chairman of many international scientific committees, most notably four WHO reference centres, the Dutch Influenza Centre, the Dutch Health Council and the European Scientific Working group on Influenza (ESWI). Honours and awards Osterhaus received several awards in his life, including the Dutch \\"M.W. Beijerinck Virology Award\\", a prize awarded triennially by the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1998. He is also a Member of Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences (KNAW) since 2001. On 15 October 2003 Osterhaus was knighted as Commander in the Order of the Dutch Lion. Other awards Osterhaus received include the Dutch \\"Dr. Saal van Zwanenberg Prijs\\" for pharmacotherapy, the \\"Reinier de Graaf Medaille\\" for clinical medicine, and on 13 June 2007 he was awarded the French \\"Grand Prix scientifique de la Fondation Louis D.\\" of the Institut de France. He shared the ‚Ç¨450,000 prize money with National Institute for Medical Research professor Sir John Skehel from London. Criticism Osterhaus has been criticised for what has been described as a 'fear campaign', for exaggerating the consequences of the 2009 flu pandemic and pushing for extensive measures, even though the pandemic influenza (H1N1) is now treated as if it were a common flu. Physician and microbiologist Miquel Ekkelenkamp called Osterhaus a 'scaremonger' in an opinion piece in nrc.next and said: \\"'Expert' Osterhaus should be banned indefinitely from television. Everything he claimed turned out to be untrue: we're not all going to die like we did in 1918, not everyone needs a vaccination, we are not going to give Tamiflu to everyone and the virus has not mutated into something much more dangerous.\\" Osterhaus claimed he has not exaggerated the risks. During debate 'De Kwestie live' he said \\"I have named a wide spectrum of possibilities and minister Ab Klink decided to go for the worst-case scenario\\" In September 2009, a controversy arose when it became known Osterhaus has a 9.8% share in ViroClinics B.V, a pharmaceutical company that supposedly benefits from the 34 million vaccines Health minister Ab Klink bought based on his advice as government consultant. Osterhaus maintains he did nothing against the law and that he does not personally benefit from the order.
